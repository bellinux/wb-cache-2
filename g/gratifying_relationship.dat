5|$|Ideally, {{these social}} skills become {{incorporated}} into the internal working model {{to be used with}} other children and later with adult peers. As children move into the school years at about six years old, most develop a goal-corrected partnership with parents, in which each partner is willing to compromise in order to maintain a <b>gratifying</b> <b>relationship.</b> By middle childhood, the goal of the attachment behavioural system has changed from proximity to the attachment figure to availability. Generally, a child is content with longer separations, provided contact—or the possibility of physically reuniting, if needed—is available. Attachment behaviours such as clinging and following decline and self-reliance increases. By middle childhood (ages 7–11), there may be a shift toward mutual coregulation of secure-base contact in which caregiver and child negotiate methods of maintaining communication and supervision as the child moves toward a greater degree of independence.|$|E
40|$|The term self-permission {{refers to}} a belief about the self that a person can hold, to a {{stronger}} or weaker extent. Self-permission, in short, is the answer an individual gives oneself when asking about their perceived allowance to reach overarching long-term objectives, such as having a fulfilling career or enjoying a lasting and <b>gratifying</b> <b>relationship.</b> At a broader level, {{the question is whether}} a person allows him or herself to lead a happy and rewarding life. This paper describes the concept of self-permission, explores its nomological network and possible antecedents and consequences, proposes a corresponding self-permission scale (SPS), and suggests a study for assessing 1) the psychometric properties of that scale, 2) its relationship with conjectured adjacent constructs, and 3) its relationship with psychological functioning. Considering how important it seems to be to most individuals to make the best out of their lives and to live up to a deeply felt sense of purpose, a better understanding of self-permission could significantly benefit the psychological well-being of many people who do not allow themselves to thrive...|$|E
40|$|The {{investment}} model (2003) {{has been}} widely used in romantic relationship studies but rarely in an intercultural context. This study tests the investment model by examining Finnish-Chinese couples’ self-perceptions of commitment level and relationship maintenance behaviors. A qualitative research method with deductive thematic analysis approach is applied. This study finds that Finnish-Chinese couples have relatively high level of commitment. They tend to remain in their relationships, to actively derogate alternatives, to sacrifice self-welfare for <b>gratifying</b> <b>relationship</b> well-being, to perceive their relationships as good and healthy and to choose relationship constructive responses under dissatisfying situations. These findings show that the commitment are positively associated with the relationship maintenance behaviors which consists with the investment model. It is {{also found that the}} reward-cost frame influences Finnish-Chinese couples’ willingness to sacrifice. Moreover, communication is the most appreciated strategy for them to confront conflicts. Two characteristics of their communication are found which are development and negotiation. Finally, the ways in which culture may have an effect on Finnish-Chinese couples’ perceptions of commitment are discussed...|$|E

40|$|In her thirty-four {{years of}} service to the University of California, Santa Cruz, Carol Freeman earned the affection and admiration of students, faculty, staff and administrators for her {{exceptional}} teaching skill, administrative acumen and visionary devotion to undergraduate education. She was awarded the UCSC Alumni Award for Distinguished Teaching in 1996 and the Dean McHenry Award for Distinguished Leadership in the Academic Senate in 2012. In nominating Freeman for the McHenry honor, the Senate’s Committee on Committees noted that “Senior Lecturer with Security of Employment Emerita Carol Freeman … personifies the ideals of collegial, creative, principled service these awards recognize,” and praised the “persistence, dedication, commitment, and above all, excellence” that characterized every aspect of her multifaceted and “powerfully influential” work for the university. As the founding coordinator and eventually chair of the Campus Writing Program, Freeman shaped it into a vibrant, nationally acclaimed undergraduate writing program with a rich lower- and upper-division curriculum—characterized by a 1985 external review committee as a “campus treasure. ” Emphasizing the hiring and retention of a diverse, collegial and dedicated core faculty of lecturers who took part in both pedagogical and administrative aspects of campus writing instruction, she deftly shepherded the program through decades of campus administrative changes and financial challenges—repeatedly inventing constructive responses to potentially devastating setbacks, including a round of budget cuts that wiped out most peer tutoring and almost the entire upper-division curriculum. In this oral history, conducted over the course of three interviews in late October and early November, 2012, Freeman talks about the emergence in the 1970 s of new approaches to writing pedagogy that inspired her enthusiasm and shaped her approaches to teaching; about the maturation of the Writing Program’s mission, goals and activities; about the often delicate negotiations, and sometimes <b>gratifying</b> <b>relationships,</b> with academic and administrative colleagues on which the program’s continuing existence relied; and about her commitment to providing sustainable working conditions and professional respectability for university writing teachers. ...|$|R

Purpose of Study: Our study analyzes: (1) how adolescents understand the process of becoming an adult in Romania, and what criteria they have for it; (2) explore how a combination of psychological factors can interact with school adaptation to {{set the stage for the}} transition to adulthood. Research Methods: Sample consisted of 874 adolescents. The outcomes were measured using a questionnaire based on Arnett's survey and SSP (Bowen, Rose & Bowen, 2005), which was completed and adapted in Romania by the research team. Findings: Results indicate that 1) Romanian adolescents at the end of high-school consider autonomy on the top of their rankings to define adulthood, in similar ways as their fellows in the US; in preparation of adulthood, most important criteria include: financial and personal independence from parents. On the other hand, there are many differences in the rankings of these groups, mostly in the perceptions of future roles; (2) individual cognitions, school adaptation and educational attainment, hope in the future and overall quality of life are important for the transition period. Conclusions: The specific stage of emergence from adolescence to young adulthood requires a reexamination of its factors, taking into consideration the interaction of social cognitions and optimism, about future career, relationships, finances...|$|R
40|$|This study {{investigated}} the factors that affect the job satisfaction of principals of previously disadvantaged secondary schools in the North West Province. The aims {{of the study were}} to determine empirically, through quantitative and qualitative means, the factors that influence the job satisfaction of the principals, and to make recommendations of ways to improve their job satisfaction. In the quantitative phase the research design was a survey. Data were collected from a purposefully selected sample of 30 principals of 30 secondary schools conveniently situated and accessible, in rural villages and townships. Thereafter a phenomenological approach was used to select eight principals from the same sample. The aim was to, by means of interviews, find clarity on the trends observed in the quantitative phase. The researcher purposefully selected participants representing a maximum variation regarding gender, geographical location, and years of experience as a teacher or a headmaster. The results indicated that the factors that enhanced the job satisfaction of the selected principals related to the nature of their work {{in the sense that it}} was stimulating, important and varied. Their interpersonal <b>relationships</b> were also <b>gratifying.</b> These <b>relationships</b> referred to cooperative staff, appreciative colleagues and supervisors, well-behaved learners, and supportive parents. Specific factors also brought about job dissatisfaction. In particular, the majority of the principals were frustrated with poor management on the part of the Department of Education. This was linked to a lack of autonomy of the principals, excessive bureaucracy, and poor policies. The principals believed that these policies exacerbated the problems they already had with ill-disciplined learners, the poor work ethics of some educators, unsatisfactory matriculation results, pitiable physical working conditions, and uninvolved parents. Results from the research also showed that the principals thought their workloads were not aligned to their salaries, and that reward systems were needed. Recommendations to enhance the job satisfaction of the principals of the identified secondary schools were made to the SGB and other school managers, as well as to the Department of Education, and recommendations for future research were also put forward. Finally, a number of limitations of the study were pointed out. Educational StudiesD. Ed. (Education Management...|$|R
40|$|In lieu of an abstract, {{below is}} the essay 2 ̆ 7 s first paragraph. 2 ̆ 2 The {{parent and child}} {{relationship}} is a very unique and interesting one. It is also a topic that has been highly researched and written on. It {{is one that has}} puzzled many since such a relationship was first established and it has been exemplified time and time again in various religious texts. Why is this relationship so unique and different than others? Why is it one that demands so much attention? Why is it important enough to have religious significance in the Bible, the Quran, the Torah and many other religious texts? The reason is simple, the parent child relationship, whether it be father or son, mother or daughter, is one that is necessary for human sustenance. In other words without an adequate parent child relationship, neither party can hope to live fulfilling lives. This is precisely the reason why this connection is so heavily emphasized in various religious texts and documents (story of the Prodigal son and Abraham and his son). And adequate parent child relationship is thus a template for a more fulfilling human divine relationship. In other words, these two relationships feed off of each other. An ample parent child relationship sets the precedence for a pleasing human divine relationship {{in the same way that}} the human divine relationship sets precedence for a <b>gratifying</b> parent child <b>relationship.</b> There are many things to be learned from the investigation of such a correlation; and in turn this analysis can lead to the revealing of many religious and worldly truths. These truths then help one to become more spiritual and strengthen his or her connection with the divine. 2 ̆...|$|R
40|$|Game is an {{essential}} aspect of a child's life and is a necessary activity {{for the creation of}} a <b>gratifying</b> and pleasant <b>relationship</b> towards life and the surrounding world. In general, playing with friends is an important activity at any age. Among games, an important role is played by sports practiced for recreational purpose, e. g. football, basketball, rugby, but for people with disabilities, a direct participation is often too difficult or impossible. Assistive technology has allowed or made more accessible participation to some games to users with disabilities, for example, videogames, but the gap is still very important for real sports. The idea at the base of ElGo is that a person with disabilities, in particular a child or a teenager, can live the game of football thanks to the possibility of controlling an electromechanic device having the role of a goalkeeper in a football match. Main Content. ElGo is composed by a dummy moving on an horizontal linear guide, placed near the goal line, and remotely controlled by the user standing in proximity of the field. The dummy is moved by an electrical motor operated by a motor control device and powered by rechargeable batteries, so that ElGo can be used also where no mains power system is available. The system is controlled by an electronic device, which also manages the user interface. ElGo can be operated in three modes: with only two switches (one for dummy right movement and one for left movement), with four switches (two speed grades for both directions) and with an analogue interface such as a linear potentiometer or a proportional joystick. Results. The presented device is currently developed as a prototype at the University of Pisa by a team composed of Professors, Graduates and Students of Electronic and Mechanical Engineering. The electronic subsystem has been almost completely realized, mechanical elements have been almost completely designed and the relevant procurement phase has started. Conclusion. ElGo expands the boundary of game for disabled people towards new experiences together with able-bodied persons; in this way people with disabilities will be able to participate to a very popular game such as football, not only using a videogame console but in a more physical and active way...|$|R
40|$|Thesis (Ph. D.) [...] Boston UniversityThe {{relationship}} between counselor and patient {{has emerged as}} one of the primary curative resources in both psychotherapy and pastoral counseling. This dissertation compares the therapeutic relationship in psychotherapy and pastoral counseling with respect to its nature, goals and functions. A specific focus of this comparison is to determine the impact of the religious concerns of pastoral counseling on the relationship. The literature of six major approaches in psychotherapy and that of pastoral counseling was examined to compare the relationships, determine goals and functions of each. Further comparison was made by means of a modified Q-sort technique in which eleven pastoral counselors participated. An Interview Analysis Schedule was constructed on the basis of these data and 44 hospital pastoral interviews were examined by four judges to determine the quality of the relationship, the extent to which goals were achieved and functions fulfilled in interviews judged to be good or poor. The following results were obtained: (a) Extensive agreement was found as to the nature of the ideal therapeutic relationship among psychotherapists and pastoral counselors when the dimensions of communication, security factors, and status of the therapist were considered. Pastoral counselors placed 29 of 45 Q-sort items into identical categories as did the psychotherapists and varying only one out of five categories in sorting the remaining 16 items. (b) The pastoral counseling relationship was found to consist of five dimensions including (i) communication, (ii) status, (iii) trust, (iv) emotional distance, and (v) religion. (c) Four major goals common to all therapies but with varying emphases were found: (i) personal integration, (ii) self-acceptance, (iii) restoration of wholesome interpersonal relationships and, (iv) finding new meaning for life. Pastoral counseling relationships hold these same goals but with specifically religious emphases. (d) Three major functions of the therapeutic and pastoral counseling relationships emerged: (i) the <b>relationship</b> <b>gratifies</b> basic needs, (ii) serves as a corrective experience and model for interpersonal relationships and, (iii) as an occasion for social learning. (e) The religious dimension of pastoral counseling took precedence over the others, followed by communication, trust, status and emotional distance, in that order, supporting the major hypothesis of the study. (f) Pastoral hospital interviews which were known to be "good" and were so rated by the four judges were scored consistently higher in the dimensions of trust, religion, status and communication than were hospital interviews known to be "poor", thus fulfilling the functions and achieving the goals of the relationship to a greater degree. Both "good" and "poor" interviews scored equally high in the emotional distance dimension. The following conclusions were drawn: (a) There is significant similarity between psychotherapeutic and pastoral counseling relationships, most marked between client-centered therapy and pastoral counseling. Pastoral counseling, however, clearly retains its religious orientation which effects the nature, goals and functions of the relationship. (b) The primary religious function of the pastoral counseling relationship is to bring about an awareness of the redemptive activity of God and to communicate the accentance and forgiveness of God, verbally and non-verbally. (c) Communication emerges as a central role of the pastor and as a primary factor in pastoral counseling, though it does not occur independently of the other dimensions. (d) On the basis of the interviews examined, the more nearly ideal the pastoral counseling relationship is, the more completely are the goals and functions of the relationship fulfilled. Further research into the nature and function of the pastoral counseling relationship is indicated in the following areas: (a) the counselee's expectations and experience in the pastoral counseling relationship; (b) the nature and effect of the symbolic role of the pastor in counseling; (c) the effect of the content of communication on the other dimensions of the relationship; (d) the function of the relationship in the parish setting; (e) the impact of the theological concepts of the pastor on the dimensions, goals and functions of the pastoral counseling relationship...|$|R
40|$|The {{field of}} {{marketing}} communications continues to change rapidly {{as a consequence}} of advancing technology, changing consumer behaviour, and fragmentation of media. A key aspect of marketing communication is to understand how audiences are likely to interact with messages. This study investigates the role attractiveness plays in facilitating this connection. Source attractiveness becomes critical to persuasive impact {{to the extent that the}} receiver is motivated to enhance their sense of self, social reputation, or <b>gratifying</b> role <b>relationships</b> by identifying with admired sources and formulating their attitudes. The study examines the dimensions of attractiveness, its advertising effectiveness, attitudes to personal care, fashion, technology, and nutritional products, and possible implications for public policy. It is proposed that gender, media, models, and culture influence perceptions of attractiveness which in turn has implications for advertising effectiveness, self evaluations of body image, and perceived benefits of attractiveness. The research involved an online survey with a final sample of 1111 participants within Australia. The sample was composed of 600 females and 511 males, from broad age groups, and from various Caucasian, Asian, African and Polynesian backgrounds. A structured questionnaire comprising existing, modified and new scales was the primary means of data collection. It consisted of a self-reported section and a perceptual section with images of models and products. The questionnaire was placed on a website and participants were given a link and instructions for online completion. All scales were assessed for internal consistency, construct validity, and were found to have acceptable psychometric properties. Modified scales were assessed firstly via exploratory factor analysis to examine the dimensionality of the constructs, and then via confirmatory factor analysis to assess all the scales for convergent and discriminant validity. Formative versus reflective measurement models were discussed and a framework for assessing reflective and formative models with theoretical and empirical considerations was examined. The study finds that beauty is a reflective measure and attractiveness is best conceptualised and operationalised as a formative measure. The research propositions were investigated by examining the direct relationships between variables via the use of multiple regressions. This was then augmented by an analysis of relationships through structural equation modelling to examine the direct, indirect and total effects of the independent variables on the dependant variables. Analysis of Variance (ANOVA) was also utilised as a test of measuring differences between groups within the population. The regression analyses supported the proposed relationships between Attractiveness, Media, Models, Culture, Attitude to products, and Benefits of attractiveness. Overall, the regression analysis indicated support for the conceptual model. Attractiveness was found to be a function of the culture of the observer, the influence on the observer of media and the stereotypes of models to which the observer is exposed. Significant relationships were found between attractiveness and culture, media and model influence. Additionally, significant differences were found between males and females in their perceptions of culture, media and model influence, and attitudes to personal care, fashion, technology and nutritional products, as associated with attractiveness. Self evaluation of body image was found to be a function of the culture of the observer, perceptions of attractiveness, the influence on the observer of media and the stereotypes of models to which the observer is exposed. Significant differences were found between people’s evaluation of themselves before and after exposure to models. However, males were more favourably disposed to female models that were females. Regression analysis also revealed a strong association between attitude to products and consumer cultural background, perceived attractiveness, self evaluation of body image, perceived benefits of attractiveness, and media and model influence. The study also explored whether there are significant differences in people perceived to have different combinations of beauty and attractiveness. This resulted in four groups. Some people are considered beautiful and attractive (HH) and others as not beautiful and not attractive (LL). However, the surprising finding was that there are people who are considered beautiful but not attractive (HL) and not beautiful but attractive (LH), suggesting that the two constructs are different. People who belong to these four groups were found to have different perceptions of benefits of attractiveness, self evaluations of body image, and influence of models. For male and female evaluators those perceived to be HH or LH were strongly associated with search for competitive advantage significantly more than HL and LL. For females, those perceived to be HH, HL or LH were strongly associated with search for social acceptance significantly more than LL. However, for males, those perceived to be HH or LH were strongly associated with search for social acceptance significantly more than HL and LL. The findings suggest that there are no differences between the four groups as evaluated by different genders in terms of their association with search for competitive advantage and social acceptance. Moderation was also utilised to explore a number of relationships. The results indicate that a number of factors describe boundary conditions under which specific relationships hold. Those factors were found to be gender, body image, acculturation, media influence, and influence of models. Gender was found to moderate the relationship between perceptions of attractiveness and advertising effectiveness. The degree of acculturation and media influence was found to moderate the relationship between perceptions of beauty and attitudes to personal care, fashion, technology and nutritional products. Media influence moderates the relationships between perceptions of attractiveness and attitude to personal care, fashion, and technology products. Body image and models portrayed in the media were found to moderate the relationship between perceptions of beauty and perceptions of attractiveness and attitude to personal care, fashion, technology and nutritional products. The degree of acculturation and media influence moderate the relationship between perceptions of beauty and body image post exposure to images of models. Media influence moderates the relationship between perceptions of beauty and social acceptance. Models portrayed in the media moderates the relationship between perceptions of attractiveness and social acceptance. Body image and models portrayed in the media moderate the relationship between perceptions of beauty and perceived benefits of attractiveness. Results of the structural equation modelling indicated that perceptions of attractiveness was found to have a significant positive direct effect on attitude to fashion and technology products, model and underwear combination, body image, competitive advantage, and social acceptance. An interesting finding is the significant negative direct effect on attitude to nutritional products and influence of models. Perceptions of beauty was found to have a significant positive direct effect on attitude to personal care and nutritional products, competitive advantage, social acceptance, and influence of models. However, it was found to have a significant negative direct effect on body image. Media influence was found to have a significant positive direct effect on perceived advantage of attractiveness, social acceptance, attitude to nutritional products, and models. However, a significant negative effect was found on body image. The influence of models was found to have a significant positive direct effect on attitude to personal care, fashion, and technology products. Ethnic identity was found to have a significant positive direct effect on personal care, fashion, and nutritional products, perceived advantage of attractiveness, social acceptance, and model influence. An interesting finding was that the predicted direction for technology products was positive however a significant negative effect was found. Additionally, a significant negative direct effect was found on body image. This thesis makes a number of academic, social and business contributions: • Attractiveness Research: The differences identified in perception of beauty and attractiveness have implications for consumption of personal care and fashion products, technology products, and nutritional products. • Contributions to Methodology: The impact of common method variance was examined on the magnitude and significance of correlations and the results indicated that CMV was not a problem. Additionally, a photo shoot was conducted with ten models and two product categories (male and female underwear and perfume). Advertisements with model and product combinations were designed to explore male and female perceptions of beauty and attractiveness and to examine advertising effectiveness. The study examined the whole physical person rather than just faces as is typical of beauty studies. • Implications of the Study for Public Policy: This study urged the need for policy-makers to promote body image and attractiveness in framing their public policies that will positively impact on the health and nutrition of people across all age groups. • Implications for Business: This research explored perceptions of attractiveness, consumer attitudes to personal care, fashion, technology and nutritional products, and the effects of advertising on body image. These insights are crucial in order to communicate appropriately to the designated market segments and to facilitate messages that resonate with the intended audiences...|$|R
