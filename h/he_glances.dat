500|$|When Liz learns from Kenneth that NBC {{will have}} Green Week, she says [...] "Oh brother, are they {{actually}} {{going to do something}} this year or are they just going to put that stupid green peacock {{in the corner of the}} screen?", a reference to the NBC peacock symbol having a green logo design during Green Week. As a result of what Liz said, Kenneth breaks the fourth wall, a term used when a character in a television show, film or on stage directly addresses the audience, when <b>he</b> <b>glances</b> down at the logo.|$|E
500|$|Elvis Is Back! {{represented}} a new sound for Presley; it moved him further toward pop music, a direction {{he continued to}} take {{over much of the}} decade. [...] The album features a mixture of genres, including rock, rhythm and blues and pop ballads. Critics generally agreed that Presley had acquired a [...] "deeper, harder voice quality", and said his interpretations were [...] "increasingly sophisticated". The album includes a variety of material; Presley and the session musicians, known as [...] "The Nashville A-Team", had the benefit of recording equipment that was state-of-the-art for its time. Elvis Is Back! was the first Presley album to be released in stereo. The album's front cover shows Presley {{standing in front of a}} blue stage curtain, dressed in an Army trench coat and smiling as <b>he</b> <b>glances</b> to his left. The back cover features an image of Presley grinning; he is dressed in an Army regulation fatigue jacket and cap. The inside of the gatefold cover features fifteen photographs of Presley taken at various times during his Army service.|$|E
2500|$|On {{the fifth}} anniversary of Columbine, the FBI's lead Columbine {{investigator}} and several psychiatrists published their conclusions in a news article. These conclusions stated Harris was a clinical psychopath, whereas Klebold was depressive. Harris had been the mastermind, having a messianic-level superiority complex, and had hoped to demonstrate his superiority to the world, whereas Klebold, having repeatedly documented his desires to commit suicide in his diaries—particularly due to his lack of success with women—had primarily participated in the massacre as a means to simply end his life. Dr. Dwayne Fuselier, the supervisor in charge of the Columbine investigation, would later remark: [...] "I believe Eric went to the school to kill and didn't care if he died, while Dylan wanted to die and didn't care if others died as well." [...] Klebold's final remark in the videotape he and Harris made shortly before their attack upon Columbine High School is a resigned statement made as <b>he</b> <b>glances</b> away from the camera: [...] "Just know I'm going to a better place. I didn't like life too much." ...|$|E

2500|$|Benny {{also was}} caricatured in several Warner Brothers {{cartoons}} including Daffy Duck and the Dinosaur (1939, as Casper the Caveman), I Love to Singa, Slap Happy Pappy, and Goofy Groceries (1936, 1940, and 1941 respectively, as Jack Bunny), Malibu Beach Party (1940, as himself), and The Mouse that Jack Built (1959). The last {{of these is}} probably the most memorable: Robert McKimson engaged Benny and his actual cast (Mary Livingstone, Eddie Anderson, and Don Wilson) to do the voices for the mouse versions of their characters, with Mel Blanc—the usual Warner Brothers cartoon voicemeister—reprising his old vocal turn as the always-aging Maxwell, always a phat-phat-bang! away from collapse. In the cartoon, Benny and Livingstone agree to spend their anniversary at the Kit-Kat Club, which they discover the hard way is inside the mouth of a live cat. Before the cat can devour the mice, Benny himself awakens from his dream, then shakes his head, smiles wryly, and mutters, [...] "Imagine, me and Mary as little mice." [...] Then, <b>he</b> <b>glances</b> toward the cat lying on a throw rug in a corner and sees his and Livingstone's cartoon alter egos scampering out of the cat's mouth. The cartoon ends with a classic Benny look of befuddlement. It was rumored that Benny requested that, in lieu of monetary compensation, he receive a copy of the finished film.|$|E
2500|$|While at Fort Myer, Virginia Emory {{acted as}} a {{correspondent}} for the Baltimore Sun. His series of five articles, entitled [...] "Reports from a Rookie" [...] and carrying his byline, appeared {{from time to time in}} the Sun, and explained many details of camp life and the rigors of military training of the day. In his first such report, published on May 20, 1917, Emory wrote, [...] "One coming to camp is struck, instantly, by the type of men Uncle Sam has taken under his care for the next three months, and to whom he will entrust the training of the first army of 500,000. There are quite a number of men between the ages of 30 and 40, but the great majority are from 20 to 30. They are all fine, upstanding fellows, and most of them have had college educations. Many of the men are married and many were doing well in civil life before coming here. They fully appreciated what it would mean for a man to leave his family, friends and business for an indefinite period, and it makes a fellow feel proud of being an American when <b>he</b> <b>glances</b> about and thinks for a moment of the sacrifices voluntarily assumed by the 2,500 men here and the 38,000 men at the other training camps." ...|$|E

6000|$|He {{does not}} seem to notice who is waiting on him to-night, but {{inclines}} his head slightly to whoever it is, as she takes her place {{at the back of his}} chair. LADY MARY respectfully places the menu-shell before him, and <b>he</b> <b>glances</b> at it.) ...|$|E

60|$|The {{burst of}} triumph {{in which she}} thanks him does not escape the notice of the single buffer of an easy temper living idly on his means. <b>He</b> <b>glances</b> at her; clasps his hands behind him, as the wont of such buffers is; and lounges along the echoing Precincts at her side.|$|E
6000|$|GEORGE PINDAR, in {{the uniform}} of a first {{lieutenant}} of the army, [...] enters by the doorway, upper right.

6000|$|Doctor H.'s face {{does indeed}} wear a knowing look.

6000|$|There is {{one species}} of egotism which is truly disgusting; not that which {{leads us to}} {{communicate}} our feelings to others, but that which would reduce the feelings of others to an identity with our own. The Atheist, who exclaims [...] "pshaw!" [...] when <b>he</b> <b>glances</b> {{his eye on the}} praises of Deity, is an Egotist; an old man, when he speaks contemptuously of love-verses, is an Egotist; and your sleek favourites of Fortune are Egotists, when they condemn all [...] "melancholy discontented" [...] verses.|$|E

60|$|This pleasantry so tickles Mr. Smallweed that he laughs, {{long and}} low, before the fire. But ever while he laughs, <b>he</b> <b>glances</b> over his paralytic {{shoulder}} at Mr. George and eagerly watches {{him as he}} unlocks the padlock of a homely cupboard at the distant end of the gallery, looks here and there upon the higher shelves, and ultimately takes something out with a rustling of paper, folds it, {{and puts it in}} his breast. Then Judy pokes Mr. Smallweed once, and Mr. Smallweed pokes Judy once.|$|E
6000|$|NEWTE. I said to myself--[His eye catches Bennet; he stops.] Ah, thanks. [He gives Bennet {{his hat and}} stick, but Bennet {{does not}} seem satisfied. He has taken from the table a small china tray. This he is holding out to Newte, evidently for Newte to put {{something}} in it. But what? Newte is puzzled, <b>he</b> <b>glances</b> at Fanny. The idea strikes him that perhaps it is a tip Bennet is waiting for. It seems odd, but if it be the custom--he puts {{his hand to his}} trousers pocket.] ...|$|E
6000|$|Hâjî Abdû cites Plato and Aristotle, {{as usual}} with Eastern songsters, who delight in Mantik (logic). Here {{he appears to}} mean that a false {{proposition}} is as real a proposition as one that is true. Faith moves mountains and Manet immota fides are evidently quotations. He derides {{the teaching of the}} First Council of the Vatican (cap. v.), all the faithful are little children listening to the voice of Saint Peter, who is the Prince of the Apostles. <b>He</b> <b>glances</b> at the fancy of certain modern physicists, devotion is a definite molecular change in the convolution of grey pulp. He notices with contumely the riddle of which Milton speaks so glibly, where the Dialoguists, ...|$|E
