5|$|Adult Eurasian rock pipits <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>complete</b> moult in August–September, {{at which}} time juveniles replace their body and some wing covert feathers, giving them an {{appearance}} very like the adults. From late January to early March there is a partial moult and individually variable moult of some body and wing covert feathers, and sometimes the central tail feathers.|$|E
5|$|Adults <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>complete</b> moult after {{breeding}} {{which takes}} about 80 days, starting from late May onwards and finishing by late September. The moult period for Siberian birds is more compressed, running from June to mid-September. Fledged juveniles moult {{some of their}} wing coverts when they are about eight weeks old.|$|E
5|$|After breeding, adults <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>complete</b> moult {{which takes}} at least eight weeks; males acquire more yellow in the plumage each time they moult. Juveniles have a partial moult not long after fledging, {{replacing}} the head, body and some covert feathers.|$|E

5|$|Juveniles moult their head, {{body and}} some wing {{feathers}} {{a few weeks}} after fledging, and adults <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>complete</b> moult after breeding. In both cases, if the process is not complete by the time of migration it is suspended and completed on the wintering grounds.|$|E

5|$|A level ends {{when all}} of the point-scoring objects are gone - either lost down the drain, cleaned by sponges/brushes, eaten by roaches, or absorbed by the bubble. At this point, if the bubble is large enough to <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>complete</b> face, the player moves on to the next level; otherwise, one life is lost and the level must be replayed. In addition, {{whenever}} the bubble has a face, the drain flashes green, giving the player a chance to enter it and skip the next level. Entering the drain while the bubble is too small costs one life.|$|E
5|$|Blackcaps <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>complete</b> moult {{in their}} {{breeding}} areas in August and September prior to migration. Some birds, typically those migrating the greatest distances, have a further partial moult between December and March. Juveniles replace their loosely structured body feathers with adult plumage, starting earlier, but taking longer to complete, than the adults. Blackcaps breeding {{in the north}} of the range have an earlier and shorter post-juvenile moult than those further south, and cross-breeding of captive birds shows that the timing is genetically controlled.|$|E

Liberty Property Trust also unveiled another redesign {{of the building}} and its new name, the Comcast Center. The now , 58-story Comcast Center would no longer have a pyramid top and would <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>complete</b> glass facade. The architectural model was created by Richard Tenguerian.|$|E

5|$|The soft, dense {{feathers}} {{are kept}} in good condition by preening. The red waxy tips are the extended and flattened ends of feather shafts, pigmented with astaxanthin and enclosed in a transparent sheath. A study of the cedar waxwings showed that the red tips are few or absent until {{the third year of}} life for that related species. All adult waxwings <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>complete</b> moult annually between August and January. Juveniles moult at the same time but retain their flight and some other wing feathers.|$|E
5|$|Adult great spotted {{woodpeckers}} <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>complete</b> moult {{after the}} breeding season which takes about 120days. Northern D. m. major starts its moult from mid-June to late July and finishes in October or November, temperate races like D. m. pinetorum are earlier, commencing in early June to mid-July and completing in mid-September to late October, and southern D. m. hispanicus starts late May or June and finishes {{as early as}} August. Juveniles have a partial moult, retaining some of the wing coverts but replacing body, tail and primary feathers. This moult to near-adult plumage starts from late May to early August and finishes from mid-September to late November, timing varying with latitude as with the adults.|$|E
5|$|On January 8, 1977, McLaughlin {{signed with}} the Seattle Mariners. On April 1, 1977, the Mariners loaned him to the Nuevo Laredo Mexican League franchise. At the time, the Mariners did not <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>complete</b> minor league organization. In the Mexican League that season, McLaughlin {{compiled}} a record of 18–13 with a 1.84 ERA and 221 strikeouts as his team, the Tecolotes, won the league championship. On September 11, 1977, he was returned to the Mariners. McLaughlin made his Major League Baseball (MLB) debut on September 18, against the Kansas City Royals at Kaufman Stadium. In 1 innings pitched, he gave-up five hits, four runs (all earned), and struck out one in his only major league appearance that season.|$|E

Kyousuke gives Riki and Rin the task of going around school to find more members to join, preferably girls so as not to leave Rin the lone girl. Riki finds five girls his age willing to help him out: Komari Kamikita, Haruka Saigusa, Kudryavka Noumi, Yuiko Kurugaya, and Mio Nishizono; three other girls Riki meets are Kanata Futaki, Sasami Sasasegawa, and Saya Tokido. Throughout the game, Riki hangs out with these girls and learns more about them.|$|E
5|$|Bubbles is {{an action}} game with puzzle {{elements}} where the player controls the protagonist, a soap bubble, from a top-down perspective. The {{object is to}} clean a kitchen sink by maneuvering over ants, crumbs, and grease spots to absorb them before they slide into the drain. As the bubble absorbs more objects, it grows in size, eventually acquiring first eyes and then a smiling mouth. At the same time, sponges and scrub brushes slowly move around the sink, cleaning {{it on their own}} in competition with the player. Touching either of these enemies costs a player one life unless the bubble is large enough to <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>complete</b> face. In this case, the enemy will be knocked away and the bubble will shrink. Sponges and brushes can be knocked into the drain for bonus points, eliminating them from play. Two other enemies in the sink are stationary razor blades and roaches that crawl out of the drain. Contact with a blade is always fatal, while the bubble can safely touch the roach only while carrying a broom, which will kill the roach with one hit. The broom can be acquired by running over a cleaning lady who appears in the sink from time to time.|$|E

In 1943, SR 20 was shifted off of US 411/SR 61 to replace the old SR 20 Spur and SR 113's routing east of Cartersville. By the end of 1946, the Bartow County portion of the segment from Dallas to Cartersville <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>completed</b> hard surface. <b>A</b> year or two later, the southern branch of SR 8 was redesignated as SR 8 Alternate.|$|R

40|$|The {{computer}} program SnapPea can approximate {{whether or not}} a three manifold whose boundary consists of tori <b>has</b> <b>a</b> <b>complete</b> hyperbolic structure, but it can not prove conclusively that this is so. This article provides a method for proving that such <b>a</b> manifold <b>has</b> <b>a</b> <b>complete</b> hyperbolic structure based on the approximations of SNAP, a program that includes the functionality of SnapPea plus other features. The approximation is done by triangulating the manifold, identifying consistency and completeness equations with respect to this triangulation, and then trying to solve the system of equations using Newton's Method. This produces an approximate, not actual solution. The method developed here uses Kantorovich's theorem to prove that an actual solution exists, thereby assuring that the manifold <b>has</b> <b>a</b> <b>complete</b> hyperbolic structure. Using this, we can definitively prove that every manifold in the SnapPea cusped census <b>has</b> <b>a</b> <b>complete</b> hyperbolic structure.
