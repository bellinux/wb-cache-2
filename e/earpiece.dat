5|$|A ten-man tag team {{match was}} {{supposed}} to take place next, but it was canceled due to time constraints. The kayfabe reason given was that the heel team (Irwin R. Schyster, The Headshrinkers, Rick Martel and Jeff Jarrett) could not agree on who would be the team's captain for the match. Their opponents were scheduled to be the face team of the 1–2–3 Kid, Sparky Plugg, Tatanka and The Smoking Gunns. Bob Holly ("Sparky Plugg"), stated in his 2013 autobiography The Hardcore Truth that the timekeeper backstage repeatedly told the referee over his <b>earpiece</b> to end the ladder match, but Michaels and Ramon ignored him, and kept wrestling until officials were forced to cancel the tag team match.|$|E
5|$|Dick Rubin {{handled the}} film's props, {{and set up}} a {{makeshift}} office in the corner of stage 9 throughout production. Rubin's philosophy as property master was that nearly every actor or extra ought to have something in their hands. As such, Rubin devised and fabricated about 350 props for the film, 55 of which were used in the San Francisco tram scene alone. Many of the props were updated designs of items previously seen in the television series, such as phasers and handheld communicators. The only prop that remained from the original television series was Uhura's wireless <b>earpiece,</b> which Nichols specifically requested {{on the first day of}} shooting (and all the production crew save those who had worked on the television show had forgotten about). The new phaser was entirely self-contained, with its own circuitry, batteries, and four blinking lights. The prop came with a hefty $4000 price tag; to save money, the lights were dropped, reducing the size of the phaser by a third. A total of 15 of the devices were made for the film. The communicators were radically altered, as by the 1970s the micro-miniaturization of electronics convinced Roddenberry that the bulky handheld devices of the television series were no longer believable. A wrist-based design was decided upon, with the provision that it look far different from the watch Dick Tracy had been using for decades previous. Two hundred communicators were fashioned, but only a few were the $3500 top models, used for close-ups of the device in action. Most of the props were made from plastic, as Rubin thought that in the future man-made materials would be used almost exclusively.|$|E
25|$|Headphones {{originated}} from the telephone receiver <b>earpiece,</b> {{and were the}} only way to listen to electrical audio signals before amplifiers were developed. The first truly successful set was developed in 1910 by Nathaniel Baldwin, who made them by hand in his kitchen and sold them to the United States Navy.|$|E
25|$|Stethoscopes {{usually have}} rubber <b>earpieces,</b> which aid comfort {{and create a}} seal with the ear, {{improving}} the acoustic function of the device. Stethoscopes can be modified by replacing the standard <b>earpieces</b> with moulded versions, which improve comfort and transmission of sound. Moulded <b>earpieces</b> can be cast by an audiologist or made by the stethoscope user from a kit.|$|R

25|$|At the 1999 World Cup, Cronje {{finished}} with 98 runs at 12.25 as South Africa were eliminated after the famous tied semi-final against Australia at Edgbaston. In the first match {{of the tournament}} versus India, Cronje came onto the field with an <b>earpiece</b> wired to coach Bob Woolmer, but at the first drinks break match referee Talat Ali ordered him to remove it.|$|E
25|$|Woolmer {{was known}} for his {{progressive}} coaching techniques. He is credited with making the reverse sweep a more popular shot for batsmen in the 1990s, as well as being {{one of the first to}} use computer analysis, and trying to adapt the knowledge of goalkeepers to wicketkeepers in cricket. He later attracted attention at the 1999 World Cup by communicating with his captain Hansie Cronje with an <b>earpiece</b> during matches. The practice was later banned.|$|E
25|$|Elliptic Labs {{software}} suite delivers gesture and proximity functions by re-using the existing <b>earpiece</b> and microphone, previously {{used only for}} audio. Ultrasound signals sent through the air from speakers integrated in smartphones and tablets bounce against a hand/object/head and are recorded by microphones, also integrated in these devices. In this way, Elliptic Labs' technology recognizes your hand gestures and uses them to move objects on a screen, similarly to the way bats use echolocation to navigate.|$|E

25|$|In the 2015 documentary, Listen To Me Marlon, Brando {{claims to}} have rewritten most of the script. This would be Brando's last great film. He would begin making poorer, more outlandish {{character}} choices, and being fed lines through an <b>earpiece.</b> Whether Brando really did save the film, after this he really {{would be difficult to}} work with, not out of technique, but out of laziness. Brando admits that his heart was no longer in it for the most part at this point in his career and with his family issues, personal problems, and social issues.|$|E
25|$|A headset is a {{headphone}} {{combined with}} a microphone. Headsets provide the equivalent functionality of a telephone handset with hands-free operation. Among applications for headsets, besides telephone use, are aviation, theatre or television studio intercom systems, and console or PC gaming. Headsets are made with either a single-earpiece (mono) or a double-earpiece (mono to both ears or stereo). The microphone arm of headsets is either an external microphone type where the microphone is held {{in front of the}} user's mouth, or a voicetube type where the microphone is housed in the <b>earpiece</b> and speech reaches it by means of a hollow tube.|$|E
25|$|Special Agents and Special Officers of the Secret Service wear attire that is {{appropriate}} for their surroundings, in order to blend {{in as much as}} possible. In most circumstances, the attire of a close protection shift is a conservative suit, but it can range from a tuxedo to casual clothing as required by the environment. Stereotypically Secret Service agents are often portrayed wearing reflective sunglasses and a communication <b>earpiece.</b> Often their attire is customized to conceal the wide array of equipment worn in service. Agents wear a distinctive lapel pin that identifies them to other agents.|$|E

25|$|It {{could be}} argued that radio was born in Cornwall. In 1901 at Poldhu on The Lizard, Guglielmo Marconi made his first trans-atlantic radio transmission. It would be another twenty six years before the BBC National Programme was audible in Cornwall, from the then new long wave {{transmitter}} at Daventry, although BBC transmissions began in 1922. The transmission, coming a long way from Cornwall, (from the centre of the English Midlands), was crackly and barely audible at night-time, and it was a solitary listening experience, as sets were only equipped with a single <b>earpiece,</b> and not a loudspeaker.|$|E
25|$|Throughout {{the first}} 35 minutes, there were {{technical}} difficulties with the Fort Worth TV relay {{as well as}} with the phone link MacNeil was using to report from the hospital. When the coverage began, McGee was waiting for MacNeil to call in with information. While Ryan and Huntley were recounting the information, McGee got MacNeil on the line and told him to recount chronologically what happened. However, NBC was using a studio that wasn't equipped to patch calls through to the air and thus only McGee could hear MacNeil. While the studio crew worked on a solution, McGee improvised and told MacNeil to relay the information in fragments, which he would then repeat for the audience. While they were talking, Huntley was handed a speaker from off camera and took the receiver from McGee so he could attach it to the <b>earpiece,</b> this enabling MacNeil to be heard. However, by that time there was no further information to report; MacNeil had a medical student from Parkland hold the phone line for him so that he could return to the emergency ward for the latest developments.|$|E
25|$|The Malaysian Army {{currently}} has a soldier modernisation programme called the Future Soldier System. Under the FSS, The Malaysian Army plans to equip all soldiers with Personal Protection Equipment (PPE) such as Kevlar helmets, Kevlar vests, Oakley goggles and ear protection equipment. The programme also includes arming all the standard issue M4 carbines with SOPMOD kits, {{as well as}} equipping soldiers with a Glock series pistol. Sapura, a Malaysian electronics company, is offering their SAKTI soldier system concept via work in three areas: Head Sub-System (HSS), Body Sub-System (BSS) and Weapon Sub-System (WSS). The HSS consists of a Helmet–Mounted Micro Camera and night vision capability with a data output, helmet-mounted display and <b>earpiece</b> and microphone; the WSS consists of a Rifle Control Unit consisting of a five-button wireless controller for one handed use with key features including push to talk for the radio, switching the HMD on and off, turning the HMD brightness {{up and down as}} well as video transmission to friendly forces. The BSS consists of a controller system, energy unit with a power pack for the communication interface, micro-camera and HMD with a single polymer lithium ion battery for up to ten hours of operation; a communications interface for secure IP based radio which from the image is a Thales St@rmille radio and finally a navigation unit with a display for blue force tracking and situational awareness, colour digital mapping and terrain and urban profile analysis. The system displayed is visually similar to the Kord Defence SmartGrip RIC developed in partnership with Thales Australia.|$|E

Future-Abe sedates Original-Abe (so {{he will never}} conduct the initial time travel experiment), and meets Original-Aaron at a park bench (so as to dissuade him), but finds that Future-Aaron has gotten there first (armed with pre-recordings of the past conversations, and an unobtrusive <b>earpiece),</b> having brought a disassembled [...] "third failsafe box" [...] four days back with his own body. [...] Future-Abe faints at this revelation, overcome by shock and fatigue.|$|E
500|$|Bird {{designed}} {{and used a}} flexible tube stethoscope in June 1840, {{and in the same}} year he published the first description of such an instrument. [...] In his paper he mentions an instrument already in use by other physicians (Drs. Clendinning and Stroud), which he describes as the [...] "snake ear trumpet". [...] He thought this instrument had some severe technical faults; in particular, its great length led to poor performance. [...] The form of Bird's invention is similar to the modern stethoscope, except that it has only one <b>earpiece.</b> [...] An ill-tempered exchange of letters occurred in the London Medical Gazette between another physician, John Burne, and Bird. [...] Burne claimed that he also used the same instrument as Clendinning and Stroud and was offended that Bird had not mentioned him in his paper. [...] Burne, who worked at the Westminster Hospital, pointed with suspicion to the fact that Bird's brother Frederic also worked there. [...] In a reply full of anger and sarcasm, Bird pointed out that in his original paper he had already made clear that he claimed no credit for the earlier instrument.Burne, , p. 471, 11 June 1841Bird, , pp. 510–511, 18 June 1841Burne, [...] p. 590, 2 July 1841 [...] Bird found the flexible stethoscope convenient as it avoided uncomfortably leaning over patients (as would be required by a rigid stethoscope) and the <b>earpiece</b> could be passed to other doctors and students to listen. [...] It was particularly useful for Bird, with his severe rheumatism, as he could apply the stethoscope to the patient from a seated position.Wilks, p. 490Wilks and Bettany, pp. 246–247 ...|$|E

5000|$|Some images {{found in}} or near the SECC area may be of Red Horn, his companions, and his sons. Scattered {{throughout}} most of this area are relics of prosopic <b>earpieces,</b> which must have given the wearer an appearance strikingly like that of mythical Red Horn. Other artifacts, such as the bilobed arrow, may shed light on an obscure name held by Red Horn in his youth, [...] "He Who is Hit with Deer Lungs". Intricately carved effigy pipes have been recovered as well, one of which, nicknamed [...] "Big Boy", has been widely identified with Red Horn. There also exist numerous depictions of a raptorial bird whose head has many human features. James A. Brown has argued that this [...] "Birdman", who is often shown wearing prosopic <b>earpieces,</b> is also a form of Red Horn. Pictographs found in caves have also been related to Red Horn. Salzer contends that the scene of Panel 5 at the Gottschall Rockshelter represents Red Horn and his friends confronting the giants. At Picture Cave, discovered by Carol Diaz-Granados, there exists a pictograph the central figure of which wears prosopic <b>earpieces,</b> leading to the suggestion that he represents an early form of Red Horn.|$|R
50|$|The deerstalker {{is a type}} of hat {{associated}} with Sherlock Holmes and Elmer Fudd. Notable for its slight rain-brim to the front and back, with a camouflage checked twill pattern and fold-down <b>earpieces</b> for selective warmth or to raise when listening for deer.|$|R
500|$|The filming {{introduced}} {{a number of}} technical challenges, with the producer Adam Tandy explaining that the simultaneous singing and conversing made production particularly difficult: [...] "To record it all 'clean' and have options in the edit, that was technically hard on everybody." [...] Typically, karaoke scenes in television will see characters sing only the opening lines, {{but because of the}} format of Inside No. 9, the characters in [...] "Empty Orchestra" [...] sing the whole song. Each character sang a song, with the vocals recorded live. The actors wore an <b>earpiece</b> to listen to the music while singing; Howlett's, used so that she could feel the beat, was taped under her wig, and she was counted in by Outhwaite. Filming took a week, with days focussed on particular songs.|$|E

500|$|It {{took three}} months to produce, though pieces {{had been used in}} a large number of other {{projects}} prior to Gorilla. The [...] "fur" [...] of the suit is composed of knotted yak hairs. The exposed facial features are silicone, and are moved animatronically, through 27remote-controlled motors and several levers. Two technicians were needed, in addition to the actor inside the suit, to produce the range of motions displayed in the commercial. The suit was cooled by ice-water tubing and a handheld fan pointed at the mouth between takes. While much of the suit had existed prior to the project, several adaptations were made, including custom-made hands for the drum sequence, foam muscle around the chest and shoulders, a new styling for the pelt, and the addition of a gold tooth, grey hairs, and a studio <b>earpiece</b> to give a more [...] "wizened rock star" [...] appearance.|$|E
