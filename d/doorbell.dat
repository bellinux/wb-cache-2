5|$|The {{story begins}} with Aya {{returning}} home from a rough day at work. After relaxing on her bed, she receives {{a phone call from}} her father, who wants to have dinner with her; however, she declines by lying about still being at work. The narrator then reminisces about Aya's childhood and family life, particularly dwelling upon how her maturity and independence had created distance between her and her father, who is increasingly lonely yet happy for her. Later that night, Aya awakes to another phone call from her father. Having learned of Mii's death, she visits her father and has lunch with him, an experience that brings the two closer together. Aya later visits her father to see the new kitten he buys. At the same time, her mother rings the <b>doorbell</b> and the family is reunited, their happiness renewed.|$|E
25|$|A <b>doorbell</b> is a {{signaling}} device {{commonly found}} near a door. It commonly emits a ringing sound {{to alert the}} occupant of the building to a visitor's presence. The electric <b>doorbell</b> was invented by Joseph Henry in 1831.|$|E
25|$|The name {{may also}} be used for a {{character}} who never delivers a line, and thus any member of the stage crew might be filling in the role. For example, a person makes a delivery to a character onstage: the <b>doorbell</b> rings, the delivery is made, and the delivery carrier disappears, with no words spoken.|$|E

25|$|Stout {{was one of}} many American writers {{closely watched}} by J. Edgar Hoover's FBI. Hoover {{considered}} him an enemy of the bureau and either a Communist or a tool of Communist-dominated groups. Stout's leadership of the Authors League of America during the McCarthy era was particularly irksome to the FBI. About a third of Stout's FBI file is devoted to his 1965 novel The <b>Doorbell</b> Rang.|$|E
25|$|In 1977, Paramount Television filmed Nero Wolfe, an {{adaptation}} of Stout's novel The <b>Doorbell</b> Rang. Thayer David and Tom Mason starred as Nero Wolfe and Archie Goodwin; Anne Baxter costarred as Mrs. Rachel Bruner. Written and directed by Frank D. Gilroy, the made-for-TV movie was produced as a pilot for a possible upcoming series — but the film had not yet aired {{at the time of}} Thayer David's death in July 1978. Nero Wolfe was finally broadcast December 18, 1979, as an ABC-TV late show.|$|E
25|$|Doctor Vollmer — {{a medical}} doctor who is Wolfe's {{neighbor}} and friend. Wolfe calls upon Vollmer whenever a dead body is discovered, or medical attention is required, at the brownstone. In The Silent Speaker, Vollmer contrives an illness severe enough that Wolfe cannot be questioned or even seen by anyone. Vollmer examines Louis Rony's corpse for Wolfe in The Second Confession and acts as a go-between for Cramer and Archie in The <b>Doorbell</b> Rang. Vollmer's motivation, aside from friendship, is that Wolfe helped him out with a would-be blackmailer years ago.|$|E

25|$|As piezo energy {{harvesting}} {{has been investigated}} only since the late 1990s, it remains an emerging technology. Nevertheless, some interesting improvements were made with the self-powered electronic switch at INSA school of engineering, implemented by the spin-off Arveni. In 2006, the proof of concept of a battery-less wireless <b>doorbell</b> push button was created, and recently, a product showed that classical wireless wallswitch can be powered by a piezo harvester. Other industrial applications appeared between 2000 and 2005, to harvest energy from vibration and supply sensors for example, or to harvest energy from shock.|$|E
25|$|John Bosco narrates how Dominic came to {{his room}} one day and urged him to {{accompany}} him. He led Bosco through many streets to a block of flats, rang the <b>doorbell,</b> and at once, went away. When the door opened, John Bosco found that within, there was a dying man who was desperately asking for a priest to make his last confession. Later, John Bosco asked Dominic how he had known about that man. However, since the question made Dominic uncomfortable, John Bosco did not press the matter.|$|E
25|$|The <b>doorbell</b> rings, which Justin {{believes}} to be Rudi. He is {{all set to}} deny everything, {{but it is only}} Arabella, {{having only}} made it a few hundred yards instead of to Godalming. Micky, having warmed to Arabella, and moved by Paige's story of her accident, not to mention fear of his getting hurt too when Rudi returns, offers to take Arabella home in Rudi's favourite car, thereby setting Paige free. Justin gives Paige some money to get on her way, but by now he wants an escape from his own life. He persuades Paige to take him with her. They leave together, and the play ends just as Rudi's gangsters are trying to force their way through the door to a surprised Derek and Dee.|$|E

25|$|It is {{the center}} from which moral order emanates, and the details of its layout and its {{operations}} are signs of its stability. For forty years, Wolfe prepares menus with Fritz and pots orchids with Theodore. For forty years, Archie takes notes at his desk, the client sits in the red chair and the other principals distribute themselves in the yellow chairs, and Wolfe presides from his custom-made throne. For forty years, Inspector Cramer and Sergeant Purley Stebbins ring the <b>doorbell,</b> enter the office, and explode with indignation at Wolfe's intractability. The front room, the elevator, the three-foot globe — all persist in place through forty years of American history. … Like Holmes's 221B Baker Street, Wolfe's West Thirty-Fifth Street remains a fixed point in a turning world.|$|E
25|$|The <b>doorbell</b> rings, and Bart answers it. It is Milhouse, {{who takes}} Bart to a cave {{he has found}} in the woods, which is full of fireworks. Bart tests some, but accidentally sets fire to Dr. Nick's clinic. Bart and Milhouse hide in a {{building}} but are caught {{by the police and}} asked to help find the person selling the fireworks. Bart and Milhouse find Fat Tony and his henchmen, but when Tony realizes that Bart has a wire he chases the boys through the sewers until they emerge where Marge and Lisa are. Having been chased down the street, Bart and Milhouse get cornered. To save the boys, Marge throws Linguo at the gangsters and due to their bad grammar, the sparks from Linguo's body caused by the overload ignite the fireworks causing Linguo to explode.|$|E
25|$|In {{the early}} morning of 22 May 2013, a girlfriend {{of one of the}} sons left the house. At 6:40AM, Mrs. Haroková called the grammar school where she worked, saying that she had a bad {{headache}} and would take the day off. The police believe that she and two other victims were killed between this time and 8:00AM, which was the moment at which Mrs Haroková's wristwatch stopped. A post woman arrived at the door shortly before nine. The <b>doorbell</b> was answered by Dahlgren, who accepted the mail. Two hours later, a cleaner came to the house, but was sent away by Dahlgren immediately after entering the hallway. Meanwhile, the fourth victim, David, who was at school, received text messages from Dahlgren's phone that they would go running after his return. David was probably murdered immediately after returning to the house around 12:30PM.|$|E

25|$|Beck also hired {{a talented}} early {{graduate}} of the Academy, Joseph Henry, to return as a science teacher after he finished his studies at Union College in nearby Schenectady in a year. In addition to teaching science, Henry did research at the school {{with the help of}} his assistant and students. In 1827, he began experiments with electromagnetism, a recent discovery. He found ways to increase the strength of an electromagnet, and discovered electrical inductance. Often he would demonstrate these properties to students by using a wire routed around the classroom to make an iron bar ring a small bell. This was not only the prototype of the modern electric <b>doorbell,</b> the stronger electrical signal he was able to send over a wire eventually helped Samuel F.B. Morse develop the first practical telegraph. The same principle continues to make long-distance wired data transmission possible. He would later leave to take a position at Princeton University, and eventually became the Smithsonian Institution's first secretary.|$|E
500|$|Meanwhile, back in Springfield, Marge {{feels that}} Homer always gets {{to go on}} better adventures while she is left at home; she and Lisa decide to be adventurous too and go to buy a musical <b>doorbell</b> which plays the song [...] "(They Long to Be) Close to You". After installation, Lisa rings the <b>doorbell,</b> despite Marge's insistence that they should let {{visitors}} do the ringing first. The <b>doorbell</b> starts to [...] and repeatedly plays the song. Marge attempts to cut the wires to the <b>doorbell,</b> but fails to, since Homer traded their tools for M. She pulls out a wire, which instead causes the <b>doorbell</b> to play faster and louder, disturbing the neighborhood. The <b>doorbell</b> store's mascot, Señor Ding-Dong, appears and uses his whip to silence the <b>doorbell,</b> but then finds {{he is unable to}} leave in his Chevrolet as it won't start.|$|E

[...] He could have become Judiciary Committee chairman instead, as the death of Frank Brandegee of Connecticut made Borah senior Republican on that committee as well. The Foreign Relations chairmanship greatly increased his influence, one quip was that the new Secretary of State, Frank B. Kellogg, created policy by ringing Borah's <b>doorbell.</b> Borah continued to oppose American interventions in Latin America, often splitting from the Republican majority over the matter. Borah was an avid horseback rider, and Coolidge is supposed to have commented after viewing him exercising in Rock Creek Park that it [...] "must bother the Senator to be going {{in the same direction as}} his horse." ...|$|E
500|$|Ray drags {{the case}} {{to the top of the}} stairs and meets Eddie. Gerald lays Sabrina down on the sofa, places a cushion over her face and shoots her.

[...] The reverse of the sign reads [...] "Do you need any {{cleaning}} products today?" [...] Gerald heads inside and hides Sabrina's body as Paul waits. Gerald splashes his soup onto the blood and invites Paul to clean it. Ray runs down the stairs and meets Paul; he proceeds to buy rope before returning upstairs. Paul continues to clean, but sees the bullethole in the cushion, and then the suitcase being lowered outside the window. Gerald heads outside to investigate, but Eddie and Ray drop the case on his head. The burglars run past Paul and look out to see the canvas in the pool, before both being shot by Paul. Paul rings someone and says [...] "Hello, it's me. Yeah, it's done." [...] He looks to the fake painting, and says [...] "I've got it right here. Yeah, it's fine. Not a peep out of anyone." [...] He takes down the painting and walks out, as the real canvas is seen sinking in the pool.|$|E
