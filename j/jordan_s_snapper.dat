40|$|AbstractWe {{investigate}} the computational complexity of computing the convex hull of a two-dimensional set. We study {{this problem in}} the polynomial-time complexity theory of real functions based on the oracle Turing machine model. We show that the convex hull of a two-dimensional <b>Jordan</b> domain <b>S</b> is not necessarily recursively recognizable even if S is polynomial-time recognizable. On the other hand, if the boundary of a <b>Jordan</b> domain <b>S</b> is polynomial-time computable, then the convex hull of S must be NP-recognizable, {{and it is not}} necessarily polynomial-time recognizable if P≠NP. We also show that the area of the convex hull of a <b>Jordan</b> domain <b>S</b> with a polynomial-time computable boundary can be computed in polynomial time relative to an oracle function in #P. On the other hand, whether the area itself is a #P real number depends on the open question of whether NP=UP...|$|R
