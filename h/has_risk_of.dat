30|$|The {{presence}} of concomitant liver fibrosis, necroinflammatory activity {{as well as}} steatosis can only be reliably confirmed by liver histological analysis. However, liver biopsy is invasive and <b>has</b> <b>risk</b> <b>of</b> complications [31]. In addition, liver biopsy may be limited {{by the size of}} the specimen obtained as well as sampling, intraobserver, and interobserver variability [32]. Although liver biopsy is considered the gold standard for the evaluation of the grade of necroinflammation and stage of fibrosis [4, 33, 34] many guidelines also state that transient elastography, in combination with noninvasive biomarkers (i.e., FIB- 4, FibroTest), is highly useful to evaluate fibrosis in patients with chronic HCV. We propose that metabolomics is ideal to study the disease induced changes caused by any pathological process as it enables us to describe the full complement of metabolites present in in biofluids as well as tissues [3]. These metabolites represent the final downstream product of all transcriptional and translational processes within a cell. Alterations due to a disease process result in changes in groups of metabolites, which represents a pattern unique to the disease process. This metabolomic profile can be studied in detail to understand the histological changes in the tissue, which eventually leads to disease progression. For example, Cassol et al. studied the metabolomic changes in patient population with HCV and HIV co-infection. It was noted that there was a direct relationship between elevation in plasma bile acids and non-invasive markers of liver fibrosis [20]. Patients who had recorded high scores on the FIB- 4 and APRI scale also had increased levels of plasma GCA and TCA. Similarly, our analysis is reflective of increased bile acid synthesis, with glycine being down regulated in the advanced fibrosis model (Fig.  1 b). This is illustrated in the cholesterol conjugation pathway, where the enzyme BA-CoA:amino acid N-acyltransferase (BAT), amidates BA-CoA with glycine to form tertiary bile acids such as GCA and TCA [35]. Interestingly, O-acylcarnitine, which is a marker of beta oxidation of long chain fatty acid, was elevated in the necroinflammation (A 2 – 3) group (Additional file 1 : Figure S 1), a finding that was supported by Cassol et al. [20], who noted a positive correlation between elevated bile acid levels and acylcarnitines.|$|E
40|$|Conflict with {{livestock}} farmers is {{the most}} serious threat to the survival of the jaguar (Panthera onca) across its range of 19 countries of the Americas. In this thesis I examine the needs for mitigating human-jaguar conflict at a range-wide scale by: a) reviewing the state of knowledge on the topic, b) modelling the risk of conflict across the range, c) analysing a series of empirical field case studies, and d) proposing appropriate approaches for different levels of conflict. Findings from 43 published studies and 117 expert-described cases show that human-jaguar conflict occurs on large cattle ranches, mixed farms and smallholdings alike. Depletion of prey and poor livestock husbandry are reported as the key reasons for depredation, regardless of ecological, cultural or socio-economic context. Attitudes and tolerance towards jaguars are not necessarily linked to losses, so recent research has focussed on understanding the behaviours of farmers. With 65 % of the remaining jaguar range outside of protected areas, effective strategies for coexistence with farmers are essential. By combining geospatial datasets with expert-based information, spatial patterns of human-jaguar conflicts were presented in a predictive model of conflict hotspots. Around 85 % of the total jaguar range, 72 % of the total Jaguar Conservation Units area and 90 % of the Jaguar Corridor area overlap with livestock, and 15 % of the jaguar range <b>has</b> <b>risk</b> <b>of</b> conflict. Regions in which jaguars are repeatedly persecuted may become ecological traps and decimate populations. An aggregate study of 17 case studies across seven countries exposed a very large variety of geographic, agronomic and socio-economic contexts. Both within and across case studies there are considerable differences in farmers’ experiences with livestock losses, concerns about depredation, levels of tolerance and attitudes, as well as social norms towards jaguars in each community. No situational factors could be used to predict how farmers perceive jaguars and deal with depredation. The only pattern consistent across case studies was that attitudes towards jaguars are most likely predicted by a factor of perceived loses combined with the social norms of the community. In most scenarios, correctly balanced strategies of improving husbandry combined with behaviour-influencing methods may be the best way forward. To this end, a conceptual model is proposed, which distinguishes three levels of conflict and explains the importance of addressing any underlying history of grievances or incompatibility of values as part of any human-wildlife conflict mitigation strategy.
