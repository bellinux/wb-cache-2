500|$|According to Richard Freedman of the Newhouse News Service, [...] "This must be {{the first}} version of the Faust myth in which not only does Faust (or Faustina , here) manage to weasel out of the pact with the Devil, but succeeds in {{regenerating}} him, as well." [...] Elliot Krieger of Rhode Island's Providence Journal also took note of such a theme, headlining his review [...] "Faust goes to summer camp". [...] In regards to continuity issues, a reviewer in The Scarecrow Movie Guide observed a [...] "montage showing the Care Bears and their Cousins growing up together from infancy to full Care Bear maturationnullifying everything that happened in the first movie". [...] Mike McLane of Florida's Gainesville Sun gave a few suggestions of the storyline's possible religious subtext. [...] He compared the Great Wishing Star to God, the Bears' [...] "beautiful cloud kingdom" [...] of Care-a-Lot to Heaven, and <b>Dark</b> <b>Heart</b> to Satan; he also hinted that the Bears protected humankind like angels did.|$|E
500|$|Two unique Avatars {{join the}} Alpha as an {{exception}} to the Avataric rule. Carnivàles Avataric mythology prophesied the Usher of Destruction throughout the ages as a harbinger of the End Times to usher in the Armageddon. He is known by a thousand names in a thousand books, but can only manifest once. He appears as the Tattooed Man in visions, and he can only be killed with a weapon infused with the Vitae Divina that is thrust into the bough of his tree tattoo where his <b>dark</b> <b>heart</b> dwells. Injuries from such anointed weapons are said to never fully heal. Also prophesied is the Omega (known in the Pitch Document as Omega The Destroyer and the Antichrist), whom Carnivàles occult characters had assumed {{for a long time to}} be one and the same with the Usher. The Omega is, like the Alpha, a female and the only other known exception to the male restriction in Avatar succession, and because of the allusion to [...] "the Beginning and the End" [...] in naming, the Omega is commonly accepted as the last Avatar.|$|E

Rock music critic Neil McCormick from The Daily Telegraph named it the fifth best James Bond theme song, describing [...] "Die Another Day" [...] as an electro R workout which was [...] "expressively weird, brutally modern, satisfyingly original and evocative of the <b>dark</b> <b>heart</b> of Bond.

2500|$|There Will Be Blood is bravura film-making {{by one of}} American film's modern masters.

2500|$|The {{play was}} again {{adapted to the}} world of gangsters in Don Boyd's 2001 My Kingdom, a version which differs from all others in commencing with the Lear character, Sandeman, played by Richard Harris, in a loving {{relationship}} with his wife. But her violent death marks the start of an increasingly bleak and violent chain of events (influenced by co-writer Nick Davies' documentary book <b>Dark</b> <b>Heart)</b> which in spite of the director's denial that the film had [...] "serious parallels" [...] to Shakespeare's play, actually mirror aspects of its plot closely. Unlike Shakespeare's Lear, but like Hidetora and Sandeman, the central character of Uli Edel's 2002 American TV adaptation King of Texas, John Lear played by Patrick Stewart, has a back-story centred on his violent rise to power as the richest landowner (metaphorically a [...] "king") in General Sam Houston's independent Texas in the early 1840s. Daniel Rosenthal comments that the film was able, by reason of having been commissioned by the cable channel TNT, to include a bleaker and more violent ending than would have been possible on the national networks. 2003's Channel 4-commissioned two-parter Second Generation set the story in the world of Asian manufacturing and music in England.|$|E
