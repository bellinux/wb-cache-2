40|$|Full Paper: A novel <b>human</b> <b>hair</b> protein hybrid fiber was {{developed}} by combining (i) the high-efficiency extraction technique for preparing <b>human</b> <b>hair</b> proteins and (ii) the watery hybridization spinning method using gellan and chitosan. The resulting <b>human</b> <b>hair</b> protein-gellan-chitosan hybrid fibers are conveniently produced with by simply mixing the 7 - 35 % <b>human</b> <b>hair</b> protein– 1. 0 wt-. % gellan aqueous solution and the 1. 0 wt-% chitosan– 0. 15 M acetic acid solution at 50 °C, followed by pulling out to spin the <b>human</b> <b>hair</b> protein-gellan-chitosan ternary complex thus formed at the aqueous solution interface. By use of this simple procedure and ambient spinning condition, the <b>human</b> <b>hair</b> proteins were successfully incorporated into the fiber matrix of gellan-chitosan, without any denature and degradation. The hybrid fiber can be also recognized as {{a new type of}} the regenerated <b>human</b> <b>hair</b> keratin fiber, because of its high purity and content of <b>human</b> <b>hair</b> keratin types I and II. Mechanical strength of the <b>human</b> <b>hair</b> protein-gellan-chitosan fiber varies from 108 MPa to 153 MPa, depending on the contents of the <b>human</b> <b>hair</b> proteins. SEM observation revealed that the incorporated <b>human</b> <b>hair</b> proteins were found as the particles (1 - 10 µm) on the fiber surface. The type I and II keratins in the fiber matrices were rapidly biodegrade...|$|R
40|$|Background: <b>Human</b> <b>hair</b> {{can be used}} as an {{inexpensive}} and accessible adsorbent to remove a variety of pollutants from air. Although several studies have been done on removal of formaldehyde from wastewater by <b>human</b> <b>hair,</b> to date no study has investigated using hair to remove formaldehyde from air. Therefore, the aim {{of this study was to}} remove formaldehyde from synthetic contaminated air by a reactor packed with <b>human</b> <b>hair.</b> Methods: Air contaminated with formaldehyde was introduced into a cylindrical reactor packed with <b>human</b> <b>hair</b> at the initial concentration of 8500 mg/L. Formaldehyde concentration was measured in the influent and effluent of the reactor to indicate formaldehyde removal efficiency. Other measurements of parameters effective on formaldehyde removal were taken including amount of <b>human</b> <b>hair</b> and environmental temperature. Results: Results of this study revealed that each gram of <b>human</b> <b>hair</b> was able to remove 0. 13 to 0. 49 g of formaldehyde from air. <b>Human</b> <b>hair</b> adsorbed 98...|$|R
50|$|Synthetic fibers {{are made}} of various {{different}} synthetic fibers, but contain no <b>human</b> <b>hair.</b> Synthetic fibers, just like <b>human</b> <b>hair,</b> come in weave (weft) and single strands (bulk) for braids. They do not {{last as long as}} <b>human</b> <b>hair</b> because they can be easily damaged by friction and heat. The quality of fibers varies greatly. Depending on quality, they may never look like <b>human</b> <b>hair,</b> as they can be stiff and move differently from <b>human</b> <b>hair.</b> Synthetic fibers are much less expensive than <b>human</b> <b>hair.</b> Heating appliances such as curling irons, flat irons, and straightening combs generally should never be used on most types of synthetic hair. There are some newer versions of synthetic fibers that are more resistant, human-like fibers that can be heat processed allowing for heat styling.|$|R
40|$|The {{relationships}} between metal contents in soil, road dust, and rice, and in <b>human</b> <b>hair</b> from {{a rural area}} of China were observed for Cr, Cu, Mn, Ni, Pb, and Zn. The {{results showed that the}} mean concentrations of Mn in <b>human</b> <b>hair</b> were higher than the highest reference value. The concentrations of Cr, Cu, Ni, and Zn in soil and road dust were usually higher than their background values. The enrichment factors indicated that the determined metals in soil and road dust were usually derived from natural sources. Chromium, Pb, and Zn in soils and road dusts from several sites were slightly influenced by anthropogenic sources. The regression analyses showed that positive relationships usually exist between the concentrations of the determined metals in rice and in <b>human</b> <b>hair</b> as well as in soil and in <b>human</b> <b>hair.</b> However, {{relationships between}} metal concentrations in road dust and in <b>human</b> <b>hair</b> were less obvious. The study demonstrated that <b>human</b> <b>hair</b> was an applicable biomonitor of metal concentrations in rice, soil, and road dust from a rural area in China. Metal concentrations in local <b>human</b> <b>hair</b> could be used to predict contamination levels of metals in rice and soil...|$|R

40|$|Hair-to-hair {{interaction}} is often ignored in <b>human</b> <b>hair</b> modeling, {{due to its}} computational and algorithmic complexity. In this paper, we present our experimental approach to simulate the complex behavior of long <b>human</b> <b>hair,</b> taking into account hairto -hair interactions. We describe a thin shell volume (TSV) model for enhancing hair realism by simulating complex hair-hair interaction. The TSV is a thin bounding volume that encloses a given hair surface. The TSV method enables virtual hair combing for surface-model hairstyles. Combing produces the effects of hair-hair interaction that occur in real <b>human</b> <b>hair.</b> Any hair model based on a surface representation can benefit from this approach. The TSV is presented mainly {{as a tool to}} modeling <b>human</b> <b>hair,</b> but this model also gives rise to global hair animation control...|$|R
40|$|The hair cycle {{represents}} a dynamic process during which a complex mini- organ, the hair follicle, rhythmically regresses and regenerates. The control mechanism that governs the hair cycle ('hair cycle clock') {{is thought to}} be an autonomous oscillator system, however, its exact nature is not known. This thesis aims to understand the <b>human</b> <b>hair</b> cycle as a systems biology problem using theoretical and experimental techniques in three distinct study approaches. Using mathematical modelling, a simple two-compartment model of the <b>human</b> <b>hair</b> cycle was developed. The model concentrates on the growth control of matrix keratinocytes, a key cell population responsible for hair growth, and bi-directional communication between these cells and the inductive fibroblasts of the dermal papilla. A bistable switch and feedback inhibition produces key characteristics of <b>human</b> <b>hair</b> cycle dynamics. This study represents the first mathematically formulated theory of the 'hair cycle clock'. A second chronobiological approach was adopted to explore the molecular control of the <b>human</b> <b>hair</b> follicle by a peripheral clock mechanism. The hypothesis was tested that selected circadian clock genes regulate the <b>human</b> <b>hair</b> cycle, namely the clinically crucial follicle transformation from organ growth (anagen) to organ regression (catagen). This revealed that intra- follicular expression of core clock and clock-controlled genes display a circadian rhythm and is hair cycle-dependent. Knock-down of Period 1 and Clock promotes anagen maintenance, hair matrix keratinocyte proliferation and stimulates hair follicle pigmentation. This provides the first evidence that peripheral Period 1 and Clock gene activity is a component of the human 'hair cycle clock' mechanism. Lastly, an unbiased gene expression profiling approach was adopted to establish important genes and signalling pathways that regulate the <b>human</b> <b>hair</b> cycle. This revealed that similar genes and pathways previously shown to control the murine hair cycle in vivo, such as Sgk 3, Msx 2 and the BMP pathway, are also differentially regulated during the anagen-catagen transformation of <b>human</b> <b>hair</b> follicles. In summary, by using a three-pronged systems biology approach, the thesis has shed new light on the control of <b>human</b> <b>hair</b> follicle cycling and has generated clinically relevant information: a) The hair cycle model may predict how hair cycle modulatory agents alter <b>human</b> <b>hair</b> growth. b) Period 1 and Clock are new therapeutic targets for <b>human</b> <b>hair</b> growth manipulation. c) Gene expression profiling points to additional key players in <b>human</b> <b>hair</b> cycle control with potential for future therapeutic targets.

40|$|<b>Human</b> <b>hair</b> is {{considered}} a waste material {{in most parts of}} the world and its accumulation in waste streams causes many environmental problems; however, it has many known uses. Preventing waste of such a material requires both addressing the problems in the current usage and developing its utilization systems at locations where they are missing. With focus on developing systematic utilization of <b>human</b> <b>hair</b> waste, this paper first reviews the possible uses of <b>human</b> <b>hair</b> gathered from large scale trades, local/traditional knowledge, upcoming innovations, and scientific research; along with the socioeconomic systems that have evolved around the known uses.

40|$|The {{possibility}} of curling hair {{is attributed to}} the fact that the mechanical properties of hair fibres depend on time, temperature and humidity. In this study the dependence of the viscoelastic behaviour of <b>human</b> <b>hair</b> fibres on humidity is characterised in a bending deformation. An experimental set-up was used to perform bending relaxation measurements at different humidities. The relaxation data were fitted using a so-called ?stretched exponential equation?. The humidity dependence was incorporated by applying time-humidity superposition. Also, the influence of humidity on the initial E-modulus was found. The influence of humidity on the behaviour of <b>human</b> <b>hair</b> fibres could be modelled by using a general characterisation of the behaviour of <b>human</b> <b>hair</b> fibres.
