We know what these things are today; the iron teeth are our necessities, the thumbscrews are the high-powered and swift machinery close to which we must work, and the rack is here in the firetrap structures that will destroy us the minute they catch on fire.|$|E

2500|$|Lü Bu {{set up a}} camp one li {{southwest}} of Xiaopei (小沛; present-day Pei County, Jiangsu) and invited Ji Ling to his camp.

2500|$|In 219, Lü Meng {{came up with}} a plan to help Sun Quan seize {{control of}} Liu Bei's territories in Jing Province. He pretended to be sick and asked for {{permission}} to return to Jianye to seek medical treatment. Sun Quan played along by pretending to approve his request. Lu Xun went to visit Lü Meng and said, [...] "Guan Yu is near the border. How can we remain far behind the border and not worry about having to guard against him?" [...] Lü Meng replied, [...] "What you've said is true, but I'm seriously ill now." [...] Lu Xun then said, [...] "Guan Yu is proud of his own valour and he scorns others. He may have made great achievements, but he's overly conceited. Besides, he's heading north and he has never seen us a threat. When he knows you're sick, he'll definitely lower his defences. If we attack him when he lowers his guard, we can capture him. <b>I</b> <b>came</b> <b>here</b> <b>to</b> discuss with you a plan to attack him." [...] Lü Meng replied, [...] "Guan Yu is known for his bravery and ferocity in battle, and he's a formidable foe. Besides, he's in control of Jing Province. He governs with virtue and has made great accomplishments, while the morale of his army is at its peak. It won't be easy to defeat him." ...|$|E
