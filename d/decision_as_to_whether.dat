5|$|During a later court {{session on}} September 9, Takaesu {{attempted}} to submit medical evidence that Brown {{had suffered a}} back injury in 1999 and had a steel collar and bolts inserted around his spine. According to Brown, these injuries {{made it impossible to}} for him to assault V. N. as described in the police report. The Naha court panel of three judges agreed to issue a <b>decision</b> <b>as</b> <b>to</b> <b>whether</b> the evidence was submissable at a later date.|$|E

5|$|Measures, {{which were}} {{the means by which}} the National Assembly for Wales passed {{legislation}} between 2006 and 2011, were assented to by the Queen by means of an Order in Council. Section 102 of the Government of Wales Act 2006 required the Clerk to the Assembly to present measures passed by the assembly after a four-week period during which the Counsel General for Wales or the Attorney General could refer the proposed measure to the Supreme Court for a <b>decision</b> <b>as</b> <b>to</b> <b>whether</b> the measure was within the assembly's legislative competence.|$|E
50|$|Degrees of {{seriousness}} {{are used}} in medicine {{to make decisions about}} care. Seriousness is related to the effects of delaying or not having medical care. In an emergency hospital, the triage nurse must evaluate levels of seriousness of medical emergencies and rank them to determine order of care.

Animal studies suggest the potential for harm to the fetus in pregnancy, and suggest that moxifloxacin may be excreted into the milk of lactating mothers. <b>Decisions</b> <b>as</b> <b>to</b> <b>whether</b> <b>to</b> continue therapy during pregnancy or while breast feeding should take the potential risk of harm to the fetus or child into account, {{as well as the}} importance of the drug to the well being of the mother.|$|R

5|$|Those {{with more}} serious {{injuries}} {{had to be}} carried down the track. The usual <b>decision</b> <b>as</b> <b>to</b> <b>whether</b> {{it was safe to}} move someone was simplified by the Japanese, who killed all the wounded they encountered. Only those near death were abandoned. Casualties were held at the aid posts and dressing stations until they could walk, or the Japanese threatened. It took eight or ten Papuan carriers to move each man. Army stretchers rotted and fell apart; the Papuans improvised stretchers from blankets, copra bags and timber cut along the Track. The pace of the withdrawal was dictated by the rate at which casualties could be evacuated.|$|E
5|$|All but 4 of the {{scheduled}} 120 games were played. The four games {{that were not}} played were the series scheduled between the Brisbane Bandits and the Canberra Cavalry at the Brisbane Exhibition Ground for the ninth round. Flooding in Brisbane had resulted in the Exhibition Ground being used as an evacuation centre for affected residents. Initially the ABL postponed the series, leaving a <b>decision</b> <b>as</b> <b>to</b> <b>whether</b> the games would be rescheduled to a later time. Just prior to {{the final round of}} scheduled games, it was announced that the games would go ahead in the form of two doubleheaders, but that only games that would affect the playoffs would be played. When Brisbane lost the final game of their series against the Adelaide Bite, both they and Canberra were eliminated from contention for the playoffs; hence, the makeup games were not played.|$|E
5|$|Later, Black is {{informed}} that the girls are missing. She and Means search the woods, finding the girls in a grotto. They are with a teacher from the school, Ben Fisher (John Pyper-Ferguson) who attacks Means; she subdues him and he is arrested. She later confronts him, and it is revealed {{he is a former}} Group member charged with protecting the girls due to their powers. When Black later learns that Fisher has been released, she fears for McKenna's life. She rushes to the school, knowing the girls will be at a prayer meeting. She arrives just too late to prevent Alex from firing upon the meeting; Fisher is killed while shielding McKenna. Later, Means shows Black two sets of DNA test results—one from McKenna, the other from the Shroud of Turin. The profiles seem to prove that McKenna is related to Jesus Christ; Means entrusts them, and the <b>decision</b> <b>as</b> <b>to</b> <b>whether</b> to proliferate them, to Black.|$|E

5|$|The {{applicant}} for {{an election}} {{to be avoided}} may ask for a declaration that the election is void, that a particular candidate was wrongfully declared to have been elected, and/or that another candidate was duly elected. The applicant may also request for a scrutiny– that is, a re-examination of the ballot papers– {{if he or she}} alleges that an unsuccessful candidate had a majority of lawful votes. When a scrutiny is conducted, the election judge may order a vote to be struck off if the voter was not on the register of electors assigned to the polling station at which the vote was recorded or was not authorized to vote at the station; if the vote was obtained by bribery, treating or undue influence; if the voter committed or induced someone to commit the offence of personation; and if the vote was for a disqualified candidate and the disqualification was either a matter that the voter was aware of or was sufficiently publicized or widely known. During a scrutiny, a tendered vote that is shown to be valid will be added to the poll if any party to the proceedings asks for the vote to be added. On the other hand, a registered elector's vote will not be struck off at a scrutiny just because he or she was not qualified to be on the electoral register, and the returning officer's <b>decision</b> <b>as</b> <b>to</b> <b>whether</b> or not a ballot paper should be rejected may not be questioned.|$|E

In long-duration orbital {{habitats and}} interplanetary vessels, designers face difficult <b>decisions</b> <b>as</b> <b>to</b> <b>whether</b> <b>to</b> provide artificial gravity, and if so, how much. Habitats {{on the moon}} and minor planets pose other issues. Partial gravity offers greater freedom of movement on the vertical axis, but may hinder floor traction and horizontal mobility. The minimum gravity required to preserve health remains unknown. Supplementing significant but insufficient natural gravity with artificial gravity is problematic. However, the presence of at least some natural gravity may offer other alternatives that are not available in orbit...|$|R

A month after Palahniuk finished Lullaby, Shackleford was sentenced to death.|$|E

This paper investigates the drivers of farmers’ <b>decisions</b> <b>as</b> <b>to</b> <b>whether</b> <b>to</b> maintain “proenvironment” practices beyond the duration of a contract, {{and in particular the}} effect of social norms. Our results, based on the stated intentions of 395 French farmers, show that both pecuniary and nonpecuniary motivations drive farmers’ decisions, which are also significantly influenced by information about a social norm. Therefore “nudging” farmers, by conveying information to them on other farmers’ proenvironmental practices, appears to be a means of maintaining the long-run benefits of AESs...|$|R

25|$|Emotions play an {{important}} part in the negotiation process, although it is only in recent years that their effect is being studied. Emotions have the potential to play either a positive or negative role in negotiation. During negotiations, the <b>decision</b> <b>as</b> <b>to</b> <b>whether</b> or not to settle rests in part on emotional factors. Negative emotions can cause intense and even irrational behavior, and can cause conflicts to escalate and negotiations to break down, but may be instrumental in attaining concessions. On the other hand, positive emotions often facilitate reaching an agreement and help to maximize joint gains, but can also be instrumental in attaining concessions. Positive and negative discrete emotions can be strategically displayed to influence task and relational outcomes and may play out differently across cultural boundaries.|$|E

He mostly kept apart from the other inmates, taking solitary walks, tending a small garden, and beginning work on the drafts of two books. British author B. H. Liddell Hart was in correspondence with Manstein and others at Island Farm and visited inmates of several camps around Britain while preparing his best-selling 1947 book On the Other Side of the Hill. Liddell Hart was an admirer of the German generals; he described Manstein as an operational genius. The two remained in contact, and Liddell Hart later helped Manstein arrange the publication of the English edition of his memoir, Verlorene Siege (Lost Victories), in 1958.|$|E
