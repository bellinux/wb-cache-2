5|$|In September 1966, a {{friendly}} {{takeover of the}} Bradford brewers J. <b>Hey</b> & Company Ltd added 73 public houses to their estate. Webster's had a market value of £3.3million, and J. <b>Hey</b> had a value of £1million. The combined group had assets of over £4.5million (£65million in 2010 prices). Webster's continued to bottle Guinness under their <b>Hey</b> & Humphries subsidiary label into the late 1980s. Throughout the 1960s and early 1970s, consolidation, a good product and successful marketing made the company successful, according to The Times, with the social club trade accounted for around half of turnover. By 1967 Watney Mann owned 18.4 per cent of the company, and Webster's had a market capitalisation of £6million (£85million in 2010 prices) and owned 320 public houses and 12 off licences. Watney Mann had gradually increased their share to 27.1 per cent by 1972 when it initiated a takeover {{of the rest of}} the company. Samuel Webster & Sons was offered £18million for the 73 per cent of the company that Watney did not already own. The Watney Mann offer valued the entire company at almost £250million in 2010 prices. The takeover was {{a friendly}} one, and dependent upon the agreement of the Webster family, who owned 20 per cent of the company. Watney Mann was motivated by an increase to their tied estate. Following the takeover, Webster's continued as a regional subsidiary of the Watney Mann brewing empire, responsible for Yorkshire, Humberside, north Derbyshire and north Nottinghamshire. The takeover saw heavy investment in the brewery and the Webster's brands enjoyed increased distribution nationally. That same year, Watney Mann itself was taken over by Grand Metropolitan.|$|E
