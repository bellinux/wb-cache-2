EDT-TTF-Im-F(4) TCNQ pi-radical, in vacuo and in different conventional solvents (toluene, THF, DMF and DMSO) by using some popular hybrid density functionals (B 3 LYP, M 05, M 05 - 2 X, PBE 0 and BMK). It {{has been shown that}} the M 05 and B 3 LYP functionals perform the best in predicting the intramolecular charge-transfer (ICT) pertaining to both the ground state and excited states of the dyad. The amphoteric dyad is liable to solvent-promoted ICT from its EDT-TTF-Im donor (D) to F(4) TCNQ acceptor (A), adopting a charge-unseparated ground state D-A(center dot) in vacuo, a partially zwitterionic ground state [D-A](center dot) in nonpolar toluene solvent, and a fully zwitterionic ground state D center dot+-A(-) in such polar solvents as THF, DMF and DMSO. Owing to its solvent-dependent <b>chameleon</b> <b>ground</b> state, excited states of the dyad in solvents also exhibit remarkable dependence on solvent polarity, as revealed by TDDFT calculations. Furthermore, cluster model calculations revealed that intermolecular charge-transfer readily occurs between the dyads, accounting for the observed zwitterionic charge state in solid state and solid-state semiconductivity...|$|R
