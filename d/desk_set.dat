5|$|Tracy and Hepburn reunited {{on screen}} {{for the first}} time in five years for the office-based comedy <b>Desk</b> <b>Set</b> (1957). Berg notes that it worked as a hybrid of their earlier romantic-comedy successes and Hepburn's {{spinster}} persona, but it performed poorly at the box-office. That summer, Hepburn returned to Shakespeare. Appearing in Stratford, Connecticut, at the American Shakespeare Theatre, she repeated her Portia in The Merchant of Venice and played Beatrice in Much Ado About Nothing. The shows were positively received.|$|E
5|$|Tracy's first post-MGM {{appearance}} was in The Mountain (1956) with Robert Wagner, who played his much younger brother (Wagner had earlier played {{his son in}} Broken Lance). The location filming in the French Alps proved a difficult experience, and he threatened to leave the project. His performance earned a BAFTA nomination for Best Foreign Actor. Tracy and Hepburn then paired together for the eighth time in the office-based comedy <b>Desk</b> <b>Set</b> (1957). He again had to be convinced {{to stay with the}} film which met with a weak response.|$|E

60|$|As usual {{he broke}} upon {{us like a}} clap of thunder; but instead of {{flashing}} lightning-wise from {{the door to the}} estrade, his career halted midway at my <b>desk.</b> <b>Setting</b> his face towards me and the window, his back to the pupils and the room, he gave me a look--such a look as might have licensed me to stand straight up and demand what he meant--a look of scowling distrust.|$|R
25|$|During {{the summer}} of 1957 she got her first stage {{experience}} as a walk-on at the Playhouse in Malden Bridge, New York. That small part {{was followed by a}} role as the kid sister in Picnic and one as a vamp in <b>Desk</b> <b>Set.</b> She returned to school in Brooklyn but never took dramatic arts classes, preferring instead to gain some real-world stage experience. To that end, in her sophomore year, she took a night job at the Cherry Lane Theatre in Greenwich Village helping backstage. When she was a senior, she rehearsed for a small part in Driftwood, a play staged in a midtown attic space. Her co-star in Driftwood was Joan Rivers.|$|E
25|$|Cohl's {{financial}} situation deteriorated during the Great Depression and he endured years of severe poverty. While his peer, George Méliès {{was awarded the}} Legion of Honor medal in 1931, scant attention was given Cohl's pioneering work in animated film. In the spring of 1937, {{at the age of}} 80, his face was lightly burned when a candle on his <b>desk</b> <b>set</b> fire to his beard. During a couple of months stay at a charity hospital, the young film journalist René Jeanne helped organize a benefit screening of his work, which played at the Champs-Elysées Cinema on January 19, 1938, the day before Cohl's death, two weeks after his 81st birthday. Coincidentally, Georges Méliès died hours later. Cohl's ashes are kept in the columbarium of the Père-Lachaise Cemetery, in Paris.|$|E
60|$|Two {{thousand}} children besides spectators in {{a building}} meant for three hundred! How came it to be devised? There is a consultation among the clergy. They go from one portion to another of the well-generalled army, and each division takes up {{a position on the}} ground strewn with dry beech leaves; hassocks and mats are brought to the ladies, a <b>desk</b> <b>set</b> at the gate, and a chair for the archdeacon; the choristers are brought near, and the short out-door service is begun.|$|E
50|$|The House of Fabergé also stocked a {{full range}} of {{jewellery}} and other ornamental objects. There were enamelled gold and silver gilt, as well as wooden photograph frames; gold and silver boxes; <b>desk</b> <b>sets,</b> walking sticks, doorbells and timepieces. Quality was assured by every article made being approved by Carl Fabergé, or in his absence by his eldest son Eugène, before it was placed into stock. The minutest of faults would result in rejection.|$|R

These products were fabricated out of cast grey metal with a thick bronze plate finish and they retailed {{for just a few}} dollars. The company, which he named the McClelland Barclay Arts Products Corporation, made him little money.|$|R

6000|$|The attic of the {{old house}} had really turned {{out a number of}} {{interesting}} articles. There were tables, stands, settees, chairs, and a quaint old <b>desk,</b> <b>set</b> on a square pedestal with a base of carved lions' feet. This last interested Josie {{as soon as it was}} carried into the shop. The top part was somewhat dilapidated, the cover of the desk being broken off and some of the [...] "pigeonhole" [...] compartments smashed. But there was an odd lot of tiny drawers, located in every conceivable place, all pretty well preserved, and the square pedestal and the base were in excellent condition.|$|E

The boys also presented their teachers and the master with some volumes of history and poetry, and received numerous gifts in return. From his father Dave got a bank-book, with an amount written therein that was a complete surprise. His sister gave him a neat stickpin and his uncle a set of books, and from Jessie and her folks came a <b>desk</b> <b>set,</b> of solid silver, suitably engraved.|$|E

Specifically, such telephone sets were the types 565 (up to 5 lines), 630 (17 lines), 631 (29 lines), 830 (9 lines), and 831 (19 lines). Telephone sets could be either rotary dial models, or be equipped with Touch-Tone keypads.|$|R

The Catalin Corporation introduced 15 new colors in 1927 and developed techniques to create marbling. The colors included yellow, orange, red, greens, blue, and purple, with clear, opaque and marbled versions. In the 1930s, jewelry made in these colors was popular with sets of beads, bangles, earrings, and rings being worn together.|$|R

[...] The Madison Avenue shop of Rena Rosenthal carried their line of accessories—pewter cigarette holders and ashtrays, and <b>desk</b> <b>sets</b> in natural woods and pewter—which was praised by The New Yorker: [...] "These pleasant utilitarian features are totally unadorned; their line and proportion, {{both of which}} are a joy to behold, are all they have by way of ornamentation, and it's plenty." ...|$|R
