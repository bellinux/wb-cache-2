40|$|The {{influence}} of pH on the sorption of pentachlorophenol (PCP) onto three organic amendments, char, humic acid (HA) and peat, {{and the effect}} of organic amendments on PCP sorption to three kinds of soils were evaluated. The sorption of PCP on these sorbents fitted the Freundlich model well, suggesting that PCP sorption isotherms were nonlinear with exponential coefficient (N) value lower than 1. The PCP sorption capacity on three organic amendments and the N values increased with decreasing pH. The sorption capacities were in the order: char > HA > peat. Organic amendments resulted in an enhancement of sorption capacities of soils. The N values of PCP sorption on soils were decreased by char amendment and increased by HA and peat amendments. This study demonstrated that application of traditional organic amendments led to the enhancement of PCP sorption by soils.

40|$|The {{occurrence}} of ice-nucleating particles (INPs) in our atmosphere has {{a profound impact}} on the properties and lifetime of supercooled clouds. To date, the identities, sources and abundances of particles capable of nucleating ice at relatively low supercoolings (T  [*]>[*] − 15  °C) remain enigmatic. While biomolecules such as proteins and carbohydrates have been implicated as important high-temperature INPs, the lack of knowledge on the <b>environmental</b> <b>fates</b> of these species makes it difficult to assess their potential atmospheric impacts. Here we show that such nanoscale ice-nucleating proteins from a common soil-borne fungus (Fusarium avenaceum) preferentially bind to and confer their ice-nucleating properties to kaolinite. The ice-nucleating activity of the proteinaceous INPs is unaffected by adsorption to the clay, and once bound the proteins do not readily desorb, retaining much of the activity even after multiple washings with pure water. The atmospheric implications of the finding that biological residues can confer their ice-nucleating ability to dust particles are discussed...|$|R

40|$|Abstract: The {{chlorinated}} {{organic compounds}} comprise {{a large group of}} compounds with a complex diversity of biologic effects and mechanisms of action. Based on the persistence and high toxicity of dioxins, PCBs, and DDT, this chapter focuses primarily on the toxicology of these organochlorine compounds. Not even these groups of compounds can be regarded as homogenous since the individual congeners show diverse <b>environmental</b> <b>fates</b> and toxicities. In this chapter, primarily the critical effects suspected to occur at human exposure at background levels are discussed, i. e. cancer, and effects on reproduction, neurobehaviour and the immune system. In recent years, interactions between these compounds and hormonal systems have received increasing attention. They have also been shown to be particularly toxic to the develop-ing embryo, fetus and infant. In order to conduct risk assessment with a higher degree of accu-racy, {{there is a need for}} further mechanistical data, and additional epidemiological studies, espe-cially with regard to effects on reproductive, neurobehavioural and immune systems. The data presently available suggest that such effects already occur in the human population and thus, in order to reduce the exposure to these compounds, further release into the environment should be prevented...|$|R
40|$|UNMIX, {{a sensor}} {{modeling}} routine from the U. S.

VOC ambient concentration data acquired in 2000 – 2009 for 175 VOC species in four {{air quality monitoring stations}} were analyzed. UNMIX, by performing multiple modeling attempts upon varying VOC menus—while rejecting the results that were not reliable—allowed for discriminating sources by their most consistent chemical characteristics. The method assessed occurrences of VOCs in sources typical of the urban environment (traffic, evaporative emissions of fuels, banks of fugitive inert gases), industrial point sources (plastic-, polymer-, and metalworking manufactures), and in secondary sources (releases from water, sediments, and contaminated urban soil). The remote sensing and robust modeling used here produces chemical profiles of putative VOC sources that, if combined with known <b>environmental</b> <b>fates</b> of VOCs, can be used to assign physical sources’ shares of VOCs emissions into the atmosphere. This in turn provides a means of assessing the impact of environmental policies on one hand, and industrial activities on the other hand, on VOC air pollution...|$|R
40|$|The {{effects of}} {{photodegradation}} on the molecular size distribution {{and composition of}} dissolved black carbon (DBC) were explored using a surface water dissolved organic matter (DOM) sample from a terrigenous-influenced, fire-impacted Everglades area canal. The original and photodegraded DOM samples were fractionated using size exclusion chromatography and DBC was quantified via benzene polycarboxylic acid (BPCA) analysis. Size fractionation revealed that DBC was unequally distributed along the DOM molecular weight (MW) continuum and was preferentially associated with high MW (HMW) fractions. The photo-decomposition of HMW DBC generated less condensed DBC photo-products that preferentially re-associated with, and became enriched in, low MW (LMW) DOM size fractions. DBC composition in whole and size-fractionated DOM, as determined from relative BPCA distributions, was not considerably altered with short term photodegradation. This indicated {{that the size of}} the conjugated aromatic ring structure may drive the association of DBC compounds with different DOM MW fractions. HMW DBC was also more photo-labile than LMW DBC, which suggests that DBC associated with DOM over a range of size fractions may not exhibit the same degree of photo-reactivity, thereby resulting in different <b>environmental</b> <b>fates</b> for pyrogenic OM...|$|R

40|$|Nature has slow {{occurring}} biogeochemical {{cycles of}} trace elements and heavy metals and the cycles have significantly controlled <b>environmental</b> <b>fates</b> of these elements. The trace elements and heavy metals cannot be degraded like organic pollutants {{and they may}} transform and become stable and persistent contaminants that accumulate in soil and sediments [1 – 3].

As a result, estuaries and coastal marine ecosystems receive a variety of pollutants and contaminants that potentially have adverse effects not only on biota living in these habitats, but also on the humans who consume them [4]. Anthropogenic activities such as pollution, industrial, offshore oil and gas exploration have increased the levels of trace element and metal ions in natural water system. Improper disposal of contaminants from hazardous waste sites and industrial facilities have contributed to the estuary contamination as well.

40|$|Antibiotics {{pollution}} {{has become}} a critical environmental issue worldwide due to its high ecological risk. In this study, rapid degradation of enrofloxacin (ENR) was observed on goethite {{in the presence of}} Shewanella oneidensis MR- 1 during the transition from anaerobic to aerobic conditions. The abiotic reactions also demonstrated that over 70 % with initial concentration of 10 mg L- 1 ENR was aerobically removed within 5 min by goethite with adsorbed Fe(II), without especial irradiation and strong oxidants. The results of spin trap electron spin resonance (ESR) experiments provide evidence that Fe(II) /Fe(III) complexes facilitate the generation of center dot OH. The electrophilic attack by center dot OH opens the quinolone ring of ENR and initiates further transformation reactions. Five transformation products were identified using high performance liquid chromatography-quadrupole time-of-flight mass spectrometry and the ENR degradation process was proposed accordingly. The identification of ENR transformation products also revealed that both the surface adsorption and the electron density distribution in the molecule determined the reactive site and transformation pathway. This study highlights an important, but often underappreciated, natural process for in situ degradation of antibiotics. With the easy migration of the goethite-MR- 1 complex to the anaerobic/aerobic interface, the <b>environmental</b> <b>fates</b> of ENR and other antibiotics need to be seriously reconsidered...|$|R

And the character of biochars was compared using Elemental Analysis, Specific Surface Areas, Scanning Electronic Microscope and Fourier Transform Infrared Spectra. Batch equilibrium method was conducted to investigate the sorption of ciprofloxacin on biochars.

40|$|Many organic compounds, {{although}} beneficial, {{are associated}} with negative health and ecological impacts. It is therefore imperative to understand the <b>environmental</b> <b>fates</b> of these contaminants. Whereas the fates and health impacts of many persistent organic pollutants have been extensively examined, there is limited research characterizing the fates of these and the less persistent organic compounds in tropical multi-use watersheds. This study therefore aimed to evaluate the roles of forests and climate change on the <b>environmental</b> <b>fates</b> and health impacts of select organic chemicals in the Rio Cobre watershed, a tropical river basin in Jamaica. A total of 16 organic compounds were selected for this assessment, including some polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs), dioxins, furans and current-use pesticides. In the first portion of the assessment, field measurements of the concentrations of select PBDEs (PBDE- 28, - 47, - 99, - 100, - 153, - 154, - 183 and - 209) in the deposition, soil, litterfall and atmosphere of a forest and nearby clearing in the aforementioned watershed were evaluated. The mean air and litterfall concentrations of the PBDEs were lower in the forest than in the clearing, whereas the deposition flux rate and soil concentrations {{were higher in the}} forest. It was therefore concluded that the tropical forest filtered the PBDEs by transferring them from the atmosphere to the soil. In the next segment of the assessment, a multimedia environmental model of contaminant fate and transport, reflective of a region with three vegetative covers – urban, agricultural/grassland and forests – was developed to assist with the evaluations. This model, RioShed, was used to compute and compare fate metrics, including persistence and long range transport potential, for the aforementioned 16 organic compounds given varying forest parameters and climatic conditions. The atmospheric long range transport potentials and overall persistence of the organics were generally lower in the forested tropical watershed than in the un-forested tropical watershed, especially when the forests were fully evergreen. In this tropical watershed, the fate metrics were particularly responsive to precipitation rates. The atmospheric long range transport potentials and overall persistence of the evaluated organics increased and decreased, respectively, under the climate change condition of decreased precipitation rates. However, the effects of precipitation on the atmospheric long range transport potentials and overall persistence were more varied for the current-use pesticides. It was therefore concluded that the fates of the evaluated chemicals differed in forested versus un-forested tropical watersheds and that such differences were influenced by forest parameters, climate drivers and the chemical properties of the organics. The results and methods described in this dissertation are applicable in environmental multi-media model development and can be used to inform land management practices, as well as assist in decision-making for environmental sustainability in tropical developing countries...|$|R

Seidlitzia rosmarinus surfactant with Critical Micelle Concentration (CMC) value of about 8  % by weight imposes a considerable decrease in oil–water interfacial tension. Ahmadi et al. (2014) formulated a micro-fluid using micro-sized particles of mulberry leaf and studied the effect of mulberry leaf-derived surfactant on the IFT between oil and water at different surfactant concentrations.
