40|$|The thesis summerisees and {{discusses}} studies concerning factors influencing ammonia release in cow houses and factors influencing nitrogen surplus and nitrogen efficiency on dairy farms. The first investigation {{was carried out}} at the Animal Experimental Station at Anarp. The aims were to investigate if a lower content of crude protein in the diet for higli-yielding dairy cows will decrease the ammonia release from manure. The ammonia release was significantly decreased for cows fed with lower protein levels compared with high protein diets. The effects of manure-handling system, type of cow houses and feeding of dairy cows on ammonia release were studied in a field investigation. Results demonstrated a higher release of ammonia in <b>free</b> <b>stall</b> <b>barns</b> with liquid manure handling systems compared with tie <b>stall</b> <b>barns</b> with solid manure handling systems. There was a higher ammonia release from cow diets with a higher content of crude protein. A theoretical calculation or the nitrogen efficiency and nitrogen surplus at cow level and farm level was carried out. The assumptions for the calculations were for a farm located in central Skåne (south Sweden) with 50 dairy cows arid 50 hectares of arable land. The nitrogen efficiency at farm level was 28 % on an average. Nitrogen surplus per hectare varied between 135 - 145 kg when the intensity was 8600 kg milk/ha. Nitrogen balances from conventional dairy farms situated in southern Sweden were investigated using the farm gate method. Neither nitrogen surplus per hectare nor nitrogen efficiency showed significant effects of the manure-handling system. The results showed that nitrogen efficiency was significantly improved by including sugar beet in the crop rotation and was negatively correlated with milk yield per hectare and nitrogen fertiliser per hectare. Analysis of dairy farms with balances from three consecutive years 1997, 1998 and 1999 showed that these dairy farms decreased their nitrogen surplus by 25 kg N/ha between 1997 and 1998. This decrease was not repeated in the following year. Input of N from artificial fertiliser decreased significantly from the first year...|$|R

A computer visionbased system (CVBS) composed of a video-recording system and a cow lying behaviour detector based on the Viola Jones algorithm was developed. The CVBS performance was tested in a head-to-head <b>free</b> <b>stall</b> <b>barn.</b> Two classifiers were implemented in the software component of the CVBS to obtain the cow lying behaviour detector. The CVBS was validated by comparing its detection results with those generated from visual recognition. This comparison allowed the following accuracy indices to be calculated: the branching factor (BF), the miss factor (MF), the sensitivity, and the quality percentage (QP). The MF value of approximately 0. 09 showed that the CVBS missed one cow every 11 well detected cows. Conversely, the BF value of approximately 0. 08 indicated that one false positive was detected every 13 well detected cows. The high value of approximately 0. 92 obtained for the sensitivity index and that obtained for QP of about 0. 85 revealed {{the ability of the}} proposed system to detect cows lying in the stalls...|$|E

40|$|As California’s dairy {{industry}} continues to grow, manure management {{has become an}} increasingly important issue for dairy producers, government regulators and the public living {{in close proximity to}} dairies. Dairies are increasingly required to prepare nutrient management plans and comply with regulations concerning their manure management practices. A common dairy practice in California is to house the cows in <b>free</b> <b>stall</b> <b>barns</b> with water flush systems to remove the manure. The manure flush water, high in nutrients such as nitrogen and phosphorus, is collected in holding ponds until it can be combined with freshwater and applied to cropland during irrigation. Being able to quantify the amount of manure water applied is critical to good nutrient management of crops. The high trash and debris content of manure water has precluded the use of most flow meters commonly used in agriculture, such as the propeller meter. A field test of electromagnetic flow meters and a Doppler flow meter determined that both were accurate, dependable and appropriate for measuring manurewater flow rates. Their drawbacks are price ($ 3, 000 to $ 4, 000) and the need for electrical power for permanent flow-meter installations. Accurate flow-rate measurements are needed to more efficiently manage nutrients in water from dairy manure ponds, which is later applied during irrigation. Commonly used in agriculture, the propeller meter often becomes entangled with weeds and twine from a dairy manure pond, making it difficult to obtain readings. There are approximately 2, 200 dairies in California, with more than 1. 4 million cows. The largest concentration of dairies is in Southern California (Riverside and San Bernardino counties...|$|R
40|$|Estimation of {{individual}} intakes in dairy cows {{would be beneficial}} to select animals according to efficiency of milk production. The n-alkanes technique {{has been used to}} estimate intake by dairy cows in <b>free</b> <b>stall</b> <b>barns,</b> limiting faecal samples to one or two per day, but diurnal variation in the ratio of dosed to natural alkanes in faeces represents a source of error. We aimed to adapt this technique to estimate feed intake on a large number of lactating dairy cows housed on commercial dairy farms. Using a change-over design, six lactating cows fed a TMR diet were given a dose of 0. 5 g/day of C 32 n-alkane administered once a day as a drench (DRE) or top fed (TP). Feed offered and refused were weighed daily. After the lead-in phases, faeces were collected at 0700 hours, 1400 hours and 1900 hours on the last 5 days of each dosing period. Dry matter intake (DMI) was estimated from C 31, C 33 and C 32 concentrations in feeds and in faeces for each dosing system and sampling time. DMI estimated from C 31 :C 32 ratio was better correlated with measured individual DMI than estimates from C 33 :C 32 ratio. For DRE, the best correlation was for sampling at 1400 hours (R 2 ≤ 0. 96, P < 0. 001), but estimated DMI for the 1400 hours sampling was much higher than the actual DMI. For TP, the best correlation was for sampling at 0700 hours (R 2 ≤ 0. 83, P < 0. 001). Feeding C 32 n-alkane and collecting faeces once a day at the same time (0700 hours) represents a valuable protocol to measure individual intake on a large number of animals. © CSIRO 2014...|$|R

Two similar herds were constituted and milked with milking parlour (MP) or with automatic milking system (AMS). The cows of the two herds were fed the same diet distributed using TMR technique, once a day (at 07 : 00). The cows in MP were milked twice daily (at 03 : 00 and at 15 : 00). After AMS installation the AMS herd was constituted of 20 mid-lactating cows, moved from the MP herd. In the next months other cows were introduced in the AMS herd, reaching a numerousness of 26 cows. In the AMS area forced cow traffic was applied.

Thirty cows {{were divided into two}} homogenous groups according to milk yield and kept in two pens: one had beds with sand (SAMM) while the other had straw (STLM). Each pen was equipped with 2 fans (70 cm, 0. 50 kW) and 2 misters (delivery rate of 11. 2 and 22. 5 L/h in STLM and SAMM, respectively) in the rest area. Microclimatic parameters, rectal temperature (RT), breathing rate (BR), milk yield, and some milk traits were recorded. Behavioural routines of the cows (standing and lying) were also continuously recorded during the hotter days. During the trial, two mild-moderate heat waves were observed. During these hotter periods, the daily maximum temperature recorded in the rest areas was 28. 9 in SAMM and 31. 2 in STLM, and the daily maximum THI was 78. 2 in SAMM and 81. 5 in STLM. In these periods, the cows in SAMM compared with those in STLM showed lower BR (P < 0. 05) and greater rest time (10. 2 and 7. 8 h/day in SAMM and STLM, respectively). The RT did not differ (38. 89 +/- 0. 29 and 38. 88 +/- 0. 33 A degrees C in STLM and SAMM r,espectively).

40|$|Relationships were {{developed}} to predict ammonia (NH 3) nitrogen losses from cattle manure in animal housing, during manure storage, following field application, and during grazing. Ammonia loss in each phase was predicted using a mechanistic model for NH 3 volatilized {{from the surface of}} an aqueous solution of ammonium where the NH 3 is transported to the free atmosphere through a pathway with finite resistance. Ammonia emission rate was a function of the ammoniacal N content in the manure, ambient temperature, manure pH, manure moisture content, and the exposed manure surface area. Model relationships were calibrated by selecting values for the resistance to NH 3 transport for the various loss pathways, which predicted daily and annual emissions similar to those reported in published studies. In further evaluation, these calibrated relationships predicted average annual losses similar to those documented in previous work over a range in climate locations. These relationships were integrated into a whole-farm simulation model to provide a tool for evaluating and comparing long-term nitrogen losses along with other performance, environmental, and economic aspects of farm production. Whole-farm simulations illustrated that the use of a <b>free</b> <b>stall</b> <b>barn,</b> bottom-loaded slurry storage, and direct injection of manure into the soil reduced NH 3 emissions by 33 % to 50 % compared to other commonly used dairy housing and manure handling systems in the northeastern U.

40|$|Objective: The aim of {{this study}} was to assess {{lactation}} incidences of production diseases in German Fleckvieh cows. Material and methods: Investigations were carried out on six dairy farms (mean milk yield of herds 2008 : 7834 ± 708 kg milk [mean ± SD]) in Bavaria. All farms kept the cows in <b>free</b> <b>stall</b> <b>barns</b> and fed them a total or partial mixed ration based on grass silage and corn silage. In total, 116 cows and 58 heifers were examined daily for 14 days post partum and treated - if necessary - according to standard protocols. The acquisition of data for diseases in the further lactation was carried out by regular visits to the farm as well as communication with the herd manager and the farm veterinarian. Results: Pluriparous cows suffered more frequently from production diseases (milk fever, retained placenta, clinical ketosis, abomasal displacement, metritis, endometritis, ovarian cysts, mastitis) than primiparous heifers: 33. 3 % and 46. 4 % of pluriparous and primiparous cows, respectively, remained clinically healthy, while 24. 8 % and 30. 4 %, respectively, suffered from one production disease during the first 2 weeks of lactation; more than one production disease was diagnosed in 41. 9 % and 23. 2 % of pluriparous and primiparous cows, respectively. The lactation incidences of production diseases varied considerably among pluriparous cows of the six farms: retained placenta 16. 8 ± 13. 2 %, milk fever 15. 1 ± 7. 0 %, clinical ketosis 16. 8 ± 12. 4 %, metritis 3. 8 ± 3. 1 %, abomasal displacement 1. 1 % (median 0. 0; 0. 0 / 0. 0 %), endometritis 11. 7 ± 7. 0 %. Mastitis affected 56. 0 ± 7. 4 % of the pluriparous cows, which experienced 1. 7 mastitis episodes on average. At least one follicular cyst was diagnosed among 28. 4 ± 8. 6 % of the cows. Lameness affected 18. 5 ± 13. 5 % of pluriparous cows and heifers during the first 2 weeks of lactation. Conclusion: The lactation incidences of production diseases did not significantly differ from reference values reported for Holstein Friesian cows except the lower incidence of LDA among German Fleckvieh cows. The results indicate that the farm management affected lactation incidences of production diseases to a greater degree than additional factors, such as the breed of the cows...|$|R
40|$|Generally, < 30 % {{of dairy}} cattle’s {{nitrogen}} intake is retained in milk. Large amounts of nitrogen are excreted in manure, especially in urine, with damaging {{impacts on the}} environment. This study explores the effect of lowering dietary degradable nitrogen supplies – while maintaining metabolisable protein – on dairy cows’ performance, nitrogen use efficiency and gas emissions (NH 3, N 2 O, CH 4) at barn level with tied animals. Two dietary N concentrations (CP: 12 % DM for LowN; 18 % DM for HighN) were offered to two groups of three lactating dairy cows in a split-plot design over four periods of 2 weeks. Diets were formulated to provide similar metabolisable protein supply, with degradable N either in deficit or in excess (PDIN of 84 and 114 g/kg DM for LowN and HighN, respectively). Cows ingested 0. 8 kg DM/day less on the LowN diet, which was also 2. 5 % less digestible. Milk yield and composition were not significantly affected. N exported in milk was 5 % lower (LowN: 129 g N/day; HighN: 136 g N/day; P< 0. 001) but milk protein yield was not significantly affected (LowN: 801 g/day; HighN: 823 g/day; P = 0. 10). Cows logically ingested less nitrogen on the LowN diet (LowN: 415 g N/day; HighN: 626 g N/day; P< 0. 001) resulting in a higher N use efficiency (N milk/N intake; LowN: 0. 31; HighN: 0. 22; P< 0. 001). N excreted in urine was almost four times lower on the LowN diet (LowN: 65 g N/day; HighN: 243 g N/day; P< 0. 001) while urinary urea N concentration was eightfold lower (LowN: 4. 6 g/l; HighN: 22. 9 g/l; P< 0. 001). Ammonia emission (expressed in g/h in order to remove periods of the day with potential interferences with volatile molecules from feed) was also lower on the LowN diet (LowN: 1. 03 g/h per cow; HighN: 1. 25 g/h per cow; P< 0. 05). Greenhouse gas emissions (N 2 O and CH 4) at barn level were not significantly affected {{by the amount of}} dietary N.

The averages of RT and RR were always higher in the summer and at 3 PM when compared to 9 AM RT and RR (39. 47 ºC and 64. 76 mov/min vs 38. 89 ºC and 44. 21 mov/min). Gestation rate for milking cows was smaller in summer than in the winter. Conversely 85. 4 % of heifers became pregnant during the summer and 78. 5 % during the winter season...|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT: The {{impact of}} low {{temperatures}} combined with higher velocity of ventilated air in winter during severe frost in a <b>free</b> <b>stall</b> <b>barn</b> {{on the development}} of cold stress in Holstein-Friesian breed dairy cattle was studied. The study included measurements of outside and inside air parameters and cows ’ milk yield. Cold stress was evaluated in three technological groups (TG) using the WCT (Wind Chill Temperature) index. During the research, significant temperature and wind velocity differences (by up to 5 °C and 0. 5 m/s) were recorded in three zones of the barn occupied by the individual TG. All this resulted in different values of WCT. During most severe frosts lasting for 9 days, the average air temperature in the barn was – 8. 9 °C (the lowest value was – 17. 3 °C). The calculated average operative temperature for cows from all TG was as follows: – 7. 0 °C for TG 1, – 11. 1 °C for TG 2, and – 12. 3 °C for TG 3. It was also observed that animals from TG 2 suffered from mild cold stress, which resulted in milk yield reduction by approximately 2 kg. It was concluded that there is a strong correlation (r = 0. 72 – 0. 89 with P < 0. 05) between milk production and the WCT index. The measurements of most important microclimate parameters in the barn were conducted during winter seasons over the period of 2 years. They led to the conclusion that cattle kept in free stall barns are not vulnerable to the combination of low temperature and increased air movements. Research results of the present as well as of other authors were the basis for developing a table determining operative temperature for cows depending on the temperature of the environment and air movement velocity. Yet, the calculations and analysis of results show {{that there is a need}} to improve the applied calculation formula for operative temperature during cold weather...|$|E
40|$|Slurry and {{semi-solid}} manure {{exhausted by}} daily farmers have been {{spread to the}} meadows by substitution for fertilizer. However, it is {{pointed out that the}} bad smell from the manure and being excessively spread causes environmental pollution. Because it is difficult to compost manure for high moisture, upland farmers cannot increase the amount of use of the manure. The technology that can improve this problem is the mechanical separator. Though the mechanical separator for slurry manure had already been developed, a mechanical separator for semi-solid manure has not yet been finished. Moreover it is expected that semi solid manure will have been exhausted from 19 % of the daily farmers in the Tokachi region, and from 72 % of the daily farmers who have introduced the <b>free</b> <b>stall</b> daily <b>barn.</b> Therefore, the development and economic evaluation of the mechanical separator for semi-solid manure is in high demand. To develop the mechanical separator for semi-solid manure, we investigated the use of mechanical separators for slurry manure. The obtained solid fraction can be used as compost. Moreover, the obtained liquid fraction can be used as fertilizer, and the expense for fertilizer was greatly decreased. According to a trial calculation for the expenses of the developed mechanical separator for semi solid manure, {{it turned out to be}} 5. 21 million yen for a dairy farmer with 80 dairy cows. It revealed that the annual expense for use also reaches about 10 percent of overall expenses. The investment in the manure treatment technology won’t increase income immediately. Therefore, it is necessary to judge the possibility of an introduction based on economic evaluation...|$|R

40|$|A {{protocol}} {{was developed to}} measure ammonia emission concentrations from dairies using an isolation flux chamber. A hybrid dairy in Comanche county, Texas, was measured for one week each during August 2002 and January 2003. Sixty total ammonia samples {{were taken from the}} <b>free</b> <b>stall</b> <b>barn,</b> open lot, mixing tank, separated solids, compost, and two lagoons using the developed protocol. The ammonia concentration measurements were made using a chemiluminescence analyzer located inside a mobile laboratory. From the emission concentrations recorded, it was estimated that 9. 68 metric tons of ammonia were produced from this dairy per year. An emission factor of 13. 34 ? 28. 80 kilograms per day per thousand head of cattle (kg/day/ 1000 head) was estimated for this dairy (? 95 % confidence intervals) during summer conditions. For winter conditions the emission factor was 12. 05 ? 12. 89 kg/day/ 1000 head. The 11 % difference of the emission factors from summer to winter conditions was predominantly from the change in ambient and control volume temperatures (a mean difference of approximately 25 degrees Celsius), differences in source temperatures, and seasonal variability in husbandry. The adsorption of ammonia onto different polymer tubing used in pollutant stream conveyance was researched for possible systematic losses. Teflon and low density polyethylene (LDPE) were tested for ammonia losses with treatments of: temperature, length, and inlet concentration. Inlet concentration and temperature were significant factors used to describe ammonia adsorption for Teflon, whereas LDPE was also affected by tubing length. These factors were used to create a model to correct the summer dairy measurements for ammonia losses, resulting in an emission factor increase of 8. 3 % over the original value obtained from the flux chamber. A nitrogen mass balance was performed to estimate the amount of nitrogen available for ammonia formation as excreted - 177. 5 kilograms per year per animal (wet basis). The amount of ammonia excreted per year was also estimated to be 26. 63 kilograms per year. The measured ammonia emitted from the dairy was five times less than the ammonia excreted and thirty-six times less than the total nitrogen excreted...|$|E
40|$|The {{trial was}} carried out on Italian Friesian cows raised in an {{experimental}} <b>free</b> <b>stall</b> <b>barn.</b> The cows were fed once daily (TMR administered at 07 : 00) and milked twice daily (at 03 : 00 and at 15 : 00). During the trial 9 check points, throughout the seasons, were planned to observe feeding behaviour of cows raised in a pen equipped with 24 (1 per cow) feeding stations (Bio Control A/S). At each check point were continuously observed (per 3 days) 18 - 20 lactating cows for feeding behaviour parameters; finally were obtained data of 46 cows, 18 primiparous (PR) and 28 pluriparous (PL), between 50 and 250 DIM. Indexes of feeding behaviour, collected and automatically registered by the system, were number of visits, intake per visit and duration of visit. Indexes of feeding behaviour calculated were number of meals (considering the same meal when the interval between the visits was lower than 20 minutes), intake per meal, duration of meal and consumption rate. These indexes have been studied during the 24 h, in daytime (from 07 : 00 to 19 : 00) and in night time (from 19 : 00 to 07 : 00). At each check point was also recorded the individual milk yield, the TMR composition and its DM content. Primiparous had a slightly lower milk yield and a lower average DMI (19. 25 ± 2. 89 vs. 20. 77 ± 3. 24 kg DM/d, in PR and PL respectively). In PR, despite lower DMI, a higher number of meals in the 24 h (7. 72 ± 2. 13 vs. 6. 72 ± 1. 83, in PR and PL respectively) with a lower DMI per meal (2. 67 ± 0. 79 vs. 3. 27 ± 0. 81 kg DM/meal, in PR and PL respectively) and a lower consumption rate (96 ± 20 vs. 118 ± 26 g of DM/min, in PR and PL respectively) was observed. In addition a higher number of visits per day and visit per meal was observed in PR. DMI during diurnal hours was 74. 61 ± 11. 69...|$|E
40|$|Kmetija Poljanec je manjša hribovska kmetija, kjer se ukvarjamo z rejo krav dojilj. Trenutno imamo na voljo star hlev, ki ga nameravamo v prihodnje adaptirati. Na podlagi strokovne {{literature}} smo v diplomski nalogi proučili potrebne normative pri načrtovanju hleva in predstavili že izdelane idejne načrte različnih sistemov uhlevitve za krave dojilje. S pomočjo zbranih podatkov smo izdelali načrt za preureditev domačega hleva. V nalogi smo predstavili tloris hleva in s pomočjo programa SketchUp narisali 3 D skico prenovljenega objekta. V hlevu bo prostora za 12 krav s teleti. Namesto privezov za živali bomo imeli prosto rejo z ležalnimi boksi in možnostjo izpusta. Krmljenje bo potekalo zunaj v izpustu, v primeru slabega vremena pa bomo krmo pokladali v jasli v hlevu. Odstranjevanje gnoja bo potekalo strojno. Po celotni južni strani hleva bodo razporejena okna in tako bomo prispevali k večji osvetlitvi in boljši klimi. Adaptacija je kljub majhnemu številu živali na kmetiji še kako potrebna. S prenovo bomo izboljšali počutje živali in zmanjšali količino ročnega dela, ki ga je potrebno vsako dnevno opravljati v hlevu. Family farm Poljanec {{is a small}} hilly farm, {{where we}} deal with breeding of suckler cows. Currently we have old barn for suckler cows and young stock, which we plan to adapt in the future. Based on professional literature that we used for this thesis, we have looked into necessary norms and rules, which should be taken in consideration when planning a barn for cattle. We managed to present different practices of housing systems for cattle, particularly the housing of suckler cows. With gathered information, we created a design to adapt our barn for cattle. In the thesis, we presented {{the design of the}} barn {{and with the help of}} SketchUp we drew a 3 D sketch of the modernized facility. In the renovated barn, there will be place for 12 suckler cows with their calves. Instead of tied-in housing system, we will introduce a <b>free</b> <b>stall</b> <b>barn</b> with possibility of release animals outside the barn. The feeding will take place outside the barn, except in case of bad weather we will feed the animals inside the barn, by leaving fodder in the hayrack. Manure removal will be automatized. On the southern side of the barn, there will be windows for better lighting and climate. Even though the number of cows is quite low, the adaptation of the facility is necessary. With the renovation of the facility, we will not only minimize the amount of manual work that is put into successful farming on a daily basis, but we will also improve the animal welfare...|$|E
