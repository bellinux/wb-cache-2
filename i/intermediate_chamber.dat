40|$|We present {{evidence}} that adenosine triphosphate (ATP) {{plays a major}} role in excitatory neuro-neuronal transmission in ascending and descending reflex pathways to the longitudinal (LM) and circular muscle (CM). A partitioned bath was used for the pharmacological isolation of a segment of guinea-pig ileum (∼ 6 cm in length), allowing drugs to be selectively applied to an intermediate region between the region where mucosal stimulation was applied and that where mechanical recordings were made. Brush stroking the mucosa (3 strokes) elicited a synchronous contraction of the LM and CM both above (ascending excitation) and below (descending excitation) the site of stimulation. All reflexes were abolished when tetrodotoxin (1 μm) was applied to the <b>intermediate</b> <b>chamber.</b> Hexamethonium (300 μm) added to the <b>intermediate</b> <b>chamber</b> abolished the ascending contraction in 15 % of oral preparations (from 26 preparations, 18 animals) and the descending contraction in 13 % of anal preparations studied (from 53 preparations, 48 animals). In the remaining 85 % of oral preparations, hexamethonium usually attenuated the oral contraction of the LM and CM. However, in the remaining 87 % of anal preparations, hexamethonium had no effect on the anal contraction of the LM and CM. Oral and anal reflexes that were hexamethonium resistant were either abolished or attenuated by the further addition of the P 2 purinergic receptor antagonist pyridoxal phosphate- 6 -azophenyl- 2 ′, 4 ′-disulphonic acid (PPADS, 10 μm) or α,β-methylene ATP (50 – 100 μm) to the <b>intermediate</b> <b>chamber.</b> 1, 1 -Dimethyl- 4 -phenyl-piperazinium iodide (DMPP, 20 μm) or α,β-methylene ATP (50 – 100 μm) stimulated both ascending and descending excitatory pathways, when applied to the <b>intermediate</b> <b>chamber.</b> In conclusion, ascending and descending neuro-neuronal transmission in excitatory nervous pathways to the LM and CM is complex and clearly involves neurotransmitter(s) other than acetylcholine (ACh). We suggest mucosal stimulation releases ACh and ATP in both ascending and descending excitatory reflex pathways that synapse with excitatory motoneurons to the LM and CM...|$|E
40|$|In hydrogen-fuelled {{internal}} combustion engines, port fuel injection, compared to direct injection, allows higher range and is {{less expensive and}} more adaptable to existing engines, but leads to lower specific power and may cause backfire and pre-ignition. Conversely, direct injection is more complex and expensive, but provides even higher specific power than with gasoline, prevents backfire and makes pre-ignition less probable. The benefits of direct injection are added to those of port fuel injection in an innovative lowpressure (12 bar rail pressure) direct-injection system that is shown in this paper. The injection is accomplished in two steps: first an electroinjector meters hydrogen and feeds a small <b>intermediate</b> <b>chamber,</b> then the hydrogen stored in the <b>intermediate</b> <b>chamber</b> is timely injected into the cylinder by a mechanically actuated valve.

The magmas that fed this volcanism are well represented by the Cerro de las Tórtolas Formation, which {{is divided into two}} volcanic episodes based on petrographic, chemical and age differences: an older basaltic-andesitic event (16 - 14 Ma) and a younger andesitic to dacitic (13 - 10 Ma) one. Representative plagioclase, orthopyroxene, clinopyroxene and amphibole phenocrysts from rock samples already characterized from geochemical and isotopic viewpoints were selected for electron microprobe determination of mineral chemistry.

Equilibrium pressure calculated using amphibole composition for volcanic suites produced the most comprehensive results for pressure equilibrium conditions, with results close to 4 kb. Changes in the residual mineral assemblages and variations in isotopic signatures indicate that primary magmas were equilibrated at the lower crust with a gradual increase of crustal thickness.

40|$|The paper {{describes}} the CFD analysis, the arrangement {{and the first}} experimental results of a single-cylinder engine that employs an innovative low-pressure hydrogen directinjection system, characterised by low fuel rail pressure (12 bar) and consequent low residual storage pressure. The injection is split in two steps: at first hydrogen is metered and admitted into a small <b>intermediate</b> <b>chamber</b> by an electroinjector (a conventional one usually employed for CNG), next a mechanically-actuated poppet valve, that allows high volumetric flow rates, times hydrogen injection from the <b>intermediate</b> <b>chamber</b> to the cylinder within a short time, despite the high hydrogen volume due to the low injection pressure. Injection must be properly timed to maintain pressure below 6 bar (or little more) in the <b>intermediate</b> <b>chamber</b> and thus keep sonic flow through the electroinjector, to maximize volumetric efficiency and to avoid backfire in the intake pipe. A preliminary CFD study based on code KIVA 3 v {{was carried out in}} order to compare the behaviour of different injection valve and valve-seat geometries in controlling air-fuel mixing inside the cylinder and to address the choice towards the most suitable ones, i. e. those that allow adequate fuel distribution in the combustion chamber at ignition time for every operating condition. As well, all the modifications necessary to obtain the prototype engine from a production one were based on KIVA 3 v predictions, especially as regards the volume of the <b>intermediate</b> <b>chamber</b> and diameter, maximum lift and opening duration of the injection valve. The prototype derives from the single-cylinder Aprilia-Rotax 650 cm 3 with five valves (three intake and two exhaust).

40|$|In {{the last}} decade {{there has been a}} {{considerable}} effort to better understand the joint evolution of mafic and ultramafic magmatic systems and their deep mantle roots, through integrated petrological and thermo-barometric studies. Magma generation is regarded as the result of complex processes including melting, creation of channels for melt transfer, and interaction with the wall-rocks. Complexities in magmatic systems involve metasomatism and the creation of metasomatic fronts, branching and splitting of magma volumes during their evolution, and variable compositional development during transfer to upper crystallizing horizons. Intrusions and formation of <b>intermediate</b> magmatic <b>chambers</b> in the upper mantle Moho or in the lower crust are often accompanied by melt differentiation according to Assimilation-Fractional-Crystallization processes (AFC). Splitting of polybaric magmatic systems brings the appearance of a wide spectrum of melt compositions. Each magmatic plume leaves its own tracers in the mantle, and can erase signs of preceding mantle magmatic events. Commonly, petrologists may focus on individual magmatic processes through the study of mantle rocks and mantle xenoliths, but there have been recent efforts to produce complex models that take into account the various aspects of such evolving magmatic system, particularly that take account of spatial and temporal changes.

40|$|We {{investigated}} {{the involvement of}} muscle tone and circular muscle (CM) contraction in peristalsis in isolated guinea-pig small intestine. A segment of jejunum (∼ 13 cm) was mounted into a three chambered partitioned bath. Peristaltic waves were initiated in the oral chamber eitherby: (1) infusing fluid into the oral end of the jejunum; the ejected fluid was diverted via a cannula from reaching the intermediate and anal chambers, or by (2) intraluminal balloon distension of the empty oral segment. Tension of the circular muscle was measured in all three chambers. Peristaltic waves elicited by fluid infusion were evoked at an abrupt threshold. In contrast, peristaltic waves elicited by distension could be graded in amplitude according to stimulus intensity. Peristaltic waves evoked in an empty intestine exhibited similar propagation velocities to peristaltic waves associated with fluid propulsion. Nifedipine (200 - 400 nM) added to the <b>intermediate</b> <b>chamber</b> to block muscle contraction did not prevent peristaltic waves elicited by either stimulus from propagating into the anal chamber, although their amplitude was attenuated. Nifedipine {{to the site of}} stimulation (oral chamber) abolished peristaltic waves generated by either stimulus. Tetrodotoxin (1 - 2 μM), or a low Ca 2 +-high Mg 2 + solution to the <b>intermediate</b> <b>chamber</b> abolished the propagation of peristalsis from the oral to anal chambers. In conclusion, graded peristaltic waves can occur in an empty intestine. Therefore peristalsis is not necessarily an ‘all-or-none’ phenomenon. Peristalsis depends on the spread of nervous activity along the bowel, rather than the reactivation of neural circuits caused by displacement of fluid in the lumen.

Testing the goodness of fit is problematic for hyperbolic distributions; for comparing purposes we 4 sum the distances to chords approximating the hyperbola. Mobile and immobile elements behave similarly, suggesting that no A elements are lost or added from outside the system. The data suggests that already the most mafic of the analysed rocks is a mixture of the 'normal' dolerite and a siliceous crustal rock. A mafic magma intruded into the base of the crust, where it fractionated resulting in a decreased Mg number. The magma was then contaminated with country rocks in an <b>intermediate</b> magma <b>chamber</b> due to country rock melting; during mixing/mingling almost no fractionation took place. The contaminated rock suggests the presence of a fluid phase. This was probably a prerequisite for country-rock melting. Enrichment in some incompatible elements suggests that besides major mixing/mingling a thermochemical separation process has affected the most felsic rock enriching it in light rare earths and Zr...|$|R
40|$|International audienceThe Amsterdam-St Paul (ASP) oceanic plateau {{results from}} the {{interaction}} between the ASP hot spot and the Southeast Indian ridge. A volcanic chain, named the Chain of the Dead Poets (CDP), lies to its northward tip and is related to the hot spot intraplate activity. The ASP plateau and CDP study reveals that ASP plume composition is inherited from oceanic crust and pelagic sediments recycled in the mantle through a 1. 5 Ga subduction process. The ASP plateau lavas have a composition (major and trace elements and Sr-Nd-Pb-Hf isotopes) reflecting the interaction between ASP plume and the Indian MORB mantle, including some clear DUPAL input. The Indian upper mantle below ASP plateau is heterogeneous and made of a depleted mantle with lower continental crust (LCC) fragments probably delaminated during the Gondwana break-up. The lower continental crust is one of the possible reservoirs for the DUPAL anomaly origin that our data support. The range of magnitude of each end-member required in ASP plateau samples is (1) 45 % to 75 % of ASP plume and (2) 25 % to 55 % of Indian DM within 0 % to a maximum of 6 % of LCC layers included within. The three end-members involved (plume, upper mantle and lower continental crust) and their mixing in different proportions enhances the geochemical variability in the plateau lavas. Consequently, the apparent composition homogeneity of Amsterdam Island, an aerial summit of the plateau, may result from the presence of <b>intermediate</b> magmatic <b>chambers</b> into the plateau structure...|$|R
40|$|We {{report on}} a {{calculation}} of momentum resolution for muons incident on the large end-cap chambers. The impact on the resolution of two chamber designs was evaluated: Those constructed with straight drift tubes are compared to the ATLAS baseline design in which chambers are bent such that tube axes conform to the catenary of their respective anode wires. The analysis was performed using the GARFIELD program to calculate drift tube time-to-space functions. ATLAS muon system code packages LHCTOR and MUONBOX were used to generate tracks, hits and momentum reconstruction. We find that, for straight tube chambers compared to bent ones, the overall degradation in momentum resolution, averaged over all of {{the largest of the}} so called large end-cap chambers (EML 4 - 5 and EOL 3 in the pseudo-rapidity range 1. 02 < η < 1. 49), is very small for muon transverse momentum P_t = 500 Gev and negligible for P_t < 100 Gev. When the <b>intermediate</b> large end-cap <b>chambers</b> (EEL 1 and EEL 2) are considered no momentum degradation at P_t= 500 Gev is observed...|$|R
