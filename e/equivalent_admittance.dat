40|$|This {{thesis is}} centred around {{a form of}} {{resonance}} analysis for power systems known as Harmonic Resonance Mode Analysis (HRMA). It {{is a form of}} eigenvalue analysis and has some parallels to the modal analysis commonly associated with small signal stability. Modes in small signal stability analysis characterise the transient response of the system to a small disturbance, and are identified from the state matrix of the linearised state space description. Modes in HRMA characterise the parallel resonances of a power system, and are identified from the admittance matrix. Participation factors, which are derived from eigenvectors of the admittance matrix at resonance frequencies, indicate the observability of modes in the impedance measured at individual buses. In addition, sensitivity indices quantify the change in amplitude and frequency of modes when parameters are adjusted in the admittance matrix. A part of this thesis is dedicated to replicating HRMA results found in published papers. By validating published results for two different test cases, the computer implementation for carrying out the analysis is verified. Obtained results are generally consistent with those in published papers. Some critical considerations in implementation of HRMA are identified and discussed, perhaps the most important of which is the issue of modal switching. HRMA is also used to investigate resonances in a system modelled on the real offshore wind power plant of Anholt in Denmark. HRMA is based on the nodal admittance matrix, and power system components are modelled as <b>equivalent</b> <b>admittances.</b> Non-linearities and frequency dependencies can be included more easily than in a state space representation. Examining the impact of non-linear components in the admittance matrix on HRMA results is a central contribution from this thesis. The sensitivity of results with respect to degree of aggregation of the wind power plant model is also investigated. Modern wind turbines are connected to power systems via full-scale frequency converters. Such converters can be modelled for harmonic analyses as equivalent impedances which are determined primarily from the converter current control loops. An equivalent impedance representing the grid-side converter of a wind turbine generator as seen from the grid is derived, and later such impedances are incorporated in the HRMA. The resonance modes in the investigated large offshore wind power plant are sensitive to modelling of wind turbine main circuit components such as shunt harmonic filters, step-up transformers and main reactors. Suitable modelling of these electrical components is therefore important for obtaining reliable result from HRMA. Moreover, the resonance modes are highly dependent on the number of turbines in operation...|$|R

40|$|Although {{there is}} {{extensive}} literature on theoretical and numerical techniques for the rough surface scattering problem, there is relatively little work {{done on the}} analysis of the statistical properties of the scattered field, which is the core component of this dissertation. Scattering of electromagnetic waves from one-dimensional perfectly conducting large rough surfaces at low grazing angles is considered. Two different approaches, one based on the parabolic equation techniques and the other based on an exact full wave integral equation, are investigated. ^ For the parabolic equation modeling of the forward scattering over a rough surface, we are mainly concerned with the mean field. Efficient Fourier split-step solutions are carried out and results are compared to the experimental data showing reasonably good agreements for surfaces with moderate roughness. Meanwhile a recently published analytical approach, the mean Green’s function technique for computing the mean scattered field, is numerically evaluated through direct comparisons with other methods. Unfortunately numerical computations reveal that the scattered field calculated by this technique is not accurate particularly for the <b>equivalent</b> <b>admittance.</b> ^ In the second method, the surface is assumed to be periodic resulting in a surface integral equation over only one single period. The new integral equation is discretized using the method of moments and is solved using the generalized conjugate residue algorithm {{with the help of the}} fast multipole method. Numerical results based on Monte Carlo simulations show that the mean scattering amplitude vanishes in non-specular directions and it is uncorrelated between different scattering angles, resulting in a scattered field whose autocorrelation function depends only on the position difference. Unlike the scattering amplitude, the scattered field does follow some form of non-delta-like autocorrelations and it decorrelates more rapidly when the surface is rougher. It is also shown that the fluctuating part of the reflection coefficient in the specular direction does not always follow a Rayleigh distribution unless the Rayleigh parameter is large. It is however always Rayleigh distributed in non-specular directions. The fluctuating part of the scattered field on the other hand always follows a Rayleigh distribution. ...|$|E
5000|$|In RF {{circuit and}} {{matching}} problems {{sometimes it is}} more convenient to work with admittances (representing conductances and susceptances) and sometimes {{it is more convenient}} to work with impedances (representing resistances and reactances). Solving a typical matching problem will often require several changes between both types of Smith chart, using normalised impedance for series elements and normalised admittances for parallel elements. For these a dual (normalised) impedance and admittance Smith chart may be used. Alternatively, one type may be used and the scaling converted to the other when required. In order to change from normalised impedance to normalised admittance or vice versa, the point representing the value of reflection coefficient under consideration is moved through exactly 180 degrees at the same radius.

There are typically many induction motors connected to the bus, and models that aggregate the motors do not capture the cascading stall. We study the cascading stall in a simple power system with many induction motors using a quasistatic assumption and randomization of some motor parameters, and hence efficiently estimate the distribution of the number of motors stalled. This approach is also extended to a simple 4 -bus system and a simple motor dynamics and similar results are obtained. These distributions can often be fit with a high-level and generic probabilistic model of cascading failure, showing a commonality between cascading motor stall and other cascading processes.

40|$|Among {{the variety}} of {{artificial}} periodic impedance surfaces proposed and studied in the last decade, Artificial Magnetic Conductors (AMC) or High-Impedance Surfaces (HIS) are of particular interest for antenna applications, as they allow for the realization of thin substrates for low-profile radiators (e. g., of printed type) with improved matching and radiation characteristics. The problem of calculating the electromagnetic field produced by an antenna {{in the presence of}} such artificial periodic impedance surface, usually placed on a grounded dielectric slab or more generally on a planar multilayer substrate, is a complex one, because of the necessity to model the interaction of aperiodic sources with a periodic environment. In order to develop fast but accurate design procedures for these antennas it would be extremely useful to have reliable analytical models for homogenized periodic surfaces. Homogenization allows for representing the effect of the artificial boundary through a suitable surface or transition (sheet) impedance; this, in turn, translates into an <b>equivalent</b> <b>admittance</b> in a transverse equivalent network representation of the structure in the spectral domain. The calculation of the field produced by a finite source is then reduced to the standard determination of a spectral-domain Green’s function and the subsequent numerical evaluation of Sommerfeld-type integrals in order to obtain the field in the spatial domain. In this work, we examine spectral representations of homogenized HIS with an electric line-source excitation, with the aim of determining their accuracy for both the near and far-field calculations. The HIS structures considered here are formed by a 2 D array of frequency-selective surface elements (patches, Jerusalem crosses, etc.) printed on a grounded dielectric slab, with an electric line source directed parallel to one of the two axes of periodicity. Then, the excitation problem turns to the determination of the 2 D electric-type Green’s function of the homogenized HIS structures. Results for the near field, which is the most critical issue, are compared with full-wave results obtained with the method of moments, in which the presence of an aperiodic source in a periodic environment has been taken into account via the Array Scanning Method. Numerical results for several HIS configurations are presented and discussed...|$|E
40|$|Graduation date: 2005 Mobile and {{telecommunication}} {{industry has}} experienced tremendous {{growth in the}} recent past. Miniaturization and increased functionality have become necessary for all passive components in the system. Bandpass filters are critical passive components in any communication system and the existing designs in the crucial 1 - 10 GHz bandwidth suffer many drawbacks. For instance, widely used coupled line bandpass filters have undesirable harmonics at twice the center frequency and generally offer large footprints at these frequencies. Several other variations of bandpass filters {{have been reported in}} the literature. However, many of the existing filter designs do not take optimum advantage of the emerging technologies such as Low Temperature Co-fired Ceramic (LTCC) and Multichip Module Deposition (MCM-D), where compact geometries can be realized in a multi-level multi-conductor environment. Basically, design of high performance bandpass filters needs to address two important aspects. First, an efficient way of suppressing the higher order harmonics needs to be embedded into the filter geometry while maintaining the passband performance. Second, the filter configurations need to be compact and suitable for the current multilevel fabricational technologies. This thesis attempts to address both of these aspects by proposing new bandpass filter configurations in single and multilayered environments. A simple design procedure is developed for synthesizing a bandpass filter based on an <b>equivalent</b> <b>admittance</b> inverter parameter approach. This procedure can be applicable for a wide range of filter geometries. Several new techniques to tackle the issue of higher order harmonics are proposed. New configurations of compact filters are proposed in single and multilayer configuration with harmonic suppression. The challenges faced in designing these filters are discussed. Some of the challenges include overcoming the problem of interconnections between the different layers and reducing the design time for these configurations. To address these challenges, new, multilevel vialess filters are proposed, where the broadside coupling between layers is effectively used as a part of the filter characteristic to interconnect different layers. Further, an innovative algorithm to achieve first time successful design based on electromagnetic simulations has been proposed. The proposed new filter configurations have been validated with the full-wave electromagnetic simulation as well as measurement. This research on new configurations of efficient bandpass filter realization should prove useful for a wide range of applications in the frequency range of 1 and 20 GHz...|$|E
40|$|Transformer {{terminal}} <b>equivalents</b> obtained via <b>admittance</b> {{measurements are}} suitable for simulating high-frequency transient interaction between the transformer and the network. This paper augments the terminal equivalent approach with a measurement-based voltage transfer function model which permits calculation of voltages at internal points in the regulating winding. The approach is demonstrated for a single-phase three-winding transformer in tap position Nom+ with inclusion of three internal points in the regulating winding that represent the mid-point and the two extreme ends. The terminal equivalent modeling makes use of additional common-mode measurements to avoid error magnifications to result from the ungrounded tertiary winding. The final model is used in a time domain simulation where ground-fault initiation results in a resonant voltage build-up in the winding. It is shown that that the peak value of the resonant overvoltage can be higher than during the lightning impulse test, with unfavorable network conditions. Additional measurements show that the selected tap position affects the terminal behavior of the transformer, changing the frequency and peak value of the lower resonance point in the voltage transfer between windings.

40|$|Nowadays, {{switching}} power converters are massively used {{in almost any}} {{electrical and electronic equipment}} and appliances. This class of circuits are inherently time-varying systems that are characterized by the periodic activity of their internal switches which leads to discontinuous absorbed currents. The above currents, that play the role of high frequency noisy disturbances feeding the power distribution system, become a serious concern for designers that need to comply with the electromagnetic compatibility (EMC) regulation for the conducted emission (CE). In this frame- work, modeling and simulation tools for switching circuits are key resources in the early design phase for the prediction of the conducted emission and for the assessment of alternative design scenarios. The classical approach to CE prediction is via physical-based models and time-domain simulations. This solution, however, requires intimate knowledge of the internal device structure. Also, large simulation times are in general needed to avoid integration errors and to achieve accurate results (the CE are in fact computed by applying the Fourier transform on the steady-state portion of the current response of the circuit). As an alternative, frequency-domain behavioral approaches are available in literature. In the latter case, the proposed models are small-signal time-invariant approximations computed from the external observation of the circuit behavior. These approaches, that are based on simplified equivalents, do {{not take into account the}} internal time-varying nature of the circuit and in many cases unavoidably lead to a model accuracy that strongly depends on the operating condition of devices. To overcome the above limitations, this thesis proposes an alternative approach to CE assessment based on the mathematical framework developed for time-varying circuits and systems. The proposed method allows for the steady-state prediction of circuit responses directly in the frequency-domain. A topological approach is used, where the original time-varying circuit is suitably replaced by an augmented time-invariant equivalent solved via standard tools for circuit analysis. The new augmented variables in the above equivalent turn out to be the harmonic coefficients of the Fourier series expansion of the corresponding voltage and current variables in the original circuit. A second important contribution in this work is the application of the pro- posed mathematical tool to the modeling of a switching converter and of its CE disturbances from measured data. The converter is seen as a black-box element that is characterized via a limited set of port voltage and current observations, leading to an <b>equivalent</b> augmented <b>admittance</b> fully describing the time-varying nature of the system. Summarizing, this thesis provides a comprehensive theoretical discussion together with several tutorial examples. What is more important, it proposes a novel approach to CE prediction with improvements with respect to state-of-the-art approaches and linear time-invariant surrogates. A real application test case involving a dc-dc boost converter and real measured data is also used to validate the method and stress its features for both numerical simulation and black-box modelin...|$|R

The use of multilayer three dimensional components and circuits makes microwave circuits more compact and the design more flexible. This thesis describes the basic principles and computational procedure for the design of multilayer components such as, planar single and two-level spirals for applications as an inductive elements for RF and MICs, and coupled line band-pass filter circuits consisting of multiple sections. It is shown that both the quality factor and the inductance values can be enhanced by using multilevel spirals. Design methodology for general multisection filter consisting of asymmetric and multiple coupled lines is formulated and presented. It is shown that given the filter specifications, e. g., bandwidth, selectivity, input and output impedances, single, two and multilevel coupled line filters can be physically realized. The design procedure for narrow band filters is formulated in the conventional manner by using the <b>equivalent</b> circuit with <b>admittance</b> inverters and the component values of the low-pass prototype for Butterworth, Chebyshev and other response functions. Examples of Butterworth and Chebyshev multisection filters are included to demonstrate the design procedure. The physical multilevel filter is then optimized by using the SPICE model for coupled multiconductor lines on commercial CAD tool like LIBRA. The optimized multilevel structure design has been validated by MOMENTUM commercial electromagnetic simulator tool. The design methodology is validated by comparing the theoretical results with measurement data for a strip line filter fabricated on FR- 4...|$|R
