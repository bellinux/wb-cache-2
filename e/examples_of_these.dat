5|$|The {{indigenous}} {{tribes of}} Sarawak traditionally used oratory {{to pass on}} their culture {{from one generation to}} the next; <b>examples</b> <b>of</b> <b>these</b> traditional practices include the Iban's Ngajat dances, Renong (Iban vocal repertory), Ensera (Iban oral narratives), and epic storytelling by the Kayan and Kenyah.|$|E
5|$|The major phosphosphingolipids {{of mammals}} are sphingomyelins (ceramide phosphocholines), whereas insects contain mainly ceramide phosphoethanolamines and fungi have phytoceramide phosphoinositols and mannose-containing headgroups. The glycosphingolipids are a diverse family of {{molecules}} composed {{of one or}} more sugar residues linked via a glycosidic bond to the sphingoid base. <b>Examples</b> <b>of</b> <b>these</b> are the simple and complex glycosphingolipids such as cerebrosides and gangliosides.|$|E

5|$|Until recently, {{anthropologists have}} {{dominated}} the study of Navajo textiles. Most historic <b>examples</b> <b>of</b> <b>these</b> works belong to ethnological collections rather than fine art collections, which means items have been exhibited and analyzed {{with an eye toward}} normative or average works rather than emphasizing technical or artistic excellence. These priorities have artificially inflated the market value for items of inferior craftsmanship. In general, this tendency has affected most non-European art to some degree.|$|E
5|$|Early {{vehicles}} were {{built by a}} number of independent companies, but in 1844 the railway started to build carriages at Swindon railway works, which eventually provided most of the railway's rolling stock. Special vehicles included sleeping cars, restaurant cars and slip coaches. Passengers were also carried in railmotors, autotrains, and diesel railcars. Passenger-rated vans carried parcels, horses, and milk at express speeds. Representative <b>examples</b> <b>of</b> <b>these</b> carriages survive in service today on various Heritage railways up and down the country.|$|E
5|$|Educator Daniel Challener, in his 1997 book Stories of Resilience in Childhood, {{analyzed}} {{the events in}} Caged Bird to illustrate resiliency in children. Challener states that Angelou's book provides a useful framework for exploring the obstacles many children like Maya face and how a community helps these children succeed as Angelou did. Psychologist Chris Boyatzis has used Caged Bird to supplement scientific theory and research in the instruction of child development topics such as the development of self-concept and self-esteem, ego resilience, industry versus inferiority, effects of abuse, parenting styles, sibling and friendship relations, gender issues, cognitive development, puberty, and identity formation in adolescence. He has called the book a highly effective tool for providing real-life <b>examples</b> <b>of</b> <b>these</b> psychological concepts.|$|E

5|$|Fine-mapping {{requires}} all variants in {{the associated}} region {{to have been}} genotyped or imputed (dense coverage), very stringent quality control resulting in high-quality genotypes, and large sample sizes sufficient in separating out highly correlated signals. There are several different methods to perform fine-mapping, and all methods produce a posterior probability that a variant in that locus is causal. Because the requirements are often difficult to satisfy, there are still limited <b>examples</b> <b>of</b> <b>these</b> methods being more generally applied.|$|E
5|$|Much of {{what was}} {{included}} in the committee's report consisted of numerous details that the Convention had never discussed but which the committee correctly viewed as uncontroversial and unlikely to be challenged; and as such, much of the committee's proposal would ultimately be incorporated into {{the final version of the}} Constitution without debate. <b>Examples</b> <b>of</b> <b>these</b> details included the Speech and Debate Clause, which grants members of Congress immunity for comments made in their jobs, and the rules for organizing the House of Representatives and the Senate.|$|E
5|$|Some {{players who}} participated in the 2000 Sugar Bowl elected to delay their entry into the NFL Draft, either because they hoped to finish their {{education}} or because they were not three years removed from their high school graduations and thus were not eligible to enter the draft. <b>Examples</b> <b>of</b> <b>these</b> players included Florida State quarterback Chris Weinke, who returned to Florida State to complete his senior year, and Virginia Tech quarterback Michael Vick, who was not eligible to enter the draft in 2000, but who was taken with the first overall selection in the 2001 NFL Draft.|$|E

5|$|Sports such as polo do {{not judge}} the horse itself, but rather use the horse {{as a partner}} for human {{competitors}} as {{a necessary part of}} the game. Although the horse requires specialized training to participate, the details of its performance are not judged, only the result of the rider's actions—be it getting a ball through a goal or some other task. <b>Examples</b> <b>of</b> <b>these</b> sports of partnership between human and horse include jousting, in which the main goal is for one rider to unseat the other, and buzkashi, a team game played throughout Central Asia, the aim being to capture a goat carcass while on horseback.|$|E
5|$|The {{evolution}} of galaxies can be significantly affected by interactions and collisions. Mergers of galaxies were common {{during the early}} epoch, {{and the majority of}} galaxies were peculiar in morphology. Given the distances between the stars, the great majority of stellar systems in colliding galaxies will be unaffected. However, gravitational stripping of the interstellar gas and dust that makes up the spiral arms produces a long train of stars known as tidal tails. <b>Examples</b> <b>of</b> <b>these</b> formations can be seen in NGC 4676 or the Antennae Galaxies.|$|E
5|$|The oldest dinosaur embryos ever {{discovered}} {{were found}} in the park in 1978. The eggs were from the Triassic Period (220 to 195 million years ago) and had fossilised foetal skeletons of Massospondylus, a prosauropod dinosaur. More <b>examples</b> <b>of</b> <b>these</b> eggs have since been found in the park. Other fossils found in the park include those of advanced cynodontia (canine toothed animals), small thecodontia (animals with teeth set firmly in the jaw), bird-like and crocodile-like dinosaurs.|$|E

5|$|Wind {{causes the}} {{generation}} of sound. The movement of air causes movements of parts of natural objects, such as leaves or grass. These objects will produce sound if they touch each other. Even a soft wind will cause {{a low level of}} environmental noise. If the wind is blowing harder, it may produce howling sounds of varying frequencies. This may be caused by the wind blowing over cavities, or by vortices created in the air downstream of an object. Especially on high buildings, many structural parts may be a cause of annoying noise at certain wind conditions. <b>Examples</b> <b>of</b> <b>these</b> parts are balconies, ventilation openings, roof openings or cables.|$|E
5|$|In {{parts of}} the range, the russet sparrow inhabits towns, and in most of its range, it occurs near cultivation, and is a minor pest of agriculture. Though it damages crops, it also feeds its nestlings largely on insect pests. In China, the russet sparrow has been {{recorded}} as a captive bird, kept with the Eurasian tree sparrow. In Japan it was eaten in the 1870s and sold in the Yokohama game market. The russet sparrow is known well enough in the Himalayas that in most languages it has a different vernacular name from the Eurasian tree sparrow. <b>Examples</b> <b>of</b> <b>these</b> vernacular names include lal gouriya in Hindi and kang-che-go-ma in Tibetan. The Japanese artist Hokusai portrayed the russet sparrow, and due to this, it has appeared on postage stamps featuring Japanese art in Japan, The Gambia, and Guyana.|$|E
5|$|Private flying is most {{associated}} with the traditional form of factory-produced two and four-seater, single piston-engine training and touring aircraft. <b>Examples</b> <b>of</b> <b>these</b> are the Cessna 152, Cessna 172, and Piper PA28 Cherokee, all with their origins in the 1950s, and the more modern designs of Cirrus. The average cost per hour to fly such aircraft has been estimated to be £133, compared to an estimated £77 per hour for gliders, and a reported £35 per hour for microlights. Recent trends have seen {{an increase in the}} use of microlights, and also in recreational helicopter flying following the introduction of smaller and cheaper machines such as the Robinson R22 and R44. Another growth area in private flying {{in recent years has been}} in the use of amateur built aircraft, such as the Van's Aircraft RV-4 and the Europa.|$|E

5|$|The NASL all-star teams {{selected}} by the league {{at the end of}} each season included a total of 18 Cosmos players. These include numerous well-known players from outside the United States, signed from European or South American clubs. <b>Examples</b> <b>of</b> <b>these</b> are erstwhile West Germany captain Franz Beckenbauer and the former Brazil international players Pelé and Carlos Alberto; there were many others. Among the American players representing the Cosmos were two players born in Yugoslavia: U.S. international defender Werner Roth and Siegfried Stritzl, a midfielder. Canada international John Kerr, originally from Scotland, also turned out for New York during the early 1970s. Former Italy forward Giorgio Chinaglia holds many of the side's records pertaining to individual performance, appearing in the most matches, scoring the most goals and points, and sharing the record for most all-star appearances (six) with Vladislav Bogićević, a member of the Yugoslavia national team before his time with the Cosmos.|$|E
5|$|The cytosol has {{no single}} {{function}} and is instead {{the site of}} multiple cell processes. <b>Examples</b> <b>of</b> <b>these</b> processes include signal transduction from the cell membrane to sites within the cell, such as the cell nucleus, or organelles. This compartment is also the site {{of many of the}} processes of cytokinesis, after the breakdown of the nuclear membrane in mitosis. Another major function of cytosol is to transport metabolites from their site of production to where they are used. This is relatively simple for water-soluble molecules, such as amino acids, which can diffuse rapidly through the cytosol. However, hydrophobic molecules, such as fatty acids or sterols, can be transported through the cytosol by specific binding proteins, which shuttle these molecules between cell membranes. Molecules taken into the cell by endocytosis or on their way to be secreted can also be transported through the cytosol inside vesicles, which are small spheres of lipids that are moved along the cytoskeleton by motor proteins.|$|E
5|$|Various beetles in the Bostrichoidea {{superfamily}} {{attack the}} dry, seasoned wood used as structural timber in houses {{and to make}} furniture. In most cases, it is the larvae that do the damage; these are invisible from {{the outside of the}} timber, but are chewing away at the wood in the interior of the item. <b>Examples</b> <b>of</b> <b>these</b> are the powderpost beetles, which attack the sapwood of hardwoods, and the furniture beetles, which attacks softwoods, including plywood. The damage has already been done by the time the adult beetles bore their way out, leaving neat round holes behind them. The first that a householder knows about the beetle damage is often when a chair leg breaks off or a piece of structural timber caves in. Prevention is through chemical treatment of the timber prior to its use in construction or in furniture manufacture.|$|E
