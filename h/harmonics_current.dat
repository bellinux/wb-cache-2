40|$|The {{harmonic}} impact {{caused by}} wind turbines should be carefully investigated before wind turbines are interconnected. However, the <b>harmonic</b> <b>currents</b> of wind turbines {{are not easily}} predicted due to the variations of wind speed. If the <b>harmonic</b> <b>current</b> outputs can be predicted accurately, the harmonic impact of wind turbines and wind farms for power grids can be analyzed efficiently. Therefore, this paper analyzes the <b>harmonic</b> <b>current</b> characteristics of wind turbines and investigates the feasibility of developing <b>harmonic</b> <b>current</b> predictors. Field measurement, data sorting, and analysis are conducted for wind turbines. Two <b>harmonic</b> <b>current</b> predictors are proposed {{based on the measured}} harmonic data.

The other is the stochastic <b>harmonic</b> <b>current</b> predictor considering the probability density distributions of <b>harmonic</b> <b>currents.</b> It uses the measured harmonic data to establish the probability density distributions of <b>harmonic</b> <b>currents</b> at different wind speeds, and then uses them to implement a long-term <b>harmonic</b> <b>current</b> prediction.
