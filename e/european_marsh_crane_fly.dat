50|$|The common European <b>crane</b> <b>fly,</b> Tipula paludosa, and the <b>marsh</b> <b>crane</b> <b>fly,</b> T. oleracea, are {{agricultural}} pests in Europe. <b>Crane</b> <b>fly</b> larvae of economic importance {{live in the}} top layers of soil where they feed on the roots, root hairs, crown, and, sometimes the leaves of crops, stunting their growth or killing the plants. They are pests {{on a variety of}} commodities. Since the late 1900s, T. paludosa and T. oleracea have become invasive in the United States. The larvae have been observed on many crops, including vegetables, fruits, cereals, pasture, lawn grasses, and ornamental plants.|$|R
40|$|The European <b>crane</b> <b>fly</b> (ECF), Tipula paludosa Meigen (Diptera: Tipulidae), {{has been}} {{reported}} in several new sites in North America recently, and has been described as an insect pest on golf courses in several areas. This study was conducted from 2003 and 2004 on four golf courses located in the Québec City area (Canada) with the objectives to identity Tipulidae assemblages to species level and to determine the spatial distribution and temporal occurrence of the ECF. Larvae, pupae and adults were scouted weekly from May to early Oct. A total of 35 species of Tipulidae,' representing four genera, were identified. Two new species were recorded for Québec, Nephrotoma cornicina L., and the <b>Marsh</b> <b>crane</b> <b>fly</b> Tipula oleracea L. ECF was the predominant species found on all sites, accounting for 43 - 92 % {{of the total number of}} specimens collected at each golf course. ECF completed one generation per year. In our study, the fourth larval instar was sampled from mid-May to early Sept and adult peak emergence occurred during mid-Sept. Larval density varied among golf course management areas, with larvae being uncommon on tees and greens and most abundant on roughs. A principal component analysis using varimax rotation showed that larval abundance was positively related to silt, clay, Ca, Cu, K, and Mg, and negatively related to sand and uncompressed thatch thickness. This study indicates that the ECF is currently the only Tipulidae species causing turfgrass damage on golf courses in Québec...|$|R
40|$|Two sub-adult {{whooping}} cranes (Grus americana) wintered in {{the coastal}} marsh and grain fields of Brazoria County, Texas, {{during the winter of}} 1985 - 86. Observations were made on 59 days during the 75 day period the cranes were present. During December and January the whooping cranes primarily fed in waste corn fields. During February and March they fed primarily in brakish <b>marshes.</b> The whooping <b>cranes</b> <b>flew</b> over a tall electric transmission line a minimum of 80 times during the winter. To prevent the two whooping cranes from eating seed corn treated with pesticides it was necessary to haze the cranes on 5 separate dates. The whooping cranes began their northward migration on 31 March 1986...|$|R

50|$|Stibadocera is a genus of <b>crane</b> <b>fly</b> in {{the family}} Tipulidae. Stibadocera are unusual for <b>crane</b> <b>flies</b> in that the males have very long antenna, {{sometimes}} {{as long as the}} body. Most species are very small (6-10 mm).|$|R
