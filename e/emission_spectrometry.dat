50|$|Hydride {{generation}} {{techniques are}} specialized in solutions of specific elements. The technique {{provides a means}} of introducing samples containing arsenic, antimony, tin, selenium, bismuth, and lead into an atomizer in the gas phase. With these elements, hydride atomization enhances detection limits {{by a factor of}} 10 to 100 compared to alternative methods. Hydride generation occurs by adding an acidified aqueous solution of the sample to a 1% aqueous solution of sodium borohydride, all of which is contained in a glass vessel. The volatile hydride generated by the reaction that occurs is swept into the atomization chamber by an inert gas, where it undergoes decomposition. This process forms an atomized form of the analyte, which can then be measured by absorption or <b>emission</b> <b>spectrometry.</b>|$|E

40|$|Abstract. A {{simple method}} for the {{analysis}} of stainless steel samples is presented which is based on radioisotope excited energy dispersive X-ray fluorescence (EDXRF) spectrometry and does not require any type-standards. Both absorption and enhancement effects have been taken into account in the fundamental parameter method for quantitative analysis and an iterative approach is followed for calculation of concentrations in steel samples. Non-linear least square fitting (NL-LSF) procedures have been used to determine accurately the fluorescent peak intensities. The method has been tested by analysing several CRM standard reference samples and 304 and 316 steel samples assuming as unknown. The EDXRF results have also been compared with the results of analysis of same samples by vacuum <b>emission</b> spark <b>spectrometry</b> (VES).

50|$|Analytical {{chemistry}} has applications {{including in}} forensic science, bioanalysis, clinical analysis, environmental analysis, and materials analysis. Analytical chemistry research is largely driven by performance (sensitivity, detection limit, selectivity, robustness, dynamic range, linear range, accuracy, precision, and speed), and cost (purchase, operation, training, time, and space). Among the main branches of contemporary analytical atomic spectrometry, {{the most widespread}} and universal are optical and mass spectrometry. In the direct elemental analysis of solid samples, the new leaders are laser-induced breakdown and laser ablation mass spectrometry, and the related techniques with transfer of the laser ablation products into inductively coupled plasma. Advances in design of diode lasers and optical parametric oscillators promote developments in fluorescence and ionization spectrometry and also in absorption techniques where uses of optical cavities for increased effective absorption pathlength are expected to expand. The use of plasma- and laser-based methods is increasing. An interest towards absolute (standardless) analysis has revived, particularly in <b>emission</b> <b>spectrometry.</b>|$|E
5000|$|Laser-induced {{breakdown}} spectroscopy (LIBS) {{is a type}} {{of atomic}} emission spectroscopy which uses a highly energetic laser pulse as the excitation source. The laser is focused to form a plasma, which atomizes and excites samples. The formation of the plasma only begins when the focused laser achieves a certain threshold for optical breakdown, which generally depends on the environment and the target material. [...] In principle, LIBS can analyze any matter regardless of its physical state, be it solid, liquid or gas. Because all elements emit light of characteristic frequencies when excited to sufficiently high temperatures, LIBS can (in principle) detect all elements, limited only by the power of the laser as well as the sensitivity and wavelength range of the spectrograph & detector. If the constituents of a material to be analyzed are known, LIBS may be used to evaluate the relative abundance of each constituent element, or to monitor the presence of impurities. In practice, detection limits are a function of a) the plasma excitation temperature, b) the light collection window, and c) the line strength of the viewed transition. LIBS makes use of optical <b>emission</b> <b>spectrometry</b> and is to this extent very similar to arc/spark emission spectroscopy.|$|E

50|$|The {{examination}} of the Nahal Hemar artifacts included: 1. All the plaster statue fragments and plaster beads were examined under a Wild M-8 stereoscopic microscope under oblique illumination. This was used in order to roughly define the homogeneity of the samples. 2. Tiny lumps of plaster {{were removed from the}} items on several locations using a diamonds saw, spatulas, and fine drills bits. Chips with the film casting pigments were sampled in several cases for chemical analyses of straining materials. They used broken artifacts in most cases to prevent further damage to the remaining artifacts. 3. Bulk samples were subjected to Thin-Section Petrographic Analysis (TSPA). 4. Mineralogical analyses of the non calcareous components were carried out to more samples, in which the admixture of clay was observed by the TSPA analysis. The samples were powdered and soaked in 3% HCl to remove the carbonate ingredients and the clay mineralogy was determined by X-Ray Diffraction (XRD). 5. Chemical analyses were done on most samples using Inductively Coupled Plasma Atomic <b>Emission</b> <b>Spectrometry</b> (ICP-AES). The benefit of this method is that it has high accuracy with low limits of detection. 6. Small lumps that were coated with yellow, green, red, or dark pigments were removed from the plaster statue and beads and used for X-Ray Fluorescence (XRF) analysis, which provided a chemical definition of the pigment materials.|$|E
50|$|Some assay {{methods are}} {{suitable}} for raw materials; others are more appropriate for finished goods. Raw precious metals (bullion) are assayed by an assay office. Silver is assayed by titration, gold by cupellation and platinum by inductively coupled plasma optical <b>emission</b> <b>spectrometry</b> (ICP OES).Precious metal items of art or jewelry are frequently hallmarked (depending upon {{the requirements of the}} laws of either the place of manufacture or the place of import). Where required to be hallmarked, semi-finished precious metal items of art or jewelry pass through the official testing channels where they are analyzed or assayed for precious metal content. While different nations permit a variety of legally acceptable finenesses, the assayer is actually testing to determine that the fineness of the product conforms with the statement or claim of fineness that the maker has claimed (usually by stamping a number such as 750 for 18k gold) on the item. In the past the assay was conducted by using the touchstone method but currently (most often) it is done using X-ray fluorescence (XRF). XRF is used because this method is more exacting than the touchstone test. The most exact method of assay is known as fire assay or cupellation. This method is better suited for the assay of bullion and gold stocks rather than works of art or jewelry because it is a completely destructive method.|$|E

Herein a direct and modular methodology is presented that provides rapid access to well-defined carbon–rhodium hybrid catalysts. A pre-synthesized Rh(I) complex containing a carbene-triazole ligand {{was found to be}} stable for direct immobilization onto unactivated graphene, carbon black and glassy carbon electrodes.

Tillers of C. zizanioides were grown in a hydroponic culture for 3 weeks under controlled conditions and then exposed to Hg for 10 days with or without the addition of the chelators (NH(4)) (2) S(2) O(3) or KI. These treatments were used to study the effects of these chelators on localization of Hg in the root tissues to allow better understanding of Hg uptake during its assisted-phytoextraction. Qualitative elemental micro-PIXE analysis revealed that Hg was mainly localized in the root epidermis and exodermis, tissues containing suberin in all Hg treatments. Hg at trace levels was localized in the vascular bundle when plants were treated with a mercury solution only. However, higher Hg concentrations were found when the solution also contained (NH(4)) (2) S(2) O(3) or KI. This finding is consistent with the observed increase in Hg translocation to the aerial parts of the plants in the case of chemically induced Hg phytoextraction.

At their optimum dosages, 36 ACH/polyDADMAC gave higher colour removal than FeCl 3 (45 % cf. 28 %), whereas COD reduction 37 was similar (~ 30 %), indicating preferential removal of melanoidins (a major contributor to the 38 colour) by ACH/polyDADMAC. Size exclusion chromatography and fluorescence excitation 39 <b>emission</b> matrix <b>spectrometry</b> suggested that chromophoric Fe-organic complexes were formed 40 during FeCl 3 treatment of the molasses wastewater, which appeared to compromise 41 decolourisation efficiency.
