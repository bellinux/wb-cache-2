50|$|Deoxidization is {{a method}} used in {{metallurgy}} to remove the oxygen content during steel manufacturing. In contrast, antioxidants are used for stabilization, {{such as in the}} storage of food. <b>Deoxidation</b> is important in the steelmaking process as oxygen is often detrimental to the quality of steel produced. Deoxidization is mainly achieved by adding a separate chemical species to neutralize the effects of oxygen or by directly removing the oxygen.|$|E
50|$|During the German-Soviet War, N. Dobrokhotov {{offers to}} hold {{ferromanganese}} <b>deoxidation</b> of boiling steel in the ladle, that was implemented in 1942 {{in one of}} the Ural plants. This method saved a large amount of ferromanganese, since when steel is deoxidized in the furnace of about 50% of it oxidized and was lost with the slag. For that time when as a result of military actions was lost main extraction base of manganese ore, this fact was of great importance.|$|E
50|$|Deoxidized {{steel is}} steel {{that has some}} or all of the oxygen removed from the melt during the {{steelmaking}} process. Liquid steels contain dissolved oxygen after their conversion from molten iron, but the solubility of oxygen in steel decreases with cooling. As steel cools, excess oxygen can cause blowholes or precipitate FeO. Therefore, several strategies have been developed for <b>deoxidation.</b> This may be accomplished by adding metallic deoxidizing agents to the melt either before or after it is tapped, or by vacuum treatment, in which carbon dissolved in the steel is the deoxidizer.|$|E

50|$|Titanium {{is used in}} {{steelmaking}} for <b>deoxidation,</b> grain-size control, {{and carbon}} and nitrogen control and stabilization. During steelmaking, titanium is usually introduced as ferrotitanium because of its relatively low melting temperature and high density. Steels with relatively high titanium content include interstitial-free, stainless and high-strength low-alloy steels. Ferrotitanium is usually produced by induction melting of titanium scrap with iron or steel; however, it also is produced directly from titanium mineral concentrates. The standard grades of ferrotitanium are 30% and 70% titanium. Ferrosilicon-titanium also is produced to allow the simultaneous addition of silicon and titanium. The leading ferrotitanium producing countries include Brazil, China, India, Japan, Russia, Ukraine, United Kingdom and the United States.|$|E

50|$|This section {{contains}} {{a series of}} interactive simulations of major steelmaking processes from raw materials, Basic oxygen steelmaking (BOS) and Electric arc furnace (EAF) steelmaking, secondary steelmaking, Continuous casting and Hot rolling. Different steel grades can be processed using two levels of operation which are suitable for students and graduates in the industry. The ‘student level’ provides a basic functionality enabling the user to understand and control the process principles without too many operational complications, whereas the ‘industry level’ has advanced functionality and the user needs to deal with practical disturbances that are not anticipated in advance. Real-time feedback is given on the composition {{and quality of the}} steel, on process time and temperature and incurred costs, to allow the process to be optimized. A user guide and more conventional supporting e-learning units are also available within each module to enable the learner to better understand the reactions. For example, in the secondary steelmaking module, there are sections on <b>deoxidation,</b> desulphurization, decarburization and dehydrogenation.|$|E

40|$|The <b>deoxidation</b> {{of steel}} with complex deoxidisers was studied at 1550 °C and {{compared}} with silicon, aluminium and silicon/aluminium alloys as standards. The <b>deoxidation</b> alloy systems, Ca/Si/Al, Mg/Si/Al and Mn/Si/Al, {{were chosen for}} the low liquidus temperatures of many of their oxide mixtures and the potential deoxidising power of their constituent elements. Product separation rates and compositional relationships following <b>deoxidation</b> were examined. Silicon/aluminium alloy <b>deoxidation</b> resulted in the product compositions and residual oxygen contents expected from equilibrium and stoichiometric considerations, but with the Ca/Si/Al and Mg/Si/Al alloys the volatility of calcium and magnesium prevented them participating in the final solute equilibrium, despite their reported solubility in liquid iron. Electron-probe microanalysis of the products showed various concentrations of lime and magnesia, possibly resulting from reaction between the metal vapours and dissolved oxygen. The consequent reduction of silica activity in the products due {{to the presence of}} CaO and hgO produced an indirect effect of calcium and magnesium on the residual oxygen content. Product separation rates, indicated by vacuum fusion analyses, were not significantly influenced by calcium and magnesium but the rapid separation of products having a high Al 2 O 3 Si 02 ratio was confirmed.

There are typical types of defects at massive steel castings, as contrasted to „ordinary“ internal and surface ones. For massive steel castings are typical defects under feeders like conchoidal fractures, segregations, microporesities, reoxidation products. Combination of Al and Zr is an ordinary final <b>deoxidation</b> of EOP and LF steel for castings in ŽĎAS a. s. foundry. The aim of Al + Zr combination was to both deep <b>deoxidation</b> by Al (decrease of bubbles risk) and denitrification by Zr (decrease of conchoidal fractures).

40|$|To keep up {{with the}} tough {{competition}} today {{and to be able to}} offer the customers competitive prices, it is desirable to shorten the ladle treatment and still keep a high quality of the product. To be able to shorten the ladle treatment under these restrictions, faster <b>deoxidation</b> process is demanded. This master’s thesis investigates what influences the reaction coefficient, which describes the separation rate of oxygen. A higher reaction coefficient indicates a fast separation rate. Special attention has been taken to the factor reoxidation, with regard to the nitrogen pick up after tapping and an increase of the oxygen content after degassing. The reaction coefficient has been calculated for four steel groups, two silicon deoxidised groups, one silicon and aluminium deoxidised group and one aluminium deoxidised steel group. The apparent <b>deoxidation</b> is in the reality the sum of two phenomena: <b>deoxidation</b> and reoxidation. An increase of the <b>deoxidation</b> rate or a decrease of the reoxidation rate would result in a higher k-value. A small increase of the reaction coefficient could gain minutes in the process of oxygen removal, which would result in economical benefits. The deoxidisers have naturally a strong effect on the oxygen content and thus on the reaction coefficient. The fastest separation – highest reaction coefficient – after tapping is found for steel groups deoxidised with the strongest deoxidiser: aluminium. Reoxidation occurs after tapping/before degassing due to the breakthrough eye caused by the strong gas injection. By using nitrogen as a tracer for reoxdiation from the atmosphere it was possible to determine if reoxidation had an effect on the <b>deoxidation</b> rate, which it had since the reaction coefficient decreases as the nitrogen content increases. Stirring makes <b>deoxidation</b> quicker, but on the other hand, too intensive stirring retards the <b>deoxidation</b> rate somewhat due to reoxidation. An optimisation of the gas flow rate might be useful to get an optimum relation between <b>deoxidation</b> and reoxdiation, where the fastest separation of oxides is achieved. The deoxidisers have an effect on the oxygen content after degassing and in the tundish. Reoxidation can occur during these time steps too, but most probably not due to reactions with the atmosphere, since the nitrogen content is stable. The oxygen content increases for the silicon deoxidised heats after degassing due to a higher iron oxide content in the top slag. Thus, the FeO content in the slag is too high to keep the low oxygen content in the steel stable. The heats with higher amount of deoxidisers in the steel tend to be able to stay at a lower oxygen concentration too. Though, in the later parts of the process additional alumina formation should be avoided for the best separation. Validerat; 20101217 (root...|$|E
