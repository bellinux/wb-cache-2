5|$|Although Project Alberta had no attack orders, it {{proceeded}} {{with the plan}} to have the Little Boy ready by 1 August 1945 and the first Fat Man ready for use {{as soon as possible}} after that. In the meantime, a series of twelve combat missions were flown between 20 and 29 July against targets in Japan using high-explosive Pumpkin bombs. Project Alberta's Sheldon Dike and Milo Bolstead flew on some of these missions, as did the British observer Group Captain Leonard Cheshire. One serious incident occurred when a Pumpkin bomb was released in the bomb bay of the B-29 Strange Cargo while it was taxiing. The bomb fell through the closed bomb bay doors onto the taxiway. The plane came to a halt <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>shower</b> <b>of</b> sparks, but fire fighters doused the plane and the bomb in foam, and the bomb did not explode. The aircraft had to be jacked up to remove the bomb.|$|E
25|$|Due to his {{reputation}} for bravery, Modu began to gather a group of extremely loyal warriors. To be sure of their loyalty, Modu ordered each of the warriors to shoot his favourite horse. Those who refused were executed. He later repeated this test of loyalty, but {{with one of his}} favourite wives, and once again executed those who hesitated to obey his order. After he was sure of the loyalty of his remaining warriors, he ordered them to shoot at his father, killing him <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>shower</b> <b>of</b> arrows. With none of his followers failing to shoot at his command and the elimination of his father, Modu proclaimed himself Chanyu of the Xiongnu.|$|E
25|$|On to the Adelaide Oval, {{or rather}} {{not as the}} SACA ringed off the famously long curves, much to the {{disappointment}} of those who liked seeing all-run fives when batsmen hit a straight-drive. South Australia had not won the Sheffield Shield for ten years, but were to do so again in 1963-64 {{with the help of}} their multi-talented import Gary Sobers. They were captained by the old favourite Les Favell and had a 19-year-old Ian Chappell in the team, but their Chinaman bowler David Sincock was unable to play because of his exams. The Melbourne Cup was due to be played during the match, so Ted Dexter and the Duke were off to the races and Colin Cowdrey was in charge. Favell won the toss, batted, and saw his side make steady progress to 324/7 {{by the end of the}} day. Favell was first out for 7 and his fellow-opener John Causby was run out by Ken Barrington and wicket-keeper Alan Smith for 16, but John Lill (87) and Gary Sobers (42) stroked their way to a third-wicket stand of 113 before they were both out on 154, along with Neil Dansie for a duck and South Australia were 154/4. Ian McLachlan (53) and Ian Chappell (36) added 66 before the youngster tripped over himself while hooking Brian Statham and hit the wicket with his bat. Statham (4/58) cleared up the tail with 3 wickets for 11 runs and South Australia were out for 335. Fred Titmus (1/80) and Ray Illingworth (0/43) failed to turn the ball on the notoriously flat wicket and Cowdrey set up defensive fields which rather relied on the batsmen getting themselves out, still the runs flowed enough and the crowd enjoyed themselves. Cowdrey was out for this third consecutive duck when acting as opener, but everybody else had a fine time; Geoff Pullar (21) added 55 for the second-wicket with Ken Barrington (102), who added another 168 with the stylish Tom Graveney (99), beating the third-wicket record for the MCC vs South Australia set by Plum Warner and George Gunn in 1911-12. Graveney was the more polished of the two, but Barrington hit Neil Hawke (6/130) for 4 boundaries in five balls. They and Peter Parfitt (15) were all out by 257/5, but the depth of the MCC batting was shown by Fred Titmus who hit a solid 137 not out, his highest first class century, adding 108 runs with Barry Knight (55) and 121 with wicket-keeper Alan Smith (another 55) and Cowdrey declared on 508/9. South Australia knocked off the 173 run deficit the same day, making 174/5 by stumps, with Sobers (99) run out by Statham going for his 100th run and everybody else chipping <b>in.</b> <b>A</b> <b>shower</b> <b>of</b> rain allowed everybody to get off the field to watch the Melbourne Cup and Favell declared on 283/7 to leave the MCC 67 minutes to make 111 runs. They made 95/1, thanks to some quick hitting by Pullar (56), but after playing into more rain they gave up 16 runs short in an affable, but farcical end. On a flat wicket with indifferent bowling the teams made 1,221 runs in four days despite the rain.|$|E

500|$|There was {{an intense}} {{transitory}} burst of fireball radiation lasting a few seconds. Many of the closer ships received doses of neutron and gamma radiation {{that could have}} been lethal to anyone on the ship, but the ships themselves did not become radioactive. Neutron activation of materials in the ships was judged to be a minor problem {{by the standards of the}} time. One sailor on the support ship [...] was found to be [...] "sleeping <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>shower</b> <b>of</b> gamma rays" [...] from an illegal metal souvenir he had taken from a target ship. Fireball neutrons had made it radioactive. Within a day nearly all the surviving target ships had been reboarded.

500|$|Prior to the broadcast, Parker and Stone said [...] "Damien" [...] {{would be}} the first episode in which Kenny would not be killed; ultimately, however, Kenny was shot by Jimbo {{at the end of the}} {{pay-per-view}} fight. Kenny is turned into a duck-billed platypus in the episode, which Parker said was done because, [...] "Duck billed platypuses are something I've always been infatuated with. They're just so bizarre." [...] In the original script, Pip, the unpopular British student inspired by the character of the same name in Charles Dickens's Great Expectations, was originally supposed to be killed and permanently removed from the show after [...] "Damien", in which Damien projects Pip into the air and blows him up <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>shower</b> <b>of</b> fireworks. However, Parker and Stone decided they should not kill any student characters except for Kenny, so they decided not to kill Pip and to bring him back for future episodes.|$|E

He is huge and weighs a little over , while Jesus weighs a mere , and the {{citizens}} of South Park begin changing their bets. Jesus confronts the South Park residents about their changed betting slips after learning only one person is still betting on Jesus to win. Distraught, Jesus asks Stan, Kyle and Chef to help him train. Damien gets counseling from Mr. Mackey, who recommends he just try being nice {{no matter what the}} other children do, just like with unpopular British child Pip. Damien tries to apologize to the boys for setting fire to the playground and turning Kenny into a duck-billed platypus, stating that he was [...] "doing his father's bidding" [...] and {{he did not have a}} choice. The boys, however, still continue to act negatively towards Damien. Cartman's birthday party begins, as does the fight. Damien and Pip arrive uninvited to the party, but the children finally accept Damien after he hurls Pip in the air and makes him explode <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>shower</b> <b>of</b> fireworks. However, a furious Cartman ends his party early after opening Kyle's present to discover that it's not what he had in mind.|$|E

500|$|After Cassie's parents {{leave for}} a Halloween party and later that night, The Evil Thing {{is brought to}} life by Max's thoughts, and captures him, Priscilla and a Papa John's Pizza {{delivery}} man. It is up to Cassie and Sean (Cody Linley), a popular boy who Cassie likes, to save them. At first, they try to defeat The Evil Thing on their own, but fail. Cassie then asks {{the owner of the}} shop, where she bought the book, for help. Cassie discovers that the store owner travels around the world each Halloween, searching for a person who loves to scare people the most and tricks them into reading the book aloud, releasing The Evil Thing, possibly in order to teach them a lesson. He leaves them with the riddle [...] "two heads are better than one; that's the way to get the bloody job done" [...] before his shop disappears. After he disappears, Sean solves the riddle. Together, they formulate that if they get blood from a roast that Cassie's mother made and throw it onto The Evil Thing, it will be forced to suck up the blood. In doing so, it will devour itself. [...] While they plan their attack, The Evil Thing's babies hatch and tries to eat the victims. Luckily, Sean and Cassie make it in time. By using Sean's CD of monster sound effects, they are able to lure the monster to the CD player; however, when the monster nudges it, the music turns into hip hop, thus ruining their plan. While fumbling, Sean and Cassie accidentally drop the blood near Max, who must conquer his fears. When Cassie encourages him, Max tosses the blood onto The Evil Thing, causing its heads to begin attacking each other. The monster eats itself, eventually exploding <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>shower</b> <b>of</b> yellow blood, killing itself and its offspring.|$|E
500|$|The {{show was}} mainly {{divided into four}} acts with {{different}} themes: The Circus, House of Fun (Anything Goes), FreakshowPeepshow, Electro Circ and ended with the encore. It began with [...] "Welcome to the Circus", a video introduction featuring Perez Hilton as Queen Elizabeth I. In {{the middle of the}} video, the cylinder screen started to rise, while Spears appeared on the video and shot Hilton with a crossbow, causing him to fall backwards onto the floor. As the video ended, Spears descended from the ceiling on a suspended platform, wearing the headdress, a ringmaster jacket, black shorts, high-heeled boots and carrying a whip. She started with a performance of [...] "Circus", which featured acrobats taking the stage and spun on giant rings in the air. The song ended with Spears taking off her ringleader jacket to reveal the Swaroski-crystal corset and running {{into the center of the}} main stage, as she was surrounded by jets of smoke. She entered a golden cage, where she performed [...] "Piece of Me", dancing and attempting to escape from her dancers. A brief interlude followed, featuring a performance by acrobats twirling from suspended fabric, simulating a thunderstorm. before Spears went into [...] "Radar" [...] which featured her pole dancing on each of the stage's rings. [...] The first intermezzo showcased her dancers doing a martial arts inspired dance to the LAZRtag remix of [...] "Gimme More". In the next section, Ed Alonzo took the stage and Spears [...] played her assistant in [...] "Ooh Ooh Baby" [...] entering a box and being sawed in half. After she came out, she entered another box in the middle of the stage and the performance ended with Alonzo dropping the curtains and showing that Spears had escaped from it, while the top of the box exploded <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>shower</b> <b>of</b> sparks. At the same time, Spears reappeared with four female dancers in one of the satellite stages, dancing to [...] "Hot as Ice". The next song was the Co-Ed Remix of [...] "Boys", which Spears performed wearing a military costume, while surrounded by her dancers, some of them riding bicycles. At the end of the song she performed a military drill with her male dancers before moving into [...] "If U Seek Amy", which featured her pushing them with a giant pink mallet, in a similar way to Whac-A-Mole. After a brief interlude, she [...] returned to continue the act with a Bollywood-inspired remix of [...] "Me Against the Music". She briefly talked with the audience before she sat on a giant umbrella and was lifted into the air to perform [...] "Everytime".|$|E
