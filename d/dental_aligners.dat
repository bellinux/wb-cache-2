30|$|Laser {{scanners}} (structured light scanners) {{are used}} by both systems to acquire images of the plaster casts. Nuvola® system uses a dedicated software, NUVOLA CAD 3 D (a CAD plug-in from Rhinoceros, Robert McNeel & Associates, Rome, Italy), while Fantasmino® system uses a software CAD created by Ortolab Pompei (Pompei Napoli, Italy). The images acquired need to be converted into STL format, a file format used in CAD stereolithography. The STL format represents a solid (in this case the patient’s plaster casts) through a mesh of triangles in a 3 D environment. This conversion is necessary to rapid prototyping [16], which is an additional technique where a resinous material is apposed layer by layer. Starting from {{the images of the}} patient’s dental casts, processed as explained above, the desired orthodontic movements are planned and divided into subsequent phases. For each phase, a model of the virtual set-up is printed through rapid prototyping. These models are used to create a series of <b>dental</b> <b>aligners,</b> thanks to a thermoforming process.|$|E

An aligner-based treatment requires patients to sequentially wear dentition-mating shells obtained by thermoforming polymeric disks on reference <b>dental</b> models. An <b>aligner</b> is shaped introducing a geometrical mismatch {{with respect to}} the actual tooth positions to induce a loading system, which moves the target teeth toward the correct positions. The common practice is based on selecting the aligner features (material, thickness, and auxiliary elements) by only considering clinician's subjective assessments. In this article, a computational design and engineering methodology has been developed to reconstruct anatomical tissues, to model parametric aligner shapes, to simulate orthodontic movements, and to enhance the aligner design. The proposed approach integrates computer-aided technologies, from tomographic imaging to optical scanning, from parametric modeling to finite element analyses, within a 3 -dimensional digital framework. The anatomical modeling provides anatomies, including teeth (roots and crowns), jaw bones, and periodontal ligaments, which are the references for the down streaming parametric aligner shaping. The biomechanical interactions between anatomical models and aligner geometries are virtually reproduced using a finite element analysis software. The methodology allows numerical simulations of patient-specific conditions and the comparative analyses of different aligner configurations. In this article, the digital framework has been used to study the influence of various auxiliary elements on the loading system delivered to a maxillary and a mandibular central incisor during an orthodontic tipping movement. Numerical simulations have shown a high dependency of the orthodontic tooth movement on the auxiliary element configuration, which should then be accurately selected to maximize the aligner's effectiveness...|$|R
