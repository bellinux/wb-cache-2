Objective: Data on the impact {{of childhood}} life events and childhood trauma on the clinical course of depressive and anxiety disorders are limited. Method: Longitudinal data were collected from 1209 adult participants in the Netherlands Study of Depression and Anxiety (NESDA). Childhood life events and trauma at baseline were assessed with a semi-structured interview and the clinical course after 2 years with a DSM-IV-based diagnostic interview and Life Chart Interview. Results: At baseline, 18. 4 % reported at least one childhood life event and 57. 8 % any childhood trauma. Childhood life events were not predictive of any measures of course trajectory. Emotional neglect, psychological and physical abuse, but not sexual abuse, were associated with persistence of both depressive and comorbid anxiety and depressive disorder at follow-up. Emotional neglect and psychological abuse were associated with a higher occurrence of a chronic course. Poor course outcomes were mediated mainly through a higher baseline severity of depressive symptoms. Conclusion: Childhood trauma, but not childhood life events, was associated with an increased persistence of comorbidity and chronicity in adults with anxiety and/or depressive disorders. More unfavourable clinical characteristics at baseline mediate the relationship between childhood trauma and a poorer course of depressive and anxiety disorders...|$|R
40|$|OBJECTIVE: Studying {{the rates}} of {{posttraumatic}} stress disorder (PTSD) in people who experienced World War II, but who have subsequently lived in different environments {{is a way of}} looking at the impact of recovery environment on PTSD. Immigrants had less support in terms of the social cohesion in their home country, but were not subjected to the same triggers of war-related intrusions. METHOD: Posttraumatic stress disorder was investigated in citizens from the Netherlands who emigrated to Australia in the post-World War II years (n = 251). Immigrants born between 1920 and 1930 (n = 171) were compared with a same-aged group living in Holland (n = 1461) for stressful war experiences and the extent of PTSD. RESULTS: Those who had been exposed to the most severe war stress were over-represented in the immigrant group. Immigrants with current PTSD more often stated that motives for migration were threat of a third world war, disappointment with Dutch society and personal problems. We were unable to demonstrate specific effects of emigration on the prevalence of current PTSD. CONCLUSIONS: This study suggests that exposure to severe war stress promoted the need to emigrate. The comparable PTSD scores of the groups of war victims living in Australia and the Netherlands support the notion that extreme war stress may be considered the primary determining factor in the development of PTSD, and that actual post-war living circumstances are, in the long term, of subordinate importance.

Her Daughter Luise hastened at once to Stuttgart, where she then chanced to be, and carried her home to Clever-Sulzbach, to be under her own nursing. So soon as Schiller heard of this, he wrote, in well-meant consideration of his Sister's frugal economies, to Dr. <b>Hoven,</b> a friend of his youth at Ludwigsburg; and empowered him to take his Mother over thither, under his own medical care: he, Schiller, would with pleasure pay all that was necessary for lodging and attendance. But the Mother stayed with her Daughter; wrote, however, in her last Letter to Schiller: [...] "Thy unwearied love and care for me God reward with thousandfold love and blessings! Ah me! another such Son there is not in the world!" [...] Schiller, in his continual anxiety about the dear Patient, had his chief solace in knowing her to be in such tender hands; and he wrote at once, withal, to his Sister: [...] "Thou wilt permit me also that on my side I try to do something to lighten these burdens for thee. I therefore make this agreement with my Bookseller Cotta that he shall furnish my dear Mother with the necessary money to make good, in a convenient way, the extra outlays which her illness requires." ...|$|E

50|$|Viervant was the {{architect}} of several buildings throughout the Netherlands. He was taught by his uncle Husly, and had a for that period typical neoclassical style. Short after his entry in the stonemason guild of Amsterdam in 1768, he got an assignment by the churchmasters of the Oude Kerk (Old Church) for a Bardiglio Marmere schoosteenmantel met holle stijlen en ornament in het midden voor f 180 (a Bardiglio marmer chimney mantel with hollow styles and an ornament in the middle for 180 guilders). From 1772 to 1776 {{he worked on the}} town hall of Weesp. In 1779 he is asked by the Teylers Stichting to design the Oval Room, the Teylers astronomical observatory and {{a significant part of the}} interior of the Teylers Museum (works began in 1784). Here he could also use his family background of cabinet makers, designing amongst others the cabinets in the Oval Room and the lower part of the Big Electrostatic generator. In his works on the Teylers Museum, he based himself amongst others on work of {{the architect}}s François de Neufforge, Michelangelo and Artus Quellinus. Viervant received some 9500 guilders, and was with that amount probably one of the best paid architects in the Netherlands at the time. His uncle Husly designed several of the ceiling decorations in the Oval Room. He also works on other projects for this foundation, including the Teylers Hofje, all in Haarlem. In the Regents Room of Teylers Hofje, there is a large group portrait by Wybrand Hendriks, showing the first five Directors of Teylers Stichting sitting around a table, together with their accountant Koenraad <b>Hovens</b> and their architect: Leendert Viervant.|$|R
30|$|Stressful {{life events}} in {{combination}} with genetic factors are {{a risk factor for}} the onset of psychiatric disorders (Afifi et al. 2009; Bebbington et al. 1984; Costello 1982; Kendler et al. 1999; Paykel 1978; Schmitt et al. 2014; Surtees et al. 1986). Environmental risk factors, causing these stressful experiences, are for example neglect during childhood, maternal loss, economic problems, family violence, abuse, sexual maltreatment, and many more (Bernstein et al. 2003; Brown et al. 2009; Kaufman and Charney 2001; Marangoni et al. 2016; Mullen et al. 1996). In fact almost two-third of BD patients sustained at least one negative or goal-attainment life event 6  months prior to the index or first occurred episode (Simhandl et al. 2015). Especially the first period of life {{plays an important role in}} the development of children (Vetulani 2013). Different types of maltreatment including physical, sexual, and emotional abuse or neglect in the early period of life (i.e., early live stress, ELS) are associated with mood disorders (Afifi et al. 2009; Green et al. 2010; <b>Hovens</b> et al. 2010; Leverich et al. 2002; McLaughlin et al. 2010). ELS in humans can lead to impaired cognitive functioning, exemplified in worse academic performance, impaired intellectual ability, language difficulties, and lower IQ (Cohen et al. 2008; De Bellis et al. 2009; van den Dries et al. 2010; Loman et al. 2009; Nelson et al. 2007). The risk to develop anxiety, depression, and psychoses in adulthood is particularly increased through ELS (Bebbington et al. 2004; Gilbert et al. 2009; Kaufman and Charney 2001; Mullen et al. 1996) and it is more likely that these illnesses are treatment resistant (Bryer et al. 1987; Nemeroff et al. 2003; Vetulani 2013). These long-lasting effects can occur through high or chronic levels of stress, because they might affect brain development and thereby mental health (Anda et al. 2006; De Bellis et al. 1999 a; De Bellis et al. 1999 b; Lupien et al. 2009; Maniglio 2009; McLaughlin et al. 2010; Pechtel and Pizzagalli 2011; Pirkola et al. 2005; Spataro et al. 2004; Teicher 2002). 32 percent of psychiatric disorders can be explained by childhood adverse experiences (Green et al. 2010; Pechtel and Pizzagalli 2011). These experiences influence also the overall lifespan, because humans, who experienced more than six traumatic events in their childhood, have an increased risk of dying approximately 20  years earlier (Anda et al. 2009; Brown et al. 2009).|$|R
40|$|There {{are many}} reasons why a {{religious}} building loses its sacred character. New political and social developments, abandonment of previous religious practices in favour of others, economic necessity, {{a reduction in the}} number of people in the local communities: these are just some of the possible reasons why it is decided to deconsecrate a church and turn it into a secular building. The means by which new life can be injected into buildings conceived and built to be sacred places is simple. In the case of Catholic churches, there are several reasons why a church may be deconsecrated, such as changes in parish structures or the population in the area, damage to the structure rendering impossible to use or simply that it is no longer practical to use it (Montini 2000) and they are ruled by Canon law, in particular Can 1211, Can 1212, Can 1222 (§ 1 e § 2). The key question is whether this gesture is enough to efface the complexity of the meanings embodied in a church at different scales and levels, transforming it into a simple container in which a new use can be installed. Very often the way these places are in fact reused does not have a close relationship with the ‘container’ – that is, with the material nature of the building – but is the result of other kinds of logic (commercial, economic, occasional, spatial and architectural) which partially interpret the tangible and intangible components of the built heritage. The cases are many and varied. The solutions that can be observed range from unplanned interventions to highly sophisticated operations. One of many possible examples of this process is the Dominican church in Maastricht in the Netherlands (<b>Hovens</b> et al. 2006) which since 1796, the year when it was reassigned to military use, has served widely varied functions, alternating with periods of abandonment: storage room for Maastricht town council, headquarters of the Municipal Orchestra, art gallery, flower display (Fig. 1), parties (Fig. 2), boxing arena, car shows, storage facility for bicycles and finally a bookstore 1 (Figs. 3 - 4). The current solution is the result of a complex design process whose outcome focuses on a specific item – a multi-level, steel, black, walk-in bookcase situated asymmetrically in the church – to which is entrusted the value of the solution found (Weelen 2014 : 25 – 27). The basic idea is that the customers of the bookshop, while browsing the books on sale, can ‘experience the colossal dimensions of the church and view the historical murals from close-by’ 2. The question that underlies the operation, which needs to be argued in depth, is whether the refined design of the furnishings and the use of the space, avowedly designed to be reversible, are sufficient to preserve the spirit of the place and safeguard the tangible and intangible heritag...|$|R
