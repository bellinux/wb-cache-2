We point to the need for organization level commitment to a consistent agreed vision specifically accounting for place, as a cornerstone of intersectoral health promotion partnership resilience.

40|$|In an era {{of growing}} {{interest}} in transdisciplinary collaboration, evidence-based decision-making, open government, and social impact strategies responding to political and economic challenges, Health Impact Assessment (HIA) is increasingly relevant. HIA sits at the juncture {{of a number of}} paradigms for democratic processes for dealing with uncertainty and adding value in decision-making. It draws from a rich history of impact assessment that has accounted for multiple bottom lines. While HIA has gained attention as a specific tool, it is also recognized as part of a suite of more ecological and equitable approaches to health. HIA developers are asking both how to make it work better, so that ultimately government will work better. This research examines the state of HIA in the United States. It examines the earliest efforts to train a variety practitioners across the country, acknowledging multiple opportunities for capacity-building and many influences on effective HIA practice. More importantly, it identifies a broad definition of effectiveness. Research on HIA practice builds on this, finding that practice is not fully aligned with standards but not necessarily deficient. While objectives should guide HIA processes, the research on training and practice highlights resources as a key driver. The third component of this research considers the resource constraints of public <b>health</b> <b>in</b> general and the opportunities to leverage outside resources using the paradigm of HIA. In moving the field forward, frameworks for community-based prevention and transdisciplinary education can inform HIA capacity-building. Evaluation of both processes and outcomes will be useful. While methodological challenges remain, the institutionalization of partnerships, processes, and indicators will support public health goals. The definition and standardization of HIA practice must be balanced with efforts to expand its utility in new areas such as community development. In such cases the HIA process and paradigm can leverage investments by estimating returns <b>in</b> <b>health</b> and social denominations. HIA also helps solve the "wrong pocket" problem by accounting for outcomes across sectors and institutions. If used wisely, HIA will be a critical component of <b>health</b> <b>in</b> <b>all</b> <b>policy,</b> sustainability agendas, and social impact strategies...|$|R

40|$|Purpose. The {{concept of}} risk {{governance}} is successfully put upon {{the scientific and}} political agenda. However, this debate remains on a rather conceptual level, while empirical studies on ‘how to actually do it’ are still rare. Therefore, this paper aims {{to contribute to a}} further elaboration of the concept, taking the newly emerging discourses on complexity and their impact on the institutional dynamics of the Flemish environmental health risk governance arrangement as a starting point. Methodology. A thorough discourse analysis is undertaken using document analysis and in-depth interviews. In order to evaluate the performance of the risk governance arrangement, an evaluation framework is developed based on literature review. Findings. The Flemish environmental health risk governance arrangement succeeds in increasing the exchange information: 1) between the local, Flemish, federal and European governmental level; 2) between scientists and policymakers; 3) between environmental and public health civil servants; 4) between the general public and the experts or policymakers. Nevertheless, the analysis also provides insights into some shortcomings and recommendations to ameliorate this arrangement. The contents’ recommendations regard: 1) a formalized procedure for appropriate uncertainty management, 2) the integration of environmental <b>health</b> objectives <b>in</b> <b>all</b> relevant <b>policy</b> domains, and 3) further research and a socio-political debate about environmental health indicators. At the organizational level, a point of interest relates to the strategies facilitating co-production of knowledge and multi-actor governance. Originality/value of paper.

40|$|The Healthy Cities {{programme}} {{was created}} in 1986 by the European Bureau of the World Health Organization, which defines health as “a state of complete physical, mental and social well-being and not merely the absence of disease or infirmity”. This wide defintion of health is {{the base of the}} Ottawa Charter for Health Promotion signed by the members of the World <b>Health</b> Organization <b>in</b> 1986. Being a healthy city is more a process than a result : a healthy city is not a city that reached a particular health status but one that tries to improve its health status. Healthy cities have built networks to exchange their experiences with other Healthy cities. These networks are national networks. The french Healthy cities network {{was created in}} 1990. Seventy-two cities are members of this network. Health Promotion is not a legal competence of the cities : the ministry of Health is the main actor of the health promotion. As a consequence, joining the french healthy cities network is the expression of a political commitment as the cities are not legally obliged to integrate <b>health</b> <b>in</b> their policies. First, the reasons to join the Healthy cities network will be discussed: are the cities sincere or opportunist ? Secondly, {{it will be interesting to}} evaluate the degree of motivation of the healthy cities after they have joined the network. Thirdly, the place of <b>health</b> <b>in</b> the local urban policies of Healthy cities will be analyzed. The main motivation of the joining to the French network is the exchange of information and of experiences. The relations with town councillors or with technicians is another reason which encouraged cities to join the network. These relations can be divided into two parts : on one side, previous relations between two cities, that can encourage a city to join the other city; on the other side, joining the network is an opportunity to meet other town councillors or technicians. The third motivation of the cities is to get a label, although the selection of the cities by the network is based on their commitment on the future and not on their results. A fourth motivation appeared in the deliberations of town councils : the legitimation. Joining the network is an opportnity for the cities to legitimate their role <b>in</b> public <b>health</b> and <b>in</b> <b>health</b> promotion. Healthy cities programme is not the only one that advocates <b>health</b> <b>in</b> every local policy. Many Healthy Cities are involved in other networks or labels linked to health or sustainable developement. Two approaches, which are supported by the same methods may fit with their goals: local Agenda 21 and the “health city workshops”, or ASV (policy for deprived neighbourhoods). The main objective of the Healthy cities programme is the integration of <b>health</b> <b>in</b> <b>all</b> local urban <b>policies.</b> Threeurban policies seem to take health into account : social policy, childhood policy and sport policy.

40|$|The {{nature and}} {{resource}} constraints of modern {{health care has}} led to increased reliance on rigorous treatment targets and detailed policy guidelines. Whilst well intentioned, this can shift the focus away from patients themselves and places emphasis on arbitrary measures of output or performance that can relate poorly to how people experience and benefit from health care. Considerable effort and resources are spent on health care interventions, but policy makers and clinicians may be left without {{a clear understanding of}} how these treatments actually affect people in the experience of their lives. Subjective wellbeing (SWB) is a broad category of phenomena that includes people’s emotional responses, domain satisfactions (e. g., health or work), and global judgements of life satisfaction. Measures of SWB offer a means to gauge the impact of changes and events in the lives of individuals. In recent years, there has been increasing interest in the use of SWB in shaping public policy (e. g. in relation to environmental and economic policies). In my thesis, I examine {{for the first time the}} ways in which measures of SWB can be used directly within a health care setting and to inform <b>health</b> policy decisions. <b>In</b> doing so, I have drawn on my understanding of clinical environments and health care systems as a practising clinician to bring a new perspective to the way that SWB is considered and used <b>in</b> <b>health</b> care and to how it can be applied <b>in</b> determining <b>health</b> policy. I explore the use of SWB at both the macro and micro levels of policy making and address the challenges faced when using measures of SWB in these ways. At the macro level, I examine the limitations and challenges of existing methods and examine where using SWB would have the most impact. I also focus on the use of SWB measures at a micro level, setting out a new model of patient experience with reference to SWB. My thesis sets out original methods for SWB data collection developed through innovative empirical work. This work into hernia surgery and on the SWB of the staff and inpatients of an acute NHS hospital has generated new data sets in clinical populations. I discuss the implications of this research and explain how, when and where SWB measures, when used <b>in</b> <b>health</b> care, can be used <b>in</b> <b>health</b> <b>policy.</b> <b>All</b> too often we lose sight of what really matters in life, and the world of heath care is no exception. Through the application of measures of SWB <b>in</b> <b>health</b> care, I offer a novel perspective that ensures a greater focus is placed on the way that patients experience health interventions when developing health policy.

50|$|The United States Department of Health and Human Services {{includes}} {{social determinants}} in its model of population health, {{and one of}} its missions is to strengthen policies which are backed by the best available evidence and knowledge in the field Social determinants of health do not exist in a vacuum.

For example, early life is shaped by availability of sufficient material resources that assure adequate educational opportunities, food and housing among others. Much of {{this has to do with}} the employment security and the quality of working conditions and wages. The availability of quality, regulated childcare is an especially important policy option in support of early life.
