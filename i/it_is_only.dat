30|$|This was {{the single}} most {{important}} recommendation of the Middlesborough Consensus Meeting held in 1999, but because <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>only</b> published in a specialist journal, Gynaecological Endoscopy, <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>only</b> read by relatively few surgeons whose main interest was laparoscopic gynaecological surgery.|$|R

5|$|After the Convention of 1901–02, the General Assembly did {{not call}} another general {{convention}} in the twentieth century. Two proposals for constitutional amendment since the 1960s {{that might have been}} passed by the General Assembly and sent to the voters for ratification referendum have failed to be enacted, but both remain current topics of periodic political discussion. Virginia remains the only state to ban governors serving consecutive terms, and <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>only</b> one of two states still selecting both trial and appellate judges by the state legislature.|$|E
5|$|Although {{the size}} of the Queen Elizabeth class would enable it to {{accommodate}} most current and projected carrier-based fixed-wing aircraft, the lack of arresting gear means that, as initially completed, <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>only</b> capable of operating either STOVL aircraft, such as the AV-8B Harrier or F-35B Lightning, tiltrotor aircraft such as the V-22 Osprey, or aircraft that do not require either catapult-assisted take-off or arrested recovery.|$|E
5|$|An inland route {{across the}} Nullarbor was {{established}} with the 1912 to 1917 {{construction of the}} Trans-Australian Railway, from Port Augusta via Tarcoola to Kalgoorlie. With few roads or tracks encountering the line, most of <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>only</b> accessible by rail.|$|E

60|$|Between these main groups {{there were}} waverers and compromisers.

5|$|C. diaphanus is {{the only}} species of fairy shrimp to occur {{naturally}} in Great Britain; Tanymastix stagnalis is found in western Ireland, and Artemia salina formerly occurred in England. Within Great Britain, C. diaphanus is restricted to areas with a deficit of precipitation against evapotranspiration between April and September. This means that <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>only</b> found frequently in southern England, with scattered records {{as far north as}} Yorkshire.|$|E

5|$|Elias Magnus Fries and Christopher Theodor Hök first {{described}} this species as Boletus torosus in 1835, a name {{by which it}} was known for many years. Modern molecular phylogenetics shows that <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>only</b> distantly related to Boletus edulis—the type species of Boletus—and it was duly placed in the new genus Imperator in 2015. Eating raw mushrooms of this species leads to vomiting and diarrhea. Gastrointestinal symptoms have also occurred after eating cooked specimens, though some people have eaten it without ill-effects.|$|E

5|$|Federation of Australia 1901 {{alternative}} date, 19 January - {{proposed as}} an alternative to traditional Australia Day because <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>only</b> one week earlier and can represent Federation 1901 with 19.01.

5|$|Hemilepistus reaumuri is {{the only}} species of Hemilepistus to have {{developed}} parental care of its offspring, and <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>only</b> because of this development that the species can survive in the desert. It is monogamous, and, unusually, both parents tend the young.|$|E
5|$|However, {{in order}} to {{accomplish}} its aims, morality must be legitimate in the eyes of those to whom it speaks. As Durkheim argues, this moral authority is primarily to be located in religion, which is why in any religion one finds a code of morality. For Durkheim, <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>only</b> society that has the resources, the respect, and the power to cultivate within an individual both the obligatory and the desirous aspects of morality.|$|E

Sélestat has 35 listed buildings and 119 additional sites that are indexed in the French list of cultural heritage monuments.|$|E
5|$|<b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>only</b> as {{a result}} of {{accurately}} maintaining the composition of the 3 litres alveolar air that, with each breath, some carbon dioxide is discharged into the atmosphere and some oxygen is taken up from the outside air. If more carbon dioxide than usual has been lost by a short period of hyperventilation, breathing will be slowed down or halted until the alveolar partial pressure of carbon dioxide has returned to 5.3kPa (40mmHg). The opposite occurs after breath-holding.|$|E
5|$|P. l. sinhaleyus, {{known as}} the Sri Lanka lion, appears to have become extinct around 39,000 years ago. <b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>only</b> known from two teeth found in {{deposits}} at Kuruwita. Based on these teeth, P. Deraniyagala erected this subspecies in 1939.|$|E
