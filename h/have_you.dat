You should go downstairs when you leave here... and buy some rock-and-roll records.|$|E

There's plenty of stuff going on that kills you and you don't get warned at all. So sticking your head in a crocodile you were told about is not calculated to get my sympathy.|$|E

This is not victory, which is gained over ourselves. In killing these, you drive the sword into your own entrails. How many men <b>have</b> <b>you</b> slaughtered? How many more <b>have</b> <b>you</b> to kill? We have become a proverb, even among the Pagans and Moors, for carrying on this war, and apostatizing, as they say, from the faith of our ancestors.|$|E
