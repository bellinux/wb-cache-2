5|$|While the Enterprise is {{en route}} to Pacifica on a {{scientific}} mission, Captain Picard (Patrick Stewart) receives a highly confidential message from an old friend, Captain Walker Keel (Jonathan Farwell) of the USS Horatio. Keel refuses to discuss his concerns, even though the frequency he is using {{is supposed to be}} a secure channel, and insists on a face-to-face meeting. Once they arrive at Dytallix B for this secret meeting, the crew discover the Horatio and two other Federation ships already present. Picard beams alone to the surface and is met by Captain Keel and the other captains. Keel reports strange orders from Starfleet headquarters and what he implies are suspicious deaths of Starfleet officers, and expresses concern of a conspiracy. Picard refuses to accept this without proof, but Keel warns him to remain wary. When the captain returns to the Enterprise, he is challenged by Counselor Troi (Marina Sirtis) about keeping his contact with Keel secret. Picard is skeptical about the conspiracy, but says that he trusts his old friend completely. The Enterprise resumes its previous journey. Picard has Commander Data (Brent Spiner) review all orders issued by Starfleet Command <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>past</b> <b>six</b> months. While the ship is still on its way to Pacifica, a disturbance is detected in nearby space. Upon investigating this, the Enterprise discovers a mass of debris that surely must be the shattered remains of the Horatio. Data completes his study and finds several strange orders from the senior levels of Starfleet. Picard informs his senior staff of the conspiracy theory, and orders the Enterprise to Earth.|$|E

25|$|His loan {{contract}} expired on 1 July 2007, but also featured a buy option for Villarreal.

In the first match of the 2007–08 La Liga season, Tomasson scored in Villareal's 3–0 victory against Valencia. However Tomasson mostly played the club's UEFA cup games in 2007–08, where he managed to prove his value as an efficient striker, by scoring a total of five goals in eight games. The season ended as the best ever for Villarreal, as the club managed to achieve a runner up position in La Liga.

25|$|In {{a nationally}} representative, online sample of 3145 men and 3283 women, 3.6% {{of the men}} and 1.4% of the women {{identified}} as gay. A further 5.5% {{of the men and}} 7.4% of the women identified as bisexual. Self-identification was assessed on a 5-point scale and all three non-exclusive options were combined for bisexual self-identification. Same-sex attraction is more prevalent than homo- or bisexual orientation. Of the men, 9.9% reported at least some same-sex attraction (4.2% exclusively). Among women, this was 10.9% (1.5% exclusively), of which a large group reported mainly heterosexual attraction. Of the men, 3.6% had had sex with men <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>past</b> <b>six</b> months and a further 2.0% with both men and women. For women, these percentages were 1.6% and 0.8% respectively. Gay or bisexual self-identification without same-sex attraction was almost non-existent. However, not all men and women who felt attracted to their own gender identified as gay or bisexual. Same-sex sexual behavior did occur among men and women who neither reported any same-sex attraction or a gay or bisexual identification, especially when lifelong sexual behavior was considered.|$|E

25|$|Saturday afternoon's {{qualifying}} {{session was}} divided into three parts. The first part ran for 18 minutes, eliminating cars that finished the session 17th or below. The 107% rule was in effect, requiring drivers to reach a time within 107% of the quickest lap to qualify. The {{second part of the}} qualifying session lasted 15 minutes, eliminating cars that finished 11th to 16th. The final part of the qualifying session determined the positions from first to tenth, deciding the pole position. Cars in the final qualifying session were not allowed to change tyres, using the tyres with which they set their quickest lap times. Qualifying took place in warm weather conditions. Hamilton set the fastest laps in all three sessions to clinch his fifth pole position of the season, the 36th of his career, and his first since the Spanish Grand Prix with a time of one minute and 24.109 seconds. He was joined on the grid's front row by Rosberg (running with a repaired gearbox) who recorded a lap 0.274 seconds slower than his teammate having improved on his first timed lap, but oversteered through the Ascari chicane, preventing him from achieving the pole position. The two Williams cars lined up in third and fourth (with Bottas ahead of Massa) and both drivers were unable to improve their fastest times on their second attempts. They were ahead of both McLaren drivers on the grid's third row with Magnussen faster than teammate Button; the latter lost time through the Lesmo corners on his final timed lap. Alonso was slightly slower than Vettel after his first run on the circuit, but improved slightly to secure seventh. He attributed his starting position to recording similar lap times on four sets of tyres used during qualifying. Vettel out-qualified teammate Ricciardo for the fourth time <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>past</b> <b>six</b> races to secure eighth with Ricicardo starting ninth. Pérez rounded out the top-ten qualifiers.|$|E
