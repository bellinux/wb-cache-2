500|$|Funding for the UK's {{first wave}} farm was {{announced}} by the then Scottish Executive on 22 February 2007. It will be the world's largest, with a capacity of 3 MW generated by four Pelamis machines {{at a cost of}} over £4 million. The funding is part of a new £13 million funding package for marine power projects in Scotland that will also support developments to Aquamarine's Oyster and Ocean Power Technologies' PowerBuoy wave systems, AWS Ocean Energy's sub-sea wave devices, ScotRenewables' 1.2 MW <b>floating</b> <b>rotor</b> device, Cleantechcom's tidal surge plans for the Churchill barriers between various Orkney islands, the Open Hydro tidal ring turbines, and further developments to the Wavegen system proposed for Lewis as well as a further £2.5 million for the European Marine Energy Centre (EMEC) based in Orkney. This is a Scottish Executive-backed research facility that has installed a wave testing system at Billia Croo on the Orkney mainland and a tidal power testing station on the nearby island of Eday. At the official opening of the Eday project the site was described as [...] "the first {{of its kind in the}} world set up to provide developers of wave and tidal energy devices with a purpose-built performance testing facility." ...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{presents}} an absolute capacitive angular-position sensor with a contactless rotor. The sensor is mainly composed of three parts: the capacitive sensing element, a signal processor, and a microcontroller. The electrically <b>floating</b> <b>rotor</b> {{can be either}} conductive or dielectric. For the dielectric material, we chose plastic, and for the conductive rotor, we chose aluminum. The sensing element has a redundant structure, which reduces mechanical nonidealities. The signal processor has a multicapacitance input and a single output, which is a period-modulated square-wave voltage. The microcontroller acquires output data from the processor and sends them to a PC, which calculates the rotor position. Theoretical analysis, supported by experimental results, show that the sensitivity to mechanical nonidealities of the sensing element is higher {{in the case of}} a conductive rotor. The resolution of the capacitive angular-position sensor over the full range (360 /spl deg/) was better than 1 ". The measured nonlinearity was /spl plusmn/ 100 " and /spl plusmn/ 300 " for the dielectric and the conductive rotor, respectively. Peer Reviewe...|$|E

50|$|Other notable {{differences}} between North American and their European counterparts were as follows: <b>Floating</b> <b>rotors</b> were standard on the Canadian and European cars, but {{absent from the}} American variations. As well, the differential and rear axles on the North American cars were of lighter duty builds than the Euro cars.|$|R

5000|$|Even with a {{base price}} of $59,900 (a {{substantial}} sum {{for the day}} given that the standard equipment list did not include forged lightweight wheels, air conditioning, a sunroof or even metallic paint), all 45 cars were spoken for in 3 days. Unlike the other special versions of the E36 M3, buyers were free to choose any colours and options they wanted on their cars. The cars all came equipped with the [...] 3.0 L inline 6-cylinder engine, vented brakes with <b>floating</b> <b>rotors,</b> glass headlights and other European standard equipment. They were initially delivered to Toronto, then shipped {{all across the country}} to the dealerships where they were ordered.|$|R
5000|$|The FormulaSPEED car {{is built}} on a chassis {{manufactured}} by Fast Forward Racing Components and constructed out of 4130 Chrome Moly Alloy steel tubing. The firewall, undertray, and side panels are bonded and riveted aluminum. Fiberglass {{is used for the}} bodywork, with 4-layer Kevlar for side protection and composite structure for front crash protection. Suspension is double-wishbone with dampers and springs provided by Öhlins and uprights of billet aluminum alloy 7075. Power is produced by a 2 L liter Mazdaspeed MZR with VVT which produces [...] horsepower. Engine mapping is by Hasselgren Engineering, controlled by an SQ6 ECU by Cosworth/Pectel, fueled by an FIA certified fuel cell. Power is transmitted to the wheels through a Hewland FTR six-speed sequential transaxle, and tires are Goodyear Formula Eagle G19 with 13" [...] diameter. The brakes are <b>floating</b> <b>rotors</b> and aluminum calipers provided by Wilwood, with brake bias adjustable from the cockpit.|$|R
50|$|As {{its name}} suggests, an {{emphasis}} {{was put on}} reducing weight. The M3 CSL has a curb weight of 1385 kg, 110 kg lighter than the regular M3. The CSL features many weight saving technologies taken from BMW's Formula One racing applications. A {{large proportion of the}} M3s sound insulation has been removed, along with electric seats and navigation systems. Air conditioning and stereo systems could be retrofitted free of cost, but were not available standard. The CSL's unique body pieces are all crafted from carbon fibre reinforced polymer. Glass-reinforced plastics are used throughout structural points in the car. The standard rear window was replaced with one made from thinner glass. Although the CSL loses a considerable amount of curb weight from its original version, the focus was put on strategically reducing or moving the weight in the car rather than the raw amount of weight that could be lost. This is to retain the ideal 50:50 weight distribution characteristics the E46 has. For example, the roof is constructed from carbon fibre reinforced plastic. While this only reduces the curb weight of the car by 7 kg, it lowers the centre of gravity of the car and decreases body flex.In order to improve the handling ability of the car, the entire suspension system was further refined. Specially developed racing springs and dampers were given to the CSL, and a tightened steering ratio (14.5:1 vs 15.4:1 on the regular M3) improved responsiveness. The braking system was also improved with larger front <b>floating</b> <b>rotors</b> and larger pistons in the rear calipers; front calipers were the same as the standard M3 but with a larger calliper carrier to allow for the larger rotor. Rear discs are M3 standard.|$|R
5000|$|The BMW M Roadster {{has been}} the BMW Z4 M Roadster {{launched}} in late 2006. Called the M Roadster, it's powered by the same 3.2L, 8,000rpm, S54 inline-6 engine as the E46 series M3, delivering 338hp (slightly less than the E46 M3s 343hp due to the shorter exhaust system), through a new 6-speed [...] "Type H" [...] manual transmission. Engine management however is specific to the Z4M: the Siemens MSS70 with higher processing power (64 million calculations per second) than the MSS54 (25 million CPS) in the M3. Other performance parts borrowed from the M3 include the CSL's compound (aluminum hubs, stainless steel pins, cross drilled iron <b>floating</b> <b>rotors)</b> brakes {{and most of the}} M3's suspension components. Other changes include a hydraulic steering setup which provides better feel than the electric system in standard Z4 models. Weighing 3197 lb (1450 kg), the M Roadster has been tested by major U.S. car magazines to accelerate from Zero-60 mph in 4.7 seconds, which is slightly quicker than the Porsche Boxster S and Porsche Cayman S. Top speed is electronically limited to 155 mi/h km/h. A new six-speed manual transmission is used since the M3's original six-speed doesn't fit the Z4's chassis. The six speed is the only transmission available in the M Coupe/Roadster; its final gear ratios are virtually the same as those of the M3. It is reported on owner forums that the 6-speed gearbox in the 2006-2008 M roadsters and coupes is prone to grinding when shifting from 1st to 2nd gear at high rpm. According to reports, there has been mixed response by BMW dealerships to this issue, some owners claiming to have received entirely new gearboxes and others claiming their dealer calls the grinding [...] "normal". Varying shift technique, changing the gearbox fluid, and removal of the CDV (Clutch Delay Valve) are also reported to aid smooth shifting.|$|R
40|$|Two scaling methodologies are {{presented}} {{to address the}} dissimilitude normally experienced when attempting to measure global aerodynamic loads {{on a small scale}} wind turbine rotor from a full scale reference. The first, termed direct aerofoil replacement (DAR), redesigns the profile of the blade using a multipoint aerofoil optimisation algorithm, which couples a genetic algorithm (GA) and XFOIL, such that the local non-dimensional lift force is similar to the full scale. Correcting for the reduced Reynolds number in this manner allows for the non-dimensional chord and twist distributions to be maintained at small scale increasing the similitude of the unsteady aerodynamic response; an inherent consideration {{in the study of the}} aerodynamic response of <b>floating</b> wind turbine <b>rotors.</b> The second, the geometrically free rotor design (GFRD) methodology, which utilises the Python based multi-objective GA DEAP and blade-element momentum (BEM) code CCBlade, results in a more simplistic but less accurate design. Numerical simulations of two rotors, produced using the defined scaling methodologies, show an excellent level of similarity of the thrust and reasonably good torque matching for the DAR rotor to the full scale reference. The GFRD rotor design is more simplistic, and hence more readily manufacturable, than the DAR, however the aerodynamic performance match to the full scale turbine is relatively poor...|$|R
40|$|International audienceThis {{paper is}} an {{extension}} of the previous review Nonlinear Normal Modes for Vibrating Mechanical Systems. Review of Theoretical Developments done by the authors, and it is devoted to applications of nonlinear normal modes (NNMs) theory. NNMs are typical regimes of motions in wide classes of nonlinear mechanical systems. The significance of NNMs for mechanical engineering is determined by several important properties of these motions. Forced resonances motions of nonlinear systems occur close to NNMs. Nonlinear phenomena, such as nonlinear localization and transfer of energy, can be analyzed using NNMs. The NNMs analysis is an important step to study more complicated behavior of nonlinear mechanical systems. This review focuses on applications of Kauderer–Rosenberg and Shaw–Pierre concepts of nonlinear normal modes. The Kauderer–Rosenberg NNMs are applied for analysis of large amplitude dynamics of finite-degree-of-freedom nonlinear mechanical systems. Systems with cyclic symmetry, impact systems, mechanical systems with essentially nonlinear absorbers, and systems with nonlinear vibration isolation are studied using this concept. Applications of the Kauderer–Rosenberg NNMs for discretized structures are also discussed. The Shaw–Pierre NNMs are applied to analyze dynamics of finite-degree-of-freedom mechanical systems, such as <b>floating</b> offshore platforms, <b>rotors,</b> piece-wise linear systems. Studies of the Shaw–Pierre NNMs of beams, plates, and shallow shells are reviewed, too. Applications of Shaw–Pierre and King–Vakakis continuous nonlinear modes for beam structures are considered. Target energy transfer and localization of structures motions in light of NNMs theory are treated. Application of different asymptotic methods for NNMs analysis and NNMs based model reduction are reviewed...|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{presents}} coupled {{model for}} the floating off-shore wind turbines, using a 10 -MW machine as an example. The idea put forward is to employ high fidelity Navier-Stokes solvers for air and water. For this reason, the Helicopter Multi-Block solver was used for air, and the Smoothed Particles Hydrodynamic method was used for water. A multi-body solver was implemented to solve for the wind turbine dynamics. All solvers were validated before coupling, and results are presented in this thesis. The employed, loosely coupled, algorithm is described in detail, {{and the importance of}} coupling is assessed. Additional aerodynamic cases were studied to form the foundation for further model development. The study started from the aerodynamic analysis of a 10 -MW wind turbine. Straight and pre-bent configurations of the blade were investigated under the assumption of uniform inflow. Next, the effects of the atmospheric boundary inflow and atmospheric turbulence were studied. For this, the power law wind speed profile was employed, and atmospheric turbulence was introduced using Mann’s model. The aero-elasticity of the 10 -MW rotor was studied next. The structural model was constructed using NASTRAN, and the natural frequencies and modes were compared to published results, showing good agreement. This model was then used for steady and unsteady aero-elastic computations. The effects of employing deformable trailing and leading edge flaps on a 10 -MW wind turbine were also investigated. The results showed that the trailing edge flap can be used to control flap-wise bending of the blade, whilst the leading edge flap can be used to counter additional pitching moment created by the trailing edge flap. A <b>floating</b> 10 -MW <b>rotor</b> was considered next, as well as forced yaw and pitch oscillations of the machine. The results showed large variations in thrust and power as the wind turbine pitched about a point located 119 m below the rotor. The vortex ring state was also encountered when the wind turbine was forced to a pitching motion with amplitude of 5 ° and period of 8. 8 s. A coupled method for the analysis of the dynamics of floating off-shore wind turbines was finally described, along with the test cases and numerical parameters. The results of decoupled and coupled computations are presented and analysed. The results showed that the employed floating turbine under studied conditions did not enter a vortex ring state. A turbulent wake state was encountered, but only at the initial pitching phase. The gyroscopic effects were also small for studied system, and did not cause significant rotations due to large inertia of the employed floater...|$|R
40|$|In the {{development}} of offshore wind turbine industry, the shift {{from the use of}} fixed-substructure wind turbines to the floating wind turbines is expected to maximise the offshore wind power extraction while reducing construction cost and enhancing the structural reliability, particularly in deep waters. Up to the present time, the available floating wind turbine concepts are adopted from the offshore oil and gas industry experiences, namely semi-submersible, tensioned-leg platform (TLP), and deep draft floater (spar). Especially for the latter type (spar), by combining this platform with large turbine rotors, studies had shown that they are susceptible in terms of platform motions when exposed to a turbulent wind. It was hypothesised that the spatial correlation of the occurring turbulence (lateral and vertical coherences) at different points on the <b>floating</b> wind turbine <b>rotor</b> influences the floater motions. The unstable atmospheric stability conditions which occur more frequently offshore, has been hypothesised to cause severe fatigue damages on the wind turbine components. The two recommended models given in the IEC standards to estimate the spatial correlation of the turbulent wind: the Mann Spectral Tensor Model and the Kaimal Spectra & Exponential Coherence Model predict very different coherences, in particular for larger separations. Moreover, the fact that one of the models is unable to capture the effects of varying atmospheric stability, results in the need to select the suitable model for wind turbine design. This master thesis will investigate the comparison of the influences between the two turbulence models outlined in the IEC standards on a spar-buoy floating wind turbine—the OC 3 -Hywind—motions and fatigue loadings. The effects of the lateral and the vertical coherences from the synthetic (generated) wind fields from the two turbulence models and fitted-measurements parameter inputs on the OC 3 -Hywind turbine loadings and motion responses will be studied using HAWC 2 aero-hydro-servo-elastic code. In addition, the influences of combined turbulence variation and mean wind profile under different atmospheric stability conditions on a spar-buoy floating wind turbine will also be studied. In general, it was noted that the OC 3 -Hywind turbine was rather stiff in terms of yaw motion, but not for the pitch motion. It was found that the IEC Mann Spectral Tensor Model was more conservative when use to quantify damage equivalent loads and platform motions (pitch and yaw) on the OC 3 -Hywind turbine compared to the IEC Kaimal Spectra & Coherence Model. The given parameters from the IEC standards was found to be more conservative than the fitted-measurements parameters in predicting motions and damage equivalent loads of the OC 3 -Hywind. The mean wind profile under stable conditions was observed to affect the blade root fatigue damage by up to 5 % only. It was also observed that a higher vertical coherence resulted in higher pitch motion of the OC 3 -Hywind. The influence of the lateral coherence on the OC 3 -Hywind turbine yaw motion was observed when comparing the coherences from the two IEC turbulent wind models, where lower lateral coherence resulted in higher platform yaw motion. When comparing the coherences from the fitted-measurements parameters, the influence of the lateral coherence on the OC 3 -Hywind yaw motion was less obvious, but the yaw motion was shown to be influenced by the turbulence levels which was correlated with the parameter αϵ^(2 / 3). Nonetheless, the results obtained were based on limited number of simulations, which should ideally be expanded in a more extensive parametric study...|$|R
