5|$|The {{pathogenicity}} of prions and proteins with prion-like domains {{arises from}} their self-templating ability {{and the resulting}} exponential growth of amyloid <b>fibrils.</b> The presence of amyloid <b>fibrils</b> in patients with degenerative diseases has been well documented. These amyloid <b>fibrils</b> are seen {{as the result of}} pathogenic proteins that self-propagate and form highly stable, non-functional aggregates. While this does not necessarily imply a causal relationship between amyloid and degenerative diseases, the toxicity of certain amyloid forms and the overproduction of amyloid in familial cases of degenerative disorders supports the idea that amyloid formation is generally toxic.|$|E

Roughening the surface or removing water content by drying causes the structure to collapse, thus, the structural coloration to disappear.|$|E

The rice straw <b>fibril</b> and <b>fibril</b> aggregate material {{was used as}} reinforcement in a rice straw <b>fibril</b> and <b>fibril</b> aggregates/polyvinyl alcohol nanocomposite that was prepared by casting film under air-dry and freezing–thawing conditions, respectively. The material’s tensile strength was increased by adding the rice straw <b>fibril</b> and <b>fibril</b> aggregates material into the polyvinyl alcohol matrix. The mechanical properties were higher in rice straw <b>fibril</b> and <b>fibril</b> aggregates/polyvinyl alcohol nano-composites cast under freezing–thawing conditions than those casting under air-drying conditions. Dynamic thermo-mechanical analysis testing showed that the storage modulus (E 0) of the rice straw <b>fibril</b> and <b>fibril</b> aggregates/polyvinyl alcohol nanocomposites was {{higher than that of}} polyvinyl alcohol alone when 2 % rice straw <b>fibril</b> and <b>fibril</b> aggregates material was added into the polyvinyl alcohol matrix. The glass transition temperature (Tg) rose in neat polyvinyl alcohol and rice straw <b>fibril</b> and <b>fibril</b> aggregates/polyvinyl alcohol nanocomposites cast under freezing–thawing conditions. Differential scanning calorimetry analysis revealed that the melting temperature (Tm), melting enthalpy (HC) and crystallinity (XC) in rice straw <b>fibril</b> and <b>fibril</b> aggregates/polyvinyl alcohol nanocomposites increased to higher values compared to those in neat polyvinyl alcohol when cast under the two conditions. Thermogravimetric analysis showed that the polymer matrixes were stabilized against thermal decomposition by the addition of rice straw <b>fibril</b> and <b>fibril</b> aggregates. The shift of the –OH stretching peak of rice straw <b>fibril</b> and <b>fibril</b> aggregates/polyvinyl alcohol nanocompo-sites in Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy spectra indicated a good compatibility between rice straw <b>fibril</b> and <b>fibril</b> aggregates and the polyvinyl alcohol matrix in nanocomposites...|$|R

Single <b>fibril</b> segments were followed over their entire length in consecutive sections, and their lengths ranged from 7 to 15 microns. Structural differences in {{the ends of the}} <b>fibril</b> segments were identified, suggesting that the amino/carboxyl polarity of the <b>fibril</b> segment is reflected in its architecture. Our data indicate that <b>fibril</b> segments are precursors in collagen <b>fibril</b> formation, and we suggest that postdepositional fusion of <b>fibril</b> segments may be an important process in tendon development and growth...|$|R
30|$|To {{pull the}} amyloid <b>fibril</b> along the <b>fibril</b> axis, we {{considered}} SMD simulations that {{give rise to}} the mechanical deformation of protein materials in silico. In order to extend the amyloid <b>fibril</b> along the <b>fibril</b> axis, we fix the bottom three layers of the <b>fibril,</b> while a spring mimicking a force probe is attached to the center of mass for top three layers of the <b>fibril.</b> Then, the <b>fibril</b> is pulled along the <b>fibril</b> axis by moving a spring (whose force constant is given by 12 kcal mol- 1 Å- 1) with a constant velocity in a range of 0.001 to 0.05 Å/ps. Here, SMD simulations were performed based on NVT ensemble, and these simulations was conducted until the <b>fibril</b> structure is entirely fractured. The SMD trajectories are recorded for every 1 ps.|$|R
5|$|An {{alternative}} model {{assumes that}} PrPSc exists only as <b>fibrils,</b> and that fibril ends bind PrPC and convert it into PrPSc. If this were all, then {{the quantity of}} prions would increase linearly, forming ever longer <b>fibrils.</b> But exponential growth of both PrPSc and of the quantity of infectious particles is observed during prion disease. This {{can be explained by}} taking into account fibril breakage. A mathematical solution for the exponential growth rate resulting from the combination of fibril growth and fibril breakage has been found. The exponential growth rate depends largely on the square root of the PrPC concentration. The incubation period is determined by the exponential growth rate, and in vivo data on prion diseases in transgenic mice match this prediction. The same square root dependence is also seen in vitro in experiments with a variety of different amyloid proteins.|$|E

5|$|The amyloid {{hypothesis}} traditionally {{points to}} the accumulation of beta-amyloid peptides as the central event triggering neuron degeneration. Accumulation of aggregated amyloid <b>fibrils,</b> which {{are believed to be}} the toxic form of the protein responsible for disrupting the cell's calcium ion homeostasis, induces programmed cell death (apoptosis). It is also known that Aβ selectively builds up in the mitochondria in the cells of Alzheimer's-affected brains, and it also inhibits certain enzyme functions and the utilisation of glucose by neurons.|$|E
40|$|The {{discharge}} {{and charge}} performance of polyaniline {{which has a}} fibrous morphology was investigated from micro-scopic current density and anion diffusion time constant measurements. The microscopic discharge current density is calculated from the radius of the polyaniline <b>fibril,</b> assuming the true electrode surface area corresponds to the surface area of the long polyaniline <b>fibril</b> (2 aL, L:the sum {{of the length of}} the polyaniline <b>fibril).</b> The time constant for the diffusion of anions in the polyaniline <b>fibril</b> was calculated from a' 2 /D, where D is the diffusion coefficient and a is the polyaniline <b>fibril</b> radius. The diffusion coefficient was measured using an impedance method, and the a 2 /D parameter was calculated. Galvanostatic discharge and charge cycle tests were carried out to decide the performance of polyaniline cathodes with different <b>fibril</b> radii. From these experiments, {{it can be seen that}} the dependence of the discharge characteristics on the <b>fibril</b> radius is diminished by the positive dependencies of the diffusion coefficient and roughness of the polyaniline <b>fibril</b> on the <b>fibril</b> radius...|$|R
40|$|The {{mechanism}} of {{addition of a}} soluble unstructured monomer to a preformed ordered amyloid <b>fibril</b> is a complex process. On {{the basis of the}} kinetics of monomer disassociation of A(1 - 40) from the amyloid <b>fibril,</b> {{it has been suggested that}} deposition is a multistep process involving a rapid reversible association of the unstructured monomer to the <b>fibril</b> surface (docking) followed by a slower conformational rearrangement leading to the incorporation onto the underlying <b>fibril</b> lattice (locking). By exploiting the vast time scale separation between the dock and lock processes and using molecular dynamics simulation of deposition of the disordered peptide fragment 35 MVGGVV 40 from the A peptide onto the <b>fibril</b> with known crystal structure, we provide a thermodynamic basis for the dock-lock {{mechanism of}} <b>fibril</b> growth. Free energy profiles, computed using implicit solvent model and enhanced sampling methods with the distance (δC) between the center of mass of the peptide and the <b>fibril</b> surface as the order parameter, show three distinct basins of attraction. When δC is large, the monomer is compact and unstructured and the favorable interactions with the <b>fibril</b> results in stretching of the peptide at δC ≈ 13 Å. As δC is further decreased, the peptide docks onto the <b>fibril</b> surface with a structure that is determined by a balance between intrapeptide and peptide <b>fibril</b> interactions. At δC ≈ 4 Å, a value that is commensurate with the spacing between -strands in the <b>fibril,</b> the monomer expands and locks onto the <b>fibril.</b> Using simulations with implicit solvent model and all ato...|$|R
40|$|It is {{well known}} that peptide and protein {{fibrillation}} is strongly affected by the solution conditions, but a fundamental understanding of how amyloid <b>fibril</b> nucleation depends on solution pH, salt concentration, and solvent is absent. Here, we use expressions from Debye–Hückel theory to describe the interactions between charged amino acids in combination with our recently developed nonstandard nucleation theory to predict the concentration dependence of the <b>fibril</b> nucleation rate under different solvent conditions. The general rule that emerges from these considerations is that changes in solution pH, salt concentration, and solvent that increase the bonding energy between the <b>fibril</b> building blocks decrease the <b>fibril</b> solubility and promote <b>fibril</b> nucleation, in line with experimental observations. The simple analytical relations among the nucleation rate, <b>fibril</b> solubility, and binding energies provide a tool to controlling and understanding amyloid <b>fibril</b> formation by changing the solution conditions...|$|R
5|$|Alzheimer's {{disease has}} been {{identified}} as a protein misfolding disease (proteopathy), caused by plaque accumulation of abnormally folded amyloid beta protein, and tau protein in the brain. Plaques are made up of small peptides, 39–43amino acids in length, called amyloid beta (Aβ). Aβ is a fragment from the larger amyloid precursor protein (APP). APP is a transmembrane protein that penetrates through the neuron's membrane. APP is critical to neuron growth, survival, and post-injury repair. In Alzheimer's disease, gamma secretase and beta secretase act together in a proteolytic process which causes APP to be divided into smaller fragments. One of these fragments gives rise to <b>fibrils</b> of amyloid beta, which then form clumps that deposit outside neurons in dense formations known as senile plaques.|$|E

The {{analysis of the}} interactions between incoming Aβ peptides and the <b>fibril</b> led us to two conclusions. First, considerable variations in <b>fibril</b> binding propensities are observed along the Aβ sequence. The peptides in the <b>fibril</b> and those binding to its edge interact primarily through their N-termini. Therefore, the mutations affecting the Aβ positions 10 – 23 {{are expected to have}} the largest impact on <b>fibril</b> elongation compared with those occurring in the C-terminus and turn. Second, we performed weak perturbations of the binding free energy landscape by scanning partial deletions of side-chain interactions at various Aβ sequence positions. The results imply that strong side-chain interactions—in particular, hydrophobic contacts—impede <b>fibril</b> growth by favoring disordered docking of incoming peptides. Therefore, <b>fibril</b> elongation may be promoted by moderate reduction of Aβ hydrophobicity. The comparison with available experimental data is presented...|$|R
5|$|In {{animals such as}} on the {{feathers}} of birds and the scales of butterflies, interference is created by a range of photonic mechanisms, including diffraction gratings, selective mirrors, photonic crystals, crystal fibres, matrices of nanochannels and proteins that can vary their configuration. Some cuts of meat also show structural coloration due to the exposure of the periodic arrangement of the muscular fibres. Many of these photonic mechanisms correspond to elaborate structures visible by electron microscopy. In the few plants that exploit structural coloration, brilliant colours are produced by structures within cells.

Another similar species, A.magniverrucata, is differentiated from A.abrupta by a number of characteristics: the universal veil is clearly separated from the flesh of the cap; the volval warts disappear more quickly because the surface of the cap cuticle gelatinizes; the partial veil is more persistent; the spores are smaller and roughly spherical; {{on the underside of the}} partial veil, the stem has surface <b>fibrils</b> that are drawn upward so as to somewhat resemble a cortina (a cobweb-like protective covering over the immature spore bearing surfaces); A.magniverrucata has a known distribution limited to the south western coast of North America.|$|E

5|$|Within {{the genus}} Gymnopilus, {{it is located}} in the {{subgenus}} Gymnopilus and section Macrospori. The subgenus Gymnopilus was proposed by Henri Romagnesi as Cortinatae (while the genus was known as Fulvidula) in 1942, though the name Gymnopilus was given later by Rolf Singer. The subgenus is characterised by mushrooms that feature either no veils, or veils that do not form rings. The section Macrospori, proposed by Guzmán-Dávalos in 1995, is made up of large-spored species with ringless mushrooms. Molecular analysis revealed that G.maritimus forms a sister group to (that is, shares an immediate common ancestor with) the spectabilis–imperialis clade, a clade that includes G.imperialis, G.spectabilis, G.junonius (often considered synonymous with G.spectabilis), G.pampeanus, and others. G. maritimus forms a more inclusive clade along with the members of spectabilis–imperialis; while it produces the smallest fruit bodies, it shares with the other members strong, sturdy mushrooms, caps with <b>fibrils</b> (sometimes with scales) and large, warty spores that turn red in Melzer's reagent or Lugol's iodine.|$|E
5|$|There {{are five}} species similar in {{appearance}} to G.maritimus: G.arenophilus, G.decipiens, G.flavus, G.fulgens and G.pseudofulgens. G.arenophilus and particularly G.fulgens {{are the most}} similar. Though G.maritimus and G.arenophilus show similarities in their biogeography and ecology, the typically slightly smaller G.arenophilus differs from G.maritimus morphologically. While G.maritimus has a cap covered in <b>fibrils</b> with small scales, G.arenophilus can sometimes be completely smooth, and spore ornamentation differs, with G.maritimus typically displaying larger warts. Like G.maritimus, G.fulgens has been recorded growing on sand-dune heathland; further, the spores are similar in appearance to those of G.maritimus. However, G.fulgens requires soil rich in peat and must grow among moss. Moreover, {{there are a number}} of morphological differences; G.maritimus mushrooms are larger and thicker, there are never remains of the partial veil on G.fulgens stems, the shape of the top of the spores differs between the two species, and the cheilocystidia and caulocystidia are significantly larger on G.maritimus. G.fulgens var. luteicystis is even more distinct from G.maritimus than the nominate variety. Despite the similarities between the three species, the three have been shown to be in different clades within Gymnopilus, suggesting ecological convergence between G.arenophilus and G.maritimus, and morphological convergence between G.fulgens and G.maritimus.|$|E
