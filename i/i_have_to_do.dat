500|$|... "Paper or Plastic" [...] is a two-minute, fifty-five second pop song, which {{features}} a [...] "mid-tempo groove". Unlike her previous material from her 2014 EP Opulence, Candy does not rap during the song and instead sings the verses. Mike Wass of Idolator felt that Candy was making a conscious move away from [...] "the twisted white-girl rap" [...] present in her past songs [...] "Opulence" [...] and [...] "I Wanna Fuck Right Now". Wass also called the track [...] "unusually restrained" [...] for the artist. According to Nylon's Yasmeen Gharnit, [...] "Paper or Plastic" [...] revolves around issues relating to [...] "commercialism, superficiality, and selling out". A writer from Hungertv.com viewed the song as focusing on [...] "the capitalist agenda and societal exclusion". When responding to criticism regarding her change in musical style, Candy said: [...] "hatever <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> [...] garner a larger, broader audience to spread my message on a larger scale, I stand for women, I stand for freedom.

500|$|In {{addition}} to her work on The Simpsons, Cartwright has voiced many other characters on several animated series, including Chuckie Finster in Rugrats and All Grown Up!, Margo Sherman in The Critic, Mindy in Animaniacs, and Rufus the naked mole-rat in Kim Possible. For the role of Rufus, Cartwright researched mole-rats extensively, and became [...] "a font of useless trivia". She {{was nominated for a}} Daytime Emmy Award for Outstanding Performer in an Animated Program in 2004 for her work on the show. In 2001, Cartwright took over the Rugrats role of Chuckie Finster when Christine Cavanaugh retired. Cartwright describes Rufus and Chuckie as her two most difficult voices: [...] "Rufus because my diaphragm gets a workout while trying to utilize the 18 vocal sounds a mole makes. Chuckie because... he's an asthmatic with five personalities rolled into one—plus <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> the voice the way [...] did it for 10 years." [...] Other television shows that have used her voice work include Galaxy High, God, the Devil and Bob, Goof Troop, Mike, Lu & Og, The Replacements, Pinky and the Brain and Timberwolf. Cartwright has appeared on camera in numerous television shows and films, including Fame, Empty Nest, The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air, Flesh and Blood, Godzilla, and 24.|$|E
500|$|While Leng {{considers}} that, lyrically and musically, [...] "Something" [...] reflects [...] "doubt and {{striving to}} attain an uncertain goal", author Ian Inglis writes of the confident statements that Harrison makes throughout regarding his feelings for Boyd. Referring to {{lines in the}} song's verses, Inglis writes: [...] "there is a clear and mutual confidence in the reciprocal nature of their love; he muses that [...] 'attracts me like no other lover' and 'all <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> is think of her,' but he is equally aware that she feels the same, that 'somewhere in her smile, she knows.'" [...] Similarly, when Harrison sings in the middle eight that [...] "You're asking me will my love grow / I don't know, I don't know", Inglis interprets the words as [...] "not an indication of uncertainty, but a wry reflection that his love is already so complete that it may simply be impossible for it to become any greater". Richie Unterberger of AllMusic describes [...] "Something" [...] as [...] "an unabashedly straightforward and sentimental love song" [...] written at a time [...] "when most of the Beatles' songs were dealing with non-romantic topics or presenting cryptic and allusive lyrics {{even when they were}} writing about love".|$|E

500|$|Angelou was an {{inspiration}} to the modern hip-hop community. [...] Artists such as Danny Brown, Lupe Fiasco, Jean Grae, and The Roots mention her in their songs. [...] Tupac Shakur, who appeared in the film Poetic Justice, which featured Angelou's poetry, named his album Still I Rise, released in 1999 after his death, for Angelou's poem. Nicki Minaj wrote a song also called [...] "Still I Rise", for her 2009 mixtape Beam Me Up Scotty. [...] Although Minaj's song does not mention Angelou explicitly, its themes of overcoming hardship echo the themes in Angelou's poem. [...] Angelou inspired the work of Kanye West, who has referenced Angelou throughout his career, including in a remix of Talib Kweli's [...] "Get By", which West produced in 2002, and in his own song, [...] "Hey Mama" [...] from the album Late Registration, produced in 2005. [...] Common collaborated with Angelou in 2011 in his song, [...] "The Dreamer", which featured her reciting a poem {{at the end of}} the song. [...] Angelou admitted later that his use of profanity in the song [...] "surprised and disappointed" [...] her. [...] According to Time, Angelou believed that rap music was an avenue for young people to discover poetry, and that she was optimistic about the future of poetry, telling one of its reporters, [...] "“All <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> is listen to hip-hop or some of the rappers".|$|E
500|$|The {{importance}} of rehearsal to Monteux was shown when, in 1923, Diaghilev {{asked him to}} conduct Stravinsky's new Les noces with no rehearsal, as the composer would already have conducted the first performance, Monteux following on from there. Monteux told the impresario [...] "Stravinsky, 'e can do what 'e like, but <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> what ze composer 'as written." [...] Monteux's self-effacing approach to scores led to occasional adverse comment; the music critic of The Nation, B. H. Haggin, while admitting that Monteux was generally {{regarded as one of}} the giants of conducting, wrote of his [...] "repeatedly demonstrated musical mediocrity". [...] Other American writers have taken a different view. In 1957 Carleton Smith wrote, [...] "His approach to all music is that of the master-craftsman. ... Seeing him at work, modest and quiet, it is difficult to realize that he is a bigger box office attraction at the Metropolitan Opera House than any prima donna ... that he is the only conductor regularly invited to take charge of America's 'big three'– the Boston, Philadelphia and New York Philharmonic orchestras." [...] In his 1967 book The Great Conductors, Harold C. Schonberg wrote of Monteux, [...] " [...] conductor of international stature, a conductor admired and loved all over the world. The word 'loved' is used advisedly." [...] Elsewhere, Schonberg wrote of Monteux's [...] "passion and charisma". When asked in a radio interview to describe himself (as a conductor) in one word, Monteux replied, [...] "Damned professional".|$|E

This weekend {{we had a}} big party, a big YMCMB party, and Drake was {{performing}} and we were all up on the stage and Wayne got up there and he announced it himself. And so I was kind of surprised and I was like, 'Oh my gosh, this is awesome!'" [...] Milian is currently recording her fourth album. [...] "We're just getting started on it," [...] she said. [...] "I've already halfway gotten there and when my mom and I went to Wayne and we played him some of the music, off the second song, he was like, 'I love it. Let's do this deal.' I have some music that's already going to be on it and the second half I'm working with them now. [...] When they did a little background check, they saw even the songwriting, {{all that kind of stuff}} adds on top of, alright, she's an actress, she's a pretty face, she can actually sing, but not to mention she's a songwriter.

500|$|Dean Martin's song [...] "Naughty Lady of Shady Lane" [...] was {{the first}} to have a number-one in the Record Mirror chart but not to be awarded the top spot in NME 's chart. There are five more songs that, like Martin's, reached number-one on the Record Mirror chart but are not {{classified}} as number-one by the UK Singles Chart. Additionally, the Record Mirror and other charts differed about what they classified as the top song of the year. Record Mirror classified The Everly Brothers' [...] "All <b>I</b> <b>Have</b> <b>to</b> <b>Do</b> Is Dream"/"Claudette" [...] as the top single of 1958 while the UK Singles Chart best-selling single of that year was Elvis Presley's [...] "Jailhouse Rock". Furthermore, despite never reaching number-one, Pat Boone's [...] "Love Letters in the Sand" [...] was classified by Record Mirror as the best-selling song of 1957; the song entered the chart at number eleven on 13 July and, later, charted in the top three positions for 9 consecutive weeks. This is because the top lists for the whole year, were based on a points system. It has to be noted that Tony Jasper's Top 20 book (which takes info from Record Mirror) does actually fall into mistakes between August & December 1958, as Tony says there was no chart for the first week of August, but there was. The charts he prints for 9th Aug onwards are all dated wrongly. The 9th Aug is the 2nd Aug, the 16th is the 9th & so on until 27th Dec 1958, when the dated chart for 27th is actually 20th Dec. He then fails to print the 27th Dec chart. From 1959, he gets it correct again. Though through this mistake, he misses a top 20 entry by Martinas & His Orchestra [...] "Cha Cha Momma Brown", which sneaked into the chart at #18 at the end of December 1958, & then quickly fell out again.|$|E
