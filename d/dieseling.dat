50|$|<b>Dieseling</b> is {{so named}} because it is similar in effect to how diesel engines operate: by firing without a spark. The {{ignition}} source of a diesel engine is the heat generated by the compression of {{the air in the}} cylinder, rather than a spark as in gasoline engines. The <b>dieseling</b> phenomenon occurs not just because the compression ratio is sufficient to cause auto-ignition of the fuel, but also because a hot spot inside the cylinder (spark plug electrode, combustion-chamber/valve edge or even excess carbon) starts combustion. An automobile engine that is <b>dieseling</b> will typically sputter, then gradually stop. This is normally seen in carbureted engines with many miles on them.|$|E

50|$|Until the mass-market {{introduction}} of fuel injection, the industry's remedy for <b>dieseling</b> was to install an electric solenoid into the fuel supply circuit of the carburetor, energized by the ignition coil primary wire: when activated, the solenoid would open and allow fuel to flow normally {{out of the}} float bowl, through the fuel-metering jets and into the engine; when deactivated, the solenoid would close and prevent fuel from being drawn through the jets and into the engine. This provided a simple, adequate solution to the <b>dieseling</b> problem.|$|E

50|$|The {{distinctive}} {{noise of}} a <b>diesel</b> engine is variably called <b>diesel</b> clatter, <b>diesel</b> nailing, or <b>diesel</b> knock. <b>Diesel</b> clatter is caused {{largely by the}} <b>diesel</b> combustion process; the sudden ignition of the <b>diesel</b> fuel when injected into the combustion chamber causes a pressure wave. Engine designers can reduce <b>diesel</b> clatter through: indirect injection; pilot or pre-injection; injection timing; injection rate; compression ratio; turbo boost; and exhaust gas recirculation (EGR). Common rail <b>diesel</b> injection systems permit multiple injection events {{as an aid to}} noise reduction. <b>Diesel</b> fuels with a higher octane rating modify the combustion process and reduce <b>diesel</b> clatter. CN (Cetane number) can be raised by distilling higher quality crude oil, by catalyzing a higher quality product or by using a cetane improving additive.|$|R
30|$|Facing {{increasingly}} strict {{environmental regulations}} on transportation fuels, China National Petroleum Corporation (CNPC), {{the second largest}} supplier of petroleum products in China, needs to upgrade its transportation fuels. Using the scenario-based analysis method, this paper analyzes how the output and emission related properties, including cetane number, and sulfur and aromatics contents of <b>diesel</b> produced by CNPC, will vary with changes in the confi guration of <b>diesel</b> production units in the next 5 – 10 years. The results showed that, to upgrade its <b>diesel,</b> CNPC needs to adjust its <b>diesel</b> pool by decreasing the share of fl uid catalytic cracking (FCC) <b>diesel</b> and increasing the shares of hydrocracking (HDC) and hydrotreating (HDT) <b>diesel.</b> Furthermore, to produce ultra-low-sulfur <b>diesel,</b> straight-run <b>diesel</b> as well as poor <b>diesel</b> blendstocks such as FCC <b>diesel</b> and coker <b>diesel</b> should be hydrotreated before being blended into finished <b>diesel.</b> Developing highly efficient HDC and HDT catalysts and corresponding processes {{is the key to}} CNPC economically producing more and cleaner <b>diesel.</b>|$|R
50|$|Gasoline {{engines that}} are {{much smaller than the}} typical {{automotive}} engine are usually carbureted for economic and engineering reasons. <b>Dieseling</b> can occur in such engines. These engines include those installed in small generators, mopeds, scooters, small motorcycles, all-terrain vehicles, and most lawn and garden power tools.|$|E
5000|$|A {{carburetor}} {{that does}} not completely close can contribute to running once the engine is off, since the extra fuel and oxygen mixture can combust easily in the warm piston chamber. Similarly, hot vaporized oil gases from the engine crankcase can provide ample fuel for <b>dieseling.</b>|$|E
5000|$|The {{engine is}} {{designed}} to run without using spark ignition once it is warmed up. This is known as auto-ignition or <b>dieseling,</b> and the air/fuel mixture starts to burn due to the high temperature of the compressed gas, and/or the presence of hot metal in the combustion chamber.|$|E

50|$|Many {{countries}} in Europe require <b>diesel</b> fuel {{to meet a}} specific class in winter times. In Central and Western Europe the Winter <b>Diesel</b> (Winterdiesel, <b>diesel</b> d'hiver) must meet Class F conditions {{at least from the}} beginning of December to the end of February. During a transitional period (mostly October and April) a lower Class must be met. In the Scandinavian countries the Winter <b>Diesel</b> (Vinterdiesel) must meet Class 2 conditions. Some mineral groups offer both types commonly known as Winter <b>Diesel</b> (Winterdiesel, <b>diesel</b> d'hiver) and Arctic <b>Diesel</b> (Polardiesel, <b>diesel</b> polaires).|$|R
50|$|<b>Dieseling</b> or engine run-on is a {{condition}} that can occur in spark-plug-ignited, gasoline powered internal combustion engines, whereby the engine keeps running {{for a short period}} after being turned off, due to the engine kicking back upon shutdown, drawing fuel through the carburetor, into the engine and igniting it without a spark.|$|E
50|$|<b>Dieseling</b> (in {{the sense}} of engine run-on, and {{disregarding}} combustible gaseous mixtures via the air intake) can also occur in diesel engines, when the piston or seals fail due to overheating, admitting engine oil into the cylinder. A structurally failing diesel engine will often accelerate when the throttle is released, even after fuel injection is switched off.|$|E
50|$|<b>Dieseling</b> is {{not nearly}} as common as it once was, because it most {{commonly}} occurs in engines equipped with carburetors. The vast majority of vehicles manufactured after 1987 are fuel-injected: the injectors and high-pressure fuel pump immediately cease supplying fuel to the cylinders when the ignition is switched off. If the injector is damaged or dirty, a small amount of fuel can enter the chamber and be ignited, causing a sputter or two after the engine is switched off.|$|E

The MTBE blended <b>diesel</b> fuels are prepared in the different proportions of 5 % & 10 % MTBE blends. The experimental performance consists of a <b>diesel</b> engine coupled with rope brake dynamometer.

50|$|The {{phenomenon}} is {{also referred to}} as 'after-run', or 'run-on' or sometimes <b>dieseling,</b> when it causes the engine to carry on running after the ignition is shut off. This effect is more readily achieved on carbureted gasoline engines, because the fuel supply to the carburetor is typically regulated by a passive mechanical float valve and fuel delivery can feasibly continue until fuel line pressure has been relieved, provided the fuel can be somehow drawn past the throttle plate. The occurrence is rare in modern engines with throttle-body or electronic fuel injection, because the injectors will not be permitted to continue delivering fuel after the engine is shut off, and any occurrence may indicate the presence of a leaking (failed) injector.|$|E
50|$|There are {{indicators}} suggesting K-129 {{suffered a}} similar explosion in 1968. First, the radioactive {{contamination of the}} recovered bow section and the six crewmen of K-129 by weapons grade plutonium indicates {{the explosion of the}} warhead detonator charge of one of the missiles, before the ship reached its crush depth. The report that the forward section was crushed and that charring in the bow section indicated <b>dieseling</b> from an implosion (or alternatively from a fire), would indicate that the explosion occurred while K-129 was submerged and at depth. The report found in Blind Man's Bluff that the wreck revealed K-129 with a 10 ft hole immediately abaft the conning tower would support the theory of an explosion of one of the three missiles in the sail (possibly missile #3). Since K-129s missiles were housed in the sail, much less structural mass (compared to the Yankee-class) was available to contain such an explosion, and loss of depth control of the submarine would be instantaneous.|$|E

40|$|This works {{about the}} engine {{performance}} and emissions characteristics of NOME biodiesel on <b>diesel</b> engine. Overall, the engine {{performance of the}} NOME biodiesel and its blends was only poorer performance than <b>diesel</b> at full load condition. From the view of emissions, NOx emissions were slightly higher in NOME than <b>diesel</b> while un-burnt hydrocarbon emissions were higher for NOME than <b>diesel</b> fuel. The aim of the present work is to prepare Neem oil methyl ester as a <b>diesel</b> fuel substitute. High viscosity and poor volatility are the major limitations of Neem oil for utilization as a fuel in <b>diesel</b> engines. This works discusses the results of investigations carried out on a 4 stroke 4 -cylinder, direct injection, <b>diesel</b> engine operated on methyl esters of Neem oil blended with various blend like pure <b>diesel,</b> B 05 (Biodiesel 5 % and <b>Diesel</b> 95 %), B 10 (Biodiesel 10 % and <b>Diesel</b> 90 %), B 15 (Biodiesel 15 % and <b>Diesel</b> 85 %), B 20 (Biodiesel 20 % and <b>Diesel</b> 80 %) and B 100 (100 % Biodiesel).

40|$|Usage of <b>diesel</b> fuel {{increased}} {{in parallel with}} the increased usage of machines in the agricultural Sector in Turkey. Consequently, the cost of <b>diesel</b> fuel has taken a substantial share within the cost of agricultural products.
