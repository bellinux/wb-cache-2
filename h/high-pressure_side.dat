Two speakers were used in these experiments as actuators: a high-frequency compression driver and a low-frequency woofer. The speaker exit cavity was covered with plates leaving only a small rectangular orifice exit for the synthetic jet. An airtight plexiglass box with a small gap was used to create a simulated leakage flow. The synthetic jet was then directed normally into the leakage flow to reduce the effective gap. The variables considered were as follows: the momentum flux ratio of the actuator over the leakage flow, the reduced frequency, the ratio of the height of the clearance gap over the thickness of the gap, and the ratio of the width of the orifice exit over the thickness o...|$|R

Analogously, the thermally driven Josephson effect is an oscillatory flow that arises in response to a steady temperature difference.

40|$|A vacuum {{compressor}} {{has been}} designed to compress CO 2 from approximately equal to 1 psia (approximately equal to 6. 9 kPa absolute pressure) to approximately equal to 75 psia (approximately equal to 0. 52 MPa), to be insensitive to moisture, to have a long operational life, and to be lightweight, compact, and efficient. The compressor consists mainly of (1) a compression head that includes hydraulic diaphragms, a gas-compression diaphragm, and check valves; and (2) oscillating linear drive that includes a linear motor and a drive spring, through which compression force is applied to the hydraulic diaphragms. The motor is driven at the resonance vibrational frequency of the motor/spring/compression-head system, the compression head acting as a damper that takes energy out of the oscillation. The net effect of the oscillation is to cause cyclic expansion and contraction of the gas-compression diaphragm, and, hence, of the volume bounded by this diaphragm. One-way check valves admit gas into this volume from the low-pressure side during expansion and allow the gas to flow out to the <b>high-pressure</b> <b>side</b> during contraction.

Parametric calculations establish the increased magnitude of the transmitted shock Mach number relative to the shock Mach number for a tube without contraction. The Mach number increase, then increases the pressure and temperature downstream of the small-diameter tube’s incident and reflected shocks, again relative to a tube without a contraction. Shock-tube performance, therefore, can be improved by the addition of a small-diameter tube to an existing tube’s low-pressure side.

40|$|Pressure-energized {{seal rings}} {{intended}} to withstand flows better than do conventional pressure-energized seal rings have been conceived. The concept applies, more specifically, to seal rings used on some valve stems, pistons, and the like. A conventional pressure-energized seal ring generally has a U-shaped cross section {{and consists of}} an elastomer or other suitable polymer with an embedded metal energizing spring (see Figure 1). The working fluid from the <b>high-pressure</b> <b>side</b> that one seeks to seal is allowed into the U-shaped cavity, so that the pressure pushes {{the sides of the}} seal ring tighter against the gland and body sealing surfaces, thereby increasing the degree of sealing. Unfortunately, when the seal ring is exposed to flow of the working fluid, under some conditions, the flow grabs the lip of the U-shaped cross section and ejects or deforms the seal ring so that, thereafter, a proper seal is not obtained. Figure 2 depicts one of several alternative seal rings according to the present concept. One element of the concept is to modify the U-shaped cross section from that of the corresponding conventional seal ring to eliminate the exposed lip and prevent entry of the working fluid into the U-shaped cavity. Unlike in the conventional seal, pressurized fluid would not push the seal ring directly against the both gland and body sealing surfaces. Instead, the pressure would directly push the seal ring against a gland sealing surface only. In so doing, the pressure would squash the seal ring into a smaller volume bounded by the gland and body sealing surfaces, and would thereby indirectly press the seal ring more tightly against the body sealing surface. To enhance the desired squashing deformation, a spring having an approximately parallelogram cross section would be embedded in the modified U-shaped cavity. As the pressure pushed two corners of the approximate parallelogram closer together along the axis of the seal ring, the other two corners of the approximate parallelogram would be pushed farther apart along a radius of the ring, thereby causing the polymeric ring material to push radially harder against the body sealing surface. From the radially innermost corner of the approximate parallelogram, the spring material would extend radially, then axially into recesses in the seal gland. These extensions would help to restrain the seal ring against ejection. A seat retainer would hold the sealing ring in the gland and form a mechanical compression seal to prevent or at least reduce leakage of pressurized fluid into the cavity behind the seal. However, because there would likely be a little leakage, the cavity behind the seal should be vented to the low pressure side to prevent buildup of pressure in the cavity over time; otherwise, the built-up pressure could cause ejection of the seal ring when the pressure on the <b>high-pressure</b> <b>side</b> was reduced. Polymeric seal-ring materials {{may not be able to}} withstand working conditions in applications that involve abrasive and/or hot working fluids. For such applications, all-metal seal rings may be preferred. The bottom part of Figure 2 shows one example of an alternative gland configuration with an all-metal seal ring...|$|E

At the University of Twente, a 14. 5 K hydrogen-based {{sorption}} cooler {{is under}} development. It {{can be used}} as a stand-alone 14. 5 K cooler, or as a precooler, e. g., in combination with a 4 K heliumbased sorption cooler. The advantage of sorption coolers is the absence of moving parts and, as a result, their vibration-free operation and, potentially, a very long life. A 4. 5 K helium-based sorption- cooler stage was developed and built under a previous ESA-TRP contract, and in 2008, a new ESA-sponsored project was started aimed at the development of a hydrogen cooler stage. A demonstrator cooler has been designed that is able to provide 40 mW of cooling at 14. 5 K. It requires an input of 5. 6 W of electric power to a sorption compressor that uses a 90 K radiator as a heat sink. The required radiator area is 1. 9 m 2. The compressor contains two stages consisting of cells filled with activated carbon. The cells are thermally cycled between the heat-sink level of 90 K and about 210 K, causing hydrogen to be periodically adsorbed and desorbed. As a result, hydrogen is pumped from a low-pressure buffer at 0. 1 bar to a medium-pressure buffer at 4 bar, and subsequently to the <b>high-pressure</b> <b>side</b> of the cold stage at 50 bar. The flow direction in this process is controlled by passive valves. In the cold stage the working fluid is precooled by a 50 K radiator (0. 1 m 2).

40|$|AbstractAs {{a natural}} working fluid, CO 2 {{has been widely}} applied in {{refrigeration}} and heat pump systems where heat is conventionally rereleased to ambient through external airflow. Owing to extraordinary thermophysical properties, especially its low critical temperature, the CO 2 heat release through a <b>high-pressure</b> <b>side</b> heat exchanger will inevitably undergo either supercritical or subcritical processes, depending on ambient air temperatures and head pressure controls. Correspondingly, the heat exchanger will act intermittently as either a gas cooler or condenser within the system during an annual operation. Such evidence should therefore {{be taken into account}} for an optimal design of the heat exchanger and head pressure controls in order to significantly enhance the performance of both components and the associated system. To achieve these targets, two CO 2 finned-tube gas coolers/condensers with different structural designs and controls have been purposely built, instrumented and connected with an existing test rig of a CO 2 booster refrigeration system. Consequently, the performance of the CO 2 gas coolers/condensers with different structure designs, controls and system integration at different operating conditions can be thoroughly investigated through experimentation. In the meantime, models of the finned-tube CO 2 gas coolers/condensers have been developed using both the distributed (detailed model) and lumped (simple model) methods. The former is employed to give a detailed prediction of the working fluid temperature profiles, localized heat transfer rates and effects of pipe circuitry arrangements, while the latter is suitable for the simulation and optimisation of system integration with less computation time. Both models have been validated with measurements, and moreover the simple model has been integrated with other component models so as to create a system model. The effects of the CO 2 gas cooler/condenser sizes and controls on the system performance can thus be compared and analysed...|$|E

Patent No. 6, 772, 603 B 2, ''Methods and Apparatus for Thermal Management of Vehicle Systems and Components'' [1], and patent pending, ''Floating Loop System for Cooling Integrated Motors and Inverters Using Hot Liquid Refrigerant'' [2]. The floating-loop system provides a large coefficient of performance (COP) for hybrid-drive component cooling. This loop (based on R- 134 a) is integrated with a vehicle's existing air-conditioning (AC) condenser, which dissipates waste heat to the ambient air. Because the temperature requirements for cooling of power electronics and electric machines are not as low as that required for passenger compartment air, this adjoining loop can operate on the <b>high-pressure</b> <b>side</b> of the existing AC system. This arrangement also allows the floating loop to run without the need for the compressor and only needs a small pump to move the liquid refrigerant. For the design to be viable, the loop must not adversely affect the existing system. The loop should also provide a high COP, a flat-temperature profile, and low-pressure drop. To date, the floating-loop test prototype has successfully removed 2 kW of heat load in a 9 kW automobile passenger AC system with and without the automotive AC system running. The COP for the tested floating-loop system ranges from 40 - 45, as compared to a typical AC system COP of about 2 - 4.

We report here a detailed petrologic examination of the sapphirine-bearing ultra-high temperature (UHT) granulites from the Jining Complex within the Khondalite Belt of the North China Craton (NCC). These granulites carry diagnostic UHT assemblages and their microstructures provide robust evidence to trace the prograde, peak and retrograde metamorphic evolution. The P–T conditions of the granulites estimated from XMgGrt(Mg/Fe + Mg) − XMgSpr isopleth calculations indicate temperature above 970 °C and pressures close to 7 kbar. We present phase diagrams based on thermodynamic computations to evaluate the mineral assemblages and microstructures and trace the metamorphic trajectory of the rocks. The evolution from Spl–Qtz–Ilm–Crd–Grt–Sil to Spr–Qtz–Crd–Opx–Ilm marks the prograde stage. The Spl–Qtz assemblage appears on the low-pressure side of the P–T space with Spr–Qtz stable at the <b>high-pressure</b> <b>side,</b> possibly representing an increase in pressure corresponding to compression. The spectacular development of sapphirine rims around spinel enclosed in quartz supports this inference. An evaluation of the key UHT assemblages based on model proportion calculation suggests a counterclockwise P–T path. With few exceptions, granulite-facies rocks developed along collisional metamorphic zones have generally been characterized by clockwise exhumation trajectories. Recent evaluation of the P–T paths of metamorphic rocks developed within collisional orogens indicates {{that in many cases}} the exhumation trajectories follow the model subduction geotherm, in accordance with a tectonic model in which the metamorphic rocks are subducted and exhumed along a plate boundary. The timing of UHT metamorphism in the NCC (c. 1. 92 Ga) coincides with the assembly of the NCC within the Paleoproterozoic Columbia supercontinent, a process that would have involved subduction of passive margins sediments and closure of the intervening ocean. Thus, the counterclockwise P–T path obtained in this study correlates well with a tectonic model involving subduction and final collisional suturing, with the UHT granulites representing the core of the hot or ultra-hot orogen developed during Columbia amalgamation...|$|E

All these applications require intense sources in order to obtain sufficient reaction rates. Commonly used sources are limited in their operating pressure. The present work is concerned with the development of a compact and simple multipurpose plasma source for the {{production of}} beams of excited, metastable atoms as well as singly charged ions, based on a high-pressure micro-discharge. Scaling down the dimensions of classical low-pressure discharge geometries, we found a micro-electrode system suitable for generating non-thermal, homogeneous discharges at pressures up to several 100 kPa [2]. In contrast to classical planar electrode arrangements we use a multi-layer system of two metallic electrodes separated by an insulating layer. The system has an overall thickness of 250 - 650 µm, depending on the insulator used. This basic system is provided with micro holes with a typical diameter of 60 – 400 µm. Structures with single holes and arrays of multiple holes have been tested. If biased with a DC-voltage, a gas discharge is ignited in the micro hole and the structures serve as plasma micro reactors. In the following we call these multilayer system with holes Micro Structure Electrodes (MSE). Glass, polyimide (Kapton�) and ceramic have been tested as insulating layers [3, 4]. Best results were reached with ceramic, which has suitable thermal and electric properties and a low sputtering coefficient that enables a longer lifetime. Apart from the ‘static ’ operation of the MSE [2, 3, 4, 5] with equal pressures on both sides, up to 1 atmosphere, it is also possible to operate the MSE in ‘flow mode’. Pure gas or a mixture of different gases flows through the micro holes when a pressure difference between the frond and {{the back side of the}} MSE is created, e. g. > 500 hPa at the <b>high-pressure</b> <b>side</b> and 100 kPa anode insulator cathode < 1 hPa- 6 < 10 hPa gas micro discharge supersonic gas jet MSE skimme...|$|E
40|$|Experimental and {{theoretical}} data from systems peridotite- CO_ 2 -H_ 2 O and CaO-MgO-SiO_ 2 -CO_ 2 -H_ 2 O are combined, and extrapolated to 70 Kb {{for construction of}} partly schematic diagrams for subsolidus and near-solidus phase relationships of peridotite containing CO_ 2 and H_ 2 O. The divariant solidus surface for peridotite-vapor {{in the presence of}} CO_ 2 +H_ 2 O is traversed by a series of univariant lines marking the intersections of divariant subsolidus carbonation/decarbonation and hydration/dehydration reactions occurring in the presence of CO_ 2 -H_ 2 O vapors. For H_ 2 O-CO_ 2 contents up to certain limits, the vapor phase composition along these lines is buffered by carbonates or hydrous minerals, and liquid compositions are similarly defined. The approximate positions have been estimated for vapor-buffer lines on the solidus involving dolomite, amphibole, amphibole-dolomite, phlogopite, and phlogopite-dolomite. The buffering capacity of carbonate is far greater than that of hydrous minerals. Considering normal mantle peridotite with olivine, orthopyroxene and clinopyroxene, the maximum amounts of phlogopite and amphibole are produced by about 0. 02 % H_ 2 O and 0. 4 % H_ 2 O, respectively. About 5 % CO_ 2 is required to produce the maximum amount of dolomite without complete reaction of clinopyroxene and loss of peridotite mineralogy. The buffered curve for partly carbonated peridotite extends to lower temperatures and higher pressures from an invariant point near 26 Kb and 1, 200 °C Near this line there is a temperature-maximum on the peridotite-vapor solidus. On the <b>high-pressure</b> <b>side</b> of this maximum, CO_ 2 /H_ 2 O is greater in liquid than in vapor; on the low-pressure side of the maximum (including all pressures below 26 Kb), CO_ 2 /H_ 2 O is greater in vapor than in liquid. Because of this maximum, near-solidus magmas rising along an adiabat would evolve dissolved volatile components in the depth range 100 - 80 km; this could contribute to explosive eruptions. At pressures greater than 30 Kb, mantle peridotite with H_ 2 O and CO_ 2 melts along curves with vapor buffered to high CO_ 2 /H_ 2 O by dolomite (magnesite at higher pressures) or dolomite + phlogopite, or a vapor-absent curve for dolomite-phlogopite-peridotite, producing low-SiO_ 2 magmas. The relationships among carbon, carbonate, and oxygen fugacity are important for determination of magma compositions...|$|E
40|$|Currently, the two {{dominant}} desalination {{methods are}} reverse osmosis (RO) and multi-stage flash (MSF). RO requires large capital investment and maintenance, whereas MSF is too energy intensive. An innovative vapor-compression desalination system is developed in this study. A {{comprehensive mathematical model}} for the heat exchanger/evaporator is described. The literature indicates that extraordinarily high overall heat transfer coefficients for the evaporator are possible at selected operating conditions that employ dropwise condensation in the steam side and pool boiling in the liquid side. A smooth titanium surface is chosen to promote dropwise condensation and to resist corrosion. To maximize energy efficiency, a combined-cycle cogeneration scheme is employed composed of a gas turbine, a heat recovery boiler, and a steam turbine that drive a compressor. The combined-cycle power source is oversized relative {{to the needs of}} the compressor. The excess power is converted to electricity and sold to the open market. A three-effect evaporator is employed. It is fed with seawater, assumed to be 3. 5 % salt. Boiling brine (7 % salt) is in the low pressure side of the heat exchanger and condensing steam is in the <b>high-pressure</b> <b>side</b> of the heat exchanger. The condensing steam flows at 1. 52 m/s (5 ft/s), which maximizes the heat transfer coefficient. The plant is sized to produce 37, 854 m 3 /d (10 mill gal/day) and is assumed to be financed with a 5 %, 30 -yr municipal bond. Two economic cases were emphasized: the United States and the Middle East. For the United States, the fuel costs $ 5 /GJ ($ 5. 27 /mill Btu) with the latent heat exchanger at () 1. 11 K 2. 00 F T ?? = ??. The required compressor energy is 14 MJ/m 3 (14. 7 kW h/thous gal). The capital cost for the U. S. is $ 884 d/m 3 ($ 3, 342 /thous gal) and the delivered water selling price is $ 0. 47 /m 3 ($ 1. 79 /thous/gal). For the Middle East, the fuel costs $ 0. 5 /GJ ($ 0. 53 /mill Btu) with the latent heat exchanger at K T 33. 3 = ?? () F 00. 6 ??.
