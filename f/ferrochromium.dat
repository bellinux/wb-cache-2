40|$|ABSTRACT The {{results are}} {{presented}} of {{a study of the}} overall mortality and the incidence of cancer in male workers producing ferrosilicon and <b>ferrochromium.</b> Although the study included all present and retired workers employed in the factory for more than one year from 1928 until 1977 inclusive, the incidence of cancer in those 976 workers who started work before 1 January 1960 was studied in particular. Both the overall mortality and the incidence of cancer for all sites were lower than expected when compared with the national expected figures. Nine cases of lung cancer were found in the total population—seven in the <b>ferrochromium</b> subpopulation against expected rates of 3 · 1 and 1 · 8 when using national and local expected rates respectively as reference, and less than one expected case when using an internal reference population. A 1 · 5 O/E ratio was found for prostatic cancer in the whole study population. The results indicate that the increased incidence of lung cancer in the <b>ferrochromium</b> group has a causal relationship to occupational exposure. Perforation of the nasal septum was found in two present <b>ferrochromium</b> workers, and hexavalent chromium was found in the working atmosphere at the <b>ferrochromium</b> arc-furnaces during an industrial hygiene survey carried out in 1975. It is therefore concluded that the raised incidence of lung cancer is partly due to exposure to chromates. The results do not support the suggestion that exposure to chromic compounds entails a cancer hazard similar to that of exposure to hexavalent chromium compounds...|$|E

40|$|High carbon <b>ferrochromium</b> is {{produced}} by carbon reduction. No replacement for carbon as reductant has yet been developed. The reduction creates {{a considerable amount of}} CO-gas. In open and semi-closed furnaces the gas is burned when leaving the burden. In closed furnaces the formed gas is sucked out by a fan, washed and utilised as fuel. The formation of carbon monoxide is presented briefly starting from thermodynamic considerations up to solid and liquid state reduction. The volume, composition and energy content of the furnace gas are discussed, focusing on the raw materials and pre-treatment processes of the furnace feed {{as well as on the}} process equipment and control. Outokumpu has been using closed and sealed furnaces and utilising the CO-gas in its Tornio Ferrochrome Works since 1968. Today in Tornio with an annual <b>ferrochromium</b> production of 260 000 t CO-gas production is 186 million m 3, representing 68 MWh an hour. At the same time the furnace power input is 95 MW.

Very satisfactory degrees of prereduction of Greek chromites were attained, which were strongly dependent on parameters such as temperature, time, variations of carbon addition, particle size of reactants, chromite composition, and type of carbonaceous reducing agent.

40|$|A Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) of {{stainless}} steel production, including that of the nickel, ferronickel, <b>ferrochromium</b> and iron feedstocks was carried out using inventory data derived from the literature. The environmental impact categories considered {{in the study were}} Global Warming Potential (GWP), Acidification Potential (AP) and total (or full cycle) energy consumption. The effects of different sources of electricity (black coal, natural gas and hydroelectricity) were also examined in the study. The results of the LCA showed that when ferronickel is used as the nickel source, the total energy consumption for stainless steel production is approximately 50 % higher than when nickel metal is used as the nickel source (75 MJ/kg cf. 49 MJ/kg). This result comes about largely because the Fe units in ferronickel have a much higher energy intensity than do the Fe units in pig iron, and the greater the use of the former {{at the expense of the}} latter, the greater is the total energy consumption. The results also showed that the production of ferronickel made by far the largest contribution (59 %) to the total energy consumption for stainless steel production when this feedstock is used as the nickel source, but when nickel metal is used as the nickel source the contributions of the various stages are more evenly distributed. It was also observed that the electricity consumption of the electric furnaces used in the production of ferronickel, <b>ferrochromium</b> and stainless steel contributed approximately 50 % to the total energy consumed in stainless steel production. Given the relatively low efficiencies associated with electrical power generation, significant reductions in the total energy {{of stainless}} steel production could be anticipated if more direct use of thermal energy was made in the ferronickel, <b>ferrochromium</b> and/or stainless steel smelting stages, for example by utilising bath smelting processes...|$|E
