5000|$|Unconditional jump [...] - [...] {{the program}} exit code (P field) {{specifies}} a Program <b>exit</b> <b>hub</b> {{on the control}} panel, which has a wire plugged into it and, via distributors, to Program entry hubs specifying the first, second and third address digit of the instruction to jump to.|$|E
5000|$|Conditional jump [...] - [...] {{the program}} exit code (P field) {{specifies}} a Program <b>exit</b> <b>hub</b> {{on the control}} panel, which has a wire plugged into it and the appropriate Condition selector common hub to be tested, the corresponding two Condition selector output hubs have wires plugged into them and the Program entry hubs specifying the instructions to jump to or the Program advance hub to continue in sequence. Complicated conditions involving many Condition selectors could be wired to execute in a single instruction (e.g., Testing the sign and zero states of multiple accumulators), with one of several Program entry hubs activated.|$|E
5000|$|Digit {{selectors}} {{were similar}} to emitters, with one <b>exit</b> <b>hub</b> for each cycle point, but they also had an entry hub that was switched to the successive exit hubs as the cycle progressed. A digit selector could be converted to a digit emitter by wiring its entry hub to {{a constant source of}} cycle pulses. But it could also be fed other signals and used to detect a particular digit. Wiring a first read brush to a digit selector's entry and connecting, say, its 4 exit to a pilot selector's D entry would cause that selector to transfer on the next read cycle if a 4 was punched in that first read brush's column.|$|E
5000|$|Emitters were sets of 12 <b>exit</b> <b>hubs</b> that {{automatically}} generated a pulse at each specified {{time in the}} card cycle. The twelve <b>exit</b> <b>hubs</b> were wired to contacts on a rotary switch that turned with the card cycle. Thus wiring the 6 exit from an emitter to a punch magnet entry would cause a 6 to be punched at that position. Emitters {{might be used to}} put a numeric constant value, say a date, on every card. Alphanumeric constant data could be created by carefully combining digit and zone pulses. Later machines, such as the 407 also had a complete set of alphanumeric emitters that only required one wire to use.|$|R
5000|$|Read brushes, 80 <b>exit</b> <b>hubs,</b> one {{for each}} card column. A tabulating machine might {{have two or three}} read stations, each with its own set of 80 hubs. A {{reproducing}} punch might have an additional read station after the punch station for verification.|$|R
50|$|The {{operation}} of the 407 was directed {{by the use of}} a removable control panel and a carriage tape. <b>Exit</b> <b>hubs</b> (impulse emitting) on the control panel are wired to entry hubs (impulse accepting) for the task to be done (see Wiring of unit record equipment). There are hubs for each card column (at both reading stations), print position, counter digit, and so on. Logic tests were also available.|$|R
5000|$|Comparing. Simple {{comparing}} circuits had two entries and one exit that emitted a pulse whenever pulses {{arrived at the}} entries at different times. Some machines, e.g. collators, could detect which number was higher {{if they were not}} equal. A tabulating machine might compare the account number on successive cards and print a total when a new account number appeared. For the compare function, IBM implemented what would now be called an XOR gate using opposing electromagnets. If neither magnet was energized or both magnets were energized at the same time, the relay armature would not move. If only one magnet was energized, the armature would move and touch one of two contacts placed on either side. The two contacts were wired together internally and connected to an <b>exit</b> <b>hub</b> that indicated an unequal comparison.|$|E
40|$|The {{calibration}} tests {{carried out}} on the propulsion system components of a 70 percent scale, powered model of a NASA 3 -fan V/STOL aircraft configuration are described. The three X 3 / 6 B/T 58 turbotip fan units used in the large scale powered model were tested on an isolated basis over a range of ground heights from H/D of 1. 02 to infinity. A higher pressure ratio LF 336 /J 85 fan unit was tested over a range of ground heights from 1. 55 to infinity. The results of the test program demonstrated that: (1) the thrust and mass flow performance of the X 376 B/T 58 nose lift unit is essentially constant for H/D variations down to 1. 55; at H/D 1. 02 back pressurization of the fan exit occurs and is accompanied {{by an increase in}} thrust of five percent; (2) a change in nose fan <b>exit</b> <b>hub</b> shape from flat plate to hemispherical produces no significant difference in louvered lift nozzle performance for height variations from H/D = 1. 02 to infinity; (3) operation of the nose lift nozzle at the higher fan pressure ratio generated by the LF 336 /J 85 fan system causes no significant change in ground proximity performance down to an H/D of 1. 55, the lowest height tested with this unit; and (4) the performance of the left and right X 376 B/T 58 lift/cruise units in the vertical lift mode remains unchanged, within plus or minus two percent for the range of ground heights from H/D = 1. 02 to infinity...|$|E
40|$|Distributed {{solar thermal}} {{combined}} heat and power {{is an area}} where there is potential for significant innovation to reduce the cost of solar energy. Two areas for innovation were explored: reduced thermal losses in a novel dual-chamber absorber tube and parametric study for optimal efficiency of small-scale (5 - 10 kW) radial inflow turbines. Increasing the peak temperature in solar thermal systems typically increases the cycle thermal efficiency. However, the outer wall temperature of the absorber tube also increases causing greater thermal losses to the surroundings. A novel finned dual-chamber absorber tube design was presented as a possible solution. Fins attached to the outer wall could serve as a heat sink to send heat into the inner chamber. Computation modeling was validated by a reduced-scale experiment to the accuracy of the correlations used. From these models, it has been demonstrated that the heat loss to the environment from the outer wall of the absorber tube could be reduced by 10 - 60 %. The best performance was found when water enters the outer chamber at the highest mass flow rate tested. This impressive improvement encourages further development of the dual chamber design. One of the primary obstacles of scaling down solar thermal technology for distributed power generation is finding an appropriate expander design. The radial inflow turbine was considered. A parametric study of seventeen input parameters was completed. Of these parameters, the mass flow rate, r 2,h r 2,t (ratio of rotor <b>exit</b> <b>hub</b> radius to rotor exit tip radius) and r 2,t r 1 a (ratio of rotor exit tip to rotor inlet radius) had the greatest influence on the thermal efficiency of the system. Decreasing the mass flow rate both increased the turbine efficiency and increased the pressure drop across the turbine both of which enhanced the thermal efficiency. The optimized value of r 2,h r 2,t and r 2,t r 1 a depended on the type of fluid. Wet fluids had an optimal performance with low values of r 2,t r 1 a but high values of r 2,h r 2,t. Dry fluids had an optimal thermal performance with low values of both r 2,h r 2,t and r 2,t r 1 a. Of the fluids studied it appears that dry fluids with low molecular mass and high critical temperature yielded the greatest thermal efficiency. Such fluids typically have low viscosity, allowing there to be less frictional losses in the turbine leading to better thermal efficiencies. Unfortunately, these fluids also share the characteristic of being highly toxic. In order for the radial inflow turbine to scale with reasonable efficiency, a non-toxic dry fluid with low molecular mass and high critical temperature would need to be found...|$|E
40|$|Induced lift of a subsonic, three fan, lift/cruise, V/STOL {{aircraft}} configuration was investigated using scale modes of a multimission aircraft whose design incorporates a nose mounted lift fan and two lift/cruise units located over the wing. Configuration effects were assessed for lift improvement devices, lift/cruise nozzle rails, nozzle perimeter plates, and alternate nose fan <b>exit</b> <b>hubs.</b> Tests were conducted at four model heights (H/D = 0. 95, 1. 53, 3. 06 and 6. 45, where D {{is the average}} nozzle exit diameter equal to 0. 997 m.)

50|$|Ianto first {{encounters}} Jack {{by helping}} him fight a Weevil 21 months earlier. Ianto {{asks for a}} job, but is rejected by Jack after Ianto {{was found to have}} worked for Torchwood London. The next morning, Ianto gives Jack coffee as he <b>exits</b> the <b>Hub.</b> Jack recalls knowledge about Ianto, stating that he researched him after he was able to identify a Weevil. Ianto again asks for a job, as his old job was lost when Torchwood One was destroyed, but Jack states that he had severed all ties with Torchwood One and refuses. That night, Ianto steps in front of the SUV, and once more asks for a job. After Jack threatens to run him down, Ianto explains he is pursuing a pterodactyl. After a long battle (in which Jack implies he survived Cretaceous-Paleogene extinction event), the two manage to sedate the creature. Finding themselves pressed together on the ground, they experience a moment of sexual tension, before Ianto excuses himself. Jack tells Ianto that he expects to see him at work the following morning.|$|R
5000|$|Actuated Transit Phase(s): These are phases {{that are}} only called if a transit vehicle is present. These might be seen along {{streetcar}} lines or on dedicated bus lanes. They {{could also be used}} where transit vehicles are allowed to make movements that general traffic is not (“No Left Turn Except Buses”) or at the entrances and <b>exits</b> to transit <b>hubs</b> (e.g. bus stations). Transit signal faces often look different from a standard green/yellow/red face to avoid confusion with the signals for general traffic. For example, bus traffic signals may show a letter [...] "B" [...] while trams and Light Rail Vehicles may show a letter [...] "T".|$|R
40|$|Problem statement: The {{objective}} {{of this study is}} to improve runner design of the Francis turbine and analyze its performance with the Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) technique. Approach: A runner design process uses a direct method with the following design conditions: flow rate of 3. 12 m 3 /sec head of 46. 4 m and speed of 750 rpm or dimensionless specific speed of 0. 472. Results: The first stage involves the calculation of various dimensions such as the blade inlet and <b>exit</b> angle at <b>hub</b> and the mean and shroud positions to depict the meridional plane. The second stage deals with the CFD simulation. Various results were calculated and analyzed for factors affecting runners performance. Results indicated that the head rise of the runner at the design point was approximately 39 m, which is lower than the specified head. Based on past experiences, the meridional plane was modified and blade inlet and lean angles were corrected. The process of meridional plane modification was repeated until the head rise was nearly equal to the specified head. Velocity vector and streamline should be a uniform stream. Conclusion/Recommendations: Results from calculating runners performance were approximately 90 % at design point. Existing absolute velocity component from CFD simulation pointed out that swirling flow occurred at the exit of runner. Based on the comparison of runners performance between simulation results and experimental data from previous work reported in the literature, it is possible to use this method to simulate runners performance of the Francis turbine...|$|R
