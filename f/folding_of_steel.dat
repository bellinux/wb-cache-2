Apesar disso, a maioria (88 %) delas ainda prepara as armaduras no próprio canteiro. A proposta deste trabalho e criar urna ferramenta de comparação entre estas duas formas de preparação de armadura, que gere informações para o construtor avaliar e decidir sobre a melhor delas, além de possibilitar o levantamento de uma serie de índices de produtividade relacionados ao serviço. Estudos de casos em 4 edificações verticais de 4 a 18 pavimentos, testaram e avaliaram a ferramenta, e apresentaram em media resultados de custo favoráveis ao processo industrializado em tomo de 8, 09 %. Com relação aos índices de produtividade relacionados ao serviço, verificou-se que em todos os casos ha a necessidade de interferências corretivas em relação a eficiência. ABSTRACT: The {{construction}} companies, {{in their}} search for quality, low costs, and timely delivery of constructions, can currently utilize industrial cutting and <b>folding</b> <b>of</b> <b>steel</b> to prepare concrete structures. Nevertheless the great majority of these companies (88 %) still prepare by hand their armors in the construction site. The goal of this work is to create a technical tool to compare these two methods of steel preparation (manipulation) during the construction process, and to generate information which will help the constructor to evaluate and decide which one is more appropriate for his (or her) project. Another goal is to measure a series of productivity index related to the job. Case studies were carried our in which constructions of 4 up to 18 pavements were analyzed. The results of the industrialized process were in average 8, 09 % superior in comparison to those of handmade process. Regarding the indexes of productivity, we observed that in all cases studies there is the need of adjustments with respect to the efficiency...|$|E

While shields can be used to block sword attacks, in South Asia they are more often used offensively as an impact weapon or pushed against the opponent to prevent them from attacking, in addition to deflecting projectiles. A dagger is often held in the same hand, protruding from under the shield. Coupled with the fact that most indigenous swords have little defensive capability, swordsmanship in gatka relies heavily on avoiding and outmaneuvering an opponent's attack.|$|R

5000|$|Usually each segment in this chain (which is {{constructed}} from riveted metal sections {{similar to a}} bicycle chain, but without rollers) features small sharp cutting teeth. Each tooth takes the form <b>of</b> a <b>folded</b> tab <b>of</b> chromium-plated <b>steel</b> with a sharp angular or curved corner and two cutting edges, one on the top plate {{and one on the}} side plate. Left-handed and right-handed teeth are alternated in the chain. Chains come in varying pitch and gauge; the pitch of a chain is defined as half of the length spanned by any three consecutive rivets (e.g., 8 mm, 0.325 inch), while the gauge is the thickness of the drive link where it fits into the guide bar (e.g., 1.5 mm, 0.05 inch). Conventional [...] "full complement" [...] chain has one tooth for every two drive links. [...] "Full skip" [...] chain has one tooth for every three drive links. Built into each tooth is a depth gauge or [...] "raker" [...] which rides ahead of the tooth and limits the depth of cut, typically to around 0.5 mm (0.025"). Depth gauges are critical to safe chain operation. If left too high they will cause very slow cutting, if filed too low the chain will become more prone to kick back. Low depth gauges will also cause the saw to vibrate excessively. Vibration is not only uncomfortable for the operator but is also detrimental to the saw.|$|R

40|$|ABSTRACT: The {{role of the}} C-terminal loop L 137 -S 141 in {{the folding}} and <b>folding</b> {{stability}} <b>of</b> staphylococcal nuclease (SNase) was investigated by deletion mutation. The C-terminal truncated SNase fragments, SNase 137, SNase 139, SNase 140, and SNase 141 containing residues 1 - 137, 1 - 139, 1 - 140, and 1 - 141, respectively, were adopted in this study. <b>Folding</b> states <b>of</b> these four SNase fragments were analyzed by circular dichroism and fluorescence measurements. The solution structure of SNase 140 was determined and compared to those of SNase 141 and native SNase using the heteronuclear NMRmethod. The results showed that <b>folding</b> <b>of</b> the four SNase fragments is correlated with the <b>folding</b> <b>of</b> helix R 3. With the chain length extending from L 137 and I 139 to S 141, <b>folding</b> <b>of</b> the fragments progressively approached to the tertiary <b>folding</b> <b>of</b> native SNase, and the folding stability was enhanced. These observations revealed that the C-terminal loop L 137 -S 141 has profound effect {{not only on the}} <b>folding</b> <b>of</b> helix R 3 but also on the stabilizing <b>folding</b> <b>of</b> both theR- and β-subdomains of SNase.
