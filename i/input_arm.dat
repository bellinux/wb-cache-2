50|$|Running {{through the}} middle of the drums are two {{separate}} shafts, for input and output. Both end with a cam (obscured in the attached sketch), which via a follower and a rocking arm holds one end of each rope. If the input shaft rotates from the null position, its cam raises or lowers the input follower, which via the rocking <b>input</b> <b>arm</b> tensions the rope on one drum and slackens the other. In that state, one drum applies much greater traction than the other, resulting in both the output shaft and a cage mounting the input and output arms moving to track the input. As soon as the cage and the output shaft have moved to the correct position, the tension in the two ropes regains equilibrium and relative motion stops. In this way, the motion of the output shaft closely tracks the motion of the input, although the torque applied to it is the torque of the motor driving the system, as opposed to the much smaller torque applied to the input shaft.|$|E

Of the approaches demonstrated so far, only four-wave mixing (FWM) in semiconductor optical amplifiers (SOAs) is fully transparent to modulation format and bit rate while providing arbitrary wavelength mapping.

40|$|This paper {{addresses}} certain functional learning {{tasks in}} signal processing using familiar algorithms and analytical tools of least squares for {{autoregressive moving average}} exogonous <b>input</b> (<b>ARM</b> AX) models. The models {{can be viewed as}} conventional ARM AX models but with parameters dependent on variables such as inputs or states. termed function input variables. The functional dependence of the parameters on these variables is represented in terms of basis function expansions, or more generaliv interpoiation function representations. The interpolation functions in a least squares identification of coefficients also turn out to be in essence spread functions that spread learning throughout the space of function input variables. Thus for a set of training sequences. or trajectories in function input space, system parameters and thereby system functional can be updated. The idea is that these will have relevance for similar sequences or neighboring trajectories. The concept of persistence of excitation to achieve complete function learning, or equivalently, signal model learning is studied using least squares convergence results. Application of the proposed algorithms and theory within the signal processing context is addressed by means of simple illustrative examples. ...|$|E

40|$|International audienceRecent studies report {{efficient}} vestibular {{control of}} goal-directed arm movements during body motion. This contribution tested whether this control relies (a) on an updating {{process in which}} vestibular signals are used to update the perceived egocentric position of surrounding objects when body orientation changes, or (b) on a sensorimotor process, i. e. a transfer function between vestibular <b>input</b> and the <b>arm</b> motor output that preserves hand trajectory in space despite body rotation. Both processes were separately and specifically adapted. We then compared the respective influences of the adapted processes on the vestibular control of arm-reaching movements. The rationale was that if a given process underlies a given behavior, any adaptive modification of this process should give rise to observable modification of the behavior. The updating adaptation adapted the matching between vestibular input and perceived body displacement in the surrounding world. The sensorimotor adaptation adapted the matching between vestibular <b>input</b> and the <b>arm</b> motor output necessary to keep the hand fixed in space during body rotation. Only the sensorimotor adaptation significantly altered the vestibular control of arm-reaching movements. Our results therefore suggest that during passive self-motion, the vestibular control of arm-reaching movements essentially derives from a sensorimotor process by which arm motor output is modified on-line to preserve hand trajectory in space despite body displacement. In contrast, the updating process maintaining up-to-date the egocentric representation of visual space seems to contribute little to generating the required arm compensation during body rotations...|$|R
40|$|Experiments {{were carried}} out on blindfolded human {{subjects}} to study the contribution of proprioceptive <b>inputs</b> from both <b>arms</b> in a forearm position matching task. Blindfolded matching accuracy was compared with accuracy when the subject could see their indicator (matching) arm, when they used a dummy arm for matching, and when they looked at {{a mirror image of}} the matching arm. The position of the mirror had been arranged so that the image of the indicator arm coincided with the position of the reference arm. None of these conditions significantly altered the matching errors. When reference elbow flexors were vibrated at 70 â€“ 80 Hz, the illusion of extension of the vibrated arm reported by blindfolded subjects was significantly reduced by vision of the mirror image of the indicator arm or when using the dummy arm. It was concluded that visual information about the position of the indicator arm, or the apparent position of the reference arm, could reduce the size of the kinaesthetic illusion from vibration, but not abolish it. In a second experiment, subjects indicated, by tracking with their vibrated arm, the illusion of forearm extension evoked by elbow flexor vibration. It was found that the perceived speed of extension could be reduced by moving the indicator into extension and increased by moving it into flexion. These experiments demonstrate the importance for the matching process of the input provided by the indicator arm. Such a conclusion may help to explain some apparent discrepancies between observations made on position sense using one-arm and two-arm tasks. More broadly, this paper provides support for the idea that aspects of proprioceptive <b>inputs</b> from both <b>arms</b> are processed conjointly, as part of a strategy for use of the two hands as a single instrument in certain skilled tasks...|$|R

Although most recent {{studies have focused on}} the inhibitory influences of afferent <b>inputs</b> on <b>arm</b> motor responses evoked by transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS), facilitatory effects are rarely considered. In the present work, we sought to establish how proprioceptive sensory inputs modulate the excitability of the primary motor cortex region controlling certain hand and wrist muscles. Suprathreshold TMS pulses were preceded either by median nerve stimulation (MNS) or index finger stimulation with interstimulus intervals (ISIs) ranging from 20 to 200 ms (with particular focus on 40 - 80 ms). Motor-evoked potentials recorded in the abductor pollicis brevis (APB), first dorsalis interosseus and extensor carpi radialis muscles were strongly facilitated (by up to 150 %) by MNS with ISIs of around 60 ms, whereas digit stimulation had only a weak effect. When MNS was delivered at the interval that evoked the optimal facilitatory effect, the H-reflex amplitude remained unchanged and APB motor responses evoked with transcranial electric stimulation were not increased as compared with TMS. Afferent-induced facilitation and short-latency intracortical inhibition (SICI) and intracortical facilitation (ICF) mechanisms are likely to interact in cortical circuits, as suggested by the strong facilitation observed when MNS was delivered concurrently with ICF and the reduction of SICI following MNS. We conclude that afferent-induced facilitation is a mechanism which probably involves muscle spindle afferents and should be considered when studying sensorimotor integration mechanisms in healthy and disease situations...|$|R

Although the two processes could be intertwined, they are generally thought to occur in series, whereby visuomotor planning begins with the knowledge of a final hand position to attain. However, daily activities are often compatible with an infinity of final hand positions. The {{purpose of the present study}} was to test whether the reach endpoint (where') is an <b>input</b> of <b>arm</b> motor planning (how') in such ecological settings. To this end, we considered a free pointing task, namely arm pointing to a long horizontal line, and investigated the formation of the reach endpoint through eye-hand coordination. Although eye movement always preceded hand movement, our results showed that the saccade initiation was delayed by similar to 120 ms on average when the line was being pointed to as compared with a single target dot; the hand reaction time was identical in the two conditions. When the latency of saccade initiation was relatively brief, subjects often performed double, or even triple, saccades before hand movement onset. The number of saccades triggered was found to significantly increase as a function of the primary saccade latency and accuracy. These results suggest that knowledge about the reach endpoint built up gradually along with the arm motor planning process, and that the oculomotor system delayed the primary reach-related saccade in order to gain more information about the final hand position...|$|R

It infected neurons at sites known to project to the arm area of the primary motor cortex (e. g., ventrolateral thalamus). In addition, "second-order" neurons were labeled in the deep cerebellar nuclei (dentate and interpositus) and in the globus pallidus (internal segment). This result supports the concept that the arm area of the primary motor cortex is a target of both cerebellar and basal ganglia output.

Using regression approaches we search for a model that is a good morphological predictor of these bite forces. Body mass, an index that ignores differences in skull morphology, has a statistically significant relationship with bite force (R 2 = 0. 76) but is a relatively poor predictor compared with our best model (R 2 = 0. 94). The two best models of the eight we examine are one based on an estimate of strength of dentary, which is really simple beam theory; and the other based on muscle mass and jaw mechanics of <b>input</b> and output <b>arms.</b> Both models explain about 90 % of the variation in bite force.

Control is based upon a master/slave relationship. Arm trajectory is defined by through 'master' positioning head which moves a laser through a programmed path. Tip position is detected by an optical system which produces an error signal proportional to the displacement of the tip from the demand laser spot position. The error signal and its derivative form <b>inputs</b> to the <b>arm</b> 'slave' controller so enabling direct tip control with simultaneous correction for arm bending.

This study compared eight non-keyboard input devices in conjunction with a standing fatigue study. The rapid growth in the use of graphical user interfaces (GUI's) has caused an increase in the use of nonkeyboard input devices. Further, the limited amount of literature available on non-keyboard input devices, especially studying standing input device usage, has caused concern about the increased usage. Eight subjects (4 male and 4 female) used each of the eight input devices (IBM Options mouse, Logitech Sensa mouse, Microsoft mouse 2. 0, Logitech Trackman trackball, MicroSpeed trackball, Logitech Portable trackball, Glidepoint touch pad, and PC Stylus mouse pen) for two hours on each of two consecutive days. This study used physiological, performance, and subjective measures to determine differences between the input devices. The physiological measures used included the following: finger tip temperature, hand temperature, forearm temperature, arm volume, systolic and diastolic blood pressures, median nerve conduction velocity, and finger tip vibration sensitivity. The performance measure used was a simple tracking test with three different target presentation speeds, Subjective measures included perceived levels of pain and discomfort (body part discomfort survey), a specific input device features survey and an overall ranking. The following measures showed statistical significance for individual <b>input</b> devices: <b>arm</b> volume, all three presentation speed tracking performance tests, the input device features survey, and overall ranking. Further analysis showed significance for input device types (mice, trackballs, and 'others') for all of these measures except arm volume. The other measures taken during the experiment (arm, hand, and finger temperature, systolic and diastolic blood pressure, vibration sensitivity, nerve conduction time, and body part discomfort), while not showing strict statistical significance for the different devices, all indicated trends away from zero and may be indicators of work load or fatigue. Throughout the experiment, mice were shown to be superior to the other input devices in both performance and preference. There was, however, no one mouse clearly better than the rest. The best trackball was the Logitech Trackman, with performance and preference ratings often not significantly different from the mice...|$|R

The goal {{of the present study}} was to investigate whether the stretch reflex response magnitude of spastic finger flexor muscles poststroke is influenced by sensory input from the shoulder and the elbow and whether reflex coupling of muscles throughout the upper limb is altered in spastic stroke survivors. Through imposed extension of the metacarpophalangeal (MCP) joints, stretch of the relaxed finger flexors of the four fingers was imposed in 10 relaxed stroke subjects under different conditions of proximal sensory <b>input,</b> namely static <b>arm</b> posture (3 different shoulder/elbow postures) and electrical stimulation (surface stimulation of biceps brachii or triceps brachii, or none). Fast (300 Â°/s) imposed stretch elicited stretch reflex flexion torque at the MCP joints and reflex electromyographic (EMG) activity in flexor digitorum superficialis. Both measures were greatest in an arm posture of 90 Â° of elbow flexion and neutral shoulder position. Biceps stimulation resulted in greater MCP stretch reflex flexion torque. Fast imposed stretch also elicited reflex EMG activity in nonstretched heteronymous upper limb muscles, both proximal and distal. These results suggest that in the spastic hemiparetic upper limb poststroke, sensorimotor coupling of proximal and distal upper limb segments is involved in both the increased stretch reflex response of the finger flexors and an increased reflex coupling of heteronymous muscles. Both phenomena may be mediated through changes poststroke in the spinal reflex circuits and/or in the descending influence of supraspinal pathways...|$|R

It includes data from literature in a structured form. Objective. To review the anatomy and biomechanics of the back muscles related to the lumbar spine with relevance for biomechanical modeling. Summary of Background Data. To reduce complexity, muscle units have been incorporated in an abridged manner, reducing their actions more or less to a single force equivalent. In early models of the lumbar spine, this may have been a necessary step to reduce complexity and, thereby, calculation time. The muscles of the spine are well described in the literature, but mainly qualitatively. Most of the literature provides a description of the structures without precise data of fiber length, muscle length, cross-sectional areas, moment arms, forces, etc. The predicted output of musculoskeletal models is very much dependent on the input parameters. The information needed to improve models consists of better approximations of the attachments to the vertebrae, and more precise data. Method. Review of literature. Results. The predicted output of musculoskeletal models is very much dependent on the input parameters. Moderate changes in the assumed muscle line-of-action (i. e., moment arm) could substantially alter the magnitudes of predicted muscle and spinal forces, while the choice of optimization formulation is less sensitive. Conclusions. <b>Input</b> parameters, moment <b>arms,</b> as well as physiologic cross-sectional areas {{have a profound effect on}} the predicted muscle forces. Therefore, it is important to choose the values for moment arm and physiologic cross-sectional area carefully because they are essential input parameters to biomechanical models...|$|R
40|$|In {{this thesis}} a novel {{guidance}} method for a 3 -degree-of-freedom robotic manipulator arm in 3 dimensions for Improvised Explosive Device (IED) disposal has been developed. The work {{carried out in}} this thesis combines existing methods to develop a technique that delivers advantages taken from several other guidance techniques. These features are necessary for the IED disposal application. The work carried out in this thesis includes kinematic and dynamic modelling of robotic manipulators, T-space to C-space conversion, and path generation using Graph Theory to produce a guidance technique which can plan a safe path through a complex unknown environment. The method improves upon advantages given by other techniques in that it produces a suitable path in 3 -dimensions in close-proximity environments in real time with no a priori knowledge of the environment, a necessary precursor to the application of this technique to IED disposal missions. To {{solve the problem of}} path planning, the thesis derives the kinematics and dynamics of a robotic arm in order to convert the Euclidean coordinates of measured environment data into C-space. Each dimension in C-space is one control <b>input</b> of the <b>arm.</b> The Euclidean start and end locations of the manipulator end effector are translated into C-space. A three-dimensional path is generated between them using Dijkstraâ€™s Algorithm. The technique allows for a single path to be generated to guide the entire arm through the environment, rather than multiple paths to guide each component through the environment. The robotic arm parameters are modelled as a quasi-linear parameter varying system. As such it requires gain scheduling control, thus allowing compensation of the non-linearities in the system. A Genetic Algorithm is applied to tune a set of PID controllers for the dynamic model of the manipulator arm so that the generated path can then be followed using a conventional path-following algorithm. The technique proposed in this thesis is validated using numerical simulations in order to determine its advantages and limitations...|$|R
40|$|Optimal control {{methods are}} applied to {{mechanical}} models in order to predict the control strategies in human arm movements. Optimality criteria are used to determine unique controls for a biomechanical model of the human upper-limb with redundant actuators. The motivation for this thesis {{is to provide a}} non-task-specific method of motion prediction as a tool for movement researchers and for controlling human models within virtual prototyping environments. The current strategy is based on determining the muscle activation levels (control signals) necessary to perform a task that optimizes several physical determinants of the model such as muscular and joint stresses, as well as performance timing. Currently, the initial and final location, orientation, and velocity of the hand define the desired task. Several models of the human arm were generated using a graph-theoretical method in order to take advantage of similar system topology through the evolution of arm models. Within this framework, muscles were modelled as non-linear actuator components acting between origin and insertion points on rigid body segments. Activation levels of the muscle actuators are considered the control <b>inputs</b> to the <b>arm</b> model. Optimization of the activation levels is performed via a hybrid genetic algorithm (GA) and a sequential quadratic programming (SQP) technique, which provides a globally optimal solution without sacrificing numerical precision, unlike traditional genetic algorithms. Advantages of the underlying genetic algorithm approach are that it does not require any prior knowledge of what might be a 'good' approximation in order for the method to converge, and it enables several objectives {{to be included in the}} evaluation of the fitness function. Results indicate that this approach can predict optimal strategies when compared to benchmark minimum-time maneuvers of a robot manipulator. The formulation and integration of the aforementioned components into a working model and the simulation of reaching and lifting tasks represents the bulk of the thesis. Results are compared to motion data collected in the laboratory from a test subject performing the same tasks. Discrepancies in the results are primarily due to model fidelity. However, more complex models are not evaluated due to the additional computational time required. The theoretical approach provides an excellent foundation, but further work is required to increase the computational efficiency of the numerical implementation before proceeding to more complex models...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{deals with}} the design and {{manufacturing}} of a mechanical variable valve actuation system, developed {{as part of the}} MUR financed research project concerning the realization of a high performance motorcycle engine, through a partnership of Moto Morini S. P. A. (BO), Dellâ€™Orto S. P. A. (MI), Istituto Motori - CNR (NA), and DIME - UniversitÃ  di Napoli Federico II. After a synthetic description of the main variable valve actuation methods currently employed (timing, duration and lift variation, cyclic cylinder deactivation), the paper presents the results of our mechanical variable valve actuation system, consisting of three main elements: cam, main rocker arm with fixed fulcrum and secondary rocker arm with mobile fulcrum. It enables valve lift variation through a simple translation of the intermediate element (system 1). The study has been conducted implementing a numerical procedure specifically designed to determine cam profile and the kinematic and dynamic characteristics of the whole system, starting from the following <b>input</b> data: rocker <b>arm</b> geometry, relative positions and inertial data of elements, spring stiffness and preloading, camshaft speed and valve lift law. The model has been validated against the conventional timing system using kinematic simulations. Results of the numerical procedure verify the validity of the variable valve actuation system, capable of a valve lift variation from 30 % to 100 % of the maximum lift, with a limited acceleration (lower than maximum values). Based on the numerical results, we are developing a new mechanical variable valve actuation system. The new system consists of the same three elements used previously, but they are connected in a different way (system 2). The newer system enables more general lift profile distributions with a similar geometric complexity. A maximum closing limited to 30 % does not enable cyclic deactivation of some cylinders (strategy feasible on multicylinder engines) or exclusion of one or more valves (strategy feasible on multivalve engines). The activity was extended to research for a new solution (always a mechanical system), capable to allow inlet valves complete closing and timing and duration variation (system 3). This paper reports results reachable with the simplest system 1. This new system gives better perspectives of use for a new two-wheel vehicle engine...|$|R
