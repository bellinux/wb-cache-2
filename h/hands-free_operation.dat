40|$|The vast {{majority}} of driving simulators currently in existence do not include motion systems. When motion systems are present, they are often too small to reasonably represent the forces experienced in an actual car. Nevertheless, simulators {{with little or no}} motion are routinely used to characterize driver behavior and safety. The underlying assumption is that measures of driving performance such as lane violations or heading errors are valid indicators of relative driving performance {{even in the absence of}} motion cues. Ford's Research & Advanced Engineering group operates a driving simulator called VIRTTEX (VIRtual Test Track Experiment) that has enough motion capability to realize lateral scale factors between 0. 50 and 0. 70 during non-emergency driving. This simulator has been used to compare both driving and vehicle performance measures during simulated driving at various levels of the lateral scale factor. Results from two experiments are presented. In the first experiment an event detection protocol was used to measure the level of distraction induced by various in-vehicle tasks such as hand-held or <b>hands-free</b> cellular phone <b>operation.</b> Forty-eight adult drivers participated in the study with the VIRTTEX motion system set to a lateral scale factor of 0. 6.

40|$|This article {{describes}} the design, implementation and evaluation of the software network and application services that support the InfoPad terminal. We believe that future users will demand network connectivity in their mobile computer systems. They will want access to documents, weather reports, traffic information, stock prices, bank accounts, maps, and other documents that reside on the Internet or on their own local area networks (LAN). There are currently several alternatives that provide this connectivity to the mobile user. A cellular telephone modem could provide mobile data communication, but the low bandwidth and quality of cellular links severely limits the types of multimedia {{information that can be}} delivered. For example, NTSC quality video requires approximately 1. 5 Mbits/sec, which is about two orders of magnitude higher than cellular modem data rates. Through the use of a pico-cell networking architecture and wideband spread spectrum radios, the InfoPad system aims to provide up to 2 Mbits/sec of bandwidth to each of 50 users in {{an area the size of}} a typical classroom. Portable applications often demand <b>hands-free</b> or single-hand <b>operation,</b> which does not fit well with the traditional keyboard and mouse user interface. As a result, many recent portable devices have developed pen-based interfaces (some with handwriting recognition) as a replacement. The primary weakness of these implementations is the low accuracy of the handwriting recognition algorithms that are supported by the portable units. This accuracy can be improved by moving the computation required by recognition into the backbone network, thereby allowing more compute-intensive algorithms to be employed. The InfoPad design also uses speech recognition, video and audio to enhance usability. Sin [...] ...|$|R
40|$|Background The {{diagnosis}} of sepsis is challenging because the infection {{can be caused}} by more than 50 species of pathogens that might exist in the bloodstream in very low concentrations, e. g., less than 1 colony-forming unit/ml. As a result, among the current sepsis diagnostic methods there is an unsatisfactory trade-off between the assay time and the specificity of the derived diagnostic information. Although the present qPCR-based test is more specific than biomarker detection and faster than culturing, its 6 ~ 10 hr turnaround remains suboptimal relative to the 7. 6 %/hr rapid deterioration of the survival rate, and the 3 hr hands-on time is labor-intensive. To address these issues, this work aims to utilize the advances in microfluidic technologies to expedite and automate the ``nucleic acid purification - qPCR sequence detection'' workflow. Methods and Results This task is evaluated to be best approached by combining immiscible phase filtration (IPF) and digital microfluidic droplet actuation (DM) on a fluidic device. In IPF, as nucleic acid-bound magnetic beads are transported from an aqueous phase to an immiscible phase, the carryover of aqueous contaminants is minimized by the high interfacial tension. Thus, unlike a conventional bead-based assay, the necessary degree of purification can be attained in a few wash steps. After IPF reduces the sample volume from a milliliter-sized lysate to a microliter-sized eluent, DM can be used to automatically prepare the PCR mixture. This begins with compartmenting the eluent in accordance with the desired number of multiplex qPCR reactions, and then transporting droplets of the PCR reagents to mix with the eluent droplets. Under the outlined approach, the IPF - DM integration should lead to a notably reduced turnaround and a <b>hands-free</b> ``lysate-to-answer'' <b>operation.</b> As the first step towards such a diagnostic device, the primary objective of this thesis is to verify the feasibility of the IPF - DM integration. This is achieved in four phases. First, the suitable assays, fluidic device, and auxiliary systems are developed. Second, the extent of purification obtained per IPF wash, and hence the number of washes needed for uninhibited qPCR, are estimated via off-chip UV absorbance measurement and on-chip qPCR. Third, the performance of on-chip qPCR, particularly the copy number - threshold cycle correlation, is characterized. Lastly, the above developments accumulate to an experiment that includes the following on-chip steps: DNA purification by IPF, PCR mixture preparation via DM, and target quantification using qPCR - thereby demonstrating the core procedures in the proposed approach. Conclusions It is proposed to expedite and automate qPCR-based multiplex sparse pathogen detection by combining IPF and DM on a fluidic device. As a start, this work demonstrated the feasibility of the IPF - DM integration. However, a more thermally robust device structure will be needed for later quantitative investigations, e. g., improving the bead - buffer mixing. Importantly, evidences indicate that future iterations of the IPF - DM fluidic device could reduce the sample-to-answer time by 75 % to 1. 5 hr and decrease the hands-on time by 90 % to approximately 20 min.

Most countries allow the sale of walkie-talkies for, at least, business, marine communications, and some limited personal uses such as CB radio, {{as well as for}} amateur radio designs.
