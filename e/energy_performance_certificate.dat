50|$|A reduced data {{version of}} SAP, RDSAP, {{is used for}} {{existing}} dwellings. SAP or RDSAP was used to produce the energy report and <b>Energy</b> <b>Performance</b> <b>Certificate</b> in Home Information Packs (HIPs).

50|$|CBRE has {{produced}} an <b>energy</b> <b>performance</b> <b>certificate</b> (EPC) for 99 Bishopsgate which {{has resulted in}} a 'C' rating for the building. The factors that influenced the rating are the impact of specifying energy efficient plant and equipment during refits and the standard of building-related information made available for the purposes of EPC calculation. Considering the age of the building, a 'C' rating is considered impressive.|$|E
50|$|Under the Energy Performance of Building Directive (EPBD) Europe {{has made}} a {{mandatory}} energy certification since 4 January 2009. A mandatory certificate called the Building Energy Rating system (BER) and a certification <b>Energy</b> <b>Performance</b> <b>Certificate</b> is needed by all buildings that measure more than 1000 Sq mts in all the European nations. According to the UK Green Building Council, existing buildings account for 17% of the UK's total carbon emissions.|$|E
50|$|The {{activities}} of the Institute {{in the field of}} registering <b>energy</b> <b>performance</b> <b>certificates</b> and inspection reports for air-conditioning systems, as well as carrying out electronic random checks are mainly governed by the revised Energy Saving Ordinance (Energieeinsparverordnung, EnEV 2013).|$|R
50|$|The Code {{was officially}} {{launched}} in December 2006, and was introduced as a voluntary standard in England in 2007. It complemented {{the system of}} <b>Energy</b> <b>Performance</b> <b>Certificates</b> for new homes introduced in 2008 under the European <b>Energy</b> <b>Performance</b> of Buildings Directive, and built on recent changes to Building Regulations in England and Wales.|$|R
50|$|In Denmark, {{the energy}} rating scheme are in {{existence}} since 1981. Denmark {{is the first}} country in Europe(EU) to begin issuing <b>Energy</b> <b>Performance</b> <b>certificates</b> (EPCs). The EPCs are mandatory in all types of buildings in Denmark. The rating system in Denmark includes three parts.|$|R

50|$|The {{calculation}} of the energy ratings on the <b>Energy</b> <b>Performance</b> <b>Certificate</b> (EPC) {{are based on the}} RDSAPv3 procedure, which is a simplified version of the SAP2005. SAP is short for Standard Assessment Procedure and RDSAP for Reduced Data SAP; both are derived from the UK Building Research Establishment's Domestic Energy Model (BREDEM), which was originally developed in the 1980s and also underlies the NHER Rating. EPCs have to be produced by domestic energy assessors who are registered under an approved certification scheme.|$|E
50|$|An <b>Energy</b> <b>Performance</b> <b>Certificate</b> (EPC) in the UK {{needs to}} be {{completed}} by a government qualified Domestic Energy Assessor (DEA). DEAs offer advice on how to improve the energy performance of the dwelling which might save money. However, in practice, such documents only give general advice of little value to potential purchasers. They frequently exhibit errors since the survey is superficial and non-intrusive. They neglect older and listed buildings where planning consent is needed for structural changes to the property, such as installing double glazed windows for example.|$|E

In {{the same}} year, Connells Group acquired a major shareholding in Vibrant Energy Matters, {{a provider of}} <b>Energy</b> <b>Performance</b> <b>Certificates,</b> formed a strategic relationship with online property services company Zoopla, and established Redstone Wills.|$|R
