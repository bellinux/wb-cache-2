The streetcars were financed by John Mason, a wealthy banker, and built by an Irish-American contractor, John Stephenson. The Fifth Avenue Coach Company introduced electric buses to Fifth Avenue in New York in 1898.|$|R

50|$|The bet was won. Despite many people's doubts, it {{had been}} shown that, {{provided}} that the gradient was sufficiently gentle, {{it was possible to}} successfully haul heavy carriages along a <b>smooth</b> <b>iron</b> road using the adhesive weight alone of a suitably heavy and powerful steam locomotive. Trevithick's was probably the first to do so; however some of the short cast iron plates of the tramroad broke under the locomotive as they were intended only to support the lighter axle load of horse-drawn wagons and so the tramroad returned to horse power after the initial test run.|$|R
5000|$|A further {{reason for}} {{suspension}} was {{to improve the}} frictional contact between the wheels and rail. This relied upon maintaining a good contact, thus requiring good suspension of the wheels over the uneven track. The ability of an 'adhesion-hauled' locomotive to draw a train was much questioned at this time, as {{it was thought that}} the friction between a <b>smooth</b> <b>iron</b> wheel and the rail would be inadequate. Some designers, such as Blenkinsop with his Salamanca thought that a system of geared teeth would be necessary. Stephenson believed that, provided a good contact could be maintained between wheel and rail, frictional adhesion alone would be adequate.|$|R

40|$|A {{comparative}} analysis of thin film lubrication of hexadecane between different iron and its oxide surfaces {{has been carried}} out using classical molecular dynamic simulation. An ab initio force-field, COMPASS, was applied for n-hexadecane using explicit atom model. An effective potential derived from density functional theory calculation was utilized for the interfacial interaction between hexadecane and the tribo-surfaces. A quantitative surface parameterization was introduced to investigate the influence of surface properties on the structure, rheological properties, and tribological performance of the lubricant. The results show that although the wall-fluid attraction of hexadecane on pure iron surfaces is significantly stronger than its oxides, there is a considerable reduction of shear stress of confined n-hexadecane film between Fe(100) and Fe(110) surfaces compared with FeO(110), FeO(111), Fe 2 O 3 (001), and Fe 2 O 3 (012). It was found that, in thin film lubrication of hexadecane between <b>smooth</b> <b>iron</b> and iron oxide surfaces, the surface corrugation plays a role more important than the wall-fluid adhesion strength...|$|R

The resultant films {{were characterized by}} X-ray diffraction (XRD) and scanning electron microscopy (SEM). It was shown that adherent and <b>smooth</b> <b>iron</b> coatings with uniform microstructure can be obtained using alkaline Fe (II) baths containing pyrophosphate and tartrate ions as complexing agents. The average grain size can be substantially decreased by glycine additions in the pyrophosphate bath. The faradaic efficiency in these electrolytes may achieve up to 40 - 50 %. The tartrate-containing baths are characterized with a higher throwing power and an increased buffer capacity {{with respect to the}} pyrophosphate-based electrolytes. The resultant Fe coatings are single-phase, whilst substantial broadening of the XRD peaks indicates nano-scale grain size. The alkaline baths based on EDTA complexes of iron (III) give black dull iron deposits and are characterized by rather low cathodic current efficiencies, especially at low current densities...|$|R

60|$|There are {{two ways}} of frying {{employed}} by the French cook. One is, to immerse the article to be cooked in boiling fat, {{with an emphasis on}} the present participle,--and the philosophical principle is, so immediately to crisp every pore at the first moment or two of immersion as effectually to seal the interior against the intrusion of greasy particles; it can then remain as long as may be necessary thoroughly to cook it, without imbibing any more of the boiling fluid than if it were enclosed in an eggshell. The other method is, to rub a perfectly <b>smooth</b> <b>iron</b> surface with just enough of some oily substance to prevent the meat from adhering, and cook it with a quick heat, as cakes are baked on a griddle. In both these cases there must be the most rapid application of heat that can be made without burning, and by the adroitness shown in working out this problem the skill of the cook is tested.

This palace is an enormous round cage, as high as a house, and nearly a hundred feet in diameter, with a range of stone buildings all around it on the back side. These buildings have little rooms in them, where the monkeys live in the winter, and where they always sleep at night. They go out into the cage to play. The cage is formed of slender iron posts and railing, so that the people standing outside can see the monkeys at their sports and gambols. They play with each other in every possible way, and frolic just as if they were in their native woods. They climb up the <b>smooth</b> <b>iron</b> posts, pursuing one another; and then, leaping across through the air, they catch upon a rope, from which they swing themselves across to the branch of a tree. Some of these branches have bells attached to them; and the monkey, when he gets upon such a one, will spring it up and down till he sets the bell to ringing, and then, assisted by the return of the branch, he bounds away through the air to some rope, or pole, or railing that he sees within his reach. The agility which these animals display in these feats is truly astonishing.|$|R
40|$|Abstract—The {{emergence}} of smart grid (SG) brings about many {{fundamental changes in}} electric power systems. In this paper, we study the problem of <b>smooth</b> <b>electric</b> power scheduling in power distribution networks. We introduce an electricity supply/demand model {{that takes into account}} the time-varying demands and their deadlines. We formulate a constrained nonlinear programming problem and incorporate the theory of majorization to develop algorithms that can compute smoothness optimal schedules for the deferrable load dominant system. An effective heuristic algorithm is also presented by extending the majorization-based algorithm for the general scenario with both priority loads and deferrable loads. After obtaining the smooth power schedule, a distributed user benefit maximization load control scheme is used to allocate the scheduled power to individual users, while maximizing their levels of satisfaction. The analysis and simulation results demon-strate the efficacy of the proposed algorithms on <b>smooth</b> <b>electric</b> power scheduling, peak power minimization, and reducing power generation cost.

40|$|A {{classical}} {{molecular dynamics}} (MD) simulation {{has been used}} to investigate the adsorption and tribological performance of hydrocarbon lubricant between different iron and iron oxide surfaces. A realistic all-atom model of alkane was employed using the COMPASS force field (FF) while the relaxed surfaces and an effective force field for interactions between surface and lubricant were obtained from ab-initio calculations. A comparative analysis of adsorption of six n-alkanes (CnH 2 n+ 2, n = 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 16) on Fe(110), FeO(110), and Fe 2 O 3 (0001) and thin film lubrication of hexadecane between Fe(100), Fe(110), Fe(111), FeO(100), FeO(110), FeO(111), Fe 2 O 3 (001), and Fe 2 O 3 (012) surfaces has been carried out. A quantitative surface parameterization was introduced to investigate the influence of surface properties such as crystalline structure, surface corrugation, and crystal plane on the structure, rheological properties, and tribological performance of the n-alkanes. The effects of working conditions such as loading pressure, shear rate, and temperature are also considered. The results show that alkane molecules orient randomly on Fe(110) and Fe 2 O 3 (0001) surfaces but they preferentially orient in (010) direction on FeO(110) at low temperature. Additionally, alkanes adsorb physically on iron oxides, in the following decreasing order Fe(110) 3 ̆e FeO(110) 3 ̆e Fe 2 O 3 (0001). The adsorption energies per saturated carbon site decrease with an increase of molecular chain length and this propensity is similar for different surfaces. In contrast, the saturated carbon density is insensitive to the surface potentials and shows an increasing trend for short alkane chains but it remains steady for longer chains. Although the wallfluid attraction of hexadecane on pure iron surfaces is significantly stronger than its oxides, there is a considerable reduction of shear stress of confined n-hexadecane film between Fe(100), and Fe(110) surfaces compared with FeO(110), FeO(111), Fe 2 O 3 (001), and Fe 2 O 3 (012). It was found that, in thin film lubrication of hexadecane between <b>smooth</b> <b>iron</b> and iron oxide surfaces, the atomic roughness plays a role more important than the wall-fluid adhesion strength...|$|R

50|$|The Wedung is a {{short and}} broad machete (Bendho). Its blade has a {{straight}} back and an S-shape edge. It may be made of <b>smooth</b> <b>iron,</b> but pamor forge work also occurs. The back is sometimes sharpened along 1/3 of its length from the point. The blade's base is straight and stands at an angle of 90 degrees to the back. This base usually has decoration shaped as filed-out indentations or small teeth (greneng). A round 'eye' or hole (kembang kacang) is sometimes found. Furthermore, the base may be decorated with inlay work and representations of mythical dragon (naga), leaf and floral motifs. The tang (peksi) {{is made out of}} the blade's thick back rim. Between the spike and the blade, a pentagonal segment (metok or integral bolster) is forged. The short hilt, which is pentagonal on Java, forms as it were, an extension of the metok. The hilt is usually made of wood, but other materials such as animal tooth are also found. Its smooth upper part is flattened. The Wedung on Bali has narrower shape and is usually more lavishly decorated. On the rear near the base a lengthy decoration is sometimes added. The hilt and the metok of the Balinese Wedung are instead of pentagonal, usually round in cross-section. It is sometimes chiselled. The wooden scabbard usually follows the blade's shape, but may have a rectangular lower part. Its mouth has a broadened rim all around. At the rear side the scabbard has a large horn hook shaped (sangkletan) resembling a shoe-horn, with which the Wedung can be hitched onto the belt. This hook is attached to the scabbard by means of strips of horn, rattan or metal. On expensive examples the scabbard sometimes has one or two round or comma-shaped golden or silver mounts.|$|R
