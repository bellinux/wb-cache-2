500|$|In {{a review}} from Zap2it, Rick Porter gave the pilot praise for {{bringing}} together the central theme, saying [...] "No other new show this fall {{is attempting to}} tell a bigger story, and we're hoping the rough patches smooth out and it fulfills the potential that's there in its very strong cast and premise." [...] It also cited Jennifer Morrison and Jared Gilmore's performances when they appear in scenes together: [...] "As such it falls to Morrison to move the story along in this world, and fortunately for the audience she's able to pull it off. She gives a confident, grounded performance that helps keep the show from feeling too fantastical, and her rapport with Gilmore is a big plus too." [...] He also notes the writers and producers <b>have</b> <b>put</b> <b>together</b> a great premise and expects they'll have more as the series progresses: [...] "Given the cast and the people involved behind the scenes... we're more optimistic than not that Once Upon a Time will find its way.

[...] Moreover, he derided the [...] "piles and piles and miles and miles of clips from films present and past" [...] writing that it [...] "squandered the visual luster" [...] of the ceremony. Associated Press television critic Frazier Moore remarked, [...] "Stewart, usually a very funny guy, displayed a lack of beginner's luck as first-time host...His usually impeccable blend of puckishness and self-effacement fell flat in the service of Oscar." [...] He also criticized the decision to play music over the winner's acceptance speeches calling it [...] "distracting and obnoxious." ...|$|E
