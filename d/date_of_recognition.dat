40|$|A. Isenberg 3 Objective. LN is {{a common}} and {{potentially}} severe complication of SLE. Our aim was to characterize a LN cohort followed at a single centre for 30 years and assess its evolution over time. Methods. Between 1975 and 2005, 156 LN patients were followed up at University College Hospital London. We divided them into three groups depending on the <b>date</b> <b>of</b> <b>recognition</b> of renal involvement (197585, 198695 and 19962005) and compared {{them in terms of}} clinical, demographic and serological characteristics and disease outcome. Results. Clinical characteristics were comparable between groups; however, the proportion of Afro-caribbean (AC) patients and the prevalence of anti-ENA antibodies rose significantly over time. The 5 -year mortality rate decreased by 60 % {{between the first and second}} decades, remaining stable over the third decade. The 5 -year end-stage renal disease (ESRD) rate remained constant. An increasing number of renal transplants (RTx) was performed with encouraging results. AC origin was associated with a poorer overall prognosis. Conclusion. LN, a common complication of SLE, is associated with increased mortality and morbidity, particularly among AC patients. Despite encouraging results for RTx, once ESRD is established the prog-nosis is relatively poor and no improvement in preventing its development was achieved. Moreover, al-though a significant decrease in mortality was observed, it has remained stable for 10 years. These results suggest that we have maximized the benefits of conventional therapies and if further improvement is to be achieved, novel drug regimens must be developed...|$|E

40|$|Scientists in the Office of Life and Microgravity Sciences and Applications {{within the}} Microgravity Research Division oversee studies in {{important}} physical, chemical, and biological processes in microgravity environment. Research is conducted in microgravity environment {{because of the}} beneficial results that come about for experiments. When research is done in normal gravity, scientists are limited to results that {{are affected by the}} gravity of Earth. Microgravity provides an environment where solid, liquid, and gas can be observed in a natural state of free fall and where many different variables are eliminated. One challenge that NASA faces is that space flight opportunities need to be used effectively and efficiently {{in order to ensure that}} some of the most scientifically promising research is conducted. Different vibratory sources are continually active aboard the International Space Station (ISS). Some of the vibratory sources include crew exercise, experiment setup, machinery startup (life support fans, pumps, freezer/compressor, centrifuge), thruster firings, and some unknown events. The Space Acceleration Measurement System (SAMs), which acts as the hardware and carefully positioned aboard the ISS, along with the Microgravity Environment Monitoring System MEMS), which acts as the software and is located here at NASA Glenn, are used to detect these vibratory sources aboard the ISS and recognize them as disturbances. The various vibratory disturbances can sometimes be harmful to the scientists different research projects. Some vibratory disturbances are recognized by the MEMS's database and some are not. Mainly, the unknown events that occur aboard the International Space Station are the ones of major concern. To better aid in the research experiments, the unknown events are identified and verified as unknown events. Features, such as frequency, acceleration level, time and <b>date</b> <b>of</b> <b>recognition</b> of the new patterns are stored in an Excel database. My task is to carefully synthesize frequency and acceleration patterns of unknown events within the Excel database into a new file to determine whether or not certain information that is received i s considered a real vibratory source. Once considered as a vibratory source, further analysis is carried out. The resulting information is used to retrain the MEMS to recognize them as known patterns. These different vibratory disturbances are being constantly monitored to observe if, in any way, the disturbances have an effect on the microgravity environment that research experiments are exposed to. If the disturbance has little or no effect on the experiments, then research is continued. However, if the disturbance is harmful to the experiment, scientists act accordingly by either minimizing the source or terminating the research and neither NASA's time nor money is wasted...|$|E

40|$|For the {{majority}} of single transmembrane-spanning cell surface receptors, signal transmission across the lipid bilayer barrier involves several discrete components <b>of</b> molecular <b>recognition.</b> The interaction between ligand and the extracellular segment of its cognate receptor (ectodomain) initiates either homomeric or heteromeric association of receptor subunits. Specific recognition among these subunits may then occur between ectodomain regions, within the membrane by interhelical contact or inside the cell between cytoplasmic domains. Any {{or all of these}} interactions may contribute to the stability of the signaling complex. It is the characteristics of ligand binding by the ectodomains of these receptors that controls the heteromeric or homomeric nature and the stoichiometry of the complex. Cytokines and their receptors belong to a growing family of macromolecular systems that exhibit these functional features and share many structural similarities as well. Interleukin- 2 is a multifunctional cytokine that represents, perhaps, the most complex example to <b>date</b> <b>of</b> ligand <b>recognition</b> among the hematopoietin receptor family. It is the cooperative binding of IL- 2 by all three proteins on the surface of activated T-lymphocytes, however, that ultimately results in crosslinking of the {beta}- and {gamma}-subunits and signaling via association of their cytoplasmic domains. Although the high-affinity IL- 2 R functions as a heterotrimer, heterodimers of the receptor subunits are also physiologically important. The {alpha}/{beta} heterodimer or {open_quotes}pseudo-high affinity{close_quotes} receptor captures IL- 2 as a preformed cell surface complex while the {beta}/{gamma} intermediate affinity site exists, {{in the absence of the}} {alpha} subunit, on {{the majority}} of natural killer cells.

In the murine coronavirus a selective interaction between the viral transmembrane envelope protein M and the viral ribonucleoprotein complex, composed of N protein and viral RNA containing a short cis-acting RNA element, the packaging signal, determines the selective RNA packaging into virus particles. In this report we show that expressed coronavirus envelope protein M specifically interacted with coexpressed noncoronavirus RNA transcripts containing the short viral packaging signal in the absence of coronavirus N protein. Furthermore, this M protein-packaging signal interaction led to specific packaging of the packaging signal-containing RNA transcripts into coronavirus-like particles in the absence of N protein. These findings not only highlight a novel RNA packaging mechanism for an enveloped virus, where the specific RNA packaging can occur without the core or N protein, but also point to a new, biologically important general model of precise and selective interaction between transmembrane proteins and specific RNA elements...|$|R
