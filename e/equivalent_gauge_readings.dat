In order to characterize the vacuum in these guns, an extractor gauge and a residual gas analyzer have been incorporated into each gun. The purpose of this tech note is to document the gun vacuum measurements performed in the CEBAF polarized electron guns during tests made in February 2003, and to compare this with the previous vacuum measurements made in the electron guns throughout their evolution. The results of these measurements, suggesting that the raw extractor <b>gauge</b> <b>readings</b> are 7 x 10 - 12 and 4 x 10 - 12 for guns 2 and 3 respectively, {{are at least as}} good as any previous measurement of the vacuum in these systems...|$|R

Different adjustment procedures are applied to raw radar estimates using <b>gauge</b> <b>readings</b> from a network of 12 raingauges. The stream flow is simulated for the 48. 17 km 2 Molenbeek/Parkbeek catchment located in the Flemish region of Belgium based on a lumped conceptual model. Results showed that raw radar estimates can be greatly improved using adjustment procedures. The gauge-radar residuals however, remain large even after adjustments. The adjusted X-band radar estimates are observed to be better estimates than corresponding C-band estimates. Their application for stream flow simulation showed that raingauges and radars can simulate spatially more uniform winter storms with almost same accuracy where as differences are more evident on localized summer events. status: publishe...|$|R
