50|$|The 4-oxazolone motif, {{which is}} also {{formally}} a lactam, is present {{in a number of}} drugs (<b>fenozolone,</b> thozalinone, cyclazodone, reclazepam etc.).|$|E
50|$|<b>Fenozolone</b> (Ordinator) was {{developed}} by Laboratoires Dausse in the 1960s and is a psychoactive drug and stimulant related to pemoline and 4-methylaminorex which acts as a norepinephrine-dopamine releasing agent (NDRA).|$|E
40|$|Summary: Detection of the psychostimulants {{pemoline}} (Tradon®), <b>fenozolone</b> (Ordinator) and thozalinone (Stimsen®) {{in biological}} samples (urine) presents certain experimental difficulties. These substances were therefore converted by acid hydrolysis to their common hydrolysis product 5 -phenyl- 2, 4 -oxazolidinedione, {{which can be}} detected with high sensitivity and selectivity by thin layer chromatography. After silylation with N-methyl-N-trimethylsilyltrifluoroacetamide/triinethylchlorosilane quantitative results {{can be obtained from}} the same extract by the proposed GC/MS-method. After a single dose of 30 mg pemoline, levels ranging from one to four mg/ 1 urine were observed...|$|E
