Complete {{stress and}} {{electric}} fields near {{the tip of}} a conducting crack between two dissimilar anisotropic piezoelectric media, are obtained in terms of two generalized bimaterial matrices proposed in this paper.

Exact solutions of the stress and electric fields for basic interface crack problems are obtained. An alternate form of the J integral is derived, and the mutual integral associated with the J integral is proposed. Closed form solutions of the stress and electric field intensity factors due to electromechanical loading and the singularities for a semi-infinite crack as well as for a finite crack at the interface between two dissimilar piezoelectric media, are also obtained by using the mutual <b>integral.</b> <b>Key</b> words: Analytic functions, conservation integrals, electromechanical fracture. 1...|$|R

40|$|The dynamic {{constraints}} {{technique has}} been proposed for building geometrical models composed of rigid bodies, which are made to act naturally, according to Newtonian laws, by specifying constraints on their states. In computer animation, the dynamic constraints technique alleviates the work-load of animators who formerly had to plan animated sequences in detail by intuition alone. Nevertheless, for some real-world applications, it is desirable to have a mechanism that makes physically-based elements move according to a given scenario by providing some control states. The control states can be represented by transient constraints {{that are to be}} met and then released immediately. In this paper, a technique called the sequential-goal constraints technique is proposed to provide such a mechanism. With the sequential-goal constraints technique, it is easy to specify transient constraints according to a given scenario and derive proper forces and torques to drive an element to meet each transient constraint exactly at a specified time so that the whole motion of the element is continuous and <b>integral.</b> <b>KEY</b> WORDS Animation Dynamic constraints Inverse dynamics Physically-based model...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. One of {{the basics}} of {{calculus}} is the following proposition: If F and G are antiderivatives of two real functions f and g resp., then an antiderivative of λf + g is λF +G. It may be surprising that such systematic an integration formula exists for the inverse of a function f, a fact {{that seems to have}} been discovered for the first time by Laisant in 1905 ([2]), and seems to be still unsufficiently known. More precisely, if f is an invertible real function, and if F is an antiderivative of f, then the antiderivative of f− 1 is xf− 1 (x) − F ◦ f− 1 (x) + C. Laisant, and other authors after him (e. g. [3, 4]), assumes that f− 1 is differentiable, in which case the proof of this formula is immediate. Recently, it has been shown by Key that this additional assumption is unnecessary ([1]). In this paper, we give two different proofs of this result.

Furthermore, non-universal properties are recovered from the study of a series of functions which are generalizations of the so-called energy <b>integral.</b> <b>Key</b> words: Fractals, stochastic processes A number of the {{properties of}} fractals are associated with their Hausdorff, box-counting, or fractal dimensions. But further information of a universal character is also encoded in secondary (singular) dimensions, some of which may be complex. For example, a recurrent theme in the study of fractals is that of asymptotic or logarithmic periodicity [1, 2]. Most fractal objects and mathematical constructions thereof are not exactly scale invariant. Rather, they obey simple recurrence relations that relate an infinite but discrete set of scales. Recent physical examples include the appearance of complex exponents in diffusion-limited aggregation [3], crack propagation in two dimensions [4], and Boolean delay equations in the modelling of climate dynamics [5].
