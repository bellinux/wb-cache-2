5|$|Johnson and the 2008 Detroit Lions {{finished}} {{the first ever}} 016 season in NFL history after a 3121 loss to the Green Bay Packers in week17. Despite the Lions' failures {{and the fact that}} five different quarterbacks played during the year, Johnson finished as one of the strongest wide receivers statistically for the 2008 season, finishing fifth <b>in</b> <b>receiving</b> yards (1,331) and 7th <b>in</b> <b>receiving</b> yards per game (83.2), and leading the league <b>in</b> <b>receiving</b> touchdowns (12), {{despite the fact that the}} entire Lions team only passed for 18 touchdowns. However, Johnson missed the Pro Bowl, with most experts attributing the snub to the Lions' dismal winless season (he was named an alternate instead).|$|E

5|$|Jonas Mouton was the Big Ten's {{statistical}} {{champion in}} tackles, while Jordan Kovacs finished second. In conference games alone, Roy Roundtree led the conference <b>in</b> <b>receiving</b> yards per game, {{in part on}} the strength of a school single-game record 246-yard outing against Illinois. Reserve quarterback Tate Forcier also set a school single-game completion percentage record with a 12-for-12 performance against Bowling Green. The defense also set several records, including most points allowed and yards allowed.|$|E
5|$|Michigan quarterback Chad Henne {{completed}} 19 of 37 {{passes for}} 233yards, {{with an average}} of 6.3yards per throw; he threw one touchdown and one interception.

5|$|The Browns won the AAFC {{championship}} {{again in}} 1947. Lavelli {{finished second in}} the league <b>in</b> <b>receiving</b> behind his teammate Speedie. Both Lavelli and Speedie were named to all-AAFC teams, as they had been in 1946. Lavelli broke his leg in a preseason game in 1948 and sat out seven weeks. He came back later in the year and helped Cleveland finish a perfect season, catching a touchdown pass in a 31–21 win over the AAFC's Brooklyn Dodgers in the championship game. In a game against the Los Angeles Dons the following year, Lavelli caught four touchdowns and had 209 receiving yards, an AAFC record. In 1949 Cleveland won the AAFC championship for the fourth year in a row. The AAFC dissolved before the 1950 season and three of its teams, including the Browns, were absorbed by the more established National Football League (NFL). Lavelli was the AAFC's all-time leader in yards per catch and second <b>in</b> <b>receiving</b> yards behind Speedie.|$|E

5|$|After the Eagles signed Antonio Freeman to {{a one-year}} {{contract}} in August 2002, Mitchell was demoted to the fourth wide receiver behind Pinkston, Thrash, and Freeman. Mitchell mainly contributed on special teams for the Eagles throughout the 2002 season. In the first fifteen weeks of the season, Mitchell caught {{a total of six}} passes for 53yards as a backup. Against the Cowboys in week sixteen, Pinkston left the game due to turf toe, and Mitchell caught two passes for 17yards in his place.

5|$|Against the Pittsburgh Pirates on July 28, Fernández {{recorded}} 13 strikeouts, {{earning the}} 3–2 victory. With Fernández's 14-strikeout performance against the Cleveland Indians on August 3, 2013, he became just the sixth pitcher since 2000 {{to strike out}} 13 or more batters in consecutive games. He established the Marlins' rookie record for most strikeouts in one game. For his performance in July 2013, Fernández was named the Rookie of the Month for the National League, leading all qualified rookie pitchers in ERA. He followed up his July by compiling a 1.15 ERA with 49 strikeouts in 39 innings pitched in August, which resulted him <b>in</b> <b>receiving</b> a second consecutive Rookie of the Month Award.|$|E
5|$|Also injured was Virginia Tech wide {{receiver}} Ricky Scales. Scales didn't play for 10 weeks {{during the regular}} season because of surgery to an injured tendon. Despite playing in only four games during the season, he finished the regular season as the Hokies' No. 5 receiver, catching 13 passes for 298 yards. Scales' injury caused the Hokies to be ranked among the worst in the Big East <b>in</b> <b>receiving</b> yardage, averaging less than 180 yards per game through the air. As the game moved closer, however, Scales recovered from his injury and appeared near full strength.|$|E
