500|$|Minaj's [...] "Monster" [...] verse {{was listed}} by Complex {{as the best}} rap verse of the 2010s. West claimed {{at one point he}} {{considered}} deleting her verse from the track, because he was worried it would outshine his own work:It was like that moment when I thought about taking Nicki's verse off of [...] "Monster" [...] because I knew people would say that was the best verse on the best Hip Hop album of all time or arguably top ten albums of all time. And I would do all that work, eight months of work on [...] "Dark Fantasy" [...] and people to this day would say to me 'My favorite thing was Nicki Minaj's verse.' So if <b>I</b> <b>let</b> <b>my</b> ego get the best of me instead of letting that girl get the shot to get that platform to be all she could be, I would take it off or marginalize her, try to stop her from having that shining momentâ€¦ ...|$|E
60|$|Now <b>I</b> <b>let</b> <b>my</b> hands {{fall and}} stared at him, for well I knew what was coming.|$|E
60|$|I {{turned to}} her. I set my hand lightly upon her arm; <b>I</b> <b>let</b> <b>my</b> gaze {{encounter}} the upward glance of her eyes--blue as forget-me-nots.|$|E
60|$|Capt. H. (Slowly). <b>I</b> wouldn't <b>let</b> <b>my</b> {{own flesh}} and blood go to sea. Not I.|$|R
5000|$|<b>I</b> had <b>let</b> <b>my</b> flat in town, {{and taken}} {{inexpensive}} quarters at Thames Ditton, on the plea of a disinterested {{passion for the}} river.|$|R
6000|$|... 'Dear me; how stupid! <b>I</b> have <b>let</b> <b>my</b> {{handkerchief}} blow away,' said she. 'Will {{you climb}} {{up and get}} it for me?' But Jose answered: ...|$|R
60|$|Without {{more words}} {{she let me}} cover her; which as I was doing in the darkness, <b>I</b> <b>let</b> <b>my</b> hand rest a moment on her shoulder, almost like an embrace.|$|E
60|$|Drawn by some {{magnetic}} force which I could not resist, <b>I</b> <b>let</b> <b>my</b> eyes rest upon her shining orbs, {{and felt a}} current pass from them to me that bewildered and half-blinded me.|$|E
60|$|As my jailer {{appeared}} at the top, <b>I</b> <b>let</b> <b>my</b> body through the opening. It was a tight squeeze, especially when accomplished in a hurry. I landed in a heap {{on a pile of}} shavings.|$|E
6000|$|... "I wouldn't; Aunt Jo says feather-beds aren't healthy. <b>I</b> never <b>let</b> <b>my</b> {{children}} {{sleep on}} any thing but a mattress," [...] returned Mrs. Shakespeare Smith, decidedly.|$|R
6000|$|... "Very well, Jane," [...] he said. [...] "I am disappointed, but <b>I</b> shall <b>let</b> <b>my</b> trip to England wait a month; {{then we can}} go back together." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "That {{supercargo}} has {{it in for}} me," [...] replied Phil. [...] "I wish <b>I</b> could <b>let</b> <b>my</b> father {{know just}} how he is acting. He'd soon lose his situation." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Sure I did.... Good Lord! Dorn, don't imagine I ever {{questioned}} your nerve.... It's only you're not needed--or rather, you're {{needed more}} at home.... <b>I</b> <b>let</b> <b>my</b> son Jim go to war. That's {{enough for one}} family!" ...|$|E
6000|$|Hardly awakened {{yet from}} the {{absorbing}} {{memories of the}} past to the sweet realities of the present, <b>I</b> <b>let</b> <b>my</b> cheek touch his cheek, I whispered to him softly, [...] "Oh, how I love you! how I love you!" ...|$|E
60|$|While Mrs Fyne {{was talking}} {{of her brother}} <b>I</b> <b>let</b> <b>my</b> {{thoughts}} wander {{out of the room}} to little Fyne who by leaving me alone with his wife had, so to speak, entrusted his domestic peace to my honour.|$|E
6000|$|... "My dear sir, it {{is useless}} to talk. I haven't {{anything}} against you, but <b>I</b> can't <b>let</b> <b>my</b> daughter marry a hash of love, art, and starvation--I {{believe you have}} nothing else to offer." ...|$|R
60|$|I {{scrambled}} up the iron grating {{of the window}} until I could catch a good footing on the sill with one foot; then <b>I</b> <b>let</b> go <b>my</b> hold and sprang for the partition top.|$|R
6000|$|... 'Ay, in shipwrecked lives. Mischiefs {{wherever}} I {{meant to}} do best! Why, <b>I</b> <b>let</b> even <b>my</b> own Maurice grow unmanageable while I was nursing poor grandmamma. The voluntary duty choked the natural one, and yet--' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Recovering," [...] said Austin, with a smile. [...] "I {{understand}} that my arm {{will be all}} right again very shortly. It was a very usual trouble. As you seem to recognise, <b>I</b> <b>let</b> <b>my</b> imagination run away with me." ...|$|E
60|$|Had I been a woman I {{should have}} wept. At my right was a great, slow-moving eddy that circled far beneath the cliff's {{overhanging}} side, and to rest my tired muscles before turning back <b>I</b> <b>let</b> <b>my</b> boat drift into its embrace.|$|E
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>let</b> <b>my</b> arms fall {{against my}} sides, and rejoiced in the relief from pain that the {{movement}} gave me. Then balanced upon my heels, I stood upright, took my {{last look at the}} sky, muttered my last prayer. For an instant I remained thus poised.|$|E
6000|$|... 'But I {{tell you}} he was with me {{only a few hours}} ago,' cried the Sultan angrily. 'I must {{get to the bottom of}} this before <b>I</b> sleep! <b>Let</b> <b>my</b> golden coach be brought round at once.' ...|$|R
6000|$|Cre. <b>I</b> pr'ythee <b>let</b> <b>my</b> soul take air a while; Were she in OEdipus, I were a king; Then I {{had killed}} a monster, gained a battle, And had my rival prisoner; brave, brave actions! Why have not I done these? ...|$|R
5000|$|... "Throughout my {{releases}} {{and all my}} collaborations <b>I</b> managed to <b>let</b> <b>my</b> ideas flow freely and to develop my own style." ...|$|R
60|$|I {{tried to}} recall {{something}} of the Morse Code, with which I had played as a little boy--but time had obliterated it from my memory. I became almost frantic as <b>I</b> <b>let</b> <b>my</b> imagination run riot among the possibilities for which this clicking instrument might stand.|$|E
60|$|Sally {{kept the}} lead across the wide plain, and mounted {{to the top of}} a ridge, where tired out, and {{satisfied}} with her victory, she awaited me. I was in no hurry to reach the summit of the long, slow-sloping ridge, and <b>I</b> <b>let</b> <b>my</b> horse walk.|$|E
60|$|So he spoke, pronouncing in {{his strong}} Scotch accent the most {{carefully}} selected English I had ever heard. A hard-headed, square-shouldered, pertinaciously self-willed man--it was plainly useless {{to contend with}} him. I turned to my mother's gentle face for encouragement; and <b>I</b> <b>let</b> <b>my</b> doctor have his own way.|$|E
6000|$|... "Nay, my good lord." [...] {{said the}} damsel, [...] "this must not be. As your ward, <b>I</b> cannot <b>let</b> <b>my</b> {{guardian}} part thus suddenly--as a physician, I cannot allow my patient to destroy himself--It is impossible {{that you can}} brook the saddle." ...|$|R
6000|$|<b>I</b> have <b>let</b> <b>my</b> {{house with}} such delicious promptitude, or, as the Americans would say, [...] "with sich everlass'in slickness and al-mity sprydom," [...] that we turn out to-night! {{in favour of}} a widow lady, who keeps {{it all the time}} we are away! ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I do in {{the winter}} time, {{but not in the}} summer. I've got a tidy farm down the river a bit, and <b>I</b> <b>let</b> out <b>my</b> hosses to the company to haul timber. It's cash money, you see, when the haulin' is goin' on." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "It {{seems to}} me," [...] goes on Mack, [...] "that {{a man had}} better take 'em in and secure his inspirations of the sect when he's young and so preordained. <b>I</b> <b>let</b> <b>my</b> chance go by; and I guess I'm too old now to go hopping into the curriculum." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Then I thought I {{might as}} well bear a hand as look pretty. So <b>I</b> <b>let</b> <b>my</b> bundoop go at fifteen 'undred--sightin' very particular. There {{was a sort of}} 'appy little belch like--no more, I give you my word--an' the shell trundled out maybe fifty feet an' dropped into the deep Atlantic.|$|E
60|$|As <b>I</b> <b>let</b> <b>my</b> eyes roam {{over the}} scene I {{suddenly}} {{became aware of}} figures moving upon the flat top of a far-distant butte. Whether they were beast or human, though, I could not make out; {{but at least they}} were alive, so I determined to prosecute my search for Hooja's stronghold {{in the general direction of}} this butte.|$|E
6000|$|... "Frankly, <b>I</b> would <b>let</b> <b>my</b> husband {{do what he}} wished. He is {{obviously}} a very loving painter; you have not yet tried him as a clerk. And you know--if it were only as the possible father of your children--it is as well to keep him at his best." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "What have I done?" [...] he said. [...] "Have <b>I</b> been <b>letting</b> <b>my</b> mind drift again?" [...] He {{shuddered and}} sighed. [...] "Oh, that house of Gleninch!" [...] he murmured, sadly, to himself. [...] "Shall I never {{get away from}} it in my thoughts? Oh, that house of Gleninch!" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You {{will take}} me back, monseigneur?" [...] he pleaded. [...] "You {{will take me}} back, will you not? I swear that <b>I</b> will never <b>let</b> <b>my</b> tongue--" ...|$|R
