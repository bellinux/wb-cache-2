25|$|As for the {{required}} vocal {{range of the}} title role, it is an extraordinary case: The highest note is the high B5, not irregular for a soprano or mezzo-soprano to sing, while the lowest note is a low G3, in the contralto range and officially below the standard range for a mezzo-soprano. Considering this range, {{which is similar to}} many mezzo roles (such as Carmen and Amneris), one might assume that a <b>high</b> <b>soprano</b> is not essential to the piece, but it is; most of the relatively low sopranos who attempted this role found themselves straining their voices throughout the opera, and having reached the closing scene (the {{most important part of the}} opera for the title role) were very fatigued. This role is the classic example of the difference between tessitura and absolute vocal range: While mezzos can perform a high note (like Carmen), or even temporarily sustain a high tessitura, it is impossible for a singer to spend such a long time (with the needed strength and breath-control) in the second octave above the middle C unless she is a <b>high</b> <b>soprano.</b> Moreover, the low G occurs twice in the opera, and in both cases it is in pianissimo—more of a theatrical effect than music—and can be growled instead of sung. The other low notes required are no lower than low A, and they are also quiet.|$|E

The Argus of Melbourne wrote, of her first Australian performance, that she was [...] "Petite in form, animated and graceful in bearing, displaying colloquial tones of sonorous quality and polite inflexion, and having a singing voice both sweet and full, and of <b>high</b> <b>soprano</b> range. [...] Miss Braham got through an arduous first appearance with complete success."

Yaw sang Gilda in Rigoletto in London in 1905 and gave a single performance of Lucia di Lammermoor at New York's Metropolitan Opera on March 21, 1908 (after which she was described by the Met's manager as [...] "the world’s greatest coloratura soprano). She sang a total of about 18 operatic roles. However, she mostly devoted herself to the concert hall, where she had a long and successful career, singing for many of the crowned heads of Europe and for U.S. President William McKinley.

2500|$|Callas's {{voice has}} been {{difficult}} to place in the modern vocal classification or Fach system, especially since in her prime, her repertoire contained the heaviest dramatic soprano roles as well as roles usually undertaken by the highest, lightest and most agile coloratura sopranos. Regarding this versatility, Tullio Serafin said, [...] "This woman can sing anything written for the female voice". Michael Scott argues that Callas's voice was a natural <b>high</b> <b>soprano,</b> and going by evidence of Callas's early recordings, Rosa Ponselle likewise felt that [...] "At that stage of its development, her voice was a pure but sizable dramatic coloratura—that is to say, a sizable coloratura voice with dramatic capabilities, not the other way around." [...] On the other hand, music critic John Ardoin has argued that Callas was the reincarnation of the 19th-century soprano sfogato or [...] "unlimited soprano", a throwback to Maria Malibran and Giuditta Pasta, for whom many of the famous bel canto operas were written. He avers that like Pasta and Malibran, Callas was a natural mezzo-soprano whose range was extended through training and willpower, resulting in a voice which [...] "lacked the homogeneous color and evenness of scale once so prized in singing. There were unruly sections of their voices never fully under control. Many who heard Pasta, for example, remarked that her uppermost notes seemed produced by ventriloquism, a charge which would later be made against Callas". Ardoin points to the writings of Henry Chorley about Pasta which bear an uncanny resemblance to descriptions of Callas: ...|$|E

2500|$|Callas's {{voice was}} {{noted for its}} three {{distinct}} registers: Her low or chest register was extremely dark and almost baritonal in power, and she used this part of her voice for dramatic effect, often going into this register much higher on the scale than most sopranos. Her middle register had a peculiar and highly personal sound—"part oboe, part clarinet", as Claudia Cassidy described it—and was noted for its veiled or [...] "bottled" [...] sound, {{as if she were}} singing into a jug. Walter Legge attributed this sound to the [...] "extraordinary formation of her upper palate, shaped like a Gothic arch, not the Romanesque arch of the normal mouth". The upper register was ample and bright, with an impressive extension above high C, which—in contrast to the light flute-like sound of the typical coloratura, [...] "she would attack these notes with more vehemence and power—quite differently therefore, from the very delicate, cautious, 'white' approach of the light sopranos." [...] Legge adds, [...] "Even in the most difficult fioriture there were no musical or technical difficulties {{in this part of the}} voice which she could not execute with astonishing, unostentatious ease. Her chromatic runs, particularly downwards, were beautifully smooth and staccatos almost unfailingly accurate, even in the trickiest intervals. There is hardly a bar in the whole range of nineteenth-century music for <b>high</b> <b>soprano</b> that seriously tested her powers." [...] And as she demonstrated in the finale of La sonnambula on the commercial EMI set and the live recording from Cologne, she was able to execute a diminuendo on the stratospheric high E-flat, which Scott describes as [...] "a feat unrivaled in the history of the gramophone." ...|$|E
2500|$|Blackwell has {{received}} consistent positive praise throughout her career. About her New York City recital debut at Carnegie Hall in 1987 noted music critic Will Crutchfield wrote, [...] "The voice is first rate: a small, clean <b>high</b> <b>soprano</b> that goes from high {{to low and}} loud to soft with rare unity and poise. It is beautiful in quality and she has the special ability to take {{it down to the}} very tiniest pianissimo with complete control. Her linguistic grasp was secure, and her intonation likewise... Miss Blackwell's personality on the stage is warm and likable, and in one of Roland Hayes's spiritual arrangements she showed an unexpected comic gift." [...] In 1994, the New York Times said, [...] "Her performances at the Met since her 1987 debut as Pousette in [...] "Manon" [...] have won consistent praise, both for the purity and suppleness of her voice and for her poised, persuasive acting." [...] A 2000 article in the Seattle Post Intelligencer in review of her performance of the title role in Lucia di Lammermoor said, [...] "Vocally and dramatically, this is a role that is perfectly suited to Blackwell; the voice is the right size, the right timbre and has the right flexibility for this coloratura challenge. Agile and clear, her soprano soars and floats like an eagle on an updraft. The two big E-flats in the Mad Scene were right on target." [...] In 2001 Opera News said, [...] "Harolyn Blackwell sang beautifully, with crisp, unfussy diction... She sang with a satisfying lyricism, and her [...] "Summertime" [...] was mesmerizing." [...] A 2005 Seattle Times article said in their review of her portrayal of Olympia in Les contes d'Hoffman, [...] "Another scene-stealer was Harolyn Blackwell, who brought down the house with her perfect coloratura fireworks." ...|$|E

5000|$|The Upward Stream, concerto for tenor {{saxophone}} and orchestra. The Upward Stream {{was commissioned}} {{for a world}} premiere performance in 1985 by James Houlik with the Winston-Salem Symphony, Peter Perret, Music Director, with funding assistance provided by the North Carolina Arts Council. The Upward Stream's use of tenor sax was a unique addition to the concerto form. Peck chose tenor sax {{for its ability to}} project like a brass instrument against full orchestra, while retaining the technical virtuosity of a woodwind. Additionally, the range of the tenor saxophone corresponds almost exactly to the human voice (from low baritone to <b>highest</b> <b>soprano),</b> and so has a full expressive range. James Houlik recorded the work with the London Symphony. Duration: 20', (1985).|$|R
50|$|Using middle C (C4) as a guide, {{the next}} higher C is C5 or tenor C. The next C is C6 or <b>soprano</b> <b>high</b> C. The next C, C7 or double high C, is again one octave higher. C7 is eight {{steps away from}} the last note on the 88-key piano: C8. C7 is also the highest note on most other {{keyboard}} instruments. The seventh octave is the range of notes between C7 and C8. It is easier for very <b>high</b> coloratura <b>sopranos</b> to sing in this octave, but some people who are capable of singing in the bass range (like singers Adam Lopez or Nicola Sedda) can do it. While notes in the sixth octave, between <b>soprano</b> <b>high</b> C and C7, can have enough color to sound flutey or canary-like, the squeaky, whistly tones in the seventh octave help give the whistle register its name, as do the piercing qualities of notes in this octave.|$|R

60|$|Ever {{since he}} could remember, he had been {{everything}} to his dear mother. When he was but a baby a scourge of cholera had taken away his father. Several years later a beautiful sister died, and finally a grown brother. Then Philip had become the widow's sole companion. The Irish lady, of gentle blood, alone in a strange land--fortunately a kind one--thought only of her little son. Soon the lad swung a censer before the church altar, while shortly his mother was termed wealthy by reason of wise investments and increasing values. Philip enjoyed judicious indulgence. The devout Catholic lived but for her son and her religion. Early in life she taught the boy to accept without question the authority of his Church. For a lad of poetic, emotional temperament, the duty of service fraught with certain reward seemed easy. Philip loved everything connected with his own little part in the chancel. The impressive latin chanted by priests clad in gorgeous robes fired his imagination, made him long to understand, to become versed in a mysterious tongue. High Mass had always been dramatic, something to enjoy, exalted above play and mere physical exercise. Voices floating from the choir sounded like angels. The boy adored the <b>high</b> <b>soprano</b> and enshrined her in his imagination with the gold-crowned Virgin. St. Joseph did not interest him, but he spent much time admiring the yellow curls of Mary. Young girls with bright hair stole his heart. He associated all beautiful women with the Virgin. His little sweethearts invariably ruled him with shining, tossing curls of gold.|$|E

It was so deeply stamped by immediate experience; it was the art of presentation which, at every moment, uses the means available in a conscious way, and yet never transgresses the borderline that leads to trash...the solo part is specifically written for Roy Hart.
