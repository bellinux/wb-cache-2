50|$|Fiber-to-the-home (FTTH) is {{one member}} of the Fiber-to-the-x (FTTx) family that {{includes}} Fiber-to-the-building or basement (FTTB), Fiber-to-the-premises (FTTP), Fiber-to-the-desk (FTTD), <b>Fiber-to-the-curb</b> (<b>FTTC),</b> and Fiber-to-the-node (FTTN). These methods all bring data closer to the end user on optical fibers. The differences between the methods have mostly to do with just how close to the end user the delivery on fiber comes. All of these delivery methods are similar to hybrid fiber-coaxial (HFC) systems used to provide cable Internet access.|$|E
40|$|One of {{the most}} {{promising}} network architectures for delivering broadband services to the home is the <b>fiber-to-the-curb</b> (<b>FTTC)</b> architecture. In an FTTC network, local broadband access to the home is provided on outside plant unshielded twisted-pair (UTP) wiring and in-house coaxial cables or new UTP wiring. This paper presents {{a detailed description of the}} types of challenges encountered in such a transmission environment. It also briefly discusses the tradeoffs between achievable data rate and UTP cable length and provides some performance results for a 16 -carrierless-amplitude-phase-modulation (CAP) transceiver, which is capable of delivering 52 Mbls to the home...|$|E

High splitting, optically amplified, passive optical networks (SuperPONs) are investigated in terms of redundancy provision and protection mechanisms. Options for redundancy, including the important special case of dual homing, are detailed, and it is determined as to which of these options (duplication of the feeder and first distribution section, and N+ 1 protection of the optical amplifiers in the amplified splitter) would be required to be provided to all attached users to facilitate appropriate availability of the basic telephony service. The distributed amplified splitter dual homing solution is found to outperform the single amplified splitter solution in terms of its survivability. The protection mechanisms necessary to automatically switch to the redundant provision are discussed and it is seen that with the aid of suitable regular precautionary procedures protection switching can generally be provided rapidly (< 50 ms). Finally, an availability, and cost versus availability, study confirms the aforementioned redundancy assessment for fiber-to-the-home (FTTH) implementations, but shows <b>fiber-to-the-curb</b> (<b>FTTC)</b> as needing additional redundanc...|$|E
