5|$|During its time, the West Coast Express {{was widely}} {{considered}} one of the most dominant line combinations in the league. The mid-nineties witnessed the increased popularity of defensive schemes like the neutral zone trap which slowed the game, limiting scoring and offensive chances. The emphasis on defensive has been blamed for diminishing fan interest. When Naslund was traded to Vancouver in 1996 the Canucks often played in a <b>half</b> <b>empty</b> arena and there were rumors about the franchise moving. The line's offense first style helped to popularize the franchise. They began to sell out home games on a regular basis and started to have a following on the road. In the 2002–03 season the Canucks 264 goals was the highest total for the franchise in nine years. It remained unsurpassed by another Canucks team until the 2009–10 team, which featured the NHL's leading scorer, Henrik Sedin. The franchise record for points they set that same season stood for only two seasons until it was surpassed in 2006–07 season. During which Roberto Luongo set a franchise record for goaltender wins with 47, a single season win total that is also tied for second most all-time in NHL history.|$|E

25|$|The Millennium Stadium in Cardiff was {{the host}} stadium {{for the opening}} {{ceremony}} and a double header featuring hosts England playing Australia and Wales taking on Italy. The decision to play England vs Australia in Cardiff to open the tournament drew criticism from some in the press who believed that the game should have been played in England where a higher attendance could be expected, {{or at least a}} full house which would have looked better than the almost <b>half</b> <b>empty</b> Millennium Stadium.|$|E
25|$|By the 1580s, whaling was in decline, as ships {{returned}} to port <b>half</b> <b>empty.</b> This decade also {{coincided with the}} period when the king needed Spanish Basque ships for his armadas. The trade was particularly affected in 1586, 1587, and 1588, when Spanish Basque ships and sailors were detained {{in preparation for the}} 1588 armada against England. The threat of such detentions continued to undermine Spanish Basque whaling into the 1590s and early 1600s. Although whale stocks may {{have had a chance to}} increase in the 1590s and early 1600s with the diminution of the Spanish Basque fleet, it appears the French Basques may have taken up the slack of their counterparts of northeastern Spain. In April 1602, Saint-Jean-de-Luz alone sent seven ships to carry out whaling in Terranova. Other factors, such as attacks by hostile Inuit (which, according to parish records, resulted in at least three instances of fatalities between 1575 and 1618), piratical attacks by the English and Dutch, and the opening of the Spitsbergen fishery (see below) may have also played a part in the decline.|$|E
25|$|Composition is {{calculated}} from three primary sources: albedo, surface spectrum, and density. The last {{can only be}} determined accurately by observing the orbits of moons the asteroid might have. So far, every asteroid with moons {{has turned out to}} be a rubble pile, a loose conglomeration of rock and metal that may be <b>half</b> <b>empty</b> space by volume. The investigated asteroids are as large as 280km in diameter, and include 121 Hermione (268×186×183km), and 87 Sylvia (384×262×232km). Only half a dozen asteroids are larger than 87 Sylvia, though none of them have moons; however, some smaller asteroids are thought to be more massive, suggesting they may not have been disrupted, and indeed 511 Davida, the same size as Sylvia to within measurement error, is estimated to be two and a half times as massive, though this is highly uncertain. The fact that such large asteroids as Sylvia can be rubble piles, presumably due to disruptive impacts, has important consequences for the formation of the Solar System: Computer simulations of collisions involving solid bodies show them destroying each other as often as merging, but colliding rubble piles are more likely to merge. This means that the cores of the planets could have formed relatively quickly.|$|E

500|$|Following {{commercial}} success in Italy, the band did a six-week tour {{there at the}} start of 1972. The band were apprehensive about touring there, concerned they might be playing to <b>half</b> <b>empty</b> venues, but they were all shocked by the sheer volume of the crowds that came to see them. [...] "Pawn Hearts was seen as the ultimate album by the ultimate band," [...] said Jackson, who at times found it difficult to walk down the street in parts of Italy without being recognised. [...] "The tour was like the prophets have landed... you couldn't go anywhere without this lunatic 'Generator Mania' breaking out." [...] After the tour, the group was immediately offered another Italian tour, this time doing up to three shows a day. In between the tours, the band made an appearance on Belgian television performing [...] "Theme One" [...] and [...] "A Plague of Lighthouse Keepers". Since the studio recording of [...] "A Plague of Lighthouse Keepers" [...] was a collage of multiple recordings, impossible to reproduce live in one setting, the band simply filmed individual sections of the song and spliced them together in the editing suite.

40|$|A {{study was}} {{performed}} {{to determine if the}} addition of a fortifier to expressed breast milk (EBM) affected gastric emptying in low birthweight infants. Using ultrasonography, the gastric emptying of EBM alone was compared with that containing a fortifier, in a blind, crossover study. Twenty two low birthweight infants were studied: median (range) gestation 31. 5 weeks (28 - 37); birthweight 1495 g (1000 - 2480 g). The gastric antral cross-sectional area (ACSA) was measured by ultrasonography before each feed and then sequentially after its completion until the ACSA returned to its pre-feed value. The <b>half</b> <b>emptying</b> time was calculated as the time taken for the ACSA to decrease to half the maximum increment. The mean difference (standard error) between <b>half</b> <b>emptying</b> times for EBM alone and for EBM with added fortifier was not significant: 1. 48 (4. 9) minutes. These data show that fortifying breast milk does not affect gastric emptying and suggests that the practice is unlikely to affect feed tolerance in low birthweight infants...|$|R

40|$|Purpose To {{validate}} {{a magnetic}} resonance imaging sequence suitable for quantitative assessment of acid suppression by a proton pump inhibitor (PPI) on gastric secretion and emptying in clinical practice. Methods A golden angle radial sequence (GOLD) was validated {{in a series of}} in vitro and in vivo experiments and clinical feasibility was shown in two studies. The impact of free breathing and image plane orientation on T 1 values was evaluated in a controlled in vivo experiment. The free-breathing GOLD sequence was compared against a standard breath-hold gradient echo sequence for gastric <b>half</b> <b>emptying</b> time in 23 subjects during a gastric emptying study. Pilot data from five subjects assessed the sensitivity of the GOLD sequence to detect changes in acid secretion volume produced by PPI treatment. Results The coronal free-breathing GOLD sequence and the axial breath-hold standard gradient echo sequence showed good agreement of the gastric <b>half</b> <b>emptying</b> time (6 ± 3 min, P = 0. 053). The GOLD sequence demonstrated sensitivity to reduction of gastric secretion volumes induced by PPI treatment (55 ± 5 mL, P < 0. 001). Conclusion The GOLD sequence allowed for free breathing, multislice, combined imaging and T 1 mapping of the stomach content. GOLD presents a promising multipurpose, noninvasive imaging tool for monitoring gastric function in clinical studies...|$|R

40|$|The *C (13 C or 14 C) {{labelled}} {{octanoic acid}} breath test was recently developed {{to measure the}} gastric emptying rate of solids. This study aimed to investigate whether it is sensitive enough to detect pharmacologically induced changes in the gastric emptying rate. Nine healthy volunteers were studied in basal condition, after intravenous administration of 200 mg erythromycin, and after peroral administration of 30 mg propantheline. Erythromycin significantly enhanced gastric emptying in all subjects, with an increase of the gastric emptying coefficient (p = 0. 0043) in eight of nine and a fall in both the gastric <b>half</b> <b>emptying</b> time (p = 0. 0020) and the lag phase (p = 0. 0044) in all nine. Propantheline significantly reduced the gastric emptying rate, with a decreased gastric emptying coefficient (p = 0. 0007) and an increased gastric <b>half</b> <b>emptying</b> time (p = 0. 0168) in all subjects, but {{no change in the}} lag phase (p = 0. 1214). Further mathematical analysis showed that breath sampling at 15 minutes intervals over a four hour period is recommended to guarantee accuracy and the discriminative value of the breath test in various gastric emptying patterns. In conclusion the *C labelled octanoic acid breath test is sufficiently sensitive to show pharmacologically induced changes of gastric emptying rates of solids...|$|R

40|$|Gastrointestinal motor {{function}} {{in patients with}} primary anorexia nervosa has rarely been investigated. We studied oesophageal motor activity in 30 consecutive patients meeting standard diagnostic criteria for primary anorexia nervosa (Feighner et al; DSM III). Seven were found to suffer from achalasia instead of primary anorexia nervosa, one from diffuse oesophageal spasm and one from severe gastro-oesophageal reflux and upper oesophageal sphincter hypertonicity, while partly non-propulsive and repetitive high amplitude, long duration contractions prevailed in the lower oesophagus of another six. In four patients with oesophageal dysmotility not responding to therapy and in 12 of 15 patients with normal oesophageal manometry, gastric emptying of a semisolid meal was studied. Emptying was normal in only three but markedly delayed in 13 cases (<b>half</b> <b>emptying</b> times 97 - 330 min, median: 147 min, as compared with 21 - 119 min, median: 47 min, in 24 healthy controls). In eight patients, the effects of domperidone 10 mg iv and placebo were compared under random double blind conditions. <b>Half</b> <b>emptying</b> times were shortened significantly (p less than 0. 01) by domperidone. Conclusions: symptoms of disordered upper gastrointestinal motor activity may be mistaken as indicating primary anorexia nervosa; clinical evaluation of patients with presumed primary anorexia nervosa should {{rule out the possibility}} that disordered oesophageal motor activity underlies the symptoms; delayed gastric emptying is a frequent feature in primary anorexia nervosa and might be returned to normal with domperidone...|$|R
