50|$|The mono-sized, {{paramagnetic}} streptavidin-coated beads are pre-loaded with dual biotin forward primer. Streptavidin has a {{very strong}} affinity for biotin, thus the forward primer will bind firmly {{on the surface of the}} beads. Next, an aqueous phase is prepared with the pre-loaded beads, PCR mixture, <b>forward</b> <b>and</b> <b>reverse</b> <b>primers,</b> and the paired end-tag library. This is mixed and vortexed with an oil phase to create the emulsion. Ideally, each droplet of water in the oil emulsion has one bead and one molecule of template DNA, permitting millions of non-interacting amplification within a milliliter-scale volume by performing PCR.|$|E
50|$|The first paper {{describing}} TILLING used HPLC {{to identify}} mutations (McCallum et al., 2000a). The method was made more high throughput {{by using the}} restriction enzyme Cel-I combined with the LICOR gel based system to identify mutations (Colbert et al.,2001). Advantages to using this system are that mutation sites can be easily confirmed and differentiated from noise. This is because different colored dyes {{can be used for}} the <b>forward</b> <b>and</b> <b>reverse</b> <b>primers.</b> Once the cleavage products have been run on a gel, it can be viewed in separate channels, and much like an RFLP, the fragment sizes within a lane in each channel should add up to the full length product size. Advantages to the LICOR system are separation of large fragments (~ 2kb), high sample throughput (96 samples loaded on paper combs), and freeware to identify the mutations (GelBuddy). Drawbacks to the LICOR system is having to pour slab gels and long run times (~4 hours). TILLING and EcoTILLING methods are now being used on capillary systems from, Advanced Analytical Technologies, ABI and Beckman.|$|E
30|$|The C. pneumoniae results {{obtained}} by the new multiplex PCR were compared {{to those of the}} diagnostic C. pneumoniae PCR test in use {{at the time of the}} study at HUSLAB (Mannonen et al. 2004) (with minor modifications). The primers and probe were the same as in the new multiplex test. Five µl of nucleic acid extract was amplified in 50  µl reaction mixture with 0.3  µM <b>forward</b> <b>and</b> <b>reverse</b> <b>primer</b> <b>and</b> 0.225  µM probe (Table  3).|$|R
30|$|The PCR mixture (50  μl) {{contained}} 100  mM of dNTP mixture, 10 × PCR buffer with 15  mM MgCl 2, 1  μM of each <b>forward</b> <b>and</b> <b>reverse</b> <b>primer,</b> <b>and</b> 3  U/μl Taq DNA polymerase. Ten microliters of extracted {{positive control}} or test sample DNA {{was added to}} the first round PCR reaction mixture. For the second round amplification, 5  μl of the first round product {{was added to the}} 50  μl of the PCR mix containing 10  mM of each dNTP, 10 × buffer, 1  μM of each <b>forward</b> <b>and</b> <b>reverse</b> <b>primer,</b> <b>and</b> Tag DNA polymerase. Two controls (one reagent control and another one serves as reaction control) were included in each PCR run. The PCR results were considered valid only when the reagent controls were negative and the specific amplified product was obtained with the positive controls. To prevent contamination DNA extraction, PCR cocktail preparation, amplification, and analysis of results were carried out in physically separated rooms. The M. tuberculosis load was estimated in the DNA extracts of test samples using a commercial kit—Geno-sen’s M. tuberculosis Real Time PCR kit (Genome Diagnostics Pvt. Ltd)—and the assay was performed on Rotor Gene (Hilden, Germany) real-time PCR equipment based on Taqman principle.|$|R

Polymerase chain reaction was performed in BIORAD THERMAL CYCLER using the following program: 94  °C for 2  min, 35  cycles of 94  °C for 45  sec, 50 – 60  °C for 1  min, 72  °C for 2  min with a final extension of 72  °C for ten min.|$|R
5000|$|<b>Forward</b> <b>and</b> <b>reverse</b> <b>primers</b> are covalently {{attached}} at high-density to {{the slide}} in a flow cell. The {{ratio of the}} primers to the template on the support defines the surface density of the amplified clusters. The flow cell is exposed to reagents for polymerase-based extension, and priming occurs as the free/distal end of a ligated fragment [...] "bridges" [...] to a complementary oligo on the surface. Repeated denaturation and extension results in localized amplification of DNA fragments in millions of separate locations across the flow cell surface. Solid-phase amplification produces 100-200 million spatially separated template clusters, providing free ends to which a universal sequencing primer is then hybridized to initiate the sequencing reaction. This technology was filed for a patent in 1997 from Glaxo-Welcome's Geneva Biomedical Research Institute (GBRI), by Pascal Mayer, Eric Kawashima, and Laurent Farinelli, and was publicly presented {{for the first time}} in 1998. In 1994 Adams and Kron filed a patent on a similar, but non-clonal, surface amplification method, named “bridge amplification” adapted for clonal amplification in 1997 by Church and Mitra.|$|E
