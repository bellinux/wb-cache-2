40|$|We {{report a}} case of seventy-four year-old male with {{advanced}} urinary tract obstruction symptoms and a high serum level of prostate specific antigen. In the microscopic examination of the transrectal ultrasound guided prostate needle biopsy specimens, a diffuse infiltration composed of small lymphocytes which were strongly positive for CD 20 and CD 5 (30 %) and negative for CD 3, CD 10, CD 43 and Tdt. After his referral to the hematology clinics for further investigation to verify a possible low grade lymphoproliferative neoplastic disorder, an absolute lymphocytosis in the peripheral blood and <b>generalized</b> <b>lymphadenopathies</b> were detected. In the bone marrow trephine biopsy, we observed a diffuse infiltration of small lymphocytic lymphoid cells having the same morphological and immunohistochemical features with the cells detected in prostate biopsies. With these findings, we made the diagnosis of small lymphocytic lymphoma/chronic lymphocytic leukemia and its prostatic involvement. In this report, we summarized the general features of secondary prostatic infiltration of small lymphocytic lymphoma/chronic lymphocytic leukemia and discussed the important points in differential diagnosis {{of this kind of}} lesions in the prostate gland...|$|R
40|$|Aim To {{establish}} etiology {{and level}} of prevalence of lymphadenopathy in children. Methods: One hundred and fifteen children aged 0 - 15 years with diagnosed lymphadenopathy at the Pediatric Clinic in Sarajevo during 2008 {{were included in the}} study. It analyzed age, sex, etiology and distribution and prevalence of lymphadenopathy. Results There was no statistically significant difference (p > 0, 05) according to gender and age of children with lymphadenopathy. Leading etiological causes of lymphadenopathy were infections in 95 %(62, 7 %) and malignancies in 20 (13, 3 %) cases. The most frequent isolated microorganisms were viruses in 65 children (65 %) and bacteria in 26 (28 %) of children. Most frequent causes of malignant lymphadenopathy were acute lymphoblastic leukemia in 11 children (55 %) and acute myeloid leukemia in two (10 %) children. Regional lymphadenopathy was more frequent than generalized lymphadenopathy,in 103 children (68, 7 %) and 47 (31, 3 %) children, respectively. Most frequent localizations of regional lymphadenopathy were neck, axillae and groin, in 83, 8, and 5 (80, 5 %, 7, 8 %, 4, 8 %) children. Conclusion The regional and <b>generalized</b> <b>lymphadenopathies</b> in children depend on their etiology and have significant prognostic value for the disease...|$|R

In this study, we review medical histories of 2 affected girls and one affected boy. Our 3 cases fulfill clinical and laboratory criteria of this syndrome. Their clinical signs include recurrent pyogenic and opportunistic infections especilly in skin, respiratory and GI tracts, case 2 suffered from recurrent urinary tract infections too. Case 3 experienced P. carinii pnemonia during a severe neutropenic episode. Other signs were 1 - Autoimmunities as neutropenia, throbocytopenia, Coomb's positive hemolytic anemia and chronic parotitis in second case, 2 - lymphoid hyperplasia presenting as <b>generalized</b> <b>lymphadenopathies,</b> hepatosplenomegaly and nodular lymphoid hyperplasia of intestine. Case 3, the 5 year old boy had an ataxic gait and suffered from recurrent herpetic keratoconjunctivitis and stomatitis. All the cases had very high serum levels of IgM (> 1000 mg/dl) while other immunoglobulins were low. Sm IgM -f B lymphocytes were increased in the first two cases and CD 40 L on Tcell of the 3 rd case was absent. Occurance of this syndrome in girls is a very rare phenomenon.

At gastric mass screening, numerous polypoid elevations of the duodenal bulb were pointed out. Detailed gastrointestinal x-ray examination showed numerous, tiny, round polypoid nodules localized at the duodenal bulb. These nodules were 2 - 3 mm in size with no mucosal ulceration.

40|$|Hereditary {{periodic}} fever syndromes are a {{group of}} systemic disorders characterized by recurrent attacks of systemic inflammation (autoinflammation) without infectious or autoimmune cause. The hyper-IgD syndrome (HIDS) is a rare autosomal recessive inflammatory disorder characterized by recurrent fever, increased serum IgD (normal value < 100 U/ml) and <b>generalized</b> inflammation (<b>lymphadenopathy,</b> arthralgias/arthritis, abdominal complaints, skin rash, and headache). The attacks persist during the entire life although frequency and severity tend to diminish with age. HIDS is caused by specific mutations in the gene encoding mevalonate kinase, resulting in depressed enzymatic activity. At present the therapy for the syndrome is only supportive. Other than HIDS, other hereditary systemic inflammatory disorders have been described: the Familial Mediterranean Fever, the tumour necrosis factor receptor associated periodic syndrome (TRAPS), a disease related to the mutations {{of one of the}} TNF receptors, the Familial Cold Urticaria and the Muckle-Wells syndrome.

40|$|Case report A 20 -year-old male {{patient with}} cystic {{fibrosis}} (CF) (F 508 del/F 508 del, last FEV 1 : 92 % predicted) was admitted for the sudden occurrence of high-grade fever, FEV 1 drop (72 % predicted) without increased cough, malaise, diffuse pain and <b>generalized</b> <b>lymphadenopathies.</b> Initial check-up revealed {{the presence of}} very recent bilateral hilar lymphadenopathies along with a marked inflammatory syndrome (WBC: 35, 680 /Âµl, neutrophils: 28, 220 /Âµl, CRP: 163 mg/L). Within 24 hours, the patient developed a whole body non-pruritic purpuric rash. Despite broad-spectrum IV antibiotherapy (Tobramycin and Ceftazidim), daily fever persisted (up to 40 Â°C). On the 6 th day, the clinical picture worsened and became life-threatening with evidence of impaired renal function (glomerulopathy), multiple serositis, need for supplemental oxygen, hepatic cytolysis and coagulation abnormalities. Both C 3 and C 4 levels were drastically low. At this point, all non-essential drugs were stopped {{with the exception of}} Glazidim. Within the following 7 days, clinical, biological and radiological features all improved. The patient was released under the outpatient treatment prescribed before his hospitalization and without a precise diagnosis as all hematologic, autoimmune and viral detection tests were negative. He came back 2 days later due the recurrence of malaise, fever, rash and biological abnormalities. This time, he also had elevated blood eosinophil count. Oral antibiotherapy (Rifampicin and Moxifloxacin) were immediately interrupted and the picture resolved quickly. The patient then disclosed that he kept taking these drugs (that were no more prescribed) till day 6 of the hospitalization. We concluded that our patient suffered from a drug rash with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms (DRESS) syndrome, with Rifampicin being more likely the causal agent than Moxifloxacin. Discussion From 2008, most Belgian CF patients are adults (â¥ 18 years). Antibiotics are {{a major part of the}} treatment and adverse drug reactions are frequent, especially to IV antibiotherapy. Life-threatening reactions associated with systemic symptoms are very rare however and no case of DRESS syndrome has been published in CF patients. DRESS syndrome is a rare and potentially lethal condition occurring in about 1 / 10. 000 expositions to a putatively causative drug. Symptoms often involve skin, liver, kidneys, lungs and heart. Diagnosis is challenging as patients might have been exposed to the causative agent for weeks or months and as increased prevalence of systemic disorders (sarcoidosis, Crohnâs diseaseâ¦) has been reported in CF. Both Moxifloxacin and Rifampicin have been described to induce a DRESS syndrome, the latter being more often involved. In CF patients who are receiving long-term multiple treatments, iatrogenic complications are an ever growing concern...|$|R

50|$|The {{lymphatic system}} {{is part of}} the body's immune {{surveillance}} system. Blood contains fluid and blood cells.

Some of this fluid is then taken up by lymphatic vessels and passed back to the heart, where it is again mixed with the blood. On its way the fluid passes through the lymph nodes. If nodes detect something foreign passing through them such as a bacterium or a cancer cell they will swell up. This is called lymphadenopathy or swollen glands. Usually this is localised (for example an infected spot on the scalp will cause lymph nodes in the neck on that same side to swell up), but when it is in two or more regions, it is called <b>generalized</b> <b>lymphadenopathy.</b>|$|E
