I must show it to Arrowhead, who may be running past a port without knowing it. It is probable there is a caboose {{where there is a}} smoke." ...|$|E

6000|$|By and by, a moment's lull of the {{universal}} din enabled Malcolm to hear the Regent saying, 'Verily, there <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>look</b> of gentle nurture about the lad.

6000|$|... "Because I have {{observed}} {{for the last}} five or six hours--since, I fancy, she has lost all hope of recovery--there seems a strange prompting in her to say something which pain and failing strength forbid her to utter; and there <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>look</b> of hideous meaning in her eyes, which she turns continually towards her mistress. In this disease the mind often remains singularly clear to the last." ...|$|E
60|$|Nancy {{you would}} call a shop-girl--because you have the habit. There is no type; but a perverse {{generation}} is always seeking a type; {{so this is what}} the type should be. She has the high-ratted pompadour, and the exaggerated straight-front. Her skirt is shoddy, but has the correct flare. No furs protect her against the bitter spring air, but she wears her short broadcloth jacket as jauntily as though it were Persian lamb! On her face and in her eyes, remorseless type-seeker, is the typical shop-girl expression. It <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>look</b> of silent but contemptuous revolt against cheated womanhood; of sad prophecy of the vengeance to come. When she laughs her loudest the look is still there. The same look {{can be seen in the}} eyes of Russian peasants; and those of us left will see it some day on Gabriel's face when he comes to blow us up. It <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>look</b> that should wither and abash man; but he has been known to smirk at it and offer flowers--with a string tied to them.|$|E

6000|$|... "No, I cannot {{say that}} I do, Raoul; though I, too, {{seem to have}} a {{recollection}} of his face. It is a sort of face one remembers, too. I should think his family must belong to the north, for you do not often see men of that complexion about here. He looks very young, not above nineteen or twenty; but there <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>look</b> of earnestness and resolution, about his face, that would point to his being some years older." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Can it be Phoebe?" [...] {{questioned}} she within herself. [...] "It must {{be little}} Phoebe; {{for it can}} be nobody else,--and there <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>look</b> of her father about her, too! But what does she want here? And how like a country cousin, to come down upon a poor body in this way, {{without so much as}} a day's notice, or asking whether she would be welcome! Well; she must have a night's lodging, I suppose; and to-morrow the child shall go back to her mother." ...|$|E

But, one thing can be seen plain enough, Mr. Mark, and that's the breakers. There's a precious line on 'em, and that too one within another, as makes it wonderful how we ever got through 'em as well as we did!" ...|$|E

6000|$|Margaret read--"Will you ask papa whom I {{had better}} call {{in to see}} the baby. There {{does not seem to be}} {{anything}} positively amiss, but I am not happy about her. There is a sleepiness about her which I do not understand, and, when roused, she is fretful, and will not be amused. There <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>look</b> in her eyes which I do not like, and I should wish to have some advice for her. Lady Leonora recommends Mr.--, but I always distrust people who are very much the rage, and I shall send for no one without papa's advice." ...|$|E
6000|$|The {{absolute}} slacker (to {{take the}} worst at once, {{and have done}} with it) needs the pen of a Swift before adequate justice {{can be done to}} his enormities. He is a blot, an excrescence. All those moments which are not spent in avoiding games (by means of that leave which is unanimously considered the peculiar property of the French nation) he uses in concocting ingenious excuses. Armed with these, he faces with calmness the disgusting curiosity of the Game-Captain, who officiously desires to know the reason of his non-appearance on the preceding day. These excuses are of the [...] "had-to-go-and-see-a-man-about-a-dog" [...] type, and rarely meet with that success for which their author hopes. In the end he discovers that his chest is weak, or his heart is subject to palpitations, and he forthwith produces a document to this effect, signed by a doctor. This has the desirable result of muzzling the tyrannical Game-Captain, whose sole solace <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>look</b> of intense and withering scorn. But this is seldom fatal, and generally, we rejoice to say, ineffectual.|$|E
6000|$|... "There <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>look</b> of {{deep water}} about that rogue; and I thought Her Majesty had gained a prize, {{when he first}} put foot on our decks. You are right enough, Sir, in calling him a bold one! The fellow's impudence would unsettle the {{discipline}} of a whole ship's company, though every other man were an officer, {{and all the rest}} priests. He took up as much room in walking the quarter-deck, as a ninety in waring; and the truck is not driven on the head of that top-gallant-mast, half as hard as the hat is riveted to his head. The fellow has no reverence for a pennant! I managed, in shifting pennants at sunset, to make the fly of the one that came down flap in his impudent countenance, by way of hint; and he took it as a Dutchman minds a signal--that is, as a question to be answered in the next watch. A little polish got on the quarter-deck of a man-of-war, would make a philosopher of the rogue, and fit him for any company, short of heaven!" ...|$|E

6000|$|... "'Mrs. Catherick is a decent, well-behaved, respectable woman; middle-aged, {{and with}} the remains of having been moderately, only moderately, nice-looking. There is {{something}} in her manner and in her appearance, however, which I can't make out. She is reserved about herself {{to the point of}} downright secrecy, and there <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>look</b> in her face--I can't describe it--which suggests to me that she has something on her mind. She is altogether what you would call a walking mystery. Her errand at Limmeridge House, however, was simple enough. When she left Hampshire to nurse her sister, Mrs. Kempe, through her last illness, she had been obliged to bring her daughter with her, through having no one at home {{to take care of the}} little girl. Mrs. Kempe may die in a week's time, or may linger on for months; and Mrs. Catherick's object was to ask me to let her daughter, Anne, have the benefit of attending my school, subject to the condition of her being removed from it to go home again with her mother, after Mrs. Kempe's death. I consented at once, and when Laura and I went out for our walk, we took the little girl (who is just eleven years old) to the school that very day.'" ...|$|E
60|$|Montmorency {{is a town}} of {{no great}} size or importance, but lying {{on the side of}} a respectable mountain, in a way to give the spectator more than a profile, it appears to be larger than it {{actually}} is. This place is scarcely distinguishable from Paris, under the ordinary light; but on a day like that which we had chosen, it stood out in fine relief from the surrounding fields, even the grey mass of its church being plainly visible. If Paris is so beautiful and striking when seen from the surrounding heights, there are many singularly fine pictures in the bosom of the place itself. We rarely crossed the Pont Royal, during the first month or two of our residence, without stopping the carriage to gaze at the two remarkable views it offers. One is up the reach of the Seine which stretches through the heart of the town, separated by the island; and the other, in an opposite direction, looks down the reach by which the stream flows into the meadows, on its way to the sea. The first <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>look</b> into the avenues of a large town, the eye resting on the quaint outlines and endless mazes of walls, towers, and roofs; while the last is a prospect, in which the front of the picture is a collection of some of the finest objects of a high state of civilization, and the background a beautiful termination of wooded and decorated heights.|$|E
60|$|There is a {{wonderful}} complementary duality between the voluntary and the sympathetic activity on the same plane. But between the two planes, upper and lower, there is a further dualism, still more startling, perhaps. Between the dark, glowing first term of knowledge at the solar plexus: I am I, all is one in me; and the first term of volitional knowledge: I am myself, and these others are not as I am;--there {{is a world of}} difference. But when the world changes again, and on the upper plane we realize the wonder of other things, the difference is almost shattering. The thoracic ganglion is a ganglion of power. When the child in its delicate bliss seeks the mother and finds her and is added on to her, then it fulfills itself in the great upper sympathetic mode. But then it relinquishes her. It ceases to be aware of her. And if she tries to force its love to play upon her again, like light revealing her to herself, then the child turns away. Or it will lie, and look at her with the strange, odd, curious look of knowledge, like a little imp who is spying her out. This is the curious look that many mothers cannot bear. Involuntarily it arouses a sort of hate in them--the look of scrutinizing curiosity, apart, and as it were studying, balancing them up. Yet it <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>look</b> which comes into every child's eyes. It is the reaction of the great voluntary plexus between the shoulders. The mother is suddenly set apart, as an object of curiosity, coldly, sometimes dreamily, sometimes puzzled, sometimes mockingly observed.|$|E
