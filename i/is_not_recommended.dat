5|$|Before the {{introduction}} of antivenom, benzodiazepines and intravenous calcium gluconate were used to relieve symptoms of pain and distress, although calcium <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>recommended</b> as its benefit has not been shown in clinical trials.|$|E
5|$|For other {{problems}} {{so long as}} power is available for the braking and steering system, the vehicle can be conventionally towed subject to instructions in the owner's manual. Using the car to tow trailers <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>recommended.</b>|$|E

5|$|Tonsillectomy {{may be a}} {{reasonable}} preventive measure in those with frequent throat infections (more than three a year). However, the benefits are small and episodes typically lessen in time regardless of measures taken. Recurrent episodes of pharyngitis which test positive for GAS may also represent {{a person who is}} a chronic carrier of GAS who is getting recurrent viral infections. Treating people who have been exposed but who are without symptoms <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>recommended.</b> Treating people who are carriers of GAS <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>recommended</b> as the risk of spread and complications is low.|$|E
5|$|Although not {{considered}} poisonous, P.fusiformis <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>recommended</b> for consumption. Some related {{species such as}} Phallus impudicus or Mutinus caninus {{are considered to be}} edible (or even delicacies) in the immature egg stage; however, the foul smell of stinkhorns at maturity would likely deter most individuals from eating them.|$|E
5|$|Cleaning up any spill {{immediately}} and thoroughly. Spills may be cleaned by sprinkling cat litter, sand or other absorbent material {{directly on the}} spill. Once fully absorbed, while wearing protective gloves, the material may be scooped into a plastic bag, sealed and disposed. The spill area may be scrubbed with a stiff brush and warm, soapy water. The soapy water <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>recommended</b> to be drained in a storm drain.|$|E

5|$|Due to low accuracy, the C-PIB-PET scan <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>recommended</b> {{to be used}} as {{an early}} {{diagnostic}} tool or for predicting the development of Alzheimer's disease when people show signs of mild cognitive impairment (MCI). The use of ¹⁸F-FDG PET scans, as a single test, to identify people who may develop Alzheimer's disease is also not supported by evidence.|$|E
5|$|Pain {{medication}} such as NSAIDs and paracetamol (acetaminophen) {{helps in}} the management of pain associated with strep throat. Viscous lidocaine may also be useful. While steroids may help with the pain, they are not routinely recommended. Aspirin may be used in adults but <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>recommended</b> in children due to the risk of Reye syndrome.|$|E
5|$|Pharmacological {{treatment}} {{can help to}} manage psychiatric or behavioral problems. Medication {{is also used to}} control post-traumatic epilepsy; however the preventive use of anti-epileptics <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>recommended.</b> In those cases where the person is bedridden due to a reduction of consciousness, has to remain in a wheelchair because of mobility problems, or has any other problem heavily impacting self-caring capacities, caregiving and nursing are critical.|$|E
5|$|Nucleic acid {{amplification}} {{tests and}} adenosine deaminase testing may allow rapid diagnosis of TB. These tests, however, <b>are</b> <b>not</b> routinely <b>recommended,</b> as they rarely alter {{how a person}} is treated. Blood tests to detect antibodies <b>are</b> <b>not</b> specific or sensitive, so they <b>are</b> <b>not</b> <b>recommended.</b>|$|R

25|$|Complementary {{medicines}} {{that contain}} phytoestrogens <b>are</b> <b>not</b> <b>recommended</b> {{for breast cancer}} patients as they may stimulate oestrogen receptor-positive tumours.|$|R
5|$|Pyridostigmine {{decreases}} {{the degradation of}} acetylcholine after release into the synaptic cleft, and thereby improves muscle contraction. An older agent, guanidine, causes many side effects and <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>recommended.</b> 4-Aminopyridine (dalfampridine), an agent related to 3,4-aminopyridine, causes more side effects than 3,4-DAP and is also not recommended.|$|E
5|$|Rolling {{a person}} with an active tonic-clonic seizure onto their side and into the {{recovery}} position helps prevent fluids from getting into the lungs. Putting fingers, a bite block or tongue depressor in the mouth <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>recommended</b> as it might make the person vomit or result in the rescuer being bitten. Efforts {{should be taken to}} prevent further self-injury. Spinal precautions are generally not needed.|$|E
5|$|The {{diagnosis}} of COPD {{should be considered}} in anyone over the age of 35 to 40 who has shortness of breath, a chronic cough, sputum production, or frequent winter colds and a history of exposure to risk factors for the disease. Spirometry is then used to confirm the diagnosis. Screening those without symptoms <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>recommended.</b>|$|E

5|$|There are {{a number}} of common misconceptions {{regarding}} sex and pregnancy. Douching after sexual intercourse is not an effective form of birth control. Additionally, it is associated with a number of health problems and thus <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>recommended.</b> Women can become pregnant the first time they have sexual intercourse and in any sexual position. It is possible, although not very likely, to become pregnant during menstruation.|$|E
5|$|There {{are many}} {{products}} {{closely related to}} shoe polish, but not strictly considered as such. Other chemical products {{may be used to}} clean and shine shoes—in particular whiteners for white shoes, and a variety of sprays and aerosols for cleaning and waterproofing suede shoes. A banana peel {{can also be used to}} effectively shine shoes, but it <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>recommended.</b>|$|E
5|$|Treatment for {{hyperthermia}} includes reducing muscle overactivity via sedation with a benzodiazepine. More {{severe cases}} may require muscular paralysis with vecuronium, intubation, and artificial ventilation. Suxamethonium <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>recommended</b> for muscular paralysis {{as it may}} {{increase the risk of}} cardiac dysrhythmia from hyperkalemia associated with rhabdomyolysis. Antipyretic agents are not recommended as the increase in body temperature is due to muscular activity, not a hypothalamic temperature set point abnormality.|$|E
50|$|Common {{side effects}} include low blood {{pressure}} and cyanide toxicity. Other serious side effects include methemoglobinemia. It <b>is</b> <b>not</b> generally <b>recommended</b> during pregnancy due to concerns of side effects. High doses <b>are</b> <b>not</b> <b>recommended</b> {{for more than ten}} minutes. It works by causing the dilation of blood vessels.|$|R

5|$|Treatment {{is based}} on the {{severity}} of poisoning from the bite; the majority of cases do not require medical care, and patients with localised pain, swelling and redness usually only require local application of ice and simple oral analgesia such as paracetamol. Pressure immobilisation of the wound site <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>recommended.</b> Keeping the victim still and calm is beneficial.|$|E
5|$|A {{high blood}} {{prolactin}} level {{within the first}} 20 minutes following a seizure {{may be useful to}} help confirm an epileptic seizure as opposed to psychogenic non-epileptic seizure. Serum prolactin level is less useful for detecting focal seizures. If it is normal an epileptic seizure is still possible and a serum prolactin does not separate epileptic seizures from syncope. It <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>recommended</b> as a routine part of the diagnosis of epilepsy.|$|E
5|$|Antimotility {{medication}} has {{a theoretical}} risk of causing complications, and although clinical experience has shown {{this to be}} unlikely, these drugs are discouraged in people with bloody diarrhea or diarrhea that is complicated by fever. Loperamide, an opioid analogue, is commonly used for the symptomatic treatment of diarrhea. Loperamide <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>recommended</b> in children, however, as it may cross the immature blood–brain barrier and cause toxicity. Bismuth subsalicylate, an insoluble complex of trivalent bismuth and salicylate, {{can be used in}} mild to moderate cases, but salicylate toxicity is theoretically possible.|$|E
