50|$|Cannabidiol, in an oral-mucosal spray {{formulation}} {{combined with}} <b>delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol,</b> is a prescription product available for relief of severe spasticity due to multiple sclerosis (where other anti-spasmodics {{have not been}} effective).|$|E
50|$|THCA is {{commonly}} used as a biomarker in drug testing along with THCV, to distinguish between prescribed synthetic <b>Delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol,</b> such as Marinol, and cannabis plant material which may also be used by patients.|$|E
50|$|Tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) is {{the primary}} psychoactive {{component}} of the Cannabis plant. <b>Delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol</b> (Δ9-THC, THC) and delta-8-tetrahydrocannabinol (Δ8-THC), through intracellular CB1 activation, induce anandamide and 2-arachidonoylglycerol synthesis produced naturally {{in the body and}} brain. These cannabinoids produce the effects associated with cannabis by binding to the CB1 cannabinoid receptors in the brain.|$|E
50|$|A Beckley Foundation/King's College London {{collaboration}} with Dr Paul Morrison at the Institute of Psychiatry {{is investigating the}} differing effects of <b>delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol</b> (THC) and cannabidiol (CBD), two of the main cannabinoids found in cannabis that determine its subjective and cognitive effects. Cannabidiol is showing promise in inhibiting the psychosis-like effects of THC, and indicating great therapeutic potential.|$|E
50|$|The most psychoactive {{cannabinoid}} {{found in}} the cannabis plant is tetrahydrocannabinol (or <b>delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol,</b> commonly known as THC). Other cannabinoids include delta-8-tetrahydrocannabinol, cannabidiol (CBD), cannabinol (CBN), cannabicyclol (CBL), cannabichromene (CBC) and cannabigerol (CBG); they have less psychotropic effects than THC, but {{may play a role}} in the overall effect of cannabis. The most studied are THC, CBD and CBN.|$|E
50|$|The abuse {{liability}} of dronabinol (<b>delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol)</b> {{is expected to}} remain very low so long as cannabis continues to be readily available. The Committee considered that the abuse {{liability of}} dronabinol does not constitute a substantial risk to public health and society. In accordance with the established scheduling criteria, the Committee considered that dronabinol should be rescheduled to schedule IV of the 1971 Convention on Psychotropic Substances.|$|E
5000|$|There is {{evidence}} that cannabinoids are psychotomimetic, especially <b>delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol</b> (THC). D'Souza et al. (2004) found that intravenous THC produced effects that resemble schizophrenia in both the positive symptoms (illusions, paranoia and disorganized thinking) and negative symptoms (apathy, anhedonia, alogia, asociality, avolition). [...] Some types of cannabis may be more psychotomimetic than others, {{probably due to the}} action of cannabidiol (CBD), which inhibits P450 3A11's metabolic conversion of THC to 11-hydroxy-THC, which is four times more psychoactive.p. 39 ...|$|E
50|$|Marijuana (cannabis) is an herb drug, which {{contains}} {{a very active}} component <b>delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol</b> (THC). For thousands of years, it was used for medical purposes in many {{different parts of the}} world. Recent studies also agreed that THC had great potential benefits for medical purposes. A number of patients who have HIV, multiple sclerosis (MS), neuropathic chronic pain and cancer were under medical marijuana treatment. The treatments could either be smoke on cannabis or oral preparations, which were synthetic THC and synthetic equivalent.|$|E
5000|$|... ===Commercial regulation=== The {{legislation}} defines industrial hemp as {{any part}} of the cannabis plant, growing or not, [...] "with a <b>delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol</b> (THC) concentration that does not exceed three tenths percent (0.3%) on a dry weight basis." [...] The amendment declares that industrial hemp should be regulated separately from marijuana with higher THC concentrations, and requires the Colorado General Assembly to [...] "enact legislation governing the cultivation, processing, and sale of industrial hemp" [...] by no later than July 1, 2014.|$|E
5000|$|Offenses {{related to}} the {{possession}} or sale of marijuana and [...] "concentrated cannabis", outside those allowed by the state's medical marijuana statute, are defined in Article 221 of the New York State Penal Law. The former term is defined in the state's Public Health Law as [...] "all parts of the plant of the genus Cannabis, whether growing or not; the seeds thereof; the resin extracted from {{any part of the}} plant; and every compound, manufacture, salt, derivative, mixture, or preparation of the plant, its seeds or resin." [...] Stalks from the mature plant, fiber, oil and cake made from it, sterilized seeds and compounds or preparations from them are not considered marijuana. [...] "Concentrated cannabis", meant primarily to refer to hashish, refers to the plant's [...] "separated resin, whether crude or purified" [...] and any substance, whether derived from the plant or not, containing more than 2.5% by weight of <b>delta-9-Tetrahydrocannabinol</b> (THC), delta-8 dibenzopyran, delta-1-THC or delta-1 (6) monoterpene, an isomer of the last compound.|$|E
