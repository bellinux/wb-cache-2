50|$|The dynamic {{pressure}} sensor developed by Oxsensis Ltd, {{functions as a}} low finesse Fabry-Pérot cavity which is sensitive to changes in pressure. This cavity is manufactured from sapphire, which has a melting point of 2053 C. Indeed, the Youngs modulus of the sapphire retains the required stiffness to allow the Fabry-Pérot cavity to function up to temperatures of around 1400 C. The light {{that is used to}} interrogate the cavity is generated in an <b>interrogator</b> <b>unit</b> and passes between this and the sensor via standard silica optical fiber.|$|E
40|$|A novel InP-based {{monolithically}} integrated multiwavelength detector {{is used as}} {{the central}} part of a fiber Bragg grating <b>interrogator</b> <b>unit.</b> We have designed the arrayed waveguide grating (AWG) in the device such that at least two detectors have a significant signal at any wavelength being measured. Consequently, the measurement resolution is increased, while keeping the area of device small. We demonstrate the resolution of the measurement to be 0. 32 pm over a working range of 10 nm. The corresponding relative resolution of 0. 003 % is to our knowledge the best reported to date in an integrated interrogator...|$|E
40|$|Fiber Bragg Grating or FBG sensors {{are gaining}} {{more and more}} {{interest}} in structural health monitoring of composite materials. Often, the weakest point in such a system is the ingress point of the fiber sensing chain into the composite material. For this reason we have developed a strongly miniaturized FBG <b>interrogator</b> <b>unit</b> with wireless power and data transmission, which can be incorporated in the composite structure. The interrogator {{is based on an}} arrayed waveguide grating (AWG) filter fabricated in a SOI technology, which is tailored in such a way to give large cross-talk between neighboring channels. The AWG signals are read by a linear 128 pixel InGaAs array flip-chipped on top of the Photonic Circuit (PIC). The spectrometer unit is completed with a ROIC mounted on the same substrate. The SLED and remaining electronics are integrated on a small and thin substrate and surrounded by the wireless antenna. The interrogator has an overall dimension of 100 mm diameter by max 7 mm height. The power dissipation of the electronics unit is limited to 1. 5 W. The unit is capable of measuring strain values as low as 5 micro-strain...|$|E

In this context, Raichel writes [...] "I really don't care how 'George' extracted information" [...] adding that [...] "instead of receiving a medal of valor, he must now defend his name. This is a disgrace".|$|R
2500|$|German prisoners {{captured}} {{during the}} Battle of the Bulge volunteered {{praise of the}} 99th's effective defense of Höfen. A captured Lt. Bemener, formerly commander of the 5th Company of the 753rd Volksgrenadier Regiment, asked his American <b>interrogator</b> about the <b>unit</b> that had defended Höfen. Told it was the 3rd Battalion, 395th Infantry, he said, [...] "It must {{have been one of}} your best formations." [...] Asked why he thought so, he said, [...] "Two reasons: one cold-bloodedness; two efficiency." [...] Another German officer who was captured said, [...] "I have fought two years on the Russian front, but never have I engaged in such a fierce and bloody battle." ...|$|R
40|$|RF {{transmission}} {{properties of}} human tissues were investigated {{in the frequency}} range from 50 MHz to 1 GHz. This work was motivated by the increasing interest in communication links between medically active implants and external interrogator units. We investigated theoretically and experimentally the transmission loss between an implant and an external <b>interrogator</b> <b>unit.</b> We assumed that due {{to the size of}} the implant a maximum area of only 1 cm 2 is available for the printed circuit antenna. The size of the external interrogator antenna is less restricted. The maximum depth of the implant beneath the surface of the body was assumed to be 10 cm. For the simulations we took the dielectric properties of skin, fat and muscle as published in the literature. For the measurements, an artificial muscle dielectric proposed in the literature was used consisting mainly of a mixture of water, sugar and salt. In simulation and measurements the reactive part of the impedance of the antennas was compensated numerically. In simulations and measurements we obtained a transmission loss between 30 dB around 100 MHz and 65 dB around 900 MHz...|$|E
40|$|A multi-antenna {{signaling}} scheme, {{system and}} method for passive or low-powered RF devices, {{such as a}} radio frequency identification tag, are herein described. In one embodiment, the presently disclosed subject matter discloses a Retrodirective Array Phase Modulator which is configured to allow RFID tags to return higher-powered signals with higher data rates back to an RFID <b>interrogator</b> or reader <b>unit.</b> In some configurations, pattern strobing is used which is an array-based transmission technique for stepping or sweeping an RF waveform through space so that passive radio devices may more efficiently harvest energy without increasing transmit power. In some configurations, the presently disclosed subject matter may also use a Staggered Pattern Charge Collector to boost the collection of microwave power. Georgia Tech Research Corporatio...|$|R
40|$|The {{advantages}} of optical fibers as medical sensors are recognized world wide nowadays. Insensitivity to electromagnetic disturbances and relative small dimensions {{are the most}} well known properties. The {{advantages of}} fiber optic sensors are especially valuable within environments with high temperatures, aggressive or explosive chemicals, strong electromagnetic fields (e. g. MRI) or ionizing radiation. Also the intrinsic galvanic separation is beneficial for electrical safety as required by IEC 60601. Practical implementation of fiber optic sensor technology, however, is not trivial. TNO develops fiber optic (FO) sensors for industrial, aerospace, marine and medical applications. This article gives a short overview of optical fiber measurement techniques in general (e. g. spectroscopy and interferometry) and on Fiber Bragg Grating (FBG) in particular. Fiber technology {{will be discussed in}} correspondence with typical examples of medical applications and the associated physical parameters. Each sensor system must be developed according to its intended application, as there exists no generic system. Therefore special care must be given to the design of the sensor head and opto-electronic read out <b>unit</b> (<b>interrogator).</b> Temperature and external vibrations are some of the major contributors to signal noise and drift which have to be considered by proper system design. In case of reusable instruments, like often used in minimal invasive surgery, this means that robustness and performance over many cleaning/sterilization cycles must be guaranteed. This requires special attention for many practical aspects of the sensor head construction. The corresponding design considerations will be discussed, illustrated by a force sensor developed for a haptic instrument. © 2009 Springer Berlin Heidelberg...|$|R
