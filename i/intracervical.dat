50|$|Artificial {{insemination}} may employ assisted reproductive technology, {{sperm donation}} and animal husbandry techniques. Artificial insemination techniques available include <b>intracervical</b> insemination and intrauterine insemination. The beneficiaries of artificial insemination {{are women who}} desire {{to give birth to}} their own child who may be in a lesbian relationship, single women or women who are in a heterosexual relationship but with a male partner who suffers from male infertility. <b>Intracervical</b> insemination (ICI) is the easiest and most common insemination technique and can be used in the home for self-insemination without medical practitioner assistance. Compared with natural insemination (i.e., insemination by sexual intercourse), artificial insemination can be more expensive and more invasive, and may require professional assistance.|$|E
50|$|A needle-less syringe {{may be used}} {{to insert}} donor or partner sperm into the vagina for <b>intracervical</b> inseminations (ICI). The syringe may be used by the {{recipient}} woman (self-insemination), or by a third party, often a nurse or doctor. With this type of syringe, it is necessary to wait until the semen liquifies before it can be used.|$|E
50|$|Sperm {{donation}} {{is another}} form of assisted conception. It involves donated sperm being used to fertilise a woman's ova by artificial insemination (either by <b>intracervical</b> insemination or intrauterine insemination) and less commonly by invitro fertilization (IVF), but insemination may also be achieved by a donor having sexual intercourse with a woman {{for the purpose of}} achieving conception. This method is known as natural insemination (NI).|$|E
50|$|Sperm may {{be donated}} privately and {{directly}} to the intended recipient, or through a sperm bank or fertility clinic. Sperm donation {{is a form of}} third party reproduction. Pregnancies are usually achieved by using donor sperm in assisted reproductive technology (ART) techniques which include artificial insemination (either by <b>intracervical</b> insemination (ICI) or intrauterine insemination (IUI) in a clinic, or intravaginal insemination at home). Less commonly, donor sperm may be used in in vitro fertilization (IVF).|$|E
50|$|Sperm {{banks and}} clinics usually 'wash' the sperm sample to extract sperm {{from the rest}} of the {{material}} in the semen. A cryoprotectant semen extender is added if the sperm is to be placed in frozen storage. One sample can produce 1-20 vials or straws, depending on the quantity of the ejaculate and whether the sample is 'washed' or 'unwashed'. 'Unwashed' samples are used for <b>intracervical</b> insemination (ICI) treatments, and 'washed' samples are used in intrauterine insemination (IUI) and for in-vitro fertilization (IVF) procedures.|$|E
5000|$|With a straw [...] or a vial {{volume of}} 0.5 milliliter, the general {{guideline}} is that, for <b>intracervical</b> insemination (ICI), straws or vials making {{a total of}} 20 million motile spermatozoa in total is recommended. This is equal to 8 straws or vials 0.5 ml with MOT5, or 2 straws or vials of MOT20. For intrauterine insemination (IUI), 1-2 MOT5 straws or vials is regarded sufficient. In WHO terms, it is thus recommended to use approximately 20 million grade a+b sperm in ICI, and 2 million grade a+b in IUI.|$|E
50|$|In humans, {{artificial}} insemination {{can be used}} when a woman cannot, for any {{of a number of}} reasons, conceive by natural means. The sperm may be provided by either by a sexual partner of her choice or by a sperm donor. Artificial insemination techniques available include <b>intracervical</b> insemination and intrauterine insemination. Artificial insemination using donor sperm is most commonly employed by lesbian couples, single women. and heterosexual couples when the male partner is suffering from male infertility. Compared with natural insemination, {{artificial insemination}} may be more invasive, and it may require professional assistance and medical expertise, which will have a higher cost.|$|E
50|$|Collection condoms {{are made}} from {{silicone}} or polyurethane, as latex is somewhat harmful to sperm. Many men prefer collection condoms to masturbation, and some religions prohibit masturbation entirely. Also, compared with samples obtained from masturbation, semen samples from collection condoms have higher total sperm counts, sperm motility, and percentage of sperm with normal morphology. For this reason, they are believed to give more accurate results when used for semen analysis, and to improve the chances of pregnancy when used in procedures such as <b>intracervical</b> or intrauterine insemination. Adherents of religions that prohibit contraception, such as Catholicism, may use collection condoms with holes pricked in them.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Intracervical</b> {{insemination}} (ICI) involves {{injection of}} unwashed or raw semen into the cervix with a needleless syringe. Sperm supplied by a sperm bank will be frozen {{and must be}} allowed to thaw before insemination. The sealed end of the straw itself must be cut off and the open end of the straw is usually fixed straight on to the tip of the syringe, allowing the contents to be drawn into the syringe. Sperm from more than one straw can generally be used in the same syringe. Where fresh semen is used this {{must be allowed to}} liquefy before inserting it into the syringe, or alternatively, the syringe may be back-loaded.|$|E

A cryoprotectant semen extender is added if the sperm is to be placed in frozen storage in liquid nitrogen, and the sample is then frozen in a number of vials or straws. One sample will be divided into 1-20 vials or straws depending on the quantity of the ejaculate and whether the sample is washed or unwashed. Following the necessary quarantine period, the samples are thawed and used to inseminate women through artificial insemination or other ART treatments.

40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{evaluate}} {{the effect of}} <b>intracervical</b> Foley catheter insertion, for the induction of labor, on cervical canal infection. DESIGN: A prospective interventional study with paired analysis. PLACE AND DURATION OF STUDY: The {{study was conducted in}} the department of Obstetrics and Gynecology at the Aga Khan University, Karachi, between June 1 and August 31, 2002. SUBJECTS AND METHODS: In 45 women undergoing cervical ripening with <b>intracervical</b> Foley catheter for the induction of labour at term, cervical swabs were taken for culture and sensitivity before its insertion and again after its spontaneous expulsion or removal. RESULTS: <b>Intracervical</b> Foley catheter was retained for mean duration of 8. 1 +/- 1. 7 hours. There was a significant change in the pathogenic organisms (0 % v 16. 3 %; p 0. 016) from pre-Foley to post-Foley catheter cervical swab cultures. Growth of beta-hemolytic Streptococcus group-B, Candida albicans, Candida glabrata and Gardnerella vaginalis on cervical swab were considered pathogenic. One woman (2. 2 %) developed fever following insertion of <b>intracervical</b> Foley catheter. No statistically significant effect of potential confounding factors was observed on change in growth of pathogenic organisms. CONCLUSION: Induction of labour at term with Foley catheter is associated with a significant increase in <b>intracervical</b> pathogenic organisms despite undertaking routine aseptic measures. We recommend evaluation of this technique for its potential infectious harm in larger studies. Meanwhile, extreme aseptic measures should be undertaken during its insertion to avoid maternal and possible neonatal infections...|$|E

40|$|BACKGROUND: Prostaglandins {{have been}} used for {{cervical}} ripening and induction of labour since the 1970 s. The goal of the administration of prostaglandins in the process of induction of labour is to achieve cervical ripening before the onset of contractions. One of the routes of administration that was proposed is <b>intracervical.</b> Using this route, prostaglandins are less easy to administer and the need for exposing the cervix may cause discomfort to the woman. OBJECTIVES: To determine the effects of <b>intracervical</b> prostaglandins for third trimester cervical ripening or induction of labour compared with placebo/no treatment and with vaginal prostaglandins (except misoprostol). SEARCH STRATEGY: We searched the Cochrane Pregnancy and Childbirth Group's Trials Register (August 2007) and bibliographies of relevant papers. SELECTION CRITERIA: Clinical trials comparing <b>intracervical</b> prostaglandins used for third trimester cervical ripening or labour induction with placebo/no treatment or other methods listed above it on a predefined list of labour induction methods (vaginal prostaglandins, except misoprostol). DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: A strategy was developed to deal with the large volume and complexity of trial data relating to labour induction. This involved a two-stage method of data extraction. MAIN RESULTS: Fifty-six trials (7738 women) are included. <b>INTRACERVICAL</b> PGE 2 WITH PLACEBO/NO TREATMENT: 28 TRIALS, 3764 WOMEN: Four studies reported the number of women who did not achieve vaginal delivery within 24 hours, showing a decreased risk with PGE 2 (relative risk (RR) 0. 61; 95 % confidence interval (CI) 0. 47 to 0. 79). There was a small, and statistically non-significant, reduction of the risk of caesarean section when PGE 2 was used (RR 0. 88; 95 % CI 0. 77 to 1. 00). The finding was statistically significant in a subgroup of women with intact membranes and unfavourable cervix only (RR 0. 82; 95 % CI 0. 68 to 0. 98). The risk of hyperstimulation with fetal heart rate (FHR) changes was not significantly increased (RR 1. 21; 95 % CI 0. 72 to 2. 05). However, the risk of hyperstimulation without FHR changes was significantly increased (RR 1. 59; 95 % CI 1. 09 to 2. 33. <b>INTRACERVICAL</b> PGE 2 WITH INTRAVAGINAL PGE 2 : 29 TRIALS, 3881 WOMEN: The risk of not achieving vaginal delivery within 24 hours was increased with <b>intracervical</b> PGE 2 (RR 1. 26; 95 % CI 1. 12 to 1. 41). There was no change in the risk of caesarean section (RR 1. 07; 95 % CI 0. 93 to 1. 22). The risks of hyperstimulation with FHR changes (RR 0. 76; 95 % CI 0. 39 to 1. 49) and without FHR changes (RR 0. 80; 95 % CI 0. 56 to 1. 15) were non-significantly different with the two methods of PGE 2 administration.

40|$|Modern {{intensive}} {{pig production}} demands {{an increasing number}} of insemination doses per ejaculate of genetically superior boars. In order to achieve such a result the possibility of producing insemination doses in both reduced volume and spermatozoa count without decreasing the fertility of sows is studied. In this trial we studied the effect of insemination with reduced volumes of semen (50 mL) and varied spermatozoa count (4, 2 or 1 x 109). Insemination was performed by the classical (<b>intracervical)</b> or by the new (intrauterine) techniques and the basic fertility parameters (farrowing % and litter size) were measured. The farrowing value decreased with decreasing spermatozoa numbers after <b>intracervical</b> and intrauterine insemination. However, the farrowing value, regardless of spermatozoa numbers, was significantly higher after intrauterine insemination (83. 3 %, 76. 7 %, 66. 7 %) compared to the classical <b>intracervical</b> insemination (73. 3 %, 66. 7 % and 50 %). Litters size did not vary significantly depending on the applied insemination procedure or spermatozoa number. These results indicate that application of the new intrauterine insemination procedure enables the use of doses with a smaller volume and spermatozoa number, at the same time obtaining a satisfactory farrowing and litter size. This opens the possibility of obtaining a significantly higher number of doses per ejaculate when compared to the classical <b>intracervical</b> insemination procedure. In such a way can be increased significantly the degree of reproductive exploitation of genetically superior boars...|$|E

40|$|Background: The {{efficacy}} {{and safety of}} low dose misoprostol as a ripening agent compared to the widely used balloon catheter in developing countries is undetermined. Objective: To compare the safety and efficacy of a low dose intravaginal misoprostol and <b>intracervical</b> Foley’s catheter for cervical ripening. Design: A prospective randomized controlled trial. Setting: Zonal General Hospital, Kwale, Nigeria from June 1, 1998 to May 30, 2001. Methods: Candidates for pre-induction cervical ripening were randomized to receive either 250 mcg of intravaginal misoprostol every four hours (n = 60) or <b>intracervical</b> Foley’s catheter (n = 61).

Patients and methods: This was a randomized, comparative treatment trial conducted by five private Obstetrics and Gynecology practices in the USA. Forty premenopausal women aged 18 years and older were randomized to receive either a combination para/intracervical block protocol of 37 cc local anesthetic administered at six injections sites {{in association with the}} application of topic 1 % lidocaine gel, or an <b>intracervical</b> block protocol of 22 cc local anesthetic administered at three injections sites without topical anesthetic, for pain management during hysteroscopic removal of intrauterine polyps and/or a single type 0 or type 1 submucosal myoma ≤ 3 cm. The main outcomes were a composite measure of procedure-related pain and pain during the postoperative recovery period, assessed by the Wong-Baker Faces Rating Scale (0 = no pain to 10 = maximum pain). The lesion characteristics, procedure time, and adverse events were summarized. Results: A total of 17 polyps and eight myomas were removed in the para/intracervical block group, with diameters of 1. 3 ± 0. 5 cm and 1. 8 ± 0. 8 cm, respectively. In the <b>intracervical</b> block group, 25 polyps with a mean diameter of 1. 2 ± 0. 7 cm and 7 myomas with a mean dia-meter of 1. 9 ± 0. 9 cm were removed. The mean tissue resection time was 1. 2 ± 2. 0 minutes and 1. 2 ± 1. 4 minutes for the para/intracervical and <b>intracervical</b> block groups, respectively. The mean composite procedure-related pain score was low for both cervical block protocols, 1. 3 ± 1. 4 in the para/intracervical block group vs 2. 1 ± 1. 5 in the <b>intracervical</b> block group.

40|$|We have {{investigated}} the potential advantages of transcervical artificial insemination into the caudal portion of the uterus (corpus uteri), compared with conventional sperm-dose deposition into the posterior region of the cervix. Three experiments was carried out to investigate: (1) the influence of insemination-dose volume, (2) sperm number per dose and (3) type of insemination catheter on sows fertility (farrowing rate and litter size). Classic <b>intracervical</b> insemination was performed in the total of 50 sows (25 inseminated with 100 ml doses and 25 with 50 ml doses). Intrauterine insemination was performed in the total of 50 sows (25 inseminated with 100 ml doses and 25 with 50 ml doses). Significant greater farrowing rate (88 %) and live born piglet per litter (10, 77 or 11, 86) was found after intrauterine insemination, then after <b>intracervical</b> insemination (76 or 72 % farrowing rate, and 10, 42 or 9, 89 live born piglets per litter).

40|$|Background: Results from {{small-scale}} randomized {{studies on}} the effectiveness of different preparations of nitric oxide donors in cervical priming before first trimester termination of pregnancies are not consistent. We compared sodium nitroprusside gel to misoprostol, the standard agent for cervical priming in this randomized double-blinded controlled trial. Methods: Two hundred pregnant patients between 8 to 12 weeks admitted for surgical termination of pregnancy were recruited. They were randomized into either 400 μg vaginal misoprostol and <b>intracervical</b> placebo gel, or 10 mg <b>intracervical</b> sodium nitroprusside gel and placebo tablets 3 h before the procedure. The baseline cervical dilatation and cumulative force required to dilate the cervix from 4 to 9 mm were measured with a tonometer. Blood pressure was measured and side effects were assessed. Results: The cumulative force to dilate the cervix from 4 to 9 mm was significantly higher in the sodium nitroprusside group, and the difference remained when a sub-group analysis was performed according to parity. Baseline cervical dilatation, duration of operation and operative blood loss were all in favour of misoprostol. Transient drop in blood pressure was observed after sodium nitroprusside treatment.

The {{aim of this study}} was to determine whether the application of intrauterine (postcervical) artificial insemination (AI), with twice reduced dose volume (50 mL) and the number of spermatozoa per dose (2 x 109), compared to the classical <b>intracervical</b> insemination (dose volume 50 mL with 4 x 109 spermatozoa), can increase the fertility of sows inseminated in the warm season of the year. After classical <b>intracervical</b> insemination, farrowing rate was significantly (P 0. 05), neither depending on the season, or depending on the number of spermatozoa per dose (78 % and 75 % in warm, or 86 % and 83 % in cold season of the year). The results show that the use of intrauterine insemination, with doses twice reduced in volume and sperm number, can significantly reduce the negative impact of the warm season on sows fertility...|$|E
