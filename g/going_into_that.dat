5|$|Jordan persuaded Hill to {{at least}} stay for the British Grand Prix. <b>Going</b> <b>into</b> <b>that</b> race weekend, Hill {{announced}} he would retire after the Grand Prix, leading Jordan to test Jos Verstappen in case Hill had to be quickly replaced. Following a strong fifth place at his home event, however, Hill {{changed his mind and}} decided to see out the year. His best result {{for the remainder of the}} season was sixth place, which he achieved in both Hungary and Belgium. With three races of 1999 to go, there were rumours that the Prost Grand Prix team would release Jarno Trulli early after he signed for Jordan's 2000 campaign as Hill's replacement. At the same time, his teammate, Frentzen, became a title contender going into the final few races of the season and, eventually, finished third in the championship. In so doing, both Hill and Frentzen helped Jordan to achieve its best-ever finish with a third position in the constructor's championship. Hill's last race was the Japanese Grand Prix where he spun off the track and pulled into the pits citing mental fatigue.|$|E
25|$|If {{two teams}} playing the final group match have {{identical}} records <b>going</b> <b>into</b> <b>that</b> match, and it {{ends in a}} draw, then a penalty shoot-out would be played, rather than using the above criteria. Euro 2004 marked the introduction of this procedure, although it {{did not need to}} be used. The same procedure was also used at Euro 2008.|$|E
25|$|I made {{a mistake}} <b>going</b> <b>into</b> <b>that</b> fight. I knew Conn was kinda small and I didn't want them {{to say in the}} papers that I beat up on some little guy so the day before the fight I did a little roadwork to break a sweat and drank as little water as {{possible}} so I could weigh in under 200pounds. Chappie was as mad as hell. But Conn was a clever fighter, he was like a mosquito, he'd sting and move.|$|E

2500|$|As events transpired, the {{laboratory}} director walked in, received a confession from the instigator, and following a short office visit let Draper {{know that he}} did not have the spirit for scientific research, and would not be <b>going</b> <b>into</b> <b>that</b> field. [...] While Draper thought this a tragedy at the time, he later looked at it as a great turning point in his career, freeing him for work that would eventually bring him prominence in his profession. [...] Draper was allowed to finish the course, after which one of his older classmates, Dr. Hugh Cumming, was put in charge of a scientific study of shellfish and water pollution. [...] Cumming then put Draper in charge of a small laboratory in Colonial Beach, Virginia where he spent the next year studying the bacteriological contamination of oysters in the Potomac River. [...] Since both Washington D.C. and Alexandria, Virginia dumped their raw sewage into the river, Draper was to answer the question of whether oysters were affected 68 miles downstream. [...] He discovered that the pollution had been neutralized by natural processes much further upstream, and thus had no effect where he ran most of his tests. [...] The study was important to ease fears that pollution might be affecting the extensive oyster beds near Point Lookout, Maryland, much further downstream.|$|E

60|$|MINNIE. Don't {{you believe}} it, Mrs. Pindar. I knew {{a woman in}} Newcastle--but there's no use <b>going</b> <b>into</b> <b>that,</b> I guess. There's worse kinds of badness than what you call bad.|$|E

50|$|Chile's civil union {{provisions}} enable {{couples to}} claim pension benefits and inherit property if their civil partner dies {{as well as}} more easily co-own property and make medical decisions for one another.

5000|$|An unfair {{preference}} (or [...] "voidable preference") is a {{legal term}} arising in bankruptcy law where a person or company transfers assets or pays a debt to a creditor shortly before <b>going</b> <b>into</b> bankruptcy, <b>that</b> payment or transfer can be set aside on {{the application of the}} liquidator or trustee in bankruptcy as an unfair preference or simply a preference.|$|R

'I saw Mr. Man's boy Tommy when he put that house there, and he took good care that the corn should be seen by any who passed.

It won't do, you know, breaking machines: everything must go on--trade, manufactures, commerce, interchange of staples--that kind of thing--since Adam Smith, that must go on. We must look all over the globe:--'Observation with extensive view,' must look everywhere, 'from China to Peru,' as somebody says--Johnson, I think, 'The Rambler,' you know. That is what I have done {{up to a certain}} point--not as far as Peru; but I've not always stayed at home--I saw it wouldn't do.
