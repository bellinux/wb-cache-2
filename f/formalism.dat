40|$|This paper {{gives an}} {{overview}} of the Möbius framework, and gives a formal specification for defining atomic models within the framework. The framework is designed to be capable of incorporating multiple modeling <b>formalisms,</b> including atomic models (e. g, SPNs), composition <b>formalisms</b> (e. g., Replicate/Join), measure specification <b>formalisms,</b> connection <b>formalisms,</b> and solvers. We focus on atomic models, which are composed of actions, state variables, and properties. We argue that these are sufficient to specify a large number of atomic model <b>formalisms</b> in the Möbius framework. The framework serves as a basis for the Möbius tool [13]. ...|$|R
5000|$|Better <b>formalisms.</b> A {{significant}} amount {{of work in the}} runtime verification community has been put into designing specification <b>formalisms</b> that fit the desired application domains for runtime verification better than the conventional specification <b>formalisms.</b> Some of these consist of slight or no syntactic changes to the conventional <b>formalisms,</b> but only of changes to their semantics (e.g., finite trace versus infinite trace semantics, etc.) and to their implementation (optimized finite state machines instead of Buchi automata, etc.). Others extend existing <b>formalisms</b> with features that are amenable for runtime verification but may not easily be for other verification approaches, such as adding parameters, as seen in the examples above. Finally, there are specification <b>formalisms</b> that have been designed specifically for runtime verification, attempting to achieve their best for this domain and caring little about other application domains. Designing universally better or domain-specifically better specification <b>formalisms</b> for runtime verification is {{and will continue to be}} one of its major research challenges.|$|R

30|$|This work reviews several {{modeling}} <b>formalisms</b> {{that have}} been used in SB, comparing their features and relevant applications. We opted to focus on the <b>formalisms</b> rather than the tools as they are the essence of the modeling approach. For the software tools implementing the <b>formalisms,</b> the interested reader may use the respective references. Note that besides the intracellular level, several studies in SB also address the cellular population level. Therefore, <b>formalisms</b> for modeling the dynamics of cellular populations that have received attention in the field were also considered in this work.|$|R
40|$|AbstractWe {{compare the}} event {{calculus}} and temporal action logics (TAL), two <b>formalisms</b> for reasoning about action and change. We prove that, if the <b>formalisms</b> {{are restricted to}} integer time, inertial fluents, and relational fluents, and if TAL action type specifications are restricted to definite reassignment of a single fluent, then the <b>formalisms</b> are not equivalent. We argue that equivalence cannot be restored by using more general TAL action type specifications. We prove however that, if the <b>formalisms</b> are further restricted to single-step actions, then they are logically equivalent...|$|R
