40|$|AbstractMalaysia is {{planning}} to be a global halal hub country in the near future. However, {{it must be noted}} that administration of halal related matters in this country is yet to be an efficient one especially when it comes to legal issues of prosecution and jurisdiction. This paper explores the conceptual arguments of the two legal issues particularly its challenges and prospects in strengthening halal related matters in the country. This conceptual paper highlights factors that could improve the <b>jurisdiction</b> <b>and</b> <b>prosecution</b> of halal related matters in the country...|$|E
40|$|Chapter 1 of {{this thesis}} will {{describe}} {{the problem of}} unruly passengers and try to outline and {{explain some of the}} possible reasons for this phenomenon. Afterwards, the existing legal system will be analysed and scrutinized for its effectiveness. Currently, the system to prosecute unruly passengers does not govern the problem to its whole extent so that many offences, especially minor ones, generally stay unpunished. In addition, it contains several loopholes and States do not provide sufficient law enforcement. This is partly due to insufficient rules of jurisdiction since powers of <b>jurisdiction</b> <b>and</b> <b>prosecution</b> can be allocated to several States. After this analysis, with reference to the ICAO proposal on how to solve the problem, suggestions will be made for the improvement of the existing system in order to govern the problem as a whole. Finally, {{the question of how to}} implement such improvements will be addressed. Chapter 2 will deal with passenger rights that are applicable to the problem of unruly passengers. Therefore, the rights of fellow passengers in terms of civil liability of the airline and of an unruly passenger will be outlined. Next, the rights of an unruly passenger himself in cases of mistreatment and blacklisting will be addressed. Although the unruly passenger breaks the law he possesses rights, which must be respected under the rule of law. Finally, a connection between this phenomenon and the "passenger-rights movement" will be drawn...|$|E
50|$|This {{system works}} well {{when there is}} a clear line of {{demarcation}} between the two state jurisdictions, or between a state <b>and</b> federal <b>jurisdictions,</b> <b>and</b> <b>prosecutions</b> may be initiated in the appropriate court.

5000|$|Under the 2011 Directive on combating {{the sexual}} abuse and sexual {{exploitation}} of children and child pornography, Article 17 (<b>Jurisdiction</b> <b>and</b> coordination of <b>prosecution)</b> [...] "1.Member States shall take the necessary measures to establish their jurisdiction over the offences referred to in Articles 3 to 7 where: (a) the offence is committed {{in whole or in}} part within their territory; or (b) the offender is one of their nationals.

40|$|The Constitution of Colombia {{provides}} that certain senior officials, {{because of their}} position, should be investigated and tried by the Supreme Court (members of Congress) or by the same Court upon indictment by the General Attorney (art. 235 n. 4). The Constitution {{provides that}} the President, the judges of the high courts and the prosecutor also have a special status, as the investigation <b>and</b> <b>prosecution</b> is allocated in the Senate, previous accusation in the House of Representatives, and in the Supreme Court for the common crimes. The criminal <b>and</b> disciplinary <b>jurisdiction</b> of investigation <b>and</b> <b>prosecution</b> has generated countless controversies at the doctrinal and jurisprudential level, related to the exclusive competence of the Prosecutor General’s Office and the judges of the Supreme Court to advance the investigation. In particular, the impossibility of delegating the commission of evidence and proceedings related to jurisdiction in such processes; the courts and {{their relationship with the}} position or function; the retention or recovery of competition by the criminal court room after renouncing the jurisdiction in the parapolitics processes; the notion tenure as a basis for criminal jurisdiction {{in the case of the}} governors in charge; a second hearing as a minimum guarantee derived from international standards on human rights and the issue related to <b>jurisdiction</b> <b>and</b> impunity on the subject of political or “impeachment” judgments...|$|R

5000|$|The Hohenstaufen rulers {{increasingly}} lent land to ministerialia, formerly non-free service men, who Frederick {{hoped would}} be more reliable than dukes. Initially used mainly for war services, this new class of people would {{form the basis for}} the later knights, another basis of imperial power. A further important constitutional move at Roncaglia was the establishment of a new peace mechanism for the entire empire, the Landfrieden, with the first imperial one being issued in 1103 under Henry IV at Mainz. This was an attempt to abolish private feuds, between the many dukes and other people, and to tie the Emperor's subordinates to a legal system of <b>jurisdiction</b> <b>and</b> public <b>prosecution</b> of criminal acts - a predecessor of the modern concept of [...] "rule of law". Another new concept of the time was the systematic foundation of new cities by the Emperor and by the local dukes. These were partly caused by the explosion in population, and they also concentrated economic power at strategic locations. Before this, cities had only existed in the form of old Roman foundations or older bishoprics. Cities that were founded in the 12th century include Freiburg, possibly the economic model for many later cities, and Munich.|$|R

40|$|The Consolidation of Labor Laws (CLT) {{fixed the}} {{territorial}} <b>jurisdiction</b> for proposition <b>and</b> <b>prosecution</b> of labor actions, considering, in general, {{the last place}} of service, which is provided in the art. 651 of the legislative instrument. This paper aimed at revealing the basis of Klaus Gunther’s argument theory, at which the valid positive rule (justification of speech) would be passive of not application (application of speech). In this sense, the dissertation promoted arguments that would warrant the proposal of a labor complaint on where the worker’s interests were favored, even admitting as competent court {{the one of the}} person’s domicile or other that is understood to be the best for the defense of their questions. The reflection that was brought was marked by a conflict between the positive standard and worker protection principles, free access to justice, reasonableness and proportionality. As the application of substantive and procedural rules of work should also protect the disadvantaged it cannot be justified, in the matter of the own instrumentality of the process, to consider establishing a general rule that no more moves in harmony with the principles of democratic rule of law. It was adopted the inductive-deductive method, functionalist dialectic, suitable for research of legal science...|$|R

It was also noted that he tried to deceive the polygraph interviewers in his pre-test interviews. Four years later, a newly elected chief prosecutor in Oakland County, L. Brooks Patterson, believed the Robison crime had originated within his <b>jurisdiction</b> <b>and</b> reopened the <b>prosecution.</b> When the prime suspect Scolaro learned of the impending charges and arrest, he committed suicide on March 8, 1973. Scolaro left behind a typewritten note on which he wrote [...] "I am a lier sic - a cheat - a phony with a list of people he had swindled in multiple business schemes. He then added a handwritten note to his mother on the same sheet of paper saying [...] "I {{had nothing to do with}} the Robisons - I'm a liar but not a murderer - I'm sick and scared - God and everyone please forgive me." [...] Since Michigan law does not permit an open murder case to be officially closed, the suicide of the prime suspect Scolaro placed the case in the inactive file. Thus, many questions remained unanswered. Over many years other crime theories have surfaced but to date none have ever been substantiated.|$|R

2500|$|Tribal-State Compact {{is a form}} of {{cooperation}} commonly used in Class III gambling. [...] These compacts affect the balance of power between states, federal, and tribal governments. Although the compact must receive final approval from the U.S. Secretary of the Interior, the compact demonstrates a state's ability to regulate and even tax Class III tribal gaming within its borders. [...] In addition, compacts often include language relating to a state's right to enforce criminal and civil law <b>and</b> <b>prosecution</b> for gambling-related crimes. This right may conflict with tribal law enforcement <b>jurisdictions</b> <b>and</b> legal procedures. Since enforcement of gambling-related laws requires resources, states make sure to include language in the compact that requires tribes to financially compensate the state for regulation and law enforcement. [...] As problems often arise because of compacts, the IGRA seeks to carefully define what compacts entail.|$|R
