5|$|By the end {{of their}} active use in 1902 {{together}} they had fired 1540 rounds in practice, though not all at full power as they are recorded as firing under 300 effective full charges. By then the wheels were significantly rotted and the ammunition limbers had become unserviceable. Less wheels, the guns were removed from the fort in 1909; Adelaide's city council then set them in Brougham Gardens, North Adelaide. Both were returned to the fort in 1976 and remounted on restored carriages of the original design. They are the only two guns of their type remaining in Australia. The southern gun (Number 463) fired three blank charges in 1980 to mark the centenary of the <b>first</b> <b>firing</b> at the fort. This same gun is fired regularly by the volunteers of the Fort Glanville Historical Association (FGHA).|$|E
5|$|A {{significant}} change in the fort's conservation and preservation outlook was its declaration as a Historic Relic under the Aboriginal and Historic Relics Preservation Act in 1972. Up to then there had been growing awareness of the significance of the site in terms of the state's colonial heritage. Control of the park was moved to the National Parks and Wildlife Service (NPWS), and the fort and surrounds became designated as Fort Glanville Conservation Park. The National Estate Grants Program provided funds in 1975 for conservation work; NPWS began this work in the same year and the caravan park boundary was moved southwards. Though the site had long been neglected, there was minimal permanent damage to its structure. During the 1970s reconstruction, much of the stockade was replaced. The replaced timbers are visibly different as they have shrunk significantly with large gaps that are not evident in the original timber. Adelaide City Council agreed to return the 64-pounder guns and new wheels were made; replacing those rotted over half a century before. In a ceremony on 2 October 1980, the 100th anniversary of the guns <b>first</b> <b>firing,</b> one of the 64-pounders was fired again; later a commemoration plaque was added to the fort's flagpole's base. Shortly after this firing the Fort Glanville Historical Association was formed, and was incorporated in 1981. Fort Glanville was opened for public visitation in 1981.|$|E
5|$|The German team {{started the}} second half in a more {{positive}} mood with Jancker forcing a save from Schmeichel in the first minute of the restart. Basler was proving to be Bayern's most dangerous player, <b>first</b> <b>firing</b> a 30-yard shot towards goal and then setting up a header for Markus Babbel, who missed the ball entirely. United put together an attack when, after a healthy period of possession, Giggs sent in a cross towards Jesper Blomqvist who could only knock the ball over the bar after a desperate stretch. Another chance for Basler prompted Alex Ferguson to bring on striker Teddy Sheringham. Ottmar Hitzfeld responded with a substitution of his own, bringing on Mehmet Scholl, who immediately set up Stefan Effenberg for a long-range shot which went narrowly wide. Schmeichel kept his side in the game when tipping another Effenberg shot over the bar after 75 minutes. Scholl then almost scored from a delicate 20-yard chip after a run from Basler, but the ball bounced back off the post and {{into the arms of}} a relieved Schmeichel. With the game seemingly drifting away from the English side, Ferguson introduced striker Ole Gunnar Solskjær with 10 minutes remaining. The substitute immediately forced Kahn into a diving save with a header; it was the closest United had come to scoring all game. A minute later, Bayern missed a chance to secure the trophy when an overhead kick from Jancker came off the crossbar. As the game crept into the last five minutes, United's two substitutes forced Kahn into more saves, firstly through a Sheringham volley and then from another Solskjær header.|$|E

25|$|The rear COW gun {{mounting}} {{was installed}} immediately aft of the wing, in a fixed mount that only {{allowed for a}} limited adjustment of the angle. A special sight for this gun was installed in the pilot's cockpit. This armament would be aimed by the pilot from a position below the aircraft attacked, {{in the manner of}} the Schräge Musik installation used by the Germans during WWII. However, the concept was based on the theory of no allowance sighting, which sought to install the gun at an angle at which the body lift of the projectile, due to the forward motion of the aircraft, would compensate for the effect of gravity, straightening the trajectory. The <b>first</b> <b>firing</b> trials resulted in several broken wing ribs, and a special rubber-spring shield was developed to protect the upper wing.|$|E
25|$|At the Battle of Wagram, Sahuc led a {{division}} {{consisting of the}} 6th Chasseurs, 8th Chasseurs, and 9th Chasseurs. Before crossing the Danube, he gave a bombastic speech to his horsemen. His cavalry supported the evening attack on 5 July. At first the attack looked promising and Sahuc's chasseurs broke an Austrian battalion. Then the Vincent Chevau-léger Regiment No. 4 caught his horsemen in flank and drove them off. Without cavalry support, the infantry faltered {{in the face of}} an Austrian infantry counterattack. The assault ended in failure with the French fleeing back to their starting positions after suffering heavy losses. As dusk came on, Sahuc's troopers countercharged the Austrian cavalry, <b>first</b> <b>firing</b> a volley with their pistols and carbines before wading into them. In the gloom, the white-coated chevau-légers presented obvious targets. Even so, Sahuc lost two of his colonels before the entire French force fell back. On 6 July, his cavalry guarded the flanks of Jacques MacDonald's famous hollow square as it attacked the Austrian center.|$|E
25|$|On {{the morning}} of July 9, 1850, the Báb {{was taken to the}} {{courtyard}} of the barracks in which he was being held, where thousands of people had gathered to watch his execution. The Báb and Anís were suspended on a wall and a large firing squad of Christian soldiers prepared to shoot. Numerous eye-witness reports, including those of Western diplomats, recount the result. The order was given to fire and the barracks square filled with musket smoke. When it cleared, the Báb was no longer in the courtyard and his companion stood there unharmed; the bullets apparently had not harmed either man, but had cut the rope suspending them from the wall. There was a great commotion, many in the crowd believing the Báb had ascended to heaven or simply disappeared. But the soldiers subsequently found the Báb {{in another part of the}} barracks, completely unharmed, giving his final instructions to his secretary. He and Anis were tied up for execution a second time, a second firing squad of Muslim soldiers was ranged in front of them, and a second order to fire was given. This time, the Báb and his companion were killed. In Bábí and Bahá'í tradition, the failure of the <b>first</b> <b>firing</b> squad to kill the Báb is believed to have been a miracle. Their remains were dumped outside the gates of the town to be eaten by animals.|$|E

2500|$|Historian David Chandler {{writes that}} upon the order [...] "first firing, take care", in the British platoon firing system, the six platoons of the <b>first</b> <b>firing</b> {{with the whole}} of the front rank of each British {{battalion}} fired together – explaining the efficacy of the British first volley. Additionally, Chandler describes the advance as also a British development of the platoon firing system in which troops mounting an attack continue to advance to give fire by stepping out ahead {{of the rest of the}} marching battalion, when they are done and reloading the other platoons advance ahead of them and give fire in turn. This explains the slow advance of the column noted in many first hand accounts.|$|E

The Japanese shot <b>first,</b> <b>firing</b> two volleys of muskets and arrows, and Pessoa responded with two successive broadsides of five guns apiece, with flutes and trumpets playing after each volley {{to add insult to}} injury. The Japanese flotilla scattered and retreated for the night as the Portuguese carrack anchored off Fukahori (...) for lack of wind.|$|E
2500|$|The USAF BIG SAFARI program office {{managed the}} Predator program {{and was given}} {{direction}} on 21 June 2000 to explore options to arm the aircraft. [...] This led to it being fitted with reinforced wings and stores pylons to carry munitions, {{as well as a}} laser designator. The RQ-1 conducted its <b>first</b> <b>firing</b> of a Hellfire anti-tank missile on 16 February 2001; over a bombing range near Indian Springs Air Force Station north of Las Vegas, Nevada, an inert AGM-114C successfully hit a tank target. This led to a series of tests on 21 February 2001 in which the Predator fired three Hellfire missiles, scoring hits on a stationary tank with all three missiles. Following the February tests, {{the decision was made to}} move immediately to increment two of the testing phase, which involved more complex tests to hunt for simulated moving targets from greater altitudes with the more advanced AGM-114K version. The scheme was put into service, with the armed Predators given the new designation of MQ-1A. The Predator gives little warning of attack; it is relatively quiet and the Hellfire is supersonic, so it strikes before it is heard by the target.|$|E

2500|$|... 21 September was Triggers best day. She was patrolling some [...] {{north of}} the Hoka Sho light when she sighted a convoy of three tankers and three freighters {{protected}} by Japanese planes. The submarine attacked the tankers <b>first,</b> <b>firing</b> three torpedoes at the leader and three at the second. One hit aft was seen on the lead tanker, and flames shot over [...] into the air. The target's crew, dressed in whites, could be seen running forward to escape the fire. One torpedo hit the second tanker amidships, and it broke in half beneath the stack and sank immediately. Trigger turned and fired three stern tubes at the third tanker. This target swung toward the submarine, and all three torpedoes missed. Trigger then fired another torpedo which hit that ship's starboard side. When the submarine went deep, Dornin slipped and fell into the periscope well as the quartermaster was lowering it. He supported himself on his elbows, and the quartermaster heard his shouts in time to prevent a serious accident. Sonar reported two more explosions before the submarine came back up to periscope depth to resume the attack. Trigger fired two bow torpedoes at the third freighter in the column and scored two hits on the target which went down by the bow. The submarine then made two more attacks on the freighter, but all of her torpedoes either missed or were duds. During the three and one-half hours of action, Trigger sank two tankers, Shiriya and Shoyo Maru, and a freighter, Argun Maru, {{for a total of}} 20,660tons of enemy shipping. The submarine returned to Midway on 30 September to be refitted and rearmed.|$|E
