5|$|In {{order to}} further enhance the appeal of its new {{flagship}} product, in 1993 the firm established a Communication Services division, designed {{to tap into the}} commercial market. The firm started making deals with major telecommunication companies, such as BellSouth and MCI Inc. in preparation for the services the firm was about to offer. In November of that year the division launched its <b>Fax</b> Broadcast service. The <b>Fax</b> Broadcast service allowed subscribers to upload a single <b>fax</b> and a recipient list to Delrina. Systems at Delrina would then send out the <b>fax</b> to the recipients on that list, to a maximum of 500 <b>fax</b> numbers. A subsequent <b>Fax</b> Mailbox feature—which enabled subscribers to remotely access both <b>fax</b> and voice messages from a single phone number—was initially held up following a dispute with AlphaNet Telecom for the rights to the technology. This dispute was resolved by June 1994, though with both sides publicly disputing the story of the other, and with AlphaNet receiving an undisclosed sum in compensation.|$|E
5|$|Though {{the market}} for <b>fax</b> {{software}} would shrink significantly {{as the use of}} email became more pervasive, WinFax brought in significant revenue for Symantec; a year after the merger sales of <b>fax</b> software accounted for 10% of Symantec's revenues.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{develops}} {{a theoretical framework}} based on genre analysis and cross-cultural persuasion for comparing English and Chinese business <b>faxes.</b> Although extensive {{research has been done}} in genre analysis and second language writing, scarce literature can be found in cross-cultural genre study of business <b>faxes.</b> Specifically this paper compares <b>faxes</b> used in New Zealand and China. It has been found that English <b>faxes</b> and Chinese <b>faxes</b> are used differently in a number of areas, especially in persuasive orientations. Chinese <b>faxes</b> have a much stronger emphasis on affective aspect useful for building business relationships. This difference is also found in rhetorical structure and linguistic strategies. For example, logos has been identified as a major persuasive orientation in English <b>faxes</b> while both qing or pathos and li or logos were seen as important for Chinese <b>faxes...</b>|$|R

5|$|Bundling the LITE {{version of}} WinFax {{proved to be}} lucrative for Delrina. Whenever a person used {{the program for the}} first time and {{submitted}} their registration information by <b>fax</b> to the company, Delrina would subsequently mail the user an upgrade offer for the PRO version. This sales technique proved to be very effective, and the firm ended up making most of its sales from these upgrades.|$|E

50|$|On April 18, 2005 the Privacy Commissioner of Canada {{expressed}} {{disappointment in}} the way CIBC dealt with incidents involving the bank misdirecting <b>faxes</b> containing customers' personal information. One involved misdirecting <b>faxes</b> to a scrap yard operator in West Virginia from 2001 to 2004. The misdirected <b>faxes</b> contained the social security numbers, home addresses, phone numbers, and detailed bank account data of several hundred bank customers.|$|R
50|$|Unsolicited <b>faxes</b> are {{regulated}} by the Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission (CRTC) and must follow certain guidelines, {{but there is no}} individual right to sue the senders. Information on the rules of telemarketing <b>faxes</b> in Canada {{can be found in the}} CRTC Unsolicited Telecommunications Rules. Individuals wishing to avoid such <b>faxes</b> may enroll in the CRTC's National Do Not Call List; its effectiveness, however, is a point of controversy.|$|R
5|$|Hemi, based out of New Mexico {{and without}} any ties to Illinois, sold {{discount}} cigarettes through several websites. Customers could place orders online or through <b>fax,</b> mail, or telephone. Illinois alleged that Hemi sold cigarettes to Illinois residents via its websites, though the only sale Illinois identified in its complaint was instigated by a special agent of the Illinois Department of Revenue.|$|E

The group has taken initiative in joint preservation efforts together with the Foça municipal officials, as well as phone, <b>fax,</b> and email hotlines for sightings.|$|E

25|$|In 2001, a jury {{determined}} Hooters of Augusta Inc. willfully {{violated the}} Telephone Consumer Protection Act by sending unsolicited advertising <b>faxes.</b> The class-action lawsuit, brought in June 1995 by Sam Nicholson, included 1,320 others {{who said they}} received the advertising <b>faxes</b> from Hooters. Atlanta-based Hooters of America Inc., the local restaurant's parent company, paid out $11million. The jury determined that six <b>faxes</b> were sent to each plaintiff. With a $500 fine for each, that amounts to a $3,000 award per plaintiff.|$|R

5|$|Although Bomis began {{a search}} for experts to vet Nupedia articles, this proved tedious. In August 2000 Nupedia had more than 60 {{academics}} contributing to the peer-review process on the site, most with doctor of philosophy or doctor of medicine degrees. Scholars wishing to contribute to Nupedia were required to submit their credentials via <b>fax</b> for verification. At that time, Bomis was attempting to obtain advertising revenue for Nupedia and the company was optimistic that it could fund the project with ad space on Nupedia.com.|$|E
5|$|Canada's Walk of Fame accepts {{nominations}} for potential inductees {{from the public}} year-round, culminating with their National Nomination Promotion {{during the month of}} April. In 2000, prior to the introduction of the online voting system, over 30,000 nominations were received via letters, <b>fax</b> and e-mail. Now submissions are accepted on the official Canada's Walk of Fame website and thousands of nominations are received every year, which are then sent to selection committee for consideration.|$|E

50|$|Modified Huffman (MH), {{specified}} in T.4 as the one-dimensional coding scheme, is a codebook-based run-length encoding scheme optimised to efficiently compress whitespace.

These kvitelach are all printed and then taken to the graves, where they are torn into shreds and placed atop the graves. When the pile grows too high, the shredded notes are burned.|$|E
5|$|The Billboard 200, {{published}} in Billboard magazine, is a weekly chart that ranks the highest-selling music albums and EPs in the United States.

5|$|By late 1994 {{the firm}} was {{considered}} one of the fastest-growing software companies in North America, and employed over 500 people, most located at its offices in Toronto. The firm's financial situation improved greatly, and by February 1995 Delrina was reported to have captured almost three-quarters of the <b>fax</b> software market, was debt-free and had $40 million in the bank. The firm was shipping 200,000 units of WinFax a month, and had an installed base of four million users. The cost of doing business had also improved, as the firm's cost of sales was now 25% of net sales, down from 30% the previous fiscal year, improving the firm's gross profits.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, in Springfield, Adil {{arrives and}} {{turns out to}} be very friendly, helping out Marge with the family chores. Homer {{immediately}} takes a shine to him, and it is noticeable that he is a better son and role model than Bart ever was. However, Marge challenges Homer that while she appreciates Adil's good behavior, part of being good parents is that they have the same respect for their natural children, in that is Homer being concerned for Bart while he is abroad. Unbeknown to the family, Adil is actually a spy sent by his government to obtain blueprints of the Springfield nuclear plant's reactor. Homer unwittingly takes him {{on a tour of the}} power plant and thinks nothing of the many photographs Adil takes, which Adil sends home by a secret <b>fax</b> machine in Bart's tree house.|$|E
5|$|The {{datalink}} for Malaysia Airline's avionics {{communications at}} the time of the incident was supplied by SITA, which contracted with Inmarsat to provide a satellite communication link using Inmarsat's Classic Aero service. Aeronautical satellite communication (SATCOM) systems are used to transmit messages from the aircraft cockpit as well as automated messages from on-board systems using the ACARS communications protocol, but may also be used to transmit FANS and ATN messages and provide voice, <b>fax,</b> and data links using other protocols. An appropriate comparison of ACARS' relationship to the SATCOM system is that of a messaging application to a smartphone; the smartphone functions and will remain registered on a mobile phone network even if the messaging application is closed.|$|E
