40|$|Compound {{semiconductors}} {{are important}} materials in modem technology, used principally {{in the manufacture}} of lasers, diodes, solar cells, optoelectronic and microelectronic devices. The preparation of such materials often involves the decomposition of an organometallic precursor and a particular growth technique. The research described in this thesis, concerns the synthesis and characterisation of a number of novel gallium and indium complexes which may find use as precursors for the deposition of thin film materials by techniques such as metalorganic chemical vapour deposition (MOCVD). Chapter 1 provides a rigorous introduction to the study of semiconductor materials, with particular regard to the mechanisms that govern semiconducting behaviour at the electronic level. The various types of semiconductor materials are discussed, along with descriptions of the variety of methods, both chemical and physical, by which such materials can be prepared and deposited. In addition, the precursors used to deposit compound semiconductors are reviewed, with particular emphasis placed on the use of single-molecular precursor complexes. Chapter 2 describes the synthesis and characterisation of a number of complexes with the potential to act as precursors for the deposition of group III sulfide materials. A number of novel monothiocarbamato and asymmetric mixed alkyl dithiocarbamato complexes are presented, with the structural determination of In(SOCNEt_ 2) _ 3, [Et_ 2 In(SOCNEt_ 2) ]_n and In(SOCN"iPr_ 2) _ 3 described. Furthermore, the complexes were then used to prepare thin films of gallium and indium, sulfide by techniques such as low pressure metalorganic chemical vapour deposition (LP-MOCVD) and aerosol assisted chemical vapour deposition (AACVD). Chapter 3 reports the synthesis of potential precursors for the deposition of group III oxide materials. The study principally concerns the preparation of a number of group III metal #beta#-diketonato complexes, their characterisation, and subsequent utilisation as precursors for thin film growth. X-ray single crystal structures of [Me_ 2 In(acac) ]_ 2 and [(thd) _ 2 In(#mu#-MeO) ]_ 2 are also presented. Chapter 4 describes a series of studies regarding alternative group III sources for thin film deposition. Firstly, a study of a novel gallium precursor, tris(neopentyl) -gallium, with potential as an improved precursor for the preparation of gallium arsenide by atomic layer epitaxy (ALE) is presented. In addition, complexes containing cyclopentadienyl substituents were prepared for similar assessment. The chapter also contains details of a novel liquid-phase source for the deposition of <b>indium-based</b> <b>semiconductor</b> materials by CVD processes. These studies describe the use of a liquid adduct of trimethylindium(Me_ 3 In) which would have advantages over a standard solid Me_ 3 In source. Finally, a brief investigation into the vapour pressure characteristics of the diethyl ether adduct of Me_ 3 In is presented.

40|$|This Ph. D. thesis {{reports a}} {{theoretical}} study of electronic and structural properties of several materials relevant for electronic and optical applications. In {{the last few}} years, in fact, the renaissance of many physical effects has evolved rapidly, firstly due to new nano-fabrication techniques {{that allow us to}} implement advanced materials in numerous innovative structures and devices. The first part of this thesis is related to a new class of multi-functional magnet materials called multiferroics, where magnetism and ferroelectricity are strongly coupled together. Because of that, these materials can be considered as suitable candidates for several technological applications, such as storage devices. Among the class AnBnO 3 n+ 2 of layered-perovskite oxides, I have considered the Lanthanum titanate, La 2 Ti 2 O 7 (LTO), and in order to achieve multiferroicity in this topological ferroelectric I have suggested an isovalent substitution of the Ti cation, non magnetic, by a magnetic one, Mn, obtaining the compound La 2 Mn 2 O 7 (LMO). Operationally, I have optimized the structures involved in the paraelectric (PE) ferroelectric (FE) transition. Then, I have determined that LMO is a multiferroic materials since ferroelectric (FE) and magnetic order coexist in the same phase. Finally, I have demonstrated that LMO is also a magnetoelectric materials showing a non-zero lattice-mediated magnetoelectric tensor, α. Moreover, magnetic noncollinear spin-orbit calculations reveal that spins point along the c direction but manifests a spin canting in the bc plane generating a weak ferromagnetism interpretable by Dzyaloshinsky-Moriya (DM) interaction. The second part of this thesis is based on the investigation about Gallium oxide, Ga 2 O 3, Indium oxide, In 2 O 3, and their solid solutions. This study is motivated by the recently attracting interest on novel materials systems for high-power transport devices as well as for optical ultraviolet absorbers and emitters. Resorting to an appropriated optimization of physical properties and nanostructuration of Gallium- and <b>Indium-based</b> <b>semiconductor</b> layers of chosen composition, it is possible to tune their key properties (such as band gaps, interface band off-sets, vibrational absorptions, as well as, potentially, the magnetic behavior) leading overall to novel multi-functional nanomaterials, nanostructures and devices. This may enable the design of devices based on interfaces Ga 2 O 3 /(Ga 1 −xInx) 2 O 3 or In 2 O 3 /(Ga 1 −xInx) 2 O 3 such as high-power field effect transistors and far-UV photodetectors or emitters. Operationally, I have studied the electronic and local structural properties of pure Ga 2 O 3 and In 2 O 3. Then, starting from the monoclinic (β) structure of Ga 2 O 3, I have explored alloyed oxides, (Ga 1 −xInx) 2 O 3, for different In concentrations (x). The structural energetics of In in (Ga 1 −xInx) 2 O 3 causes most sites to be essentially inaccessible to In substitution, thus limiting the maximum In content to somewhere between 12 and 25...|$|E
