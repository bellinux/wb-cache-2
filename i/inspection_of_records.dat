40|$|Schools, {{like all}} {{buildings}} and institutions, harbor some risks; <b>inspection</b> <b>of</b> <b>records</b> of illnesses and injuries in schools reveals sometimes preventable or reducible hazards. Nevertheless, {{compared to other}} places where children live and play, schools are often safer environments. This finding must be qualified by the paucity and occasional poor quality of data—or even the absence of information about some hazards. For many of the hazards that this study examined, the Office of Technology Assessment (OTA) could not judge whether schools were safer or not. Of course, children daily confront a variety of risks, {{in or out of}} school. In 1992, children ages 5 to 17 suffered 13 million injuries and some 55 million respiratory infections, contributing to their missing about 214 million school days, roughly 460 days for every 100 students.

40|$|Abstract Background The {{guideline}} for postmastectomy radiotherapy (PMRT), {{which is}} prescribed to reduce recurrence {{of breast cancer}} in the chest wall and improve overall survival, is not always followed. Identifying and extracting important patterns of non-compliance are crucial in maintaining {{the quality of care}} in Oncology. Methods Analysis of 759 patients with malignant breast cancer using decision tree induction (DTI) found patterns of non-compliance with the guideline. The PMRT guideline was used to separate cases according to the recommendation to receive or not receive PMRT. The two groups of patients were analyzed separately. Resulting patterns were transformed into rules that were then compared with the reasons that were extracted by manual <b>inspection</b> <b>of</b> <b>records</b> for the non-compliant cases. Results Analyzing patients in the group who should receive PMRT according to the guideline did not result in a robust decision tree. However, classification of the other group, patients who should not receive PMRT treatment according to the guideline, resulted in a tree with nine leaves and three of them were representing non-compliance with the guideline. In a comparison between rules resulting from these three non-compliant patterns and manual inspection of patient records, the following was found: In the decision tree, presence of perigland growth is the most important variable followed by number of malignantly invaded lymph nodes and level of Progesterone receptor. DNA index, age, size of the tumor and level of Estrogen receptor are also involved but with less importance. From manual inspection of the cases, the most frequent pattern for non-compliance is age above the threshold followed by near cut-off values for risk factors and unknown reasons. Conclusion Comparison of patterns of non-compliance acquired from data mining and manual inspection of patient records demonstrates that not all of the non-compliances are repetitive or important. There are some overlaps between important variables acquired from manual inspection of patient records and data mining but they are not identical. Data mining can highlight non-compliance patterns valuable for guideline authors and for medical audit. Improving guidelines by using feedback from data mining can improve the quality of care in oncology. </p...|$|E
