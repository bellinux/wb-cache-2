5|$|During {{the third}} <b>hour</b> <b>after</b> <b>the</b> shooting, an autopsy was {{performed}} due to overwhelming media interest. It {{revealed that the}} bullet had entered Selena's upper right back, near her shoulder blade, passed through her chest cavity, severed the right subclavian artery, and exited her right upper chest. Doctors {{said that if the}} bullet had been only one millimeter higher or lower, the wound would have been less severe.|$|E
40|$|This study {{described}} {{the effects of}} dexamethasone on the leukogram of sheep. Ten healthy lambs, three to five months old, were used. In the first experiment, a single dose of dexamethasone (0, 5 mg/ kg) was applied intramuscularly and blood samples were taken immediately before application, and 24, 48 and 72 <b>hours</b> <b>after.</b> In <b>the</b> second experiment, dexamethasone (0, 5 mg/kg) was applied during three consecutive days (on hours 0, 24 and 48). Blood samples were taken immediately before each application and also 72, 96 and 120 <b>hours</b> <b>after</b> <b>the</b> first application. Total and differential white blood cells counts were made. The animals that received a single dose showed neutrophilia but no leukocytosis, and this change was observed only 24 <b>hours</b> <b>after</b> <b>the</b> application. The animals who received three doses showed leukocytosis 24 <b>hours</b> <b>after</b> <b>the</b> first dose and neutrophilia {{during the first two}} days. The neutrophil:lymphocyte relationship remained inverted 24 <b>hours</b> <b>after</b> <b>the</b> single dose and up to 48 <b>hours</b> <b>after</b> <b>the</b> third dose. It can be stated that in sheep medicated with dexamethasone the drug effects on leukocyte cynetics become absent 48 <b>hours</b> <b>after</b> <b>the</b> application of a single dose and 72 <b>hours</b> <b>after</b> <b>the</b> last application of consecutives doses during three days. ...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. We present polarimetric {{observations}} of the afterglow of gamma-ray burst (GRB) 021004, obtained with the Nordic Optical Telescope (NOT) and the Very Large Telescope (VLT) between 8 and 17 <b>hours</b> <b>after</b> <b>the</b> burst. Comparison among the observations shows a 45 degree change in the position angle from 9 <b>hours</b> <b>after</b> <b>the</b> burst to 16 <b>hours</b> <b>after</b> <b>the</b> burst, and comparison with published data from later epochs even shows a 90 degree change between 9 and 89 <b>hours</b> <b>after</b> <b>the</b> burst.

5|$|Poor Luftwaffe {{administration}} {{meant the}} German defence {{took time to}} get the information from their radar sites. Major Harry von Bülow-Bothkamp—commanding II./JG 77—stated that it was the naval Freya, rather than Luftwaffe early warning sites that gave the alert. Owing to this, the RAF made landfall without interception. The first air-to-air shots were not traded until one <b>hour</b> <b>after</b> <b>the</b> Luftwaffe Freya made the initial report.|$|E
5|$|The Executive {{was struck}} on the {{starboard}} side; the explosion demolished the booms, engine, dynamos and all {{equipment in the}} immediate area. One hold rapidly flooded and the ship began to settle by the stern. Nine of the crew were killed, the remaining 53 abandoned ship in three lifeboats and a raft. The ship was sunk by gunfire from a destroyer about an <b>hour</b> <b>after</b> <b>the</b> attack.|$|E

5|$|Driving to the Emirates Stadium is {{strongly}} discouraged {{as there are}} strict matchday parking restrictions in operation around the stadium. An hour before kick-off to one <b>hour</b> <b>after</b> <b>the</b> final whistle there is a complete ban on vehicle movement {{on a number of}} the surrounding roads, except for Islington residents and businesses with a road closure access permit. The parking restrictions mean that the stadium is highly dependent on the Underground service, particularly when there is no overground service in operation. Industrial action forced Arsenal to reschedule the match for the following month.|$|E
5|$|Ford was {{nominated}} to take Agnew's position on October 12, {{the first time}} the vice-presidential vacancy provision of the 25th Amendment had been implemented. The United States Senate voted 92 to 3 to confirm Ford on November 27. Only three Senators, all Democrats, voted against Ford's confirmation: Gaylord Nelson of Wisconsin, Thomas Eagleton of Missouri and William Hathaway of Maine. On December 6, 1973, the House confirmed Ford by a vote of 387 to 35. One <b>hour</b> <b>after</b> <b>the</b> confirmation vote in the House, Ford took the oath of office as Vice President of the United States.|$|E
5|$|In {{the early}} morning of December 28, police {{informed}} news sources {{that she had been}} walking southbound on Interstate 71 near Union Township when she was struck by a semi-trailer just before 2:30 am near the South Lebanon exit. She died at the scene. It is believed that Alcorn walked three to four miles from her parents' Kings Mill house, before being struck. The highway was closed for more than an <b>hour</b> <b>after</b> <b>the</b> incident. An investigation was launched by the Ohio State Highway Patrol, while Alcorn's body was transported to the Montgomery County coroner, where an autopsy was scheduled. The truck driver was uninjured in the incident.|$|E

40|$|To {{study the}} passive {{immunity}} transference {{to the new}} born foal via colostrum, the total serum protein of 27 foals, being 13 females and 14 males, born from multiparae and primiparae mares was estimated. The blood samples were colected at 6, 12, 18, 24 and 30 <b>hours</b> <b>after</b> <b>the</b> first suckling. The total protein values increase significantly between 6 and 12 <b>hours</b> <b>after</b> <b>the</b> first suckling, being not influenced by {{the sex of the}} foal. The total protein values of new borns from multiparae mares were significantly higher than primiparae mares at 12 <b>hours</b> <b>after</b> <b>the</b> first suckling and was mantained in the same levels for 30 hours. It was concluded that the newborn Arabian foals had the highest immunoglobulin absortion between 6 and 12 <b>hours</b> <b>after</b> <b>the</b> first suckling and it is higher in foals born from multiparae than from primiparae mares...|$|R

Neither the crew nor the aircraft's communication systems relayed a distress signal, indications of bad weather, or technical problems before the aircraft vanished from radar screens.|$|E
5|$|Titanics down angle altered fairly rapidly {{from zero}} degrees to about {{four and a}} half degrees during the first <b>hour</b> <b>after</b> <b>the</b> collision, but {{the rate at which the}} ship went down slowed greatly for the second hour, {{worsening}} only to about five degrees. This gave many of those aboard a false sense of hope that the ship might stay afloat long enough for them to be rescued. By 1:30, the sinking rate of the front section increased until Titanic reached a down angle of about ten degrees.|$|E
5|$|A {{little over}} an <b>hour</b> <b>after</b> <b>the</b> committee's meeting, Governor Taylor {{declared}} a state of insurrection and called out the state militia. He called the legislature into special session, not in Frankfort, but in heavily Republican London, which he insisted was a safer location. Defiant Democratic legislators refused to heed the call to London, but when they attempted to convene first in the state capitol and later in other public locations in Frankfort, they found the doors barred by armed citizens. On January 31, 1900, they convened secretly in a Frankfort hotel, with no Republicans present, and voted to certify the findings of the contest committee, invalidating enough votes to make Goebel governor. Goebel was sworn in, and immediately ordered the state militia to stand down. He also ordered the General Assembly to reconvene in Frankfort. The Republican militia refused to disband, and a rival Democratic militia formed across the lawn of the state capitol. Civil war seemed possible.|$|E

40|$|Tissue {{plasminogen}} activator therapy of glomerular thrombi in the Shwartzman reaction. To {{study the}} effect of tissue plasminogen activator (TPA) therapy on glomerular fibrin deposition in the generalized Shwartzman reaction, rabbits were given an intravenous injection of TPA immediately following or three, four, or five <b>hours</b> <b>after</b> <b>the</b> second injection of endotoxin. Animals were sacrificed six <b>hours</b> <b>after</b> <b>the</b> second dose of endotoxin. Glomerular fibrin deposition was reduced in animals receiving TPA four <b>hours</b> <b>after</b> <b>the</b> second injection of endotoxin and was absent in animals receiving TPA five <b>hours</b> <b>after</b> <b>the</b> second dose of endotoxin. Glomerular fibrinolytic activity was reduced following development of the generalized Shwartzman reaction but was normal in animals that received TPA five <b>hours</b> <b>after</b> <b>the</b> second injection of endotoxin. TPA did not produce a systemic fibrinolytic state and did not prevent the decline in hematologic and coagulation factors typical of the Shwartzman reaction, despite the elimination of glomerular fibrin. These results suggest that TPA effectively removes glomerular thrombi in the generalized Shwartzman reaction and infers that TPA may be of value {{in the treatment of}} human diseases with similar pathology, such as the hemolytic uremic syndrome...|$|R
5|$|An <b>hour</b> <b>after</b> <b>the</b> {{previous}} event caused {{destruction in}} Upstate New York, a new tornado family began producing significant {{damage in the}} adjacent state of Connecticut. The first tornado, {{which may have been}} three separate tornadoes, started its path of destruction in Cornwall, leveling a virgin forest known as Cathedral Pines. At the nearby Mohawk Mountain Ski Area, every ski lift was destroyed, with some lift chairs found miles away. The tornado continued south-southeast through Milton, leveling hundreds more trees, and destroyed the village of Bantam before dissipating. Strong downburst winds continued to cause damage and level trees after this tornado lifted: it was during this period between tornadoes that a 12-year-old girl was killed by falling trees in Black Rock State Park.|$|E
5|$|Around an <b>hour</b> <b>after</b> <b>the</b> {{start of}} the race, three {{children}} were struck by car driven {{by one of the}} race officials on a side road from Quarter Bridge Road, near the finish line. None sustained serious injuries; two of them had cuts dressed, while the third rushed back to watching the racing. Another, more serious, accident occurred on the Snaefell Mountain Railway, which had been transporting people up the mountain to watch the racing. A tramcar that had been descending the railway had broken down, and a second car had stopped close behind it. A third tram, on rounding the bend above them, was unable to stop in time and collided into the rearmost car, which was then propelled into {{the car in front of}} it. Minor injuries were sustained by some of the passengers, though none were serious.|$|E
5|$|Euell {{was taken}} to a {{hospital}} and died about an <b>hour</b> <b>after</b> <b>the</b> shooting. He was never able to formally identify Shay as the shooter. When Shay was arrested in his hotel room that night, police officers said that he appeared to be intoxicated. He refused to make any statements. He was held without bail and charged with second-degree murder. A conviction carried the possibility of life imprisonment. A few days after the shooting, American Association owners began to collect funds to assist in Shay's criminal defense. As the case was about to go to trial, one of the attorneys became ill, so the proceedings were delayed for several weeks. The trial was reset for November 12, 1917.|$|E

5|$|Fort Lahtzanit was {{the first}} {{defensive}} fortification of the Bar Lev Line to be captured, over one <b>hour</b> <b>after</b> <b>the</b> start of the assault. Israeli casualties were 60 killed and 26 captured; Egyptian losses were 23 killed, including one officer, and 7 wounded, including two officers. The most important factor leading to the capture of the fort was its isolation on all sides, and {{the speed with which}} the infantry reached and seized the firing ramp east of the fort before Israeli tanks occupied it. In contrast to the capture of Fort Lahtzanit, the attempt to capture Fort Orkal by the 135th Brigade went awry, and el-'Abassi was forced to commit a reserve infantry company on the west bank to help seize the fort. The company crossed at 4:00p.m. on October 6, and the following day Fort Orkal was captured.|$|E
5|$|Huseby's demands were {{to talk to}} Prime Minister Kåre Willoch and Minister of Justice Mona Røkke, {{both from}} the Conservative Party. He also wanted to hold a press conference at Fornebu. Huseby was {{unsatisfied}} with his treatment after he left prison. He demanded to receive guarantees for a better treatment and economic security from the authorities. Assisted by a psychologist, the police negotiated with Huseby. One <b>hour</b> <b>after</b> <b>the</b> plane landed, 70 passengers were let out of the plane. The first group were those passengers who had or claimed they had transfers to other flights. In exchange, the aircraft was {{moved closer to the}} terminal building. The passengers were picked up by a bus and transported to the domestic terminal, where they were questioned by the police. The remaining passengers were let out thirty minutes later. Only the five crew members remained.|$|E
5|$|Kehoe {{drove up}} to the school about half an <b>hour</b> <b>after</b> <b>the</b> explosion. He saw Superintendent Huyck and summoned him over to his truck. Charles Hawson testified at the inquest that he saw the two men {{struggle}} over some type of long gun before Kehoe detonated the dynamite stored in his truck, killing himself, Superintendent Huyck, Nelson McFarren (a retired farmer), and Cleo Clayton, an eight-year-old second grader. Clayton had survived the first blast and had wandered out of the school building debris; he was killed by the fragmentation from the exploding vehicle. The explosion also mortally wounded postmaster Glenn O. Smith, who lost a leg and died later that day of his wounds, and injured several others.|$|E
