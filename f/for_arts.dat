50|$|Satisfying all ten {{criteria}} {{would be}} sufficient <b>for</b> <b>art,</b> as might any subset formed by nine criteria (this {{is a consequence of}} the fact that none of the ten properties is necessary). For example, consider two of Gaut’s criteria: “possessing aesthetic merit” and “being expressive of emotion” (200, p. 28). Neither of these criteria is necessary <b>for</b> <b>art</b> status, but both are parts of subsets of these ten criteria that are sufficient <b>for</b> <b>art</b> status. Gaut’s definition also allows for many subsets with less than nine criteria to be sufficient <b>for</b> <b>art</b> status, which leads to a highly pluralistic theory of art.|$|R

5|$|SCPA {{had three}} {{different}} homes {{in its first}} four years, including a makeshift campus in the Mount Adams neighborhood and another in Roselawn. In 1976, it occupied the Old Woodward High School building, {{on the site of}} one of the oldest public schools in the country. The school rose to national prominence in the 1980s, but was nearly closed in the 1990s following a series of scandals, leadership struggles, and an arson fire which destroyed the auditorium. Its reputation recovered {{in the years that followed}} and in 2009–10, the school was featured in the MTV reality series Taking the Stage, filmed at the school and featuring SCPA students. In 2010 SCPA combined with the Schiel Primary School <b>for</b> <b>Arts</b> Enrichment to create the first kindergarten through twelfth grade (about ages five to seventeen) arts school and first private sector/public arts school in the US. A new facility in Over-the-Rhine was championed by the late Cincinnati Pops Maestro Erich Kunzel and funded through a unique public-private partnership that raised over $31million in private contributions to match public funding. The building features specialized facilities for the arts and three separate theaters and is the key to redevelopment plans for the area.|$|E

5000|$|Public art {{is usually}} {{commissioned}} or acquired with the authorization and collaboration {{of the government}} or company that owns or administers the space. Some governments actively encourage the creation of public <b>art,</b> <b>for</b> example, budgeting for artworks in new buildings by implementing a Percent <b>for</b> <b>Art</b> policy. Typically, one to {{two percent of the}} total cost of a city improvement project is allocated for artwork, but the amount varies widely from place to place. Administration and maintenance costs are sometimes withdrawn before the money is distributed <b>for</b> <b>art</b> (City of Los Angeles for example). Many locales have [...] "general funds" [...] that fund temporary programs and performances of a cultural nature rather than insisting on project-related commissions. The majority of European countries, Australia, several countries in Africa (among which South Africa and Senegal) and many cities and states in the United States, have percent <b>for</b> <b>art</b> programs. The percent <b>for</b> <b>art</b> is not applied to every capital improvement project in municipalities with percent <b>for</b> <b>art</b> policy.|$|R
