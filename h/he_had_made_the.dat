5|$|On 10 September 2007, Licciardello rang a {{talkback}} {{radio station}} {{pretending to be}} someone else, and complained about the stunt, claiming that it was stupid and anyone involved at the ABC, including Kerry O'Brien, should be jailed for ten years. This stunt aired on the 12 September 2007 episode, and Licciardello said he wished <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>made</b> <b>the</b> call {{on the evening of}} the security breach because talkback radio discussion would not have already died down.|$|E
5|$|In {{later years}} Warner said he regretted his {{decision}} to leave Stanford for Temple, and left because of concern about the school's changing funding priorities. The university leadership was planning to make Stanford primarily a graduate school; because {{of an increase in}} the number of junior colleges in California, the administration saw less need for undergraduate instruction at Stanford. Because fewer students were admitted, higher grade requirements for incoming students made admission more difficult and student athletes began enrolling at USC and California instead of Stanford. Warner soon realized that <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>made</b> <b>the</b> wrong decision; due to the economic effects of the Great Depression, the number of applicants to Stanford decreased significantly and athletes were again admitted. Temple upset the Florida Gators, coached by future Temple coach Josh Cody, 20–12 in Warner's last game.|$|E
5|$|Harvey {{played a}} key part in Victoria's win over New South Wales away at the SCG. Having taken two catches as the hosts batted first, he made 61 as the {{visitors}} made 234 to take a 52-run first innings lead. After taking another catch in the second innings, he then made an unbeaten 106 to guide the Victorians to their target of 268 with five wickets in hand. Harvey's run-scoring tapered away {{in the last two}} matches of the season; he made 74 runs in three innings in the match. Nevertheless, he ended the season with 699 runs at 49.92; <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>made</b> <b>the</b> same number of runs in his first six first-class seasons since his debut in 1947–48. As a result of his performances in this season, he was hailed as the best batsman outside the Australian Test team.|$|E

5|$|West Ham {{took some}} heart in their {{performance}} at Old Trafford by scoring the opening goal, thus breaking United's clean sheet record. The champions responded in typical fashion, scoring twice in both {{halves of the}} match to win a third on the trot and give Ferguson the perfect boost ahead of their midweek Champions League tie. Although victorious away to Košice, United couldn't break the deadlock in their next league match to Bolton, squandering numerous chances to remain {{at the top of}} the table, most notably from Andy Cole. The main talking point at the Reebok Stadium came in the 35th minute, when a brawl between Nathan Blake and Gary Pallister resulted in both players being controversially sent off. After the game, a furious Ferguson personally sent a video of the incident to The Football Association in the hope of the decision being rescinded. Referee Paul Durkin publicly admitted before the video arrived that, in hindsight, <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>made</b> <b>the</b> wrong decision. Mark Hughes returned to Old Trafford and scored what looked to be the winner for Chelsea, before super-sub Ole Gunnar Solskjær popped in to earn a dramatic equaliser with four minutes to go. A first-half header from Leeds defender David Wetherall was enough to condemn United to their first defeat of the season and first in almost three months of football. Worse was to come for the champions, as captain Roy Keane was ruled out for the rest of the season with knee ligament damage, although Ferguson revealed after the Leeds match that they hoped that he would be fit enough to play some part in their next Champions League game, at home to Juventus on the coming Wednesday. Schmeichel was placed as captain in his absence.|$|E

25|$|Macmillan {{felt that}} if the costs of holding onto a {{particular}} territory outweighed the benefits then it should be dispensed with. After securing a third term for the Conservatives in 1959 he appointed Iain Macleod as Colonial Secretary.

He also endorsed 'wrong-way' products including a watch that ran backwards. The following year, he starred as himself in RKO Radio Pictures' The Flying Irishman (1939), a movie biography.

25|$|Young's career after World War II was {{far more}} {{prolific}} and lucrative than in the pre-war years in terms of recordings made, live performances, and annual income. Young joined Norman Granz's Jazz at the Philharmonic (JATP) troupe in 1946, touring regularly with them over the next 12 years. He made many studio recordings under Granz's supervision as well, including more trio recordings with Nat King Cole. Young also recorded extensively in the late 1940s for Aladdin Records (1946-7, where <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>made</b> <b>the</b> Cole recordings in 1942) and for Savoy (1944, '49 and '50), some sessions of which included Basie on piano.|$|E
25|$|The {{letters of}} Alfred Newton include one {{to his brother}} giving an {{eye-witness}} account of the debate, and written {{less than a month}} afterwards. Other eyewitnesses, with one or two exceptions (Hooker especially thought <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>made</b> <b>the</b> best points), give similar accounts, at varying dates after the event. The general view was and still is that Huxley got much the better of the exchange though Wilberforce himself thought he had done quite well. In the absence of a verbatim report differing perceptions are difficult to judge fairly; Huxley wrote a detailed account for Darwin, a letter which does not survive; however, a letter to his friend Frederick Daniel Dyster does survive with an account just three months after the event.|$|E

25|$|Portland was mediocre in {{the first}} half of the campaign, but came to form as the playoffs {{approached}} and managed to finish third in the Pacific Division with a 49–33 win–loss record. While fans at the Rose Garden harbored thoughts of an upset against the Los Angeles Lakers {{in the first}} round of the playoffs, the Trail Blazers succumbed in four games. In O'Neal's first season, he appeared in a total of 45 games in the regular season, averaging 4.1 points and 2.8 rebounds per game. For the most part, however, he came off the bench and only averaged 10.2 minutes a game. O'Neal doubted for a while if <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>made</b> <b>the</b> right decision to skip college—he watched with envy as good friend and fellow prep-to-pro draftee Kobe Bryant was enjoying a good rookie season—but he remained confident that the best had yet to come.|$|E
25|$|His {{hold on the}} Danish throne presumably stable, Cnut {{was back}} in England in 1020.

The banishment of Thorkell the Tall in 1021 {{may be seen in}} relation to the attack on the Wends. With the death of Olof Skötkonung in 1022, and the succession to the Swedish throne of his son Anund Jacob bringing Sweden into alliance with Norway, there was cause for a demonstration of Danish strength in the Baltic. Jomsborg, the legendary stronghold of the Jomsvikings (thought to be on an island off the coast of Pomerania), was probably the target of Cnut's expedition. Successful, after this clear display of Cnut's intentions to dominate Scandinavian affairs, it seems that Thorkell reconciled with Cnut in 1023.|$|E
25|$|Von Däniken {{put forward}} {{photographs}} of ancient stones in Peru, with carvings of men using telescopes, detailed world maps, and advanced medical operations, all beyond {{the knowledge of}} ancient Peruvians. But the PBS television series Nova determined that the stones were modern, and located the potter who made them. This potter makes stones daily and sells them to tourists. Von Däniken had visited the potter and examined the stones himself, but he didn't mention this in his book. He says that he didn't believe the potter {{when he said that}} <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>made</b> <b>the</b> stones. Von Däniken says that he asked Doctor Cabrera, a local surgeon who owns the museum, and Cabrera had told him that the potter's claims were a lie and that the stones were ancient. But the potter had proof that Cabrera had thanked him for providing the stones for the museum. Von Däniken claimed that the stones at the museum were very different from those made by the potter, but the Nova reporters oversaw the manufacturing of one stone and confirmed that it was very similar to those in the museum.|$|E

25|$|Riazuddin {{was born}} in Ludhiana in British Punjab of British Indian Empire in 1930 to a {{respected}} middle-class family. After the partition, the family migrated to Pakistan in 1947 and settled in Lahore, West-Pakistan. At age 17, Riazuddin attended Punjab University, and took his B.Sc.(Hons) in Mathematics under the contemporary supervision of Abdus Salam in 1951. Riazuddin is the only student who has privileged to study Physics and Mathematics {{under the supervision of}} Abdus Salam at the Undergraduate level in Punjab University and at the Postgraduate level at the Cambridge University. As student of mathematics, he learned the advanced course on quantum mechanics under Abdus Salam, as <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>made</b> <b>the</b> course of quantum mechanics outside the regular curriculum. In 1951, Salam funded his scholarship, and helped him admitted at the graduate school of the Punjab University. In 1953, Abdus Salam supervised his M.Sc. in Applied Mathematics where his master's dissertation dealt with fundamental concepts of Mathematical physics. By the time, he published his thesis in 1953, it had gained him a national reputation and received a Gold medal from the Punjab University for the post-graduate contributions to physics and mathematics.|$|E
25|$|The last {{decades of}} Spencer's life were characterised by growing disillusionment and loneliness. He never married, and after 1855 was a {{perpetual}} hypochondriac who complained endlessly of pains and maladies that no physician could diagnose. By the 1890s his readership {{had begun to}} desert him while many of his closest friends died and {{he had come to}} doubt the confident faith in progress that <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>made</b> <b>the</b> center-piece of his philosophical system. His later years were also ones in which his political views became increasingly conservative. Whereas Social Statics had been the work of a radical democrat who believed in votes for women (and even for children) and in the nationalisation of the land to break the power of the aristocracy, by the 1880s he had become a staunch opponent of female suffrage and made common cause with the landowners of the Liberty and Property Defence League against what they saw as the drift towards 'socialism' of elements (such as Sir William Harcourt) within the administration of William Ewart Gladstone – largely against the opinions of Gladstone himself. Spencer's political views from this period were expressed in what has become his most famous work, The Man versus the state.|$|E
25|$|Rosenthal claimed <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>made</b> <b>the</b> {{investments}} under {{a long-term}} plan, {{and did not}} intend to sell them until they appreciated in value. Two of the hotels sold in 1970 for about $7million, and their estimated worth in 1986 was $50million. In July 1984, after a hearing panel of the State Bar Court, after 80 days of testimony and consideration of documentary evidence, the panel accused Rosenthal of 13 separate acts of misconduct and urged his disbarment in a 34-page unsigned opinion. The State Bar Court's review department upheld the panel's findings, which asked the justices to order Rosenthal's disbarment. He continued representing clients in federal courts until the U.S. Supreme Court ruled against him on March 21, 1988. Disbarment by the Ninth U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals followed on August 19, 1988. The Supreme Court of California, in affirming the disbarment, held that Rosenthal had engaged in transactions involving undisclosed conflicts of interest, took positions adverse to his former clients, overstated expenses, double-billed for legal fees, failed to return client files, failed to provide access to records, failed to give adequate legal advice, failed to provide clients with an opportunity to obtain independent counsel, filed fraudulent claims, gave false testimony, engaged in conduct designed to harass his clients, delayed court proceedings, obstructed justice and abused legal process. Rosenthal died August 15, 2007, at the age of 96.|$|E
