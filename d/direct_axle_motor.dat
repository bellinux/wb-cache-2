50|$|From 1924, trams made up {{of three}} tramcars were {{operated}} during rush hours for reasons of cost. In subsequent years, the SSB continued to incur no significant outgoings. Apart from the two extensions to Brückfeld and Wankdorf stadium, which operated only on special occasions, the main work the company performed on its tracks was maintenance work. As a search for cheap second hand tramcars in Germany, where the hyperinflation of 1923 had driven a number of tram operators into bankruptcy, did not produce the desired result, the company had to keep the 1901/02 vintage two <b>axle</b> <b>motor</b> tramcars in service by replacing the car bodies that had become rotten. Additionally, the Maximum motor tramcars were fitted with more powerful engines; the SSB thus hoped to extend their service life by 15 to 20 years. However, {{it was not possible}} to install track brakes in these cars, which is why they continued to operate mostly on line 3/4. From 1928, pantographs replaced the bow collectors with which the SSB tramcars had previously been fitted.|$|R
40|$|The thesis {{has been}} {{completely}} developed at Center for Automotive Re- search (CAR), The Ohio State University. The work {{has been focused on}} modeling and sizing an Electro-Hydraulic Brake system (EHB) for a hy- brid electric SUV equipped with <b>axle</b> <b>motors.</b> Within the target of this study, an optimal regenerative braking strategy which utilizes a two-level split of braking action has been investigated. The braking torque is ﬁrst distributed to front and rear axles in order to track the ideal brake force distribution factor. Then, the regenerative braking strategy optimally splits the torque between friction brakes and electric motors with the aim of max- imizing energy recuperation. The regenerative braking strategy is applied to the hybrid SUV vehicle simulator developed at CAR. Simulation results show the eﬀectiveness of the control strategy for diﬀerent braking maneu- vers. Finally, a comparative simulation study has been performed to assess the performance of the strategy proposed against other two braking strate- gies for three diﬀerent driving cycles: urban (FUDS), highway (FHDS) and aggressive (SMTP) ...|$|R
5000|$|The EMC E1 was {{an early}} passenger-train diesel {{locomotive}} developing 1,800 hp, with an A1A-A1A wheel arrangement, and manufactured by Electro-Motive Corporation of La Grange, Illinois. They were built during 1937 and 1938 for the Atchison, Topeka and Santa Fe Railway {{for a new generation}} of diesel-powered streamlined trains. 8 cab-equipped lead A units and three cabless booster B units were built. The initial three locomotives were AB pairs built to haul the Santa Fe's Super Chief diesel streamliners, while the others were built as single A units to haul shorter trains. The locomotives were diesel-electrics with two [...] Winton 201-A engines each, with each engine driving its own generator to power the traction motors. The E1 was the second model in a long line of passenger diesels of similar design known as EMD E-units. All Winton 201A-engined Santa Fe passenger units, including the E1s, were extensively rebuilt into the 80-class E8M engines in 1952-53. These were similar to production E8 models, but derated to 2000 hp so as not to burn out the early traction (<b>axle)</b> <b>motors</b> (which were reused).|$|R

40|$|In {{conventional}} steering system, a feedback torque {{is produced}} from the contact between tire and road surface and its flows through mechanical column shaft directly to driver. This allows {{the driver to}} sense the steering feel during driving. However, in steer by wire (SBW) system, {{the elimination of the}} mechanical column shaft requires the system to generate the feedback torque which should produce similar performance with conventional steering system. Therefore, this paper proposes a control algorithm to create the force feedback torque for SBW system. The direct current measurement approach is used to estimate torque at the steering wheel and front <b>axle</b> <b>motor</b> as elements to the feedback torque, while, adding the compensation torque for a realistic feedback torque. The gain scheduling with a linear quadratic regulator controller is used to control the feedback torque and to vary a steering feel gain. To investigate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm, a real-time hardware in the loop (HIL) methodology is developed using Matlab XPC target toolbox. The results show that the proposed algorithm is able to generate the feedback torque similar to EPS steering system. Furthermore, the compensation torque is able to improve the steering feel and stabilize the system...|$|R
40|$|Timber {{transport}} in {{the forest}} {{is a very complex}} operation, and expensive from an energy point of view. Furthermore, in some cases, this operation can be very difficult and dangerous in unfavorable conditions of the road surface, which mainly occur in winter (frozen ground) and in spring (muddy ground). The goal {{of this study was to}} develop an innovative transmission hydraulic control system for trailer <b>motor</b> <b>axle</b> that would allow correlating the forward speed of the trailer with that of the tractor, which is not necessarily always the same. In detail, the innovative <b>motor</b> <b>axle</b> of the trailer is driven by a hydraulic motor through a pump controlled electronically. A specific software is able to correlate the forward speed of the trailer with the speed of the tractor in any operating situation, thanks to the information given by a potentiometer screwed behind to the trailer component coupled to the tractor. The innovative system developed to control the trailer <b>motor</b> <b>axle</b> provides the possibility to use the trailer with any type of tractor, not requiring long and complex adjustment of tractor and trailer, since it is completely independent from the type of the tractor used...|$|R
