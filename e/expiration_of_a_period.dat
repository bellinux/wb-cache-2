40|$|This article proposes the {{preliminary}} judgment {{as a means}} for facilitating the settlement <b>of</b> legal disputes. <b>A</b> preliminary judgment is simply a tentative judicial assessment of the merits <b>of</b> <b>a</b> case or any part <b>of</b> <b>a</b> case, based on the same sorts of information that the courts already consider on motions for summary judgment. The difference between a preliminary judgment and a summary judgment is that the court, in a preliminary judgment, would not be limited to deciding issues with which no reasonable jury could disagree. Instead, the court would provide its own judgment on the merits of the case based on the information provided by the parties. A preliminary judgment, once given, would convert into a final judgment after the <b>expiration</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> reasonable <b>period</b> <b>of</b> time. However, the losing party would have the right to object prior the <b>expiration</b> <b>of</b> the period (with or without explanation), in which case the judgment would be vacated and the case would proceed according to ordinary rules of procedure. Preliminary judgments could increase prospects of success in settlement bargaining by providing litigants with <b>a</b> credible evaluation <b>of</b> case value [...] offsetting settlement-defeating party optimism, anchoring the parties’ discussions on realistic outcomes, encouraging productive bargaining, focusing attention on basic strategic questions, counteracting the danger that attorneys will distort settlements, and enhancing the willingness of litigants to accept the outcome. Because preliminary judgments would be announced publicly, moreover, they would provide information to guide future conduct by third parties. In point of fact, judges already communicate their provisional views on the merits through <b>a</b> variety <b>of</b> pretrial procedures.

40|$|Polish {{penal law}} {{provides}} pledge and surveillance of social institutions, organizations and. collective groups under which defendant or the sentenced person: works, receives an education or {{is in the}} military service. These measures can be <b>of</b> <b>a</b> litigious or probational character. The litigious pledge is a preventive means aiming at securing {{the appearance of the}} defendant at summons before the organs conducting the proceedings and preventing his obstruction <b>of</b> <b>a</b> process. It cannot be geared on resocializing the defendant as there is <b>a</b> principle <b>of</b> presumption of the accused's innocence hold valid in the penal proceedings, as long as <b>a</b> perpetration <b>of</b> <b>a</b> crime is not established in the final judgement starting upon <b>a</b> resocialization <b>of</b> the defendant will be untimely. The pledge as a probational means is aimed, on the other hand, at the resocialization. The litigious pledge is applied in the course of proceedings and for its duration unless it was limited to <b>a</b> certain stage <b>of</b> <b>a</b> process. It is terminated, at the latest by the final completion of proceedings while the pledge as a probational means is ruled at the conditional discontinuance of proceedings, conditional suspension of the enforcement of punishment and release on licence, it is undertaken for the time <b>of</b> testing <b>a</b> favorable behavior <b>of</b> perpetrator <b>of</b> <b>a</b> crime. A social organization, institution or a collective body which are undertaking a pledge have to appoint a person to perform the duties <b>of</b> <b>a</b> pledger directly. Surveillance is in principle a probational means. It can be applied as the litigious means of prevention only by the way <b>of</b> <b>an</b> exception, in case of stay <b>of</b> execution <b>of</b> <b>a</b> judgement pertinent to an extraordinary appeal against a valid judgement or a motion for instituting a trial de novo. A difference between the pledge and surveillance is not clear. The pledge is not limited itself to standing surety for the accused or the sentenced. It is related, as in the instance of the suryeillance, to the duties to control <b>a</b> conduct <b>of</b> the pledgee. Yet, the duties of surveilling person are regulated in a wider scope and more precisely. Theoreticians are advancing a proposition that a pledge is more flexible and less binding form of control. The pledge and surveillance are terminated upon the <b>expiration</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> probation <b>period,</b> earlier m the case <b>of</b> releasing <b>a</b> pledger from his duties and also in the instance <b>of</b> <b>a</b> final ruling <b>of</b> the enforcement of punishment or recalling a release on licence. The pledge expires also upon the reopening of conditionally discontinued proceedings. The social pledge — litigious and probational — is not often used in practice and so is the social surveillance performed by the social institutions and collective groups. Surveillance by court appointed curators (mostly social ones) is dominating.

40|$|In {{considering}} {{the relation of}} circulatory factors to the hemo-respiratory incompetence of emphysema, attention has usually been focused on possible defects in the pulmonary circulation. Less {{attention has been paid}} to factors which hinder the return flow of venous blood. Consideration of all the evidence does not seem to justify this emphasis, and the increased intrapleural pressure which has been observed in functional emphysema indicates that the difficulty may arise from changed intrathoracic pressure quite as much as from changes in the lungs themselves. Evidence from experimental data and inferences from <b>a</b> consideration <b>of</b> the pathology of emphysema support the assumption that when there is obstructed expiration the obvious circulatory impairment is due to change in the lesser circulation. Pathologists agree that there is a diminution in the capillary bed in the lungs in emphysema, a fact which has led to the belief that there must be increased resistance to blood flow through the organ. Friedman and Jackson (1) partially obstructed expiration in dogs and found an increase in the carbon dioxide content of the alveolar air and in the blood. They attributed their results to interference of blood flow through the pulmonary capillaries, a condition supposedly resulting because the intrabronchial pressure was greater than the capillary pressure during the expiratory phase. Heinbecker (2) demonstrated that with inflation of the excised lungs <b>of</b> <b>a</b> cat by positive pressure he could decrease the flow of perfused blood. Lichtheim (3) has shown that the pulmonary capillary bed can be greatly diminished by ligation of the pulmonary artery of one lung with no change in the pul-monary blood pressure. Kountz, Alexander and Dowell (4) studied the effect of partial ob-struction <b>of</b> the <b>expiration</b> <b>of</b> dogs over <b>a</b> <b>period</b> <b>of</b> weeks.
