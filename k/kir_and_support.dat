Genotype frequency indicated that the most frequently found gene content was eight genes in controls and 14 in patients (P< 0. 05). The KIR genotype analysis revealed that patient <b>and,</b> surprisingly, control <b>KIR</b> genotypes preferentially consisted of type B haplotypes characterized {{by the presence of}} multiple-activating KIRs. Evidence was also provided that the same KIR genotype was shared by a variable number of patients. Interestingly, the recurrent genotypes observed in the patient group were not found in controls. Concerning inhibitory genes, KIR 2 DL 5 a and 2 DL 5 b were more frequently detected in patients than in controls (P< 0. 01), likely representing a discrete feature of the genetic repertoire of the patients. KIR gene repertoire analysis in patients suggests that the susceptibility to NK-LDGL might be related to the presence of activating <b>KIR</b> genes <b>and</b> <b>supports</b> the concept that these receptors may be involved in the priming of granular lymphocytes (GL) proliferation.

We show that CO blocks <b>Kir</b> 2. 2 <b>and</b> <b>Kir</b> 2. 3 but not Kir 2. 1 channels in both cardiomyocytes and HEK- 293 cells transfected with Kir. CO directly inhibits Kir 2. 3 by interfering with its interaction with the second messenger phosphatidylinositol (4, 5) -bisphosphate (PIP 2). As the inhibition of <b>Kir</b> 2. 2 <b>and</b> <b>Kir</b> 2. 3 by CO prolongs APD in myocytes, cardiac <b>Kir</b> 2. 2 <b>and</b> <b>Kir</b> 2. 3 are promising targets for the prevention of reperfusion-induced VF...|$|R
40|$|Anthrax lethal toxin (LeTx) is a {{virulence}} {{factor of}} Bacilillus anthracis {{that is a}} bivalent toxin, containing lethal factor (LF) and protective Ag proteins, which causes cytotoxicity and altered macrophage function. LeTx exposure results in early K(+) efflux from macrophages associated with caspase- 1 activation and increased IL- 1 β release. The mechanism of this toxin-induced K(+) efflux is unknown. The goals {{of the current study}} were to determine whether LeTx-induced K(+) efflux from macrophages is mediated by toxin effects on specific K(+) channels and whether altered K(+) -channel activity is involved in LeTx-induced IL- 1 β release. Exposure of macrophages to LeTx induced {{a significant increase in the}} activities of two types of K(+) channels that have been identified in mouse macrophages: Ba(2 +) -sensitive inwardly rectifying K(+) (<b>Kir)</b> channels <b>and</b> 4 -aminopyridine-sensitive outwardly rectifying voltage-gated K(+) (Kv) channels. LeTx enhancement of both <b>Kir</b> <b>and</b> Kv required the proteolytic activity of LF, because exposure of macrophages to a mutant LF-protein (LF(E 687 C)) combined with protective Ag protein had no effect on the currents. Furthermore, blocking <b>Kir</b> <b>and</b> Kv channels significantly decreased LeTx-induced release of IL- 1 β. In addition, retroviral transduction of macrophages with wild-type Kir enhanced LeTx-induced release of IL- 1 β, whereas transduction of dominant-negative Kir blocked LeTx-induced release of IL- 1 β. Activation of caspase- 1 was not required for LeTx-induced activation of either of the K(+) channels. These data indicate that a major mechanism through which LeTx stimulates macrophages to release IL- 1 β involves an LF-protease effect that enhances <b>Kir</b> <b>and</b> Kv channel function during toxin stimulation...|$|R

40|$|Abstract Background Human killer immunoglobulin-like receptors (KIRs) play a {{critical}} role in governing the immune response to neoplastic and infectious disease. Rhesus macaques serve as important animal models for many human diseases in which KIRs are implicated; however, the study of KIR activity in this model is hindered by incomplete characterization of KIR genetics. Results Here we present a characterization of KIR genetics in rhesus macaques (Macaca mulatta). We conducted a survey of KIRs in this species, identifying 47 novel full-length KIR sequences. Using this expanded sequence library to build upon previous work, we present evidence supporting the existence of 22 Mamu-KIR genes, providing a framework within which to describe macaque KIRs. We also developed a novel pyrosequencing-based technique for KIR genotyping. This method provides both comprehensive <b>KIR</b> genotype <b>and</b> frequency estimates of transcript level, with implications for the study of KIRs in all species. Conclusions The results of this study significantly improve our understanding of macaque <b>KIR</b> genetic organization <b>and</b> diversity, with implications for the study of many human diseases that use macaques as a model. The ability to obtain comprehensive KIR genotypes is of basic importance for the study of <b>KIRs,</b> <b>and</b> can easily be adapted to other species. Together these findings both advance the field of macaque <b>KIRs</b> <b>and</b> facilitate future research into the role of KIRs in human disease. </p...|$|R
