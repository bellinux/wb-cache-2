The town began as part of a land development project organized in 1906 by W. C. Johnson and George P. Pugh, experienced developers from Danville, Illinois. The town was originally called Church because it was located just north of the Church siding on the St. Louis, Brownsville and Mexico Railway, which built through the area in 1906. The town site was laid out in November and December 1906, and by February 1907 Johnson and Pugh had completed the town's first structure, a wooden hotel built to house prospective land buyers. ("This is the Real Garden of the Lord," [...] a large sign painted {{on the side of the}} hotel advised visitors.) A post office was established in the hotel later that year, and the town's name was changed to Woodsboro after Captain Tobias D. Wood, who had sold the Bonnie View Ranch to the developers. The surrounding farmlands were praised in advertisements distributed across Texas and midwestern states, and a number of settlers began to move into the area. By 1908,when Woodsboro was officially platted, a school had been established, and the town already had grown to include about twenty-five buildings, including the hotel, a cotton gin, a lumberyard, and a number of dwellings. Other stores and a Masonic temple were quickly added, and in 1910 the town's first newspaper, the Woodsboro Hustler, began publication. The Bank of Refugio opened a branch in Woodsboro in 1912, and in 1913 a contract was awarded to <b>install</b> <b>electrical</b> <b>power</b> and lights in the community. By 1914 there were about 500 people living in Woodsboro. The Commercial Club, a group of local businessmen organized soon after the town's creation, actively worked to improve the community. The club organized the town's first water works, which were turned over to the local government when Woodsboro incorporated in 1928.|$|R

Three types of insulator topology are employed, single units, suspension-type and tension-type. These un-energized insulators are allowed to be exposed to 3 - 4 months duration of sea salts contamination. Equivalent salt deposit density (ESDD) measurement is conducted to measure insulator's contamination level. It was found that salt accumulation on suspension type insulator is much heavier than the tension type. Also the direction of inward coming winds has some influence on the salt deposition to the insulator surfaces. Experiments showed that ESDD increases linearly with an increase in time of exposure.

40|$|In {{order to}} assess the energy {{efficiency}} of an indoor lighting installation, a criterion for the <b>installed</b> <b>electrical</b> <b>power</b> is proposed which is broadly applicable and easy to use. Introducing target values for lamps and gear and taking into account some basic lighting comfort requirements, the maximum electrical power to be installed can be predicted {{for any kind of}} application. Herewith, one or more task areas with appropriate target illuminance values may be defined. The key parameter of the criterion is the analytical expression for the target utilance as a function of common lighting design parameters. Two practical examples illustrate the validity of the criterion. In a first example, a general case where the task area is coincident with a reference plane parallel with the floor has been studied. The values obtained converge to actual target values in current practice. In a second example, the lighting design of a store with many vertical task areas is explained. These cases illustrate the advantages of the criterion as compared to energy evaluation criteria based on the normalized power density.

40|$|The {{renewable}} energy law (EEG) and the waste wood regulation will influence the energetic use of wood, especially of waste wood. It is foreseeable that from 2000 to 2004 in Germany the electrical energy generated by biomass will triple. The EEG guarantees the reimbursement for electricity generated from biomass in Germany. In the biomass regulation those biomasses are more clearly defined {{to which the}} purchase and reimbursement obligation of the grid operator relate. Since 3 / 1 / 2003 the waste wood regulation offers over and above these fundamentals a deposition for waste wood. This compels the bodies responsible for safe disposal and the disposer of wastes for waste wood to open up new disposal avenues. Up to now biogenic fuels (biomass) in Germany have accounted for {{only a small fraction}} of total energy generation. Financial incentives have strongly increased the use ofbiogenic fuels.

A high/dual-voltage electrical system is necessary to meet these requirements. A new alternator system which substantially improves the present Lundell alternator design is proposed. This new system can double the output power and greatly improve efficiency without the need to rewind the machine. Inherent load-dump transient suppression and jump-start charging features are also achieved. The attributes of this novel system have been experimentally demonstrated. The main goal of this thesis is to investigate and develop analytical system and subsystem models for dual/high-voltage automotive electrical systems. Detailed time-domain and simplified averaged models for synchronous machines and three-phase rectifiers with constant-voltage loads are developed. A load-matching technique based on a switched-mode rectifier is introduced and used in conjunction with the developed machine/rectifier models to design the new high-power, highefficiency alternator system. Analytical models for two dual-voltage systems, one based on interleaved dc/dc converters and the other on a dual-stator Lundell alternator, are developed and used to investigate their characteristics. The analytical models for the dc/dc converter system are used in the design of a prototype which experimentally demonstrates the high performance features of the system while verifying the analytical results. A comparison of the characteristics of dual/high-voltage architectures is presented and it is shown that the load-matching technique {{can be used in a}} number of dual-voltage systems to improve performance.

This in addition to the requirement that the average coefficient of thermal transmittance and the <b>installed</b> <b>electrical</b> <b>power,</b> for electrically heated buildings, must be calculated at the design stage. It is, however, often noted that the result of the calculations and measurements differ from each other, and that the measured values ​​often are higher than those calculated. In collaboration with NCC and Mälardalens University, an investigation was made in which the calculated and measured values ​​of energy were examined for a number of apartment buildings, schools and sports halls, to identify causes of difference, and to identify priority areas of work within, above all, energy simulation and energy follow-ups. It turned out that the difference is largely influenced by the type of the building, as it differed between apartment buildings, schools and sports halls. In addition, the amount of window area turned out to have impact on the results, as it allows for more airing, which is a factor that is very difficult to anticipate for the simulations. The windows ability to let in sunlight is another factor that is hard to anticipate. Furthermore, it was discovered that the standard values for the assumed energy consumption for domestic hot water is often too high. In some cases the assumed heated floor area and the assumed outdoor climate data differed between calculations and measurements. It also happens that heat losses from culvert pipes to the ground is not taken into account when calculations are done. As for priority areas of work, judging by the results of this work, better behavior related input data and standard values ​​for, above all, energy consumption for hot water needs to be developed. There has to be more diligence when ensuring that there are same conditions for calculations and measurements, and this could mean that those who perform the calculation may need to be assigned more responsibility over the measuring work. In addition, the follow-up work must be envisaged in the long term, which means that the number of registers should be sufficient to distinguish the different parameters, that consumes energy, apart to make it possible to learn from the over-/underestimation, and base future input and standard values ​​on it. This may mean that the simulation-/measure-work should not be limited only to comply with applicable laws, but it should be ensured that follow-up work can be done {{in such a way that}} it helps to improve the future work of simulations and measurements of energy use in buildings...|$|E

Die Grundlage einer solchen Bewertung bilden detaillierte Kenntnisse des Abrufverhaltens positiver Minutenreserve. Deshalb wird die Inanspruchnahme positiver Minutenreserve untersucht und als stochastischer Prozess modelliert. Auf dieser Basis erfolgen Betrachtungen zur Dimensionierung der Wärmespeicher, zum Netzbetrieb mit hoher Dichte dezentraler Klein-KWK-Anlagen und zur Wirtschaftlichkeit eines solchen Konzeptes. Die abschließende ganzheitliche Betrachtung liefert Hinweise zur optimalen Betriebsweise der Klein-KWK-Anlagen. From the {{technical}} point of view, virtual power plants consisting of small decentralized co-generation plants {{are able to}} provide positive tertiary reserve power for the European electricity transmission grid. For serious analyses, detailed knowledge about the load-characteristic of called reserve power is essentially. In order to examine grid operation, heat storage capacity and optimized power plant operation, the switch-on times of co-generation plants and the co-generated heat during reserve power provision have to be estimated. Aiming this, the called positive tertiary reserve power in Germany is analyzed and a mathematical model of the call-characteristic is synthesized. Furthermore, the results of examining grid operation, optimizing heat storage capacity and power plant operation are given. Calls of positive tertiary reserve power usually occur suddenly, non-scheduled and jumpy. Sometimes, there are single calls. Usually, calls occur clustered, i. e. one call is directly followed by further calls. Positive reserve power is much higher frequented under peak-load conditions than under base-load conditions. The characteristic of calling positive tertiary reserve power deeply depends on the control area. From the mathematical point of view, a Poisson-process fits non-scheduled and jumpy occurring events. Each jump marks a call date of positive tertiary reserve power. The values of the called power fit a logarithmical normal distribution. The lengths of the call-clusters satisfactorily fit a geometrical distribution. The expected value of called reserve energy is modeled dependent {{from the time of}} the day. The model is essential for simulating all combinations of switch-on times of co-generation plants and of co-generated heat volumes that might occur during providing reserve power. Aiming to optimize the installed heat storage capacity, the quote of heat use has to be examined. From both technical and ecological point of view, installing large heat storages is desirable in order to use all co-generated heat. From the economical point of view, installing any heat storage is not sensible. The solution of this trade-off is installing a heat storage that guarantees less or equal CO 2 -emissions than a conventional power plant fired with natural gas. The results of this thesis lead to 1 kWh heat storage capacity per 1 kW <b>installed</b> <b>electrical</b> <b>power</b> as rule of thumb. Concerning grid operation in steady state, a much higher density of co-generation plants than expected is technically installable. A general rule for extending the installable decentralized power cannot be deducted. Examining economics, decentalized co-genertation plants are desired to provide balancing power during their stand-by times. Building a virtual power plant only in order to provide reserve power is not economically sensible. From the power plant owners' view, providing positive tertiary reserve power by small decentralized co-generation plants is generally sustainable...|$|E
