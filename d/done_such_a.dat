25|$|In 1925, Thurber {{moved to}} Greenwich Village in New York City, {{getting a job}} as a {{reporter}} for the New York Evening Post. He joined the staff of The New Yorker in 1927 as an editor, with the help of E.B. White, his friend and fellow New Yorker contributor. His career as a cartoonist began in 1930 after White found some of Thurber's drawings in a trash can and submitted them for publication; White inked-in some of these earlier drawings to make them reproduce better for the magazine, and years later expressed deep regret that he had <b>done</b> <b>such</b> <b>a</b> thing. Thurber contributed both his writings and his drawings to The New Yorker until the 1950s.|$|E
25|$|Included in that haul {{was one of}} {{the most}} famous caughts-and-bowled ever taken. Ulyett sent down a {{straight}} half-volley to Bonnor, who drove at it with all his considerable might and got it right out of the middle of the bat. The ball flew back towards the bowler with a resounding crack. It seemed to Ulyett barely to have left his hand—yet already it was flying back to him at what seemed like the speed of light. He had no time to judge it but held out the right hand instinctively, and the leather stuck, right in the middle of his palm. With the sound of Bonnor's stroke still echoing about the ground, many eyes in the gallery were looking for the area near the boundary where they thought that the ball would land. The eyes of George Giffen, the non-striker, were among the wanderers, and he was certain that everyone else must be looking for it, too: indeed, a segment of the crowd, in panic, had even opened up a space in the ring in anticipation of the ball’s descent. Giffen reckoned it to have been a very mighty drive indeed—but he could not see where it had gone. When, finally, his and other eyes were diverted back towards the pitch, they noticed Ulyett celebrating and Bonnor was departing. It soon dawned on them that Ulyett had taken the catch. Although Ulyett felt no pain in the centre of his hand, there was definitely a fair amount of it on the outside. Bonnor looked at him disgustedly, thinking it almost immoral to have <b>done</b> <b>such</b> <b>a</b> thing, and he walked off gloomily. The England players gathered around Ulyett in wonderment. They seemed to the Wisden correspondent to be curious as to what kind of man this was—although they were also keen to congratulate him on his evasion of impending danger. The looks on the faces of Allan Steel and Alfred Lyttelton would stay with Wisdens man for a long time. WG Grace and Lord Harris both told Ulyett that he was foolish to have attempted to take the catch: had it hit his wrist or arm instead, that bone would surely have snapped. Giffen believed that this {{was one of the}} finest catches that he had ever seen, and, although on the team which it had adversely affected, he definitely appreciated it.|$|E

500|$|In {{order to}} prove his innocence to Veronica, Troy says that he left his name and number in Stacy's room, arguing that a rapist would not have <b>done</b> <b>such</b> <b>a</b> thing. Veronica checks Stacy's room and finds Troy's name half-erased. Stacy {{receives}} a box of someone else's hair outside her door, and Veronica deduces that there have probably been other victims of the rapist, so she goes {{looking for someone who}} bought a wig recently, finding no one. Dean informs Veronica that the fraternity has a contest about how many girls they have had sex with, and the recruit with the lowest number of [...] "points" [...] is punished by being forced to shave his head. Veronica tracks down Stacy's rape to someone named [...] "Ice Man." [...] She barges into the fraternity's basement, where she is stopped by two members.|$|E
500|$|In {{the summer}} of 2015, Garland participated in The Basketball Tournament (TBT), a five-on-five, single-elimination {{basketball}} tournament in which the winner out of the 96 teams wins a total of $1 million. He competed for a team made up of former La Salle men's basketball players, called 20th & Olney, reuniting with Ramon Galloway, Steve Zack, and Tyreek Duren. Explorers video coordinator Andrew McGlynn, who acted as the team's general manager and coach, said, [...] "The main reason [...] is how close the program is here. [...] has <b>done</b> <b>such</b> <b>a</b> good job of making it a family atmosphere around here". Garland was one of 50 players with NBL Canada experience that were playing in TBT. On July 18, 2015 at Philadelphia University, he debuted with 22 points in a win over Max's All Stars, {{a team led by}} Dominique Jones. 20th & Olney lost in the next round to Boeheim's Army, which was led by Hakim Warrick and Olu Famutimi, as Garland notched 21 points.|$|E

[...] The cover was named in Pitchfork Media's top 25 worst album covers of 2006.

2500|$|In 2009, Friday Night with Jonathan Ross was {{nominated}} for a BAFTA. According to The Times, Ross {{was nominated}} soon after he was banned. Melody Sachs complained about Ross being nominated so soon after the controversy in an interview with The Daily Telegraph, saying: [...] "I am amazed that Ross should get rewarded with a mouth like his. Nobody is saying he hasn't got talent, but what he did was so disgusting. Of course he is not worth the money, but he is good at his job. However, I don't think he should be rewarded so soon after what happened. It is like people are saying, 'Let's forget all about it and see what we can give him.'

2500|$|Meanwhile, {{in the gap}} itself, Cleburne was {{deploying}} his {{division in}} the face of the oncoming Federals. With barely 4,000 men and only two cannon to hold off Joseph Hooker's 16,000 attacking troops, Cleburne deployed his division across both sides of the narrow pass, ordering them to conceal themselves from view and wait for his signal to spring their ambush. He had barely half an hour to wait, as the 33rd and their friends steadily backed into the gap; Matthews reports that his comrades from the other regiments had <b>done</b> <b>such</b> <b>a</b> good job of concealing themselves that he and his friends never noticed them until they had passed their positions. The 33rd was ordered to take its place with the rest of their brigade in the center of its line atop White Oak Ridge, on the pass's northern side. They arrived just in time; one witness of the battle would later say: [...] "two minutes [...] would have been too late." ...|$|E
2500|$|Back at Dodger Stadium, the {{scoreless}} streak reached 35 innings (tying a Los Angeles Dodgers {{record set}} in 1962) before they finally scored {{a run in}} the fifth inning on an RBI double by Andre Ethier. Greinke allowed only one run on six hits in 7 innings but {{was out of the}} game when Joc Pederson hit the tie-breaking solo homer in the eighth inning to give the Dodgers a 2–1 victory over the San Diego Padres. On May 23, Mike Bolsinger allowed a lead off single to open the game and then retired the next 23 batters he faced, shutting down the Padres offense over eight innings. Closer Kenley Jansen retired the side in order in the ninth. The two of them combined to face the minimum 27 batters in the game, the first time the Dodgers had <b>done</b> <b>such</b> <b>a</b> feat since Odalis Pérez pitched a one-hitter against the Cubs on April 26, 2002. Pederson homered again, leading off the bottom of the first, and the Dodgers won 2–0. Carlos Frias had a poor outing the following day, tying a L.A. Dodger record by allowing 10 earned runs in only four innings in a game eventually won by the Padres 11–3. The Dodgers hit three home runs in the eighth inning on Memorial Day to break open a tied game and defeat the Atlanta Braves 6–3. Kershaw struck out 10 in seven scoreless innings the following day and the Dodgers scored six runs in the fourth inning off Julio Teherán as they rolled to an 8–0 victory. Adrian Gonzalez two-run home run that inning accounted for the 1,000th and 1,001st RBI of his career. Zack Greinke allowed only one run on ...|$|E
2500|$|Justice O'Connor, {{presenting}} the (4-5) dissenting opinion, {{stated that the}} historical evidence was not uniform in rejecting Atwater's proposed rule and reasoned that the Fourth Amendment required a balancing of interests {{in the case of}} an arrest for a fine-only misdemeanor. [...] The court dissent in Atwater precluded the sole use of probable cause in Whren v. United States, , where the Court had held that, on balance, it was reasonable to allow the police to make a traffic stop whenever they spied a violation of the traffic laws, although a traffic stop was a seizure. But, because of the length of the typical traffic stop and the fact that most drivers are free to go after it is <b>done,</b> <b>such</b> <b>a</b> seizure was commensurate with the magnitude of the violation and sufficient to ensure that the offender would appear later in court if necessary. [...] The dissent elucidated, “probable cause” and “extraordinary” circumstances as delineated in Terry v. Ohio, Whren v. United States, etc., have also proved less than problematic. [...] Strong argument to the contrary also remains as to the merit of the majority opinion that “personal § 1983 liability for the misapplication of a constitutional standard…would guarantee increased litigation.” In Atwater, the dissent further argued that Atwater could not have been characterized as a possible flight risk by the arresting officer, since she was known to him and was an established member of the community and that respondents failed to substantiate any demonstrable merit for the arrest decision. They further noted that arrest for a fine-only misdemeanor was not reasonable because sending someone to jail for up to 48 hours (the time necessary to get him or her before a magistrate to be released) was too great an intrusion upon the personal liberty interests of anyone who had committed a relatively minor offense as would only merit such a fine as punishment.|$|E
