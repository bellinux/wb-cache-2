During the {{ablation}} season, the ice cap Vatnajökull (8100 km 2) develops its own microclimate that {{we describe}} by meteorological data {{collected during the}} summers of 1994 – 2003. Persistent <b>glacier</b> <b>winds</b> are generated down the melting ice cap, whose variations in speed can be related empirically to the temperature fluctuations of the lowland environs of the ice cap. This suggests that climate warming would be accompanied by stronger <b>glacier</b> <b>winds</b> down the outlets of Vatnajökull, producing stronger turbulent fluxes that might amplify the melting rates in the lower ablation areas. 1...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. During {{the summer}} of 1994, a {{meteorological}} experiment (PASTEX) was performed over the Pasterze Glacier, Austria. In this paper we describe the average horizontal and vertical structure of the atmospheric boundary layer (ABL) above the melting glacier, {{as well as its}} diurnal variation during a period of fair weather. It was found that very persistent glacier winds with a vertical extent of 100 m dominate the summertime structure of the ABL, because the gravity force acting on the near surface air parcels is many times larger than the synoptic-scale pressure gradient. During fair weather, we find a well developed mountain-valley wind circulation above the katabatic layer. During daytime, the valley wind advects warm and humid air from the ice-free valley towards the glacier, limiting the development of the <b>glacier</b> <b>wind.</b> During the night, the downslope flows that develop above the ice-free valley walls (mountain wind) merge with the <b>glacier</b> <b>wind</b> and enhance the downslope transport of air. The associated subsidence is the most probable cause for the drying of {{the lower part of the}} atmosphere during the night. During periods of weak synoptic winds, the <b>glacier</b> <b>wind</b> effectively generates turbulence in the strongly stratified surface layer. On average, the turbulent fluxes of sensible and latent heat provide 25 % of the total melting energy at the surface of the glacier tongue, and the influence of the glacier winds on the surface energy budget can therefore not be neglected. 1...|$|E

40|$|In {{the summer}} of 1994, {{meteorological}} measurements were performed on Pasterze Glacier in the eastern Alps. One {{of the most remarkable}} observations concerning the observed climate was the persistent <b>glacier</b> <b>wind.</b> On the relatively large glacier, which has a length of 9. 6 km, the gravity wind at the lower parts of the glacier is well developed and has a thickness of about 100 m. To determine the mechanisms that cause the steady-state <b>glacier</b> <b>wind,</b> the author calculated its vertically integrated budgets of momentum, heat, and moisture at a spot on the lower glacier tongue. It was found that the sum of interfacial and surface friction account for only half of the momentum dissipation of the glacier wind; the rest of the katabatic force is most probably balanced by the mesoscale pressure gradient that drives the valley wind above the katabatic layer. The heat and moisture budgets of the boundary layer show simple two-term balances: heat is lost through the turbulent flux of sensible heat at the surface (on average 50 W m 2) and gained by the downward transport of air. Moisture is added to the katabatic layer by entrainment and lost through condensation at the surface, but on average the moisture fluxes are small. The entrainment velocity, averaged over the length of the glacier, was estimated to be 2. 4 cm s 1; it reduces to 0. 7 cm s 1 at the glacier tongue, which was estimated by closing the local moisture budget. 1...|$|E

This is true even for flows with very different heights and strengths of the jet. A theoretical estimate of the katabatic jet height, based on temperature deficit and lapse rate, is verified.

40|$|The {{katabatic}} flow over glaciers is {{studied with}} data from automatic weather stations (AWS). We analyse data from the Morteratschgletscher (Switzerland), Vatnajökull (Iceland) and West Greenland, and conclude that katabatic flow is very common over melting glacier surfaces and rarely disrupted by the large-scale flow. Over small and medium-size glaciers {{the height of the}} wind maximum is generally low (typically 10 m), and vertical temperature differences near the surface are very large (up to 15 K over 4 m). In glacier mass-balance models there is a great need for parameterisations of the surface heat flux. We develop a simple method to estimate the sensible heat flux Fh associated with the <b>glacier</b> <b>wind.</b> It is based on the classical Prandtl model for slope flows. We set the turbulent exchange coefficient proportional to the maximum wind speed (velocity scale) and the height of the wind maximum (length scale). The resulting theory shows that Fh increases quadratically with the tem-perature difference between the surface and the ambient atmosphere; Fh decreases with the square root of the potential temperature gradient of the ambient atmosphere; and Fh is independent of the surface slope. 1...|$|E
40|$|The {{presented}} thesis {{deals with}} the flowing of air in the tertiary circulation. We divide tertiary circulation into two categories: local winds and local wind systems. Local wind systems arise from different absorbation of solar radiation of two different surfaces which border together and the phenomena classified in this category are breeze circulation, mountain-valley circulation, country breeze, <b>glacier</b> <b>wind</b> and forrest wind. Local winds arise from local impacts on secondary circulation. Flowing of foehn, flowing of bora, desert wind and mountain gap wind are classified in this category. Then we deal with specific manifestation of winds and with their names. The names of the winds are frequently derivatives {{of the names of}} the localities or cardinal points from which the wind is blowing, of the winds' localities or manifestation of the wind. It is difficult to understand the names. For example, in south Africa they call the foehn "Berg Wind", which means mountain wind, because it is blowing from the direction where the mountain range is situated. Then we have chosen some eminent cases of occurence of the local winds. We have worked out case studies of Föhn in Altdorf, Switzerland (April, 2012), of Bura in the city of Senj, Croatia (November, 2004), of breeze circulation in Vigo, Spain (July, [...] ...|$|E
40|$|Air {{temperature}} {{is one of}} the most relevant input variables for snow and ice melt calculations. However, local meteorological conditions, complex topography, and logistical concerns in glacierized regions make the measuring and modeling of air temperature a difficult task. In this study, we investigate the spatial distribution of 2 [*]m air temperature over mountain glaciers and propose a modification to an existing model to improve its representation. Spatially distributed meteorological data from Haut Glacier d'Arolla (Switzerland), Place (Canada), and Juncal Norte (Chile) Glaciers are used to examine approximate flow line temperatures during their respective ablation seasons. During warm conditions (off-glacier temperatures well above 0 °C), observed air temperatures in the upper reaches of Place Glacier and Haut Glacier d'Arolla decrease down glacier along the approximate flow line. At Juncal Norte and Haut Glacier d'Arolla, an increase in air {{temperature is}} observed over the glacier tongue. While the temperature behavior over the upper part can be explained by the cooling effect of the glacier surface, the temperature increase over the glacier tongue may be caused by several processes induced by the surrounding warm atmosphere. In order to capture the latter effect, we add an additional term to the Greuell and Böhm (GB) thermodynamic <b>glacier</b> <b>wind</b> model. For high off-glacier temperatures, the modified GB model reduces root-mean-square error up to 32 % and provides a new approach for distributing air temperature over mountain glaciers as a function of off-glacier temperatures and approximate glacier flow lines...|$|E
40|$|Five {{winter months}} (April-August 1988) of thermal {{infrared}} satellite images were examined {{to investigate the}} occurrence of dark (warm) signatures across the Ross Ice Shelf in the Antarctic continent. These features are inferred to be generated by katabatic winds that descend from southern Marie Byrd Land and then blow horizontally across the ice shelf. Significant mass is added to this airstream by katabatic winds blowing from the major glaciers that flow through the Transantarctic Mountains from East Antarctica. These negatively buoyant katabatic winds can reach the northwestern edge of the shelf - a horizontal propagation distance of up to 1, 000 km - 14 percent of the time. Where the airstream crosses from the ice shelf to the ice-covered Ross Sea, a prominent coastal polynya is formed. Because the downslope buoyancy force is near zero over the Ross Ice Shelf, the northwestward propagation of the katabatic air mass requires pressure gradient support. The study shows that the extended horizontal propagation of this atmospheric density current occurred {{in conjunction with the}} passage of synoptic cyclones over the southern Amundsen Sea. These cyclones can strengthen the pressure gradient in the interior of West Antarctica and make the pressure field favorable for northwestward movement of the katabatic winds from West Antarctica across the ice shelf in a geostrophic direction. The <b>glacier</b> <b>winds</b> from East Antarctica are further accelerated by the synoptic pressure gradient, usually undergo abrupt adjustment beyond the exit to the glacier valley, and merge into the mountain-parallel katabatic air mass...|$|R

By analyzing data from automatic weather stations situated on the ablation area on the glaciers we investigated the effect of meteorological differences on ablation. There was a difference in micro-climate between Rabots glaciär and Storglaciären. Generally Storglaciären had slightly warmer and drier air, had less or a thinner cloud layer but more precipitation. On both glaciers a <b>glacier</b> <b>wind</b> is dominant but high wind velocities were common especially on Storglaciären indicating a larger influence from the synoptic system. There was a good correlation for temperature and vapor pressure between the glaciers that indicate that both glaciers are strongly affected by the synoptic system. The meteorological parameters have similar effect on the ablation on the glaciers. Temperature, vapor pressure and the turbulent heat fluxes are the only meteorological parameters that suggest a linear affect on ablation. Net shortwave radiation contribute with {{the greatest amount of}} energy for ablation but decreased in relative importance as the temperature increased. Shortwave radiation, sensible and latent heat contributed with a total 184 Wm- 2 on Rabots glaciär and 222 Wm- 2 on Storglaciären.
