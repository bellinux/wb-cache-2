40|$|The aim of {{this paper}} is to explain {{phenomena}} associated with bitumen aging and establish design patterns that contribute to optimizing the aging resistance of <b>bituminous</b> <b>mixes</b> based on the rational addition of calcareous fillers (hydrated lime and limestone filler). The potential benefits of using fillers to improve aging resistance are well-known. However, concepts related to the biphasic filler-bitumen system affecting some of the main characteristics of mixes are not always considered. In this paper, a new study procedure, “Universal de Caracterización de Ligantes” (UCL®), a method for haracterizing both conventional and polymer-modified binders developed at the Technical University of Catalonia, has been applied. In addition, rheological tests have been performed with the dynamic shear rheometer and non-routine procedures such as macromolecular analysis (e. g. gel-permeation chromatography and infrared spectroscopy). These techniques have provided greater insight into the causes and effects of aging based on the changes undergone by the bituminous binder.

40|$|ABSTRACT: In recent years, {{pavement}} rutting {{rate has}} increased significantly due to constant traffic intensity increment. These solicitations affect the bituminous layers that can quickly attain their permanent deformation limit resistance. This phenomenon {{can lead to}} a pavement depression, located in the tyre-road contact surface. The {{purpose of this paper is}} to present a methodology to estimate the rutting of bituminous pavements and to predict the rutting risk considering the <b>bituminous</b> <b>mix</b> rutting resistance characteristics obtained with the LPC traffic simulator, and taking into account the traffic and environmental characteristics. The traffic characteristics are represented by the total heavy traffic expressed in equivalent single axle loads (ESAL) passed on the pavement during the service period, and the heavy vehicles speed on the considered section. The environmental characteristic is represented by the pavement temperature at 2 cm depth. The developed model starts from the widely used empirical rutting formula and its experimentally determined coefficients. The general concept of the model is to start from this generalised rutting formula and to apply it to the real rutting behaviour occurring in pavements. For this purpose, observations and material analysis of eleven in place pavements were made. The model was calibrated using eleven <b>bituminous</b> <b>mixes</b> and verified introducing the characteristics of four in place <b>bituminous</b> <b>mixes</b> not considered in the initial calibration phase. The developed model gives rut depth values after having determined material and site characteristics and presents a good correlation coefficient with very satisfactory results in its verification phase with additional materials...|$|R

An extensive experimental study comprising of monotonic, continuous cyclic and pulse loading tensile experiments for two pure and two polymer-modified bitumens is detailed in chapter 3. Based on these experimental findings a simple constitutive phenomenological model including the effects of rate dependent recovery is proposed for bitumen. Comparisons between experiments and model predictions are presented with good agreement. The spherical indentation behaviour of bitumen under monotonic and cyclic loading conditions is studied in chapter 4. A simple extension to the power-law indentation model of Bower et al.

A precise engineering design may save considerable investment; {{as well as}} reliable performance of the in-service highway can be achieved. Two things are of major considerations in this regard – pavement design and the mix design. Our project emphasizes on the mix design considerations. A good design of <b>bituminous</b> <b>mix</b> is expected {{to result in a}} mix which is adequately strong, durable and resistive to fatigue and permanent deformation {{and at the same time}} environment friendly and economical.

Because of variability of <b>bituminous</b> <b>mix</b> properties due to, on one hand, the acceptance ranges reported in hot mix asphalt specifications and, on the other hand, in-situ mix production and laying operating conditions, a constrained Monte Carlo simulation, by means of an Latin Hypercube Algorithm, has been carried out in order to evaluate pavement performance.
