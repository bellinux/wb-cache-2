5|$|Both Mulder and Joan follow Jeraldine to Hong Kong, where Mulder {{learns that}} she is a {{middleman}} selling government secrets. Mulder tracks down Jeraldine and handcuffs himself to her. Arriving at her office, Mulder finds Alex Krycek (Nicholas Lea) waiting inside, having been selling the contents of the digital tape. Krycek escapes through a window while Jeraldine is shot by a group of men coming <b>down</b> <b>the</b> <b>hallway.</b> Mulder unlocks the handcuffs and escapes. Meanwhile, Joan walks down the hall and encounters the men, creating a flash that causes them all to suffer from the radiation burns.|$|E
5|$|Though {{the single}} {{was never a}} {{physical}} CD release, artwork was created for it. The artwork featured the headless man who is otherwise seen throughout the releases for other singles from Dream Days at the Hotel Existence, however on this cover, the area where his head would be is a fireball, and {{he appears to be}} holding a briefcase while walking <b>down</b> <b>the</b> <b>hallway</b> of a hotel, another common theme throughout the artwork for the album. Unlike the last two singles from Dream Days at the Hotel Existence, the artwork doesn't follow the picture-in-picture theme.|$|E
5|$|The {{music video}} begins with Clarkson {{sitting on a}} couch in an apartment's living room, holding a {{heart-shaped}} locket in her hand. The next scene shows Clarkson in the bathroom where she fixes {{her face in the}} mirror, she opens the medicine cabinet and tossing all the pills in the medicine cabinet over her shoulder and messing all the bathroom items on the floor, squirting the toothpaste into the sink. When she gets to a container of birth control pills, she turns on the water in the sink, snaps the pills out, and drops them down the drain. Clarkson then starts to take other items; she throws a container of makeup powder spray in the air and smears a container of facial mud mask on the wall. During the chorus, Clarkson and her band perform the song for a dancing crowd in a club. After the first chorus, Clarkson walks into a room full of closets. She cuts up dresses, rifling through the closets and pulling out clothes, destroying them and singing in a pile of them. After the second chorus, she walks into a bedroom and begins to tear the pillow on the bed, filling the room with feathers. The scenes of Clarkson singing with her band then alternate with a montage of her destroying the apartment, breaks the glass window from the door, breaks the vase, television, clock, fridge, lights, microwave, phone, furniture and the chair. Later, Clarkson takes a framed photo of her ex-boyfriend with another girl in the living room, before pushing a tall CD rack over. She then smashes the framed photo through a glass table, breaking it in half. Having decimated the apartment, Clarkson walks out the door and <b>down</b> <b>the</b> <b>hallway</b> with a hat on her head, just as her ex-boyfriend appears with his girlfriend, walking arm in arm. Clarkson hides her face as she walks away from them. The final scene shows the couple seeing their damaged apartment in shock and the scene of the locket swinging.|$|E
50|$|A retired accountant, Jaskulski {{worked as}} a {{controller}} at KHON-TV. He trained by doing chin ups and running <b>down</b> <b>the</b> <b>hallways</b> of his apartment building. With failing eyesight, {{he was forced to}} stop the workouts shortly before his death.|$|R
50|$|Bello is {{the second}} son of Maria Luisa Pou. He has four sisters. At age five, he emigrated from the Dominican Republic to Puerto Rico {{and a year later}} from PR to Miami, Florida where he lived until he {{graduated}} from Miami Beach Senior High School. While at school, Bello {{spent most of his time}} in class writing and composing songs. He would walk <b>down</b> <b>the</b> <b>hallways</b> singing <b>the</b> songs he would write during class.|$|R
60|$|After {{that came}} another period of silence, {{broken only by}} the sounds of the two men undressing. To keep himself awake Dick {{commenced}} to walk up and <b>down</b> <b>the</b> long <b>hallway</b> again.|$|R
500|$|The ride {{received}} mostly positive reviews {{upon its}} July 2014 opening. Lance Hart from Screamscape {{was impressed with}} the fact that the King's Cross entrance was hidden from the rest of the Diagon Alley area. He also credited Universal for making the train look as realistic as possible: [...] "Clearly they went to great lengths to create these cars to be replicas of what you see in the films, both on the outside as well as on the inside as you move <b>down</b> <b>the</b> <b>hallway</b> towards your cabin to take your seat". In terms of the overall experience Hart said, [...] "Universal has managed to turn what would simply be a method of transporting guests between their two parks into yet another must-see attraction ... tying together the overall story and theme of visiting Hogwarts at Islands of Adventure and Diagon Alley inside Universal Studios Florida".|$|E
500|$|... "G.U.Y." [...] {{begins as}} Gaga rises {{again in a}} white dress, reborn as a Greek goddess of sorts and the song begins to play. Shots of Gaga in {{different}} outfits, including a blue dress and white bikini are shown with dance sequences. Andy Cohen and the stars of The Real Housewives of Beverly Hills make cameos in the video. A scene featuring Gaga rolling around on a seashell bed in a red outfit, dancing in a gold leotard with arrows, and floating on a bed in a pool are shown throughout the song. With the help of YouTuber SkyDoesMinecraft (also making his cameo appearance), Michael Jackson, Mahatma Gandhi, John Lennon, and Jesus are resurrected using the game Minecraft and their blood is used to create clones known as [...] "G.U.Y." [...] Gaga, Vanderpump, and Richards are seen {{coming out of a}} car in black outfits, shooting money cannons, and walking <b>down</b> <b>the</b> <b>hallway</b> to kill corporate executives to replace with G.U.Y. clones. The video ends with thousands of these clones marching out of the castle. The credits section of the video then features [...] "Manicure" [...] playing.|$|E
500|$|Afterwards, Jack's {{secretary}} tells Liz that Jack {{wants her}} to apologize, but {{that she has to}} pretend that it was her idea. Liz goes to Jack's office and apologizes, and they forgive each other. While the staff eats their lunch, Jack introduces the staff to two of his guests. The writers mention to Liz that they would love to go outside to the same roof that is used for The Today Show, and Liz tells them that she can make it happen now that she and Jack are friends. Liz asks Jack, but he denies the request. He tells her that the two guests were his bosses from GE, and then criticizes Liz and her staff. He apologizes to Liz, but she says that their friendship is over. Having settled the situation with Jack, Liz tries to talk to her assistant Cerie about her attire, which seems to distract the writers. Liz attempts to convince her to wear something conservative, but Cerie tells Liz that she would look great in something sexy herself, and Liz is later seen walking <b>down</b> <b>the</b> <b>hallway</b> with a dress that reads [...] "Dirty Diva".|$|E

2500|$|The {{defibrillator}} {{designed by}} Zoll, {{as well as}} earlier versions invented by Kouwenhoven and Beck, utilized alternating current and were run from line voltage, the electricity from any wall socket. The decision to use alternating current rather than direct current was a practical one. Direct current batteries and capacitor technology both powerful enough {{to do the job}} and portable enough for practical use simply didn't exist in the early 1950s. These AC defibrillators were very large and heavy, primarily because they contained a transformer to step up the line voltage from [...] to 500 or [...] The only good feature is that they could be mounted on wheels and pushed <b>down</b> <b>the</b> <b>hallway</b> from one part of the hospital to another. Not many lives would be saved unless the inherent non-portability of AC defibrillators could be solved.|$|E
2500|$|On {{the morning}} of March 29, 2006, McKinney entered the Longworth House Office Building's {{southeast}} entrance and proceeded past the security checkpoint, walking around the metal detector. Members of Congress have identifying lapel pins and {{are not required to}} pass through metal detectors. The officers present failed to recognize McKinney as a member of Congress because she was not wearing the appropriate lapel pin and had recently changed her hairstyle. She proceeded westward down the ground floor hallway and about halfway <b>down</b> <b>the</b> <b>hallway</b> was stopped by United States Capitol Police officer Paul McKenna, who states that he had been calling after her: [...] "Ma'am, Ma'am!"; at that time it is reported that McKinney struck the officer.

50|$|Concourse C {{opened in}} September 1994 to serve all Comair flights and was closed in 2009 due to flight {{reductions}} by Delta Air Lines. Concourse C {{is an island}} concourse. Access was via bus link from other terminals and ticketing areas. It was the first ever dedicated regional jet concourse {{at the time of}} its construction and with 53 gates it remains the largest in the world. The concourse has an H-shaped configuration with a waiting area in the center where passengers were able to sit and shop. Passengers would then proceed <b>down</b> <b>the</b> <b>hallways</b> when flights began boarding. Concourse C was expanded twice to increase gate capacity. First in 1997 to the south and again in 2001 to the north.|$|R
50|$|On September 29, 2014, Judge Tynia Richard {{offered a}} sharp rebuke to the Department of Corrections, recommending that six {{corrections}} officers be fired. This group, led by Captain Budnarine Behari, {{had participated in}} the brutal beating of Robert Hinton, a mentally ill inmate, while he was hog-tied, because he had protested being moved from his cell by sitting down. Hinton's fellow inmates watched as he was dragged <b>down</b> <b>the</b> <b>hallways</b> while hog-tied to a solitary confinement cell where he was beaten. While this ruling {{was one of the most}} severe against the Department of Corrections in many years, almost two years had elapsed between the beating and the Justice Department's ruling, during which time the perpetrators in this attack were involved in more inmate beatings at Rikers Island.|$|R
2500|$|Shortly after 1:30 pm on June 13, 2008, Russert {{collapsed}} at {{the offices}} of WRC-TV, which houses the Washington, D.C. bureau of NBC News where he was chief. He was recording voiceovers for the Sunday edition of Meet the Press. In a speech he gave at the Kennedy Center, Brian Williams said that Russert's last words were, [...] "What's happening?" [...] spoken as a greeting to NBC Washington bureau editing supervisor Candace Harrington as he passed her in the hallway. He then walked <b>down</b> <b>the</b> <b>hallway</b> to record voiceovers in the soundproof booth and collapsed. A co-worker began CPR on him. The District of Columbia Fire and Rescue service {{received a call from}} NBC at 1:40 pm, and dispatched an EMS unit which arrived at 1:44 pm. Paramedics attempted to defibrillate Russert's heart three times, but he did not respond. Russert was then transported to Sibley Memorial Hospital, arriving at 2:23 pm, where he was pronounced dead. He was 58 years old.|$|E
2500|$|In contrast, let us {{examine a}} {{situation}} which would exhibit memorylessness. Imagine a long hallway, lined {{on one wall}} with thousands of safes. Each safe has a dial with 500 positions, and each has been assigned an opening position at random. Imagine that an eccentric man walks <b>down</b> <b>the</b> <b>hallway,</b> stopping once at each safe to make a single random attempt to open it. In this case, we might define random variable X as the lifetime of his search, {{expressed in terms of}} [...] "number of attempts the man must make until he successfully opens a safe". In this case, E will always be equal to the value of 500, regardless of how many attempts have already been made. Each new attempt has a (1/500) chance of succeeding, so the man is likely to open exactly one safe sometime in the next 500 attempts -- but with each new failure he makes no [...] "progress" [...] toward ultimately succeeding. Even if the man has just failed 499 consecutive times (or 4,999 times), we expect to wait 500 more attempts until we observe the next success. If, instead, this man focused his attempts on a single safe, and [...] "remembered" [...] his previous attempts to open it, he would be guaranteed to open the safe after, at most, 500 attempts (and, in fact, at onset would only expect to need 250 attempts, not 500).|$|E

When the receptionist informed the man she had left for the day, {{he walked out of}} the office, then immediately returned brandishing a pistol. The receptionist escaped to the back of the office and called the Tulsa Police Department. The gunman trapped several employees inside the office and guarded the exit. After approximately ten minutes, police arrived on scene. When the gunman refused to drop his weapon, police fired shots hitting him in the waist. Shortly after, the police handcuffed the man and he was taken to a hospital where he was listed as being in serious condition. No employees were hurt.|$|R

60|$|He {{had tried}} four keys without success, {{when he saw}} a waiter {{approaching}} with a trayful of good things for a late supper in a nearby apartment. At once he moved away <b>down</b> <b>the</b> <b>hallway</b> and did not return until the servant had disappeared from view.|$|E
60|$|Without waiting, Tom ran <b>down</b> <b>the</b> <b>hallway.</b> He {{knew not}} {{where he was}} going, and, coming, to a door, slipped through. He now {{found himself in the}} rear of the Hall and a few seconds later ran across the back garden and dove into the farm lands.|$|E
5000|$|Elsewhere, Richard (Karl Makinen), {{a member}} of the Kingdom's military, pays Carol (Melissa McBride) a visit inside her cottage, who is with Morgan (Lennie James). He tries to persuade them both to have King Ezekiel (Khary Payton) {{consider}} fighting the Saviors, as he fears they may in fact kill them even if they continue to obey their demands. They debate and both staunchly refuse; Richard dejectedly leaves. At the Saviors' compound, with help from an anonymous source, Daryl (Norman Reedus) exits his cell and sneaks <b>down</b> <b>the</b> <b>hallways.</b> He escapes <b>the</b> building and makes it outside to the courtyard where the motorcycles are kept, but encounters Fat Joey (Joshua Hoover) and bludgeons him to death with a pipe.

50|$|The fire then swept <b>down</b> through <b>the</b> <b>hallway</b> ceiling's {{ventilation}} grates {{into the}} second floor corridor as it flashed through the cockloft above the classrooms. Glass transom windows above the doors of each classroom broke as the heat intensified, allowing superheated gasses and thick black smoke in <b>the</b> <b>hallway</b> to enter <b>the</b> classrooms. By the time the students and their teachers in the second floor classrooms realized the danger (and the occupants {{of several of the}} rooms, until that moment, did not realize the danger), their sole escape route into <b>the</b> <b>hallway</b> was impassable. <b>The</b> second floor of the north wing had become a perfect fire trap.|$|R
50|$|The Hairy Vulture {{is a type}} of vulture {{that has}} fur instead of feathers. The origin of the Hairy Vulture's name comes from a bully at Lark Creek Elementary School named Gary Fulcher.

5000|$|The work's {{inspiration}} was {{a mixture}} of two elements. At the time of its composition, the composer was beginning {{to pay more attention to}} the subject matter of his subconscious, such as dreams. In one dream, he describes driving along Interstate 5, when he was approached from behind by two black limousines. As the vehicles drew up beside him, they transformed into two incredibly long Steinway pianos, giving off volleys of E-flat and B-flat major arpeggios. It reminded him of walking <b>down</b> <b>the</b> <b>hallways</b> of <b>the</b> San Francisco Conservatory of Music, where he used to hear students practicing the piano, creating a [...] "sonic blur of twenty or more pianos playing Chopin, Beethoven's Emperor Concerto, Hanon, Rachmaninov and much more." [...] An example of this is clearly audible during Part I of the work, when the two pianos enter as soloists for the first time. Several of his other works, including his large-scale orchestral work, Harmonielehre, were inspired by similar visions.|$|R
