25|$|May: the Iranian {{government}} announced {{the arrest of}} eight women involved in online modeling without a mandatory <b>head</b> <b>scarf.</b> Mehdi Abutorabi, a blogger who managed a publishing tool called Persian Blog, was also detained.|$|E
25|$|Some {{sections}} of the British press reacted angrily to the Iranian television footage of the detainees, particularly the prominence of servicewoman Faye Turney, {{and that she was}} seen wearing a <b>head</b> <b>scarf.</b> According to Iranian laws, all females above the age of 13 are required to observe the Islamic dress code of Iran.|$|E

50|$|The {{clothing}} of {{the people}} of Baluchistan, Pakistan consists of various styles of kameez and shalwar, turban, shoes and <b>head</b> <b>scarfs.</b>|$|R
50|$|Another {{industrial}} activity typical of Kalymnos was {{the production of}} painted <b>head</b> <b>scarfs,</b> which were the most original component of the female dress.|$|R
25|$|Another {{style of}} the Punjabi suit {{is the use of}} the shalwar which hails from the Pothohar region of Punjab, Pakistan and is known as the Pothohari shalwar. The Pothohari shalwar retains the wideness of the older Punjabi suthan and also has some folds. The kameez is also wide. The <b>head</b> <b>scarf</b> is {{traditionally}} large, similar to the chador or phulkari that was used throughout the plains of the Punjab region.|$|E
25|$|The kurta is {{a remnant}} of the 11th century female kurtaka which was a shirt {{extending}} {{to the middle of}} the body with side slits worn in parts of north India which has remained a traditional garment for women in Punjab, albeit longer than the kurtaka. The suthan was traditionally worn with a long kurta but can also be worn with a short kurti or frocks. Modern versions of the kurta can be knee length. The <b>head</b> <b>scarf</b> is also traditionally long but again, modern versions are shorter.|$|E
25|$|Contemporary {{commentators}} have highlighted {{situations in which}} toleration conflicts with widely held moral standards, national law, the principles of national identity, or other strongly held goals. Michael Walzer notes that the British in India tolerated the Hindu practice of suttee (ritual burning of a widow) until 1829. On the other hand, the United States declined to tolerate the Mormon practice of polygamy. The French <b>head</b> <b>scarf</b> controversy represents a conflict between religious practice and the French secular ideal. Toleration of the Romani people in European countries is a continuing issue.|$|E
5000|$|Women in Tajikistan also wear dresses {{which are}} long robes called kurta with sirwal called izor (also {{referred}} to as sharovary) tied at the ankles. The ankle gathers are tied with a cord. <b>Head</b> <b>scarfs</b> are also worn.|$|R
5000|$|Phulkari (ਫੁਲਕਾਰੀ) {{embroidery}} technique {{from the}} Punjab region (divided between India and Pakistan) literally means flower work, {{which was at}} one time used as the word for embroidery, but in time the word “Phulkari” became restricted to embroidered shawls and <b>head</b> <b>scarfs.</b> Simple and sparsely embroidered odini (<b>head</b> <b>scarfs),</b> dupatta and shawls, made for everyday use, are called Phulkaris, whereas garments that cover the entire body, made for special and ceremonial occasions like weddings and birth of a son, fully covered fabric is called Baghs ("garden") and scattered work on the fabric is called [...] "adha bagh" [...] (half garden). This whole work is done with white or yellow silk floss on cotton khaddarh and starts from the center on the fabric called [...] "chashm-e-bulbul" [...] and spreads to the whole fabric.|$|R
50|$|Following World War I, {{gender issues}} were {{highlighted}} {{as an area}} to reform. Iran, Tunisia, and Egypt all addressed controversial topics of women's rights in divorce and child custody while reforming amendments. Iran and Turkey began strongly opposing the need of <b>head</b> <b>scarfs.</b> Such reformations have continued through the twenty-first century.|$|R
2500|$|Modern Igbo {{traditional}} attire {{is generally}} made up, for men, of the Isiagu top which resembles the African Dashiki. Isiagu (or Ishi agu) is usually patterned with lions heads embroidered over the clothing, It {{can also be}} plain, (usually black). It is worn with trousers and can be worn with either [...] a traditional title holders hat (a fez named okpu agu or agwu), or with the traditional Igbo stripped men's hat (which resembles the Bobble hat). For women, an embodied puffed sleeve blouse (influenced by European attire) along with two wrappers (usually modern Hollandis material) and a <b>head</b> <b>scarf</b> are worn.|$|E
2500|$|In the Quran, {{the holy}} book of Islam, it is {{explicitly}} stated, [...] "Let them draw their Khimar (shawl/head veil) over their juyub (breast-line/cleavage)". The ayat {{refers to the}} women's clothes worn, parted in the front to expose the breasts, {{at the time when}} it was cited. It was later interpreted as total covering of a woman's body. In early 21st century Muslim world there are differences in legal implementation. In Saudi Arabia and Afghanistan, women are required to cover their body and face completely, Iranian law requires a chador (over-cloak) or a hijab (<b>head</b> <b>scarf).</b> In Egypt, the exposure of cleavage in the media is considered to be nudity.|$|E
2500|$|This is {{represented}} by the show's promotional tagline, [...] "Small town Canada with a little Muslim twist": the religious angle, while always present, is largely tied to and sometimes even secondary to standard and universal sitcom themes such as family, friends and the humour in everyday life. For example, while the show sometimes tackles storylines with a political edge, such as a character claiming to be unable to attend a conference in the United States because he says he was wrongly placed on a no-fly list (when in fact he is simply afraid of flying) or the mosque being raided by the Canadian Security Intelligence Service, even these situations are explored as much for their humour as their politics. The show much more commonly explores purely comedic issues such as whether a Muslim woman still has to cover her hair if the only man who can see her is gay, whether Muslims can curl, whether to haggle with the carpet salesman when buying a prayer rug, or whether a Muslim woman's <b>head</b> <b>scarf</b> is enough to mitigate a bad hair day. Television critics have also credited this very combination of an attention-grabbing premise with conventional and familiar sitcom themes as one of the primary reasons that the show successfully retained an audience after its debut.|$|E
50|$|The Common {{elements}} in Polish costumes feature coral necklaces for the women, hats and capes for the men; large flower crowns, colorful <b>head</b> <b>scarfs,</b> for women. Also the Fur hats(commonly worn in Russia by men/women), and plenty more. Velvet waist coats apply to some women' consumes in Masovia {{and the north}} east of Poland.|$|R
50|$|During the 1989 Islamic scarf {{controversy}} in France, Badinter, Régis Debray, Alain Finkielkraut, Elisabeth de Fontenay and Catherine Kintzler wrote {{an open letter}} to former Minister of Education, Lionel Jospin demanding to not let students who refuse to take off their <b>head</b> <b>scarfs</b> go to school. Badinter believes that the French public education system should be free of any religious affiliation and that neutrality in public institutions of a secularist state must prevail over expressions of individuality in them.|$|R

The color schemes for the twins were the exact opposite, with Plus having black hair and orange skin and Minus with white hair and purple skin. Plus was very upbeat and enthusiastic, while Minus was more thoughtful and easily discouraged. A recurring sketch was Minus's attempt to board a spaceship, and Plus distracting him and causing him to miss the take-off. Their favorite game was [...] "Gotcha Last," [...] a combination of Tag and Hide and Seek that went on eternally.|$|R

40|$|Traduction de : Interpénétrations : l'Islam et l'Europe, Éd. Galaade, 2005. Islam in Europe {{is a book}} full of {{striking}} images: the assassination of and the death threats against artists and intellectuals; violent demonstrations demanding Sharia law for Europe; and acts of terrorism. Also detailed are European political initiatives and, in some cases, new laws that forbid the wearing of the burka in public spaces, the ban on minarets in Switzerland, and other efforts to keep Western culture "pure. " But there is another reality, as Nilüfer Göle describes it from her own life experience: Muslims who are politicians in European parliaments; scholars teaching in European universities; and artists who use this creative intercultural exchange as a theme in their art. More visible are {{the hundreds of thousands}} of students, workers, merchants, and professionals who participate in every aspect of public life without concealing their heritage. N. Göle sees the best hope for a modern and European Islam in the Muslim women who [...] in contrast to the men [...] demonstrate their commitment to their heritage by wearing <b>head</b> <b>scarfs</b> while participating in modern Western life. In manifesting their professional and public experience in their own communities, they become the agents of change and modernism. Göle thus sees European Islam as "feminine," in contrast to the male-dominated traditional Islam...|$|R
