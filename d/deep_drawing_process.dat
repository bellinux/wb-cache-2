In this study, finite element method based simulation using a commercially available software package is carried out on <b>deep</b> <b>drawing</b> of circular cups of austenitic stainless steel at an operating temperature ranging from room temperature to 300 °C. Experiments are also conducted at the same temperatures. Comparison between the experimental values and the finite element simulation results shows a good agreement between the two. Thus, finite element method simulation can be used effectively to analyze the <b>deep</b> <b>drawing</b> operation at any temperature within this range by modifying any input parameters without conducting the experiment and hence a lot of cost saving...|$|R

40|$|Abstract- The Deep {{drawing is}} a {{manufacturing}} {{process in which}} sheet metal is progressively formed into a three-dimensional shape through the mechanical action of a die forming the metal around a punch. To reduce various defects in <b>deep</b> <b>drawing</b> <b>process</b> {{it is necessary to}} control some parameters of <b>deep</b> <b>drawing</b> <b>process.</b> Sheet-metal drawing is a more complex operation than cutting or bending.

40|$|In Finite Element (FE) {{simulations}} of {{sheet metal forming}} (SMF), the coefficient of friction is generally expressed as a constant Coulomb friction. However in reality, the coefficient of friction at the local contact spots varies with the varying operational, deformation and contact conditions. Therefore, {{it is important to}} calculate the coefficient of friction under local conditions to better evaluate the formability of the product. Friction at a local scale is largely influenced by the micro-mechanisms at the asperity level like shearing in the boundary layer, ploughing and hydrodynamic lubrication. In this paper, a new mixed lubrication model is developed considering the aforementioned micro-mechanisms to better describe the friction conditions for <b>deep</b> <b>drawing</b> <b>processes.</b> Central to the friction prediction is the calculation of the lubricant film thickness and the contact area evolution based on the asperity flattening mechanisms.

40|$|Abstract. Sheet {{metal forming}} <b>processes,</b> in {{particular}} <b>deep</b> <b>drawing</b> <b>processes,</b> are highly influenced by occurrence of latent and friction heat. Especially when forming metastable austenitic stainless steels, strain-induced martensite formation is suppressed by higher temperatures and therefore influences the material {{behavior and the}} so-called TRIP-effect. This study gives an overview about thermal influences on the <b>deep</b> <b>drawing</b> forming <b>process</b> of metastable austenitic CrNi-steel 1. 4301 in comparison with ferritic stainless steels such as 1. 4016. Measurements on serial and evaluation tools were carried out to determine occurring temperatures within forming tools. Attention is paid to effects on tribological aspects such as behavior of lubricants at higher temperatures, influence of temperature development on the martensite formation, mechanical properties, forming limit curves as well as heat flow within the forming tools. Lubricants with different temperature stability were compared to each other with determination of friction coefficient in strip drawing tests. Martensite and temperature development during forming of material measured in non-isothermal tensile tests are approving a high dependency of martensite formation on temperature. Forming limit curves for temperatures determined from room temperature to 140 °C for EN 1. 4301 are showing high dependency of necking behavior especially under plain strain conditions. Determination of thermal contact conductance coefficients for process and relevant material combinations for tooling allows interpreting heat flow mechanisms in forming tools and improving forming process to higher robustness.

40|$|Drawbeads are {{commonly}} used in <b>deep</b> <b>drawing</b> <b>processes</b> to control {{the flow of the}} blank during the forming operation. In finite element simulations of <b>deep</b> <b>drawing</b> the drawbead geometries are seldom included because of the small radii; because of these small radii {{a very large number of}} elements is required in 3 -D simulations. To cope with this problem, a 2 -D analysis of the drawbead has been performed and the calculated restraining force will be applied in the near future in 3 -D simulations with an equivalent drawbead element. Modelling drawbeads by only applying an additional restraining force is not satisfactory. During the flow of the material through a drawbead, the strain distribution changes and the material usually becomes thinner. These effects must be incorporated in the equivalent drawbead element. For the modelling of the drawbead a 2 -D plane strain finite element model was developed. Several simulations were carried out to investigate the behaviour of the drawbead.
