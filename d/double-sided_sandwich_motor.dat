50|$|In Laithwaite's {{original}} designs, {{known as}} <b>double-sided</b> <b>sandwich</b> <b>motors,</b> {{two sets of}} windings were used, positioned a few centimetres apart. They were positioned so that the aluminium stator plate would fit in {{the gap between the}} windings, sandwiching it between them. The advantage to this layout is that the forces pulling one set of windings toward the plate are balanced by the opposite forces in the other set. By attaching the two sets of windings to a common frame, all of the forces are internalised.|$|R
5000|$|Looking {{to address}} the {{problems}} found in the <b>sandwich</b> <b>motor,</b> starting in 1967 Eric Laithwaite and his team at Imperial College London began experimenting with single-sided LIM arrangements. In this arrangement there is no corresponding set of magnetic fields on the [...] "far side" [...] of the stator, which requires some other system to be used to create a complete flux path.|$|R

2500|$|The {{electrified}} {{lines were}} operated by electric multiple units. These were originally three-car units, with a trailer <b>sandwiched</b> between <b>motor</b> cars, later converted into two-car units with one driving motor car and one driving trailer. New classes of multiple unit were developed for each electrified line, {{known as the}} South London stock and the Crystal Palace) stock. A third type, the Coulsdon and Wallington stock was planned by the LB but introduced by the Southern Railway.|$|R
25|$|The {{standard}} units contained only passenger accommodation, {{and formed}} {{the bulk of}} the fleet. They were unusual in that all four traction motors were mounted on one non-driving motor coach. Units consisted of two driving trailers, <b>sandwiching</b> the non-driving <b>motor</b> coach and an intermediate trailer.|$|R
40|$|A {{special-purpose}} analysis tool {{based on}} the finite element method is presented for parametric design studies of composite laminates and sandwich panels with scarf repairs. This design tool provides the complete three-dimensional stress and strain fields in scarf-repaired panels without any requirements {{on the nature of}} the lamination and the type of loading. The adherends are modeled using a plate element based on a higher-order single-layer theory, and the adhesive is modeled using a solid element. The higher-order nature of the plate theory makes it suitable for analyzing thick laminates and sandwich pan-els comprised of numerous plies. The model takes into account geometric nonlinearity in the adherends and assumes a bilinear stress-strain relationship for the adhesive. The responses of composite laminates with single- and <b>double-sided</b> repairs and <b>sandwich</b> panels with both full and partial repairs of the top face sheets are investigated. 1...|$|R
30|$|The SEM {{images were}} {{recorded}} on a field-emission {{scanning electron microscopy}} (FESEM, FEI, Nova 230). UV–vis absorption spectra were recorded using a UV–vis spectrophotometer (UV- 2550, Shimadzu Corporation, Kyoto, Japan). Transmission electron microscope (TEM) analysis was done on a Tecnai G 2 F 30 TEM (FEI Company). Photoelectrochemical reactions of as-prepared samples were carried out in a 250 -mL quartz cell, using a two-electrode configuration with the as-prepared samples as working electrode and a Pt counter electrode. A 3 -m <b>double-sided</b> adhesive tape <b>sandwiched</b> between the work electrode and the Pt electrode is used to fix the distance between these two electrodes. The photocurrent–voltage characteristics of as-prepared samples with an effective surface area of 0.1  cm− 2 were recorded using an electrochemical workstation (CHI 660 E, Shanghai Chenhua Instruments Co., Ltd., Shanghai, China) under simulated AM 1.5 G illumination (100  mW cm− 2) provided by a solar simulator equipped with a 500  W Xe lamp. The electrolyte was 1.0  M Na 2 S aqueous solution.|$|R
40|$|Cell sheet {{technology}} {{has been used to}} deliver cells in single-sheet form with an intact extracellular matrix for soft tissue repair and regeneration. Here, we hypothesized that titanium-reinforced cell sheets could be constructed for bone tissue engineering and regeneration. Fifty-mu m-thick titanium plates containing apertures were prepared and roughened by acid etching, some of which were photofunctionalized with 12 min of UV light treatment. Cell sheets were prepared by culturing rat calvarial periosteum-derived cells on temperature-responsive culture dishes and attached to titanium plates. Titanium-reinforced osteogenic cell sheet construction was conditional on various technical and material factors: cell sheets needed to be <b>double-sided</b> and <b>sandwich</b> the titanium plate, and the titanium plates needed to be micro thin and contain apertures to allow close apposition of the two cell sheets. Critically, titanium plates needed to be UV-photofunctionalized to ensure adherence and retention of cell sheets. Single-sided cell sheets or double-sided cell sheets on as-made titanium contracted and deformed within 4 days of incubation. Titanium-reinforced cell sheets on photofunctionalized titanium were structurally stable at least up to 14 days, developed the expected osteogenic phenotypes (ALP production and mineralization), and maintained structural integrity without functional degradation. Successful construction of titanium-reinforced osteogenic cell sheets was associated with increased cell attachment, retention, and expression of vinculin, an adhesion protein by photofunctionalization. This study identified the technical and material requirements for constructing titanium-reinforced osteogenic cell sheets. Future invivo studies are warranted to test these titanium-reinforced cell sheets as stably transplantable, mechanically durable, and shape controllable osteogenic devices.

5000|$|While {{this new}} vehicle {{shared the same}} {{displacement}} as the regular Accord V6 powerplant, the engine in the hybrid {{was derived from the}} 2005 Honda Odyssey minivan and has the ability to shut off three of the six cylinders under certain conditions for better fuel economy (a technology that Honda calls VCM or Variable Cylinder Management). The new engine features iVTEC technology and drives a new compact five-speed semi-automatic transmission, developed to allow the inclusion of the electric <b>motor</b> <b>sandwiched</b> between the transversely mounted engine. Power of the gas engine is up from [...] and torque rose from 212 to 232 lbft Nm. The vehicle reaches 60 mph in 6.5 seconds. Together with the Integrated Motor Assist electric motor, the hybrid version provided slightly higher performance than the conventional V6-engined Accord. However, the marketplace did not embrace the Accord Hybrid, and the vehicle was discontinued after the 2007 model year.|$|R
