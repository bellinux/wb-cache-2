A total of 239, 2407 parasites were recovered from 92 hosts examined from February to October 2011. Such parasites included Ichthyophthirius multifiliis, Tripartiella tetramerii and Trichodina nobilis (Protozoa), Dolops longicauda (Argulidae), Gussevia alioides, Gussevia disparoides (Monogenoidea), Digenea metacercarie, Pseudoproleptus larvae, Anisakidae larvae (Nematoda), Proteocephalidea plerocercoid (Eucestoda) and Gorytocephalus spectabilis (Acanthocephala). Ciliates were the most dominant and abundant taxon, while cestodes were the least prevalent. The parasites showed seasonal variation in their infection dynamics associated with environmental changes during the Amazonian <b>drainage</b> <b>season,</b> except the infection with I. multifiliis. The parasites community in A. tetramerus was also characterized by higher diversity, species richness and uniformity during the <b>drainage</b> <b>season</b> when compared to Amazon flood season.

40|$|Since European settlement, and {{beginning}} in the 19402 ̆ 7 s, two dramatic shifts in land use have occurred in Iowa - the first from prairie and forest to tile-drained farmland, and the second from diverse rotations to a heavier concentration of corn-soybean rotations and continuous corn. These shifts in land use and management have altered hydrological and biogeochemical cycles in the Upper Midwest, but perennial and cover crops {{have the potential to}} assist in mediating changes in these cycles. The first study in this thesis examines how the perennial forage (PF) crop orchardgrass (Dactylis glomerata) affects subsurface drainage as compared to a corn-soybean rotation or continuous corn (row crops, or RC).

40|$|Intensive {{agricultural}} drainage in the U. S. Corn Belt is {{the primary}} pathway for non-point source nutrient loading in the Upper Mississippi River Basin. Understanding the historic regional variability in hydroclimate drivers of subsurface drainage, {{as well as the}} influences of climate change, is important for implementing appropriate Drainage Water Management (DWM) practices to improve water quality. Observed drainflow data from Minnesota, Iowa, Illinois, Indiana, and Ohio were used to parameterize the Variable Infiltration Capacity (VIC) macro-scale hydrologic model, with a subsurface drainage algorithm, for use in the Corn Belt. Simulated soil frost depth, non-growing season precipitation, and USDA Hardiness Zone were found to be the strongest hydroclimate predictors of subsurface drainage regime during the historic period of 1981 – 2010. The northwestern portion of the region is drier as the southwestern portion of the region receives up to twice the amount of annual precipitation. In addition, northern colder hardiness zones (3 a – 4 b) historically experience deeper frost depths, resulting in shorter drainage seasons that start later in the spring and produce lower, more variable annual drainage compared to southern zones (5 a – 6 b). This generally aligns with field observations; however, the simulated <b>drainage</b> <b>season</b> was shorter and the ratio of annual drainflow to precipitation was on {{the lower end of the}} observed range. An ensemble of three Atmosphere-Ocean Global Climate Models (Parallel Climate Model, Geophysical Fluid Dynamics Laboratory Coupled Model, Hadley Centre Coupled Model Version 3) was used to calculate multi-model means across low (B 1), moderate (A 1 B) and high (A 2) carbon emissions scenarios to evaluate projected changes in hydroclimate and drainage metrics. By mid-century (2035 – 2064) for the A 2 scenario, annual subsurface drainage is projected to increase between 2 and 64 mm across the region, with regional median increase of 38 mm. The projected increase in drainage coincides with shallower maximum frost depths and wetter non-growing seasons. Three main patterns of change in subsurface drainage regime were identified: the northwestern zones (3 b – 4 a), the mid-latitude transitional zones (4 b – 5 a), and the southeastern zones (5 b – 6 b). In general, projected subsurface <b>drainage</b> <b>season</b> is lengthening a few weeks in the northwestern zones and up to a full month in the mid-latitude transitional and southeastern zones. Compared to historical conditions, the northwestern zones are projected to have a 16 – 27 cm decrease in soil frost depth and a 12 – 13...|$|E

40|$|There {{have been}} only a few studies of {{potassium}} (K) losses from grassland systems, and {{little is known about}} their dynamics, especially in relation to nitrogen (N) management. A study was performed during the autumn and winter of 1999 and 2000 to understand the effects of N and drainage on the dynamics of K leaching on a hillslope grassland soil in southwestern England. Two N application rates were studied (0 and 280 kg N ha(- 1) yr(- 1)), both with and without the drainage. Treatments receiving N also received farmyard manure (FM). Higher total K losses and K concentrations in the leachates were found in the N + FM treatments (150 and 185 % higher than in 0 N treatments), which were related to K additions in the FM. Drainage reduced K losses by 35 % because of an increase in dry matter production and a reduction in overland and preferential flow. The pattern of change in K concentration in the leachates was associated with preferential flow {{at the beginning of the}} <b>drainage</b> <b>season</b> and with matrix flow later in winter, and was best described by a double exponential curve. Rainfall intensity and the autumn application of FM were the main determinants of K losses by leaching.

40|$|Subsurface {{drainage}} systems in Iowa increase {{the productivity of}} annual row crops, such as corn and soybeans, but also contribute to alterations in the hydrological balance {{of the region and}} leaching of nutrient pollutants, such as NO 3 -N. This study’s objective was to determine whether perennial forage orchardgrass can reduce the volume and change the timing of subsurface drainage in tiled fields in Iowa, thereby contributing to reductions in NO 3 -N leaching and moderating changes in the hydrology. Research was conducted at Iowa State University’s Agricultural Drainage Water Research Site, located in northwest Iowa. Six 0. 05 ha plots (three control and three treatment plots), each including subsurface drainage with continuous flow monitoring, were planted to row crops (RC) consisting of either a corn-soybean rotation or continuous corn from 1990 - 2004 (the pretreatment period). During the treatment period (2006 - 2011), control plots remained in RC while treatment plots were planted to perennial forage (PF), a mixture of orchardgrass, red clover, and ladino clover, succeeding to a monoculture of orchardgrass. During the pretreatment period, control and treatment plots showed no difference in subsurface drainage.

40|$|The Rowden Moor {{experimental}} site (A. F. R. C. I. G. E. R., North Wyke) {{provided an}} opportunity to characterise discharge regimes, elucidate runoff generation mechanisms and to consider implications for solute movement under natural and drained conditions. Research was conducted on a heavy clay grassland soil {{in an area of}} high rainfall (1053 mm a ˉ¹) in South West England. A combined hydrometric and tensiometric study was undertaken within a nested experimental design (1 m² to 1 ha) on one undrained and one drained site throughout a <b>drainage</b> <b>season</b> (October to March). Results at the hectare scale demonstrated that drainage did not substantially alter the volume of field runoff (~ 400 mm) but did change the dominant flowpaths. Drainage diverted water from surface/near surface routes to depth so that drain storm runoff was lagged by some 30 minutes over undrained site discharge. The drained site also exhibited a more peaky regime, with a maximum daily discharge of 45 mm being almost twice that for the undrained field. At the field and plot scale, the significance of macropore flow was noted. To investigate this in more detail, a tracer experiment was performed on an isolated soil block which had been mole drained and so had enhanced macroporosity. Macropore flow was generated under unsaturated conditions (little matric potential response and no water table was identified). Stable oxygen concentrations were δ 18 O + 3. 5 and - 5. 8 in tracer and background water respectively. Drainflow indicated that there was rapid interaction between applied tracer and soil water (peak flow δ 18 O - 1. 1). Thus, the matrix-macropore interface was not a boundary between two separate domains of old and new water, high and low conductivity but a site of rapid interchange and mixing. Temporal variability of soil status and malric water composition, also indicated that limited areas of the matrix were capable of transmitting rapid flow. It became clear that even in a heavy clay soil such as that found at Rowden, where macropore flow was promoted by drainage operations, the matrix still had an important role to play. On the basis of potential, soil moisture and observation of tracers, it is proposed that discrete (finger-like) volumes of the matrix are capable of rapid water transmission. Although it was frequently impossible to relate moisture content and soil water potential because instrumentation monitored different volumes of soil, hysteretic soil moisture behaviour over the <b>drainage</b> <b>season</b> was evident in both data sets. This study confirmed the importance of rapid subsurface runoff generation mechanisms on drained soils, but noted that discontinuous translatory flow in the matrix and macropore flow occurred and that the two ‘domains’ were inextricably linked. Further work should be undertaken at the detailed scale to elucidate the soil characteristics which promote rapid runoff mechanisms and the consequences for water quality, especially where the soil subsurface represents a major reservoir (e. g. nitrates).

This study investigated the effi cacy of such practices in reducing NO 3 leaching from a spring barley (Hordeum vulgare L.) system in the Barrow River valley, southeast Ireland. The study compared the eff ect of two tillage systems (plow-based tillage and noninversion tillage) and two over-winter alternatives (no vegetative cover and a mustard cover crop) on soil solution NO 3 concentrations at 90 cm depth over two winter <b>drainage</b> <b>seasons</b> (2003 / 04 and 2004 / 05). Soil samples were taken and analyzed for inorganic N. During both years of the study, the use of a mustard cover crop signifi cantly reduced NO 3 losses for the plowed and reduced cultivation treatments. Mean soil solution NO 3 concentrations were between 38 and 70 % lower when a cover crop was used, and total N load lost over the winter was between 18 and 83 % lower. Results from this study highlight the importance of drainage volume and winter temperatures on NO 3 concentrations in soil solution and overall N load lost. It is suggested that cover crops will be of particular value in reducing NO 3 loss in temperate regions with mild winters, where winter N mineralization is important and high winter temperatures favor a long growing season...|$|R

40|$|Leaching of solutes such as nitrate from soil {{to surface}} water and {{groundwater}} is {{of environmental and}} economic concern. Leaching experiments were conducted both in the laboratory using large intact soil cores (230 mm diameter; 250 mm depth) and in the field using a mole-pipe drained Tokomaru silt loam soil under pasture. In the laboratory experiments 'tracers' (tritium, bromide or chloride) were applied as pulse or step-change inputs to the soil surface during steady flow. A transfer function model, based on a probability density function (pdf), which characterised solute travel between inlet and outlet surfaces in terms of cumulative drainage, was used to predict solute movement. Using tracer model parameters, leaching of indigenous chloride was reasonably predicted, but the leaching of indigenous nitrate could not be modelled satisfactorily. This was apparently due to the dynamic nature and spatial variability of the biological transformations to which nitrate is subject in soil. In the field experiment solid sodium bromide and urea were applied in autumn 1990 to adjacent drained paddocks, each 0. 125 ha in area. Soil, suction-cup and drainage samples were collected regularly during the drainage seasons of 1990 and 1991. The average amounts of drainage collected were 250 mm in 1990 and 320 mm in 1991, but the average amounts of nitrate leached were 47 and 20 kg N/ha, respectively. The results indicate the importance of source-strength for nitrate in N leaching loss. The nitrate-N concentration was around 35 g N m- 3 in the early drainage, well above the WHO limit of 10 g N m- 3, but dropped to around 2 g N m- 3 later in the <b>drainage</b> <b>season.</b> About 8 % of the applied N, but 52 % of the applied bromide, was leached during the 1990 <b>drainage</b> <b>season.</b> This shows the important effect that biological reactions such as immobilization can have in reducing nitrate leaching. Comparisons were made between solute concentrations of suction-cup solution, soil extracted solution, and the drainage. For non-reactive solutes such as bromide (an applied solute) and chloride (an indigenous solute) die suction cup data provided better estimates of the solute concentration in the drainage than did the soil solution data. For nitrate, neither of these two measurements could estimate accurately solute concentrations in the drainage. The solute leaching data obtained in the field were modelled using transfer functions. The bromide and chloride data were {{used to calculate the}} pdf of solute travel times. For chloride, an exponential pdf fitted the data slightly better than a lognormal pdf, despite it having only one rather than two fitted parameters. The chloride pdf appeared to be similar for both 1990 and 1991. For bromide, the inferred pdf conformed to a log-normal distribution and was quite different from the pdf derived from the chloride data. It seems that assuming a pulse (Dirac delta) flux input for a surface-applied solid fertilizer is not valid, and that this is the reason for the discrepancy between the pdfs obtained using the bromide and chloride data. When the pdf derived from the chloride data was used to model nitrate leaching, the result was generally disappointing...|$|E

40|$|International audienceArtificial {{drainage}} {{has been}} subject to widespread criticism because of its impact on water quality and because there is suspicion {{that it may have}} detrimental effects on flood genesis. The present work aims at {{a better understanding of the}} mechanisms controlling infiltration and surface runoff genesis, particularly in soils with artificial drainage and affected by surface crusting. A field experiment was conducted during one <b>drainage</b> <b>season</b> (November 2003 –March 2004) in the Brie region (80 km east of Paris, France) on a subsurface drained silty soil. Water table elevation and surface runoff were monitored above the drain and at midpoint between drains. Soil water pressure head was measured at various depths and locations between the midpoint and the drain. Soil surface characteristics (microtopography and degree of structural and sedimentary crust development) were recorded regularly on the experimental site and on other plots of various drainage intensities. The results show that the first surface runoff events were induced by high water table. However, runoff was higher at midpoint between the drains because water table reached the soil surface at that point, thus considerably reducing infiltration capacity compared to that above the drain. Comparing different plots, the area with older drainage installation (1948) yielded the most surface runoff. Wider drain spacing, smaller drain depth and possible plugging may have led to a greater area of saturated soil between drains. During the winter period, the impact of raindrops induced the formation of a structural crust on the soil surface. Furthermore, the development of the sedimentary crust, which was favored by water actually flowing on the soil surface during the high water table periods could be correlated with surface runoff volume. The formation of this crust had a significant impact on runoff occurrence at the end of the winter. Therefore, poorly drained fields presented more favorable conditions for both Horton type runoff and saturation excess runoff. Drainage effectively reduces surface runoff occurrences not only by lowering the water table in winter but also by limiting soil surface sealing...|$|E
40|$|The paper {{presents}} a simplified model called PESTDRAIN. It simulates pesticide transport in a subsurface tile-drained field. It computes surface runoff and tile-drainage flow rates, {{along with the}} associated pesticide concentrations, with a variable event-driven time step. PESTDRAIN consists of three coupled modules: SIDRA, SIRUP and SILASOL. SIDRA and SIRUP are the water flow simulation modules in the saturated and unsaturated zones, respectively. SIDRA follows a simplified physically based approach while SIRUP follows a conceptual capacitive approach. SILASOL is the solute transport module for both the saturated and unsaturated zones {{and is based on}} transfer functions. It includes simple representations of adsorption and degradation of pesticides. PESTDRAIN was tested on field data sets collected for three <b>drainage</b> <b>seasons</b> at the La Jaillière experimental site in north-western France, for the wheat herbicides isoproturon (IPU) and diflufenican (DFF). After model calibration, relative errors for drainage and surface runoff flows over the season were 14 % and 4 %, respectively, and the Nash-Sutcliffe efficiency coefficient (N) value for drainage discharge was 0. 58. A fair reproduction of a high temporal resolution IPU concentration data set in drainage discharge was also obtained (N = 0. 28). For the validation data sets, PESTDRAIN was able to simulate accurately drainage discharge with Nash-Sutcliffe efficiency coefficients of 0. 57 and 0. 69. The global N was 0. 44 for all flow-weighted average weekly concentrations in drainage. Relative errors for the pesticide losses were 2. 5 % and 35 % (IPU), and 60 % (DFF).

Journal of Soil Science, 41 (2), 189 - 198. A {{study of the}} leaching of sulphate, chloride, nitrate and the associated cations was carried out over two winter periods on three mole-drained paddocks on a yellow-grey earth (Tokomaru silt loam). The paddocks were occasionally grazed by sheep. At {{the beginning of each}} <b>drainage</b> <b>season</b> potassium chloride (KCl) and sulphur fertilizer, as either single superphosphate (SSP) or elemental sulphur (S°), were applied to two of the paddocks, while the third served as a control. The amount of KCl applied was 200 kg ha- 1 yr- 1, while sulphur was applied at 50 kg S ha- 1 in 1988 and 30 kg S ha- 1 1989. Drain flow from the fertilized paddocks was measured with V-notch weirs, and sampled using proportional samplers. Large differences in the total drainage flow were measured in the two years, with values of approximately 280 mm in 1988 and 110 mm in 1989. Significant amounts of the chloride added through both fertilizer and rainfall were leached, amounting to approximately 105 kg Cl ha- 1 yr- 1. The leaching of sulphate-S depended on the form of S fertilizer applied, the quantity of drainage, and the rate of mineralization. Leaching losses of 17 and 3. 4 kg S ha- 1 were measured from the SSP and S° fertilized paddocks, respectively, in 1988, and 9. 4 and 3. 5 kg S ha- 1 in 1989. The study showed that applying SSP just before the <b>drainage</b> <b>season</b> increased leaching losses of sulphate-S substantially. Although the particle sizes of S° used in both years were much bigger than those specified by the Ministry of Agriculture and Fisheries of New Zealand, there appeared to be no difference in the yield response to S applied either as SSP or as S°. The reduced leaching of S when applied as S° resulted from the slow oxidation of S° to sulphate-S. Relatively little nitrate-N was leached, the amount ranging from 11 to 17 kg N ha- 1 yr- 1. Losses of potassium were less than 10 kg K ha- 1 yr- 1, despite the large quantity applied as KCl fertilizer immediately before winter. However a large amount of calcium was leached, between 31 and 52 kg ha- 1 yr- 1. The amount of magnesium leached was between 9 and 15 kg ha- 1 yr- 1. A considerable quantity of sodium was leached, around 58 kg ha- 1 in 1988, and 31 kg Na ha- 1 in 1989, roughly equal to the input in rainfall. Good mass balances were obtained for both chloride and sulphate. The measured moles of negative and positive charge from cations and anions in the leachate were also almost equal. Three models were developed for the leaching of chloride and sulphate-S. An approach dividing the soil water into mobile-immobile phases, and using a fairly detailed soil water flow model was developed. The model was able to simulate the concentration of chloride in the drainage closely, even just after the application of chloride fertilizer, and during highly preferential flow conditions induced by heavy rain. A transfer function model, assuming a log-normal probability density function (pdf) of solute travel pathway lengths, was able to simulate the leaching of chloride reasonably well in 1988. The prediction was less satisfactory in 1989 and during highly preferential flow. By adapting the pdf for chloride to sulphate and by taking adsorption of sulphate into account, the model could predict the sulphate concentration in the drainage quite successfully. A simpler model, using the idea that the two-dimensional flow geometry to the mole drain implies that the drainage concentration approximately equals the average soil solution concentration, was also developed. Despite its simplicity it was able to simulate the leaching of chloride and sulphate as well as the transfer function model. Irrespective of the model being used, the net mineralization rate of soil organic sulphur emerged as an important factor in predicting the leaching of sulphate...|$|E

The experimental treatments included two poultry manure treatments, applied on an N basis at target rates of 168 kg N ha− 1 (PM) and 336 kg N ha− 1 (PM 2), each with three replications, and one chemical fertilizer treatment of urea ammonium nitrate (UAN) at a rate of 168 kg N ha− 1 with two replications. Actual manure application rates and estimated plant available N (PAN) varied annually. Bray 1 -P methods were used to analyze deep core soil samples at five depths (0 – 15, 15 – 30, 30 – 60, 60 – 90, and 90 – 120 cm), which were collected in the spring and fall on the half of each plot planted to corn. Tile drainage samples were collected from each actively draining plot equipped throughout the spring and fall <b>drainage</b> <b>season</b> each year, and PO 4 -P concentrations were analyzed. The results of this study indicated PM 2 and PM resulted in a statistically significant increase in topsoil P at 0 – 30 cm, with no significant movement of P to deeper soil depths.

Poultry manure application at agronomical recommended application rates may be an environmentally sound fertilizer option for tile drained fine-loamy, calcareous soils under a corn-soybean rotation. However, surface runoff was not evaluated in this study, and high P levels in topsoil could contribute to elevated PO 4 -P runoff losses...|$|E
40|$|The loss of {{nutrients}} to the aquatic environment caused by the irrigation of farm dairy effluent (FDE) is a prominent and contentious feature of dairy farming in New Zealand. This thesis investigates management practices and technologies with potential to reduce nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) losses in drainage water from mole and pipe drained dairy pasture soils irrigated with FDE. Farm dairy effluent management was both monitored, using remote sensing technologies, and modelled on a case study farm. During the winter and spring of 2008, an estimated 7, 890 m 3 of FDE was applied {{in excess of the}} soil water deficit (SWD). System constraints were the cause of about two-thirds (5, 070 m 3) of this over-applied FDE volume. It was estimated that as much as 502 kg TN and 83 kg TP could have been lost to surface waters due to inadequate infrastructure. The two main system constraints were the farm’s insufficient FDE storage capacity (2, 000 m 3) and the inability of the farm’s irrigator to apply small application depths (< 8 mm). Furthermore, this study highlighted the significant loss {{of nutrients}} that can occur under FDE irrigation and reinforced the need for tools to assist farmers with FDE management. A number of tools were developed to help farmers manage FDE irrigation. The use of a soil water balance, incorporating actual farm daily rainfall, is an effective method for informing the scheduling of FDE irrigations. Also, the risk of over-application of FDE to soils caused by travelling irrigator breakdowns or stoppages was substantially reduced by the use of a breakdown alert and automatic shut-off system developed and evaluated in this study. Given the elevated risk of P losses from soils treated with FDE, a method of capturing P from drainage waters was investigated. A field experiment was conducted to quantify the ability of Papakai tephra, installed into mole and pipe drainage systems, to remove P from drainage waters. This drainage system reduced TP losses in drainage by about 50 % (c. 0. 14 kg P/ha) over a <b>drainage</b> <b>season,</b> which equated to a 2. 8 kg P reduction for a 20 -hectare effluent block. As farmers frequently crop effluent block soils, the effect of summer forage cropping on nutrient losses was quantified. The practice of spring cultivating long-term dairy pasture, summer forage cropping and autumn regrassing increased the quantity of TN measured in drainage water, over three drainage seasons (2006 to 2008), by 84 % (21 kg N/ha), compared to long-term pasture. If this study had commenced in spring with a more typical pattern of rainfall and drainage, this increase is estimated to have only been about 23. 7 % (5. 9 kg N/ha). Based on these results, summer forage cropping is estimated to increase whole-farm drainage water N losses by about 5 %, when 10 % of a farm’s area is cultivated each year. Of the management practices and technologies studied, the greatest opportunity to reduce the losses of N and P to surface water from the case study farm’s effluent block, is through investment in FDE system infrastructure, particularly adequate storage capacity, and the use of decision support and fail-safe tools to assist the implementation of deficit irrigation of FDE...|$|E

40|$|Metals {{transport}} in the Sacramento River, northern California, from July 1996 to June 1997 {{was evaluated}} {{in terms of}} metal loads from sam-ples of water and suspended colloids that were collected on up to six occasions at 13 sites in the Sacramento River Basin. Four of the sampling periods (July, September, and November 1996; and May–June 1997) took place during relatively low-flow conditions and two sampling periods (December 1996 and January 1997) took place during high-flow and flooding conditions, respec-tively. This study focused primarily on loads of cadmium, copper, lead, and zinc, with secondary emphasis on loads of aluminum, iron, and mercury. Trace metals in acid mine drainage from abandoned and inactive base-metal mines, in the East and West Shasta mining districts, enter the Sacramento River system in predominantly dis-solved form into both Shasta Lake and Keswick Reservoir. The proportion of trace metals that was dissolved (as opposed to colloidal) in samples collected at Shasta and Keswick dams decreased in the order zinc ≈ cadmium 3 ̆e copper 3 ̆e lead. At four sampling sites on the Sacramento River— 71, 256, 360, and 412 kilometers downstream of Keswick Dam—trace-metal loads were predomi-nantly colloidal during both high- and low-flow conditions. The proportion of total cadmium, copper, lead, and zinc loads transported to San Francisco Bay and the Sacramento–San Joaquin Delta estuary (referred to as the Bay–Delta) {{that is associated with}} mineralized areas was estimated by dividing loads at Keswick Dam by loads 412 kilometers downstream at Freeport and the Yolo Bypass. During moderately high flows in December 1996, mineralization-related total (dissolved + colloidal) trace-metal loads to the Bay–Delta (as a percentage of total loads meas-ured downstream) were cadmium, 87 percent; copper, 35 percent; lead, 10 percent; and zinc, 51 percent. During flood conditions in January 1997 loads were cadmium, 22 percent; copper, 11 percent; lead, 2 percent; and zinc, 15 percent. During irrigation <b>drainage</b> <b>season</b> from rice fields (May–June 1997) loads were cadmium, 53 percent; copper, 42 percent; lead, 20 percent; and zinc, 75 percent. These estimates must be qualified by the following factors: (1) metal loads at Colusa in December 1996 and at Verona in May–June 1997 generally exceeded those determined at Freeport during those sampling periods. Therefore, the above percentages represent maximum estimates of the apparent total proportion of metals from mineralized areas upstream of Keswick Dam; and (2) for logistics reasons, the Sacramento River was sampled at Tower Bridge instead of at Freeport during January 1997. Available data suggest that trace metal loads from agricultural drainage may be significant during certain flow conditions in areas where metals such as copper and zinc are added as agri-cultural amendments. Copper loads for sampling periods in July and September 1996 and in May– June 1997 show increases of dissolved and colloidal copper and in colloidal zinc between Colusa and Verona, the reach of the Sacramento River along which the Colusa Basin Drain, the Sacramento Slough, and other agricultural return flows are tributaries. Monthly sampling of these two agricultural drains by the USGS National Water-Quality Assessment Program shows seasonal variations in metal concentrations, reaching maximum concentrations of 4 to 6 micrograms per liter in “dissolved” (0. 45 -micrometer filtrate) copper concentrations in May 1996, December 1996, and June 1997. The total (dissolved plus colloidal) load of copper from the Colusa Basin Drain in June 1997 was 18 kilograms per day, whereas the copper load in Spring Creek, which drains the inactive mines on Iron Mountain, was 20 kilograms per day during the same sampling period. For comparison, during the January 1997 flood, the copper load in Spring Creek was about 1, 100 kilograms per day and the copper load in the Yolo Bypass was about 7, 300 kilograms per day. The data clearly indicate that most copper and zinc loads during the January 1997 flood entered the Sacramento River up-stream of Colusa, and upstream of the influence of the most intense agricultural drainage return flows in the Sacramento River watershed. This study has demonstrated that some trace metals of environmental significance (cadmium, copper, and zinc) in the Sacramento River are transported largely in dissolved form at upstream sites (below Shasta Dam, below Keswick Dam, and at Bend Bridge) proximal to the mineralized areas of the West Shasta and East Shasta mining districts. In contrast, these trace metals are transported largely in colloidal form at downstream sites (Colusa, Verona, Freeport, and Yolo Bypass). Aluminum, iron, and lead were observed to be transported predominantly in the colloidal phase at all mainstem Sacramento River sampling sites during all sampling periods in this study. Despite continuous water treatment, which has removed 85 to 90 percent of the cadmium, copper, and zinc from the mine drainage at Iron Mountain, Spring Creek remains a significant source of these metals to the Sacramento River system...|$|E

The research results showed that corn had grown well during peak dry season period (October) in which water table was at – 50 cm below soil surface, whereas water table depth was dropped to – 70 cm below soil surface in land without subsurface drainage. This condition implied that installation of sub-surface <b>drainage</b> at dry <b>season</b> had function as water retention, not as water discharge.

40|$|Relatively little {{information}} {{is available on the}} spatial distribution of soil water under drip irrigation, and how it is affected by root distribution, emitter placement and irrigation amounts. We hypothesize that variables such as emitter position relative to the active roots as well as irrigation amount and frequency will affect the soil water regime in general, and specifically the spatial and temporal changes in soil water content as controlled by root water uptake and leaching. A better understanding of these interrelationships will provide alternative means for proper and efficient drip irrigation water management practices. Moreover, the present study will provide an extensive database which can serve as input for analytical or numerical modelling of drip-irrigated trees. We present the results of a field study in which the soil water regime of a surface drip irrigated almond tree is investigated. The experimental site (6. 6 m X 4. 8 m) was intensively instrumented with tensiometers and neutron probe access tubes to infer the three-dimensional distribution of soil water and root water uptake during the irrigation <b>season.</b> <b>Drainage</b> fluxes were estimated from measured hydraulic head gradients and hydraulic conductivity data. Unsaturated hydraulic conductivity were determined from in situ measurements by the instantaneous profile method, and in the laboratory using the multi-step outflow method.

Moreover, soil water content data demonstrated temporal changes in the water uptake patterns.

40|$|With {{increasing}} air {{temperatures and}} changing precipitation patterns forecast for the Arctic {{over the coming}} decades, the thawing of ice-rich permafrost is expected to increasingly alter hydrological conditions by creating mosaics of wetter and drier areas. The objective {{of this study is}} to investigate how 10 years of lowered water table depths of wet floodplain ecosystems would affect CO 2 fluxes measured using a closed chamber system, focusing on the role of long-term changes in soil thermal characteristics and vegetation community structure. Drainage diminishes the heat capacity and thermal conductivity of organic soil, leading to warmer soil temperatures in shallow layers during the daytime and colder soil temperatures in deeper layers, resulting in a reduction in thaw depths. These soil temperature changes can intensify growing-season heterotrophic respiration by up to 95  %. With decreased autotrophic respiration due to reduced gross primary production under these dry conditions, the differences in ecosystem respiration rates in the present study were 25  %. We also found that a decade-long drainage installation significantly increased shrub abundance, while decreasing Eriophorum angustifolium abundance resulted in Carex sp. dominance. These two changes had opposing influences on gross primary production during the growing season: while the increased abundance of shrubs slightly increased gross primary production, the replacement of E. angustifolium by Carex sp.  significantly decreased it. With the effects of ecosystem respiration and gross primary production combined, net CO 2 uptake rates varied between the two years, which can be attributed to Carex -dominated plots' sensitivity to climate. However, underlying processes showed consistent patterns: 10 years of drainage increased soil temperatures in shallow layers and replaced E. angustifolium by Carex sp., which increased CO 2 emission and reduced CO 2 uptake rates. During the non-growing <b>season,</b> <b>drainage</b> resulted in 4 times more CO 2 emissions, with high sporadic fluxes; these fluxes were induced by soil temperatures, E. angustifolium abundance, and air pressure...|$|R
40|$|In the {{irrigated}} western U. S. {{disposal of}} drainage water {{has become a}} significant economic and environmental liability. Development of irrigation water management practices that reduce drainage water volumes is essential. One strategy combines restricted drainage outflow (by plugging the drains) with deficit irrigation to maximize shallow groundwater consumption by crops, thus reducing drainage that needs disposal. This approach is not without potential pitfalls; upward movement of groundwater in response to crop water uptake may increase salt and sodium concentrations in the root zone. The purposes for this study were: to observe changes in the spatial and temporal distributions of SAR (sodium adsorption ratio) {{and salt in a}} field managed to minimize drainage discharge; to determine if in situ drainage reduction strategy affects SAR distribution in the soil profile; and to identify soil or management factors that can help explain field wide variability. We measured SAR, soil salinity (EC 1 : 1) and soil texture over 3 years in a 60 -ha irrigated field {{on the west side of}} the San Joaquin Valley, California. At the time we started our measurements, the field was beginning to be managed according to a shallow groundwater/drainage reduction strategy. Soil salinity and SAR were found to be highly correlated in the field. The observed spatial and temporal variability in SAR was largely a product of soil textural variations within the field and their associated variations in apparent leaching fraction. During the 3 -year study period, the percentage of the field in which the lower profile (90 - 180 cm) depth averaged SAR was above 10, increased from 20 to 40 %. Since salinity was increasing concomitantly with SAR, and because the soil contained gypsum, sodium hazard was not expected to become a limiting factor for long term shallow groundwater management by drain control. It is anticipated that the technology will be viable for future <b>seasons.</b> <b>Drainage</b> control Shallow groundwater management Sodium...|$|R

A field experiment was conducted to investigate the effects of drainage and tillage during the winter fallow season on CH 4 and N 2 O emissions and to develop mitigation options. The experiment had four treatments: NTND, NTD (drainage but no tillage), TND (tillage but no drainage), and TD (both drainage and tillage). The study was conducted from 2010 to 2014 in a Chinese double-rice field. During winter, total precipitation and mean daily temperature significantly affected CH 4 emission. Compared to NTND, drainage and tillage decreased annual CH 4 emissions in early- and late-rice seasons by 54 and 33  kg CH 4  ha − 1  yr − 1, respectively. Drainage and tillage increased N 2 O emissions in the winter fallow season but reduced it in early- and late-rice seasons, resulting in no annual change in N 2 O emission. Global warming potentials of CH 4 and N 2 O emissions were decreased by 1. 49 and 0. 92  t CO 2  eq.  ha − 1  yr − 1, respectively, and were reduced more by combining drainage with tillage, providing a mitigation potential of 1. 96  t CO 2  eq.  ha − 1  yr − 1.

40|$|The Pilbara {{region of}} Western Australia is an arid zone with an {{abundance}} of wetlands, ranging from springs and river pools to salt marshes, claypans, rockpools and gnammas. The Pilbara is also rich in mineral resources, which are being heavily exploited, and most of the region is under pastoral lease, with both land uses potentially having an impact upon aquatic systems. In order to provide information for improved conservation planning, including environmental impact assessment and reserve system design, a survey of wetland fauna was undertaken {{as part of a broader}} biodiversity survey of the region. This paper describes patterns in the distribution of the region’s aquatic invertebrate diversity and identifies environmental correlates of those patterns. Invertebrates and environmental variables were surveyed at 100 wetlands in spring and autumn between 2003 and 2006. The Pilbara appears to have a particularly diverse fauna for an arid zone, with just over 1000 species collected, an average of 94 species per sample and a maximum sample richness of 226 species. About a fifth of the fauna is known to date only from the Pilbara. The remaining species are western endemics, occur elsewhere in northern and/or inland Australia, or have continental or wider distributions. Most species seem to be widespread in the Pilbara region but rare and/or restricted elements are present, especially in some permanently flowing springs, including those in Millstream and Karijini National Parks, and in ephemeral wetlands such as Fortescue Marsh and freshwater claypans. Faunal composition was not strongly correlated with <b>season,</b> <b>drainage</b> divides, stream order or previously recognised bioregional boundaries.

40|$|The {{last decade}} {{has been a}} period of great {{expansion}} and land use intensification for the New Zealand dairy farming industry with a 44 % increase in national dairy cow numbers. Intensive dairy farming is now {{considered to be a}} major contributor to the deterioration in the quality of surface and ground water resources in some regions of New Zealand. Previous research has demonstrated intensive dairy farming is responsible for accelerated contamination of wateways by nutrients, suspended solids, pathogenic organisms and faecal material. A number of common dairy farming practices increase the risk of nutrient leaching. In particular, farm dairy effluent (FDE) has been implicated as a major contributor to the degradation of water quality. With the introduction of the Resource Management Act in 1991, the preferred treatment for FDE shifted away from traditional two-pond systems to land application. However, on most farms, irrigation of FDE has occurred on a daily basis, often without regard for soil moisture status. Therefore, it has been commonplace for partially treated effluent to drain through and/or runoff soils and contaminate fresh water bodies. The objectives of this thesis were to design and implement a sustainable land application system for FDE on difficult to manage, mole and pipe drained soils, and to assess the impacts of FDE application, urea application and cattle grazing events on nutrient losses via artificial drainage and surface runoff from dairy cattle grazed pasture. To meet these objectives a research field site was established on Massey University's No. 4 Dairy farm near Palmerston North. The soil type was Tokomaru silt loam, a Fragiaqualf with poor natural drainage. Eight experimental plots (each 40 x 40 m) were established with two treatments. Four of the plots represented standard farm practice including grazing and fertiliser regimes. Another four plots were subjected to the same farm practices but without the fertiliser application and they were also irrigated with FDE. Each plot had an isolated mole and pipe drainage system. Four surface runoff plots (each 5 m x 10 m) were established as subplots (two on the fertilised plots and two on the plots irrigated with FDE) in the final year of the study. Plots were instrumented to allow the continuous monitoring of drainage and surface runoff and the collection of water samples for nutrient analyses. An application of 25 mm of FDE to a soil with limited soil water deficit - simulating a 'daily' irrigation regime - resulted in considerable drainage of partially treated FDE. Approximately 70 % of the applied FDE left the experimental plots with 10 mm of drainage and 8 mm of surface runoff. The resulting concentrations of N and P in drainage and runoff were approximately 45 % and 80 % of the original concentrations in the applied FDE, respectively. From this single irrigation event, a total of 12. 1 kg N ha- 1 and 1. 9 kg P ha- 1 was lost to surface water representing 45 % of expected annual N loss and 100 % of expected annual P loss. An improved system for applying farm dairy effluent to land called 'deferred irrigation' was successfully developed and implemented at the research site. Deferred irrigation involves the storage of effluent in a two-pond system during periods of small soil moisture deficits and the scheduling of irrigation at times of suitable soil water deficits. Deferred irrigation of FDE all but eliminated direct drainage losses with on average < 1 % of the volume of effluent and nutrients applied leaving the experimental plots. Adopting an approach of applying 'little and often' resulted in no drainage and, therefore, zero direct loss of nutrients applied. A modelling exercise, using the APSlM simulation model, was conducted to study the feasibility of practising deferred irrigation at the farm scale on No 4 Dairy farm. Using climate data for the past 30 years, this simulation exercise demonstrated that applying small application depths of FDE, such as 15 mm or less, provided the ability to schedule irrigations earlier in spring and decreased the required effluent storage capacity. A travelling irrigator, commonly used to apply FDE (a rotating irrigator), was found to have 2 - 3 fold differences in application depth and increased the risk of generating FDE contaminated drainage. New irrigator technology (an oscillating travelling irrigator) provided a more uniform application pattern allowing greater confidence that an irrigation depth less than the soil water deficit could be applied. This allowed a greater volume to be irrigated, whilst avoiding direct drainage of FDE when the soil moisture deficit is low in early spring and late autumn. A recommendation arising from this work is that during this period of low soil water deficits, all irrigators should be set to travel at their fastest speed (lowest application depth) to minimise the potential for direct drainage of partially treated FDE and associated nutrient losses. The average concentrations of N and P in both 2002 and 2003 winter mole and pipe drainage water from grazed dairy pastures were all well above the levels required to prevent aquatic weed growth in fresh water bodies. Total N losses from plots representing standard farm practice were 28 kg N ha- 1 and 34 kg N ha- 1 for 2003 and 2004, respectively. Total P losses in 2003 and 2004 were 0. 35 kg P ha- 1 and 0. 7 kg P ha- 1, respectively. Surface runoff was measured in 2003 and contributed a further 3. 0 kg N ha- 1 and 0. 6 kg P ha- 1. A number of common dairy farm practices immediately increased the losses of N and P in the artificial drainage water. Recent grazing events increased NO 3 [...] N and DIP concentrations in drainage by approximately 5 mg litre- 1 and 0. 1 mg litre- 1, respectively. The duration between the grazing and drainage events influenced the form of N loss due to a likely urine contribution when grazing and drainage coincide, but had little impact on the total quantity of N lost. Nitrogen loss from an early spring application of urea in 2002 was minimal, whilst a mid June application in 2003 resulted in an increased loss of NO 3 [...] N throughout 80 mm of cumulative drainage suggesting that careful timing of urea applications in winter is required to prevent unnecessary N leaching. Storage and deferred irrigation of FDE during the lactation season caused no real increase in either the total-N concentrations or total N losses in the winter drainage water of 2002 and 2003. In contrast, land application of FDE using the deferred irrigation system resulted in a gradual increase in total P losses over the 2002 and 2003 winter <b>drainage</b> <b>seasons.</b> However, this increase represents less than 4 % of the P applied in FDE during the lactation season. An assessment of likely losses of nutrients at a whole-farm scale suggests that it is standard dairy farming practice (particularly intensive cattle grazing) that is responsible for the great majority of N and P loss at a farm scale. When expressed as a proportion of whole-farm losses, only a very small quantity of N is lost under an improved land treatment technique for FDE such as deferred irrigation. The management of FDE plays a greater role in the likely P loss at a farm scale with a 5 % contribution to wholefarm P losses from deferred irrigation...|$|R
40|$|The {{study in}} this thesis {{concerns}} Storglaciären, a very well known and studied glacier in northern Sweden. The glacier has been an object for research since the endof the 19 th century. During the meltseason of 2012 25 dyetracing experiments were executed. These experiments were conducted to investigate the internal drainage system of Storglaciären in the lower ablation area. Similar studies were done in 1989 by Regine Hock and Roger Leb Hooke (1993). The outcome of the study in 2012 has been compared with their results {{to see if any}} changes in the drainage systemhave occurred. The results have also been compared to the results of Seaberg etal. (1988) from their experiments in 1984 and 1985. Studies of glacier behaviour are important since they have a large impact on the local and global environment. Moreover it has been observed that smaller glaciers (such as Storglaciären), that are easier to reach and to work on, have similar behaviour as bigger glaciers, making them good objects for research (Jansson, 1996). The experiments were conducted between the 6 th and 24 th of august and executed by first injecting dye into moulins on the glacier and then measuring the concentration of dye in the proglacial streams merging out from the front of Storglaciären. Rhodamine WT was used as dye. Storglaciären has three main pro-glacialstreams named Nordjåkk, Centerjåkk and Sydjåkk. Nordjåkk merges from the northside and the other two from {{the south side of the}} glacier front. Measurements were in the beginning taken in all of the streams but since no concentration was visible in Nordjåkk the focus was at the end of the fieldperiod only at Centerjåkk and Sydjåkk, which both had detectable dye concentrations. Both manual and automatical measurements were done. Breakthrough curves (concentration vs. time) were plotted for each experimentand for both Centerjåkk and Sydjåkk. From these curves calculations were donefollowing the methods in Willis et al. (2011). The main parameters calculatedwere: transit velocity, dispersivity and dye recovery. Breakthrough curves were also modelled for each experiment using the method in Willis et al. (1990). Overall the drainage system in the lower part of the ablation area of Storglaciärenhas not changed signicantly during the past 20 years. But the drainage systemseems to be divided into dierent parts using both a straight channel system and a distributed system. The distributed system of 2012 seems to be more homogeneous than in 1989 but whether the system is braided or consists of a linked cavity systemis hard to tell. Differences seen this year compared to previous investigations are that the transition from an early to a late <b>season</b> <b>drainage</b> system occurred later in the meltseason. The dominating subglacial stream in 2012 was Centerjåkk and not Sydjåkk as in previous investigations (Nordjåkk dominated north as before). The meltseason lasted only a few weeks in 2012 because of the cold conditions and low precipitation. This may have had a big inuence on the behaviour of the glacier...|$|R

It Due to these factors the Government of Pakistan realized to implement a Participatory Irrigation Management (PIM) approach through the involvement of water users (i. e. farmers) in managing irrigation and drainage system at secondary and tertiary levels. Over past 10 years, like many other developing countries, including India, Sri Lanka, Philippines, Turkey, and Chile, farmer participation has become an important and evolving component of irrigation and drainage management in Pakistan. Out of the four provinces of, Pakistan the devolution process of irrigation reforms and management transfer has become significant in Sindh LBOD is one such project, cost and maintenance. This research investigates to confirm whether the farmers have socio-economically benefited through farmer participation process. The research also highlights the issues relating mainly to governance in the irrigation and drainage sector in Pakistan that poses threats to the viability of farmer participation. Further, this study aimed at examining the extent of accomplishment of the under-going comprehensive institutional reform process including maintenance & operations of irrigation infrastructure. The study is scientifically designed and is based on multi-staged sampling, with clusters pertaining to drainage types and target farmers. Total number of all drains (i. e. deep tube-wells, scavenger wells, interceptor drains and tile drains) were stratified by their type in the project component areas(i. e. Nawabshah, Sanghar, and Mirpurkhas). Using sampling methods based on probability proportion to size, weighting technique were used to select sample of drainage in each project component. While selecting number of sample drains in each drain type, a careful approach was applied to ensure that representative number was included in the sample. For this, the sample was chosen by using a ratio of approximately 4. 9 percent out of total drain types in the LBOD project area. Analysis of key variables such as the cropping intensities, cultivation patterns, and crop use by types of <b>drainage</b> and <b>seasons,</b> reveals that cropping intensities remained higher in Rabi season as compared to Kharif. Wheat in Rabi and cotton in Kharif dominates in terms of area cultivated under these crops. These crops are further followed by rice and sugarcane. Data also shows that all three drainage modes have substantially contributed towards cultivation of crops in the area. Data also shows that current performance of drainage facilities, including deep tube-wells, scavengers, interceptors and tile drains, has increasingly raised questions as to the reliability of irrigation supplies and control of salinity and water logging objectives of the LBOD project are concerned. It is argued that drainage is as necessary as irrigation for land cultivation, control of salinity and water logging, and soil fertility. Thus, application of drainage techniques for controlling salinity and water logging as well as maintaining irrigation supplies through sub-surface and vertical (tube-well) drainage types are necessary to address a number of issues, such as controlling water-table depths, ground water quality, soil improvement, and crop yields enhancement. The study also shows that lack of water, salinity and water logging and soil fertility have adversely affected the land cultivation patterns, cropping intensity, cropping output and crop incomes earned by the farmers. On the whole, crop production in the LBOD area is badly affected by the factors, mentioned above. For example, the average yield of rice (i. e. metric ton/ hectare) is about 38 percent less in the study area as compared to Sindh Province. Similarly, the yields of wheat and cotton (i. e. metric ton/hectare) are about 35 and 34 percent respectively below the provincial average. The study concludes that farmer participation is a practical solution for improving the performance of LBOD installations. It is also observed through this research that along with planning and implementation dimensions of the LBOD project, the farmers be given required training, assistance and technical know how to takeover the responsibility of operation and maintenance (O&M). Study shows that 60 : 40 percent ratio of distributing resources generated through abiana would only effectively work if farmers are provided with adequate powers to use resources for O&M. Presently, this ratio is only on paper none of the FOs currently are in a position to utilize their 40 percent share of abiana independently...|$|R
