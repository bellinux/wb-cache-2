In February, 63,000 jobs were lost, a five-year record. To aid with the situation, Bush signed a $170billion economic stimulus package which was intended to improve the economic situation by sending tax rebate checks to many Americans and providing tax breaks for struggling businesses. The Bush administration pushed for significantly increased regulation of Fannie Mae and <b>Freddie</b> <b>Mac</b> in 2003, and after two years, the regulations passed the House but died in the Senate. Many Republican senators, as well as influential members of the Bush Administration, feared that the agency created by these regulations would merely be mimicking the private sector's risky practices. In September 2008, the crisis became much more serious beginning with the government takeover of Fannie Mae and <b>Freddie</b> <b>Mac</b> followed {{by the collapse of}} Lehman Brothers and a federal bailout of American International Group for $85billion.|$|E

When Beck asked Bevin about the issue during an interview, Bevin said {{the content of the}} report had been written by the fund's chief investment officer, and that he had only signed it because he was legally required to do so as president of the fund. Later, Bevin added that he had not physically signed the letter, but that his signature was added to the document digitally.

40|$|Using {{individual}} {{data from}} <b>Freddie</b> <b>Mac's</b> portfolio of conventional mortgages, this paper estimates prepayment probabilities {{as a function}} of characteristics pertaining to the borrower, the loan, regional, and economic variables. Distinction is made between induced and autonomous prepayments. Based on the curvature of the underlying termination pattern, nonparametric methods are derived to estimate the prepayment probabilities and to predict a mortgage life under various scenarios. The findings point to a response asymmetry with respect to the level and trend of interest rates. Non-interest effects reveal the significance of the borrower's characteristics, property age, and regional mobility rates on mortgage termination. ...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{reviews the}} policy {{response}} to the 2007 – 09 financial crisis {{from the perspective of}} a senior Treasury official at the time. Government agencies faced severe constraints in addressing the crisis: lack of legal authority for potentially helpful financial stabilization measures, a Congress reluctant to grant such authority, and the need to act quickly in the midst of a market panic. Treasury officials recognized the dangers arising from mounting foreclosures and worked to facilitate limited mortgage modifications, but going further was politically unacceptable because public funds would have gone to some irresponsible borrowers. The suddenness of Bear Stearns’ collapse in March 2008 made rescue necessary and led to preparation of emergency options should conditions worsen. The Treasury saw Fannie Mae and <b>Freddie</b> <b>Mac’s</b> rescue that summer as necessary to calm markets, despite the moral hazard created. After Lehman Brothers failed in September, the Treasury genuinely intended to buy illiquid securities from troubled institutions but turned to capital injections as the crisis deepened. ...|$|R
40|$|Modern {{portfolio}} {{theory is}} increasingly {{being used to}} guide real estate portfolio decisions. However, to obtain meaningful results from complex mathematical techniques, the input data must meet at least two conditions: property values must be measured accurately, and {{the process by which}} property valuations change over time must be known. Neither of these conditions are satisfied by data currently available. This paper closely examines how value is measured and reported for commercial property. Commonly used time-series from NREI, NCREIF and ACLI are found wanting. An index of value using the popular "repeat sales" method is derived using data from <b>Freddie</b> <b>Mac's</b> multifamily portfolio. The focus of this paper is on developing an alternative measure of property performance based on property net operating income. Two cash flow indices are constructed from publicly available data and evaluated. It is recommended that the methodology developed here be used to create cash flow indices that can supplement or replace existing value indices in property analysis. The cash flow indices have much to offer researchers applying option-based models to real estate. ...|$|R

40|$|We {{are deeply}} indebted to Jim Carey for {{providing}} {{us with the}} opportunity to do this research and for sharing his knowledge about counseling, to Oliver Zeng for his outstanding work in developing the loan matching routine, and to Jim Berkovec for his econometric insights and consultation. The views expressed in this paper are ours alone, and do not For the past three decades homeownership counseling has been an integral part of affordable lending in the United States. Counseling’s popularity has been based in large part on the belief that borrowers receiving counseling are better able to handle the responsibilities of homeownership.

This study uses data on almost 40 thousand mortgages originated under <b>Freddie</b> <b>Mac’s</b> Affordable Gold program to pose three questions; does pre-purchase homeownership counseling demonstrably reduce 90 -day delinquency rates, do the different types of prepurchase homeownership counseling programs vary in their effectiveness at reducing delinquency rates, and are any counseling providers more or less effective in administerin...|$|R
50|$|He {{testified in}} favor of {{stronger}} legislation several times and gave numerous speeches which were well chronicled. These efforts were strongly supported by President Bush and Treasury Secretary Paulson. Reform legislation {{was passed by the}} House in May 2007 just as what was then considered only a “subprime crisis” was starting to appear. The Senate, however, did not pass the legislation, entitled the Housing and Economic Recovery Act (HERA) until July 2008. President Bush, who had called for GSE reform throughout his Presidency, signed HERA into law in an Oval Office ceremony on July 30. However, HERA was passed too late as stock market, foreign debt and mortgage-backed securities investors worried about their solvency. Lockhart had pushed both GSE’s to raise more capital for over a year and in March got their Boards to agree to raise significant equity. The new Federal Housing Finance Agency (FHFA) combined OFHEO; the Federal Housing Board, which regulated the 12 Federal Home Loan Banks; and the HUD group that oversaw Fannie Mae's and <b>Freddie</b> <b>Mac's</b> mission and affordable housing goals.

5000|$|Documentation {{and credit}} history {{can be used}} to {{categorize}} loans into high-quality A-paper, Alt-A, and subprime. Loans may also be categorized by whether there is full documentation, alternative documentation, or little to no documentations, with extreme [...] "no income no job no asset" [...] loans referred to as [...] "NINJA" [...] loans. No doc loans were popular in the early 2000s, but were largely phased out following the subprime mortgage crisis. Low-doc loans carry a higher interest rate and were theoretically available only to borrowers with excellent credit and additional income that may be hard to document (e.g. self-employment income). As of July 2010, no-doc loans were reportedly still being offered, but more selectively and with high down payment requirements (e.g., 40%). [...] The following documents are typically required for traditional underwriter review. Over the past several years, use of [...] "automated underwriting" [...] statistical models has reduced the amount of documentation required from many borrowers. Such automated underwriting engines include <b>Freddie</b> <b>Mac's</b> [...] "Loan Prospector" [...] and Fannie Mae's [...] "Desktop Underwriter". For borrowers who have excellent credit and very acceptable debt positions, there may be virtually no documentation of income or assets required at all.

Critics complained that [...] "not a single analyst at either Moody's of S lost {{his job as a}} result of missing the Enron fraud" [...] and [...] "management stayed the same". During the subprime crisis, when hundreds of billion of dollars' worth of triple-A-rated mortgage-backed securities were abruptly downgraded from triple-A to [...] "junk" [...] status within two years of issue, the CRAs' ratings were characterized by critics as [...] "catastrophically misleading" [...] and [...] "provided little or no value".

Despite over a year of rising mortgage deliquencies, Moody's continued to rate <b>Freddie</b> <b>Mac's</b> preferred stock triple-A until mid-2008, when it was downgraded to one tick above the junk bond level. Some empirical studies have also found that rather than a downgrade lowering the market price and raising the interest rates of corporate bonds, the cause and effect are reversed. Expanding yield spreads (i.e., declining value and quality) of corporate bonds precedes downgrades by agencies, suggesting it is the market that alerts the CRAs of trouble and not vice versa.|$|R
40|$|In this study, {{we develop}} and test a {{methodology}} {{to assess the}} impact of affordable lending efforts on homeownership rates. More narrowly, we examine the impact of using flexible underwriting guidelines, primarily changes in the downpayment and housing burden requirements, on the affordability and homeownership propensities of targeted populations and geographic areas. The impacts of changing these underwriting guidelines are compared with those resulting from lower borrowing costs (interest rates). A variation of the methodology first proposed by Wachter et al. (1995) is used in the analysis. We use the 1995 American Housing Survey (AHS) national core in the analysis. The findings indicate that affordable lending efforts are likely to increase homeownership opportunities for underserved populations, but that impacts may not be felt equally by all groups. Under most affordable products, the impacts on all households, recent movers and central city households are smaller than for other households. The recently introduced affordable products which permit the 3 percent downpayment to come from non-borrower sources, e. g., <b>Freddie</b> <b>Mac’s</b> Alt 97, has the largest impact on the homeownership propensities of all underserved groups, including a 27. 1 percent increase in the relative probability of homeownership for young households, a 21. 0 percent increase for blacks, and a 15. 0 percent increase for central city residents. Consistently, changes in underwriting guidelines are found to have greater impacts than changes in the costs of borrowing for all groups. ...|$|R
