5|$|In 2010 {{the kibbutz}} decided after four gatherings {{to appoint a}} team of members to discuss the {{privatization}} of electricity, food, mail, barbershop and cosmetics. Other services were to be kept under {{the responsibility of the}} kibbutz, these include: healthcare, education and welfare. The dispute mainly concerned the privatization of the <b>dining</b> <b>room.</b> <b>At</b> the end of the discussions, most privatization initiatives were rejected, and only a few minor changes that had no practical effect on the collective lifestyle were accepted.|$|E
5|$|Skagens Museum {{was founded}} in the <b>dining</b> <b>room</b> <b>at</b> Brøndums Hotel in October 1908. Victor Christian Klæbel, the local pharmacist, Degn Brøndum, {{proprietor}} of Brøndums Hotel and Anna Ancher's brother, and Michael Ancher, Krøyer and Tuxen were elected to form the first board of governors. After P.S. Krøyer's death in 1909, his house in Skagen Plantation {{was used as a}} museum. In 1919, Degn Brøndum donated the old hotel's garden to Skagens Museum as a site for a new building. Work started in 1926 and was completed in September 1928 when the new museum was officially opened.|$|E

5|$|A {{portrait}} of Marie closely resembling a photograph by Krøyer {{was completed in}} 1891. The following year, it {{was added to the}} frieze in the <b>dining</b> <b>room</b> <b>at</b> Skagen's Brøndums Hotel which had become the artists' favourite meeting place. Placed next to Krøyer's own portrait, it confirmed Marie's position as an accepted member of the Skagen Painters. The dining room was designed by the architects Ulrik Plesner and Thorvald Bindesbøll in connection with the first major expansion of the hotel in 1892. At Krøyer's suggestion, it was decided to incorporate Degn Brøndum's art collection into its decoration. Over the years it became a custom that visiting artists donated portraits of each other to the hotel owner and these were placed in a frieze just under the ceiling. Today the dining room together with its frieze forms part of Skagens Museum.|$|E
5|$|Towards {{the end of}} the 19th century, Skagen {{became the}} summer venue of a group of artists who were {{attracted}} by the way of life in the fishing village and by the opportunities for painting the fishermen and surrounding landscapes. Skagens Museum was founded on 20 October 1908 in the <b>dining</b> <b>room</b> <b>at</b> Brøndums Hotel. Among the founders were artists Michael Ancher, P.S. Krøyer and Laurits Tuxen, who were elected to form the first board of governors together with Victor Christian Klæbel, the local pharmacist, and Degn Brøndum, who was the proprietor of Brøndums Hotel and brother of Anna Ancher. In 1982, the exhibition rooms were extended with an annex designed by the Royal Surveyor, architect Jacob Blegvad. Blegvad also planned the later extension to the museum that was inaugurated in 1989. Today Skagens Museum has more than 1,900 works of art at its disposal.|$|E
5|$|At Queen Square, the Morris {{family lived}} in a flat {{directly}} above the Firm's shop. They were joined by Janey's sister Bessie Burton {{and a number of}} household servants. Meanwhile, changes were afoot at the Firm as Faulkner left, and to replace him they employed a business manager, Warrington Taylor, who would remain with them till 1866. Taylor pulled the Firm's finances into order and spent much time controlling Morris and ensuring that he worked to schedule. During these years the Firm carried out a number of high-profile designs; from September 1866 to January 1867, they redecorated the Armoury and Tapestry Room in St. James' Palace, in the latter year also designing the Green <b>Dining</b> <b>Room</b> <b>at</b> the South Kensington Museum (it is now the Morris Room at the Victoria and Albert Museum). The Firm's work received increasing interest from people in the United States, resulting in Morris's acquaintance with Henry James and Charles Eliot Norton. However, despite its success, the Firm was not turning over a large net profit, and this, coupled with the decreasing value of Morris' stocks, meant that he had to decrease his spending.|$|E

5|$|Krøyer's {{paintings}} of Marie between 1888 and 1906 present {{a record of}} the years they spent together. They show some of their most enjoyable times but also hint at the marital tension that increased as time went by. Among the most notable {{paintings of}} her are Summer Evening at Skagen. The Artist's Wife and Dog by the Shore (1892), one of Denmark's most popular works, which shows Marie on the beach with their dog and with the moonlight reflected in the sea, Roses (1893), which depicts her relaxing in the garden, and Summer Evening at Skagen Beach – The Artist and his Wife (1899). Also of note are the depictions of Marie on holiday in Ravello on the Amalfi Coast of Italy in 1890; the portrait for the frieze in the <b>dining</b> <b>room</b> <b>at</b> Skagen's Brøndums Hotel; Chez Moi, a series of watercolours of Marie and the couple's daughter Vibeke in the family homes in Copenhagen and Skagen; and Midsummer Eve Bonfire on Skagen Beach, his last painting of her in which she is shown captured in the firelight with Alfvén.|$|E
5|$|The bridge {{has had a}} long {{association}} with French monarchs seeking to associate themselves with a symbol of Roman imperial power. King Charles IX of France visited in 1564 during his Grand Tour of France and was greeted with a grand entertainment laid on by the Duc d'Uzès. Twelve young girls dressed as nymphs came out of a cave by the riverside near the aqueduct and presented the king with pastry and preserved fruits. A century later, Louis XIV and his court visited the Pont du Gard during a visit to Nîmes in January 1660 shortly after the signature of the Treaty of the Pyrenees. In 1786 his great-great-great-grandson Louis XVI commissioned the artist Hubert Robert to produce a set of paintings of Roman ruins of southern France to hang in the king's new <b>dining</b> <b>room</b> <b>at</b> the Palace of Fontainebleau, including a picture depicting the Pont du Gard in an idealised landscape. The commission was meant to reassert the ties between the French monarchy and the imperial past. Napoleon III, in the mid-19th century, consciously identified with Augustus and accorded great respect to Roman antiquities; his patronage of the bridge's restoration in the 1850s was essential to its survival.|$|E
5|$|Kenwood {{has three}} floors: {{on the ground}} floor during the Lennon period the front door opened onto an {{entrance}} hall, where Lennon placed a suit of armour and a gorilla suit. Across the hall was a large living room, which had black carpets, two 18-foot sofas and a marble fireplace. To the left of the hall was a toilet, and through the living room was a dining room, where purple, velvet wallpaper was put up. Adjacent to the <b>dining</b> <b>room,</b> <b>at</b> the back of the house, was a small sunroom. This was decorated with various pictures, caricatures and stickers, such as the one from the Safe as Milk debut album (1967) by Captain Beefheart & His Magic Band, and one advertising the Monterey Pop Festival. Photos published by The Beatles Book Monthly show the shelves of the sunroom filled with articles such as a large, ornate cross, a Mickey Mouse doll and a mortar and pestle, reportedly used by Lennon to mix various combinations of cocaine, amphetamine, barbiturates and LSD. There was also a yellow sofa or chaise-longue upon which Lennon would spend much of his time. It was a present from his aunt, Elizabeth Smith (née Stanley) also known as Mimi. Behind the sunroom was the split-level kitchen where state-of-the-art appliances were installed, so complex that a tutor had to come and give the Lennons lessons in their use.|$|E

25|$|Shortly {{after his}} {{ascension}} to the throne, Louis XVI presented the Petit Trianon to Marie Antoinette. Immediately thereafter, the queen ordered modificationlargely {{under the direction}} of Richard Miqueto the Petit Trianon and its gardens. The house was remodeled, which necessitated the removal of the dumbwaiter system that Louis XV installed that allowed the dining table to be lowered to the kitchen level of the house, thus eliminating the need for servants in the <b>dining</b> <b>room.</b> <b>At</b> this time, the jardins botaniques were removed to Paris and the Hameau de la reine constructed in their stead.|$|E

50|$|The {{architect}} {{of the house is}} thought to have been James Elmes (1782-1862), who is known to have submitted a design for Oakwood, the house opposite Sennicotts, and who lived at Oving, West Sussex nearby. Elmes was a friend of Sir John Soane, and artchitectural features such as the entrance hall, which is cube shaped and has a ceiling of shallow ‘groined’ vaulting, is very similar to Soane’s drawing <b>room</b> <b>at</b> Aynhoe Park. The ends of the hall are in the form of shallow apses, with marbled niches, and below the bold cornice runs an egg-and-dart moulding. Both the drawing and <b>dining</b> <b>rooms</b> <b>at</b> Sennicotts have coved ceilings with a bead moulding on the ceiling flat, and an unusual leaf enriched torus moulding at the cornice.|$|R

500|$|Derek Taylor (Apple's press officer) {{said that}} Aspinall hated being {{stuck in the}} Apple office (at 3 Savile Row) all through the {{recording}} of The White Album and Let It Be album. Life in the Apple office, however, was improved by having a chef and various assistants at hand: [...] "The liquor bill was £600 per month and the food bill was close to that." [...] This was mostly due to Aspinall's and Peter Brown's four-course lunches with expensive wines in the <b>dining</b> <b>room</b> <b>at</b> Apple. After Allen Klein {{was brought in to}} be the Beatles' manager Aspinall was dismissed, but reinstated after complaints from the group, and because Klein realised that Aspinall was no threat to his control of the company.
