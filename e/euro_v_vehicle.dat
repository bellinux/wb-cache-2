40|$|AbstractIn {{this paper}} we report the first direct {{measurements}} of nitrogen dioxide (NO 2) in the UK using a vehicle emission remote sensing technique. Measurements of NO, NO 2 and ammonia (NH 3) from almost 70, 000 vehicles were made spanning vehicle model years from 1985 to 2012. These measurements were carefully matched with detailed vehicle information data {{to understand the}} emission characteristics {{of a wide range}} of vehicles in a detailed way. Overall it is found that only petrol fuelled vehicles have shown an appreciable reduction in total NOx emissions over the past 15 – 20 years. Emissions of NOx from diesel vehicles, including those with after-treatment systems designed to reduce emissions of NOx, have not reduced over the same period of time. It is also evident that the vehicle manufacturer has a strong influence on emissions of NO 2 for Euro 4 / 5 diesel cars and urban buses. Smaller-engined Euro 4 / 5 diesel cars are also shown to emit less NO 2 than larger-engined vehicles. It is shown that NOx emissions from urban buses fitted with Selective Catalytic Reduction (SCR) are comparable to those using Exhaust Gas Recirculation for <b>Euro</b> <b>V</b> <b>vehicles,</b> while reductions in NOx of about 30 % are observed for Euro IV and EEV vehicles. However, the emissions of NO 2 vary widely dependent on the bus technology used. Almost all the NOx emission from Euro IV buses with SCR is in the form of NO, whereas EEV vehicles (Enhanced Environmentally friendly Vehicle) emit about 30 % of the NOx as NO 2. We find similarly low amounts of NO 2 from trucks (3. 5 – 12 t and > 12 t). Finally, we show that NH 3 emissions are most important for older generation catalyst-equipped petrol vehicles and SCR-equipped buses. The NH 3 emissions from petrol cars have decreased by over a factor of three from the vehicles manufactured in the late 1990 s compared with those manufactured in 2012. Tables of emission factors are presented for NOx, NO 2 and NH 3 together with uncertainties to assist the development of new emission inventories...|$|R

40|$|In this study, <b>Euro</b> <b>V</b> diesel fuel, biodiesel, and ethanol-biodiesel blends (BE) {{were tested}} in a 4 -cylinder direct-injection diesel engine to {{investigate}} the combustion, performance and emission characteristics of the engine under five engine loads at the maximum torque engine speed of 1800 rpm. The results indicate that when compared with biodiesel, the combustion characteristics of ethanol-biodiesel blends changed; the engine performance has improved slightly with 5 % ethanol in biodiesel (BE 5). In comparison with <b>Euro</b> <b>V</b> diesel fuel, the biodiesel and BE blends have higher brake thermal efficiency. On the whole, compared with <b>Euro</b> <b>V</b> diesel fuel, the BE blends could lead to reduction of both NOx and particulate emissions of the diesel engine. The effectiveness of NOx and particulate reductions increases with increasing ethanol in the blends. With high percentage of ethanol in the BE blends, the HC, CO emissions could increase. But the use of BE 5 could reduce the HC and CO emissions as well. Department of Mechanical Engineerin...|$|R
40|$|Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) is {{associated}} with considerable burden of illness at a patient, family and societal level. Although pharmacological treatment is recommended by authoritative guidelines, evidence on its influence on the broader burden of illness is limited. As treatment induces costs, proper healthcare decision making requires evidence on the associated societal costs or benefits and particularly the difference that response to treatment can make. Data on ADHD related resource use of patients 8 - 18 years and parents were collected {{by means of a}} cross-sectional, online survey amongst members of the Dutch parent association. Children were stratified to responders and non-responders to treatment according to pre-defined expert definitions. Analyses were performed on 618 questionnaires (428 responders; 190 non-responders to treatment). Children were 11. 8 years on average and mainly boys (82 %). Total monthly costs for children were euro 578 and euro 839 for responders and non-responders, respectively (p = 0. 021), with a breakdown to direct medical costs (<b>euro</b> 322 <b>vs.</b> <b>euro</b> 512; p = 0. 068), direct non-medical costs (<b>euro</b> 222 <b>vs.</b> <b>euro</b> 296; p = 0. 090), and indirect non-medical costs (<b>euro</b> 34 <b>vs.</b> <b>euro</b> 57; p < 0. 001). For parents, total costs were <b>euro</b> 246 <b>vs.</b> <b>euro</b> 399 for the responding and non-responding children, respectively (p = 0. 006), with a breakdown to direct medical costs (<b>euro</b> 130 <b>vs.</b> <b>euro</b> 211; p = 0. 010) and indirect non-medical costs (<b>euro</b> 116 <b>vs.</b> <b>euro</b> 181; p = 0. 092). Total monthly costs of children and their parents together were euro 824 and euro 1228 for responders and non-responders to treatment, respectively (p = 0. 002). These results stress the importance of a focus on response to treatment, not only beneficial for patients and their family, but also resulting in considerable societal benefits...|$|R

40|$|Improving the {{octane number}} of {{gasoline}} {{offers the potential}} of improved engine combustion, as it permits spark timing advancement without engine knock. This study proposes the use of terpineol as an octane booster for gasoline in a spark ignited (SI) engine. Terpineol is a bio-derived oxygenated fuel obtained from pine tree resin, and {{has the advantage of}} higher calorific value than ethanol. The ignition delay time (IDT) of terpineol was first investigated in an ignition quality tester (IQT). The IQT results demonstrated a long ignition delay of 24. 7  ms for terpineol and an estimated research octane number (RON) of 104, which was higher than commercial European (<b>Euro</b> <b>V)</b> gasoline. The octane boosting potential of terpineol was further investigated by blending it with a non-oxygenated gasoline (FACE F), which has a RON (94) lower than <b>Euro</b> <b>V</b> gasoline (RON =  97). The operation of a gasoline direct injection (GDI) SI engine fueled with terpineol-blended FACE F gasoline enabled spark timing advancement and improved engine combustion. The knock intensity of FACE F +  30 % terpineol was lower than FACE F gasoline at both maximum brake torque (MBT) and knock limited spark advance (KLSA) operating points. Increasing proportions of terpineol in the blend caused peak heat release rate, in-cylinder pressure, CA 50, and combustion duration to be closer to those of <b>Euro</b> <b>V</b> gasoline. Furthermore, FACE F +  30 % terpineol displayed improved combustion characteristics when compared to <b>Euro</b> <b>V</b> gasoline. © 201...|$|R
