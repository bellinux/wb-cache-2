Altogether, these measures meant that beneficiaries were actually better off on the introduction of GST and this in turn reduced inequalities.|$|R
40|$|This Note implores {{states that}} have not already done so {{to opt out of}} the {{provisions}} of the Federal Bankruptcy Code that place explicit limits on the amount a debtor is allowed to exempt from liquidation. By doing so, states will be able to provide debtors who operate their own small business a greater degree of protection from creditors, as those states are entitled to establish their own limit on the value of the tools of a debtor’s trade the debtor may shield in bankruptcy. This Note contends that Congress has evinced an intent within the last decade to restrict the ability of small business debtors to exempt the value of their assets and that federal judges have shown unwillingness to allow states to provide debtors with a choice between federal <b>exemption</b> <b>limits</b> and state <b>exemption</b> <b>limits.</b> Consequently, it is incumbent upon states to expressly opt out of the relevant portions of the Bankruptcy Code to provide their small business debtors the more generous slate of exemption laws that the evidence suggests these states intended to provide in the first instance...|$|R

5000|$|In some states, laws {{provide for}} {{exemptions}} (typically called homestead <b>exemptions)</b> and/or <b>limits</b> on the percentage increase in tax, which limit the yearly increase in property tax so that owner-occupants are not [...] "taxed {{out of their}} homes". Generally, these exemptions and ceilings are available only to property owners who use their property as their principal residence. Homestead exemptions generally cannot be claimed on investment properties and second homes. When a homesteaded property changes ownership, the property tax often rises sharply and the property's sale price may become the basis for new <b>exemptions</b> and <b>limits</b> available to the new owner-occupant.|$|R

25|$|The Tennessee {{income tax}} {{does not apply}} to {{salaries}} and wages, but most income from stock, bonds and notes receivable is taxable. All taxable dividends and interest which exceed the $1,250 single exemption or the $2,500 joint exemption are taxable at the rate of 6%. The state's sales and use tax rate for most items is 7%. Food is taxed at a lower rate of 5.25%, but candy, dietary supplements and prepared food are taxed at the full 7% rate. Local sales taxes are collected in most jurisdictions, at rates varying from 1.5% to 2.75%, bringing the total sales tax to between 8.5% and 9.75%, one of the highest levels in the nation. Intangible property is assessed on the shares of stock of stockholders of any loan company, investment company, insurance company or for-profit cemetery companies. The assessment ratio is 40% of the value multiplied by the tax rate for the jurisdiction. Tennessee imposes an inheritance tax on decedents' estates that exceed maximum single <b>exemption</b> <b>limits</b> ($1,000,000 for deaths in 2006 and thereafter).|$|R
40|$|The {{taxation}} system {{affects the}} fiscal welfare of individuals. Its operation {{is determined by}} a variety of economic, social and political considerations, and its impact depends not only on the tax laws themselves but also on income distribution and inflation. This paper reviews changes in the Australian personal income tax over the period from 1972 / 3 to 1980 / 1. The principal factors, such as <b>exemption</b> <b>limits,</b> tax rates, concessions for dependants and inflation are first dealt with separately, and then their combined effect is reviewed for taxpayers at various levels of income and responsibility for dependants. The general conclusion is that the burden of income tax has increased over the period for all incomes, except for very low earners who have become tax exempt through successive tax reforms. For others, there has been a small relative shift in the tax burden from high earners to those at middle or low income levels; and also a relative shift in the tax burden from taxpayers without dependants to those with dependant children and relatives...|$|R
50|$|When the {{contract}} matures, a tax free bonus is received. The employee can then choose either {{to exercise the}} option to buy the shares with the proceeds from the savings contract, or just to take the proceeds and the bonus. The bonuses are equivalent to fixed rate interest and are set by the Treasury. The savings and bonus are free from income tax. However, an employee {{may have to pay}} Capital Gains Tax (CGT) if they sell their shares and make a profit which takes them above the CGT <b>exemption</b> <b>limit</b> for that year. An employee can transfer shares from the exercise of the option into a stocks and shares ISA, within 90 days of exercising the option. Capital gains made on these shares are then free from tax. There is a limit on the value of shares that can be transferred, and the ISA manager must agree to take them.|$|E
50|$|Beginning at {{the rate}} of 7d. per pound (1842-1854), the income-tax was raised to 1s. 4d. for the Crimean War, and then {{continued}} at varying rates reduced to 2d. in 1874, it rose to 5d., then in 1894 to 8d., and by 1909 appeared to be fixed as a minimum at 1s., or 5% on income from property. The yield per penny on has risen almost uninterruptedly. From £710,000 in 1842, it now exceeds £2,800,000, though the exemptions and abatements are much more extensive. In fact, all incomes of £3 per week are absolutely free (£160 per annum is the precise <b>exemption</b> <b>limit),</b> and an income of £400 derived from personal exertion pays less than 5½d. per pound, or 2¼%. The great productiveness of the tax is equally remarkable. From £5,600,000 in 1843 (with a rate of 7d.) the return rose to £32,380,000 in 1907-1908, having been at the maximum of £38,800,000 in 1902-1903, with a tax rate of 6¼%. The income-tax thus supplies about one-fifth of the total revenue, or one-fourth of that obtained by taxation.|$|E
40|$|In {{this study}} we {{investigate}} {{the impact of the}} thin capitalization rule (TCR), introduced in Germany in 2008, on firms' capital structure, investment and profitability. The identification of the causal effects is based on the escape clauses in the regulation using a difference-in-difference approach. Our results present evidence that firms strongly react {{in order to avoid the}} limited deductibility of interest expenses: They either decrease their debt ratio or split their assets to use the <b>exemption</b> <b>limit.</b> The latter is especially used by firms with an interest result around the <b>exemption</b> <b>limit</b> of the interest barrier. In case the debt ratio is reduced, our results present evidence for a proportional increase of firms' tax base. In general, in the short term, no negative investment effects are caused by the TCR. This suggests that a part of the firms is able to substitute equity for debt at low costs or expects to be able to circumvent the regulation. However, investment might also be fixed in the short-run for example due to long-lasting contracts...|$|E
