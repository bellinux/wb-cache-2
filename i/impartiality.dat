5|$|A {{member of}} the civil service in {{discharge}} of his/her functions is to be guided by maintaining absolute integrity, allegiance to {{the constitution and the}} law of the nation, patriotism, national pride, devotion to duty, honesty, <b>impartiality</b> and transparency.|$|E
5|$|The present modern {{civil service}} was formed after the {{partition}} of India in 1947. It was Sardar Patel's vision that the Civil Service should strengthen cohesion and national unity. The values of integrity, <b>impartiality</b> and merit remain the guiding principles of Indian civil services.|$|E
5|$|As {{keeper of}} the seal, and {{subsequently}} as chancellor, Neville was noted for his <b>impartiality,</b> and he oversaw a number {{of changes in the}} way the chancery operated. Neville was deprived of the Great Seal in 1238 after quarrelling with the king, but continued to hold the title of chancellor until his death. He died in his London palace, built on a street later renamed Chancery Lane owing to his connection with the chancery.|$|E
5|$|Lord Lane, then Lord Chief Justice of England, {{dismissed}} the applications on 13 December 1988, arguing of Raghip {{that the jury}} had had ample opportunity to form its own opinion of him. Amnesty International criticised the decision, pointing to the problems with confessions made {{in the absence of}} a lawyer, and was criticized in turn by Home Secretary Douglas Hurd, who said Amnesty had abandoned its <b>impartiality.</b>|$|E
5|$|Opinion polls {{carried out}} {{indicated}} that the public's confidence in the judiciary and the <b>impartiality</b> of the courts had been shaken {{in light of the}} incident. In the end, after breaching her conditions of probation, Bokhary was jailed for six weeks. On appeal, her driving ban was further extended by two years.|$|E
5|$|Armando Galarraga and Jim Joyce, {{along with}} Daniel Paisner, {{released}} {{a book titled}} Nobody's Perfect, chronicling their experiences {{during and after the}} game. In June 2011, one year after the near-perfect game, Major League Baseball put a rule into effect that Joyce cannot umpire any games in which Galarraga's team plays. Due to the book release, the two are now business partners, and this relationship could affect Joyce's <b>impartiality</b> while umpiring Galarraga's team. It is similar to the policy that prevented umpire Jim Wolf from being the plate umpire in games that his younger brother Randy pitched in.|$|E
5|$|Despite being {{appointed}} by agreement of national governments acting together, the members were to {{pledge not to}} represent their national interest, but rather took an oath to defend the general interests of the Community as a whole. Their independence was aided by members being barred from having any occupation outside the Authority or having any business interests (paid or unpaid) during their tenure and for three years after they left office. To further ensure <b>impartiality,</b> {{one third of the}} membership was to be renewed every two years (article 10).|$|E
5|$|In Tan Liang Joo John, Justice Judith Prakash {{stated that}} this was not a closed list, and that the court is {{entitled}} to take into account all the circumstances of the case which in its view go towards showing bad faith. She also noted that English authorities impose another limit on the content of criticism – that the acts or words in question must neither impute improper motives to nor impugn the integrity, propriety and <b>impartiality</b> of judges or the courts. However, she declined to follow these authorities and averred that to impose such a limit would be unnecessary and potentially over-restrictive of legitimate criticism.|$|E
5|$|Labor unions, politicians, advocates, educators, the NAACP Legal Defense and Educational Fund, {{and human}} rights {{advocacy}} organizations such as Human Rights Watch and Amnesty International have {{expressed concern about the}} <b>impartiality</b> of the trial of Abu-Jamal. Amnesty International neither takes a position on the guilt or innocence of Abu-Jamal nor classifies him as a political prisoner. They are opposed by the family of Daniel Faulkner, the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, the City of Philadelphia, Republican politicians, and the Fraternal Order of Police. In August 1999, the Fraternal Order of Police called for an economic boycott against all individuals and organizations that support Abu-Jamal.|$|E
5|$|Mosley {{came up with}} an {{innovative}} way to dispose of the FIA's involvement in the commercial activities of Formula One. In order to maintain Ecclestone's investment to deliver digital television, he proposed extending Ecclestone's rights for F1 coverage to 100 years from the initial 15, arguing that a deal of such length could not be anti-competition as it was effectively the same as an outright sale. The Commission agreed with his assessment and in the interest of <b>impartiality,</b> Mosley removed himself from the negotiations, which eventually returned around $300 million (£150 million).|$|E
5|$|Perhaps most important, the Analytical Review {{provided}} {{a forum for}} radical political and religious ideas. Although it aimed at <b>impartiality,</b> its articles were often critical of the British government and supportive of the French revolutionaries. While the journal had low circulation numbers for its day, it still influenced popular opinion and was feared by the conservative government of William Pitt the Younger. In late 1797, the Anti-Jacobin, the self-styled nemesis of the Analytical Review, was founded by supporters {{of the government and}} other reactionary interests; it criticized the radical politics of the Analytical and monitored it for unpatriotic and irreligious sentiments.|$|E
5|$|Prior to the deployment, South African {{authorities}} {{threatened to}} veto the involvement of Australian peacekeeping troops because of doubts about their <b>impartiality.</b> This followed the establishment by the Australian Government of a Special Assistance Program for South Africans and Namibians (SAPSAN) in 1986 to assist South Africans and Namibians disadvantaged by apartheid. The focus of SAPSAN was on education and training {{for the people of}} South Africa and Namibia, and some humanitarian assistance had also been provided. A total of $11.9million was spent under SAPSAN from 1986 to 1990.|$|E
5|$|The 1949 trial {{defendants}} {{appealed to}} the Second Circuit Court of Appeals in 1950. In the appeal they raised issues {{about the use of}} informant witnesses, the <b>impartiality</b> of the jury and judge, the judge's conduct, and free speech. Their free speech arguments raised important constitutional issues: they asserted that their political advocacy was protected by the First Amendment, because the CPUSA did not advocate imminent violence, but instead merely promoted revolution as an abstract concept.|$|E
5|$|The general's objectivity, however, {{has often}} been questioned. Vlahogiannis, in his preface to the Memoirs, praises his honesty and {{contrasts}} it to his lack of objectivity and <b>impartiality.</b> While always straightforward, Makriyannis clearly holds a grudge against people he had come into conflict with. He often uses disparaging language against people like Kolokotronis, while staying silent about the more questionable deeds of people he had a favourable opinion of. According to Sphyroeras, however, his judgements do not stem from selfishness, but rather from his severity against those he considered were defaming the cause of Greece.|$|E
5|$|As {{lieutenant}} governor, Collins {{presided over}} the state Senate. Members of both major parties praised Collins for her <b>impartiality</b> and knowledge of parliamentary procedure in this role. She was twice called upon to break tie votes in the Senate, once on a bill allowing the state's teachers to engage in collective bargaining and another on a bill to allow branch banking across county lines within the state; in both instances she voted in the negative, killing the bill. During her tenure, she also chaired the National Conference of Lieutenant Governors, becoming {{the first woman to}} hold that position. In 1982, she was named to the board of regents of the Southern Baptist Theological Seminary in Louisville.|$|E
5|$|Four of {{the five}} {{principal}} organs are located at the main UN Headquarters in New York City. The International Court of Justice is located in The Hague, while other major agencies are based in the UN offices at Geneva, Vienna, and Nairobi. Other UN institutions are located throughout the world. The six official languages of the UN, used in intergovernmental meetings and documents, are Arabic, Chinese, English, French, Russian, and Spanish. On {{the basis of the}} Convention on the Privileges and Immunities of the United Nations, the UN and its agencies are immune from the laws of the countries where they operate, safeguarding the UN's <b>impartiality</b> with regard to the host and member countries.|$|E
5|$|Since {{its initial}} {{resolution}} of July 1960, the UN had issued further resolutions {{calling for the}} total withdrawal of Belgian and mercenary forces from Katanga in progressively stronger terms. By 1961, ONUC comprised nearly 20,000 men. Although their mandate prevented them from taking sides, ONUC had a mandate to arrest foreign mercenaries wherever they encountered them. In September 1961, an attempt to detain a group of Katangese mercenaries without violence during Operation Morthor went wrong {{and turned into a}} fire-fight. ONUC's claim to <b>impartiality</b> was undermined in mid-September when a company of Irish UN troops were captured by numerically superior Katangese forces following a six-day siege in Jadotville. Katanga proceeded to hold the Irishmen as prisoners of war, a development that deeply embarrassed the UN mission and its proponents.|$|E
5|$|The {{arrival of}} the United Nations Operation in the Congo (ONUC) was {{initially}} welcomed by Lumumba and the central government who believed the UN would help suppress the secessionist states. ONUC's initial mandate, however, only covered peacekeeping. Viewing the secessions as an internal political matter, Hammarskjöld refused to use UN troops to assist the central Congolese government against them; he argued that doing so would represent a loss of <b>impartiality</b> and breach Congolese sovereignty. Lumumba also sought {{the assistance of the}} United States government of Dwight D. Eisenhower, which refused. Frustrated, he turned to the Soviet Union, which agreed to provide weapons, logistical and material support. Around 1,000 Soviet military advisors soon landed in the Congo. Lumumba's actions distanced him {{from the rest of the}} government, especially Kasa-Vubu, who feared the implications of Soviet intervention. The Americans also feared that a Soviet-aligned Congo could form the basis of a major expansion of communism into central Africa.|$|E
5|$|The {{match was}} {{originally}} {{scheduled to be}} played on 20 May. However, England manager Sven-Göran Eriksson wanted a four-week break {{before the start of}} the 2006 FIFA World Cup, so that if any England players were involved (Liverpool's Steven Gerrard, Jamie Carragher and Peter Crouch all later made his squad) would get a decent rest before the tournament. The final was scheduled to be held at Wembley Stadium, however the stadium had fallen behind in its rebuild and would not be completed in time for the final. The final would instead be played at the Millennium Stadium in Cardiff, where it had been held since 2001. Mike Dean was originally appointed to referee the final, but questions about his <b>impartiality</b> were raised as he resided close to Liverpool. He was replaced by Alan Wiley.|$|E
25|$|Prior to the Act, {{the main}} means of {{ensuring}} <b>impartiality</b> was by allowing legal {{challenges to the}} sheriff's choices. The new provisions did not specifically aim at establishing <b>impartiality,</b> but {{had the effect of}} reinforcing the authority of the jury by guaranteeing <b>impartiality</b> at the point of selection.|$|E
25|$|The Journals editors {{stress the}} {{independence}} and <b>impartiality</b> of their reporters.|$|E
25|$|Local Swatis {{expressed}} {{approval of}} the act citing much improved decision times and <b>impartiality</b> before the qazi.|$|E
25|$|Since 1927, {{there have}} been {{arguments}} over <b>impartiality</b> at the BBC. Prior to World War II, Sir John Reith excluded Winston Churchill from the BBC airwaves due to his inflammatory statements and reputation for drunkenness. In 1927, under a Royal Charter, the BBC became a public entity {{for the first time}} – with requirements including the need for <b>impartiality</b> and for staff not to express opinions on controversial subject matters.|$|E
25|$|Umar, {{still was}} well known for his {{extraordinary}} will power, intelligence, political astuteness, <b>impartiality,</b> justice and care for poor and underprivileged people.|$|E
25|$|There {{are several}} terms {{being used to}} {{describe}} voluntary student unionism and its opposite, {{each with its own}} frequency, accuracy, <b>impartiality,</b> and favourability.|$|E
25|$|In 2005, Lewis-Smith took {{legal action}} against The Independent {{newspaper}} after it queried the <b>impartiality</b> of his television reviewing; the newspaper published a retraction.|$|E
25|$|According to Al-Biruni his rare <b>impartiality</b> {{is rooted}} in his lack of {{dependence}} on a particular religion. he created a religion and invited others to that.|$|E
25|$|The ICRC drew up seven {{fundamental}} principles in 1965 that were {{adopted by the}} entire Red Cross Movement. They are humanity, <b>impartiality,</b> neutrality, independence, volunteerism, unity, and universality.|$|E
25|$|Violation of the Alabama Canon of Judicial Ethics, {{for failure}} to recuse himself from pending {{proceedings}} in the Alabama Supreme Court after making public comment and placing his <b>impartiality</b> into question.|$|E
25|$|NATO {{said it was}} {{continuing}} its inquiry into the bombing and had appointed three US military officers from outside {{the chain of command}} to handle the investigation to ensure <b>impartiality.</b>|$|E
25|$|Further, the Court of Appeal {{rejected}} two arguments {{raised by}} the Prosecution circumscribing the scope of fair criticism. In the first place, the Court found that fair criticism should {{not be limited to}} criticism that does not question the independence, <b>impartiality</b> and integrity of courts. This would overly restrict the scope of fair criticism and render the concept redundant, given that most allegedly contemptuous statements, by their nature, call into question the independence, <b>impartiality</b> and integrity of the courts. Furthermore, Commonwealth courts have previously held that imputation of judicial impropriety is not ipso facto scandalizing contempt.|$|E
25|$|Daniel Junqua, the {{vice-president}} of the French section of RWB (and also {{vice-president of}} the NGO Les Amis du Monde diplomatique), stated that {{funding from the}} National Endowment for Democracy does not compromise RWB's <b>impartiality.</b>|$|E
25|$|Jury {{selection}} is {{in accordance with}} specific criteria. Prospective jurors may only be asked certain questions, selected for direct pertinence to <b>impartiality</b> or other relevant matters. Any other questions {{must be approved by}} the judge.|$|E
25|$|The {{terms of}} {{employment}} of the staff of international organizations (not commercial) in most cases are not governed {{by the laws of}} the country where their offices are located. Agreements with the host country safeguard these organizations' <b>impartiality.</b>|$|E
25|$|Reith {{admitted}} {{to his staff}} that he regretted the lack of TUC and Labour voices on the airwaves. Many commentators have seen Reith's stance during that period as pivotal in establishing the state broadcaster's enduring reputation for <b>impartiality.</b>|$|E
25|$|Because of the {{importance}} of preventing undue influence on a jury, jury tampering (like witness tampering) is a serious crime, whether attempted through bribery, threat of violence, or other means. Jurors themselves can also be held liable if they deliberately compromise their <b>impartiality.</b>|$|E
