The police traced out {{unregistered}} units and irregularities that led to the accident. In a <b>fire</b> <b>accident</b> in August 2011, seven people were killed and five were seriously injured. A similar <b>fire</b> <b>accident</b> and blast in a private unit in September 2012 killed 40 people and injured 38 others. The common reasons cited for the accidents are inadequate training of workers and supervisors involved in different stages of production and marketing of firecracker items. Other reasons are found to be overstocking of explosives, raw material and finished goods, and employment of workers in excess of the permitted strength.|$|E

The chapel was sacked, and the flames destroyed its facade and part of its north wall. The crypt was not damaged. Most of the floors and fireplaces in the château and all the doors, windows and woodwork were irreparably destroyed.|$|E

40|$|Abstract—Fire {{is crucial}} for the {{development}} of human society, and it has become an important part of human civilization. Among different types of disasters, fire constitutes a significant threat to life and property in urban and rural areas. We have seen several <b>fire</b> <b>accidents</b> such as forest fires, coal fires, gas fires, oil fires and so on and some measurements are taken to prevent these <b>fire</b> <b>accidents.</b> <b>Fire</b> <b>accidents</b> in rural areas are currently viewed {{as one of the greatest}} threats to human life, that results in loss of property and lives. The fire spreads very quickly through out the village and causes great damage before the firefighters arrive to the fire affected area. Hence, this paper proposes a new fire safety system to prevent the <b>fire</b> <b>accidents</b> in rural areas in the initial stage only using wireless sensor networks.

Croatia used them alongside the sole remaining defector for ground attack missions in operations Flash (during which one was lost) and Storm. The only air-to-air action for Croatian MiGs was an attempt by two of them to intercept Soko J-22 Oraos of Republika Srpska Air Force on ground attack mission on August 7, 1995. After some maneuvering, both sides disengaged without firing.|$|E

40|$|The spatial {{distribution}} of urban geographical events is largely constrained by the road network, and research on spatial clusters of <b>fire</b> <b>accidents</b> at the city level {{plays a crucial role}} in emergency rescue and urban planning. For example, by knowing where and when <b>fire</b> <b>accidents</b> usually occur, <b>fire</b> enforcement can conduct more efficient aid measures and planning department can work out more reasonable layout optimization of fire stations. This article proposed an integrated method by combining weighted network-constrained kernel density estimation (NKDE) and network-constrained local Moran’s I (ILINCS) to detect spatial cluster pattern and identify higher-risk locations of <b>fire</b> <b>accidents.</b> The proposed NKDE-ILINCS weighted a set of crucial non-spatial attributes of point events and links, and considered the impact factors of road traffic states, intersection roads and fire severity in NKDE to reflect real urban environment. This method was tested using the fire data in 2015 in Nanjing, China. The results demonstrated that the method was appropriate to detect network-constrained fire cluster patterns and identify high–high road segments. Besides, the first 14 higher-risk road segments in Nanjing are listed. These findings of this case study enhance our knowledge to more accurately observe where <b>fire</b> <b>accidents</b> usually occur and provide a reference for fire departments to improve emergency rescue effectiveness...|$|R

500|$|The port of Nagapattinam {{is in the}} Bay of Bengal in {{the mouth}} of river Kuduvayyar. Nagapattinam was the most {{important}} port of the Chola empire. All the eastern naval expeditions of Rajendra Chola I (1012–44 CE) were through the port. The port was widely used by the Dutch, Portuguese and British as one of the major ports of the Coramandel Coast for trading purposes. Most of the principal exports to Sri Lanka from the port during the British period were rice, piece goods, livestock, cigars, tobacco and hides. The trade of Nagapattinam was mostly with Sri Lanka, Straits Settlements, Burma and to a small extent to the United Kingdom and Spain. The port also served passenger traffic to Singapore, but this was susepended due to a <b>fire</b> <b>accident.</b> The modern day port has a commercial port complex and a dockyard that are protected by a river mouth sand bar facing the port. The port handles only a limited amount of edible oil imports. The Nagapttinam lighthouse is the first conventional [...] lighthouse tower, built inside the port premises by the British in 1869. The port and the lighthouse are maintained by the Tamil Nadu Maritime Board under the Government of India.|$|E
