5|$|Christianity {{had only}} {{recently}} arrived {{in some of these}} kingdoms. Some had been converted by the Gregorian mission, a group of Roman missionaries who arrived in Kent in 597 and who mainly influenced southern Britain. Others had been converted by the Hiberno-Scottish mission, chiefly Irish missionaries working in Northumbria and neighbouring kingdoms. A few kingdoms, such as Dál Riata, became Christian but <b>how</b> <b>they</b> <b>did</b> so is unknown. The native Picts, according to the medieval writer Bede, were converted in two stages, initially by native Britons under Ninian, and subsequently by Irish missionaries.|$|E
25|$|In {{his book}} Psychology of Invention in the Mathematical Field, Hadamard uses introspection to {{describe}} mathematical thought processes. In {{sharp contrast to}} authors who identify language and cognition, he describes his own mathematical thinking as largely wordless, often accompanied by mental images that represent the entire solution to a problem. He surveyed 100 of the leading physicists of the day (approximately 1900), asking them <b>how</b> <b>they</b> <b>did</b> their work.|$|E
25|$|Manobos {{occupied}} hinterland areas we {{now call}} Davao. Originally, they either wrapped the corpse in mat and bamboo slats to hang up on the tree or laid the dead on an elevated station (such as platform) beside the trees. Placing the body on an elevated place was believed to help the dead’s soul reach the heaven. However, after the Americans introducing Abaca plantation system in the 20th century, the custom changed to burying the corpse under the house. Due to the plantation, it became impossible to simply move out from their places like <b>how</b> <b>they</b> <b>did</b> before. For Ata-Manobos occupying the forest areas of Davao, have the unique superstition in teaching Antuk (riddles) other than for wake ceremony will bring misfortune. So in Ata-manobos’ joyful wake custom, close people of the deceased gather and sit around the corpse (in laid down position) and chat, tell stories, sing, dance, play instruments and more to elevate the atmosphere of grief.|$|E

500|$|The next {{successful}} {{crossing of}} South Georgia was in October 1955, by the British explorer Duncan Carse, who travelled {{much of the}} same route as Shackleton's party. In tribute to their achievement, he wrote: [...] "I do not know <b>how</b> <b>they</b> <b>did</b> it, except that they had to — three men of the heroic age of Antarctic exploration with 50feet of rope between them — and a carpenter's adze".|$|E
500|$|The Age of Plastic {{lasts for}} a total length of 36 minutes and 24 seconds. Unable to make the album sound like what was typical of other records {{released}} in the late 1970s, as well as finding it boring, Horn [...] "figured that if I couldn't get records to sound like Elton John, which I couldn't because I couldn't figure out <b>how</b> <b>they</b> <b>did</b> it, then whatever I could do, I'd better exaggerate it." [...] He had also wanted to [...] "perverse things with sound, except that in 1978 and 1979, none of the equipment which would later allow {{me to do that}} was available. So I had to pre-date that technology by finding my own ways of achieving certain sounds." [...] Audio noted the album's sound to be reminiscent of duo Godley & Creme's debut album Consequences.|$|E
500|$|After {{production}} began, the team's {{first task}} {{was to develop a}} new game engine—one that could display a true 3D environment and allow for advanced gameplay. The team abandoned the engine used for the Ultima Underworld games and coded one from scratch in Watcom C/C++, using 32-bit code. The new engine is capable of processing texture maps, sloped architecture and light-emitting objects; and it allows the player to look in any direction, whereas Ultima Underworlds engine was [...] "very limited" [...] in this regard. It also enables the player character to jump, crawl, climb walls and lean, among other things. The designers utilized loopholes in the engine's renderer to create more diverse and striking environments. Despite having coded the renderer, Church said that [...] "at first glance even I couldn't see <b>how</b> <b>they</b> <b>did</b> them". However, this added to the performance issues already being caused by the engine's advanced nature, and the team struggled to optimize the game throughout development. 3D polygonal character models were planned, but they could not be implemented on schedule. Church said that the team's ultimate goal was to create a [...] "rich, exciting, active environment" [...] in which the player could be immersed, and that this required [...] "a coherent story and a world that you can interact with as much as possible." ...|$|E

500|$|Buffalo {{finished}} the following season with another 9–5 record {{and made the}} playoffs as the AFC's wildcard team. The Bills, however, lost their first playoff game against the Pittsburgh Steelers and were eliminated from the tournament. Saban said after the game that the Steelers' offensive domination was the deciding factor. [...] "I'm not sure <b>how</b> <b>they</b> <b>did</b> what they did against us, but they blew us out", he said. Buffalo went on to an 8–6 season in 1975, failing to make the playoffs. After the Bills got out to a 2–3 start in 1976, Saban resigned. He was reportedly angry about how Bills owner Ralph Wilson handled the re-signing of Simpson, who had demanded a trade {{at the beginning of}} the season. Saban was replaced by Jim Ringo, who he had hired as an assistant in 1972. Wilson held a grudge against Saban for the rest of his life after his second resignation, refusing to put Saban on the Bills' Wall of Fame because, in Wilson's words, [...] "he quit on me twice!" [...] Walt Patulski, the Bills' first overall draft pick in 1972, also held ill will toward Saban after Buffalo, believing that Saban tried to force his personality onto Patulski and that the effort effectively ruined his career; Patulski would never speak to Saban again after their respective times in Buffalo, despite multiple opportunities to do so.|$|E
500|$|Lasser {{provided}} {{ideas to}} his authors and commented on their drafts, attempting to improve both {{the level of}} scientific literacy {{and the quality of}} the writing. Some of his correspondence has survived, including an exchange with Jack Williamson, whom Lasser commissioned in early 1932 to write a story based on a plot provided by a reader—the winning entry in one of the magazine's competitions. Lasser emphasized to Williamson the importance of scientific plausibility, citing as an example a moment in the story where the earthmen have to decipher a written Martian language: [...] "You must be sure and make it convincing <b>how</b> <b>they</b> <b>did</b> it; for they have absolutely no method of approach to a written language of another world." [...] On one occasion Lasser's work with his authors extended to collaboration: [...] "The Time Projector", a story which appeared in the July 1931 issue of Wonder Stories, was credited to David H. Keller and David Lasser. Both Lasser and, later, Hornig, were given almost complete editorial freedom by Gernsback, who reserved only the right to give final approval to the contents. This was in contrast to the more detailed control Gernsback had exerted over the content of Amazing Stories in the first years of its existence. Science fiction historian Sam Moskowitz has suggested that the reason was the poor financial state of Wonder Stories—Gernsback perhaps avoided corresponding with authors as he owed many of them money.|$|E

For her stepfather, they noted his and Ashley's tumultuous relationship and <b>how</b> <b>they</b> <b>did</b> not get along with each other.

2500|$|The {{composition}} of the psalms spans at least five centuries, from Psalm 29, possibly adapted from an entire Canaanite hymn to Baal which was transposed into a hymn to Yahweh, to others clearly from the post-Exilic period (not earlier than the 5th cent. B.C.) The majority originated in the southern kingdom of Judah and {{were associated with the}} Temple in Jerusalem, where they probably functioned as libretto during the Temple worship. Exactly <b>how</b> <b>they</b> <b>did</b> this is unclear, although there are indications in some of them: [...] "Bind the festal procession with branches, up to the horns of the altar," [...] suggests a connection with sacrifices, and [...] "Let my prayer be counted as incense" [...] suggests a connection with the offering of incense.
