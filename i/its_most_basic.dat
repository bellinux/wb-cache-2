In <b>its</b> original and <b>most</b> <b>basic</b> form, the Faure sequence suffers from correlations between different dimensions. These correlations result in poorly distributed two-dimensional projections. A standard solution to this problem is to use a randomly scrambled version of the Faure sequence.

We demonstrate the usefulness of our scrambling by means of two-dimensional projections and integration problems. status: publishe...|$|R

25|$|The {{tricarboxylic acid}} (TCA) cycle – or citric acid cycle – is an {{important}} step in cellular respiration. In the TCA cycle, a six carbon sugar will be oxidized. This oxidation produces the CO2 and H2O from the sugar. Plants, fungi, animals and bacteria all use this cycle to convert organic compounds to energy. This is how the majority of soil respiration occurs at <b>its</b> <b>most</b> <b>basic</b> level. Since the process relies on oxygen to occur, this is referred to as aerobic respiration.|$|E
50|$|Humans as Gods (Люди как боги, translit. Lyudi kak bogi) is a 1966 - 1977 {{science fiction}} trilogy by Soviet author Sergey Snegov. Despite being {{initially}} {{intended as a}} parody on space opera, mythological and religious cliché, the novels embody {{a complex set of}} ideas on the fundamental principles of the worlds structure and development, and the directions of the civilizations possible future. While a number of plot elements seem to be taken from the general science fiction concepts, the resulting story is unique in many ways. The central conflicts are {{based on the assumption that}} the face of super-civilization must be defined by its comprehension of the Universe as a whole, by the understanding of <b>its</b> elementary, <b>most</b> <b>basic</b> (and thus <b>most</b> deeply and widely operative) laws. This manner of narration contributes to a clear and powerful interconnection between the initial problems and the story arc.|$|R

25|$|Meanwhile, Slife and Williams {{write that}} one of the hidden {{assumptions}} in CBT is that of determinism, or the absence of free will. They argue that CBT invokes a type of cause-and-effect relationship with cognition.

Nowhere in CBT theory is agency, or free will, accounted for. At <b>its</b> <b>most</b> <b>basic</b> foundational assumptions, CBT holds that human beings have no free will and are just determined by the cognitive processes invoked by external stimuli.|$|E

He became increasingly interested in collage, and began experimenting with the fusion of elements of traditional Japanese collage with more modern techniques, styles, and materials.

25|$|The {{appearance}} of multimodality, at <b>its</b> <b>most</b> <b>basic</b> level, {{can change the}} way an audience perceives information. The most basic understanding of language comes via semiotics – the association between words and symbols. A multimodal text changes its semiotic effect by placing words with preconceived meanings in a new context, whether that context is audio, visual, or digital. This in turn creates a new, foundationally different meaning for an audience. Bezemer and Kress, two scholars on multimodality and semiotics, argue that students understand information differently when text is delivered {{in conjunction with a}} secondary medium, such as image or sound, than when it is presented in alphanumeric format only. This is due to it drawing a viewer’s attention to “both the originating site and the site of recontextualization”. Meaning is moved from one medium to the next, which requires the audience to redefine their semiotic connections. Recontextualizing an original text within other mediums creates a different sense of understanding for the audience, and this new type of learning can be controlled by the types of media used.|$|E

He later joins a traveling carnival in which he becomes enthralled with the mind-boggling performance of the Acrobats of Desire. Following a tragic event, a Lithuanian count, in flight from the wrath of a black pimp, takes Desiderio into his company. With the count, Desiderio narrowly escapes becoming the victim of cannibalism on the African coast before Albertina reveals herself and leads Desiderio through the landscape of Nebulous Time where a community of centaurs adopts the two. However, the couple's lives become endangered yet again and they must flee to Hoffman's castle, where Doctor Hoffman explains his plans to reduce the world into <b>its</b> <b>most</b> <b>basic</b> constituents {{with the help of}} Desiderio and Albertina. While Desiderio loves Albertina, he ultimately chooses reality over the fulfilment of desire when he kills both Doctor Hoffman and his daughter. As a result, Desiderio becomes the proclaimed hero of the Great War. Nevertheless, he continues to long for his dead lover.|$|E
25|$|Combined {{topographical}} and road-maps {{may have}} existed as specialty items in some Roman libraries, {{but they were}} expensive, hard to copy and not in general use. Travelers wishing to plan a journey could consult an itinerarium, which in <b>its</b> <b>most</b> <b>basic</b> form was a simple list of cities and towns along a given road, and the distances between them. It was only a short step from lists to a master list, or a schematic route-planner in which roads and their branches were represented {{more or less in}} parallel, as in the Tabula Peutingeriana. From this master list, parts could be copied and sold on the streets. The most thorough used different symbols for cities, way stations, water courses, and so on. The Roman government from time to time would produce a master road-itinerary. The first known were commissioned in 44 BC by Julius Caesar and Mark Antony. Three Greek geographers, Zenodoxus, Theodotus and Polyclitus, were hired to survey the system and compile a master itinerary; the task required over 25 years and the resulting stone-engraved master itinerary was set up near the Pantheon. Travelers and itinerary sellers could make copies from it.|$|E

25|$|In <b>its</b> <b>most</b> <b>basic</b> form, a color {{broadcast}} can {{be created}} by broadcasting three monochrome images, one each in the three colors of red, green, and blue (RGB). When displayed together or in rapid succession, these images will blend together to produce a full-color image as seen by the viewer. One of the great technical challenges of introducing color broadcast television was the desire to conserve bandwidth, potentially three {{times that of the}} existing black-and-white standards, and not use an excessive amount of radio spectrum. In the United States, after considerable research, the National Television Systems Committee approved an all-electronic system developed by RCA which encoded the color information separately from the brightness information and greatly reduced the resolution of the color information in order to conserve bandwidth. The brightness image remained compatible with existing black-and-white television sets at slightly reduced resolution, while color televisions could decode the extra information in the signal and produce a limited-resolution color display. The higher resolution black-and-white and lower resolution color images combine in the eye to produce a seemingly high-resolution color image. The NTSC standard represented a major technical achievement.|$|E
