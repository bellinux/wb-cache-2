40|$|Abstract [...] Due to {{depletion}} of conventional fuels {{and an increase}} in exhaust emissions at an alarming rate, it is essential to develop an engine which can work on non-conventional fuels and reduce emissions to a greater extent. The present study aims to explore the effects of using ethanol- unleaded gasoline fuel blends on engine performance and exhaust gas emissions in a spark ignition engine. A four-stroke, single cylinder German CT 300 VCR SI engine was used for conducting this study. The ethanol was blended with unleaded gasoline with different percentages of fuel <b>at</b> <b>full</b> <b>throttle</b> <b>opening</b> position and variable engine speed ranging from 1100 - 2000 rpm with an increment of 300 rpm. The engine performance and exhaust gas emissions were evaluated at various engine operating conditions using an engine dynamometer setup. The results showed that blending of unleaded gasoline with ethanol increases the brake torque, brak...|$|R
40|$|Diesel engine {{emissions}} such as CO, NOx, THC {{and smoke}} were evaluated while the engine running with re-formulated Palm Oil Methyl Ester (POME) blended fuel. The fuel was re-formulated by additional additive and blending agent {{in order to}} get better atomization during blending process. A multi cylinder diesel engine was operated from 1000 rpm to 2500 rpm with 50 % load, <b>full</b> <b>throttle</b> <b>opening</b> and fueled by three (3) types of fuel blends which containing 20 % vol POME and 1 % vol to 5 % vol of additive. The additive is the combination of blending agent additive, ester stabilizer and anti-oxidation additive. The result shown that by presence of additive the emissions were decreased generally, especially for NOx and CO emission showed favorable result for POME blended additive fuel. Therefore, by re-formulating POME-diesel blended fuel could reduce poisonous gases from diesel engine combustion. In addition, the use of blended additive by proper composition is capable to increase the stability of the fuels as well as produce better combustion...|$|R
5000|$|Charging {{pressure}} regulation utilises a two coiled three way {{solenoid valve}} pneumatically connected with hoses to the turbo charger’s waste gate, the turbo chargers outlet and the compressor’s inlet. The solenoid valve is electrically supplied from +54 via fuse 13 and {{is controlled by}} the ECU via its pin 26 and pin 2. The control voltage is pulse width modulated (PWM) at 90 Hz below 2500 RPM and 70 Hz above 2500 RPM. The rationale for this change is to avoid resonance phenomena in the pneumatic hoses. By grounding pin2 longer than pin 26 the charging pressure is decreased and vice verse, when pin 26 is grounded longer than pin 2 the charging pressure is increased. To be able to regulate the charging pressure the ECU must at first calculate a requested pressure, a pressure value that the system must strive for. This is done by taking a pre programmed value (matrix of values established in respect of RPM and <b>throttle</b> <b>opening).</b> <b>At</b> WOT the pressure values for each RPM are selected {{to make sure that the}} engine gets the requested torque.|$|R
2500|$|Whilst {{the motor}} vehicle is {{stationary}} and in neutral (N), the driver can select D for drive (after first pressing the foot brake pedal). The transmission's reverse gear is selected {{on the first}} shaft K1, and the outer clutch K2 engages {{at the start of}} the bite point. At the same time, on the alternate gear shaft, the reverse gear clutch K1 is also selected (pre-selected), as the gearbox doesn't know whether the driver wants to go forward or reverse. The clutch pack for second gear (K2) gets ready to engage. When the driver releases the brake pedal, the K2 clutch pack increases the clamping force, allowing the second gear to take up the drive through an increase of the bite point, and thereby transferring the torque from the engine through the transmission to the drive shafts and road wheels, causing the vehicle to move forward. Depressing the accelerator pedal engages the clutch and causes an increase of forward vehicle speed. Pressing the throttle pedal to the floor (hard acceleration) will cause the gearbox to [...] "kick down" [...] to first gear to provide the acceleration associated with first, although there will be a slight hesitation while the gearbox deselects second gear and selects first gear. As the vehicle accelerates, the transmission's computer determines when the second gear (which is connected to the second clutch) should be fully used. Depending on the vehicle speed and amount of engine power being requested by the driver (determined by the position of the throttle pedal), the DSG then up-shifts. During this sequence, the DSG disengages the first outer clutch whilst simultaneously engaging the second inner clutch (all power from the engine is now going through the second shaft), thus completing the shift sequence. This sequence happens in 8milliseconds (aided by pre-selection), and can happen even with <b>full</b> <b>throttle</b> <b>opening,</b> and as a result, there is virtually no power loss.|$|R
40|$|The paper {{focuses on}} the airflow through the {{throttle}} in the Wankel engine (Aixro XR 50). The author's main challenge was to adapt a Wankel engine for hydrogen injection system, which required a very new <b>full</b> electronic <b>throttle</b> to be installed. Thus, an injector adapter and flow meter were mounted in this engine. The engine {{will be used as}} a stationary power unit to generate electricity for small households. Using hydrogen instead of hydrocarbon fuel will reduce the emission of green house gases. The simulation was in the AVL Fire using Computational Fluid Dynamic for 9 different <b>throttle</b> <b>opening</b> angles, i. e. ranging from 20 ° to 90 °, i. e. 20 °, 30 °, 40 °, 50 °, 60 °, 70 °, 80 °, 90 °. The boundary conditions being as the pressure at the inlet and outlet of the throttle module correspond to the real values in the engine. The data on the properties of the flowing medium (air) were selected by default from the AVL Fire library. The authors use the k-zeta-ef model of turbulence to simulate flow through a Wankel engine throttle. The simulation results include the distributions of pressure, velocity and stream lines. The dependence of the mass flow rate {{as a function of the}} throttle position angle was presented. The turbulence disappears when the <b>throttle</b> <b>opening</b> angle of 60 ° is crossed. For <b>full</b> <b>throttle</b> the velocity at the pipe walls decreases to about 12 m/s. The highest velocity throughout the model occurs just where the throttle is mounted...|$|R

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this research is}} to investigate the effect of using unleaded gasoline-ethanol blends on the performance of an unmodified SI engine. A four stroke, four cylinders, water-cooled SI engine (type Toyota, 12 R) with a carburetor fuel system was used for conducting this study. Performance tests were carried out to obtain brake thermal efficiency, brake power, engine torque, brake mean effective pressure and brake specific fuel consumption. In these tests unleaded gasoline-ethanol blends with different percentages of fuel were implemented. Three fuels were used in the tests: 90 Octane unleaded gasoline (E- 0), 95 % gasoline and 5 % ethanol (E- 5), 90 % gasoline and 10 % ethanol (E- 10) and 15 % ethanol and 85 % gasoline (E- 15). Tests were conducted <b>at</b> one-fourth, one-eighth <b>throttle</b> <b>opening</b> positions and <b>at</b> variable engine speed ranging from 500 to 3000 rpm.
