50|$|Innocenti's Lambretta Li 125 Special {{began its}} life in October 1965 with frame numbers {{starting}} from 850001. It inherited the same streamlined body styling from its older sibling the Li 150 Special, which, in turn had inherited its styling from the TV range. These variations included the octagonal <b>headlamp</b> <b>bezel,</b> shortened horn cast grill, front mudguard and side panels with aluminium flashes. The 125 Special emerged {{two years after}} the 150 Special and, although carried a smaller capacity engine, was in fact a more highly tuned machine featuring many improvements over the 150. Just one year before Innocenti introduced the sportier SX range of scooters the 125 Special represented a new level of scooter tuning, a level of tuning that would later be seen in the SX150 and SX200. This is why the 125 Special {{is often referred to as}} the SX125 even though it does not carry an 'X' badge or an SX frame number; though they do share the same larger script 'Lambretta' legshield badge.|$|E
50|$|Outside, the Final Series {{features}} unique 20 inch alloy wheels, a retractable 'Flying B' mascot, body-coloured <b>headlamp</b> <b>bezels,</b> dark tint matrix {{upper and}} lower grilles, lower front wing vents, a 'Jewel-style' fuel filler cap and special badging.|$|R
2500|$|The 1974 {{model year}} brought {{the only major}} body design changes, due to revised front and rear [...] bumper standards-A slanted header panel with a new split grill and {{recessed}} <b>headlamp</b> <b>bezels</b> complement the larger, front 5mph aluminum bumper. Front and rear license plate brackets were relocated and a larger rear 5mph aluminum bumper was used increasing the overall length three inches compared to the 1973 models.|$|R
50|$|Changes to Continental GTC include new more upright front grille, larger {{lower air}} intake, chrome <b>headlamp</b> <b>bezels,</b> retuned Servotronic power {{steering}} for improved feedback and feel, new optional Follow-to-stop, radar-based Adaptive Cruise Control, optional carbon ceramic brakes with 420 mm front and 356 mm rear discs and eight-piston callipers (only available with 20 - inch wheels), two new exterior colours (Aquamarine, Blue Crystal), new interior colour (Aquamarine).|$|R
50|$|The 2015 Durango {{received}} a new package {{available for the}} R/T trim, consisting of a Premium Nappa Leather Group option featuring radar red leather seats, 0.8 in, black <b>headlamp</b> <b>bezels,</b> HID low beams and LED DRLS, optional R/T embroidery on the seats, a nine-speaker sound system with a subwoofer, a 360-horsepower 5.7 L Hemi paired with ZF's eight-speed transmission, and a 20 in Granite Crystal wheel finished in black.|$|R
50|$|The WRX {{received}} an updated interior, body color rocker panels, black painted <b>headlamp</b> <b>bezels,</b> and wheels {{that were previously}} seen on the base US-spec Legacy and a single-port exhaust. Some WRX models have an STI hood scoop that is much larger than other WRX scoops. The suspension has also received a few small updates to make handling more efficient compared to the 2004 model. Cassette players in the stereo system were no longer offered.|$|R
5000|$|The [...] "Blacktop package", {{based on}} SE and SXT, came {{equipped}} with 17-inch polished aluminum wheels with gloss black pockets, a gloss black grille, black <b>headlamp</b> <b>bezels,</b> an all-black interior including headliner, door panels and console, unique black cloth seats and door trim panels with silver accent stitching, a leather-wrapped steering wheel with silver accent stitching and a leather shift knob, choice of 6 body colors (Granite Crystal, Billet Silver, Brilliant Black, Maximum Steel, Redline Red, Bright White). SXT models also include fog lamps.|$|R
50|$|The 1974 {{model year}} brought {{the only major}} body design changes, due to revised front and rear 5 mi/h km/h bumper standards-A slanted header panel with a new split grill and {{recessed}} <b>headlamp</b> <b>bezels</b> complement the larger, front 5 mph aluminum bumper. Front and rear license plate brackets were relocated and a larger rear 5 mph aluminum bumper was used increasing the overall length three inches compared to the 1973 models.A revised rear panel on notchback and hatchback models had new Firebird-styled taillights and ventilation extractor grills were eliminated on trunk and hatch lids.|$|R
50|$|The Barracuda {{used the}} Valiant's 106 in {{wheelbase}} and the Valiant hood, <b>headlamp</b> <b>bezels,</b> windshield, vent windows, quarter panels, doors, A-pillar, and bumpers; {{the trunk and}} some of the glass was new. Utilizing the same hybrid design approach as Ford did turning its Falcon into the Mustang significantly reduced Plymouth's development and tooling cost and time for the new model. The greatest effort was put into creating its distinguishing 14.4 ft² (1.33 m²) rear window, a collaboration between Pittsburgh Plate Glass (PPG) and Chrysler designers that created the largest ever installed on a standard production car to that time.|$|R
2500|$|With Cassini's styling, the new [...] "smooth and slippery" [...] two-door {{featured}} [...] "marks of haute couture" [...] {{with the}} [...] "upholstery, panels and headliner done in jet black, with copper trim pieces, and with carpets and vinyl roof also offered in a copper accent color. The exterior trim included striping, rub rails, wheel covers and special [...] "Oleg Cassini" [...] crest badging mark the Matador as Cassini's." [...] The Cassini Coupes {{were limited to}} black, white, or copper metallic exterior paints, and all came with the vinyl-covered roof. They also featured copper-colored trim in the grille, <b>headlamp</b> <b>bezels,</b> in turbine-type full wheel covers, and within the rear license plate recess.|$|R
50|$|Changes to Continental GT include 35 kg {{reduction}} in kerb weight due primarily to optimisation of suspension and cooling system components, {{increased use of}} aluminium parts in suspension, revised Servotronic power steering for improved feel and feedback, optional fade-resistant carbon ceramic brakes provide improved brake feel (only available on 20-inch wheels), new, more upright front grille and larger lower air intakes give improved airflow to aid engine cooling; chromed <b>headlamp</b> <b>bezels,</b> two new exterior paint colours (Cumbrian Green and Granite), two new leather hide colours (Newmarket Tan and Cumbrian Green), new low-friction dampers, new 'Sport Traction' mode for the Bosch 8.1 ESP system, Bentley 'B' brake pedal.|$|R

50|$|In 1968 Volvo {{introduced}} the 164 as a luxury version of their 140 series. The wings, the grille, the front bumper, the bonnet, the <b>headlamp</b> <b>bezels,</b> {{and the front}} indicators were all unique to the 164; to accommodate the long 3-litre 6-cylinder engine the 164's wings and bonnet were longer {{than those of the}} 4-cylinder 140, but the overall height and width of the 164 were the same as the 140 series. The interior featured a simulated woodgrain dashboard face and leather seating surfaces. Introduced the same year as the BMW E3, the 164 was Volvo's answer to the Mercedes-Benz 250 and Jaguar XJ6. Despite being relatively heavy, the 164 gave favourable fuel economy compared to other 6-cylinder European cars of similar dimensions such as the BMW 530.|$|R
50|$|In 1955 Buick's popular Super {{continued}} {{to combine the}} large C-body interior expanse with medium bracket interiors and performance. Supers had four of the new round VentiPorts per fender this year, with additional series script found on rear quarters and within the deck emblem. The side Sweepspear was unchanged from 1954. The larger bodied Buicks were readily identified by their more rounded contours, straight up windshield pillars and sedan rear quarter windows. Series 50 Super and 70 Roadmaster <b>headlamp</b> <b>bezels</b> also housed parking lights. Inside, a new Red Liner speedometer lay horizontally across the instrument panel. Interiors were trimmed in nylon/Cordaveen combinations, except for the convertible which featured leather seats. Standard Super equipment included trip mileage indicator, electric clock and, on convertibles, a power horizontal seat adjuster. Super sales rose to 132,463.|$|R
2500|$|Automotive {{trends in}} the early middle 1960s had all the US {{automakers}} looking at making compact sporty cars. The Valiant was a natural choice of basis for Chrysler's efforts in this direction. Ford's Mustang gave this type of vehicle its common [...] "pony car" [...] moniker, but in fact Chrysler beat Ford to market by two weeks with the April 1, 1964 release of the Barracuda fastback. The Barracuda used the Valiant's [...] wheelbase and the Valiant hood, <b>headlamp</b> <b>bezels,</b> windshield, vent windows, quarter panels and bumpers; all other sheet metal and glass was new. This hybrid design approach significantly reduced the development and tooling cost and time for the new model. Unfortunately, the Barracuda was as similar to the Valiant as the Mustang {{was different from the}} Falcon, and its introduction was, at first, barely noticed by most buyers.|$|R
50|$|Also new for the 2014 model year, the Grand Caravan R/T gained {{standard}} auto <b>headlamps</b> {{with black}} <b>bezels</b> and the Security Group featuring remote start and security alarm.|$|R
50|$|In 1984 the Sherpa {{became known}} as the Freight Rover 200 Series, and gained square black <b>headlamp</b> <b>bezels</b> with round lamps (later {{replaced}} by the same rectangular headlamps as on the 300 Series), new black plastic bumpers (replacing the previous chrome with embellishers item), rounder wheel arches, redesigned rear door hinges, door handles, door shape and repositioned indicators (raised from the rear bumper to the hips on all panelled models thereafter). Alongside the original bodystyle there was a new wide-bodied variant - the 300 series, available in a choice of three wheelbase lengths. Of the 300 Series the 285 and 310 models were single wheel, the 300 and 350 models being twin. While capacity for the 200 series remained at 5.4 m³ (190 cu. ft), that of the 300 series ranged from 7.6 m³ (268 cu. ft) to 11.4 m³ (402 cu. ft), depending on the combination of wheelbase and roof profile (a high-roof was an option for the lwb 310 and 350 models).|$|R
5000|$|Styling {{changes for}} the sedan and wagon {{included}} new front fender caps on the same fenders as used since 1969, and hood, grille, bumpers, rear fascia, instrument panel, interior trim, hood ornament, and a new font for the Ambassador nameplate. The grille showed off a new squared-off loop-type design surrounding the circular recessed quad headlights, and featured a forward-protruding center. The insert held a crosshatch pattern dominated by two thick horizontal bars that connected the headlight bezels and contained new parking lights between them. These parking lights had amber lenses, followed the grille protrusion forward, and were overlaid by the grille's crosshatch trim. <b>Headlamp</b> <b>bezels</b> were once again blacked out in their recessed areas. The new hood and front bumper followed the grille's central protrusion forward, giving the car a slight [...] "coffin nose" [...] look. The contemporary Matador saw a similar frontal treatment, but with a much more pronounced effect and with different single headlamp clusters, hood, and grille insert.|$|R
5000|$|Model year 1956 saw a mild {{facelift}} {{with a more}} up-to-date grille, <b>bezeled</b> <b>headlamps,</b> larger front {{indicator lights}} and revised side trim. The ´56 reached {{a top speed of}} 140 km/h and consumed [...]|$|R
5000|$|For 1976, models had 300 changes. A {{facelift}} included revised {{header panel}} with Chevy bowtie emblem, wider grill, revised <b>headlamp</b> <b>bezels</b> - all in corrosion-resistant material - and new tri-color taillights for the notchback and hatchback (although the amber turn signals were nonfunctional). Cooling and durability of the Dura-Built 2.3-liter engine were improved. The chassis received the Monza's upgraded components including box-section front cross-member, larger {{front and rear}} brakes (with the fronts gaining vented rotors), and torque-arm rear suspension. Extensive anti-rust improvements to the body included galvanized fenders and rocker panels. New models were introduced: GT estate wagon, Cabriolet notchback (with a half-vinyl roof and opera windows similar to the Monza Towne coupe) and limited-edition Nomad wagon with restyled side windows. New options included BorgWarner five-speed manual overdrive transmission and houndstooth seat trim named [...] "sport cloth" [...] at an additional $18. A [...] "Sky-Roof" [...] with tinted reflecting sliding glass and an eight-track tape player were options from January. The Cosworth was canceled in July after 1,446 1976 models.|$|R
5000|$|For 1974, {{the major}} {{exterior}} changes were a revised front end and 5 mph rear bumper, increasing overall length 6 in, and a slanted front header panel with recessed <b>headlamp</b> <b>bezels.</b> Louvered steel replaced the egg-crate plastic grille. Front and rear aluminum bumpers with inner steel spring replaced the chrome items, with license plate mountings relocated. A revised rear panel on notchback and hatchback models had larger single-unit taillights, with ventilation grills eliminated from trunk and hatch lids. A [...] fuel tank replaced the [...] tank. Side striping replaced {{the hood and}} deck stripes for the GT sport stripes option. The custom interior's wood-trimmed molded door panels were replaced by vinyl door panels matching the seat trim. January saw plastic front fender liners added after thousands of fenders were replaced under warranty on 1971-1974 models. In February the [...] "Spirit of America" [...] limited-edition hatchback was introduced, with white exterior, white vinyl roof, blue and red striping on body sides, hood and rear-end panel, emblems on front fenders and rear panel, white [...] "GT" [...] wheels, A70-13 raised white-letter tires, white custom vinyl interior and red accent color carpeting. Seventy-five hundred Vegas were built through May. Sales peaked at 460,374 for the 1974 model year.|$|R
5000|$|The Lancer {{wheelbase}} {{and body}} shell were {{identical to those}} of the Valiant, but interior and exterior trim were fancier on the Lancer. Lancers featured round taillights and a full-width grille, instead of the Valiant's cat's-eye taillights and central grille. For 1961, trim levels were the basic [...] "170" [...] and the premium [...] "770". In 1961, the two-door hardtop was marketed only as the [...] "Lancer 770 2-Door Hardtop". For 1962, the hardtop model was marketed as the [...] "GT 2-Door Hardtop" [...] and carried premium trim. Two-tone paint was available and instead of the front bench seat, there were two bucket seats. Also for the 1962 model, [...] "Lancer GT" [...] medallions were mounted on the doors' interior trim panels below the vent window and {{on the sides of the}} front fenders just aft of the headlamps. [...] "GT" [...] emblems were placed on the hood, the deck lid and on the vinyl dash pad. The <b>headlamp</b> <b>bezels</b> and the grille's horizontal slats were blacked-out. The GT also lacked certain ornamentation found on the 170s and 770s such as the [...] "Lancer" [...] door scripts, the slanted chrome hash marks on the lower quarter panel, and the hook-ended stainless steel door-to-fender spears.|$|R
5000|$|The 1971 model saw minor styling changes, mostly cosmetic. The <b>headlamp</b> <b>bezels</b> {{were more}} of a squircle shape with {{rectangular}} front parking lamps, the grille had no horizontal divider and the openings were rectangular-shaped, the hood spear included a stand-up ornament with “Chevrolet” script lettering, the trunk lock keyhole had the Monte Carlo Crest surrounding it, and the tail lights now had two horizontal and one vertical chrome strips. Inside, the SS model got new [...] "European symbol knobs", and a four-spoke steering wheel became optional. Mechanically it was largely unchanged, although the small-block Turbo-Fire 400 two-barrel engine was dropped. Other engines had compression ratios lowered to allow the use of regular leaded, low-lead, or unleaded gasoline, per a GM corporate edict. Engine ratings fell to 245 hp (183 kW) for the base Turbo-Fire 350 CID (5.7 L) two-barrel, 270 hp (201 kW) for the Turbo-Fire 350-4V, and 300 hp (224 kW) for the Turbo-Jet 400. The SS 454 engine was actually raised to a nominal 365 gross hp (272 kW) despite the reduction in compression ratio. This increase in horsepower {{was a result of}} the 454 engine using the more aggressive camshaft from the 390 hp 454 used in the 1970 Chevrolet Corvette and full-sized sedans.|$|R
5000|$|... 1973 models {{featured}} significantly enlarged [...] "elephant foot" [...] taillamps {{mounted in}} reshaped rear fenders. In the engine bay, the oil-bath air cleaner {{gave way to}} a dry element filter, and the generator was replaced with an alternator. The 1302/Super became the 1303 with a new taller wrap-around windscreen. The changes to the cowl and windshield resulted in slight redesign of the front hood. The instrument panel, formerly shared with the standard Beetle, was all-new and incorporated a raised speedometer pod, rocker-style switches and side-window defrosters. The limited-edition GSR (Gelb-Schwarzer Renner; German for [...] "Yellow-Black Racer") was a 1303 S available only in Saturn Yellow paint equipped with special 5.5 in wide sport wheels fitted with 175/70-15 Pirelli Cinturato CN36 high-performance radial tires. Front and rear deck lids were finished in matte black, as was all exterior trim {{with the exception of the}} chrome <b>headlamp</b> <b>bezels.</b> Inside were corduroy and leatherette high-bolstered sport seats and a small diameter three-spoke steering wheel with padded leather rim and a small red VW logo on the bottom spoke. In North America, the GSR was sold as the Super Beetle Sports Bug. The North American model had body-color deck lids and was available in Marathon Blue Metallic in addition to Saturn Yellow. In some markets, the sport wheels (in both 4.5-inch and 5.5-inch widths), sport steering wheel and sport seats became available as stand-alone options.|$|R
5000|$|Based on the [...] {{high-power}} version, it {{had several}} unique exterior features. These include {{a choice of}} two exclusive colours (Copper Red Mica 400 and Phantom Blue Mica 100), unique dark silver 18 × 8J alloy wheels, a polished aluminium Rotary crest on the front air dam, dark silver <b>bezel</b> <b>headlamps,</b> sports door mirrors, polished aluminium side air outlet fins, Rotary branded B-pillar trims, chrome exhaust surrounds.|$|R
50|$|Changes to Continental Flying Spur include: A new, more upright grille and bolder {{lower air}} intake, chromed <b>headlamp</b> <b>bezels,</b> {{optional}} bright chrome matrix lower grille, new rear bumper with wraparound brightware and black valance and bright tail lamp bezels, acoustic glass to side and rear windows, new acoustic tri-laminate undertray and wheelarch liners, retuned exhaust system, revised spring, anti-roll bar and damper settings; a new bespoke 19-inch Pirelli UHP tyre from 2008 Continental GT Speed, new design 19-inch 5-spoke alloy wheels, retuned Servotronic power steering, new 'Sport Traction' mode from ESP 8.1 system, optional fade-resistant carbon ceramic brakes (only available on 20-inch wheels), optional radar-based full-speed range Adaptive Cruise Control with {{stop and go}} (Follow-to-Stop), optional Naim for Bentley audio system (1100 Watt amplifier, 15 custom-built Naim speakers including dual Naim sub-woofers, next-generation Digital Signal Processor), optional glovebox-located iPod, MP3 & USB infotainment system interface; new optional full width rear seat with electrically adjustable outboard positions and fixed central seat, park distance control system, optional contemporary style marquetry with crossbanding to door waistrails (Walnut & Chestnut veneers only), optional traditional style marquetry with crossbanding and inlay to fascia, door waistrails and upper centre console (Walnut & Chestnut veneers only), new chrome inlay strip to door waistrails, new two tone interior hide colour options, 2 new interior hide colours (Linen and Imperial Blue), seat piping now available in 16 colours, 3 new standard body colours (Havana, White Sand and Onyx) and duo-tone paint combinations (Havana, Dark Sapphire, Onyx and Midnight Emerald), optional rear-seat configuration with fully adjustable outboard positions and a fixed central seat, optional seat ventilation.|$|R

US models also included sequentially numbered GT3-R sill treadplates.|$|R
50|$|In 1972 {{a modest}} frontal {{revision}} placed {{more emphasis on}} horizontal grille blades. The parking lamps were moved from the bumper to between the square <b>bezeled</b> <b>headlamps,</b> which were now set wider apart. V-shaped emblems made a return on hood and deck lid.

Several optional rear roof treatments were available making these models true factory-built semi-custom-type vehicles.|$|R
2500|$|At a {{media event}} on February 28, 2011, Holden {{unveiled}} the Australian assembled Cruze sedan in facelifted [...] "Series II" [...] guise, {{otherwise known as}} the JH series. Prime Minister Julia Gillard attended the February launch to drive the first example off Holden's production line before full-scale production commenced in March. Holden has confirmed an initial local content level of between 40 and 50percent if assessed by retail value, with an aim of increasing Cruze localization over time. Series II styling revisions to the grille, lower air intake, and bumper have softened the front-end to bear a closer resemblance to Holden's larger VE II Commodore. Further differentiation from the original has been achieved via the fitment of amber front indicator lights, jewelled <b>bezel</b> <b>headlamps,</b> remodelled wheel trims, and through adjustments to the lower portion of the rear bumper. Carrying over largely unchanged is the 1.8-liter petrol inline-four, tweaked to yield slight enhancements in drivability. When automatic transmission is specified, the 1.8-liter is now teamed with GM's six-speed 6T30 unit, lighter and more compact than the previous 6T40. Diesel remains optional for [...] "CD" [...] and [...] "CDX" [...] specifications over the standard 1.8-liter petrol. Alterations to the 2.0-liter turbodiesel have resulted in an additional [...] and [...] and a slight reduction in fuel consumption for the manual variant, now a six-speed unit. However, the headline change is {{the release of the}} turbocharged 1.4-liter engine, dubbed iTi by Holden for intelligent turbo induction. The inclusion of the 1.4 also brings an upgrade to electric (as opposed to hydraulic) power steering and affixes a Watt's linkage to the torsion beam rear suspension. Linked with six-speed manual or automatic transmissions, the 1.4 is fitted as standard to the new [...] "SRi" [...] and [...] "SRi-V" [...] sports-oriented trims, but is available at extra cost on the base [...] "CD". The new [...] "SRi" [...] and [...] "SRi-V" [...] models have their respective badges embossed onto the grille insert, are fitted with their own front bumper design, and feature side skirts, chrome exterior door handles, a rear lip spoiler, and five-spoke 17-inch alloy wheels. Over the [...] "CD", [...] "SRi" [...] gains a leather-covered steering wheel rim and shift lever, with the [...] "SRi-V" [...] extending this upholstering to the seating. A heat function for the front seats, keyless entry with push-button engine start, reversing sensors, and seven-inch LCD multimedia unit are also part of the [...] "SRi-V" [...] equipment list. This multimedia system integrates satellite navigation, the CD and DVD players, and a 10GB internal hard disk drive. In mid-November 2011, Holden released the MY12 update to the Series II Cruze. This update coincided with the release of the hatchback body variant and saw Bluetooth telephone connectivity standard across the range.|$|R
