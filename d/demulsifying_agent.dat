40|$|Oil {{produced}} in most oil fields {{is accompanied by}} water {{in the form of}} an emulsion that must be treated. In addition, this water normally contains dissolved salts, principally chlorides of sodium, calcium, and magnesium. If crude oil is left untreated, when it is processed in a refinery the salt can cause various operating problems. This paper investigates experimentally the effect of five factors (gravity settling, chemical treatment, freshwater injection, heating, and mixing) on the efficiency of the dehydration=desalting process for a Kuwaiti crude oil and a commercial demulsifier (Servo CC 3408). These factors are systematically varied and efficiency is analyzed. Two efficiencies are defined: a Salt Removal (S=R) efficiency and a Water Cut (W=C) dehydration efficiency. The investigation was carried out through changes made to a single factor at a time as well as multiple variations of factors. Plots, based on experimental data, showing the variation of the two efficiencies as a function of the various factors are given. Two main conclusions are drawn for the system studied. First, excessive amounts of a <b>demulsifying</b> <b>agent</b> ha...|$|E
30|$|All biosurfactants {{tested in}} this work showed {{demulsification}} capacity. It is important to highlight that the results obtained can be considered satisfactory, {{since most of the}} biosurfactants tested here were produced from industrial residues, making them more attractive since they can be used in the crude form (Santos et al. 2016). It is also worth mentioning that the studies found in the literature do not describe the use of biosurfactants produced by yeasts as <b>demulsifying</b> <b>agents.</b> It seems that these are the first results published with these agents from yeasts.|$|R
50|$|In most plants the {{cleaning}} agents are circulated until their cleaning power has eventually decreased {{and reached the}} maximum tolerable contaminant level. In order to delay the necessary bath exchange {{as much as possible}} there are sophisticated treatment attachments in use, removing contaminants and the used up agents from the system. At the same time fresh cleaning agents or parts thereof have to be supplemented, which requires a bath control. The latter is more and more facilitated online and thus allows a computer aided adjustment of the bath. With the help of oil separators, <b>demulsifying</b> <b>agents</b> and evaporators aqueous processes can be conducted 'waste water free'. Complete exchange of baths becomes only necessary every 3 to 12 months.|$|R
30|$|The biosurfactants tested showed {{abilities}} {{to act as}} <b>demulsifying</b> <b>agents</b> when used isolated or in their crude form. The possibility of using crude preparations of the biosurfactants, in particular, can favor the application of these agents on a large scale. In this way, {{it is possible to}} verify the environmental application of these biotechnological agents as an adjunct to the processes of recovery of oil spilled to the refineries and to the treatment of sea water, collaborating not only for the conservation of the environment, but also for the reduction of the costs of the petrochemical industries with maritime accidents. The use of environmentally friendly demulsifiers for the breakdown of hydrocarbon-water emulsions encountered in crude oil production is also a very important tool to allow petroleum industries to recover a product of improved quality, especially in platforms and may have other environmental and oilâ€“water emulsion waste or contaminations application.|$|R
