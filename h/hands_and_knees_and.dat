25|$|On March 26, 2004, Austin {{allegedly}} assaulted {{his girlfriend}} Tess Broussard during a dispute at his Texas home, {{according to a}} San Antonio Police Department report. Broussard claimed that Austin grabbed her, and she began struggling with him, who eventually threw her to the ground. Broussard landed on her <b>hands</b> <b>and</b> <b>knees,</b> <b>and</b> later told officers she had injured her right hand. Broussard provided a written statement to police, who photographed her injuries.|$|E
500|$|During {{the debate}} held on 21 May 2012 {{concerning}} the Irish European Fiscal Compact referendum, Pat Kenny {{got down on}} his <b>hands</b> <b>and</b> <b>knees</b> <b>and</b> shouted at a farmer in the audience to shut up.

500|$|Thomas O'Leary, the {{wireless}} operator for ML 446, recalled {{the ferocity of}} incoming German fire, stating"One commando was remarking how pretty the tracer fire, red and green, was. A moment later one blew {{the back of his}} head out. I was down below with my tin hat because by now the bullets were going through (the boat) and out the other side. If I wanted to get about I had to crawl on my <b>hands</b> <b>and</b> <b>knees</b> <b>and</b> I was lucky nothing came through at my level. We couldn't get in (to the objective) and all over a sudden the wounded started coming down. By then all our guns had jammed and most of the other ships were on fire."ML 177, the launch that had successfully taken off some of the crew from Campbeltown, was sunk on her way out of the estuary. [...] ML 269, another torpedo-armed boat, had the unenviable task of moving up and down the river at high speed to draw German fire away from the landings. Soon after passing Campbeltown it was hit and its steering damaged. It took ten minutes to repair the steering. They turned and started in the other direction, opening fire on an armed trawler in passing. Return fire from the trawler set their engine on fire.|$|E

2500|$|On {{the morning}} of his execution, Peace ate a hearty breakfast of bacon, and calmly awaited {{the coming of the}} public executioner, William Marwood, {{inventor}} of the [...] "long drop". He was escorted on the death-walk by the prison chaplain, who was reading aloud from The Consolations of Religion about the fires of hell. Peace burst out [...] "Sir, if I believed what you and the church of God say that you believe, even if England were covered with broken glass from coast to coast, I would walk over it, if need be, on <b>hands</b> <b>and</b> <b>knees</b> <b>and</b> think it worth while living, just to save one soul from an eternal hell like that!" ...|$|E
2500|$|Marcia Wallace {{spoke of}} Newhart's amiable nature on set: [...] "He's very low key, and he didn't want to cause trouble. I {{had a dog}} {{by the name of}} Maggie that I used to bring to the set. And {{whenever}} there was a line that Bob didn't like—he didn't want to complain too much—so, he'd go over, get down on his <b>hands</b> <b>and</b> <b>knees,</b> <b>and</b> repeat the line to the dog, which invariably yawned; and he'd say, 'See, I told you it's not funny!'" [...] Wallace has also commented on the show's lack of Emmy recognition: [...] "People think we were nominated for many an Emmy, people presume we won Emmys, all of us, and certainly Bob, and certainly the show. Nope, never!" ...|$|E
2500|$|Helmsley {{was known}} for [...] "tyrannizing her employees". According to Alan Dershowitz, while breakfasting with her {{at one of the}} Helmsley hotels, the waiter brought him a cup of tea with a tiny bit of water spilled on the saucer. She grabbed the cup from him and smashed it on the floor, then demanded that the waiter get down on his <b>hands</b> <b>and</b> <b>knees</b> <b>and</b> beg for his job." [...] In another account of Helmsley's behavior, she had a {{barbecue}} pit constructed for her home. The work was performed by Eugene Brennan, a personal friend of Jeremiah McCarthy, the chief engineer of Helmsley-Spear. When the final bill came to $13,000, she refused to pay, citing shoddy workmanship. When McCarthy pleaded with her to honor the bill, citing the favor done on his behalf and informing her that Brennan had six children to support, Helmsley replied, [...] "Why didn't he keep his pants on? Then he wouldn't need the money".|$|E

Reviews were conducted for the hand, wrist, elbow, shoulder, <b>knee,</b> ankle, <b>and</b> foot; most reports were related to the <b>hand</b> <b>and</b> <b>knee,</b> <b>and</b> the most common disease process was rheumatoid arthritis. The review highlights the current gaps in the literature, including a lack of reliability data with respect to intra-occasion and intra- and inter-reader reliability.

60|$|The last benches of that ridge taxed my waning strength. I {{had to step}} up, climb up, pull myself up, by <b>hand</b> <b>and</b> <b>knee</b> <b>and</b> body. My rifle grew {{to weigh}} a ton. My {{cartridge}} belt was a burden of lead around my waist. If I had been hot and wet below in the thicket I wondered what I grew on the last steps of this ridge. Yet even the toil and the pain held a keen pleasure. I did not analyze my feelings then, but {{it was good to}} be there.|$|R

60|$|The next I know, I {{was down}} the booby-ladder and reeling dizzily {{about the big}} after-room as the sulphur fumes bit my lungs and strangled me.

60|$|Late in the {{afternoon}} he followed a stream, milky with lime, which ran through sparse patches of rush-grass. Grasping these rushes firmly near the root, he pulled up what resembled a young onion-sprout {{no larger than a}} shingle-nail. It was tender, and his teeth sank into it with a crunch that promised deliciously of food. But its fibers were tough. It was composed of stringy filaments saturated with water, like the berries, and devoid of nourishment. He threw off his pack and went into the rush-grass on <b>hands</b> <b>and</b> <b>knees,</b> crunching <b>and</b> munching, like some bovine creature.|$|R
40|$|Finite element {{analysis}} {{is becoming an}} increasingly important part of biomechanics and orthopedic research, as computational resources become more powerful, and data handling algorithms become more sophisticated. Until recently, tools with sufficient power did not exist or were not accessible to adequately model complicated, three-dimensional, nonlinear biomechanical systems. In the past, finite element analyses in biomechanics have often been limited to two-dimensional approaches, linear analyses, or simulations of single tissue types. Today, we {{have the resources to}} model fully three-dimensional, nonlinear, multi-tissue, and even multi-joint systems. The authors will present the process of developing these kinds of finite element models, using human <b>hand</b> <b>and</b> <b>knee</b> examples, <b>and</b> will demonstrate their software tools...|$|R

40|$|Objective To {{determine}} whether Caucasian women ages 28 – 48 years with newly defined osteoarthritis (OA) would have greater bone mineral density (BMD) and less bone turnover over time than would women without OA. Methods Data {{were derived from}} the longitudinal Michigan Bone Health Study. Period prevalence and 3 -year incidence of OA were based on radiographs of the dominant <b>hand</b> <b>and</b> both <b>knees,</b> scored with the Kellgren/Lawrence (K/L) scale. OA scores were related to BMD, which was measured by dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry, and to serum osteocalcin levels, which were measured by radioimmunoassay. Results The period prevalence of OA (K/L grade ≥ 2 in the knees or the dominant hand) was 15. 3 % (92 of 601), with 8. 7 % for the <b>knees</b> <b>and</b> 6. 7 % for the hand. The 3 -year incidence of knee OA was 1. 9 % (9 of 482) <b>and</b> of <b>hand</b> OA was 3. 3 % (16 of 482). Women with incident knee OA had greater average BMD (z-scores 0. 3 – 0. 8 higher for the 3 BMD sites) than women without knee OA (P 60 %; P = 0. 02) or knee OA (20 %; P not significant). The average change in absolute serum osteocalcin levels was not as great in women with incident hand OA or knee OA as in women without OA (P < 0. 02 and P < 0. 05, respectively). Conclusion Women with radiographically defined knee OA have greater BMD than do women without <b>knee</b> OA <b>and</b> {{are less likely to}} lose that higher level of BMD. There was less bone turnover among women with hand OA and/or knee OA. These findings suggest that bone-forming cells might show a differential response in OA of the <b>hand</b> <b>and</b> <b>knee,</b> <b>and</b> may suggest a different pathogenesis of <b>hand</b> OA <b>and</b> <b>knee</b> OA...|$|R
2500|$|Wages {{and working}} {{conditions}} for agricultural workers in Hardin County were poor even {{before the onset of}} the Great Depression. [...] A plentiful supply of Caucasian migrant farm workers kept wages far below those of other counties and states. Working conditions were harsh. Laborers worked on their <b>hands</b> <b>and</b> <b>knees</b> weeding <b>and</b> picking onions. The work day was 10 hours long, with a 15-minute break for lunch and no overtime. There were no toilet facilities or restroom breaks, and water and first aid for injuries or heat exhaustion were not provided. The black earth absorbed heat, and temperatures near the ground could reach 120 degrees Fahrenheit (49°C). Many workers lived in employer-provided housing, and were given an employer-owned milk cow (on loan) to prevent starvation.|$|R
