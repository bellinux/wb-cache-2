500|$|Though 15 delegates of her {{parliament}} (16%) were women, few {{advances in}} women's rights were made during Chamoro's administration. Chamorro {{was not a}} feminist, since her beliefs prevented her from advocating many {{of the goals of}} traditional feminism. She was against abortion and questioned cohabitation, contraception and divorce. Cutbacks in public services during her regime, like child care and centers for rehabilitation, led to an increase in low-income women being forced into prostitution and crime. According to a United Nations study, the financial insecurity forced women and adolescents into [...] "street professions", elevating security risks and increasing the rate of <b>drop</b> <b>outs,</b> drug abuse, juvenile delinquency and prostitution.

She did support women's rights to become property holders, and saw such ownership as a protection when divorce or widowhood deprived women of a husband's support.

40|$|Thesis (MCom (Industrial Psychology)) [...] North-West University, Potchefstroom Campus, 2012 Student {{intention}} to <b>drop</b> <b>out</b> {{is a concern}} for higher education institutions as well for their students. Students with the {{intention to}} <b>drop</b> <b>out</b> may eventually <b>drop</b> <b>out</b> and contribute towards the already high dropout rates, which are causing economic damage. Students leaving their institution have vast financial consequences for their institution, as institutions obtain grants from the government according to their success rates. Although previous {{research has been conducted}} on students’ intention to <b>drop</b> <b>out,</b> it is limited, especially when looking at possible predictors that are specific to the South African context. This study contributes towards the gap in research regarding the possible predictors of student intention to <b>drop</b> <b>out.</b> The objectives of this study were to 1) conceptualise the possible predictors of student intention to <b>drop</b> <b>out</b> according to the literature; 2) determine if self-evaluation traits (self-esteem and self-efficacy) are significant predictors of student intention to drop out; 3) determine if student burnout and student engagement are significant predictors of student intention to drop out; 4) determine if social support (social support from parents and general social support) are significant predictors of student intention to drop out; and 5) determine if career decision-making difficulties are significant predictors of student intention to <b>drop</b> <b>out.</b> A non-probability quota sample (N = 782) was used to investigate possible predictors of career student intention to <b>drop</b> <b>out</b> in a sample of university students. Student intention to <b>drop</b> <b>out</b> was measured by one item consisting of two categories: I have no intention to <b>drop</b> <b>out</b> (n = 501), and I have an intention to <b>drop</b> <b>out</b> (n = 280). These two groups were enclosed as a dependent variable in the logistic regression. The variables included in the final model predicted between 13 % (Cox and Snell) and 18 % (Nagelkerke) of the variance in intention to <b>drop</b> <b>out.</b> The {{results of this study suggest}} that self-esteem had an influence on student intention to <b>drop</b> <b>out.</b> Furthermore, it was found that cynicism and dedication have a significant relationship with student intention to <b>drop</b> <b>out.</b> Lastly, lack of information about ways to obtain information also indicated a significant relationship with student intention to <b>drop</b> <b>out.</b> Thus, it may be concluded that self-esteem, burnout and engagement and lack of information about ways of obtaining information have an influence on students’ intention to <b>drop</b> <b>out.</b> Recommendations were made for practice as well as for future research.

First, we utilized probit regression analysis and included, among others, the following variables: patients’ status (active or <b>drop</b> <b>out),</b> CD 4 cell count, TB and opportunistic infection (OI), work status, sex, history of injecting drugs, and support from family and peers. Second, we used the <b>drop</b> <b>out</b> data from our database and CD 4 cell count decline rate from another study to estimate the productivity loss due to HIV patients <b>drop</b> <b>out.</b> Results: lower CD 4 cell count {{was associated with a}} higher probability of <b>drop</b> <b>out.</b> Support from family/peers, living with family, and diagnosed with TB were associated with lower probability of <b>drop</b> <b>out.</b> The productivity loss at national level due to treatment <b>drop</b> <b>out</b> (consequently, due to CD 4 cell count decline) can reach US$ 365 million (using average wage). Conclusion: first, as lower CD 4 cell count was associated with higher probability of <b>drop</b> <b>out,</b> we recommend (to optimize) early ARV initiation at a higher CD 4 cell count, involving scaling up HIV service at the community level. Second, family/peer support should be further emphasized to further ensure treatment success. Third, <b>dropping</b> <b>out</b> from ART will result in a relatively large productivity loss...|$|R

40|$|OBJECTIVES—The <b>drop</b> <b>out</b> {{rates in}} {{different}} longitudinal studies of musculoskeletal disorders range between 7 % and 57 %, and {{little is known}} about the characteristics of the subjects who <b>dropped</b> <b>out.</b> The aim was to analyse various consequences of <b>drop</b> <b>out</b> in a longitudinal study of musculoskeletal disorders and occupational risk factors during 1969 - 97.  METHOD—Data about occupational conditions and health in 1969  and in 1993  were analysed. Differences between those who participated throughout (participants) and <b>drop</b> <b>out</b> subjects in these analyses formed the basis for recalculations of earlier reported analyses of associations between occupational conditions and low back pain. In the recalculation the data were weighted to compensate for the differences.  RESULTS—More female and male <b>drop</b> <b>out</b> subjects than participants in 1993  had monotonous work, fewer women and more male <b>drop</b> <b>out</b> subjects had heavy lifting in 1969.  In 1997, more female and male <b>drop</b> <b>out</b> subjects had had heavy lifting and low stimulation at work in 1993.  At both occasions, there were differences between the <b>drop</b> <b>out</b> subjects and participants in occurrence of musculoskeletal disorders.

Retrospective observational cohort study. Fertility centers. Consecutive subfertile couples undergoing IUI. None. Characteristics and prognosis of ongoing pregnancy after IUI at the start of treatment of couples that <b>dropped</b> <b>out</b> compared with couples that continued treatment or achieved an ongoing pregnancy. We studied 803 couples who underwent 3, 579 IUI cycles of whom 221 couples <b>dropped</b> <b>out</b> (28 %). Couples <b>dropping</b> <b>out</b> completed 2. 8 (SD ± 1. 4) cycles per couple compared with 4. 5 (SD ± 2. 3) cycles per couple for those continuing treatment. Couples <b>dropping</b> <b>out</b> had a higher female age, longer subfertility duration, and higher basal FSH. Mean prognosis to achieve an ongoing pregnancy after IUI at start of treatment was 7. 9 % (SD ± 2. 4) per cycle for couples who <b>dropped</b> <b>out</b> and 8. 5 % (SD ± 2. 5) per cycle for couples continuing treatment.
