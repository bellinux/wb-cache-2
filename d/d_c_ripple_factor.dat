40|$|Multi-level {{converters}} {{are well}} suited to medium and high power applications where the priority is for high quality a. c. currents with low harmonic content and for low switching losses. Suitable modulation schemes must find a good compromise between these two conflicting aims. This paper relates one-dimensional feed-forward modulation (1 DFFM) to carrier based modulation. 1 DFFM can produce high quality currents despite <b>d.</b> <b>c.</b> capacitor voltage <b>ripple</b> by accounting for measured capacitor voltages in the modulation process and can balance capacitor voltages by eliminating states that cause the capacitor voltages to diverge. It is shown in this paper that this method increases the device switching frequency compared to carrier-based modulation with the same sampling rate. An alternative modulation method is presented which balances the capacitor voltages by assigning commutations to bridges during each sampling period. This approach {{is less likely to}} cause two bridges to commutate at the same time so produces a lower device switching frequency than 1 DFFM. It is shown experimentally that the two methods produce similar a. c. current distortion and both effectively balance the capacitor voltages...|$|R
40|$|The {{objective}} of this work is to investigate the <b>ripple</b> <b>factor</b> of half-wave rectifier circuits. The <b>ripple</b> <b>factor</b> {{is one of the}} important characteristics necessary when designing a power electronic converter.

In this paper the <b>ripple</b> <b>factor</b> of the output current of half-wave rectifiers is investigated. More specifically, the <b>ripple</b> <b>factor</b> of output current from more practical half-wave rectifiers that include inductive load with or without a freewheeling diode are analyzed and then compared to that of the basic half-wave rectifier consisting only of a resistive load.

40|$|Abstract. On each nonreflexive Banach space X {{there exists}} a {{positive}} continuous convex function f such that 1 /f is not a <b>d.</b> <b>c.</b> function (i. e., a difference of two continuous convex functions). This result together with known ones implies that X is reflexive {{if and only if}} each everywhere defined quotient of two continuous convex functions is a <b>d.</b> <b>c.</b> function. Our construction gives also a stronger version of Klee’s result concerning renormings of nonreflexive spaces and non-norm-attaining functionals. A function on a Banach space X is called a <b>d.</b> <b>c.</b> function if it can be represented as a difference of two continuous convex functions (all functions considered in this note are realvalued). Thus the system of all <b>d.</b> <b>c.</b> functions on X is the smallest vector space containing all continuous convex functions.

The applied multi-leg topology and the interleaved switching method can effectively reduce fuel cell current ripple to meet the suggested limitation of 4 %.

In the selection of the input inductors and the output capacitors, this paper uniquely presents an analytic method for obtaining optimum parameter values. The design considerations include leg number, switching frequency, output loads, and dynamic response. Novel equivalent models with equivalent series resistors for multi-leg boost converters are proposed. This model can simplify the analysis of multi-leg converters and is thus used for compensation design. To verify the analytic results, Intersil ISL 6556 B integrated circuit is used to implement two-, three-, and four-leg fuel cell boost converters rated 1000 Â W.
