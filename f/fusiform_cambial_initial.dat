40|$|The {{nature of}} the {{vascular}} cambium is discussed {{and the length of}} the elements in the secondary xylem related to the division and elongation cycles of the <b>cambial</b> <b>fusiform</b> <b>initials.</b> Particular attention is given to the activities of the storeyed cambium. The ontogeny of the storeyed cambium is described for Hoheria angustifolia Raoul. (Malvaceae). The transition from procambium to cambium was found to take place gradually, the meristem acquiring cambial characteristics over a number of internodes, some before and some after internodal elongation had ceased. The cambium is non storeyed at the commencement of secondary growth but later develops a storeyed pattern. Developmental changes in the cambium with radial growth were studied in Aeschynomene hispida Willd. (Papilionaceae). Repeated radial longitudinal divisions in the <b>fusiform</b> <b>cambial</b> <b>initials</b> in this plant produce a highly developed storeyed pattern with radial growth. The frequency of these divisions decreases with increasing distance from the stem centre. The mean length of the fusiform initials decreases slightly with radial growth. Variation {{in the size of the}} fusiform initials and vessel members was also investigated in Hoberia angustifolia. Mean length of the fusiform initials was found to remain constant with increasing distance from the stem centre but a slight decrease was observed with increasing height in the tree. Mean fusiform initial width showed an increase followed by a decrease with increasing height in the tree. The significance of these results is related to the division pattern in the storeyed cambium...|$|R

We have investigated the cortical microtubular (CMT) and microfilament (MF) components of the cytoskeleton in a secondary tissue  –  active vascular cambium of Aesculus hippocastanum L. (horse-chestnut)  –  and followed the changes in these components during the early stages of differentiation of <b>fusiform</b> <b>cambial</b> derivatives to axial elements of the secondary vascular system. A correlative approach was used employing indirect immunofluorescence microscopy of α-tubulin on 6 μm sections, and transmission electron microscopy of 60 nm sections. The study has demonstrated a rearrangement of the CMT cytoskeleton, from random to helical, as <b>fusiform</b> vascular <b>cambial</b> cells begin to differentiate as secondary phloem vascular tissue. A similar CMT rearrangement is seen as <b>fusiform</b> <b>cambial</b> cells begin to differentiate as secondary xylem fibres. This rearrangement is interpreted as evidence of determination of cambial derivatives towards vascular development. Axially-oriented MF bundles are present in <b>fusiform</b> <b>cambial</b> cells and their axial orientation is retained in the vascular derivatives at early stages of their development even though the CMTs have become rearranged...|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{investigates the}} {{aggregate}} rays {{present in the}} xylem of the New Zealand species of Nothofagus, and compares them with those present in other genera, particularly Fagus and Dracophyllum. The ontogeny of aggregate rays is investigated, and {{shown to be a}} feature largely of the 'leaf-gap' in Fagus and Dracophyllum. In Nothofagus, however, aggregate ray ontogeny relates more to the leaf-trace. Neither the 'synthetic' nor the 'dissection' theory is adequate for describing aggregate ray ontogeny. The presence of aggregate rays in Nothofagus is correlated with an irregular (not circular) outline of the pith (TS) and may relate to light and hormonal factors and their effect on cell division and elongation within the elongating internode. Certain regions within the growth increment are dominated by pseudo-transverse anticlinal divisions of <b>cambial</b> <b>fusiform</b> <b>initials,</b> other regions are dominated by fusiform initial elongation. An attempt was made to determine whether these regions could be distinguished based on deviations from the normal distribution recorded for axial element length data. The results are not conclusive, but may merit further investigation. Certain features of the aggregate rays in Nothofagus such as: reduced element length; paucity of vessels; reduction of individual rays; and the formation of 'wound-like' areas, indicate that the fluting may actually be responsible for the presence of these aggregate rays...|$|R

40|$|Abstract~-In {{order to}} make an {{accurate}} estimation of the location of cambium {{at the time of}} pin insertion, pin marks left in the xylem tissue were minutely examined. The size and shape of the abnormal tissue induced by pin insertion depended on the size of needle, growth rate of trees, and the tree species. Since the abnormal tissue changed its shape and size as the cross section receded from the center, it was concluded to be necessary to use the cross section obtained from the center of pinning for correct application of the pinning method. The site relation between <b>cambial</b> <b>initials</b> at the time of pinning and the abnormal tissue was investigated following the modified Wolter's procedure. As a result, the site of <b>cambial</b> <b>initials</b> at the time of pinning was assumed to be at the cambial-side margin of the spindle-like abnormal tissue...|$|R
40|$|Rearrangements of {{cortical}} microtubules (CMTs) {{during the}} differentiation of axial secondary xylem elements within taproots and shoots of Aesculus hippocastanum L. (horse-chestnut) are described. A correlative approach was employed using indirect immunofluorescence microscopy of α-tubulin in 6 - to 10 -μm sections and {{transmission electron microscopy}} of ultrathin sections. All cell types – fibres, vessel elements and axial parenchyma – derive from <b>fusiform</b> <b>cambial</b> cells which contain randomly oriented CMTs. At {{the early stages of}} development, fibres and axial parenchyma cells possess helically arranged CMTs, which increase in number as secondary wall thickening proceeds and simple pits develop. In contrast, incipient vessel elements are distinguished by the marking out of sites of bordered pits; these sites first appear as microtubule-free regions within the reticulum of randomly oriented CMTs that characterises their precursor <b>fusiform</b> <b>cambial</b> cells. Subsequently, the ring of CMTs which develops at the periphery of the microtubule-free region decreases in diameter as the over-arching pit border is formed. Like bordered pits, large-diameter, non-bordered pits (contact pits) which develop between vessel elements and adjacent contact ray cells originate as microtubule-free regions and are also associated with development of a ring of CMTs at the periphery. In the case of contact pits, however, there is no reduction in the diameter of the CMT ring during pit development. Tertiary cell wall thickenings are also a feature of vessel elements and appear to form at sites where bands of laterally associated, transversely oriented CMTs, separated from each other by microtubule-free zones, are found. Later, these bands of CMTs become narrower, and separate into pairs of microtubule bundles located {{on each side of the}} developing wall thickening. Development of perforations between vessel elements is also associated with the presence of a ring of CMTs at their periphery...|$|R
40|$|The {{intrusive}} {{growth of}} fusiform initials was studied in Entandrophragma, This growth makes possible {{a change in}} the position of the cell ends of one storey in respect to those in the neighbouring storey, and this is 'turn leads to changes in the orientation of <b>cambial</b> <b>initials.</b> The growth activities of the oppositely directed ends of the same initial are not the same. Not all cell ends are simultaneously actiye. There are groups of ends distributed alternately in a storey which are active or inactive, so that a pattern of growth activity appears in the cambium. The activity of a particular cell end changes in successive time periods. Owing to this, the rate of creeping of one end past. those of the adjoining storey varies. This phenomenon of changes in the activity of cell ends in time may be referred to the phenomenon of the appearance of the growth activity pattern on the cambium surface under the hypothesis of transverse shifting of the elements of this pattern ("active" and. "inactive" groups) in relation to the <b>cambial</b> <b>initials...</b>|$|R
30|$|Fiber {{length and}} wall {{thickness}} increased from pith to {{the periphery of}} trees with significant differences between radial positions (p <  0.05). The fiber diameter increased from pith to middle and then decreased somewhat from mid-radius to the periphery (Table  3). These results are comparable with other studies on teak [42, 44]. In general, {{there is a general}} increase of fiber length due to the length increase of <b>cambial</b> <b>initials</b> with increasing <b>cambial</b> age [46, 47]. A decrease of ray frequency with age was mentioned by Moya et al. [17] and Lima et al. [44].|$|R
40|$|We {{studied the}} {{dynamics}} of the cortical microtubule (CMT) cytoskeleton during differentiation of axial secondary phloem elements in taproots and epicotyls of Aesculus hippocastanum L. (horse-chestnut) saplings. Indirect immunofluorescence microscopy of α-tubulin and transmission electron microscopy revealed that <b>fusiform</b> <b>cambial</b> cells possessed a reticulum of CMTs in which individual microtubules were randomly arranged. During differentiation of these cambial cell derivatives into secondary phloem cells, the CMTs were rearranged to become helically oriented, regardless of phloem cell type. Although helical CMTs were a persistent feature of all axial elements of the secondary phloem (sieve elements, companion cells, phloem parenchyma, and fiber-sclereids), some modifications of this arrangement occurred as cells differentiated. Thus, at late stages of cell differentiation, sieve elements possessed nearly transverse CMTs, pronounced bundling of CMTs was seen in phloem parenchyma, and the density of CMTs in the helical arrays of fibers increased markedly. Additionally, phloem parenchyma possessed rings of CMTs in association with developing pit areas. Aspects of the development and chemistry of cell walls were also examined during phloem cytodifferentiation...|$|R

Aegle marmelos Correa, Mangifera indica L., Syzygium cumini L., and Zizyphus mauritiana Lamk. In all the species studied, fibre elements found in the vicinity of vascular cambium are longer than those situated in the outer regions of the bark. The length variation of fibre elements is attributable partly to the increase in size of <b>cambial</b> <b>initials</b> with increasing age of the cambium and partly to the apical elongation of elements by intrusive growth...|$|R
40|$|Aspects of the {{structure}} and ultrastructure of the <b>fusiform</b> <b>cambial</b> cells of the taproot of Aesculus hippocastanum L. (horse chestnut) are described {{in relation to the}} seasonal cycle of cambial activity and dormancy. Particular attention is directed at cell walls and the microtubule and microfilament components of the cytoskeleton, using a range of cytochemical and immunolocalization techniques at the optical and electron-microscopical levels. During the dormant phase, cambial cell walls are thick and multi-layered, the cells possess a helical array of cortical microtubules, and microfilament bundles are oriented axially. In the early stages of reactivation, vesicle-like profiles are associated with the cell walls, whereas arrangement of the cytoskeletal elements remains unchanged. In the succeeding active phase, the cell walls are thin, and cortical microtubules form a random array, although microfilament bundles maintain a near-axial orientation. The observations are discussed in relation to the seasonal cycle of wall structure and cortical microtubule rearrangement within the vascular cambium of hardwood trees. It is suggested that the cell-wall thickening at the onset of cambial dormancy, which is associated with the presence of a helical cortical microtubule array, should be considered to be secondary wall thickening, and that selective lysis of this secondary wall layer during cambial reactivation restores the thinner, primary wall found around active cambial cells...|$|R
40|$|The {{effect of}} {{exogenous}} application of growth regulators (IAA, NAA, GA 3 and BAP) on xylogenesis {{has been investigated}} in actively growing shoots of Leucaena leucocephala by anatomical methods. Auxins are (both IAA and NAA) {{found to be the}} key regulators of differentiation of narrow lumen vessels and tracheids. These elements were derived not only from <b>fusiform</b> <b>cambial</b> cells, but also from axial parenchyma through transdifferentiation. The exogenous feeding of GA 3 induced differentiation of gelatinous fibres, deformed vessels, elongated thin walled fibres and a high fibre/vessel ratio. BAP application decreased the cambial activity and cell differentiation process resulting in development of thick walled fibres and vessel elements, and also delayed lignification of cell walls. The application of combination of hormones showed both synergistic and antagonistic nature of interaction among different hormones. Combination of GA 3 and auxins induced cambial cell division and relatively fast differentiation of xylem, while increasing concentrations of GA 3 over auxins induced differentiation of gelatinous fibres. The combination of high concentration of BAP either with auxins or with GA 3 slowed down cambial activity and xylem differentiation. Moderate concentrations of BAP and GA 3 induced gelatinous fibres with thick gelatinous layer indicating the synergistic effect of both hormones...|$|R
40|$|The {{cortical}} microfilament (MF) {{component of}} the cytoskeleton within axial elements of the secondary vascular system of the angiosperm tree, Aesculus hippocastanum L. (horse-chestnut) was studied using transmission electron microscopy of ultrathin sections and indirect immunofluorescence microscopy of actin in thick sections. As seen by electron microscopy, MF bundles have a net axial orientation within <b>fusiform</b> <b>cambial</b> cells and their secondary vascular derivatives (i. e. in the axial xylem and phloem parenchyma, xylem fibres, vessel and sieve elements, and companion cells). Immunofluorescence studies, however, reveal that this axial orientation can be more accurately described as a helix of extremely high pitch; it is a persistent feature of all axial secondary vascular elements during their development. Helical MF arrays are the only arrangement seen in secondary phloem cells. However, in addition to helices, other MF arrays are seen in secondary xylem cells. For example, fibres possess ellipses of MFs associated with simple-pit formation, and vessel elements possess circular arrays of MFs that associate with the developing inter-vessel bordered pits, ray–vessel contact pits, and with the perforation plate. Linear MF arrays are seen co-oriented with the developing tertiary wall-thickenings in vessel elements. The possible roles of MFs during the cytodifferentiation of secondary vascular cells is discussed, and {{compared with that of}} microtubules...|$|R
5000|$|From {{the early}} twentieth century, the {{anthophyte}} hypothesis was the prevailing explanation for seed plant evolution, based on shared morphological characters between the gnetophytes and angiosperms. In this hypothesis, the gnetophytes, along with the extinct order Bennettitales, are sister to the angiosperms, forming the [...] "anthophytes". [...] Some morphological characters that were suggested to unite the anthophytes include vessels in wood, net-veined leaves (in Gnetum only), lignin chemistry, the layering of cells in the apical meristem, pollen and megaspore features (including thin megaspore wall), short <b>cambial</b> <b>initials,</b> and lignin syringal groups. However, most genetic studies have rejected the anthophyte hypothesis. Several of these {{studies have suggested that}} the gnetophytes and angiosperms have independently derived characters, including flower-like reproductive structures and tracheid vessel elements, that appear shared but are actually the result of parallel evolution.|$|R
30|$|Some {{researchers}} believe that the formation of juvenile wood {{is related to the}} year of formation (ring number) of the <b>cambial</b> <b>initials</b> and the formation of a somewhat cylindrical, or a conical zone {{in the center of the}} tree while other researchers think that distance from the pith is a better measure for defining juvenile wood than ring number [8]. In yet another concept, some researchers use the term “crown-formed wood” in relation to the position of the wood from the crown during the formation of the wood [9]. In Corsican pine (Pinus nigra), it was suggested that the term “crown-formed wood” should be used to describe fluctuations in wood structure (density) associated with the size of the crown, superimposed upon the inherent trends due to cambial age [10]. The crown size and the position of the wood from the crown when the wood was formed may affect the radial variation of wood properties.|$|R
40|$|There {{appear in}} the wood of Entandrophragma, beside the basic {{interlocked}} grain, local minute undulations of grain the manifestation of which are checkered figures, either slanting or horizontal, on the radial face of boards. In reference to the model the slanting checkered figure is interpreted {{as the result of}} sudden appearance in the cambium of a wave of orientational tendency (morphogenetic wave) of relatively short wavelengths and stabilized amplitude from the moment of its appearance, moving vertically. This wave induces undulations in the arrangement of <b>cambial</b> <b>initials.</b> The undulation pattern also moves, however, its rate is half that of the morphogenic wave rate. The amplitude of the undulations oscillates between a maximal value and null which means that in successive wood layers there is wavy grain alternating with straight grain. The horizontal checkered figure may be explained by a local shift of the prase by one half of the period of the morphogenic wave of relatively long wavelengths underlying the interlocked grain formation...|$|R
40|$|Plantation Eucalypt {{forests are}} an {{important}} source of wood fibre for pulp and paper manufacture and opportunities exist to enhance the quality of wood grown in these forests by silvicultural and genetic management. However the ability to do this is limited by the relatively poor understanding of the processes of secondary xylem cell production and differentiation and the mechanisms that control these processes. Length is one important fibre dimension affecting paper properties and this project has investigated the within-tree variation in secondary xylem fibre tracheid length (fibre length) in Eucalyptus globulus Labill. Evidence is presented that cambial region gibberellins are a likely causal factor in secondary xylem fibre elongation in Eucalypts. The dimensions of the secondary xylem fibres of woody dicotyledons are determined in part by the dimensions of the <b>fusiform</b> <b>cambial</b> cells from which they are derived and in part by the processes that occur during differentiation. For Eucalyptus globulus, a strong positive correlation (r = 0. 757, df = 7, P < 0. 05) existed between fibre length and <b>fusiform</b> <b>cambial</b> cell length along the axis of the stem. There also existed a basipetal gradient of increasing secondary xylem fibre elongation during differentiation. Although not statistically significant, the estimated rate of fibre elongation and the time required for differentiating fibres to complete elongation also increased basipetally. Gibberellins GA 1, GA 4, GA 8, GA 9, GA 19, GA 20, GA 29, GA 44, GA 81, indole- 3 -acetic acid (IAA) and abscisic acid (ABA) were identified in cambial region extracts of Eucalyptus globulus by comparing mass spectra and Kovats retention indices with those of authentic standards. The presence of brassinosteroid-like substances was also indicated by activity in the rice seedling leaf inclination assay. Using [17, 17 - 2 H 2] GAs as internal standards, GA 19, GA 20 and GA 44 were quantified at levels of 2 - 7 ng (g fresh weight) - 1. Other GAs were present at levels < 1 ng (g fresh weight) - 1. It seems likely that the early C- 13 hydroxylation pathway of GA biosynthesis predominates in Eucalyptus cambial region tissues. Although it has yet to be definitively determined whether these endogenous cambial region GAs arise by in situ biosynthesis and metabolism or by transport from apical meristems and leaves, the presence of high levels of GA 44 and GA 19 indicate that cambial region tissues can likely perform both early and late oxidative steps in GA biosynthesis. Within-tree gradients in cambial region GA, IAA and ABA levels were also identified. However the interpretation of these gradients is difficult since they vary depending upon how they are expressed, i. e. hormone per g cambial region tissue that gives a concentration or hormone per square cm of stem surface that gives an absolute amount. This problem will be difficult to resolve without a greater understanding of the localisation of cambial region hormones in the various cell types in various stages of development that comprise the cambial region. Localised stem injection of Primo (trinexapac-ethyl), a late stage acylcyclohexanedione type inhibitor of GA biosynthesis, was used to reduce endogenous cambial region GA levels. High doses of Primo also reduced the elongation of secondary xylem fibres and the radial number of primary walled differentiating fibres undergoing elongation. Fibre elongation was positively correlated with endogenous cambial region levels of both GA 1 (rs = 0. 74, P < 0. 01) and GA 20 (rs = 0. 72, P < 0. 01). Correlations between endogenous IAA or ABA and fibre elongation were positive but weak and non significant. Gibberellins may thus be causal factors in secondary xylem fibre elongation in Eucalyptus. However a definite relationship between spatial and temporal variation in cambial region hormone levels and within-tree variation in secondary xylem fibre elongation has yet to be established.

40|$|The {{development}} of the spirally thickened xylem element from a cambium initial of sycamore Acer pseudoplatanus has been traced by means of electron microscopy.

The cytoplasm at this stage is distributed in a thin skin between the cell wall and a large vacuole. No correlation has been observed between the distribution of any organelle and {{the pattern of the}} eventual thickenings. After the sites of thickening deposition have become apparent, the most conspicuous feature of the cell is the proliferation of Golgi bodies and vesicles. It is suggested that the material of the developing thickenings stems from direct apposition of the material in the Golgi vesicles. After glutaraldehyde fixation, microtubules (200 to 220 A in diameter) are seen to be sited in specific relation to the thickenings, the orientation of the tubules mirroring that of the fibrils seen in the thickenings.

40|$|Indole {{acetic acid}} (auxin) {{is a key}} {{regulator}} of wood formation, and an observed overlap between auxin concentration gradient and developing secondary xylem cells {{has led to the}} hypothesis that auxin regulates wood formation by acting as a morphogen. We dissected the role of auxin in wood formation by identifying the auxin-responsive transcriptome in wood-forming tissues and investigating alterations in wood formation in transgenic hybrid aspen plants (Populus tremula × Populus tremuloides) with perturbed auxin signaling. We showed that auxin-responsive genes in wood-forming tissues respond dynamically to changes in cellular auxin levels. However, the expression patterns of most of the auxin-responsive genes displayed limited correlation with the auxin concentration across this developmental zone. Perturbing auxin signaling by reducing auxin responsiveness reduced the cambial cell division activity, caused spatial deregulation of cell division of the <b>cambial</b> <b>initials,</b> and led to reductions in not only radial but also axial dimensions of fibers and vessels. We propose that, instead of acting as a morphogen, changes in auxin concentration in developing secondary xylem cells may provide important regulatory cues that modulate the expression of a few key regulators; these, in turn, may control the global gene expression patterns that are essential for normal secondary xylem development...|$|R
40|$|The {{length and}} breadth of the <b>cambial</b> <b>initials</b> and their {{derivatives}} have been examined in Polyalthia longifolia, a tropical tree possessing non-storied cambium. Taking the average size of the initials and the elements originating from them, most of the sieve-tube elements {{have been found to}} be slightly shorter in length than the fusiform initials. On the other hand, a few of these are still shorter - almost half of the fusiform initials, due to transverse or somewhat oblique divisions in the sieve element mother cells. The vessel elements are slightly shorter but 5 - 6 times wider than the fusiform initials. The parenchyma strands, in phloem comprising cells storing starch or tannin (pps), in xylem accumulating starch only (ssps), are more or less equal to fusiform initials indicating that the xylem and phloem mother cells forming parenchyma cells have not undergone any major change except for transverse divisions. The individual vessel-associated parenchyma cells (v. a. p. cells) are wider but much shorter in length as compared to the starch-storing parenchyma cells (s. s. p. cells) indicating that more transverse divisions have occured in the strands of the former than those of the latter. Among all the cambial derivatives, the fibers exhibit maximum increase in length, due to intrusive growth. The ray parenchyma cells are slightly longer than the ray initials possibly due to the elongation of these initials during their transformation into vascular ray cells...|$|R
40|$|The {{immediate}} {{environment of}} a <b>cambial</b> <b>initial</b> (weather and nutritional factors, growth regulators, physical stresses) varies continuously over time. Consequently local {{conditions in the}} cambium influencing wood formation at any given instant are unique. The distribution of these conditions can be influenced by longitudinal gradients (stem base to apex), circumferentially or by local factors, such as proximity to branches. Not surprisingly, therefore, the variation in wood properties within a stem is large and in seasonal climates, the greatest variation is typically found within an annual ring. A great advantage {{for the study of}} wood is that the net product of seasonal processes is recorded in the wood structure across the stem radius. Thus by studying the pattern of wood property variation, within the context of its growth history, we can gain insight into cause and effect relationships between the drivers of wood variability. Combining this with temporal, high-resolution measurements of stem growth, weather, and process modelling enables us to better understand and test hypotheses of wood formation and the causes of variability in wood properties. Over recent years and in partnership with industry and other research providers, we have been attempting to model tree growth (Cabala) and cambial activity (TreeRing and CAMBIUM) at a daily time step to explain radial variability in wood properties. CAMBIUM is the latest development of this effort, modelling a population of eucalypt cambial cells, accounting for fibre and vessel formation using physiologically meaningful relationships.

Despite the importance of cambial variants, nothing {{is known about the}} developmental mechanisms that may have led to the current diversity seen in these stems. Here, a thorough anatomical analysis of all genera along the phylogeny of Bignonieae (Bignoniaceae) was carried out in order to detect when in their ontogeny and phylogeny there were shifts leading to different stem anatomical patterns. We found that all species depart from a common developmental basis, with a continuous, regularly growing cambium. Initial development is then followed by the modification of four equidistant portions of the cambium that reduce the production of xylem and increase the production of phloem, the former with much larger sieve tubes and an extended lifespan. In most species, the formerly continuous cambium becomes disjunct, with cambial portions within phloem wedges and cambial portions between them. Other anatomical modifications such as the formation of multiples of four phloem wedges, multiple-dissected phloem wedges, and included phloem wedges take place thereafter. The fact that each novel trait raised on the ontogenetic trajectory appeared in subsequently more recent ancestors on the phylogeny suggests a recapitulatory history. This recapitulation is, however, caused by the terminal addition of evolutionary novelties rather than a truly heterochronic process. Truly heterochronic processes were only found in shrubby species, which resemble juveniles of their ancestors, {{as a result of a}} decelerated phloem formation by the variant cambia.

A key developmental character underlying diversity in most Piperales-with the exception of the herbaceous Saruma (Asaroideae) -is the conserved development of the wood cylinder, in which fusiform initials are limited to fascicular <b>cambial</b> <b>initials.</b> The resulting large fraction of raylike tissue in the stem-a highly characteristic feature of woody species in the Piperales-potentially introduced mechanical constraints on the diversification of self-supporting architectures. This was possibly circumvented by the architectural development of repeated, large-diameter meristems in some shrublike habits via sympodial growth. Patterns of growth form evolution within Piperales potentially mirror some of the overall trends observed among early-diverging angiosperms as a whole as well as angiosperms in general. These include profound changes in life form and growth form linked to large-scale transitions in woodiness, diversity of mechanical organization, and shifts in architectural development.

40|$|Dendrochronologists {{have used}} the {{presence}} of spiral grain {{as an indicator of}} old trees for most {{of the history of the}} field, although this relationship has been little studied. We examined cross-sections from dead trees and used a 12 -mm Haglof Swedish Increment borer to collect cores from living white oak (Quercus alba L.) trees in an Eastern Deciduous Forest stand in southwestern Illinois. Spiral grain is the alignment of wood fibers to the longitudinal axis of trees and is driven by patterns of <b>initial</b> <b>cambial</b> cell division. In this study, we examine environmental factors that may affect spiral grain severity, the usefulness of non-destructive sampling methods (using the 12 -mm increment borer), and the relationship between tree age and spiral grain. We tested Brazier’s method (1965) of averaging the spiral grain angle from two radii taken 180 degrees apart (i. e. one diameter in the tree) to get representative grain angles for the whole circumference of a tree at a certain height. The 12 -mm increment borer did not produce consistent results in this study; therefore, the collection of cross-sections is advised for the study of spiral grain in white oaks. Brazier’s method should not be used in white oaks and should not be applied universally to all tree species. The severity of spiral grain is expressed in the xylem and may not be expressed in the bark of the tree. Left spiral grain does generally increase in white oaks with age, although this relationship is not always consistent, so a tree without severe spiral grain is not necessarily young...|$|R
40|$|Radiata pine (Pinus radiata) is {{the most}} {{important}} plantation tree in New Zealand forestry, and factors that reduce the quality of wood cause significant economic loss. Two of {{the most important of these}} issues are compression wood and spiral grain. Compression wood is a type of reaction wood, formed when a tree moves away from the vertical, and is characterised by biochemical and structural changes within the wood that reduce its quality and value. Spiral grain, however, is the alignment of the wood grain in a helix around the tree’s axis and away from the vertical. Again, this reduces the structural qualities of the wood and thus its value. Spiral grain and compression wood are notorious for their deleterious effect on the quality of wood produced and are very important for the forest industry due to the huge economic loss they cause. The demand for reliable tools to evaluate these wood quality issues in clonal planting material at an early stage, within 3 years of germination rather than at 8 to 15 years as in current practise, is of ever increasing importance from plant breeders and other industry stake holders. Therefore this research was undertaken with an overall aim to develop quick, easy and reproducible techniques to evaluate young radiata pine clones (up to 3 years old) based on compression wood content and presence of spiral grain. This is important because a shortened breeding cycle could provide significant economic benefits to the forest industry. The incidence of these commercially important wood quality parameters has been studied in this thesis in research conducted on young trees (1 to 3 years old). The research described in this thesis used a variety of different imaging approaches to investigate wood structure, including polarised light and confocal microscopy, and X-ray tomography and circular polarised light scanning. The images achieved have been analysed using a range of different software, including Photoshop, ImageJ and Matlab bringing a quantification approach to the imaging. Compression wood was quantified in young clonal material using images collected with a commercial document scanner, and processed using image analysis tools available in Photoshop. An easy, reliable and robust, automatic image analysis protocol was successfully developed and tested for the detection and quantification of compression wood in these young trees. This new technique to detect and quantify compression wood was based on the thresholding of the blue channel of the scanned RGB image as this was demonstrated to contain the greatest image contrast. Development of this new technique may reduce the waiting time for screening clonal planting materials based on compression wood content. To understand the organisation of the grain at a cellular level within these young trees, confocal microscopy techniques were utilised. The cell wall characteristics and fluorescence properties of compression wood in comparison with normal wood were investigated using a new cellulose specific dye, pontamine fast scarlet 4 B. Staining protocols for this dye for confocal microscopy were optimised, and the potential of measuring the microfibril angle of the S 1 and S 3 layers of the pontamine treated opposite wood was demonstrated through either direct observations of these layers, or through the property of bifluorescence where the dye is excited only when aligned parallel to the polarisation of the incident light. Despite extensive work with confocal microscopy, this technique proved to be unsuitable for investigations of spiral grain because although it provided cellular detail, imaging was limited to the surface layers of sections, and the area over which observations were required was prohibitive. Instead of confocal microscopy, the incidence of spiral grain in young stems was investigated in two completely new ways. Resin canals, which are formed from the same <b>cambial</b> <b>initials</b> as the tracheids and which align with the grain, were used as a proxy to demonstrate the grain changes. A novel technique, using circular polarised light and a professional flatbed scanner, was developed to image whole serial transverse sections of the young stems to detect the resin canals. Using ImageJ, the number and location of resin canals was measured on vertical controls, and trees that had been rocked and leaned. The number and frequency of resin canals were less in tilted trees, especially in compression wood, compared to the higher number of canals formed in the rocked trees. More importantly, a combination of serial sectioning and this approach allowed a 3 -dimensional view of the orientation of resin canals inside a stem to be generated with ImageJ, and the angles of these canals could be measured using Matlab. The resin canals were oriented with a left-handed spiralling near the stem surface whereas the canals near to the pith were nearly straight, consistent with previous observations of the development of spiral grain in radiata pine. However, it was observed that while vertical trees had a symmetric pattern of grain and grain changes around the stem, this was not the case in tilted trees. In these, the opposite wood often had severe spiral grain visible through formation of twist whereas the compression wood formed on the lower side had bending. Consistent with this, grain associated with compression wood was significantly straighter than in opposite wood. This hitherto unknown link between the incidence of compression wood and spiral grain was investigated and explained on the basis of the characteristics of resin canals in these types of wood. X-ray micro-tomography was also used to investigate resin canals in the stubs from which serial sections were collected. The 3 D reconstructions of the resin canals showed exactly the same patterns as observed by polarised light scanning...|$|R
40|$|Graduation date: 1969 Cambial {{activity}} in white spruce stems in Alaska was observed from April, 1964 to September, 1965 in over 300 samples taken from 50 - to 60 -year-old natural stands. Mitotic index {{was used as}} a measure of the rate of periclinal division of fusiform cells in the cambial zone. Anticlinal divisions are relatively rare, occurring only about once per 278 periclinal divisions in most stems. Mitotic index, at any given time, is quite uniform throughout the cambial zone of an internode, among internodes of the same tree, and even among trees of a stand growing at markedly different rates. There may be some difference in rate of division across the radial extent of the cambial zone [...] During dormancy, the radial number of fusiform cells in the cambial zone (NCZ) ranges from two to about eight, the number being related to annual growth rate of xylem and phloem. Two to three overwintering immature (precocious) sieve cells border the cambial zone in each radial file of cells. They are the last phloem derivatives of the previous year's cambial activity. They undergo rapid radial enlargement just prior to vernal reactivation of mitosis in the cambial zone, and they become the first new conducting phloem elements of the current year. There are three distinct growing season periods: early period, grand period, and late period. Beginning of early period cambial activity is marked by reactivation of periclinal divisions, first near the apex, then at successively lower stem levels. Each <b>cambial</b> zone <b>fusiform</b> <b>initial</b> divides once before any new xylem or phloem derivatives are produced, thus approximately doubling the NCZ. Mitotic activity varies considerably during the early period, and the time required to double the NCZ varies from year to year depending upon weather conditions. Production of the first new xylem and phloem derivatives marks the beginning of the grand period. Rate of cell production in the cambial zone remains about equal to derivative production for the next 45 to 50 days, when about 80 percent of annual xylem and phloem increment is produced. Rate of division is comparatively uniform in all internodes in all trees. Rate of derivative production is, therefore, dependent on NCZ. There is a rather abrupt drop in NCZ {{at the beginning of the}} late period, apparently due to lengthening of the cell division cycle. Rate of derivative production exceeds rate of cambial zone cell production, and NCZ soon drops to about the dormant level. Subsequently, within about ten days, derivative production slows, the zone of developing tracheids begins to narrow, and radial enlargement of developing tracheids and sieve cells declines. In about two more weeks the zone of developing tracheids is almost eliminated, the most recently produced tracheids show little or no radial and there is evidence of partial inception of dormancy in the cambial zone. Complete termination of cambial activity is gradual, extending through late August and, perhaps, into September...|$|R
