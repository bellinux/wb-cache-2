[...] After that, he went to live with his father Augustus Jones, a Welsh-born United Empire Loyalist. [...] There he learnt the customs and language of the white Christian settlers of Upper Canada and was taught how to farm. [...] Jones converted to Methodism at age 21 after attending a camp-meeting with his half sister. [...] Methodist leaders in Upper Canada recognised his potential as a bridge between the white and Indian communities and recruited him as a preacher. [...] As a bilingual and bicultural preacher, he enabled the Methodists to make significant inroads with the Mississaugas and Iroquois of Upper Canada, both by translating hymns and biblical texts in Ojibwe and Mohawk and by preaching to Indians who did not understand English. [...] Beyond his preaching to the Indians of Upper Canada, he was an excellent fundraiser for the Canadian Methodists, and toured the United States and Great Britain giving sermons and speeches. [...] Jones drew audiences of thousands, filling many of the buildings he spoke in, but came to resent the role, believing the audiences came to see Kahkewāquonāby, the exotic Indian, not Peter Jones, the good Christian he <b>had</b> <b>worked</b> <b>so</b> <b>hard</b> to become.|$|E
500|$|On {{the day of}} broadcast, The Mirror {{reported}} that EastEnders producers may have to re-write the episode or run a pre-recorded rehearsal tape rather than {{go ahead with the}} live transmission, as Turner was suffering from the flu and was unable to speak. In the event, Turner recovered enough to appear, though was given permission to whisper her lines if necessary. She was able to deliver her dialogue as planned, however was too ill to appear on EastEnders Live: The Aftermath following the episode. Turner commented that nothing could have stopped her from appearing in the episode, as the cast <b>had</b> <b>worked</b> <b>so</b> <b>hard</b> on it, and it was [...] "such a big part of TV history". Several errors were made during the transmission. Barbara Windsor as Peggy incorrectly called Janine [...] "June" [...] and Maslen stumbled over several of his lines. During the final scene, a camera was visibly jostled, sound became muffled and some zoom shots [...] "misfired". Following Bradley's fall, Wood was observed inserting his fingers into his throat to help him retch. The script called for Wood to be sick, though there was not enough time for him to put the liquid into his mouth, and he stated that a person would put their fingers into their throat anyway, [...] "to get it all out". During a scene in which Roxy and Ronnie argued in the Minute Mart, Womack took a bottle of paint stripper from the shelves, but forgot to stop at the counter to pay for it before exiting.|$|E

2500|$|For all {{the concern}} about women {{stepping}} out of their traditional roles, however, many flappers were not engaged in politics. In fact, older suffragettes, who fought for the right for women to vote, viewed flappers as vapid {{and in some ways}} unworthy of the enfranchisement they <b>had</b> <b>worked</b> <b>so</b> <b>hard</b> to win. Dorothy Dunbar Bromley, a noted liberal writer at the time, summed up this dichotomy by describing flappers as [...] "truly modern", [...] "New Style" [...] feminists who [...] "admit that a full life calls for marriage and children" [...] and also [...] "are moved by an inescapable inner compulsion to be individuals in their own right".|$|E

Jesse Jackson, Jr. issued a statement that said [...] "Reverend Jackson is my dad, and I’ll always love him[...] [...]I thoroughly reject and repudiate his ugly rhetoric. He should keep hope alive and any personal attacks and insults to himself." [...] Jackson, Jr. took the statements very seriously because he <b>had</b> <b>worked</b> <b>so</b> <b>hard</b> as the National co-chair of the Barack Obama presidential campaign. Subsequent to his Fox News interview, Jackson, Sr. apologized and reiterated his support for Obama.|$|E

Changmin added that the team <b>had</b> <b>worked</b> <b>so</b> <b>hard</b> {{to the point where they}} felt like they could finally [...] "harvest the fruits of [...] labor", yet instead of being happy they had to perform their final stage with heavy hearts. JYJ responded by saying that they did not regret their decision in leaving S.M. Entertainment.
