5000|$|The [...] "crab", {{as it is}} {{commonly}} known, is the only joint service badge and can only be earned upon successful completion of the 42-week course at the Naval School of Explosive Ordnance Disposal (NAVSCOLEOD) located at Eglin Air Force Base, Florida. Prior to attending NAVSCOLEOD, Navy service members attend Naval Diving and Salvage Training Center (NDSTC) in Panama City, FL for a 9 week <b>EOD</b> <b>Diver</b> Course, Additionally the Naval students will attend the maritime ordnance section known as [...] "Area 8" [...] followed by Underwater division. After NAVSCOLEOD, Navy service members attend a 3-4 week course to earn [...] "jump wings" [...] at the Army's Ft. Benning, GA. Army service members will attend a course at Fort Lee, VA for 9-11 weeks before attending NAVSCOLEOD.|$|E

5000|$|The Group used {{a variety}} of methods, {{including}} MH-53E Sea Dragon helicopters towing magnetic minesweeping sleds, trained marine mammals, unmanned underwater vehicles and <b>EOD</b> <b>divers.</b> On 28 March a 200 yd-wide channel was declared safe, and the British auxiliary vessel [...] docked at Umm Qasr Port and began offloading hundreds of tons of food and water. Work continued for weeks after that, widening the channel.|$|R
50|$|Using the MH-53E Sea Dragon helicopter, they patrol {{foreign and}} {{domestic}} waters to locate and destroy sea-based mines that would harm watercraft and map safe sea-lanes of travel. Mines can be triggered by any number of methods ranging from contact to an electronic signature. While the aircraft hovers safely above the sea, {{it is capable of}} dragging through the water a wide variety of instruments and machines to accomplish the mission. In harbors, coordination with <b>EOD</b> <b>Divers</b> helps to clear more shallow waters safely.|$|R

When two insignia are worn they are ordered {{from top to bottom}} in the following order with [...] separation in between: <b>diver,</b> <b>EOD,</b> parachutist, aviation. A Marine with more than one insignia within the parachutist, <b>EOD</b> and <b>diver</b> groups may only wear the senior insignia of the group. Marines may wear two insignia from the aviation group.|$|R
25|$|The Navy {{has over}} 600 personnel. The Navy {{consists}} of the Warship Flotilla, the Sea Coastal Surveillance System, the Explosive Ordnance Disposal (<b>EOD)</b> <b>Divers</b> Team, the Naval Logistic Service, Training Center and Maritime Rescue Coordination Center. The flotilla is the core component of the Navy, and {{consists of the}} Mine Countermeasures Squadron, the Patrol Ships Squadron, and the Harbour Boats Group. The current Commander in Chief of the Lithuanian Navy is Rear Admiral Kęstutis Macijauskas. The Naval base and Headquarters {{are located in the}} city of Klaipėda. The Navy uses patrol ships for coastal surveillance.|$|R

5000|$|Meanwhile, British and French <b>EOD</b> <b>divers</b> were {{conducting}} {{their own}} searches. Through double-sweeping and, at times, triple-sweeping various areas, more complete coverage could be obtained. Inevitably, each group found items missed by previous divers. The Royal Navy used three minehunting ships, with their high-resolution sonar equipment, {{and an independent}} diving group known as the Fleet Clearance DivingTeam. The French Navy used both minehunting ships in an active role and minesweepers as support ships. When all the search operations covered by [...] "Nimbus Moon (Water)" [...] were finished in December 1974, {{a large amount of}} ordnance had been discovered: ...|$|R
40|$|The Global War on Terrorism has {{generated}} increased manning requirements for United States Special Operations Forces. Elite military forces are increasingly critical {{to success in}} modern conflict and are {{at the forefront of}} current military strategy for effectively engaging in unconventional warfare. In the US Navy, special forces’ personnel are comprised of four groups: SEALs (SEa/Air/Land), Special Warfare Combatant Crewmen (SWCCs), Explosive Ordnance Disposal technicians (<b>EODs),</b> <b>Divers,</b> and Air Rescue Crews. A significant challenge in meeting the new manning requirements is the historically high attrition rate in SEAL training, the Basic Underwater Demolition / SEAL course (BUD/S). This paper focuses on research and strategies aimed at reducing this attrition by improving selection methods and processes for identifying viable training candidates. It is a technical paper, including preliminary analyses of training data, but also a conceptual paper describing a comprehensive approach to meeting emerging personnel needs. US Navy SEAL training is among the most arduous military training programs in the world. As such, BUD/S program attrition is very high; historically, only about 30 % o...|$|R
50|$|On March 21, 2003, {{the battle}} was started with an amphibious assault by British 3 Commando Brigade of the Royal Marines, and spearheaded on land by the US 15th Marine Expeditionary Unit, {{supported}} by Polish GROM troops. Iraqi forces put up unexpectedly strong resistance, requiring several days' fighting before the area was cleared of defenders. After the waterway was de-mined by a Detachment from HM-14 and Naval Special Clearance Team ONE of the U.S. Navy and reopened, Umm Qasr {{played an important role}} in the shipment of humanitarian supplies to Iraqi civilians.The port was declared safe and open on March 25th 2003, after Royal Marines took over control of the port and conducted raids into the old part of town. Coalition minesweepers, including HMS Bangor (M109), aided by US Navy divers, MH-53E Sea Dragon helicopters towing magnetic minesweeping sleds, unmanned underwater vehicles, <b>EOD</b> <b>divers,</b> plus trained dolphins and seals; located and cleared the approach to the port of underwater mines. On 28 March a 200-yard-wide channel was declared safe, and the Royal Fleet Auxiliary RFA Sir Galahad docked to begin offloading hundreds of tons of food and water. Work continued for six weeks after that, widening the channel.|$|R
5000|$|At {{the same}} time the land {{operation}} was concluding, a water clearance operation called [...] "Nimbus Moon (Water)" [...] was underway. It continued to run until the end of 1974and, at a much reduced rate, on into 1975. In [...] ""Nimbus Moon (Water)", U.S. Navy <b>EOD</b> <b>divers</b> were to provide both diving and explosives training to Egyptian Navymen. While the Americans were prohibited from actual ordnance operations, they accompanied the Egyptians in the diving boats, serving as on-scene advisors. The canal was searched from bank to bank by an American sonar installed in a Suez Canal Authority pilot boat. Linked with a precise radio navigation system, the sonar made highly accurate charts of the canal bottom. These charts were given to the diving advisors, who directed the Egyptians in systematic investigations of likely ordnance contacts. The ordnance that was discovered, ranging from hand grenades to 907 kg bombs, was usually destroyed in place with explosive charges. Non-ordnance items, from oil drums to tanks, were marked for later removal by Egyptian police divers. Because the canal was slated for future dredging, every piece of refuse of any substantial size had to be removed. The American-Egyptian team completed one full sweep of the canal bottom in late November 1974.|$|R
25|$|In {{addition}} to Marine Corps detachments, combat utilities are also worn by Navy SEAL teams, along with SWCC crews who conduct clandestine maritime operations including supporting SEAL platoons and SOF cells. The Combat Utility Uniform (CUU) is authorized {{for those in}} the Explosive Ordnance Disposal (<b>EOD)</b> and Fleet <b>Diver</b> communities. Combat utilities are also authorized for those attached to the Naval Construction Force (NCF) (Seabee), Navy's Expeditionary Logistics Group, or the Navy's Expeditionary Combat Command (NECC). Also, Navy personnel assigned to some joint headquarters units, like Central Command in Qatar and Iraq, wear Desert Utility Uniforms (DUU). Navy personnel such as Individual Augmentees, Combat Camera Groups, Detainee OPS, and some in the special warfare community have been wearing the Army's ACU (Army Combat Uniform) when working closely with or attached to Army commands.|$|R
5000|$|Most {{branches}} of the US military use modified, enhanced tests of the regular tests of physical stamina and performance as minimum requirements for applicants to special or elite programs. Some of these programs are SEAL, SWCC, Navy <b>Diver,</b> <b>EOD,</b> and other Special Operations Forces. These tests usually include extra components so that running, swimming, and pullups are all assessed in addition to situps, pushups, and the cardiovascular portion. In some cases pushups techniques and swim strokes may be particular to a certain group, including [...] "diver (triceps) pushups", [...] "combat sidestroke" [...] swim strokes done in full uniform with boots by SEAL and SWCC applicants, and strictly monitored pull-up technique.Within these communities enhanced tests may be given {{in place of the}} regular tests, deriving and reporting the data needed for the minimum requirements of the service and maintaining additional data such as swim and pullup data to meet the requirements of their special program.|$|R
