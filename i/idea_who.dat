5|$|Some misguided Hollywood {{press agent}} sought to alter Como's life story by {{changing}} his previous occupation from barber to coal miner, claiming {{it would make}} for better press. Fred Othman, a Hollywood columnist, publicly stated that he believed Como the barber was just a publicity gimmick. Perry gave him a shave and haircut at the Fox Studios barber shop to prove him wrong. In 1985, Como related {{the story of his}} first film role experience in Something for the Boys. He sat ready to work in his dressing room for two weeks without being called. Perry spent the next two weeks playing golf, still not missed by the studio. It was five weeks before he was actually called to the set, despite the studio's initial urgent report for work notice. When Como finally appeared, the director had no <b>idea</b> <b>who</b> he was.|$|E

500|$|Best's replacement, Ringo Starr, {{accompanied}} the band on their second recording session with EMI at Abbey Road studios on 4 September 1962. George Martin initially {{refused to let}} Starr play, {{due to the fact}} that he had no <b>idea</b> <b>who</b> he was at that time, and to avoid any risks of his drumming still not being good enough. On 11 September 1962 at the third EMI recording session Martin used session musician Andy White on the drums for the whole session and not Starr, as Martin had already booked White after the first session with Best. Starr played tambourine on some songs while White played drums. Starr told Hunter Davies years later that he had thought, [...] "That's the end. They're pulling a Pete Best on me." ...|$|E
