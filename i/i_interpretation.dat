50|$|Since {{a strict}} {{adherence}} {{to either of}} the two sections of the Constitution could yield opposing interpretations, there was, naturally, much disagreement when the matter was first put to the test. Any question regarding the Vice President succeeding to the Presidency was essentially resolved in April 1841 when John Tyler succeeded William Henry Harrison upon Harrison's death. Tyler {{made it clear that he}} was the President rather than the Vice President acting as such, thus establishing precedent in accordance with the Article <b>I</b> <b>interpretation.</b> Constitutional scholars, while not generally criticizing Tyler's actions, nonetheless were uncomfortable with the informality of this process and could easily imagine problematic situations in which the applicability of the precedent would not be clear.

Second, by treating implicatures of discourse units which may consist of more than one sentence, it avoids the limitations of a sentence-at-a-time approach.

These formations are particularly targeted for storage in saline cavities. In order to study potential for such storage, a geological and hydrogeological is led on a area of about 500 km 2.

The 3 D model is based on (<b>i)</b> <b>interpretation</b> of thirteen 2 D reprocessed seismic profiles and two regional reprocessed seismic lines, (ii) 127 petroleum and BSS (Subsurface Database) wells and (iii) geological maps at 1 / 50 000 scale.

40|$|Certification of {{modeling}} and simulation (M&S) applications poses significant technical challenges for M&S program managers, engineers, and practitioners. Certification is becoming increasingly more important as M&S applications are used more and more for military training, complex system design evaluation, M&S-based acquisition, problem solving, and critical decision making. Certification, a very complex process, involves the measurement and evaluation of hundreds of qualitative and quantitative elements, mandates subject matter expert evaluation, and requires the integration of different evaluations. Planning and managing such measurements and evaluations requires a unifying methodology {{and should not be}} performed in an ad hoc manner. This paper presents such a methodology. The methodology consists of the following body of methods, rules, and postulates: (a) employment of subject matter experts, (b) construction of a hierarchy of indicators, (c) relative criticality weighting of indicators using the analytic hierarchy process, (d) using a rule-based expert knowledge base with an object-oriented specification language, (e) assignment of crisp, fuzzy, and nominal scores for the indicators, (f) aggregation of indicator scores, (g) graphical representation of the indicator scores and weights, (h) hypertext certification report, and (<b>i)</b> <b>interpretation</b> of the results.

40|$|Since 1988, the National Institute for Space Research (INPE) has {{produced}} annual rates of deforestation in the Amazon forest. This rate is achieved basically in two steps: (<b>i)</b> <b>interpretation</b> and generation of deforestation polygons based on satellite images; and (ii) normalization of quantitative deforestation {{in relation to}} the acquisition date and amount of cloud cover in each satellite image. This work makes use of polygons generated in the first step of the PRODES methodology to support the idea that each year the most of the occurrences of deforestation happens in the same macro-regions defined by the Kernel density map. In other words, what it is intended to demonstrate is that regions concentrating occurrences of deforestation in one year can be used to delimitate the regions of high probability of occurrence of deforestation in the next year. The main result on this study is the finding that, in the last six years, an average of 82 % of the occurrences of deforestation are concentrated inside an area corresponding to 26. 6 % of the total Amazon area. The motivation for this work arose from the need to optimize the human and material resources used in field operations to combat deforestation in the Amazon forest conducted by the Brazilian Institute of Environment (IBAMA) under the Plan for Prevention and Control of Deforestation in the Amazon (PPCDAM).

The components of my creative project are my March 1, 2011 senior recital and program notes as well as a CD recording of my performance. The artist's statement details my growth as a musician throughout my performance preparation of each piece. Memorization, musical interpretation, repertoire selection, and risk-taking are four facets of musical artistry. This list is by no means exhaustive, but the music on my program represents each of these four aspects. All of the pieces I studied this year required growth, but each strengthened me in different ways. In my artist's statement, I pair these four aspects of artistic growth with the recital program repertoire to demonstrate my development as a pianist. Memorization J. S.

40|$|Abstract <b>I</b> <b>Interpretation</b> {{of urine}} drug-testing results is a {{challenging}} endeavor for several reasons. Effects of pH, dilution, legitimate and illicit {{sources of the}} drugs, and, perhaps the most challenging, {{the possibility of the}} methampbetamine and/or amphetamine being the result of the use of some other drug. Although it is known that 14 different compounds are metabolized to methamphetamine or amphetamine or both, there is little information on the metabolic profile of many of these compounds, making interpretation of results difficult. Benzphetamine, administered as a single Didrex tablet, was given to 10 subjects (7 male and 3 female) and urine samples collected for the next 7 days. Gas chromatography-mass spectrometry results showed 3 of the 10 subjects did not have a single urine sample that exceeded a 500 -ng/mL cutoff or amphetamine or methamphetamine. The other subjects had between one and six samples that tested positive at or above that level. Two subjects excreted more methamphetamine than amphetamine, whereas the other eight excreted greater amounts of amphetamine than methamphetamine. The observed ratio between amphetamine and methamphetamine was significantly different than what would be expected from the use of methamphetamine. Results of this study indicate the metabolism of benzphetamine to desmethylbenzphetamine is a major pathway in the metabolism of the drug. Enantiomer analysis of the methamphetamine and amphetamine revealed only the d-enantiomer. Results of this study add significant information useful to interpret the possibility of benzphetamine as the origin of methamphetamine and amphetamine in urine samples...|$|E
