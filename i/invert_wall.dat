They are important environmental issues related with {{the operation of}} underground networks in intensively-populated urban areas. An accurate prediction for this train-induced vibration can be very helpful {{in the implementation of}} countermeasures to achieve the control of vibration or noise levels. In this paper, a numerical model is introduced based on the 2. 5 D Finite Element / Boundary Element methodology. The part of the metro line concerned is built with a cast-iron tunnel lining. The tunnel structure and the track are modelled with finite elements while the ground is modelled using boundary elements. Then the 2. 5 D tracktunnel-ground model is coupled with a multiple-rigid body vehicle model to determine the response caused by the passage of a train. To validate the prediction results, measurements have been carried out of the vibration of the rail, tunnel <b>invert,</b> tunnel <b>wall</b> and ground surface when the train is passing by and these are compared with the predictions with good agreement...|$|R

40|$|From February 1997 to January 1999, I was {{provided}} with a small office N 51 - 113 {{on the ground floor}} of building N 51. In the spring of 1998 I undertook the construction of a full scale inverted replica of this office as a free standing pavilion extracted from the body of its architectural context. This pavilion, situated at the entrance gate of the courtyard of building N 51 was carefully replicated using identical materials and exact scale for every detail. By <b>inverting</b> the <b>walls</b> of my office, interior and exterior surfaces are exactly turned inside-out. In the fall of 1998 the pavilion was completed and inaugurated unobtrusively to the inhabitants of its immediate neighbourhood. Soon after completion, weather conditions began the gradual deterioration of the exposed drywall of the pavilion's walls, this decreased the organization of the pavilion, while increasing entropy of the inverted room, as it was extracted from the body of building N 51, and exposed, allowing the inevitable process of decay. I realized that every detail event in this process, of construction and entropy, has aesthetic meaning. My subsequent dismantling of this pavilion addresses the issue of time and temporality within the processes of appearing and disappearing. In late January 1999 I carefully dismantled the pavilion piece by piece, reversing the construction process from the end to the beginning, completing the cycle.

In some species the snapping zooids are mounted on a peduncle (stalk), their bird-like appearance responsible for the term - Charles Darwin described these as like [...] "the head and beak of a vulture in miniature, seated on a neck and capable of movement".

Currently, inspections are conducted at regular intervals to ensure a sufficient integrity level of these assets. Cost reduction while maintaining a high level of reliability and safety of installations is a major challenge. There are many situations where the actual defect location is not accessible, e. g., a pipe support or a partially buried pipe. Guided wave tomography has been developed to reconstruct the wall thickness of steel pipes. In case of bottom of the line corrosion, i. e., a single corrosion pit, a simpler approach may be followed. Data is collected in a pitch-catch configuration at the 12 o'clock position using highly dispersive guided waves. After dispersion correction the data collapses to a short pulse, any residual dispersion indicates wall loss. The phase spectrum is used to <b>invert</b> for the <b>wall</b> thickness profile in the circumferential direction, assuming a Gaussian defect profile. The approach is evaluated on numerically simulated and on measured data. The method is intended for rapid, semi-quantitative screening of pipes...|$|R

This paper {{presents}} a new boundary integral equation (BIE) method for simulating particulate and mul-tiphase flows through periodic channels of arbitrary smooth shape in two dimensions.

The authors first studied these features at Makapansgat (fig. 1) some fifteen years ago and have since then become aware of their very widespread occurrence in soluble rocks in many parts of the world. All subsequent information has served to confirm the origin of these features, but, since these were never published, it is worthwhile to place these findings on record. Solution cavities, or Makondos, in the Transvaal cave breccias are soil-filled pits shaped like an <b>inverted</b> cone.

40|$|Future robotic {{exploration}} of near-Earth asteroids and the vertical and <b>inverted</b> rock <b>walls</b> of lava caves and cliff faces on Mars and other planetary bodies {{would require a}} method of gripping their rocky surfaces to allow mobility without gravitational assistance. In order to successfully navigate this terrain and drill for samples, the grippers {{must be able to}} produce anchoring forces in excess of 100 N. Additionally, the grippers must be able to support the inertial forces of a moving robot, as well gravitational forces for demonstrations on Earth. One possible solution would be to use microspine arrays to anchor to rock surfaces and provide the necessary load-bearing abilities for robotic {{exploration of}} asteroids. Microspine arrays comprise dozens of small steel hooks supported on individual suspensions. When these arrays are dragged along a rock surface, the steel hooks engage with asperities and holes on the surface. The suspensions allow for individual hooks to engage with asperities while the remaining hooks continue to drag along the surface. This ensures that the maximum possible number of hooks engage with the surface, thereby increasing the load-bearing abilities of the gripper. Using the microspine array grippers described above as the end-effectors of a robot would allow it to traverse terrain previously unreachable by traditional wheeled robots. Furthermore, microspine-gripping robots that can perch on cliffs or rocky walls could enable a new class of persistent surveillance devices for military applications. In order to interface these microspine grippers with a legged robot, an ankle is needed that can robotically actuate the gripper, as well as allow it to conform to the large-scale irregularities in the rock. The anchor serves three main purposes: deploy and release the anchor, conform to roughness or misalignment with the surface, and cancel out any moments about the anchor that could cause unintentional detachment. The ankle design contains a rotary DC motor that can drag the microspine arrays across the surface to engage them with asperities, as well as a linear actuator to disengage the hooks from the surface. Additionally, the ankle allows the gripper to rotate freely about all three axes so that when the robot takes a step, the gripper may optimally orient itself with respect to the wall or ground. Finally, the ankle contains some minimal elasticity, so that between steps, the gripper returns to a default position that is roughly parallel to the wall...|$|R
40|$|Coronary artery bypass {{grafting}} {{remains the}} most effective and durable treatment for severe coronary artery disease, but causes significant patient trauma. Efforts to improve the procedure by avoiding cardiopulmonary bypass and/ or by limiting the access are hampered by the increased difficulties of hand suturing the graft connections. Automated anastomotic devices may address these difficulties, provided that current performance standards are matched. For this purpose, the S micro-stapler has been developed. The device has been designed to minimize tissue trauma as well as intraluminal artefact and to provide an easy deployment procedure. To improve reliability, a specific sequence has been built-in, first presenting the tissue using device expansion prior to stapling. Accepted unconventional anastomosis properties are pulsatility non-compliance, <b>inverted</b> vessel <b>wall</b> apposition and a clipped, blind sac, resulting from converting the side-to-side geometry to an end-to-side configuration. Device dimensions are compatible with the majority of internal thoracic artery (ITA) to left anterior descending artery (LAD) anastomoses. Remote actuation minimizes undue movements during deployment, and allows endoscopic application. The preclinical validation included extensive in vitro tests using porcine as well as human tissue, and met preset standards. Chronic tests of the device compared anastomosis patency, remodeling and hemodynamic function to conventionally sutured controls in the off-pump porcine model. The connector rapidly and consistently produced high quality ITA to LAD anastomoses. Thirteen MHz epicardial ultrasound proved effective for intraoperatively assessing anastomosis quality, despite the presence of a metal connector. Evaluation at up to 6 months using angiography, fractional flow reserve measurements and intravascular ultrasound showed 100 % patency with an effective vascular remodeling response, resulting in unobstructed anastomoses with excellent hemodynamic function in all cases. Histology showed a stabilized neo-intima {{on the inside of the}} anastomoses that was thinner than in the sutured controls. The device’s performance fully met current standards on patency and function. Unconventional aspects like a noncompliant intraluminal ring and a side-to-side to end-to-side converted configuration did not interfere with favorable anastomosis healing. To chart clinical failure modes and to assess the relevance to the S micro-stapler, all publications up to August 2007 on anastomotic devices that included systematic elective angiographic imaging were systematically reviewed. Marked outcome differences between individual devices were found, but could not be correlated to demographic, operative or follow-up differences, anticoagulation regime or device properties like expansion mode, pulsatility non-compliance, implant material or blood exposed non-intimal surface. Significant device and surgery related issues included graft thrombosis, graft kinking and stenosing intimal hyperplasia. Selected devices performed well, and showed that substantial equivalence to the gold standard of tailor-made, hand-sewn anastomoses is possible for automated, intrinsically standardized systems. The design characteristics of the S micro-stapler are well directed at avoiding the observed patency issues, and support expectations of favorable clinical results. In conclusion, reliable anastomotic technology could be the key to mainstream less invasive and port access CABG procedures on the beating heart. The S micro-stapler has the promise to be such a technology, provided that the favorable preclinical results are validated in humans...|$|R
40|$|Yucca Mountain, Nevada {{has been}} {{designated}} as the nation's high-level radioactive waste repository and the U. S. Department of Energy has been approved {{to apply to the}} U. S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission for a license to construct a repository. Heat transfer in the Yucca Mountain Project (YMP) drift enclosures is an important aspect of repository waste emplacement. Canisters containing radioactive waste are to be emplaced in tunnels drilled 500 m below the ground surface. After repository closure, decaying heat is transferred from waste packages to the host rock by a combination of thermal radiation, natural convection and conduction heat transfer mechanism?. Current YMP mountain-scale and drift-scale numerical models often use a simplified porous medium code to model fluid and heat flow in the drift openings. To account for natural convection heat transfer, the thermal conductivity of the air was increased in the porous medium model. The equivalent thermal conductivity, defined as the ratio of total heat flow to conductive heat flow, used in the porous media models was based on horizontal concentric cylinders. Such modeling does not effectively capture turbulent natural convection in the open spaces as discussed by Webb et al. (2003) yet the approach is still widely used on the YMP project. In order to mechanistically model natural convection conditions in YMP drifts, the computational fluid dynamics (CFD) code FLUENT (Fluent, Incorporated, 2001) has been used to model natural convection heat transfer in the YMP emplacement drifts. A two-dimensional (2 D) model representative of YMP geometry (e. g., includes waste package, drip shield, <b>invert</b> and drift <b>wall)</b> has been developed and numerical simulations made (Francis et al., 2003). Using CFD simulation results for both natural convection and conduction-only heat transfer in a single phase, single component fluid, equivalent thermal conductivities have been calculated for different Rayleigh numbers. Correlation equations for equivalent thermal conductivity as a function of Rayleigh number were developed for the Yucca Mountain geometry and comparisons were made to experimental data and correlations found in the literature on natural convection in horizontal concentric cylinders, a geometry similar to YMP. The objective of this work is to compare the results of CFD natural convection simulations and conduction-only calculations that used the equivalent thermal conductivity to represent heat transfer by turbulent natural convection. The FLUENT code was used for both simulations with heat generation boundary condition at the waste package and constant temperature boundary condition 5 meters into the host rock formation. Comparisons are made of temperature contours in the drift air and temperature profiles at surfaces of the different engineered components using the two approaches. The results show that for the two-dimensional YMP geometry considered, the average surface temperatures of the CFD natural convection and conduction-only using the equivalent thermal conductivity are similar and the maximum local temperature differences for the different surfaces were within two 2 C. The differences in temperature profiles reflect the use of a constant equivalent thermal conductivity. The effect of the differences is discussed...|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} {{excavating}} a tunnel is not fulfilled {{unless it is}} stable. One of the major causes of instability in tunnels is induced stresses around it. Tunnels excavated in weak and schistose rock mass below high overburden (rock cover) are prone to instability {{in the form of}} tunnel deformation. The deformation in the tunnel takes place {{to such an extent that}} it is irreversible and of significant magnitude, which is often known as tunnel squeezing. In order to limit such plastic deformation in tunnels, it is desirable that the response of the rock mass to the induced stresses is known so that requirement of rock support can be estimated. Rock support interaction is an important tool in such endeavor; and the Convergence Confinement Method is the common approach used for this purpose. Contrary to the assumption of uniform in-situ stresses made in analytical solutions for elasto-plastic analyses, large degree of stress anisotropy condition prevails in most tunnelling conditions. The effect of such anisotropic stress condition leads to varying degrees of deformations around the tunnel contour. Therefore, stress anisotropy is also an important factor that needs to be addressed to ensure a proper support design for tunnels. This thesis assesses the inter-relationship among rock mass property, in-situ stresses including horizontal to vertical stress ratio, tunnel support pressure and deformation. The work is based on the tunnel cases from the Nepal Himalaya. For this purpose, four completed tunnel projects from that region were selected, where moderate to large tunnel deformations had been recorded. Long term deformation records were analyzed to assess time independent and time dependent deformations. Furthermore, the behavior of average quality rock mass was also evaluated using the records of multiple point borehole extensometer monitored at four tunnel sections. Evaluations were made addressing both the rock mas around the tunnel wall and at depth. In addition, the effect of groundwater on tunnel stability in faulted rock mass was also assessed in a severely squeezed tunnel. Results of the analyses of the tunnels in weak and schistose rock mass at stress anisotropy states show that a good correlation among tunnel strain, rock mass shear modulus, support pressure, vertical stress and stress ratio of horizontal to vertical stresses exists. Moreover, the study also shows that significant amount of time dependent deformation can occur in such weak rock mass. Such deformation was found to be high in schist and micaceous phyllite, moderate in graphitic phyllite and low in siliceous phyllite. Similarly, analyses incorporating instrumentation data in average quality rocks show that stress anisotropy cause tensional cracks in tunnel crown and <b>inverts</b> whereas tunnel <b>walls</b> will have compressional failures. Moreover, the study also shows that deformation patterns in tunnels are altered by in-homogeneity in the rock mass. The study on the effect of groundwater in tunnel stability in faulted rock mass shows that groundwater can increase the tunnel strain on average 15 % depending on distance from tunnel face and location in the tunnel. This study suggests relationships that can be used as a basis for an early estimate of instantaneous and final deformations and the corresponding requirement of support pressures in tunnel walls in weak and schistose rock mass. The suggested relationships, however, are for the tunnels in plane strain conditions where face effect is not incorporated. Moreover, the relationships are based on a limited number of tunnel cases. Therefore, further validation is needed using other tunnel cases subjected to plastic deformation. PhD i geologi og bergteknikkPhD in Geology and Mineral Resources Engineerin...|$|R

Then follows a discussion of the literature of the subject, and an outline of the scope of the present thesis. Charter II: The solution is carried through using Fourier Integral technique for the two dimensional plane strain case. Stresses and displacements are obtained for a concentrated line load. Chapter III: The results of Chapter II are applied to determine the surface settlements, vertical pressures, and shears for a symmetrically loaded strip called "the unit strip" of width two units. The following special load distributions are investigated: concentrated, uniform, parabolic, <b>inverted</b> parabolic, hollow <b>wall,</b> and rigid wall. Extension is then made to a strip of any arbitrary width 2 a, and settlements are obtained by means of influence factors, (Graph I). An examination is made of the influence of the type of load distribution, demonstrating St. Venant's principle of equipollent loads. Chapter IV: The equations of Chapter I are solved for an axially symmetric loading by transforming to polar co-ordinates and using Fourier-Bessel Integral technique. The solution is carried through for the concentrated load case, and the results check those given by Mitchell (6). Chapter V: An investigation similar to that made in Chapter III is made for a loaded circular area of unit radius. The results are then extended to a circle of any arbitrary width a. Surface settlements are obtained quickly by means of influence factors (Graph II). In {{the latter part of the}} Chapter series expansions are obtained for the stresses and displacements at any point in the mass, and application is made to some of the more practical load distributions. Chapter VI: Corresponding results for an elastic isotropic medium, to those given in above chapters, are obtained by the application of a limiting technique to above results. The ease with which the results are obtained is striking. A discussion is given of the infinite surface displacements that are usually obtained in two-dimensional problems. Chapter VII: In this chapter a review is made of the literature of the three constant medium. The physical significance of the assumptions and the measure of fulfillment of these assumptions by some types of wood, and by some crystals, is examined. Some errors are noted, and corrected. Finally all are shown to be just particular cases of the medium of Chapter II, without having the redeeming feature of simplicity over the more general theory. Chapter VIII: Results for Orthotropic plates are deduced from those given in Chapter II by a change of constants. Chapter IX: Typical problems in soil mechanics connected with a loaded column, and with a loaded wall, are worked out in detail. Graph III shows for a particular case the effect aeolotropy may have on the vertical stress distributions in a loaded soil. A brief outline is made of some other problems in an aeolotropic medium capable of solution by the methods of this thesis. Appendix F: Practical methods are given for the determination of the required constants. The value of skew samples is shown. The results obtained in this thesis for an aeolotropic medium, apart from the concentrated case given by Mitchell(6), are new. A good test of the accuracy of the work is provided by the known isotropic elastic results obtained by a limiting procedure in Chapter VI. As far as the author is aware, some of the results of Chapter VI are new also. The direct application of Fourier Integral technique to the displacement equations of equilibrium is very rare in elastic problems. This thesis illustrates the power and simplicity of such an approach. Finally, as shown in Chapter IX the results are very readily adapted to practical use...|$|R
40|$|Hydropower {{development}} has resurged {{in the developed}} and in the developing countries due to the global issue of climate change, the need to reduce carbon footprints {{and the need to}} achieve energy stability and energy security. The IPCC‟s fourth Assessment Report (AR 4) had showed that renewable energy (RE) has the potential to contribute to the mitigation of climate change via the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions in the energy sector. Therefore, hydropower is to remain as the largest renewable source of electricity generation and its development is going to play vital roles in the supply of reliable and sustainable energy for the socio-economic development of many developing countries. The topography and large annual volumes of water flow in Bhutan combine to give huge hydropower potential. With the gross estimated capacity of 30000 MW, the energy sector is expected to {{play a significant role in}} the Bhutanese economy as a major source of revenue. Apart from the need to meeting the increasing growth in domestic energy demand, there is a huge possibility of exporting the power to India and generate revenue. The shortage of power and the thermal driven nature of the Indian grid offer ready market for the hydroelectricity from Bhutan. As such, in order to exploit this opportunity, the government has placed high priority on accelerated hydropower development. It has set ambitious target to add minimum of 10000 MW generation capacities by 2020. Several large hydropower projects are under construction and many are in the planning stages. With the accelerated hydropower development taking place in the country, the construction of tunnels and underground works are going to increase considerably in the future. Hydropower plants have to be necessarily put underground in view of the limited stable surface space and the environmental concerns, as more than 51 % of the national territory falls within the protected areas of national parks and biological corridors meant for environmental conservation. However, underground construction remains a challenge in the Himalayas. Due to active tectonics and weathering, the rocks are highly deformed, schistose and altered. Predicting rock mass quality and stability of underground constructions is difficult during planning due to high overburden, forest coverage and rugged nature of topography. Hydropower projects have experienced high discrepancies in the predicted and actual rock mass and encountered major adverse geological occurrences in tunneling, resulting in delay and cost overrun. In this thesis, engineering geological study of the Punatsangchu Stage – I Hydroelectric Project in Bhutan has been done with the aim to study the stability assessment and support requirement in Headrace tunnel and Powerhouse caverns. The details of planning and investigation works done during preparation of detailed project report have been utilized in the study. Details on rock mass collected during visit to construction site have been incorporated. The thesis deals with the review of engineering geological investigations which includes geological mapping and assessment of rock mass conditions, laboratory and in-situ tests and measurements; determination of engineering parameters of rock mass; stability assessment and estimation of rock support requirements with wedge analysis, empirical approaches and numerical modeling with Phase 2 finite element program. The HRT is a low pressure tunnel and hydraulic fracturing is not occurring even at the point of surge shaft where the maximum hydrostatic pressure is 0. 74 MPa while the minimum confining in-situ rock stress is 3. 5 MPa at the point with minimum rock cover. But due to stress redistribution after excavation, the confining stress around the tunnel periphery reduces to almost zero, which would lead to opening up of joints and raveling of rocks. Tunnel lining with concrete is necessary. However, this is only an indication as there are still uncertainties with the assumptions in the analysis. The HRT is aligned unfavorably with one minor joint set for more than 2 km stretch towards upstream of adit 1. The wedge analysis shows that in general, with the major discontinuities mapped during construction, there is formation of roof wedge in the tunnel arch back but not in the ribs. The most critical wedge indicates wedge apex height of about 5 m. This is the basis for the lengths of rock bolts in HRT. Goel‟s empirical approach qualifies the HRT at maximum rock overburden (> 500 m) for the mild squeezing condition with poor rock mass. Rock burst will not be the problem with poor jointed rock mass. With the Q-method, the ratio of maximum tangential stress and UCS of rock mass estimated by empirical methods is high, indicating heavy squeezing condition. Rock slabbing and popping is possible during heading from the junction of <b>invert</b> and <b>walls</b> due to high stress concentration in the area. During benching, the stress concentration is reduced. Deformations in the plastic analysis even after application of supports are higher than the elastic limits but are considered acceptable. The Powerhouse caverns have also been analyzed with numerical modeling. There are potential wedge formation in the cavern arch back and ribs. The most critical wedge apex heights indicates the requirement of roof bolt length of 8 - 10 m long and wall bolt length of 12 - 13 m long. The minimum distance of the rock pillar between Machine hall and Transformer hall needed is 50 - 53. 5 m. The deformation and yielding of rock mass around excavation periphery is huge. The maximum displacement in the Machine hall walls occurs at elevations from 844. 5 masl to 864. 5 masl while in Transformer hall it occurs from elevation 856. 5 masl to 867. 5 masl after full excavation. After application of full supports, the maximum displacement in Machine hall is about 174 mm occurring on the walls. This is higher than the elastic limit of 71. 8 mm but is considered acceptable. In the Transformer hall, the maximum displacement is about 111 mm and occurs in the downstream wall (R/S of the section). The stage-wise displacements in the cavern excavation vary and are given in Appendix 8 - 3. The support requirements are heavy but the results are only indicative and have to be verified with instrumentation and back analysis. Parametric study of underground excavation is carried out with the HRT section by independently varying some key rock parameters and observing displacements occurring in the excavation section. GSI is the most important rock mass parameter in the numerical analysis. It has great influence on the tunnel displacement. More importantly, it influences all other engineering parameters used in the analysis. Rock parameters have to be chosen/determined carefully that best represent the actual site condition. </p...|$|R
