50|$|During {{the early}} phase of {{ventricular}} diastole, as the ventricular muscle relaxes, {{pressure on the}} remaining blood within the ventricle begins to fall. When pressure within the ventricles drops below pressure in both the pulmonary trunk and aorta, blood flows back toward the heart, producing the <b>dicrotic</b> <b>notch</b> (small dip) seen in blood pressure tracings. The semilunar valves close to prevent backflow into the heart. Since the atrioventricular valves remain closed at this point, there is {{no change in the}} volume of blood in the ventricle, so the early phase of ventricular diastole is called the isovolumic ventricular relaxation phase, also called isovolumetric ventricular relaxation phase.|$|E
50|$|The pulsatile {{nature of}} blood flow creates a pulse wave that is {{propagated}} down the arterial tree, and at bifurcations reflected waves rebound {{to return to}} semilunar valves and {{the origin of the}} aorta. These return waves create the <b>dicrotic</b> <b>notch</b> displayed in the aortic pressure curve during the cardiac cycle as these reflected waves push on the aortic semilunar valve. With age, the aorta stiffens such that the pulse wave is propagated faster and reflected waves return to the heart faster before the semilunar valve closes, which raises the blood pressure. The stiffness of the aorta is associated with a number of diseases and pathologies, and noninvasive measures of the pulse wave velocity are an independent indicator of hypertension. Measuring the pulse wave velocity (invasively and non-invasively) is a means of determining arterial stiffness. Maximum aortic velocity may be noted as Vmax or less commonly as AoVmax.|$|E
50|$|Several {{hypotheses}} for {{the association}} were proposed, {{the most prominent}} being {{the idea that there}} is no causal relationship between aortic stenosis and gastrointestinal bleeding, they are both just common conditions in the elderly, and they sometimes overlap. Other hypotheses included hypoxia of the colonic mucosa and bowel ischemia due to low blood flow, both of which were discounted by later research. Another early hypothesis of note was proposed by Greenstein et al. in 1986. They suggested that GI bleeding could be caused by thinning of the wall of the cecum due to abnormal pulse waves in the ileocolic artery (an artery that supplies blood to the cecum) causing dilation of that artery. Specifically, they note that the usual anacrotic and <b>dicrotic</b> <b>notches</b> were absent from the pulse waves of their people with aortic stenosis. There has been no further research investigating this hypothesis, however, as it has been eclipsed by newer research into acquired von Willebrand’s disease.|$|R
40|$|IT HAS been {{appreciated}} {{for many}} years that characteristic alterations in the con-figuration of the central and peripheral arterial pressure pulses occur {{in the presence of}} ab-normalities of the aortic valve, whether they are induced experimentally or occur in pa-tients with aortic valve disease. 1 [...] ~- It is also recognized that the arterial pressure pulse is modified in patients with idiopathic hyper-trophic subaortic stenosis, although the changes that occur in this disease differ strik-ingly from those seen in patients with valvular aortic stenosis. 6 - 8 In the past, the characteriza-tion of arterial pressure pulses in patients with these lesions has consisted of descriptions of the pulse contour, determination of the pres-ence and position of the anacrotic and <b>dicrotic</b> <b>notches,</b> measurement of the duration of sys-tole and of the systolic upstroke time, and esti-mation of the slope of the pressure rise. In patients with severe valvular aortic stenosis, there is often prolongation of the total dura-tion of ejection and of the systolic upstroke time. 9 - 13 Although the latter period is short-ened in patients with idiopathic hypertrophic subaortic stenosis, there is considerable over-lap in these measurements among various groups of patients and normal individuals. 9 In order to derive more diagnostic informa-tion from the pressure pulse, some investigators have calculated the mean rate of arterial pres-sure rise by dividing the pulse pressure by the systolic upstroke time, or have estimated the slope of the pressure rise from the record-ed tracing.

40|$|The {{lower limb}} muscle may play an {{important}} role in decreasing the heart's pumping workload. Aging and inactivity cause atrophy and weakness of the muscle, leading to a loss of the heart-assisting role. An electrical lower limb muscle stimulator can prevent atrophy and weakness more effectively than conventional resistance training; however, it has been reported to increase the heart's pumping workload in some situations. Therefore, more effective tools should be developed. We newly developed a cardiac cycle-synchronized electrical lower limb muscle stimulator by combining a commercially available electrocardiogram monitor and belt electrode skeletal muscle electrical stimulator, making it possible to achieve strong and wide but not painful muscle contractions. Then, we tested the stimulator in 11 healthy volunteers to determine whether the special equipment enabled lower limb muscle training without harming the hemodynamics using plethysmography and a percutaneous cardiac output analyzer. In 9 of 11 subjects, the stimulator generated diastolic augmentation waves on the <b>dicrotic</b> <b>notches</b> and end-diastolic pressure reduction waves on the plethysmogram waveforms of the brachial artery, showing analogous waveforms in the intra-aortic balloon pumping heart-assisting therapy. The heart rate, stroke volume, and cardiac output significantly increased during the stimulation. There was no change in the systolic or diastolic blood pressure during the stimulation. Cardiac cycle-synchronized electrical muscle stimulation for the lower limbs may enable muscle training without harmfully influencing the hemodynamics and with a potential to reduce the heart's pumping workload, suggesting a promising tool for effectively treating both locomotor and cardiovascular disorders...|$|R
40|$|International audienceDivergent {{concepts}} on {{the origin}} of the <b>dicrotic</b> <b>notch</b> are widespread in medical literature and education. Since most medical textbooks explain the origin of the <b>dicrotic</b> <b>notch</b> as caused by the aortic valve closure itself, this is commonly transmitted in medical physiology courses. We present clinical data and numerical simulations to demonstrate that reflected pressure waves could participate as one of the causes of the <b>dicrotic</b> <b>notch.</b> Our experimental data from continuous arterial pressure measurements from adult patients undergoing vascular surgery suggest that isolated changes in peripheral vascular resistance using an intravenous bolus of phenylephrine (a selective alpha 1 -receptor agonist and thus a potent vasoconstrictor) modify the <b>dicrotic</b> <b>notch.</b> We then explore the mechanisms behind this phenomenon by using a numerical model based on integrated axisymmetric Navier-Stokes equations to compute the hemodynamic flow. Our model illustrates clearly how modifications in peripheral artery resistance may result in changes in the amplitude of the <b>dicrotic</b> <b>notch</b> by modifying reflected pressure waves.

A consecutive of 114 patients (73 men and 41 women) was enrolled in this study. Data were shown as means ± SD. Statistical analyses were performed with SPSS software.

40|$|A novel {{algorithm}} {{to detect}} the di- crotic notch in arterial pressure signals is proposed. Its per- formance is evaluated using both aortic and radial artery pressure signals, and its robustness to variations in design parameters is investigated. Methods. Most previously pub- lished <b>dicrotic</b> <b>notch</b> detection algorithms scan the arterial pressure waveform for the characteristic pressure change {{that is associated with}} the <b>dicrotic</b> <b>notch.</b> Aortic valves, however, are closed by the backwards motion of aortic blood volume. We developed an algorithm that uses arterial £ow {{to detect the}} <b>dicrotic</b> <b>notch</b> in arterial pressure waveforms. Arterial £ow is calculated from arterial pressure using simulation results with a three-element windkessel model. Aortic valve closure is detected after the systolic upstroke and at the minimum of the ¢rst negative dip in the calculated £ow signal. Results. In 7 dogs ejection times were derived from a calculated aortic £ow signal and from simultaneously meas- ured aortic £ow probe data. A total of 86 beats was analyzed; the di¡erence in ejection times was ÿ 0. 6 ?? 5. 4 ms (mean ?? SD). The algorithm was further evaluated using 6 second epochs of radial artery pressure data measured in 50 patients. Model simulations were carried out using both a linear wind- kessel model and a pressure and age dependent nonlinear windkessel model. Visual inspection by an experienced clini- cian con¢rmed that the algorithm correctly identi¢ed the <b>dicrotic</b> <b>notch</b> in 98 % (49 of 50) of the patients using the linear model, and 96 % (48 of 50) of the patients using the nonlinear model. The position of the <b>dicrotic</b> <b>notch</b> appeared to be less sensitive to variations in algorithm's design parame- ters when a nonlinear windkessel model was used. Conclu- sions. The detection of the <b>dicrotic</b> <b>notch</b> in arterial pressure signals is facilitated by ¢rst calculating the arterial £ow wave- form from arterial pressure and a model of arterial afterload. The method is robust and reduces the problem of detecting a dubious point in a decreasing pressure signal to the detection of a well-de¢ned minimum in a derived signal...|$|E

30|$|In {{the present}} study {{we have tried to}} take the {{simplest}} approach possible, along the lines of Ottesen’s model, whilst still being able to capture important features of the blood pressure signal. Initially we employed a three compartment model, involving the arteries, veins and left ventricle. However, one of our main goals was to have our model exhibit a <b>dicrotic</b> <b>notch</b> in arterial pressure. The <b>dicrotic</b> <b>notch</b> is the name given to the pressure fluctuation seen when the aortic valve closes. This closure is caused by the pressure drop across the valve becoming negative. The size and location in time of the notch provides important information about the health of the valve and the aorta. For example, in aortic insufficiency, the aortic valve does not completely close so that after each heart beat, the blood that has left the aorta comes back immediately to the left ventricle. This behaviour results in a complete absence of <b>dicrotic</b> <b>notch</b> in the pressure signal [10].|$|E

NTG produced dilatation of all digital vessels, re-flected especially by increases in total digital volume. NTG produced marked changes in the <b>dicrotic</b> <b>notch</b> of the pulse wave, noted also in inflow volume curves but not in outflow volume curves. The <b>dicrotic</b> <b>notch</b> was displaced later on the descending limb of the digital pulse wave and became deeper and more prominent after NTG. It is suggested that NTG produces disproportionate dila-tation of the arterial system, having its greatest effect on arteries near the heart, including the coronaries and great vessels branching off the aorta, and on left intraventricular cavity pressure. This greater regional vasodilatation of vessels near the heart could delay closure of the aortic valve, producing a delayed and prominent <b>dicrotic</b> <b>notch</b> of the pulse wave...|$|E

40|$|Heart {{disease is}} one of the leading causes of death in human beings. A survey shows every year about 900, 000 peoples die due to heart {{diseases}} worldwide. Carotid pulse is a pressure signal recorded over the carotid artery as it passes near the surface of the body at the neck. An abnormal carotid pulse called the dicrotic pulse occurs when patients suffer from sepsis, hypovolemic shock, cardiac tamponade, aortic stenosis. <b>Dicrotic</b> <b>notch</b> usually denotes a very low stroke volume, particularly in patients with dilated cardiomyopathy. Lehner and Rangayyan proposed a methodology to detect this <b>dicrotic</b> <b>notch</b> in the carotid pulse signal. This method used the least-squares estimate of the second derivative because a first-derivative operation would give an almost-constant output for the downward slope. In this paper, a digital system is designed to detect the <b>dicrotic</b> <b>notch</b> in the carotid pulse using Verilog Hardware Description Language. Hardware description languages such as Verilog differ from software programming languages because they include ways of describing the propagation of time and signal dependencies (sensitivity). Verilog modules that conform to a synthesizable coding-style, known as RTL (register transfer level), can be physically realized by synthesis software. Synthesis-software algorithmically transforms the Verilog source code into a netlist, a logically-equivalent description consisting only of elementary logic primitives (AND, OR, NOT, flip-flops, etc.) that are available in a specific FPGA or VLSI technology.

This resource provides a discussion of timing practice and assessment guide-lines and {{a detailed description of the}} impact of physiological and nonphysiological factors on the efficacy of intra-aortic balloon pump (IABP) therapy. Conventional Timing Assessment Timing assessment is the process of determining if the timing settings are correct relative to the cardiac cycle. Conventional timing dictates that all actions of the IABP occur in diastole, so inflation should occur at the <b>dicrotic</b> <b>notch</b> and deflation before the next systolic ejection. To assess timing, set the IABP at 1 : 2 assist to allow comparison of assisted and unassisted beats. Figure 1 shows the assessment points. To assess inflation, draw a line (circled 1 on the figure) from visible <b>dicrotic</b> <b>notch</b> to <b>dicrotic</b> <b>notch.</b> The inflation point or V between systole and aug-mentation should be on or slightly above the line. If the V is too far above the line (more than 3 boxes on the electrocardiographic [ECG] paper), inflation timing is too early. If the <b>dicrotic</b> <b>notch</b> is visible between systole and the augmentation waveform, inflation is too late. In addition, the augmentation pressure should be greater than the systolic pressure. Deflation timing is assessed by identifying the assisted diastole, that is, the diastolic pressure after inflation of the balloon, and comparing it with the unassisted diastole (circled 2 on Figure 1), the native diastolic pressure of the patient. The assisted diastole should be lower than the patient’s diastolic pressure. Finally, draw a line from the systolic pressure to the next systolic pressure (circled 3 on Figure 1). The assisted systole, the pressure after assisted diastole, should be lower than the patient’s native systole. This finding indicates that the decrease in aortic pressure at end diastole reduced systolic pressure work on the next systolic beat. If the assisted systolic pressure is not lower than the native systolic pressure, deflation is too early (Figure 2 A). This situation may occur even when defla-tion produces a decrease in end-diastolic pressure, but if it occurs well before the next systolic ejection, the left ventricle does not benefit from that pressure About the Authors Patricia M.

Considering that the heart rate (HR) of the subjects {{should be the same}} for both methods (because it was measured simultaneously), then the CI should not be different. There are two possible explanations for this fact. First, despite the mean difference between both methods was not statistically significant, the limits of agreement were wide. Positive and negative differences between both methods may be balanced, resulting in a small mean difference. And, second, the MostCare monitor may have missed some waveforms where <b>dicrotic</b> <b>notch</b> has not been detected to perform the calculations of the CI. Whereas the MostCare monitor measures the SVI in a waveform, and then calculates the CI with the rate of the waveforms detected, the PiCCO monitor measures the CI by thermodilution, regardless of the waveform.

The work in this paper is motivated by a recent development which allows the blood pressure {{to be related to}} the output of a pulse oximeter (the photoplethysmograph or pleth) [19]. To maximise the information gained from this signal requires an understanding of the blood pressure curve. The specific goal of this paper is then to produce a mathematical model capable of accurately reproducing the dominant features of the blood pressure curve and in particular the <b>dicrotic</b> <b>notch</b> (a small dip in the blood pressure curve associated with aortic valve closure), and the variation due to respiratory sinus arrhythmia (RSA). Abnormalities with the <b>dicrotic</b> <b>notch</b> may indicate problems with the valve or poor vascular resistance caused, for example, by severe septic shock. To allow for easy interpretation and to minimise the number of parameters, an effort was made to keep the model as simple as possible. In the following section we will describe the compartment approach that was used to model the human cardiovascular system. Subsequent sections deal with model refinements and parameter estimation. Finally we compare our model results with data taken from a radial artery catheter. All catheters were zeroed, calibrated and a flush test performed before taking any measurement [20].|$|E

A problem with either of these requirements can be a source of serious error in the measurement of FFR. In each case we present here, despite a good aortic pressure trace at the start of the procedure, there is dynamic damping of the pressure trace during hyperemia, secondary to axial migration of the guiding catheter into the left main stem (LMS). In both cases, a normal aortic pressure trace (Pa) is present at baseline.

There was no effect on RHDN of the ??-adrenergic blocker phentolamine or the ??-adrenergic blocker propranolol. The cyclo-oxygenase inhibitor indomethacin dose-dependently decreased RHDN but this effect was blocked by l-NAME, suggesting it was mediated by cross-talk with the NO pathway. Changes in RHDN appeared to be independent of heart rate and of the delay between the systolic peak and the notch, but were associated with changes in the slope of the dicrotic limb. Both l-NAME and phentolamine produced multiple diastolic peaks, indicative of wave reflections in the vasculature. These data support the view that changes in RHDN are specific to the NO pathway and provide additional information about the mechanisms involved. ?? 2008 The Authors...|$|E
