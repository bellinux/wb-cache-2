5|$|In July 2015, the Beales are {{informed}} by DI Samantha Keeble (Alison Newman) {{that the police}} have a new DCI dealing {{with the murder of}} Lucy Beale (Hetti Bywater), who is making an arrest. At Phil's house, Marsden knocks on <b>his</b> <b>door</b> <b>and</b> Phil is shocked to see her. Marsden wants to speak to Ben about Lucy's murder, but Phil slams the door in her face and then attempts to delay Marsden so Ben can flee Walford, but Ben is eventually arrested.|$|E
5|$|Yabuhara hires Hanada to kill four men, {{the first}} three being a customs officer, an ocularist and a {{jewellery}} dealer. Hanada snipes the first from behind a billboard's animatronic cigarette lighter, shoots the second from a basement up through a pipe drain when the latter leans over the sink and, ordered to finish quickly, blasts {{his way into the}} third's office and escapes on an advertising balloon. Misako then appears at <b>his</b> <b>door</b> <b>and</b> offers him a nearly impossible contract to kill a foreigner, which he cannot refuse having just been told the plan.|$|E
25|$|Even the Islamic Prophet Muhammad was {{subjected}} to such abuse; while he was praying near the Kaaba, Aqaba Bin Muiitt threw the entrails of a sacrificed camel over him.

25|$|In the Uttara Kanda of Valmiki's Ramayana, Durvasa {{appears at}} Rama's {{doorstep}} and seeing Lakshmana guarding the door, demands {{an audience with}} Rama. At the time, Rama was having a private conversation with Yama(the god of death) disguised as an ascetic. Before the conversation began, Yama gave Rama strict instructions that their dialogue was to remain confidential and anyone who entered the room and saw or heard them was to be executed. Rama agreed and entrusted Lakshman with the duty of guarding <b>his</b> <b>door</b> <b>and</b> fulfilling his promise to Yama. Thus, when Durvasa made his demand, Lakshman politely asked the sage to wait until Rama had finished his meeting. The sage grew angry and threatened to curse all of Ayodhya if Lakshman did not immediately inform Rama of his arrival. Lakshman, in a dilemma, {{decided it would be}} better that he alone die to save all of Ayodhya from falling under Durvasa's curse and so interrupted Rama's meeting to inform him of the sage's arrival. Rama quickly concluded his meeting with Yama and received the sage with due courtesy. Durvasa told Rama of his desire to be fed and Rama fulfilled his guest's request, whereupon the satisfied sage went on his way. Rama was overcome with sorrow, for {{he did not want to}} kill his beloved brother, Lakshman. Still, he had given his word to Yama and could not go back on it. He called his advisers to help him resolve this quandary. On Vasishta's advice, he ordered Lakshman to leave him for good, since such abandonment was equivalent to death as far as the pious were concerned. Lakshman then went to the banks of the Sarayu, resolved on giving up the world through Yoga.|$|E
25|$|At 9:30 pm, Donohoe and Ryan {{entered the}} car park of the Lordship Credit Union {{premises}} and they parked, as did another {{car that was}} accompanying them from another credit union branch. They both parked beside the car belonging to officials from Lordship. At this point a navy-blue coloured Volkswagen Passat - that had been waiting stationary on the hard shoulder of the road - drove across the road and blocked the entrance. Four members of the gang were hiding behind a wall surrounding the car park, all wearing balaclavas, while a fifth was driving the car. Two gang members approached the detectives' car from the rear, and as Donohoe opened <b>his</b> <b>door</b> <b>and</b> stepped out to investigate why the car had blocked the entrance, he was instantly shot at close range {{in the back of}} the head with a long barrelled shotgun by a masked raider. A single shot was fired. It was dark, and before Ryan could realise what was taking place he was held at gunpoint and ordered out of his car and onto the ground by a number of gang members possessing a shotgun, handgun and a hammer. Neither officer had time to draw their weapons. The raiders then broke into a car belonging to credit union staff from Lordship, threatening them, which was carrying cash and cheques to the value of about €40,000, but only took a bag with €4,000, mistakenly leaving behind more than €30,000. Ryan and the credit union staff were left physically uninjured as the gang of five fled the scene, but Ryan was dispossessed of his car keys in an attempt to hinder his reaction. It was only after the perpetrators had escaped that the alarm could be raised.|$|E

500|$|In {{his history}} of Taunton, Joshua Toulmin {{suggested}} that the church adopted Unitarian worship in 1722. This form of worship remained outlawed, as the Act of Toleration did not extend to nontrinitarianism. Unitarianism believed in the [...] "One God and Father of all", rather than the Trinity of God as three consubstantial persons. Writing a series on [...] "Baptists in Taunton" [...] for the Taunton Courier, H. J. Channon disagreed, placing the change in 1733. Both agreed that the zeal with which Jeffries preached helped to swell his congregation, although {{a history of the}} Baptist church in Wellington notes that Jeffries was obstructive regarding a Baptist church being built in that town. Toulmin himself served as the pastor of the chapel from 1764 until 1803, during which time he [...] "experienced unremitted insult and misrepresentation." [...] At one time, an effigy was burned at <b>his</b> <b>door,</b> <b>and</b> it was said that Toulmin could have suffered the same fate, but for assistance from his friends. During Toulmin's ministry, the poet Samuel Taylor Coleridge occasionally preached at the chapel while staying at Coleridge Cottage in Nether Stowey. In a letter, Coleridge wrote, [...] "I walked into Taunton (eleven miles) and back again, and performed the divine services for Dr. Toulmin." [...] The Doctrine of the Trinity Act 1813 legalised Unitarian worship.|$|E

Cotton had a great reputation as an elegant preacher; but this was a plain evangelical sermon, and disappointed his audience. He returned to his rooms, somewhat mortified by his reception, when Preston knocked at <b>his</b> <b>door,</b> <b>and</b> that close religious friendship began which permanently influenced the lives of both. Preston now gave himself to the study of scholastic divinity; Aquinas seems to have been his favourite he thoroughly mastered also Duns Scotus and William of Ockham.|$|E
2500|$|On September 29, 1981, Texas Department of Public Safety Officer David Rucker {{was shot}} and killed along a stretch of highway a few miles north of Brownsville, Texas in the Rio Grande Valley.

Around the same time, Los Fresnos Police Officer Enrique Carrisalez observed a speeding vehicle traveling on the same road away from where Rucker's body had been found. [...] Carrisalez and his partner turned on the patrol car's flashing red lights and pursued the vehicle, which pulled over. Carrisalez took a flashlight and walked toward the car. The driver of the vehicle opened <b>his</b> <b>door</b> <b>and</b> exchanged words with Carrisalez before firing at least one shot at Carrisalez' chest. He died nine days later. Leonel Torres Herrera was arrested a few days later and was charged with the capital murder of both Carrisalez and Rucker.|$|E

By this point, they had run approximately [...] {{from the car}} park. Bryant opened <b>his</b> <b>door</b> <b>and</b> slowed down. Mikac moved towards the car, apparently thinking he was offering them help in escaping. Several more people witnessed this from further down the road.

She did so, saying, [...] "Please don't hurt my babies". Bryant shot her in the temple, killing her. Next, he fired a shot at Madeline, which hit her in the shoulder, then shot her fatally through the chest. Bryant shot twice at Alannah, as she ran behind a tree, missing. He then walked up, pressed the barrel of the gun into her neck and fired, killing her instantly.|$|E

2500|$|Livius Drusus (d.91). His {{father of}} the same name, acting as tribune but {{on behalf of the}} Senate, had {{sponsored}} rival programs and [...] "caused the overthrow of Gaius Gracchus." [...] The son also held [...] "strictly conservative views." [...] "He belonged to the circle of the highest nobility and possessed a colossal fortune; in disposition too he was a genuine aristocrat—a man emphatically proud." [...] Yet he followed [...] "the beautiful saying, that nobility implies obligation." [...] He had in earnest turned away from the [...] "frivolity" [...] common to elite society. [...] "rustworthy and strict in morals, he was respected rather than properly beloved" [...] by the common people, [...] "to whom <b>his</b> <b>door</b> <b>and</b> his purse were always open." [...] Later he became tribune; as political events unfolded Drusus became less an antagonist and more the disciple of the late Gaius Gracchus. He championed reforms to remedy the corruption in the courts caused by equite merchants (who then acted as the judex); to this reform he added the grant of Roman citizenship to Italians. After the apparent victory of these reforms in the senate, followed by their repeal, while yet vigorous he was murdered. Following his death the Social War started throughout Italy over citizenship rights.|$|E
