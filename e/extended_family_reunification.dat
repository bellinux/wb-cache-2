40|$|Transnational {{mothering}} presents significant {{challenges to}} immigrant women.

Thus, this article explores the Strasbourg Court's case-law on transnational parents' access to <b>family</b> <b>reunification</b> with the aim to unveil the actual capability of the Court to support a gender-sensitive enforcement of national and European <b>family</b> <b>reunification</b> regimes as well as transnational mothers' access to <b>family</b> <b>reunification</b> in conditions of equality...|$|R

50|$|<b>Family</b> <b>reunification</b> in the United States is {{the most}} common legal basis for {{immigration}} to the United States, and it is governed by the terms of the Immigration and Nationality Act, as amended. Historically, the emphasis on <b>family</b> <b>reunification</b> in American immigration law began in that 1965 act by allotting 74% of all new immigrants allowed into the United States to <b>family</b> <b>reunification</b> visas. Those included, in descending preference, unmarried adult children of U.S. citizens (20%), spouses and unmarried children of permanent resident aliens (20%), married children of U.S. citizens (10%), and brothers and sisters of U.S. citizens over age 21 (24%).|$|R
40|$|In Luxembourg, <b>family</b> <b>reunification</b> {{is one of}} {{the main}} reasons for {{immigration}} of third-country nationals. In fact, “family member” and “private reasons (family links) ” residence permits (first deliveries and renewals) represented more than a third of all residence permits issued during the last three years. While the right to <b>family</b> <b>reunification</b> was solely provided by international law and regulated by administrative practice until 2008, the transposition of Directive 2003 / 86 /EC of 22 September 2003 on the right to <b>family</b> <b>reunification</b> led to a much more precise and detailed legal framework. A notable change in legislation has been proposed with the introduction of bill n° 6992, namely the harmonisation of the conditions that apply to third-country national employees with those of Blue Card holders and researchers. Thus, <b>family</b> <b>reunification</b> requirements for certain categories of applicants shall be alleviated through the abrogation of the 12 -month residence requirement for the sponsor. In order to apply for <b>family</b> <b>reunification</b> in Luxembourg, sponsors have to meet a number of requirements for exercising the right to <b>family</b> <b>reunification,</b> which include the provision of suitable accommodation for the size of their family; meeting health and safety standards; health insurance; as well as stable and regular resources to provide for themselves and their family members. As recommended by Directive 2003 / 86 /EC, Luxembourg sets out more favourable conditions to beneficiaries of international protection for the exercise of their right to <b>family</b> <b>reunification.</b> Thus, they do not have to comply with the above-mentioned requirements in case they apply for <b>family</b> <b>reunification</b> within 3 months of being granted the status. Family members who have come to Luxembourg under <b>family</b> <b>reunification</b> have access to education, orientation, vocational training, lifelong learning and professional retraining once their residence permit has been issued. Family members furthermore have access to the labour market. In case the family member has resided in Luxembourg for less than one year when the application is submitted, it will be submitted to the labour market test. Family members can also, under a number of conditions, benefit from guaranteed minimum income, social aid, long-term residence status as well as citizenship. National stakeholders noted that the requirement of finding appropriate accommodation and proving stable and regular resources {{is one of the}} main challenges for sponsors. For family members as well as sponsors, having sufficient financial resources to cover the costs of <b>family</b> <b>reunification</b> can be another challenge to accessing <b>family</b> <b>reunification.</b> <b>Family</b> members of beneficiaries of international protection in particular face the more procedural challenge of providing proof of identity and family links, which can be difficult due to lacking documentation, differing administrative practices in the country of origin and/or the lack of cooperation of institutions. Gaining access to <b>family</b> <b>reunification</b> is also particularly difficult for beneficiaries of international protection who arrived in Luxembourg as unaccompanied minors but reached adulthood during the examination of their file, as they must provide proof of their family member’s dependency upon them. The limited number of diplomatic representations of Luxembourg abroad poses a challenge both to family members who must present themselves there, as well as for the Luxembourgish authorities who require information on certain countries. Perceived as a best practice with regard to <b>family</b> <b>reunification</b> are the information that NGOs and the lawyers in the field of migration and asylum provide to beneficiaries of international protection with regard to procedures of <b>family</b> <b>reunification,</b> thereby contributing to the beneficiary’s ability to enter an application for <b>family</b> <b>reunification</b> within the 3 -month period. The practice of accepting the submission of an application of family members of beneficiaries of international protection that contains only a commencement of proof of family links and allowing for the finalisation at a later date is also perceived as a good practice, as it enables them to exercise their right to <b>family</b> <b>reunification</b> while benefitting from more favourable conditions. Furthermore, the issuance of a “laisser-passer” for beneficiaries of international protection who cannot obtain travel documents is perceived as a big step forward by national stakeholders. Lastly, Restoring Family Links, a service provided by the Luxembourgish Red Cross, is also considered a reliable tool with regard to tracing missing family members abroad...|$|R

40|$|<b>Family</b> <b>reunification</b> was {{virtually}} {{the only way}} for non-EC-foreigners to immigrate to Germany after the recruitment stop [...] in 1973. However, empirical knowledge on the relative size, the reasons and the accompanying circumstances of <b>family</b> <b>reunification</b> is limited. In the paper, the <b>reunification</b> of foreign <b>families</b> whose head lives in Germany is considered using data from the German Socio-Economic Panel 1984 - 1989. <b>Family</b> <b>reunification</b> is identified in two different ways. Whereas the retrospective approach looks backward from 1985 using information about the year of migration, the year of marriage, and the position in the household, the approach on a year-to-year base uses the panel design of the SOEP identifying <b>family</b> <b>reunification</b> by the reason of movement into the household and out of the household, respectively. The relative size of <b>family</b> <b>reunification</b> in proportion to total immigration as well as the linkage to the business cycle fluctuations is determined. <b>Family</b> <b>reunification</b> is analyzed within the framework of a discrete hazard rate model. The relative importance of several factors reflecting the economic and social situation of the family's head on the decision to have spouse and children come to Germany is examined. It turns out that besides nation-specific differences, years since migration, years since marriage, the degree of social integration in Germany, income and unemployment status by the individual and in the economy, as well as the family background are important determinants for the decision to reunite the family. ...|$|R

40|$|This thesis touches {{upon the}} subject of <b>family</b> <b>reunification,</b> being highly problematised and politicised {{in the context of}} the EU member states.

5000|$|The U.S {{immigration}} system determines who {{enters the}} country, and how many, either by order or under certain circumstances.

40|$|Refugee {{situations}} inevitably lead to {{the separation}} of families fleeing {{a country in which}} they are no longer safe. Thus, it may seem surprising that the main instruments of international refugee law make minimal mention of the family as a subject of protection. This Comment is intended to show that regardless of the absence of direct family rights protections for refugees in the Convention on the Status of Refugees, various other international instruments in combination, as interpreted by the European Court of Human Rights in particular, have established a right of <b>family</b> <b>reunification</b> for refugees. The European Court of Human Rights has developed a balancing test, weighing the state 2 ̆ 7 s right to control its borders against the family 2 ̆ 7 s interest in family unity, to determine whether <b>family</b> <b>reunification</b> is required by Article 8 of the European Convention on Human Rights. The refugee fulfills this balancing test, given the necessary implications of refugee status under the Convention Relating to the Status of Refugees and the factors upon which the European Court of Human Rights has put weight in <b>family</b> <b>reunification</b> cases. The substantial similarity between Article 8 of the European Convention on Human Rights and family unity provisions in other human rights instruments of more general application provides reason to find the European Court of Human Rights is persuasive in shaping the right to <b>family</b> <b>reunification</b> generally. By relying on the jurisprudence of the European Court of Human Rights rather than more narrowly tailored <b>family</b> <b>reunification</b> provisions found in human rights instruments, this Comment will show that the right to <b>family</b> <b>reunification</b> <b>extends</b> to all refugee families...|$|R
40|$|The {{concept of}} <b>family</b> <b>reunification</b> is well {{established}} in contemporary migration laws, at both the national and international levels. Focusing on international and EU law, in this article I argue that while existing provisions on <b>family</b> <b>reunification</b> are formulated in neutral language, from the gender point of view the enforcement of these substantively neutral rules may, in certain situations, result in discrimination, or at least bring about negative consequences, with respect to women in cases both when they are the sponsors of migration or the bearers of consequences of male migration. Following presentation of the international legal framework on <b>family</b> <b>reunification</b> and the relevant international jurisprudence, I deal with some rather common aspects relating to the personal scope of <b>family</b> <b>reunification</b> regulations, covering only the issues of who can, and who cannot, join their family member(s) /sponsor(s) {{in a foreign country}} (i. e. the unmarried minor rule, excluded forms of marriages - polygamous and forced marriages - and age limits). Some procedural aspects of <b>family</b> <b>reunification</b> are then dealt with (waiting periods, delays in proceedings, and end of a relationship as a cause for termination of residence rights.).
