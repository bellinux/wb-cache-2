5|$|It is now {{agreed that}} spiders (Araneae) are {{monophyletic}} (i.e., {{members of a}} group of organisms that form a clade, consisting of a last common ancestor and all of its descendants). There has been debate about what their closest evolutionary relatives are, and <b>how</b> <b>all</b> <b>of</b> these evolved from the ancestral chelicerates, which were marine animals. The cladogram on the right is based on J. W. Shultz' analysis (2007). Other views include proposals that: scorpions are more closely related to the extinct marine scorpion-like eurypterids than to spiders; spiders and Amblypygi are a monophyletic group. The appearance of several multi-way branchings in the tree on the right shows that there are still uncertainties about relationships between the groups involved.|$|E

25|$|The 'Man on the throne' in {{the vision}} of Ezekiel descriptively {{represents}} God, who is controlling everything {{that goes on in}} the world, and <b>how</b> <b>all</b> <b>of</b> the archetypes He set up should interact. The 'Man on the throne', however, drives when the four angels connect their wings. This means that God will not be revealed to us by us looking at all four elements (for instance) as separate and independent entities. However, when one looks at the way that earth, wind, fire and water (for instance) which all oppose each other are able to work together and coexist in complete harmony in the world, this shows that there is really a higher power (God) telling these elements how to act.|$|E
25|$|The {{texts in}} the Version A and Cotton Otho B.xi are {{sufficiently}} similar {{to show that}} ultimately they do derive from one source. The historian David Hill shows <b>how</b> <b>all</b> <b>of</b> the recensions {{can be used to}} correct each other or at least help us understand how errors, especially in the hidage numbers, were mistranscribed in the copying process. Hill argues that these errors are not conflicts of facts or derive from differing lists, but simply errors in copying from a common source; it is possible to see that this was because lines of the text were being missed. However, as noted above, the ‘B’ recensions do not list Burpham, Wareham and Bridport, it is likely that their common archetype must have missed them also. Yet it too must have contained the ‘grand total’ sentence at the end which is flatly contradicted by the hidages enumerated.|$|E

Blackwood flees Parliament and sees Adler and Holmes in the sewers, and pursues them {{to the top of}} the incomplete Tower Bridge.

2500|$|Another {{effect the}} {{opposition}} to the war had was that the American soldiers in Vietnam began to side with the opposition and feel remorse for what they were doing. Zinn argues this with an example in which the soldiers in a POW camp formed a peace committee as they wondered who the enemy of the war was, because it certainly was not known among them. The statement of one of the soldiers reads, [...] "Until we got to the first camp, we didn't see a village intact; they were all destroyed. I sat down and put myself in the middle and asked myself: Is this right or wrong? Is it right to destroy villages? Is it right to kill people en masse? After a while it just got to me." [...] Howard Zinn provides that piece of evidence to reiterate <b>how</b> <b>all</b> <b>of</b> this destruction and fighting against an enemy that seems to be unknown has been taking a toll on the soldiers and that they began to sense a feeling of opposition as one effect of the opposition occurring in the United States.|$|E

[...] Leskov's religious essays of the early 1880s continued the same line of sympathetically supporting poor clergymen and ridiculing the hypocrisy of the Russian Orthodoxy's higher ranks. In [...] "Count Tolstoy and F. M. Dostoyevsky as Heresiarchs" [...] and [...] "The Golden Age", both 1883) he defended both from the criticism of Konstantin Leontiev. Leskov never became a Tolstoyan, but his later works were impregnated with the idea of [...] "new Christianity" [...] which he himself identified with Leo Tolstoy, whom he became close with in the mid-1880s and was inevitably influenced by.

2500|$|In his book, Galileo Courtier: The Practice of Science in the Culture of Absolutism, Mario Biagioli {{looks to}} shed light on the ways in which a society {{characterized}} by patronage relationships affected one of astronomy’s, and modern science’s, greatest heroes: Galileo Galilei. Biagioli looks to uncover aspects of Galileo’s life by “vividly [...] the pioneer physicist to us through the active social relations he experienced with persons in the different courts with which he was connected.” [...] The book reveals how Galileo “used patronage to obtain his teaching position in Pisa… [...] maneuvered his transfer from Padua to the “home court” of the Medicis… used contacts with Prince Cesi and other well-placed persons in Roman circles to become an Academian, and a person of influence, and <b>how</b> <b>all</b> <b>of</b> this turned to dust for Galileo, when he lost the patronage of Urban VIII, one of his two most special patrons”. In a review of Biagioli’s work, Larry Wolff noted Biagioli as demonstrating Galileo’s legitimacy as a direct consequence of “his ‘career strategies’” and not just “his ‘cognitive attitudes’” and that Galileo is shown to be a master of attaining power and a seventeenth-century career in science [...] The book acknowledges that “gifts within the logic of patronage [...] the role of spectacular scientific production in Galileo’s career… [...] needed to produce or discover things that could be used as gifts for his patrons” [...] Jardine adds, as Biagioli has shown, Galileo’s gift to Cosimo II of his discovery of the satellites of Jupiter, transformed into emblems of Medici dynastic power, was a spectacularly successful instance. Through exchange of gifts, highly ritualized and often highly competitive, princes and nobles achieved social distinction, maintaining their honour and mutual recognition.|$|E
