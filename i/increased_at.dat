5|$|A church {{building}} had existed {{on the site}} since 1280. During this time, a small chapel stood on the site to serve the local townships of Oldham, Chadderton, Royton and Crompton. This was later replaced by an Early English Gothic church in the 15th century. With {{the coming of the}} Industrial Revolution, the population of Oldham <b>increased</b> <b>at</b> a rapid rate (from under 2,000 in 1714, to over 32,000 by 1831). The rapid growth of the local population warranted that the building be rebuilt into the current structure. Though the budget was originally agreed at £5,000, the final cost of building was £30,000, one third of which was spent on the crypt structure. Alternative designs by Sir Charles Barry, the designer of the Palace of Westminster, although now regarded by some as superior, were rejected. The Church, of the Anglican denomination, is in active use for worship, and forms part of the Diocese of Manchester. There are Roman Catholic churches in Oldham. These include Our Lady of Mount Carmel and St Patrick Church. It was built in 1870, was founded by priests from St Mary's Church in Oldham, and is a Grade II listed building.|$|E

5|$|Academic {{research}} <b>increased</b> <b>at</b> {{the turn}} of the 20th century, and as the Ministry of Works took control of the sites, government spending on these investigations began. Historians such as Sidney Toy and Charles Peers published work on the sites, and research continued under Arnold Taylor, who joined the Office of Works as an assistant inspector in 1935. Major academic reports were published in the 1950s, adding to the sites' reputation. Taylor was also instrumental in the successful opposition to road projects proposed in the 1970s which would have had a substantial impact on the appearance of the Conwy site. In the late 20th century, detailed reconstructions of the castles were painted by historical artists including Terry Ball, John Banbury and Ivan Lapper.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. Rational {{evaluation}} for stress {{increase of}} unbonded tendon at ultimate {{is the basis}} to exactly compute flexural load bearing capacity of unbonded prestressed concrete beams. Moment-curvature nonlinear analysis method is adopted to compile programs for calculating stress <b>increase</b> <b>at</b> ultimate in unbonded prestressed continuous beams. The precision of the method is proved by comparing results of 16 experimental two-span unbonded prestressed continuous beams to the prediction value of stress <b>increase</b> <b>at</b> ultimate. Based on the simulation analysis, law {{of the influence of}} some basic factors to stress <b>increase</b> <b>at</b> ultimate in unbonded tendons in continuous beams is obtained, such as non-prestressed reinforcement index, prestressed reinforcement index, ratio of span to depth and loading type.

5|$|In {{starting}} a motor, a VFD initially applies a low frequency and voltage, thus avoiding high inrush current associated with direct-on-line starting. After {{the start of}} the VFD, the applied frequency and voltage are <b>increased</b> <b>at</b> a controlled rate or ramped up to accelerate the load. This starting method typically allows a motor to develop 150% of its rated torque while the VFD is drawing less than 50% of its rated current from the mains in the low-speed range. A VFD can be adjusted to produce a steady 150% starting torque from standstill right up to full speed. However, motor cooling deteriorates and can result in overheating as speed decreases such that prolonged low-speed operation with significant torque is not usually possible without separately motorized fan ventilation.|$|E

5|$|Sesame Street {{has been}} used to test the {{attention}} span of infants and toddlers.

Their attention spans, as determined by the duration of time they looked at the stimuli, significantly <b>increased</b> <b>at</b> six to twenty-four months, but only for the Sesame Street material. A study conducted in 2006 found that infants' attention span increased more when they were presented with video clips than with still images of the same stimuli, supporting the idea that movement helps young infants gain more information from the world around them. The evidence showed that attention span depended both on age and the on the type of stimuli children viewed. The time they looked at stimuli decreased for all types of stimuli from fourteen to twenty-six weeks, but the time they looked at it increased depending on the stimuli. When older infants (age fourteen weeks to twelve months) looked at Sesame Street materials and human faces, their attention increased compared to other types of stimuli.|$|E

5|$|There are {{two basic}} {{aerodynamic}} models of insect flight. Most insects use a method that creates a spiralling leading edge vortex. Some very small insects use the fling and clap or Weis-Fogh mechanism in which the wings clap together above the insect's body and then fling apart. As they fling open, the air gets sucked in and creates a vortex over each wing. This bound vortex then moves across the wing and, in the clap, acts as the starting vortex for the other wing. Circulation and lift are <b>increased,</b> <b>at</b> the price of {{wear and tear on}} the wings.|$|E

40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{assess the}} time course of adaptations in leg {{vascular}} dimension and function {{within the first}} 6 weeks after a spinal cord injury (SCI). DESIGN: Longitudinal study design. SETTING: University medical center and rehabilitation clinic. PARTICIPANTS: Six men were studied serially at 1, 2, 3, 4, and 6 weeks after SCI. INTERVENTIONS: Not applicable. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Diameter, blood flow, and shear rate levels of the common femoral artery (CFA), superficial femoral artery (SFA), brachial artery, and carotid artery were measured with echo Doppler ultrasound (diameter, blood flow, shear rate). Endothelial function in the SFA was measured with flow-mediated dilation (FMD). In addition, leg volume and blood pressure measurements were performed. RESULTS: Femoral artery diameter (CFA, 25 %; SFA, 16 %; P<. 01) and leg volume (22 %, P<. 01) decreased simultaneously, and these reductions were largely accomplished within 3 weeks postinjury. Significant increases were observed for basal shear rate levels (64 % <b>increase</b> <b>at</b> week 3; 117 % <b>increase</b> <b>at</b> week 6; P<. 01), absolute FMD responses (8 % <b>increase</b> <b>at</b> week 3, 23 % <b>increase</b> <b>at</b> week 6; P<. 05) and relative FMD responses (26 % <b>increase</b> <b>at</b> week 3, 44 % <b>increase</b> <b>at</b> week 6; P<. 001). CONCLUSIONS: Our findings show a rapid onset of adaptations in arterial dimension and function to extreme inactivity in humans. Vascular adaptations include extensive reductions in femoral diameter and leg volume, as well as increased basal shear rate levels and FMD responses, which all appear to be largely accomplished within 3 weeks after an SCI...|$|R
