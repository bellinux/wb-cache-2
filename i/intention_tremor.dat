5|$|Dysarthria is {{the most}} common {{communication}} problem in individuals with multiple sclerosis (MS), however, significant difficulties with speech and intelligibility are uncommon. Individuals with MS vary widely in their motor control capacity and the presence of <b>intention</b> <b>tremor,</b> and methods of access to AAC technology are adapted accordingly. Visual impairments are common in MS and may necessitate approaches using auditory scanning systems, large-print text, or synthetic speech feedback that plays back words and letters as they are typed.|$|E
25|$|Different {{medications}} {{have been}} used to temporarily treat ataxic cerebral palsy. Medications like primidone and benzodiazepine, while not recommended for long term use, can alleviate some of the tremor symptoms. Botox which relaxes tightened muscles has been effective in treating voice, hand and head tremors. A few recently published papers outlined a potential method for treating <b>intention</b> <b>tremor</b> which consisted of cooling the forearm by wrapping it in a cryomanchet using a circulating fluid. After the treatment most patients experienced reduced tremor for up to half an hour. This practical, however short-term treatment can facilitate performing normal daily activities like applying make up, eating, or signing documents. This potential treatment method is also significant in that it reduces one’s reliance on caregivers.|$|E
25|$|Symptoms of {{cerebellar}} abiotrophy include ataxia {{or lack of}} balance, {{an awkward}} wide-legged stance, a head tremor (<b>intention</b> <b>tremor)</b> (in dogs, body tremors also occur), hyperreactivity, lack of menace reflex, stiff or high-stepping gait, coarse or jerky head bob when in motion (or in very young animals, when attempting to nurse), apparent lack of awareness of where the feet are (sometimes standing or trying to walk with a foot knuckled over), poor depth perception, and a general inability to determine space and distance. The symptoms, when taken as a group, are distinctive and not easily mimicked by other illnesses, though certain types of neurological injury and infection need to be ruled out. Verifying the diagnosis in a laboratory setting is possible only by examining the brain post-mortem {{to determine if there}} has been a loss of Purkinje cells.|$|E
50|$|A {{more radical}} {{treatment}} {{that is used}} in individuals who {{do not respond to}} drug therapy, physical therapy, or any other treatment listed above, with moderate to severe <b>intention</b> <b>tremors,</b> is surgical intervention. Deep brain stimulation and surgical lesioning of the thalamic nuclei {{has been found to be}} an effective long-term treatment with <b>intention</b> <b>tremors.</b>|$|R
50|$|More {{persistent}} <b>intention</b> <b>tremors</b> {{are often}} caused by damage to certain {{regions of the}} brain. The {{most common cause of}} <b>intention</b> <b>tremors</b> is damage and/or degeneration in the cerebellum. The cerebellum {{is a part of the}} brain responsible for motor coordination, posture and balance. It is responsible for fine motor movements. When the cerebellum is damaged, a person may have difficulty executing a fine motor movement, such as attempting to touch one's nose with one's finger. One common way for the cerebellum to become damaged is through the development of cerebellar lesions. The most common site for cerebellar lesions that lead to <b>intention</b> <b>tremors</b> has been reported to be the superior cerebellar peduncle, through which all fibers carrying information to the midbrain pass, and the dentate nucleus, which is also responsible for linking the cerebellum to the rest of the brain. Alcohol abuse is one typical cause of this damage to the cerebellum. The alcohol abuse causes degeneration of the anterior vermis of the cerebellum. This leads to an inability to process fine motor movements in the individual and the development of <b>intention</b> <b>tremors.</b> In Multiple Sclerosis, damage occurs due to demyelination and neuron death, which again produces cerebellar lesions and an inability for those neurons to transmit signals. Because of this tight association with damage to the cerebellum, <b>intention</b> <b>tremors</b> are often referred to as cerebellar tremors.|$|R
50|$|<b>Intention</b> <b>tremors</b> {{can be a}} {{first sign}} of {{multiple}} sclerosis, since loss or deterioration of motor function and sensitivity are often {{one of the first}} symptoms of cerebellar lesions.|$|R
500|$|The {{first attempt}} to {{establish}} a set of diagnostic criteria was also due to Charcot in 1868. He published what now {{is known as the}} [...] "Charcot Triad", consisting in nystagmus, <b>intention</b> <b>tremor,</b> and telegraphic speech (scanning speech) Charcot also observed cognition changes, describing his patients as having a [...] "marked enfeeblement of the memory" [...] and [...] "conceptions that formed slowly".|$|E
500|$|Damage to the {{cerebellum}} often causes motor-related symptoms, {{the details}} of which depend {{on the part of}} the cerebellum involved and how it is damaged. Damage to the [...] flocculonodular lobe may show up as a loss of equilibrium and in particular an altered, irregular walking gait, with a wide stance caused by difficulty in balancing. Damage to the lateral zone typically causes problems in skilled voluntary and planned movements which can cause errors in the force, direction, speed and amplitude of movements. Other manifestations include hypotonia (decreased muscle tone), dysarthria (problems with speech articulation), dysmetria (problems judging distances or ranges of movement), dysdiadochokinesia (inability to perform rapid alternating movements such as walking), impaired check reflex or rebound phenomenon, and <b>intention</b> <b>tremor</b> (involuntary movement caused by alternating contractions of opposing muscle groups). Damage to the midline portion may disrupt whole-body movements, whereas damage localized more laterally is more likely to disrupt fine movements of the hands or limbs. Damage to the upper part of the cerebellum tends to cause gait impairments and other problems with leg coordination; damage to the lower part is more likely to cause uncoordinated or poorly aimed movements of the arms and hands, as well as difficulties in speed. This complex of motor symptoms is called ataxia.|$|E
2500|$|Cerebellar tremor (also {{known as}} <b>intention</b> <b>tremor)</b> is a slow, broad tremor of the {{extremities}} that {{occurs at the}} end of a purposeful movement, such as trying to press a button or touching a finger to the tip of one’s nose. Cerebellar tremor is caused by lesions in or damage to the cerebellum resulting from stroke, tumor, or disease such as multiple sclerosis or some inherited degenerative disorder. [...] It can also result from chronic alcoholism or overuse of some medicines. In classic cerebellar tremor, a lesion on one side of the brain produces a tremor in that same side of the body that worsens with directed movement. Cerebellar damage can also produce a “wing-beating” type of tremor called rubral or Holmes’ tremor— a combination of rest, action, and postural tremors. The tremor is often most prominent when the affected person is active or is maintaining a particular posture. Cerebellar tremor may be accompanied by other manifestations of ataxia, including dysarthria (speech problems), nystagmus (rapid, involuntary rolling of the eyes), gait problems and postural tremor of the trunk and neck. [...] Titubation is tremor of the head and is of cerebellar origin.|$|E
50|$|<b>Intention</b> <b>tremors</b> have {{a variety}} of other {{recorded}} causes as well. These include a variety of neurological disorders, such as stroke, alcoholism, alcohol withdrawal, peripheral neuropathy, Wilson's disease, Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease, Guillain-Barré syndrome and fragile X syndrome, as well as brain tumors, low blood sugar, hyperthyroidism, hypoparathyroidism, insulinoma, normal aging, and traumatic brain injury. Holmes tremor, a rubral or midbrain tremor, is another form of <b>tremor</b> that includes <b>intention</b> <b>tremors,</b> among other symptoms. This disease affects the proximal muscles of the head, shoulders, and neck. Tremors of this disease occur at frequencies of 2-4 Hz or more.|$|R
50|$|Despite histologic {{changes in}} the cerebellum, horses with shivers do not show {{clinical}} signs typical of cerebellar disease (ataxia, <b>intention</b> <b>tremors).</b> There are usually no changes on serum biochemistry profile, including measurements of muscle enzymes (CK and AST).|$|R
50|$|<b>Intention</b> <b>tremors</b> {{are common}} among {{individuals}} with multiple sclerosis (MS). One common symptom of multiple sclerosis is ataxia, {{a lack of}} coordinated muscle movement caused by cerebellar lesions characteristic of multiple sclerosis. The disease often destroys physical and cognitive function of individuals.|$|R
5000|$|<b>Intention</b> <b>tremor,</b> {{also known}} as {{cerebellar}} tremor, is a dyskinetic disorder characterized by a broad, coarse, and low frequency (below 5 Hz) tremor. The amplitude of an <b>intention</b> <b>tremor</b> increases as an extremity approaches the endpoint of deliberate and visually guided movement (hence the name <b>intention</b> <b>tremor).</b> An <b>intention</b> <b>tremor</b> is usually perpendicular to the direction of movement. When experiencing an <b>intention</b> <b>tremor,</b> one often overshoots or undershoots their target, a condition known as dysmetria. [...] <b>Intention</b> <b>tremor</b> {{is the result of}} dysfunction of the cerebellum, particularly on the same side as the tremor in the lateral zone, which controls visually guided movements. Depending on the location of cerebellar damage, these tremors can be either unilateral or bilateral.|$|E
50|$|<b>Intention</b> <b>tremor</b> is {{also known}} to be {{associated}} with infections, West Nile virus, rubella, H. influenza, rabies, and varicella. A variety of poisons have been shown to cause <b>intention</b> <b>tremor,</b> including mercury, methyl bromide, and phosphine. In addition, vitamin deficiencies have been linked to <b>intention</b> <b>tremor,</b> especially deficiency in vitamin E. Pharmacological agents such as anti-arrhythmic drugs, anti-epileptic agents, benzodiazepine, cyclosporine, lithium, neuroleptics, and stimulants have been known to cause <b>intention</b> <b>tremor.</b> Some ordinary activities including ingesting too much caffeine, cigarettes, and alcohol, along with stress, anxiety, fear, anger and fatiguehave also been shown to cause <b>intention</b> <b>tremor</b> by negatively affecting the cerebellum, brainstem, or thalamus, as discussed in mechanisms.|$|E

50|$|Secondary {{symptoms}} commonly observed are dysarthria (a {{speech disorder}} characterized by poor articulation and slurred speech), nystagmus (rapid involuntary eye movement, especially rolling of the eyes), gait problems (abnormality in walking), and postural tremor or titubation (to-and-fro {{movements of the}} neck and trunk). A postural tremor may also accompany <b>intention</b> <b>tremors.</b>|$|R
50|$|<b>Intention</b> <b>tremors</b> {{that are}} caused by normal, {{everyday}} activities, such as stress, anxiety, fear, anger, caffeine, and fatigue {{do not seem to}} result from damage to any part of the brain. These tremors instead seem to be a temporary worsening of a small tremor that is present in every human being. These tremors generally go away with time.|$|R
5000|$|Holmes tremor is {{typically}} {{characterized by a}} low frequency tremor (below 4.5 Hz) that has a repeated series of rest and <b>intention</b> <b>tremors.</b> These tremors move slowly and are generally specific to an upper area of the body. They can consist of postural tremors in nearby muscles as well. These tremors involve uncontrollable shaking despite efforts to be still. [...] Holmes tremor is considered a rest-intention posture tremor. These irregular movements occur while muscles are at rest, but worsen during voluntary muscle contractions. Symptoms usually appear delayed one to twenty-four months after the lesion is created.|$|R
50|$|In 1868, French {{neurologist}} Jean-Martin Charcot first {{characterized the}} distinction between multiple sclerosis (MS), with its resulting <b>intention</b> <b>tremor,</b> and the resting tremor characteristic of Parkinson's disease. <b>Intention</b> <b>tremor</b> became known as part of Charcot's triad which, along with nystagmus and scanning speech, act as strong indications of MS.|$|E

50|$|Delusions, {{common as}} the illness progresses, {{tend to be}} poorly systematized and absurd. They can be grandiose, melancholic, or paranoid. These {{delusions}} include ideas of great wealth, immortality, thousands of lovers, unfathomable power, apocalypsis, nihilism, self-blame, or bizarre hypochondriacal complaints. Later, the patient suffers from dysarthria, <b>intention</b> <b>tremors,</b> hyperreflexia, myoclonic jerks, confusion, seizures and severe muscular deterioration. Eventually, the paretic dies bedridden, cachectic and completely disoriented, frequently {{in a state of}} status epilepticus.|$|R
50|$|<b>Intention</b> <b>tremors</b> {{can also}} be caused {{as a result of}} damage to the {{brainstem}} or thalamus. Both of these structures are involved in the transmission of information between the cerebellum and the cerebral cortex, as well as between the cerebellum and the spinal cord, and then on to the motor neurons. When these become damaged, the relay system between the cerebellum and the muscle which it is trying to act upon is compromised, resulting {{in the development of a}} tremor.|$|R
25|$|The condition, whether {{resulting}} from cerebellar malformation or injury, results in incomplete cerebral development and no {{two people are}} affected in the same way. In general, cerebral palsy is a physical impairment that affects posture {{and the development of}} movement. Ataxic cerebral palsy in particular, is manifested in the performance of movements with abnormal force, rhythm, and accuracy. Patients have hypotonia (decreased muscle tone), signs of ataxia (loss of full control of bodily movement), impaired balance and coordination, <b>intention</b> <b>tremors,</b> and a wide-based gait (in walking patients).|$|R
50|$|A working {{diagnosis}} {{is made from}} a neurological examination and evaluation. Parts of a complete examination include a physical examination, MRI, patient history, and electrophysiological and accelerometric studies. A diagnosis of solely <b>intention</b> <b>tremor</b> can only be made if the tremor is of low frequency (below 5 Hz) and without the presence of any resting tremors. Electrophysiological studies {{can be useful in}} determining frequency of the tremor, and accelerometric studies quantify tremor amplitude. MRI is used to locate damage to and degradation of the cerebellum that may be causing the <b>intention</b> <b>tremor.</b> Focal lesions such as neoplasms, tumors, hemorrhages, demyelination, or other damage may be causing dysfunction of the cerebellum and correspondingly the <b>intention</b> <b>tremor.</b>|$|E
