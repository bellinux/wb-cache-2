This authority {{is responsible for the}} ecological management of a much larger region that includes eight protected areas in Greece, also part of the Natura 2000, an initiative by the governments of the European Union that aims to protect the most seriously threatened habitats and species across Europe. The 'Northern Pindus Management Body', together with the local forest service, is responsible for regulating human activities and maintaining the <b>ecological</b> <b>value</b> of the protected area. However,until now this target remains elusive, {{because of a lack of}} expertise and of a science-based management plan. A great need therefore exists to conduct conservation-oriented research that can be translated directly into practical management proposals.|$|E
5|$|González-Gordon was {{involved}} with conservationism from an early age; {{he was also an}} avid bird watcher and would become an ornithologist. His family estate was located in the Coto Doñana, a wetland {{at the mouth of the}} river Guadalquivir, near Jerez de la Frontera, in southern Spain. Here González-Gordon became interested in the local ecosystem and invited European ornithologists to visit the area. When two Spanish ornithologists, Professor Francisco Bernis and José Antonio Valverde visited, González-Gordon served as their guide. The González-Gordon family saw that the wetlands were threatened by the planting of eucalyptus trees and large-scale drainage plans proposed by the government. Mauricio, together with his father, asked Bernis to try and influence Spanish dictator Francisco Franco into abandoning these proposals. The trio wrote a memorandum which was presented to Franco himself by Mauricio's father Manuel. By November 1953, Bernis had finished a report on the value of the Doñana, which showed that the area had exceptional <b>ecological</b> <b>value.</b> The group sought international support for their goals and found it. The efforts of González-Gordon to dissuade Franco exposed him to some danger, but the Franco government conceded and the drainage plans were aborted.|$|E

25|$|During the 1970s the Forestry Commission {{had begun}} {{a shift in}} focus to {{conservation}} and amenity value of their woods. The 1975 symposium considered the history and ecology of Bedford Purlieus and discussed how to retain and enhance {{the elements of the}} woods of greatest <b>ecological</b> <b>value.</b> The resulting publication, edited by G.F. Peterken and R.C. Welch, produced a detailed management plan. Among its recommendations were the restoration of areas of coppicing, and the reduction of conifers. The plan provided a basis for an ecological management of Bedford Purlieus within commercial constraints. Its designation as a national nature reserve in 2000 is a recognition {{of the extent to which}} the policy shift had been made. In 2005 it received an injection of funding from landfill tax credits arising from the nearby Augean landfill. This has facilitated the Forestry Commission to re-instate areas of coppicing, open up grassland glades and remove conifers and other introduced species.|$|E

40|$|The {{ecological}} disruption to aquatic and riparian dependent species caused by stream crossings has received considerable attention and public funding. Much of this attention and funding {{has been directed}} towards opportunistic and site-specific remediation. Often, these efforts have not taken into consideration the prioritization of sites based on <b>ecological</b> and infrastructure <b>values.</b> Here, we describe and present results from two prioritization schemes for 245 fish passage barriers at converted stream crossings on the Arapaho-Roosevelt National Forests in Colorado. The first is based on <b>ecological</b> <b>values</b> such as habitat quantity and quality, barrier severity, adjacent stream fragmentation, and watershed health. The second scheme is a combined ecological-infrastructure based approach that is based not only on <b>ecological</b> <b>values,</b> but also infrastructure values, such as road level, road value, and culvert failure risk. Results from the Arapaho-Roosevelt National Forests barrier assessment revealed that most culverts were nearly complete barriers, occurred predominantly in headwater streams, and fragmented 614 of approximately 2400 miles of stream on the National Forest Unit. We found that passage barriers remedied using the un-prioritized approach addressed some <b>ecological</b> <b>values</b> and several infrastructure values; however, sites were well out of order with <b>ecological</b> <b>values</b> and were more closely aligned with infrastructure values. We recommend that selection of fish passage barrier sites to remedy should balance the management of biological resources and transportation networks...|$|R

40|$|This thesis uses a {{literature}} review {{of protected areas}} selection, park management, comprehensive regional land use planning, and cumulative environmental effects and assessment to develop a methodology that identifies areas with concentrations of social and/or <b>ecological</b> <b>values</b> in and around northern national parks. The proposed methodology involves two stages. First, a database of values is developed by taking an inventory of social and <b>ecological</b> <b>values</b> through exxtensive literature reviews, interviews, and consultation with the public. This database is then used in the second step to determine areas with concentrations of social and/or <b>ecological</b> <b>values,</b> or “value hotspots”, using a series of tables and maps. Once developed, the methodology is tested with {{a case study of}} the Greater Kluane Region in southwest Yukon. This analysis identified twelve value hotspots that contain a high number of the study area’s social and <b>ecological</b> <b>values.</b> It is suggested that these hotspots need to be given special consideration in future planning exercises and when exploring questions surrounding cumulative environmental effects arising in and around Kluane National Park and Reserve. In light of the case study findings, some potential future applications in regional planning exercises and in cumulative effects assessments are discussed. The primary recommended planning application involves setting development thresholds or limits of acceptable change for the value hotspots so as to take a proactive stance on cumulative environmental effects. In addition, the values database would be useful in project-level environmental assessments, acting as a checklist of local values...|$|R
