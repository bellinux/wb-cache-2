50|$|Increased {{numbers of}} drug therapies, ageing but more {{knowledgeable}} and demanding populations, and deficiencies {{in other areas}} of the health care system seem to be driving increased demand for the clinical counselling skills of the pharmacist. One of the most important roles that pharmacists are currently taking on is one of pharmaceutical care. Pharmaceutical care involves taking direct responsibility for patients and their disease states, medications, and management of each to improve outcomes. Pharmaceutical care has many benefits that may include but are not limited to: decreased medication errors; increased patient compliance in medication regimen; better chronic <b>disease</b> <b>state</b> <b>management,</b> including hypertension and other cardiovascular disease risk factors; strong pharmacist-patient relationship; and decreased long-term costs of medical care.|$|E
50|$|The role of {{pharmacy}} education, pharmacist licensing, and continuing education vary {{from country to}} country and between regions/localities within countries. In most countries, pharmacists must obtain a university degree at a pharmacy school or related institution, and/or satisfy other national/local credentialing requirements. In many contexts, students must first complete pre-professional (undergraduate) coursework, followed by about four years of professional academic studies to obtain a degree in pharmacy (such as Doctorate of Pharmacy). Pharmacists are educated in pharmacology, pharmacognosy, chemistry, organic chemistry, biochemistry, pharmaceutical chemistry, microbiology, pharmacy practice (including drug interactions, medicine monitoring, medication management), pharmaceutics, pharmacy law, physiology, anatomy, pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics, drug delivery, pharmaceutical care, nephrology, hepatology, and compounding of medications. Additional curriculum may cover diagnosis with emphasis on laboratory tests, <b>disease</b> <b>state</b> <b>management,</b> therapeutics and prescribing (selecting the most appropriate medication for a given patient).|$|E

50|$|A {{collaborative}} practice agreement (CPA) (also {{called a}} consult agreement, collaborative pharmacy practice agreement, physician-pharmacist agreement, standing order or standing protocol, or physician delegation) {{is a legal}} document in the United States that establishes a formal relationship between pharmacists (often clinical pharmacy specialists) and collaborating physicians {{for the purpose of}} establishing a legal and ethical basis for pharmacists to participate in collaborative drug therapy management (CDTM). CDTM is sometimes also referred to as clinical pharmacy services, pharmaceutical care, <b>disease</b> <b>state</b> <b>management,</b> or comprehensive medication management. CDTM is an expansion of the traditional pharmacist scope of practice, allowing for pharmacist-lead management of drug related problems (DRPs) with an emphasis on a collaborative, interdisciplinary approach to pharmacy practice in the healthcare setting. Legal guidance and requirements for the formation of CPAs are established on a state by state basis. The terms of a CPA are decided by the collaborating pharmacist and physician, though templates exist online. CPAs can be specific to a patient population of interest to the two parties, a specific clinical situation or disease state, and/or may outline an evidence-based protocol for managing the drug regimen of patients under the CPA. CPAs have become the subject of intense debate within the pharmacy and medical professions.|$|E

In 1987, Caremark was acquired by Baxter International. In 1991 when Caremark was Baxter International's home infusion subsidiary, Caremark was accused by the United States government of [...] "paying doctors to steer patients to its intravenous drug service." [...] Caremark was fined $160 million for the [...] "four-year-long federal mail-fraud and kickback" [...] scheme in which the [...] "home-infusion business unit made weekly payments to scores of doctors that averaged about $75 per patient for referring those patients to its services.

40|$|Background: Osteoporosis has {{significant}} impact on healthcare costs and quality of life. Amongst the models for collaborative <b>disease</b> <b>state</b> <b>management</b> services published internationally, there is sparse evidence regarding the role of community pharmacists {{in the provision of}} osteoporosis care. Hence, the aim of our study was to explore community pharmacists’ opinions (including the barriers and facilitators) and scope of osteoporosis <b>disease</b> <b>state</b> <b>management</b> services by community pharmacists in Malaysia, informing a vision for developing these services. Methods: Semi-structured individual interviews and focus groups discussions were conducted with community pharmacists from October 2013 to July 2014. Three trained researchers interviewed the participants. Interviews were recorded and transcribed verbatim. Data were analyzed thematically using an interpretative description approach. Results: Nineteen community pharmacists with 1 – 23 years of experience were recruited (in depth interviews: n[*]=[*] 9; focus group discussions: n[*]=[*] 10). These participants reflected on their experience with osteoporosis-related enquiries, which included medication counseling, bone density screening and referral of at-risk patients. Key barriers were the lack of numerous factors: public awareness of osteoporosis, accurate osteoporosis screening tools for community pharmacists, pharmacists’ knowledge on osteoporosis disease and medications, time to counsel patients about bone health, collaboration between pharmacists and doctors, and support from the government and professional body. The pharmacists wanted more continuing education on osteoporosis, osteoporosis awareness campaigns, a simple, unbiased osteoporosis education material, and inter-professional collaboration practices with doctors, and pharmacists’ reimbursement for osteoporosis care. Conclusions: The involvement of community pharmacists in the provision of osteoporosis <b>disease</b> <b>state</b> <b>management</b> was minimal. Only ad-hoc counseling on osteoporosis prevention was performed by community pharmacists.

40|$|Prostate {{cancer is}} one of the most {{prevalent}} malignancies affecting men in the developed world. A spectrum of <b>disease</b> <b>states</b> exists and <b>management</b> is tailored to individual patients. Increasing public awareness and prostate-specific antigen testing have led to earlier detection and the possibility of cure but have increased the risk of overtreatment of indolent disease. Advances in curative modalities have reduced side effects and offer patients a choice of treatments. Nonetheless, many need no intervention and may be safely treated with active monitoring. Choice and timing of therapy for locally advanced and recurrent disease are variable, with potential benefits of early intervention counterbalanced by side effects of treatment.

40|$|Objective: To {{determine}} the overall perception and {{utilization of the}} pharmacist managed medication therapy management (MTM) clinic services, by healthcare professionals in a large, urban, university medical care setting. Methods: This was a cross-sectional, anonymous survey sent to 195 healthcare professionals, including physicians, nurses, and pharmacists at The University of Illinois Outpatient Care Center to {{determine the}}ir perception and utilization of the MTM clinic. The survey consisted of 12 questions and was delivered through a secure online application. Results: Sixty-two healthcare professionals (32 %) completed the survey. 82 % {{were familiar with the}} MTM clinic, and 63 % had referred patients to the clinic. Medication adherence and <b>disease</b> <b>state</b> <b>management</b> was the most common reason for referral. Lack of knowledge on the appropriate referral procedure was the prominent reason for not referring patients to the MTM clinic. Of the providers that were aware of MTM services, 44 % rated care as ‘excellent’, 44 % as ‘good’, 5 % as ‘fair’, and 0 % stated ‘poor’. Strengths of MTM clinic identified by healthcare providers included in-depth education to patients, close follow-up, and detailed medication reconciliation provided by MTM clinic pharmacists. Of those familiar with MTM clinic, recommendations included; increase marketing efforts to raise awareness of the MTM clinic service, create collaborative practice agreements between MTM pharmacists and physicians, and ensure that progress notes are more concise. Conclusion: In a large, urban, academic institution MTM clinic is perceived as a valuable resource to optimize patient care by providing patients with in-depth education as it relates to their prescribed medications and disease states.

40|$|This paper {{considers}} {{the analysis of}} longitudinal data {{complicated by the fact}} that during follow-up patients can be in different <b>disease</b> <b>states,</b> such as remission, relapse or death. If both the response of interest (for example, quality of life (QOL)) and the amount of missing data depend on this <b>disease</b> <b>state,</b> ignoring the <b>disease</b> <b>state</b> will yield biased means. Death as the final state is an additional complication because no measurements after death are taken and often the outcome of interest is undefined after death. We discuss a new approach to model these types of data. In our approach the probability to be in each of the different <b>disease</b> <b>states</b> over time is estimated using multi-state models. In each different <b>disease</b> <b>state,</b> the conditional mean given the <b>disease</b> <b>state</b> is modeled directly. Generalized estimation equations are used to estimate the parameters of the conditional means, with inverse probability weights to account for unobserved responses. This approach shows the effect of the <b>disease</b> <b>state</b> on the longitudinal response. Furthermore, it yields estimates of the overall mean response over time, either conditionally on being alive or after imputing predefined values for the response after death. Graphical methods to visualize the joint distribution of <b>disease</b> <b>state</b> and response are discussed. As an example, the analysis of a Dutch randomized clinical trial for breast cancer is considered. In this study, the long-term impact on the QOL for two different chemotherapy schedules was studied with three disease states: alive without relapse, alive after relapse and death.

40|$|Abstract Background The role of {{community}} pharmacists in <b>disease</b> <b>state</b> <b>management</b> has been mooted for some years. Despite {{a number of}} trials of <b>disease</b> <b>state</b> <b>management</b> services, there is scant literature into the engagement of, and with, pharmacists in such trials. This paper reports pharmacists’ feedback as providers of a Pharmacy Asthma Management Service (PAMS), a trial coordinated across four academic research centres in Australia in 2009. We also propose recommendations for optimal involvement of pharmacists in academic research. Methods Feedback about the pharmacists’ experiences was sought via their participation in either a focus group or telephone interview (for those unable to attend their scheduled focus group) at one of three time points. A semi-structured interview guide focused discussion on the pharmacists’ training to provide the asthma service, their interactions with health professionals and patients as per the service protocol, and the future {{for this type of}} service. Focus groups were facilitated by two researchers, and the individual interviews were shared between three researchers, with data transcribed verbatim and analysed manually. Results Of 93 pharmacists who provided the PAMS, 25 were involved in a focus group and seven via telephone interview. All pharmacists approached agreed to provide feedback. In general, the pharmacists engaged with both the service and research components, and embraced their roles as innovators in the trial of a new service. Some experienced challenges in the recruitment of patients into the service and the amount of research-related documentation, and collaborative patient-centred relationships with GPs require further attention. Specific service components, such as the spirometry, were well received by the pharmacists and their patients. Professional rewards included satisfaction from their enhanced practice, and pharmacists largely envisaged a future for the service. Conclusions The PAMS provided pharmacists an opportunity to become involved in an innovative service delivery model, supported by the researchers, yet trained and empowered to implement the clinical service throughout the trial period and beyond. The balance between support and independence appeared crucial in the pharmacists’ engagement with the trial. Their feedback was overwhelmingly positive, while useful suggestions were identified for future academic trials. </p...|$|E

Given the pivotal role that <b>state</b> <b>management</b> plays in various use cases, in this survey, we present {{some of the most}} important uses of state as an enabler, discuss the alternative approaches used to handle and implement state, propose a taxonomy to capture the many facets of <b>state</b> <b>management,</b> and highlight new research directions. Our aim is to provide insight into disparate <b>state</b> <b>management</b> techniques, motivate others to pursue research in this area, and draw attention to some open problems.

50|$|Associations between {{specific}} <b>disease</b> <b>states</b> {{are also}} associated with and frailty have also been observed, including cardiovascular disease, diabetes mellitus, renal insufficiency and other diseases in which inflammation is prominent. To the extent that dysregulation across several physiologic systems underlie the pathogenesis of the frailty, specific <b>disease</b> <b>states</b> are likely concurrent manifestations of the underlying impaired physiologic function and regulation. It is possible that clinically measurable <b>disease</b> <b>states</b> can manifest themselves or be captured prior to the onset of frailty. No single <b>disease</b> <b>state</b> is necessary and sufficient for the pathogenesis of frailty, since many individuals with chronic diseases are not frail. Therefore, rather than being dependent {{on the presence of}} measurable diseases, frailty is an expression of a critical mass of physiologic impairments.|$|R
