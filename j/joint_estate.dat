40|$|This study {{examines}} the wealth effect of international versus domestic real <b>estate</b> <b>joint</b> ventures on the U. S. participating firm's shareholders. This is done using traditional even study methodology for real <b>estate</b> <b>joint</b> venture announcements. The {{results suggest that}} domestic real <b>estate</b> <b>joint</b> ventures generally result in {{a significant increase in}} the firm's value, while international real <b>estate</b> <b>joint</b> ventures usually have a much less significant to nonsignificant wealth impact. This may be due to the immovability of real properties in foreign countries and the large amount of initial investment in real estate that increase both political and economic risks for international real <b>estate</b> <b>joint</b> ventures. This study also finds that hotel joint ventures generally have a weaker wealth effect than non-hotel real <b>estate</b> <b>joint</b> ventures. ...|$|R

40|$|The article {{regards the}} {{position}} of a spouse of a bankrupt consumer during bankruptcy proceeding. The date of issuing a decision declaring bankruptcy is the date of bankruptcy. From this time matrimonial property regime converts into a compulsory system of separate estates in matrimony. The <b>joint</b> matrimonial <b>estate</b> shall be included in the bankruptcy estate. The rules of management of matrimonial estate are converted. From this moment the course of bankruptcy proceeding depends on the bankrupt spouse’s activity. They can pursue amounts resulting from their share in the <b>joint</b> matrimonial <b>estate,</b> filing the claim with the judge – commissioner. They can also demand exemption from the bankrupt estate assets which do not belong to the bankrupt. Sometimes they do not have any impact on the activity of a bankrupt spouse, for example, they cannot resist the petition to declare bankruptcy. During bankruptcy proceeding a bankrupt spouse is limited in their rights which regard <b>joint</b> matrimonial <b>estate.</b> This situation lasts to the valid conclusion of bankruptcy proceeding. The article emphasizes different depiction of time in the aspect of bankruptcy law. On the one hand, time assigns limits of divagations. During bankruptcy proceeding special rules regarding compulsory matrimonial property regime are in force. On the other hand, time is an impulse of transformation of law and enforcement of new legal institutions such as, for example, an institution of consumer bankruptcy. e. kosior@uwb. edu. plUniwersytet w Białymstoku, Wydział Praw...|$|R

40|$|The term 2 ̆ 2 {{partnership}} estates 2 ̆ 2 is used {{to designate}} a certain class of resulting trusts. These particular resulting trusts are classed with <b>joint</b> <b>estates</b> because, as a usual thing, the legal title is held by {{all the members of}} a partnership as tenants in common, and in equity, the partners are considered as joint tenants for the purpose of administering the trust. But the legal title is not necessarily held by all the members as tenants in common; for it may be vested in one of the partners as tenant in severalty; in which case there is not only the resulting partnership trust, but an additional subordinate resulting trust to the partners as equitable tenants in common. The legal title may be in one or in several. As will be shown, the partners bear a two-fold relation to the beneficial interest in the property; for each has a separate and distinct lien on the property for any balance which may be found to be due him on an accounting; and as to this lien, his interest is purely potential: the balance on an accounting having been paid, the partners now own the residue of the beneficial interest as tenants in common...|$|R

40|$|This study {{compares the}} market {{reaction}} to the announcement of real <b>estate</b> <b>joint</b> venture on returns to stockholders of real estate and non-real estate firms. The main objectives were to examine {{the presence of a}} synergy effect associated with real <b>estate</b> <b>joint</b> ventures and to establish whether real estate firms earn higher excess returns due to their unique institutional characteristics (market locality, and/or market segmentation). Two hypotheses were examined: the synergy hypothesis and the informational asymmetries hypothesis. Real estate firms earn higher excess returns when they participate with non-real estate firms than when they participate with real estate firms. The opposite is true for non-real estate firms. Both real estate participants and non-real estate participants earn positive and statistically significant excess returns with {{no significant difference between the}} two groups. The result of this study is consistent with the synergy effect as a source of gain from the joint venture. It is also consistent with the notion that real estate firms have institutional characteristics in the form of better information about local real estate markets and/or superior management and technical expertise that allow real estate firms to achieve larger gains from joint ventures at the expense of non-real estate firms. ...|$|R

40|$|We {{examine a}} sample of 185 Joint Ventures parented by publicly-traded Equity Real Estate Investment Trusts 1994 – 2001. These {{transactions}} {{are found to be}} motivated by a wide variety of corporate strategies. Shareholder returns for REIT parents are significantly positive, which is consistent with wealth effects previously reported for joint ventures formed by non-REIT real estate firms. In a subsample of joint ventures formed to structure partial dispositions of property, however, abnormal returns are significantly negative, which is consistent with the free cash flow theory of Jensen.

40|$|Joint ventures are {{a commonplace}} {{occurrence}} in the U. S. economy. In particular, firms undertaking real estate projects frequently use {{the joint venture}} {{as a method of}} combining resources. This paper examines security price reactions around real <b>estate</b> <b>joint</b> venture announcements. The evidence indicates that significant increases in the values of the participating firms occur within a two-day announcement period. The changes in values appear to be due principally to the amount of information about the local real estate market possessed by the participating firms, and an information signal about the potential financial viability of the proposed project conveyed by the presence of anchor tenants. While the results are important in their own right, they are also significant in another respect. They seem to confirm the efficiency with which the capital market processes information about the markets for trading real estate claims.

The apartments did not turn out to be built that well. Purchasers sued the partnership successfully for $950,000. Perpetual Real Estates paid it off on the partnership's behalf. Then they sought Michaelson Properties Inc to contribute its share. It did not have the money, and went bust. So they sued Aaron to pay. He argued that Michaelson Properties, Inc was a separate legal person to him, and it was inappropriate to pierce the corporate veil.|$|R
