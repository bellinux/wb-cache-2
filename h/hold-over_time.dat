50|$|In {{a one-way}} time {{transfer}} system, one end transmits its current time over some communication channel {{to one or}} more receivers. The receivers will, at reception, decode the message, and either just report the time, or adjust a local clock which can provide <b>hold-over</b> <b>time</b> reports in between the reception of messages. The advantage of one-way systems is that they can be technically simple and serve many receivers, as the transmitter is unaware of the receivers.|$|E
5000|$|In {{keeping with}} its long history, {{the concept of}} Durgin-Park {{maintains}} the tradition of communal seating at long tables. The menu is designed to offer traditional New England-style fare with a concentration on seafoods, chowders, broiled meats and boiled dinners. The service is also a partial <b>hold-over</b> from the <b>time</b> of its founding as the waitstaff have been encouraged to adopt a [...] "surly" [...] attitude and [...] "backtalk" [...] the clientele. [...] Another sign of its heritage {{is that it has}} only changed head chefs a handful of times in its history.|$|R
50|$|Turkish coffee {{which is}} a <b>hold-over</b> from Ottoman <b>times</b> is often used the same way though with a twist of fortune telling called finjan {{which is a}} form of tasseography. When the coffee is {{consumed}} the fortune teller will look {{at the bottom of the}} cup and read you your future. Arak is one of the most popular alcoholic beverages. It tastes like black liquorice and is clear until mixed with water, which then becomes milky-white. Daweh is a popular yogurt drink made with yogurt, water, salt, and sometimes mint, is consumed during the summer when it is hot. Assyrian rural communities have often traditionally brewed their own organic Wheat Beer and produced their own Wine.|$|R
40|$|Much {{literature}} on image registration 1 â€“ 3 {{has worked with}} purely geometric image deformation models. For such models, interpolation/resampling operations are often the computationally intensive steps when iteratively minimizing the deformation cost function. This article discusses some techniques for efficiently implementing and accelerating these operations. To simplify presentation, we discuss our ideas {{in the context of}} 2 D imaging. However, the concepts readily generalize to 3 D. Our central technique is a table-lookup scheme that makes somewhat liberal use of RAM, but should not strain the resources of modern processors if certain design parameters are appropriately selected. The technique works by preinterpolating and tabulating the grid values of the reference image onto a finer grid along one of the axes of the image. The lookup table can be rapidly constructed using FFTs. Our results show that this technique reduces iterative computation by an order of magnitude. When a minimization algorithm employing coordinate block alternation is used, one can obtain still faster computation by storing certain intermediate quantities as state variables. We refer to this technique as state variable hold-over. When combined with table-lookup, state variable <b>hold-over</b> reduces CPU <b>time</b> by about a factor two, as compared to table-lookup alone...|$|R
