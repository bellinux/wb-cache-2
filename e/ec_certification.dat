50|$|In 2011, Cyberdyne and Tsukuba University jointly {{announced}} that hospital {{trials of the}} full HAL suit would begin in 2012, with tests to continue until 2014 or 2015. By October 2012, HAL suits were in use by 130 different medical institutions across Japan. In February 2013, the HAL system became the first powered exoskeleton to receive global safety certification. In August 2013, HAL received <b>EC</b> <b>certification</b> for clinical use in Europe as the world's first non-surgical medical treatment robot. In addition to its medical applications, the HAL exoskeleton {{has been used in}} construction and disaster response work.|$|E
5000|$|Multifrequency-EIT (MF-EIT) or {{electrical}} impedance spectroscopy (EIS) systems are typically designed to detect or locate abnormal tissue, e.g. precancerous lesions or cancer. Impedance Medical Technologies manufacture systems based on designs by the Research Institute of Radioengineering and Electronics of the Russian Academy of Science in Moscow, that are aimed especially at breast cancer detection. Texas-based Mirabel Medical Systems, Inc. develops a similar solution for non-invasive detection {{of breast cancer}} and offers the T-Scan 2000ED. Zilico Limited distributes an electrical impedance spectroscope named ZedScan I as a medical device supposed to aid cervical intraepithelial neoplasia location/diagnosis.

40|$|Candidates for ITAC {{certification}} {{justify their}} claim {{by providing a}} package of information {{to the members of}} a Certification Board. That package forms the basis of the subsequent interviews with the Certification Board. As part of the information package, candidates are asked to provide Reference Letters from individuals who can vouch for the accuracy of certain items of information in the package. These notes are intended to answer some Frequently Asked Questions about the Reference Letters. Why do I need to provide Reference Letters? For certification at Levels 1 and 2 the Reference Letters are intended to validate the total duration of your experience developing IT architectures, as claimed in the experience requirements at <b>EC</b> 01. For <b>certification</b> at Level 3 the Reference Letters are for a different purpose. They are intended to validate your involvement in each of the projects covered by the Experience Profiles in section 6 of your package. How many Reference Letters do I need to supply? For certification at Levels 1 and 2 you need to provide a letter that vouches for your involvement in each of the projects that you nominate in EC 01 to prove that you have the required number of months of experience. Should a single individual not be in the position to vouch for your involvement over th...|$|R
40|$|Businesses {{contribute}} {{greatly to}} climate change and can have a large impact on their local environment through their energy consumption and waste production. One way to help businesses make the transition toward green practices and engage in more environmentally responsible behaviors is through environmental <b>certification</b> (<b>EC)</b> programs. However, there is a scant literature on the implementation of ECs at the community level or the accessibility of ECs for small businesses. To address this {{gap in the literature}} I first conducted a Community Readiness Assessment to understand the local community's readiness to support sustainable business practices. Second, using Social Marketing principles I interviewed business representatives to uncover the specific factors (i. e., barriers and motivators) that influence a business to pursue an environmental certification in the Champaign-Urbana community. The results of the CRA indicate the Champaign-Urbana community is at a preplanning stage to address business sustainability and would benefit from efforts to increase awareness on the need for greener business practices. Findings from the business interviews indicate a variety of factors can influence a business???s interest in certification. Primary among these is a supportive community context, a sense of responsibility, as well as time and financial restrictions. Overall, the dissertation study makes four important contributions. First, the community context is an important influential factor in businesses??? decision to obtain an EC. Second, the study extends the literature on barriers and motivators toward certification. Third, it presents information about how businesses in a pilot EC program are unique, and fourth, the methodology implemented is a unique combination of theories that are transferable to other investigations and communities...|$|R
40|$|The main aim of {{this thesis}} is  to {{demonstrate}} and critically assess life cycle approaches’ and environmental <b>certification</b> (<b>EC)</b> tools’ potential for supporting decisions for improved environmental performance in the building and real estate sectors. Using life cycle approaches, the thesis shows that for new build and renovation cases aiming for low operational energy use that embodied global warming potential (GWP) due to material production can constitute {{a large portion of}} a building’s lifetime GWP. Therefore life cycle based information about materials’ embodied GWP needs to be made available to and utilized by design process decision makers. It was also shown that applying the Swedish EC tool Miljöbyggnad was useful in highlighting potential positive and negative changes in indoor environmental quality arising from renovation packages aiming at significant operational energy use reduction in existing multifamily buildings. However such renovation packages are not profitable from a property owner perspective. Miljöbyggnad may be useful when designing policy instruments to overcome this.    The thesis also showed that EC and related environmental enhancements contribute to achieving property owners’ and tenants’ overall strategic objectives for value creation. For property owners this arises for example through lower energy costs and attracting desirable tenants. For tenants, value creation arises as support for internal and external environmental communication. For the further development of life cycle approaches’ and EC tools’ application to buildings and real estate {{it is important to consider}} how they can be adapted to consider ‘distance to sustainable’ targets referencing for instance the planetary boundaries approach. It is also interesting to investigate how valuation of buildings and real estate may be performed in a way that expands from the current narrow focus on the economic perspective to also include environmental and social perspectives.

50|$|In {{addition}} to his pioneering {{role in the development}} of the first EIT systems in Sheffield professor Brian H. Brown is currently active in the research and development of an electrical impedance spectroscope based on MF-EIT. According to a study published by Brown in 2000, MF-EIT is able to predict intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN) grades 2 and 3 according to Pap smear with a sensitivity and specificity of 92% each. Whether cervical MF-EIT is going to be introduced as an adjunct or an alternative to the Pap smear has yet to be decided. Brown is academic founder of Zilico Limited which distributes the spectroscope (ZedScan I). The device received <b>EC</b> <b>certification</b> from its Notified Body in 2013 and is currently being introduced into a number of clinics in the UK and healthcare systems across the globe.|$|E
