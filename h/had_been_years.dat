25|$|In late 1792 Phillip, whose {{health was}} suffering, relinquished his {{governorship}} and sailed for England {{on the ship}} Atlantic, taking with him many specimens of plants and animals. He also took Bennelong and his friend Yemmerrawanne, another young Indigenous Australian who, unlike Bennelong, would succumb to English weather and disease and not live to make the journey home. The European population of New South Wales at his departure was 4,221, of whom 3,099 were convicts. The {{early years of the}} colony <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>years</b> of struggle and hardship, but the worst was over, and there were no further famines in New South Wales. Phillip arrived in London in May 1793. He tendered his formal resignation and was granted a pension of £500 a year.|$|E
25|$|World {{food prices}} {{increased}} dramatically in 2007 {{and the first}} and second quarter of 2008, creating a global crisis and causing political and economic instability and social unrest in both poor and developed nations. Although the media spotlight focused on the riots that ensued in the face of high prices, the ongoing crisis of food insecurity <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>years</b> in the making. Systemic causes for the worldwide increases in food prices continue to be the subject of debate. After peaking {{in the second quarter of}} 2008, prices fell dramatically during the late-2000s recession but increased during late 2009 and 2010, reaching new heights in 2011 and 2012 (see 2010–12 world food price crisis) at a level slightly higher than the level reached in 2008. Over the next years, prices fell, reaching a low in March 2016 with the deflated FAO food price index close to pre-crisis level of 2006. Since then prices have been increasing, but as of 2017-05 they have not reached crisis levels again.|$|E
500|$|In November 2002, Justin Timberlake {{released}} his debut album, Justified, and produced the U.S. top-five singles [...] "Rock Your Body" [...] and [...] "Cry Me a River". [...] "Cry Me a River" [...] {{in particular was}} credited for having helped the album sell and peak on the music charts. Justified ended selling four million copies in the United States alone. Although the album established Timberlake's career outside his then-band *NSYNC, Timberlake (who was 22 {{years old at the}} time), was [...] "at a crossroads" [...] and felt he was at the stage of being [...] "burnt out", and thought he had lost his voice [...] "in regards to knowing what (and how) he wanted to sing". Timberlake stated that Justified <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>years</b> in the making, and a record that would re-create its success would be a challenge he was not ready to take.|$|E

500|$|Michelle Erica Green {{watched the}} episode for TrekNation in May 2009. She also {{thought that it}} was a {{pleasant}} episode but that it [...] "never approaches greatness". She felt that D'Sora never achieved the intimacy that Ishara Yar did with Data, and that the subplot was simply something created so that Picard had something to do. She summed up the ending of the episode by saying that [...] "I don't believe that Data can't be hurt emotionally, but he's more invested in his cat than he ever seems to be in Jenna D'Sora." [...] Keith DeCandido reviewed the episode for Tor.com in May 2012, describing it as a [...] "clunker" [...] and a re-hash of the earlier episode [...] "" [...] but [...] "without the gravitas". He thought that having Picard pilot the shuttle was ridiculous, especially as the character admitted in the episode [...] "11001001" [...] that it <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>years</b> since he had worked the helm of a ship. He summed it up saying that, [...] "ultimately, it's a rehash of a Wesley Crusher episode. A really really bad Wesley Crusher episode" [...] and gave it a score of two out of ten.|$|E
500|$|... "Hung Up" [...] {{was ranked}} at number 76 on Rolling Stones [...] "100 Best Songs of the 2000s" [...] decade-end list, calling it [...] "One of her [...] most {{captivating}} hits ever — {{and thanks to}} those deceptively hard-hitting lyrics, {{one of her most}} personal." [...] NME ranked it at number 39 in their list of the best tracks of 2005. Slant Magazine's writers listed the song at number 36 on their list of Best of the Aughts: Singles saying: [...] "'Hung Up' employs a ticking clock to represent fear of wasted time, but Madonna isn't singing about aging or saving the world—she's talking about love. It <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>years</b> since Madge sounded this vapid. With its pitched-upward vocals, infectious arpeggio sample from ABBA's 'Gimme Gimme Gimme (A Man After Midnight),' and the bridge's unironic, archetypical key change, the track decidedly points to the past, and it proved that, 20 years into her career, Madonna was still the one and only Dancing Queen". The song was also named the 26th best single of 2005 by Pitchfork Media. Stylus Magazine included [...] "Hung Up" [...] on their ranking of the best singles from 2005 at number 11. In 2016, [...] "Hung Up" [...] was named in the online poll by Digital Spy, as [...] "The Biggest Pop Song of the 21st Century".|$|E

The film was a commercial failure, as That's The Way Of The World <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>years</b> before; however, EWF's cover version of [...] "Got to Get You into My Life" [...] was the biggest hit from the movie's soundtrack, reaching numbers one and nine on the R and Pop singles charts, respectively.|$|E
