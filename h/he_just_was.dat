25|$|In 1490 he {{received}} his Doctorate in Theology, though he never made any original contribution to Theology. <b>He</b> <b>just</b> <b>was</b> not interested in this abstract speculation. Indeed, in the disputations that he is recorded as having carried out, with other University Doctors, he always comes off second best. He {{was more interested in}} the practical means of salvation—in his terms, a return to poverty and complete self-denial—and these he preached, in a Flemish accent, but in powerful French. He followed the rule of Francis of Paola very strictly and preached that all priests and monks should do so too. By 1493, there were 80 students at the College. They only left when they went to a monastery or to become a parish priest. Standonck hoped by this means to reform the church. In the same year, the King had set up a Commission to examine abuses in the church and he was asked to give a lecture to them, which he did on 12 November at Tours. In this he set out a long list of demands. Most of these were familiar to church reformers—only fit and proper persons should be priests, there should be no money charged for their services, or for accepting a post. There should be free election (by fit and proper priests) of their bishops, or monks of their abbots, and all other religious positions (including teachers at the University). He added demands that the priests and monks should lead exemplary lives. This meant his by now well known strictly ascetic life—including enforcing celibacy among the clergy.|$|E
2500|$|Yoh's friend. He has a {{part-time}} job at a restaurant and, like Fumiya, he is calm and caring (fortunately, he has some common sense and is not as dense as Fumiya). Yoh says that ninety percent of what Asaoka says is out of kindness and that whoever goes out with him would be happy {{because of all the}} kind words he says. He once went on a date with Haruna to make Yoh jealous. When Yoh finally appears at the date Yui tells her that he was acting. He hides his true feelings in jokes, but when Mami tells him [...] "You're always deceiving yourself by passing things off as a joke, so...now you don't even know yourself what your true feelings are." [...] After that he told Haruna that he likes her, but she thought that <b>he</b> <b>just</b> <b>was</b> acting.|$|E

60|$|The {{morning after}} gentle Sister South Wind {{arrived on the}} Green Meadows, Peter Rabbit came hopping and {{skipping}} down the Lone Little Path from the Green Forest. Peter was happy. He didn't know why. <b>He</b> <b>just</b> <b>was</b> happy. It was in the air. Everybody else seemed happy, too. Peter had to stop every few minutes just to kick up his heels and try to jump over his own shadow. He had felt just that way ever since gentle Sister South Wind arrived.|$|E

50|$|Deadpool's claim after {{destroying}} T-Ray's artifact {{that this}} proves {{he is the}} true Wade Wilson could mean that <b>he</b> <b>just</b> <b>was</b> {{not one of the}} copies T-Ray created during that story. This has puzzled fans who have found no logical reason that the disappearance of the copies would in any way prove or disprove T-Ray's story. It is possible that {{the fact that they were}} absorbed back into T-Ray showed they were fragments of his shattered personality, not those of Deadpool's.|$|E

On release from his service, and about to leave once again for Paris and an open future, Pierre stops off at the beach, takes his clothes off and wanders into the sea.|$|E

It was amazing. He brought a real sensitivity to the role of Griff. He just kind of was Griff, {{there is no other way}} to say it. Ryan just brought so many layers to it straight away...the first test he did was quite a short little piece but there was a sneakiness, there was this real belief in the character. <b>He</b> <b>just</b> <b>was</b> Griff." ...|$|E
5000|$|Ory {{received}} {{a check for}} around $8,000 on the spot, and royalties of about $600 every quarter thereafter. [...] "That started him buying his new home," [...] said Bigard, who noted a change in Ory from then on. [...] "At first it was nothing big, {{but do you know}} that he never thanked me for getting straight with his royalties. Never said a word. Maybe success was having something to do with it. … I didn't stay around till the end, but he was making a lot of enemies. <b>He</b> <b>just</b> <b>was</b> a different guy than I had known and helped — been glad to help, in fact." ...|$|E

50|$|One day Larsen starts {{reading a}} book on 'Psychotic time', but decides to take a stroll outside instead. When walking around his chalet, he looks into the window and sees a man sitting where <b>he</b> <b>just</b> <b>was</b> and reading the same book, then put the book aside {{to look out the}} window. Larsen realises that it is the same man from the garage, and by seeing him clearly, realises that it is himself mere moments ago. Bayliss tells him that the {{hallucinations}} are psychoretinal streams of images, {{and the only way to}} fuse the two time channels back together is to be in the same place as one of the doubles, and 'forcibly occupy the same physical co-ordinates'. The idea vexes Larsen, who is deeply troubled by the idea of seeing himself in a different time frame, and decided to keep a revolver in his letterbox for protection.|$|E

5000|$|Glaser {{remarked to}} Soul that {{he hated the}} car {{and that he was}} [...] "going to destroy that car...burn it down every chance I get", and {{repeated}} the story in the 1999 [...] "reunion" [...] interview. Several scenes of Glaser driving the car show him smashing the front wheels into curbs as he slides the car around corners and such, but that may also be attributable {{to the fact that he}} is primarily an actor, not a trained stunt-driver. Over the years, with the Starsky & Hutch Torino gaining in popularity and becoming a much-loved icon of the show and of the Seventies in general, Glaser has not so much grown to appreciate the car as he has learned to simply accept its popularity as a necessary component of the fans' appreciation of the show. In fact, during filming of the 2004 Starsky & Hutch movie, Glaser had several opportunities to sit in the newest iteration of [...] "his" [...] car, and even drive them, but he refused. <b>He</b> <b>just</b> <b>was</b> not interested; however, in 2004, during the last day of filming a movie in Canada, the crew wanted a group picture of Glaser with a Starsky and Hutch Torino, so he agreed to sit in the driver's seat of a Limited Edition replica with the crew surrounding the car http://starskytorino.com/franksharib/franksharib.html. In the summer of 2012 during the introduction to the [...] "Las Vegas Car Stars 2012" [...] charity event, Glaser drove up in a S&H Torino replica; after being introduced by the master of ceremonies, he got out of the Torino and was cheered by the crowd.|$|E
5000|$|Facundo Cabral {{was born}} in the Argentine city of La Plata, and could not talk until the age of nine. He was {{illiterate}} until the age of 14. His wife and daughter died when he was 40. He met his father at the age of 46. Facundo did not have an easy childhood; he left his home early and was dedicated to all kinds of tasks. From the most humble of beginnings, he came to inspire millions around the world through his songs, poems and 66 books. He walked 400 km at the age of nine to look for work to support his mother and seven siblings after his father abandoned them. When he left, his mother told him: [...] "This is the second, and last gift I can give you. The first was to give you life, and the second one, the liberty to live it." [...] He traveled to Mar del Plata and got a job in a hotel where the owner saw him with his guitar and gave him the opportunity to sing. He wrote music that inspired millions. He met Mother Teresa. He performed in over 165 countries in eight different languages. His earlier artistic name was El Indio Gasparino. His wife and one-year-old daughter were killed in 1978 in the PSA Flight 182 crash near San Diego, California. He was nearly blind and crippled, and was a bone cancer survivor as well. When he was diagnosed in his twenties, his doctor told him he only had a couple of months to live but he survived much longer and was an inspiration to all. He loved travelling, it was a part of his life. He did not care about money, <b>he</b> <b>just</b> <b>was</b> happy to be alive. Facundo Cabral was killed in Guatemala after a concert. He gave his testimony of life to the world in songs, poems or just chatting, and was a great loss to the world. He always said, Siempre le pregunto a Dios, ¿por qué a mí tanto me diste? Me diste miseria, hambre, felicidad, lucha, luces... vi todo. Sé que hay cáncer, sífilis y primavera, y buñuelos de manzana (I always ask God, why did you give me so much? You gave me misery, hunger, happiness, struggle, lights... I saw everything. I know there is cancer, syphilis and spring, and apple fritters).|$|E
