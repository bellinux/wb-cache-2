500|$|The band's {{array of}} {{influences}} mostly include alternative rock and emo bands Superchunk, Jawbox, Sunny Day Real Estate, the Flaming Lips, Fugazi, and Pavement. Additional artists {{that inspired the}} band includes Braid and The Rentals, Elvis Costello, Pixies, Tom Waits, Ben Folds, the Weakerthans, Poster Children, the Carpenters, and the Cardigans. AllMusic additionally credits bands such as Weezer and the Get Up Kids as influences, among others. Pierre quoted Waits that [...] "all anybody ever does is imitate their favorite artist—badly," [...] adding, [...] "we're just regurgitating all the crap we listened to in the late '80s and early '90s, the music that <b>got</b> <b>us</b> <b>into</b> playing music in the first place." ...|$|E

[...] Some of the protests were seen as an attempt to address the Obama administration's [...] "double standard" [...] in dealing with Wall Street.|$|E

[...] When Jake Tapper of ABC News pushed Obama to explain the fact that his administration hasn't prosecuted any Wall Street executives who didn't play by the rules, he replied, [...] "One of the biggest problems about the collapse of Lehman's and the subsequent financial crisis and the whole subprime lending fiasco is that a lot of that stuff wasn't necessarily illegal; it was just immoral or inappropriate or reckless." [...] On October 18, when interviewed by ABC news, he said [...] "in some ways, they’re not that different from some of the protests that we saw coming from the Tea Party. Both on the left and the right, I think people feel separated from their government. They feel that their institutions aren’t looking out for them." ...|$|E

2500|$|Palin {{has since}} been {{critical}} of Obama's handling of the United States' military role in the 2011 military intervention in Libya. On April 16, 2011, she said Obama [...] "willfully ignored {{the will of the}} American people... when you <b>got</b> <b>us</b> <b>into</b> a third war for fuzzy and inconsistent reasons, a third war that we cannot afford." [...] She further criticized him on April 26, demanding Obama [...] "step up and justify our Libyan involvement, or Americans are going to demand you pull out." [...] She continued, [...] "Simply put, what are we doing there? You’ve put us in a strategic no man’s land. If Gaddafi’s got to go, then tell NATO our continued participation hinges on this: We strike hard and Gaddafi will be gone. If, as you and your spokesmen suggest, we’re not to tell Libya what to do when it comes to that country’s leadership, and if you can’t explain to Americans why we’re willing to protect Libyan resources and civilians but not Syria’s, Yemen’s, Bahrain’s, Egypt’s, Israel’s, etc., then there is no justification for U.S. human and fiscal resources to be spent." ...|$|E

[...] OUBC's coach Sean Bowden said the conditions were [...] "the worst I have ever seen" [...] while Matthew Pinsent referred to them as [...] "absolutely biblical".

5000|$|It's a {{lot more}} direct, 'Cosmology' had to be listened to {{a few times to}} be digested, whereas this is hard hitting {{straight}} away and much more immediate.

We Fish-Eaters had not learned to add our {{strength}} until our strength was the strength of all of us. But the Meat-Eaters, who lived across the divide in the Big Valley, stood together, hunted together, fished together, and fought together. One day they came into our valley. Each family of <b>us</b> <b>got</b> <b>into</b> its own cave and tree. There were only ten Meat-Eaters, but they fought together, and we fought, each family by itself." ...|$|R
5000|$|The Committee of Concerned Asian Scholars (CCAS) {{was founded}} in 1968 {{by a group of}} {{graduate}} students and younger faculty as part of the opposition to the American participation in the Vietnam War. They proposed a [...] "radical critique of the assumptions which <b>got</b> <b>us</b> United States <b>into</b> Indo-China and were keeping us from getting out." [...] The caucus was held at the Association for Asian Studies convention in Philadelphia, but was a radical critique of that professional association's values, organization, and leadership. The group was largely formed due to the Association for Asian Studies lack of public stance on the Vietnam War. Most of the original members were graduate students or junior faculty in Area Studies programs at Harvard, Stanford, University of Michigan, University of California at Berkeley, and Columbia University, although there were also independent scholars and those with no affiliation in the field.|$|R

[...] "We mustn't take the easiest day to fast, but the hardest--and that's Sunday, because, as you say, we mostly have roast beef that day instead of cold ditto. It wouldn't be much {{punishment}} to fast from ditto. Let's take next Sunday. It {{will be a}} good day, for father is going to exchange for the morning service with the Upper Lowbridge minister.

60|$|The {{government}} has determined on exhibiting vigour, {{and there was}} a great show of troops the night succeeding the combat. Curious to see the effect of all this, two or three of <b>us</b> <b>got</b> <b>into</b> a carriage and drove through the streets, about nine o'clock. We found some two or three thousand men on the Boulevards, and the Rue St. Denis, in particular, which had been the scene of the late disorder, was watched with jealous caution. In all, there might have been four or five thousand men under arms. They were merely in readiness, leaving a free passage for carriages, though in some of the narrow streets we found the bayonets pretty near our faces.|$|R
2500|$|Australia's first Test of the 1996 Tour to Europe against Italy marked David Campese's 100th {{international}} Test.

The Test took place two days after Campese's 34th birthday in Padova, where Campese had played rugby in Italy for three years from 1984 to 1986. The Test took place close to his father's birthplace, Vicenza. In Campo: Still Entertaining Campese recalls that, [...] "Unfortunately, they were not treated to vintage performances, by myself or {{the rest of the}} Wallabies.

5000|$|... "Bob Noyce and I were {{involved}} with a step-and-repeat camera. At the time I did use my optics knowledge. Jean Hoerni was involved with diffusion {{and he had a}} great deep, physical insight into {{a lot of things about}} the physics of semiconductors. Gordon Moore also was involved with diffusion. He made a great contribution…he was the only one that knew how to blow glass so he was making all the jungles for the diffusion and he also was involved with metal evaporation. Sheldon Roberts just went off and <b>got</b> <b>us</b> right <b>into</b> the silicon crystal business. Vic Grinich was the one that really knew what transistors were and what they were used for and he set up all the testing facilities. Julie Blank was in charge of the facilities and also making equipment. Gene Kleiner was a magnificent equipment manufacturer, great machinist. He just loved that. He was good at that. And Gene also started taking over some of the administrative tasks. It's looked on as a group of eight but we did get some other key people and that's where the story is not quite accurate. The contributions of the people outside of the eight of <b>us</b> never <b>got</b> really recognized very well. Dave Allison, in particular, was a key person involved with the diffusions." ...|$|R
