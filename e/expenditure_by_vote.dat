40|$|Public-service output {{depends on}} input expenditures, on own {{personal}} characteristics, {{and on the}} characteristics of the other residents in the community (the peer group effect). In a community model with public <b>expenditures</b> set <b>by</b> <b>voting,</b> with migration between communities, and with land price differentials (capitalization), it is shown that communities may become heterogeneous in composition and (second-best) inefficient. This equilibrium occurs when the peer group effect is neither "too strong" nor "too weak. " The inefficiency arises because an externality is created by migration. The land price differential does not play the part of the "price" of the better peer group, but of a transfer payment. Copyright 1990 by University of Chicago Press. ...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{considers}} a two-community model with free mobility, public <b>expenditures</b> set <b>by</b> majority <b>voting,</b> amenities that differ across communities, and {{two types of}} taxpayers sorting across communities according to different preferences. Residents pay local taxes, consume public services, and {{have the right to}} vote. Vacationers cannot vote, yet pay local taxes, and consume amenities. Amenities attract vacationers whose tax payments produce rents reducing the costs of public spending for permanent residents. These extractable rents produce stability in otherwise unstable equilibria. Relatively wealthy communities are generally less able than poor communities to extract rents.

Sensitivity analyses explored assumptions of the method. ResultsBoth current and former smokers ages 75 and over have about 12 times the smoking-attributable expenditures of their current and former smoker counterparts 3522 ̆ 0 ac 2 ̆ 01 c 54 years of age.
