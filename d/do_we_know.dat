It {{is possible that the}} community ceased in 1212, when the Gloucester monks were killed by the locals; we don't know whether they were replaced. Nor <b>do</b> <b>we</b> <b>know</b> whether the clas resumed after Llywelyn the Great retook the area. Community life probably ended with the appointment of a rector by King Henry III in 1246, although this latter is not conclusive; a college might be headed by a rector, although they were usually styled provost. There have been suggestions that there were one or more chantry chapels, which could suggest the presence of more than one priest.|$|E

The plot follows the fictional {{story of a}} photographer as she encounters emotional and existential obstacles in her life and begins to consider the idea that individual and group consciousness can influence the material world. Her experiences are offered by the filmmakers to illustrate the movie's thesis about quantum physics and consciousness. The 2004 theatrical release of the film {{was followed by a}} substantially changed, extended DVD version in 2006.|$|E

500|$|Glosserman and {{the rest}} of the {{production}} team met together to put together a focus for the film; they centered their efforts on answering the question: [...] "How does Wikipedia get at the truth?" [...] They also wanted to provide information for everyday individuals wanting to know about Wikipedia's background and functioning. Experts were sought out, including the author of The Age of American Unreason Susan Jacoby, to discuss Wikipedia's approach to scholars knowledgeable about specific subject matter. Glosserman commented in an interview with IndieWire, [...] "We tried to get people offering compelling arguments for either side of any particular topic because our intention was to be objective and to let the viewer make up his or her own mind." [...] The narrative structure of the film What the Bleep <b>Do</b> <b>We</b> <b>Know!?</b> served as an inspiration for Glosserman during the production process. As a non-profit project, the film had received more than $55,000 in donations by March 2009.|$|E

500|$|Harring {{described}} her interpretation {{after seeing the}} film: [...] "When I saw it the first time, I {{thought it was the}} story of Hollywood dreams, illusion and obsession. It touches on the idea that nothing is quite as it seems, especially the idea of being a Hollywood movie star. The second and third times I saw it, I thought it dealt with identity. <b>Do</b> <b>we</b> <b>know</b> who we are? And then I kept seeing different things in it... There's no right or wrong to what someone takes away from it or what they think the film is really about. It's a movie that makes you continuously ponder, makes you ask questions. I've heard over and over, 'This is a movie that I'll see again' or 'This is a movie you've got to see again.' It intrigues you. You want to get it, but I don't think it's a movie to be gotten. It's achieved its goal if it makes you ask questions." ...|$|E

[...] Leah Greenblatt of Entertainment Weekly did not see a departure from Swift, recalling lyrics to be familiar of those of [...] "Love Story" [...] and [...] "You Belong with Me". However, she ended with [...] "What <b>do</b> <b>we</b> <b>know?</b> The song sounds Taylor-made (oh, the wit!) for her fans, and we’re just happy she’s still sweet, neat, and [...] age-appropriate." [...] An uncredited review from People magazine said the track led the Valentine's Day soundtrack. Brittany Talarico of British magazine OK! called the song's refrains [...] "catchy" [...] and described the overall feel as [...] "sweet." [...] Andrew Leahey of Allmusic {{said that there was}} special attention placed on Swift's tracks on the soundtrack, particularly on the song. Jody Rosen of Slate magazine declared [...] "Today Was a Fairytale" [...] "track of the week", highlighting its imagery that, according to her, [...] "sharpen the focus instead of softening it." [...] Jonah Weiner, also of Slate, wrote, [...] "This song is a funny mix: some of her tightest songwriting to date, but some of her laziest lyrics." [...] He mentioned that in the lyrics, Swift mainly [...] "invoke the cliché and hope it [...] her heavy lifting for her." ...|$|E
500|$|Although not {{achieving}} the sensationalism of tulips, daffodils and narcissi {{have been much}} celebrated in art and literature (see The Arts). The largest demand for narcissi bulbs were large trumpet daffodils, N. poeticus and N. bulbocodium, and Istanbul became important in the shipping of bulbs to western Europe. By the early baroque period both tulips and narcissi were {{an important component of}} the spring garden. By 1739 a Dutch nursery catalogue listed 50 different varieties. A catalog of a Dutch nursery from 1739 already counted 50 varieties. In 1757 Hill gave an account of the history and cultivation of the daffodil in his edited version of the works of Thomas Hale, writing [...] "The garden does not afford, in its Kind, a prettier plant than this; nor <b>do</b> <b>we</b> <b>know</b> one that has been so early, or so honorably mention'd by all Kinds of Writers" [...] (see illustration). Interest grew further when varieties that could be grown indoors became available, primarily the bunch flowered (multiple flower heads) N. tazetta (Polyanthus Narcissus). However interest varied by country. Maddock (1792) does not include narcissi in his list of the eight most important cultivated flowering plants in England, whereas in the Netherlands van Kampen (1760) stated that N. tazetta (Narcisse à bouquet) is the fifth most important – [...] "Le Narcisse à bouquet est la premiere fleur, après les Jacinthes, les Tulipes les Renoncules, et les Anemones, (dont nous avons déja parlé,) qui merite nôtre attention". Similarly Philip Miller, in his Gardeners Dictionary (1731–1768) refers to cultivation in Holland, Flanders and France, but not England, because it was too difficult, a similar observation was made by Sir James Justice at this time. However, for most species of Narcissus Lauremberg's dictum Magna cura non indigent Narcissi was much cited.|$|E
