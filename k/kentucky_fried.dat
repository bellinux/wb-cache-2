His brigade {{arrived at the}} Battle of Shiloh {{at the end of}} the second day, too late to participate in the fighting. Buell reported that Fry's performance was [...] "inefficient". His brigade did participate in the siege of Corinth. Returning to Kentucky, he led his brigade into action at the Battle of Perryville just a few miles away from where he was born. Once the Confederate forces had withdrawn from <b>Kentucky,</b> <b>Fry</b> took command of the 3rd Division, Center Wing, of the XIV Corps (Army of the Cumberland), which he led in the Stones River Campaign; he and most of his division were not engaged in the Battle of Stones River. For much of the remainder of the war, he commanded the North Central Kentucky sub-district. At the close of the war, he was in command of Camp Nelson, the vast Union recruiting and deployment depot south of Lexington. He was mustered out of the service on August 24, 1865, without being awarded the brevet rank of major general, which was usually bestowed automatically in the case of a brigadier general with Fry's time in grade.|$|R

5|$|Once {{too large}} for Sanders to manage, <b>Kentucky</b> <b>Fried</b> Chicken grew to {{overwhelm}} John Y. Brown as well. In July 1971, Brown sold the company to the Connecticut-based Heublein, a packaged food and drinks corporation, for US$285 million (around US$1.6 billion in 2013). Brown personally gained around $35 million from the sale. Reuters opined that the takeover probably saved the company from disaster. Heublein planned to increase KFC's volume with its sales and marketing expertise.|$|E

Precursors of this counterculture subversive humor in film were two non-"college movies", M*A*S*H, a 1970 satirical dark comedy, and The <b>Kentucky</b> <b>Fried</b> Movie, a 1977 formless comedy consisting of a series of sketches (which was also directed by Landis).|$|E
50|$|Nelson was to {{work out}} details for a {{distribution}} of arms in <b>Kentucky</b> with Joshua <b>Fry</b> Speed in Louisville, and as he headed off, Secretary of War Simon Cameron released 5,000 ancient Prussian flintlocks that had been converted into percussion cap rifles that would shift {{the balance of power}} to the Union Home Guard.July 1, 1861, Nelson was detached from the Navy with instructions to organize a force of 10,000 troops for an expedition into East Tennessee. Two weeks later, Nelson spoke with Union leaders from southeastern Kentucky at Lancaster and Crab Orchard.

Thomas E. Bramlette had one company in camp on July 20 and another on July 24, 1861. Some seven miles north of Lancaster and twelve miles from the rail depot at Nicholasville, Jessamine County, Richard M. Robinson offered to lease 425 acres of first-class rolling pastureland at Hoskins Crossroads. Nelson considered this as a much better site for a camp of instruction and the new recruits were marched into Camp Dick Robinson in violation of Kentucky's somewhat duplicitous position of neutrality.|$|R

5|$|The Cartman {{drug market}} subplot was heavily {{influenced}} by the 1983 crime film Scarface, with Cartman resembling fictional drug lord Tony Montana and KFC founder Colonel Sanders as antagonist Alejandro Sosa. The episode also included several jokes about Pope Benedict XVI and the child sexual abuse scandals that had been surrounding the Catholic Church at the time. The concept of a former KFC restaurant becoming a marijuana dispensary came from a news story about a real marijuana dispensary in Palms, Los Angeles, built at a site formerly housing a <b>Kentucky</b> <b>Fried</b> Chicken franchise.|$|E
5|$|Usage of the Octopus {{card was}} {{extended}} to Macau and the Chinese city of Shenzhen in 2006. In collaboration with China UnionPay, Octopus Cards Limited introduced Octopus card usage to two Fairwood restaurants in Shenzhen in August 2006. In 2008, five Café de Coral locations in Shenzhen also started accepting Octopus. Value cannot be reloaded to Octopus cards in Shenzhen, but the Automatic Add Value Service is available to automatically deduct money value from a customer's credit card to reload an Octopus card. The two Fairwood restaurants in Shenzhen that were enabled for Octopus card payments are located at Luohu Commercial City and Shenzhen Railway Station. Shenzhen became the first city outside Hong Kong in which Octopus cards may be accepted as payment. In Macau, the Octopus card was introduced in December 2006 when two <b>Kentucky</b> <b>Fried</b> Chicken restaurants in the territory adopted its usage as payment. Similar to its usage in Shenzhen, an Octopus card may not be reloaded in Macau, and the currency exchange rate between the Macanese pataca and the Hong Kong dollar when using an Octopus card is MOP1:HKD1. The two <b>Kentucky</b> <b>Fried</b> Chicken restaurants in Macau that adopted the Octopus card for payment are located at the Rua Do Campo and the Sands Casino.|$|E
5|$|The {{son of a}} U.S. congressman, Brown's {{talent for}} {{business}} became evident in college, where he made {{a substantial amount of}} money selling Encyclopædia Britannica sets. After briefly practicing law with his father, he purchased <b>Kentucky</b> <b>Fried</b> Chicken from founder Harland Sanders in 1964. Brown turned the company into a worldwide success, and sold his interest in the company for a huge profit in 1971. He then invested in several other restaurant ventures, but none matched the success of KFC. During the 1970s, he also owned, at various times, three professional basketball teams – the American Basketball Association's Kentucky Colonels, and the National Basketball Association's Boston Celtics and Buffalo Braves (currently the Los Angeles Clippers).|$|E
5|$|Through the series, {{the cities}} used within the Crazy Taxi games have been {{influenced}} by real-world cities, including San Francisco, Los Angeles, New York City, and Las Vegas. Certain versions of the Crazy Taxi game include in-game counterparts of real-world businesses, including Pizza Hut, <b>Kentucky</b> <b>Fried</b> Chicken, FILA, and Tower Records; these were often destination targets for the passengers. Although {{this is one of the}} most prominent examples of product placement in video gaming history, it is generally looked upon relatively favorably amongst gamers, perhaps because it gives a sense of realism to the fictional cities in the game. These establishments have been replaced with generic businesses in later games due to licensing difficulties.|$|E
5|$|Burger King's first broiled chicken {{sandwich}} {{was introduced}} in 1990 and was called the BK Broiler. This sandwich was made with lettuce, tomato and a dill ranch sauce served on an oat dusted roll. The product {{came at a time}} of fundamental change in terms of chicken product in the restaurant industry; more than 90% of chicken products sold by the major chains were fried. Shortly after its introduction, the sandwich was selling more than a million units per day, and poaching sales from traditional fried chicken chains such as <b>Kentucky</b> <b>Fried</b> Chicken. Additionally, the sandwiches were part of an industry trend towards the diversification of menus with healthier products such as reformulated cooking methods and salads. At the time, the sandwich had 379 calories and 18grams of fat, 10 of which came from the sauce.|$|E
5|$|From {{the early}} 1980s, Khoo tried {{to pursue a}} Master of Business Administration (MBA) degree from various universities, {{but all of them}} {{rejected}} his application as he did not possess a first degree for admission. Khoo only had two professional diplomas – a Diploma in Administrative Management and a Certified Diploma in Accounting and Finance from ACCA. He finally received an unconditional offer from the University of Stirling after he impressed the visiting Director of the MBA programme showing how he managed the award-winning shopping mall. In 1989, accompanied by his wife, he left Malaysia to pursue his MBA studies in Scotland and graduated with Distinction in 1991. Instead of returning to Malaysia, he went to Singapore again to seek better opportunities there and was offered the job as Director of Operations for <b>Kentucky</b> <b>Fried</b> Chicken (KFC).|$|E
5|$|In 1991, Brown {{formed a}} {{partnership}} with recording artist Kenny Rogers, co-founding and serving as CEO of Kenny Rogers Roasters, an international chain of wood-roasted chicken restaurants. The founding of Kenny Rogers Roasters {{was part of a}} larger movement in the restaurant industry toward healthier, take-home offerings. Roasters immediately found itself in competition with Boston Chicken (later known as Boston Market) and several smaller roasted chicken chains. <b>Kentucky</b> <b>Fried</b> Chicken also introduced a roasted chicken line of products called Rotisserie Gold to compete with Roasters and Boston Chicken. In December 1992, Clucker's, a smaller player in the roasted chicken market, sued Kenny Rogers Roasters, claiming the chain had copied its recipes and menus. The lawsuit continued until Roasters purchased a majority stake in Cluckers in August 1994. Brown then took Roasters public and grew it to a chain of more than 1,000 restaurants before selling his interest in the franchise to the Malaysia-based Berjaya Group in 1996.|$|E
5|$|Some of PETA's {{earliest}} {{forays into}} gaming include Flash-based games such as Make Fred Spew (2001) and Save the Chicks (2003), which were included {{as part of}} PETA's anti-dairy and <b>Kentucky</b> <b>Fried</b> Cruelty campaigns. These games received some coverage in academic and news sources, and PETA's head of online marketing, Joel Bartlett, identified their 2004 Revenge of the PETA Tomatoes and the Frogger parody, Lobster Liberation, {{as some of the}} organization's earliest released games. However it was not until 2007 that PETA began to attract wider attention within the gaming community with its release of Super Chick Sisters, a parody of Super Mario Bros. Controlling two female chicks named Nugget and Chickette, the player sets out to rescue vegetarian actress Pamela Anderson, who has publicly revealed animal cruelty endemic to KFC's food production, from KFC's mascot Colonel Sanders. In 2009, the game was met with a sequel, New Super Chick Sisters, a homage to New Super Mario Bros. In this game, McDonald's mascot Ronald McDonald kidnaps Anderson with the intent of using her as a Happy Meal ingredient, and the Chick Sisters must rescue her again.|$|E

25|$|This {{is common}} with {{companies}} {{that want to}} retain brand recognition while moving away from an outdated image: American Telephone and Telegraph became AT, <b>Kentucky</b> <b>Fried</b> Chicken became KFC to de-emphasize the role of frying {{in the preparation of}} its signature dishes, and British Petroleum became BP.

25|$|Other {{fast food}} {{restaurants}} like Taco Bell have previously employed a similar strategy.

That evening, he observed prayer with a Catholic priest before being escorted to the Stateville execution chamber to receive a lethal injection.|$|E
25|$|In 1964, {{the shoe}} company {{transferred}} Gacy to Springfield {{to work as}} a salesman. He was eventually promoted to manager of his department.

Marlynn's father subsequently purchased three <b>Kentucky</b> <b>Fried</b> Chicken restaurants in Waterloo, Iowa, and Gacy and his wife moved to Waterloo so he could manage the restaurants, with the understanding that they would move into Marlynn's parents' home (which was vacated for the couple).|$|E
25|$|The company's rapid {{expansion}} {{to more than}} 600 locations became overwhelming for the aging Sanders. In 1964, then 73 years old, he sold the <b>Kentucky</b> <b>Fried</b> Chicken corporation for $2 million ($ million today) to a partnership of Kentucky businessmen headed by John Y. Brown, Jr. (a then-29-year-old lawyer and future governor of Kentucky) and Jack C. Massey (a venture capitalist and entrepreneur), and he became a salaried brand ambassador.

25|$|During this time, {{he began}} {{work as a}} {{commercial}} jingle writer, which continued well into the 1970s.

His singing-only credits include commercials for <b>Kentucky</b> <b>Fried</b> Chicken, Pepsi, and Dr Pepper. Manilow won two Clio Awards in 1976 for his work for Tab and Band-Aid.|$|E

25|$|As {{with many}} other underachieving {{baseball}} teams, a curse is believed to lurk over the Tigers. After their 1985 Japan Series win, fans celebrated by having people who looked like Tigers players jump into the Dotonbori Canal.
