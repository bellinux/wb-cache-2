500|$|Then, in {{a series}} of {{stunning}} victories, UNITA regained control over Caxito, Huambo, M'banza Kongo, Ndalatando, and Uíge, provincial capitals it had not held since 1976, and moved against Kuito, Luena, and Malange. Although the U.S. and South African governments had stopped aiding UNITA, supplies continued to come from Mobutu in Zaire. UNITA tried to wrest control of Cabinda from the MPLA in January 1993. Edward DeJarnette, Head of the U.S. Liaison Office in Angola <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>Clinton</b> <b>Administration,</b> warned Savimbi that, if UNITA hindered or halted Cabinda's production, the U.S. would end its support for UNITA.

The government engaged in an ethnic cleansing of Bakongo, and, to a lesser extent Ovimbundu, in multiple cities, most notably Luanda, on 22 January in the Bloody Friday massacre. UNITA and government representatives met five days later in Ethiopia, but negotiations failed to restore the peace. The United Nations Security Council sanctioned UNITA through Resolution 864 on 15 September 1993, prohibiting the sale of weapons or fuel to UNITA.|$|E

40|$|In {{the last}} several decades, policy makers have paid {{increasing}} attention to issues of environmental justice – {{the idea that the}} health burdens and risks of poor air quality and proximity to hazards are inequitably distributed by race and income.

This shift in public sector attention has not been due to a sudden burst of goodwill on the part of regulators.
