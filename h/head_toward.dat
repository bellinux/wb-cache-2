5|$|The hero's {{story begins}} with a {{flashback}} dream {{of the death of}} his parents {{at the hands of the}} Dark Lord, the ruler of the nation of Granz. Upon waking, the hero, a gladiator-slave in Granz, attempts to escape before being confronted by the Dark Lord and thrown off of a bridge. After being fished out of a lake, the hero is advised to head to the city of Topple. The heroine's story also {{begins with a}} flashback dream of the Dark Lord and his assistant, Julius, killing her stepmother and destroying her village. Upon awaking, she is advised by the knight Bogard to head to Topple, while he journeys to the city of Wendell. The hero and heroine meet in Topple, and agree to journey together. They <b>head</b> <b>toward</b> Wendell, and along the way discover that women of the Mana tribe, which the heroine belongs to, are being kidnapped by vampires. The heroine is kidnapped, and is rescued by the hero and an unnamed man; they discover that the kidnappings are to keep the woman safe from the Dark Lord and Julius, who are killing them all in part because the tribe was unable to save the Dark Lord's mother from a terrible fate.|$|E
5|$|Lisa {{learns that}} Derek and Sharon {{will be going}} away from town for a few days, with Sharon leaving one {{afternoon}} and Derek the next day. While Sharon is {{on her way to}} pick up Kyle, she realizes she forgot to set the alarm system and returns home. Meanwhile, Lisa breaks into Derek and Sharon's house again and decorates the master bed with rose petals. While setting the alarm, Sharon hears Lisa in the bedroom. She confronts Lisa, who tries to convince her that Derek was seeing Lisa. However, Sharon sees through her lie and attempts to call the police, but Lisa tackles her to the floor, and the two engage in a fistfight. Derek calls the home phone and Lisa answers; he calls Detective Reese and they both <b>head</b> <b>toward</b> the house. Lisa runs to the attic and Sharon pursues her. Sharon leads her to a weak spot in the attic floor, where Lisa falls through. Seeing that Lisa is in mortal danger, Sharon reaches out in an attempt to grab Lisa and lift her up, but Lisa refuses and tries to pull Sharon down with her. Seeing that the floor is beginning to buckle, Sharon pries Lisa off of her arm. Lisa falls and smashes onto the glass table below. A chandelier falls from the ceiling onto Lisa, eventually killing her. Detective Reese arrives as Sharon comes out of the house. As soon as Detective Reese goes inside the house to investigate Lisa's actions, Derek soon arrives; he and Sharon then tearfully embrace one another.|$|E

25|$|Aids: The rider {{applies the}} outside leg {{slightly}} further back from its normal position, which activates the outside hind (the first {{beat of the}} intended lead). At the same time, he or she uses the outside rein to flex the horse's <b>head</b> <b>toward</b> the outside, which frees up the animal's inside shoulder, encouraging it to fall into that lead. If the rider were {{to ask for the}} left lead, for example, he or she would apply the right leg behind the girth and use the right rein to turn the horse's head to the right. To make the rider's intent even clearer, the horse may be angled slightly toward the outside rail of the arena, which will guide it into taking the correct lead as it goes towards the unobstructed inside, and also discourages the horse from simply running onto the forehand.|$|E
25|$|After leaving Carter County, US-70 {{enters the}} {{smallest}} of Oklahoma's 77 counties, Marshall County. After crossing the county line, the highway heads due east for , passing through Oakland and then entering the county seat, Madill. On {{the north side of}} the city, US-70 approaches a T intersection with US-177 and SH-199; this is the southern terminus of US-177. US-70 turns south, forming a concurrency with SH-199. The two highways <b>head</b> <b>toward</b> downtown Madill, where SH-199 splits off. At the same intersection, US-377/SH-99 join US-70 as it continues south through Madill, splitting away on the south edge of town. US-70 turns southeast, forming the northern terminus of SH-70F before reaching Kingston. There, US-70 intersects several highways at their termini—SH-32, SH-70B (a spur to Lake Texoma), and SH-70A (a spur to New Woodville and McBride). US-70 curves back to the east in Kingston, entering Lake Texoma State Park east of town and crossing the Washita River arm of the lake, which forms the eastern boundary of Marshall County.|$|E

MD 450 continues into the Colonial Annapolis Historic District as a municipally maintained street. The road surface changes to brick for the one block before the highway enters Church Circle, a traffic circle that circumscribes St. Anne's Church. The streets that emanate from the circle include Franklin Street, which leads to the Banneker-Douglass Museum; South Street, which passes the Old City Hall and Engine House; Duke of Gloucester Street and Main Street, a non-parallel pair of one-way streets that <b>head</b> <b>toward</b> and from the city's docks; School Street, which leads to State Circle, which is unsigned MD 797 and circumscribes the Maryland State House; Northwest Street, which enters the circle from the namesake direction; and College Avenue, onto which MD 450 continues.|$|E

500|$|Cyber Danganronpa VR is {{a virtual}} reality game in which the player plays through the fourth [...] "class trial" [...] from the {{adventure}} game , where the player aims to uncover who was behind the murder of Sakura Ogami; unlike the original game, which uses 2D cutouts for characters, Cyber Danganronpa VR uses 3D models. The player character's classmates give testimonies, which appear as words; if the player notices something in the testimony that seems suspicious, they can refute the words by shooting them with [...] "truth bullets". To do this, the player needs to turn their <b>head</b> <b>toward</b> the character who testified, and press {{a button on the}} DualShock 4 controller. The game takes around ten minutes to play through, and ends with a first-person sequence where the character Monokuma punishes the player.|$|E

500|$|In North Hudson, {{the valley}} becomes less {{pronounced}} as the Schroon River reaches its source near exit30. Here, US9 and I-87 cross paths again, {{with the former}} heading northwest toward Keene and the latter continuing northeast in a narrow valley formed by Ash Craft Brook. After , the stream reaches its source at Lincoln Pond, leaving the Northway to climb in elevation and wind its way northeastward across the surrounding mountains. It reaches slightly more level ground in Westport, where I-87 connects to NY9N at exit31. From here, the highway takes a generally northerly track across the Bouquet River {{to the town of}} Lewis, rejoining US9 as both roads <b>head</b> <b>toward</b> Clinton County. They split again after [...] as US9 veers more easterly than I-87 to serve Keeseville. The Northway, meanwhile, heads to the northwest, bypassing the village to cross the Ausable River and enter Clinton County.|$|E

500|$|One of the subplots of {{the novel}} details the budding love between Pitar and Maluma, a female member of the band. Costello {{perceives}} the group of females as his personal harem, but when Maluma {{falls in love with}} Pitar she breaks off her relationship with him. On each day, the characters discover new insights and artefacts, but seek rest from their exhaustion by the seventh day. This repose, however, is disrupted by the attack of a saber-toothed cat. Several members of the band are killed, including Costello, thus enabling Re to assume power. Pitar and Maluma decide to leave the band, stating, [...] "We should leave in time, leave Re and his new Reich, which, when I'm taking into account Thorn's previous reign, would be the Third over here."
