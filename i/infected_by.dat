5|$|Another Trojan in this wave, TorrentLocker, {{initially}} {{contained a}} design flaw comparable to CryptoDefense; it {{used the same}} keystream for every infected computer, making the encryption trivial to overcome. However, this flaw was later fixed.

In 1996, civil servants, nurses, and junior doctors went on strike over salary issues. The general health of the population also began to significantly decline; by 1997 an estimated 25% of the population had been <b>infected</b> <b>by</b> HIV in a pandemic that was affecting most of southern Africa.|$|E
5|$|For the actress, having Chloe {{become part}} of the meteor {{infected}} community in season six allowed Mack's character to continue to evolve. Mack views this transition as a means for her character to become more emotionally connected to those people—the meteor infected—she spent five seasons trying to expose to the public. Being <b>infected</b> <b>by</b> the meteors gives Chloe motivation to try to understand them and allows her to grow closer to Clark, as she can better understand {{what it feels like to}} live in a world where you have a special ability. Writer Holly Harold believes that, in addition to being <b>infected</b> <b>by</b> the meteor rocks, bringing Lois into the journalistic field also provides Chloe with a lot of ammunition for growth and development. Lois's presence at the Daily Planet allows Chloe the chance to reflect upon herself, and discover what things are most important to her – her career or her family and friends. The competition that Lois provides is beneficial, as it gives Chloe a chance to bring out the best in herself.|$|E
5|$|Kaspersky's {{interest}} in IT security began in 1989, when his PC was <b>infected</b> <b>by</b> the Cascade virus, {{while working for}} the Ministry of Defense. He studied how the virus worked and developed a program to remove it. Afterwards he continually found new viruses and developed software to remove them, as a hobby. Early on Kaspersky's anti-virus software had just 40 virus definitions and was distributed mostly to friends.|$|E

5|$|Oral {{transmission}} {{is an unusual}} route of infection, but has been described. In 1991, farm workers {{in the state of}} Paraíba, Brazil, were <b>infected</b> <b>by</b> eating contaminated food; transmission has also occurred via contaminated açaí palm fruit juice and garapa. A 2007 outbreak in 103 Venezuelan school children was attributed to contaminated guava juice.|$|E
5|$|The {{eradication}} campaign {{led to the}} death of Janet Parker (c.1938–1978) and the subsequent suicide of the smallpox expert Henry Bedson (1930–1978). Parker was an employee of the University of Birmingham who worked in the same building as Bedson's smallpox laboratory. She was <b>infected</b> <b>by</b> a strain of smallpox virus that Bedson's team had been investigating. Ashamed of the accident and having blamed himself for it, Bedson committed suicide.|$|E
5|$|The human {{immunodeficiency}} virus (HIV) is the virus that – when the infection is not treated – can cause AIDS (acquired immunodeficiency syndrome). Most virologists believe that HIV originated in sub-Saharan Africa during the 20th century, and over 70 million individuals have been <b>infected</b> <b>by</b> the virus. By 2011, an estimated 35 million had died from AIDS, {{making it one of}} the most destructive epidemics in recorded history.|$|E

5|$|The {{introduced}} snake Boa constrictor preys on O.couesi on Cozumel. Parasites {{recorded on}} O.couesi in Veracruz include unidentified ticks, mites, fleas, and fly larvae. The flea Polygenis odiosus {{was found on}} an Oryzomys couesi from Cozumel. Out of ten O.couesi in San Luis Potosí, five each were <b>infected</b> <b>by</b> the nematode worms Hassalstrongylus musculi and H.bocqueti, with about 25 worms per rat, and two were <b>infected</b> <b>by</b> one or two cestodes of the genus Raillietina. The mites Eubrachylaelaps circularis and Gigantolaelaps boneti have been found on Oryzomys couesi in Oaxaca, the sucking louse Hoplopleura oryzomydis in Nicaragua, the mites Laelaps oryzomydis, Echinonyssus microchelae, Ornithonyssus bacoti, Prolistrophorus frontalis, and Prolistrophorus bakeri in Colima, and the apicomplexan Eimeria couesii in Mexico. The species is <b>infected</b> <b>by</b> two hantaviruses—Catacamas virus in Honduras and Playa de Oro virus in western Mexico—which {{are related to the}} Bayou virus infecting the marsh rice rat, a common cause of hantavirus infections in the United States. No hantavirus infections in humans have been linked to O.couesi hantaviruses, however. Chiapas O.couesi easily survive experimental infection with several arboviruses, including the Venezuelan equine encephalitis virus, suggesting that the species may serve as a reservoir for that virus.|$|E
5|$|There {{are eight}} species of rotavirus, {{referred}} to as A, B, C, D, E, F, G, and H. Humans are primarily <b>infected</b> <b>by</b> species A, B and C, most commonly by species A. A–E species cause disease in other animals, species E and H in pigs, and D, F and G in birds.|$|E
5|$|There are six viral {{proteins}} (VPs) {{that form}} the virus particle (virion). These structural proteins are called VP1, VP2, VP3, VP4, VP6 and VP7. In addition to the VPs, there are six nonstructural proteins (NSPs), that are only produced in cells <b>infected</b> <b>by</b> rotavirus. These are called NSP1, NSP2, NSP3, NSP4, NSP5 and NSP6.|$|E
40|$|Leishmania major {{infection}} of macrophages {{is followed by}} a time-dependent appearance of lipophosphoglycan (LPG) that can be detected on the surface of <b>infected</b> cells <b>by</b> monoclonal antibodies. The origin of these LPG epitopes is probably the intracellular amastigote. LPG epitopes could be detected on the amastigote and the <b>infected</b> macrophage <b>by</b> a number of monoclonal antibodies directed to several distinct determinants on the phosphoglycan moiety. The macrophage-expressed LPG may be modified because, unlike the parasite LPG as expressed on promastigotes or amastigotes, it could not be radiolabeled by galactose oxidase or periodate treatment of <b>infected</b> cells followed <b>by</b> reduction with 3 H-labeled sodium borohydride. Some LPG epitopes displayed on the macrophage may be anchored with glycosylphosphatidylinositol, and some may be in the water-soluble phosphoglycan form bound to macrophage integrins involved in its specific recognition. The water-soluble population could be released from the <b>infected</b> macrophage <b>by</b> gentle protease treatment...|$|R

5|$|Viruses infect all {{cellular}} life and, although viruses occur universally, each cellular {{species has}} its own specific range that often infect only that species. Some viruses, called satellites, can replicate only within cells {{that have already been}} <b>infected</b> <b>by</b> another virus.|$|E
5|$|Viruses {{reproduce}} rapidly {{because they}} {{have only a few}} genes compared to humans who have 20,000–25,000. For example, influenza virus has only eight genes and rotavirus has eleven. These genes encode structural proteins that form the virus particle, or non-structural proteins, that are only found in cells <b>infected</b> <b>by</b> the virus.|$|E
5|$|A {{number of}} factors make people more {{susceptible}} to TB infections. The most important risk factor globally is HIV; 13% of all people with TB are <b>infected</b> <b>by</b> the virus. This is a particular problem in sub-Saharan Africa, where rates of HIV are high. Of people without HIV who are infected with tuberculosis, about 5–10% develop active disease during their lifetimes; in contrast, 30% of those coinfected with HIV develop the active disease.|$|E

5|$|According to a 2006 study, the Noronha skink is <b>infected</b> <b>by</b> several {{parasitic}} worms, {{most frequently}} by the nematode Spinicauda spinicauda. Another nematode, Moaciria alvarengai, is much rarer. Other rare parasites include two trematodes—Mesocoelium monas and an undetermined species of Platynossomum—and an undetermined species of Oochoristica, a cestode. S.spinicauda is usually only found in teiid lizards; {{it may have}} entered the archipelago when Tupinambis merianae, a teiid, {{was introduced to the}} island in 1960. Among nematodes, previous studies in 1956 and 1957 had only reported M.alvarengai and Thelandros alvarengai from the skink; the presence of S.spinicauda could explain the rarity of M.alvarengai and absence of T.alvarengai in Noronha skinks observed in 2006.|$|E
5|$|Bee-eaters may be infested {{by several}} blood-feeding flies {{of the genus}} Carnus, and the biting fly Ornithophila metallica. Other parasites include chewing lice of the genera Meromenopon, Brueeliaa and Meropoecus, {{some of which are}} {{specialist}} parasites of bee-eaters, and the stickfast flea Echidnophaga gallinacea. The hole-nesting lifestyle of bee-eaters means that they tend to carry a higher burden of external parasites than non-hole-nesting bird species. Bee-eaters may also be <b>infected</b> <b>by</b> protozoan blood parasites of the genus Haemoproteus including H. meropis.|$|E
