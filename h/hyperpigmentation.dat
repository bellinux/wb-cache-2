5|$|Hydroquinone lightens {{the skin}} when applied topically by {{inhibiting}} tyrosinase, the enzyme responsible for converting the amino acid tyrosine {{to the skin}} pigment melanin, and is used to treat acne-associated postinflammatory <b>hyperpigmentation.</b> By interfering with new production of melanin in the epidermis, hydroquinone leads to less <b>hyperpigmentation</b> as darkened skin cells are naturally shed over time. Improvement in skin <b>hyperpigmentation</b> is typically seen within six months when used twice daily. Hydroquinone is ineffective for <b>hyperpigmentation</b> affecting deeper layers of skin such as the dermis. The use of a sunscreen with SPF15 or higher {{in the morning with}} reapplication every two hours is recommended when using hydroquinone. Its application only to affected areas lowers the risk of lightening the color of normal skin but can lead to a temporary ring of lightened skin around the hyperpigmented area. Hydroquinone is generally well-tolerated; side effects are typically mild (e.g., skin irritation) and occur with use of a higher than the recommended 4% concentration. Most preparations contain the preservative sodium metabisulfite, which has been linked to rare cases of allergic reactions including anaphylaxis and severe asthma exacerbations in susceptible people. In extremely rare cases, repeated improper topical application of high-dose hydroquinone has been associated with an accumulation of homogentisic acid in connective tissues, a condition known as exogenous ochronosis.|$|E
5|$|Addison's disease {{refers to}} primary hypoadrenalism, {{which is a}} {{deficiency}} in glucocorticoid and mineralocorticoid production by the adrenal gland. In the Western world, Addison's disease is most commonly an autoimmune condition, in which the body produces antibodies against cells of the adrenal cortex. Worldwide, the disease is more frequently caused by infection, especially from tuberculosis. A distinctive feature of Addison's disease is <b>hyperpigmentation</b> of the skin, which presents with other nonspecific symptoms such as fatigue.|$|E
5|$|Retinoids are {{medications}} which reduce inflammation, normalize the {{follicle cell}} life cycle, and reduce sebum production. They are structurally related to vitamin A.

40|$|Introduction. {{dermatitis}} bullosa pratensis (phytophotodermatitis) is {{an acute}} phototoxic reaction caused by photosensitizing substances present in {{different kinds of}} plants, activated by ultraviolet radiation exposure. An acute phototoxic reaction manifests as erythema, vesicles and even blisters with morphology of burns. Objective. We present a case report of phytophotodermatitis due to Heracleum sosnowskyi. Heracleum sosnowskyi was discovered in 1772 and described as a separate species in botanical literature in 1944 by I. P. Mandenova. Case report. In our case, skin lesions coexisted with erythema multiforme. Implemented therapy – corticosteroids, antihistamines and topical medications – was successful. After clinical resolution post-inflammatory <b>hyperpigmentations</b> were observed. Conclusions.

5|$|The breed {{is prone}} to skin disorders. About a quarter of Westies {{surveyed}} are affected by atopic dermatitis, a heritable chronic allergic skin condition. A higher proportion of males are affected compared to females. An uncommon but severe breed-specific skin condition, hyperplastic dermatosis, may affect West Highland White Terriers, both juveniles and adults dogs. Affected dogs can suffer from red <b>hyperpigmentation,</b> lichenification, and hair loss. In the initial stages, this condition can be misdiagnosed as allergies or less serious forms of dermatitis.|$|E
5|$|Azelaic acid {{has been}} shown to be {{effective}} for mild to moderate acne when applied topically at a 20% concentration. Treatment twice daily for six months is necessary, and is as effective as topical benzoyl peroxide5%, isotretinoin0.05%, and erythromycin2%. Azelaic acid is thought to be an effective acne treatment due to its ability to reduce skin cell accumulation in the follicle, and its antibacterial and anti-inflammatory properties. It has a slight skin-lightening effect due to its ability to inhibit melanin synthesis, and is therefore useful in treating of individuals with acne who are also affected by postinflammatory <b>hyperpigmentation.</b> Azelaic acid may cause skin irritation but is otherwise very safe. It is less effective and more expensive than retinoids.|$|E

The differential diagnosis comprises different pigmented lesions, such as seborrheic keratosis, nevocellular nevus, lentigo, or <b>hyperpigmentations</b> of different origin. There is no typical histopathological pattern, but mostly melanomas of this site are of the mucosal-lentiginous type. As treatment modalities, most investigators propose a complete excision for melanomas thinner than 1 mm, and for thicker melanomas a wide excision. Recent investigations have shown that hemivulvectomies or vulvectomies do not show a better survival. The question of a prophylactic ipsilateral lymph node dissection is not answered yet. The survival rates depend on the tumor thickness and/or the infiltration level. The importance of an early diagnosis should be stressed in vulvar melanomas, especially through an accurate inspection of the vulva at the time of a genital examination.

40|$|Abstract Background Surveys {{that have}} been carried out to {{determine}} the prevalence of skin diseases in rural Yemen are scarce or not available. Objective To investigate the spectrum of winter dermatoses in a rural Yemeni community. Methods A retrospective study was conducted at the dermatology outpatient clinic of the Al-Helal Specialized Hospital (Radaa' district of Al Bayda' Governorate) using data analysis of 700 selected records of patients managed during four months of the 2013 – 14 winter season. Results Seven hundred patients with 730 diseases were reported in this study; the major bulk of patients (46. 57 %) were in the > 18 – 40 -year age group, and females outnumbered males. By far, dermatitis, eczematous, and allergic disorders (38. 49 %) topped the list of the most frequent skin disorders groups, followed by skin infections and infestations (20 %) and the pigmentary disorders (13. 70 %) group. Contact dermatitis (10. 68 %) was the most prevalent skin disorder, followed by <b>hyperpigmentations</b> (8. 77 %), acne (8. 08 %), viral infections (5. 75 %), atopic dermatitis (5. 62 %), and parasitic infestations (5. 34 %). Conclusion This survey has documented the spectrum of winter dermatoses in a rural Yemeni community but also reflects the pattern of common dermatoses in the whole country. Dermatitis, eczematous, and allergic disorders, skin infections, and pigmentary disorders are the commonest groups. Contact dermatitis is the most prevalent disorder, and leishmaniasis is the most prevalent skin infectious disease. Climate, occupational, social, and environmental factors are the main contributors. Such statistics can form an important basis for community-based health policies...|$|R
40|$|Aim To {{determine}} {{the frequency and}} the characteristics of cutaneous manifestations, especially vitiligo and alopecia areata, in patients with chronic graft-vs-host disease (cGVHD). Methods 50 patients with cGVHD were prospectively enrolled in the observational study protocol and evaluated by an experienced dermatologist. The evaluation {{was focused on the}} clinical spectrum of skin and adnexal involvement, and the cutaneous GVHD score was determined according to National Institutes of Health (NIH) Consensus criteria. The presence of vitiligo, alopecia, xerosis, nail changes, and dyspigmentation was also assessed. Results Out of 50 cGVHD patients, 28 (56 %) had skin involvement, and 27 of them (96 %) had hypo and/or <b>hyperpigmentations.</b> 11 patients (39 %) had a mild cutaneous NIH cGVHD score, 22 % moderate, and 39 % severe. 15 (30 %) patients had nail changes and 10 (20 %) had vitiligo or alopecia areata. Univariate analysis showed that patients with vitiligo/ alopecia areata received more lines of prior systemic immunosuppressive therapy (P = 0. 043), had lower Karnofsky performance status (P = 0. 028), and had a higher B-cell number (P = 0. 005), platelet count (P = 0. 022), and total protein (P = 0. 024). Vitiligo and alopecia areata were associated with higher NIH skin score (P = 0. 001), higher intensity of immunosuppressive treatment (P = 0. 020), and total body irradiation conditioning (P = 0. 040). Multivariate regression model showed that patients with higher NIH skin scoring were 3. 67 {{times more likely to have}} alopecia and/or vitiligo (odds ratio 3. 67; 95 % confidence interval 1. 26 - 10. 73), controlled for all other factors in the model (age at study entry, number of B-cells, platelet count, and global NIH score).

40|$|Background. Congenital and {{acquired}} vascular lesions {{of the skin}} and subcutis are a common health problem from aesthetic and also from psycho-social point of view. However, recent advances in laser technology have enabled an efficient and safe treatment. This study presents our experience with treatment of cutaneous vascular lesions using modern laser systems. Most common benign cutaneous vascular lesions are described. Patients and methods. In years 2002 and 2003, 109 patients, 4 to 80 (mean 39) years old, Fitzpatrick skin type 1 – 4, with 210 benign cutaneous vascular lesions were treated using the Dualis VP® laser system (Fotona, Slovenia) which incorporates the KTP and Nd:YAG lasers. Vascular lesions in the upper layers of the skin with diameter up to 1  mm were treated with the KTP laser (wavelength 532 nm). For larger vessels in deeper layer we used the Nd:YAG laser (wavelength 1064 nm). Patients graded the pain during treatment {{on a scale of}} 1 – 10. Clinical outcomes were evaluated 1 – 3 months after the last treatment: according to the percentage of clearance of the lesion compared to the adjacent normal skin and for the presence of adverse effects. According to these criteria each lesion was assigned a score: poor (0 – 25 %), fair (26 – 50 %), good (51 – 75 %), excellent (76 – 100 %). Results. Immediate response after application of a laser beam with proper characteristics was whitish-grey discoloration of treated area. Treatment results after 1 – 3 months were excellent in 48. 1 %, good 40. 9 %, fair in 8. 6 % and poor in 2. 4 %. Patients without prior anaesthesia graded pain during treatment from 1 to 8 (mean 4. 0) and patients with EMLA® anaesthesia from 1 to 6 (mean 2. 6). Side effects were frequent but minimal and transient. Erythema disappeared in several days after treatment while crusting persisted for 14 days. 3 permanent <b>hyperpigmentations,</b> 2 permanent hypopigmentations, 2 hypertrophic scars and 1 beam sized atrophic scar were detected at last follow-up visit. Conclusions. In addition to clinical experience and correct diagnosis of the lesion, at least two lasers with different wavelengths are necessary for safe and efficient treatment of various cutaneous vascular lesions. The combination of the KTP (532 nm) and Nd: YAG (1064 nm) lasers incorporated in the Dualis VP® system offers great possibilities for treatment of various vascular anomalies on face, lower limbs, as well as other regions. </p...|$|R

500|$|Postinflammatory <b>hyperpigmentation</b> (PIH) {{is usually}} the result of nodular acne lesions. These lesions often leave behind an {{inflamed}} darkened mark after the original acne lesion has resolved. This inflammation stimulates specialized pigment-producing skin cells (known as melanocytes) to produce more melanin pigment {{which leads to the}} skin's darkened appearance. People with darker skin color are more frequently affected by this condition. Pigmented scar is a common term used for PIH, but is misleading as it suggests the color change is permanent. Often, PIH can be prevented by avoiding any aggravation of the nodule, and can fade with time. However, untreated PIH can last for months, years, or even be permanent if deeper layers of skin are affected. [...] Even minimal skin exposure to the sun's ultraviolet rays can sustain <b>hyperpigmentation.</b> Daily use of SPF15 or higher sunscreen can minimize such a risk.|$|E
500|$|In Pomeranians, a {{condition}} often called [...] "black skin disease" [...] occurs {{which is a}} combination of alopecia (hair loss) and <b>hyperpigmentation</b> (a darkening of the skin). Other names for this condition include woolly coat, coat funk, pseudo-Cushing's disease, or severe hair loss syndrome. This condition affects male Pomeranians more than females, and may be inherited. Although most affected dogs show signs following puberty, it can occur at any age. Other conditions can mimic this condition including Cushing's syndrome, hypothyroidism, chronic skin infections, and reproductive hormone disorders.|$|E
500|$|Microneedling is a {{procedure}} {{in which an}} instrument with multiple rows of tiny needles is rolled over the skin to elicit a wound healing response and stimulate collagen production to reduce the appearance of atrophic acne scars in people with darker skin color. Notable adverse effects of microneedling include postinflammatory <b>hyperpigmentation</b> and tram track scarring (described as discrete slightly raised scars in a linear distribution similar to a tram track). The latter {{is thought to be}} primarily attributable to improper technique by the practitioner, including the use of excessive pressure or inappropriately large needles.|$|E
500|$|Adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) {{deficiency}} {{leads to}} adrenal insufficiency, {{a lack of}} production of glucocorticoids such as cortisol by the adrenal gland. If the problem is chronic, symptoms consist of fatigue, weight loss, failure to thrive (in children), delayed puberty (in adolescents), hypoglycemia (low blood sugar levels), anemia and hyponatremia (low sodium levels). If the onset is abrupt, collapse, shock and vomiting may occur. [...] ACTH deficiency is highly similar to primary Addison's disease, which is cortisol deficiency {{as the result of}} direct damage to the adrenal glands; the latter form, however, often leads to <b>hyperpigmentation</b> of the skin, which does not occur in ACTH deficiency.|$|E
500|$|Light {{therapy is}} a {{treatment}} method that involves delivering certain specific wavelengths {{of light to}} an area of skin affected by acne. Both regular and laser light have been used. [...] When regular light is used immediately following {{the application of a}} sensitizing substance to the skin such as aminolevulinic acid or methyl aminolevulinate, the treatment is referred to as photodynamic therapy (PDT). PDT has the most supporting evidence of all light therapies. Many different types of nonablative lasers (i.e., lasers that do not vaporize the top layer of the skin but rather induce a physiologic response in the skin from the light) have been used to treat acne, including those that use infrared wavelengths of light. Ablative lasers (such as CO2 and fractional types) have also been used to treat active acne and its scars. When ablative lasers are used, the treatment {{is often referred to as}} laser resurfacing because, as mentioned previously, the entire upper layers of the skin are vaporized. Ablative lasers are associated with higher rates of adverse effects compared with nonablative lasers, with examples being postinflammatory <b>hyperpigmentation,</b> persistent facial redness, and persistent pain. Physiologically, certain wavelengths of light, used with or without accompanying topical chemicals, are thought to kill bacteria and decrease the size and activity of the glands that produce sebum. [...] As of 2012, evidence for various light therapies was insufficient to recommend them for routine use. Disadvantages of light therapy can include its cost, the need for multiple visits, time required to complete the procedure(s), and pain associated with some of the treatment modalities. [...] Various light therapies appear to provide a short-term benefit, but data for long-term outcomes, and for outcomes in those with severe acne, are sparse; it may have a role for individuals whose acne has been resistant to topical medications. Typical side effects include skin peeling, temporary reddening of the skin, swelling, and postinflammatory <b>hyperpigmentation.</b>|$|E
