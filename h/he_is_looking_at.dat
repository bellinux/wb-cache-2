In a departure from series routine, Gervais and Merchant were not present on set for much of filming, though episode writers had typically been available in the past. Actress Kate Flannery found the episode [...] "a {{lot of fun to}} shoot," [...] and observed that on the occasions Gervais was present, [...] "it seems to me like <b>he</b> <b>is</b> <b>looking</b> <b>at</b> all of us with a sense of, 'I can't believe that this exists because of me.' That is just my interpretation, but he seems so humble, and kind of reverent." [...] One scene was meant to take place outdoors under cold temperatures, so the parking lot set was laden with fake snow and slush. Also present on set were two sets of twin babies, as the character of Hannah Smotridge-Barr brings her son to the office.|$|E
2500|$|The first sound {{adaptation}} of the play was in 1929; Sam Taylor's The Taming of the Shrew, starring Mary Pickford and Douglas Fairbanks (the first sound {{adaptation of}} any Shakespeare play). This version was simultaneously shot as a silent film, and, depending on whether a given theatre was equipped to screen sound films, was released both as a [...] "talkie" [...] and a silent. Using only 500 lines from the original play, and a few lines from David Garrick's 1754 adaptation of Shrew, Catharine and Petruchio, the film is primarily known for how Pickford delivers Katherina's last speech. As she moves though the litany of reasons why a woman should obey her husband, she winks toward Bianca (Dorothea Jordan), unseen by Petruchio. Bianca smiles in silent communication with Katherina, thus acknowledging that Katherina has not been tamed at all. The film opens with a Punch and Judy puppet show which several critics have argued performs a similar function to the Christopher Sly Induction in the original play, but also works to instill a sense of false anticipation in the audience; the puppet show ends with Judy sinking lovingly into Punch's arms after he beats her. In the film, Katherina never sinks into Petruchio's arms. Indeed, Pickford's Katherina is much more resistant than in many stage versions; there is an extended scene of her wrecking Baptista's home, she only agrees to marry Petruchio when he stands on her foot and her scream is taken by the priest as consent, when she falls in the mud {{on the way to}} Petruchio's house, he offers to help but she refuses, she rejects meat at the dinner table rather than being tempted by it. Most significantly, when Petruchio outlines his plan to tame her [...] "with kindness" [...] (4.1.195), which is usually a soliloquy, Katherina hears him. She then proceeds to 'out-tame' him; when he messes up the bed clothes, she overturns the entire mattress, sparking a game of one-upmanship which ends when she flings a stool at him and knocks him out. The conversation about the sun and moon, so often seen as a pivotal turning point in the taming is then delivered with a befuddled Petruchio apparently genuinely unsure whether <b>he</b> <b>is</b> <b>looking</b> <b>at</b> the sun or the moon, and a worried Katherina trying to placate him. This is immediately followed by her 'submission' speech, and her wink. Elizabeth Schafer believes this is a Katherina that has not been tamed; [...] "unlike Shakespeare's Katherina, Pickford's Katherina knows what Petruchio is trying to do in taming her and she responds to this tactically and successfully. Her surpassing of Petruchio's outrageous behaviour leaves him nonplussed and concussed." [...] However, Pickford herself was unhappy with the film, and with how Taylor had directed her. In her autobiography, she wrote she wanted to play Katherina as a ferocious woman, but Taylor told her [...] "We don't want any of that heavy stage drama; we want the old Pickford tricks." [...] Pickford said of her performance, [...] "Instead of being a forceful tiger-cat, I was a spitting little kitten." ...|$|E

60|$|There are a {{great many}} bonds which still connect us with Charles II., one of the idlest men {{of one of the}} idlest epochs. Among other things Charles II. {{represented}} one thing which is very rare and very satisfying; he was a real and consistent sceptic. Scepticism both in its advantages and disadvantages is greatly misunderstood in our time. There is a curious idea abroad that scepticism has some connection with such theories as materialism and atheism and secularism. This is of course a mistake; the true sceptic {{has nothing to do with}} these theories simply because they are theories. The true sceptic is as much a spiritualist as he is a materialist. He thinks that the savage dancing round an African idol stands quite as good a chance of being right as Darwin. He thinks that mysticism is every bit as rational as rationalism. He has indeed the most profound doubts as to whether St Matthew wrote his own gospel. But he has quite equally profound doubts as to whether the tree <b>he</b> <b>is</b> <b>looking</b> <b>at</b> is a tree and not a rhinoceros.|$|E
6000|$|... "When you say 'us,'" [...] {{replied the}} Minor Poet, [...] "I presume you are {{referring}} to the one person in half a million to whom Art is {{anything more than a}} name. Dismissing the countless hordes who have absolutely never heard the word, and confining attention to the few thousands scattered about Europe and America who prate of it, how many of even these do you think it really influences, entering into their lives, refining, broadening them? Watch the faces of the thin but conscientious crowd streaming wearily through our miles of picture galleries and art museums; gaping, with guide-book in hand, at ruined temple or cathedral tower; striving, with the spirit of the martyr, to feel enthusiasm for Old Masters at which, left to themselves, they would enjoy a good laugh--for chipped statues which, uninstructed, they would have mistaken for the damaged stock of a suburban tea-garden. Not more than one in twelve enjoys what <b>he</b> <b>is</b> <b>looking</b> <b>at,</b> and he by no means is bound to be the best of the dozen. Nero was a genuine lover of Art; and in modern times August the Strong, of Saxony, 'the man of sin,' as Carlyle calls him, has left undeniable proof behind him that he was a connoisseur of the first water. One recalls names even still more recent. Are we so sure that Art does elevate?" ...|$|E
6000|$|Of {{which the}} {{immediate}} and evident deduction is that tyrants are as much the sons of God as Garibaldis; and that King Bomba of Naples having, with the utmost success, [...] "found himself" [...] is identical with the ultimate good in all things. The {{truth is that the}} western energy that dethrones tyrants has been directly due to the western theology that says [...] "I am I, thou art thou." [...] The same spiritual separation which looked up and saw a good king in the universe looked up and saw a bad king in Naples. The worshippers of Bomba's god dethroned Bomba. The worshippers of Swinburne's god have covered Asia for centuries and have never dethroned a tyrant. The Indian saint may reasonably shut his eyes because <b>he</b> <b>is</b> <b>looking</b> <b>at</b> that which is I and Thou and We and They and It. It is a rational occupation: but it is not true in theory and not true in fact that it helps the Indian {{to keep an eye on}} Lord Curzon. That external vigilance which has always been the mark of Christianity (the command that we should WATCH and pray) has expressed itself both in typical western orthodoxy and in typical western politics: but both depend on the idea of a divinity transcendent, different from ourselves, a deity that disappears. Certainly the most sagacious creeds may suggest that we should pursue God into deeper and deeper rings of the labyrinth of our own ego. But only we of Christendom have said that we should hunt God like an eagle upon the mountains: and we have killed all monsters in the chase.|$|E
