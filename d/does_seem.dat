5|$|Richard Romanus as Vinnie Genzianna, {{leader of}} the Stompers. A cool, stylish young man. Though he {{definitely}} has his problems, he <b>does</b> <b>seem</b> to care about those he is close to and at least tries {{to be strong and}} respectful.|$|E
5|$|The overall {{theme of}} the song puts me {{in the mind of}} a hit from R group Bell Biv Devoe circa 1990 that was also titled Poison, but doesn't fair the {{potential}} to be a number one song like it did close to 20 years ago. Even though the song doesn't seem like it would be a chart topper it <b>does</b> <b>seem</b> album worthy. It's something most can relate to if you've ever been in a relationship. Beyonce sings about a failed relationship that's no good, but yet is so hard to walk away from and ends up being just like Poison.|$|E
5|$|Olfactory {{navigation}} {{has been}} suggested as a possible mechanism in pigeons. Papi's 'mosaic' model argues that pigeons build and remember a mental map of the odours in their area, recognizing where they are by the local odour. Wallraff's 'gradient' model argues {{that there is a}} steady, large-scale gradient of odour which remains stable for long periods. If there were two or more such gradients in different directions, pigeons could locate themselves in two dimensions by the intensities of the odours. However {{it is not clear that}} such stable gradients exist. Papi did find evidence that anosmic pigeons (unable to detect odours) were much less able to orient and navigate than normal pigeons, so olfaction <b>does</b> <b>seem</b> to be important in pigeon navigation. However, it is not clear how olfactory cues are used.|$|E

5|$|There are controlled-release {{versions}} of levodopa. Older controlled-release levodopa preparations have poor and unreliable absorption and bioavailability {{and have not}} demonstrated improved control of PD motor symptoms or a reduction in levodopa-related complications when compared to immediate release preparations. A newer extended-release levodopa preparation <b>does</b> <b>seem</b> {{to be more effective}} in reducing fluctuations but in many patients problems persist. Intestinal infusions of levodopa (Duodopa) can result in striking improvements in fluctuations compared to oral levodopa when the fluctuations are due to insufficient uptake caused by gastroparesis. Other oral, longer acting formulations are under study and other modes of delivery (inhaled, transdermal) are being developed.|$|E
5|$|Although {{the advent}} of {{anatomical}} physical modernity cannot confidently be linked with palaeoneurological change, it <b>does</b> <b>seem</b> probable that hominid brains evolved through the same selection processes as other body parts. Genes that promoted a capacity for symbolism may have been selected for, suggesting that the foundations for symbolic culture may well be grounded in biology. However, behavior that was mediated by symbolism may have only come later, even though this physical capacity was already in place much earlier. Skoyles and Sagan, for example, argue that human brain expansion by increasing the prefrontal cortex would have created a brain capable of symbolizing its previously non-symbolic cognition, and that this process, slow to begin with, increasingly accelerated during the last 100,000 years. Symbolically mediated behavior may then feed back upon this process by creating a greater ability to manufacture symbolic artifacts and social networks. According to the research team in Jebel Irhoud, the discovery means that Homo sapiens — not members of a rival or ancestor species (Homo heidelbergensis, Homo naledi) — {{were the ones who}} left behind Middle Stone Age hand tools that have since been unearthed all over Africa.|$|E
5|$|In {{the heart}} of lungfish, the septum extends part-way into the ventricle. This allows for some degree of {{separation}} between the de-oxygenated bloodstream destined for the lungs and the oxygenated stream that is delivered {{to the rest of}} the body. The absence of such a division in living amphibian species may be partly due to the amount of respiration that occurs through the skin; thus, the blood returned to the heart through the venae cavae is already partially oxygenated. As a result, there may be less need for a finer division between the two bloodstreams than in lungfish or other tetrapods. Nonetheless, in at least some species of amphibian, the spongy nature of the ventricle <b>does</b> <b>seem</b> to maintain more of a separation between the bloodstreams. Also, the original valves of the conus arteriosus have been replaced by a spiral valve that divides it into two parallel parts, thereby helping to keep the two bloodstreams separate.|$|E

25|$|What <b>does</b> <b>seem</b> {{nowadays}} proved is {{that the}} British troops who had landed on the South Mole area raised their flag to signal their presence to the ships, and avoid being fired upon by their own side.|$|E
25|$|Today {{her music}} is seldom performed. Her {{keyboard}} music, while often technically challenging, {{is said to}} have been somewhat hackneyed and not distinctive. Her work <b>does</b> <b>seem</b> to have matured throughout her career; her early works are simple and clean, while her later works are more virtuosic, complex, and melodramatic.|$|E
25|$|Most {{historians are}} agreed {{that there was}} no romance involved, and that dynastic {{politics}} were {{at the base of the}} dispute. However, it <b>does</b> <b>seem</b> that Tigernán held the grudge, insisting on claiming legal compensation of 100 ounces of gold from Diarmait in 1167, which was enforced by Ruaidri Ua Conchobair.|$|E

25|$|Certain {{learning}} and memory functions are impaired by centrally administered oxytocin. Also, systemic oxytocin administration can impair memory retrieval in certain aversive memory tasks. However, oxytocin <b>does</b> <b>seem</b> to facilitate {{learning and}} memory specifically for social information. Healthy males administered intranasal oxytocin show improved memory for human faces, in particular happy faces.|$|E
25|$|In {{a review}} of the role of {{distributional}} learning on phonological acquisition, Werker et al. note that distributional learning cannot be the only mechanism by which phonetic categories are acquired. However, it <b>does</b> <b>seem</b> clear that this type of statistical learning mechanism can play a role in this skill, although research is ongoing.|$|E
25|$|Tombs 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 {{dated to}} the Middle Classic, 6,7, to the {{transition}} between the Late and Middle Classic, 8, 9 and 10 {{belong to the}} late Classic and 11 is preliminarily dated to the terminal classic. There are no foreign burials, and the only burials that aren’t of males are of undetermined sex. It <b>does</b> <b>seem</b> however that these burials were only of those of high status.|$|E

25|$|With the {{repetition}} of responsibility to the desperation of the lower class, Plautus establishes himself firmly {{on the side of}} the average Roman citizen. While he makes no specific reference to the possible war with Greece or the previous war (that might be too dangerous), he <b>does</b> <b>seem</b> to push the message that the government should take care of its own people before attempting any other military actions.|$|E
25|$|In {{his current}} incarnation, Krypto's {{abilities}} are essentially identical; however, he possesses normal canine intelligence, though {{as shown in}} the storyline with Atlas, Krypto <b>does</b> <b>seem</b> to have a general understanding of speech, and can take initiatives of his own, such as vowing to protect Metropolis from Atlas because of his knowledge of the fact that Superman himself protects and cares for the city, as well as vowing to hurt Atlas for hurting Superman.|$|E
25|$|Rather {{than the}} formal definition, {{it is more}} {{understandable}} with some historical context. The British generally seemed to be most consistent between theory and practice, although the minimum-effort theory, which worked in Malaya, {{did not seem to}} apply to Northern Ireland. French doctrine {{at the turn of the}} 20th century, involving working with locals, did not seem to be the heart of doctrine in Algeria and Indochina. France <b>does</b> <b>seem</b> to manage cooperation with former colonies, now clients.|$|E

25|$|Jinx {{returns in}} the 2004 direct-to-video {{animated}} film , voiced by Venus Terzo. Her original background with the Blind Master is not mentioned, instead she is training along with Kamakura under Snake Eyes, and likes to rib Kamakura for his lesser experience. Because {{of the nature}} of the movie, it is hard to determine if she is an apprentice for the first time, or is learning a new level of skills, as she <b>does</b> <b>seem</b> to be a very seasoned ninja.|$|E
25|$|Count Dracula (1970), {{directed}} by Jesus Franco starring Christopher Lee as Dracula. In {{spite of its}} star, Franco's film is {{not a part of}} the Hammer series, and was shot on a small budget. Lee is made up to look like the description of the Count from Stoker's novel, and he <b>does</b> <b>seem</b> to grow younger as the story progresses, but the film otherwise takes some huge liberties with the plot. The international cast includes Herbert Lom as Van Helsing and Klaus Kinski as Renfield.|$|E
25|$|These snakes produce {{cytotoxic}} venom that {{is strongly}} hemorrhagic and tissue toxic, but {{devoid of any}} neurotoxins (Ernst, 1992; Van Mierop, 1976). The venom was basis {{for the development of}} the drug eptifibatide which is used to prevent clotting during a heart attack. The venom is somewhat different in that it contains substantial amounts of serotonin and related tryptamine compounds (Welsh, 1967). Antivenin does not appear to be effective in the treatment of these bites, although CroFab <b>does</b> <b>seem</b> to do a better job than ACP, at least in some animal models. (Consroe et al., 1995).|$|E
