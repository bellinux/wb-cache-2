Stephen Travers offered, [...] "We believe the only conclusion possible arising from the HET report <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> most prolific loyalist murderers of the conflict was an RUC Special Branch agent and was involved in the Miami Showband attack".|$|E
500|$|Dynamic DNA {{nanotechnology}} uses {{a mechanism}} called toehold-mediated strand displacement {{to allow the}} nucleic acid complexes to reconfigure {{in response to the}} addition of a new nucleic acid strand. [...] In this reaction, the incoming strand binds to a single-stranded toehold region of a double-stranded complex, and then displaces one of the strands bound in the original complex through a branch migration process. The overall effect <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> strands in the complex is replaced with another one. [...] In addition, reconfigurable structures and devices can be made using functional nucleic acids such as deoxyribozymes and ribozymes, which can perform chemical reactions, and aptamers, which can bind to specific proteins or small molecules.|$|E

500|$|The view {{of modern}} historians <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> most {{important}} effects was the strain it {{put on the}} relationship between Rome and Byzantium.

500|$|It had {{not been}} thought {{necessary}} to inscribe the word [...] "cents" [...] on the nickel; the silver and copper-nickel three-cent pieces had circulated for years with only a Roman numeral to indicate the denomination. [...] Enterprising fraudsters soon realized that the new nickel was close in diameter {{to that of the}} five-dollar gold piece, and if the new coin was gold-plated, it might be passed for five dollars. [...] They soon did so, and had success in passing the coin. Some coins were given a reeded edge by the fraudsters, to make them appear more like the gold coins. [...] A widespread tale <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> perpetrators of this fraud was a man named Josh Tatum, who would go into a store, select an item costing five cents or less, and offer the gold-plated piece in payment—and many clerks gave him $4.95 in change. [...] According to the tale, the law had no recourse against Tatum, as he had tendered the value of his purchase and had merely accepted the change as a gift. By some accounts, Tatum could not have misrepresented the value of the coin as he was a deaf-mute.|$|E

2500|$|The {{assignment}} of orientational symbols to physical quantities and {{the requirement that}} physical equations be orientationally homogeneous can actually {{be used in a}} way that is similar to dimensional analysis to derive a little more information about acceptable solutions of physical problems. [...] In this approach one sets up the dimensional equation and solves it as far as one can. [...] If the lowest power of a physical variable is fractional, both sides of the solution is raised to a power such that all powers are integral. [...] This puts it into [...] "normal form". [...] The orientational equation is then solved to give a more restrictive condition on the unknown powers of the orientational symbols, arriving at a solution that is more complete than the one that dimensional analysis alone gives. Often the added information <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> powers of a certain variable is even or odd.|$|E

The neck was taken off and left to settle, and was eventually reunited with the Strat after returning to its correct shape. Other quirks include a 'hump' in the scratch plate which moves the neck pick-up closer to the neck on the bass side, and a replacement of all of the pick-ups, though this replacement was due to damage rather than the perception of a tonal inadequacy. One final point of interest <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> clay double-dot inlays at the 12th fret fell out and was replaced with a plastic one, which is why it is whiter than the other clay inlays.

2500|$|... "A Copy of Verses" [...] {{contains}} a few statements, such as Every's declaration {{to have been}} [...] "part-owner" [...] to land near Plymouth, that were later corroborated by William Philips, the captured crew member with whom Every had once shared information. Despite this, it is unlikely Every wrote the verses. A more likely scenario <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> approximately fifteen or twenty loyal sailors who refused to join the mutiny had shared their knowledge of Every upon returning to England, where it was quickly turned into a ballad. A slightly modified copy was delivered to the Privy Council of England by Sir James Houblon on 10 August 1694, where it was used as evidence during the inquiry on the mutiny. By announcing Every's supposed intentions of turning pirate even before the mutiny was carried out, the ballad may have served to strengthen the Council's convictions that the mutinous crew harbored piratical intentions from the onset. It is possible, therefore, that the ballad may have actually been written and distributed {{as a way to}} convict Every. In any case, the strength of the ballad likely {{played a role in the}} government's outlawing of Every nearly two years before he had become known as the most infamous pirate of his time.|$|E
