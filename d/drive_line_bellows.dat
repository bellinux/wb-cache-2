40|$|Abstract. <b>Drive</b> <b>line</b> is {{the surface}} defect on the {{automotive}} panel. In order {{to investigate the}} causes and control methods of the <b>drive</b> <b>line,</b> the box-shaped part with curved bottom was designed based on the shape characteristics of automobile panel. Then this part was taken as an experimental model to analyze the causes and forming process of the <b>drive</b> <b>line</b> on its surface. Finally, influencing laws on the <b>drive</b> <b>line</b> from the draw bead, the important forming process parameter, were obtained by the experiments. The {{results showed that the}} draw bead has great impact on the <b>drive</b> <b>line.</b> Different setting ways of the draw beads can make good control for the formation, displacement and its direction of the <b>drive</b> <b>line.</b> Besides, it is an important way for setting the draw beads properly to prevent the stamping parts from the formation of the <b>drive</b> <b>line...</b>|$|R
50|$|Pressure {{created by}} pumps or gravity {{is used to}} move fluids through the piping system. Fluids under {{pressure}} occupy the volume of their container. The unique concept of pressure balanced expansion joints is {{they are designed to}} maintain a constant volume by having balancing bellows compensate for volume changes in the <b>bellows</b> (<b>line</b> <b>bellows)</b> which is moved by the pipe. An early name for these devices was “pressure-volumetric compensator”.|$|R

40|$|The 'hydrid' is {{a fairly}} new serial {{hydraulic}} hybrid <b>drive</b> <b>line</b> concept. The term ‘hydrid’ is used for hydraulic <b>drive</b> <b>lines</b> in which four constant displacement Floating Cup (FC) wheel drive units are pressure controlled by means of two Innas Hydraulic Transformers (IHT). It {{has been shown in}} earlier publications that a four wheel <b>drive</b> hydrid <b>drive</b> <b>line</b> with wheel hub motors realises reductions of fuel consumption and CO 2 emission of more than 50 %. In modern passenger cars, there is a large gap between - on one hand - the engine power and wheel torque necessary to fulfil the maximum performance requirements and - on the other hand - the quite modest power and torque demand in normal, every-day use. This gap is the main reason for the rather bad energy efficiency of modern passenger cars. Contrary to other hybrid concepts, the hydrid can bridge this gap and achieve large reductions without compromising performance. This paper shows how the use of floating cup technology, the pressure amplification capability of the Innas hydraulic transformer (IHT) and a four wheel <b>drive</b> <b>line</b> topology, come together to realise this. After that a serial hydrid front wheel <b>drive</b> <b>line</b> is presented, which can realise similar reductions but uses only one IHT and two FC drive units, which attach to the front axle differential. Finally, some ideas for other serial hydrid <b>drive</b> <b>lines</b> are given...|$|R

5000|$|The {{most famous}} pogo {{oscillation}} {{was in the}} Saturn V first stage, S-IC, on the flight of Apollo 6 caused by the cruciform thrust structure. This structure was an [...] "X" [...] of two I-beams, with an engine {{on the end of}} each beam and the center engine at the intersection of the beams. The center of the cruciform was unsupported, so the central F-1 engine caused the structure to bend upwards. The pogo oscillation occurred when this structure sprang back, lengthening the center engine's fuel <b>line</b> <b>bellows</b> (which was mounted {{down the center of the}} cruciform), temporarily reducing the fuel flow and thus reducing thrust. At the other end of the oscillation, the fuel line was compressed, increasing fuel flow. This caused a sinusoidal thrust oscillation during the first stage ascent.|$|R
