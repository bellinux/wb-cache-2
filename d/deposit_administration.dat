The proposed study uses data envelopment analysis (DEA) for measuring {{the relative}} efficiency of 17 units. The results indicate that five units were efficient and using Technique for Order of Preference by Similarity to Ideal Solution (TOPSIS), the efficient units are ranked based on some inputs/outputs. The {{results of this study}} indicate that most branches of this financial unit performed poorly and a restructure in their businesses is necessary. In addition, the study has provided some evidences that considering employee wage, bank <b>deposit</b> and <b>administration</b> expenses as inputs for DEA implementation seems to provide better results than using total assets and equities...|$|R

40|$|We {{describe}} the multigram synthesis and in vivo efficacy studies of a donepezil‒huprine hybrid {{that has been}} found to display a promising in vitro multitarget profile of interest for the treatment of Alzheimer’s disease (AD). Its synthesis features as the key step a novel multigram preparative chromatographic resolution of intermediate racemic huprine Y by chiral HPLC. Administration of this compound to transgenic CL 4176 and CL 2006 Caenorhabditis elegans strains expressing human Aβ 42, here used as simplified animal models of AD, led to a significant protection from the toxicity induced by Aβ 42. However, this protective effect was not accompanied, in CL 2006 worms, by a reduction of amyloid <b>deposits.</b> Oral <b>administration</b> for 3 months to transgenic APPSL mice, a well-established animal model of AD, improved short-term memory, but did not alter brain levels of Aβ peptides nor cortical and hippocampal amyloid plaque load. Despite the clear protective and cognitive effects of AVCRI 104 P 4, the lack of Aβ lowering effect in vivo might be related to its lower in vitro potency toward Aβ aggregation and formation as compared with its higher anticholinesterase activities. Further lead optimization in this series should thus focus on improving the anti-amyloid/anticholinesterase activity ratio...|$|R
40|$|To whom {{correspondence}} {{should be}} addressed Tissue <b>deposits</b> occur after <b>administration</b> of plasma substitutes. After hydroxyethyl starch (HES), deposits may last for months, causing pruritus and impairment of function. Because elimination of HES deposits has not been demonstrated in humans, we studied 26 patients, for up to 7 yr after HES administration, to assess HES storage. HES dose ranged from 0. 34 to 15. 00 g kg– 1 body weight, and administration intervals from 1 day to 7 yr. Biopsies of the liver, muscle, spleen, intestine or skin were studied using light and electron microscopy and immunohistochemistry. HES storage was dose-dependent, decreased in all organs with time and was greater in patients suffering from pruritus. We conclude that tissue deposition of HES is transitory and dose-dependent, with differences between subjects in severity and duration...|$|R

40|$|The {{capacity}} of monoclonal anti-DNA antibodies, derived spontaneously from MRL-lpr/lpr mice, to bind directly to intrinsic glomerular antigens and form immune deposits was evaluated. Two antibodies, H 130 (IgM-kappa) and H 241 (IgG 2 a-kappa), bound to normal glomeruli in vitro. This binding was not inhibited by DNAase, but it was, {{in the case}} of H 130, inhibited by the anti-idiotype anti-H 130. Both antibodies also bound to glomerular digests on nitrocellulose. After i. v. injection, however, H 241 bound to glomeruli and formed glomerular immune deposits, whereas H 130 did not. Similarly, after i. p. injection of H 241 hybridomas to normal mice, all mice developed glomerular immune <b>deposits.</b> In contrast, <b>administration</b> of H 130 hybridomas, other anti-DNA-producing hybridomas, and other unrelated hybridomas did not lead to glomerular immune deposit formation. We conclude that certain lupus auto-antibodies can form glomerular immune deposits by binding directly to non-DNA antigenic structures that are normally present in extracellular locations within normal glomeruli...|$|R
40|$|Nephritogenicity of proteoglycans. III. Mechanism of immune <b>deposit</b> formation. <b>Administration</b> of antibody, {{directed}} against {{glomerular basement membrane}} (GBM) heparan sulfate-proteoglycan, into a presensitized rat results in the induction of membranous nephropathy with subepithelial immune-complex deposits. In this investigation, we examined the mechanisms responsible {{for the formation of}} subepithelial immune-complex deposits in the anti-HS-PG model. In initial experiments, the intravenously administered radioiodinated antibody was seen exclusively localized in the regions of the glomerular capillary wall where the subepithelial deposits were observed. To determine their exclusive localization in the subepithelial space, kinetics of movement of the intravenously administered antibody was investigated. The antibody localized in the inner layers of the GBM within a few minutes after its administration. It equilibrated in the inner and outer layers of the GBM in {{a matter of a few}} hours. Then, after 24 hours, it gradually disappeared from the inner layers of the GBM and persisted in the outer layers only. The ready clearance of the antibody from the inner layers may be related to the differential in the kinetics of lateral intrinsic plasma fluid currents within the GBM. The persistence of heterologous antibody exclusively in the outer layers and the availability of host autologous antibodies probably resulted in the development of immune complex deposits in the subepithelial space. The glomeruli devoid of plasma water currents showed no change in the concentration of the antibody in the inner and outer layers of the GBM or mesangial matrix. Also, no antibody binding was observed with the plasmalemma of either the foot processes or visceral epithelia. The data suggest that the biochemical-biophysical properties of the glomerular capillary wall, in concert with its intraglomerular hemodynamics, most likely played a significant role in the development of subepithelial immune-complex deposits in this model...|$|R
40|$|To {{examine the}} {{influence}} of variable region sequences on the capacity of individual lupus autoantibodies (autoAb) to form glomerular immune deposits, the complete VH and VL region sequences of three anti-DNA mAb that produced morphologi-cally similar immune <b>deposits</b> after <b>administration</b> to normal mice were determined. The Ig were independently derived from 1 -mo-old (H 238, IgM), 3 -mo-old (H 8, IgG 2 a), and 6 -mo-old (H 161, IgG 3) MRL-lpr / lpr mice, and they all produced suben-dothelial and mesangial immune deposits after passive transfer to normal mice. In addition, H 238 and H 161 produced granular deposits in small extraglomerular vessels. The mAb had nearly identical VH gene sequences; H 8 differed from H 238 and H 161 by a single nucleotide in FR 1 {{that resulted in a}} histidine for glutamine substitution. This VH gene sequence was also> 99 % homologous to another anti-DNA Ab (termed H 241), that we previously reported to produce glomerular immune deposits in a similar morphologic pattern. H 161 and H 238 were encoded by DFL 16 and JH 2 genes, whereas H 8 was encoded by a JH 4 gene. Different V,, family genes were used to encode the three mAb, however H 161 and H 238 both used a J, 5 gene. The re-sults indicate that an identical or highly related VH gene is used to encode a subgroup of murine lupus autoAb that share im-mune deposit forming properties. Furthermore, they raise the possibility that amino acid residues independent from those encoded by VH genes may be influential in immune deposit formation at extraglomerular sites. (J. Clin. Invest. 1993. 91 : 402 - 408.) Key words: anti-DNA antibody- systemic lupus erythematosus * VH gene * autoimmunity * glomerulonephriti...|$|R
40|$|Elastin, a major {{extracellular}} matrix protein present in arterial walls provides elastic recoil and resilience to arteries. Elastin {{is prone to}} calcification {{in a number of}} cardiovascular diseases including atherosclerosis and bioprosthetic heart valve mineralization. We have recently shown that purified elastin when implanted subdermally in rats undergoes severe calcification. In the present study, we used this elastin implant model to investigate the molecular mechanisms underlying elastin calcification. Intense matrix metalloproteinase (MMP- 2) and tenascin-C (TN-C) expression were seen in the proximity of the initial cal-cific deposits at 7 days. Gelatin zymography studies showed both MMP- 2 (latent and active form) and MMP- 9 expression within the implants. To investigate the role of MMPs in calcification, rats were administered a MMP inhibitor, (2 S-allyl-N-hydroxy- 3 R-isobutyl-N-(1 S-methylcarbamoyl- 2 -phenylethyl) -succinamide (BB- 1101) by daily injection, either systemically or at the implant site. The site-specific BB- 1101 administration almost completely suppressed TN-C expression, as shown by immunohistochemical staining, within the implants. The systemic BB- 1101 injections also significantly reduced TN-C expression within the elastin implants. Moreover, calcification of elastin implants was significantly reduced in the site-specific administration group (5. 43 ± 1. 03 μg/mg Ca for BB- 1101 group versus 21. 71 ± 1. 19 for control group, P < 0. 001). Alizarin Red staining clearly showed that the elastin fibers were heavily calcified in the control group, whereas in BB- 1101 group the calcification was scarce with few fibers showing initial calcification <b>deposits.</b> The systemic <b>administration</b> of BB- 1101 also significantly reduced elastin calcification (28. 07 ± 5. 81 control versus 16. 92 ± 2. 56 in the BB- 1101 group, P < 0. 05), although less than the site-specific administration. Thus, the present studies indicate that MMPs and TN-C play a role in elastin-oriented calcification...|$|R

Francoist interpretation on the Moscow Gold:Los caminos del oro español"The Spanish government has contacted various foreign Chanceries denouncing the payments abroad that the USSR may carry out with the gold from the deposit made in Moscow by the red Government in 1936 ... During the course of the Liberation Crusade Civil War these same warnings were formulated about the payments that could be done with this gold ... It is logical that our Government repeats its protest when it is known that the USSR is effecting exports with this gold ... Today the details of this robbery are known, as they were reported by their own protagonists. Furthermore: its motives are known and the true dimension of the wile created to justify their departure from Spain towards Odessa. The [...] "resemblances" [...] of sovereignty created by the red Government have been debunked a long time ago. Since the start of our war of Liberation, the red zone had been governed in effect by Soviet emissaries endowed with all the powers ... The plunder of Spain was, in effect, a double operation, economic and political, and the form in which the resupply of the red Government was to be carried out was also a political operation destined to control the Bolshevikation of the area under the control of Largo Caballero. ... In those boxes 1,581,642 million of gold-pesetas were taken to Russia. This figure and details concur with the testimonies by Valentín Gomez, by Jesús Hernández and by Prieto. All of them have sufficient reasons to be informed, as they were direct authors or concealers until the rivalries arisen by the distribution of the spoils pitied them against each other. ... With this gold ... the campaign of communist inspiration against Spain was financed, subsidized, acquiring newspapers and radio stations. The USSR, which had not sent more than old armaments in exchange for the stolen gold, spent it in the second phase of its attempt to take control of Spain from 1945 onwards ... A curious detail remains: the tragic fate of the men that directly intervened in the plunder ...The paths of this stolen gold have been sinister." [...] - Arriba newspaper, January 13, 1955.|$|R
