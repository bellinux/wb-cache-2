This report demonstrates the work completed and experience gained over the duration of the internship. Background information is provided in this report to ensure that there is a substantial understanding of the refinery’s processes and operation. This was required to complete the project work to a high standard. This report summarises all the major projects allocated during the time at the BP refinery. The design, construction and commissioning stages of the project are discussed, detailing the instrumentation roles of each. Projects will be covered in greater detail highlighting background information, methods and procedures. The projects are listed below. DCS Upgrade Phase 3 (HYDY 2) project. This project is the upgrade of all obsolete control system hardware on the <b>hydrofiner</b> unit. It is a multimillion dollar project that is estimated to be completed May 2014. TEL Load Cells project. Aviation fuel is a high quality manufactured product that requires accurate dosing amounts of tetra ethyl lead. This project involves the installation of new load cells that will accurately measure the TEL dosed in the AVGAS, as apposed to the current inaccurate setup. WWTP Flow Weighting Autosampler project. The waster water treatment plant at the refinery is required to sample and purify the water in order to meet environmental standards as explained in section 3. 4. It is required to program the autosampler to take averaged flow samples every hour on the hour. In order to implement such project, optimisation techniques were used to ensure that these samples would meet the minimum requirements.

40|$|In oil {{refineries}} and chemical plants, there exist {{large amount of}} hot fluids. The typical hot fluids include the hot medium water for the process, the condensed hot water, the <b>hydrofining</b> diesel and the <b>hydrofining</b> gasoline etc. These hot fluids from the process have the temperature above 95 Â°C typically, {{and they need to}} be cooled down to the temperature required by the process. Â The air cooling and/or water cooling are used to cool these fluids, and the large amount of thermal energy is wasted in addition to the power and water consumptions. The thermal energy in the hot fluids can be recovered by ORC (Organic Rankine Cycle) to generate power. At the same time the hot fluids can be cooled down to the required temperatures, and thus the power and the water, which are consumed to cool the hot fluids, can be saved. The author applied single stage and cascaded ORC to recover the thermal energy in the hot fluids in refineries and chemical plants, and at the same time to cool the hot fluids to the required temperatures. For the hot fluids with large flow capacities and high required temperature drops, cascaded ORC systems are used to increase the thermal efficiency. In this paper, the author presented two ORC application cases in refineries: a single stage ORC power plant with a screw expander is used to cool down the <b>hydrofining</b> gasoline from the process, which properly is the first case in the world that the hot <b>hydrofining</b> gasoline enters the ORC directly, and a cascaded ORC power plant with screw expanders is used to cool down the hot medium water from the refining process. For the hot medium water application, the author compared the thermal efficiencies for both the single stage and cascaded ORC systems. For the same flow capacity and the same temperature drop of the hot medium water, the thermal efficiency of the cascade ORC is 13. 2 % higher than the single stage ORC...|$|E

However, the traditional landfill of spent catalyst causes resource waste and soil pollution. In recent years, reports show that more spent catalyst has been reutilized to produce cement, flocculant, and wax <b>hydrofining</b> catalyst [4, 5]. Alumina and silica of flue gas dust originate from the FCC fresh catalyst. So, {{it is reasonable to}} reutilize the flue gas dust to prepare FCC catalyst referring to their compositional similarity [6].|$|E

40|$|In this work, {{shale oil}} {{hydrogenation}} was upgraded in a two fixed-bed reactors to maximize light fraction with ultra-low sulfur and nitrogen. Three types of catalyst grading for shale oil hydroprotection, <b>hydrofining,</b> and hydrocracking were investigated {{to evaluate the}} hydrogenation performance. A lumping kinetic model of hydrodesulfurization, hydrodenitrification, and hydrocracking based on catalysts grading was established for the first time. Model parameters were determined using the Levenberg-Marquardt optimization algorithm. Results revealed that the model could accurately predict the removal rations of sulfur, nitrogen, and desired product yields in shale oil hydrogenation under different catalyst grading.

The effects of the reaction temperature and {{liquid hourly space velocity}} (LHSV) on product distribution of shale oil hydrotreating were investigated. Three kinds of lumping kinetic models for,hydrodearomatization (HDA), hydrodesulfurization (HDS), and hydrodenitrogenation (HDN) were first established and applied in this process. The predicted reactive features and optimized operating conditions for HDS, HDN, and HDA agreed well with experimental results at different catalyst grading ratios, with a relative error of less than 3. 8 %.

40|$|It {{has been}} shown that the {{accumulation}} of PP on the catalyst of compound mixtures doesn't proceed according to the not additive scheme. The high contribution of the S-containing compounds and products of their transformation into PP has been revealed. It {{has been shown}} that the movable oxygen of catalyst takes participation in the packimg process and accelerates it. The position of side group in the metyl naphthalenes influences significantly on the PP composition. The obtained data permit to reveal the most coko-genic components of the complex hydrocarbon raw material and to forecast the accumulation scales of PP on the <b>hydrofining</b> catalystes. Two new factors influencing on the packing intensity have been discovered: sulphur removal depth of oil raw material and presence of movable oxygen in catalyst. The taking of discovered factors on the coking rate of catalyst into consideration will permit to optimize the catalyst preparation to the operation and also sulphur removal process of oil fractions. The introduction of obtained results will lead to the service life increase of catalystes.

40|$|Clean {{liquid fuel}} was {{produced}} from the catalytic hydrogenation of coal tar using two serial fixed beds. <b>Hydrofining</b> catalyst of MoNi/gamma-Al 2 O 3 and hydrocracking catalyst of WNiP/gamma-Al 2 O 3 -USY were {{filled in the}} first and second fixed beds, respectively. In the initial catalyst screening tests, the typical fixed experimental conditions were as follows: hydrogen pressure of 8 MPa, liquid hourly space velocity of 0. 8 h(- 1), hydrogen-to-tar volume ratio of 1600, temperature in first fixed bed at 360 degrees C, and temperature in second fixed bed at 380 degrees C. Gasoline (<= 180 degrees C) and diesel (180 - 360 degrees C) fractions were then separated from the effluent oil. Their fuel indexes were determined to assess the hydrogenation performance. The effect of pressure (6 - 10 MPa) on the hydrogenation performance was also investigated by keeping other experimental conditions constant. The catalysts showed good stability in activity in the test of catalyst life. The analysis results of the products indicated that raw coal tar could be promisingly upgraded by catalytic hydrogenation in the serial fixed beds.
