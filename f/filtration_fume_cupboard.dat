40|$|Abstract. A <b>fume</b> <b>cupboard</b> is {{equipment}} {{used to carry}} out chemical reaction process in its working chamber. A suction fan takes air or gas from the working chamber and releases it outside. When the air or gas is flowing from the inlet to the outlet, some recirculation zones may be formed depending on the internal shape design of the <b>fume</b> <b>cupboard.</b> This recirculation zone may create back flow that can {{be the cause of}} leakage. Leakage happens when airborne contaminants escape through inlet of the <b>fume</b> <b>cupboard</b> to the user breathing zone and the surrounding air in the room. To have a good <b>fume</b> <b>cupboard,</b> the recirculation zone needs to be minimised. In this paper, the flow characteristic of a Servco <b>fume</b> <b>cupboard</b> will be presented as a result of computational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulation using κ-ω turbulence model. The results are presented in terms of velocity components at different cross sections of the <b>fume</b> <b>cupboard...</b>|$|R
40|$|A {{push-pull}} <b>fume</b> <b>cupboard</b> shown is {{an innovative}} device to remove pollutants from a <b>fume</b> <b>cupboard</b> to the outdoor environment. A push flow {{coming from the}} bottom of a sash and a pull flow behind the doorsill are adopted to form an air curtain in the <b>fume</b> <b>cupboard.</b> Meanwhile, the roof of a push-pull <b>fume</b> <b>cupboard</b> is open to the environment and ambient fluids are drawn from the roof. To investigate the performance of a push-pull <b>fume</b> <b>cupboard,</b> a numerical model based on the finite volume method is utilized. Various ratios of push flows to pull flows are considered. Four characteristic flow fields are found at a variety of speed ratios. They are concave curtain, straight curtain, under suction and over blow modes. According to numerical results, a concave curtain mode with a fast pull flow and a weak push flow is recommended for the operation of a push-pull fume hood. Furthermore, the manikin effect on the flow filed of a push-pull fume hood is also examined in this study. A manikin is located in front of the <b>fume</b> <b>cupboard</b> according to the ANSI/ASHRAE 110 / 1995 standard. Numerical results reveal that fluid flows in a push-pull <b>fume</b> <b>cupboard</b> are not affected by a manikin.

40|$|Abstract. Recirculation region {{behind a}} <b>fume</b> <b>cupboard</b> sash is the {{potential}} contributor to the leakage of the contaminants due to its large size.

In this paper, the effect of shape of baffle openings on flow distributions of a SERVCO <b>fume</b> <b>cupboard</b> will be presented as a result of CFD.

40|$|The flow {{separation}} and its accompanied recirculation induced when the airflow passes over the inappropriately designed doorsill {{of a chemical}} <b>fume</b> <b>cupboard</b> are the key factors which would lead to deterioration of the cupboard performance. In order to alleviate the contaminant leakage of the <b>fume</b> <b>cupboard</b> induced by inherent aerodynamic deficiency, a technique using doorsill jet injection is developed and validated. A planar jet is ejected upward through a slot located across the inner surface of the doorsill of a full-scale, transparent <b>fume</b> <b>cupboard</b> and is ejected upward. The laser-light-sheet-assisted smoke flow visualization is performed to explore the physical mechanism of changing and controlling the flow structure. It is found that the up-ward injected jet is curved by the airflow drawn into the sash opening and forms a layer of clean air which can isolate the contaminant and alleviate the diffusion through the recirculating vortex on the doorsill, if the jet velocity is properly adjusted. The tracer gas concentration measurements present extraordinarily satisfactory results—the order of magnitude of the leak-age of tracer gas near the doorsill may be reduced from original levels of 102 to 1022 p. p. m. Except for the experimental <b>fume</b> <b>cupboard</b> used for development of technique, two commer-cial <b>fume</b> <b>cupboards</b> are employed for verifications and comparisons on the proposed method.

An average reduction {{of close to}} 90 % on uncontrolled manual time usage was recorded. This, when translated into the energy savings resulting from the markedly lower electrical fan-power consumptions and mechanically extracted space-heat requirements, revealed that a realistic saving of over Â£ 650 per <b>fume</b> <b>cupboard</b> variable cost (1989 prices) per annum could be made in circumstances where, previously, the <b>fume</b> <b>cupboard</b> had been largely (over 90 % of the time) left on. The cost of assembling and fitting the controllable equipment (all done on site) was such that the simple payback for the operation may be as short as two months.

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} is to {{investigate}} airflow motions and associated pollutant distributions in fume hoods. Currently, most exhaust fume hoods are designed to use an airflow induced by a fan at the top to remove pollutants. Ambient fluids are drawn, flowing toward the opening and subsequently turning to the outlet at the roof. Pollutants are supposedly captured by the airflow and brought out from the cupboard. The present numerical study based on the finite-volume method and the standard k–e turbulence model simulates flow patterns and pollutant distributions in an exhaust fume hood with and without a manikin present. Subsequently, a push–pull air curtain technique is applied to a <b>fume</b> <b>cupboard.</b> To investigate the capturing performance of a push–pull <b>fume</b> <b>cupboard,</b> numerical approaches are used to simulate flow and concentration variations. Numerical results reveal that four characteristic flow modes exist for a variety of speed ratios of push–pull flows and openings. A concave curtain mode which has a fast pull flow and a weak push flow is suggested for the operation of a push–pull fume cup-board. According to ANSI-ASHRAE Standard 110 - 1995, the local concentration at the speci-fied point is < 0. 1 parts per million (p. p. m.). Meanwhile, we also examine concentration variations at 12 selected points in front of the sash, and all where the concentration is < 0. 1 p. p. m. A manikin is put in front of the sash to observe its effect. As a result, the flow and the concentration contours in a push–pull <b>fume</b> <b>cupboard</b> are not affected by a manikin. In terms of those predicted results, it turns out that a push–pull <b>fume</b> <b>cupboard</b> successfully captures pollutants and prevents an operator from breathing pollutants...|$|R

40|$|Abstract: In {{order to}} {{speculate}} the physical mechanisms of contaminant leakage during sash movement and walk-bys through a laboratory <b>fume</b> <b>cupboard,</b> the complicated three-dimensional flow patterns and the real-time tracer gas leakage are studied via the laser-assisted flow visualization method {{and the standard}} gas sampling technique, respectively, over a transparent, full scale chemical <b>fume</b> <b>cupboard.</b> Through the flow visualization, the evolution of drastic changes of the flow pattern is demonstrated. The highly turbulent jet-like currents are induced by the unsteady flow motion near the cupboard face. Large-scale turbulent eddies accompanied with the jet-like currents obviously bring large amount of in-cupboard smoke out to the atmosphere. The turbulent mixing extends the size {{and the strength of}} the large-scale eddy circulations, and predominantly contributes to the mechanism that causes the severe spread of contaminant leakage in few seconds. The tracer gas tests that are conducted by employing pr-EN 14175 : 2003 method show consistent containment results with the flow visualization findings. The temporally evolving large-scale turbulent eddies induced by the sash movement and the walk-bys cause substantially high contaminant leakage to the environment and the breathing zone of the operator...|$|R
40|$|The laser-light-sheet-assisted smoke flow {{visualization}} {{technique is}} performed on a full-size, transparent, commercial grade chemical <b>fume</b> <b>cupboard</b> to diagnose the flow characteristics and {{to verify the}} validity of several current containment test methods. The visualized flow patterns identify the recirculation areas that would inevitably exist in the conventional <b>fume</b> <b>cupboards</b> because of the fundamental configurations and structures. The large-scale vortex structures exist around the side walls, the doorsill of the cupboard and {{in the vicinity of}} the nearwake region of the manikin. The identified recirculation areas are taken as the ‘dangerous’ regions where the risk of turbulent dispersion of contaminants may be high. Several existing tracer gas containment test methods (BS 7258 : 1994, prEN 14175 - 3 : 2003 and ANSI/ASHRAE 110 : 1995) are conducted to verify the effectiveness of these methods in detecting the contaminant leakage. By comparing the results of the flow visualization and the tracer gas tests, it is found that the local recirculation regions are more prone to contaminant leakage because of the complex interaction between the shear layers and the smoke movement through the mechanism of turbulent dispersion. From the point of view of aerodynamics, the present study verifies that the methodology of the prEN 14175 - 3 : 2003 protocol can produce more reliable and consisten...|$|R

Manufacturers of contamination control equipment have the expense of testing by varying methods in dierent countries where standards apply.
