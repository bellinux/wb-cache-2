500|$|McCann {{notes that}} one of the reasons that Grant was so {{successful}} with his film career is that he was not conscious of how handsome he was on screen, acting in a fashion which was most unexpected and unusual from a Hollywood star of that period. George Cukor once stated: [...] "You see, he didn't depend on his looks. He wasn't a narcissist, he acted as though he were just an ordinary young man. And that made it all the more appealing, that a handsome young man was funny; that was especially unexpected and good because we think, 'Well, if he's a Beau Brummel, he can't be either funny or intelligent', but he proved otherwise". Jennifer Grant acknowledged that her father neither relied on his looks nor was a character actor, and said that he was <b>just</b> <b>the</b> <b>opposite</b> <b>of</b> that, playing the [...] "basic man".|$|E
2500|$|The {{other factor}} {{crippling}} the political {{effect of the}} strikes occurred in the United States and was <b>just</b> <b>the</b> <b>opposite</b> <b>of</b> that in Britain. [...] Critics of the Truman administration in Congress quickly seized on the military success of the strikes to question why the attacks had taken almost two years to be approved. General Clark, who agreed, so advised the JCS. Secretary of Defense Robert A. Lovett, to whom the inquiries were made, cited seven factors, but some were long obsolete {{by the time of}} the attacks and others clearly badly estimated.|$|E
2500|$|The hotel came to {{represent}} a level of achievement among the black community. Historian Lonnie G. Bunch III said, [...] "On the one hand, blacks {{were not allowed to}} stay at major hotels. [...] But with enough financial wherewithal and a strong sense of community a black man could build a large hotel." [...] Unlike earlier segregated hotels and boarding houses, the Somerville (and later the Dunbar) offered luxury amenities – a restaurant, cocktail lounge and barbershop. One person noted, [...] "The Dunbar symbolizes luxury and respect even in the worst of times." [...] Roy Wilkins wrote in the New York Amsterdam News of the hotel's luxury and service: [...] "Everything was <b>just</b> <b>the</b> <b>opposite</b> <b>of</b> what we had come to expect in ‘Negro’ hotels." ...|$|E

2500|$|Originalists often argue that, where a {{constitution}} is silent, judges should not read rights into it (i.e. a textualist interpretation). However, the Ninth Amendment, seen through an originalist lens, {{can be seen}} as providing the judiciary with means of protecting [...] which the founders had not thought, for whatever reasons, to explicitly list, such as rights involving abortion, gender and sexual orientation equality, and capital punishment. This presents a particular challenge to the theory of Original Intent, which seems to thus suggest <b>just</b> <b>the</b> <b>opposite</b> <b>of</b> what the text of the Constitution and original intent of the founders arguably affirm, creating an inconsistency in the practice of at least one branch of Originalism. The subsequent Tenth Amendment, detailing non-enumerated rights as the sole property of the states and the people, is often cited as the clarification for this inconsistency and the reason why the federal courts have no say in affirming or denying said rights per the Ninth Amendment.|$|E

60|$|The {{last great}} {{pamphlet}} {{in the history}} of English public affairs had been Swift's tract On the Conduct of the Allies (1711), in which the writer did a more substantial service for the Tory party of his day than Burke did for the Whig party of a later date. Swift's pamphlet is close, strenuous, persuasive, and full of telling strokes; but nobody need read it to-day except the historical student, or a member of the Peace Society, in search of the most convincing exposure of the most insane of English wars.[1] There is not a sentence in it which does not belong exclusively to the matter in hand: not a line of that general wisdom which is for all time. In the Present Discontents the method is <b>just</b> <b>the</b> <b>opposite</b> <b>of</b> this. The details are slurred, and they are not literal. Burke describes with excess of elaboration how the new system is a system of double cabinets; one put forward with nominal powers in Parliament, the other concealed behind the throne, and secretly dictating the policy. The reader feels that this is worked out far too closely to be real. It is a structure of artificial rhetoric. But we lightly pass this over, on our way to more solid matter; to the exposition of the principles of a constitution, the right methods of statesmanship, and the defence of party.|$|E
6000|$|He {{made his}} story rather amusing, {{describing}} the strange {{ways of the}} Egyptians; how they worshipped cats and bulls, and did everything in <b>just</b> <b>the</b> <b>opposite</b> <b>of</b> the Greek way of doing things. So Diomede let him have a rug and blankets to sleep on in the portico of the hut, and next day the old wretch went begging about the camp and talking with the soldiers. Now he was a most impudent and annoying old vagabond, and was always in quarrels. If there was a disagreeable story about the father or grandfather {{of any of the}} princes, he knew it and told it, so that he got a blow from the baton of Agamemnon, and Aias gave him a kick, and Idomeneus drubbed him with the butt of his spear for a tale about his grandmother, and everybody hated him and called him a nuisance. He was for ever jeering at Ulysses, who was far away, and telling tales about Autolycus, and at last he stole a gold cup, a very large cup, with two handles, and a dove sitting on each handle, from the hut of Nestor. The old chief was fond of this cup, which he had brought from home, and, when it was found in the beggar's dirty wallet, everybody cried that he must be driven out of the camp and well whipped. So Nestor's son, young Thrasymedes, with other young men, laughing and shouting, pushed and dragged the beggar close up to the Scaean gate of Troy, where Thrasymedes called with a loud voice, 'O Trojans, we are sick of this shameless beggar. First we shall whip him well, and if he comes back we shall put out his eyes and cut off his hands and feet, and give him to the dogs to eat. He may go to you, if he likes; if not, he must wander till he dies of hunger.' ...|$|E
