40|$|This {{study of}} credit management– A Case Study of Wegagen Bank Share Company in Tigray Region {{is an attempt}} to {{indicate}} the importance of credit management in financial institutions such as commercial banks, micro finances and others. Thus, the rationale behind for undertaking this study is to deeply investigate the causes of credit management problems and to suggest the possible solutions that enable the bank to run its operation in a safest way as credit is known to be the main stay of all banks. The ability of banks to formulate and adhere to policies and procedures that promote credit quality and curtail non-performing loans is the means to survive in the stiff competition. Inability to create and build up quality loans and credit worthy customers leads to default risk and bankruptcy as well as hampers economic growth of a country. However, little work is done to search the ways and means that enable to quality loan creation and growth as well as to determine the relationship between the theories, concepts and credit policies both at country or regional level. The main objective of the study is to evaluate the performance of credit management of Wegagen bank in Tigray Region as compared to National Bank’s requirements in comparison with its credit policy and procedures. For {{the purpose of the study}} both primary and secondary data are used. Primary data is collected using semi structured questionnaires. The secondary data is collected from annual reports, directives, and bulletins of the bank. Descriptive statistical tools are used in analyzing the data collected. Hence, the nature of the Study is descriptive. Finally, based on the findings possible recommendations are given. These include the issues impeding loan growth and rising loan clients complaint on the bank regarding the valuing of properties offered for collateral, lengthy of loan processing, amount of loan processed and approved, loan period, and <b>discretionary</b> <b>limits</b> affecting the performance of credit management...|$|R

30|$|The latest {{provisional}} estimate of net {{migration to the}} UK for the year to September 2014 is 298, 000 (Office for National Statistics 2015). It is now certain that the UK Government will not achieve the net migration target of 100, 000 before the 2015 General Election as promised by Prime Minister David Cameron. Nonetheless, the recent policies of the UK Government to decrease net migration provide an excellent opportunity to gain lessons {{about the consequences of}} pursuing a migration target in a context in which <b>discretionary</b> power is <b>limited</b> given the presence of elements over which the Government has different levels of influence (e.g., EEA vs. non-EEA migrant workers). In this paper we explore those lessons. In particular, we explore the impact of the restrictions on different migrant groups in terms of numbers and skills composition. We place particular emphasis on the possible interaction between the restricted and unrestricted components of UK migration.|$|R
30|$|The {{main goal}} of the UK Government’s {{migration}} policy since 2010 has been to decrease net migration to less than 100, 000 migrants per year by the 2015 General Election. According to the latest net migration estimate, this goal will not be achieved. This paper contributes to the existing literature by exploring the recent policies of the UK Government to analyze the consequences of pursuing a migration target in {{a context in which}} <b>discretionary</b> power is <b>limited.</b> The results suggest that policies to decrease net migration were accompanied by a reduction in non-EEA high-skilled RMW and an increase in EEA high-skilled RMW. This is consistent with the fact that UK Government policy changes to make migration more restrictive have been directed towards non-EEA nationals and include the restriction and closing of routes intended for high-skilled migrants. Counterfactual estimates suggest that there would have been more non-EEA high-skilled RMW and fewer Old EU high-skilled RMW in the UK in 2013 with pre-policies conditions.|$|R

40|$|We study {{whether and}} how capital {{regulation}} affects banks’ loan loss provisions. Using handpicked data on 46 Nordic banks, we find that banks use discretion to reduce loan loss provisions for regulatory capital management purposes. Exercising discretion to reduce provisions shifts capital from the expected loss buffer to the unexpected loss buffer {{at the expense of}} banks’ overall ability to absorb loan losses. Controlling for non-discretionary determinants of loan loss provisions, we find that banks reduce provisions when an increase in capital requirements puts pressure on eligible capital for regulatory purposes. Additionally, we find that banks’ regulatory capital position influences provisioning behavior. We show that a stronger regulatory capital position coming into the year yields higher levels of loan loss provisions, while an improvement in regulatory capital position during the year constitutes a reduction in loan loss provisions. When studying SIFI-banks and IRB-banks, we find no evidence indicating that newly enacted regulations are effective in <b>limiting</b> <b>discretionary</b> provisions for regulatory purposes. Our analyses indicate that banks exercise discretionary provisioning behavior when circumventing regulatory capital requirements...|$|R

Main Topics : The DSS interest was in the <b>discretionary</b> budget <b>limited</b> elements of the fund including crisis loans, budgeting loans and community care grants. The research was required to cover successful applicants for loans and grants, unsuccessful applicants for loans and grants, people receiving income support who had not applied for help to the fund and people on low incomes not receiving income support. The questions to be tackled by the research included: What was the nature and extent of the needs for lump sum payments? What degree of help was provided by the fund to help meet those needs? What help was provided by other quarters? What was their previous history of supplementary benefit single payments? How did loan applicants cope with repayments? What alternative strategies were adopted by unsuccessful applicants/non applicants; how did they cope? What is the general attitude of applicants/non applicants to the social fund; what led them to turn to (not to turn to) it for help?

40|$|This paper {{considers}} the appropriate role for {{government in the}} support of scientific and technological progress in health care; the information the federal government needs to make well-informed decisions about its role; and the ways that federal policy toward research and development should respond to scientific advances, technology trends, {{and changes in the}} political and social environment. The principal justification for government support of research rests upon economic characteristics that lead private markets to provide inappropriate levels of research support or to supply inappropriate quantities of the products that result from research. The federal government has two basic tools for dealing with these problems: direct subsidies for research and strengthened property rights that can increase the revenues that companies receive for the products that result from research. In the coming years, the delivery system for health care will continue to undergo dramatic changes, new research opportunities will emerge at a rapid pace, and the pressure to <b>limit</b> <b>discretionary</b> federal spending will intensify. These forces make it increasingly important to improve the measurement of {{the costs and benefits of}} research and to recognize the tradeoffs among alternative policies for promoting innovation in health care...|$|R
40|$|This article {{examines}} Alberta 2 ̆ 7 s Wildlife Act {{and the federal}} Species at Risk Act (SARA) to assess the legal protection of endangered species in Alberta. Most of the discussion related to provisions contained in SARA, as there is comparatively less to discuss under the Wildlife Act. The fact that legal protection for endangered species in Alberta consists primarily of federal statutory rules is unfortunate, as wildlife and its habitat are by and large property of the provincial Crown, {{and it is a}} general principle of constitutional law that the federal government cannot in substance legislate over provincial property under the guise of a regulatory scheme. The legal protections in SARA are, thus, for the most part restricted to species found on federal lands and to species that fall under federal legislative powers. This article demonstrates that the Alberta government has chosen to govern species at risk almost entirely by policy and <b>discretionary</b> power. The <b>limited</b> application of federal protections to provincial lands and the absence of meaningful protection in the Wildlife Act leads the authors to conclude that, despite a perception of legal protection for endangered species, such protection does not exist in Alberta...|$|R
40|$|The {{perennial}} {{debate on}} {{the relative merits of}} alternative exchange-rate regimes was revived in the 1990 s by a succession of exchange-rate crises and associated global contagion. Despite declining enthusiasm for market-determined exchange rates, the currencies of most developed countries continued to float subject to only <b>limited</b> <b>discretionary</b> intervention. The major exception has been the European Union. Following a period of crises that accompanied attempts to keep exchange rates within predefined limits, eleven EU members opted for a common regional currency issued by a regional central bank [...] a choice not even on the policy menu {{at the start of the}} decade. Developing countries and transition economies were also divided between those willing to cope with a market-determined rate and those choosing to fix in terms of another currency or currency basket. The newest twist for countries that fix their rate concerns minimizing the risk of crisis, and especially crisis via contagion.

This study aimed to explore factors influencing food choice and dietary intake in shift workers. A fixed mixed method study design was undertaken on {{a convenience sample of}} firefighters who continually work a rotating roster. Six focus groups (n = 41) were conducted to establish factors affecting dietary intake whilst at work. Dietary intake was assessed using repeated 24 h dietary recalls (n = 19). Interviews were audio recorded, transcribed verbatim, and interpreted using thematic analysis. Dietary data were entered into FoodWorks and analysed using Wilcoxon signed-rank test; p < 0. 05 was considered significant. Thematic analysis highlighted four key themes influencing dietary intake: shift schedule; attitudes and decisions of co-workers; time and accessibility; and knowledge of the relationship between food and health. Participants reported consuming more <b>discretionary</b> foods and <b>limited</b> availability of healthy food choices on night shift. Energy intakes (kJ/day) did not differ between days that included a day or night shift but greater energy density (EDenergy, kJ/g/day) of the diet was observed on night shift compared with day shift. This study has identified a number of dietary-specific shift-related factors that may contribute to an increase in unhealthy behaviours in a shift-working population.

40|$|When {{government}} entities procure {{goods or}} services, they generally consider and award contracts only to bidders who {{complied with the}} specifications and conditions of tender as laid down in the tender invitation. Tenders received must in other words be conforming, compliant or responsive. This enables procuring entities to compare tenders {{on an equal footing}} and ensures equal treatment amongst bidders. In South Africa the extent to which bidders must comply with tender specifications and conditions is a thorny issue in practice. In 2008 the Supreme Court of Appeal in Millennium Waste Management (Pty) Ltd v Chairperson, Tender Board: Limpopo Province confirmed the views of the courts in South Africa regarding compliance with tender conditions and the amendment of tenders before award. The recent 2013 decision of the Supreme Court of Appeal in Dr JS Moroka Municipality v The Chairperson of the Tender Evaluation Committee of the Dr JS Moroka Municipality, however, has moved public procurement regulation in South Africa to a point where procuring entities have very <b>limited</b> <b>discretionary</b> powers when evaluating compliance with tender specifications and conditions.

40|$|Purpose: {{this paper}} offers {{insights}} into the consumption motives and purchasing behaviour of that market segment in Taiwan {{against the background of}} increasing consumption of luxury fashion brands by young female consumers in Asian countries. Design/methodology/approach: analysis of data collected using face-to-face semi-structured interviews with 23 fashion-conscious females aged 18 - 32 years was completed and new empirical insights are offered. Findings: the study found a high level of involvement in the world of luxury fashion retailing. Asian consumers devoured media commentary, drew inspiration from female celebrities and treated information-seeking and discussion of luxury fashion brands with friends as a serious and enjoyable pursuit. The social status conferred by expensive fashion wear motivated them to spend on luxury brands even if their <b>discretionary</b> income was <b>limited.</b> Potential guilt in so doing was assuaged by rationalising that the quality was good and the purchase would be long lasting. Marketers targeting this valuable segment should communicate appeals to an aspirational lifestyle in traditional and social media, effective at reaching young women. Originality/value: the study reported in this paper contributes to the limited published research into the luxury-marketing sector in Asia by examining the buying behaviour of female Strawberry Generation consumers in Taiwan. It is the first to research and investigate the meanings attached to luxury by these individuals in the collectivist culture of Taiwan, as well as their motivations, and the factors influencing their purchase of luxury fashions. The study thus contributes with new knowledge to the buying of luxury fashion products by young female Taiwanese consumers, which may be extended to other collectivist cultures in Asi...|$|R

É analisada cada forma de imunidade das entidades do elenco da norma constitucional, bem como traz a lume as polêmicas quanto à tributação das atividades de cada tipo associativo homenageado pelo constituinte originário na Carta Maior. A imunidade tributária somente é possível de ser tratada diante da Competência Tributária Impositiva ao limitar os poderes da União Federal, dos Municípios, dos Estados e do Distrito Federal em criar tributos. O tratamento tributário dado à exploração {{comercial}} e às propriedades pertencentes à Igreja (alínea "b" do art. 150, VI da Constituição Federal de 1988), ou seja, àquelas receitas que são provenientes de atividades atípicas, sempre causaram dúvidas na jurisprudência e dividem a doutrina até hoje. Não diferente é o tratamento tributário dado à produção e circulação de bens das entidades do elenco da alínea "c" do art. 150, VI da Constituição Federal de 1988, cujas atividades atípicas, por muitos são entendidas como tributáveis. As atividades típicas, por sua vez, quando inerentes aos templos de qualquer culto, devem ser qualificadas pela imunidade plena, enquanto as entidades da alínea "c" do art. 150, VI da Constituição Federal de 1988, são deparadas com a norma de imunidade de eficácia contida, da qual depende de lei complementar, cuja discussão no presente trabalho traz a polêmica acerca da aplicação da lei ordinária ou da lei complementar; a posição maciça dos tribunais é no sentido da ratificação do art. 14 do Código Tributário Nacional, como requisito para qualificar quais entidades devem ser brindadas com a imunidade. Por fim, para não ficar somente no campo teórico, o presente trabalho analisa a aplicação da imunidade aos tipos associativos do elenco das alíneas "b" e "c" do art. 150, VI da Constituição Federal de 1988 sob a ótica dos Tribunais pátriosThis study {{seeks to}} bring the understanding of tax immunity system according to article 150, VI, "b" and "c" of the Federal Constitution of 1988. Each type of immunity from the constitutional law is analyzed. It is also brought to light the controversy regarding the taxation of the activities of each associative type embraced by the constituent present in the Federal Constitution. Tax exemption is only possible {{to be dealt with}} before the mandatory tax jurisdiction that limits the powers of the Federal Government, the Municipalities, the States and the Federal District to create taxes. The tax treatment given to commercial exploitation and to the properties owned by the Church ("b" of article 150, VI of the Constitution of 1988), that is, revenue originating from atypical activities, has always raised doubts in jurisprudence and caused doctrine to have different views, today. It is no different the tax treatment given to production and circulation of goods from entities mentioned in article 150, VI, "c" of 1988 Federal Constitution, since the atypical activities are regarded by many as taxable. Typical activities, in turn, when related to temples of any cult, must be qualified for full immunity while entities of article 150, VI, "c" of the 1988 Federal Constitution, have to face the immunity rules of <b>limited</b> <b>discretionary</b> accountability which depends on the supplementary law. The present investigation discusses the controversy on the adoption of either ordinary or supplementary law. Courts major position is towards ratification of article 14 of the National Tax Code, as a requirement to qualify which entities should be entitled to immunity.
