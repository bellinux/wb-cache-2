Because the <b>kiswa,</b> the ceremonial covering for the Ka'aba, was usually woven in Egypt, it was carried by the Cairo caravan, while the Damascene caravan carried the corresponding covering for Muhammad's tomb in Medina. A few Mamluk sultans made the pilgrimage themselves, but usually their symbolic presence was represented by a palanquin (maḥmal), escorted by musicians.|$|E

They were, of course, of Turkic descent but claimed an ancient Yemenite origin to justify their rule. The Rasulids were not the first dynasty to create a fictitious genealogy for political purposes, nor were they doing {{anything out of the ordinary}} in the tribal context of Arabia. By claiming descent from a solid Yemenite tribe, the Rasulid brought Yemen to a vital sense of unity in an otherwise chaotic regional milieu. They had a difficult relationship with the Mamluks of Egypt because the latter considered them a vassal state. Their competition centered over the Hejaz and the right to provide <b>kiswa</b> of the Ka'aba in Mecca.
