25|$|Wilson {{recommended}} Kiggell as {{his successor}} and thought {{the appointment of}} William Robertson “a tremendous gamble”, writing “my heart sinks when <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>what</b> <b>it</b> all may mean to the College & this house”. He may have felt that Robertson’s lack of private means did not suit him for a position which required entertaining. Robertson visited Camberley with Lord Kitchener (28 July 1910), who criticised Wilson; {{this may have been}} one of the causes of the poor relations between Wilson and Kitchener in August 1914. Edmonds later told a story of how Wilson had, perhaps as a joke or wanting to draw attention to Robertson’s shortage of money, left a bill for £250 for furniture and improvements to the Commandant’s residence, and that Wilson’s predecessor Rawlinson, when approached by Robertson for advice, had been amused and had commented that many of these improvements had been made by his own wife or by previous Commandants. Whatever the truth of the matter, relations between Wilson and Robertson deteriorated thereafter.|$|E
2500|$|Some {{terrorism}} experts {{thought there}} was a connection in Muhammed's case to other homegrown terror plots in recent years, including targets, ideological motives and religious inspiration. Neil Livingstone, a terrorism consultant, said that people on the margins of society are [...] "easy marks" [...] for recruiters offering them ideological and fanatical religious justifications for violence, noting [...] "Most of these guys — <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>what</b> <b>it</b> comes down to — they're misfits, they believe they've suffered injustice. ... They basically are striking back at society." ...|$|E
6000|$|I suppose I am {{to take it}} {{for granted}} that all that he [...] tells me is true; though when <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>what</b> <b>it</b> is that I [...] have to accept,--and that on the word of a man who is not [...] your father, and who is a perfect {{stranger}} to me,--it does [...] seem as though I were assuming a great deal. And yet it is [...] no more than I asked him to do for me when I saw him at [...] his own house.|$|E
6000|$|... "I don't suppose men {{feels it}} as we do; but, oh, Mrs. Lopez, give me a little, safe, so that I may know that I shan't see my {{children}} want. When <b>I</b> <b>thinks</b> <b>what</b> <b>it</b> {{would be to have}} them darlings' little bellies empty, and nothing in the cupboard, I get that low that I'm nigh fit for Bedlam." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes; <b>I</b> do--or <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>I</b> do. <b>What</b> <b>it</b> comes to, {{in a few}} words, is that {{somebody}} you were fond of {{has gone out of}} your life. Is that it?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh! the word! I had {{forgotten}} all about <b>it.</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>I</b> know <b>what</b> <b>it</b> must be, but I should so like another story. May I not have one?" [...] said Meta coaxingly. [...] "Mary, it is you." ...|$|R
5000|$|Klara Skrivankova, Trafficking Programme Coordinator at Anti-Slavery International, said: [...] "Slavery {{and this}} case {{which appears to}} be a case of forced labour is a reality in Britain today but <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>what</b> <b>it</b> shows to us is that the police have finally been given proper powers in the new law that has been {{mentioned}} in order to investigate and really go after those who are still behaving like slave-masters in the 21st century." ...|$|E
50|$|Well, what Secretary Powell and the US {{seems to}} have said is that he now has grave doubts about the {{accuracy}} of the case he put to the United Nations about the claim that Iraq possessed biological weapons laboratories - the so-called mobile trailers. And here in Australia, that formed also part of the government's argument on the war. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>what</b> <b>it</b> does is it adds to the fabric of how the Australian people were misled about the reasons for going to war.|$|E

6000|$|... "It {{seems to}} me that I have," [...] replied the Pumpkinhead, seriously; [...] "but <b>I</b> cannot <b>think</b> <b>what</b> <b>it</b> is. My father knows all about it, but he is not here." ...|$|R
50|$|His last words: It's kind of funny—dying. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>I</b> know <b>what</b> <b>it</b> will be like. I'll be {{standing}} there, {{and all of}} a sudden everything will be black, then there'll be a light again. There's got to be a light again—there's got to be..|$|R
5000|$|... "It's {{a lesson}} {{before you make}} out. No, <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>what</b> <b>it</b> is, you know, is for me {{personal}}ly… when life is over, it's over man. And you just kinda go, [...] "Whoa, wait a minute. I need to re-think this thing." [...] So {{you put it on}} such a personal level…and you think, [...] "Man, what am I doing? I work all the time doing all this stuff that maybe is just trivial and maybe I need {{to spend more time with}} you." [...] So that's what it is. It is a love song." ...|$|E

5000|$|The poem Frasier quotes in {{this episode}} is a {{shortened}} version of Alfred, Lord Tennyson’s [...] "Ulysses"."It {{may be that}} the gulfs will wash us down;It may be we shall touch the Happy Isles,And though we are not now that strength which in old daysMoved earth and heaven, that which we are, we are—shifts to Frasier’s KACL booth.Made weak by time and fate, but strong in will;To strive, to seek, to find, and not to yield."I’ve been thinking about that poem a lot lately. And <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>what</b> <b>it</b> says is that, while it’s tempting to play it safe, the more we’re willing to risk, the more alive we are. In the end, what we regret most are the chances we never took. And I hope that explains, at least a little, this journey on which I am about to embark. I have loved every minute with my KACL family, and all of you. For eleven years you've heard me say, [...] "I’m listening." [...] Well, you were listening, too. And for that I am eternally grateful. Goodnight, Seattle.|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, if you're as {{important}} as this before you're elected, <b>I</b> can't <b>think</b> <b>what</b> <b>it</b> will be afterwards," [...] Mrs. Pomfret lamented. [...] "Poor dear Humphrey is so conscientious. When can you come, Humphrey?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "And do we? Sometimes, when <b>I</b> <b>think</b> of <b>what</b> <b>it</b> means--This poor {{child of}} Redwood's--And, of course, your three... Forty feet high, perhaps! After all, ought we {{to go on}} with it?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Does she mean young Gay, Louisa?' inquired Mr Dombey, {{knitting}} his brows. 'Really, this child's manners {{have become}} very boisterous. She cannot mean young Gay, <b>I</b> <b>think.</b> See <b>what</b> <b>it</b> is, will you?' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "We {{need not}} stay now," [...] he said. [...] "He was calm {{at the last}} and had all the {{consolation}} Father Sebastian could give him. An honest man, and brave, <b>I</b> <b>think,</b> believing <b>what</b> <b>it's</b> obvious he did believe!" ...|$|R
5000|$|... “They {{definitely}} get you noticed,” declared Cat Deeley. “I {{love her}} appreciation of color. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> it’s beautiful {{and for me}} they fit my body; they look good on me and <b>I</b> <b>think</b> that’s <b>what</b> <b>it’s</b> all about. It’s about knowing your own body and knowing what suits you.” ...|$|R
6000|$|... "This {{thing is}} getting {{too big for}} you and me," [...] he said. [...] "You have not complained, but to-night one could fancy that it's {{breaking}} you. Now, I'm not made like you, and when <b>I</b> <b>think</b> of <b>what</b> <b>it</b> has cost me I have got to talk." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "If {{you could}} have given me worse, <b>I</b> cannot <b>think</b> <b>what</b> <b>it</b> might have been," [...] he groaned. Then, as if smitten by a sudden notion that flashed a gleam of hope into this terrifying {{darkness}} that was settling down upon him, he suddenly looked up. [...] "You mean to resist him?" [...] he inquired.|$|R
6000|$|Why you say I am the DEVIL, the Child, you know, {{has always}} {{most of the}} Mother in it, then that must be a Devil too <b>I</b> <b>think,</b> <b>what</b> else can <b>it</b> be, says she? ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I do not;--not the least; I {{can promise}} you that. And <b>I</b> never shall;--never. <b>Think</b> <b>what</b> <b>it</b> {{would be to}} have a wife who doesn't love you a bit. Would not that be bad?" ...|$|R
6000|$|That {{hot wind}} sweeps over Sydney sometimes, and brings with <b>it</b> <b>what</b> {{is called a}} [...] "dust-storm." [...] It is said that most Australian towns are acquainted with the dust-storm. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>I</b> know <b>what</b> <b>it</b> is like, for the {{following}} description by Mr. Gane tallies very well with the alkali duststorm of Nevada, if you leave out the [...] "shovel" [...] part. Still the shovel part is a pretty important part, and {{seems to indicate that}} my Nevada storm is but a poor thing, after all.|$|R
60|$|In this abrupt way, my evening ended; it's with {{a melancholy}} regret that <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>what</b> came of <b>it.</b> <b>I</b> don't wear plush any more. I am an altered, a wiser, and, I trust, a better man.|$|R
6000|$|... "Weel," [...] {{continued}} the farmer, [...] "I never {{set up for}} bein' a humorist, but I can juist assure ye 'at I lauch at queer things too. No lang syne I woke up i' my bed lauchin' like onything, an' Lisbeth thocht I wasna weel. It was something I dreamed 'at made me lauch, <b>I</b> couldna <b>think</b> <b>what</b> <b>it</b> was, but <b>I</b> laughed richt. Was that no fell like a humorist?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I <b>think</b> <b>I</b> know <b>what</b> <b>it</b> means!" [...] exclaimed Dick, leaping for the door. [...] "Come on, if {{you want}} to save the Dartaway!" [...] he went on, to his brothers.|$|R
6000|$|... "I don’t think so," [...] {{said the}} doctor, {{accepting}} with alacrity {{an offer to}} go ashore in the launch and change into some decent clothes. [...] "I <b>think</b> <b>I</b> know <b>what</b> <b>it</b> was." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I didn't say that," [...] said Rand, [...] "and <b>I</b> don't <b>think</b> <b>it.</b> <b>What</b> <b>I</b> meant was, {{he might}} have met a party that was picnicking here to-day,--Sol. Saunders and wife, and Miss Euphemia--" ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'I {{wonder you}} find any {{gratification}} {{in coming to}} see me. <b>I</b> can't <b>think</b> <b>what</b> put <b>it</b> in your head. I never had much in seeing you. There was no love lost between us, Mr Pinch, at any time, I think.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "She {{is a good}} girl," [...] said Trixit briefly, {{yet with}} a slight rise in color on his dark, sallow cheek, and a sudden {{wavering}} of his steadfast eyes. [...] "She tells me you have a message from your directors. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>I</b> know <b>what</b> <b>it</b> is, but we won't discuss it now. As I am going directly to Sacramento, I shall not see them, but I {{will give you an}} answer to take to them when we reach the station. I am {{going to give you a}} lift there when my daughter is ready. And here she is." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Of {{a broken}} heart, {{some of our}} old nurses told me,' replied Oliver: more {{as if he were}} talking to himself, than {{answering}} Noah. 'I <b>think</b> <b>I</b> know <b>what</b> <b>it</b> must be to die of that!' ...|$|R
5000|$|The {{question}} on many people's minds {{is whether this}} fragment should lead us to re-think whether Jesus was married. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> however, <b>what</b> <b>it</b> leads us to do, is not to answer that {{question on}}e way or the other, it should lead us to re-think how Christianity understood sexuality and marriage in a very positive way, and to recapture the pleasures of sexuality, the joyfulness and the beauties of human intimate relations.|$|R
50|$|Ceremonies in Dark Old Men {{received}} positive {{reviews and}} tremendous praise. It was hailed by critic John Simon as “A phoenix too infrequent.” Edith Oliver from The New Yorker stated in her review, “Ceremonies {{is the first}} play by Lonne Elder III to be done professionally, and if any American has written a finer one <b>I</b> can’t <b>think</b> <b>what</b> <b>it</b> is.” The play went on to garner nomination for the 1969 Pulitzer Prize in drama and is considered an America theatre classic.|$|R
6000|$|... "Jone," [...] said I, when we {{was eating}} breakfast, [...] "it's as plain as A B C that those agents don't want us for tenants, and it isn't {{because they think}} we {{are not to be}} trusted, for we'd have to pay in advance, and so their money's safe; it is {{something}} else, and <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>I</b> know <b>what</b> <b>it</b> is. These London men are very sharp, and used to sizing and sorting all kinds of people as if they was potatoes being got ready for market, and they have seen that we are not what they call over here gentlefolks." ...|$|R
