The mention of the word (Talaq) divorce has now become so cheap that in some marriages, every argument futures this word, either the husband threatens with it or the wife demands it. Hence women are married and divorce at will for minor reasons. This paper is therefore an attempt to highlight some {{of the causes of}} rampant divorce and its negative impact on Muslim women {{in the northern part of}} Nigeria. Some Shari’ah court cases were also examined in other to find out whether the Judiciary is invulnerable to the problem of divorce among Muslim women in Northern Nigeria. The study reveals that the challenges and negative effects of divorce are usually much stronger on the woman and her off springs than the man. These ranges from psychological trauma, immoral behaviour, Economic hardship, denial of custody, etc.   Using descriptive and analytical methods, this paper interprets Islamic teachings as enshrined in the Qur’an and Sunnah with a view to proffering Islamic solutions on them.

40|$|Aside {{from the}} {{principle}} of irretrievable breakdown, {{the principle of}} fault-based liability {{is one of the}} two primary principles of Austrian divorce law. Based on the applicable principle of fault-based liability, a spouse can impose an immediate divorce against the will of the other spouse only if the marriage has irretrievably broken down due to a severe violation of the marriage contract. Otherwise the <b>spouse</b> <b>intending</b> to divorce has to wait until the require- ments for a divorce due to an irretrievable breakdown are in place, in particular a severing of the marriage bond for three years (in special hardship cases up to six years). The question as to which of the two spouses is at fault for the failure of the marriage also impacts the consequences of divorce, in particular the claims of the divorced spouses with regard to maintenance and social insurance. Since, according to available statistics, male spouses far more frequently commit severe violations of the marriage contract than female spouses, and women, due to the housekeeping and child-rearing that they undertake with far greater frequency, are significantly more often dependent on maintenance than men, an elimination of the principle of fault-based liability from Austrian divorce law would have a generally disadvantageous effect for women with regard to gender relations...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Background Male partner {{attendance}} of skilled Antenatal Care (ANC) is beneficial to improving maternal outcomes. This {{study investigated the}} level, perceived benefits and factors associated with male partner {{attendance of}} skilled ANC in a peri-urban community recovering from two decades of civil conflict. Methods This cross-sectional survey used multi-stage sampling in 12 villages of Omoro county to select 331 married male respondents aged 18 years or more, whose female spouses had childbirth within 24 {{months prior to the}} survey. A structured questionnaire elicited responses about male partner attendance of ANC during pregnancy at a public health facility as the main outcome variable. Analysis used Generalized Linear Model (GLM) in Stata version 10. 0 to obtain Prevalence Risk Ratios (PRR) for association between the binary outcome and independent factors. All factors significant at p Results Overall, 65. 4 % (95 %CI; 60. 3, 70. 5) male partners attended at least one skilled ANC visit. Mean age was 31. 9 years [SD 8. 2]. Perceived benefits of attending ANC were: HIV screening (74. 5 %), monitoring foetal growth (34 %) and identifying complications during pregnancy (18. 9 %). Factors independently associated with higher ANC attendance were: knowledge of 3 or more ANC services (adj. PRR 2. 77; 95 %CI 2. 24, 3. 42), obtaining health information from facility health workers (adj. PRR 1. 14; 95 %CI 1. 01, 1. 29) and if spouse had skilled attendance at last childbirth (adj. PRR 1. 31; 95 %CI 1. 04 - 1. 64). However, factors for low attendance were: male partners <b>intending</b> their <b>spouse</b> to carry another pregnancy (adj. PRR 0. 83; 95 %CI 0. 71, 0. 97) and living more than 5 Km from a health facility (adj. PRR 0. 83, 95 %CI 0. 70, 0. 98). Conclusions Men who were knowledgeable of ANC services, obtained health information from a health worker and whose spouses utilised skilled delivery at last pregnancy were more likely to accompany their spouses at ANC, unlike those who wanted to have more children and lived more than 5 km from the health facility. These findings suggest that empowering male partners with knowledge about ANC services may increase their ANC participation and in turn increase skilled delivery. This strategy may improve maternal health care in post conflict and resource-limited settings. </p...|$|R
40|$|Protective {{buffering}} (PB; Coyne & Smith, 1991), {{which involves}} hiding worries and concerns from one's partner, was examined {{in a sample}} of 60 congestive-heart-failure (CHF) patients and their spouses. Earlier studies suggest that PB is ironically associated with increased distress for the person who protects (actor effect) and perhaps also for the "protected" spouse (partner effect), though evidence for the latter is mixed (Suls, Green, Rose, Lounsbury, & Gorden, 1997). This study reexamined the PB-distress link, taking into account methodological variations and ambiguities in previous research, including (a) the source of PB ratings (self vs. other), (b) ratings of PB in general vs. a specific stressful situation, and (c) the actor's intentions to protect self vs. partner. In separate interviews, patients and spouses described their own and their partner's PB using Suls et al. 's revision of Coyne and Smith's PB scale; participants also completed the same 25 -item HSCL distress measure used in those studies and, for the specific stressful situation, the PANAS negative affect scale. Although PB scores showed rank-order consistency across the general and specific measurement contexts, participants reported higher mean levels of spouse-directed PB in general then in the specific stressful situation. Strikingly, perceptions of one's partner's PB correlated more highly with the respondent's own PB than with PB reported by the partner (suggesting a possible projective process). As in previous studies, data from both patients and spouses revealed intrapersonal associations between PB and distress (actor effects) when these constructs were assessed in general. A somewhat different picture emerged, however, for the recalled specific situation, where partner effects of both PB behavior and protective intentions were implicated more clearly in participant distress. Exploratory analyses also identified marital quality as a potential moderator of links between spouse PB and patient distress: Among couples reporting lower marital quality, for example, patient distress was ironically elevated when <b>spouses</b> <b>intended</b> to protect the patient more than themselves. Overall, the results highlighted the importance of measurement specificity in studying PB and its association with psychological distress...|$|R
40|$|Thesis {{abstract}} Judicial Control of Private Autonomy in Separation and Divorce 	The theme herein examined {{is that of}} {{the discipline}} of estate relationships between spouses during the breakdown phase of marriage, when the interest in settling the state of the personal separation or mending the effects of marriage dissolution arises. Beginning from the consideration that in our system separation and divorce are necessarily obtained through recourse to the judicial authority, the investigative perspective must therefore be that of verifying the relationship between the controlling power of the judge and the spouses’ power over their own estate. In other words, the said research intends to identify the limits of spousal private autonomy with respect to the judicial intervention. 	Following such logic, the basis of the norms upon which rests the actors’ right to establish contractual agreements that define the crisis itself is examined. Moreover, a brief survey of the civil code norms is permitted, norms which recognise the great availability spousal power in the healthy phase of marriage, as well as reference to the new constitutional foundation of the family, which continues to designate greater space to the forming of contractual agreements in the family sphere. It also became apparent that if the necessary location for the autonomous negotiations of the spouses is the trial, this depends on the fact that in our system, notwithstanding attempts by the doctrine to substantiate its validity, prenuptial agreements are not permitted, that is, agreements between <b>spouses</b> <b>intended</b> to privately and pre-emptively order the effects of separation and divorce. Unlike Common Law Countries which allow prenuptial agreements in contemplation of divorce, the Italian Supreme Court declares them null and void for reason of unlawful cause. For this reason, all legislative proposals that advocate such an introduction of prenuptial agreements with modification to the civil code have been examined. 	The investigation of the relationship between judicial control and private autonomy of the spouses has been articulated in two sections. 	The first develops the theme while considering the situation in which, despite being in conflict with one another, the spouses reach a consensual separation (or divorce {{in the case of a}} combined request). Once the function and structure of the particular proceedings related to separation and divorce have been clarified (necessary elements of the status), associated with the essential characteristic of being voluntary judicial proceedings, one reaches the first conclusion which is that in this setting the margins of private autonomy externalisation are very broad. For this reason, they are permitted to establish real and proper contracts, conferring or establishing rights with which one carries out estate settlement directed towards regulating the rights and obligations which arise from separation and divorce. In this setting particular focus was given to the agreements deriving from real estate conveyances (or the establishment of property rights), both between the spouses as well as for the benefit of minor children, confronting problems related to the formal appropriateness of the separation record, and its appropriateness in constituting title for the deed registration. Other than the formal aspect the more complex theme of the causal justification of the conveyances and the assignments between spouses in the trial setting was examined. The doctrinal contributions to the notion of cause of contract, even in the light of the most recent theories were analysed, as well as the jurisprudence standing, one which has finally recognized an anonymity under the causal profile in such a conferment. The generally notable matter within the discipline which is connected to this particular case is present under the fiscal profile as well, that being the facilitation of applicable taxation dependent on the link between the acts of title conferment and transfer, and the “cause of divorce and separation”. 	Aside from looking at the acts of title conferment and transfer, the research has pondered other types of negotiation acts and other institutions used to define the crisis with the aim of guaranteeing the fulfillment of alimony and child support obligations. Divorce Court decrees which brought acts such as the ex art. 2645 ter c. c. into effect were examined, on the presumption that the foundation of the obligation correspond to the interests of worthy expenses. Attempts have also been made to explain the reasons for which the estate fund institution 167 c. c., despite displaying ties relating to real estate, registered property and credit documents in the interest of the family, is insufficient in satisfying the needs that arise in the breakdown phase of marriage. One needs only think of the fact that the fund ceases with the divorce and that even if it does not dissolve with the separation it remains difficult to ponder joint spousal administration with the best interests of the family in mind, a family which is suffering conflict at such a point of disintegration. Upon these bases the institution of the trust in common law has also been examined, one through which the settlor transfers the title of goods to a trustee who administers and manages it in the interest of a beneficiary. The trustee thus becomes the owner, whose ownership of the conferred goods in trust remains separate and unaffected by the executive actions of the personal creditors of the trustee. A situation arises in which the formal owner is the trustee, while the corresponding rights to the property are held by the beneficiary. These essential characteristics always increasingly justify the undertaking of the institution in the area of family crises in which the duty to deliver could be functional both for the obligation of alimony payments, as well as for guaranteeing the habitable destination of the family property in the interests of the children. Even with reference to the act of constitution of the trust the judge explains its control function while evaluating the respect for the imperative norms of domestic law at the time of constitution. 	The second part of the research is instead concentrated on the hypothesis that when the spouses in conflict do not reach an agreement on the definition of the estate relationships between them, the judge must adopt all the measures of which art. 155 speaks: custody; support (for the children as well as for the spouse). In this case the judicial protection of rights expands to define every necessary and relevant question with regards the new separation regime of the family is dissolution. The measures of judicial authority are adopted according to the mechanisms of contentious proceedings, and are subject to the rules of customary procedure after an initial judge-presided phase that allows for the adoption of temporary and urgent measures that remain in place until the final decision is made. Given the juridical and social relevance of the ‘family home’, the research has concentrated in particular on the presumptions, nature and the effects of the measures regarding the assignment of the spousal home in the case of legal separation, ex art. 155 quarter cc [...] Since it is a measure with the function of protecting the minors in custody, and is of a financial nature, its indirect effects on the regulation of the economic relationship between the parents by the judge in the contentious separation have been considered. 	Lastly, with the prospect of verifying the relationship between judicial protection of the family home and the negotiating power of the property’s legal owner, apart from the particular case in which the deed of assignment intervenes following the conferment – a case which is resolvable according to the rules of registration – the problems related to the efficiency of the legal assignment with respect to the legal relationships already in existence for the house that is used as the family residence have been examined. The common hypothesis {{is that of the}} house being ceded on loan by the parents who are legal owners to the child while they live with the family. However, a crisis then emerges and so contentious separation proceedings occur and the judge assigns the wife exclusive enjoyment of the property since she holds custody of the minor child ex art. 155 quater c. c [...] The theme has been confronted on the basis of the most recent guidance of the Supreme Court after the intervention of United Sectors in 2004. ...|$|R
