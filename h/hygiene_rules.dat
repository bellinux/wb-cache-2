In 1848, maritime laws imposing <b>hygiene</b> <b>rules</b> were adopted and they improved on-board living conditions. Gradually, two distinct classes were developed: the cabin class and the steerage class. The passengers traveling on the former were wealthy passengers and they enjoyed certain comfort in that class.

40|$|The risk of {{antibiotic}} use in food animals for purposes other that disease treatment is receiving renewed scrutiny. In the U.

However, every risk assessment is likely to calculate some level of risk, albeit extremely low. Society and regula-tors are not generally willing to permit or accept additional risk, unless there is some benefit. Is it possible that this perceived “risky activity ” of food animal antibiotic use could decrease con-sumer risk? What if it reduced the burden of human illness associated with meat-borne bacteria such as Salmonella or Campylobacter? What if healthier animals resulted in healthier meat, milk and eggs? Clearly, society has a longstanding belief in the benefits of consuming healthy animals, demonstrated in meat <b>hygiene</b> inspection <b>rules</b> dating back to 1914 in the U. S. How could the use {{of antibiotic}}s decrease Salmonella and Campylobacter rates on carcasses and meat, thereby decreasing human risk?

5000|$|In early 1962, Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) {{engineers}} {{began work}} on the Apollo navigation system. The engineers' starting point was MIT's revolutionary guidance system, which included gyroscopes and instruments for measuring changes in direction. The guidance system was high mechanical technology, like the precision parts in a watch. MIT. engineers, students and staff, led by Dr. Charles Stark Draper, {{worked closely with the}} Waltham Watch Company. The MIT team learned how to work with high precision machining while under the operation and direction of military contractor Raytheon Space and Information Systems Division Waltham Operations. [...] Mechanical gyroscopes, spinning with ever-higher precision, very low friction, and very low wear, required the utmost accuracy and absence of even the most minute defect. Nobody had ever tried to manufacture precision instruments that would work with such accuracy before the Waltham team. It is said that the <b>hygiene</b> and cleanliness <b>rules</b> of the team were so strict that women were not allowed to wear makeup and if someone had just come back from a sunny vacation, they were forbidden to work near the assembly area for fear that they could have skin flaking off from their suntans.|$|R
40|$|I {{have chosen}} the topic primary {{prevention}} in dental care because I was interested in it and I {{think it is very}} up to date. Dental care has been under sustainable development and research provides new trends in this range. It is difficult for either dentists or patients to watch this development and notice everything what is new. Primary prevention in the dental care is a system of measures performed to stop creation of teeth and dental adnexa diseases. As primary prevention we consider health education, dental <b>hygiene,</b> keeping <b>rules</b> of healthy nutrition. The research work was focused on parents of young children who gather their relationship to the dental care and whose consistent training may influence their attitude for the whole life. The aim of my work was q To investigate parents knowledge of the prevention of dental deseases at children" and q To investigate the attitude of parents to the prevention of dental deseases at children". To realize my aims I used the technique of questionnaires. The research group was formed by parents of children in kinder gardens in České Budějovice. My research work was based on three hypotheses:" Parents are informed about the prevention of dental deseases at their children", qParents teach their children how to perform the dental hygiene", and qParents visit the dentist with the children since their three years age". All three hypotheses were partly proved. Parents knowledge should be focused mainly on basic equipment for cleaning, using correct technique of cleaning teeth and preventive examinations. This information should be provided by medics in surgeries, via leaflets, magazines, preventive programmes or TV programmes. Parents should take care about the teeth of their children since their infant age, motivate their children to the dental care, search for new information and visit a dentist with their children regularly. Both goals were accomplished. Results of this research work may be used in the practical life as a base for further research work. They may also be used for creation of information material or programmes to support preventive dental care. Kinder gardens where this research work was performed will be informed about the results and they can use it for creation or improvement of the dental care programmes...|$|R

40|$|Abstract: The {{researches}} were effectuated on primipara {{sheep and}} goats originating from flocks in which somatic cell number in bulk collected milk was higher than 1, 000, 000 cells/ml. During lactation the number of somatic cells was determined through the rapid electronic flour optic method SR ISO 13366 - 3 / 2001. In the situations in which the limit of 750, 000 somatic cells/ml was exceeded {{as well as at}} the end of lactation we gathered milk samples. These samples were used to verify through bacteriological examination if the animals had an infection and if so of which origin (Staphylococcus aureus, Stafilococi non aureus or other germs). In 126 sheep and 94 goats diagnosed with subclinical mastitis, after weaning, we performed a treatment with Orbenin Extra (600 mg Cloxacillin “Dynomilled”) administers intramammary following the last milking. We administered a syringe for each half of the mammary gland, respecting the <b>hygiene</b> and administration <b>rules,</b> avoiding iatrogenic mastitis. In the following lactation we gathered milk samples (a mix from the two mammas) for the determination of somatic cells number and for the bacteriological exam, with diagnostic purpose. The results were compared to those obtained at the same number of sheep and goat (witness lot), selected on the same criteria, which were not treated. Healing percentage, in case of the treated animals, was of 78. 57 % in sheep and 70. 21 % in goats, and spontaneous healing percent in non treated animals was of 23. 02 % in sheep and 19. 15 in goats...|$|R
40|$|Fluids {{produced}} from oil or gasfields and aquifers are naturally radioactive {{due to the}} presence of potassium- 40 and isotopes from decay chains of uranium- 238 and thorium- 232 in these reservoirs. Thus, natural radionuclides can be carried away towards surface when petroleum or geothermal reservoirs are drilled and produced. These radio- nuclides can precipitate in deposits forming in process equipment, which can then be unusually radioactive, expose workers to hazardous materials and create waste disposal problems. Workers can also be exposed to high concentrations of radon. Due to their natural origin, these accumulations of radionuclides in equipment are called Naturally Occurring Radioactive Materials (NORM). They are also known as TENORM, because they are technologically enhanced. In closed systems, exposition to gamma radiations penetrating equipment to the external surface can be reduced by restricting and controlling access to appropriate areas. But personnel may come into direct contact with NORM during maintenance and cleaning operations, when opening equipment and vessels. In France, <b>hygiene</b> and safety <b>rules</b> concerning the protection of workers in the petroleum and geothermal industries are formulated in a speciac legislation related to extraction and mining. Presently, both petroleum and geothermal industries are not included in the list of activities which have to follow radioprotection measures given by this legislation. French authorities are currently planning to update the list by including these two activities. There is a real need to realize a state-of-the art of the exposition level of French workers and to match the dose limits to those given by the Labor and Public Health Codes. This paper will present the origin of NORM and radon contamination in the petroleum and geothermal industries and discuss the French legislation evolution for the radioprotection of personnel working in these two industrie...|$|R

However, patient's adherence to long-term treatment is quite low [1]. Collaborative with healthcare providers, the pharmaceutical intervention already showed impact on drug therapy (pharmaceutical care concept). This concept is established in Canada for a long time, and begin to emerge in Europe [2]. ObjectiveTo develop pharmaceutical interviews with stroke survivors in hospital, and to bring this approach to community pharmacies. MethodsIndividual semi-guided interviews were conducted in two steps: (a) evaluation of patient's knowledge, skills and self-care; (b) providing appropriate structured information according to patient's needs. For (a) a specific questionnaire incorporating problems relating to generic drugs and hygiene and dietary follow-up was developed; educational tools were used for (b) : picture book, packages of drugs. At {{the end of the}} interview, information sheets and a management plan “how to take treatments” were given. This approach, developed in neurological rehabilitation unit, was then used in community pharmacy with ambulatory patients to test practicability of the method. ResultsA total of 26 interviews were conducted: 20 inpatients and 6 outpatients. (a) The level of drug knowledge varies and no {{difference between the two groups}} was observed. Some notions are well known such as treatment start-up date (respectively 85 and 83 %), management plan of treatments (60 and 67 %). On the other hand, therapeutic indication of treatment (40 and 33 %), what to do in risk situations (37 and 33 %) or in the case of adverse event (11 and 0 %), and <b>hygiene</b> and dietetic <b>rules</b> (45 and 33 %) were less known. (b) Patients were very satisfied with the counselling interview. DiscussionInterviews with ambulatory patients confirmed the feasibility of this approach first developed at the hospital.

40|$|Schools are {{the leading}} {{shareholders}} which present appropriate opportunities for equipping the students with healthynutritional habits, promoting children's health in terms of food and nutrition contents, nutrition services, the personnel, peerinteraction, school-based nutrition projects and policies. Nutrition, which is an area, related to science, health, nature, social andeducational sciences, overlaps with the learning fields of the Life Science course a core course {{for the first three}} years of theprimary school in Turkey. The determination of the current situation of food and nutrition related concepts, acquisitions andactivities in the primary school curriculum are significant in terms of school and program-based nutrition education. For thisreason, the aim of the present research is to analyze the current situation of primary school 1 st- 3 rd Grade Life Science coursecurriculum in terms of correspondence with nutrition-related themes, course acquisitions, activity samples, sub-disciplineacquisitions. The data source of the present research which adopted document analysis, a qualitative research design, comprises"T. R. Ministry of National Education Head Council of Education and Morality Primary School 1 st, 2 nd, and 3 rd Grade Life ScienceCurriculum and Guide". The related document was scanned for food and nutrition terms determined as the units of analysis, andthe words food, drink, health, consumer, and consumption were traced in order to make a more comprehensive screening; thecurrent situation of the related concepts, themes, course acquisitions, and their correspondence with sub-discipline acquisitionswere examined. As a result of the analysis, the obtained contents were transformed into tables according to class levels andthemes. In the tables, the acquisitions and activity examples related with the analysis unit were presented, accompanied by directquotations. According to the obtained findings, it was determined that in the Life Science curriculum, nutrition related skills wereincorporated within the scope of Using the Resources Effectively and Promotion of Safety and Protection. The nutrition relatedskills of paying attention to foods and drinks, keeping away from unpacked foods, preference for milk, ayran, and natural fruitjuice instead of fizzy drinks, consuming snacks less, having home-made natural foods and fresh fruits in the lunch box wereincorporated under the title Using the Resources Effectively-Being a Conscientious Consumer. As for the fact that well-balancedand regular eating skills and nutrition are essential needs, they were included in Promotion of Safety and Protection andProtecting the Health skill. The fact that nutrition-related skills were under the title "Using the Resources Effectively" issignificant in terms of using the nutritional resources effectively and appropriately and emphasizing the consumability of the foodresources. The necessity of a balanced and regular nutrition for protecting the health, for which nutrition is an essential life need, was incorporated in Maintaining Safety and Protection- skill may be considered as an opportunity for creating the interactionbetween nutrition and health among children. It was also determined that, in the Life Science syllabus, the use of necessary toolsand materials for nutrition were included as one of the personal characteristics to equip the students with [...] socialization. It wasdetermined that food and nutrition-related acquisitions in the Life Science curriculum were related to different disciplines. It wasdocumented that the course acquisitions in the curriculum corresponded to Health Culture Acquisitions and Guidance andPsychological Counseling Acquisitions as sub-discipline acquisitions. In the program it was also determined that three healthculture acquisitions were incorporated: explaining the significance of nutrition for growth and health, acquiring regular nutritionhabits, paying attention to a balanced diet. Within Guidance and Psychological Counseling Acquisitions developing daily life skills(hygiene, nutrition, address, and telephone) were ascertained. Another finding was that in the Life Science program, food andnutrition related acquisitions were included. These were "understands that such changes are natural by comparing and contrastingthe foods and drinks, the games and toys consumed as a baby and infant; consumes natural and healthy products for a balancedand regular nutrition; investigates why a balanced and regular nutrition is necessary and explains the relationship between healthygrowth and development, personal care, sports, balanced and regular nutrition. Complies with <b>hygiene</b> and etiquette <b>rules</b> in thenutrition hour, investigates how the living things are fed, discriminates between what to do before and after the food hour andexhibits behaviors appropriate to etiquette, investigates and tells why it is necessary to feed in a balanced and regular fashion,explains the relationship between healthy growth and development, personal care, sports, and balanced and regular nutrition,explains the reasons for the etiquette rules to be obeyed”. Examples in which the food and nutrition acquisitions in thecurriculum were related to other science fields were observed. The acquisition of "Understands the freezing, boiling, melting,vaporization events by observing how the elderly cook in the kitchen" was an example of a family-included activity while theacquisition of "investigates the differences in the nutrition, clothing and play styles of children from different countries" can begiven as an example of Life Science related acquisition. It was understood that the acquisitions in the program were reinforced bymeans of activities like "Bon Appetite, What's up in the Kitchen?, We Should [...] . and We shouldn't [...] ., I Have a Balanced Diet, TheFood Game is on the Table, Peace for Countries, I'm Starving" and methods like music, games, visual arts, story, drama, physicaleducation, research, interview, inviting an expert. An analysis of the document for the presence of food and nutrition relatedconcepts showed that the nutrition concept was incorporated in School Anxiety theme in the first grade. In conclusion, it wasdetermined that within the scope of themes like My School Anxiety, My Unique Home, Yesterday, Today and Tomorrowconcepts, acquisitions, skills and activities were incorporated in 1 st- 3 rd grade primary school curriculum. The fact that nutritionrelatedthemes were incorporated in the first years of the primary school curriculum is a significant step in terms of forming thefoundations for nutrition education and nutrition literacy. It is thought that attracting shareholders' attention to the fact that foodand nutrition-related skills, acquisitions and activities could be regarded as a significant opportunity for school-based nutritioneducation will be useful. In-service trainings may prove beneficial for class teachers in terms of increasing their knowledge onfoods and nutrition related skills, acquisitions, activities and supporting theoretical knowledge with workshops in such trainingswill contribute to the functionality of the education. In-service training which focuses on the necessity and methodology ofdeveloping students' nutritional knowledge, attitudes and behaviors may encourage class teachers about carrying out nutritionaleducation, increase their interest and knowledge of nutrition related skills, acquisitions and activities in the primary schoolcurriculum. In the in-set trainings the acquisitions and activities in the current programs could be considered and the theoreticalknowledge could be supported with workshops, and different educational methods, practical exercises could be implemented. Inthe school age period, the nutrition related acquisitions and activities in the primary school 1 - 3 rd grade Life Science curriculummust be monitored and developed in line with the scientific and technological advances and the related acquisitions must beincorporated in the curriculum supported by teacher-student-parent opinions so as to develop students' knowledge, attitudes andskills for a healthy nutrition. The present research is restricted to the 1 st- 3 rd grade Life Science syllabus and guide and the futurestudies might investigate different courses, documents, and the curricula of different grades. In addition, research whichinvestigates the applicability of food and nutrition-related acquisitions and activities, their appropriateness to the student's level,student and teacher opinions and general problems might be carried out...|$|R

Information on compliance with <b>hygiene</b> <b>rules,</b> demographic variables, sector of activity and long-term medication was collected by anonymous questionnaire. The participation rate was 32. 3 %. In total, 176 subjects from 34 countries were included in the analysis. S. aureus was isolated from the nasal swabs of 57 (32. 4 %) subjects, of whom 3 (5. 3 %) harbored MRSA strains. Overall, 123 subjects reported working in microbiology laboratories with direct manipulation of S. aureus, and 29 acknowledged regular contacts with patients. In this exposed population, hydro-alcoholic solutions appeared to have a significant protective effect against nasal S. aureus carriage (OR =  0. 36; 95 % CI: 0. 15 - 0. 85).

Regular or temporary loss of bowel {{control is a}} prominent feature {{of the disease and}} may lead to stigmatisation through infringement of social <b>hygiene</b> <b>rules.</b> Although stigma in IBD has been measured in quantitative studies, there is a dearth of qualitative evidence. This Heideggerian (hermeneutic) phenomenological study explores the lived experience of IBD-related stigma. Using purposive stratified sampling, 40 members of a national IBD charity were recruited. Participants did or did not experience faecal incontinence, and did or did not feel stigmatised. Unstructured individual interviews (digitally recorded and professionally transcribed) took place in consenting participants’ homes between May and November 2012. Data were analysed using Diekelmann’s hermeneutic method. Seven relational themes (present in some transcripts) and three constitutive patterns (present in all transcripts) emerged. IBD-related stigma is a complex experience, mostly of anticipated or perceived stigma, which often decreases over time. Stigma changes according to social settings and relationships, but arises from the challenges the disease presents in maintaining social privacy and <b>hygiene</b> <b>rules.</b> Stigma resilience appears most likely in those with a positive sense of control, a support network (particularly of close and intimate others) which suits their needs, and mastery over life and illness.

The proportion of dentists giving postoperative-advices regarding the disposal of tampon and giving special postoperative-advices to patients with blood-transmitted diseases increased slightly after education, which means most dentists did not pay enough attention to these issues (Elkarim et al. 2004; Porter 1991).

40|$|Purpose. To {{report the}} risk of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) ocular {{infection}} after UVA-riboflavin corneal collagen cross-linking in a patient with atopic dermatitis. Methods. A 22 -year-old man, with bilateral evolutive keratoconus and atopic dermatitis, underwent UVA-riboflavin corneal cross-linking and presented with rapidly progressive corneal abscesses and cyclitis in the treated eye five days after surgery. The patient {{was admitted to the}} hospital and treated with broad-spectrum antimicrobic therapy. Results. The patient had positive cultures for MRSA, exhibiting a strong resistance to antibiotics. Antibiotic therapy was modified and targeted accordingly. The intravitreal reaction is extinguished, but severe damage of ocular structures was unavoidable. Conclusion. Riboflavin/UVA corneal cross-linking is considered a safe procedure and is extremely effective in halting keratoconus' progression. However, this procedure is not devoid of infectious complications, due to known risk factors and/or poor patients' hygiene compliance in the postoperative period. Atopic dermatitis is a common disease among patients with keratoconus and Staphylococcus aureus colonization is commonly found in patients with atopic dermatitis.

Objectives: In this pilot study we investigated the effect of having to sleep at an abnormal circadian time on sleep duration. Patients and Methods: Eight runners and two cyclists performing a 500 km relay race were followed. They were divided into two groups that took turns in running and resting. Each group ran four times for approximately five hours while the other group slept. As a result, sleep times varied between normal and abnormal times. All athletes wore actigraphs to record the duration and onset of sleep. Results: Linear mixed model analyses showed that athletes slept on average 43 minutes longer when they slept during usual (night) times than during abnormal (day) times. In general, sleep duration decreased during the race with on average 18 minutes per period. Conclusions: This pilot study shows that, even under extreme violation of sleep <b>hygiene</b> <b>rules,</b> there still is an apparent effect of circadia...|$|E
40|$|In this research, {{the effect}} of gender on {{fast-food}} consumption has been studied to determine fast-food consumption habits with a survey given to 900 people including Tekirdag city centre {{high school students and}} Namık Kemal University students. Also, the relationship between fast-food consumption and overweight, and whether the students have trust for hygiene applications of fast food producing and service enterprises has been studied. 900 people in total were involved in this research (459 females and 441 males). According to the results of the survey, a significant relationship between gender and fast-food choice type, portion size, consumption frequency, trust for complying <b>hygiene</b> <b>rules,</b> the need of being informed about food security, being affected by commercials, food poisoning and the reaction to it, and not consuming fast-food has been found. Many Turkish adolescents are becoming increasingly more westernized and have greater convenience when they eat out. Fast-food type nutrition which is popular among children and teenagers contains deficient or excess nutrients. High schools and universities are appropriate establishments for students to gain correct nutritional habits. This research has been planned to determine fast-food preferences of different gender...|$|E
40|$|This work {{investigates the}} Volatile Organic Compounds (VOCs) {{emissions}} during {{the processing of}} composite of polyamide 6 (PA) bio-filled with technical lignin. This is of prime interest as volatile phenolic structural monomers issued from lignin could penetrate the human organism and cause undesirable health damages. A special attention {{is given to the}} measurement of formaldehyde as it is known to be a human carcinogen. Lignin main identified emission consists of a high level of formaldehyde and a large amount of complex substituted phenol and benzene, all representative and constitutive of its structure. Regarding the PA alone, it has been found that the predominant VOC product is ϵ-caprolactam. When filling PA 6 with lignin, the emitted VOCs associated to this filler are mainly produced during the extrusion while, only traces are detected during the injection process. Formaldehyde emission level is three times higher during the injection than during the extrusion. Phenols and some remaining reactants used during industrial cellulosic extraction process are identified. Regarding the value of the Short-Term Exposure Limit (STEL), suitable industrial process, safety and <b>hygiene</b> <b>rules</b> must be adopted. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

40|$|We {{report a}} case of Pasteurella multocida {{meningitis}} in a 1 -month-old baby exposed to close contact with two dogs and a cat but without any known history of injury by these animals. 16 S rRNA gene sequencing of the isolate from the baby allowed identification at the subspecies level {{and pointed to the}} cat as a possible source of infection. Molecular typing of Pasteurella isolates from the animals, from the baby, and from unrelated animals clearly confirmed that the cat harbored the same P. multocida subsp. septica strain on its tonsils as the one isolated from the cerebrospinal fluid of the baby. This case stresses the necessity of informing susceptible hosts at risk of contracting zoonotic agents about some basic <b>hygiene</b> <b>rules</b> when keeping pets. In addition, this study illustrates the usefulness of molecular methods for identification and epidemiological tracing of Pasteurella isolates. A previously healthy 1 -month-old baby from a rural area of Switzerland was admitted to the pediatric ward of the local hospital in the winter of 1998 to 1999. The baby presented with an irritable state, a temperature of 39 °C, and signs of slightly increased intracranial pressure. A lumbar puncture was per-formed, and the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) was positive for numerous polymorphonuclear leukocytes and small gram-neg...|$|E
40|$|Infectious {{diseases}} {{are a very}} hot topic nowadays in society. In recent years, there were several epidemics, infectious diseases (hepatitis A, Avian influenza, pandemic influenza A) and nobody knows when will the next "new" infection. At the outbreak of epidemics, there is great interest in the company to obtain information about the disease, but often also to unnecessary panic, because the media often publish incorrect information. It would be preferable, {{in order to improve}} public awareness and prevent the unnecessary spread of disease. Great emphasis should be given to prevent the disease - primarily on immunization, <b>hygiene</b> <b>rules</b> and principles of safe sex. Quality information should be mainly from teachers in teaching their pupils, as is clear from research books, infectious {{diseases are}} only mentioned in textbooks and the number of substantive information in them is missing. The fact that pupils of primary schools and grammar schools with basic information on infectious diseases do not meet in the classroom, evidenced by the results of a survey carried out in the 6 th classes and first year at selected elementary schools and grammar schools in Prague. To raise awareness of the pupils in school was to create a methodical manual for teachers, which summarizes information about bacterial and [...] ...|$|E
40|$|Following the {{suspicion}} that salad cultivated in the German state of Hessen could have {{come into contact with}} EHEC pathogens from a neighbouring stream of flowing waters, samples were taken from these flowing waters and analysed. The Hessian Ministry of Social Affairs and the Hessian Ministry of Environmental Affairs, Agriculture and Consumer Protection communicated that the EHEC pathogen O 104 :H 4 was detected in this water sample. Fur-thermore, the ministries pointed out that an outbreak of EHEC infections had been attribut-able after a celebration to foods which were contaminated by humans. The National Refer-ence Laboratory for E. coli at BfR has confirmed the detections of EHEC O 104 :H 4. Whether and to what extent the EHEC pathogen O 104 :H 4 can be found in streams of flowing waters could not yet be clarified. A risk of disease by contact with water from surface waters which is influenced by the effluents of waste water treatment plants exists. It is known that EHEC pathogens can be transmitted by smear infections but this can be avoided by the observance of <b>hygiene</b> <b>rules.</b> For the protection against infections BfR rec-ommends, therefore, to comply with general hygiene measures during the preparation of foods and refers to the BfR leaflet “Protection against food infections in private households”...|$|E
40|$|Abstract: At {{the end of}} {{the first}} year of both French medical and dental studies, a four-week {{rotation}} in a hospital department has been implemented to introduce preclinical students to hospital life. The aims of this study were to analyze the scope of this training period and to determine dental students ’ perceptions of how they benefited from this hospital experience. All registered second-year dental students belonging to four successive cohorts were enrolled in the study (n= 161). They were asked to complete two questionnaires, one immediately at {{the end of the}} course, the second one in the final year of dental studies. The former questionnaire assessed what had been accomplished during the hospital rotation; the latter evaluated the impact of the course on dental studies. Good implementation of <b>hygiene</b> <b>rules</b> (77. 7 percent) and washing hands (75. 5 percent), communication with patients (67. 5 percent), carrying out injections (53. 5 percent), and performing easy nursing care (53. 2 percent) seemed to be the most useful practices that helped students all through their dental education. The majority of students (70. 7 percent) judged the course useful and necessary for dental studies. For 70 percent, however, the hospital rotation was too long, and these students recommended shortening the program. The usefulness of such an experience depends a lot upon the supervision that the student received...|$|E
