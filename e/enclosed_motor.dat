The aforementioned trials took place in November 2008, out of MUN/MI 2 ̆ 019 s Holyrood facility, located {{on the north side of}} South Arm, Holyrood Bay, opposite the marina. To fully test the performance of the modified lifeboat, a number of open water tests were performed. These included both non-standard turning circles and collision avoidances. The raw data from the trials initially had to be calibrated, using a calibration file and in-house software called IOTDataLoggerCal. Once each file had been calibrated, it was loaded into IGOR, an integrated program for visualizing, analyzing, transforming and presenting data. Data analysis proved that there is a much smaller diameter for the port side turns than there is for the starboard turns. When comparing upwind and downwind turns the results seemed to be extremely varied, indicating that the direction of travel in terms of wind direction had no significant effect on turn diameter. The initial speeds, speed during the turns, and final speed varied slightly for each trial and this may mislead the comparison. The plots of Turn Diameter verses Rudder Angle indicated that as the rudder angle used in the turn increased, the turn diameter decreased. Peer reviewed: NoNRC publication: Ye...|$|E

All testing was completed in conditions that were consistent with those that might be experienced by ship or offshore oil and gas crewmembers in the event of abandonment due to an onboard emergency. Results indicated that the lifeboat test configuration presented considerable challenges to usability/functionality as well as habitability. These findings suggest that further research should be conducted to evaluate the safety of all existing lifeboat designs.

40|$|Compared to {{a number}} of other {{existing}} correlations for heat transfer, the empirical correlations for forced convection from a short horizontal cylinder in axial air-flows usually do not involve the effects of changes in air-flow velocity and/or air-flow turbulence. Therefore, a common analysis of the heat transfer by using only one energy balance equation for entire outer surface of a solid is considered insufficient for induction motor applications because it fails to include aforementioned effects. This paper presents a novel, empirically-based methodology to estimate approximately the values of air-flow velocities and turbulence factors, that is, velocity profiles and turbulence factor models for stationary horizontal cylinders with and without fins (frame and two end-shields) in axial air-flows. These velocity profiles and turbulence factor models can then be used in analytical modelling of steady-state heat transfer from the exterior of totally <b>enclosed</b> fan-cooled induction <b>motors...</b>|$|R

40|$|Abstract — In {{developing}} {{electric motors}} {{in general and}} induction motors in particular temperature limit is a key factor affecting {{the efficiency of the}} overall design. Since conventional loading of induction motors is often expensive, the estimation of temperature rise by tools of mathematical modeling becomes increasingly important. Excepting for providing a more accurate representation of the problem, the proposed model can also reduce computing costs. The paper develops a three-dimensional transient thermal model in polar co-ordinates using finite element formulation and arch shaped elements. A temperature-time method is employed to evaluate the distribution of loss {{in various parts of the}} machine. Using these loss distributions as an input for finite element analysis, more accurate temperature distributions can be obtained. The model is applied to predict the temperature rise in the stator of a squirrel cage 7. 5 kW totally <b>enclosed</b> fan-cooled induction <b>motor.</b> The temperature distribution has been determined considering convection from the back of core surface, outer air gap surface and annular end surface of a totally enclosed structure...|$|R

This testing {{was part of a}} multi-year trials program, conducted by the National Research Council (NRC), which aims to investigate design considerations for a conventional TEMPSC operating in ice. During the March 2013 testing campaign, the TEMPSC was equipped with a side impact panel and bow visor, both instrumented with load cells to measure local ice impact forces. The resulting local ice load measurements taken during this field trials campaign are presented and the operational performance is discussed. This was the first year during the trials campaign in which local loads on the stem were measured and recorded. The results of this set of field trials could be useful to support the implementation of new TEMPSC design considerations to allow for better performance in harsh, northern conditions. It could also provide operational insight to promote more effective and low stress navigation through ice conditions. Peer reviewed: YesNRC publication: Ye...|$|E

The experiments involved the investigation of the performance of the evacuation system in seas ranging from Beaufort 0 (calm) to Beaufort 8 (fresh gale) equivalent. Particular attention was focused on the effects of TEMPSC loading conditions (either 100 % or 70 % capacity), TEMPSC orientation, intact versus damaged installation, direction of weather relative to launch, use of flexible boom or davit system alone, wave type (regular or irregular) and wave steepness.

The existing correlations for forced convection from a short horizontal cylinder and correlations for heat transfer from straight fins (as well as inter-fin surfaces) in axial air-flows are modified by introducing the Prandtl number to the appropriate power. The correlations for forced convection from straight fins and inter-fin surfaces are derived from the existing ones for combined heat transfer (due to forced convection and radiation) by using the forced-convection correlations for a single flat plate.
