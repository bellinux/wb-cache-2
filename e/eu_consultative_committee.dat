40|$|The European Commission {{has stated}} {{that it does not}} support a European {{definition}} of fuel poverty, and that a common definition would be inappropriate due to the diverse energy contexts found across the European Union. Using official EU policy documents from 2001 to 2014, this paper will demonstrate that contrary to the European Commission’s stance, many of the <b>EU</b> institutions and <b>consultative</b> <b>committees</b> are in favour of a common European definition of fuel poverty, and have been arguing {{for the establishment of a}} definition for at least seven years. This paper will argue that a definition is vital for raising the profile of fuel poverty and ensuring it is recognised as a policy issue by all Member States of the EU, particularly at a time of rising energy prices, stagnating wages and growing concerns about energy security and climate change...|$|R
40|$|The {{role of the}} European Parliament (EP) {{under the}} consul-tation {{procedure}} has been widely neglected by rational choice models of legislative decision-making in the European Union (EU). This paper offers {{a new understanding of}} the procedure by means of a computational model in which lobbyists provide legislators with policy options. Transaction costs of assimilating information lead to rationing of access to the agenda-setter (i. e. the Commission). In this context, consultation converts the EP into an indirect channel to the agenda-setter for some lobbyists. I argue that the resulting pool of policy options, together with the right to be heard by the Commission and the latter’s degree of rational ignorance, provides the EP with a legislative power that the literature has not so far recognized. The implications of this finding extend to other legislative procedures of the <b>EU</b> and to <b>consultative</b> <b>committees</b> in other political systems...|$|R
