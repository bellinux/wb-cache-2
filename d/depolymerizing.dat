40|$|AbstractHigh-molecular-weight [14 C]hyaluronate was {{incubated}} with cultured fibroblasts {{from human}} uterine cervix and skin, {{and then the}} depolymerization of the hyaluronate was investigated. [14 C]Hyaluronate in the medium of skin fibroblasts was <b>depolymerized</b> into a constant molecular weight (Mr about 40, 000), whereas that of cervix fibroblasts was not <b>depolymerized,</b> irrespective of incubation period. However, when progesterone {{was added to the}} medium of cervix fibroblasts, hyaluronate was <b>depolymerized</b> to the same extent as that in skin fibroblasts. The reducing terminal sugar of the <b>depolymerized</b> hyaluronate was N-acetylglucosamine. These results suggest that a hyaluronate-depolymerizing enzyme, endo-β-N-acetylglucosaminidase, was induced by progesterone in cultured fibroblasts derived from human uterine cervix...|$|R
30|$|To {{prove that}} {{exocytosis}} had been enhanced after glucose stimulation of IPCs and beta cells, we demonstrated that without glucose stimulation, the actin network underneath the plasma membrane was continuous and dense. After glucose stimulation, the actin network <b>depolymerized</b> and became discontinuous. After F-actin depolymerization, inhibition of exocytosis was relieved and insulin secretion increased. Interestingly, in the IPCs group, the cortical actin network did not <b>depolymerize</b> in low glucose concentrations after 30 min of stimulation. The actin network became discontinuous and <b>depolymerized</b> only after low-glucose stimulation for 1 h.|$|R

40|$|A rapid {{method for}} {{measuring}} polymerized and <b>depolymerized</b> forms of tubulin in tissues has been developed. The procedure consists of homogenization and centrifugation {{of the tissue}} in a microtubule- stabilizing solution and depolymerization of the precipitated microtubules; polymerized and <b>depolymerized</b> forms of tubulin are quantitated by a colchicine-binding assay. The validity of the technique was assessed by electron microscopy and recovery studies with labeled and unlabeled preparations of polymerized and <b>depolymerized</b> forms of rat brain tubulin. The sensitivity of this technique allows quantitation of tubulin in 150 micrograms of tissue, wet weight. The method demonstrated that both the polymerized and <b>depolymerized</b> forms of tubulin were present in rat liver cells, {{and that in the}} fed state 31. 3 +/- 0. 7 % of the total tubulin pool was in the polymerized form...|$|R

50|$|The {{starting}} materials (generally sugars) {{are the most}} significant factor in the biofuel production cost. Cellulose, a potentially low-cost starting material, must be <b>depolymerized</b> into sugars by adding an expensive cocktail of enzymes. One way to reduce this cost is to engineer the fuel-producing microbe to also produce the enzymes to <b>depolymerize</b> cellulose and hemicellulose. Recently, Keasling’s laboratory demonstrated that a microorganism could be engineered to synthesize and secrete enzymes to <b>depolymerize</b> cellulose and hemicellulose into sugars and to produce a gasoline replacement (butanol), a diesel-fuel replacement (fatty acid ethyl ester), or a jet fuel replacement (pinene).|$|R

50|$|Chemical pulping {{achieves}} this by degrading the lignin and hemicellulose into small, water-soluble molecules {{which can}} be washed away from the cellulose fibres without <b>depolymerizing</b> the cellulose fibres (chemically <b>depolymerizing</b> the cellulose weakens the fibres). The various mechanical pulping methods, such as groundwood (GW) and refiner mechanical (RMP) pulping, physically tear the cellulose fibres one from another. Much of the lignin remains adhering to the fibres. Strength is impaired because the fibres may be cut. Related hybrid pulping methods {{use a combination of}} chemical and thermal treatment to begin an abbreviated chemical pulping process, followed immediately by a mechanical treatment to separate the fibres. These hybrid methods include thermomechanical pulping (TMP) and chemithermomechanical pulping (CTMP). The chemical and thermal treatments reduce the amount of energy subsequently required by the mechanical treatment, and also reduce the amount of strength loss suffered by the fibres.|$|E

40|$|International audienceDifferential {{scanning}} calorimetry measurements made at {{atmospheric pressure}} from 300 K to about 100 K above the {{glass transition temperature}} (Tg) are reported for two new series of hydrated aluminosilicate glasses and supercooled liquids for water contents between 0 and 7. 3 mol%. The compositions are synthetic iron-free analogs of tephrite and foidite lava compositions, and are <b>depolymerized</b> (NBO/T = 0. 8 and 1. 5, respectively). In all cases, water exerts a marked depressing effect on Tg, {{in close agreement with}} the results of viscosity experiments on the same samples. For glasses, the partial molar heat capacity of water previously published for polymerized compositions (Bouhifd et al., 2006) reproduces the present data within the combined uncertainties of the experimental and model values. For the hydrous silicate glasses, the partial molar heat capacity of water can be thus considered as independent of composition, and insensitive to structural factors above room temperature. However, for hydrous liquids the existing data suggest two different coefficients for polymerized and <b>depolymerized</b> melts. In <b>depolymerized</b> liquids, the partial molar heat capacity of water View the MathML sourceC¯pH 2 O (is about 237 ± 40 J/mol K, which is nearly three times higher than that previously determined for polymerized hydrous liquids View the MathML sourceC¯pH 2 O (≈ 85 J/mol K for three hydrous melts with 0 < NBO/T < 0. 2; Bouhifd et al., 2006), and more than three times that of pure liquid water at ambient conditions. From speciation data, we found that the partial molar heat capacity for hydroxyl groups in <b>depolymerized</b> melts, View the MathML sourceC¯pOH−, is about 281 ± 47 J/mol K, and that of molecular water, View the MathML sourceC¯pH 2 Omol, is about 30 ± 15 J/mol K. The present study suggests that View the MathML sourceC¯pH 2 Omol is independent of composition, but, View the MathML sourceC¯pOH− for the <b>depolymerized</b> melts is close to double the value of 153 ± 18 J/mol K previously obtained for the more polymerized melts. The present result suggests different structural roles of OH− in polymerized and <b>depolymerized</b> melts, and also the predominance of OH− species in <b>depolymerized</b> melts. This striking feature for water is discussed with reference to potential additional species in <b>depolymerized</b> melts, whose formation may have strong effects on hydrous melt properties...|$|R
5000|$|Based on {{chromatin}} immunoprecipitation (ChIP) experiments, ParB has {{the ability}} to bind not only to high-affinity parS sites but also to adjacent nonspecific DNA, a behavior known as [...] "spreading". [...] The ParB-DNA complex is thought to be translocated by a Brownian ratchet mechanism involving the ParA ATPase: ParA binds DNA nonspecifically to DNA in its ATP-bound state but much more weakly in its ADP-bound state. The ParB-DNA complex binds to ATP-bound ParA, stimulating its ATPase activity and its dissociation from DNA. In this way, the ParB-DNA complex can be translocated by chasing a receding wave or <b>depolymerizing</b> filament of DNA-bound ParA. This translocation mechanism has been observed by fluorescence microscopy both in vivo and more recently in vitro with purified components.|$|E
50|$|Because actin {{monomers}} must {{be recycled}} to sustain {{high rates of}} actin-based motility during chemotaxis, cell signalling is believed to activate cofilin, the actin-filament <b>depolymerizing</b> protein which binds to ADP-rich actin subunits nearest the filament's pointed-end and promotes filament fragmentation, with concomitant depolymerization in order to liberate actin monomers. In most animal cells, monomeric actin is bound to profilin and thymosin beta-4, both of which preferentially bind with one-to-one stoichiometry to ATP-containing monomers. Although thymosin beta-4 is strictly a monomer-sequestering protein, the behavior of profilin is far more complex. Profilin enhances the ability of monomers to assemble by stimulating the exchange of actin-bound ADP for solution-phase ATP to yield actin-ATP and ADP. Profilin is transferred to the leading edge {{by virtue of its}} PIP2 binding site, and it employs its poly-L-proline binding site to dock onto end-tracking proteins. Once bound, profilin-actin-ATP is loaded into the monomer-insertion site of actoclampin motors.|$|E
50|$|Actin binding {{proteins}} prove {{significant in}} actin remodeling, as the LIMK1/ADF/Cofilin Pathway facilitates {{the development of}} F-actin. Actin <b>Depolymerizing</b> Factor, or ADF, normally disassembles actin and {{does not allow for}} the induction of LTP. However, synaptic activity allows for the activation of LIMK1, a protein that phosphorylates the ADF/Cofilin complex at its phosphorylation site, Ser3, which inactivates the complex, allowing for the formation of F-actin. If this pathway is disrupted, then G-actin is unable to polymerize and LTP is inhibited. One particular actin binding protein that {{plays a major role in}} this pathway disruption is Gelsolin. This protein caps the barbed end of F-actin, thus blocking G-actin subunits to bind to the F-actin and allow for actin treadmilling. Activation of Gelsolin not only blocks LTP, but induces LTD. In LTD, the F to G-actin ratio is shifted towards G-actin and leads to a decrease in spine volume, as well as occasional disappearance of spines altogether.|$|E

50|$|To {{accommodate}} this activity, growth cones {{are believed}} to pool mRNAs that code for receptors and intracellular signaling proteins involved in cytoskeleton remodeling. In Xenopus retinotectal projection systems, the expression of these proteins {{has been shown to}} be influenced by guidance cues and the subsequent activation of local translation machinery. The attractive cue Netrin-1, stimulates mRNA transport and influence synthesis of β-Actin in filopodia of growth cones, to restructure and steer RGC growth cones in the direction of Netrin secretion. While the repulsive cue, Slit, is suggested to stimulate the translation of Cofilin (an actin <b>depolymerizing</b> factor) in growth cones, leading to axon repulsion. In addition, severed commissural axons in chicks, display the capability of translating and expressing Eph-A2 receptor during midline crossing. As a result, studies, suggest that local protein expression is a convenient mechanism to explain the rapid, dynamic, and autonomous nature of growth cone advancement in response to guidance molecules.|$|E
5000|$|Completion of epiboly {{requires}} {{the coordination of}} cytoskeletal changes across the embryo. The YSL appears to play {{a prominent role in}} this process. Studies on Fundulus demonstrated that the YSL is capable of undergoing epiboly even when the blastoderm has been removed, but that the blastoderm cannot undergo epiboly {{in the absence of the}} YSL. In zebrafish, there is a microtubule array in the yolk that extends from the animal to the vegetal pole of the embryo, and that contracts as epiboly progresses. Treating embryos with the microtubule <b>depolymerizing</b> agent nocodazole completely blocks epiboly of the YSL and partially blocks epiboly of the blastoderm, while treating with the microtubule stabilizing agent taxol blocks epiboly of all cell layers. There is also evidence for the importance of actin-based structures in epiboly. Ring-like structures of filamentous actin have been observed at the leading edge of the enveloping layer, where it contacts the yolk cell. It is thought that a network of filamentous actin in the yolk might constrict in a myosin-II dependent manner to close the blastopore at the end of epiboly, via a [...] "purse-string mechanism". Treating embryos with the actin destabilizer cytochalasin b results in delayed or arrested epiboly.|$|E
