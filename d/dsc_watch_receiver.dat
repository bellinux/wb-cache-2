40|$|This study {{investigated}} the heart rates {{of children in the}} first, third, and fifth grades of two schools during physical education class and recess time. One hundred and nine children (56 females, 53 males) participated in the eight-week study. Each participant wore a Polar Vantage XL receptor strap and <b>watch</b> <b>receiver</b> during physical education class and recess time on the same day. The average heart rates and percentage of time in and above the target heart zone of 150 to 200 beats per minute were recorded. A MANOVA analysis revealed no significant difference between heart rates during physical education and recess over the eight-week period. Gender differences, however, were significant as boys average heart rates were higher than girls and boys were in or above the target heart zone a higher percentage of the time than girls. This difference was especially evident at recess. Fisher Institute for WellnessThesis (M. S. ...|$|R
50|$|During the 1950s, Japanese export {{products}} had {{a reputation}} for poor quality. However, this image changed dramatically during the 1970s. Japanese steel, ships, <b>watches,</b> television <b>receivers,</b> automobiles, semiconductors, and many other goods developed a reputation for being manufactured to high standards and under strict quality control. The Japanese were the acknowledged world leaders for quality and design in the 1980s for some of these products. This rise in product quality also increased demand for Japanese exports.|$|R
50|$|The head {{linesman}} (H or HL) {{stands at}} one end of the line of scrimmage (usually the side opposite the press box), looking for possible offsides, encroachment and other fouls before the snap. As the play develops, he is responsible for judging the action near his sideline, including whether a player is out of bounds. During the start of passing plays, he is responsible for <b>watching</b> the <b>receivers</b> near his sideline to a point 5-7 yards beyond the line of scrimmage.|$|R

50|$|Most {{aircraft}} {{equipped for}} instrument flight (IFR) {{have at least}} two VOR receivers. As well as providing a backup to the primary receiver, the second receiver allows the pilot to easily follow a radial to or from one VOR station while <b>watching</b> the second <b>receiver</b> to see when a certain radial from another VOR station is crossed, allowing the aircraft's exact position at that moment to be determined, and giving the pilot the option of changing to the new radial if they wish.|$|R
50|$|At {{that time}} ITV had {{recently}} switched to colour transmissions, requiring the individual companies to invest heavily in new equipment. Early colour television studio cameras consisted of four tubes to relay the picture: three were receptive to colour (red, {{green and blue}} - the chrominance signal) with the fourth providing a high-resolution monochrome image (the luminance signal) which was still required as many viewers still <b>watched</b> on monochrome <b>receivers.</b> The final colour picture was created by combining the chrominance and luminance signals, but the technicians simply switched off the colour tubes whilst this dispute took place.|$|R
5000|$|Many of {{the signals}} are {{backhaul}} or [...] "wildfeed" [...] video destined to individual stations, or are feeds to terrestrial transmitters programmed remotely. These were not intentionally created as direct satellite broadcasts to home viewers, but often {{had been left}} unencrypted (in the clear) {{on the assumption that}} few people were <b>watching.</b> As free-to-air <b>receivers</b> became inexpensive and widely deployed in the 2000s (decade), many of these feeds moved to C band (requiring a huge dish), were encrypted or changed to incompatible modulation or encoding standards which required more advanced receivers, even though the corresponding terrestrial television broadcast may still be free-to-air in its home community.|$|R
40|$|The main {{challenge}} in wireless video multicast is to scalably serve multiple receivers who have different channel characteristics. Current wireless transmission schemes, however, cannot support smooth degradation. Specifically, each packet is transmitted {{at a particular}} bitrate and is decodable only by receivers that support the chosen bitrate. Broadcasting a video stream to all receivers requires transmitting at the lowest bitrate, and hence reduces everyone {{to the performance of}} the worst receiver in the multicast group. This paper introduces SoftCast, an alternative design for wireless video multicast, in which a sender broadcasts a single stream and each <b>receiver</b> <b>watches</b> a video quality that matches its channel quality. SoftCast achieves this by making the magnitude of the transmitted signal proportional to the pixel value. Hence, channel noise directly translates to a small perturbation in pixel values, allowing graceful degradation with increasing noise. SoftCast introduces a novel power allocation scheme that allows the transmission of real-valued video signals in a compact and resilient manner. We implement SoftCast in the WARP radio platform. Our results show that SoftCast improves the average video quality across multicast receivers by 3 - 7 dB over the current approach. Further, it stays competitive with the current approach even for regular unicast...|$|R
40|$|NEWS COVERAGE: A {{news release}} {{based on this}} journal {{publication}} is available online: Rice tests wireless data delivery over active TV channels [URL] "white space" model of spectrum sharing applied in the UHF TV band allows channels that are not being used regionally by a TV broadcaster to be re-purposed for unlicensed-style secondary access in 24 hour increments. Unfortunately, populated areas have few unused channels for white space usage. Nonetheless, from the UHF TV viewer's perspective, Nielsen data show severe under-utilization of this spectrum, with vast regions that are in range of TV transmitters having no active TV receivers on multiple channels even at peak TV viewing times. In this paper, we present the design, implementation, and experimental evaluation of WATCH (WiFi in Active TV CHannels), the first system to enable secondary WiFi transmission even {{in the presence of}} kilowatt-scale TV transmitters, while simultaneously protecting TV receivers when they are active. To protect active TV <b>receivers,</b> <b>WATCH</b> includes a smartphone-based TV remote or an Internet-connected TV to inform the WATCH controller of TV receivers' spatial-spectral requirements. To enable WiFi transmission in UHF bands, we design WATCH-IC (Interference Cancellation) and CAT (Constructive Addition Transmission) to (i) exploit the unique environment of asynchronous WiFi transmission {{in the presence of a}} strong streaming interferer, and (ii) require no coordination with legacy TV transmitters. With FCC permission to test our implementation, we show that WATCH can provide at least 6 times the total achievable rate to 4 watt secondary devices compared to current TV white space systems, while limiting the increase in TV channel switching time to less than 5 %...|$|R
