25|$|Details: The age is minimum 16 for a minor (<18) {{with a major}} 20 {{years old}} or older. Under 18, the younger must not be less than 14, or if so, there is a defense if the minor <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>more</b> 4 years younger if 12 or above, not more 3 years younger if under 12. Sexual {{intercourse}} of a major and a minor under 14 is a rape.|$|E
25|$|The most {{commonly}} used reduction is a polynomial-time reduction. This means that the reduction process takes polynomial time. For example, the problem of squaring an integer {{can be reduced to}} the problem of multiplying two integers. This means an algorithm for multiplying two integers can be used to square an integer. Indeed, this can be done by giving the same input to both inputs of the multiplication algorithm. Thus we see that squaring <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>more</b> difficult than multiplication, since squaring can be reduced to multiplication.|$|E

They claim suicide deaths in India among unemployed individuals and individuals in professions other than agricultural work were, collectively, {{about three times}} more frequent {{than they were in}} agricultural labourers and landowning cultivators. Even across professions in rural areas, Patel et al. find suicide among agricultural workers (including farmers) in India <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>more</b> frequent than any other profession.|$|E

25|$|DAB <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>more</b> {{bandwidth}} {{efficient than}} analogue measured in programmes per MHz {{of a specific}} transmitter (the so-called link spectral efficiency), but it is less susceptible to co-channel interference (cross talk), which {{makes it possible to}} reduce the reuse distance, i.e. use the same radio frequency channel more densely. The system spectral efficiency (the average number of radio programmes per MHz and transmitter) is a factor three more efficient than analogue FM for local radio stations. For national and regional radio networks, the efficiency is improved by more than an order of magnitude due to the use of SFNs. In that case, adjacent transmitters use the same frequency.|$|E
25|$|In Henkin semantics, each sort of second-order {{variable}} has {{a particular}} domain of its own to range over, which may be a proper subset of all sets or functions of that sort. Leon Henkin (1950) defined these semantics and proved that Gödel's completeness theorem and compactness theorem, which hold for first-order logic, carry over to second-order logic with Henkin semantics. This is because Henkin semantics are almost identical to many-sorted first-order semantics, where additional sorts of variables are added to simulate the new variables of second-order logic. Second-order logic with Henkin semantics <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>more</b> expressive than first-order logic. Henkin semantics are commonly {{used in the study}} of second-order arithmetic.|$|E

25|$|The Act also {{introduced}} criminal penalties for corrupt officialdom. An official or {{employee of the}} government who acts corruptly—as well {{as the person who}} induces the corrupt act—in the carrying out of their official duties will be fined by an amount that <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>more</b> than three times the monetary equivalent of the bribe in question. Alternatively they may be imprisoned for not more than 15 years, or they may be fined and imprisoned. Penalties apply to financial institutions who do not comply with an order to terminate any corresponding accounts within 10 days of being so ordered by the Attorney General or the Secretary of Treasury. The financial institution can be fined $US10,000 for each day the account remains open after the 10-day limit has expired.|$|E
25|$|Over the years, {{government}} {{budget cuts}} {{have taken their}} toll. Israel was amongst the top-ranked nations in international rankings for science and mathematics performance in the 1960s, but dropped to 33 out of 41 nations in the 2002 survey. Wages for Israeli teachers are low compared to other industrialized countries, especially due to {{the small amount of}} frontal teaching hours with respect to other developed countries (the salary per hour {{is similar to that of}} the OECD standards), according to a survey of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development. The government-appointed Dovrat Commission, led by Shlomo Dovrat, concluded in 2004, that the key to improving Israeli education <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>more</b> money but better-quality teaching. The recommendations included a reform giving school principals the right to fire teachers of poor quality, and reward better ones with higher pay. These moves have been blocked by Israel's teachers' unions, which have paralyzed schools with a series of long strikes, mostly blocking the proposed reforms.|$|E

[...] In The Beatles Apart (1981), Bob Woffinden considered that, aside from the [...] "excellent" [...] title track and [...] "Bring on the Lucie", Mind Games [...] "consisted of so-so songs that hardly lodged in the memory", and that [...] "The best one can say of the album is that it's exceptionally well produced." ...|$|E
