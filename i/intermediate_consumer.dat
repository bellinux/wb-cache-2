40|$|Omnivory, {{feeding on}} {{two or more}} {{different}} trophic levels by one consumer, is a common phenomenon in aquatic food webs. A terminal predator is competing with a so-called <b>intermediate</b> <b>consumer</b> for a common basal resource. At the same time, the terminal predator preys upon the <b>intermediate</b> <b>consumer,</b> making the <b>intermediate</b> <b>consumer</b> suffering from competition and predation at the same time. According to recent dynamical models, omnivory should lead to exclusion of the <b>intermediate</b> <b>consumer</b> when productivity of the common basal resource is high. In addition, {{the presence of an}} <b>intermediate</b> <b>consumer</b> should reduce the productivity of the top predator, since in its presence, the top predator is feeding on a higher trophic level than in its absence. Mixotrophy is a special case of omnivory: Here, a phototrophic protist is additionally consuming particulate prey (usually small phytoplankton and bacteria) by phagotrophy. Phytoplankton and bacteria compete with the mixotroph on the shared resources nutrients and light (only phytoplankton) and are its potential prey at the same time. Effects of omnivory and mixotrophy were investigated in experimental marine food webs. The results show, that (i) mixotrophic flagellates may strongly reduce their intermediate consumers picoplankton (bacteria and small phytoplankton), and enhance primary production at the same time. (ii) Though microzooplankton represents an intermediate competitor for calanoid copepods, it primarily meliorates the food environment for copepods. (iii) In no experiment, omnivory led to exclusion of an <b>intermediate</b> <b>consumer...</b>|$|E
40|$|Despite growing {{interest}} in ecological consequences of parasitism in food webs, relatively {{little is known about}} effects of parasites on long-term population dynamics of non-host species or about whether such effects are density or trait mediated. We studied a tri-trophic food chain comprised of (i) a bacterial basal resource (Serratia fonticola), (ii) an <b>intermediate</b> <b>consumer</b> (Paramecium caudatum), (iii) a top predator (Didinium nasutum) and (iv) a parasite of the <b>intermediate</b> <b>consumer</b> (Holospora undulata). A fully factorial experimental manipulation of predator and parasite presence/absence was combined with analyses of population dynamics, modelling and analyses of host (Paramecium) morphology and behaviour. Predation and parasitism each reduced the abundance of the <b>intermediate</b> <b>consumer</b> (Paramecium), and parasitism indirectly reduced the abundance of the basal resource (Serratia). However, in combination, predation and parasitism had non-additive effects on the abundance of the <b>intermediate</b> <b>consumer,</b> as well as on that of the basal resource. In both cases, the negative effect of parasitism seemed to be effaced by predation. Infection of the <b>intermediate</b> <b>consumer</b> reduced predator abundance. Modelling and additional experimentation revealed that this was most likely due to parasite reduction of intermediate host abundance (a density-mediated effect), as opposed to changes in predator functional or numerical response. Parasitism altered morphological and behavioural traits, by reducing host cell length and increasing the swimming speed of cells with moderate parasite loads. Additional tests showed no significant difference in Didinium feeding rate on infected and uninfected hosts, suggesting that the combination of these modifications does not affect host vulnerability to predation. However, estimated rates of encounter with Serratia based on these modifications were higher for infected Paramecium than for uninfected Paramecium. A mixture of density-mediated and trait-mediated indirect effects of parasitism on non-host species creates rich and complex possibilities for effects of parasites in food webs that should be included in assessments of possible impacts of parasite eradication or introduction...|$|E
40|$|Abstract: Growth in {{body size}} during {{ontogeny}} {{often results in}} changes in diet, leading to life-history omnivory. In addition, growth is often dependent on food density. Using a physiologically structured population model, we investigated {{the effects of these}} two aspects of individual growth in a system consisting of two size-structured populations, an omnivorous top predator and an <b>intermediate</b> <b>consumer.</b> With a single shared resource for both populations, we found that life-history omnivory decreases the likelihood of coexistence between top predator and <b>intermediate</b> <b>consumer</b> in this intraguild predation (IGP) system. This result contrasts with previous unstructured models and stage-structured models without food-dependent development. Food-dependent development and size-dependent foraging abilities of the predator resulted in a positive feedback between foraging success on the shared resource at an early life stage and foraging success on the <b>intermediate</b> <b>consumer</b> later in life. By phenomenologically incorporating this feedback in an unstructured IGP model, we show that it also demotes coexistence in this simple setting, demonstrating the robustness of the negative effect of this feedback...|$|E

40|$|International audienceWe {{studied the}} trophic network {{architecture}} of the coral reef ecosystem of the New Caledonian lagoon. To encompass the main tropic levels, we assayed carbon and nitrogen stable isotopes in various organic matter sources, <b>intermediate</b> <b>consumers</b> (invertebrates and fish), and 19 species of predatory fish (total of 1229 samples). At each level, wide range of variations for δ 13 C and δ 15 N suggested multiple sources for the OM, and complex trophic relationships among the different organisms. Despite this complexity, four trophic structures were identified. 1) The predominant reef benthic food web (R-BFW) based on the OM produced by algal turf supplies most of <b>intermediate</b> <b>consumers</b> and all anguilliform fish studied. 2) The sedimentary benthic food web (S-BFW), and 3) the lagoon pelagic food web (L-PFW), respectively based on sedimentary OM (SOM) and particulate OM (POM) involve {{a wide range of}} organisms and represent complementary food webs for most anguilliform fish. 4) Finally, the detrital benthic food web (D-BFB) where the OM issued from seagrass is indirectly utilised by reef consumers plays a secondary role. Anguilliform fish are widespread sedentary predators that live in various habitats; the species sampled were respectively associated with the three main trophic structures identified, depending on their diet and habitat.

40|$|In {{this thesis}} I have {{investigated}} the effects of invading top and intermediate consumers in a size-structured fish community, {{using a combination of}} field studies, a lake invasion experiment and smaller scale pond and aquaria experiments. The lake invasion experiment was based on introductions of an <b>intermediate</b> <b>consumer,</b> ninespine stickleback (Pungitius pungitius L.), in to allopatric populations of an omnivorous top predator, Arctic char (Salvelinus alpinus L.). The invasion experiment was performed in two tundra lakes and in two birch forest lakes to investigate the effect of climate on the invasion success. I found that the effect of sticklebacks on char was size dependent. Small char suffered reduced growth from resource competition with sticklebacks whereas the maximum size of adult char increased from the addition of a larger prey resource, stickleback. The negative effect of sticklebacks on the growth of small char suggests that sticklebacks may be a better resource competitor than char, which was also supported by the pond and aquaria experiments. The pond experiments also suggested that char were more efficient cannibals than interspecific predators on sticklebacks. Cannibalism in char may limit the recruitment of char and decrease both their predatory and competitive effect on coexisting species and thereby also promote the coexistence of char and sticklebacks. The successful invasion by sticklebacks and their subsequent increases in density suggest that the absence of sticklebacks in char lakes in this region is not caused by biotic interactions with char. Instead, it may be suggested that co-occurrence of sticklebacks and char in the region is limited by dispersal. The char – stickleback system resembles an intraguild predation system with char as the top consumer and stickleback as the <b>intermediate</b> <b>consumer.</b> The effects of the stickleback invasion is also contrasted with a field study of a northern pike (Esox lucius L.) invasion into a system with coexisting char and stickleback, where pike can be viewed as the top consumer and char as the <b>intermediate</b> <b>consumer</b> both feeding on sticklebacks. In this case pike excluded char. The identity of the invading species and the relative strength of the predatory and competitive interactions in the two contrasting systems are discussed in relation to coexistence in intraguild predation systems. I found that the identity of the invading species is of crucial importance for the response at the ecosystem level, and that the inherent size dependency of competitive and predatory interactions in fish communities is important for attaining a mechanistical understanding of the effects of invasive species in lake ecosystems...|$|E
40|$|Purpose – While {{considerable}} {{research has}} been dedicated to sponsorship, product placement and celebrity endorsement, hybrid forms that employ {{two or more of}} these approaches in a single execution have been largely neglected. A documentary that is woven around a single brand and employs elements of endorsement, product placement and television sponsorship to an extent unprecedented on German television is analysed here. Such "Protagonist Placement" had not previously been explored empirically. The purpose of this research was thus to identify, whether Protagonist Placement (PP) has a significant impact on <b>intermediate</b> <b>consumer</b> response. The second objective was to identify a potentially existent mediating role of Persuasion Knowledge (PK) on PP outcomes. The second unit of analysis – Pseudo Protagonist Placement (PPP) – is a broadcasting sponsorship with characteristics that suggest a strong association of the sponsoring brand with the sponsored programme. Again, the focus was laid on the identification of the impact of PPP on <b>intermediate</b> <b>consumer</b> response and the mediating role of PK. Design/methodology/approach – The research covered two studies – one on PP and the other on PPP. Each consists of a qualitative analysis of the programme itself and of theoretical thematic interview analysis using the NVivo qualitative research software. Each study further included an experiment employing a 2 x 2 x 2 factorial design. The experimental data was analysed using ANOVA and Chi-square. The scales used in the experiment were subjected to a panel of judges and a scale purification procedure in order to arrive at a common core of items {{to be used in the}} subsequent analysis. The approach was guided by the philosophical foundation of critical rationalism. Findings – It was possible to identify a positive impact of the chosen example of PP on <b>intermediate</b> <b>consumer</b> response in the form of a significant increase of unprompted and prompted brand awareness immediately after exposure. While PK did not adversely affect the observed impact of PP, it induced a special kind of 'Sleeper Effect' in the form of increased purchase intention after the delay period, without any noticeable suppression of advertising impact in the immediately-after condition. The researcher suggests the existence of a third route towards the Sleeper Effect, that adds increased association to the two already existent explanations, namely differential decay and disassociation. Similar results were found for PPP, which elicited a significant and favourable impact on brand awareness immediately after exposure and increased purchase intention after the delay period. Again, this increased persuasiveness over time was not caused by suppression of an immediate impact and, therefore, also indicated a third route towards the Sleeper Effect. Practical implications – The findings provide new empirical data concerning merged forms of indirect marketing and in particular such intense forms as PP and PPP. The studies offer new insights for both the academic researcher and the marketing practitioner. In particular, the way in which PK mediates the advertising outcomes and the way in which it triggers delayed persuasiveness are subjects that offer new insights for both marketer and researcher. Originality/value – Both studies offer new empirical evidence that broadens the research in the field of indirect marketing, and augments the concept of PK by offering an indication of its ability to elicit increased persuasiveness over time. Furthermore, this PK-induced Sleeper Effect demonstrates the existence of a third route towards increased persuasiveness after time delay. Both observations suggest the need for an augmentation of both the PK and Sleeper Effect theory...|$|E
40|$|Abstract Although {{invasive}} species often resemble their native counterparts, diVerences in their foraging and anti-predator strategies may disrupt native food webs. In a Cali-fornia estuary, {{we showed that}} regions dominated by native crabs and native whelks have low mortality of native oys-ters (the basal prey), while regions dominated by invasive crabs and invasive whelks have high oyster mortality and are consequently losing a biologically diverse habitat. Using Weld experiments, we demonstrated that the invasive whelk’s distribution is causally related to a large-scale pat-tern of oyster mortality. To determine whether predator– prey interactions between crabs (top predators) and whelks (<b>intermediate</b> <b>consumers)</b> indirectly control the pattern of oyster mortality, we manipulated the presence and invasion status of the intermediate and top trophic levels in labora...|$|R
40|$|Habitat destruction, {{characterized}} by patch loss and fragmentation, {{is a major}} driving force of species extinction, and understanding its mechanisms has become a central issue in biodiversity conservation. Numerous studies have explored the effect of patch loss on food web dynamics, but ignored the critical role of patch fragmentation. Here we develop an extended patch-dynamic model for a tri-trophic omnivory system with trophic-dependent dispersal in fragmented landscapes. We found that species display different vulnerabilities to both patch loss and fragmentation, depending on their dispersal range and trophic position. The resulting trophic structure varies depending {{on the degree of}} habitat loss and fragmentation, due to a tradeoff between bottom-up control on omnivores (dominated by patch loss) and dispersal limitation on <b>intermediate</b> <b>consumers</b> (dominated by patch fragmentation). Overall, we find that omnivory increases system robustness to habitat destruction relative to a simple food chain...|$|R

40|$|True omnivores {{that feed}} on both {{plant and animal}} tissues are not {{additive}} combinations of herbivore and predator (carnivore). Because true omnivores must distribute adaptive feeding decisions among two disparate tissue types, understanding the context that plants provide for foraging {{is important to understand}} their role in food webs. We varied prey and plant resources to investigate the plant context in an omnivorous true bug, Dicyphus hesperus. The contribution of plant species to fitness was unimportant in water acquisition decisions, but affected numbers of prey consumed over longer periods. In plant communities, in the absence of prey, D. hesperus moved to plants with the highest resource quality. Unlike pure predators facing declining prey, omnivores can use a nondepleting resource to fund future foraging without paying a significant cost. However, the dual resource exploitation can also impose significant constraints when both types of resources are essential. The presence of relatively profitable plants that are spatially separate from <b>intermediate</b> <b>consumer</b> populations could provide a mechanism to promote stability within food webs with plant-feeding omnivores. The effects of context in omnivores will require adding second-order terms to the Lotka-Volterra structure to explicitly account for the kinds of interactions we have observed here.

40|$|It is {{long since}} well {{established}} that {{growth and development}} in fish individuals are heavily dependent on food intake. Yet, this dependence of individual development on food levels has only to a limited extent been taken into consideration when studying fish population and community processes. Using the modelling framework of physiologically structured population models and empirical data {{for a number of}} species configurations, how different size-dependent processes may affect fish population dynamics and community structures are reviewed. Considering competitive interactions, cohort interactions will often give rise to cohort cycles driven by an inequality in competitive abilities between differently sized individuals. The addition of cannibalism may dampen these cycles, the extent to which is dependent on life-history characteristics of the cannibals. The circumstance that individuals change their trophic position over their life cycle {{as a result of an}} increase in size gives rise to life history omnivory. In such omnivorous systems, food-dependent growth demotes the potential for predatory and prey fishes to coexist. In tritrophic food chains, food-dependent growth in the <b>intermediate</b> <b>consumer</b> may lead to the presence of bistability including sensitivity to catastrophic behaviour. These results shed new light on the drastic decreases observed in the stocks of many marine fish top predators including their inability to recover after fishing moratoria, and on the suggested presence of alternative states in freshwater fish communities. # 2006 The Author...|$|E
40|$|Problem: Infer {{relative}} {{danger from}} spatially segregated predators in large-scale marine systems, using {{individual differences in}} prey foraging behaviour. Mathematical models: Optimization of trade-offs between predation risk and energy gain. Key assumption: Foraging individuals choosing to incur higher risk of predation should experience higher energetic gain than individuals choosing safer foraging options. Organisms: Alaskan harbour seals foraging under predation risk from killer whales and Pacific sleeper sharks in shallow and deep strata, respectively. Sleeper sharks are elusive predators and their interactions with prey are difficult to measure directly. Method: Our method infers the relative danger from different predator types that is theoretically most plausible according to <b>intermediate</b> <b>consumer</b> behaviour. We predicted net energy gain and predation risk per foraging dive, parameterizing an analytical model with data on seal behaviour and the spatial distributions of predators and resources. We used assumptions about relative danger from different predator types as treatments in a computer experiment. We sought the treatment combination best supporting the assumption that individuals that risk more should gain more by plotting the individual seals ’ predicted cumulative energy gain against cumulative predation risk. Improved statistical fit for a positive and monotonic relationship implied greater support. Conclusions: Our key assumption was best supported when assuming that relative danger from sleeper sharks {{is much greater than}} that from killer whales, suggesting that sub-lethal effects of sharks on Alaskan harbour seals might be much stronger than previously thought...|$|E

30|$|It is {{important}} to note that cross-substitution between different fuels is not considered in this paper. It is a major limitation for evaluation of impacts on GHG emissions since higher prices for one type of fuel could stimulate end-users to substitute for cheaper ones in the long run. Subsidies for coal are beyond the scope of this paper; however, coal is the most carbon-intensive fuel. If end-user subsidies are eliminated only in gas and electricity sectors and coal prices remain at below market levels (due to producer subsidies), both end-users and <b>intermediate</b> <b>consumers,</b> e.g., power plants are likely to switch to coal as less expensive energy source as much as technological capacity would allow. In this case, liberalization of gas and electricity prices would likely result in larger coal use and higher GHG emissions. Hence, energy subsidy reform should consider all fuels to prevent undesirable effects. Moreover, depending on the resultant market price of different fuels an additional measure might be required to prevent substitution for coal, e.g., carbon tax charged depending on the carbon-intensity of the output.|$|R
40|$|A {{great deal}} {{is known about}} the {{influence}} of dispersal on species that interact via competition or predation, but very little {{is known about the}} influence of dispersal on species that interact via both competition and predation. Here, I investigate the influence of dispersal on the coexistence and abundance–productivity relationships of species that engage in intraguild predation (IGP: competing species that prey on each other). I report two key findings. First, dispersal enhances coexistence when a trade-off between resource competition and IGP is strong and/or when the Intraguild Prey has an overall advantage, and impedes coexistence when the trade-off is weak and/or when the Intraguild Predator has an overall advantage. Second, the Intraguild Prey’s abundance–productivity relationship depends crucially on the dispersal rate of the Intraguild Predator, but the Intraguild Predator’s abundance–productivity relationship is unaffected by its own dispersal rate or that of the Intraguild Prey. This difference arises because the two species engage in both a competitive interaction as well as an antagonistic (predator–prey) interaction. The Intraguild Prey, being the <b>intermediate</b> <b>consumer,</b> has to balance the conflicting demands of resource acquisition and predator avoidance, while the Intraguild Predator has to contend only with resource acquisition. Thus, the Intraguild Predator’s abundance increases monotonically with resource productivity regardless of either species ’ dispersal rate, while the Intraguild Prey’s abundance–productivity relationship can increase, decrease, or become hump-shaped with increasing productivity depending on the Intraguild Predator’s dispersal rate. The important implication is that a species ’ trophic position determines the effectiveness of dispersal in sampling spatial environmental heterogeneity.

40|$|A vast body of {{literature}} exists documenting the morphological, behavioural and life history changes that predators induce in prey. However, {{little attention has been}} paid to how these induced changes feed back and affect the predators 2 ̆ 7 life history and morphology. Larvae of the phantom midge Chaoborus flavicans are intermediate predators in a food web with Daphnia pulex as the basal resource and planktivorous fish as the top predator. C. flavicans prey on D. pulex and are themselves prey for fish; as D. pulex induce morphological defences in the presence of C. flavicans this is an ideal system in which to evaluate the effects of defended prey and top predators on an <b>intermediate</b> <b>consumer.</b> We assessed the impact on C. flavicans life history and morphology of foraging on defended prey while also being exposed to the non-lethal presence of a top fish predator. We tested the basic hypothesis that the effects of defended prey will depend on the presence or absence of top predator predation risk. Feeding rate was significantly reduced and time to pupation was significantly increased by defended morph prey. Gut size, development time, fecundity, egg size and reproductive effort respond to fish chemical cues directly or significantly alter the relationship between a trait and body size. We found no significant interactions between prey morph and the non-lethal presence of a top predator, suggesting that the effects of these two biological factors were additive or singularly independent. Overall it appears that C. flavicans is able to substantially modify several aspects of its biology, and while some changes appear mere consequences of resource limitation others appear facultative in nature...|$|E
40|$|Predators are a {{major source}} of stress in natural systems because their prey must balance the {{benefits}} of feeding with the risk of being eaten. Although this ‘fear’ of being eaten often drives the organization and dynamics of many natural systems, we know little about how such risk effects will be altered by climate change. Here, we examined the interactive consequences of predator avoidance and projected climate warming in a three-level rocky intertidal food chain. We found that both predation risk and increased air and sea temperatures suppressed the foraging of prey in the middle trophic level, suggesting that warming may further enhance the top-down control of predators on communities. Prey growth efficiency, which measures the efficiency of energy transfer between trophic levels, became negative when prey were subjected to predation risk and warming. Thus, the combined effects of these stressors may represent an important tipping point for individual fitness and the efficiency of energy transfer in natural food chains. In contrast, we detected no adverse effects of warming on the top predator and the basal resources. Hence, the consequences of projected warming may be particularly challenging for <b>intermediate</b> <b>consumers</b> residing in food chains where risk dominates predator-prey interactions...|$|R

We investigated {{the structure of}} a food-web fragment consisting of dominant <b>intermediate</b> <b>consumers</b> (fishes and crayfishes) in the Florida Everglades, using stable isotope analysis to quantify trophic diversity along gradients of primary production (periphyton), disturbance (marsh drying) and intermediate-consumer density (a possible indicator of competition). We predicted that trophic diversity would increase with resource availability and decrease after disturbance, and that competition could result in greater trophic diversity by favouring resource partitioning. Total trophic diversity, measured by niche area, decreased with periphyton biomass and an ordination axis representing several bluegreen algae species. Consumers’ basal resource diversity, estimated by δ 13 C values, was similarly related to algal community structure. The range of trophic levels (δ 15 N range) increased with time since the most recent drying and reflooding event, but decreased with intermediate-consumer density, and was positively related to the ordination axis reflecting increases in green algae and decreases in filamentous bluegreen algae. Our findings suggest that algal quality, independent of quantity, influences food-web structure and demonstrate an indirect role of nutrient enrichment mediated by its effects on periphyton palatability and biomass. These results reveal potential mechanisms for anthropogenic effects on Everglades communities...|$|R

When compared with the USA, the West German nonprofit sector catered more to government demands.

In terms of the multiplier effect of nonprofit output, we find that an additional dollar of nonprofit services delivered to households and/or government induced indirectly an additional 83 cents of business output in the USA. By comparison, West Germany’s nonprofit sector had a lower multiplier effect, with 43 Pfennig per DM 1. We also find that businesses have a much larger stake in nonprofit production as intermediate suppliers when compared to their role as <b>intermediate</b> <b>consumers.</b> The economic position the nonprofit sector occupies in both countries {{is that of a}} producing sector, taking inputs from businesses and providing outputs for households and governments.

40|$|Trophic cascades are {{indirect}} {{positive effects}} of predators on resources via control of <b>intermediate</b> <b>consumers.</b> Larger-bodied predators appear to induce stronger trophic cascades (a greater rebound of resource density toward carrying capacity), but how this happens is unknown because we lack a clear depiction of how the strength of trophic cascades is determined. Using consumer resource models, we first show that {{the strength of a}} trophic cascade has an upper limit set by the interaction strength between the basal trophic group and its consumer and that this limit is approached as the interaction strength between the consumer and its predator increases. We then express the strength of a trophic cascade explicitly in terms of predator body size and use two independent parameter sets to calculate how the strength of a trophic cascade depends on predator size. Both parameter sets predict a positive effect of predator size on the strength of a trophic cascade, driven mostly by the body size dependence of the interaction strength between the first two trophic levels. Our results support previous empirical findings and suggest that the loss of larger predators will have greater consequences on trophic control and biomass structure in food webs than the loss of smaller predators...|$|R
40|$|Top–down {{control of}} {{phytoplankton}} by crustacean mesozooplankton is {{a cornerstone of}} freshwater ecology. Apparently, trophic cascades are more frequently reported from freshwater than from marine plankton. We argue that this difference is real and mainly caused by biological differences at the zooplankton–phytoplankton link: cladocerans (particularly Daphnia) in the lakes and copepods in the sea. We derive these conclusions from recent literature {{and a number of}} own, similarly designed mesocosm experiments conducted in a lake, a brackish water and a marine site. In all experiments, phytoplankton were exposed to gradients of experimentally manipulated densities of zooplankton, including freshwater copepods and cladocerans, and marine copepods and appendicularians. The suggested reasons for the difference between lake and marine trophic cascades are: (1) Both copepods and cladocerans suppress only part of the phytoplankton size spectrum: cladocerans the small and copepods the large phytoplankton. (2) If not controlled by grazing, small phytoplankton may increase their biomass faster than large phytoplankton. (3) Copepods additionally release small phytoplankton from grazing pressure by <b>intermediate</b> <b>consumers</b> (protozoa) and competitors (predation on appendicularian eggs), while cladocerans do not release large phytoplankton from grazing pressure by any functional group. (4) Cladocerans sequester more of the limiting nutrient than copepods, leaving fewer nutrients available for compensatory growth of ungrazed phytoplankton...|$|R
40|$|Anthropogenic {{influences}} on resources and consumers can affect food web regulation, with impacts on trophic structure and ecosystem processes. Identifying how these impacts unfold is challenging because alterations {{to one or}} both resources and consumers can similarly transform community structure, especially for <b>intermediate</b> <b>consumers.</b> To date, empirical testing of perturbations on trophic regulation has been limited by the difficulty in separating the direct effect of perturbations on species composition and diversity versus those unfolding indirectly via altered feeding pathways. Moreover, disentangling the independent and interactive impacts of co-varying stressors that characterize human-altered systems has been an ongoing analytical challenge. We used a large-scale meta-community experiment in grasslands to test how resource inputs, stand perturbation, and spatial factors affect regulation of insect herbivores in tri-trophic grassland food webs. Using path-model comparisons, we observed significant simplification of food web regulation on insect herbivores, shifting from mixed predator-resource regulation in unaltered mainland areas, to strictly resource-based regulation with landscape perturbation and fragmentation. Most changes were attributed to homogenization of plant community caused by landscape fragmentation and the deterministic influence of eutrophication that reduced among-patch beta-diversity. This led to a simplified food web dominated by fewer, but more abundant herbivore taxa. Our work implies that anthropogenic perturbation relating to resources and spatial isolation can transform the regulation of food web diversity, structure and function...|$|R
40|$|Intense {{disturbance}} may locally destroy {{patches of}} habitat and shape the landscape into {{a mosaic of}} reassembling communities. The development of ecosystem properties during such community reassembly is poorly understood. In intertidal bare sediments, trophic relations between microphytobenthos or heterotrophic bacteria and macrofauna invertebrates may guarantee fundamental ecosystem properties such as carbon flow through the food web. We studied the dynamic relation between reassembling macrofauna communities and such microbial carbon flow during recovery after severe disturbance. We deliberately induced prolonged hypoxia in winter and early summer and allowed recolonisation for periods of two and five months. Carbon flow was quantified from basal resources (microphytobenthos and bacteria) to <b>intermediate</b> <b>consumers</b> using 13 C as a tracer. Within the period of study (5 months), microbial carbon flow fully recovered, although macrofauna diversity was still very low compared to the natural communities (ranging from 6 to 17 species). More than 90 % of microbial carbon flow to macrofauna {{was due to the}} consumers that recolonised within two months. Two of these species were dominant contributors to microphytobenthos carbon transfer to fauna. Furthermore, at an early stage of reassembly, this ecosystem property was remarkably similar when disturbance took place at different times of the year (winter or early summer), although there were differences in assemblage composition and functional diversity. We conclude that species assemblages and ecosystem function developed relatively independently in this benthic system. We discuss which ecological factors may have caused such non-parallel development of macrofaunal communities and carbon flow. ...|$|R
40|$|Few {{studies have}} {{examined}} how foraging niche shift of a predator over time cascade down to local prey communities. Here we examine patterns of temporal foraging niche shifts of a generalist predator (yellow catfish, Pelteobagrus fulvidraco) and the abundance of prey communities in a subtropical lake. We predicted {{that the nature of}} these interactions would have implications for patterns in diet shifts and growth of the predator. Our results show significant decreases in planktivory and benthivory from late spring to summer and autumn, whereas piscivory increased significantly from mid-summer until late autumn and also increased steadily with predator body length. The temporal dynamics in predator/prey ratios indicate that the predation pressure on zooplankton and zoobenthos decreased when the predation pressure on the prey fish and shrimps was high. Yellow catfish adjusted their foraging strategies to temporal changes in food availability, which is in agreement with optimal foraging theory. Meanwhile the decrease in planktivory and benthivory of yellow catfish enabled primary consumers, such as zooplankton and benthic invertebrates, to develop under low grazing pressure via trophic cascading effects in the local food web. Thus, yellow catfish shifts its foraging niche to <b>intermediate</b> <b>consumers</b> in the food web to benefit the energetic demand on growth and reproduction during summer, which in turn indirectly facilitate the primary consumers. In complex food webs, trophic interactions are usually expected to reduce the strength and penetrance of trophic cascades. However, our study demonstrates strong associations between foraging niche of piscivorous fish an...|$|R
40|$|The {{phytoplankton}} in warm oligotrophic {{regions of}} the open oceans is dominated by � 2 -�m cells too small for efficient direct consumption by mesozooplankton. However, these primary producers are hypothetically linked to higher trophic levels via the cascading impacts of mesozooplankton grazing on <b>intermediate</b> <b>consumers.</b> To assess the magnitudes of these indirect trophic linkages, grazing experiments, involving different concentration treatments of the mixed mesozooplankton community, were performed during cruises in the subtropical North Pacific at station ALOHA. Mesozooplankton fed on a diverse assemblage of microzooplankton and nanoheterotrophs � 5 �m, and their predation indirectly enhanced net growth rates of phytoplankton and 2 – 5 -�m heterotrophs. Increasing the concentration of mesozooplankton also enhanced growth rates of heterotrophic bacteria, but this was more likely the result of organic enrichment than trophic transfer. Scaled to their natural abundance, the indirect grazing impacts of mesozooplankton on lower trophic levels are small, accounting for � 0. 005 d� 1 of the growth rates of each prey category examined. Thus, the larger consumers appear to exert little net influence on the dynamics {{at the base of}} the food web. In contrast, size-fraction manipulations of consumers between 2 and 20 �m (i. e., the nanozooplankton) elicited strong responses among bacterial populations indicative of tightly coupled predatory chain of at least two steps. Given the present results, detailed studies of the interactions among pico- and nanoplankton appear to be th...|$|R
40|$|Seagrass beds provide {{important}} habitat {{for a wide}} range of marine species but are threatened by multiple human impacts in coastal waters. Although seagrass communities have been well-studied in the field, a quantification of their food-web structure and functioning, and how these change across space and human impacts has been lacking. Motivated by extensive field surveys and literature information, we analyzed the structural features of food webs associated with Zostera marina across 16 study sites in 3 provinces in Atlantic Canada. Our goals were to (i) quantify differences in food-web structure across local and regional scales and human impacts, (ii) assess the robustness of seagrass webs to simulated species loss, and (iii) compare food-web structure in temperate Atlantic seagrass beds with those of other aquatic ecosystems. We constructed individual food webs for each study site and cumulative webs for each province and the entire region based on presence/absence of species, and calculated 16 structural properties for each web. Our results indicate that food-web structure was similar among low impact sites across regions. With increasing human impacts associated with eutrophication, however, food-web structure show evidence of degradation as indicated by fewer trophic groups, lower maximum trophic level of the highest top predator, fewer trophic links connecting top to basal species, higher fractions of herbivores and <b>intermediate</b> <b>consumers,</b> and higher number of prey per species. These structural changes translate into functional changes with impacted sites being less robust to simulated species loss. Temperate Atlantic seagrass webs ar...|$|R
40|$|Because {{food web}} regimes control {{the biomass of}} primary {{producers}} (e. g., plants or algae), <b>intermediate</b> <b>consumers</b> (e. g., invertebrates), and large top predators (tuna, killer whales), they are of societal as well as academic interest. Some controls over food web regimes may be internal, but many are mediated by conditions or fluxes over large spatial scales. To understand locally observed changes in food webs, we must learn more about how environmental gradients and bound-aries affect the fluxes of energy, materials, or organisms through landscapes or seascapes that influence local species inter-actions. Marine biologists and oceanographers have overcome formidable challenges of fieldwork {{on the high seas}} to make remarkable progress towards this goal. In river drainage networks, we have opportunities to address similar questions at smaller spatial scales, in ecosystems with clear physical structure and organization. Despite these advantages, we still have much to learn about linkages between fluxes from watershed landscapes and local food webs in river networks. Longitu-dinal (downstream) gradients in productivity, disturbance regimes, and habitat structure exert strong effects on the organ-isms and energy sources of river food webs, but their effects on species interactions are just beginning to be explored. In fluid ecosystems with less obvious physical structure, like the open ocean, discerning features that control the movement of organisms and affect food web dynamics is even more challenging. In both habitats, new sensing, tracing and mapping technologies have revealed how landscape or seascape features (e. g., watershed divides, ocean fronts or circulation cells...|$|R
40|$|According {{to modern}} oceanographic {{perspectives}} that emphasize microbial pathways, phagotrophic protists comprise one to several levels of <b>intermediate</b> <b>consumers</b> between phytoplankton and larger metazooplankton (copepods and krill). However, recent attempts to quantify pelagic trophic {{structure in the}} open ocean using nitrogen stable isotope techniques have brought into question whether such measurements adequately account for protistan trophic steps. Here, we use a two-stage chemostat system, with Dunaliella tertiolecta andOxyrrhis marina as a predator-prey model, {{to address this question}} experimentally. To investigate 15 N trophic discrimination under different conditions of nitrogen availability and recycling, Oxyrrhis was fed in the light and in the dark on phytoplankton provided with high and low nutrient ratios of N: P. We used both bulk and amino acids-compound specific isotopic analysis (AA-CSIA) to distinguish trophic fractionation from changes in the δ 15 N values of phytoplankton (isotopic baseline). Results demonstrate that protistan consumers are not, in fact, significantly enriched in 15 N relative to their prey, a marked departure from the general findings for metazoan consumers. In addition, we show that changes in the isotopic baseline propagate rapidly through the protistan food chain, highlighting the need to account for this variability at ecologically relevant time scales. If protistan trophic steps are largely invisible or significantly underestimated using nitrogen isotope measurements, research that utilize such measurements in ecological, fisheries, and climate change studies may miss {{a large part of the}} ocean's variability in food-web structure and ecosystem function. © 2014, by the Association for the Sciences of Limnology and Oceanography, Inc...|$|R

The main question addressed is whether firms {{should be allowed to}} practice different nonlinear prices at each location (delivered nonlinear pricing) or should be forced to set a unique nonlinear contract (mill nonlinear pricing). Assuming that firms can costless relocate, we show that the free entry long-run number of firms may be smaller, equal, or higher under delivered nonlinear pricing.

40|$|An {{indirect}} {{increase in}} algal abundance that is induced by mesozooplankton predation on intermediate trophic level grazers (microzooplankton) {{is among the}} factors that shape {{the structure of a}} marine planktonic food web (copepods/cladocerans-ciliates-algae). Marine mesozooplankton include species with diverse feeding strategies, and hence they play different roles in trophic interactions. In this study, we simulated a simple pelagic food web in the laboratory using 3 copepod species and 1 cladoceran as top predators to test the hypothesis that different species with different feeding behaviors will cause different impacts on prey communities. Our results showed that among the 3 crustacean mesozooplankton species, Parvocalanus crassirostris was the most carnivorous species that caused the strongest cascading effect, which led to an increase in algal density as the rate of the cascading effect exceeded the direct consumption of algal prey by <b>intermediate</b> <b>consumers.</b> In contrast, the marine cladoceran Penilia avirostris generally caused a decline in algal density because it created no indirect positive effect on algae since it was incapable of capturing the intermediate grazers. Temora turbinata fed on ciliates and algal prey at similar rates so that the direct consumption of the algal prey was balanced by the indirect trophic cascade effect. The strength of the cascade effect induced by Acartia erythraea was significantly enhanced by increasing the densities of ciliates. The mechanism was due to a switch in preying behavior from suspension feeding to ambush feeding. Our results imply that mesozooplankton omnivory is important in maintaining the stability of the community structure of microplankton because the effects of direct consumption and the cascading effect balanced each other due to the broad feeding strategies of predators...|$|R
