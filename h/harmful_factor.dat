Methods: This cross-sectional study was conducted during May 2013 among 178 employees of public institutions in the city of Osijek. An anonymous questionnaire which contained questions relating to demographic data and working status of the participants, their exposure to various <b>harmful</b> psychosocial <b>factors</b> of the working environment and occurrence of certain symptoms of SBS among them was used as a research tool. Results: 96. 1 % (171 / 178) of participants were exposed to <b>harmful</b> psychosocial <b>factors</b> of the working environment. Employees exposed to those factors more frequently expressed symptoms of SBS. The incidence and the number of symptoms of SBS among employees simultaneously grew with the increase of the number of <b>harmful</b> psychosocial <b>factors</b> of the working environment to which they were exposed.

The aim {{of the present study}} was to determine the mechanism of protection of cyanidin- 3 -O-glucoside against ultraviolet B (UVB) -induced damage to human HaCaT keratinocytes. Our results show that cyanidin- 3 -O-glucoside decreased the levels of intracellular reactive oxygen species generated by UVB treatment. cyanidin- 3 -O-glucoside also decreased the UVB-augmented levels of the DNA damage indicators phospho-p 53 and phospho-ATM/ATR. In addition, cyanidin- 3 -O-glucoside protected keratinocytes from UVB-induced injury by overturning the disruption of mitochondrial membrane potential and reversing apoptosis. The expression of anti-apoptotic protein B-cell lymphoma 2 (Bcl- 2) was attenuated in UVB-exposed cells but restored in UVB/cyanidin- 3 -O-glucoside-treated cells. Furthermore, expression of the proapoptotic proteins Bcl- 2 -associated X (Bax) and the key apoptosis executer cleaved caspase- 3 were increased in UVB-irradiated cells and decreased in UVB/cyanidin- 3 -O-glucoside-treated cells. For these reasons, the results demonstrate that cyanidin- 3 -O-glucoside protects human keratinocytes against UVB-induced oxidative stress and apoptosis. Our study provides a theoretical basis for the use of cyanidin- 3 -O-glucoside in the fight against light damage...|$|E

Degeneration of cartilaginous endplate was a crucial <b>harmful</b> <b>factor</b> during the initiation and development of IDD. Oxidative stress was implicated in IDD. However, the underlying molecular mechanism for the degeneration of cartilaginous endplate remains elusive. Herein, we found that oxidative stress could induce apoptosis and autophagy in endplate chondrocytes evidenced by western blot analysis, flow cytometry, immunofluorescence staining, GFP-LC 3 B transfection, and MDC staining. In addition, we also found that the apoptosis of endplate chondrocytes was significantly increased after the inhibition of autophagy by bafilomycin A 1 shown by flow cytometry. Furthermore, mTOR pathway upstream autophagy was greatly suppressed suggested by western blot assay. In conclusion, our study strongly revealed that oxidative stress could increase autophagy and apoptosis of endplate chondrocytes in intervertebral disc. The increase of autophagy activity could prevent endplate chondrocytes from apoptosis. The autophagy in endplate chondrocytes induced by oxidative stress was mTOR dependent. These findings might shed some new lights on the mechanism for IDD and provide new strategies for the treatments of IDD...|$|E
