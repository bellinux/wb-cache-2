5|$|Fusō sank between 03:38 and 03:50; only a {{few dozen}} men survived the rapid sinking and oil fire. There is {{evidence}} {{that some of these}} were rescued by the destroyer , which was itself sunk a short time later; {{it is also possible that}} some who escaped the sinking reached Leyte only to be killed by Filipinos, as is known to <b>have</b> <b>happened</b> <b>to</b> survivors from other Japanese warships sunk in the Battle of Surigao Strait. Ten crew members are known to have survived, all of whom returned to Japan. The total number of casualties is estimated at 1,620 sailors. Fusō was removed from the navy list on 31 August 1945.|$|E
5|$|Linda Schuyler had co-created The Kids of Degrassi Street in 1979 with Kit Hood, and Yan Moore was {{a writer}} on that series. As the {{children}} grew up, the Degrassi franchise developed into Degrassi Junior High and Degrassi High. In 1999 two episodes of Jonovision, a CBC Television talk show aimed at teenagers, reunited some of the cast members from the series. At the same time, Schuyler and Moore were developing a new television drama. When the Jonovision reunion episode proved to be popular, Schuyler and Moore wondered about reuniting the characters, too. As the months passed, they began thinking about what might <b>have</b> <b>happened</b> <b>to</b> the characters of Degrassi High and realized that the character Emma Nelson, born {{at the end of}} Degrassi Junior Highs second season, would soon be entering junior high school. Stephen Stohn, Schuyler's husband suggested Degrassi: The Next Generation as the name for the new sequel series, borrowing the concept from , of which he was a fan.|$|E

5|$|I {{was just}} trying to make a point. I wanted to show people {{how easy it is to}} {{manipulate}} someone's voice. If I can do it with a clip I pulled off of TV, imagine what they are doing on records and during live performances. The entire industry has been so manipulated, because there's such an emphasis on perfection, so when something like this happens, it causes such a stir. I knew something had to <b>have</b> <b>happened</b> <b>to</b> make it jump so fast. It's wild how much the story's been twisted. It's just always been fun for me to manipulate artists, and make it sound crazy. It was just for a good laugh. It was a goof, just for fun. I do a lot of parodies on my YouTube channel, and it just so happens this one got a little out of hand. It was just what I've learned in school, and it's fun I could fool so many people and get away with it. A lot of people had a lot of laughs because of it, so why should I apologize? If you can't poke fun at yourself, I don't know what kind of person you are.|$|E

The experience was enough for Huxley to give credence to Darwin's gradualism, and to introduce the story of the horse into his lecture series.|$|E

25|$|Notable {{events that}} <b>have</b> <b>happened</b> <b>to</b> Croydon's skyline include the Millennium project {{to create the}} largest single urban {{lighting}} project ever. It was created for the buildings of Croydon to illuminate them for the third millennium. Not only did this project give new lighting to the buildings, but it provided an opportunity to project onto them images and words, mixing art and poetry with coloured light, and also displaying public information after dark. Apart from increasing night time activity in Croydon and thereby reducing the fear of crime, it helped to promote the sustainable use of older buildings by displaying them in a more positive way.|$|E
25|$|Around {{the same}} time, police in Staffordshire {{claimed that the}} {{disappearance}} of the girls was linked to an abduction in the county the previous year, when a six-year-old girl had survived an attack by an abductor who was still at large and whose green Ford Mondeo was identified as having number-plates which had been stolen in Peterborough. The same man was also believed to have followed a 12-year-old girl in the same area, when his car was fitted with number-plates which had been stolen in Nottinghamshire. The same vehicle had since been spotted in Glatton, also in Cambridgeshire. This information was included in an appeal on Crimewatch, but did not shed any light on what might <b>have</b> <b>happened</b> <b>to</b> the two missing girls.|$|E

Towards the climax of that book, Molly and Bill arrive at Hogwarts to see the Third Task of the Triwizard Tournament, acting as family guests to Harry. After the return of Voldemort, Dumbledore asks Molly and Bill to join the Order and fight in the impending Second War. Molly comforts Harry and, {{for the first time}} in his life, he has someone to be there for him, like a mother.|$|E
25|$|Paul seizes this {{opportunity}} to give his sister a baby in a storyline that becomes known as the baby switch. He drugs Babe, puts her in a helicopter, and stages a helicopter crash near a river in the forest. When Babe awakens, Paul tells her that the helicopter crashed and her baby is dead. She loses consciousness again. When Adam Chandler and JR arrive at the scene and threaten Paul, should anything bad <b>have</b> <b>happened</b> <b>to</b> their heir, Paul twists his story around and tells them that it was Bianca's baby that fell into the river and that Babe's child survived. JR's family is elated that Babe's baby is alive, but Bianca's family is devastated by the news. In Llanview, Paul gives Kelly Babe's son (later known as Adam Chandler III, then Little Adam, and currently AJ), telling her that the boy's mother was a poor homeless woman {{who did not want}} a baby.|$|E

500|$|Another quandary {{is that if}} the precogs' visions are infallible {{then the}} future cannot be otherwise, while if they are {{incorrect}} people will be punished for crimes they will never commit. Kowalski contends that the precogs only attain knowledge of what he calls the [...] "conditional future". He cites as evidence two examples: the scene where Agatha steers Anderton through the mall by foreseeing dangerous events and helping him circumnavigate them, and a later scene where she tells Anderton and his ex-wife what would <b>have</b> <b>happened</b> <b>to</b> their child if he had lived. In the first example, Agatha knows what Anderton will freely choose to do when presented with specific facts so she provides them to him, and, in the second, she knows what will <b>have</b> <b>happened</b> <b>to</b> the Anderton's son based on specific scenarios throughout his life, in which she can see what he would have freely chosen to do, and what selections various people in his life would have freely made. According to Kowalski, the PreCrime unit therefore removes individuals from precise situations where they would freely choose to become a murderer.|$|E
