Leicestershire and Durham also won in the North.|$|E
25|$|Summer routes were {{introduced}} in 1932, cutting Sagene Ring's headway to fifteen minutes. Including slack a <b>full</b> <b>round</b> on the circle took 35 minutes. During a twelve-minute headway this went fine with three trams in each direction. The route {{could be done in}} 30 minutes, but without any slack. Oslo Sporveier ran the line with two trams per direction during the fifteen-minute headway services, but it was often difficult to keep the schedule with this scheme. During the summers 0 was combined with 13 so each service would run twice around the circle and then run on the Gamlebyen Line. From 1937 the reduced service and 0 and 13 combination was also run on Sundays. From 1940 line 13 was moved to the Sinsen Line.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. SQUARE is an {{iterated}} {{block cipher}} proposed by Daemen et. al. in FSE 1997. Inspired by Bogdanov et. al. ’s recent works [12], we first present an improved biclique attack, i. e. stat-based independent biclique attack on <b>full</b> <b>rounds</b> SQUARE in this paper. We construct a one round stat-based independent biclique {{for the initial}} round, and utilize matching with precomputation techniques to recover the whole key from the remaining rounds. The computing complexity of our attack is 126. 172 encryptions and required data {{can be reduced to}} a single plaintext-ciphertext pair. To be the best of our knowledge, our attack has an optimal computing complexity and data complexity of biclique attack on <b>full</b> <b>rounds</b> SQUARE...|$|R

The one-story, symmetrical, rectangular building has a front gabled roof which meets the wall with a slight overhang and wide frieze below; both features are typical of the Greek Revival style. The front (east) facade is built from rock-face sandstone in regular courses, the three remaining walls feature rough-cut stone in irregular courses. Each side wall (north and south) has four windows with round, stone, arched lintels, keystones and stone sills. Each window features a <b>full</b> <b>round</b> arch and a nine over nine sash. Each of the building's four corners is adorned with stone quoins as are all of the windows. The front, double-door has a semi-circular transom window and a stone hood with a keystone above it.|$|E
25|$|By the end {{of round}} twelve, critics began speculating that the {{pre-season}} favourites, the Crusaders, were losing their form after a draw against the winless Western Force and then a shock loss to the Stormers. However they bounced back against the Bulls with a 4 try bonus point victory. After a few results fell in their favour {{they were able to}} comfortably beat the Brumbies, and finished for the second consecutive season on top of the ladder. The Crusaders won the Super 14 after defeating the Hurricanes in Christchurch in the final, 19-12 in misty conditions. There was 94 matches held over three and a half months, with each team playing one <b>full</b> <b>round</b> robin against the 13 other teams and the playoffs involving two semi-finals and a final. Every team got one bye over the 14 rounds.|$|E
25|$|Five matches {{were played}} from Friday to Sunday; the VB Series began with two matches, while a <b>full</b> <b>round</b> of ING Cup matches was {{played on the}} Saturday. On Friday the 13th, Australia beat Sri Lanka by 116 runs in the tri-series opener, with Sri Lanka's two most {{experienced}} bowlers, Chaminda Vaas and Muttiah Muralitharan, yielding combined bowling figures of 20–1–140–0, while in the ING Cup, the Warriors won and earned a bonus point at home after chasing down 198 {{to win in the}} fortieth over, with Justin Langer getting a half-century. The following day, the Bushrangers beat the Blues to cut the deficit {{at the top of the}} table to six points, with Gerard Denton and Cameron White sharing six wickets between them. Chasing 188 to win, the Bushrangers were three for 160, but lost four wickets in 23 balls before Andrew McDonald's 14 not out took them across the line. In the final match, the Tigers and the Redbacks tied in a match that was cut from 50 to 35 overs a side following rain. Michael Bevan made 54 for the Tigers, who chased a revised target of 172 to win, and when Bevan was dismissed the Tigers required 13 off 14 balls. Three more wickets fell, Shaun Tait taking two in an over, and both teams had to be content with the tie. Finally, South Africa beat Australia by five wickets on a Sunday game in Brisbane, with Brett Lee conceding 17 off his final over after South Africa had needed 47 off 30 balls.|$|E
