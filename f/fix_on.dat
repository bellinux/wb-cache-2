25|$|In Hinduism, an icon, image, statue or idol {{is called}} Murti or Pratima. Major Hindu traditions such as Vaishnavism, Shaivism, Shaktism and Smartaism favor {{the use of}} Murti (idol). These traditions {{suggest that it is}} easier to {{dedicate}} time and focus on spirituality through anthropomorphic or non-anthropomorphic icons. The Bhagavad Gita – a Hindu scripture, in verse 12.5, states that only a few have the time and mind to ponder and <b>fix</b> <b>on</b> the unmanifested Absolute (abstract formless Brahman), and {{it is much easier to}} focus on qualities, virtues, aspects of a manifested representation of god, through one's senses, emotions and heart, because the way human beings naturally are.|$|E

25|$|The {{explosives}} fail to {{kill the}} rabbits, and that night they attack Cole's ranch, killing Jud while Cole, Frank, Jackie, and Cole's housekeeper escape into the storm shelter. The rabbits {{make their way to}} the general store, killing housekeeper Mildred (Francesca Jarvis) and eating everybody else in the small town of Galanos they find before taking refuge in the buildings for the day. In the morning, Gerry and Amanda leave to avoid the coming press but get stuck along a sandy stretch of road. Roy and Elgin update Sheriff Cody (Paul <b>Fix)</b> <b>on</b> the situation and, after realizing the rabbits have escaped the mine, call in the National Guard. As night falls, the rabbits leave Galanos to continue the rampage, making their way to the main town of Ajo and eating and killing everybody in their pathway. Cole proposes using a half-mile wide stretch of electrified railroad track as a fence to contain and kill the rabbits. They recruit a large group of people at a drive in theater to help herd the rabbits with their car lights, with assistance from the machine gun fire of the National Guard.|$|E
25|$|The en echelon attack {{continued}} with Anderson's {{division in the}} center. At about 2:45p.m., {{the same time that}} Maney's first attack was being repulsed on the Open Knob, the brigade of Col. Thomas M. Jones began its attack across a valley commanded by a large sinkhole. Jones had no orders to attack from Anderson or Hardee, but moved forward on his own initiative when he heard the sound of firing to his right. As they entered the valley, his men were cut down by musketry and fire from twelve artillery pieces on the next ridge, where the Union 9th Brigade (Rousseau's division) under Col. Leonard A. Harris was posted. Confederate artillery attached to Jones's brigade, Capt. Charles Lumsden's Alabama Light Artillery, returned fire, but due to an optical illusion that made two successive ridges look the same, were unable to <b>fix</b> <b>on</b> the appropriate range and their fire had no effect on the Federal line. At 3:30p.m., the Confederate brigade of Brig. Gen. John C. Brown moved up {{to take the place of}} Jones's retreating men. By this time, most of the Union artillery had had to withdraw to replenish their ammunition, so Brown's men did not suffer the same fate as Jones's. Nevertheless, they made no headway against the infantry units in place until successes on the Confederate left put pressure on the Union position.|$|E

500|$|Early on 25 May, Bismarck doubled back {{past her}} pursuers {{in a wide}} circle. The {{manoeuvre}} successfully shook off the British ships, which turned west {{in an attempt to}} find the ship. Despite the manoeuvre, Admiral Lütjens was unaware that he had evaded the British, and so sent a series of radio transmissions, which were intercepted by the British and used to gain a rough <b>fix</b> <b>on</b> his position. Due to the damage his ship had sustained, Lütjens decided to head for occupied France rather than continue his mission. On the morning of 26 May, a Coastal Command PBY Catalina flying boat spotted Bismarck [...] to the north-west of Brest; she was steaming at a speed that would put her under the protective umbrella of German aircraft and U-boats within 24hours. The only British forces close enough to slow her down were the aircraft carrier [...] and her escort, the battlecruiser [...] At approximately 20:30, a flight of fifteen Ark Royals 820 Naval Air Squadrons Swordfish torpedo bombers launched an attack on Bismarck. Three torpedoes were believed to have struck the ship; the first two torpedoes failed to do serious damage to the ship, but the third hit jammed Bismarcks rudders hard to starboard. The damage could not be repaired, and the battleship began turning in a large circle, back towards her pursuers.|$|E

2500|$|One way {{to divide}} various consequentialisms {{is by the}} types of {{consequences}} that are taken to matter most, that is, which consequences count as good states of affairs.

Closely related is eudaimonic consequentialism, according to which a full, flourishing life, {{which may or may not}} be the same as enjoying a great deal of pleasure, is the ultimate aim. Similarly, one might adopt an aesthetic consequentialism, in which the ultimate aim is to produce beauty. However, one might <b>fix</b> <b>on</b> non-psychological goods as the relevant effect. Thus, one might pursue an increase in material equality or political liberty instead of something like the more ephemeral [...] "pleasure".

2500|$|A {{forensic}} engineering {{team from}} the Louisiana State University, using sonar, showed {{that at one point}} near the 17th Street Canal breach, the piling extends just [...] below sea level, [...] shallower than the Corps of Engineers had maintained.
