60|$|The first peer of the name, the <b>first</b> <b>purchaser</b> of the grants, was a Mr. Russell, {{a person}} of an ancient gentleman's family, raised by being a minion of Henry the Eighth. As there {{generally}} is some resemblance of character to create these relations, the favorite was in all likelihood much such another as his master. The first of those immoderate grants was not taken from the ancient demesne of the crown, but from the recent confiscation of the ancient nobility of the land. The lion, having sucked the blood of his prey, threw the offal carcass to the jackal in waiting. Having tasted once the food of confiscation, the favorites became fierce and ravenous. This worthy favorite's first grant was from the lay nobility. The second, infinitely improving on {{the enormity of the}} first, was from the plunder of the Church. In truth, his Grace is somewhat excusable for his dislike to a grant like mine, not only in its quantity, but in its kind, so different from his own.|$|E

5000|$|Marketing {{assessments}} are a term in United States agriculture policy.

However, the 1996 farm bill (P.L. 104-127) eliminated a milk marketing assessment. The 2002 farm bill (P.L. 107-171) eliminated the assessments for peanuts and sugar. Tobacco was subject to a no-net-cost assessment on all marketings to offset Commodity Credit Corporation (CCC) losses on price support loan operations until support was ended in 2005 under the quota buyout provision (P.L. 108-357, Title VI).|$|R
