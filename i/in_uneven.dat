5|$|The {{walls of}} Caernarfon were {{built at the}} same time as the castle, under the overall {{supervision}} of Master James of Saint George, Edward's chief architect in North Wales. Between 1283 and 1284, Richard the Engineer acted as James' deputy on the site; later, between 1295 and 1308, Walter of Hereford performed a similar role, and may have also been responsible for earlier work on the walls as well. Huge amounts of labourers were mobilised from across England for the task, massed at Chester and then brought into Wales for each summer building season. Work on the walls progressed quickly, albeit <b>in</b> <b>uneven</b> bursts: local houses were demolished to make way for the fortifications and the stone walls and gates were probably finished by 1292. The cost of building the town walls was around £3,500, a large sum for the period.|$|E

25|$|This process, polar auxin transport, is directional, very {{strictly}} regulated, {{and based}} <b>in</b> <b>uneven</b> distribution of auxin efflux carriers on the plasma membrane, which send auxins {{in the proper}} direction.

25|$|Mercury's density {{implies a}} solid iron-rich core that {{accounts}} for about 60% of its volume (75% of its radius). Mercury's magnetic equator is shifted nearly 20% of the planet's radius towards the north, the largest ratio of all planets.

Additionally, the offset magnetic dipole may result <b>in</b> <b>uneven</b> surface weathering by the solar wind, knocking more surface particles up into the southern exosphere and transporting them for deposit in the north.

2500|$|Power {{plants on}} Maui and the Big Island {{automatically}} shut off power to prevent damage, and generators tripped on Oahu, causing overloads in the electrical grid.

Power was restored to all HECO circuits by 1:55 am; however, there were isolated blackouts due to local problems, such as blown fuses. Power in Laie and Kahuku was not restored until 3 am.

2500|$|The size of {{a needle}} is {{described}} first by its diameter and secondly by its length. [...] The size of the new stitch is determined {{in large part by}} the diameter of the knitting needle used to form it, because that affects the length of the yarn-loop drawn through the previous stitch. [...] Thus, large stitches can be made with large needles, whereas fine knitting requires fine needles. In most cases, the knitting needles being used in hand-knitting are of the same diameter; however, <b>in</b> <b>uneven</b> knitting, needles of different sizes may be used. Larger stitches may also be made by wrapping the yarn more than once around the needles with every stitch. The length of a needle determines how many stitches it can hold at once; for example, very large projects such as a shawl with hundreds of stitches might require a longer needle than a small project such as a scarf or bootie. [...] Various sizing systems for needles are in common use.|$|E
2500|$|Starting in 1844, Rodman {{began running}} {{experiments}} {{to overcome the}} size limitations of cast iron cannon due {{to the way they}} were made. Up to that time, all cannon barrels made of iron were cast solid and then cooled only on their outside, resulting <b>in</b> <b>uneven</b> cooling when the metal contracted toward the barrel's outer surface. This process also [...] "created internal strains and structural irregularities," [...] and these problems were even more prevalent in large bore castings, especially on any actual openings in the cannon that were designed. Made in this way, the cannons could crack during the cooling process, break apart during shipment, or worse burst as they were fired. Although it took him years, Rodman developed a way to solve these drawbacks. He found that if he cast the iron around a hollow core and then applied a steady stream of water within the barrel for cooling, a much more reliable and stronger product was made. His method, and the result, has been described as: [...] "Water circulating through the tube cooled the bore while coals were piled against the mold to keep the outer surface hot. Rodman's manufacturing method, now known as the 'wet chill process', forced the impurities outward while the outer metal shrank against the hardened interior." [...] Doing this forced the thickest material {{toward the center of the}} barrel, and Rodman would then patent this invention.|$|E
