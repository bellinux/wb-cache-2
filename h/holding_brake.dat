5|$|The Dive Coaster is a steel {{roller coaster}} {{manufactured}} by Bolliger & Mabillard where riders experience {{a moment of}} free-falling {{with at least one}} near 90-degree drop. Unlike other roller coasters where the lift hill takes the train directly to the first drop, a Dive Coaster lift hill leads to a flat section of track followed by a <b>holding</b> <b>brake</b> which stops the train just as it enters the vertical drop. After a few seconds, the train is released into the drop.|$|E
25|$|The trams had {{a primary}} dynamic braking {{controlled}} through 12 stages. There are also pnumatic drum brakes, {{although they are}} only used for parking, braking form the back end and for a passenger-induced emergency brake. The MO units were instead equipped with clasp brakes controlled by pneumatics. Trailers were equipped with solenoid brakes, but lacked a parking brake as {{it was found that}} the motor unit's <b>holding</b> <b>brake</b> was sufficient., In addition all units had an emergency rail brake. The trams were connected with Albert couplers.|$|E
500|$|Once {{the floor}} drops {{and the front}} gate opens, the train is {{dispatched}} straight into the [...] lift hill. Once at the top, the train continues going straight {{for a short period}} before making a left turn into the <b>holding</b> <b>brake.</b> After about three seconds, the train descends the 87-degree drop and reaches a speed of [...] At the bottom, the train enters the [...] "monster's" [...] mouth, followed by a splashdown. Then, the train goes through an Immelmann loop. After going over an airtime hill, the train makes a banked right turn into the final brake run. The train makes a left turn into the brake run before entering the station. One cycle lasts just under two minutes.|$|E
5000|$|Power off <b>brakes</b> stop or <b>hold</b> a load when {{electrical}} power is either accidentally lost or intentionally disconnected. In the past, {{some companies have}} referred to these as [...] "fail safe" [...] brakes. These brakes are typically used on or near an electric motor. Typical applications include robotics, <b>holding</b> <b>brakes</b> for Z axis ball screws and servo motor brakes. Brakes are available in multiple voltages and can have either standard backlash or zero backlash hubs. Multiple disks {{can also be used}} to increase brake torque, without increasing brake diameter. There are 2 main types of <b>holding</b> <b>brakes.</b> The first is spring applied brakes. The second is permanent magnet brakes.|$|R
50|$|Murray's Corner is {{the final}} corner before Pit Straight and the lowest point of the circuit. It is a 90-degree left hand turn, and is a good {{overtaking}} spot as drivers <b>hold</b> <b>braking</b> duels for the corner. It was previously called Pit Corner before Bill Murray crashed his Hudson racing car there in 1946.|$|R
50|$|Soaring {{high above}} the County Fair section of the park, this massive {{dual-track}} wooden racing coaster spans almost the entire {{southern edge of the}} park. The out-and-back design features a very recognizable 560-degree helix at the turnaround point and a first drop that dips 20 ft below ground level. An original design feature was a set of <b>holding</b> <b>brakes</b> that would perch trains {{at the top of the}} lift hill for a brief moment, giving riders a bird's-eye view before releasing them to soar down the 147 ft-tall (45 m) first drop at a 55-degree angle. Use of the <b>holding</b> <b>brakes</b> was short-lived and the brakes themselves were eventually removed so that the trains just go right down the drop. The ride was also originally designed to run with a total of six trains; however, that number has since been reduced to four (two per track). American Eagle uses three-bench, five-car trains built by the Philadelphia Toboggan Company. The trains were originally designed with single-position lap bars but are now equipped with individual lap bars and seatbelts, making the trains on both American Eagle and Viper similar.|$|R
500|$|After {{the floors}} drop {{and the front}} gate opens, the train is {{dispatched}} from the station and makes a downward right turn immediately followed by an upward right turn which leads directly to 45-degree inclined chain lift hill. Once the train reaches {{the top of the}} [...] lift, it makes a right turn into a <b>holding</b> <b>brake</b> where the train slowly moves over the first drop (which is [...] ), stops for a few seconds, and then is released down the 90 degree drop. By the time the train makes it {{to the bottom of the}} drop, it reaches its maximum speed of [...] Then, the train enters an Immelmann loop before dropping back to the ground and making a banked upward left turn into the mid course brake run. After the train slows down, it enters a second [...] 90 degree drop into another Immelmann loop. Following a small airtime hill, the train goes through a splashdown which sprays two [...] lines of water in the air. Finally, the train makes a banked turn to the left leading into the final brake run. One cycle of the ride lasts three minutes.|$|E
500|$|After {{the floors}} retract {{and the front}} gate opens, the train leaves the station and makes a {{downward}} right turn, immediately followed by an upward right turn, {{which leads to the}} 45-degree inclined chain lift hill. Once the train reaches the top of the [...] lift, it turns right into a <b>holding</b> <b>brake</b> where it slowly moves over the first drop, stops for about four seconds, and then descends the 90-degree drop. As the train reaches the bottom of the first drop it reaches its maximum speed of [...] Then, the train enters a [...] Immelmann loop before making a banked, upward, 3.5 g left turn into the mid course brake run. The train slows down and descends a , near 90-degree drop into an underground tunnel. Next, the train makes a right overbanked turn leading into a splashdown that sprays two [...] lines of water in the air and takes approximately 1.9 seconds to pass through. The train rises, makes a downward right turn, then enters the final brake run that leads directly back to the station. One cycle of the ride lasts about 2 minutes and 20 seconds.|$|E
5000|$|The ride's layout {{consists}} of two vertical spikes, one twisted and the other straight vertical with a <b>holding</b> <b>brake,</b> connected by a launch and station tract to form a basic [...] "U" [...] layout. The original ride began with riders being launched forward {{by the use of}} linear induction motors. After the initial launch, the train heads up the twisted vertical spike that twists the train 180 degrees. The train then falls and is launched backwards up the vertical spike. It shuttles back and forth three times. On the final full speed launch in reverse the <b>holding</b> <b>brake</b> {{at the top of the}} vertical rear spike engages, locking the train in place for a very brief moment. The modern day ride is more or less the same, however the <b>holding</b> <b>brake</b> is no longer operational. Valleyfair's Steel Venom is currently the only Intamin Impulse Coaster in the United States operating with the <b>holding</b> <b>brake</b> still functional.|$|E
50|$|The {{five-speed}} {{manual transmission}} {{is equipped with}} Incline Start Assist which, on an incline, <b>holds</b> the <b>brake</b> for a second after releasing it to allow for time to depress the accelerator.|$|R
50|$|This {{comprises}} {{a pair of}} rectangular open boxes {{which are}} mounted on the brake calipers of a bicycle and that <b>hold</b> the <b>brake</b> blocks which rub {{on the rim of}} a bicycle wheel to slow the bicycle down or stop it.|$|R
50|$|Figure eights allow fast but {{controlled}} descent on a rope. They {{are easy}} {{to set up and}} are effective in dissipating the heat caused by friction but can have a tendency to cause a rope to twist. <b>Holding</b> the <b>brake</b> hand off to the side twists the rope, whereas <b>holding</b> the <b>brake</b> hand straight down, parallel to the body, allows a controlled descent without twisting the rope. An 8 descender can wear a rope more quickly than a tube style belay/rappel device because of the many bends it puts into the rope. Many sport climbers also avoid them because of the extra bulk a Figure 8 puts on the climbing rack. However, many ice climbers prefer to use the 8, because {{it is much easier to}} thread with stiff or frozen rope.|$|R
50|$|The first {{installation}} in the United States was Superman: Ultimate Escape at Six Flags Ohio in Aurora, Ohio. Built in 2000, {{it was the}} first Intamin Impulse roller coaster to feature a vertical twist and a <b>holding</b> <b>brake</b> on the rear tower. The largest installation, Wicked Twister built in 2002 at Cedar Point in Sandusky, Ohio, did away with the straight section containing the <b>holding</b> <b>brake</b> and instead had a second twisting tower. V2: Vertical Velocity at Six Flags Discovery Kingdom in Vallejo, California originally had the twisted front and vertical rear towers when it was built in 2001. However, upon discovery of breaking the 150 ft. height restriction in the Vallejo area, the ride was altered to have a front section slanting at 45 degrees into an inline roll which ended with a straightaway, and the rear tower was lowered to the 150 ft height limit. The <b>holding</b> <b>brake</b> was also turned off, and has not been used since. V2: Vertical Velocity reopened in 2002, and is unique among Inverted Impulse roller coasters for being the only one with a true inversion. In 2004, Superman: Ultimate Escape was renamed to Steel Venom after Six Flags sold Six Flags Worlds of Adventure (which Six Flags Ohio had been renamed to after merging with adjacent SeaWorld Ohio in 2001) to Cedar Fair and the park reverted to its original name Geauga Lake. It operated under that name until the end of Geauga Lake's 2006 season and then was moved to Dorney Park and Wildwater Kingdom in Allentown, Pennsylvania. In 2008 the ride opened under the name Voodoo but was changed to Possessed the following year. The ride continues to operate at Dorney Park {{and is one of the}} few Inverted Impulse Roller Coasters that has, and still uses, the vertical <b>holding</b> <b>brake.</b>|$|E
50|$|The coaster's single seven-car (28-passenger) train {{runs along}} a 200 m (656 ft) U-shaped track, {{incorporating}} two 185 ft vertical spikes. The forward spike incorporates a twisted spiral, and the rearward spike provides a straight freefall. The 20 m (65 ft) train, propelled by linear induction motors (LIMs), is accelerated {{in less than}} four seconds to 70 mph toward the forward tower before dropping back down through the station house and up the rearward tower. A <b>holding</b> <b>brake</b> is incorporated on the rear straight tower and is able to suspend the train momentarily (usually on the final ascent during each ride) before dropping it back down to the station house. However, the <b>holding</b> <b>brake</b> has not been used since September 2008 due to maintenance issues. The train passes, at speed, through the station four times per 2700 ft ride and is smoothly braked by eddy-current braking before being brought into final position at the station by the LIMs. Vertical Velocity is similar to Steel Venom at Valleyfair, and also similar to Possessed at Dorney Park and Wildwater Kingdom.|$|E
5000|$|Riders then queue at loading gates. The {{trains are}} {{unchanged}} from before, but {{they no longer}} glow in the dark. Pulling out of the loading station and approaching the control tower while receiving the safety spiel (unchanged from before), the trains make a 180-degree turn and {{come to a stop}} at a <b>holding</b> <b>brake,</b> and wait for the train in front to clear the block on the lift hill. After a few seconds, the <b>holding</b> <b>brake</b> is released and the trains roll down a drop into the strobe tunnel. The strobe lights flash at a slower rate, but the frequency rate gradually increases as the train progresses down the tunnel. A repetitive warping sound signifies an energy charge as the riders roll towards a blue [...] (which replaced a mirror). At {{the far end of the}} tunnel, a field of stars appears as the blue strobe lights turn off. As the train starts its 180 degree turn to the lift hill, the white flash of a strobe light is seen. This is actually the flash of a new on-ride photo camera.|$|E
40|$|This paper {{describes}} a method ofcontrolling {{the position of}} a manipulator composed of active and passive joints. The active joints have actuators and position sensors. The passive joints have <b>holding</b> <b>brakes</b> instead of actuators. While the brakes are released, the passive joints are indirectly controlled by the motion of the active joints using the coupling characteristics of manipulator dynamics. While the brakes are engaged, the passive joints are fixed and the activejoints are controlled. The position of the manipulator is controlled by combining these two control modes. This paper describes the basic principle of the control method and the conditions that ensure the controllability of the passive joints. An algorithm for point-to-point control of the manipulator is also presented. The feasibility of the method is demonstrated by simulations for a manipulator with two degrees of freedom...|$|R
40|$|The authors {{propose a}} method of {{controlling}} {{the position of a}} manipulator with passive joints that have <b>holding</b> <b>brakes</b> instead of actuators. In this method, the coupling characteristics of manipulator dynamics are used, and no additional mechanisms are required. In this paper, the effectiveness of the method is verified by experiments using a prototype manipulator. The prototype is a two-degree-of-freedom (dof), horizontally articulated manipulator. The first axis is an active joint, and the second axis is a passive joint. While the brake of the passive joint is released, the passive joint is indirectly controlled by the motion of the active joint through the use of dynamic coupling. While the brake is engaged, the active joint is controlled. By combining these two control modes, total position of the manipulator is controlled. The experiments show that the precise positioning of the passive joint is feasible by use of the proposed method...|$|R
5000|$|Automatic {{brakes on}} the other hand use the air or vacuum {{pressure}} to <b>hold</b> the <b>brakes</b> off against a reservoir carried on each vehicle, which applies the brakes if pressure/vacuum is lost in the train pipe. Automatic brakes are thus largely [...] "fail safe", though faulty closure of hose taps can lead to accidents such as the Gare de Lyon accident.|$|R

50|$|After {{climbing}} {{to the top}} of the lift hill, the train begins turning to the left before being suspended over a vertical drop on a <b>holding</b> <b>brake.</b> After a few seconds, the train is released and plummets down the vertical drop into a subterranean tunnel. After levelling out and ascending back out from the tunnel, the train flips through an immelmann and over an airtime hill, before navigating a 270° helix. Proceeding from the helix, the train passes through a heartline roll before entering the brake section and returning to the station.|$|E

50|$|On lap 26, Mansell's {{lead was}} 18.8 seconds over Senna, {{but he was}} {{beginning}} to experience cramps in his right leg.

50|$|Permanent magnet type - A {{permanent}} magnet <b>holding</b> <b>brake</b> looks {{very similar to}} a standard power applied electromagnetic brake. Instead of squeezing a friction disk, via springs, it uses {{permanent magnet}}s to attract a single face armature. When the brake is engaged, the permanent magnets create magnetic lines of flux, which can in turn attract the armature to the brake housing. To disengage the brake, power {{is applied to the}} coil which sets up an alternate magnetic field that cancels out the magnetic flux of the permanent magnets.|$|E
50|$|Once riders {{are seated}} and restrained, the train makes a {{right out of}} the station and begins to climb the 65 m lift hill. Once at the top, the train makes a U-turn to the right and comes to a stop by a <b>holding</b> <b>brake,</b> right before {{dropping}}. After a few seconds, the train drops and enters an immelman loop. The train then enters the mid course brake run, drops into a tunnel and makes a right turn, dropping into the splashdown element. Riders then go through a couple turns and dips and enter the final brake run.|$|E

5000|$|Each brake {{reservoir}} stores air at {{a pressure}} of 7 bar and is fed via a {{pressure reducing valve}} off the Main Reservoir Pipe. The driver's brake handle passes control voltages down three wires to each EP control valve, which allows air from the brake reservoir to pass into the brake cylinder, thereby activating the disc brake. The presence of the voltage <b>holds</b> the <b>brakes</b> off, providing a Fail Safe system.|$|R
25|$|Power {{operated}} parking brakes are {{fitted to}} heavy commercial vehicles with air brakes, such as trucks and buses. These are usually spring applied, with air pressure {{being used to}} <b>hold</b> the <b>brake</b> off and powerful springs <b>holding</b> the <b>brakes</b> on. In most cases, a small lever in the cab is connected to a valve which can admit air to the parking brake cylinders to release the parking brake, or release the air to apply the brake. On some modern vehicles the valve is operated electrically from a lever or button in the cab. The system is relatively safe since if air pressure is lost the springs will apply the brakes. Also, the system prevents the parking brake being released if there is insufficient air pressure to apply the foot brake. A disadvantage to this system {{is that if a}} vehicle requires towing and cannot provide its own air supply, an external supply must be provided to allow the parking brake to be released, or the brake shoes must be manually wound off against the springs.|$|R
40|$|International audienceA {{fiber optic}} two-color {{pyrometer}} {{was developed for}} brake disc surface temperature and emissivity measurements. The two-color pyrometer consists of a fluoride glass optical fiber, two HgCdTe detectors equipped with bandwidth filters and a data conditioning and acquisition device. The two-color pyrometer measures the brake disc temperature in the 200 - 800 °C range with a time resolution of 8 μs. The calibration formula for the signals obtained using a blackbody of known temperature is used to compute the true temperature. The uncertainty estimation for temperature and emissivity {{was obtained from the}} calibration results. Tests were carried out on known temperature target and a good correlation was found between results obtained with our two-color pyrometer and those obtained with a commercial two-color pyrometer. <b>Hold</b> <b>braking</b> and deceleration braking tests performed on a braking test bench enabled us to reach the brake disc surface temperature and emissivity during braking. Experimental results show a significant variation of emissivity during braking. Direct measurement of emissivity was carried out on the brake disc after braking and shows the emissivity dependence with the surface quality...|$|R
5000|$|Once {{the floor}} drops {{and the front}} gate opens, the train is {{dispatched}} straight into the 41 m lift hill.

50|$|Diving Machine G5 {{starts right}} out of the station and engages the lift chain which slowly takes them up the 45-degree angle lift hill to a dizzying height. The train then makes a turn to the right and brakes violently. Riders then hear a small click and slow down as they engage the <b>holding</b> <b>brake</b> and stop right on the edge. After the car {{completely}} stops, three seconds pass before the car is released down the 87 degree drop and under a bridge into the tunnel, where riders experience a blast of air and 5 G-forces. After exiting the tunnel, riders traverse a massive overbanked turn to the right, drop slightly, then are treated to a burst of airtime as they dip and rise into the final brake run, just as the camera flash goes off. The ride's layout is a mirror image of Oblivion at Alton Towers.|$|E
50|$|After {{the floors}} drop {{and the front}} gate opens, the train is {{dispatched}} from the station and makes a downward right turn immediately followed by an upward right turn which leads directly to 45-degree inclined chain lift hill.

By the time the train makes it {{to the bottom of the}} drop, it reaches its maximum speed of 71 mph. Then, the train enters an immelmann loop before dropping back to the ground and making a banked upward left turn into the mid course brake run. After the train slows down, it enters a second 130 ft 90 degree drop into another immelmann loop. Following a small airtime hill, the train goes through a splashdown which sprays two 50 ft lines of water in the air.
