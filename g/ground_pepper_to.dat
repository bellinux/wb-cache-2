50|$|The {{popularity}} of the cucumber sandwich reached its upper-class zenith in the Edwardian era, when cheap labour and plentiful coal enabled cucumbers to be produced in hotbeds under glass {{through most of the}} year. With the declining {{popularity of}} tea as a meal in the United Kingdom, there was a corresponding decline in the popularity of cucumber sandwiches, but they are still frequently served at teas, luncheons, and gatherings. Most English cricket clubs supply malt vinegar and <b>ground</b> <b>pepper</b> <b>to</b> dash inside the sandwich, and this is the simplest form commonly used in England.|$|E

5000|$|The Hoxne hoard pepper pot, {{commonly}} known as the Empress pepper pot, although it now seems not to represent an empress, is a silver piperatorium, partially gilded, dating from around 400 AD. It was found as part of the Hoxne Hoard in Hoxne, Suffolk, in November 1992, and is now in the British Museum, where it is normally on display. It is a hollow silver statuette of the top half of a woman's body, with a mechanism <b>to</b> allow <b>ground</b> <b>pepper</b> or spices <b>to</b> be loaded into its base and then shaken out. The mechanism does not grind the pepper and has a rotatable disc with three positions. One position allows filling, another has fine holes <b>to</b> allow <b>ground</b> <b>pepper</b> out and another allows the pot to be closed. [...] The pot was chosen as part of the 2010 BBC Radio 4 series, A History of the World in 100 Objects, as item 40.|$|R
5000|$|Like most {{characters}} in Watchmen, Rorschach has no obvious [...] "superpowers". He merely has his strong will, peak-human physical strength, and finely-honed sense of timing and precision. Rorschach is very resourceful and creative, adapting ordinary household objects into tools or weapons, {{such as the}} use of a can of aerosol spray in combination with multiple matches to set fire to a police officer and throwing <b>ground</b> black <b>pepper</b> <b>to</b> blind another police officer, during a confrontation at Moloch's house. During the series he is shown to use cooking fat, a toilet bowl, a cigarette, a fork and his jacket all as weapons; he is also shown using a coat hanger as a makeshift measuring device. He owns a gas-powered grappling gun, which he uses to climb buildings (and once as a makeshift harpoon gun against a police officer), as seen in Chapter One, which was designed and built by Nite Owl II.|$|R
40|$|In {{the present}} study, the {{chemical}} and organoleptical properties of hot red pepper grown in GAP region in Southeast of Turkey were investigated.

Sample A had the highest level of invert sugar (20. 8 %), {{while the rest of the}} samples gave close values to each other. The industrial samples (samples A and B) had higher extractable colour (as ASTA unit) and pungency (as Scoville index) values than their traditional counterparts.

40|$|The {{biosafety}} of {{commonly used}} domestic grinding techniques was investigated; {{the effects of}} attrition mills using new (attrition mill 1) and old (attrition mill 2) plates, wooden mortar and pestle, grinding stone and electric blender on iron content of wet-ground staple foods, Vigna unguiculata (cowpea) and Capsicum frutescens (pepper) were examined in this study. Attrition mill 1 was in use 4 weeks prior to this study while the attrition mill 2 had newly installed grinding plate. The wet-ground pepper and cowpea were analyzed using Atomic Absorption Spectrophotometer (AAS). The iron contents of wet- <b>ground</b> foods (<b>pepper</b> and cowpea) from both attrition mills were significantly higher (p> 0. 05) than iron content of ground food using other methods of grinding. A 30 - 40 folds increases in the iron content of ground food samples were detected using attrition mills. <b>Ground</b> <b>pepper</b> from attrition mill 1 showed higher iron contents (4300 ± 474. 35 mg) than <b>pepper</b> <b>ground</b> in attrition mill 2 (3199 ± 281. 68 mg). These values are higher than recommended dietary allowances for iron intake. The increased iron content in <b>ground</b> <b>pepper</b> and cowpea observed {{in the present study}} confirmed the high risk of iron overloading using attrition milling. The level of contamination of ground food increased with use in attrition mills as a result of wear and tear of grinding plates...|$|R
