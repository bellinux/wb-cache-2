25|$|The city {{experiences}} {{the most prominent}} difference among seasons and between temperature extremes among all Brazilian capitals. One reason <b>for</b> <b>that</b> <b>is</b> the highest latitude, which also contributes for the occurrence of 14 hours of daylight in December and 10 hours in June. The population is occasionally dangerously exposed to extremely high UV radiation.|$|E
25|$|Fish {{catchment}} decreased 10 {{times between}} 1989 and 2005. Apart from pollution, another reason <b>for</b> <b>that</b> <b>is</b> hydraulic and engineering works. For example, {{construction of new}} ports in Ust-Luga and Vysotsk and on Vasilievsky Island adversely affected the spawning of fish. Extraction of sand and gravel in the Neva Bay for the land reclamation destroy spawning sites of European smelt.|$|E

25|$|Currently {{advanced}} tournament {{rock and}} roll dancers don't wear petticoats and jeans - as the original {{rock and roll}} dancers did - but rather multi-coloured costumes that are made of elastic artificial fibre and can only be purchased as individual pieces by special tailors. One reason <b>for</b> <b>that</b> <b>is</b> that acrobatic elements have grown more and more dangerous, requiring both freedom of movement and enough durability to avoid tearing.|$|E
25|$|The name of Maodun {{has been}} {{associated}} with Oghuz Khagan, an epic ancestor of the Turkic people. The reason <b>for</b> <b>that</b> <b>is</b> a striking similarity of the Oghuz Khagan biography in the Turko manuscripts (Rashid al-Din, Hondemir, Abulgazi) with the Maodun biography in the Chinese sources (feud between the father and son and murder of the former, the direction and sequence of conquests, etc.), which was first noticed by N.Ya. Bichurin (Compilation of reports, pp.56–57).|$|E
25|$|Early {{archaeology}} {{was largely}} {{an attempt to}} uncover spectacular artifacts and features, or to explore vast and mysterious abandoned cities. Early archaeology was mostly done by upper class, scholarly men. This generalization {{laid the foundation for}} the modern popular view of archaeology and archaeologists. This generalization has been with western culture for a long time. Another popular thought that dates back to this era is that archaeology is monetarily lucrative. A large majority of the general public is under the impression that excavations are undertaken for money and not historical data. It is easy for the general public to hold this notion <b>for</b> <b>that</b> <b>is</b> what is presented to them through general media, and has been for many decades.|$|E

25|$|The {{thickness}} of the wall should, in my opinion, be such that armed men meeting {{on top of it}} may pass one another without interference. In the thickness there should be set a very close succession of ties made of charred olive wood, binding the two faces of the wall together like pins, to give it lasting endurance. <b>For</b> <b>that</b> <b>is</b> a material which neither decay, nor the weather, nor time can harm, but even though buried in the earth or set in the water it keeps sound and useful forever. And so not only city walls but substructures in general and all walls that require a thickness like that of a city wall, will be long in falling to decay if tied in this manner.|$|E
25|$|Because of the {{controversy}} over Westropp's Mesolithic and Mortillet's Gap beginning in 1872 archaeological attention focused mainly on the revolution at the Palaeolithic—Neolithic boundary as {{an explanation of the}} gap. For a few decades the Neolithic Period, as it was called, was described as a kind of revolution. In the 1890s, a standard term, the Neolithic Revolution, began to appear in encyclopedias such as Pears. In 1925 the Cambridge Ancient History reported:There are quite a large number of archaeologists who justifiably consider the period of the Late Stone Age to be a neolithic revolution and an economic revolution at the same time. <b>For</b> <b>that</b> <b>is</b> the period when primitive agriculture developed and cattle breeding began.|$|E
25|$|Shrove Tuesday {{is a day}} to {{be remembered}} by strangers in New Orleans, <b>for</b> <b>that</b> <b>is</b> the day for fun, frolic, and comic masquerading. All of the {{mischief}} {{of the city is}} alive and wide awake in active operation. Men and boys, women and girls, bond and free, white and black, yellow and brown, exert themselves to invent and appear in grotesque, quizzical, diabolic, horrible, strange masks, and disguises. Human bodies are seen with heads of beasts and birds, beasts and birds with human heads; demi-beasts, demi-fishes, snakes' heads and bodies with arms of apes; man-bats from the moon; mermaids; satyrs, beggars, monks, and robbers parade and march on foot, on horseback, in wagons, carts, coaches, cars, , in rich confusion, up and down the streets, wildly shouting, singing, laughing, drumming, fiddling, fifeing, and all throwing flour broadcast as they wend their reckless way.|$|E

25|$|The Hill {{also has}} gone {{but the reason}} <b>for</b> <b>that</b> <b>is</b> {{a little harder to}} pin. Up until the 1990s the Hill was a grassy slope without seating. It was the 'outer ground' costing the least to get in and {{attracting}} working class patronage. The invention of the beer can and the portable cooler in the 1960s increased alcohol consumption at cricket matches which in turn fuelled bad crowd behaviour. In the 1970s the advent of limited overs games held partially at night attracted a different kind of crowd to cricket at the SCG. They were less interested in the subtleties of the game and more in the excitement and spectacle. Brawling and excessive drinking were features of the crowd on the Hill at this time. Even the introduction of individual seating on the Hill failed to completely eradicate crowd misbehaviour. Stricter measures such as banning alcohol were later implemented with greater success.|$|E
25|$|Unless {{you have}} secret incriminating {{evidence}} against Furtwängler supporting your accusation {{that he was}} a tool of Nazi Party, I beg to take violent issue with your decision to ban him. The man never was a Party member. Upon numerous occasions, he risked his own safety and reputation to protect friends and colleagues. Do not believe that the fact of remaining in one's own country is alone sufficient to condemn a man. On the contrary, as a military man, you would know that remaining at one's post often requires greater courage than running away. He saved, and for that we are deeply his debtors, the best part of his own German culture... I believe it patently unjust and most cowardly for us to make of Furtwängler a scapegoat for our own crimes. If the man is guilty of specific crimes, accuse him and convict him. As far as I can see, it is no punishment to be banned from sordid, filthy Berlin and if the man now old and ill is willing and anxious to return to his exacting task and responsibilities he should be encouraged <b>for</b> <b>that</b> <b>is</b> where he belongs, right in Berlin...|$|E
25|$|An {{example of}} a {{technology}} that was incorporated into the controller was the touchscreen. It allows the player {{to be able to}} interact with the game differently than before. The person could move around in menus easier and they are also able to interact with different objects in the game. They can pick up some objects, equip others, or even just move the objects out of the players path. Another example is motion sensor where a persons movement is able to be captured and put into a game. Some motion sensor games are based on where the controller is. The reason <b>for</b> <b>that</b> <b>is</b> because there is a signal that is sent from the controller to the console or computer so that the actions being done can create certain movements in the game. Other type of motion sensor games are webcam style where the person can move around in front of it and the actions done are repeated in a character of the game you are playing as.|$|E

In 1909, Kanō {{incorporated}} the Kodokan, and endowed it with ¥10,000 (then about U.S. $4,700). The reason, said Japan Times on 30 March 1913, was [...] "so that this wonderful institution might be able to reconstruct, <b>for</b> <b>that</b> <b>is</b> what it really does, the moral and physical nature of the Japanese youth, without its founder's personal attention." ...|$|E
500|$|Due to {{the lack}} of time in filming, no tracks were filmed that were unreleased, but several {{alternative}} shots and outtakes were held in the Archives du Film du Bois D'Arcy near Paris. At some point, an employee of the owners, MHF Productions, decided this footage was of no value and incinerated all 548 cans of the original 35mm negatives. Maben was particularly frustrated about the lack of additional shots for [...] "One of These Days," [...] which is primarily a Mason solo-piece in the released version. Mason recalls the reason <b>for</b> <b>that</b> <b>is</b> that the reel of film featuring the other members was lost attempting to assemble the original cut.|$|E
500|$|An editor, James Kirke Paulding, {{tried to}} assist him in {{publishing}} this collection. However, Paulding reported back to Poe that the publishers at Harper & Brothers declined the collection, saying that readers were looking for simple, long works like novels. They suggested, [...] "if he will lower himself {{a little to the}} ordinary comprehension of the generality of readers, and prepare... a single work... they will make such arrangements with him as will be liberal and satisfactory." [...] They suggested [...] "if other engagements permit... undertake a Tale in a couple volumes, <b>for</b> <b>that</b> <b>is</b> the magical number." [...] The response from Harper & Brothers inspired Poe to begin a long work and began writing The Narrative of Arthur Gordon Pym of Nantucket. [...] Poe arranged with his boss at the Southern Literary Messenger to publish his novel in several serialized installments at a pay rate of $3 per page.|$|E

40|$|We {{study the}} polynomial-time autoreducibility of NP-complete sets and obtain separations under strong {{hypotheses}} for NP. Assuming {{there is a}} p-generic set in NP, we show the following: - For every k >= 2, there is a k-T-complete set <b>for</b> NP <b>that</b> <b>is</b> k-T autoreducible, but is not k-tt autoreducible or (k- 1) -T autoreducible. - For every k >= 3, there is a k-tt-complete set <b>for</b> NP <b>that</b> <b>is</b> k-tt autoreducible, but is not (k- 1) -tt autoreducible or (k- 2) -T autoreducible. - There is a tt-complete set <b>for</b> NP <b>that</b> <b>is</b> tt-autoreducible, but is not btt-autoreducible. Under the stronger assumption <b>that</b> there <b>is</b> a p-generic set in NP cap coNP, we show: - For every k >= 2, there is a k-tt-complete set <b>for</b> NP <b>that</b> <b>is</b> k-tt autoreducible, but is not (k- 1) -T autoreducible. Our proofs are based on constructions from separating NP-completeness notions. For example, {{the construction of a}} 2 -T-complete set <b>for</b> NP <b>that</b> <b>is</b> not 2 -tt-complete also separates 2 -T-autoreducibility from 2 -tt-autoreducibility...|$|R

500|$|But here I {{would not}} be misunderstood. By the love of our country, I do not mean loyalty to our King, <b>for</b> <b>that</b> <b>is</b> a duty of another nature, and a man may be very loyal, in the common sense of the word, without one grain of public good in his heart. Witness this very kingdom we live in. I verily believe, that since the {{beginning}} of the world, no nation upon earth ever shewed (all circumstances considered), such high constant marks of loyalty in all their action and behaviour as we have done; and at the same time, no people ever appeared more utterly void of what is called public spirit ... therefore, I shall think my time not ill-spent if I can persuade most and all of you who hear me, to shew the love you have for your country by endeavouring in your several situations to do all the public good you can. For I am certain persuaded that all our misfortunes arise from no other original cause than that general disregard among us to the public welfare.|$|E
500|$|Although a {{follower}} of Wagner's reforms of the operatic genre, which he believed would be its salvation, Smetana rejected accusations of excessive Wagnerism, claiming that he was sufficiently occupied with [...] "Smetanism, <b>for</b> <b>that</b> <b>is</b> the only honest style!" [...] The predominantly [...] "national" [...] character of the first four operas is tempered by the lyrical romanticism of those written later, particularly the last three, composed in the years of Smetana's deafness. The first of this final trio, The Kiss, written when Smetana was receiving painful medical treatment, is described by Newmarch {{as a work of}} serene beauty, in which tears and smiles alternate throughout the score. Smetana's librettist for [...] "The Kiss" [...] was the young feminist Eliška Krásnohorská, who also supplied the texts for his final two operas. She dominated the ailing composer, who had no say in the subject-matter, the voice types or the balance between solos, duets and ensembles. Nevertheless, critics have noted few signs of a decline in Smetana's powers in these works, while his increasing proficiency in the Czech language meant that his settings of the language are much superior to those of his earlier operas.|$|E
