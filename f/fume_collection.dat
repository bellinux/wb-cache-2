50|$|Although many scene {{shops are}} located in general purpose building, most are in purpose built spaces because scenic {{fabrication}} has some fairly specific needs. Often they are in very large, open rooms, to accommodate big elements that a show may call for. They are usually attached directly to a loading dock for delivery of materials and shipping of finished elements. If they are attached to a performance venue, it is also common to have large doors providing access to the stage. Typically, compressed air and dust collection systems are distributed around the shop. Many processes in a scene shop such as spray painting, welding, or hot-wire foam cutting produce dangerous gasses, so often extra ventilation is installed. Ideally, <b>fume</b> <b>collection</b> systems are available to use near the actual workpiece. Power is usually available in floor pockets or dropped from the ceiling, {{in a variety of}} voltages, as some tools, especially welders require high voltages. Often, scene shops have designated areas inside for paints, carpentry, metalwork, and sometimes prop construction.|$|E
40|$|AbstractThis paper {{illustrates}} how systems requirements (i. e., safety) are decomposed to define manufacturing process requirements and design. Steelmaking is an energy intensive process; utilizing {{vast amounts of}} electricity, oxygen, and natural gas to liquefy scrap steel. While the electric arc furnace process is used extensively {{around the world to}} melt steel, it is inefficient. Hot gases are lost to <b>fume</b> <b>collection</b> systems and not reused {{in other parts of the}} process. Unknown water leaks inside a furnace can potentially result in catastrophic explosions which can injure personnel or damage equipment. Carbon monoxide (CO), the largest gas by product of steelmaking, has caused several large scale explosions globally resulting in large repair bills. A system to not only detect gases present in the gas steam exiting the furnace but to quantify the amounts being produced can lead to ensuring the furnaces are safer for employees to work around. This paper will break down the decision process in selecting the hybrid probe-laser off-gas system by means of axiomatic design decomposition at an American mini-mill located in Butler, Indiana using the Collective System Design (CSD) methodology utilized at IPFW Center of Excellence in Systems Engineering...|$|E
40|$|This paper elaborates {{on how to}} use {{statistics}} to calculate optimal parameters (including duct diameters) of energy-efficient industrial ventilation systems. Based on the fan-law, on-demand ventilation can save up to 80 % of electricity compared to classical systems. For the purposes of this paper, we consider a classical exhaust ventilation system one that uses constant fan RPM and air velocity in the ducts. There are multiple design and operational challenges to successfully implementing an on-demand system. Several of these challenges and their solutions are described in this paper. The basic idea behind on-demand ventilation is to close ventilation outlets at workstations that are not producing dust (or fumes or mist) and adjust the fan speed accordingly. It is easy to implement such a system if there is no requirement for minimum transport velocities in the ducting, {{as is the case in}} <b>fume</b> <b>collection</b> systems (such as welding shops). The task becomes challenging when particulate matter has to be transported in the duct system because minimum air velocities have to be maintained in every part of the ducting in order to prevent settling (which presents a fire and explosion hazard) ...|$|E
50|$|Cupellation: {{the lead}} bullets {{are placed in}} porous {{crucibles}} (cupels) of bone ash or magnesium oxide and heated in air to about 1000 °C. This is usually carried out in a 'muffle' furnace, containing a refractory muffle (usually nitride-bonded silicon carbide) heated externally by silicon carbide heating elements. A flow of air through the muffle assists oxidation of the lead, and carries the <b>fumes</b> for safe <b>collection</b> outside the furnace unit. The lead melts and oxidises to lead oxide, which in turn melts and is drawn into the pores of the cupel by capillary attraction. The precious metals remain {{in the base of}} the cupel as a 'prill' which is sent for final analysis of precious metal content.In the bullion fire assay process, a sample from the article is wrapped in a lead foil with copper and silver. The wrapped sample, along with prepared control samples, heated at 1650 F (temperature varies with exact method) in a cupel made of compressed bone ash or magnesium oxide powder. Base metals oxidize and absorb into the cupel. The product of this cupellation (doré) is flattened and treated in nitric acid to remove silver. Precision weighing of metal content of samples and process controls (proofs) at each process stage is the basis of the extreme method precision. European assayers follow bullion traditions based in hallmarking regulations. Reputable North American bullion assayers conform closely to ASTM method E1335-04e1. Only bullion methods validated and traceable to accepted international standards obtain genuine accuracies of 1 part in 10,000.|$|R
40|$|The {{effect of}} quench {{conditions}} on the properties of fumed silica generated using an arc process was studied. The process consisted of vaporizing quartz particles in a batch transferred arc reactor using the radiative energy from an Ar/NH$ sb 3 $ thermal plasma. Ammonia was used to increase the vaporization rate of quartz. The hot gas stream exiting the reactor contained a mixture of the decomposition products of NH$ sb 3 $ and SiO$ sb 2 $. This included SiO$ sb{ rm (g) }$, O$ sb 2 $, H$ sb 2 $ and N$ sb 2 $. Rapid quenching of this gas stream with steam resulted {{in the production of}} a <b>fumed</b> silica aerosol. <b>Collection</b> of the product took place in a baghouse filter. The quench conditions studied included pre-quench temperature, T$ sb{ rm q}$, and supersaturation, P$ sb{ rm s}$, quench rate, R$ sb{ rm q}$, and quench stoichiometry, S$ sb{ rm q}$. P$ sb{ rm s}$ was defined as the molar ratio of SiO$ sb{ rm (g) }$ flow, calculated from the quartz weight loss during an experiment, to the SiO$ sb{ rm (g) }$ flow predicted at equilibrium. S$ sb{ rm q}$ was the molar ratio of steam to SiO$ sb{ rm (g) }$ flow. In general, high pre-quench temperatures, high quench rates, and low pre-quench supersaturation ratios, produced high surface area powders. Quench stoichiometry did not have an effect here, but the use of a large excess of steam in the quench caused the degree of surface hydroxylation to be high. In all cases, the characteristic chain-like aggregate shape and an amorphous morphology were produced. The thickening and thixotropic ability of the powders was found to be significant compared to commercial brands of fumed silica. The best fumed silica produced during the study was found to be 46 % as effective as Aerosil$ sp circler$ 200 and 60 % as effective as Cab-O-Sil$ sp circler$ M- 5. The experimentally generated powders were not equivalent to the commercial brands {{due to a lack of}} surface area. (Abstract shortened by UMI. ...|$|R
40|$|In 1994, the <b>fume</b> <b>collection</b> {{system for}} the Desulphurization Station at Dofasco Inc., Hamilton, Ontario was studied for energy and {{maintenance}} optimization. The existing system consisted of two 600 hp fans on a wet scrubber system for two collection hoods and one 600 hp fan on a baghouse collection system for two more collection hoods. The fans for the wet system had been an ongoing maintenance problem with frequent outages due to build-up problems. The scrubber fans were approximately 20 years old while the dust collector was 14 years old. The two scrubber fans were rated at 50, 000 cfm at 55 in. wg (inches water gauge). The baghouse fan was rated at 105, 000 cfm at 17. 5 in. wg. All fans were controlled by inlet dampers which adjusted to a - 4 in. wg inlet pressure set-point depending on whether zero, {{one or both of}} the hoods for a particular system pair were open. The engineering feasibility study completed by FLOWCARE Engineering Inc. was able to prove the following. ?	Through timing changes to the incoming ladle cars, three hoods would be sufficient without affecting production. ?	By adding tip extensions to the fan wheel, the baghouse was able to handle 3 hoods simultaneously. ?	 Wet scrubber could be shut down. The entire project was implemented with 100 % success within two months after studying. The final result was that $ 244, 115 are now saved annually due to scrubber shutdown. Total implementation costs were $ 22, 000. As an added bonus, hood capture volumes were proved to have been increased slightly. This eliminated a small fugitive emission problem that had existed on the hoods of the scrubber system...|$|E
