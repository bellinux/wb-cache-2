50|$|Mustafa Bouyali (Ar. مصطفى بويعلي) was {{the leader}} of the Algerian <b>Islamic</b> <b>Armed</b> <b>Movement,</b> a guerrilla group based around Larbaa south of Algiers, from 1982 to 1987.|$|E
50|$|According to Algerian {{veterans}} of the Afghan jihad who founded the GIA, the idea of forming an armed group to fight jihad against the Algerian government was developed not after the coup but in 1989 after leaders of the <b>Islamic</b> <b>Armed</b> <b>Movement</b> (MIA) of Mustafa Bouyali, were freed from prison, but was not acted on due to the spectacular electoral political success of the FIS.|$|E
50|$|He {{declared}} his group {{independent of the}} existing <b>Islamic</b> <b>Armed</b> <b>Movement</b> (MIA) in January 1993. He was arrested in Morocco and {{handed over to the}} Algerian authorities on 29 September 1993. He was sentenced to death in June 1995. He claims to regret the killing of innocent civilians for which the GIA became notorious, blaming it on his successors who controlled the GIA while he was in prison.|$|E
50|$|Aïssa Messaoudi, nom de guerre Tayeb el-Afghani, was an Algerian Islamist. He {{fought in}} the Afghan War. Together with a fellow Afghan veteran, Abderrahmane Dahane, he {{launched}} {{an attack on the}} Guemmar barracks on November 27, 1991, {{before the start of the}} Algerian Civil War proper; this attack is sometimes considered to mark the beginning of the <b>Armed</b> <b>Islamic</b> <b>Movement</b> (MIA). He was arrested on January 28, 1992.|$|R
5000|$|In 1997, Algeria was at {{the peak}} of a brutal civil {{conflict}} that had begun after the military's cancellation of 1992 elections set to be won by the Islamic Salvation Front (FIS). Bentalha, a town a few km south of Baraki (see map), a satellite town of Algiers, voted FIS in the elections, and many inhabitants were initially in favor of the Islamist guerrilla groups which began fighting the government after the elections' cancellation; some joined them. Initially, the guerrillas in the area belonged to the revived <b>Armed</b> <b>Islamic</b> <b>Movement</b> (MIA) and various independent groups; after 1994, these were integrated into the larger <b>Armed</b> <b>Islamic</b> Group (GIA). The army had a strong presence in the area, with a post on the eastern entrance of the town, a number of roadblocks, and a barracks {{on the north side of}} Baraki. The GIA too had a strong local presence; between 1994 and 1996, they walked the streets of Bentalha openly, and killed people associated with the government. The government established a [...] "Patriot" [...] communal guard of about ten people in Bentalha in June 1996.|$|R
40|$|Over {{the last}} year, the {{situation}} in Russia’s North Caucasus has become further destabilised. Attacks and armed clashes happen daily, and destabilisation is spreading to an increasingly large area. The extent {{of violence in the}} region is so great that it can already be stated that a de facto civil war is taking place, the warring parties being the <b>Islamic</b> <b>armed</b> underground <b>movement</b> which operates under the banner of the so-called Emirate of the North Caucasus, and the secular governments of the individual republics, who are supported by local and federal branches of the Russian Federation’s Interior Ministry and Federal Security Service. Moscow has no idea how to successfully tackle the Caucasus rebellion. Force has proved to be costly and unproductive, while the attempts made since early 2010 to integrate the region with the rest of Russia by implementing development programmes have not brought the desired results, because of widespread corruption and faint interest from businessmen who are afraid to invest in such an unsafe region. A growing problem for Moscow, particularly for the prestige of the state, is attacks by militants on areas near Sochi, where the 2014 Winter Olympics is to take place. It must be assumed that over the next 3 years before the Olympics, Moscow’s priority in the region will be {{to ensure the safety of}} Olympic preparations, and then the games themselves. It cannot be ruled out that the North Caucasus Federal District with its ‘troubled republics’ will be surrounded by a kind of cordon sanitaire (Sochi is situated in the neighbouring Southern Federal District). This could in turn strengthen these republics’ isolation, maintain the state of permanent instability, and postpone the prospects of solving the region’s acute economic and social problems...|$|R
5000|$|Beside's the GIA, {{the other}} major branch of the Algerian {{resistance}} was the <b>Islamic</b> <b>Armed</b> <b>Movement</b> (MIA). It was led by the ex-soldier [...] "General" [...] Abdelkader Chebouti, and was [...] "well-organized and structured and favored a long-term jihad" [...] targeting {{the state and its}} representatives and based on a guerrilla campaign like that of the War of Independence. From prison, Ali Benhadj issued a fatwa giving the MIA his blessing.|$|E
5000|$|They formed {{themselves}} into various armed groups, principally the <b>Islamic</b> <b>Armed</b> <b>Movement</b> (MIA), based {{primarily in the}} mountains, and the more hard-line Armed Islamic Group (GIA), based primarily in the towns. The GIA motto was [...] "no agreement, no truce, no dialogue" [...] and declared war on the FIS in 1994 after it made progress in negotiations with the government. The MIA and various smaller insurgent bands regrouped, becoming the FIS-loyalist Islamic Salvation Army (AIS).|$|E
5000|$|Early in 1992, Mansour Meliani, {{a former}} aid to Bouyali, {{along with many}} [...] "Afghans", broke with his former friend Abdelkader Heresay and left the MIA (<b>Islamic</b> <b>Armed</b> <b>Movement),</b> {{founding}} his own Jihadi group around July 1992. Meliani was arrested in July and executed in August 1993. Meliani was replaced by Mohammed Allal, aka Moh Leveilley, who was killed on 1 September 1992 by the Algerian military when they attacked a meeting held to unify command of the jihad.|$|E
5000|$|In May 1984, the {{government}} released some 92 of his supporters. Within a few months, he returned, reestablished his contacts, reconstituted the MAIA in February 1985, and began fighting again. In August, the group mounted two prominent operations - an armed robbery at {{a factory in}} Algiers on the 21st, and {{an attack on a}} police barracks in Soumaa on the 27th, killing a police cadet and taking weaponry. They painted the phrase [...] "Allah the Avenger is with us!" [...] across the gates of the barracks at Soumaa, to indicate that their motive was not simple criminality. Over the next two years, his group would continue its campaign, inflicting losses on government forces when pursued, but more generally targeting institutions it saw as un-Islamic, such as girls' schools, libraries, restaurants, and cinemas. On February 3, 1987, Bouyali finally fell in an ambush by the security services, and the movement was destroyed. Its surviving members were put on trial in July, with 5 of the 202 tried receiving the death penalty and 15 acquitted. The last of these were released on July 29, 1990. In 1991, several of these, led by Abdelkader Chebouti, reconstituted the organization as the <b>Armed</b> <b>Islamic</b> <b>Movement.</b> Shortly afterwards, some, such as Mansour Meliani, split with it to found the notably more violent <b>Armed</b> <b>Islamic</b> Group.|$|R

5000|$|In July 1982, Bouyali {{took to the}} maquis, with {{significant}} support in local towns, particularly Larbaa. The [...] "Group for Defense against the Illicit" [...] announced its transformation into the Algerian <b>Islamic</b> <b>Armed</b> <b>Movement</b> (MAIA). According to the government, it planned a variety of attacks, including {{the assassination of the}} Prime Minister, which were forestalled by the arrest of 23 of its members in mid-December. Further arrests were made in January 1983. However, Bouyali himself evaded the security forces, and fled abroad (probably either Iran or Libya).|$|E
5000|$|The {{first major}} armed {{movement}} to emerge, starting {{almost immediately after}} the coup, was the <b>Islamic</b> <b>Armed</b> <b>Movement</b> (MIA). It was led by the ex-soldier [...] "General" [...] Abdelkader Chebouti, a longstanding Islamist. The MIA was [...] "well-organized and structured and favored a long-term jihad" [...] targeting {{the state and its}} representatives and based on a guerrilla campaign like that of the War of Independence. From prison, Ali Benhadj issued a fatwa giving the MIA his blessing. In February 1992, ex-soldier, ex-Afghan fighter, and former FIS head of security Said Mekhloufi founded the Movement for an Islamic State (MEI).|$|E
5000|$|Born in 1956 in Tunis {{to parents}} of Mauritanian origin from the wilaya (province) of Adrar in Algeria, Belhadj became {{a teacher of}} Arabic and an Islamist activist in the 1970s. He had close ties to Mustafa Bouyali's <b>Islamic</b> <b>Armed</b> <b>Movement</b> (MIA), and was arrested in 1983 and {{sentence}} in 1985 by a state security court.In 1989, after the Algerian Constitution was changed to allow multiparty democracy, he helped found the FIS, an Islamic party which won the first (and so far only) free elections in Algeria since its independence. He was considered the co-head or number two leader of the FIS, along with president Abassi Madani. [...] During this period, he was a preacher at the famous Al-Sunna mosque in Bab el-Oued, a district in Algiers.|$|E

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to examine the {{influence}} of <b>arm</b> <b>movements</b> on lower limb movement and muscle activation during treadmill walking after a stroke. Ten high functioning stroke and 10 healthy subjects walked on a treadmill while swinging their arms naturally, and while holding onto handles that were either fixed in place or allowed to slide along horizontal handrails. Full-body kinematics were recorded, along with bilateral surface electromyography from lower limb muscles. <b>Arm</b> <b>movements</b> influenced lower limb muscle activity but had little effect on movement patterns at the joints. When handrails were present a small amount of weight was borne through the upper limbs, and for stroke subjects this was reduced when the handles were free to slide. Activity of proximal leg muscles during stance was affected by the weight borne through the upper limbs, increasing when <b>arm</b> <b>movements</b> were performed. Soleus activity during stance was greatest with unsupported <b>arm</b> <b>movements.</b> In stroke subjects, early stance tibialis anterior activity in the paretic leg was greatest with no <b>arm</b> <b>movements,</b> and early swing tibialis anterior activity in both legs was greatest with unsupported <b>arm</b> <b>movements.</b> Many of the changes in muscle activation appeared to be due to changes in postural stability that occurred when performing <b>arm</b> <b>movements.</b> Overall, results support further study of the long-term changes associated with the inclusion of <b>arm</b> <b>movements</b> in gait rehabilitation protocols...|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to examine the {{relationship}} between fear of falling and the <b>arm</b> <b>movements</b> in the elderly women. The subjects consisted of 48 elderly women (mean age, 74. 8 ± 7. 1 years) and 10 young women (20. 9 ± 0. 3 years). Fear of falling and experiences of falls in the previous year were investigated, and forward, lateral, and downward <b>arm</b> <b>movement</b> times in the standing position were measured. The <b>arm</b> <b>movement</b> time was compared with the degrees of fear of falling, as well as with the presence and absence of experiences of falls. The results indicated that the average <b>arm</b> <b>movement</b> time was longer in the elderly women than in the young women, but the presence or absence of falling experience did not influence that time the average <b>arm</b> <b>movement</b> time was longer in the elderly women who were very fearful of falling than in the young women or the elderly women without such a fear, and the average downward <b>arm</b> <b>movement</b> time was longer in the elderly women who were moderately fearful of falling than in the young women. This study suggest that the <b>arm</b> <b>movement</b> time is prolonged in elderly women with a fear of falling, even in a presence of moderate fear of falling, and downward <b>arm</b> <b>movement</b> is particularly associated with such a fear...|$|R
40|$|Facilitation of leg muscle {{activity}} by active <b>arm</b> <b>movements</b> during locomotor tasks could be beneficial during gait rehabilitation after spinal cord injury. The present study explored {{the effects of}} <b>arm</b> <b>movements</b> on leg muscle activity during sub-maximal recumbent stepping. Healthy subjects exercised on a recumbent stepping machine both with and without <b>arm</b> <b>movements.</b> Activity of five leg muscles was recorded and compared for stepping with and without <b>arm</b> <b>movements.</b> To determine which <b>arm</b> <b>movements</b> are optimal for leg muscle facilitation, subjects were instructed to step with 1) mechanically coupled vs. decoupled <b>arm</b> and leg <b>movements,</b> 2) synchronous (SYNC) vs. asynchronous (ASYNC) <b>arm</b> <b>movements</b> and 3) at 50 vs. 70 revolutions per minute (RPM). Leg muscle activity was increased by active <b>arm</b> <b>movements</b> in all muscles, except the vastus lateralis (VL) muscle. Activity of other extensors (soleus (SO), medial gastrocnemius (MG) and biceps femoris (BF)) was primarily increased during the extension phase whereas activity of flexors (tibialis anterior (TA)) was also increased during the flexion phase. Facilitation {{was more or less}} consistent for both frequencies and for SYNC and ASYNC <b>movements.</b> For coupled <b>arm</b> <b>movements</b> facilitation tended to be diminished or absent. The observed facilitation in the present study is probably of neuromuscular rather than of biomechanical origin, since the arms are probably hardly involved in postural control or weight-bearing during recumbent stepping. Further studies in patients should explore the possibility to integrate neuromuscular facilitation in rehabilitation programs...|$|R

40|$|Objective: This study {{aimed to}} {{determine}} whether fetal <b>arm</b> <b>movements</b> change when music is presented to the mother or directly to the fetus through the mother's lower abdomen, and whether maternal mood influences changes in fetal <b>arm</b> <b>movements.</b> Methods: Using a diagnostic ultrasound apparatus, fetal <b>arm</b> <b>movements</b> were measured in 47 pregnant women in the 35 - 36 th week of pregnancy. Subjects {{were divided into two}} groups: a maternal presentation group, in which the mothers listened to music through headphones; and a fetal presentation group, in which music was presented directly to the fetus through headphones placed on the mother's abdomen. Fetal <b>arm</b> <b>movements</b> were observed and recorded by ultrasound for a total of 10 min (5 min without music followed by 5 min with music). The music used was Mozart's Sonata for Two Pianos in D Major, K. 448. The Profile of Mood States-Brief Form (POMS) was used to investigate the influence of maternal mood on fetal <b>arm</b> <b>movements.</b> Results: In the maternal presentation group, changes in fetal <b>arm</b> <b>movement</b> did not differ between mothers with different moods. In the fetal presentation group, fetal <b>arm</b> <b>movements</b> increased when the mother was energetic and decreased when the mother lacked energy. Fetal <b>arm</b> <b>movement</b> also decreased when the mother had a high level of fatigue and increased when the mother had a low level of fatigue. Conclusion: Presenting music directly to the fetus while the mother is relaxed has the potential to increase fetal response to the music and may possibly promote fetal well-being...|$|R
40|$|Wearable sensor {{technology}} has enabled unobtrusive monitoring of <b>arm</b> <b>movements</b> of stroke survivors {{in the home}} environment. However, the most widely established method, based on activity counts, provides quantitative rather than qualitative information on arm without functional insights, and is sensitive to passive <b>arm</b> <b>movements</b> during ambulatory activities. We propose a method to quantify functionally relevant arm use in stroke survivors relying on a single wrist-worn inertial measurement unit. Orientation of the forearm during movements is measured in order identify gross <b>arm</b> <b>movements.</b> The method is validated in 10 subacute/chronic stroke survivors wearing inertial sensors at 5 anatomical locations for 48  h. Measurements are compared to conventional activity counts and to a test for gross manual dexterity. Duration of gross <b>arm</b> <b>movements</b> of the paretic arm correlated significantly better with the Box and Block Test ([Formula: see text]) than conventional activity counts when walking phases were included ([Formula: see text]), and similar results were found when comparing ratios of paretic and non-paretic <b>arms</b> for gross <b>movements</b> and activity counts. The proposed gross <b>arm</b> <b>movement</b> metric is robust against passive <b>arm</b> <b>movements</b> during ambulatory activities and requires only a single-sensor module placed at the paretic wrist {{for the assessment of}} functionally relevant arm use...|$|R
40|$|The {{coordination}} of <b>arm</b> <b>movements</b> and saccadic eye movements is important {{when we reach}} for an object. Eye and <b>arm</b> <b>movements</b> of healthy human subjects were recorded while these subjects either looked at a single visual target or looked and additionally touched it with the hand. When the target was displaced, the subjects responded {{with one or two}} saccades, and they corrected their <b>arm</b> <b>movement.</b> The reaction time of the second saccade is longer than that of the first and depends on the direction and timing of the target displacement. An <b>arm</b> <b>movement</b> to the same target leads to a reduced reaction time of the first saccade, but to a further increased reaction time of the second saccade. When the target disappeared briefly before its displacement, the reaction times of the saccades and <b>arm</b> <b>movements</b> are reduced. The activity of neurons in the superior colliculus of a monkey performing a double-step saccade task reflects the delay of the saccades...|$|R
40|$|The {{present study}} tested whether {{vestibular}} input can be processed online to control goal-directed <b>arm</b> <b>movements</b> towards memorized visual targets {{when the whole}} body is passively rotated during movement execution. Subjects succeeded in compensating for current body rotation by regulating ongoing <b>arm</b> <b>movements.</b> This performance was compared to the accuracy with which subjects reached for the target when the rotation occurred before the movement. Subjects were less accurate in updating the internal representation of visual space through vestibular signals than in monitoring online body orientation to control <b>arm</b> <b>movement.</b> These results demonstrate that vestibular signals contribute to motor control of voluntary <b>arm</b> <b>movements</b> and suggest that the processes underlying online regulation of goal-directed movements {{are different from those}} underlying navigation-like behaviors...|$|R
40|$|We {{studied the}} {{development}} of postural control during goal-directed reaching and spontaneous <b>arm</b> <b>movements</b> in early infancy. Two groups of infants participated. The first group consisted of 10 healthy infants, who were assessed four times at the ages of 3, 4, 5 and 6 months. Each assessment consisted of simultaneous recording of video-data and surface EMGs of arm, neck, trunk, and leg muscles in various lying and sitting positions. Additionally, postural adjustments during spontaneous <b>arm</b> <b>movements</b> were studied in a second group of five infants aged 1 - 3 months. Already {{before the onset of}} successful reaching, which occurred at 4 - 5 months, both spontaneous and goal-directed <b>arm</b> <b>movements</b> were accompanied by a high amount of postural activity. During the goal-directed <b>arm</b> <b>movements</b> a preference for neck muscle activation and a direction specific organisation (dorsal postural muscles activated before the ventral antagonists) prevailed, whereas during spontaneous <b>arm</b> <b>movements</b> such a specific postural organisation was absent. With increasing age and concurrent with successful reaching, the amount of postural activity decreased. Still, the persisting postural activity continued to become more organised with increasing age. Position affected the postural adjustments accompanying goal-directed <b>arm</b> <b>movements</b> at all ages. (C) 1999 Elsevier Science B. V. All rights reserved...|$|R
40|$|Anatomical and {{empirical}} {{data suggest that}} deep and superficial muscles may have different functions for thoracic spine control. This study investigated thoracic paraspinal muscle activity during anticipatory postural adjustments associated with <b>arm</b> <b>movement.</b> Electromyographic (EMG) recordings were made from the right deep (multifidus/rotatores) and superficial (longissimus) muscles at T 5, T 8, and T 11 levels using fine-wire electrodes. Ten healthy participants performed fast unilateral and bilateral flexion and extension <b>arm</b> <b>movements</b> {{in response to a}} light. EMG amplitude was measured during 25 ms epochs for 150 ms before and 400 ms after deltoid EMG onset. During <b>arm</b> flexion <b>movements,</b> multifidus and longissimus had two bursts of activity, one burst prior to deltoid and a late burst. With arm extension both muscles were active in a single burst after deltoid onset. There was differential activity with respect to direction of trunk rotation induced by <b>arm</b> <b>movement.</b> Right longissimus was most active with left <b>arm</b> <b>movements</b> and right multifidus was most active with right <b>arm</b> <b>movements.</b> All levels of the thorax responded similarly.

Instead of investigating the peripheral causes of falls, some researchers suggest that integration and programming of the central nervous system could be used to treat the age-related declines in balance function (5, 6). This is especially true for self-paced balance disturbances seen in ecological situations during projective rapid <b>arm</b> <b>movements</b> (7). Age-related changes in postural control associated with rapid <b>arm</b> <b>movements</b> inducing self-paced perturbations of balance may be a cause of falls in older adults (8).

40|$|We {{report a}} {{cross-sectional}} and a longitudinal experiment that examined developmental {{changes in the}} relative contribution of monocular and binocular variables in the guidance of interceptive <b>arm</b> <b>movements.</b> Three- to eight-month-old infants were observed while presented with differently sized balls that approached frontally with a constant velocity under both monocular and binocular viewing conditions. Movement onset indicated that with age infants increasingly came to rely on binocular variables in controlling {{the timing of the}} interceptive <b>arm</b> <b>movements.</b> That is, from 7 to 8 months of age movement onset was independent from object size under binocular but not under monocular viewing. In contrast, binocular viewing enhanced the spatial accuracy of the interceptive <b>arm</b> <b>movements</b> at all ages. We concluded that attunement to binocular information is a key process in infants' gaining adaptive control of goal-directed <b>arm</b> <b>movements.</b> However, interceptive <b>arm</b> <b>movements</b> entail the formation of multiple on-line couplings between optic and movement variables, each of which appears to develop at its own pace. © 2005 Elsevier B.
