The measurements, performed along three profiles involving 18 stations, have allowed us to point out very particular properties of the anomalous transient magnetic field and of the telluric field; at each station on the anomaly, these two fields are linearly polarized according to two perpendicular directions. Moreover, these fields have exactly the same time dependence at all the stations on the anomaly. These properties lead us to conclude that the anomalous currents are not locally induced but instead are more probably concentrated and channelled in the shallow sediments of the graben...|$|E
40|$|Summary. If one {{can measure}} the {{anomalous}} horizontal magnetic field {{associated with a}} (locally bounded) two-dimensional conductivity anomaly the transfer function which results from correlating the vertical with the anomalous horizontal magnetic field directly indicates the depth to an equivdent hne-current. A numerical model {{can be used to}} illustrate this. If three-dimensional effects (including current channelling) produce the current anomaly, interpretation in terms of conductive structure would be less clear. It has been claimed (Babour & Mosnier etc.) that such three-dimensional effects are experimentally observed in the highly coherent transfer functions determined from <b>differential</b> <b>geomagnetic</b> <b>sounding</b> experiments. These effects are, specifically, the ‘linear polarization ’ of the anomalous fields, and the invariance of the phase of the measured anomalous field across the anomaly. It is suggested in this present paper that both these effects can be explained in terms of simple local induction models. If the embedded two-dimensional anomaly is sufficiently close to the Earth’s surface, the transfer function (between the vertical and the total horizontal field) contains more information than is usually interpreted. With this in mind, the magnetovariational data collected by Rooney & Hutton in the Kenyan Rift is re-examined. ...|$|E

The data treatment included the calculation of single-station transfer functions and {{the separation of the}} fields into external and internal parts on some profiles. The interpretation was based on the construction of two-dimensional models explaining the observed features. The observed distribu-tion of geomagnetic induction vectors is very regular and the axis of the anomaly runs in the contact region between the outer and inner Carpathians. The thickness of the well-conducting rock complex exceeds 10 km. The well-conducting rocks seem to be the sediments which accumulated in the contact region of the platform. The asymmetry in the distribution of induction vector amplitudes on some profiles can be accounted for by asymmetrical geometry, which is characteristic of the underthrusting of rocks. ...|$|R

A combination of magnetotelluric and <b>geomagnetic</b> depth <b>sounding</b> data {{were used to}} attempt to image the electrical resistivity structure of southeast Australia, to investigate the physical state of the crust and upper mantle. A 3 D forward model of southeast Australia comprised of regional sets of broadband and long-period magnetotelluric and <b>geomagnetic</b> depth <b>sounding</b> data, over an area of 440 x 300 km 2, was used to map broad-scale lithospheric properties. Model results show {{an order of magnitude}} decrease in resistivity from the depleted continental mantle lithosphere of the Delamerian Orogen in the west, to the more conducting oceanic mantle of the Lachlan Orogen in the east. The decrease in resistivity in conjunction with a 0. 1 km/s decrease in P-wave velocity at depths of 50 - 250 km, suggest a change in temperature (_T_ 200 _C) due to lithospheric thinning toward the east as the likely cause, in conjuction with a change in geochemistry and/or hydration. A high resolution two-dimensional inversion using data from 37 new and 39 existing broadband magnetotelluric stations mapped crustal heterogeneity beneath the Delamerian Orogen in much greater detail. Lateral changes in resistivity from 10 - 10 000 m occur over the space of a few kilometres. Low resistivity (_ 10 m) regions occur at depths of 10 - 40 km. Narrow paths of low resistivity extend to the surface, coinciding with locations of crustal faults from seismic interpretations. Movement of mantle up these faults, during periods of extension prior to the Delamerian Orogen, may have produced a carbon-rich, low resistivity lower crust, leaving a resistive upper mantle, depleted of volatiles.

We estimated the resistivity model at the depth from the surface to 10 km, which explains the observed apparent resistivities and phases. The most remarkable feature of the resistivity model is that the subsurface extension of the MTL has a north dip down to 5 km depth. This dipping interface also corresponds to a reflection seismic result. The north dipping MTL cannot be created by just a present strike slip motion.

In the {{frequency}} domain, {{the relationship between}} the vertical component and the orthogonal horizontal components of the magnetic field reflect the conductivity of the medium. In the EM community, the MVS technique is also known as the <b>geomagnetic</b> deep <b>sounding</b> (GDS) method. The data generated from this method are the magnetic transfer functions, presented as magnetic induction vectors or induction arrows (Lilley and Arora 1982; Hobbs 1992). Important studies using this method are mainly at the crustal scale, due to the deep investigation depths and lateral integrating effect of the magnetometer array recordings at long periods or low frequencies (e.g., Heinson and Lilley 1993; Armadillo et al. 2001; Gurk and Schnegg 2001).

40|$|Abstract Electrical {{conductivity}} {{structures of}} the Earth’s mantle estimated from the magnetotelluric and <b>geomagnetic</b> deep <b>sounding</b> methods generally show increase of conductivity from 10 - 4 – 10 - 2 to 100 S/m with increasing depth {{to the top of}} the lower mantle. Although conductivity does not vary significantly in the lower mantle, the possible existence of a highly conductive layer has been proposed at the base of the lower mantle from geophysical modeling. The electrical properties of mantle rocks are controlled by thermodynamic parameters such as pressure, temperature and chemistry of the main constituent minerals. Laboratory electrical conductivity measurements of mantle minerals have been conducted under high pressure and high temperature conditions using solid medium high-pressure apparatus. To distinguish several charge transport mechanisms in mantle minerals, it is necessary to measure the electrical conductivity in a wider tem-perature range. Although the correspondence of data has not been yet established between each laboratory, an outline tendency of electrical conductivity of the mantle minerals is almost the same. Most of mineral phases forming the Earth’s mantle exhibit semicon-ductive behavior. Dominant conduction mechanism is small polaron conduction (electro...|$|R

The Kootenay Arc is basically a W-facing monocline of crustal dimensions, across which the change in structural level involves an ggregate stratigraphic thickness of up to 20 km. It marks the western edge of the continental craton over which the displaced supracrustal rocks have been draped. Balanced structure sections of the thrust and fold belt, which take into consideration the deep crustal structure, as constrained by the geophysical data, show that: (i) in early Campanian time the continental crust that now lies beneath the western Rocky Moun-tains and the Purcell anticlinorium was covered with the platformal Palaeozoic to Upper Jurassic rocks and the exogeoclinal Mesozoic rocks that now form the northeasterly verging imbricate thrust slices of the eastern Rocky Mountains; (ii) the Cordillera...|$|R
30|$|In {{addition}} to the shear stress along the western extension of the MTL, the island of Kyushu {{is considered to be}} influenced by tectonics stress associated with back-arc spreading (e.g., Seno 1999) (Fig.  1). <b>Geomagnetic</b> depth <b>sounding</b> research supports a region of increased electrical conductivity in the mantle below the back-arc side of Kyushu (Handa et al. 1992; Shimoizumi et al. 1997). Furthermore, the series of Kumamoto earthquakes, including those that were triggered by the initial series, occurred in a graben structure (Matsumoto 1979; Kamata 1989; Handa 2005) and around the active volcanoes. Such complex tectonic settings suggest complex subsurface structures that {{may be related to the}} characteristic seismicity. Because electrical resistivity is sensitive to the presence of fluids, and subsequently the elasticity of the media, it is important to investigate how resistivity structures relate to earthquake generation (Ogawa et al. 2001; Fujinawa et al. 2002; Goto et al. 2005; Guerer and Bayrak 2007; Wannamaker et al. 2009; Yoshimura et al. 2009; Ichihara et al. 2011, 2014, 2016; Ogawa et al. 2014; Kaya et al. 2013). To investigate the relationship between earthquakes and electrical resistivity structure, we gathered and analyzed the broadband (typically 0.003 – 10, 000  s) magnetotelluric (MT) and telluric data, which resolve the resistivity structure from the surface to the depth of the upper mantle.|$|R

This first large scale electromagnetic study in the Alps covers a cross-section from Germany to northern Italy and shows the importance of the alpine mountain chain as an interrupter of continuous conductors. Poor data quality due to the highly crystalline underground is overcome by Remote Reference and Robust Processing techniques. 3 d-forward-modelling reveals on the one hand interrupted dipping crustal conductors with maximum conductance of 4960 S {{and on the other hand}} a lithosphere thickening up to 208 km beneath the central western Alps. Graphite networks arising from Paleozoic sedimentary deposits are considered to be accountable for the occurrence of high conductivity and the distribution pattern of crustal conductors. The influence of huge sedimentary molasse basins on the electromagnetic data is suggested to be minor compared with the influence of crustal conductors. In conclusion, electromagnetic results can be attributed to the geological, tectonic and palaeogeographical background.

40|$|Abstract I review recent {{investigations}} on {{the electrical}} conductivity of the lithosphere and asthenosphere in Europe. The principal method in the reviewed studies is the mag-netotelluric method, {{but in many}} cases other electromagnetic methods (e. g., magnetovariational profilings and <b>geomagnetic</b> depth <b>soundings)</b> have provided additional information on sub-surface conductivity or have been the primary method. The review shows that the magnetotelluric method has been used, and is being used, in all kinds of environments and for many different processes shaping the crust and lithosphere. The crust is very heterogeneous, both with respect to the scale of conductive/resistive features and interpretations: research targets vary from Archaean palaeostructures to ongoing processes. The European database of the depth to the lithosphere-asthenosphere boundary (LAB) in Europe is updated, and a new map showing lateral variations of the depth of LAB is provided. The compilation shows that (1) the Phanerozoic European lithosphere, with considerable variations (45 – 150 km), is much thinner than the Precambrian European lithosphere, (2) the Trans-European Suture Zone is a major electrical border in Europe separating electrically (as well as geophysically and geo-logically in general) two quite different settings, (3) the thinnest lithosphere is found under the extensional Pannonian Basin (45 – 90 km), (4) in most of the East European Craton there are no indications of a high conductivity zone in upper mantle. In many regions there is no information at all on upper mantle conductivity, which calls for pan-European projects to operate arrays of simultaneously recording instruments with long recording periods (2 – 8 months) and dense spatial sampling (20 – 50 km) ...|$|R

The broad-scale electrical resistivity {{structure of the}} Australian continent is poorly known {{due to the lack}} of continent-wide observations. These observations are used to constrain lithospheric conduction and petrophysical conditions. In this study, models of electrical resistivity are developed using various constraints, and these are tested against known observations. Three approaches have been employed. Firstly, using the AWAGS array of 58 magnetotelluric sites across Australia spaced approximately 500 km apart, I analyse <b>geomagnetic</b> depth <b>sounding</b> induction vector data, which are then compared with the broad-scale tectonic components of Australia. Secondly, I have developed an upper crustal and surrounding ocean model of electrical conductance using ocean depth information (ETOPO 1) and depth to Proterozoic basement (SEEBASE) with a spatial resolution of approximately 17 km. Thirdly, estimates of seismic shear wave velocity of the lithosphere from 50 to 200 km depth from the AuSREM data, at a spatial resolution of approximately 50 km, were converted to electrical resistivity using an empirical relationship. The induction vectors were then compared with three dimensional modelling developed through two approaches. To good approximation I have been able to demonstrate, that the observed AWAGS induction vector data are explained to first order by the conduction of the oceans and sedimentary basins. Second-order effects of resistivity variations in the deeper lithosphere are significant, but induction vectors are less sensitive to these. Finally, I demonstrate from a 3 D inversion of the observed AWAGS data that there are additional crustal conductors that cannot be explained from sediment thickness alone, but require additional conduction mechanisms in the crust over significant depths.

Structure of the TAM rift flank has been partially investigated with different geophysical approaches. To the West, the Wilkes Subglacial Basin is present, a broad depression over 400 km wide at the George V Coast and 1200 km long. Geology, lithospheric structure and tectonics of the Basin are only partially known because the Basin is buried beneath the East Antarctic Ice Sheet and {{is located in a}} remote region which makes geophysical exploration logistically challenging. Different authors have proposed contrasting hypothesis regarding the origin of the WSB: it could represent a region of rifted continental crust or it may have a flexural origin or might represent an "extended terrane". Here we present inferences on the electrical conductivity structures at the transition between the TAM and the eastern margin of the WSB, based on <b>Geomagnetic</b> Depth <b>Soundings</b> (GDS) carried out during three different international Antarctic campaigns supported by the Italian Antarctic Projet: the BACKTAM, WIBEM and WISE expeditions. All the data have been processed in the frame of the ISEE project, aimed at evaluate the bias effect of the Polar Electrojet on geomagnetic transfer functions at different high geomagnetic latitudes and to study processing algorithms for magnetotelluric impedance tensor and magnetovariational transfer function estimate with high geomagnetic latitudes data. The qualitative analysis of the induction arrows, in the period range 20 - 170 s, reveals an approximately 2 D regional electrical conductivity pattern with a clear differentiation between the three Terrains crossed by the GDS transect: the Robertson Bay, the Bowers and the Wilson Terrain.

40|$|Electromagnetic (EM) {{studies of}} the Earth have {{advanced}} significantly {{over the past few}} years. This progress was driven, in particular, by new developments in the methods of 3 -D inversion of EM data. Due to the large scale of the 3 -D EM inverse problems, iterative gradient-type methods have mostly been employed. In these methods one has to calculate multiple times the gradient of the penalty function—a sum of misfit and regularization terms—with respect to the model parameters. However, even with modern computational capabilities the straightforward calculation of the misfit gradients based on numerical differentiation is extremely time consuming. Much more efficient and elegant way to calculate the gradient of the misfit is provided by the so-called ‘adjoint' approach. This is now widely used in many 3 -D numerical schemes for inverting EM data of different types and origin. It allows the calculation of the misfit gradient for the price of only a few additional forward calculations. In spite of its popularity we did not find in the literature any general description of the approach, which would allow researchers to apply this methodology in a straightforward manner to their scenario of interest. In the paper, we present formalism for the efficient calculation of the derivatives of EM frequency-domain responses and the derivatives of the misfit with respect to variations of 3 -D isotropic/anisotropic conductivity. The approach is rather general; it works with single-site responses, multisite responses and responses that include spatial derivatives of EM field. The formalism also allows for various types of parametrization of the 3 -D conductivity distribution. Using this methodology one can readily obtain appropriate formulae for the specific sounding methods. To illustrate the concept we provide such formulae for a number of EM techniques: <b>geomagnetic</b> depth <b>sounding</b> (GDS), conventional and generalized magnetotellurics, the magnetovariational method, horizontal gradient sounding (HGS) and a method that combines HGS with GDS.

I explore methods and results of forward-modeling global electromagnetic induction {{under a variety of}} assumptions about Earth conductivity and the spatial structure of the primary field. I begin by developing computational tools to perform time- and frequency-domain simulations of global induction in models with arbitrary conductivity and primary field structure using FlexPDE, a general-purpose software package that employs the finite-element method to solve partial differential equations. The method is shown to produce solutions with better than 1 % accuracy when the simulated fields and response functions are compared to analytic solutions for a variety of problems in electromagnetic induction, and to qualitatively reproduce fields and response functions measured by satellites and observatories. The technique is employed in combination with analytic methods to explore the effect on the response of Earth models to primary fields with asymmetric structure. Standard methods of producing response functions from scalar and vector magnetic data are compared, and scalar methods are found to generate responses with significantly greater spatial bias for models with non-zonal fields. I develop the mathematical formulation for including Earth-rotation in the forward models, and use it to calculate frequency-dependent estimates of the amount of non-zonal structure required to produce previously reported local-time bias in empirical satellite response functions. Because it is difficult to validate solutions to induction problems that lack analytic solutions, we participate in an ongoing project with other researchers who simulate the global induction problem with different methods.

40|$|The {{nonlinear}} inverse {{problem of}} electromagnetic induction to recover electrical conductivity is examined. As {{this is an}} ill-posed problem based on inaccurate data, {{there is a strong}} need to find the reliable features of the models of electrical conductivity. By using optimization theory for an all-at-once approach to inverting frequency-domain electromagnetic data, we attempt to make conclusions about Earth structure under assumptions of one-dimensional and two-dimensional structure. The forward modeling equations are constraints in an optimization problem solving for the fields and the conductivity simultaneously. The computational framework easily allows additional inequality constraints to be imposed. Under the one- dimensional assumption, we develop the optimization approach for use on the magnetotelluric inverse problem. After verifying its accuracy, we use our method to obtain bounds on Earth's average conductivity that all conductivity profiles must obey. There is no regularization required to solve the problem. With the emplacement of additional inequality constraints, we further narrow the bounds. We draw conclusions from a global <b>geomagnetic</b> depth <b>sounding</b> data set and compare with laboratory results, inferring temperature and water content through published Boltzmann-Arrhenius conductivity models. We take the lessons from the 1 -D inverse problem and apply them to the 2 -D inverse problem. The difficulty of the 2 -D inverse problem requires that we first examine our ability to solve the forward problem, where the conductivity structure is known and the fields are unknown. Our forward problem is designed such that we are able to directly transfer it into the optimization approach used for the inversion. With the successful 2 -D forward problem as the constraints, a one-dimensional 2 -D inverse problem is stepped into a fully 2 -D inverse problem for testing purposes. The computational machinery is incrementally modified to meet the challenge of the realistic two-dimensional magnetotelluric inverse problem.
