50|$|Courage (also called bravery or valour) is {{the choice}} and {{willingness}} to confront agony, pain, danger, uncertainty, or intimidation.

5|$|Although {{other firms}} {{expressed}} interest to Kates and Rogers Majestic {{in using the}} tubes, issues with acquiring patents prevented him, Rogers Majestic, or the University of Toronto from patenting the tubes anywhere outside Canada until 1955, and the patent application was not accepted in the United States until March 1957, six years after filing. By then, research and use of vacuum tubes was heavily waning <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>face</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> rise of the superior transistor, preventing any re-visitation of Bertie or similar machines.

5|$|As {{the highest}} award for valour of the United Kingdom, the Victoria Cross {{is always the}} first award to be {{presented}} at an investiture, even before knighthoods, as was shown at the investiture of Private Johnson Beharry, who received his medal before General Sir Mike Jackson received his knighthood. Owing to its status, the VC is always the first decoration worn {{in a row of}} medals and it is the first set of post-nominal letters used to indicate any decoration or order. Similar acts of extreme valour that do not take place <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>face</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> enemy are honoured with the George Cross, which has equal precedence but is awarded second because the GC is newer.|$|E

5|$|By {{launching}} such a spoiling {{attack against}} PAVN's long-established logistical system, the American and South Vietnamese high commands hoped to resolve several pressing issues.

It would also serve as proof positive that South Vietnamese forces could defend their nation <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>face</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> continuing withdrawal of U.S. ground combat forces from the theater. The operation would be, therefore, a test of that policy and ARVN's capability to operate effectively by itself.|$|E

5|$|Coburg {{took up a}} {{defensive}} position at Neerwinden and awaited the confident Dumouriez's attack. The Coalition army was outnumbered in infantry but possessed a two-to-one superiority in cavalry. After intense fighting, Coburg's troops repulsed the attacks of the French center and right wing. When Dumouriez found that his left wing was driven off the battlefield, he began retreating. The defeat led to mass desertions from the discouraged French volunteers. <b>In</b> <b>the</b> <b>face</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> military collapse, Dumouriez negotiated a free withdrawal of French troops {{in return for the}} surrender of Belgium and Dutch territory. Soon, Dumouriez was plotting against his own government and when his plans failed, he defected to the Austrians, leaving the French army in chaos.|$|E
