25|$|Crown gall disease {{caused by}} Agrobacterium tumefaciens can be {{controlled}} via {{a variety of different}} methods. The best means of control for this disease is by taking preventative measures, such as sterilizing pruning tools if these tools are used on infected trees and shrubs, performing mandatory inspections of nursery stock and rejecting infected plants as well as not planting susceptible plants in infected fields. Another useful practice is to avoid wounding the crowns/roots of the plants during cultivation, such as budding and not grafting plants, since wounds are the main means of bacterial entry. Control of root-chewing insects <b>is</b> <b>also</b> <b>helpful</b> <b>to</b> reduce levels of infection. It is recommended that infected plant material be burned rather than placed in a compost pile due to the bacteria's ability to live in the soil for many years.|$|E

2500|$|Many {{of those}} who have been labeled [...] "anti-Mormon" [...] object to the designation, arguing that the term implies that {{disagreement}} or criticism of Mormonism stems from some inherent [...] "anti-Mormon" [...] prejudice, rather than being part of a legitimate factual or religious debate. Eric Johnson, for example, makes a distinction between [...] "personal animosity and intellectual dialogue". Johnson insists that he is motivated by [...] "love and compassion for Mormons", and that while he [...] " [...] plead guilty to being against Mormonism", he finds the suggestion that he is anti-Mormon [...] "both offensive and inaccurate." [...] Stephen Cannon elaborates,It <b>is</b> <b>also</b> <b>helpful</b> <b>to</b> know that Mormons are a group of people united around a belief system. Therefore, to be [...] "anti-Mormon" [...] is to be against people. Christians who desire to communicate the Gospel of Jesus Christ to Mormons are never to come against people of any stripe. Yes, evangelical Christians do have strong disagreements with Mormonism, but the argument is with a belief system and not a people. The LDS people are no better or no worse than any other group of people. Any dispute is to be a disagreement with the [...] "ism", not the [...] "Mormon".|$|E

40|$|This paper {{investigates the}} {{behavior}} of a heavy soft spring in steady circular motion. Since the spring is inhomogeneous due to centrifugal force, one can rigorously prove that it follows the one-dimensional static Willis-form equations. The theoretical predictions agree very well with experimental results. It further demonstrates that these equations can give a clear understanding of the stress-stiffening and spin-softening effect. These findings reveal that the Willis-form equations can give very accurate linear approximations of finite deformation problems and <b>are</b> <b>also</b> <b>helpful</b> <b>to</b> clarify the classical concept of the principle of material frame indifference.

In a kind of infinite bichromatic superlattices satisfying some specific conditions, we obtain a finite portion of their in-gap states, which are superpositions of finite numbers of their unstable Bloch waves. By using these unstable in-gap states, we construct exactly several stable surface states near various interfaces in photonic superlattices. We analytically explore the parametric dependence of these exact surface states.
