50|$|The Watauga River {{rises from}} a spring {{near the base}} of Peak Mountain at Linville Gap in Avery County, North Carolina. The spring emanates from {{the western side of}} the Tennessee Valley Divide, which is, at this location, {{congruent}} with the <b>Eastern</b> <b>Continental</b> Divide. On {{the other side of the}} divides at Linville Gap are the headwaters of the Linville River in the Upper Catawba Watershed. Waters of the Linville River eventually reach the Atlantic Ocean, whereas waters of the Watauga River reach the Gulf of Mexico; hence the <b>Eastern</b> <b>Continental</b> Divide. The <b>river</b> then flows across Watauga County, North Carolina crossing the Tennessee state line (River Mile (RM) 55.1) at Johnson County, then into Carter County, Tennessee and ends at its confluence with the Holston River's South Fork (RM 0) on the Washington/Sullivan County border.|$|R
50|$|The Savannah River is a {{major river}} in the southeastern United States, forming most of {{the border between the}} states of South Carolina and Georgia. Two tributaries of the Savannah, the Tugaloo River and the Chattooga River, form the northernmost part of the border. The Savannah River {{drainage}} basin extends into the southeastern side of the Appalachian Mountains just inside North Carolina, bounded by the <b>Eastern</b> <b>Continental</b> Divide. The <b>river</b> is around 301 mi long. It is formed by the confluence of the Tugaloo River and the Seneca River. Today this confluence is submerged beneath Lake Hartwell. The Tallulah Gorge is located on the Tallulah River, a tributary of the Tugaloo River that forms the northwest branch of the Savannah River.|$|R

5000|$|Atlantans {{are often}} {{convinced}} that the ridge followed by Peachtree Street {{is part of the}} <b>Eastern</b> <b>Continental</b> Divide. While Peachtree Street is atop a ridge, railroad tracks were built on the actual <b>Eastern</b> <b>Continental</b> Divide, which follows DeKalb Avenue from Decatur to Five Points, then turns southwest toward the Atlanta airport, with the northwest side draining into the Chattahoochee or Flint Rivers and therefore into the Gulf of Mexico, and the southeast side eventually into the Atlantic Ocean. In 1959, Whitehall Street SW, which meets Peachtree Street NE at Five Points, was renamed [...] "Peachtree Street SW", and the <b>Eastern</b> <b>Continental</b> Divide follows this street, so {{a small portion of the}} story may be technically correct. Atlanta's primary water source is the Chattahoochee and much of the water is pumped over the watershed. To balance the river flows, treated sewage is pumped back to the Chattahoochee.|$|R
