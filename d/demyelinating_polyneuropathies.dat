5000|$|... "Polyneuropathy" [...] is {{a pattern}} of nerve damage that is quite {{different}} from mononeuropathy, often more serious and affecting more areas of the body. The term [...] "peripheral neuropathy" [...] sometimes is used loosely to refer to polyneuropathy. In cases of polyneuropathy, many nerve cells {{in various parts of the}} body are affected, without regard to the nerve through which they pass; not all nerve cells are affected in any particular case. In distal axonopathy, one common pattern is that the cell bodies of neurons remain intact, but the axons are affected in proportion to their length; the longest axons are the most affected. Diabetic neuropathy is the most common cause of this pattern. In <b>demyelinating</b> <b>polyneuropathies,</b> the myelin sheath around axons is damaged, which affects the ability of the axons to conduct electrical impulses. The third and least common pattern affects the cell bodies of neurons directly. This usually picks out either the motor neurons (known as motor neuron disease) or the sensory neurons (known as sensory neuronopathy or dorsal root ganglionopathy).|$|E

40|$|Introduction. Polyneuropathies or {{peripheral}} neuropathies {{present a}} dysfunction or disease of {{larger number of}} peripheral nerves or their dysfunction. Considering their morbidity - mortality characteristics they present an important aspect in daily clinical practice. One particular polyneuropathy that deserves special review is chronic inflammatory <b>demyelinating</b> <b>polyneuropathy,</b> which, due to its clinical - laboratory presentation, {{does not include the}} group of „simple” neuropathies, thus requiring further examinations. Neurophysiological testing should be performed using the protocol for neuropathy examinations. Neurophysiological examination, during the electroneurographic examination, shows neurographic parameters referring to polyneuropatic demyelinating type of lesion, while the electromyographic finding records the presence of neuropathic lesions (denervation activity, great action potentials with a reduced sample). Case report. A 54 -year-old patient was diagnosed to have a “complicated” <b>demyelinating</b> <b>polyneuropathy</b> according to the clinical-laboratory findings and electromyographic examination. Exclusion criteria, targeted diagnostic examinations, considering the mentioned peripheral neuropathies, pointed to acute inflammatory <b>demyelinating</b> <b>polyneuropathy.</b> However, the chronic inflammatory <b>demyelinating</b> <b>polyneuropathy</b> was finally differentiated during the clinical and electromyographic monitoring. Conclusion. The presented case is interesting because it shows how one can ”wander” towards the diagnosis, which is eventually {{made on the basis of}} electromyographic examination and monitoring as well as according to exclusion criteria, which have differentiated the acute inflammatory <b>demyelinating</b> <b>polyneuropathy</b> from the chronic one...|$|R
40|$|Not {{recognising}} {{the presence}} of decreased excitability may {{give rise to a}} seemingly low compound muscle action potential, which may lead erroneously to the conclusion of conduction block. To quantify decreased electrical excitability, stimulation-response curves and the current needed to achieve 90 % of the maximal compound muscle action potential amplitude, i 90, were obtained in 17 healthy controls, eight patients with Guillain-Barre syndrome, 14 with chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy, and 10 with hereditary motor sensory neuropathy type I. Decreased electrical excitability was found in patients with chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy and hereditary motor sensory neuropathy type I, by contrast with patients with Guillain-Barré syndrome.

40|$|The {{acquired}} <b>demyelinating</b> <b>polyneuropathies</b> include acute (AIDP, Guillain-BarrÉ syndrome, GBS) {{and chronic}} (CIDP, dysproteinemic) forms which differ primarily in their temporal profile. They are inflammatory-demyelinating {{diseases of the}} peripheral nervous system and likely have an immunologic pathogenesis. Although these neuropathies usually have a characteristic presentation, the electromyographer plays {{a central role in}} their recognition, since the demyelinating component of the neuropathy, which greatly reduces the differential diagnosis, is often first identified in the electromyography laboratory. In AIDP, the electromyographer, in addition to establishing the diagnosis, can sometimes predict the prognosis. Recognition of the chronic and dysproteinemic forms of acquired demyelinating polyneuropathy is important since they are treatable. The dysproteinemic forms also may be associated with occult systemic disorders that also may require treatment, independent of the neuropathy...|$|E

40|$|The {{pathogenesis}} {{of chronic}} fatigue syndrome (CFS) is unknown {{but one of the}} most characteristic features of the illness is fluctuation in symptoms which can be induced by physical and/or mental stress. Other conditions in which fluctuating fatigue occurs are caused by abnormal ion channels in the cell membrane. These include genetically determined channelopathies, e. g. hypokalemic periodic paralysis, episodic ataxia type 2 and acquired conditions such as neuromyotonia, myasthenic syndromes, multiple sclerosis and inflammatory <b>demyelinating</b> <b>polyneuropathies.</b> Our hypothesis is that abnormal ion channel function underlies the symptoms of CFS and this is supported also by the finding of abnormal cardiac-thallium(201) SPECT scans in CFS, similar to that found in syndrome X, another disorder of ion channels. CFS and syndrome X can have identical clinical symptoms. CFS may begin after exposure to specific toxins which are known to produce abnormal sodium ion channels. Finally, in CFS, increased resting energy expenditure (REE) occurs, a state influenced by transmembrane ion transport. The hypothesis that ion channels are abnormal in CFS may help to explain the fluctuating fatigue and other symptoms. (C) 2000 Harcourt Publishers Ltd...|$|E

40|$|BACKGROUND: <b>Demyelinating</b> <b>polyneuropathy</b> is a debilitating, poorly {{understood}} disease that can exist in acute (Guillain-Barré syndrome) or chronic forms. Interleukin- 10 (IL- 10), although traditionally considered an anti-inflammatory cytokine, {{has also been}} implicated in promoting abnormal angiogenesis {{in the eye and}} in the pathobiology of autoimmune diseases such as lupus and encephalomyelitis. PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: Overexpression of IL- 10 in a transgenic mouse model leads to macrophage-mediated <b>demyelinating</b> <b>polyneuropathy.</b> IL- 10 upregulates ICAM- 1 within neural tissues, promoting massive macrophage influx, inflammation-induced demyelination, and subsequent loss of neural tissue resulting in muscle weakness and paralysis. The primary insult is to perineural myelin followed by secondary axonal loss. Infiltrating macrophages within the peripheral nerves demonstrate a highly pro-inflammatory signature. Macrophages are central players in the pathophysiology, as in vivo depletion of macrophages using clodronate liposomes reverses the phenotype, including progressive nerve loss and paralysis. Macrophage-mediate demyelination is dependent on Fas-ligand (FasL) -mediated Schwann cell death. SIGNIFICANCE: These findings mimic the human disease chronic idiopathic <b>demyelinating</b> <b>polyneuropathy</b> (CIDP) and may also promote further understanding of the pathobiology of related conditions such as acute idiopathic <b>demyelinating</b> <b>polyneuropathy</b> (AIDP) or Guillain-Barré syndrome...|$|R
40|$|Chronic {{acquired}} neuropathies {{of unknown}} origin {{are classified as}} chronic inflammatory <b>demyelinating</b> <b>polyneuropathies</b> (CIDP) and chronic idiopathic axonal polyneuropathies (CIAP). The diagnosis can be very difficult, although it has important therapeutic implications since CIDP can be improved by immunomodulating treatment. The {{aim of this study}} was to examine the possible abnormalities of nodal and paranodal regions in these two types of neuropathies. Longitudinal sections of superficial peroneal nerves were obtained from biopsy material from 12 patients with CIDP and 10 patients with CIAP and studied by immunofluorescence and in some cases electron microscopy. Electron microscopy revealed multiple alterations in the nodal and paranodal regions which predominated in Schwann cells in CIDP and in axons in CIAP. In CIDP paranodin/Caspr immunofluorescence was more widespread than in control nerves, extending along the axon in internodes where it appeared intense. Nodal channels Nav and KCNQ 2 were less altered but were also detected in the internodes. In CIAP paranodes, paranodin labeling was irregular and/or decreased.

Case Report. A 58 -year-old man five years after heart transplant presented with progressive dyspnea, imbalance, dysphagia, and weakness. Nerve conduction studies and electromyogram were consistent with IDP. Plasmapheresis and high-dose steroids resulted in improvement in neurologic symptoms. Within two weeks, he was readmitted with anasarca and acute renal failure, requiring intravenous furosemide and inotropic support. Echocardiogram and right heart catheterization revealed reduced cardiac function and elevated filling pressures. DSA was positive against HLA DR 53, and endomyocardial biopsy revealed grade 1 R chronic inflammation, with strong capillary endothelial immunostaining for C 4 d. Plasmapheresis and intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) were initiated. His anasarca and renal failure subsequently resolved, echocardiogram showed improved function off inotropes, and anti-DR 53 MFI was reduced by 57 %. Conclusions.
