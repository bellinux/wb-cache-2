40|$|Groundnut {Arachis hypogaea L,) is an {{important}} oilseed crop cultivated in about 96 countries of the world. In the year 2000, it was cultivated on 23. 84 million hectares with 34. 52 million tonnes output of <b>groundnut</b> <b>in</b> <b>shell.</b> Arachis hypogaea {{is divided into two}} subspecies, fastigiata and hypogaea. The subspecies fastigiaia is subdivided into four botanical varieties, fastigiata, peruviana, aequatoriana, and vulgaris and subspecies hypogaea into two botanical varieties, hypogaea and hirsuta. The crop is grown under wide range of climatic conditions, from warm tropical to humid temperate, although all the production environments can be characterized by a warm, frost-free period of at least 90 days (Bunting etal. 1985). During this growing season, mean temperatures generally range from 24 to 33 °C (Saxena et al. 1983), with temperature optima for growth and dry matter production generally considered to lie within a similar range (Ketring et al. 1982; Ketring, 1984). The base temperature (Tb), the temperature at or below which the rate of progress towards a phenological event is zero, for groundnut is considered to be 10 °C. Bell et ah (1991) estimated mean Tb for 16 cultivars for germination to be 13. 3 °G In some countries in Asia and North America, the temperatures at planting time are low resulting in delayed and poor germination/plant stand <b>in</b> <b>groundnut</b> and consequently poor yield and economic loss to the farmers.

40|$|The {{suitability}} of groundnut shell as a constituent material in concrete was investigated by re-placing proportions by volume of fine aggregate (river sand) with groundnut shells. Physical properties of cement, groundnut shells and aggregates were determined. Concrete cubes measur-ing 150 x 150 x 150 mm were cast. Groundnut shells {{were used to}} replace fine aggregate at 0, 5, 15, 25, 50 and 75 % replacement levels. The effects of the groundnut shells on the workability of fresh concrete were determined by the slump and compacting factor value tests. Compressive strengths and density values of the concrete cubes were evaluated at 28 days at different percentage replacement levels obtaining a range of values of 34. 37, 40. 59, 21. 33, 17. 78, 12. 44, 7. 56 N/mm 2 and 2402. 96, 2533. 33, 2349. 62, 2215. 30, 2121. 48, and 1854. 81 Kg/m 3 respectively.

40|$|This study {{analyzes}} {{the performance of}} <b>groundnut</b> production <b>in</b> Bangladesh in the 1990 s and 2000 s, both at the district and national level. Production performance was {{measured in terms of}} growth and variability. Annual compound rate of growth was estimated to know the growth performance. Cuddy-Della Valle index was used to estimate variability. Analysis showed that both area and production of groundnut at the national level declined in the 1990 s but production increased afterwards. In the late 2000 s, groundnut production increased by 31 % although area under groundnut was same as in the late 1990 s. Increase <b>in</b> <b>groundnut</b> yield (by 373 kg/ha or 32 %) contributed towards increase <b>in</b> <b>groundnut</b> production <b>in</b> the late 2000 s. In the late 2000 s (TE 2009 / 10), top five groundnut producing districts (Noakhali, Dhaka, Faridpur, Kishoreganj and Pabna) accounted for 59 percent of area and 55 percent of production. In the 2000 s, Bangladesh achieved high annual growth (5. 0 % or more) <b>in</b> <b>groundnut</b> production at the national level and in nine districts (Faridpur, Tangail, Barisal, Jessore, Kushtia, Dinajpur, Pabna, Rangpur and Chittagong H.

Increase <b>in</b> variability <b>in</b> <b>groundnut</b> production was mainly due to the increased variability <b>in</b> area under <b>groundnut</b> indicating that the crop was expanded to less suitable areas. The study concludes that groundnut breeders should focus more on yield increase rather than on reduction in variability in yield.

40|$|The {{rising cost}} of {{commercial}} non-ruminant feeds in Ghana has necessitated a search for local alternatives such as modified crop residues. The present study was carried out to investigate {{the extent to which}} maize stalk potash treatment might improve groundnut shell biodegradability and whether or not a low dietary intake of the treated groundnut shell would support the growth of rats. Groundnut Shell (GS) meal was immersed in 1 % (w/v) potash, pH 11. 2, for 24 h at room temperature (solid to liquid ratio of 1 : 4). The enzymatic degradation of the cellulose fraction of <b>groundnut</b> <b>shell</b> <b>in</b> vitro increased 18 fold following the potash treatment. Three dietary treatments were evaluated on five randomly selected rats over a period of four weeks: normal broiler mash diet, broiler mash partially substituted with either 10 % potash-treated GS or 10 % untreated GS. The mean values for daily feed intake (g rat - 1) were 14. 2 ± 1. 4, 15. 8 ± 1. 3 and 13. 2 ± 0. 8 while the specific growth rates were 2. 03 ± 0. 06, 2. 34 ± 0. 20 and 2. 31 ± 0. 15 for normal diet, untreated GS and potash-treated GS, respectively. Although the differences were not statistically significant, the growth performance of rats fed on the diet partially substituted with potash-treated GS appeared to be better than the other two groups. The feed conversion ratio of 4. 05 ± 0. 48 for this dietary treatment was the lowest. Taken together, the results suggest that a low dietary concentration of alkali-treated GS should support the growth of rats and other monogastrics without supplementation with costly feed additives...|$|R
