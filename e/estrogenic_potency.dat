25|$|Testosterone can be metabolized by {{aromatase}} into estradiol, {{and many}} other AAS can be metabolized into their corresponding estrogenic metabolites as well. As an example, the 17α-alkylated AAS methyltestosterone and metandienone are converted by aromatase into methylestradiol. 4,5α-Dihydrogenated derivatives of testosterone such as DHT cannot be aromatized, whereas 19-nortestosterone derivatives like nandrolone can be but to a greatly reduced extent. Some 19-nortestosterone derivatives, such as dimethandrolone and 11β-MNT, cannot be aromatized due to steric hindrance provided by their 11β-methyl group, whereas the closely related AAS trestolone (7α-methyl-19-nortestosterone), in relation to its lack of an 11β-methyl group, can be aromatized. AAS that are 17α-alkylated (and not also 4,5α-reduced or 19-demethylated) are also aromatized but {{to a lesser extent}} than is testosterone. However, it is notable that estrogens that are 17α-substituted (e.g., ethinylestradiol and methylestradiol) are of markedly increased <b>estrogenic</b> <b>potency</b> due to improved metabolic stability, and for this reason, 17α-alkylated AAS can actually have high estrogenicity and comparatively greater estrogenic effects than testosterone.|$|E

40|$|To further {{develop an}} {{integrated}} {{in vitro testing}} strategy for replacement of in vivo tests for (anti-) estrogenicity testing, the ligand-modulated interaction of coregulators with estrogen receptor a was assessed using a PamChip® plate. The relative <b>estrogenic</b> <b>potencies</b> determined, based on ERa binding to coregulator peptides {{in the presence of}} ligands on the PamChip® plate, were compared to the relative <b>estrogenic</b> <b>potencies</b> as determined in the in vivo uterotrophic assay.

Moreover, this coregulator binding assay is able to distinguish ER agonists from ER antagonists: profiles of selective estrogen receptor modulators, such as tamoxifen, were distinct from those of pure ER agonists, such as dienestrol. Combination of this coregulator binding assay with other types of in vitro assays, e. g., reporter gene assays and the H 295 R steroidogenesis assay, will frame an in vitro test panel for screening and prioritization of chemicals, thereby contributing to the reduction and ultimately the replacement of animal testing for (anti-) estrogenic effects...|$|R

BDDA and other doisynolic acid derivatives display relatively low affinity accompanied by disproportionately high <b>estrogenic</b> <b>potency</b> in vivo, which was eventually determined to be due to transformation into metabolites with greater estrogenic activity. The drug was discovered in 1947 as a degradation product of the reaction of equilenin or dihydroequilenin with potassium hydroxide.

The approach consisted of a reversed-phase high-performance liquid chromatography fractionation of gastrointestinal content extract, directed by ER-CALUX and followed by gas chromatography analysis.

The three assays applied were an estrogen receptor (ER) -binding assay and two reporter gene effect assays: a yeast estrogen screen (YES) and the ER-mediated chemically activated luciferase gene expression (ER-CALUX) assay. All assays were able to detect estrogenicity, but the amounts of material needed for the assays differed greatly between the three assays (ER-binding assay ≫ YES > ER-CALUX). In addition, in the ER-binding assay, both agonists and antagonists give an estrogenic response, resulting in higher estradiol equivalency (EEQ) levels than both the ER-CALUX and the YES assay for the same samples. The EEQs found in wastewater treatment plants (WTPs) with the ER-CALUX assay were {{in the range of}} 4 to 440 and 0. 11 to 59 pmol/L for influent and effluent, respectively.

However, elevation of organochlorine compounds such as dichlorodipehenyldichloroethylene (DDE) and polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) in breast cancer patients is not consistently observed. Reanalysis of the data showing that male sperm counts decreased by over 40 % during 1940 to 1990 indicated that inadequate statistical methods were used and that the data did not support a significant decline in sperm count. Humans are exposed to both natural and industrial chemicals which exhibit estrogenic and antiestrogenic activities. For example, bioflavonoids, which are widely distributed in foods, and several industrial compounds, including organochlorine pesticides and various phenolic chemicals, exhibit estrogenic activity. Humans are also exposed to chemicals which inhibit estrogen-induced responses such as the aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR) agonist 2, 3, 7, 8 -tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin and related chlorinated aromatics, polynuclear aromatic hydrocarbon combustion products, and indole- 3 -carbinol, which is found in cruciferous vegetables.

40|$|In {{a year-round}} {{monitoring}} program (1998), pesticide composition and toxic potency {{of the mix}} of pollutants present in rainwater were measured. The goal {{of the study was}} to relate atmospheric deposition of toxic potency and pesticide composition to each other and to sampling period and local agricultural activity. Rainwater was collected in 26 consecutive periods of 14 days in a background location (BACK) and in two locations representative for different agricultural practices, i. e. intensive greenhouse horticulture (HORT) and flower bulb culture (BULB). Samples were chemically analyzed for carbamate (CARB), organophosphate (OP) and organochlorine (OC) pesticides and metabolites. Esterase inhibiting potency of rainwater extracts was measured in a specially developed bio-assay with honeybee esterases and was expressed as an equivalent concentration of the model inhibitor dichlorvos. <b>Estrogenic</b> <b>potency</b> of the extracts was measured in the ER-CALUX reporter gene assay and was expressed as an equivalent concentration of estradiol. Multivariate principal component analysis (PCA) techniques proved to be valuable tools to analyze the numerous pesticide concentrations in relation to toxic potency, sampling location, and sampling season. Pesticide composition in rainwater depended much more on sampling season than on sampling location, but differences between SPRING and SUMMER were mainly attributed to local differences in agricultural practice. On average, the esterase inhibiting potency exceeded the maximum permissible concentration set for dichlorvos in The Netherlands, and was significantly higher in HORT than in BACK and BULB. Esterase inhibition correlated significantly with OP and GARB concentrations, as expected given the working mechanism of these insecticides. The <b>estrogenic</b> <b>potency</b> incidentally exceeded NOEC levels reported for aquatic organisms and was highest in SPRING. Although <b>estrogenic</b> <b>potency</b> of rainwater correlated with OC concentrations, the ER-CALUX responses could not be attributed to any particular pesticides. Besides, the contribution of non-analyzed xeno-estrogens as alkylphenol(-ethoxylates) and bisphenol-A to the <b>estrogenic</b> <b>potency</b> of rainwater could not be excluded. Further research should focus on the chemical identification of estrogenic compounds in rainwater. In addition, more attention should be given to the ecological consequences of atmospheric deposition of individual pesticides and of total toxic potencies that regularly exceed environmental criteria for Dutch surface waters and/or toxic threshold values for aquatic organisms.

E 2 /dye or E 2 /waste water ER competitive binding assays show activity of Blue HFRL, benzopurpurine 4 B, Everzol Navy Blue FBN, direct red 89 BNL 200 % and waste water samples indicating a mechanism of action common to E 2. Our results indicate that several textile dyes are potential endocrine disrupting agents.

40|$|BACKGROUND: Environmental estrogens in {{wastewater}} treatment work (WwTW) effluents are well established {{as the principal}} cause of reproductive disruption in wild fish populations, but their possible role in the wider health effects of effluents has not been established. OBJECTIVES: We assessed the contribution of estrogens to adverse health effects induced in a model fish species by exposure to WwTW effluents and compared effects of an estrogen alone {{and as part of}} a complex mixture (i. e., spiked into effluent). METHODS: Growth, genotoxic, immunotoxic, metabolic, and endocrine (feminized) responses were compared in fathead minnows (Pimephales promelas) exposed for 21 days to a potent estrogenic effluent, a weakly estrogenic effluent before and after spiking with a steroidal estrogen [17 α-ethinylestradiol (EE 2) ], and to EE 2 alone. RESULTS: In addition to endocrine disruption, effluent exposure induced genotoxic damage, modulated immune function, and altered metabolism; many of these effects were elicited in a sex-specific manner and were proportional to the <b>estrogenic</b> <b>potencies</b> of the effluents. A key finding was that some of the responses to EE 2 were modified when it was present in a complex mixture (i. e., spiked into effluent), suggesting that mixture effects may not be easily modeled for effluent discharges or when the chemicals impact on a diverse array of biological axes. CONCLUSION: These data reveal a clear link between estrogens present in effluents and diverse, adverse, and sex-related health impacts. Our findings also highlight the need for an improved understanding of interactive effects of chemical toxicants on biological systems for understanding health effects of environmental mixtures...|$|R
40|$|AbstractA {{range of}} {{toxicity}} bioassays {{which account for}} the biological effects of the pollutants has been developed to assess the potential toxicity risk of chemical mixtures against living cells. The current study aimed to determine the cytotoxic and estrogenic effects of treated wastewater effluents discharging into a main River in Tunisia. Modified E-screen assay {{was used to evaluate}} the estrogenic activity of water samples on MCF- 7 breast cancer cells while MTT assay was performed to assess cytotoxicity on human intestinal Caco- 2 cells. According to preliminary chemical analysis, high organic pollution was detected for some samples of treated wastewater since high levels of chemical oxygen demand exceeded the Tunisian guidelines. On one hand, significant cytotoxicity on Caco- 2 human intestinal epithelial cells was registered in a dose dependant manner for 0. 1 %, 1 %, 5 % and 10 % of water samples concentrations. In fact, MTT results showed significant cell viability decrease reaching 46 % for the highest sample concentration. On the other hand, Modified E-screen assay revealed the presence of estrogenic compounds in the effluent samples. <b>Estrogenic</b> <b>potencies</b> induced a significant proliferation level of MCF- 7 cells in a dose dependent manner. Thus, water samples may contain diversity of organic contaminants considered as potentially hazardous complex mixtures and representing a potential environmental risk for surface water. The implemented assays pointed out the insufficiency of the applied treatment technology to completely eliminate toxic micropollutants from treated effluent which may threaten aquatic life and human health as well...|$|R
40|$|Sediments {{may be the}} {{ultimate}} sink for persistent (xeno-) estrogenic compounds released into the aquatic environment. Sediment-associated <b>estrogenic</b> <b>potency</b> was measured with an estrogen receptor-mediated luciferase reporter gene (ER-CALUX) assay and compared with a recombinant yeast screen. The ER-CALUX assay was more sensitive to 17 beta-estradiol (E 2) than the recombinant yeast screen, with an EC 50 of 6 pM E 2 compared to 100 pM in the yeast screen. Yeast cells were unable to distinguish the anti-estrogens ICI 182 780 and (4 -hydroxy) tamoxifen, which were agonistic in the yeast. Acetone-soluble fractions of hexane/acetone extracts of sediments showed higher <b>estrogenic</b> <b>potency</b> than hexane-soluble extracts in the ER-CALUX assay. Sediments obtained from industrialized {{areas such as the}} Port of Rotterdam showed the highest <b>estrogenic</b> <b>potency</b> of the 12 marine sediments tested (up to 40 pmol estradiol equivalents per gram sediment). The estrogenic activity of individual chemicals that can be found in sediments including: alkylphenol ethoxylates and carboxylates; phthalates; and pesticides, was tested. Increasing sidechain length of various nonylphenol ethoxylates resulted in decreased estrogenic activity. Of the phthalates tested, butylbenzylphthalate was the most estrogenic, though with a potency approximately 100 000 times less than E 2. The organochlorine herbicides atrazine and simazine failed to induce reporter gene activity. As metabolic activation may be required to induce estrogenic activity, a metabolic transformation step was added to the ER-CALUX assay using incubation of compounds with liver microsomes obtained from PCB-treated rats. Results indicate that metabolites of E 2, NP and bisphenol A were less active than the parent compounds, while metabolites of methoxychlor were more estrogenic following microsomal incubations.

40|$|International audienceCXCL-test is {{a method}} that uses the estrogen-dependent {{secretion}} of the natural endogenous chemokine CXCL 12 to evaluate the estrogenic activity of molecules. CXCL 12 chemokine {{is involved in the}} estrogen dependent proliferation of breast cancer cells. Its measure is an indicator of cell proliferation and is used as an alternative test to classical proliferation test. Here we aimed to optimize this test, first {{to increase the number of}} tested molecules in a single assay and then to decrease the number of intermediate steps. The optimized CXCL-test was finally used for the evaluation of the <b>estrogenic</b> <b>potency</b> of emerging chemical pollutants: the UV filter benzophenones (BPs). The effect of BPs on CXCL 12 secretion was also validated by real time quantitative RT-PCR. The optimized CXCL-test allowed a fast and direct assessment of <b>estrogenic</b> <b>potency</b> of molecules. The estrogenic activities of benzophenones were characterized and divided in two groups. The first one contains weak estrogenic compounds (BP, BP 1, BP 2, BP 3, 234 BP and 2344 ′BP). The second one contains medium estrogenic compounds (4 BP, 44 ′BP, BP 8, THB) ...|$|E
40|$|International audienceThe brain {{cytochrome}} P 450 aromatase (Aro-B) in zebrafish {{is expressed}} in radial glial cells and is strongly stimulated by estrogens (E(subscript) 2 (/subscript)); thus, {{it can be used}} in vivo as a biomarker of xenoestrogen effects on the central nervous system. By quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction, we first confirmed that the expression of Aro-B gene is robustly stimulated in juvenile zebrafish exposed to several xenoestrogens. To investigate the impact of environmental estrogenic chemicals on distinct estrogen receptor (ER) activity, we developed a glial cell-based assay using Aro-B as the target gene. To this end, the ER-negative glial cell line U 251 -MG was transfected with the three zebrafish ER subtypes and the Aro-B promoter linked to a luciferase reporter gene. E(subscript) 2 (/subscript) treatment of U 251 -MG glial cells cotransfected with zebrafish ER-alpha and the Aro-B promoter-luciferase reporter resulted in a 60 - to 80 -fold stimulation of luciferase activity. The detection limit was < 0. 05 nM, and the EC(subscript) 50 (/subscript) (median effective concentration) was 1. 4 nM. Interestingly, in this glial cell context, maximal induction achieved with the Aro-B reporter was three times greater than that observed with a classical estrogen-response-element reporter gene (ERE-tk-Luc). Dose-response analyses with ethynylestradiol (EE(subscript) 2 (/subscript)), estrone (E(subscript) 1 (/subscript)), alpha-zeralenol, and genistein showed that <b>estrogenic</b> <b>potency</b> of these agents markedly differed depending on the ER subtype in the assay. Moreover, the combination of these agents showed an additive effect according to the concept of concentration addition. This confirmed that the combined additive effect of the xenoestrogens leads to an enhancement of the <b>estrogenic</b> <b>potency,</b> even when each single agent might be present at low effect concentrations. In conclusion, we demonstrate that our bioassay provides a fast, reliable, sensitive, and efficient test for evaluating <b>estrogenic</b> <b>potency</b> of endocrine disruptors on ER subtypes in a glial context.

40|$|BACKGROUND: Polyfluorinated iodine alkanes (PFIs) are {{important}} intermediates in {{the synthesis of}} organic fluoride products. Recently, PFIs have been detected in fluoropolymers as residual raw materials, {{as well as in}} the ambient environment. OBJECTIVES: High production volumes and potential environmental releases of PFIs might become a concern, but the exposure risk and toxicity of these chemicals are still unclear. In this study, we investigated the potential estrogenic effects of PFIs. METHODS: We studied the estrogenic effects of fluorinated iodine alkanes (FIAs), fluorinated telomer iodides (FTIs), and fluorinated diiodine alkanes (FDIAs) using the E-screen and MVLN assays and the evaluation of estrogen-responsive genes in MCF- 7 cells. RESULTS: FIAs have an iodine atom at one end of the perfluorinated carbon chain. 1 -Iodoperfluorohexane (PFHxI) and 1 -iodoperfluorooctane (PFOI) promoted the proliferation of MCF- 7 cells, induced luciferase activity in MVLN cells, and up-regulated the expression of TFF 1 and EGR 3. In these assays, other FIAs gave negative responses. FDIAs have an iodine atom at each end of the perfluorinated carbon chain, and all the FDIAs showed estrogenic effects. The <b>estrogenic</b> <b>potencies</b> of FIAs and FDIAs correlate well with the carbon chain length of the chemicals. The optimum chain length for estrogenic effects is six carbons, and then eight and four carbons. All FTIs have a single iodine atom at the end of a partially fluorinated carbon chain. None of the FTIs showed estrogenic effects in the tests. CONCLUSIONS: The estrogenic effects of PFIs are dependent on the structural features of iodine substitution and chain length. This research will be helpful in further understanding the estrogenic effects of perfluorinated compounds...|$|R
40|$|IBEP- 2, an {{established}} cell line recently derived from breast carcinoma, was characterized {{with regard to}} estrogen receptor (ER) expression, cell mitogenic response to estrogenic stimulation and sensitivity to antiestrogens. In addition, we examined ER modulation following binding of agonist and antagonists, and the ER-mediated induction of progesterone receptor (PgR). ER level in IBEP- 2 cells, determined by enzyme-linked immunoassay (EIA), was slightly higher than that measured in MCF- 7 cells (662 v. s. 595 fmol/mg protein). When tested on IBEP- 2 and MCF- 7, various agonists stimulated cell growth with EC 50 's reflecting different <b>estrogenic</b> <b>potencies</b> (E(2) approximately diethylstilbestrol > E(1) > genistein). IBEP- 2 appeared slightly more sensitive than MCF- 7, especially to E(2) (at least 4 -fold difference between EC 50 values). By contrast, IBEP- 2 and MCF- 7 were equally sensitive to the growth inhibitory effect of antiestrogens 4 -hydroxy-tamoxifen (OH-Tam) and ICI 182, 780. As revealed by immunoblotting and immunofluorescence using anti-ER alpha antibodies, ER expression in IBEP- 2 cells was modulated by E(2) and estrogen antagonists like {{it has been shown}} in other ER-positive cell lines, that is, E(2) and ICI 182, 780 caused ER downregulation, whereas OH-Tam induced ER accumulation. Ligand-induced downregulation of ER involved degradation in proteasomes, since it was suppressed by the proteasome inhibitor MG- 132. Exposure of IBEP- 2 cells to E(2) resulted in a marked (at least 25 -fold) induction of PgR, documented by EIA, immunoblotting and immunofluorescence. PgR induction due to E(2) was not modified by MG- 132. Interestingly, MG- 132 alone produced an ER-independent increase of PgR expression. IBEP- 2 might prove to be valuable to study ER-mediated induction of PgR. SCOPUS: ar. jinfo:eu-repo/semantics/publishe...|$|R
40|$|Identification {{of nuclear}} receptor–mediated {{endocrine}} activities {{is important in}} a variety of fields, ranging from pharmacological and clinical screening, to food and feed safety, toxicological monitoring, and risk assessment. Traditionally animal studies such as the Hershberger and Allen-Doisy tests are used for the assessment of androgenic and <b>estrogenic</b> <b>potencies,</b> respectively. To allow fast analysis of the activities of new chemicals, food additives, and pharmaceutical compounds, high-throughput screening strategies have been developed. Here, a panel of mainly steroidal compounds, screened in different in vitro assays, was compared with two human U 2 -OS cell line–based CALUX (Chemically Activated LUciferase eXpression) reporter gene assays for androgens (AR CALUX) and estrogens (ERa CALUX). Correlations found between the data of these two CALUX reporter gene assays and data obtained with other in vitro screening assays measuring receptor binding or reporter gene activation (CHO cell line–based) were good (correlation coeffi-cients (r 2) between 0. 54 and 0. 76; p < 0. 0001). Good correlations were also found between the in vitro and in vivo data (correlation coefficient r 2 = 0. 46 for the AR CALUX vs. Hershberger assay and r 2 = 0. 87 for the ERa CALUX vs. Allen-Doisy assay). The variations in the results obtained with the reporter gene assays (CALUX vs. CHO cell line based) were relatively small, showing the robustness of these types of assays. Using hierarchical clustering, bioactivity relationships between compounds but also relationships between various bioassays were determined. The in vitro assays were found to be good predictors of in vivo androgenic or estrogenic activity of a range of compounds, allowing prescreen and/or possible reduction of animal studies.
