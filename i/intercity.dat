5|$|Greyhound Lines offers <b>intercity</b> {{bus service}} to Alamogordo.|$|E
5|$|Passenger trains connect from Suvalki, Hrodno and Lithuania to Warsaw and {{the rest}} of the European {{passenger}} network. Passenger services are provided by two rail service providers, PKP <b>Intercity</b> that provides <b>intercity</b> passengers trains (express, <b>intercity,</b> eurocity, hotel and TLK) and Przewozy Regionalne that operates only regional passenger trains financed by the voivodeship. Passenger trains are mostly run using electrical multiple units (on electrified lines) or rail buses.|$|E
5|$|Public Oregon <b>Intercity</b> Transit (POINT) is an <b>intercity</b> {{bus system}} that {{includes}} service between Bend and Ontario, Oregon. It departs from Burns once daily in each direction. The buses are wheelchair accessible, can seat up to 20 passengers, {{and can be}} used for package delivery as well as public transport.|$|E
5|$|Daily <b>intercity</b> {{bus service}} to Everett Station is {{provided}} by Greyhound Lines and Northwestern Trailways.|$|E
5|$|Greyhound Lines {{provides}} <b>intercity</b> {{bus service}} between Mobile and many locations throughout the United States. Mobile {{is served by}} several taxi and limousine services.|$|E
5|$|Greyhound {{operates}} 123 routes serving over 2,700 destinations {{across the}} United States. Greyhound's scheduled services {{compete with the}} private automobile, low-cost airlines, Amtrak, and other <b>intercity</b> coach bus companies.|$|E
5|$|In 1985, Flying Scotsman {{appeared}} (alongside an <b>Intercity</b> 125 HST) in a witty British Rail TV advert.|$|E
5|$|Mass transit {{accounts}} for 9% of total U.S. work trips. Transport of goods by rail is extensive, though relatively low numbers of passengers (approximately 31 million annually) use <b>intercity</b> rail to travel, {{partly because of}} the low population density throughout much of the U.S. interior. However, ridership on Amtrak, the national <b>intercity</b> passenger rail system, grew by almost 37% between 2000 and 2010. Also, light rail development has increased in recent years. Bicycle usage for work commutes is minimal.|$|E
5|$|Pendolino {{traffic on}} the coastal track ended in December 2012. The two {{remaining}} services were replaced with <b>InterCity</b> trains, which run at similar speeds.|$|E
5|$|The {{fall of the}} Berlin Wall and German reunification {{made for}} a sudden spike of {{importance}} for the Stadtbahn. The first InterRegio train ran to Cologne in 1990. Since 1991, <b>Intercity</b> trains to Karlsruhe, Cologne and Hamburg used the Stadtbahn. The Hamburg line was soon extended to Dresden and Prague, and the former Interzonenzug trains from Munich were converted to <b>InterCity</b> trains and now ran on the Stadtbahn as well.|$|E
5|$|After World War II, and the {{building}} of the Interstate Highway System beginning in 1956, automobile ownership and travel became a preferred mode of travel in the United States. This, combined with the increasing affordability of air travel, spelled trouble for Greyhound and other <b>intercity</b> bus carriers.|$|E
5|$|Amfleet is a {{fleet of}} single-level <b>intercity</b> {{railroad}} passenger cars built by the Budd Company for American company Amtrak in the late 1970s and early 1980s. Budd based the Amfleet design on its earlier Metroliner electric multiple unit. An initial order for 57 cars in 1973 to supplement the Metroliners on the Northeast Corridor grew to two orders totaling 642 cars, sufficient to reequip all the services on the Northeast Corridor and many other routes around the United States. The first 492 cars, known as Amfleet I and completed between 1975–1977, were designed for short-distance service. A second order of 150 cars, known as Amfleet II and completed between 1980–1983, were designed for long-distance service. They were the last <b>intercity</b> passenger cars built by Budd.|$|E
5|$|Amtrak {{took over}} {{operation}} of most <b>intercity</b> rail passenger {{service in the}} United States on May 1, 1971; up until then such services were run by various private railroads. The private railroads chose to retain their most modern passenger locomotives to operate the various commuter services which, by law, did not pass to Amtrak. To operate these <b>intercity</b> services the company had to buy or lease from the private railroads whatever locomotives remained. This left Amtrak with an aging and mechanically-incompatible fleet of diesel locomotives. The mainstays of Amtrak's road diesel fleet were veteran EMD E8s and EMD E9s, which were all 10–20 years old and due for replacement.|$|E
5|$|As the 1930s progressed and {{the economy}} improved, the Greyhound Corporation began to prosper again. In 1934, <b>intercity</b> bus lines (of which Greyhound was the largest) carried {{approximately}} 400,000,000 passengers—nearly as many passengers as the Class I railroads. The film It Happened One Night (1934) centered on an heiress (Claudette Colbert) traveling by Greyhound bus with a reporter (Clark Gable). The movie is credited by the company for spurring bus travel nationwide. In 1935, national <b>intercity</b> bus ridership climbed 50% to 651,999,000 passengers, surpassing the volume of passengers carried by the Class I railroads for the first time. In 1935 Wickman was able to announce record profits of $8 million. In 1936, already the largest bus carrier in the United States, Greyhound began taking delivery of 306 new buses.|$|E
5|$|As well as <b>intercity</b> {{trains to}} London Euston, Birmingham New Street, Manchester Piccadilly, Glasgow Central and Edinburgh Waverley, {{the station is}} served by local trains to most parts of Lancashire, and parts of Cumbria, Greater Manchester, Merseyside and Yorkshire.|$|E
5|$|CrossCountry {{services}} {{pass through}} the station throughout the day, operating services between Cornwall and Scotland, but do not stop. Occasional Great Western Railway <b>intercity</b> services between London and Weston-super-Mare or Taunton and Exeter also pass through non-stop.|$|E
5|$|First Great Western {{declined}} a {{contractual option}} {{to continue the}} Greater Western passenger franchise (of which services at Nailsea and Backwell are a part) beyond 2013, citing a desire for a longer-term contract due to the impending upgrade to the Great Western Main Line. The franchise was put out to tender, but the process was halted and later scrapped due to {{the fallout from the}} collapse of the <b>InterCity</b> West Coast franchise competition. A two-year franchise extension until September 2015 was agreed in October 2013, and subsequently extended until March 2019. The coming years will see the introduction of new <b>Intercity</b> Express Trains, capacity enhancements and smart ticketing.|$|E
5|$|Greyhound Lines, the <b>intercity</b> bus operator, has a {{major hub}} in Denver, with routes to New York City, Portland, Reno, Las Vegas, and their headquarters, Dallas. Subsidiary Autobuses Americanos {{provides}} service to El Paso. Allied bus operators Black Hills Trailways, and Burlington Trailways provide service to Billings, Omaha, Indianapolis, and Alamosa.|$|E
5|$|In 1993, NSB test-ran an X2 {{train on}} the Randsfjord Line, and between 29 September and 21 December 1996, ran a unit in regular {{service on the}} Sørland Line. On 23 February 1995, NSB signed a {{contract}} to purchase 16 Class 71 trains for use on the Airport Express Train on the Gardermoen Line. The contract included two options, one for 16 trains for <b>intercity</b> traffic and one for 6 trains for regional traffic. The reason for using {{the same type of}} train as the Airport Express Train, was to reduce maintenance and operation costs through having a unified fleet. The options would only modify the trains slightly; they were primarily designed for the airport service and any optimization for <b>intercity</b> and tilting technology was secondary in the design process. The first option was taken out on 5 March 1997.|$|E
5|$|King's Cross was a London {{terminus}} for <b>InterCity</b> 125 {{high speed}} services, along with Paddington. By 1982, almost all long-distances trains leaving King's Cross were 125s. The service {{proved to be}} popular, and the station saw regular queues across the concourse to board departing trains.|$|E
5|$|Newport News has an {{elaborate}} transportation network, including interstate and state highways, bridges and a bridge-tunnel, {{freight and passenger}} railroad service, local transit bus and <b>intercity</b> bus service, and a commercial airport. There are miles of waterfront docks and port facilities.|$|E
5|$|Railroad {{stations}} have been located in downtown Pittsfield since the Western Railroad opened in 1841. The original station burned in 1854; after its replacement proved inadequate, a union station {{was constructed in}} 1866 to serve the Western plus the Housatonic Railroad and the Pittsfield and North Adams Railroad. A second, larger union station replaced it in 1914. The New Haven Railroad and New York Central Railroad moved to smaller depots in 1960 and 1965, and Union Station was demolished in 1968. Rail service to Pittsfield ended in 1971 but returned in 1975 {{and moved to a}} new shelter downtown in 1981. The Scelsi ITC opened in 2004 to combine local and <b>intercity</b> bus and <b>intercity</b> rail operations into one location.|$|E
5|$|Regular bus {{services}} {{operate in}} the city. Aside from buses, minibuses or vans are used as an alternative mode of public transport. There are two main bus terminals in the city centre. The terminal along Tun Razak Road provide bus services to {{different parts of the}} city and its outskirts, while the terminal near Bandaran Berjaya provides <b>intercity</b> services to destinations south of the city (Papar, Tenom, Beaufort etc.). A third bus terminal, the North Kota Kinabalu Bus Terminal in Inanam district, services <b>intercity</b> buses heading towards destinations north and north-east of the city (Tuaran, Kudat, Ranau, Sandakan, Tawau, Semporna etc.). Taxis are available throughout the city.|$|E
5|$|Subsequently a new {{contract}} until September 2015 was negotiated between First Great Western and the Department for Transport and subsequently extended until March 2019. The coming years will see the High Speed Trains replaced with new Class 800/801 <b>Intercity</b> Express Trains, capacity enhancements and smart ticketing.|$|E
5|$|The Swedish state railways, SJ also {{operate on}} the {{southern}} part of Gardermoen on their <b>intercity</b> services X 2000. This was for some years provided by Linx, a joint venture between SJ and NSB, using X2 stock, but the company was later dissolved.|$|E
5|$|The city is {{the home}} of Southern Oregon University (SOU) and the Oregon Shakespeare Festival (OSF). These are {{important}} to Ashland's economy, which also depends on restaurants, galleries, and retail stores that cater to tourists. Lithia Park along Ashland Creek, historic buildings, and a paved <b>intercity</b> bike trail provide additional visitor attractions.|$|E
5|$|Amtrak assumed {{control of}} almost all private sector <b>intercity</b> {{passenger}} rail service in the United States on May 1, 1971, with a mandate to reverse decades of decline. Amtrak retained approximately 184 of the 440 trains which had run the day before. To operate these trains, Amtrak inherited a fleet of 300 locomotives (electric and diesel) and 1190 passenger cars, most of which dated from the 1940s–1950s.|$|E

5|$|By {{the end of}} World War I in 1918, Wickman owned 18 {{buses and}} was making an annual profit of $40,000. In 1922, Wickman joined forces with Orville Caesar, {{the owner of the}} Superior White Bus Lines. Four years later, Wickman {{purchased}} two West Coast operations, the Pioneer Yelloway System (the operator of the nation's first transcontinental bus) and the Pickwick Lines, creating a national <b>intercity</b> bus company.|$|E
5|$|Cross Days was {{originally}} scheduled {{to come out}} on February 27, 2009, but its release was postponed six times: to April 24, June 26, November 20, December 18, January 29, 2010, and to March 19, 2010, when it finally came out. The much-anticipated game was released to several promotional campaigns, many of which were <b>intercity</b> screening venues that spanned operation from March 5 to 14.|$|E
5|$|Esbjerg Station is {{operated}} by Danish State Railways. The station is the western terminus of <b>InterCity</b> trains from Copenhagen (operating once an hour), with a journey time of about three hours. DSB also operates local trains to Fredericia. Arriva operates the Vestbanen with local trains travelling south to Ribe and Tønder and north to Struer.|$|E

5|$|Framingham {{currently}} sees 21 weekday MBTA round {{trips to}} Boston, with 8 to 9 round trips on weekends. On weekdays, Framingham {{is the only}} station west of Yawkey at which all trains stop. Most trains run to/from Worcester, but some terminate at Framingham instead. Average weekday inbound ridership is 1,299 passengers, making Framingham the second-busiest station on the line (after Worcester). Framingham also has Amtrak <b>intercity</b> service via the daily Lake Shore Limited, which runs to Chicago's Union Station via Albany–Rensselaer.|$|E
5|$|Greyhound Bus Lines offers limited <b>intercity</b> {{service from}} {{a stop on}} Water Street. Current service {{consists}} of two daily buses in each direction operating along the I-95 corridor, with transfers available to other routes in Boston, New Haven, and New York City.
