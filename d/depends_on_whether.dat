5|$|On U.S. Navy vessels, even-numbered {{compartments}} {{are found}} on the port side, but zero is reserved for compartments that intersect the centerline. That is, the numbers read 6-4-2-0-1-3-5 from port to starboard. In the game of roulette, the number 0 does not count as even or odd, giving the casino an advantage on such bets. Similarly, the parity of zero can affect payoffs in prop bets when the outcome <b>depends</b> <b>on</b> <b>whether</b> some randomized number is odd or even, {{and it turns out}} to be zero.|$|E
5|$|The {{applicability}} {{of state and}} municipal alcohol laws on federal lands is a complex and partially unresolved legal issue that <b>depends</b> <b>on</b> <b>whether</b> the federal property is considered a federal enclave, what rights the state reserved when it granted the property to the federal government, and whether the law is criminal or civil. If the federal property is not an enclave, the federal government either has concurrent jurisdiction (shared authority with the state) or proprietary jurisdiction (only the rights of a landowner), and the state can enforce alcohol laws.|$|E

5|$|Each of {{the three}} {{scenarios}} follows a branching plot line with multiple endings, and the story's divergence mainly <b>depends</b> <b>on</b> <b>whether</b> an idol passes or fails an audition, though {{this is not always}} the case. Some outcomes, such as failing to pass the first audition, can lead the game to end prematurely and offer an alternate ending to the plot. An audition marks the end of a chapter, after which the story will progress onto the next stage. In the game's stage mode, the player is able to freely customize a stand-alone performance, including options for the song, costume, accessories, choreography and camera positioning. Up to 16 players can participate via Wi-Fi in the stage mode by offering three types of cheers during one player's performance. If the game is played on a Nintendo DS with a camera, such as a Nintendo DSi or a later model, the camera may be used to scan QR codes found online or in magazines to obtain in-game items.|$|E
5|$|The Court of Appeal {{held that}} the scope of review of the {{discretion}} conferred by sections 8 and 10 of the ISA {{is limited to the}} traditional administrative law grounds of illegality, irrationality and procedural impropriety as established in the House of Lords decision Council of Civil Service Unions v. Minister for the Civil Service (1984), also known as the GCHQ case. The Court noted that the scope of judicial review <b>depends</b> <b>on</b> <b>whether</b> a jurisdictional or precedent fact is involved. Where no jurisdictional fact is involved, the scope of review is limited to the GCHQ grounds. Where a jurisdictional fact issue arises, the scope of review extends to deciding whether the precedent fact has been established. Whether a particular discretionary power is subject to any jurisdictional fact depends on the construction of the legislation which creates that power.|$|E
5|$|The {{determination}} of an individual's age by anthropologists <b>depends</b> <b>on</b> <b>whether</b> {{or not the}} individual was an adult or a child. The {{determination of}} the age of children, under the age of 21, is usually performed by examining the teeth. When teeth are not available, children can be aged based on which growth plates are sealed. The tibia plate seals around age 16 or 17 in girls and around 18 or 19 in boys. The clavicle is the last bone to complete growth and the plate is sealed around age 25. In addition, if a complete skeleton is available anthropologists can count the number of bones. While adults have 206 bones, the bones of a child have not yet fused resulting in a much higher number.|$|E
40|$|Purpose: This paper {{comparatively}} analyzes {{resistance spot}} weldability <b>depending</b> <b>on</b> <b>whether</b> or not 440 MPa-grade steel is galvanized at inverter DC spot welding. Design/methodology/approach: To compare the resistance spot weldability <b>depending</b> <b>on</b> <b>whether</b> {{or not the}} steel is galvanized, an inverter DC welding system was designed. Then, using this system, both tensile strength testing and macro-section testing were conducted on SPRC 440 (uncoated steel) and SGARC 440 (galvanized steel), and weldability was evaluated. Suitable welding conditions were calculated using the resistance spot welding variables such as electrode force, welding time and lobe diagram on the welding current. The low limit of the lobe diagram was set to the low limit of the tensile strength of 440 MPa-grade steel while the high limit was set <b>depending</b> <b>on</b> <b>whether</b> or not expulsion was detected. Findings: Compared to uncoated steel, galvanized steel had lower suitable welding current conditions anda narrower lobe diagram. Research limitations/implications: This paper compared resistance spot weldability and lobe diagram <b>depending</b> <b>on</b> <b>whether</b> or not 440 MPa-grade steel is galvanized. Practical implications: This paper confirms the weldability of galvanized steel by comparing resistance spot weldability <b>depending</b> <b>on</b> <b>whether</b> or not steel is galvanized. Originality/value: For analysis of resistance spot weldability <b>depending</b> <b>on</b> <b>whether</b> or not steel is galvanized, weldability was compared between SPRC 440 (uncoated steel) and SGARC 440 (galvanized steel) under the same welding conditions. As a result, compared to uncoated steel, galvanized steel had lower suitable welding current conditions and a narrower lobe diagram...|$|R

5|$|Western {{observers}} such as James Emerson Tennent (1858) and Charles Gabriel Seligman (1911) have {{termed the}} social group Coast Veddahs, Coast Verdas or East Coast Veddas. Anthropologists have considered {{them to be}} at least partly descended from the Veddas of the interior of the island who had migrated at some unknown period in the past to the east coast, intermarrying with the local Tamils. Interior Veddas clans themselves have a number of divisions, each claiming either Sinhalese, Tamil, mixed, or pure Vedda lineages. Vedda identity also <b>depends</b> <b>on</b> <b>whether</b> these clans are hunter-gatherers or settled agriculturalists. Settled Veddas have tended {{over a period of time}} to assume Sinhalese or Tamil identity based on the area of residence. If considered a subdivision of Veddas, then they are by far the largest sub-group amongst the Vedda people. Residents of Eastern Province consider those who maintain a primitive life style, or are partly dependent on hunting and gathering, as Vedar without any connotations of ethnic origins.|$|E
