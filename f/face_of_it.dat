5|$|In {{the early}} 1980s, Argentina {{approached}} the UK {{with a proposal}} to buy a number of Vulcans. An application, made in September 1981, requested the 'early availability' of a 'suitable aircraft'. With some reluctance, ministers approved the export of a single aircraft but emphasised that clearance had not been given {{for the sale of}} a larger number. A letter from the British Foreign and Commonwealth Office to the Ministry of Defence in January 1982 stated that little prospect was seen of this happening without ascertaining the Argentine interest and whether such interest was genuine: 'On the <b>face</b> <b>of</b> <b>it,</b> a strike aircraft would be entirely suitable for an attack on the Falklands.' Argentina invaded the Falkland Islands less than three months later.|$|E

In its present formulation, the theorem of Wiener does not have any obvious association with Tauberian theorems, which deal with infinite series; the translation from results formulated for integrals, or using the language of functional analysis and Banach algebras, is however a relatively routine process.|$|E
25|$|On the <b>face</b> <b>of</b> <b>it,</b> the NICC was a {{total failure}} as it did not achieve its aims of {{agreement}} {{between the two sides}} or of introducing 'rolling devolution' (gradual introduction of devolution as and when the parties involved saw fit to accept it). Nevertheless, coming as it did not long after the Conservative-sponsored Sunningdale Agreement, the NICC indicated that no British government would be prepared to re-introduce majority rule in Northern Ireland. During the debates William Craig accepted the possibility of power-sharing with the SDLP, a move that split the UUUC and precipitated the eventual collapse of Vanguard.|$|E

25|$|An Answer to Sir Thomas More's Dialogue, 1850. This {{contained}} {{two other}} works, The Supper of the Lord, after {{the true meaning}} of John VI. and 1 Cor. XI., and Wm. Tracy's Testament expounded. At the time of writing his introduction, Walter assumed the Supper of the Lord was by Tyndale, even though the evidence was on the <b>face</b> <b>of</b> <b>it</b> equivocal. While the work was in press, he changed his mind, and attributed it in Notes and Queries to George Joye, withdrawing from the position that Thomas More knew that Tyndale was the author. This second attribution is the one that scholars now support.|$|E
25|$|The {{start of}} the 1995 season saw Church play only {{occasionally}} for the first team, and he never made the impression required to become a regular in the side, with a first-class batting average languishing in the mid-teens and a top score of only 35 {{in a total of}} 14 innings in both forms of the game. 1996 was a better year on the <b>face</b> <b>of</b> <b>it,</b> with 280 first-class runs at 25.75, but more than half of those came from just one of his 11 innings, when he hit 152 (almost treble the next highest score of his career) against Oxford University in June. That game also saw Church take his first wicket, that of William Kendall, and go on to record what was to remain his best innings bowling return of 4-50.|$|E
25|$|On 1 October 1920, Colonel Ritter von Danner took {{command of}} the Munich city {{garrison}} (Stadtkommandantur München) and was soon promoted to Generalmajor. He led this command, which also entailed serving as deputy commander of Wehrkreis VII, until retiring on 31 July 1925 as a Generalleutnant. It was during this period that the Nazi Party, {{under the leadership of}} Adolf Hitler and its allies, attempted a coup d'état to overthrow the Bavarian government. General Ritter von Danner reacted quickly, placing troops on alert and acting to ensure that the commander of Wehrkreis VII, which controlled all troops in Bavaria, did not support the putsch attempt or vacillate in the <b>face</b> <b>of</b> <b>it.</b> Three days after the failure of the Beer Hall Putsch, Hitler {{was arrested and charged with}} treason.|$|E

25|$|The {{court did}} not show much {{willingness}} to investigate the marshal's case. Since the post was usually sold as mentioned above, Hitchen's utter discharge would clearly cause its devaluation, i.e., {{it would not be}} easy, if possible at all, to sell the office knowing in advance one could lose it before receiving the value for it. And though, on the <b>face</b> <b>of</b> <b>it,</b> the case was a deal between the holder and the purchaser, the city treasury benefited from the sale. Hence, the aldermen adopted a cautious and neglectful approach. However, due to the seriousness of the complaints and the letter sent to the retiring Lord Mayor Sir Gilbert Heathcote by Hitchen's accusers, reminding him of the 1706 statute and its severe penalties for receiving, a committee under the retiring mayor was appointed to examine the case.|$|E
25|$|There was {{no change}} {{after the first}} two matches as Gloucestershire beat Glamorgan in two days and Middlesex won the {{difficult}} encounter at Derby. It all went wrong for Gloucestershire at Dean Park, Bournemouth where stubborn Hampshire batting forced a draw while Middlesex were defeating Surrey with some ease. This gave Middlesex a twenty-point lead and only two matches each to be played. Middlesex's victory over the bottom team Northants settled it, especially as Gloucestershire surprisingly lost to Sussex by nine wickets. Even so, {{there was a slight}} sting in the tail as Middlesex then lost their final match to a determined Lancashire by 64 runs while Gloucestershire rallied to defeat Essex. The final table showed Middlesex winning by twenty points, on the <b>face</b> <b>of</b> <b>it</b> a handsome margin, but in reality it was a much closer contest than the figures would suggest.|$|E
25|$|This scheme, on the <b>face</b> <b>of</b> <b>it,</b> was {{a fairly}} {{standard}} colour light system, with each stop signal (which could show red or green) having an attendant repeater signal (showing red, yellow or green – the red used only for when the two stop signals on either side were also red). What made the scheme unusual was the provision of an automatic 'calling on' facility. The stop signals had an additional signal head ('marker light') that featured a red aspect plus a miniature yellow aspect. This marker light was mounted part way up the post. On repeater signals, the marker light was offset to the left-hand side of the post {{to indicate that the}} 'stop and proceed' rule applied. Junction stop signals were provided with two main signal heads, one mounted higher than the other. Splitting distant signals had three main heads, the centre one mounted higher than the other two.|$|E

25|$|There {{remains a}} lively {{debate on the}} left, over whether the Red Clydeside {{movement}} constituted a revolutionary opportunity for the working-class, though on the <b>face</b> <b>of</b> <b>it,</b> {{it would appear that}} the revolutionary potential of the Clydeside working-class has been exaggerated. Firstly, except Maclean, none of the labour leaders developed a class analysis of the war, nor did they seriously consider threatening the power and authority of the state. Furthermore, it was the behaviour of those conducting the war, not the war itself that provoked opposition within the labour movement. The Independent Labour Party's May Day Manifesto of 1918 makes this very clear in calling for A Living Wage for all and Justice for our Soldiers and their Dependants. Moreover, the massive demand for men to fight in the war meant that few Glaswegian families escaped personal loss of some kind. To undermine the war effort was to risk alienating the working-class, which many labour leaders were unwilling to do-–apart from Maxton, Gallacher and Maclean.|$|E
25|$|After {{moving to}} Moscow, Pisemsky joined The Russian Messenger {{as the head}} of the {{literary}} department. In 1866, on the recommendation of Interior minister Pyotr Valuyev, he became a local government councilor, the job providing him the financial independence he was craving for. Being now a well-paid author and a thrifty man, Pisemsky was able to build his fortune enough to enable him to leave work both at the magazine and the government office. In the late 1860s he bought a small piece of land on Borisoglebsky Lane in Moscow and built himself a house there. All seemed well, but only on the <b>face</b> <b>of</b> <b>it.</b> Troubled Seas (1863) and Russian Liars (1864) were his last critically acclaimed works. Then came the political drama The Warriors and Those Who Wait (1864) and the dramatic dilogy Old Birds (1864), and Birds of the Latest Gathering (1865), followed by the tragedy Men Above the Law, as well as two historical plays, full of melodramatic turns and naturalistic elements, Lieutenant Gladkov and Miloslavskys and Naryshkins (both 1867).|$|E
25|$|On the <b>face</b> <b>of</b> <b>it,</b> {{the distinctions}} between amateurs and {{professionals}} in first-class cricket were their availability and their means of remuneration. The professional cricketer received a wage from his county club or, if he went on a tour, a contracted fee paid by the tour organiser. In both cases, there was the possibility of bonuses being earned. The amateur in theory received expenses only, again paid either by his county club or a tour organiser. Professionals were full-time players during the cricket season and would mostly seek alternative employment in the winter months. The amateur was not always a full-time player during the season and many played by choice as they typically had other means of income or support. Some amateurs, those in education being a common example, were part-time players of necessity as they could only commit to cricket during the school or university holidays (say, late July to mid-September). Those in other forms of employment relied for availability on occasional holidays or, in some cases, being given time off by their employers. There were employers who hired well-known cricketers for commercial prestige reasons and so were keen to see them take part in big matches.|$|E
