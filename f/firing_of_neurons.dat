40|$|The {{purpose of}} this paper is to {{identify}} situations in neural network modeling where current-based synapses are applicable. The applicability of current-based synapse model for studying post-transient behavior of neural networks is discussed in terms of average synaptic current strength induced by per spike during one <b>firing</b> cycle <b>of</b> a <b>neuron</b> (or briefly per spike synaptic current strength). It was found that current-based synapse models are applicable in both situations where both the interspike intervals <b>of</b> the <b>neurons</b> and the distribution <b>of</b> <b>firing</b> times <b>of</b> the <b>neurons</b> are uniform, and where the <b>firing</b> <b>of</b> all <b>neurons</b> is synchronized.

25|$|Researchers {{have checked}} the BOLD signal against both signals from {{implanted}} electrodes (mostly in monkeys) and signals of field potentials (that is the electric or magnetic field from the brain's activity, measured outside the skull) from EEG and MEG. The local field potential, which includes both post-neuron-synaptic activity and internal neuron processing, better predicts the BOLD signal. So the BOLD contrast reflects mainly the inputs to a neuron and the neuron's integrative processing within its body, and less the output <b>firing</b> <b>of</b> <b>neurons.</b> In humans, electrodes can be implanted only {{in patients who}} need surgery as treatment, but evidence suggests a similar relationship {{at least for the}} auditory cortex and the primary visual cortex. Activation locations detected by BOLD fMRI in cortical areas (brain surface regions) are known to tally with CBF-based functional maps from PET scans. Some regions just a few millimeters in size, such as the lateral geniculate nucleus (LGN) of the thalamus, which relays visual inputs from the retina to the visual cortex, have been shown to generate the BOLD signal correctly when presented with visual input. Nearby regions such as the pulvinar nucleus were not stimulated for this task, indicating millimeter resolution for the spatial extent of the BOLD response, at least in thalamic nuclei. In the rat brain, single-whisker touch has been shown to elicit BOLD signals from the somatosensory cortex.|$|E
2500|$|KCNE3 {{interacts with}} Kv2.1 in vitro and forms {{complexes}} {{with it in}} rat heart and brain. KCNE3 slows Kv2.1 activation and deactivation. KCNE3 can also regulate channels of the Kv3 subfamily, which are best known for permitting ultrarapid <b>firing</b> <b>of</b> <b>neurons</b> because of the extremely fast gating (activation and deactivation). KCNE3 moderately slows Kv3.1 and Kv3.2 activation and deactivation, and moderately speeds their C-type inactivation. [...] It is possible that KCNE3 (and KCNE1 and 2) regulation of Kv3.1 and Kv3.2 helps to increase functional diversity within the Kv3 subfamily. KCNE3 also regulates Kv3.4, augments its current by increasing the unitary conductance and by left-shifting the voltage dependence such that the channel can open at more negative voltages. This may allow Kv3.4-KCNE3 channels to contribute to setting resting membrane potential.|$|E

5000|$|Locating {{consciousness}} in the brain's EM field, {{rather than the}} neurons, {{has the advantage of}} neatly accounting for how information located in millions <b>of</b> <b>neurons</b> scattered through the brain can be unified into a single conscious experience (sometimes called the binding or combination problem): the information is unified in the EM field [...] In this way EM field consciousness can be considered to be [...] "joined-up information". This theory accounts for several otherwise puzzling facts, such as the finding that attention and awareness tend to be correlated with the synchronous <b>firing</b> <b>of</b> multiple <b>neurons</b> rather than the <b>firing</b> <b>of</b> individual <b>neurons.</b> When neurons fire together, their EM fields generate stronger EM field disturbances; [...] so synchronous neuron firing will tend to have a larger impact on the brain's EM field (and thereby consciousness) than the <b>firing</b> <b>of</b> individual <b>neurons.</b> However their generation by synchronous firing is not the only important characteristic of conscious electromagnetic fields—in Pockett's original theory, spatial pattern is the defining feature of a conscious (as opposed to a non-conscious) field.|$|R

50|$|The {{starting}} point for McFadden and Pockett's theory {{is the fact that}} every time a neuron fires to generate an action potential, and a postsynaptic potential in the next neuron down the line, it also generates a disturbance in the surrounding electromagnetic field. McFadden has proposed that the brain's electromagnetic field creates a representation of the information in the neurons. Studies undertaken {{towards the end of the}} 20th century are argued to have shown that conscious experience correlates not with the number of neurons firing, but with the synchrony of that firing. McFadden views the brain's electromagnetic field as arising from the induced EM field of neurons. The synchronous <b>firing</b> <b>of</b> <b>neurons</b> is, in this theory, argued to amplify the influence of the brain's EM field fluctuations to a much greater extent than would be possible with the unsynchronized <b>firing</b> <b>of</b> <b>neurons.</b>|$|E

Among the benefits of fMRI includes dynamic, real-time mapping of cortical processes. However, fMRI cannot track the actual <b>firing</b> <b>of</b> <b>neurons,</b> which happen on a millisecond timescale, but it can track the haemodynamic response, which happens on a seconds timescale.

Auditory receptive fields are often modeled as spectro-temporal receptive fields (STRFs), which are the specific pattern in the auditory domain that causes modulation <b>of</b> the <b>firing</b> rate <b>of</b> a <b>neuron.</b> Linear STRFs are created by first calculating a spectrogram of the acoustic stimulus, which determines the how the spectral density of the acoustic stimulus changes over time, often using the Short-time Fourier transform (STFT).

Then, linear regression is used to predict the <b>firing</b> rate <b>of</b> that <b>neuron</b> as a weighted sum of the spectrogram.
