5|$|Sol and Naz {{spend the}} night {{together}} but at later dance rehearsals, Asher gives Naz her necklace back, and Sol sees this. He confronts Naz about it and she reveals she had a one-night stand with Asher but it meant nothing to her. Sol punches Asher, saying his brother has betrayed him, and a fight breaks out, but is broken up by Skolla and the other dancers. Skolla tells Sol and Asher they are both out {{of the group and}} reveals that Asher bought Sol's place. Sol goes back home to his mother but a neighbour tells him she has been taken away. Back in Walford, Naz insists she did not receive Sol's text message but he is still angry. Stevie attempts to get them to reconcile by locking them in the flat and pretending to swallow the key, but Naz reveals she is going to Turkey to meet Ekin's family and Sol says she can stay there. Sol and Naz get close again but Asher interrupts them when he returns drunk. Stevie drops the key revealing she did not swallow it and Sol thinks Naz was in on the plan so he tells her to enjoy Turkey before leaving. Asher finds Sol with their mother in hospital, and tells Sol he is better off with him than their mother as she is schizophrenic and has stabbed Asher. Sol says Asher is the problem and leaves. Asher finds him and apologises for Naz and says she did not get Sol's text message because he deleted it, and tells Sol that Naz loves him and he should do something about it. Sol returns to Walford again as Naz is leaving, and stops Ekin's car. Naz gets out and they kiss. Asher tells him he can dance at the dance-off, but when his name is called, he is unsure and calls for Asher, saying he needs him. Asher tells him <b>he</b> <b>can</b> <b>do</b> <b>it</b> on his own. Everyone cheers him after his routine and he is called one of the best dancers.|$|E

500|$|He {{began the}} 1981 season with five {{consecutive}} 100-yard games, including a 253-yard effort. [...] Woolfolk's best {{game as a}} Wolverine was the October 10, 1981 contest against Michigan State. The Wolverines beat the Spartans, 38-20, and Woolfolk rushed for 253 yards in 39 carries. After the game, Coach Bo Schembechler said: [...] "I wondered what a kid like that would do if he ran {{as much as the}} guy on the West Coast (Marcus Allen). I didn't plan on this, but he proved <b>he</b> <b>can</b> <b>do</b> <b>it.</b> Butch is going to be our all-time leading ground gainer. There isn't any way they're going to stop him now. And so be it." [...] His 1981 rushing performance against the Spartans still stands as the fifth best single-game performance by a Wolverine running back.|$|E

His brother Jon Hoke, an assistant coach in the NFL, noted: [...] "I don't care where it is, whether it's San Diego State or anywhere else, if there's one thing <b>he</b> <b>can</b> <b>do</b> <b>it's</b> recruit. <b>He's</b> as good at it as anybody.

Al-Qadim is a story in which we get to play the main character." [...] While decrying the limited choices of what the character can do and when <b>he</b> <b>can</b> <b>do</b> <b>it,</b> Schlunk added that [...] "the story is charming, graphically pleasing of reasonable length and worth 'playing'. In this game, elements of both role-playing and adventure games are blended cleverly {{with one of the most}} facile interfaces to date." [...] Schlunk concluded, [...] "Borrowing heavily from the Arabian Nights, Al-Qadim has captured the charm and wonder of those tales." ...|$|E
2500|$|In late 1969 Clapton {{made the}} switch to the Fender Stratocaster. [...] "I {{had a lot of}} {{influences}} when I took up the Strat. First there was Buddy Holly, and Buddy Guy. Hank Marvin was the first well known person over here in England who was using one, but that wasn't really my kind of music. Steve Winwood had so much credibility, and when he started playing one, I thought, oh, if <b>he</b> <b>can</b> <b>do</b> <b>it,</b> I can do it". The first—used during the recording of Eric Clapton—was [...] "Brownie", which in 1973 became the backup to the most famous of all Clapton's guitars, [...] "Blackie". In November 1970 Eric bought six Fender Stratocasters from the Sho-bud guitar shop in Nashville, Tennessee while on tour with the Dominos. He gave one each to George Harrison, Steve Winwood, and Pete Townshend.|$|E
2500|$|Business {{partner and}} friend David Young {{describes}} Jeff Laramore's {{work in the}} following way, [...] "With his ability to see and render he can do {{all of that and}} <b>he</b> <b>can</b> <b>do</b> <b>it</b> in layers of color in art or in shapes. [...] He can render things so brilliantly and he has that craft and patience and the intelligence to know the sequence to lay things down and to have them, once when they're done, they sing they breathe.” [...] Laramore has {{made a name for himself}} within the corporate sculpture world and many of his sculptures are seen as not only art, but also as landmarks and investments. [...] Jeff Laramore is currently working on an art filled central plaza that will be part of the , Marriott's forthcoming five-in-one hotel collection in downtown Indianapolis.

2500|$|Artemis {{is a child}} prodigy and {{is known}} to have the highest tested IQ in Europe. He is {{described}} as [...] "a plotter……a schemer" [...] with [...] "the ability to visualize a hypothetical situation and calculate the likely outcomes". His professors at Saint Bartleby's School for Young Gentlemen acknowledge that his intellect is beyond what they may offer in the fields of literature, history, science, and mathematics. The English teacher has given him a library pass during his class and the History teacher let him try to build a time machine during her class. She thinks that <b>he</b> <b>can</b> <b>do</b> <b>it.</b> He has published articles in psychology journals and delivered a lecture on Balkan politics, and has made several patents. Additionally, Artemis shows talent in music when he is able to compose an ending and add extra notes to many famous pieces of music by composers such as Bach and Beethoven. He speaks fluent Gnommish, some Spanish, and speaks Russian with an impeccable accent. He also speaks French, and is able to read lips. He is skilled in detecting and creating forgeries.|$|E
2500|$|Among the {{distinct}} {{elements of the}} Beach Boys' style were their voices' nasal quality {{and the use of}} falsetto in their harmonies over a run-on melody. Jim Miller observed, [...] "On straight rockers they [...] sang tight harmonies behind Love's lead [...] … on ballads, Brian played his falsetto off against lush, jazz-tinged voicings, often using (for rock) unorthodox harmonic structures." [...] Music theorist Daniel Harrison adds, [...] "But even the least distinguished of the Beach Boys' early uptempo rock 'n' roll songs show traces of structural complexity at some level; Brian was simply too curious and experimental to leave convention alone." [...] Lyric collaborator Van Dyke Parks argued that, [...] "Wilson made music as accessible as a cartoon and yet rewarded repeated listening as much as Bach: Just as the best comic books can turn cliché into high art, so can the best pop music. Brian does that. He can take common or hackneyed material and raise it from a low place to the highest, and <b>he</b> <b>can</b> <b>do</b> <b>it</b> with an economy of imagery that speaks to the casual observer—bam!

2500|$|Phil's {{behaviour}} {{earned him}} a number of sworn enemies in Albert Square and by 2001 the character {{had become one of}} the soap's nastiest villains. In an interview with The Guardian McFadden commented on his alter ego's descent into villainy [...] "Phil's been had over by a lot of people, so now he feels like <b>he</b> <b>can</b> <b>do</b> <b>it</b> back. It's his history". However the character finally received his comeuppance in one of EastEnders most highly anticipated storylines, dubbed [...] "Who Shot Phil?". Phil was gunned down outside his home in March 2001 in a [...] "Dallas-style" [...] whodunnit mystery. Various key characters were in the frame for the deed and viewers were left guessing for weeks as to which of them was the real culprit. Several outcomes were allegedly filmed and it was reported that only a few TV executives knew the identity of the would-be assassin – even the actors were kept in the dark. A spokesman commented [...] "The cast are only getting their own scripts. They are not being told anyone else's storylines. Not even Phil knows who shot him. It's top secret." [...] Script writers were reportedly given private security after a writer's laptop was stolen in what was believed to be an attempt to gain the identity of the assailant. The storyline captivated the public's imagination leading to thousands of bets being placed at the bookies across the UK – bookmaker William Hill said there was about 50,000 bets on who was responsible.|$|E

2500|$|In July, Feige {{discussed}} specific {{moments in}} the film, including an homage to The Amazing Spider-Man issue 33 where Parker is trapped underneath rubble, something Feige [...] "wanted {{to see in a}} movie for a long, long time". Daley said that they added the scene to the script because of how much Feige wanted it, and explained, [...] "We have [...] starting the scene with such self-doubt and helplessness, in a way that you really see the kid. You feel for him. He's screaming for help, because he doesn't think <b>he</b> <b>can</b> <b>do</b> <b>it,</b> and then ... he kind of realizes that that's been his biggest problem." [...] Feige compared the film's final scene, where Parker accidentally reveals that he is Spider-Man to his Aunt May, to the ending of Iron Man when Stark reveals that he is Iron Man to the world, saying, [...] "what does that mean for the next movie? I don't know, but it will force us to do something unique." [...] Goldstein added that it [...] "diminishes what is often the most trivial part of superhero worlds, which is finding your secret. It takes the emphasis off that [...] lets her become part of what's really his life". Feige also talked about the film's revelation that the Vulture is the father of Parker's love interest, saying, [...] "If that didn't work, the movie didn't work. We worked backwards and forwards from that moment. It was like two movies—it was the movie up until then and the movie after that moment. Because it had to surprise you, but it had to be true, also. You had to believe that we had set it up so that you would buy it [...] doesn't seem like something out of left field. That's a pretty great moment and we didn't know until we showed it to audiences" [...] that it would work. Watts said the revelation scene and the following interactions between the Vulture and Parker were, [...] "more than anything else, [...] I was looking forward to, and I got {{to have a lot of}} fun shooting that stuff." [...] Goldstein said the scene after the reveal, where Vulture realizes that Parker is Spider-Man while driving him to the school dance, was the moment he was most proud of in the film, and Daley said that scene's effect on audiences was the dramatic equivalent of an audience laughing at a joke they had written. He added that the writers were [...] "giddy when we first came up with , because it's taking the obvious tension of meeting the father of the girl that you have a crush on, and multiplying it by 1,000, when you also realize he's the guy you've been trying to stop the whole time." ...|$|E
