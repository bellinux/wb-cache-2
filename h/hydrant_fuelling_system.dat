40|$|Abstract This {{research}} {{is based on}} development of a small compact Low Pressure Dimethyl Ether (DME) <b>fuelling</b> <b>system</b> with the scope of one day being retrofitted to a diesel Light Duty Vehicle (LDV). The development of the Low Pressure DME <b>fuelling</b> <b>system</b> is discussed along with the engine injector haracteristics, the energy release, and the NOx emissions. The recorded data was compared to a previous DME <b>fuelling</b> <b>system</b> and conventional diesel results. The report discusses in detail the complete design phase of the Low Pressure DME system, with emphasis on the delivery pressure and portability of the system. The testing phase was run using a 1330 cc PH 2 Lister Petter diesel engine, with the Low Pressure DME <b>fuelling</b> <b>system</b> connected to the inlet of the original diesel injector fuel pumps. Three individual tests were run, ranging from 1100 rpm to 1800 rpm, at loads of 25 Nm, 35 Nm and 45 Nm. Engine performance and emission data were recorded for each case, with emphasis placed on the fuel injector line pressure. The results obtained indicated that the bulk modulus of the fuel {{played an important role}} when it came to fuel injector performance. Injector timing was also identified as having a significant effect. The energy released, while running on the Low Pressure DME <b>fuelling</b> <b>system,</b> clearly indicated that the maximum peak occurred well after top dead centre, this in turn influenced the cylinder pressure which ultimately reduced the usable power. From the NOx emissions it was seen that running the engine on DME, the concentration levels started off high for low engine speeds and rapidly tapered down as the speed increased. The Low Pressure DME <b>fuelling</b> <b>system</b> produced the lowest NOx concentration levels for high engine speeds and especially high engine loads. As a whole the Low Pressure DME <b>fuelling</b> <b>system</b> produced satisfactory results and showed definite potential for future development...|$|R

40|$|Decreasing of fuel {{consumption}} and high hydrocarbon emission in a SI two-stroke engine applied in motorcycles, scooters and small power units is possible by change of <b>fuelling</b> <b>system</b> on direct fuel injection. The main problem of mixture formation is short time for fuel evaporation after injection which should begin after {{closing of the}} exhaust port. However well interaction between the scavenge air and fuel jet from the injector located in the cylinder head can induce {{the small size of}} fuel droplets and fast evaporation. The paper presents the computational results of fuel mixture formation and combustion process in direct fuel injection two-stroke engine Robin EC- 12 with capacity 115 cm 3. The simulation was carried out by use KIVA code with assumption of initial parameters from the experiment of the carbureted engine.

40|$|Gas {{operated}} vehicles {{powered by}} natural gas (NG) or other gaseous fuels such {{liquefied petroleum gas}} (LPG), {{are seen as a}} possible option for curbing CO 2 emissions, fuel consumption and operating costs of goods and passenger transport. Initiatives have been adopted by various public organizations in Europe and abroad in order to introduce gas fueled vehicles in their fleets or use retrofit fueling systems in existing ones. In this study a retrofit dual fuel (diesel-gas) <b>fuelling</b> <b>system</b> was investigated as a potential candidate technology for city bus fleets. The system is marketed under the commercial name d-gid. It is a platform developed by the company Ecomotive Solutions for the control and management of a diesel engine fuelled with a mixture of gaseous fuels. In order to assess its environmental and cost effectiveness the system was tested on a Volvo city bus. The tests were performed on an HDV chassis dyno under various driving conditions. Fuels used were EN 590 diesel fuel and EN 589 LPG. Regulated pollutant emissions were measured including CO 2, CO. THC, CH 4, non methane hydrocarbons (NMHC), PM, NOx and Particle Number. Diesel fuel flow was also recorded. Vehicle simulation was performed using the PHEM simulation software to simulate more realistic operation. Results indicated small differences in exhaust emissions. Benefits were observed for PM and the emission levels of non methane hydrocarbons were increased. Minor reductions (up to 2 %) were observed for CO 2. Under low load conditions the gas <b>fuelling</b> <b>system</b> has only little contribution to engine fuelling. Under medium and high load operating condition the system manages to substitute part of the conventional diesel with LPG. Simulations indicated that a substitution of diesel fuel with LPG of around 21 % is achievable over realistic operation. JRC. F. 8 -Sustainable Transpor...|$|R

Several alternatives were approached but because the heating requirements varied significantly depending on the season and wood <b>fuelled</b> <b>systems</b> need to run at the specific design conditions to maintain optimal thermal efficiency, several alternatives were discarded. The wood <b>fuelled</b> cogeneration <b>system</b> was the design proposed because the electrical demands were more stable. The chosen design included one open storage area to store the chips, one hammer grinder to grind chips before feeding, a boiler, a turbine and generator, three conveyors, and a cooling tower. The total capital cost was found to be $ 29, 243, 900. For a 15 year period the total costs of the plant was projected as $ 341, 000, 000. For a 30 year period the total costs of the plant was projected as $ 620, 000, 000. The CO 2 emission for the propane heating was 5, 597, 265 kgCO 2 /yr. The CO 2 emission for wood fuelled heating was 346, 400 kgCO 2 /yr and for electricity was 569, 126 kg CO 2 /yr.

The definitive version is available at: [URL] hydrogen to the fuel in a direct injection natural gas engine offers the potential significantly to reduce local and global air pollutant emissions. This work reports on the effects of fuelling a heavy-duty engine with late-cycle direct injection of blended hydrogen– methane fuels and diesel pilot ignition over a range of engine operating conditions. The effect of hydrogen on the combustion event varies with operating condition, providing insight into the fundamental factors limiting the combustion process. Combustion stability is enhanced at all conditions studied; this leads directly to a significant reduction in emissions of combustion byproducts, including carbon monoxide, particulate matter, and unburned fuel. Carbon dioxide emissions are also significantly reduced by the lower carbon–energy ratio of the fuel. The results suggest that this technique can significantly reduce both local and global pollutant emissions associated with heavy-duty transport applications while requiring minimal changes to the <b>fuelling</b> <b>system...</b>|$|R
