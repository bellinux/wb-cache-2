5|$|Charlotte {{rejected}} this support: {{the party}} of independence sought to establish a constitutional monarchy headed by Charlotte, but she preferred to retain the power of an absolutist monarchy.

Castelli was <b>his</b> <b>lawyer.</b>|$|E
5|$|Gerber's defense {{cost him}} his life savings, {{some of which may}} have been in the form of bribes paid through <b>his</b> <b>lawyer.</b> The police never {{returned}} Gerber's personal papers, his typewriter or his remaining copies of Friendship and Freedom despite a court order compelling their return.

5|$|Kenyon's next rise {{came about}} {{as a result of}} his {{introduction}} to the Duke of Richmond, who was struggling with Sir James Lowther for the control of several Parliamentary constituencies. Kenyon went with Richmond to Carlisle and Cockermouth as <b>his</b> <b>lawyer,</b> and secured the constituencies for Richmond; as a result, Richmond chose to employ Kenyon as <b>his</b> <b>lawyer</b> from then onwards. In 1780 he successfully defended Lord George Gordon for high treason, assisted by Thomas Erskine, and the resulting fame was enough to propel him further up the ranks of his profession and within the political sphere. At the same time he became friends with Lord Thurlow, and when the holder of the Chief Justiceship of Chester died that year, Thurlow ensured that it was given to Kenyon. The rise of Kenyon's work in the Court of Chancery was also attributed to his friendship with Thurlow, who as Lord Chancellor was the head of the Court.|$|E

5|$|Directly {{prior to}} The Beatles' first American visit, Brian Epstein {{wanted someone to}} manage the {{escalating}} volume of merchandising requests that NEMS found itself unable to cope with, and asked <b>his</b> <b>lawyer,</b> David Jacobs, to oversee this task. Jacobs knew Nicky Byrne {{and asked him if}} he would be interested in taking over the merchandising subdivision from NEMS altogether, paying NEMS a commission. Byrne accepted the offer subject to a 90% rate, leaving only 10% for the Beatles and NEMS combined.

5|$|In Shreveport, meanwhile, {{whatever}} positive momentum {{the team}} had gained {{at the end of}} the 1994 season failed to carry over into 1995. Notable NFL quarterback Billy Joe Tolliver was signed and put up decent numbers; the rest of the team, however, was unable to muster much success and limped to a 5–13 record. As elsewhere, the team saw a second season attendance decline. With the season winding down, the city had clearly soured on the Gliebermans. They became embroiled in legal difficulties and, in one particularly absurd incident, Bernie Glieberman had <b>his</b> <b>lawyer</b> attempt (unsuccessfully) to abscond with a half-million dollar Tucker automobile that Glieberman had donated to a local museum.|$|E
