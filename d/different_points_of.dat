5|$|Citizen Kane eschews the {{traditional}} linear, chronological narrative, and tells Kane's story entirely in flashback using <b>different</b> <b>points</b> <b>of</b> view, {{many of them}} from Kane's aged and forgetful associates, the cinematic equivalent of the unreliable narrator in literature. Welles also dispenses {{with the idea of}} a single storyteller and uses multiple narrators to recount Kane's life. The use of multiple narrators was unheard of in Hollywood films. Each narrator recounts a different part of Kane's life, with each story partly overlapping. The film depicts Kane as an enigma, a complicated man who, in the end, leaves viewers with more questions than answers as to his character, such as the newsreel footage where he is attacked for being both a communist and a fascist.|$|E
5|$|The TRACERx {{project is}} looking at how NSCLC {{develops}} and evolves, and how these tumors become resistant to treatment. The project will look at tumor samples from 850 NSCLC patients at various stages including diagnosis, after first treatment, post-treatment, and relapse. By studying samples at <b>different</b> <b>points</b> <b>of</b> tumor development, the researchers hope to identify the changes that drive tumor growth and resistance to treatment. The results of this project will help scientists and doctors {{gain a better understanding}} of NSCLC and potentially lead to the development of new treatments for the disease.|$|E
5|$|On August 22 & 23, 1869, Carpenter {{and other}} troopers became {{involved}} in a fierce attack by Kiowa and Naconee Indians, who were focused on destroying the buildings and settlement on the Anadarko Reservation. Carpenter, with Troops H and L, patrolled the area aggressively and engaged several groups of warriors who were setting prairie fires upwind of the settlement at different points. Further and increasingly violent assaults {{were made by the}} Native Americans, in numbers ranging from 50 to 500 at <b>different</b> <b>points</b> <b>of</b> the defensive lines. The decisive feature of the engagement was a charge made by Captain Carpenter's troopers. His men routed a body of over 150 warriors, who were about to take up a commanding position in rear of other defenders. On June 5, 1872, the 10th left Fort Sill to elements of the 3rd Infantry and proceeded back to Fort Gibson.|$|E

5|$|Representative {{of the new}} {{historical}} perspective is the 2003 biography by Pauline Croft. Reviewer John Cramsie summarises her findings:Croft's overall assessment of James is appropriately mixed. She recognises his good intentions in matters like Anglo-Scottish union, his openness to <b>different</b> <b>points</b> <b>of</b> view, and his agenda of a peaceful foreign policy within his kingdoms' financial means. His actions moderated frictions between his diverse peoples. Yet he also created new ones, particularly by supporting colonisation that polarised the crown's interest groups in Ireland, obtaining insufficient political benefit with his open-handed patronage, an unfortunate {{lack of attention to}} the image of monarchy (particularly after the image-obsessed regime of Elizabeth), pursuing a pro-Spanish foreign policy that fired religious prejudice and opened the door for Arminians within the English church, and enforcing unpalatable religious changes on the Scottish Kirk. Many of these criticisms are framed within a longer view of James' reigns, including the legacy – now understood to be more troubled – which he left Charles I.|$|E
5|$|Sometimes Venus only grazes the Sun {{during a}} transit. In {{this case it}} is {{possible}} that in some areas of the Earth a full transit can be seen while in other regions there is only a partial transit (no second or third contact). The last transit of this type was on 6 December 1631, and the next such transit will occur on 13 December 2611. It is also possible that a transit of Venus can be seen {{in some parts of the}} world as a partial transit, while in others Venus misses the Sun. Such a transit last occurred on 19 November 541 BC, and the next transit of this type will occur on 14 December 2854. These effects occur due to parallax, since the size of the Earth affords <b>different</b> <b>points</b> <b>of</b> view with slightly different lines of sight to Venus and the Sun. It can be demonstrated by closing an eye and holding a finger in front of a smaller more distant object; when you open the other eye and close the first, the finger will no longer be in front of the object.|$|E

25|$|Although Jean-Jacques Rousseau is {{associated}} with very different political ideas, {{it is important to}} view Machiavelli's work from <b>different</b> <b>points</b> <b>of</b> view rather than just the traditional notion.

25|$|A {{wormhole}} is {{a concept}} that represents a solution of the Einstein field equations: a non-trivial structure linking separate points in spacetime. A wormhole can be visualized as a tunnel with two ends, each at separate points in spacetime (i.e. different locations or <b>different</b> <b>points</b> <b>of</b> time), or by a transcendental bijection of the spacetime continuum.|$|E

25|$|The first {{construction}} and this construction are very similar, but they represent rather <b>different</b> <b>points</b> <b>of</b> view. In the first construction, the manifold {{is seen as}} embedded in some Euclidean space. This is the extrinsic view. When a manifold is viewed in this way, {{it is easy to}} use intuition from Euclidean spaces to define additional structure. For example, in a Euclidean space it is always clear whether a vector at some point is tangential or normal to some surface through that point.|$|E
25|$|A bimodule (or correspondence) is a Hilbert space H with module {{actions of}} two {{commuting}} von Neumann algebras. Bimodules {{have a much}} richer structure than that of modules. Any bimodule over two factors always gives a subfactor since {{one of the factors}} is always contained in the commutant of the other. There is also a subtle relative tensor product operation due to Connes on bimodules. The theory of subfactors, initiated by Vaughan Jones, reconciles these two seemingly <b>different</b> <b>points</b> <b>of</b> view.|$|E
