5|$|Titanium nitride (TiN) has a {{hardness}} {{equivalent to}} sapphire and carborundum (9.0 on the Mohs Scale), {{and is often}} used to coat cutting tools, such as <b>drill</b> <b>bits.</b> It is also used as a gold-colored decorative finish and as a barrier metal in semiconductor fabrication. Titanium carbide, which is also very hard, is found in cutting tools and coatings.|$|E
5|$|Industrial use of {{diamonds}} {{has historically been}} associated with their hardness, which makes diamond the ideal material for cutting and grinding tools. As the hardest known naturally occurring material, diamond {{can be used to}} polish, cut, or wear away any material, including other diamonds. Common industrial applications of this property include diamond-tipped <b>drill</b> <b>bits</b> and saws, and the use of diamond powder as an abrasive. Less expensive industrial-grade diamonds, known as bort, with more flaws and poorer color than gems, are used for such purposes. Diamond is not suitable for machining ferrous alloys at high speeds, as carbon is soluble in iron at the high temperatures created by high-speed machining, leading to greatly increased wear on diamond tools compared to alternatives.|$|E

However, these shapes were known before his time, for instance by the designers of Gothic church windows, by Leonardo da Vinci, who used it for a map projection, and by Leonhard Euler {{in his study of}} constant-width shapes. Other applications of the Reuleaux triangle include giving the shape to guitar picks, pencils, and <b>drill</b> <b>bits</b> for drilling square holes, as well as in graphic design in the shapes of some signs and corporate logos.|$|E

5|$|Most {{industrial}} applications of synthetic diamond {{have long been}} associated with their hardness; this property makes diamond the ideal material for machine tools and cutting tools. As the hardest known naturally occurring material, diamond {{can be used to}} polish, cut, or wear away any material, including other diamonds. Common {{industrial applications}} of this ability include diamond-tipped <b>drill</b> <b>bits</b> and saws, and the use of diamond powder as an abrasive. These are by far the largest industrial applications of synthetic diamond. While natural diamond is also used for these purposes, synthetic HPHT diamond is more popular, mostly because of better reproducibility of its mechanical properties. Diamond is not suitable for machining ferrous alloys at high speeds, as carbon is soluble in iron at the high temperatures created by high-speed machining, leading to greatly increased wear on diamond tools compared to alternatives.|$|E
25|$|Long series <b>drill</b> <b>bits</b> are unusually long twist <b>drill</b> <b>bits.</b> However, {{they are}} not the best tool for {{routinely}} drilling deep holes, as they require frequent withdrawal to clear the flutes of swarf and to prevent breakage of the bit.

25|$|<b>Drill</b> <b>bits</b> {{are cutting}} tools used to remove {{material}} to create holes, almost always of circular cross-section. <b>Drill</b> <b>bits</b> come in many {{sizes and shapes}} and can create different kinds of holes in many different materials. In order to create holes <b>drill</b> <b>bits</b> are usually attached to a drill, which powers them {{to cut through the}} workpiece, typically by rotation.

25|$|Center <b>drill</b> <b>bits,</b> {{occasionally}} {{known as}} Slocombe <b>drill</b> <b>bits,</b> {{are used in}} metalworking to provide a starting hole for a larger-sized drill bit or to make a conical indentation {{in the end of}} a workpiece in which to mount a lathe center. In either use, the name seems appropriate, as the bit is either establishing the center of a hole or making a conical hole for a lathe center. However, the true purpose of a center drill bit is the latter task, while the former task is best done with a spotting drill bit (as explained in detail below). Nevertheless, because of the frequent lumping together of both the terminology and the tool use, suppliers may call center <b>drill</b> <b>bits</b> combined-drill-and-countersinks {{in order to make it}} unambiguously clear what product is being ordered.

A drilling system with the drillstring length 3000  m is analysed, in which the system parameters are selected by reference to the actual drilling situation. After the slip vibrations in the initial stage, final state of the <b>drill</b> <b>bit</b> is a stable stick-slip vibration of which the limit cycle is a closed loop. In order to find the stability of the limit cycle corresponds to the periodically stick-slip vibration, different initial conditions for the <b>drill</b> <b>bit</b> are studied.

40|$|Background and Aims: Optimization {{drilling}} parameters {{in order}} to temperature decrease during creation of hole in the bone is an interested issue. The {{aim of this study}} was to achieve optimum values of drilling parameters based on the creation of minimum temperature during jawbone drilling. Materials and Methods: In this study two models of mandible and maxilla was created and teeth 2, 5 and 8 from maxilla and teeth 25, 28 and 31 from mandible were removed. The drilling operation was performed under different conditions on jawbone models using finite element analysis and the maximum temperatures were measured in adjacent of holes. Results: <b>Drill</b> <b>bit</b> head angle of 70 degrees was created the lowest maximum temperature during drilling operation. The lowest maximum temperatures were observed in the <b>drill</b> <b>bit</b> rotational speed, <b>drill</b> <b>bit</b> feed rate and the force exerted on the <b>drill</b> <b>bit</b> equal to 200 rpm, 120 mm/min and 60 N, respectively. The use of irrigation can decrease the maximum bone temperature about 7 ºC. The maximum temperature differences in various regions of mandible and maxilla were approximately about 1 ºC. Conclusion: Sharpness of <b>drill</b> <b>bit</b> head angle, reduction of <b>drill</b> <b>bit</b> rotational speed, increasing <b>drill</b> <b>bit</b> feed rate and exerted force on <b>drill</b> <b>bit</b> and also the use of irrigation played effective roles in temperature decrease during jawbone drilling.

25|$|A drill bushing, {{also known}} as a jig bushing, is a tool used in {{metalworking}} jigs to guide cutting tools, most commonly <b>drill</b> <b>bits.</b> Other tools that are commonly used in a drill bushing include counterbores, countersinks, and reamers.
