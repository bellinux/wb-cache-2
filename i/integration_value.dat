40|$|This study {{investigated}} the value of information from both magnetic resonance imaging and magnetic resonance spectroscopic imaging (MRSI) to automated discrimination of brain tumours. The influence of imaging intensities and metabolic data was tested by comparing the use of MR spectra from MRSI, MR imaging intensities, peak <b>integration</b> <b>values</b> obtained from the MR spectra and {{a combination of the}} latter two. Three classification techniques were objectively compared: linear discriminant analysis, least squares support vector machines (LS-SVM) with a linear kernel as linear techniques and LS-SVM with radial basis function kernel as a nonlinear technique. Classifiers were evaluated over 100 stratified random splittings of the dataset into training and test sets. The area under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve (AUC) was used as a global performance measure on test data. In general, all techniques obtained a high performance when using peak <b>integration</b> <b>values</b> with or without MR imaging intensities. For example for low- versus high-grade tumours, low- versus high-grade gliomas and gliomas versus meningiomas, the mean test AUC was higher than 0. 91, 0. 94, and 0. 99, respectively, when both MR imaging intensities and peak <b>integration</b> <b>values</b> were used. The use of metabolic data from MRSI significantly improved automated classification of brain tumour types compared to the use of MR imaging intensities solely. (c) 2004 Elsevier Inc.

40|$|Pedestrian {{exposure}} {{is a necessary}} component for a meaningful evaluation of pedestrian safety. The Space Syntax approach has {{a track record of}} accurate prediction of pedestrian activity by estimating the physical street connectivity in urban environments. However, for some environments, the performance of Space Syntax is limited and cannot be used as a reliable estimate of exposure. This paper makes use of the interdependency between: (i) street connectivity - estimated here using integration; and (ii) land-use characteristics; to propose a mechanism to adjust integration by land-use features at the block level. Different levels of integration for each street-block, which hold the same mean values along the same street, are weighted based on dominant land-use features. The weighted <b>integration</b> <b>value</b> for a street-block dominated by commercial property is higher than the mean <b>integration</b> <b>value</b> for that street. Conversely, the weighted <b>integration</b> <b>value</b> for a residential street-block is lower than the mean <b>integration</b> <b>value</b> for that street. The proposed approach captures the heterogeneity of street blocks, which is not always captured by Space Syntax. Applying this method to the northern periphery of the University of California, Berkeley, has produced promising preliminary results. It was shown that the weighted integration values (at the street-block level) are better correlated with pedestrian volumes than mean integration values (street scale). Further research efforts are required to develop this simplified approach into a pedestrian exposure prediction model...|$|E

Usually trip attraction volumes are estimated based on land use characteristics. However, executing of land use-based trip attraction models are severely constrained {{by the lack of}} updated land use data in developing countries. The proposed method used network centrality-based explanatory variables as “connectivity”, “local integration” and “global integration”. Space syntax tools were used to compute the centrality of road segments. GIS-based kernel density estimation method was used to transform computed road segment-based centrality values into traffic analysis zone. Trip attraction values exhibited significant high correlation with connectivity, global and local <b>integration</b> <b>values.</b> The study developed and validated model to estimate trip attraction by using connectivity, local integration and global <b>integration</b> <b>values</b> as endogenous variables with an accepted level of accuracy (R 2  >  0. 75).

40|$|This {{thesis is}} an {{examination}} of the role of values in the development of more meaningful school based sexuality education programs. There is a growing consensus among researchers and educators that presenting only physiological information is inadequate and that sexuality education should include a <b>values</b> component. The <b>integration</b> of <b>values</b> into sexuality education is highly problematic. Because of the potential for controversy regarding questions of sexual values, many sexuality educators have attempted to teach programs that are value free. An ethical framework for the <b>integration</b> of <b>values</b> into sexuality education needs to be established. The act-centred and person-centred approaches to sexual ethics are compared and contrasted in terms of their suitability for sexuality education. It is proposed that a person-centred approach may provide a starting point of an ethical framework for the <b>integration</b> of <b>values</b> into sexuality education...|$|R

40|$|The {{first two}} papers in this {{dissertation}} discuss a fairly recently developed research field, Space Syntax, {{and how the}} findings in this field {{may be used to}} understand spatial economic patterns such as geographic distribution of market rents. Both papers use standard econometric methods to investigate the relationship between rents and the so called <b>integration</b> <b>value</b> developed within Space Syntax. The <b>integration</b> <b>value</b> may be understood as a measure of the accessibility of a certain location in a street network. The measure is constructed using tools from graph theory and uses the shape of the street network as its only input. The papers estimate hedonic models of office and retail leases from central Stockholm to test whether the <b>integration</b> <b>value</b> can help explain rents. A statistically significant effect of <b>integration</b> <b>value</b> on both office and retail rent is found. It appears as if Space Syntax adds important information to the understanding of intraurban rent patterns. Illiquidity is a main feature of most property markets and market participants are therefore directed to property appraisals to obtain information about market values. The reliability of property appraisals is therefore an important research topic. The third paper studies the “rationality” of valuations by testing if capitalisation (cap) rates from individual discounted cash-flow (DCF) valuations are consistent with economic theory. Standard econometrics is used to study the variation in cap rates. For the most part the results support the hypothesis that appraisers are “rational” in the above mentioned sense. Illiquidity of direct property also poses a problem when constructing property price indices.   Lack of price observations and heterogeneity among the few observations available is likely to introduce noise in price indices based on transactions. Valuations are therefore often used instead to construct indices. These indices however suffer from a bias due to so called “appraisal smoothing”. In the fourth paper it is shown that, given certain assumptions, one may filter out noise in a transaction-based price index by regressing it on a valuation-based index (contemporaneous and lagged one period). The procedure may in some circumstances improve pure valuation- or transaction-based indices. QC 2010120...|$|E

40|$|The {{concept of}} 'difference factor' {{has been widely}} used in {{syntactic}} analysis of space configurations as a technique to measure {{the strength of a}} spatial genotype. Where the rank order of the integration of significant household functions remains stable across a sample of dwellings, and where differences in the relative <b>integration</b> <b>values</b> are pronounced, then configuration can be said strongly to structure the form of the dwelling. Conversely, where spaces are not found in a consistent rank order then the sample does not embed a functional genotype, and where this exists but <b>integration</b> <b>values</b> are very similar to one another, the configuration of the dwelling may be said to homogenise functions and render them spatially interchangeable with one another. This paper develops these ideas with reference to a sample of traditional Turkish houses from the 17 th to the 19 th century. Difference factor is used to pinpoint those household functions which are clearly differentiated by their relative integration or segregation and which are therefore strongly structured and articulated with respect to one another, and which activities remain relatively undifferentiated and held apart by the way space is configured. Two characteristic patterns of integration are found, one centred on the sofa, and the other on the external paved courtyard of the dwelling. The social interpretation of this phenomenon will be the subject of a subsequent paper. ...|$|R
