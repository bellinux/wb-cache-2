5|$|A new note in Coutances' {{administration}} was his custom of issuing writs {{not in his}} own name, as had previously been the practice, but in the king's name. The archbishop also stressed that his <b>decisions</b> <b>were</b> made with the advice and consent {{of many of the}} leading nobles of the realm, as well as the barons of the Exchequer. This was a reaction against Longchamp's authoritarian method of government.|$|E
5|$|Despite these {{administrative}} systems, important state <b>decisions</b> <b>were</b> {{still made}} by the emperor. The emperor met with officials from the Northern and Southern Administrations twice a year, but aside from that the emperor {{spent much of his}} time attending to tribal affairs outside of the capital cities.|$|E
5|$|East Stirlingshire did {{not officially}} appoint a manager until 1966. Before then, all {{management}} <b>decisions</b> <b>were</b> {{taken by the}} board of directors at the club. The first person to manage the club was Lawrence Binnie in 1966. The club's most famous manager is former Manchester United manager, Sir Alex Ferguson, who in his first position as manager, stayed at East Stirlingshire during 1974 before moving to St Mirren.|$|E

5|$|Despite {{being the}} better {{team for the}} {{majority}} of the match, Liverpool were unable to beat the Independiente defence, with their shooting in front of goal being the culprit. Both sides questioned some of the referee's decisions. Liverpool believed they should have had two penalties, while Independiente felt that the assistant referee's <b>decisions</b> <b>were</b> questionable. Incidentally, the referee had served half of his two match ban handed out by the Brazilian Football Association.|$|E

5|$|Early on in {{the gold}} rush, the US Army sent a small {{detachment}} to Circle City, in case intervention was required in the Klondike, while the Canadian government considered excluding all American prospectors from the Yukon Territory. Neither eventuality took place and instead the US agreed to make Dyea a sub-port of entry for Canadians, allowing British ships to land Canadian passengers and goods freely there, while Canada agreed to permit American miners {{to operate in the}} Klondike. Both <b>decisions</b> <b>were</b> unpopular among their domestic publics: American businessmen complained that their right to a monopoly on regional trade was being undermined, while the Canadian public demanded action against the American miners.|$|E
5|$|In September 1277 King Ottokar II held in {{the border}} city of Opava a meeting of Polish princes. Sources doesn't specify either the exact date or the participants. Historians {{speculate}} only that they could be: Henryk IV Probus, Bolesław V the Chaste, Leszek II the Black, Władysław of Opole with his sons, Henry III of Głogów and Przemysł II. Several political <b>decisions</b> <b>were</b> made during the meeting, most notably military actions against Germany.|$|E
5|$|Korematsu v. United States {{was decided}} {{the next year}} and overshadowed both the Yasui and Hirabayashi cases. None of these cases have ever been {{overturned}} by the Supreme Court. The <b>decisions</b> <b>were</b> questioned by legal scholars even before the war had ended. Criticism has included the racist aspects of the cases and the later discovery that officials in the United States Department of Justice lied to the court {{at the time of the}} trial.|$|E
50|$|In Australia, intermediate-level courts {{tend to have}} a heavy case load, and so many <b>decisions</b> <b>are</b> {{delivered}} ex tempore {{for reasons}} of time and necessity. Because many <b>decisions</b> <b>are</b> ex tempore, intermediate-level courts' <b>decisions</b> <b>are</b> not binding on inferior courts - that is to say, that in New South Wales, the District Court's <b>decisions</b> <b>are</b> not binding on the Local Court (see Valentine v Eid (1992) 27 NSWLR 615 and stare decisis).|$|R

5|$|Leaders of the ACLU {{were divided}} on the best tactics to use to promote civil liberties. Felix Frankfurter felt that {{legislation}} was the best long-term solution, because the Supreme Court could not (andin his opinionshould not) mandate liberal interpretations of the Bill of Rights. But Walter Pollack, Morris Ernst, and other leaders felt that Supreme Court <b>decisions</b> <b>were</b> the best path to guarantee civil liberties. A series of Supreme Court decisions in the 1920s foretold a changing national atmosphere; anti-radical emotions were diminishing, {{and there was a}} growing willingness to protect freedom of speech and assembly via court decisions.|$|E

Althings were open-air governmental assemblies that met {{in the presence of the}} jarl and the meetings were open to virtually all free men.

5|$|The Cubs {{began playing}} under the College of Coaches in 1961, {{a system in}} which <b>decisions</b> <b>were</b> made by a group of 12 coaches rather than by one manager. By the 1962 season, Banks hoped to return to shortstop but the College of Coaches had {{determined}} that he would remain at first base indefinitely. In May 1962, Banks was hit in the head by a fastball from former Cubs pitcher Moe Drabowsky and was taken off the field unconscious. He sustained a concussion, spent two nights in a hospital, sat out a Monday game, and hit three home runs and a double on Tuesday.|$|E
5|$|The General Court was {{the chief}} {{legislative}} and judicial body of the colony. It was elected by the freemen from among their own number and met regularly in Plymouth, the capital town of the colony. As part of its judicial duties, it would periodically call a Grand Enquest, which was a grand jury of sorts elected from the freemen, who would hear complaints and swear out indictments for credible accusations. The General Court, and later lesser town and county courts, would preside over trials of accused criminals and over civil matters, but the ultimate <b>decisions</b> <b>were</b> made by a jury of freemen.|$|E
5|$|The inexperienced Ferdinand {{was a poor}} {{choice of}} {{replacement}} for the capable Charles, having neither maturity nor aptitude for the assignment. Although Ferdinand retained nominal command, day-to-day <b>decisions</b> <b>were</b> placed {{in the hands of}} Mack, equally ill-suited for such an important assignment. When Mack was wounded early in the campaign, he was unable to take full charge of the army. Consequently, command further devolved to Lieutenant Field Marshal Karl Philipp, Prince of Schwarzenberg, an able cavalry officer but inexperienced in the command of such a large army.|$|E
50|$|Ex tempore <b>decisions</b> <b>are</b> {{not binding}} on later courts {{due to the}} quick nature of their {{delivery}} after the hearing of a case. Therefore, these <b>decisions</b> <b>are</b> of persuasive authority only and a later court, dealing with a case of similar facts, can reach a different conclusion if it is appropriate and the court in question believes that their <b>decision</b> <b>is</b> more suitable.|$|R

5|$|There {{were two}} kinds of Red and White {{political}} violence: (i) a calculated {{part of the general}} warfare, (ii) local, personal murders and corresponding acts of revenge. In the former, the high staffs planned and organized the actions and gave orders to the lower level; at least a third of the Red terror and most of the White terror was centrally led. At first the Red and White governments officially opposed political violence, but the operational <b>decisions</b> <b>were</b> made at the military level.|$|E
5|$|A less violent side to Alexander's {{government}} {{is demonstrated by}} other evidence. Over a century after his time, his administrative <b>decisions</b> <b>were</b> still being cited as precedents. Some of these are known from a surviving edict issued on July 6, 68, {{less than a month}} after Nero's death. This denounces, and introduces measures against, a variety of abuses including inaccurate tax assessments, malicious prosecutions and the imprisonment of debtors by private creditors. The edict's only allusion to the chaotic political situation comes as a call for trust in the benevolence of the new Emperor, Galba, and his ability to put right the wrongs of the past. Alexander was making representations to Galba on behalf of the provincials, presumably representing the desired reforms as the price of loyalty from this vital grain-producing province.|$|E
5|$|Abu Bakar {{was noted}} for his {{diplomatic}} skills, {{and both the}} British and Malay rulers had approached him for advice in making important decisions. He was also an avid traveller, {{and became the first}} Malay ruler to travel to Europe during his first visit to England in 1866. In particular, Abu Bakar became a lifetime friend of Queen Victoria in his later years. Abu Bakar's friendship with Queen Victoria {{played an important role in}} shaping Johor's relationships with Britain, and was the only state by the end of the 19th century in the Peninsular Malaya to maintain autonomy in its internal affairs as the British Colonial Government pushed for greater control over the Malay states by placing a British Resident in the states. He was also an Anglophile, and many of his personal habits and <b>decisions</b> <b>were</b> aligned to European ideas and tastes.|$|E
