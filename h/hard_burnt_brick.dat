40|$|Abstract—Asphaltic {{concrete}} for pavement {{construction in}} India {{are produced by}} using crushed stone, gravels etc. as aggregate. In north-Eastern region of India, there is a scarcity of stone aggregate. Therefore the road engineers are always {{in search of an}} optional material as aggregate which can replace the regularly used material. The purpose of this work was to evaluate the utilization of substandard or marginal aggregates in flexible pavement construction. The investigation was undertaken to evaluate the effects of using lower quality aggregates such as over <b>burnt</b> <b>brick</b> aggregate on the preparation of asphalt concrete for flexible pavements. The scope of this work included a review of available literature and existing data, a laboratory evaluation organized {{to determine the effects of}} marginal aggregates and potential techniques to upgrade these substandard materials, and a laboratory evaluation of these upgraded marginal aggregate asphalt mixtures. Over <b>burnt</b> <b>brick</b> aggregates are water susceptible and can leads to moisture damage. Moisture damage is the progressive loss of functionality of the material owing to loss of the adhesion bond between the asphalt binder and the aggregate surface. Hence zycosoil as an anti striping additive were evaluated in this study. This study summarizes the results of the laboratory evaluation carried out to investigate the properties of asphalt concrete prepared with zycosoil modified over <b>burnt</b> <b>brick</b> aggregate. Marshall specimen were prepared with stone aggregate, zycosoil modified stone aggregate, over <b>burnt</b> <b>brick</b> aggregate and zycosoil modified over <b>burnt</b> <b>brick</b> aggregate. Results show that addition of zycosoil with stone aggregate increased stability by 6 % and addition of zycosoil with over <b>burnt</b> <b>brick</b> aggregate increased stability by 30 %...|$|R
40|$|The {{research}} was conducted to study the possibility of utilizing the waste over <b>burnt</b> <b>bricks</b> abun-dantly available {{in most parts of}} Gwer-West Local Government Area of Benue State, particularly Naka, the Local Government capital, as coarse aggregates in structural concrete. Trial mixes were prepared using the crushed over <b>burnt</b> <b>bricks</b> known also as brick bats as coarse aggregates only, mixture of crushed over <b>burnt</b> <b>bricks</b> and river wash gravel as well as using river washed gravel from River Benue. Cubes of concrete were prepared and tested to study the compressive strength. The result indicate that the concrete having brick bats as aggregates may be termed as medium light weight concrete having a density between 2000 - 2200 kg/m 3. To produce the same workability, the brick aggregates concrete requires greater proportion of water than the normal gravel aggregate concrete. Use of broken over <b>burnt</b> <b>bricks</b> as coarse aggregate for structural concrete is recom-mended when natural aggregate is not easily available, high strength of concrete is not required and the bearing capacity of the soil is low...|$|R

40|$|Abstract — This paper {{focused on}} the use of cassava starch as an {{additive}} in <b>burnt</b> earth <b>bricks.</b> <b>Burnt</b> earth <b>bricks</b> {{is one of the oldest}} building materials in use and abundantly found everywhere with affordable and reasonable cost. With regard to the availability of cassava in most part of the country, looking into the possibility of using cassava starch as an additive for <b>burnt</b> earth <b>bricks</b> production is of great importance in other to enhance their physical property, such as water absorption, abrasion resistance and compressive strength. Cassava starch content of 0 %, 4 %, 6 %, 10 % and 12 % were used in the mix. Batching mix by volume was adopted to get the quantity of material to be use. The specimens were produced in 100 mm cube mould, demoulded after 24 hours and air dry for 28 days of curing before burning in an electric furnace at a temperature of 1000 oC for a period of two hours. The result gotten from the research show that water absorption of <b>burnt</b> earth <b>bricks</b> was drastically reduced with the incorporation of cassava starch in the mix. Abrasion resistance and compressive strength of the earth <b>burnt</b> <b>bricks</b> were increased from 4. 09 cm 2 /g to 27 cm 2 /g and from 1. 19 N/mm 2 to 2. 19 N/mm 2 respectively at cassava starch content of 6 %. Satisfactory performance of the earth <b>burnt</b> <b>bricks</b> was achieved at an optimum amount of 6 % of cassava starch content and is thus recommended for incorporation as an additive in producing earth <b>burnt</b> <b>bricks...</b>|$|R

40|$|The project report aims at {{assessing}} <b>burnt</b> <b>bricks</b> {{project and}} its effects to people's livelihood and environment in Balizukwa Community in Misungwi District, Mwanza region. There are different types of building materials which are well known and used worldwide. Some of these materials are locally available and some have to be improved from other countries. In the ongoing drive for utilization of local building materials, <b>burnt</b> clay <b>bricks</b> play an important role. In Tanzania suitable clay for brick making is found {{in many parts of}} the country. <b>Burnt</b> clay <b>bricks</b> are a high quality building material which can be used for load-bearing walls. This material therefore provides a long term technical solution to structural walling. The production of bricks reduces construction costs as the employ utilization of local materials, need small capital investment, small transport costs, extremely good and permanent and it offers high opportunities for employment. Indeed, bricks are the best existing walling materials. Although the initial investment might be higher in some cases, the total life cycle costs are lower than most of the building materials that are in use today. Various measures have been taken by the government of Tanzania and Balizukwa community based organization on this side to eradicate the problem but the situation is still not favorable for human living standard as the case on what factors hinders the development and growth of the <b>burnt</b> <b>brick</b> projects in the community and the Balizukwa CBO as a case study. The study examined the contribution of <b>Burnt</b> <b>Brick</b> Project to the people's livelihood and environmental conservation.

40|$|The {{problem of}} Energy demand in Malawi has {{to some extent}} {{affected}} the construction industry. Almost all <b>burnt</b> <b>bricks</b> in Malawi are produced on scove kilns {{and this is an}} inefficient process and consumes a lot of fuel wood. This demand has competed with the domestic demand with disastrous effects on the environment. This paper argues that while the construction industry has ready alternative, there is a remote chance to reduce the domestic wood fuel demand until government can exploit other sources of energy in the urban areas for domestic use. The demand for <b>burnt</b> <b>brick</b> has contributed to the deforestation of Malawi. It is further argued that government should ban the use of <b>burnt</b> <b>bricks</b> and there would be a rapid growth of other brick substitutes that require very little energy to produce. The paper has outlined the basic facts of energy conversion scenarios from all available energy sources in Malawi. Conversion of wood to heat has been singled out as the least efficient and therefore recommends that the use of fuel wood for burning bricks should be discontinued while the conversion into charcoal should be checked. Other substitutes for the <b>burnt</b> <b>brick</b> should be explored and the paper has given a number of examples that would contribute to the reduction of the current large demand on wood fuel...|$|R
