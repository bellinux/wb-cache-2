40|$|ME 450 Capstone Design and Manufacturing Experience: Fall 2015 Kids In Danger is {{a nonprofit}} {{organization}} founded to protect children by making safety improvements to children’s products and furthering safety education. Team 26 was tasked with designing a portable sleeping environment, improving upon the commonly used Graco Pack ‘n’ Play collapsible crib design. In {{order to avoid the}} dangers associated with the central “V”-shape collapsing frame design used by Graco, they designed their portable sleeping environment to include sides that fold up, outward, and down to avoid contact with a child inside of the crib. Even if the crib were to become unlocked while in use, no portion of the frame would create a pinching point or suffocation point for the infant occupant. Additionally, the frame was designed to fold up to be smaller, and at least 10 pounds lighter than the Pack n Play.  The four locking joints on the frame have two possible positions, fully assembled and fully disassembled. A <b>fabric</b> <b>insert</b> has been created using the fabric materials extracted from a Graco Pack ‘n’ Play and modified to fit onto the designed frame, covering any exposed metal from the inside. Instead of being suspended, the thin mattress is placed on top of the <b>fabric</b> <b>insert,</b> and is supported by the ground.  All hardware and fasteners have fabric coverings and must have anti loosening devices to avoid occupant laceration, tearing of the mesh walls, or potential choking hazards. The most important design features of this frame prototype are the locking system that also allows for easy and intuitive setup, and the collapsing method and direction that ensures no hardware could fall onto the child occupant during an unexpected collapse. An obvious warning label system and setup instructions must also be provided to avoid incorrect setup and user error. The frame was tested and confirmed to abide by the ASTM 406 standard for collapsible crib strength requirements...|$|E

These garments need to be continuously worn so that adequate pressure {{can be applied to the}} hypertrophic scar, so as to flatten the scar and prevent contracture. Thus, pressure monitoring, patient compliance and comfort sensation are crucial in pressure garment therapy. Based on the body dimensions of patients, pattern pieces are developed in a reduced size so as to exert pressure onto specific parts of the recipients of garment pressure therapy. The amount of reduction is called the reduction factor (RF). Due to the lack of actual garment/scar interfacial pressure measurement in hospitals, the amount of pressure exerted by current therapy garments and fabrics can only be subjectively assessed based on the experience of individual practitioners. The patient compliance rate of the continuous use of pressure gloves is another concern. Most of the complaints with regards to pressure garments are related to wear comfort, which include barriers to mobility, sweating, itching, pain and poor fit. These problems are especially substantial with respect to pressure therapy gloves as the hand is most often used in the performing of daily activities and sensitive to different sensations. The aim of this research project is to improve the quality of treatment for hypertrophic scars on the hand by increasing the wear comfort of pressure therapy gloves and facilitating understanding of the pressure delivery of the glove. First, there will be a review of current custom-made pressure therapy gloves and clinical situations through an 18 -week study on 5 patients with hypertrophic scars on their hands. This will help to identify the possible direction for improving treatment outcomes. The measuring of hand anthropometric data for the development of optimal fitting gloves is crucial. In pursuing greater accuracy in hand anthropometric measurements, the scanning of hand surfaces with the aid of an image analysis system to acquire measurements is an alternative to manual means. A new hand measuring approach that uses 2 D and 3 D scanning has been proposed and evaluated through comparisons with manual measurements. It is found that hand data taken from 3 D image analysis have no significant differences compared with the manual measurements made on the hand and wrist circumferences, length and breadth. To understand the pressure given by pressure gloves made of different materials and RFs, the tensile properties and tension decay after the extension of seven types of fabrics which determined their pressure delivery ability are examined. Based on the fabric tensile behaviour, the corresponding glove pressure is predicted by the local strain, fabric tension per unit length and curvature of the hand surface. No statistical difference is found between the predicted glove pressures and the measured values. It is also revealed that the pressure measurement positions and their corresponding curvature and geometry changes caused by hand movements and postures are closely associated with the interfacial pressure delivered by the glove. The physiological and psychophysical effects of pressure therapy gloves on human responses have been investigated. The heart rate (HR), blood pressure (BP), glove-skin microclimate, hand performance, forearm muscle activity, grip strength and psychophysical responses when wearing pressure gloves made of various fabric types and with different RFs are studied through a series of wear trials with 10 subjects who do not have hypertrophic scars. The results indicate that the impacts of the different gloves on the HR and BP are not significant. However, the pressure gloves show a noticeable influence on the skin-glove microclimate. Fabric properties which include air permeability, moisture retention and drying rate are identified as the main factors that affect the skin-glove temperature. Both the fabric type and RF of the pressure gloves have no significant effects on the tactile sensitivity of the fingertips. Nevertheless, the active range of finger motion, dexterity of the fingers in carrying out daily tasks and maximum gripping force are negatively affected. The adoption of a high RF of 20 % in the glove pattern can negatively impact hand functions. The forearm muscle activity, which is measured by using surface electromyography (SEMG), is affected by the tightness of the glove. Besides that, the glove with a tighter pressure (RF of 20 %) contributes to less perceived comfort and ease of hand motion. In this study, it is also found that the current glove making process fails to provide patterns that properly fit the hand geometry, thus leading to inadequate pressure exerted onto the scar region, particularly in the finger web area. A new approach that considers the web spaces between fingers in the pattern development process of glove production is introduced. The angle of the finger web slants of 79 individuals are measured and evaluated by using a 3 D scanning and image analysis method. Glove prototypes with modifications on the web spaces between fingers are produced and assessed through a wear trial with 10 subjects. The results show that gloves made with 45 ° finger web slants can effectively improve glove fit, comfort and ease of hand motion. Insert materials made of thermoplastic (e. g. Plastazote®) are often placed underneath pressure garments to increase the local pressure for effective scar treatment. However, the currently used insert material, Plastazote®, is barely breathable and quite uncomfortable. Therefore, spacer fabric is proposed as a potential insert material. The physical properties, compression behaviour and pressure delivery ability of five types of spacer fabrics are evaluated. The results show that the spacer fabrics are not only able to provide much lower air resistance (0. 05 - 0. 12 kPa s/m) and higher water vapour transmission rates (WVTRs; 34. 35 - 102. 39 g/h·m 2) than Plastazote®, but also produce an interfacial pressure that is comparable to Plastazote® at various locations on the hand dorsum. A 24 week clinical study in which spacer fabric inserts are used in pressure gloves and applied to four hands with hypertrophic scarred skin also support that the spacer <b>fabric</b> <b>insert</b> is effective in scar treatment by providing good comfort and breathability, and hence pressure treatment acceptance and compliance are increased. With a full picture of the pressure amount given by a pressure glove, practitioners can more easily prescribe suitable pressure treatment. By using the finite element method (FEM), a biomechanical simulation model that simulates the skin pressure in relation to the contours of the human hand and fabric properties of the pressure therapy glove has been developed. The simulation model can show a trend of pressure distribution with good accuracy. As shown above, the research results provide useful information for the selection of suitable materials and RFs for pressure glove therapy. Feasible solutions to improve the glove fit and comfort of pressure therapy are suggested. The simulation model used to predict the pressure distribution over the hand dorsum can also enhance the effectiveness and treatment quality of pressure glove therapy. The output of this project can extend to the development of other pressure garments and will advance our knowledge on a new dimension of medical clothing for hospital patients.

A new methodology is discussed for the quantitative evaluation and mechanistic description of basic dye interactions with acrylic fabrics. The methodology entailed rolling a whole textile <b>fabric,</b> <b>inserting</b> the rolled <b>fabric</b> into a standard liquid chromatography column and using the column in liquid chromatography for carrying out breakthrough and retention studies of dyes and other adsorbates. Thermodynamic modeling showed that the dye-fiber interactions occurred by both hydrophobic and ionic mechanisms and these interactions were influenced by both the qualities and quantities of the electrolytes in the dye bath. ^ Based on this work, a new measurement of dye compatibility was developed. The compatibility value of cationic dyes can now be readily obtained through the frontal analysis of elution profiles obtained from samples of rolled fabric in liquid chromatography column. Adsorption of direct dyes and the void structure of water swelled cotton and ramie fabrics have also been delineated by this method. ^ Such fundamental studies have impact on improving the manufacturing technology in the textile industry and providing quantitative measurements of textile properties relative to consumer perception of high quality products. ...|$|R

Using a simulation-based approach, this study assesses the ability of thermal storage to help deliver flexibility in the operation of domestic micro-generation technologies without sacrificing householder comfort and convenience. A typical UK detached dwelling is modelled along with its heating system, which features a retro-fitted air source heat pump (ASHP). The model is used to determine the maximum possible temporal shift for different capacities and configurations of thermal storage, taking into account the influence of climate, building fabric, control settings and occupancy. The limits of time shifting are dictated by the living space temperature and the hot water temperature delivered to the occupants. The storage mechanisms examined are: the basic thermal inertia of the building fabric; increasing the space heating set point temperatures to increase <b>fabric</b> storage and <b>inserting</b> a dedicated thermal buffer between the ASHP and the heat distribution system.
