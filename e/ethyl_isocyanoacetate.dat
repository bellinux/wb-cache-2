40|$|Abstract: In the {{synthesis}} of 2 -ethoxycarbonyl- 3, 4 -diethyl-pyrrole (1) by the Barton-Zard reaction of 4 -acetoxy- 3 -nitrohexane (1 b) with <b>ethyl</b> <b>isocyanoacetate,</b> the organic base 1, 8 -diazabicyclo [5. 4. 0] undec- 7 -ene (DBU) and the solvent tetrahydrofuran (THF) were replaced with K 2 CO 3 and ethanol, respectively. Moreover, {{the preparation of the}} intermediate 1 b from 1 a by acetylation reaction was carried out by employing acetyl chloride in boiling toluene solution instead of acetic anhydride and the catalyst concentrated sulfuric acid. After treatment of 1 with excess LiAlH 4 at low temperature, the crude product 1 c (α-hydroxymethyl- 3, 4 -diethyl-pyrrole) was immediately reacted via a tetramerization {{in the presence of the}} catalyst BF 3. OEt 2 in crude CHCl 3, followed by oxidation of 2, 3 -dichloro- 5, 6 -dicyano- 1, 4 -benzoquinone (DDQ) to provide the corresponding octaethylporphyrin 2. The results indicate that using BF 3.

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this paper is}} to describe in details of various available methods to prepare C-alpha,C-alpha-dibenzylglycines (Db(z) g) and then include our work involving the synthesis of side chain Db(z) g derivatives. alpha,alpha-Disubstituted amino acids (alpha,alphaAAs) are important members in the family of modified amino acids. Replacement of the alpha-hydrogens of glycine 1 by alkyl groups leads to alpha,alphaAAs. The steric hindrance of the quaternary centre of Aib 2 combined with the helix-forming capacity has attracted the attention of structural biologists and protein crystallographers. Db(z) g 3 is a special structural variant of Aib. The presence of two benzyl groups at C-alpha-position not only impart rigidity to the peptide backbone in which it is incorporated, but also acts as a useful vehicle for studying pi-pi interactions. Although several C-alpha,C-alpha-disubstituted glycines such as C-alpha,C-alpha-diethyl glycine (Deg), C-alpha,C-alpha-dipropyl glycine (Dpg) etc. have been studied in detail, not much has been known about Db(z) g because of limited availability of synthetic procedures. Various Db(z) g derivatives 19 a-f have been prepared using <b>ethyl</b> <b>isocyanoacetate</b> 14 as a glycine equivalent (eq.). A useful and simple methodology has been developed using the Suzuki-Miyaura cross-coupling reaction for the modification of Db(z) g derivatives 17 d, 19 d, 22. Using this 'Building Block Approach' (Accounts of Chemical Research 36, 2003, 342) one can generate a variety of Db(z) g derivatives 20 a-f and 23 a-e, which may find useful applications in combinatorial synthesis and QSAR studies...|$|E
40|$|The {{focus of}} this thesis is on the {{synthesis}} of oxindole- and indole-derivatives incorporating pyrrolidins, pyrroles or imidazoles moieties. Pyrrolidino- 2 -spiro- 3 '-oxindole derivatives have been prepared in high yielding three-component reactions between isatin, alpha-amino acid derivatives, and suitable dipolarophiles. Condensation between isatin and an alpha-amino acid yielded a cyclic intermediate, an oxazolidinone, which decarboxylate to give a 1, 3 -dipolar species, an azomethine ylide, which have been reacted with several dipolarophiles such as N-benzylmaleimide and methyl acrylate. Both N-substituted and N-unsubstituted alpha-amino acids {{have been used as}} the amine component. 3 -Methyleneoxindole acetic acid ethyl ester was reacted with p-toluenesulfonylmethyl isocyanide (TosMIC) under basic conditions which gave (in a high yield) a colourless product. Two possible structures could be deduced from the analytical data, a pyrroloquinolone and an isomeric beta-carboline. To clarify which one of the alternatives that was actually formed from the TosMIC reaction both the beta-carboline and the pyrroloquinolone were synthesised. The beta-carboline was obtained when 3 -ethoxycarbonylmethyl- 1 H-indole- 2 -carboxylic acid ethyl ester was treated with a tosylimine. An alternative synthesis of the pyrroloquinolone was performed via a reduction of a 2, 3, 4 -trisubstituted pyrrole obtained in turn by treatment of a vinyl sulfone with <b>ethyl</b> <b>isocyanoacetate</b> under basic conditions. This molecule (the pyrroloquinolone), obtained in a low yield by a multistep procedure, proved to be identical with the product obtained easily via the TosMIC route. The reaction between 3 -aminocrotonates and 3 -acetonylideneoxindole in refluxing toluene resulted in 2 -pyrrolo- 3 ?-yloxindoles in high yields, (around 90 %). At room temperature the 2 -pyrrolo- 3 '-yloxindoles exist as a mixture of keto-enol tautomers. Treatment with POCl 3 yielded the corresponding 2 -chloro- 3 -pyrrolyl indole, which gave a pyrrolo annulated indolopyrane upon basic hydrolysis of the ester function of the methyl ester. 3 -Imidazolylindoles were synthesised in good yields from the corresponding benzylimine and TosMIC. Treatment of cyclohexanone benzylimine with alpha-chloroacrylonitrile yielded, after expulsion of HCN by refluxing in ethanol, 1 -benzyl- 4, 5, 6, 7 -tetrahydroindole. Formylation and benzylimine formation followed by treatment with TosMIC furnished the desired 2 -imidazolyltetrahydroindole.

40|$|Buckminsterfullerenes {{have been}} {{conjugated}} to CdSe nanocrystals by exchanging TOPO ligands on the CdSe nanocrystals with C 60 -bound dithiocarbamate ligands. To improve solubility of the C 60 -capped CdSe nanocrystals, a small molecular weight dithiocarbamate ligand {{was used as}} co-ligand in the ligand exchange reaction. The as synthesized (C 60) 8 -CdSe conjugates were purified by dialysis against ethanol and characterized by 1 H NMR, UV-vis and TEM. Photoelectrochemistry of a film cast from the (C 60) 8 -CdSe conjugate revealed a significantly enhanced photocurrent compared with the film of CdSe-TOPO nanocrystals {{as well as that}} of C 60 alone, suggesting that our conjugation strategy is viable for efficient photo-induced charge separation, transport and collection. C 60 has been conjugated to PbSe by using the similar strategy to that of the C 60 -CdSe nanoconjugate in Chapter 1. The as synthesized C 60 -PbSe conjugates were characterized by H NMR, UV-Vis and TEM. The H NMR study shows that the dithiocarbamate ligands has stronger interaction with PbSe nanocrystals than that with CdSe nanocrystals. Photoelectrochemistry of a film cast from the C 60 -PbSe nanoconjugate revealed a cathodic photocurrent, although the individual C 60 and PbSe nanocrystals generated anodic photocurrent respectively. The reversed polarity of the photocurrent suggesting the C 60 can serve as p-dopants to the PbSe nanocrystals through the surface transfer doping process. A Cu(I) -assisted C 60 -polymerization method has been developed for the seamless coating on nanosized objects of Cu 2 O, forming novel Cu 2 O-C 60 core-shell nanostructures. It is based on a reaction of C 60 and <b>ethyl</b> <b>isocyanoacetate</b> to form polymerized fulleropyrolines, catalyzed by and thus coated on the Cu 2 O nanomaterials. Cu 2 O nanoribbons and nanocubes were used in this work to demonstrate the nano-coating method.

Details of the Cu(I) -assisted C 60 -polymerization process are proposed, which combines the solution chemistry and surface chemistry of C 60. The Cu 2 O cores in the composite nanocubes could be removed, yielding monodispersed C 60 nanoboxes. Preliminary measurements demonstrated enhanced photocurrent of the Cu 2 O-C 60 nanoribbons arrayed on Cu foil compared to that of the Cu 2 O nanoribbons. Two strategies have been explored for organic functionalizations of ZnO nanotetrapods via anchor groups of carboxylate and phosphonate. With these methods, oleyl chains were assembled on surfaces of the ZnO nanotetrapods, significantly enhancing their solubility in nonpolar solvents, such as chloroform and toluene. The surface functionalization strategies have been extended to electroactive and photoactive molecules such as protoporphyrin and C 60 on the ZnO nanotetrapods. The surface modified ZnO nanotetrapods were characterized comprehensively, revealing a uniform, covalently linked monolayer assembled on the surface. This work opens a broad perspective for the application of the organically functionalized nanotetrapods in optoelectronics and biomedicine. Two-photon luminescence (TPL) spectra were measured to study the effect of protoporphyrin and C 60 to TPL properties of ZnO nanotetrapods. The results show that after modifying with protoporphyrin, the exciton emission of the ZnO nanotetrapods was red-shift for about 30 nm, which may be due to the surface charge transfer doping of protoporphyrin to ZnO nanotetrapods. After modified with C 60, the TPL spectrum of ZnO nanotetrapods was obviously enhanced to the exposure of laser with the intensity of 140 mW. The stable C 60 -ZnO nanocomposites may have applications in the nonlinear optical devices...|$|E
