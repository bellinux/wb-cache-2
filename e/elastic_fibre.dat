60|$|At this supper we were lighted {{by several}} of the native tapers, held {{in the hands of}} young girls. These tapers are most ingeniously made. There is a nut abounding in the valley, called by the Typees “armor,” closely {{resembling}} our common horse-chestnut. The shell is broken, and the contents extracted whole. Any number of these are strung at pleasure upon the long <b>elastic</b> <b>fibre</b> that traverses the branches of the cocoa-nut tree. Some of these tapers are eight or ten feet in length; but being perfectly flexible, one end is held in a coil, while the other is lighted. The nut burns with a fitful bluish flame, and the oil that it contains is exhausted in about ten minutes. As one burns down, the next becomes ignited, and the ashes of the former are knocked into a cocoa-nut shell kept for the purpose. This primitive candle requires continual attention, and must be constantly held in the hand. The person so employed marks the lapse of time by the number of nuts consumed, which is easily learned by counting the bits of tappa distributed at regular intervals along the string.|$|E

I came down here, (we had sulky drizzles all the morning, but {{an hour ago}} a lull,) for the before-mention'd daily and simple {{exercise}} I am fond of--to pull on that young hickory sapling out there--to sway and yield to its tough-limber upright stem--haply to get into my old sinews some of its <b>elastic</b> <b>fibre</b> and clear sap.

Wandering by the creek, I {{have three or four}} naturally favorable spots where I rest--besides a chair I lug with me and use for more deliberate occasions. At other spots convenient I have selected, besides the hickory just named, strong and limber boughs of beech or holly, in easy-reaching distance, for my natural gymnasia, for arms, chest, trunk-muscles. I can soon feel the sap and sinew rising through me, like mercury to heat. I hold on boughs or slender trees caressingly there in the sun and shade, wrestle with their innocent stalwartness--and know the virtue thereof passes from them into me.

The objective {{of this study was}} to characterize the organization of <b>elastic</b> <b>fibres</b> in tendon to understand their function. Immunohistochemistry was used to visualize <b>elastic</b> <b>fibres</b> in bovine flexor tendon with fibrillin- 1, fibrillin- 2 and elastin antibodies. <b>Elastic</b> <b>fibres</b> were broadly distributed throughout tendon, and highly localized longitudinally around groups of cells and transversely between collagen fascicles. The close interaction of <b>elastic</b> <b>fibres</b> and cells suggests that <b>elastic</b> <b>fibres</b> are part of the pericellular matrix and therefore affect the mechanical environment of tenocytes. Fibres present between fascicles are likely part of the endotenon sheath, which enhances sliding between adjacent collagen bundles.

In the region between the disc and the cartilaginous endplate, <b>elastic</b> <b>fibres</b> appear to anchor into the plate and terminate there.

Design:  Observational anatomic study. Samples:  Full thickness sagittal sections of 12 upper eyelids (6 right and 6 left), fixed in 10 % buffered formalin, were studied in 10 Asian cadavers (mean age at death: 77. 1 years, range: 62 – 92 years). Methods:  We analysed {{the concentrations of}} <b>elastic</b> <b>fibres</b> in Whitnall ligament and the ITL, as well as {{examined the relationship between}} Whitnall ligament and the connective tissue septa, the ITL and the levator palpebrae superioris (LPS) muscle. Main Outcome Measures:  Concentrations of <b>elastic</b> <b>fibres</b> in Whitnall ligament and the ITL, relationship between Whitnall ligament and its surrounding structures. Results:  The concentration of <b>elastic</b> <b>fibres</b> in Whitnall ligament was low compared to the ITL. In most specimens, both Whitnall ligament and the ITL were loosely attached to the LPS muscle through areas of adipose tissue or cavities. Although in all specimens, connective tissue septa were demonstrated next to Whitnall ligament, they were more often directed parallel to the ligament rather than radially to it. Conclusion:  Both Whitnall ligament, with its low concentration of <b>elastic</b> <b>fibres,</b> and the ITL, with its high content of <b>elastic</b> <b>fibres,</b> show loose attachments to the LPS muscle through areas of adipose tissue or cavities.

40|$|In {{order to}} {{determine}} the anti-atherosclerotic action of elastase, the aortas from four groups of rats—group N fed a normal diet, group D fed an atherogenic diet with vitamin Dj, group N + Ela fed a normal diet with elastase, and group D + Ela fed an atherogenic diet and vitamin Ds with elastase—were studied histologically after 3, 6, 9, and 12 weeks of feeding. - Group D displayed a remarkable atheromatous change, while the change was insignificant in group D + Ela. The histopathological findings in group D consisted of marked rarefaction, fat deposition, and atheroma in the subendothelial tissue and tunica intima; Van Gieson's staining revealed a conspicuous decrease in <b>elastic</b> <b>fibres,</b> and the remaining <b>elastic</b> <b>fibres</b> had such abnor-malities as a tortuous course, bends, and fissures. For group D + Ela, on the other hand, there were few foam cells in the subendothelial tissue and tunica intima and much less marked rarefaction of interstice and fat deposition. Further, the arrangement of <b>elastic</b> <b>fibres</b> was only slightly disordered, and the decreases in <b>elastic</b> <b>fibres</b> and their fissures were moderate. In sharp contrast to group D. which showed marked calcium deposition, group D + Ela was found to have low calcium deposition. No macroscopic and histopathologic abnormalities were found in groups N and N + Ela. Elastase had an inhibitory effect on experimental atherosclerosis in the rat and also regulated the degradation and biosynthesis of elastin, which resulted in the regeneration of <b>elastic</b> <b>fibres...</b>|$|R
40|$|Bundles of {{collagen}} fibrils, <b>elastic</b> <b>fibres</b> and fibroblasts {{are organized}} into {{a network that}} lies in the plane of {{a large portion of}} the bat wing. By ultrastructural (TEM and SEM) and biochemical analyses it was found that individual bundles of the net are similar to elastic ligaments. Although <b>elastic</b> <b>fibres</b> predominate, they are integrated and aligned in parallel with small bundles of collagen. A reticulum of fibroblasts, joined by focal junctions, forms a cellular framework throughout each bundle. Because of the unique features of the fibre bundles of the bat's wing, in particular their accessibility, and the parallel alignment of the collagen fibrils and <b>elastic</b> <b>fibres</b> in each easily isolatable fibre bundle, they should prove a most valuable model for connective tissue studies, particularly for the study of collagen-elastin interactions...|$|R
40|$|Investigation of <b>elastic</b> <b>fibres</b> {{in various}} {{human and animal}} tissues with the {{reagents}} quinalizarin, magneson II, and titan yellow {{for the detection of}} magnesium revealed striking positive results. After pretreatment of skin and ligamentum flavum with elastase the tests were negative. The results support the supposition that the amount of magnesium in <b>elastic</b> <b>fibres</b> is sufficient for histochemical detection. It is speculated that the marked chelate-forming property of magnesium, or its antagonistic function to calcium, is associated with the elastic property of the fibres...|$|R
