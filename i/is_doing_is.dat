She regards herself as a pacifist and refuses to participate in any activities where she {{will be required to}} directly take a life. Despite this she is convinced that what the group <b>is</b> <b>doing</b> <b>is</b> right and enjoys the adrenaline rush that being in dangerous situations gives her.|$|E
25|$|The {{children}} {{find out}} that in Constance’s time they kill seals for their oil. They become angered by this because this is why there are none left in their time. The children try to persuade a seal trapper that what he <b>is</b> <b>doing</b> <b>is</b> wrong, and to stop what he is doing. Mandy finds a sick seal pup and decided {{the only way to}} save the pup is to take it through the mirror, but trouble ensues.|$|E
25|$|Shortly thereafter, Cristal and {{her boyfriend}} Zack Carey, the {{entertainment}} director at the Stardust, visit Cheetah's and request a lap dance from Nomi. Although the bisexual Cristal is attracted to Nomi, her request is also based upon her desire to humiliate Nomi by proving she {{is little more than}} a prostitute. Nomi reluctantly performs the lap dance after Cristal offers her $500. James happens to be at the strip club as well and witnesses the lap dance. He visits Nomi's trailer the next morning and, like Cristal, tells Nomi that what she <b>is</b> <b>doing</b> <b>is</b> no different from prostitution.|$|E

"I {{think the}} fall in bank lending would have been worse had we not {{conducted}} our asset purchases because what we <b>were</b> <b>doing</b> <b>was</b> injecting money into the economy and what the banking system has <b>been</b> <b>doing</b> <b>is</b> destroying money. As they {{reduce the size of}} their balance sheet and deleverage, they are reducing not just the size of their assets but the size of their liabilities. Most of the money in our economy—broad money—comprises liabilities of banks in the form of bank deposits. So what we <b>were</b> <b>doing</b> <b>was</b> partially to offset what would otherwise have been an even bigger contraction." ...|$|R
25|$|The {{story of}} Adam and Eve's temptation and fall is a {{fundamentally}} different, {{new kind of}} epic: a domestic one. Adam and Eve are presented as having a romantic and sexual relationship while still being without sin. They have passions and distinct personalities. Satan, disguised {{in the form of}} a serpent, successfully tempts Eve to eat from the Tree by preying on her vanity and tricking her with rhetoric. Adam, learning that Eve has sinned, knowingly commits the same sin. He declares to Eve that since she was made from his flesh, they are bound to one another ‒ if she dies, he must also die. In this manner, Milton portrays Adam as a heroic figure, but also as a greater sinner than Eve, as he is aware that what he <b>is</b> <b>doing</b> <b>is</b> wrong.|$|E

On Sarah Jane's way out, she is almost killed by Wormwood's secretary.|$|E
500|$|Despite many {{requests}} from Rail, WCRC chairman David Smith {{refused to comment}} on the incident. In an interview with Steam Railway, [...] he stated that the company was working to satisfy the seven demands made by Network Rail, and was only cancelling trains about a week in advance, in the hope that WCRC would be able to run trains again in the future. Responding to a comment by Smith that [...] "We are co-operating with the ORR in its enquiries, but from what we can see, all it <b>is</b> <b>doing</b> <b>is</b> keeping a watchful eye on what is going on", Rail editor Nigel Harris expressed astonishment at the [...] "jaw-dropping" [...] comments as criminal charges could lead to imprisonment following a guilty verdict. The reputational damage to WCRC was described as [...] "possibly commercially fatal". Rail contributor Pip Dunn said that WCRC refused to talk to journalists when negative stories concerning the company were being reported, yet was happy to when publicising a charter it was running. On 28 May, WCRC issued a press release apologising for the distress, disappointment and inconvenience caused by the incident and events arising from it. It also thanked the ORR and others for assistance and support given. It stated that it was giving full assistance to the RAIB in respect of its investigation into the SPAD.|$|E

500|$|The album {{opens with}} [...] "Young Girls", a midtempo pop ballad {{which deals with}} the idea of indulging in the dubious charms of young girls, even though the singer recognizes that what he <b>is</b> <b>doing</b> <b>is</b> wrong. The song was re-registered in ASCAP with a new writing credit by Mac Davis. [...] "Locked Out of Heaven", a reggae rock and pop rock track that {{incorporates}} elements of new wave and funk, is the subsequent track and the lead single. Musically, it contains booming synthesizers, a four-on-the-floor chorus, while lyrically exploring themes of love. Comparisons were established between [...] "Locked Out of Heaven" [...] and the rock/reggae style used by English band The Police. [...] "Gorilla" [...] was described by Mars as being about [...] "good old animalistic sex". The track portrays a midtempo rock and soft rock song, while lyrically expressing male chauvinist sentiments and making reference to his 2010 arrest for cocaine possession. [...] "Treasure", the album's third single, is a disco-pop song, inspired by English duo Wham! and [...] "Baby I'm Yours" [...] (2010) released by French disc jockey Breakbot. The latter similarities led the song to be re-registered in ASCAP with new writing credits, which included Thibaut Berland and Irfane Christopher. [...] "Moonshine", the second promotional single from the record, portrays a recording with ample influences of disco, power pop and quiet storm, while being compared to the work done by French electronic duo Daft Punk. Particularly, Chris Martins of Spin wrote that the song [...] "channels the King of Pop, Michael Jackson with a markedly more reverent aplomb.|$|E
500|$|Upon {{being made}} a pariah, Brian is banned from every bar and {{convenience}} store in Quahog, {{making it impossible}} for him to drink. Desperate, and suffering from delirium tremens (he hallucinates seeing several alcoholic beverages begging him to drink them), Brian fakes his repentance and convinces Meg to cease all hostilities against him so he can get back to drinking, but she takes him to burn books that are [...] "harmful to God" [...] (including On the Origin of Species by Charles Darwin, A Brief History of Time by Stephen Hawking, and a book titled Logic for First Graders). A disgusted Brian admits his bluff and attempts to convince Meg that what she <b>is</b> <b>doing</b> <b>is</b> wrong. When Meg refuses to listen, Brian points out to her that if there were truly a loving God, then he would not have created Meg to have an attractive mother like Lois but have her be unattractive like Peter, and that she would not be living with a family that holds her in contempt and otherwise pretends that she does not exist (along with not even caring enough about her to get her a mumps shot). Feeling ashamed, Meg concedes to Brian's argument and apologizes for her behavior, confessing that she does not know how she can feel loved. Brian then assures her that the answers are inside herself, and the real meaning of their existence is out there somewhere. Afterward, it is revealed that the entire Family Guy universe takes place within the molecules of a lampshade in the shared bedroom of Adam West and Rob Lowe.|$|E

At the time, Rosneft was under Western sanctions over Russia’s role in the Ukraine crisis. Schröder told Blick that he would be paid about $350,000 annually for the part-time post. His decision caused an outcry in Germany and abroad, especially in a climate of fear about any potential Russian interference in the 2017 German elections. German Chancellor Angela Merkel criticized her predecessor, saying [...] "I do not think what Mr Schröder <b>is</b> <b>doing</b> <b>is</b> okay." ...|$|E
2500|$|Yon {{has been}} quoted by Fox News, by Newsmax, and by Times Online.

Barone {{has referred to}} Yon's work in his column. Oliver North has supported Yon's reporting, and John Gibson cited Yon in an editorial. New York University professor Jay Rosen has named Yon's writing as a prominent example of successful citizen journalism. Bruce Willis has stated his intention to produce a movie about Deuce Four's deployment in Iraq, to be largely based on Yon's experiences with the unit.

2500|$|Arriving on Earth-12, a {{universe}} resembling the Batman Beyond television series, another Monitor who has named himself Nix Uotan arrives, and informs Bob {{that all the}} Monitors have taken on names for themselves, such as the Monitor of Earth-8, who now calls himself Solomon. By stating that Ray Palmer lives [...] "a life of no consequence", he unintentionally reveals the location of Ray Palmer and Bob reasons {{that the only way}} Nix Uotan could know what Ray <b>is</b> <b>doing</b> <b>is</b> if he was on his Earth. The group then arrive on Earth-51, a near-perfect world where super-crime has long been eradicated. They locate Ray, living the life of his deceased counterpart. Bob reveals himself to have been working for Solomon's cause and tells Ray that he must be exterminated. The Challengers attempt to stop Bob, who succeeds in killing the alternate versions of Barry Allen, Ralph Dibny and Jean Loring, but Ray and the Challengers escape. After Monarch descends upon Earth-51, with his Crime Society and Extremists recruits, Kyle and Ray are then confronted by Power Ring and alternate versions of Booster Gold and Supergirl, whilst elsewhere Donna faces an alternate version of herself as Jason fights with Gorgon of Earth-8.|$|E
2500|$|Steven {{returned}} to the serial as a regular character following his release from hospital. Subsequent plots saw him unsuccessfully attempting to make amends with Ian and Jane for his past wrongdoing. The character also formed a friendship with Stacey Slater (played by Lacey Turner), who stopped him from committing suicide in December 2007. In the on-screen events, Steven – infuriated by Ian's rejection – soaked himself with petrol and threatened to light himself on fire. Aaron Sidwell explained, [...] "He is deeply depressed about the way Ian has been treating him since he {{returned to}} the Square...Steven just wants to end it all! Stacey is incredibly scared by what’s going on. He tells her to go away, but Stacey is determined {{to get him out of}} The Arches and stop him doing something very stupid...What he <b>is</b> <b>doing</b> <b>is</b> a cry for help." [...] In the end, Stacey managed to persuade him not to go through with suicide by showing him that friends can be just as important as family. Despite hostilities from Jane, Steven gradually regained Ian's trust, and in episodes that aired over the Christmas period of 2007, Ian welcomed Steven back into his home as part of the Beale family.|$|E
2500|$|Scope - A {{practical}} {{issue is}} whether {{the fact that an}} accused is labouring under a [...] "mental disability" [...] should be a necessary but not sufficient condition for negating responsibility i.e. whether the test should also require an incapacity to understand what is being done, to know that what one <b>is</b> <b>doing</b> <b>is</b> wrong, or to control an impulse to do something and so demonstrate a causal link between the disability and the potentially criminal acts and omissions. For example, the Irish insanity defence comprises the M'Naghten Rules and a control test that asks whether the accused was debarred from refraining from committing the act because of a defect of reason due to mental illness (see Doyle v Wicklow County Council 1974) 55 IR 71. The Butler Committee recommended that proof of severe mental disorder should be sufficient to negate responsibility, in effect creating an irrebuttable presumption of irresponsibility arising from proof of a severe mental disorder. This has been criticized as it assumes a lack of criminal responsibility simply because there is evidence of some sort of mental dysfunction, rather than establishing a standard of criminal responsibility. According to this view, the law should be geared to culpability not mere psychiatric diagnosis.|$|E
