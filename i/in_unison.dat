5|$|The fifth {{movement}} {{is the second}} aria of the cantata, scored for soprano with an obbligato accompaniment provided by the two recorders playing <b>in</b> <b>unison.</b>|$|E
5|$|Initially, in Ancient Greece, {{homophony}} indicated {{music in}} which a single melody is performed by two or more voices <b>in</b> <b>unison</b> or octaves, i.e. monophony with multiple voices. Homophony as a term first appeared in English with Charles Burney in 1776, emphasizing the concord of harmonized melody.|$|E
5|$|On April 18, 1865, the {{garrison}} at Fort Corcoran {{participated in a}} national salute to President Lincoln, who had been assassinated four days prior. At sunset, all ten guns at Fort Corcoran fired <b>in</b> <b>unison</b> with the guns of Fort Lincoln, Alexandria, and Camp Barry.|$|E

50|$|The camera {{switches}} between Joe, Vanessa, {{and the two}} shadows {{playing their}} saxophones <b>in</b> perfect <b>unison</b> (<b>in</b> colour when focused on Paradis, in black-and-white when on Joe); it ends with a front view of Joe's taxi. Joe is of African descent.|$|R
5|$|The second aria is {{accompanied}} by the strings and the two oboes da caccia <b>in</b> <b>unison</b> as obbligato instruments, thus both arias are dominated by instruments with a relatively low range (oboes de caccia having a pitch below that of a normal oboe).|$|E
5|$|Hansell {{commanded}} the 1st Wing during six critical months when the B-17 force, with only four inexperienced groups, struggled to prove itself. Among the combat doctrines that Hansell developed himself or approved were {{use of the}} defensive combat box formation, detailed mission Standard Operating Procedures, and all aircraft bombing <b>in</b> <b>unison</b> with the lead bomber, each designed to improve bombing accuracy.|$|E
5|$|In most Western music, tone {{clusters}} tend to {{be heard}} as dissonant. Clusters may be performed with almost any individual instrument on which three or more notes can be played simultaneously, {{as well as by}} most groups of instruments or voices. Keyboard instruments are particularly suited to the performance of tone clusters because it is relatively easy to play multiple notes <b>in</b> <b>unison</b> on them.|$|E

5|$|On the Confederate {{right flank}} {{a total of}} six {{batteries}} engaged the Federals, but they did so one-by-one instead of <b>in</b> <b>unison,</b> and each was consecutively cut to pieces by concentrated Union artillery fire. Moreover, they engaged the Union artillery later than the guns of the left flank, so the desired crossfire bombardment was never achieved.|$|E
5|$|On the tour's {{opening night}} at the Odeon in Cheltenham, the volume of sound created by the {{screaming}} crowds {{was so great that}} The Beatles' amplification equipment proved unequal to it, {{so much so that the}} band members were unable to hear any sounds they were making themselves, whether speaking, singing, or playing their instruments. As a result, they were unable to count songs in or perform <b>in</b> <b>unison.</b>|$|E
5|$|The loud goose-like honking call is a {{familiar}} sound, particularly during the breeding season; pairs often honk <b>in</b> <b>unison,</b> and often carry {{on for some time}} when perched. The male's call is higher-pitched and more rapid than that of the female. Australian naturalist David Fleay observed that the call is among the loudest and furthest-carrying of all Australian bird calls, {{in stark contrast to the}} relatively quiet calls of the wedge-tailed eagle.|$|E

5|$|Throughout {{the music}} video, Aguilera portrays her alter ego Baby Jane, a {{nickname}} that Nelly once gave her. The narrative scenes are punctuated by shots of two trombonists playing the Dave Cortez brass sample <b>in</b> <b>unison.</b> The video depicts {{a mix of}} styles from the 1920s, as well as modern.|$|E
5|$|Visual effects artist Aaron Juntunen {{copied the}} visuals from the Beat-Beat Revelation dance tracks from Dance Dance Revolution by using {{computer}} graphics. The tracks were played live, allowing the actors to dance <b>in</b> <b>unison.</b> Visual effects {{were also used}} to cover the name of Dawn's Liquor Mart, as the actual location did not give the production permission to use its name and logo.|$|E
5|$|Both {{the frames}} and {{pictorial}} {{areas of the}} diptych are heavily inscribed with lettering and phrases in Latin, Greek and Hebrew. Van Eyck's early works display a predilection for inscriptions, which serve a dual purpose. They are decorative while also functioning {{in a manner similar}} to the commentaries often seen on the margins of medieval manuscripts which set in context the significance of the accompanying imagery. Diptychs were usually commissioned for private devotion, and van Eyck would have expected the viewer to contemplate text and imagery <b>in</b> <b>unison.</b>|$|E
2500|$|A guitalin (...) is a Northern American folk {{instrument}} {{that is a}} part of the lute family, having four courses of strings. Its fourth course is tuned to an octave while the remaining courses are tuned <b>in</b> <b>unisons.</b> The instrument can be either finger picked or plucked with a plectrum. It was invented in October 1962 by Lyle Mayfield of Greenville, Illinois. The guitalin is a non-traditional, hybrid folk instrument, as it incorporates features of multiple traditional folk instruments into one.|$|R
50|$|It is {{not thought}} of as a {{monolithic}} proto-language, but rather as a group of closely related dialects that underwent several areal changes <b>in</b> relative <b>unison.</b>|$|R

5|$|Every five years, two censors {{were elected}} for an eighteen-month term. Since the {{censorship}} {{was the most}} prestigious of all offices, usually only former consuls were elected to it. Censors were elected by the assembly of Roman Soldiers, the Centuriate Assembly, usually after the new consuls and praetors for the year began their term. After the censors had been elected, the Centuriate Assembly granted the new censors censorial power. Censors did not have imperium powers, {{and they were not}} accompanied by any lictors. In addition, they did not have the power to convene the Roman Senate or Roman assemblies. Technically they outranked all other ordinary magistrates (including consuls and praetors). This ranking, however, was solely a result of their prestige, rather than any real power they had. Since the office could be easily abused (as a result of its power over every ordinary citizen), only former consuls (usually patrician consuls) were elected to the office. This is what gave the office its prestige. Their actions could not be vetoed by any magistrate other than a plebeian tribune, or a fellow censor. No other ordinary magistrate could veto a censor because no ordinary magistrate technically outranked a censor. Tribunes, by virtue of their sacrosanctity as the representatives of the people, could veto anything or anyone. Censors usually did not have to act <b>in</b> <b>unison,</b> but if a censor wanted to reduce the status of a citizen in a census, he had to act <b>in</b> <b>unison</b> with his colleague.|$|E
5|$|In all {{butterflies}} (with {{the exception}} of male Euschemoninae) and in Bombycoidea moths (with {{the exception of}} the Sphingidae), there is no arrangement of frenulum and retinaculum to couple the wings. Instead, an enlarged humeral area of the hindwing is broadly overlapped by the forewing. Despite the absence of a specific mechanical connection, the wings overlap and operate in phase. The power stroke of the forewing pushes down the hindwing <b>in</b> <b>unison.</b> This type of coupling is a variation of frenate type but where the frenulum and retinaculum are completely lost.|$|E
5|$|Most of {{the planets}} in the Solar System have {{secondary}} systems of their own, being orbited by planetary objects called natural satellites, or moons (two of which, Titan and Ganymede, are larger than the planet Mercury), and, {{in the case of}} the four giant planets, by planetary rings, thin bands of tiny particles that orbit them <b>in</b> <b>unison.</b> Most of the largest natural satellites are in synchronous rotation, with one face permanently turned toward their parent.|$|E

5|$|Of all {{the strains}} in the piece, the final D strain {{is perhaps the}} most interesting. It is written in B-flat minor. When Joplin used minor keys in the {{previous}} sections, he used the relative key of G minor (i.e., relative to the main key of B-flat major). However, in this fourth section, he instead used the parallel key. This strain also features sections where the right hand and left hand play notes <b>in</b> <b>unison,</b> and in which the standard 2/4 time left-hand beat is noticeably absent.|$|E
5|$|Possibly due to {{the speed}} at which she was constructed, Tsukuba {{reportedly}} suffered from numerous defects. Shortly after she was completed in 1907, the ship sailed for America where she participated in the Jamestown Exposition Naval Review in May. The ship then sailed to Europe where she made numerous port visits over the next several months. While in Britain, Tsukuba was fitted with a Vickers fire-control system that calculated the firing data for each gun and with which the gunnery officer fired the guns <b>in</b> <b>unison.</b> Ikoma visited England in July 1910 as part of the Japan–British Exhibition.|$|E
5|$|The Illinois Freedom Bell is {{annually}} rung <b>in</b> <b>unison,</b> at 1 pm CDT (18:00UTC) on the Independence Day, July 4, {{with other}} bells across the United States. Thousands of people {{gather in the}} village to hear the bell each year on Independence Day. In Mount Morris, the annual event {{is known as the}} Let Freedom Ring festival. The Mount Morris festival and bell ringing has been attended by several notable individuals. In 1973, future Illinois Governor and member of the 9/11 Commission, James Thompson attended the festival and bell ringing. A year later, in 1974, Richard Blake, a noted Abraham Lincoln impersonator, appeared at the festival to speak as Lincoln.|$|E
