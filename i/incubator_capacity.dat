30|$|Furthermore, {{this review}} {{encourages}} new and emerging businesses to avail themselves the business assistance, monitoring, expert networks, resource munificence and advisory {{services provided by}} incubators as these value addition activities have the potential of improving their ability to source for finance, improve patents application and the building of alliance. The study also recommends that <b>incubator’s</b> <b>capacity</b> to leverage knowledge flows from its expert external network should be deepened so that incubatees and prospective incubatees should benefit to increase their chances of survival. Also, the study recommends that tenants should not overstay their tenancy in an incubation program as doing so reduces their chances of survival upon graduation. Finally, prospective incubatees to increase their chances of acceptance in an incubation program should creatively focus on improving their market, management and financial proposals since incubators focus on these factors {{in the selection of}} businesses to be incubated.|$|R
40|$|Abstract: The {{expansion}} of human mesenchymal stem cells as suspension culture {{by means of}} spinner flasks and microcarriers, compared to the cultivation in tissue culture flasks, offers the advantage of reducing the requirements of large <b>incubator</b> <b>capacities</b> as well as reducing the handling effort during cultivation and harvesting. Nonporous microcarriers are preferable when the cells need {{to be kept in}} viable condition for further applications like tissue engineering or cell therapy. In this study, the qualification of Biosilon, Cytodex 1, Cytodex 3, RapidCell and P 102 -L for {{expansion of}} hMSC-TERT with an associated harvesting process using either trypsin, accutase, collagenase or a trypsin-accutase mixture was investigated. A subsequent adipogenic differentiation of harvested hMSC-TERT was performed in order to observe possible negative effects on their (adipogenic) differentiation potential {{as a result of the}} cultivation and harvesting method. The cultivated cells showed an average growth rate of 0. 52 d- 1. The cells cultivated on Biosilon, RapidCell and P 102 -L were harvested succesfully achieving high cell yield and vitalities near 100 %. This was not the case for cells on Cytodex 1 and Cytodex 3. The trypsin-accutase mix was most effective. After spinner expansion and harvesting the cells were successfully differentiated to adipocytes...|$|R
40|$|Survivability {{and growth}} {{potential}} of chicks {{are linked to}} both the micro-environment around the embryo and the hatching time. Early hatched chicks may be too long exposed to a hostile environment without water and feed access. Industrial incubators often register hatch window around 48 h, which causes non-uniformity problems during rearing. Technologies for hatching detection include the monitoring of embryo bioresponses, as this paper describes a system for continuous measurement of eggshell temperatures (EST) during incubation associated to a video system as a reference method. The objective {{was to investigate the}} EST variations during the hatching process. Two small-scale <b>incubators</b> with <b>capacity</b> for 300 eggs each were used for three rounds of incubation trials. A total of 1800 fertilized Ross 308 eggs were used during the study. For each incubation trial, 10 focal eggs per incubator were individually monitored using EST sensors and video recordings. The results indicated EST measurements as a potential monitoring tool for detection of the exact hatching time of individual chicken embryos. Whenever there was an accentuated EST drop (~ 3 °C) during the hatching period (from 472 h to 500 h) it was confirmed as hatching time in the reference videos. status: publishe...|$|R
40|$|In this study, {{the effects}} of microsparger on oxygen {{transfer}} velocity caused by micro aeration and reproduction of Heterorhabditis megidis {{in the process of}} using microsparger for mass culture production of entomopathogenic nematodes, Heterorhabditis megidis were examined. When ringsparger and microsparger were used in the incubator, changes in oxygen transfer coefficients (K_La) were measured. It tended to significantly increase when microsparger with small pore size was used. It seemed to be caused by increase in the contact area between air bubbles and media. On the other hand, in the case of microsparger, the K_La value was not increased, but it tended to be decreased when pore size got smaller despite the increase in aeration rate and stirring rate. In addition, Oxygen Uptake Rate (OUR) of Heterorhabditis megidis was 0. 63 × 10 ^– 2 mmol O_ 2 / L • min at appropriate incubation temperature of around 25 ˚C, and it tended to rapidly increase. While being cultured, the number of the optimal inoculated bacteria in 4, 000 showed the highest yield of 300 × 10 ^ 3. On the 9 ^th day of incubation, the final yield of 3 stage IJ per ml was 400 × 10 ^ 3. 25 μm microspargerwas attached to the <b>incubator</b> with <b>capacity</b> of 3 l and Heterorhabditis megidis was cultured. As the result, Heterorhabditis megidisgrew with a high yield only when dissolved oxygen concentration fell below 20 % and it was ventilated rather than continuous aeration...|$|R
40|$|The study {{includes}} {{the analysis and}} a critical report of the European and Italian Microfinance Institutions (MFI) working, on a local basis, in the urban context. From {{the study of the}} European network the author indicates a framework for the creation of an MFI model that could be replicated on a local basis (taking as reference the urban context of the City of Turin as an indication of the Italian situation) and proposing an harmonization of the local development strategies through a new framework, which would integrate and renew existing proposals already present locally through both private and public institutions. Particular attention will be given to the adaptation and development process of microfinance as an instrument in the local urban context of the developed countries, with specific reference to the downscaling of traditional banks institutions. The research proposal should be viewed as an attempt to harmonize experiences and translated those into a clear and defined proposal, based upon an institutional agreement (both public and private). Particular attention has also been paid to the mapping of the international network of Italian and European partners (ADIE France, WEETU, First Step, European Microfinance Network and other actors in the European and Italian market) {{and the development of a}} local network able to prepare a proposal for a replicable and innovative framework. The research activity developed for the completion of the Ph.

40|$|Significant {{changes have}} {{recently}} been described regarding circulating peripheral immune cells immediately following spaceflight. Existing methods for immunophenotype staining of peripheral blood in terrestrial labs {{do not meet the}} constraints for flight on the Space Shuttle. We have recently described the development and use of the Whole Blood Staining Device (WBSD), a simple device for staining flow cytometry specimens during spaceflight. When preparing samples with the WBSD, all liquids are safely contained as the cells are moved through staining, lysis and fixation steps. Here we briefly review the use of the WBSD, and then describe another versatile adaptation, a modification to perform intracellular staining of cytokines for detection by flow cytometry. Alterations in cytokine production have been reported both in ground-based simulated microgravity culture and in astronaut samples returning from spaceflight. Data regarding microgravity effects on cytokine production for specific subpopulations of cells is lacking. Flow cytometric cytokine analysis offers the unique ability to perform simultaneous surface marker analysis and positively identity cytokine producing subsets of cells. The utilization of the WBSD provides the ability to perform rapid and routine mitogenic activation during spaceflight coupled with the ability to perform simultaneous surface marker analysis. The only external requirements for this procedure are an in-flight 37 -degree <b>incubator</b> and the <b>capacity</b> for 4 -degree storage...|$|R
40|$|The Vx 2 and Vx 7 rabbit carcinomas, both of Shope {{papilloma}} derivation, were {{cultivated in}} vitro and studied for immunofluorescence {{indicative of the}} presence of viral antigen. The cultured Vx 7 cells were characteristically pleomorphic, round or polygonal cells, and immunofluorescence was demonstrable in 5 – 20 % of them as counted on cover slip cultures after exposure to rabbit sera containing anti-Shope papilloma virus antibody. The Vx 2 cells in contrast to this were of almost uniform size and character, small and approximately round, and the specific fluorescence was found in less than 0. 1 % of the total number. These findings indicate that some antigenic derivation from the Shope papilloma virus is still persisting at least in some fractions of the cells, not only of Vx 7 tumors but also of the Vx 2 tumors, even after maintenance of the growths by transplantation for more than 20 yr. During the course of the study, two lines of the Vx 7 were kept continually growing while the culture of Vx 2 was discontinued at its tenth passage after an accident due to mechanical failure of the <b>incubator.</b> The neoplastic <b>capacity</b> of the Vx 7 cells cultured in vitro was demonstrated by implanting these intradermally on the ears of domestic rabbits.

At present, human beings as well as animals and vegetables {{are subject to the}} effects of biocides and food preservers, without knowing realy the consequence of such effects. For the purpose of studying their effects on the embryonic development, fertil eggs of Leghorn and Arbor Acres hens were sprayed with the fol 1 owing commercial products: 2, 4 -D; 2, 4,S-T and Endrin, individually and with normal and higher than normal concentrations as used in our cropfields (for cereals). A gas <b>incubator</b> with a <b>capacity</b> for 60 eggs was used, with two daily turns, magnifyinglenses, etc. Batch of control eegs (water and organic solvent) and of eeg treated with various concentrations of the commercial products named, were placed there in. The classification of the embryos was made according to the Hamilton table. The teratogenic anormalitics were studied through morphologic control and the date of embryonic development stoppage was determmated. The chickens born were weighed and then killed, their brains taken out, weighed and processed for the chemical determinations. Total proteins were determined by the Lowry et. aL method, total lipids by gravimetry, phospholipids by the Dodge and Phillips method and nucleic acids (DNA and RNA) by the Munro and Fleck method. It was noted that the external application of pesticids on fertil eggs at the concentrations recommended for our crops does not produce alterations in the normal development of the embryo, but at a concentration four times higher, teratogenic effects are observed as well as an embryonic death, the increasing order of toxicity being 2, 4 -D 2, 4, 5 -T and Endrin. This means that the pesticid has penetrated through the shell to the egg. A variation in the brain concentrations of proteins, total lipids and nucleic acids was shown, but not of the brain weight, water percentage or of phospholipids...|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{contributes}} to business incubation research, focused on business environments in Uganda and Tanzania. Business incubation {{is not a}} new phenomenon and research began in earnest in the 1980 s. Thus, there is a broad range of studies on business incubators, how they are defined and what they do to support entrepreneurs. Establishment of business incubators has also been increasingly common as a method of supporting entrepreneurs who are expected to increase regional and national economic growth through their activities. The phenomenon of business incubation originates in the US and Europe but has an increasing prevalence {{in the rest of the}} world. However, there is a gap in the literature regarding the understanding of how context impacts the establishment of business incubators, especially in African countries. The aim of this thesis is to develop a deeper understanding of business incubator establishment in selected African settings. Moreover, this thesis is based on a perspective of entrepreneurship as embedded in social and economic contexts. The aim is approached through three questions, delving into the expectations on and embodiments of the entrepreneurs, the role of context, and how theories of business incubation and its propagation may be adjusted based on the findings from this research. The theories chosen to understand business incubator propagation are institutional theory, actor network theory and a transfer model. The research conducted is qualitative with a design based on an interpretative approach. This approach is deemed appropriate as the research questions aim to explore business incubation and have developed over time through the process of the research. The empirical settings of Uganda and Tanzania are suitable for the study because they include a mix of formal and informal institutional environments and show a current increasing trend of business incubators. Other characteristics for these environments are a small private sector and an abundance of entrepreneurs. The thesis builds on empirical material from two field studies including interviews, participant observations, and secondary data. The findings indicate that a business incubator may be seen as a complement to a broader system of entrepreneurship support. However, business incubator establishment needs to include an increased awareness of prerequisites, limitations and consequences of such establishment. Prerequisites include how embeddedness in a mix of formal and informal institutions influences the performance of economic transactions for the entrepreneurs. Furthermore, business <b>incubators</b> have <b>capacity</b> limitations creating a difficult task for managers responsible for identifying promising entrepreneurs from the large variety of entrepreneurs found in the studied settings. These findings are consequential since the funding of business incubators could possibly be spent elsewhere. This thesis {{contributes to}} business incubator theories through an understanding of how business incubators are embedded in the studied contexts. Furthermore, the theories of propagation included in this thesis facilitate the understanding of how business incubators travel around the world, but need to be sensitised towards power asymmetries between countries. The analysis of managerial practices of business incubators contributes to business incubator policy by suggesting a deeper analysis of local needs and of how to compensate for contextual constraints...|$|R
50|$|Until 70 years, {{agriculture}} {{was severely}} underdeveloped in Gjilan. The land is mostly manual work and with primitive tools. Usage seeds for planting are traditional, qualitative and not productive, while extensive livestock breeds dominated and low productivity. In 70 years, agriculture marks are more intensive development. In this period, gains momentum social sector development in combines was organized in cooperatives and agricultural stations such as Station for the Advancement of Agriculture, Agricultural Combine, Agricultural Cooperatives, Tobacco Plant, City Butchery for small animals and thick, birds <b>Incubator</b> for opening <b>capacity</b> of 9 million birds a year, freezer for fruit trees, veterinarian service stations etc. All these agrarian subjects had employed around 4,000 permanent workers and about 10,000 seasonal workers.

This trend of development continues {{until the end of}} 80, when the application of violent measures starts in Kosovo in undertaking and starts dismissals of all Albanian workers, replaced by Serbs, inexperienced and uninterested to work. The aim of the Serbian occupation, colonization and looting was the destruction of agriculture that was set up and developed with farmers toil and sweat of Albanian workers. War of 1999, in addition to the effects on people, nonrefundable damage caused to agriculture and the economy in general. After liberation farmers began work in very difficult conditions, without tools and without the machine working properly. In the meantime, the government was not properly consolidated. For central and local institutions did not have the budget nor the experience needed to face the challenges of the time, on one hand, while many foreign organizations who had come to offer help in the consolidation of Kosovo agriculture acted without any clear concept and did not yield the expected results, on the other hand, agriculture suffers stagnation fore. With the start of the privatization process, the majority of the mentioned agrarian undertakings changed their destination. Only two of them as plantations in Kravarica and poultry farm in Livoc village - Konsoni maintain their subjectivity and revive their previous production. Konsoni abattoir opened for broilers with an annual capacity of 600,000 thousand kg of meat. This farm has 60 full-time employees and a certain number of seasonal worker with a bright development prospect. Two companies MOEA and Ask Food have raised capacity of orchards in area of about 200 hectares and have built processing capacities, investments these promising prospects. Ask Food has signed contracts for the export of its products to Germany, Albania etc. These two companies have approximately 150 regular employees and 200 seasonal workers.|$|R
