Many critics, including Peter Bogdanovich and Jonathan Rosenbaum, also consider Chimes at Midnight to be Welles's finest work. Several years after its initial release, film critic Vincent Canby of The New York Times wrote that Chimes at Midnight [...] "may be the greatest Shakespearean film ever made, bar none." [...] Joseph McBride has called it [...] "Welles's masterpiece, the fullest, most completely realized expression of everything {{he had been working}} towards since Citizen Kane."

500|$|Raymund Flandez of The Wall Street Journal {{described}} the episode as [...] "a {{turning point for}} Glee", commenting that although there had previously been criticism {{of many of the}} characters for being [...] "one note", this episode demonstrated that was not the case, showing that Will has a playful side, Sue has feelings, and Puck is able to [...] "emerge from his bonehead-punk exterior". Andrea Reiher of Zap2it was glad that Will's wife Terri did not appear in the episode, commenting: [...] "I like Jessalyn Gilsig but that character <b>drives</b> <b>me</b> outhouse-rat crazy." [...] Eric Goldman for IGN rated the episode 8.2/10, writing that he wished Sue's relationship with Rod could have lasted more than one episode, as: [...] "it would have been amusing to see happy, in love Sue a bit longer, before her inevitable return to evil." ...|$|E

When I read books or see films or listen to albums I want certain things. I want a heart—I'm very old school like that, I'm very emotional... I just didn't want anybody to know. I wanted it for myself. The lyric to 'Cocoon' was a whole diary, then I had to edit 90 per cent of it out. It's very hard to explain, but when I read it and the other person it's about reads it, we don't feel abused or anything. I think there's songs where I've been more... scruffy about what I'm expressing. I have a problem with music that's too indulgent. It's like 'Keep your own dirty laundry, please'".|$|E

According to Chicago Sun-Times writer Michael O'Brien, , Rose had a 3–0 advantage in defining moments: [...] "the back-to-back dunks against Washington {{in the city}} championship at the United Center, the game-winning shot in overtime to give Simeon the state championship against Peoria Richwoods and the dismantling of Oak Hill, the top-ranked team in the country." [...] Rose's game against the Oak Hill team with Brandon Jennings, Nolan Smith and Alex Legion on ESPN is described as Rose's national introduction. Although there are comparisons to Rose, his game is most often compared to Grant Hill and Paul Pierce. Dime Magazine describes him as [...] "Grant Hill with a jump shot". Parker claims to model his game after Paul Pierce and Carmelo Anthony.

Erlewine listed [...] "Remember the Time" [...] as being a highlight from Dangerous.

[...] Jon Parales of The New York Times commented that [...] "titles like 'Remember the Time', 'She <b>Drives</b> <b>Me</b> Wild' and 'Give in to Me'" [...] tell the lyrics' [...] "whole story - though they don't suggest the wretched tone he has when he sings them." [...] Richard Harrington, a writer for The Washington Post, described [...] "Remember the Time" [...] as being [...] "wistful," [...] commenting that {{he felt that the}} song featured Jackson's [...] "least affected vocal performance" [...] but that it [...] "builds an engaging, radio-friendly momentum".|$|E

Yankovic noted that it was [...] "fun to pick [...] and figure out some of those almost subliminal parts — parts that would fade in and out, little bell sounds, things you don't really hear on first listening." [...] On May 25, 1989, Yankovic recorded [...] "Isle Thing", a parody of [...] "Wild Thing" [...] by Tone Lōc, {{about a woman who}} introduces the narrator to the television show Gilligan's Island. Notably, the song is Yankovic's first rap parody; an earlier rap, [...] "Twister", is a Beastie Boys style spoof, but not a direct parody. Another Tone Lōc hit, [...] "Funky Cold Medina", is referenced in the lyrics: [...] "Ginger and Mary Ann coulda used some funky cold medina". The final parody, [...] "She Drives Like Crazy" [...] — recorded the same day as [...] "Isle Thing" [...] — is a spoof of Fine Young Cannibals' 1988 single [...] "She <b>Drives</b> <b>Me</b> Crazy". Lyrically, the song is about a man who fears his girlfriend's crazy driving habits.|$|E

Respers France named Pearce's {{performance}} the best {{moment of the}} episode, {{and found that the}} character positively reminded her of [...] "Glee of old". The song was also a favorite of Lee's, who wrote that the intensity of the actress was perfectly matched to the character's disposition. West, Slezak and Benigno gave the performance an [...] "A"; the former called it an [...] "outstanding rendition" [...] which [...] "felt like it belonged on a big stage or in a big-screen musical", and the latter two praised her vocal talent, which Benigno deemed unequalled on Glee. Futterman and Bell found Harmony a credible rival to Rachel vocally, and eagerly anticipated future competition between them. Urban called Pearce's performance merely [...] "serviceable". Though she felt her acting was a weak point, she compared her favorably to season two guest star Charice and praised her vocals. Criticism came from New York Lindy West, who did not understand Rachel's humiliation, as New Directions [...] "sing way more elaborate and equally competent arrangements four to five times an episode". She elaborated, [...] "This is a thing that <b>drives</b> <b>me</b> crazy about Glee.

I mean there's certain musicians who have nothing better to do than complain, People, that can't feel fortunate for what they have been given, and if you don't want it, then fucking just quit and get away from it. It <b>drives</b> <b>me</b> insane when I hear musicians that don't understand how fortunate they are that they don't have to go and pump gas for twelve hours a day. They can sit on their couch and smoke pot, and complain to their friends that they hate it when someone comes up and says that he likes their band. And it also has to do with... I mean there are two sides: there's the reluctant rock-star, {{and then there is the}} prying journalist that almost lives for the reluctant rock-star, it's just talking [...] "about the hand you've been dealt." [...] Every time I hear about [...] "the hand you've been dealt," [...] it <b>drives</b> <b>me</b> fucking nuts, spare me your confessions. And paramania is the joy of complaint, like if you're a pyromaniac — if you're a paramaniac, you love complaining about everything. I don't want to complain about anything, I want people to know that I'm happy doing what I'm doing. I've had so many fucking bullshit jobs for the half of my life - you know, working in furniture warehouses and planting trees, painting houses - and it's a lot more fun to play music." ...|$|E

From today, it is only 18 days until the carnaval starts. How it torments me to think that there are still so many days to go; I wish it were tomorrow;... I want you to know... that the sound of the conga nourishes me, the sound of the frying pans gives me life and the sound of the bocú <b>drives</b> <b>me</b> crazy. [...] Several days prior to the beginning of rehearsals, I went to see a doctor; I felt overwhelmed, sad, pensive. He prescribed and gave me some injections, and I felt absolutely no different, but as soon as I heard the sound of the first bocú, I was completely cured, I felt strong and ready for anything. And I advise those who are unhappy and listless to get an invigorating injection of bocú, conga and frying pans and you’ll be OK in 24 hours.” (Pérez II 1988:22-3) ...|$|E

The rehearsals were very tense and would inevitably split the band into two separate camps. Butler {{had his own}} agenda and he frequently clashed {{with the rest of}} the band and producer Ed Buller, who he had concerns with during the recording of the first album. Butler seemed to antagonise his separation further when he appeared on the front cover of Vox magazine with the tag line, [...] "Brett <b>drives</b> <b>me</b> insane." [...] The interview explained how Butler liked to improvise and how Anderson made this impossible because of his slow ways of working, and his obsession with rock stardom. A despondent Anderson remembers reading the article the same morning he was recording the vocals for [...] "The Asphalt World": [...] "I remember trying to channel all this hurt that I was feeling and the iciness I was feeling into the vocal." [...] Butler later apologised to Anderson over the incident. Musical differences over [...] "The Asphalt World" [...] triggered the next dispute. The version that made it on to the album clocks in at nine minutes 25 seconds, but according to bass player Mat Osman, Butler's initial creation was a 25-minute piece with an eight-minute guitar solo.|$|E
