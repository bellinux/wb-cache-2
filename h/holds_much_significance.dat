Though Trajan declared Bostra to be the capital of the province, he also awarded Petra the status of metropolis, as a sign that he agreed in the matter of its importance with his successor, Hadrian, who considered it to be more dignified and historic.|$|R
40|$|In mammals, egg {{activation}} is {{initiated by}} multiple cytosolic Ca 2 + transients (Ca 2 + oscillations) that are triggered following {{delivery of a}} putative sperm factor from the fertilizing sperm. The identity of this ‘sperm factor’ thus <b>holds</b> <b>much</b> <b>significance,</b> {{not only as a}} vital component in creating a new life, but also for its potential therapeutic and diagnostic value in human infertility. Recent data have emerged suggesting the sperm factor may be a post-acrosomal sheath WW domain-binding protein (PAWP). However, a significant body of research points to a testis-specific phospholipase C zeta (PLCζ) as the sperm factor. Herein, we examine the evidence presented in favour of PAWP in relation to PLCζ and the requisite physiological properties of the mammalian sperm factor...|$|E
30|$|The results {{obtained}} {{in this study}} were in agreement with other literature reports, where rice grain was found to be the most suitable media for mass culture of B. bassiana (Sharma et al. 2002; Sahayaraj and Namasivayam 2008). Sahayaraj and Namasivayam (2008) reported rice (11.24  ×  106 spore/g) and wheat grain (11.76  ×  106 spore/g) as the most suitable substrate for B. bassiana spore production. However, in comparison to above studies, the present study which utilizes agricultural waste (unsuitable for human consumption) as substrate <b>holds</b> <b>much</b> <b>significance.</b> Moreover, utilization of food grains for biopesticide production would not be economical. Investigations concerning fungal enzyme production on seed oil cake have been reported (Joshi and Khare 2011). The low spore production obtained with seed cakes (jatropha and pongamia) in this study could be attributed to their organic content (C/N ratio) or presence of antinutritional factors such as phorbol esters, curcin and trypsin inhibitors (Ameen et al. 2011). Makkar et al. (2008) reported Jatropha curcas seed cake meal to be toxic to rats, mice, ruminants and humans. However, recent reports on reductions of cyanide, tannin, oxalate, trypsin inhibitors and other toxins from the J. curcas seed cakes during SSF with fungi (Belewu and Sam 2010; Ameen et al. 2011), indicates that jatropha if used as substrate, would not only help in biopesticide production, but the detoxified seed cake would also serves as protein rich feed for livestock. Literature reports on B. bassiana spore production on some other seed cakes as; gingelly seed cake (5.35  ×  1010 spores/ 100  g) and cotton seed cake (4.31  ×  1010 spores/ 100  g) medium, observed comparatively higher spore yield (Abraham et al. 2003).|$|E
40|$|Possibilities of seismic {{methods of}} {{reflected}} and refracted waves {{have been examined}} {{for the purposes of}} detailed study on crystalline basement structure. Investigation of depth and structure of the basement {{plays an important role in}} the exploration of various deposits. Sedimentary cover is usually associated with oil and gas reserves. Ore deposits are formed in the basement rocks, basement splits and structure of its surface have a genetic relation not only to ore minerals, but also to oil resources. Reflection seismology is one of the main seismic methods of investigating structural geometry of the sedimentation mass, forecasting its material composition and possible hydrocarbon reserves. However, its possibilities for investigating crystalline basement are limited. Basing on many years’ experience of reflection seismology and physical modeling it has been identified that actual roughness of basement surface limits the obtainable amount of waves reflected from it. Possibilities of reflection seismology for basement structure study are mostly related to investigation of discontinuous faults as diffraction objects using diffracted waves. Method of refracted waves combined with modern procedures and material processing aimed at getting dynamic seismic sections <b>holds</b> <b>much</b> <b>significance</b> for the basement study, especially in the process of surface mapping and, to a lesser extent, in investigating discontinuous faults. Combining seismic methods of reflected and refracted waves in basement study increases reliability of forecasting its geological structure: in particular, its surface can be well defined by means of refraction seismology, and zones of discontinuous faults are identified from diffraction objects using both reflection and refraction methods. As a result of applying both reflection and refraction seismology, an opportunity arises to carry out detailed analysis of basement structure and to predict its oil and gas content...|$|E
40|$|International audienceWe {{studied the}} socio-spatial {{representations}} and collective memory of Brest, {{a city that}} was heavily destroyed during the Second World War, among a sample of young residents. The methodology used combined word associations, open questions {{in the form of}} a questionnaire, and cognitive maps. The results show that participants’ representations of Brest are situated in the present because the city is the context in which they experience important (personal and professional) life stages. The painful past of the war is remembered superficially, as if the urban monuments – the physical symbols of history – do not <b>hold</b> <b>much</b> <b>significance</b> for the city’s young people. We conclude by formulating several hypotheses on the social representations of this “old and forgotten” Brest by new generations, alongside a discussion on two major issues: the trauma of the war and the city’s military function as a naval base...|$|R

2500|$|Sacred art {{does not}} <b>hold</b> <b>much</b> <b>significance</b> among Telugu Christian {{communities}} {{because the majority}} of Telugu Christians are Protestant and therefore do not approve of statues or other religious objects of such nature. On the other hand, Church architecture in Andhra Pradesh is rich and diverse. Most churches and cathedrals in the region conform to the Gothic Revival style because the missions which had the greatest influence in the area were either from England or America. Unlike in other parts of India such as Goa and Mangalore, the Portuguese played little part in the spread of Christianity in Andhra Pradesh and therefore Andhra Pradesh has very little Baroque architecture. Churches of much architectural value can be found across the length and breadth of Andhra Pradesh even in smaller towns and villages that have been influenced by missionary activity. Christ Lutheran Church in Narsapur, West Godavari is one example of such beautiful churches in rural areas. With a red brick exterior, this church is a fine example of the Gothic Revival style that was greatly patronised by the British. Indian motifs have been delicately incorporated into the architecture of several religious buildings.|$|R

50|$|Though montage {{was widely}} {{acknowledged}} in principle as the mechanism that constitutes cinema, {{it was not}} universally believed as cinema’s essence. Lev Kuleshov, for example, expressed that though montage makes cinema possible, it does not <b>hold</b> as <b>much</b> <b>significance</b> as performance, a type of internal montage. Additionally, Kuleshov expressed the subservience of montage {{to the will of}} those who deploy it. In his comparisons between Russian, European, and American cinema prior to the Russian Revolution, Kuleshov could not identify a unifying theory between them and concluded a relativistic approach to filmmaking, opting for something similar to later auteur theories. The implication of an exclusive focus on montage is one in which performances become unconvincing given the actors jilted belief in his/her own significance.|$|R

Similarly, Yeroğlu (2001) suggested that the most important benefit of simulation is not searching for absolute answers, therefore putting great emphasis on the accuracy of the simulation results should be avoided.|$|R
40|$|Fundamental {{frequency}} contours for speech, as {{obtained by}} common pitch tracking algorithms, contain {{a great deal}} of fine detail that is unlikely to <b>hold</b> <b>much</b> perceptual <b>significance</b> for listeners. In our experiments, a radically reduced pitch contour consisting of a single linear segment for each syllable was found to judged as equally natural as the original pitch track by listeners, based on high-quality analysissynthesis. We describe the algorithms both for segmenting speech into syllables based on fitting Gaussians to the energy envelope, and for approximating the pitch contour by independent linear segments for each syllable. We report our web-based test in which 40 listeners compared the stylized pitch contour resyntheses to equivalent resyntheses based on the original pitch track, and also to pitch tracks stylized by the existing Momel algorithm. Listeners preferred the original pitch contour to the linear approximation in only 60 % of cases, where 50 % would indicate random guessing. By contrast, the original was preferred over Momel in 74 % of cases...|$|R
40|$|By {{comparing}} historical {{narratives that}} coincided in WW II, I intend {{to examine how}} the national identities of the Netherlands and South Korea contrasted {{with one another and}} illustrate how the former Comfort Women have been represented within their own social constructs thereafter. A crucial reason for partaking in a historical comparison, between the Netherlands and South Korea, is to combine a lesser documented case with a case which has received substantially more coverage in academia and the media. By examining historical events, I propose to shift the perspective from gaining formal recognition and compensation from the Japanese government, which is often the point of view in the media and an often discussed topic by academics, to instead: How were the former Comfort Women treated and represented by their own society after WW II? It is important to examine the Comfort Women Issue from a different perspective because the perspective of the society of which the former Comfort Women are a part of, <b>holds</b> as <b>much</b> <b>significance</b> in historical terms of accountability as the issue of the Japanese government’s reticence to offer satisfactory recompense...|$|R
40|$|The {{motivation}} {{for this research}} stems from the authors experience as a resident engineer spanning two decades, the observation of significant value engineering opportunities persistently remaining available at construction stage {{and the belief that}} the engineer’s role could be enhanced significantly if these were grasped. At present clients are increasingly dissatisfied with the service they receive from design professionals. Contractors are no longer covering up the failures of engineers and are developing stronger ties with clients. This development risks alienating the consulting engineer who must deliver improved performance or risk becoming redundant. Value engineering has potential to fill this gap and redefine the consultant’s role. This research explores the opportunities it can bring to the engineer in meeting the changing needs of clients with particular emphasis on the critical design phase. The methodology was to combine a wide-ranging and comprehensive survey with an in-depth case-study of a specific ACEI firm. This enabled the researcher to cross-check “macro” results against a “micro” environment. The research did not envisage evaluating the merits of different value engineering techniques however if successful, the research will bring the concept of value engineering into the main stream of the Irish construction industry. The literature review did not uncover any studies concerning the adoption by consulting engineers of a value engineering role and this paper is unique in this regard. The sample group comprised all consulting civil/structural engineering firms on the ACEI register. More than 97 % of respondents held director positions with 70 % having over 20 years experience. Given the 39. 3 % response rate the results are significant. The findings <b>hold</b> <b>much</b> <b>significance</b> for consulting engineers: a widespread resistance to value engineering, the negative effect of competitive tendering, engineers own recognition of their ability to a better service, the concept of value engineering is poorly understood. The recommendations include: the establishment of a Government taskforce to explore policy and legislative solutions to the problems the research has brought to light; pilot studies should be introduced to investigate the potential of value engineering in an Irish context; the negative effects of competitive fee tendering on the application of value engineering should be addressed; value engineering should be incorporated in relevant engineering syllabi...|$|R
