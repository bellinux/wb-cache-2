6000|$|... "Ahuh!... <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>how</b> <b>you</b> <b>feel.</b> But, boy, I'd rather {{live with}} one leg an' be loved by Collie Belllounds than have nine legs for some other lass." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "O, now, dear George, that {{is really}} wicked! <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>how</b> <b>you</b> <b>feel</b> about losing your place in the factory, {{and you have a}} hard master; but pray be patient, and perhaps something--" ...|$|E
5000|$|<b>How</b> Do <b>I</b> <b>Know</b> <b>How</b> <b>You</b> <b>Know?,</b> Seattle Art Museum, Seattle, WA, June 3-October 31 ...|$|R
6000|$|... --Damn me, said Mr Dedalus frankly, if <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>how</b> <b>you</b> can smoke such villainous awful tobacco. It's like gunpowder, by God.|$|R
6000|$|... "Don't do it--stay {{here and}} fight it out. <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>how</b> <b>you</b> feel--I {{felt that way}} when they called me 'a poorhouse nobody.'" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You {{have made}} me the happiest man in the world," [...] he said. [...] "I can't stop a moment longer--I should simply say extravagant things. And <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>how</b> <b>you</b> <b>feel.</b> It isn't quite time for them yet. But you'll send for me?" ...|$|E
6000|$|She whispered, [...] "Never mind, dear. I don't care. It was all {{twice as}} much fun as being wheeled in lacy prams by cranky nurses, as Jeff and I were. But <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>how</b> <b>you</b> <b>feel.</b> Are you ashamed of having been a prairie pirate?" ...|$|E
60|$|Oh, <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>how</b> <b>you</b> <b>feel!</b> I've been in hell myself. You {{are there}} tonight. By {{difference}} in {{time you are}} at luncheon, now--and not eating it. Nothing is so lonesome as gadding around platforming. I have declined 45 lectures to-day-England and Scotland. I wanted the money, but not the torture: Good luck to you!--and repentance.|$|E
6000|$|... "But {{you were}} men. You did not forget your secret honour, though the whole cosmos turned an engine of torture {{to tear it}} out of <b>you.</b> <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> <b>how</b> near <b>you</b> were to hell. <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>how</b> <b>you,</b> Thursday, crossed swords with King Satan, and <b>how</b> <b>you,</b> Wednesday, named me in the hour without hope." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Miss Granger, the {{occasion}} is too serious for polite fibs. <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>how</b> <b>you</b> saved my life. <b>I</b> do not <b>know</b> <b>how</b> to thank <b>you</b> for it." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'It's all right,' said Una. 'I'm {{getting on}} for thirteen. I've never been whipped, but <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>how</b> <b>you</b> felt. All the same, {{it must have}} been funny!' ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Now that's {{just what}} I find so {{significant}} among the English'--this was Alice's mother, I think, with one elbow well forward among the salted almonds. 'Oh, <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>how</b> <b>you</b> <b>feel,</b> Madam Burton, but a Northerner like myself--I'm Buffalo--even though we come over every year--notices {{the desire for}} comfort in England. There's so little conflict or uplift in British society.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "'One question, Andrew. <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>how</b> <b>you</b> <b>feel</b> just at present. You are a loyal {{man like}} myself, {{but we all}} feel the same. I will sign your permit for any save one. Give me your word that neither of these men is Charles Stuart. I care not who they may be beside, but as a loyal subject of King George I cannot aid his arch enemy to escape.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "By the way, don't {{speak of}} that to Mother," [...] he said; [...] "she has enough to frighten her with this affair of yours. <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>how</b> <b>you</b> <b>feel.</b> But, Jon, you know her and me well enough to be sure we wouldn't wish to spoil your {{happiness}} lightly. Why, my dear boy, we don't care for anything but your happiness--at least, with me it's just yours and Mother's and with her just yours. It's all the future for you both that's at stake." ...|$|E
60|$|GEORGE (turning to BERT). Well, here's wishing you luck, Bert, {{and hoping}} we'll meet over there. <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>how</b> <b>you</b> feel,--you {{want to be}} in it, just as I do.|$|R
6000|$|... "Dearest Amelia, you {{are very}} unwell," [...] the visitor said, putting forth her hand to take Amelia's. [...] "What is it? I could not rest until <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> <b>how</b> <b>you</b> were." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Say, <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>how</b> <b>you</b> mean. You feel {{something}} like what I did in England. You can't get next {{to what the}} folks are thinking, {{and it makes you}} sort of lonely." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I don't want to. <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>how</b> <b>you</b> <b>feel</b> about it, Mistress Blythe--just as I feel meself. But it ain't our {{feelings}} {{we have to}} steer by through life--no, no, we'd make shipwreck mighty often if we did that. There's only the one safe compass and we've got to set our course by that--what it's right to do. I agree with the doctor. If there's a chance for Dick, Leslie should be told of it. There's no two sides to that, in my opinion." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "What is the good," [...] said Ashe, [...] "of {{traveling}} fast if you're going {{round in}} a circle? <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>how</b> <b>you</b> <b>feel.</b> I've {{felt the same}} myself. You are an individualist. You think there is something tremendous just round the corner and {{that you can get}} it if you try hard enough. There isn't--or if there is it isn't worth getting. Life is nothing but a mutual aid association. I am going to help old Peters--you are going to help me--I am going to help you." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "My dear," [...] she said, [...] "as I told you, I {{think you}} are doing right, and I believe <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>how</b> <b>you</b> <b>feel.</b> Everybody prophesied {{disaster}} when I came out to join Allen from a sheltered home in Montreal, and at the beginning my life here {{was not easy to}} me. It was all so different, and there were times when I was afraid, and my heart was horribly heavy. If it hadn't been for Allen I think I should have given in and broken down. He understood, however. He never failed me." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh, I am glad!" [...] Kate exclaimed. [...] "You know, Captain Whitney, that I {{was sure}} of your innocence; but <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>how</b> <b>you</b> must have longed {{for it to be}} proved to the world.|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{shall never}} forget you, lady; {{and even the}} black water will not quite {{separate}} us. As <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> <b>how</b> <b>you</b> were in prison, so <b>I</b> shall <b>know</b> <b>how</b> <b>you</b> are in your home in England. What we have done is little. Did not the sahib risk his life for me? My father and I will never forget what we owe him. I am glad {{to know that you}} will make him happy." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{never felt}} {{the way you}} did about Rogers, but <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>how</b> <b>you</b> always did feel, and I guess I {{surprised}} him with my answer. He had brought along a lot of stock as security----" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, {{you seem}} a {{reasonable}} sort of chap," [...] the sailor said, [...] "and {{to take things}} coolly. That's the way, my lad; when the king, or the queen now--it's all the same thing--has once got his hand on you it's of no use kicking against it. I have been pressed twice myself, so <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>how</b> <b>you</b> <b>feel.</b> Here, mates," [...] he said {{to two of the}} other sailors, [...] "lend a hand and get a bucket of fresh water and a pannikin, and half a dozen buckets of salt water, and let these lads have a drink and a wash." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "My dear," [...] she said, [...] "as I told you, I {{think you}} are doing right, and in some respects I believe <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>how</b> <b>you</b> <b>feel.</b> Everybody prophesied {{disaster}} when I came out to join Allen from a sheltered home in Montreal, and at the beginning my life here {{was not easy to}} me. It was all so different, and there were times when I was afraid, and my heart was horribly heavy. If it hadn't been for Allen I think I should have given in and broken down. He understood, however. He never failed me." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "So that pesky Weasel {{has been}} after you again, {{and you came}} to me for help," [...] said he gently, as he coaxed Happy Jack to come to him. [...] "This {{is the place to}} come to every time. Poor little chap, you're all of a tremble. I guess <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>how</b> <b>you</b> <b>feel</b> when a Weasel is after you. I guess you feel just as I felt when I dreamed that that monster was after me. My, but you {{certainly}} did give me a scare when you touched my face!" [...] He gently stroked Happy Jack as he talked, and Happy Jack let him.|$|E
6000|$|... "Yuh, <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>how</b> <b>you</b> mean. And it's {{good of you}} to like beating {{it around}} with me. But you sure got the exaggerated idee of me. And you'd get sick of the holes I'm likely to land in." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "It wasn't all my fault," [...] he said. [...] "You didn't {{have to take}} a drink." [...] His voice fell to {{a pathetic}} whimper. [...] "I was showing you {{hospitality}} the best way <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> <b>how.</b> <b>You</b> won't never <b>know</b> <b>how</b> <b>you</b> hurt my feelin's." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'I {{could not}} sleep until <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> <b>how</b> <b>you</b> had fared,' said he. 'I have paid a price for my papers. There are not {{so many of my}} old {{soldiers}} left that I can afford to lose two in one night.' ...|$|R
6000|$|But he followed. [...] "Don't talk in that way, Loo! Don't look in that way, dear!" [...] he said, {{taking her}} hand gently, yet {{not without a}} sense of some {{inconsistency}} in her conduct that jarred upon his own simple directness. [...] "You know that nothing can part us now. I was wrong to let my little girl worry herself all alone here, but I--I--thought it was all so--so bright and free out on this hill,--looking far away beyond the Golden Gate,--as far as Cathay, you know, and such a change from those dismal flats of Tasajara and that awful stretch of tules. But it's all right now. And now that <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>how</b> <b>you</b> <b>feel,</b> we'll go elsewhere." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Why, I {{believe the}} child's sca'ed of me! But you needn't be. Don't you suppose <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>how</b> <b>you</b> <b>feel?</b> You set {{down in that}} chai'a there, and I'll tell you how you feel. I guess we've been pooa, too--I don't mean {{anything}} that a'n't exactly right--and I guess I've had the same feelin's. You think it's demeanin' to you to take it. A'n't that it?" [...] Clementina sank provisionally upon {{the edge of the}} chair. [...] "Well, it did use to be so consid'ed. But it's all changed, nowadays. We travel pretty nee' the whole while, Mr. Lander and me, and we see folks everywhere, and it a'n't the custom to refuse any moa. Now, a'n't there any little thing for your own room, there in your nice new house? Or something your motha's got her heat set on? Or one of your brothas? My, if you don't have it, some one else will! Do take it!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I'm half-feminine, I believe," [...] he said. [...] "For instance, I've {{got just}} a woman's joy in textures and little {{significant}} shapes. <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>how</b> <b>you</b> <b>feel</b> about that. I can spend hours, even now, in crystal gazing--I don't mean {{to see some}} silly revelation of some silly person's proceedings somewhere, but just for the things themselves. I wonder if you have ever been in the Natural History Museum at South Kensington, and looked at Ruskin's crystal collection? I saw it when I was a boy, and it became--I can't help the word--an obsession. The inclusions like moss and like trees, {{and all sorts of}} fantastic things, and the cleavages and enclosures with little bubbles, and the lights and shimmer--What were we talking about? Oh, about the keen way your feminine perceptions cut into things. And yet somehow I was throwing contempt on the feminine intelligence. I don't do justice to the order of my thoughts. Never mind. We've lost the thread. But I wish you knew my mother." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes; <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>how</b> <b>you</b> see it," [...] she {{answered}} with despairing self-suppression. [...] "But I {{am going to}} marry him again, {{as it would be}} called by you. Strictly speaking you, too--don't mind my saying it, Jude!--you should take back--Arabella." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I am sorry, uncle," [...] he said earnestly, [...] "I {{have come}} to look on these things a little differently. Many years ago, in America, I used to wonder {{what it was that}} kept you apart from every one else, kept the smile from your lips, made you accept good fortune or ill without any sign of feeling. I was too young to {{understand}} then, but I realise everything now. <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>how</b> <b>you</b> denied yourself to send me to school and college. <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>how</b> <b>you</b> left yourself almost a beggar when you gave me the chance of my life and trusted me with all your savings. These things I shall never forget." ...|$|R
6000|$|Maxwell {{turned white}} with anger. [...] "I didn't {{try to make}} her think I did, anyway. But <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> <b>how</b> <b>you</b> really felt, and I don't believe you deceived her very much, either. All the same I was ashamed to see you try." ...|$|R
