Hybrid railroad ties are also used to be partly exchanged with rotten wooden ties, which will result in continuous track stiffness. Hybrid plastic ties and composite ties also offer benefits on bridges and viaducts, because they lead to better distribution of forces and reduction of vibrations into respectively bridge girders or the ballast.

40|$|ABSTRACT: An attempt {{has been}} made to develop fly ash filled polymer matrix {{composites}} with high damping behavior. Fly ash filled polymer matrix composites do not show very high <b>damping</b> <b>property</b> and this limits their application in many fields. Hence, unsaturated polyester resin (UPE) was blended with SBR latex in three proportions and this blend was used as the matrix for making the composites. Both 40 and 50 wt % fly ash loaded blend matrix composites were prepared by the room temperature casting method. Flexural properties were investigated. The damping behaviors of the composites were determined by dynamic mechanical analysis (DMA). The presence of latex particles significantly enhanced the <b>damping</b> <b>property.</b> The combination of damping behavior with good mechanical property was optimized. UPE resin blended with 5 wt % SBR latex was found to have good strength with enhanced <b>damping</b> <b>property.</b> Very high <b>damping</b> can be achieved with the UPE/ 10 wt % SBR latex blend matrix having 50 wt % fly ash loading. The fracture surfaces examined under SEM revealed good compatibility between the various components of the systems.

Meanwhile, the <b>damping</b> <b>property</b> and the anti-aging {{property of the}} blends were investigated by DMA, AFM, SEM and so forth. The results show that after {{the addition of the}} GO and MGO, the tangent of loss angle(tan δ) increases and also the anti-aging property is improved. When adding less amount of GO in the matrix, the anti-aging property is better; when adding MGO in the matrix, the amount of addition is not obviously related with the anti-aging property of the blends. The dispersion of GO and MGO has positive correlation with its anti-aging property. By microscopic analysis, the main reason for the decrease of anti-aging property of the blends is the agglomeration of the GO.

40|$|Viscous dampers are energy {{dissipation}} devices widely employed for the seismic control of structures. The performance of systems equipped with viscous dampers {{has been extensively}} analyzed by employing deterministic approaches. However, these approaches neglect the response dispersion due to the uncertainties in the input {{as well as in}} the structural system properties. Some recent works highlighted the important role of these uncertainties in the seismic performance of systems with linear or nonlinear viscous dampers. The present study focuses on the uncertainty in the <b>damper</b> <b>properties</b> and it aims at evaluating its influence on the probabilistic response of the damped system. In particular, the variability of the <b>damper</b> <b>properties</b> is assumed to be constrained by the tolerances allowed in qualification and production control tests. A preliminary study on the damper response is carried out to relate the constitutive damper characteristics to the parameters controlled in the experimental tests and to evaluate the consequences of damper parameter variations on the dissipation properties of the device. In the subsequent part of the study, the response hazard curves, providing the relation between the values of the response parameters of interest and the relevant yearly exceedance probability, are evaluated. In the analyses, a simplified structural system is considered, and the Subset Simulation (SS) algorithm is employed together with the Markov Chain Monte Carlo method to achieve a good estimate of small probabilities of exceedance. A sensitivity analysis, considering the expected variations in the <b>damper</b> <b>properties,</b> is finally carried out by employing the Augmented SS method to study the influence of the device acceptance ranges on the hazard curves...|$|R

The damping energy dissipation of “horizontal” interface structure and “vertical” interface structure was researched. The results have shown that, the damping of “vertical” interface structure was slightly higher than the damping of “horizontal” interface structure in the same bending vibration loading environment. The mechanical energy dissipation produced by APS coating structure and EB-PVD coating structure may be different. The slipping of interface between coating and substrate was dominated in the interface damping of APS coating, while in the interface damping of EB-PVD coating structure the both interface slip and crack extension contributed.

40|$|Effects of inertia on {{oscillations}} in ring {{networks of}} unidirectionally coupled sigmoidal neurons are studied. It {{is known that}} ring neural networks without inertia are bistable and the duration of transient oscillations increases exponentially {{with the number of}} neurons. In this paper, kinematical description of traveling waves in the oscillations in the networks is extended to networks with inertia. When inertia is below a critical value and the state of each neuron is over <b>damped,</b> <b>properties</b> of the networks are qualitatively the same as those without inertia. The duration of the transient oscillations then increases with inertia, and the increasing rate of the logarithm of the duration becomes more than double. When inertia exceeds a critical value and the state of each neuron becomes under <b>damped,</b> <b>properties</b> of the networks qualitatively change. The periodic solution is then stabilized through the pitchfork bifurcation as inertia increases. More bifurcations occur so that various periodic solutions are generated, and the stability of the periodic solutions changes alternately. Further, stable oscillations generated with inertia are observed in an experiment on an analog circuit...|$|R

50|$|Hybrid LC filter {{is a kind}} of {{electrical}} LC filter, which typically contains two conductive foil layers, separated by an insulation material and coiled on a core. Layers are typically made of copper or aluminum. One layer, which is placed between the voltage source, such as inverter, and a load, is called “the main foil”; this layer forms filter inductance. Another foil, called “the auxiliary foil”, is connected to a neutral potential (e.g. earth), forming the useful capacitance between foils. This way the self-capacitance of the main foil is crucially decreased. Filter is characterized by improved high-frequency performance (working frequency range is at least up to tens of MHz). The mutual inductance between foil layers is rather large, coupling factor is typically about 0.95-0.99.

An active sensing approach using a customized swept acoustic wave with a frequency range between 100 Hz and 300 kHz was used to study the wave attenuation in the soil in correlation to soil moisture levels. Two sandy soil specimens, each embedded with a pair of SAs, were made in the laboratory, and the water percentage of the soil specimens was incrementally decreased from 15 % to 3 % during the tests. Due to the change of the soil water status, the <b>damping</b> <b>property</b> of the soil correspondingly changes. The change of the <b>damping</b> <b>property</b> results in the variation of the acoustic wave attenuation ratios.
