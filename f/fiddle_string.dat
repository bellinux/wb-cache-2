25|$|In {{the years}} before World War II, the music {{industry}} began to refer to honky-tonk music played from Texas and Oklahoma to the West Coast as hillbilly music. More recently, the term has come {{to refer to the}} primary sound in country music, developing in Nashville as Western swing became accepted there. Originally, it featured the guitar, <b>fiddle,</b> <b>string</b> bass, and steel guitar (imported from Hawaiian folk music). The vocals were originally rough and nasal, as exemplified by the singer-songwriters Floyd Tillman and Hank Williams, but later developed a clear and sharp sound, such as that of George Jones and Faron Young. Lyrics tended to focus on working-class life, with frequently tragic themes of lost love, adultery, loneliness, alcoholism, and self-pity.|$|E

The first contends that wind flowing over the Fiddle Range with a certain speed and direction mimicks {{the sound of a}} #4 <b>fiddle</b> <b>string.</b> The second story argues that the outline of the range resembles that of a violin. The name Fiddle River first appeared in 1846.|$|E
