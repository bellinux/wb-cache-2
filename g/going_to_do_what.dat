500|$|... "Cocktails" [...] {{was written}} by Paul Lieberstein, who plays Human Resources {{representative}} Toby Flenderson on the series. Lost series creator J. J. Abrams was hired on as episode director, his first such credit for the series. Abrams disliked the American series when it first premiered, due to his love for the original British series. The director explained, [...] "I resented it before I saw it, because I thought, 'well, how are you <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>what</b> Ricky and Steve did. In fact, the first season I didn't get into it at all. In the second season, they really found their voice. And that's despite having to make 22 episodes, which is twice the length of what the BBC show did. And I thought that the show became brilliant. I was really impressed by how it worked." ...|$|E

500|$|The Virginia Tech defense {{looked to}} recover from its slide during the last five games of the regular season. During the Hokies' first eight games (all wins), Tech gave up averages of 10.5points, 267.5total yards and 40.8rushing yards per game. In the final five games (in which Tech went 1–4), the Hokie defense allowed averages of 32.8points, 446.7total yards and 229.4rushing yards per game. This led to doubts about Tech's ability to stop the Falcons' top-ranked rushing attack. Head {{defensive}} coach Bud foster said, [...] "... right now {{you just kind of}} have a question mark: Are we <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>what</b> we're taught to do?" [...] That late-season falter still saw Tech ranked as the No.20 rushing defense in the country heading into the San Francisco Bowl, allowing an average of just 113.31yards per game.|$|E
500|$|Tittle {{threw the}} ball from a sidearm, almost underhand position, {{something}} novel at those times, though it was common practice in earlier decades. It was this seemingly underhand style that drew the curiosity and admiration of many fans. In tandem with his baldness—for which he was frequently {{referred to as the}} [...] "Bald Eagle"—he made for a very striking personality. Despite his throwing motion, he had a very strong and accurate arm with a quick release. It was because of his quick release and ability to read defenses that {{he became one of the}} best screen passers in the NFL. He was a perfectionist and highly competitive, and he expected the same of his teammates. He possessed rare leadership and game-planning skills, and played with great enthusiasm even in his later years. [...] "Tittle has the attitude of a high school kid, with the brain of a computer," [...] said Giants teammate Frank Gifford. Baltimore Colts halfback Lenny Moore, when asked in 1963 to compare Tittle and Colts quarterback Johnny Unitas, said:I played with Tittle in the Pro Bowl two years ago, and I discovered he's quite a guy... He and John, however, are entirely different types... Tittle is a sort of 'con man' with his players... he comes into a huddle and 'suggests' that maybe this or that will work on account of something he saw happen on a previous play... The way he puts it, you're convinced it's a good idea and maybe it will work. John, now, he's a take-charge guy... you what the other guy's <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>do,</b> <b>what</b> he's going to do, and what he wants you to do.|$|E

2500|$|Among the {{allegations}} {{in the book}} were claims by Armstrong's former soigneur Emma O'Reilly that a backdated prescription for cortisone had been produced in 1999 to avoid a positive test. A 1999 urine sample at the Tour de France showed traces of corticosteroid. A medical certificate showed he used an approved cream for saddle sores which contained the substance. O'Reilly said she heard team officials worrying about Armstrong's positive test for steroids during the Tour.

[...] "Obviously, I'm very disappointed", he said. [...] " [...] year was a little bittersweet", he said. [...] "Because you bust your butt for three years for a manager, you give it your all and don't complain, and you contribute {{so much in the}} regular season, then to have it taken away in the postseason ...

2500|$|Blackman is {{a rarity}} {{as a female}} jazz percussionist. [...] "In the past, {{there were a lot}} of stigmas {{attached}} to women playing certain instruments", Blackman says. [...] "I think a lot of women stick to particular instruments, like piano, that are acceptable, so that lessens the playing field in terms of how many women are out there. And let's face it, boys' clubs still exist. But I care nothing about that at all. I'm <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>what</b> I'm going to do musically anyway."

Every movie, I worked very hard to make them different… I made them completely different—different planets, different spaceships to make it new." [...] In early December 2015, Kathleen Kennedy told The Hollywood Reporter that Lucas had seen the movie and [...] "liked it". In the same month, at the Kennedy Center Honors, Lucas said: “I think the fans are going to love it, It’s very much the kind of movie they’ve been looking for."

In November 1978 the band entered the UK live circuit and gained a reputation for their strong performances, which included covers of classic soul songs and originals. Rowland and Archer employed a strict code of conduct, ruling out and drinking or drug use before performances, and introduced many of the band members to activities such as shoplifting expeditions and bumping trains.|$|E
