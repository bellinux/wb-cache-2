5000|$|Senior Walkout: {{carried out}} on the first <b>day</b> <b>of</b> <b>snowfall.</b> Seniors leave class for the day to engage in snowball fights or pursue other {{activities}} outside of the school. Often these snowball fights {{will take place in}} the school courtyard. During years without snowfall, Senior Walkout is transferred to {{the first day of the}} year in which the temperature tops 90° Fahrenheit. In recent years, the Hunter Administration has attempted to restrict and ban Senior Walkout, due to violence in recent years. Differing from past practice, Hunter's Term Council now consults with the Hunter Administration for an appropriate day to have a sanctioned Senior Walkout. After 2008, Hunter seniors were forced to remain in the courtyard during walkout, and prohibited to leave the school grounds. In the winter of 2010, the Hunter administration suspended two senior students for [...] "interrupting the school community." [...] No specific charges were brought or announced. For the Class of 2011, however, the Hunter Administration attempted to cancel Senior Walkout indefinitely. The Class of 2012, however, brought the return of the unsanctioned walkout, as seniors left with neither administrative sanction nor snow.|$|E
