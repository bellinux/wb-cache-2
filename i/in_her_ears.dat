2500|$|It {{is claimed}} that in January 1881, that Krao {{and her parents}} were {{captured}} during an expedition conducted by the explorer Carl Bock {{to what is now}} northern Thailand and Laos. An anthropologist named Dr. George Shelly was part of the expedition and took charge of Krao. Krao was described as being part of a primitive tribe of humans called [...] "Kraos-monink" [...] all of whom were covered in hair and lived in trees. Her parents were also captured. The Siamese had to be bribed by Bock and Shelley into capturing them because of the belief that it was bad luck to kill or capture Kraos-monink. Krao's mother was detained in Bangkok and her father died from cholera. They were said to lack the knowledge of fire and survived upon fruits, fish, and nuts. Her name was said to mean [...] "ape" [...] in Siamese. She was also described as having a number of anatomically unusual features in addition to her body hair including an extra Thoracic vertebrae, an extra pair of ribs, cheek pouches, hypermobility of her joints, and lacking cartilage <b>in</b> <b>her</b> <b>ears</b> and nose.|$|E
