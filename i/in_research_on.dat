5|$|The fourth {{revision}} of the Stanford–Binet scales (S-B IV) was developed by Thorndike, Hagen, and Sattler and published by Riverside Publishing in 1986. It retained the deviation scoring of the third revision with each standard deviation from the median being defined as a 16 IQ point difference. The S-B IV adopted new classification terminology. After this test was published, psychologist Nathan Brody lamented that IQ tests had still not caught up with advances <b>in</b> <b>research</b> <b>on</b> human intelligence during the twentieth century.|$|E

25|$|The longest a human {{has ever}} been proven to live is 122 years, the case of Jeanne Calment {{who was born in}} 1875 and died in 1997, whereas the maximum {{lifespan}} of a wildtype mouse, commonly used as a model <b>in</b> <b>research</b> <b>on</b> aging, is about three years. Genetic differences between humans and mice that may account for these different aging rates include differences in efficiency of DNA repair, antioxidant defenses, energy metabolism, proteostasis maintenance, and recycling mechanisms such as autophagy.|$|E
25|$|Repeated-measures {{experiments}} are those which take place through intervention on multiple occasions. <b>In</b> <b>research</b> <b>on</b> {{the effectiveness of}} psychotherapy, experimenters often compare a given treatment with placebo treatments, or compare different treatments against each other.

A set of special markers (called Cohen Modal Haplotype or CMH) was defined as one which {{is more likely to}} be present in the Cohanim, defined as contemporary Jews named Cohen or a derivative, and it was proposed that this results from a common descent from the ancient priestly lineage than from the Jewish population in general.|$|E

They have constructed at least three distinct molecular devices whose motion is controlled from the desktop with changing voltage: a nanotube nanomotor, a molecular actuator, and a nanoelectromechanical relaxation oscillator.

25|$|Maryland is a U.S. {{state with}} a musical {{heritage}} {{that dates back to}} the Native Americans of the region and includes contributions to colonial era music, modern American popular and folk music. The music of Maryland includes a number of popular musicians, folk styles and a documented music history that dates to the colonial archives on music from Annapolis, an important source <b>in</b> <b>research</b> <b>on</b> colonial music.

25|$|Quasi-experimental design refers {{especially}} to situations precluding random assignment to different conditions. Researchers can use {{common sense to}} consider how much the nonrandom assignment threatens the study's validity. For example, <b>in</b> <b>research</b> <b>on</b> {{the best way to}} affect reading achievement in the first three grades of school, school administrators may not permit educational psychologists to randomly assign children to phonics and whole language classrooms, in which case the psychologists must work with preexisting classroom assignments. Psychologists will compare the achievement of children attending phonics and whole language classes.|$|E
