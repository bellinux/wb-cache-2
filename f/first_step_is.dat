5|$|General {{relativity}} can {{be understood}} by examining its similarities with and departures from classical physics. The <b>first</b> <b>step</b> <b>is</b> the realization that classical mechanics and Newton's law of gravity admit a geometric description. The combination of this description with the laws of special relativity results in a heuristic derivation of general relativity.|$|E
5|$|The <b>first</b> <b>step</b> <b>is</b> to mark two {{arbitrary}} {{points of}} the plane (which will eventually become vertices of the triangle), and use the compass to draw a circle centered {{at one of the}} marked points, through the other marked point. Next, one draws a second circle, of the same radius, centered at the other marked point and passing through the first marked point.|$|E

The mosque's roof goes upwards in five steps, with the dome at the top; the <b>first</b> <b>step</b> <b>is</b> square, while the rest are octagonal. Each part of the roof has slits in it for lighting.|$|E
5|$|A full {{data set}} may consist of {{hundreds}} of separate images taken at different orientations of the crystal. The <b>first</b> <b>step</b> <b>is</b> to merge and scale these various images, that is, to identify which peaks appear in two or more images (merging) and to scale the relative images so {{that they have a}} consistent intensity scale. Optimizing the intensity scale is critical because the relative intensity of the peaks is the key information from which the structure is determined. The repetitive technique of crystallographic data collection and the often high symmetry of crystalline materials cause the diffractometer to record many symmetry-equivalent reflections multiple times. This allows calculating the symmetry-related R-factor, a reliability index based upon how similar are the measured intensities of symmetry-equivalent reflections, thus assessing the quality of the data.|$|E
5|$|For males, {{selection}} of the best breeders is more complex. The <b>first</b> <b>step</b> <b>is</b> weaning, when the morphology of calves and the known qualities of their parents are used to make an initial {{selection of}} animals that receive the qualification Reproductive Hope (in French Reproducteur Espoir, abbreviated to Espoir). Annually in excess of about 700 bull calves are then selected to enter the national evaluation station at , close {{to the city of}} Limoges in central France, just after weaning, when they are about seven months old. At Lanaud the animals are grouped together to compare their performance under identical feeding and environmental conditions to the age of 13–14 months. The differences observed between the animals are then related principally to their genetics, which is of interest to breeders because this is what is transmitted to a bull's progeny.|$|E

25|$|This <b>first</b> <b>step</b> <b>is</b> {{extremely}} slow {{because the}} positron emission of the diproton to deuterium is extremely rare (the {{vast majority of}} the time, the diproton decays back into hydrogen-1 through proton emission). This is because the emission of the positron is brought about by the weak nuclear force, which is immensely weaker than the strong nuclear force and the electromagnetic force.|$|E

25|$|Reaction with {{cysteine}} 822 confers {{a rather}} special property to the covalently inhibited enzyme, namely irreversibility to reducing agents. The likely <b>first</b> <b>step</b> <b>is</b> binding of the prodrug protonated on the pyridine {{of the compound}} with cysteine 813. Then the second proton is added with acid transport by the H+/K+ ATPase, and the compound is activated. Recent data suggest the hydrated sulfenic acid to be the reactive species forming directly from the mono-protonated benzimidazole bound {{on the surface of}} the pump.|$|E
25|$|The body {{responds}} to postoperative wounds {{in the same}} manner as it does to tissue damage acquired in other circumstances. The inflammatory response is designed to create homeostasis. This <b>first</b> <b>step</b> <b>is</b> called the inflammatory stage. The next stage and wound healing is the infiltration of leukocytes and release of cytokines into the tissue. The inflammatory response and the infiltration of leukocytes occur simultaneously. The final stage of postoperative wound healing is called remodeling. Remodeling restores the structure of the tissue and that tissues ability to regain its function.|$|E
25|$|The <b>first</b> <b>step</b> <b>is</b> to {{construct}} {{foundations of the}} large columns that will support the elevated roadway of the YBITS. Above-grade column reinforcing is constructed and enclosed by formwork and concrete is poured. After curing, the formwork is then removed. The {{next step is to}} build the roadway itself. The spans were cast in place, using extensive reinforcing, with post-tensioned cable tendons. The roadways consist of hollow box structures, cast in place in sections using formwork, owing both to the complex shapes involved and the necessity of maintaining traffic flow on adjacent structures during construction.|$|E

25|$|Carbon-carbon bond {{rotation}} {{gives the}} betaine 4, which then forms the oxaphosphetane 5. Elimination gives the desired Z-alkene 7 and triphenylphosphine oxide 6. With simple Wittig reagents, {{the first step}} occurs easily with both aldehydes and ketones, and the decomposition of the betaine (to form 5) is the rate-determining step. However, with stabilised ylides (where R1 stabilises the negative charge) the <b>first</b> <b>step</b> <b>is</b> the slowest step, so the overall rate of alkene formation decreases and a bigger proportion of the alkene product is the E-isomer. This also explains why stabilised reagents fail to react well with sterically hindered ketones.|$|E
25|$|Catalytic partial {{hydrogenation}} necessarily produces trans-fats, {{because of}} the reaction mechanism. In the first reaction step, one hydrogen is added, with the other, coordinatively unsaturated, carbon being attached to the catalyst. The second step is the addition of hydrogen to the remaining carbon, producing a saturated fatty acid. The <b>first</b> <b>step</b> <b>is</b> reversible, such that the hydrogen is readsorbed on the catalyst and the double bond is re-formed. The intermediate with only one hydrogen added contains no double bond and can freely rotate. Thus, the double bond can re-form as either cis or trans, of which trans is favored, regardless the starting material. Complete hydrogenation also hydrogenates any produced trans fats to give saturated fats.|$|E
25|$|Odell's {{sighting}} is of {{especially high}} interest. The description of Odell's sighting {{and the current}} knowledge indicate Mallory's 5-minute surmounting of the Second Step is unlikely. This wall cannot be climbed as fast as described by Odell. Only {{the first and the}} third step can be climbed quickly. Odell said that they were {{at the foot of the}} summit pyramid, which contradicts a location at the First Step, but it is unlikely the pair could have started early enough to reach the Third Step by 12:50nbsp&p.m. Since the <b>First</b> <b>Step</b> <b>is</b> far away from the Third Step, confusing them is also not likely. One suggestion proposes that Odell confused a sighting of birds for climbers, as occurred with Eric Shipton in 1933.|$|E
