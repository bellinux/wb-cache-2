40|$|This paper examines, both {{theoretically}} and experimentally, {{the possibility}} of improving the aerodynamic characteristics of a biplane configuration by adding winglets. Theoretical calculations show good agreement with experiment in predicting inviscid drag due to lift. Theoretical and experimental {{results indicate that the}} addition of winglets to an optimized biplane configuration can increase the ideal efficiency factor by up to 13 percent, as well as increasing the lift-curve slope and maximum lift coefficient. A theoretical analysis comparing the biplane with an optimized winglet to an <b>equivalent</b> <b>monoplane</b> indicates that the biplane has the potential for a 6. 4 -percent increase in L/D(max), and 13 -percent increase in C(L) to the 3 / 2 -power/C(D), the classical endurance parameter...|$|E
40|$|Improving the {{aerodynamic}} {{characteristics of}} an airplane with respect to maximizing lift and minimizing induced and parasite drag are of primary importance in designing lighter, faster, and more efficient aircraft. Previous {{research has shown that}} a properly designed biplane wing system can perform superiorly to an <b>equivalent</b> <b>monoplane</b> system with regard to maximizing the lift-to-drag ratio and efficiency factor. Biplanes offer several potential advantages over equivalent monoplanes, such as a 60 -percent reduction in weight, greater structural integrity, and increased roll response. The purpose of this research is to examine, both theoretically and experimentally, the possibility of further improving the aerodynamic characteristics of the biplanes configuration by adding winglets. Theoretical predictions were carried out utilizing vortex-lattice theory, which is a numerical method based on potential flow theory. Experimental data were obtained by testing a model in the Pennsylvania State University's subsonic wind tunnel at a Reynolds number of 510, 000. The results showed that the addition of winglets improved the performance of the biplane with respect to increasing the lift-curve slope, increasing the maximum lift coefficient, increasing the efficiency factor, and decreasing the induced drag. A listing of the program is included in the Appendix...|$|E

40|$|The overall air vehicle {{performance}} of a multiple lifting surface configuration has been studied with respect to both structural and aerodynamic considerations for a candidate mission {{similar to that of}} the AeroVironment Raven. The configuration studied is a biplane joined at the tips with endplates. More specifically, this study aims to determine if this particular nonplanar wing concept can meet the requirements of the mission for a small Reconnaissance, Surveillance and Target Acquisition UAV. The mission capabilities of small UAVs are constantly growing by implementing recent developments in miniature computers and peripherals, electronic sensors, and optical sensing equipment at affordable cost. The requirements for the mission profile of a small UAV using the aforementioned equipment are defined with an emphasis on the potential advantages that can be offered by the nonplanar concept wing under investigation. A structural analysis using the finite element software ADINA and an aerodynamic analysis based on wind tunnel experimental data and vortex panel code results are performed. The results, compared under varying assumptions specific to an <b>equivalent</b> <b>monoplane</b> and a biplane, suggest potential efficiency gains for the new configuration may be possible using the nonplanar wing configuration under explicit conditions. The results also show structural characteristics and not aerodynamics alone are critical in determining the utility of this nonplanar concept.

40|$|The present work takes origin {{from studies}} {{carried out at}} the Department of Aerospace Engineering of University of Pisa on {{innovative}} aircraft configurations. In 1924 the German scientist and father of modern aerodynamics Prof. Ludwing Prandtl demonstrated {{the existence of a}} wing system producing the minimum induced drag, and he called it Best Wing System (BWS). This wing system is made of four wings connected together at their tips so that it looks like a box in a frontal view. The condition of minimum induced drag found by Prandtl states that the two horizontal wings must have the same lift distribution whereas the vertical wings, or bulkheads, must carry a butterfly shaped lift distribution. The induced drag of this system is the lowest among all possible wings carrying the same total lift with a given wingspan, and the efficiency increases as the vertical gap to wingspan ratio (h b) does. The Prandtlâ€™s calculations were based on an approximated method predicting an induced drag of the BWS as the non-dimensional gap h b! " that is 0. 16 times the reference monoplane induced drag. This is in contradiction with the fact that when the two equally loaded horizontal wings are at infinite distance, they can be treated as isolated, therefore they have half of the induced drag of the <b>equivalent</b> <b>monoplane.</b> In 1999 Prof. Aldo Frediani at University of Pisa gave a new demonstration based on more accurate calculations. He obtained the same results as Prandtl in the range of low values of h b, but now the asymptote is, according with theory, at 0. 5. At the same time, he started the translation into an engineering product of the mathematical intuition of Prandtl and he called this aircraft PrandtlPlane in his honor. The PrandtlPlane is, hence, a new aircraft concept, based on the general aim to reduce induced drag. Besides, this configuration has showed potential benefits in different aircraft categories: from Very Large Aircraft (VLA) to small ULM airplanes. The unconventional nature of this aircraft gives rise to new design challenges mainly {{due to a lack of}} experience and of statistical data; the space of solutions is, therefore, unexplored. For this reason a solution satisfying different conflicting requirements such as wings with the same lift, static stability of flight and trim condition in every point of the flight envelope may be hard to find. The problem of finding the PrandtlPlane wing planform can be formulated in terms of optimization, which is to find the geometric parameters defining the wings such that the drag is minimized and the constraints are satisfied. Constraints involve the equilibrium and the static stability during cruise and landing, maximum speed stall, geometrical constraints, and so on. Boundaries on the variables are defined as well: minimum/maximum swept angles, minimum/maximum dihedral angles, minimum/maximum elevator and flaps deflections, and so on. An overview of the main methods and algorithms for the search of minima of unconstrained and constrained optimization problems is presented. Moreover, an algorithm based on a derivative free method (MADS) for the search of minima of unconstrained problems and its extension to constrained problems are presented. An algorithm for the search of global minima is presented and it is tested on benchmarking problems. Finally, these methods are extensively applied to find solutions of a ULM version of the PrandtlPlane aircraft and a flying model coming from the optimizer is manufactured and tested...|$|E
