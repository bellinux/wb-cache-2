5|$|A {{practical}} {{method was}} {{considered for the}} scene in which Violet Beauregarde turns blue and swells up into a giant 10-foot blueberry. A suit with an air hose was considered at one point for {{the beginnings of the}} swelling scene, before the <b>decision</b> <b>was</b> <b>made</b> to do the entire transformation in CGI. The visual effects house Cinesite was recruited for this assignment. In some shots of AnnaSophia Robb's head, a facial prosthetic was worn {{to give the impression that}} her cheeks had swelled up as well. Because this <b>decision</b> <b>was</b> <b>made</b> late in the film's production, any traces of Violet's blueberry scene were omitted from trailers or promotional material.|$|E
5|$|After {{the death}} of George IV in 1830, a <b>decision</b> <b>was</b> <b>made</b> to close down the Menagerie. In 1831, most of the stock {{was moved to the}} London Zoo which had opened in 1828. The last of the animals left in 1835, {{relocated}} to Regent's Park. This <b>decision</b> <b>was</b> <b>made</b> after an incident, although sources vary as to the specifics: either a lion was accused of biting a soldier, or a sailor, Ensign Seymour, had been bitten by a monkey. The Menagerie buildings were removed in 1852 but the Keeper of the Royal Menagerie was entitled to use the Lion Tower as a house for life. Consequently, even though the animals had long since left the building, the tower was not demolished until {{the death of}} Copps, the last keeper, in 1853.|$|E
5|$|In July 2015, the Football Supporters Federation {{confirmed}} that a 70/30 <b>decision</b> <b>was</b> <b>made</b> {{in favour of}} Hull City A.F.C. not changing their name after an FA vote. Greg Dyke, chairman of the FA, reportedly voted yes to a change.|$|E
30|$|<b>Decision</b> epochs <b>are</b> {{the time}} points {{at which the}} <b>{{decision}}s</b> <b>are</b> <b>made.</b> In the MDP, the <b>decision</b> horizon <b>is</b> divided into M periods by decision epochs. If M <b>is</b> infinite, the <b>decision</b> <b>is</b> <b>made</b> on an infinite horizon. Otherwise, the <b>decision</b> <b>is</b> <b>made</b> on a finite horizon if M is finite. It is generally assumed that <b>decisions</b> <b>are</b> <b>made</b> annually. That <b>is,</b> the <b>decision</b> period <b>is</b> 1  year and the <b>decision</b> epoch <b>is</b> {{the beginning of each}} year. Also, we assume that all maintenance actions are conducted {{at the beginning of each}} year.|$|R

5|$|Although the Skyraider {{was a third}} {{smaller and}} carried a third less bombload, it proved more {{reliable}} in service and easier to fly and land, and Navy pilots preferred it.

5|$|As {{announced}} by Russian Deputy Prime Minister Arkady Dvorkovich on 9 December 2013, Israel is considering starting free trade {{negotiations with the}} Eurasian Economic Union.

50|$|A {{noteworthy}} {{practice of}} Friends {{is that all}} administrative and business <b>decisions</b> must <b>be</b> <b>made</b> in a Meeting for Worship (church services). Thus Monthly Meetings, Area Meetings, Quarterly Meetings, Yearly Meetings and larger gatherings of Friends are all Meetings for Worship. <b>Decisions</b> <b>are</b> <b>made</b> prayerfully. <b>Decisions</b> <b>are</b> <b>made</b> by unanimity. Friends' unanimity {{should not be confused}} with a secular consensus. Friends' unanimity is spirit based and the finding of unanimity emerges from Friends worshiping together (see also Quaker decision-making).|$|R
40|$|There {{has been}} {{concern in the}} {{literature}} about {{the adequacy of the}} traditional model of marketing planning, which focuses on what <b>decisions</b> should <b>be</b> <b>made</b> and not on how to make them. The aim of this article is a new conceptualisation that proposes key management processes about how marketing planning <b>decisions</b> <b>are</b> <b>made</b> in a dynamic context. The motives for this conceptualisation are to contribute to understanding by advancing the traditional model of marketing planning, to stimulate academic and practitioner debate about how marketing planning <b>decisions</b> <b>are</b> <b>made,</b> and to initiate new directions in marketing planning research. Two new competing models of marketing planning are developed, which address key management processes about how marketing planning <b>decisions</b> <b>are</b> <b>made</b> in a dynamic context, and research directions are proposed...|$|R
5|$|At {{the outset}} of the Second World War, due to the {{provisions}} of the Defence Act (1903) which prohibited sending the Militia to fight outside of Australian territory, The <b>decision</b> <b>was</b> <b>made</b> to raise an all volunteer force to serve overseas—initial operations were conceived to be likely in the Middle East, France and later possibly England—while it was decided that the Militia would be used to defend the Australian mainland and to improve Australia's overall level of readiness through the reinstitution of compulsory military service and extended periods of continuous periods of training. During this time the 6th Battalion was called up for a number of periods of continuous service in order to bolster their readiness and undertook garrison duties in Australia. In 1944, however, the <b>decision</b> <b>was</b> <b>made</b> to disband the unit, as the Australian government sought to reallocate resources to the economy and began the demobilisation process early. Later, in January 1945, the battalion's parent unit, the 2nd Brigade was also disbanded.|$|E
5|$|Brown did {{not attend}} the opening {{ceremony}} of the 2008 Summer Olympics on 8 August 2008 in Beijing, and instead attended the closing ceremony on 24 August 2008. Brown had been under intense pressure from human rights campaigners {{to send a message to}} China, concerning the 2008 Tibetan unrest. His decision not to attend the opening ceremony was not an act of protest; the <b>decision</b> <b>was</b> <b>made</b> several weeks in advance of the Games.|$|E
