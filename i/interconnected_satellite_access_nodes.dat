40|$|The {{purpose of}} this {{document}} is to provide applicability of the <b>Access</b> <b>Node</b> Control Mechanism to broadband access based on Passive Optical Networks (PONs). The need for an <b>Access</b> <b>Node</b> Control Mechanism between a Network Access Server (NAS) and an <b>Access</b> <b>Node</b> Complex, composed {{of a combination of}} Optical Line Termination (OLT) and Optical Network Termination (ONT) elements, is described in a multi-service reference architecture in order to perform QoS-related, service-related, and subscriber-related operations. The <b>Access</b> <b>Node</b> Control Mechanism is also extended for interaction between components of the <b>Access</b> <b>Node</b> Complex (OLT and ONT). The <b>Access</b> <b>Node</b> Control Mechanism will ensure that the transmission of information between the NAS and <b>Access</b> <b>Node</b> Complex (ANX) and between the OLT and ONT within an ANX does not need to go through distinct element managers but rather uses direct device-to-device communication and stays on net. This allows for performing access-link-related operations within those network elements to meet performance objectives.

40|$|In this article, a {{radio access}} {{system with a}} self-backhauling {{full-duplex}} <b>access</b> <b>node</b> serving legacy half-duplex mobile devices is studied and analyzed. In particular, {{it is assumed that}} the <b>access</b> <b>node</b> is using the same center frequency for all the transmissions, meaning that also the backhauling is done using the same frequency resources as the uplink and downlink transmissions. It is further assumed that the <b>access</b> <b>node</b> has a massive array to facilitate efficient beamforming and self-interference nulling in its own receiver. As a starting point, the signal model for the considered <b>access</b> <b>node</b> is first derived, including all the transmitted and received signals within the cell. This is then used as a basis for obtaining the sum-rate expressions, which depict the overall rates experienced by the mobile users that are served by the <b>access</b> <b>node.</b> In addition, the data rate for the bi-directional backhaul link is also derived, since the <b>access</b> <b>node</b> must be able to backhaul itself wirelessly. The maximum achievable sum-rate is then determined by numerically solving an optimization problem constructed from the data rate expressions. The full-duplex scheme is also compared to two alternative transmission schemes, which perform all or some of the transmissions in half-duplex mode. The results show that the full-duplex capability of the <b>access</b> <b>node</b> is beneficial for maximizing the sum-rate, meaning that a simple half-duplex transmission scheme is typically not optimal. In particular, the highest sum-rate is usually provided by a relay type solution, where the <b>access</b> <b>node</b> acts as a full-duplex relay between the mobiles and the backhaul node.

Also, each <b>access</b> <b>node</b> has a tunable transmitter to efficiently exploit all data wavelengths for data transmission. The set of data wavelengths is divided into wavelength bands. This allows a flexible node design with a number of parallel tunable receivers per node, each operating in a specific wavelength band and providing limited tuning time. On the one hand, our network strategy confronts more efficiently the scalability and maintenance problems comparatively with most of the access ring protocols. On the other hand, the proposed access algorithm avoids both the data wavelengths and the receiver collisions, improving even more the network utilization.

40|$|In {{this study}} {{we focus on the}} serious {{scalability}} problems that many access protocols for WDM ring networks introduce due to the use of a dedicated wavelength per <b>access</b> <b>node</b> for either transmission or reception. We propose an efficient slotted MAC protocol suitable for WDM ring metropolitan area networks. The proposed network architecture employs a separate wavelength for control information exchange prior to the data packet transmission. Each <b>access</b> <b>node</b> is equipped with a pair of tunable transceivers for data communication and a pair of fixed tuned transceivers for control information exchange. Also, each <b>access</b> <b>node</b> includes a set of fixed delay lines for synchronization reasons; to keep the data packets, while the control information is processed. An efficient access algorithm is applied to avoid both the data wavelengths and the receiver collisions. In our protocol, each <b>access</b> <b>node</b> is capable of transmitting and receiving over any of the data wavelengths, facing the scalability issues. Two different slot reuse schemes are assumed: the source and the destination stripping schemes. For both schemes, performance measures evaluation is provided via an analytic model. The analytical results are validated by a discrete event simulation model that uses Poisson traffic sources. Simulation results show that the proposed protocol manages efficient bandwidth utilization, especially under high load. Also, comparative simulation results prove that our protocol achieves significant performance improvement as compared with other WDMA protocols which restrict transmission over a dedicated data wavelength. Finally, performance measures evaluation is explored for diverse numbers of buffer size, <b>access</b> <b>nodes</b> and data wavelengths. (C) 2008 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved...|$|R

40|$|This article {{deals with}} a Hub Location Problem arising in Telecommunication Network Design. The {{considered}} network presents two different kinds of nodes: <b>access</b> <b>nodes,</b> that represent source and destination of traffic demands but cannot be directly connected, and transit nodes, that have no own traffic demand but collect traffic from <b>access</b> <b>nodes</b> and route it through the network. Transit nodes {{are supposed to be}} fully connected. Given a set of <b>access</b> <b>nodes</b> and a set of potential locations for the transit nodes, the problem is to decide number and positions of the transit nodes to guarantee that all <b>access</b> <b>nodes</b> are allocated to a transit node, satisfying capacity constraints. The goal is to minimize the total cost of the network, which is the sum of connection costs and nodes fixed costs. The problem is a Hub Location Problem, which is known to be NP-hard. A local search approach is proposed, and different metaheuristic algorithms, such as tabu search, iterated local search and random multistart, have been developed, based on such local search.

Assuming that the channel state is stable on a scale of 50 milliseconds [23], and using a frame duration of 2 milliseconds, the mobiles will transmit their control information alternatively on each subcarrier so that the <b>access</b> <b>node</b> may refresh the channel state information once every 25 frames.|$|R
