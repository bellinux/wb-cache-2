The disease is now well established as severe dieback of Fraxinus excelsior and mortality has been observed in the north-east where the pathogen was firstly detected. We worked on the epidemiology of the disease, in particular on pathogenicity and genetic characterization in order to show that H. pseudoalbidus is an invasive pathogen. Our recent researches are focused on environmental factors affecting disease prevalence, impact of the pathogen on host population demography and dispersal ability using real-time PCR assays. From a breeding point of view, INRA aims at exploring the potential for resistance/tolerance in a network of 17 field trials that were installed between 1985 and 2009.

40|$|Reintroductions of {{the boll}} weevil, Anthonomus grandis grandis Boheman, into {{areas of the}} United States {{where it has been}} {{eradicated}} or suppressed are very expensive to mitigate. There is concern that a cotton gin in an eradication zone may serve as a site of boll weevil reintroductions when processing cotton harvested in a neighboring <b>infested</b> <b>zone.</b> Similarly, there is a question whether weevil-free areas can safely import gin products, such as cottonseed and baled lint, from infested areas without risking an introduction. Many countries require fumigation of imported U. S. cotton bales to protect against boll weevil introductions, costing the U. S. cotton industry millions of dollars annually. In previously reported experiments, we quantified the potential for boll weevils to survive passage through precleaning machinery in the gin. In this study, we quantified survival potential of boll weevils passing through the gin stand and segregating into the cottonseed, mote, or lint fractions. We also examined boll weevil survival when passed with ginned lint through a lint cleaner. We present a flow chart of experimentally determined survival potentials of boll weevils passing through the various subprocesses of the gin, from which one can calculate the risk of a live boll weevil reaching any point in the process. Our data show that there is virtually no chance of a boll weevil being segregated alive into the cottonseed or of one surviving in the lint to approach the bale press. Therefore, quarantine or fumigation of cottonseed and cotton bales to guard against boll weevil introductions is unnecessary...|$|E

40|$|Site-specific weed {{management}} requires sensing of {{the actual}} weed infestation levels in agricultural fields to adapt the management accordingly. However, sophisticated sensor systems are not yet in wider practical use, since they are not easily available for the farmers and their handling {{as well as the}} management practice requires additional efforts. A new sensor-based weed detection method is presented in this paper and its applicability to cereal crops is evaluated. An ultrasonic distance sensor for the determination of plant heights was used for weed detection. It was hypothesised that the weed <b>infested</b> <b>zones</b> have a higher amount of biomass than non-infested areas and that this can be determined by plant height measurements. Ultrasonic distance measurements were taken in a winter wheat field infested by grass weeds and broad-leaved weeds. A total of 80 and 40 circular-shaped samples of different weed densities and compositions were assessed at two different dates. The sensor was pointed directly to the ground for height determination. In the following, weeds were counted and then removed from the sample locations. Grass weeds and broad-leaved weeds were separately removed. Differences between weed infested and weed-free measurements were determined. Dry-matter of weeds and crop was assessed and evaluated together with the sensor measurements. RGB images were taken prior and after weed removal to determine the coverage percentages of weeds and crop per sampling point. Image processing steps included EGI (excess green index) computation and thresholding to separate plants and background. The relationship between ultrasonic readings and the corresponding coverage of the crop and weeds were assessed using multiple regression analysis. Results revealed a height difference between infested and non-infested sample locations. Density and biomass of weeds present in the sample influenced the ultrasonic readings. The possibilities of weed group discrimination were assessed by discriminant analysis. The ultrasonic readings permitted the separation between weed <b>infested</b> <b>zones</b> and non-infested areas with up to 92. 8 % of success. This system will potentially reduce the cost of weed detection and offers an opportunity to its use in non-selective methods for weed control...|$|R
40|$|We {{characterized}} {{the level of}} risk of boll weevil, Anthonomus grandis grandis Boheman, reintroduction to an eradication zone posed by dispersal from cotton modules during and after transport to the gin. Mark–release-recapture experiments in August and September in Texas indicated that most weevils disperse rapidly from the module surface, temperature permitting, unless confined under a module tarp, where most died. Nevertheless, 1 – 5 % of released weevils were recovered alive after 24 h {{on the side and}} top surfaces of modules, representing potential dispersants. Mortality of boll weevils caged on the top surface of a module was 95 – 100 % after 1 – 4 d when maximum air temperatures were ≥ 33 °C and 72 – 100 % when minimum temperatures were − 7 °C or lower, but a few survived even after experiencing a minimum daily temperature of − 12 °C. Under warm (daily maximum temperatures ≥ 25 °C) and cold (daily minimum temperatures ≤ 0 °C) weather conditions, survival was higher under the tarp than on the open surface of the module (20 versus 7 % and 42 versus 26 %, respectively), but mortality was 100 % in both locations when temperatures reached 34 °C. Our results indicate that although the threat to an eradication zone posed by boll weevil dispersal from an infested module is very low under most environmental conditions, it is probably greatest when 1) a module is constructed and transported from an <b>infested</b> <b>zone</b> during weather too cool for flight, followed by warm weather favorable for flight at the gin yard; or 2) such a module is transported immediately after construction in moderate-to-warm weather...|$|E
40|$|Solitarious desert locusts, Schistocerca gregaria (Forskål) (Orthoptera: Acrididae), {{inhabit the}} central, arid, and {{semi-arid}} {{parts of the}} species¿ invasion area in Africa, the Middle East, and South-West Asia. Their annual migration circuit takes them downwind to breed sequentially where winter, spring, and summer rains fall. In many years, sparse and erratic seasonal rains support phase change and local outbreaks at only a few sites. Less frequently, seasonal rains are widespread, frequent, heavy, and long lasting, and many contemporaneous outbreaks occur. When such seasonal rains fall sequentially, populations develop into an upsurge and eventually into a plague unless checked by drought, migration to hostile habitats, or effective control. Increases {{in the proportion of}} gregarious populations as the plague develops alter the effectiveness of control. As an upsurge starts, only a minority of locusts is aggregated into treatable targets and spraying them leaves sufficient unsprayed individuals to continue the upsurge. Spraying all individuals scattered within an entire <b>infested</b> <b>zone</b> is arguably both financially and environmentally unacceptable. More of the population gregarizes and forms sprayable targets after each successive season of good rains and successful breeding. Eventually, unless the rains fail, the entire upsurge population becomes aggregated at high densities so that the infested area diminishes and a plague begins. These populations must continue to increase numerically and spread geographically to achieve peak plague levels, a stage last reached in the 1950 s. Effective control, aided by poor rains, accompanied each subsequent late upsurge and early plague stage and all declined rapidly. The control strategy aims to reduce populations to prevent plagues and damage to crops and grazing. Differing opinions on the optimum stage to interrupt pre-plague breeding sequences are reviewed...|$|E
40|$|Following the {{detection}} of a pine wood nematode outbreak, Implementing Decision 2012 / 535 /EU imposes eradication measures {{for at least four}} years, mainly consisting of the establishment of: i) clear-cuts with a radius of 500 m around the infested plants and ii) intensive surveillance within a radius varying from 6 to 20 km around the <b>infested</b> <b>zone.</b> To estimate the effectiveness of these measures, a simulation model was developed and calibrated using experimental data specifying the dispersal capabilities of the insect vector Monochamus galloprovincialis. These data were obtained in the laboratory (on a flight mill) and in natura (mark-and-recapture experiments) {{in the context of the}} Landes de Gascogne forest (David, 2014 and David et al., 2014), one of the forest areas most exposed to the risk of introduction of the pine wood nematode in France. The simulations that were then carried out under different scenarios (preventive or curative) showed that the clear-cuts currently requested by European and French regulations would not be effective in a landscape configuration of continuous plantations of maritime pine. Indeed, with the recommended radius of 500 m, at best 11 % of nematode transmissions by the insect vector would be avoided. Moreover, to obtain a pine wood nematode transmission rate lower than 0. 1 %, it would be necessary to implement clear-cuts with a radius of 15 - 38 km (Anses, 2015). These simulations, carried out in the context of a continuous forest, should however be supplemented by a scenario involving highly fragmented pine forests. In this regard, it would be interesting to include biological data from Spanish forest managers, as they are directly involved in implementing nematode eradication measures in this type of landscape. Alternative management measures to control the spread of the pine wood nematode were also assessed by the Working Group...|$|E

In one experiment, 91 % of the weevils survived to 7 d, whereas under harsher environmental conditions, only 11 % survived that long.

40|$|Theileria parva is the causative {{agent of}} a lethal tick-borne disease of cattle {{occurring}} in eastern, {{central and southern}} Africa. Variations in {{the sensitivity of the}} serological and molecular tests with seasonal vector occurrence and discrepancies between low PCR prevalence and high T. parva vector density are a setback to estimate true prevalences. Therefore, the objectives of the present studies were to evaluate (1) the sensitivity of three serological tests (IFAT, ELISA and SELISA) and one molecular test (PCR) in the diagnosis of chronic T. parva infections in four different agro-ecological zones of Rwanda and (2) the effect of tick challenge and animal's age on the sensitivity of PCR. Blood samples from 635 bovines were collected in four agro-ecological zones of Rwanda. All sera were screened using the IFAT, ELISA, SELISA and PCR. The binary results of the four diagnostic tests were introduced separately for each agro-ecological zone in a Bayesian model to estimate the prevalence of T. parva infections and the sensitivity of the four diagnostic tests. All test specificities were set to 100 %. The estimated T. parva prevalence was much higher (83 - 85 %) than estimations based on single diagnostic tests. The estimated sensitivity of serological tests was relatively constant and ranged from 57 to 75 % in the various areas.

He was {{previously}} Director of Plant Protection for 16 years in Syria, his native country. A new wave of an old menace is threatening Africa. After the drought and the grasshoppers, {{it is now the}} migrating locusts that are invading sub-Saharan Africa and the Maghreb. However, this imminent disaster was predictable and could have been avoided. People more than fate are largely responsible for this 'disaster in the making'. The last major invasion of migratory locusts ended in 1963. Since then, the preventative action plan implemented with the help of FAO enabled crop damage to be kept to a minimum. The swarms of locusts sighted were systematically destroyed by the application of a powerful pesticide, dieldrin. This product is not only very efficient but also inexpensive. In fact, it has a strong residual effect, remaining active more than a month, and the required doses are low: 20 - 30 g of active ingredient per hectare. Applications in bands spaced several hundred metres apart suffice to kill the locusts, particularly their larvae, over vast zones. Dieldrin is certainly very toxic for mammals and birds but the applications are done only in deserted arid regions where locusts are found when they are not migrating. There have been no human deaths attributed to such use of dieldrin since it began to be used 30 years ano. The fact {{is that there is no}} ready alternative to this chemical: studies are under way but no new product will be available for a year or two. However, environmental considerations over the past few years have prompted several countries, such as those in North Africa, to ban its use in agriculture. Not having suffered from locust invasions, the effect of this ban was hardly noticed. Furthermore, the drought between 1983 and 1985 resulted in the lowest recorded levels of locusts in more than 50 years. Since September 1985, however, favourable climatic conditions have facilitated their rapid multiplication along the coasts of the Red Sea. Control programmes have not been able to eliminate these populations entirely because military considerations (notably in Eritrea) meant that not all infested regions could be treated. During the summer of 1986, the locusts continued to reproduce in Sudan and Mauritania. Some control efforts were made but there was little use of dieldrin. The countries concerned mostly used organophosphates supplied by the international community to control the grasshoppers that constituted a serious threat that year. From June to September 1987, the abundant rains that fell in northwest Sudan and northeast Chad favoured a new explosion of this serious pest. In August 1987, the concentration of locusts in northern Chad was the only opportunity to destroy them in order to prevent the looming invasion. Unfortunately, this opportunity was not used. During the meeting of donors and governments in Rome, specialists proposed the elimination of these menacing swarms by applying dieldrin in bands. This operation would have meant 15 days of treatment by a large aircraft at a cost of about half a million dollars. Some donors, such as the USA and several northern European countries, preferred a month-long operation involving several large aircraft and costing about six million dollars [...] . By refusing to sanction the use of dieldrin, they effectively recommended the use of fenitrothion, an insecticide with low persistence that kills only those insects directly sprayed. The <b>infested</b> <b>zones</b> must therefore be treated in their entirety, which requires much larger quantities of insecticide and greater transport facilities. This was a practically impossible task in such vast (500, 000 ha) and isolated areas. The locusts that escaped treatment were thus able to continue their migration towards the west reaching Niger and Mali and, in October, Morocco. These countries were then obliged to organize intensive efforts, costing several million dollars, to stop the locusts from invading their cultivated areas. Algeria was also forced to treat some locusts that arrived in the southern part of its territory. At the same time, other locust swarms formed and invaded Mauritania in the first months of 1988. Land-based control operations were undertaken but it quickly became obvious to FAO (which subsequently advised the Mauritanian government) that only dieldrin treatment in bands over the entire affected region could control the invasion. But as in Chad, Niger, and Mali, the donors persuaded the government not to use dieldrin. When the first rains arrived in March, these locusts migrated from Mauritania towards Morocco and Algeria, which were forced to launch a second control programme. When the rainy season arrives, it will be the sub-Saharan countries that will be next in line. No-one knows yet just where and when this invasion will stop given the great ability of locusts to travel. A new generalized invasion seems imminent and it will only be able to be stopped at prohibitive cost. Furthermore, the application of massive doses of insecticides over inhabited areas which will be needed also poses risks for the environment which are much more dangerous than the proposed use of dieldrin in the desert In fact, whether due to lack of information or understanding, the decision-makers have saved the locusts by refusing to sanction the use of control measures that have previously proven their effectiveness. The situation is now urgent and there is no time left to beat about the bush. Several countries still have dieldrin stocks and the means to apply them. They must be able to do so without being advised otherwise by countries that have nothing to fear from locust invasions There is no time left to mince words: do we have the right to let famine return to these already impoverished regions under the pretext of nature conservation? Is not an ear of corn grown to help feed one's family worth at least as much as a desert thornbush?

A total of 116 cows and heifers (58 N'dama and 58 Bunaji) were used in two separate trials. In the first trial, oestrus was synchronized using a PRID, which was inserted for 12 days; in the second trial, oestrus was synchronized by giving two injections of PGF 2 a 13 days apart. Only animals that did not respond to the first injection were given the second injection. At the end of each treatment period, the animals were observed for oestrus for 7 days and inseminated approximately 12 h following detection of oestrus. Standing to be mounted was the single criterion used to judge an animal to have been in oestrus. PGF 2 a and PRID were both effective in synchronizing oestrus in N'dama and Bunaji cows and heifers. The respective oestrus response rates, pregnancy rate and conception rates for PRID and PGF 2 a were 85. 7 %, 53. 6 % and 62. 5 % for PRID, and 91. 7 %, 68. 3 % and 74. 6 % for PGF 2 a. N'dama cattle showed significantly (p< 0. 05) better oestrus response rate, pregnancy rate and conception rate than Bunaji cattle following both PRID and PGF 2 a treatments. The pregnancy rate and conception rate following PGF 2 a treatment were better (p< 0. 05) than for PRID, although the oestrus response rate did not differ. It is concluded that both PRID and PGF 2 a are effective in synchronizing oestrus in N'dama and Bunaji cattle in the hot humid zone of Nigeria and the fertility to artificial insemination at the synchronized oestrus was normal and acceptable. Thus, PRID and PGF 2 a can effectively be used in intensive breeding programmes for the rapid multiplication and distribution of both cattle breeds, especially the N'dama, which is a unique and beneficial animal genetic resource for the tsetse <b>infested</b> hot humid <b>zone</b> of Nigeria...|$|R

Up the present, {{the works}} of collecting planorbids done in 226 municipalities for the elaboration of the geographical distribution chart in the State of São Paulo (Brazil), showed the presence of two intermediate host species of Schistosoma mansoni: Biomphalaria tenagophila and Biompralaria glabrata. Although the technicians from the Psiculture Stations, have not found snails in the water inside the containers used for the transportation of fishes, the ecological conditions of B. straminea in the latest researches are such as to indicate {{that they have been}} introduced, in our State through fish transportation imported from areas where it occurs, such as the State of Amazonas and Ceará (Brazil). The aim of the importation of these fishes is its adaptation to local waters. The occurrence was noticed in the Psiculture Stations of the towns of Barra Bonita and Americana, and in an aquarium of a private house in the city of São Paulo. This shows the danger that the distribution of fishes represents and the way it is being done. The seriousness of the problem originates not only from the importation of the said species but also from its dissemination in the State, through the redistribution to the private Psiculture Stations. It should be remembered that this dissemination can be also done through rivers in which banks are located tanks for the breeding of fishes as mentioned before.
