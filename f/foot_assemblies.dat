40|$|Motion-analysis and FEA {{can work}} {{together}} {{even though they are}} quite different. Motion-analysis software works with CAD assemblies. It starts by translating assembly mating conditions into corresponding kinematics pairs. It then calculates kinematics and dynamics data of the moving mechanism. Each component in mechanism, if viewed separately, is under balanced set of loads: joint reactions and inertial forces. Such isolated component behaves like structure, i. e. firmly supported object and FEA can deals with it. In short, motion analysis feeds FEA with data necessary to convert mechanism component into a structure- a form digestible to FEA. These two numerical tools are applied on the above-knee prosthesis. The first, prosthesis assembly is made. Mating conditions are translated into kinematics pairs such as sliders, pin joints and fixed joints. Then, motion-analysis of prosthesis mechanism is done under subjected loads. The last, components in the <b>foot</b> <b>assembly</b> are remodeled, analyzed and optimized in FEA software, using reactions and inertial forces obtained from motion analysis...|$|R

40|$|The {{anatomy of}} the middle ear has been studied in nine species of birds, with {{particular}} reference to the structure of the ossicle and its relationship to the tympanic membrane. The morphology of the avian middle ear has been compared to that of the reconstructed human middle ear. Drum to stapes <b>foot</b> plate <b>assemblies</b> created during ossiculoplasty operations differ from the pattern found in the avian middle ear in a number of important respects and this may help to explain why they are often unsuccessful. It is not technically feasible to reproduce the avian middle ear pattern exactly in the human middle ear and developments in reconstructive technique should therefore be directed towards reproducing the three ossicle pattern of the mammalian ear...|$|R

50|$|Heated screw {{systems are}} also an {{indirect}} heated system. Typically {{they use a}} jacketed trough with a double auger that intermeshes. The augers themselves frequently contain passages for the heating medium to increase the heat transfer surface area. Some systems use electric resistance heaters instead of a heat transfer media and may employ a single auger in each housing. The augers can range from 12 to 36 inches in diameter for full scale systems, with lengths up to 20 <b>feet.</b> The auger/trough <b>assemblies</b> can be connected in parallel and/or series to increase throughput. Full scale capabilities up to 4 tons per hour have been demonstrated. This type of system has been most successful treating refinery wastes.|$|R

In an effort to establish a means of reducing the overall energy use throughout the facility this report will evaluate various energy usages throughout the facility. The type of audit performed was a walk-through audit. An initial walk through was performed to document the areas of high-energy consumers. The information compiled during the audit was then analyzed for potential savings and if possible an estimated payback time was calculated. Overall, the report addresses a variety of areas such as lighting, heating, ventilation, air-conditioning, hot water heating, compressors and others in which Company XYZ can save energy and ultimately reduce their energy cost. Some areas may provide minimal savings but others may provide substantial return on investments. 3 Acknowledgements I respectfully acknowledge and am truly thankful to my research advisor Dr. Richard...|$|R
50|$|A {{prosthetist}} is {{a person}} who has been certified to fit prostheses to residual limbs of the upper and lower extremities. The fitting of lower extremity prostheses, for example, involves making a socket that fits the residuum as a first step. The socket is usually manufactured by glass or carbon fiber infused with acrylic resin or from thermoplastics over a positive model of the residuum. The socket is connected to a <b>foot</b> or ankle <b>assembly</b> {{and in the case of}} above knee amputation, an artificial knee. The connecting components are usually an aluminum tube with two part pyramid alignment devises one at each end. One of the devices connects to the ankle and the other one to the socket. They allow the foot to be placed in proper position to support the person's weight with the least possible lateral forces acting through the system. Prostheses are aligned with the client walking, while the prosthetist observes the gait and corrects for any deviations from optimized movement when the leg is in the air and for its position at heel strike and toe off.|$|R
40|$|The major {{component}} of elastic fibres is elastin, formed from its soluble precursor, tropoelastin. The tropoelastin nanostructure is characterised by an N-terminal coil region, hinge region, bridge region and C-terminal <b>foot</b> region. Tropoelastin <b>assembly</b> into elastic fibres consists of distinct stages of tropoelastin synthesis, coacervation and cross-linking into mature fibres. However, the contributions of specific structural regions in tropoelastin to elastic fibre assembly are insufficiently understood. This thesis explores the significance of specific residues/regions in human tropoelastin. Mutant constructs were designed in which the bridge region R 515, the hinge region E 345 /E 414, or the N-terminal D 72 have been inactivated by alanine substitution. Another mutant that contains domain 22, which is typically spliced out in native human tropoelastin, was also produced. Functional impairment of the R 515 A isoform {{has been reported in}} assays modelling each stage of assembly. A system was optimised to define the elastogenic potential of R 515 A. When added to human cells, R 515 A tropoelastin assembled less efficiently into elastic fibres with atypical morphology, which is partially attributed to an altered bridge and C-terminal structure. The E 345 A, E 414 A, E 345 A+E 414 A, D 72 A and EX 22 constructs were extensively characterised via their ability to coacervate, cross-link, interact with cells, and form elastic fibres. All mutant constructs displayed varying degrees of impaired self-assembly. The shapes of the mutant species were further analysed to correlate their functional attributes to structural effects of the mutation/s. All mutants showed conformational changes consistent with biochemical properties and the expected mutation site/s. These results identify {{for the first time the}} role of these regions in maintaining the wild-type structure of human tropoelastin, and the importance of this native structure to normal tropoelastin assembly and function...|$|R
6000|$|Here, Sir, is a {{canonical}} boot of ministerial scripture: {{the general}} epistle to the Americans. What does the gentleman say to it? Here a repeal is promised,--promised without condition,--and while your authority was actually resisted. I pass {{by the public}} promise of a peer relative to the repeal of taxes by this House. I pass {{by the use of}} the king's name in a matter of supply, that sacred and reserved right of the Commons. I conceal the ridiculous figure of Parliament hurling its thunders at the gigantic rebellion of America, and then, five days after, prostrate at the <b>feet</b> of those <b>assemblies</b> we affected to despise,--begging them, by the intervention of our ministerial sureties, to receive our submission, and heartily promising amendment. These might have been serious matters formerly; but we are grown wiser than our fathers. Passing, therefore, from the Constitutional consideration to the mere policy, does not this letter imply that the idea of taxing America for the purpose of revenue is an abominable project, when the ministry suppose none but factious men, and with seditious views, could charge them with it? does not this letter adopt and sanctify the American distinction of taxing for a revenue? does it not formally reject all future taxation on that principle? does it not state the ministerial rejection of such principle of taxation, not as the occasional, but the constant opinion of the king's servants? does it not say, (I care not how consistently,) but does it not say, that their conduct with regard to America has been always governed by this policy? It goes a great deal further. These excellent and trusty servants of the king, justly fearful lest they themselves should have lost all credit with the world, bring out the image of their gracious sovereign from the inmost and most sacred shrine, and they pawn him as a security for their promises:--"His Majesty relies on your prudence and fidelity for such an explanation of his measures." [...] These sentiments of the minister and these measures of his Majesty can only relate to the principle and practice of taxing for a revenue; and accordingly Lord Botetourt, stating it as such, did, with great propriety, and in the exact spirit of his instructions, endeavor to remove the fears of the Virginian assembly lest the sentiments which it seems (unknown to the world) had always been those of the ministers, and by which their conduct in respect to America had been governed, should by some possible revolution, favorable to wicked American taxers, be hereafter counteracted. He addresses them in this manner:-- ...|$|R
40|$|Background Hair cells (HCs) are {{the sensory}} receptors {{in both the}} {{auditory}} and the vestibular organs of the inner ear. Supporting cells (SCs) are non-sensory cells embracing the HCs. Injuries of the HCs by aging, acoustic trauma or ototoxic drugs (mainly aminoglycosides, e. g. gentamicin) and cisplatin, often cause {{permanent impairment of hearing}} and balance. Birds and amphibians can regenerate their auditory and vestibular HCs after injury through proliferation of SCs or direct transdifferentiation of a SC into a HC. For mammals this ability is limited and spontaneous HC regeneration occurs only in the vestibular sensory epithelia. The utricle is one of the five vestibular organs and contributes to our balance by registering linear acceleration and head tilts. The aim of this PhD thesis was to investigate morphological and morphometric events during spontaneous HC regeneration following gentamicin exposure in neonatal rat utricular explants. Methods Long-term organ culture of macula utriculi, which is stable and reproducible for up to 28 days in vitro (DIV), was used in all papers in the thesis. HC damage was induced by gentamicin. On 2 DIV the explanted utricular maculae were divided into two groups, a control group and a gentamicin-exposed group. In the latter group macular explants were exposed to gentamicin for 48 hours during 2 - 3 DIV and then allowed to recover. Morphologic and morphometric evaluations were done from utricles harvested at various time points during 28 DIV. Imaging techniques used were light microscopy, including immunohistochemistry, and transmission electron microscopy. Results In the control group the epithelia were well preserved with a slight decline in HC density after 14 DIV. In the gentamicin-exposed group there was an initial substantial decline in HC density and thereafter the proportion of HCs in relation to SCs increased significantly. Using BrdU as a proliferation marker and myosin 7 a as a HC marker, we found no cells that were double marked. At the ultrastructural level, the apical occlusion of the explanted epithelia was intact in both the control and the gentamicin exposed group during the entire in vitro period. Cells that seemed to be in a transitional state, transforming from SCs into HCs were observed in the gentamicin-exposed group. These cells had cytoplasmic extensions basally i. e. <b>foot</b> processes, an <b>assembly</b> of mitochondria basally in the cell or in these foot processes, and often apical SC extensions covering the HC. HCs classified as transitional cells had an increased number of SC connections to their basal parts compared to mature HCs. Conclusions  In these neonatal rat utricular explants: - The morphological structure of the sensory epithelia was well preserved during long-term culture. - The renewal of hair cells after gentamicin exposure occurred through direct transdifferentiation of supporting cells into hair cells. - There was also a proliferative response by the supporting cells, but this supporting cell proliferation did not contribute to the generation of new hair cells. - Cells in a transitional state, showing a characteristic morphology, were observed during the process of transdifferentiation from supporting cells into hair cells. - The tight junctional seal of the epithelia stayed morphologically intact also after gentamicin exposure. - Gap junctions were observed in between supporting cells but not found in between hair cells and supporting cells or between transitional cells and supporting cells...|$|R
