It is often implicitly assumed {{that there is}} one single way to understand others, whatever the situation or the identity of the person. In contrast, I emphasize the <b>duality</b> <b>of</b> <b>functions</b> of mindreading (social interaction and social observation), as well as the duality of social frames of reference (egocentric and allocentric). I argue in favour of a functional distinction between knowledge-oriented mindreading and interaction oriented mindreading. They both aim at understanding other people's behaviour. But they do so using different strategies. However, to say that mindreading has two functions does not suffice to show that {{there are two kinds of}} mindreading. One and the same ability could accomplish different functions. Unfortunately, there has been almost no experimental data on a possible dissociation between two kinds of mindreading abilities. Nonetheless, I discuss a few results that point towards a dual ability...|$|E
30|$|However, in the 1970 s and 1980 s, {{after the}} launch of a Community {{education}} policy, a <b>duality</b> <b>of</b> <b>functions</b> and resources appeared, along with a notable dispersion of efforts, which persisted until 1989. At {{the end of the}} 1980 s, the pan-European organisation focused on the transformation of its political structures and organs {{as a response to the}} new situation brought about by the fall of the Berlin Wall (1989). The European Cultural Convention had set an exceptional framework for collaboration, as there was no obligation to act with one voice; in contrast, there was the opportunity to debate, collaborate and experiment in multiple ways, without the strain of a binding regulatory framework that required commitment. This soft collaboration favoured consensus and flexible cooperation patterns, as well as the publication of numerous regulatory documents, in the form of resolutions or recommendations, addressed to participants. The significance education had acquired at the COE was reflected in 1989, by stating that education is the second priority for the organisation, after the defence of human rights [2 : 6].|$|E
40|$|The {{discovery}} that the 5 ′AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) serves {{to link the}} tumour suppressors LKB 1 and the tuberous sclerosis complex and functions to slow macromolecular synthesis through attenuation of the mechanistic target of rapamycin complex 1 revealed a role for AMPK in tumour suppression. On the other hand, the well-recognized role of AMPK in maintaining ATP homeostasis, through suppression of anabolism and promotion of catabolism, {{as well as the}} role of AMPK in neutralizing reactive oxygen species, via maintenance of NADPH-dependent reductive capacity, point to tumour-protective roles in the context of metabolic stress, which is a key feature of many solid tumours. A growing number of studies thus suggest a <b>duality</b> <b>of</b> <b>functions</b> for AMPK that are either pro- or anti-cancer, depending upon context. Importantly, AMPK is composed of three subunits, and multiple isoforms exist for all three, allowing for different permutations to assemble and the potential for specific AMPK complexes to regulate distinct cellular processes. Moreover, certain subunits of the AMPK complex are frequently overexpressed in a spectrum of human cancer types, suggesting an outright oncogenic function for specific AMPK complexes. Adding complexity to this picture, the catalytic AMPK alpha subunits belong to a family of 14 kinases that can all be activated by LKB 1 and studies are beginning to reveal a similar duality of roles in cancer for other members of the AMPK-related kinase family...|$|E

40|$|The {{urgency to}} adopt new growth models {{promoting}} the decrease of natural resource consumption, has recently drawn {{the attention of}} researchers and policy makers to soil. This complex resource must be preserved, as it fulfills several ecological and eco-systemic functions and supports human activities. Its <b>duality</b> <b>of</b> <b>functions</b> determines the extreme vulnerability to degradation processes, such as sealing, desertification, loss of biodiversity. This awareness led Europe to approve the Seventh Environmental Action Community Programme (2014), which encourages Member States to adopt a more integrated approach to the transformation of soil, {{as a result of}} impacts that the land take phenomenon can produce on other natural resources and climate change processes (Yuan and Bauer 2007, 377; Wu 2008, 47). According to these brief considerations, strategies and actions aim at ensuring a more sustainable use of soil, reducing land and energy consumption and climate change effects should be promoted. In this perspective, this work describes an initial segment of a wider research oriented to define which actions allow mainly to limit the soil sealing and, at the same time, to reach energy-environmental sustainability goals too, at the urban scale. In detail, the article aims at proposing a first set of parameters measuring the consumption of soil and other urban resources, describing the main characteristics of the physical subsystem and which allows evaluating the efficiency of saving-oriented actions in the next stage of the research. To achieve this aim, a comprehensive critical review of urban sustainability models, reports and composite indicators was done, in order to provide useful insights on the measurement strictness and reliability of the numerous urban sustainability assessment reports and models, almost related to the institutional world rather than to the academic one...|$|E

To {{get the full}} text please contact the other at babiker 69 @hotmail. com•	The author argues that the tribal system (now called native administration) is an entrenched system inherited by many generations since the Arabs entered Sudan in the 13 th century. He argues that subsequent governments and regimes have resorted to native administration. Native administration was given tax levying powers since 1925 and also entrusted with the provision of essential services as {{it was not possible}} at the time for governments to manage a vast country such as Sudan without the support of the tribal Chiefs. The author argues that in his opinion native administration still can play a pivotal role at different levels including local government councils, judiciary, security, and above all, is not a costly system. •	 Native Administration as a Judicial System. The author argues that the 1921 Native Administration Act was issued as a response to Lord Milner report to Mr. Adly Basha in which he strongly recommended the necessity of establishing a native national system with specific powers. In 1922 a report was issued supporting Milner’s recommendations, and as a result, various laws were introduced such as the 1923 Chiefs Act and the 1923 Powers of Chiefs Act. •	Regarding native courts, the author argues that they were established at different levels including courts for Omdas, Nazirs and Sheikhs. Such courts were given powers and jurisdiction according to directives issued by the Chief Justice. In the author's opinion the fact that native administration enjoys both executive and judicial powers does not necessarily means that this <b>duality</b> <b>of</b> <b>functions</b> contradicts the fundamental principle of the separation of powers between the judiciary and the executive branches of government. However, the author argues that judicial guarantees were put in place by the judiciary as decisions taken by native courts were subjected to appeals and judicial review. Furthermore, native administration does not have any legislative powers and its main mandate is to apply customary laws and resolve local disputes. Native administration members are not government employees and technically and legally cannot be regarded as part of the executive. Therefore, giving native administration judicial powers does not violate the principle of separation of powers between the judiciary and the executive branches of government and hence does not affect the independence of the judiciary...|$|E

40|$|The {{ubiquitous}} Ca 2 +-sensing protein calmodulin (CaM) fulfills its numerous signaling functions {{through a}} wide range of modular binding and activation mechanisms. By activating adenylyl cyclases (ACs) 1 and 8, Ca 2 + acting via calmodulin impacts on the signaling of the other major cellular second messenger cAMP. In possessing two CaM-binding domains, a 1 - 5 - 8 - 14 motif at the N terminus and an IQ-like motif (IQlm) at the C terminus, AC 8 offers particularly sophisticated regulatory possibilities. The IQlm has remained unexplored beyond the suggestion that it bound CaM, and the larger C 2 b region of which it is part was involved in the relief of autoinhibition of AC 8. Here we attempt to distinguish the <b>function</b> <b>of</b> individual residues of the IQlm. From a complementary approach of in vitro and cell population AC activity assays, as well as CaM binding, we propose that the IQlm alone, and not the majority of the C 2 b, imparts CaM binding and autoinhibitory <b>functions.</b> Moreover, this <b>duality</b> <b>of</b> <b>function</b> is spatially separated and depends on amino acid side-chain character. Accordingly, residues critical for CaM binding are positively charged and clustered toward the C terminus, and those essential for the maintenance of autoinhibition are hydrophobic and more N-terminal. Secondary structure prediction of the IQlm supports this separation, with an ideally placed break in the α-helical nature of the sequence. We additionally find that the N and C termini of AC 8 interact, which is an association specifically abrogated by fully Ca 2 +-bound, but not Ca 2 +-free, CaM. These data support a sophisticated activation mechanism of AC 8 by CaM, in which the <b>duality</b> <b>of</b> the IQlm <b>function</b> is critical...|$|R

Moreover, Myb plays an activating role in DNA replication in Drosophila egg chamber follicle cells. The essential functions for Myb are executed as part <b>of</b> MMB. This <b>duality</b> <b>of</b> <b>function</b> lead to the hypothesis that MMB, which contains both known activator and repressor proteins, might <b>function</b> as part <b>of</b> a switching mechanism that is dependent on DNA sites and developmental context. Here, we used proliferating Drosophila Kc tissue culture cells to explore both the network of genes regulated by MMB (employing RNA interference and microarray expression analysis) and the genomic locations of MMB following chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) and tiling array analysis. MMB occupied 3538 chromosomal sites and was promoter-proximal to 32 % of Drosophila genes. MMB contains multiple DNA-binding factors, and the data highlighted the combinatorial way by which the complex was targeted and utilized for regulation.

40|$|It {{is clear}} that sub-clinical {{inflammation}} is a key factor that triggers type 2 diabetes mellitus (T 2 DM) and is directly influenced by weight gain. Current studies highlight that obesity, particularly central obesity, heightens the pathogenesis of T 2 DM. Additionally, factors produced by adipose tissue (AT), referred to as adipocytokines, can influence the degree of insulin resistance as well as inflammation, due to their <b>duality</b> <b>of</b> <b>function.</b> A recently implicated adipocytokine, visfatin, {{has been identified as}} a potential insulin mimetic, an enzyme associated with mitochondrial biogenesis and an inflammatory factor. However, current studies lack a clear understanding as to the role and influence of visfatin in human AT and insulin resistant states. Therefore, this thesis examined visfatin expression within specific human AT depots and the influence of adiposity - with specific consideration given to insulin resistant states including T 2 DM, non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). Further, serum studies addressed how different insulin resistant states influenced circulating visfatin levels, whilst mechanistic studies explored how the role of visfatin was altered by insulin, an insulin sensitiser, inflammation and/or disease. This current thesis identified that visfatin was abundant in both abdominal depots, with highest expression in the omental (Om) AT, and isolated adipocytes, with an apparent relationship with insulin resistance. Subsequent in vivo and in vitro analysis further identified that, whilst insulin appeared to increase visfatin protein expression in isolated abdominal subcutaneous (Abd Sc) adipocytes, the use of an insulin sensitiser - either used in cultured Abd Sc adipocytes or as part of an oral therapeutic treatment in subjects with T 2 DM - decreased circulating visfatin levels. In addition, intracellular signalling studies highlighted that visfatin regulation within AT appeared to be dependent upon both nuclear factor (NF) -B and c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) activation, influencing interleukin (IL) - 6 as part of a visfatin regulatory feedback mechanism. Following the potential influence of visfatin in T 2 DM, this thesis explored its’ potential role in disease associated with other insulin resistant phenotypes, such as liver disease and HIV. From serum assessment of visfatin in subjects with NAFLD, it was identified that progression of liver disease was accompanied by a reduction in circulating visfatin levels – a finding that occurred independently of diabetic status. However, circulating visfatin still remained significantly higher in NAFLD with T 2 DM than those without. Finally, this thesis examined a potentially severe insulin resistant phenotype noted in HIV patients, due to an apparent lipodystrophy - a condition which alters fat oxidation and mitochondrial activation or regulation. In such a condition, circulating visfatin levels and visfatin mRNA AT expression remained unaltered by HIV status or drug therapy. Due to the capacity of visfatin to act as an enzyme involved in nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD) biosynthesis, essential for mitochondrial function and oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS), its role in AT remained unchanged by disease status, whilst other mitochondrial and fat metabolism factors were altered by both disease state and drug treatment. Taken together, these current data suggest a <b>duality</b> <b>of</b> <b>function</b> <b>of</b> which visfatin appears to be regulated by insulin, in addition to inflammation, in different disease states and therefore expands our current understanding of this multi-functional adipocytokine.

We further show that casein kinase le also inhibited Axin-mediated JNK activation by competing against MEKK 1 binding. In contrast,. beta -catenin and adenomatous polyposis coli binding did not affect MEKK 1 binding to the same Axin complex. This suggests that even when Axin is "switched" to activate the JNK pathway, it is still capable of sequestering free beta -catenin, which is a critical aspect for cellular homeostasis.
