In 1891, he {{suffered}} a fall and an <b>internal</b> <b>injury.</b> He survived the consequential surgery only a few days. His wealth at death was £27,713. Airy {{and his wife and}} three pre-deceased children are buried at St. Mary's Church in Playford, Suffolk. A cottage owned by Airy still stands, adjacent to the church and now in private hands.|$|E
25|$|The Monaco Grand Prix saw a {{spectacular}} incident when Ascari and his Lancia {{crashed into the}} harbour after missing a chicane. Ascari was {{pulled out of the}} water alive and apparently well. However, there was speculation over an undetected <b>internal</b> <b>injury</b> when four days later Ascari was killed at Monza while testing a sportscar. After Ascari's death, Lancia followed Mercedes out of the category, passing their engines, cars, information and technology to Ferrari.|$|E
25|$|As {{a result}} of a rib injury {{obtained}} {{during the course of the}} Test (and determined to be an <b>internal</b> <b>injury</b> rather than an external one) the Pakistan Captain, Inzamam-ul-Haq, was unable to bat for 4h20m in the Pakistan 2nd innings, or until the fall of the 5th wicket (whichever came first). As England took five wickets in the first session of the last day, he was able to come in at number 7 in the order. His wicket was eventually the last to fall, being stumped off the bowling of Monty Panesar, and Pakistan were all out for 155.|$|E

25|$|The next is the “low flight with {{sustained}} grip attack”, {{which is}} used for hunting ungulates. Here, the golden eagle flies over a herd of ungulates which in turn often huddle or break into a run. The eagle then selects it prey (typically young animals, though sometimes infirm or exceptionally healthy grown animals) and lands on prey's back or neck, talons gripping firmly, attempting to pierce vital organs or cause shock via a crushing grip to bone and cartilage. The hunting eagle typically rides its prey for several minutes with wings outstretched and flapping to maintain balance until the prey collapses, either as result of exhaustion, shock or <b>internal</b> <b>injury.</b>|$|E
500|$|Twelve {{days after}} {{the opening of the}} L, Liverpool surgeon Thomas Weatherill wrote to The Lancet {{questioning}} the official version of Huskisson's death and calling the behaviour of the doctors who had attended Eccles vicarage [...] "unscientific, inefficient and imbecilic". He had spoken to eyewitnesses, and concluded that Huskisson's weakness and spasms following the accident were caused by blood loss, not <b>internal</b> <b>injury,</b> and that amputation would have stemmed the blood loss and saved Huskisson's life. He went on to claim that those eyewitnesses he had spoken to had seen Huskisson bleeding heavily, but that no effort had been made to stem the bleeding other than Lord Wilton's makeshift tourniquet of handkerchiefs. He argued that those doctors attending should at least have made an attempt at amputation {{when it became clear that}} other measures were not working.|$|E
500|$|Sir Francis Dashwood built West Wycombe to entertain, {{and there}} has been much {{speculation}} on the kind of entertainment he provided for his guests. Judged against the sexual morals of the late 18th century, Dashwood and his clique were regarded as promiscuous; while {{it is likely that the}} contemporary reports of the bacchanalian orgies over which Dashwood presided in the Hellfire caves above West Wycombe were exaggerated, free love and heavy drinking did take place there. Dashwood often had himself depicted in portraits in fancy dress (in one, dressed as St Francis of Assisi toasting a statue of Venus), and it is his love of fancy dress which seems to have pervaded through to his parties at West Wycombe Park. Following the dedication of the West portico as the temple of Bacchus in 1771, Dashwood and his friends dressed in skins adorned with vine leaves and went to party by the lake for [...] "Paeans and libations". On another occasion, during a mock sea battle on the canal, the captain of the snow, [...] "attacking" [...] a battery constructed on the bank, was struck by the wadding of a gun and suffered an <b>internal</b> <b>injury.</b> Dashwood later devoted more of his time to political reform and to charitable works; he had an active political career all of his adult life; a serious occupation belied by his reputation for revelry. He died in 1781, bequeathing West Wycombe to his half-brother Sir John Dashwood-King, 3rd Baronet.|$|E

2500|$|After {{the poor}} tour of Australia the {{previous}} year a revamped England team {{was taken to the}} Caribbean under the management of the forthright Walter Robins. Cowdrey was roped in to open the innings with Geoff Pullar as May thought he was the best player of fast bowling. Even though it was not to Cowdrey's liking he made 491 runs (54.55) and two centuries. England won the Second Test by 256 runs despite play being held up by a riot, but May suffered an <b>internal</b> <b>injury</b> and had to go to hospital every morning before play. May soldiered on, but Cowdrey knew he would soon be in charge and was so affected by nerves before the Third Test that he [...] "would have given anything not to have played". To face the fast bowlers he wore rubber padding sewn into his shirt and recovered to make 114 and 97 despite Wes Hall taking 7/69 in England's first innings of 277, no one else making over 30. May had to fly home for treatment (and was unfit to play for 18 months) so Cowdrey took charge in the Fourth Test, winning the toss and top scoring with 65 in England's 295 as Hall took 6/90. The West Indies overtook this with 402, but Ted Dexter (110) and Raman Subba Row (100) saved the match. In the Fifth Test Brian Statham flew home to his sick son, but Cowdrey won the toss and again chose to bat, top scoring with 119 in England's 393.|$|E

60|$|Thus adjured, {{with his}} eyes fixed on Key, Collinson narrated his story from the {{irruption}} of the outlaws to the final catastrophe. Even then he palliated their outrage with his characteristic patience, keeping still his strange fascination for Chivers, and his blind belief in his miserable wife. The story was at times broken by lapses of faintness, by a singular return of his old abstraction and forgetfulness {{in the midst of a}} sentence, and at last by a fit of coughing that left a few crimson bubbles on the corners of his month. Key lifted his eyes anxiously; there was some grave <b>internal</b> <b>injury,</b> which the dying man's resolute patience had suppressed. Yet, at the sound of Alice's returning step, Collinson's eyes brightened, apparently as much at her coming as from the effect of the powerful stimulant Key had taken from his medicine case.|$|E
