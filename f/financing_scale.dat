The results show that the growth of energy industry investment scale can improve the energy industry scale growth, but the effect for increasing its profitability is not significant,which indicates that investment efficiency is not obvious. And the effect of different financing structure on output growth and profit contribution is significant. As a result, the investment efficiency and financing structure of energy industry needs to be improved...|$|E
40|$|Background: Over {{the last}} twenty years, despite {{unprecedented}} new resources to global health, there has been insufficient progress to achieve the health-related 2015 Millennium Development Goals. Health systems have been perceived as the binding constraint. Major global health agencies have expanded their funding priorities from disease specific programs to include support for health systems strengthening. Strengthening health systems broadly is beyond the mandate of {{agencies such as the}} Global Fund. Nonetheless, since its inception, the Global Fund has supported health systems; however, it has had a long-running organizational struggle with how to do it. Mechanisms for health systems support have varied, and proposals for health systems support consistently have been of a lower quality than disease proposals. The Technical Review Panel of the Fund has criticized it for lack of clarity about what it means by health systems strengthening and called into question the Fund's ability to support effective responses to health systems constraints. Purpose: The purpose of this dissertation is to present a case study of the Global Fund's policies and strategy on health systems strengthening using the lens of neo-institutional theory. This dissertation explores the role legitimacy and the cognitive beliefs about health systems strengthening held by stakeholders in the Global Fund's environment have played in shaping the Fund's policies on health systems strengthening. Methods: Qualitative research methods are used to examine the beliefs about health systems strengthening held by members of Board delegations and the role these beliefs played in shaping the Global Fund's strategy on health systems strengthening. Official Global Fund documents were reviewed and primary data was gathered through 31 semi-structured in-depth interviews with members of the Board delegations, Secretariat, Technical Partner organizations and other relevant stakeholders in the Global Fund's environment to complement the document review. Findings: (1) Health system strengthening is a vague concept. (2) Depending on the context, there are two meanings - a technical one and a political one. (3) There is dispute over what constitutes acceptable health systems strengthening work. (4) Health system strengthening is essential for the success of the Global Fund, but there is disagreement over whether the Global Fund should engage in health system strengthening; if it does, how, and to what extent. (5) Linking funding to measurable health outcomes is essential for legitimacy. Health systems strengthening {{is beyond the scope of}} the Fund's mandate, current technical capacity and organizational design. The Fund ought to focus on what it does well, which is <b>financing</b> <b>scale</b> up of essential inputs. The Health Systems Funding Platform provides an opportunity for the Fund to support public health system strengthening in a way that will appease key stakeholders but still allow it to stay within the bounds of its disease-specific mission...|$|E

40|$|AbstractThe {{purpose of}} this paper is to investigates whether the large {{shareholders}} of small and medium firms (SMEs) take advantage of the inside information and decrease their shares before their operation performance begins to decline after the Initial Public Offerings (IPOs). By using the data from annual reports of SMEs listed on Shenzhen Stock Exchange in China from 2004 to 2006, this study explores both the relationship and the interaction effects between the change of operation performance and the ownership concentration of SMEs around their IPOs. The statistic analysis indicates that there is a significantly positive relationship between the ownership concentration and their operation performance after IPOs during the sample period. Moreover, the companies with higher ownership decreasing encounter more severe operation performance decline, which sugests that the listed companies intend to package their book profits before IPOs for the sake of increasing their issuing prices and enlarge their <b>financing</b> <b>scales...</b>|$|R

40|$|Introduction: Impulsivity and {{risk-taking}} behaviours {{are reported}} in bipolar disorder (BD). We examined whether financial management skills are related to impulsivity in patients with BD. Methods: We assessed financial management skills using the Executive Personal <b>Finance</b> <b>Scale</b> (EPFS), impulsivity using the Barratt Impulsiveness Scale (BIS) and response inhibition using an emotional go/no-go task in bipolar individuals (N = 21) and healthy controls (HC; N = 23). Results: Patients had fewer financial management skills {{and higher levels of}} impulsivity than HC. In patients and controls, increased impulsivity was associated with poorer personal financial management. Patients and HC performed equally on the emotional go/no-go task. Higher BIS scores were associated with faster reaction times in HC. In patients, however, higher BIS scores were associated with slower reaction times, possibly indicating compensatory cognitive strategies to counter increased impulsivity. Conclusions: Patients with BD may have reduced abilities to manage personal finances, when compared against healthy participants. Difficulty with personal finance management may arise in part as a result of increased levels of impulsivity. Patients may learn to compensate for increased impulsivity by modulating response times in our experimental situations although whether such compensatory strategies generalize to real-world situations is unknown...|$|R

A man with a mindset of poverty, wakes and laments, he says: O Lord, it is another morning, can I continue this way? Why the lamentation when there is the entrepreneurship option? Entrepreneurship is the process through which new organizations come into existence. It is a human creative action that breeds something of value from practically nothing. An entrepreneur searchers for and discovers new information, translates it into new markets, techniques and goods. He discovers economic opportunity and marshal the financial resources needed for the enterprise. The challenges that face entrepreneurs in Nigeria include harsh or unfriendly economy, dynamics of the industry, lack of start-up capital-, staff recruitment and unfriendly government policies among others. The vitally needed ingredients for success in business include starting on a small scale, maintaining a good cash flow, relying mostly on oneself and strategically positioning your business and yourself.
