5|$|Beginning in November 1895, {{artist and}} author Alfred Lambourne {{spent a year}} living on the remote Gunnison Island, where {{he wrote a book}} of musing and poetry, Our Inland Sea. From November 1895 to March 1896, <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>alone.</b> In March, a few guano sifters arrived to harvest and sell the guano of the nesting birds as fertilizer. Lambourne {{included}} musings about these guano sifters in his work. Lambourne left the island early in the winter of 1896 along with the first group of guano sifters.|$|E
5|$|On a whim, Zoe Barnes (Kate Mara), a young {{reporter}} for the Washington Herald who is stuck covering trivial “human interest” stories, pays a late-night visit to Frank at his home. She offers to be Frank’s undercover mouthpiece in the press {{in exchange for the}} elevated profile that she would gain from breaking substantive stories. Meanwhile, Peter Russo (Corey Stoll), a young, inexperienced congressman from Philadelphia, is arrested for drunk driving. Stamper finds out about the arrest and immediately contacts the D.C. police commissioner, offering Underwood’s support for his mayoral campaign in exchange for releasing Russo and completely covering up the incident. Russo is picked up from jail by his secretary and romantic partner, Christina Gallagher (Kristen Connolly). He lies to her, telling her that <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>alone</b> when he was arrested when, in fact, there was a prostitute (Rachel Brosnahan) in the car.|$|E
25|$|Nevertheless, Hubert Walter, Archbishop of Canterbury, {{decided that}} Fitz Osbert {{had to be}} stopped. He sent two accomplices to capture Fitz Osbert when <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>alone</b> and not {{surrounded}} by his mob. In the melee that followed one of the accomplices was killed and Osbert escaped with a few followers to take refuge in the nearby church of St Mary le Bow, intending not to seek sanctuary but to defend it as a fortress.|$|E

25|$|Around {{the same}} time, Regina conjures up a potion with Arthur watching, {{telling her that}} David {{explained}} everything, then Regina gave Arthur the mushroom. Arthur hesitates and says its best to do it alone, and adds that Merlin only delivered prophecies when <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>alone</b> with him. David then tells everyone to step aside so he can be alone, but after Arthur tosses the Crown into the fire instead the cauldron, he tells them the spell did not work.|$|E
25|$|Having {{temporarily}} {{disposed of}} Hiller, Napoleon turned north with his main army against Archduke Charles. On 22 and 23 April, the Franco-Germans defeated Charles' army and forced it to withdraw {{to the north}} bank of the Danube. Meanwhile, Napoleon sent Bessières to pursue the Austrian left wing with minor forces. Not knowing that Charles had been defeated, Hiller turned back upon his pursuer, defeating Bessières near Neumarkt-Sankt Veit. Once he found that <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>alone</b> on the south bank facing Napoleon's main army, Hiller retreated rapidly to the east {{in the direction of}} Vienna.|$|E
25|$|The 1650s {{took their}} toll on Milton, and he was already in a declining state, {{beginning}} with his wife dying during {{the birth of their}} third daughter and their son dying later in that year. As the years progressed, his blindness overtook him and <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>alone.</b> Matters were further complicated for Milton by the death of Cromwell in 1658 {{and the end of the}} English Commonwealth. The work was a final plea to try to stop the restoration of a monarchy while Milton promoted the establishment of a Republic. However, this resulted only in his being ignored and mocked.|$|E

25|$|When Laurence Olivier {{gave his}} {{acclaimed}} performance of Othello at the Royal National Theatre (UK) in 1964, {{he had developed}} a case of stage fright that was so profound that when <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>alone</b> onstage, Frank Finlay (who was playing Iago) would have to stand offstage where Olivier could see him to settle his nerves. This performance was recorded complete on LP, and filmed by popular demand in 1965 (according to a biography of Olivier, tickets for the stage production were notoriously hard to get). The film version still holds {{the record for the}} most Oscar nominations for acting ever given to a Shakespeare film — Olivier, Finlay, Maggie Smith (as Desdemona) and Joyce Redman (as Emilia, Iago's wife) were all nominated for Academy Awards.|$|E
25|$|The 10-year-old Kampusch {{left her}} family's {{residence}} in Vienna's Donaustadt district {{on the morning}} of 2 March 1998, but failed to arrive at school or come home. A 12-year-old witness reported having seen her being dragged into a white minibus by two men, although Kampusch did not report a second man being present. A massive police effort followed in which 776 minivans were examined, including that of her kidnapper, Přiklopil, who lived about half an hour from Vienna by car in the Lower Austrian town of Strasshof an der Nordbahn, near Gänserndorf. Although he stated that {{on the morning of}} the kidnapping <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>alone</b> at home, the police were satisfied with his explanation that he was using the minibus to transport rubble from the construction of his home.|$|E
25|$|Simpson's initial {{claim that}} he was asleep {{at the time of}} the murders was refuted by several {{different}} accounts. According to defense lawyer Johnnie Cochran, Simpson had never left his house that night, and <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>alone</b> as he packed his belongings to travel to Chicago. Cochran claimed that Simpson went outside through the back door to hit a few golf balls into the children's sandbox in the front garden, one or more of which made the three loud thumps on the wall of Kaelin's bungalow. Cochran produced a potential alibi witness, Rosa Lopez, a neighbor's Spanish-speaking housekeeper who testified that she had seen Simpson's car parked outside his house {{at the time of the}} murders. But Lopez's testimony, which was not presented to the jury, was pulled apart under intense cross-examination by Clark, when Lopez was forced to admit that she could not be sure of the precise time she saw Simpson's white Bronco outside his house.|$|E

25|$|Major Remington then {{ordered his}} squad {{to charge the}} Confederate force, which Dagwell had just told him must be an entire brigade of Confederate cavalry and had {{correctly}} estimated as being a minimum of 2,000 men. The advance Confederates broke {{into the woods and}} Dagwell followed, only to soon find that <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>alone.</b> When he came out to the point the New Yorkers had formed their line, he found only five Union men but also saw several dead and wounded Confederates, including a dead Confederate major beside the road. Major John H. Whitaker, commander of the 1st North Carolina Cavalry was killed during the action. Sergeant Charles A. Hartwell stated that the New Yorkers killed 5 Confederates and took 14 prisoners in the initial action. Hartwell soon found himself with about a dozen men, including Major Remington, cut off from the other Union troops. Remington and a few others, including Sergeant H. O. Morris, in the face of overwhelming numbers, had retreated from the nearby hill to which Remington had moved most of the men after their initial charge. When he saw the Union movement, Hampton thought they were trying to position themselves to attack the rear of his force and sent a squadron to outflank them, virtually surrounding the majority of the Union men. Sergeant Morris shot a Confederate officer who assaulted Major Remington during the melee that ensued during the fight for escape of the New Yorkers not trapped on the hill.|$|E
500|$|A plot {{to kidnap}} Douglas-Home in April 1964 was foiled by the Prime Minister himself. Two left-wing {{students}} from the University of Aberdeen {{followed him to the}} house of John and Priscilla Buchan, where he was staying. <b>He</b> <b>was</b> <b>alone</b> at the time and answered the door, where the students told him that they planned to kidnap him. He responded, [...] "I suppose you realise if you do, the Conservatives will win the election by 200 or 300." [...] He gave his intending abductors some beer, and they abandoned their plot.|$|E
500|$|A {{man named}} Vukota said these words to Bishop Danilo, {{one of the}} main {{characters}} of The Mountain Wreath, who previously uttered a piercing vision speaking as if <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>alone.</b> The second and the third verses can be compared with an idiomatic expression whose literal sense is [...] "to dash into a frenzied countenance", meaning [...] "to fall into a frenzied or crazed exaltation". Vukota compared Bishop Danilo's exaltation with that of a witch or a vjedogonja when their spirit flew out of their body. It was thought that the witches held an assembly each year on 1 March, and the vjedogonje mostly flew during the long autumn nights, especially when strong winds blew. After Vukota's words, Bishop Danilo started as if from a dream.|$|E

500|$|In August 1911 Mohun {{returned}} to his home at Royal Oak, Maryland to recover from wounds he had received during his twenty years service in Africa. [...] His convalescence included a period spent in the Virginia mountains. [...] He served as on officer on an American Red Cross ship sent to Belgium {{during the first year}} of World War One. [...] Aged 50 and without any prior signs of illness, he died of a fever on July 13, 1915. [...] Although <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>alone</b> when he fell ill at two o'clock in the morning a non-Catholic woman made a [...] journey to fetch a priest to conduct the Last Rites. [...] Mohun's funeral service was held at the Cathedral of St. Matthew the Apostle and he was interred in the family plot at Oak Hill Cemetery. [...] During his postings in Africa he had {{returned to}} the USA only three times.|$|E
500|$|While Lennon was [...] "evangelical in {{his enthusiasm}} for the Maharishi", {{according}} to his wife, Cynthia, she herself was [...] "a little more sceptical". [...] Cynthia later wrote that she [...] "loved being in India" [...] and had hoped she and Lennon would [...] "rediscover our lost closeness"; to her disappointment, however, Lennon became [...] "increasingly cold and aloof". The Lennons' room contained a [...] "four-poster bed, a dressing table, a couple of chairs and an electric fire". Lennon played guitar, while his wife drew pictures and wrote poetry between their long meditation sessions. After two weeks Lennon asked {{to sleep in a}} separate room, saying he could only meditate when <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>alone.</b> Meanwhile, he walked to the local post office every morning to check for Ono's almost daily telegrams. One of these telegrams read: [...] "Look up at the sky and when you see a cloud think of me".|$|E
500|$|... "Magic Alex" [...] (Greek-born Alex Mardas, who {{controlled}} Apple Electronics) arrived later, smuggling in alcohol {{from the nearest}} village as it was not allowed in the ashram. After two weeks Lennon asked {{to sleep in a}} separate room, saying he could only meditate when <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>alone,</b> but walked down to the local post office every morning to see if he had received a telegram from Ono, who sent one almost daily. Cynthia found out about these secretive trips much later, saying: [...] "I had thought our magical interlude with the Maharishi would be the making of our marriage – but in reality it just presaged the end". Paul Saltzman later published a book of photographs, The Beatles in Rishikesh, showing Lennon deep in thought, and Cynthia's confused expression. Despite the alienation from Lennon, she later spoke about her time there, saying: [...] "I loved being away from the fans, hordes of people, deadlines, demands and flashing cameras".|$|E

500|$|Credited {{with one}} more victory during August 1917, and another four the {{following}} month, Pentland's score stood at ten {{when he was}} injured on 26September after an artillery shell struck his SPAD and forced him to crash land. Following his recovery, he again spent time instructing before being posted back to a front-line unit, this time No.87 Squadron, operating Sopwith Dolphins. Promoted captain, he returned to France in April 1918, having transferred the same month {{with the rest of}} the RFC to the newly formed Royal Air Force (RAF). Pentland went on to achieve thirteen victories with No.87 Squadron, where his aggressive tactics saw him dubbed the [...] "Wild Australian" [...] by colleagues. Appointed commander of 'B' Flight, he also frequently acted as a [...] "lone wolf", actively seeking dogfights with enemy aircraft on his own. On 18June, <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>alone</b> on patrol when he engaged a flight of four Rumpler high-altitude reconnaissance aircraft, forcing down three of them.

500|$|However, {{this was}} a step too far toward treason for {{some members of the}} cabildo whom Mompó had assumed would have been compliant. [...] The new mayor of Asunción, José Luis Barreyro (Bareiro), built his own power base in Asunción as the comuneros {{splintered}} and factionalized. [...] Mompó's faction of the comuneros controlled the rural areas, and Barreyro's faction saw him as a threat. [...] Barreyo arranged the quiet arrest of Mompó while <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>alone</b> and sent him to the Jesuits, from whom he eventually found his way to a jail in Buenos Aires. [...] Mompó would soon escape prison again, but rather than return to Paraguay he fled to Brazil. [...] Barreyro's victory was short-lived; while Mompó's faction of the comuneros were thrown into confusion for several months, they eventually rallied, and he found few Asunción militia members willing to fight against them. [...] Barreyro and his supporters were forced to flee to the Jesuit missions, and the more radical comuneros once again ruled both Asunción and the rural areas.|$|E
500|$|Evans lacked {{patience}} however, and {{coupled with}} a prickly disposition, was prone to display frustration and bewilderment towards {{those who could not}} immediately see the value of his ideas. His ideas and designs were often far ahead of their time, and the idea of a fully automated production process was difficult for contemporaries to comprehend. Evans recalled when some Brandywine millers happened to visit the Red Clay Creek mill {{in the early years of}} its operation after it was fully automated. <b>He</b> <b>was</b> <b>alone</b> at the mill that day and making hay in a nearby field, and purposely stayed out of sight so his visitors could observe the mill running independently without human supervision. Evans then appeared and at great length explained how the feat they witnessed was possible, and was convinced that the chance visit would bring about a breakthrough with the Brandywine millers. However, he was frustrated at reports that the millers returned to Wilmington and reported that the Evans mill was [...] "a set of rattletraps, unworthy the notice of any man of sense". Disinterest continued even after Evans convinced a Brandywine miller to have his mill converted.|$|E
