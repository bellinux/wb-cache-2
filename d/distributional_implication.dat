The agents are subject to idiosyncratic shocks and face borrowing constraints. We confine attention to an interior Markov recursive equilibrium. The consequence of quasi-geometric discounting is that the effective discount factor of an agent is not a constant, but an endogenous variable which depends on the agent's current state. We show, both analytically and by simulation, that this new feature can significantly affect the <b>distributional</b> <b>implications</b> of the neoclassical growth model. ...|$|R

40|$|We {{present a}} simple three-class {{model in the}} Kaleckian {{tradition}} to investigate the implications of a dominant managerial class class for the dynamics of demand and distribution. Managers are hired by capitalists to supervise workers, but supervision results in surplus extraction and wage inequality. The adjustment of capacity utilization to accommodate goods market disequilibrium produces two distinct regimes {{with respect to the}} responsiveness of investment demand to profitability: a low investment–response regime, where effective demand is both wage–led and inequality–led; and a high investment–response regime, where demand is profit–led. In accordance with recent empirical evidence for the US, we then introduce distributive dynamics that hinge on inequality squeezing workers’ wage growth. We find that the low investment–responsiveness regime produces a stable demand–distribution equilibrium only if the wage squeeze effect is relatively small. On the other hand, an equilibrium in the high investment–response regime is saddle–path stable. The main <b>distributional</b> <b>implication</b> of the wage squeez...|$|E

However, {{in the context of}} developing countries, the benefit of energy efficiency improvement need to be measured against a broad range of development indicators. Using a general equlibrium model of the Indonesian economy, we simulate various different energy efficiency scenarios and compare its impact not only on the amount of emissions reduction, but also on other relevant development indicators such as employment creation, poverty incidence and income distribution. The result suggests that energy efficiency improvement which leave more resource available for output expansion is employment-generating, poverty-reducing and can have a favorable <b>distributional</b> <b>implication.</b> For Indonesia, improving fuel efficiency in public road transportation and improving energy efficiency of the energy-intensive manufacturing sector has come out as the key priority areas where energy efficiency strategy should focus on.

40|$|This paper {{analyses}} the distributional {{impact of}} carbon tax in Indonesia, {{one of the}} largest carbon emitter developing countries. Using a Computable General Equilibrium (CGE) model with disaggregated households, the result suggests that in contrast to most studies from industrialised countries, the introduction of carbon tax in Indonesia is not necessarily regressive. Its structural change and resource reallocation e¤ect, following the carbon tax, is in favor of factors endowed more proportionately by rural, and lower income households. In addition, the expenditure of lower income households, especially in rural area, are less sensitive to the prices of energy-related commodities. Revenue-recycling through uniform reduction in commodity tax rate may reduce the adverse aggregate output e¤ect, whereas uniform lumpsum transfers may enhance the progressivity. This study demonstrates an example, that encouraging developing countries to reduce carbon emission, may not only increase the e ¢ ciency of carbon abatement globally, but also have desirable <b>distributional</b> <b>implication</b> in the developing countries themselves...|$|E
40|$|This thesis {{examines}} the question “What {{have been the}} distributional implications of the setup of Earthquake Commission (EQC) building cover for New Zealand homeowners?” In New Zealand, {{the vast majority of}} property owners pay identical premiums {{for the benefit of the}} first $ 100, 000 tranche of natural disaster cover per dwelling. The research provides a detailed quantification of the degree of regressivity of the scheme created by these flat premiums. Using EQC claims and property datasets relating to the Canterbury Earthquake Series, I test the hypothesis that wealthier homeowners are receiving more benefit. Wealth is identified by property value, income and a range of socio-economic variables collected from the most recent New Zealand Census before the earthquake series. In explaining EQC total dwelling payout by property value and by these socio-economic variables, the research shows there is a <b>distributional</b> <b>implication</b> to EQC’s building cover. This thesis includes a proposed modification to the premium structure of the scheme, whereby regressivity could be avoided. The research concludes with a survey of other public natural disaster insurance schemes worldwide, and identifies those likely to face similar regressivity issues...|$|E

In India, many local governments have initiated administrative and valuation reforms to increase the yield from {{property tax}}es. In this paper, we examine the fiscal and <b>distributional</b> <b>implication</b> of the ongoing and potential assessment reforms in two Indian cities - Bangalore and Pune. While our findings are specific to these two cases, the reform efforts and underlying problems are epresentative of most urban local governments. Our main finding is that reform efforts that bring assessment of the property tax base closer to market values have significant positive impacts on revenue generation, and do not have adverse consequences in terms of the tax burden faced by the poor. Further, regulations such as rent control significantly impinge on the growth of revenues from the property tax and in fact do not serve the interests of the poor. While current assessment reforms are a good first step towards increasing the performance of the property tax, structural issues such as improved valuation, increasing buoyancy of the tax, and building taxpayer confidence need to be addressed to make these reforms sustainable.

40|$|Proceedings of the 2013 Georgia Water Resources Conference, April 10 - 11, 2013, Athens, Georgia. Both {{capital and}} people have been moving into flood plains and other high-risk areas and there are serious issues about whether {{they are aware of}} the risk, and whether they are {{adequately}} covered and remain so over time. This paper promises to advance our understanding of how homeowners behave vis-à-vis flood risk, and ultimately, it aims to evaluate the performance of the National flood Insurance Program (NFIP) in Georgia regarding reducing vulnerability. This is done (i) by identifying participation rates in risk areas (which will determine its effectiveness) and (ii) by identifying the distribution of NFIP across income groups (which will determine its equity implications). With more than 40 years of history behind NFIP and the results well documented, the <b>distributional</b> <b>implication</b> of NFIP can be measured quantitatively using a Lorenz curve measure of inequality. The progressivity of the NFIP is measured as the departure of total county premium and program payout from per capita county income proportionality. In addition, the effectiveness of the NFIP will be measured by determining its participation rate i. e. by determining the percent of NFIP policies-in-force in a county divided by the percent of county in the flood risk zone. It is expected that the premium will be proportional since there are no income based discount in NFIP rates. However, the fact that over a third of policy holders live outside the floodplain suggests that the premium could be progressive assuming that the voluntary participation comes from the wealthiest income groups. Since both lower and higher income people live in flood hazard areas, it is expected that the payments could be progressive or regressive depending on whether the riskier area is lower income or higher income.

40|$|This paper {{provides}} a political economy {{explanation for the}} occurrence of fiscal consolidation {{by looking at the}} distributional effects of preceding real exchange rate depreciations across and within countries. Existing studies show that successful fiscal consolidation episodes tend to be preceded by downwards exchange rate movements (Giavazzi and Pagano 1990; Hjelm 2002; Lambertini and Tavares 2005). We show that the mechanism through which this happens differs across open and closed economies. In the former, there is a “good-times effect” following depreciation that induces the public to accept fiscal reform {{in the form of a}} social pact that contains budgetary provisions, provided it has similar <b>distributional</b> <b>implications.</b> By contrast, in closed economies, real depreciations impact differently on different socio-economic groups.

40|$|<b>Distributional</b> <b>implications</b> {{of climate}} change {{mitigation}} policies relate to important questions about fairness: which groups bear the highest burdens – or receive the greatest assistance – from these policies and how does this relate to their contribution to emissions? It is already well established that general carbon taxes {{are likely to have}} regressive impacts – placing higher relative burdens on poorer than on richer households – and it is often argued that these effects can be reversed, for example through rebate schemes or equal per capita carbon allowances. But does this hold equally for home energy, transport, indirect emissions? And which role do household characteristics other than income and household size play for the distribution of benefits and burdens from mitigation policies? This chapter provides an overview of mitigation policies and examines potential <b>distributional</b> <b>implications</b> across different emission domains. The analysis is based on a dataset of household CO 2 emissions that the authors derive from UK expenditure data.

40|$|The paper {{estimates}} the <b>distributional</b> <b>implications</b> of income tax evasion in Hungary {{based on a}} random sample of administrative tax records of 230 thousand individuals. Gross incomes in the administrative tax records are compared with those in a nationally representative household budget survey, assuming that tax-evaders are more likely to report their true incomes in an anonymous interview. Our estimates show that the average rate of underreporting is 11 %, which conceals large differences between self-employed (who hide the majority of their incomes) and employees. The estimates are likely to be lower bound, due to measurement error in the income survey. These rates are then used in EUROMOD, a tax-benefit microsimulation model to calculate the fiscal and <b>distributional</b> <b>implications</b> of underreporting, while taking account of all major direct taxes and cash benefits and also their interactions. Tax evasion reduces fiscal revenues from personal income taxes by about 19 %. While the occurrence of poverty is not affected, income inequality becomes significantly higher (the Gini coefficient increases by 7 %), suggesting that high earners tend to evade proportionately more. Finally, we find that tax evasion largely reduces the progressivity of th...|$|R
