5|$|In short, had Mr. Boulton {{done nothing}} more <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>world</b> <b>than</b> he has {{accomplished}} {{in improving the}} coinage, his name would deserve to be immortalised; and if it be considered that this {{was done in the}} midst of various other important avocations, and at enormous expense,— for which, at the time, he could have had no certainty of an adequate return,—we shall be at a loss whether most to admire his ingenuity, his perseverance, or his munificence. He has conducted the whole more like a sovereign than a private manufacturer; and the love of fame has always been to him a greater stimulus than the love of gain. Yet it is to be hoped that, even in the latter point of view, the enterprise answered its purpose.|$|E

Princip {{was a member of}} a group of conspirators, which included Trifko Grabež; the whole group was arrested by the Austrian police after the assassination. Blaming Serbia for the attack, Austria-Hungary declared war a month later, initiating World War I. Shortly after the assassination, Stojanović wrote in his notebook a quote from Giuseppe Mazzini: [...] "There is no more sacred thing <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>world</b> <b>than</b> the duty of a conspirator, who becomes an avenger of humanity and the apostle of permanent natural laws." [...] On 29June, Stojanović took his final exams at the Tuzla gymnasium.

2500|$|The {{desire for}} men to wear hairpieces is a {{response}} to a long-standing cultural bias against balding men that crosses cultures. [...] Between 1 BC and AD 1, the Roman poet Ovid wrote Ars Amatoria ("The Art of Love") in which he expressed [...] "Ugly are hornless bulls, a field without grass is an eyesore, So is a tree without leaves, so is a head without hair." [...] Another example of this bias, in a later and different culture, can be found in The Arabian Nights (c. AD 800-900), in which the female character Scheherazade asks [...] "Is there anything more ugly <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>world</b> <b>than</b> a man beardless and bald as an artichoke?" ...|$|E
2500|$|Perhaps {{the most}} celebrated work of Scottish {{heraldry}} is the Public Register of all Arms and Bearings in Scotland, known more simply as the Public Register or even Lyon Register.

[...] The work was created under the authority of the Statute of 1672, which provided that it record all arms properly registered with the Lord Lyon. [...] The first volume was bound in 1677 and it has been faithfully maintained from that time. Each of the series of massive volumes contains 120 pages of vellum, and it includes the work of some of Scotland's greatest heraldic artists over nearly three and one-half centuries.|$|E

2500|$|The Olana Viewshed {{comprises}} panoramic {{views that}} {{begin in the}} Hudson River Valley and extend toward Massachusetts, Vermont, and Connecticut. To the west, the ridge of Sieghenburgh drops off abruptly, offering {{a view of the}} Hudson River through a series of native trees planted by Frederic Church in the nineteenth century. West of the Hudson River the eastern range of the Catskill Mountains can be viewed. To the southwest and south the terrain descends to Quarry Hill directing the eye three miles away toward Inbocht Bay. To the southeast and east Blue Hill rises in the distance. In 1876 a New York journalist reported [...] "There are no finer views <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>world</b> <b>than</b> he can command from his windows." [...] Church spent over thirty years meticulously designing the landscape—including the excavation of an artificial lake in 1873 to mirror the Hudson and add balance to the viewshed—meanwhile producing dozens of oil sketches of the view from Olana. [...] The property on Long Hill was purchased by Church because of its grand views: [...] "To his skeptical father (who was financing the purchase), Church argued that the lot was important in 'securing fine openings for the views.'" ...|$|E
2500|$|It {{is evident}} that by and large Creelman stands strong in his {{justification}} for the Porfiriato and cannot imagine a more appropriate character than Díaz to have ruled Mexico. Creelman sees Díaz as the epitome of a Mexican: “There is no more heroic, no more picturesque, no more commanding and appealing figure <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>world</b> <b>than</b> Porfirio Díaz, in whose veins leaps the tide-rip of two races and two civilizations.” Even as Díaz had revealed his plans to retire from office three years earlier and then decided to go against his own word, Díaz, according to Creelman’s interpretation, saw himself as a self-sacrificing patriot who thought {{no one else could}} rule Mexico better than himself. Díaz believed that the Mexican people demanded he remain in office because they knew no other president would keep the status quo. This begs the question: who were the Mexican people? Did these include Indians? And if most Indians did not participate in politics, how did Díaz conclude that he was loved by them? His logic ran thusly: Indians are naturally lazy and have an indifference for politics, which causes them to either believe that “things are bound to go on well under [...] direction...or that it would be worse than useless to attempt to oppose anything he favored.” Likely, this was part of Creelman’s embellishments to Díaz’s story.|$|E
2500|$|Njegoš left Cetinje {{in early}} 1833 {{and set out}} on the long journey to Saint Petersburg. He hoped to be granted a meeting with Russian Emperor (czar) Nicholas I and consecrated as Metropolitan of Cetinje by the Holy Synod. Such a move was {{considered}} highly unusual at the time, as a vladika was traditionally consecrated by the Patriarch of Peć either in Patriarchal Monastery of Peć or in Sremski Karlovci, not Saint Petersburg. According to church canon, a vladika could not be any younger than thirty, a prerequisite that the twenty-year-old Njegoš clearly failed to meet. As such, he chose to have his consecration occur in Saint Petersburg out of political necessity, as he desperately needed the czar to bend church canons in his favour in order to acquire total legitimacy at home and brush aside any theological objections. On his way to Saint Petersburg, Njegoš made stops in several Austrian cities. In Vienna, he met famed Serbian language reformer Vuk Stefanović Karadžić. Karadžić was greatly impressed with Njegoš, and in a letter to poet Lukijan Mušicki, he wrote: [...] "Petar Petrović is not yet twenty years old, but is taller and more handsome than any grenadier in Vienna. Not only does he know Serbian very well to read and write, but he also composes fine verse. He thinks that there is no finer language <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>world</b> <b>than</b> our popular tongue (and he's right to think so, even if it were not true)." [...] Njegoš arrived in Saint Petersburg in March 1833 and was consecrated. After the ceremony, the czar granted Njegoš a total of 36,000 rubles, 15,000 of which were to make up for his travel expenses. Standing next to Njegoš as he gave his speech, the czar is said to have commented: [...] "My word, you're bigger than I am." [...] Grateful, the young vladika replied: [...] "Only God is bigger than the Russian czar!" [...] The czar promised Njegoš that Russia would intervene on Montenegro's behalf as if it were one of its own gubernias, while the Holy Synod vowed to provide all the necessary equipment and funds needed to maintain regular religious services in the country.|$|E
