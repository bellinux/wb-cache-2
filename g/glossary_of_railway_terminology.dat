40|$|Metaphor {{has long}} been {{regarded}} as the trope used in literature and poetry. The {{second half of the}} 20 th century has changed the viewpoint and looked at metaphor as a widely-used linguistic means in various discourses with terminology of no exception. The report dwells upon the analysis of metaphorically presented terms found in the certain dictionaries <b>of</b> <b>railway</b> <b>terminology</b> and their counterparts in the Latvian and Russian language with the purpose of revealing the correspondences in metaphoric representation...|$|R
40|$|Metaphor is {{a widely}} studied {{linguistic}} phenomenon that has recently gained particular interest in various spheres of our life, e. g. politics, law, medicine, science, sports, etc. Terminology has also let metaphorically presented lexical units enter its core vocabulary, thus changing the way metaphor and terms have always been perceived. Terms, though being precise and unambiguous, can indeed be presented through metaphor. The aim of the present report is to study a certain dictionary <b>of</b> <b>railway</b> <b>terminology</b> {{with the purpose of}} identifying metaphorically represented terms in the English language and analyze if their provided Russian counterparts are presented metaphorically or not...|$|R

40|$|In {{this report}} {{we take a}} look into the {{phenomenon}} of metaphor in the scientific language, and in <b>railway</b> <b>terminology,</b> in particular. The interest towards metaphor has become especially extensive since the introduction of contemporary theory of metaphor by George Lakoff. Metaphor has started being viewed at not as a mere linguistic trope, but as a reflection of our existence, a matter of thought. It has resulted in various researches into metaphor in the language of politics, sports, military sphere, medicine, law, etc. with the science of no exception. We argue that metaphor has gained its position in the scientific language with some specificity and try to exemplify it with metaphorically-oriented terms from the field <b>of</b> <b>railway...</b>|$|R
