It includes detailed studies of individual <b>brake</b> <b>system</b> component design parameters, operation, and the linear and nonlinear characteristics of internal components through experimental study and simulation modelling. The prediction of brake pedal ‘feel’ in <b>brake</b> <b>system</b> simulation has been achieved using the simulation modelling package AMESim. Each individual <b>brake</b> <b>system</b> component was modelled individually before combining them into the whole <b>brake</b> <b>system</b> {{in order to identify}} the parameters and the internal components characteristics that influence the brake pedal ‘feel’. The simulation predictions were validated by experimentally measured data and demonstrated the accuracy of simulation modelling. Axisymmetric Finite Element Analysis (using the ABAQUS software) was used to predict the behaviour of nonlinear elastomeric internal components such as the piston seal and the booster reaction disc which was then included in the AMESim simulation model. The seal model FEA highlighted the effects of master cylinder and caliper seal deformation on the brake pedal ‘feel’. The characteristics of the brake booster reaction disc were predicted by the FEA and AMESim simulation modelling and these results highlighted the importance of the nonlinear material characteristics, and their potential contribution to brake pedal ‘feel’ improvement. A full <b>brake</b> <b>system</b> simulation model was designed, prepared, and used to predict <b>brake</b> <b>system</b> <b>performance</b> and to design a <b>system</b> with better <b>brake</b> pedal ‘feel’. Each of the <b>brake</b> <b>system</b> component design parameters was validated to ensure that the <b>braking</b> <b>system</b> <b>performance</b> was accurately predicted. The critical parameter of brake booster air valve spring stiffness was identified to improve the brake ‘pedal ‘feel’. This research has contributed to the advancement of automotive engineering by providing a method for <b>brake</b> <b>system</b> engineers to design a <b>braking</b> <b>system</b> with improved pedal ‘feel’. The simulation model can be used in the future to provide an accurate prediction of <b>brake</b> <b>system</b> <b>performance</b> at the design stage thereby saving time and cost...|$|R

3000|$|Preliminary {{validation}} of TTBS 01 tool on EMU V 250 experimental data has provided an encouraging feedback. As a consequence, TTBS 01 {{should be considered}} both as a good tool for the preliminary simulation of <b>braking</b> <b>systems</b> and a base to build up real-time code for the monitoring of <b>brake</b> <b>system</b> <b>performances.</b> It is worthy {{to mention that the}} calculation method suggested by EN regulations in force [2] could be not reliable, since the typical behavior of braking forces, as influenced by braking pads, is not taken into account. For the purpose of UIC homologation [21], brake pads have to be widely tested, and even more complicated testing activities are performed by manufacturers. For each approved pad, a huge documentation concerning the variability of the friction factor with respect to speed and load conditions can be easily found. Therefore, the proposed method that calculates train braking performances by taking into account the variability of brake [...] pad friction factors has a high feasibility. It is highly recommendable that the implementation of this feature in standard calculation methods is prescribed by regulations in force. Moreover, the use of reliability statistical methods proposed by ERRI documents should be further investigated.|$|R
40|$|During vehicle {{deceleration}} due to braking there is {{friction between the}} lining surface and the brake drum or disc. In this process the kinetic energy of vehicle is turned into thermal energy that raises temperature of the components. The heating of the <b>brake</b> <b>system</b> {{in the course of}} braking is a great problem, because besides damaging the system, it may also affect the wheel and tire, which can cause accidents. In search of the best configuration that considers the true conditions of use, without passing the safety limits, models and formulations are presented with respect to the <b>brake</b> <b>system,</b> considering different <b>braking</b> conditions and kinds of brakes. Some modeling was analyzed using well-known methods. The flat plate model considering energy conservation was applied to a bus, using for this a computer program. The vehicle is simulated to undergo an emergency braking, considering the change of temperature on the lining-drum. The results include deceleration, braking efficiency, wheel resistance, normal reaction on the tires and the coefficient of adhesion. Some of the results were compared with dynamometer tests made by FRAS-LE and others were compared with track tests made by Mercedes-Benz.

40|$|With todays {{and future}} {{environmental}} legislations for CO 2 and other emission gases, all vehicle manufacturers {{are forced to}} further develop tools and methods to make their vehicles more energy efficient and environmentally friendly. One option to achieve this {{is to reduce the}} aerodynamic resistance since it has a significant influence on the vehicle fuel consumption, especially for velocities higher than 50 km/h. Several methods can be used to assess the aerodynamic performance of passenger cars. Wind tunnel testing and numerical simulations are two of the most common, and both have evolved considerably over the last decades. Moreover, growing computational capacity and increasing general knowledge on the methods in context allow the vehicle manufacturers to advance even further in the development of their products. Hence, some effects, phenomena and processes, not accounted for earlier, can be studied thoroughly today. In this thesis a number of such effects and phenomena associated with rotating wheels of a passenger vehicle are addressed. The discussions focus on three main topics: deformation of tyres under different driving and testing scenarios; wheel aerodynamic resistance moment also known as ventilation resistance; and the possibility of combining aerodynamics and thermal management on studies of <b>brake</b> <b>system</b> <b>performance.</b> All topics are investigated experimentally in the Volvo aerodynamic wind tunnel as well as numerically using CFD simulations. From the results it can be concluded that the wheel ventilation resistance moment has a significant influence on the total aerodynamic resistance of a vehicle; however, both measurements and computations of this moment are quite challenging. Furthermore, it has been found that the inertial expansion of tyres is responsible for a substantial change in vehicle ride height and pitch angle. These movements are often restricted in wind tunnel studies, but can be captured using different types of fastening struts that allow vertical displacements, also known as floating struts. It has been shown that that there is {{a significant difference in the}} aerodynamic forces measured depending on the type of strut being used during the test. This is especially pronounced at high velocities. Lastly, the investigation has shown a large potential in combining aero- and thermodynamics for modelling and studying of the <b>brake</b> <b>system</b> <b>performance</b> under different load scenarios. However, further investigations are required to extend and develop the current simulation model...|$|R

40|$|This thesis {{deals with}} the {{development}} of a mathematical model for an air <b>brake</b> <b>system</b> in the presence of leaks. <b>Brake</b> <b>systems</b> in trucks are crucial for ensuring the safety of vehicles and passengers on the roadways. Most trucks in the US are equipped with S-cam drum <b>brake</b> <b>systems</b> and they are sensitive to maintenance. Brake defects such as leaks are a major cause of accidents involving trucks. Leaks in the air <b>brake</b> <b>systems</b> affect <b>braking</b> <b>performance</b> drastically by decreasing the peak braking pressures attained and also increasing the time required to attain the same, thereby resulting in longer stopping distances. Hence {{there is a need for}} detecting leaks in an air <b>brake</b> <b>system.</b> In this thesis, a mathematical model for an air <b>brake</b> <b>system</b> in the presence of leaks is developed with a view towards developing an automatic leak detection system in the near future. The model developed here builds on an earlier research at Texas A&M University in which a "fault free" model of an air <b>brake</b> <b>system</b> is developed, i. e., a mathematical model of an air <b>brake</b> <b>system</b> that predicts how the pressure in the brake chamber evolves as a function of the brake pedal input when there are no leaks in the air <b>brake</b> <b>system.</b> In order to develop a model for an air <b>brake</b> <b>system</b> in the presence of leaks, one must characterize a "leak". A leak may be characterized by the location and its size. Since the pipes are short, the location of the leak does not significantly affect the evolution in the brake pressure as much as its size. For this reason, "effective area" of the leak was chosen as a characteristic of the leak. It was estimated by fitting an empirical relation for leak with leak flow measurement data. The supply pressure and effective area of leak comprised the inputs to the model along with the displacement of the foot pedal (treadle valve plunger). The model was corroborated with the experimental data collected using the setup at Texas A&M University...|$|R
