40|$|Summary Prospects in {{introducing}} GM {{plants in the}} Italian agricultural production system (JEL: Q 18) The {{purpose of the present}} study is to evaluate the willingness of the Italian farmers and consumers respectively, to cultivate GM plants and to buy GM foods. In Italy is not allowed, at the moment, the cultivation of GM plants. Notwithstanding GM foods are normally present on the Italian market, which is strongly dependant from foreign markets especially for soy bean based foodstuffs primarily containing GMO. The study indicates that only 18 % of the Italian farmers are interested in cultivating GMO, mainly in the cereal and livestock sector where GM products are strongly utilized as feeding stuffs for animals. The consumers that declare to be favorable to GMO are 3 % while 8 % consider Italian agriculture to be somehow affected by GM presence. To the majority of the Italian consumers, particularly when buying beef filet and chicken food, it is more important the information regarding the fact that animals have been raised and fed with <b>GMO</b> – <b>free</b> feeding stuffs rather than the price of the products itself. Within this framework, the opportunity and consequent choice of not cultivating GM plants seems, therefore, sustainable when considered on an overall supply chain approach aiming to offer a highly qualified product or, as in the case of animal feed stuffs, obtained without utilizing GMO...|$|R
40|$|Potato late blight, {{caused by}} the oomycete Phytophthora infestans, {{has a long history}} as a major problem in potato cultivation. Host {{resistance}} was introduced and overcome and a new, more versatile and aggressive, pathogen population was introduced into the Netherlands an Europe leading to a situation in which potato late blight is almost exclusively controlled through an intensive use of fungicides. A growing societal concern about the chemical inputs into the food production chain, has inspired two research programmes specifically targeted at potato late blight: the Umbrella Plan Phytophthora (P. infestans biology, ecology and late blight management) and DuRPh, Healthy potato production: development of durable Phytophthora resistance applying GMO methods The Umbrella plan Phytophthora was initialised in 2003 aiming to reduce the environmental impact of late blight control by 75 % within 10 years. In a unique management structure the program is funded by the Dutch Ministry of Agriculture, Nature and Food Quality but management {{is in the hands of}} the Dutch potato industry. Research within the umbrella plan is structured in 3 themes and a toolbox in which results are evaluated for their practical value. The MasterPlan Phytophthora, a growers initiative, then communicates the results to the Dutch potato growers. This integrated approach has already yielded a significant reduction of the environmental impact due to late blight control. DuRPh, initialised in 2006, is using GMO methodology to detect, clone and marker free transfer major resistance genes to existing varieties. Societal benefits comprise reduced costs of control, an improved environment and a boost to fundamental research. The cisgene approach using only potato genes combined with marker free transformation may contribute to public acceptance of GMO food. The program serves as a proof of principle for the application of GMO techniques and their results for breeding and disease control purposes. Examples of some of the questions studied are: How can the detection efficiency of major (R-) genes in wild species, subsequent isolation and stacking of these genes in existing varieties be improved? How do we develop adequate resistance management strategies for the temporal and spatial deployment of major genes? How to study societal resistance and acceptance mechanisms regarding this specific <b>GMO</b> (marker <b>free</b> and cisgene) approach? The programme integrates related projects, is pre-competitive and its results will be published. Co-operation with the Dutch breeding industry will be sought actively as well as EU FP 7 co-funding. vokMyynti MTT Tietopalvelut 31600 Jokioine...|$|R

A central argument by proponents of GMO is that the end products are identical to those where GMO has not been used.

This result confirms previous observations that GMO food can be a credence good causing a market failure. Second, consumers are also {{willing to pay a}} significantly higher product price to ensure a total ban on the use of GMO in animal fodder.

This study examined the impact of a Halal certification mark as both an advertisement and a signifier of third-party certification for non-Muslims in Malaysia. The results show that non-Muslims do not think that advertisement with Halal certification mark is offensive.

30|$|Measures of co-existence as {{laid down}} by German law (Sections 16 a and 36 a Act GenTG) and good {{practice}} rules (c.f. [11]) include the register on GMO release (Section 16 a GenTG), duties of GMO farmers to inform neighbours of planned GMO release (Cf. Sections 16 b (5), 18 (2) and 21 GenTG - duty to inform the authorities and participation of the public; Section 35 GenTG - duty to inform the injured party, as well as Section 3 GenTPfEV(Regulation on the Production of Genetically Modified Crops) - duty to inform the neighbour prior to the planting of GMO), distance rules for planting like GMO and non-GMO crops (Annex to GenTPfEV, specific rules for plants), and liability for the contamination of neighbouring crops (Section 36 a GenTG). All of these measures aim at solving conflicts between the individual landowners. In the nationwide register on GMO releases, information is displayed about the GMO (its name and characteristics), the property on which it will be released, {{the period in which}} it shall be cultivated and if applicable the name of the person farming the plot of land. The GMO farmer has to register the required information prior to cultivation (Section 16 a (2) and (3) GenTG). The register {{is open to the public}} as far as the characteristics and the plot of land on which the GMO will be cultivated are concerned (Section 16 a (1) sentence 3, in conjunction with (4) GenTG). Additional prior information duties rest upon the GMO farmer as he is obliged to inform his neighbour about the cultivation of GMOs at least 3 months prior to the cultivation (Section 3 (1) GenTPflEV). In case the GMO farmer does not get any response from the neighbour within 1 month after receipt, he can assume that the neighbour does not cultivate plants of the same kind as the GMO or able to cross out with it (Section 3 (2) GenTPflEV). If such plants are cultivated on neighbouring fields, the GMO farmer is obliged to meet the minimum distance requirements set out in the annex to the GenTPflEV (Section 4 GenTPflEV). Until now, only distance rules for GMO maize have been laid down. One hundred and fifty meters are required for the distance between GMO and conventional maize and 300 m for GMO and organic maize. In case the landowner complies with these regulations and the crops of the neighbour are nevertheless contaminated, although the crop was be labelled as GMO based or cannot be labelled as <b>GMO</b> <b>free,</b> the GMO farmer is liable for the damage arising out of this contamination (Section 906 Civil Law Code (Bürgerliches Gesetzbuch - BGB) together with Section 36 a GenTG). The damage is calculated according to the impairment of saleability of the product as <b>GMO</b> <b>free.</b> In case the landowner complies with these regulations but the crops of the neighbour are nevertheless contaminated, the GMO farmer is liable for the damage arising out of the contamination, i.e. damage which the neighbour has to face because he must label his crops as GMO based or cannot label them <b>GMO</b> <b>free.</b>|$|E
40|$|One of {{the main}} {{principles}} of organic husbandry is that animal feed must be <b>GMO</b> <b>free,</b> and soya bean is well-known as a high risk GMO alimentary source. About 25 dry dairy cattle of the Italian Holstein breed, from the Cooperativa Emilio Sereni of Borgo S. Lorenzo (FI), were fed in two successive diets: the first with extruded soya bean (A), and the second in which bitter lupin, faba bean and proteinic pea substituted the soya bean (B). We evaluated both the consumption and the apparent digestibility (using acid insoluble ash as internal marker) of the two diets, repeating the trial twice. The presence of bitter lupin did not influence either the consumption of other feed, or the faecal water content. The apparent digestibility of the organic matter resulted satisfactory in both the diets, but was significantly higher in diet (A) than in diet (B) (71, 6 % vs 67, 3 %). In conclusion, even though we wish the cultivation of sweet lupin would be increase in Italy, we retain that also bitter lupin (mixed with other feed to increase the palatability) {{could be used as}} alternative protein source in dairy cattle diets...|$|E
40|$|Certification {{programs}} has been employed in many agricultural products {{as a means}} to encourage and communicate compliance with standards associated with various attributes, such as organic, fair-trade, <b>GMO</b> <b>free,</b> and eco- friendly, among others. Such programs further seek to provide added value, through a price premium, to producers and supply chain actors associated with the label. In this paper, we review a number of global labeling and certification programs that could add value for coffee farms in India through the promotion of conservation and environmental protection. We provide results from a survey conducted on a sample of coffee farms in Coorg district, India to assess their awareness and perceptions related towards certified coffee and environmental conservation in general. Survey results illustrate strong positive associations with the environment by coffee planters, particularly among certified and organic producers. However, price premiums for certified and organic coffee are relatively small. While the potential of conservation-oriented certification for coffee in Coorg could be relatively limited outside of a few individual-level niches, branding Coorg more generally as a conservation-oriented region could hold promise, lever- aging and personalizing the uniqueness of the natural offerings from Coorg and tapping into burgeoning associations with place and region in India.

30|$|A European Commission Recommendation of 2003 {{sets out}} {{guidelines}} {{for the development of}} national strategies and best practices to ensure the co-existence of genetically modified organism (GMO) agriculture with conventional and organic farming [1]. The aim of the recommendation is to ensure that agricultural methods not using GMOs shall persist side by side with GMO-based methods [2]. Co-existence shall ensure that farmers, industry, commerce and consumers have a free choice between conventional, organic and GMO crops [3]. This definition of co-existence shows that the basic idea of co-existence is the economic concern, not however environmental and health risks, as being emphasised by the traditional GMO law. The latter is dealt with by Directive 2001 / 18 /EC [4] on the deliberate release of GMOs and Regulation 1829 / 03 [5] on genetically modified food and feed including seed (IT is controversial whether seed is comprised by the Regulation. However, it is common practice) [6]. Article 4 of the Directive states that the granting of an authorisation for the deliberate release of a GMO shall only be given, if a comprehensive risk assessment shows that there are no risks to the environment or health, or that the existing risks can be managed by appropriate measures, within the framework of risk management [7]. The same is done by Art. 4 of Regulation 1829 / 03. Separated from this risk-based approach, co-existence (even though it should implicitly serve to minimise environmental or health risks, too) aims at the protection of real assets: the possibility to sell products as <b>GMO</b> <b>free.</b>|$|E
40|$|AbstractHere {{we present}} the {{implementation}} of new technologies, into the quality assurance scheme of a Greek dairy company, in order to place in higher standards the safety and quality of products. A fully equipped Molecular Biology Laboratory (MBL) has been established, providing molecular analyses for various microbiological issues and secondary GMO analysis and Integrated Pest Management support (IPM). More specific, molecular analyses methods were applied for the identification of microorganisms (bacteria and fungi) in the genus/species level, {{using a variety of}} DNA technologies, such as Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR), Real Time PCR (RT-PCR) and DNA sequencing. Additional techniques include typing of microorganisms in strain level and the confirmation of <b>GMO</b> <b>free</b> products as well as the development, adaptation and application of molecular and microbiological techniques in order to cover certain industrial needs. Concerning the IPM control scheme, molecular techniques were applied mainly on the identification of arthropods in the order/genus level, an innovative application applied {{for the first time in}} Greek industry. The data obtained from identification analyses of microorganisms are incorporated in an in house “micro bank” which is different for each production plant. The findings correlated with the sampling points, could indicate putative sources of contamination, allowing for faster, more focused corrective actions. Same principle was applied for arthropod identification, building an “insect bank”. In the GMO field, the lab supports the “Non GMO policy” of the company from the raw materials to the final products. The speed and the accuracy of the results of the DNA technology applications, in combination with the standard-classical analyses conducted from the QC departments, contribute to a maximum level of safety and quality of final products...|$|E

In this ethnography cum dissertation I present the fieldwork that I undertook with an environmental activist group based in Lisbon, Portugal in 2009. During the fieldwork 4 months of participant-observation I have studied the Jantar Popular (JP) that GAIA (Grupo de Acção e Intervenção Ambiental), an environmental NGO, facilitates every Thursday of the week, except for August. The food of the Jantar Popular is vegan, made with organic, <b>GMO</b> <b>free,</b> locally produced and socially just ingredients. A plate of food is available at cost price currently 3, 00 or can be obtained for free by participating in any of the tasks at hand. This dinner is completely organized by volunteers, from planning the menu to cleaning up the space(s) {{at the end of the}} evening. Without volunteers there would be no dinner. During the Jantar Popular, the eater is bonding through food with the other eaters. Thus, commensality becomes an ideal tool for putting environmental food politics into practice through just' eating in common. At the same time, the JP turns into a Temporary Vegan Zone (TVZ), in the vein of Turner's 'communitas', as it becomes a temporary place where people can transcend their everyday experience of food. This dissertation deals with the Jantar Popular as a ritual meal where the food consumed expresses the political and cultural choices in terms of diet of the participants, building and reinforcing at the same time a sense of community of belief among them...|$|E
40|$|Austria {{is one of}} {{the leading}} {{countries}} in the world when it comes to organic farming. A closer look at the development of the market shares of different product categories reveals however, that some segments of organic products seemed to be constantly preferred while others were neglected by Austrian consumers over the past years: According to market statistics the categories “meat & poultry” and “ham & sausages” have the lowest market shares of organic fresh produce while at the same time, organic milk and organic eggs have the highest market shares. Since all of those organic products – milk, eggs as well as meat and meat products – are food of animal origin, for which the same organic criteria apply (the products are <b>GMO</b> <b>free,</b> the animals get no or less antibiotics and are bred in a species-appropriate way), one might wonder why the differences in the market shares are so big. The purpose of this thesis is therefore to figure out why Austrian consumers do not buy more organic meat and meat products. An additional task is to identify (realistic) measures to enlarge these small market shares. A review of existing studies on the consumption of organic products in general and organic meat and meat products in particular, an analysis of the Austrian organic market and the evaluation of interviews with several experts should provide answers to the research question. As most of the interviewed experts refer to the price as the only or at least one of several reasons for the small market shares of organic meat and meat products in Austria and this result confirms findings from the literature review and the analysis of the Austrian organic market, it seems that the difference in market share size is not all about the price, but mainly. The study provides further possible reasons as well as information on favourable and unfavourable conditions and measures for the growth of the small market shares and on the future development of (organic) meat consumption in Austria...|$|E
40|$|Verifying the {{description}} of food {{in terms of its}} composition, processing or origin is challenging, but the consumers need clear and accurate information to make informed choices about their diet and the foods they buy. The problem of genetically modified organism (GMO) safety is an open question and for which the public opinion has a particular sensitivity and concern. Even if the current European standards allow the use of authorized GMOs only, it should be stressed that is mandatory to label their presence just above 0. 9 %, while there is no obligation to inform the consumer about their use in the production process. It follows that the consumer may be informed of the presence of GMOs in food only when it exceeds the threshold value of 0. 9 %, while being completely unaware if animal products were obtained by feeding the animals with even 100 % GMOs. Analytical techniques based on the measurement of stable isotope ratio mass spectrometry (IRMS) were demonstrated to be a powerful tools for determining the both the geographic origin and the production system of food, milk and dairy products included. In particular, the ratio 13 C/ 12 C of animal products is able to discriminate between a diet based on C 3 or C 4 plants, and 13 δ of glycerol has been shown to increase with maize amount. The possibility to trace OGM presence in the fodder can be speculated on the same hypothesis, since transgenic fodder is mainly made up of soybean, a typical C 3 plant, largely used in conventional zootechny. Conventional and organic (<b>GMO</b> <b>free)</b> milk samples were collected from the Italian market and analyzed for 13 C/ 12 C ratio of glycerol. A sample preparation from whole milk was set up, specifically targeted for GC-IRMS analysis. When compared to conventional milk, organic milk resulted in an enrichment in 13 C (P < 0. 02), showing a different diet regimen, rich in C 4 plants, and therefore suggesting a GMO-free diet. These encouraging results can be combined with data deriving from the investigation of different isotope ratios, to assess also the geographical origin of the milk (e. g. no EU countries, with different GM regulations) and screening of milk for transgenic DNA presence...|$|E
40|$|Risk {{analysis}} has become important to assess conditions and take decisions on control procedures. In this context {{it is considered}} a prerequisite {{in the evaluation of}} GM food. Many consumers worldwide worry that food derived from genetically modified organisms (GMOs) may be unhealthy and hence regulations on GMO authorisations and labelling have become more stringent. Nowadays there is a higher demand for non-GM products and these products could be differentiated from GM products using the identity preservation system (IP) that could apply throughout the grain processing system. IP is the creation of a transparent communication system that encompasses HACCP, traceability and related systems in the supply chain. This process guarantees that certain characteristics of the lots of food (non-GM origin) are maintained “from farm to fork”. This article examines the steps taken by the Hellenic Food Safety Authority to examine the presence of GMOs in foods. The whole integrated European legislation framework currently in place still needs to be implemented in Greece. Penalties should be enforced to those who import, process GMOs without special licence and do not label those products. Similar penalties should be enforced to those companies that issue false certificates beyond the liabilities taken by the food enterprises for farmers’ compensation. We argue that Greece has no serious reasons to choose the use of GMOs {{due to the fact that}} the structural and pedologic characteristics of the Greek agriculture favour the biological and integrated cultivation more. Greece is not in favour of the politics behind coexistence of conventional and GM plants and objects to the use of GMOs in the food and the environment because the processor has a big burden in terms of money, time and will suffer a great deal in order to prove that their products are <b>GMO</b> <b>free</b> or that any contamination is adventitious or technically unavoidable. Moreover, Greece owns a large variety of genetic material that should try to protect from patenting and commercialisation. Finally, we should be aware of the requirements of movement of GMOs within borders, i. e. GMOs grown or used in other countries but which are not intended to cross into Greece, since Greece is very close to countries that are non-EU. This is where the development of a new, integrated, trustworthy and transparent food quality control system will help to satisfy the societal demands for safe and quality products. On the other hand, Greece should not be isolated from any recent scientific technological development and should assess the possible advantages for some cultivation using a case by case approach. Finally, the safety assessment of GM foods and feed has been discussed according to the risk assessment methodology applied by EFSA...|$|E
