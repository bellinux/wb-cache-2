50|$|Pennisetum pedicellatum, known {{simply as}} desho or as desho grass, is an {{indigenous}} grass of Ethiopia belonging to the Poaceae family of monocot angiosperm plants. It {{is also known as}} annual kyasuwa grass in Nigeria, bare in Mauritania, and deenanath grass in India. It grows in its native geographic location, naturally spreading across the escarpment of the Ethiopian highlands. Widely available in this location, it is ideal for livestock feed and can be sustainably cultivated on small plots of land. Thus desho is becoming increasingly utilized, along with various soil and water conservation techniques, as a local method of improving <b>grazing</b> <b>land</b> <b>management</b> and combating a growing productivity problem of the local region.|$|E
50|$|The desho <b>grazing</b> <b>land</b> <b>management</b> {{intervention}} {{has significant}} positive {{impacts on the}} livelihoods of Ethiopian farmers. Ethiopia has the largest livestock population is Africa. Livestock production accounts for approximately 40% of the average household income of an Ethiopian farmer. Therefore the increase in grazing land productivity leads {{to the increase in}} fodder (desho) production, due to high and consistent good quality yields, and consequently creates an increase in livestock production. The commercialisation and marketing of the animals and their by products then increases the cash income of the farmer and their family. Desho also provides a small business opportunity for Ethiopians. Various studies have shown that fodder is the key limiting factor influencing the growth of the commercial livestock production sector in Ethiopia as there is a critical shortage of consistent quality fodder. Thus, the development of efficient and sustainable for-profit desho plots and nurseries could be a good business model with the goal of selling the desho materials to local farmers. If fodder demands are met, commercial livestock production of the region could be promoted, raising the livelihoods of farmers and bringing more economic opportunity to the regioin.|$|E

40|$|<b>Grazing</b> <b>lands</b> {{and their}} <b>management</b> in {{livestock}} systems are {{a matter of}} special importance {{in the search for}} sustainability. Socio-economic and ecological objectives should be considered jointly in considering livestock production. In addition to the general issues of biodiversity and habitat preservation, the challenges for their management vary according to the regional conditions. In Southern European environments, where the past changes in livestock farming have led to a general decrease in their use, the questions under study are how to find ways to meet the threats to landscape amenity, biodiversity, the sustainability of local animal feeding resources and the rural population. <b>Grazing</b> <b>lands</b> and their <b>management</b> is also an important target of EU agri-environmental policy. The multifunctional use of this land, which is currently sought, reinforces the need for animal scientists to consider the use and <b>management</b> of <b>grazing</b> <b>lands</b> in reference not only to the techno-economical efficiency of animal feeding systems but also in reference to the long-term (e. g. biodiversity change) and at larger spatial scales (for example the landscape and watershed).

The blowout penstemon (Penstemon haydenii) is an endangered species, found only in the Sandhills and in similar environments in central Wyoming. [...] The blowout penstemon stabilizes the soil where wind erosion exposes the bare sand and creates a blowout, but is choked out when other species begin to recolonize. <b>Grazing</b> and <b>land</b> <b>management</b> practices used by Sandhills ranchers have reduced erosion, thus diminishing the plant's habitat.|$|R
50|$|The desho <b>grazing</b> <b>land</b> <b>management</b> {{intervention}} {{has significant}} positive {{impacts on the}} natural environment, particularly when biodiversity is improved. Desho {{is used as a}} rehabilitation method to overcome land degradation caused by overpopulation and unsustainable farming practices. Desho greatly improves ground cover, which in turn controls runoff and soil loss. Moreover its massive root system strengthens the soil structure and improves water conservation capacities while effectively using deeper nutrients for growth. The application of trees and legumes alongside desho improves soil fertility by regenerating critical nutrients such as fixed nitrogen from legumes. However, most important for land rehabilitation is the change from overgrazing to silvopasture practices (combining forestry with grazing). In Ethiopian agriculture, livestock production plays a fundamental role for the livelihood of the people. Due to rapid population growth in the Ethiopian highlands, traditional communal grazing areas are increasingly being fragmented into cropland to meet growing demand. In turn, massive pressure is placed on remaining grazing land as overstocking cow and oxen leads to overgrazing and land degradation. This pattern negatively affects agricultural productivity and places a direct threat on the livelihoods of local farmers. Implementing desho with silvopasture methods, such as cut-and-carry and biodiversity systems, protects grazing land from further degradation while increasing its productivity, and consequently improving livestock production.|$|E
5000|$|The {{technical}} specifications for cultivating desho {{are essential to}} improve <b>grazing</b> <b>land</b> <b>management</b> practices. Cuts of the grass are ideally planted in rows, spaced at 10 cm by 10 cm, using a hand hoe. This spacing gives each plant sufficient soil nutrients and access to sunlight to achieve optimal growth, while ensuring the soil will be completely covered by the grass once established. It is recommended to plant other species alongside desho to promote biodiversity. Multipurpose shrubs/trees, for example Leucaena sp and Sesbania sp, can be planted approximately 5 m apart with no particular layout. Other legumes, such as alfalfa and clover, can be mixed in with desho by being broadcast throughout the plot. [...] Once planted, maintenance activities such as applying fertilizer, weeding and gap filling, ensure proper establishment and persistence of desho. Fertilizer should be applied throughout the plot one month after planting. It is recommended to use organic compost {{in the form of}} animal manure, leaf litter, wood ash, food scraps, and/or any other rich biodegradable matters. After this initial treatment, fertilizer is only applied sporadically when desho plants are struggling to grow or where replanting has taken place. Weeding and gap filling are continuous activities. However, after 2 to 3 years, maintenance inputs decrease substantially or cease altogether as the grass cover closes up and the plot becomes a sustainable fodder source.|$|E

40|$|The {{establishment}} of a minimum grazing lease rate in Hawai‘i is important for several reasons. First, it provides a means to adjust lease rate values according to fluctuations in livestock markets, or the rancher’s ability to pay, and agricultural land use values. Second, it provides a statewide standard that can easily be applied by state, federal, and private <b>land</b> <b>management</b> entities, and this will help to eliminate the large discrepancies that currently exist in statewide lease rates. Third, a minimum grazing lease rate provides a means for ranchers and <b>land</b> <b>management</b> entities to objectively determine {{the value of the}} <b>land</b> unit for <b>grazing</b> and the value of <b>grazing</b> for that <b>land</b> unit.

40|$|The {{study was}} {{conducted}} in Gamogofa zone, southern Ethiopia, located 445 - 505 km south of Addis Ababa. The area is semi-arid lowland with altitudes ranging from 746 to 1450 m asl and mean temperature ranges from 22 to 25 °C. The dominant farming system is mixed crop-livestock. Cattle, goats and poultry are the major livestock species, while maize, sorghum, teff, banana and mango are the major crops. Cattle fattening is an important undertaking and source of livelihoods. However, the fattening system is traditional low-input-low-output and producers are not benefiting much from the sector. This study evaluated the challenges and constraints, and cattle fattening innovations introduced through the participation of stakeholders in the study area. The study used focus group discussion, key informants interview, livestock commodity platforms and questionnaires for data collection. The major challenges and constraints identified are; a) feed and feeding related - lack of improved fodder and poor utilisation, lack of fodder conservation practices, poor natural <b>grazing</b> <b>lands</b> <b>management</b> and energy loss due to long distance grazing; lack of access for concentrate feed; b) cattle related - inappropriate cattle type for fattening; c) production related - long cycle fattening (> 8 months), poor housing and poor cattle management; d) market related - unorganised cattle marking, dominance of local markets with brokers which makes producers price takers, lack of market linkage; e) capacity related - lack of knowledge and skill on improved cattle fattening by producers, input providers and livestock extension staff. The following interventions were introduced: a) capacity related, which includes skill based training and coaching & mentoring of producers and livestock extension staff on improved cattle fattening, improved reproductive management and artificial insemination; b) fattening innovations which includes stall feeding instead of grazing, short cycle (3 - 4 months) multiple fattening per annum, improved on farm fodder production, improved fodder utilisation through chopping, fodder conservation through bag silage making & proper harvesting and storage of crop residues, initiation of commercial concentrate feed supplying business and use of concentrate supplementation, better animal selection from the market and deworming before fattening, establishment of fattened cattle marketing groups, and marketing linkage with buyers.

40|$|This paper {{describes}} {{the employment of}} two experienced graziers as consultants to apply and evaluate a model for calculating 'safe' long-term grazing capacities of individual properties. The model was based on ecological principles and entailed estimates of average annual forage grown (kglha) on the different land systems on each property and the calculation {{of the number of}} livestock (dry sheep equivalents, DSE) required to 'safely' utilise this forage. The grazier consultants applied and evaluated the 'safe' grazing capacity model on 20 properties of their choosing. For evaluation, model results were compared with; (a) the Department of Lands rated carrying capacities for those properties and (b) the grazing capacity assessed independently by the owners of those properties. For the 20 properties, the average 'safe' grazing capacity calculated by the model (21. 0 DSE/kmZ) was 8 % lighter than the average of the owner assessed capacities (22. 7 DSE/kmZ), which in tum was 37 % lighter than the average of the pre- 1989 Department of Lands rated carrying capacity (31. 0 DSE/kmZ).
