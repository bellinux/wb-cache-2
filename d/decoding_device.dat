Experimental results show that these architectures perform approximately equally well as the full decode and recode architecture for low to medium bitrates.

Since the master key is known, it follows that an unlicensed HDCP <b>decoding</b> <b>device</b> could simply use the master key to dynamically generate new keys on the fly, making revocation impossible. It was not immediately clear who discovered the key or how they discovered it, though the discovery was announced via a Twitter update which linked to a Pastebin snippet containing the key and instructions on how to use it.

40|$|The {{relative}} effectiveness of annotating L 2 texts for improved comprehension has been generally supported by studies on glossing.

The present study addresses this important methodological problem in the glossing strand of research by utilizing a pretest-posttest-delayed posttest hybrid design that incorporates a combination of outcome and processing measures to investigate the issue of L 1 -translation glosses and type of linguistic item in relation to reading comprehension, noticing and learning.

Experimental results clearly show the complexity advantage of this method. The second example is a more active proxy. Adaptation to the image statistics is introduced. Simulations of the optimization process based on the average complexity criteria show that the client complexity can be further reduced, while maintaining a low side information overhead.

40|$|SummaryQuantitative {{modeling}} of human brain activity can provide crucial insights about cortical representations [1, 2] and can {{form the basis}} for brain <b>decoding</b> <b>devices</b> [3 – 5]. Recent functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) studies have modeled brain activity elicited by static visual patterns and have reconstructed these patterns from brain activity [6 – 8]. However, blood oxygen level-dependent (BOLD) signals measured via fMRI are very slow [9], so it has been difficult to model brain activity elicited by dynamic stimuli such as natural movies. Here we present a new motion-energy [10, 11] encoding model that largely overcomes this limitation. The model describes fast visual information and slow hemodynamics by separate components. We recorded BOLD signals in occipitotemporal visual cortex of human subjects who watched natural movies and fit the model separately to individual voxels. Visualization of the fit models reveals how early visual areas represent the information in movies. To demonstrate the power of our approach, we also constructed a Bayesian decoder [8] by combining estimated encoding models with a sampled natural movie prior. The decoder provides remarkable reconstructions of the viewed movies. These results demonstrate that dynamic brain activity measured under naturalistic conditions can be decoded using current fMRI technology...|$|R
