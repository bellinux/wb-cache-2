For credible and successful planning and implementation of the management of breeding program, it is necessary to do the systematization of breeding under pedigree data, and planned management of breeding (mating planning) organized along the lines of bulls and cow families. For this reason, conducted breeding systematization <b>drill</b> (<b>building</b> pedigree), and the result is the definition of systematization 7 lines of bulls and 13 cows lines. Systematic cultivation of the lines by a planned management of breeding in order to prevent the reduction of genetic variability, realistically determine demographic parameters, a complete assessment of the genetic diversity of the breed, more efficient implementation of molecular studies with significantly lower costs, reduces the cost of storage of genetic material in the gene bank and to control breeding since the excreta of animals breeding...|$|E

50|$|In 1933, {{the newly}} formed Chief Directorate of the Northern Sea Route sent Pravda, under Captain Kh. A. Belitskiy, to Nordvik on the first oil {{exploration}} expedition to Northern Siberia. This venture was led by N.N. Urvantsev who travelled on Pravda along with his wife, Dr. Yelizaveta Ivanovna {{who was in charge}} of medical care. Pravdas cargo consisted of 2,430 tonnes of equipment and supplies for this important expedition, including four experimental NATI-2 half-track vehicles built by the Nauchnyy Avtotraktornyy Institut in Moscow. These were the first tracked vehicles to be used in the Russian Arctic. They would be used to haul the <b>drill,</b> <b>buildings</b> and supplies, from the landing site to the drilling site.

25|$|Many common {{building}} materials used before 1975 contain asbestos, such as some floor tiles, ceiling tiles, shingles, fireproofing, heating systems, pipe wrap, taping muds, mastics, and other insulation materials. Normally, significant releases of asbestos fiber {{do not occur}} unless the {{building materials}} are disturbed, such as by cutting, sanding, <b>drilling,</b> or <b>building</b> remodelling. Removal of asbestos-containing materials is not always optimal because the fibers can be spread into the air during the removal process. A management program for intact asbestos-containing materials is often recommended instead.|$|R
40|$|As single-paradigm {{reasoning}} methods {{become more}} mature and understood, research activities targeted at combining them become more frequent. Methods that combine case-based reasoning with a model-based component are attracting {{a growing number}} of researchers within the case-based reasoning community. There is clear evidence of synergy effects, in that the resulting systems become both more competent and more efficient than if only a single reasoning method is used. The catch is that the burden on the knowledge engineer and domain expert is increased, due to the need for developing an explicit model of general domain knowledge. Methods developed within the knowledgeacquisition and modelling communities, however, as well as work on reusable ontologies, can provide some help. In particular, the notion of knowledge-level modelling {{has proved to be a}} useful one in this context. The type of application targeted in our research is decision making in complex environments, such as oil well <b>drilling.</b> <b>Building</b> application systems in such domains further calls for a clarification of basic terms such as “data”, “information”, and “knowledge”, related to their roles in cognitive and computational information processing. For case-based reasoning this becomes particularly relevant, since a case can hold structures of various basic kinds.

However, the financial crisis of 2008 {{turned out to be}} a major barrier: the building activities for the new dwellings slowed down; there would not be sufficient clients for the pumped-up heat. As the anticipated returns crumbled, the private consortium partners discussed culling the project. Moreover, the consortium had to obtain permits for <b>drilling</b> and <b>building</b> a heat station and a heat network from the Mining Authority. Again, the combination of activities required the expertise of different legal advisors: no single organization had all knowledge required. The local authorities granted the permits but concerned citizens living close to the planned well objected because of expected disturbances in the neighbourhood. The legal dispute was taken to the highest court in the Netherlands (the Raad van State), who dismissed the objections (Raad van State, 2010).|$|R
