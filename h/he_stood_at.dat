5|$|Americus (foaled 1892, died 1910), was an American Thoroughbred racehorse who was {{exported}} to England. He {{had some success}} as a racehorse, but was more notable for his influence at stud. He was bred in California and won the 1895 Culver Stakes prior to his export. He continued to race in England, until he was nine years old, while also standing as a breeding stallion. <b>He</b> <b>stood</b> <b>at</b> stud in Italy, Ireland, Germany, and Belgium before dying in Germany in 1910.

25|$|Kingcraft was {{retired to}} his owners stud {{where he had}} limited success. The best of his {{offspring}} were Swift and Vernet, both of whom won the Grand Criterium. When Lord Falmouth decided to dispose of all his horses in 1884 Kingcraft was bought for 500 guineas by Lord Rossmore. He was sent to Ireland where <b>he</b> <b>stood</b> <b>at</b> the Athgarvan Stud at the Curragh.

25|$|At {{the end of}} the war, Witez II {{and other}} horses {{captured}} from the Nazis were shipped to the United States, much to the dismay of the Poles, who had hoped to recover the horses they had lost. The journey by ship from Europe to America was quite rough, but the horses arrived safely in Newport News, Virginia in late 1945, and spent the winter at the U.S. Army Remount station at Front Royal, Virginia. In early 1946, Witez II and the bulk of the imported Arabians were shipped to the Army Remount station at the former W.K. Kellogg Arabian Ranch in Pomona, California, where <b>he</b> <b>stood</b> <b>at</b> stud until 1948.

25|$|In 1857 {{he was the}} {{youngest}} member of a committee of rabbis chosen to regulate the management of the Volozhin Yeshiva. Ten years later he settled a quarrel which threatened to ruin the Mir Yeshiva. In 1868 <b>he</b> <b>stood</b> <b>at</b> the head of a committee to help the poor during a drought which almost produced a famine, and he allowed as a temporary measure the use of peas and beans in the Passover of that year. In 1875, he decided against the use of the Corfu Citron as Etrog, because of the exorbitant price to which they had risen. In 1879 he arranged, through Prof. A. Harkavy, his former pupil, that three rabbis, Reuben of Dünaburg, Lipa Boslansky of Mir, and Elijah Eliezer Grodzenski of Vilna, should be added to the official rabbinical commission, which had thitherto consisted entirely of men of affairs and secular scholars.|$|E
25|$|But not all {{responses}} were positive. Joseph Stalin argued in 1924 that Reed was misleading {{in regards to}} Leon Trotsky. The book portrays Trotsky (head of the Red Army) {{as a man who}} co-led the revolution with Lenin and mentions Stalin only twice—one of them being only in the recitation of a list of names, as both Lenin and Trotsky were internationally known, whereas the activities of other Bolshevik militants were virtually unknown. Russian writer Anatoly Rybakov elaborates on Stalinist Soviet Union’s ban on Ten Days that Shook the World: “The main task was to build a mighty socialist state. For that, mighty power was needed. Stalin was at the head of that power, which mean that <b>he</b> <b>stood</b> <b>at</b> its source with Lenin. Together with Lenin he led the October Revolution. John Reed had presented the history of October differently. That wasn’t the John Reed we needed.” After Stalin’s death, the book was allowed to recirculate.|$|E
25|$|Before the 1958 season, Cleveland {{was again}} {{in search of}} a quarterback. O'Connell had played well in the {{previous}} two seasons – he led the league in passing in 1957 – but lacked the stature and durability Paul Brown wanted in a starter. <b>He</b> <b>stood</b> <b>at</b> just 5 feet, 10 inches tall and was hurt numerous times, including a sprained ankle and a broken bone in his leg that kept him out of the last two games of the 1957 regular season. Due in part to these injuries, O'Connell retired early in 1958 to take a coaching job in Illinois, and Milt Plum was named the starter. Cleveland, however, was relying increasingly on the running game, in contrast to its pass-happy early years under Graham. As the team built up a 9–3 regular-season record, Brown in 1958 ran for 1,527 yards – almost twice as much as any other back and a league record at the time.|$|E
