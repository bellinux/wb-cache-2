Chemical control methods are not ecofriendly and have several problems of resistance development and residual toxicity. Therefore, biological control methods were {{tried to control}} the insect. To start with methods were standardized to rear the insect in the laboratory. Insecticidal crystal protein was extracted from Bacillus thuringiensis ssp. tenebrionis grown on the sporulation medium. The specific activity of the insecticidal protein in 50 ml 48 h old culture containing 10 - 9 cells was 2. 5 Î¼g mL- 1. Bioassay was standardized in replicated sets to test the insecticidal property of the toxic protein on Myllocerus larvae by soil drenching and root dip methods. In the soil drenching procedure, the freshly emerged larvae from the egg were transferred to the pots containing the brinjal seedlings, which was treated with 10 mL of 102 to 10 - 4 ng/mL concentrations of Bt toxins. In the root dip method, the root tissue of known size treated with the same concentrations of Bt toxins and dried in air were fed to the larvae. Suitable controls were compared. Mortality was recorded after 24 hours. Lethal concentration of Bt was determined by Probit analysis. The LC 50 values were 2. 69 ng mL- 1 and <b>Fiducial</b> <b>limit</b> was 1. 4 - 511 ng mL- 1. In the root dip method LC 50 value was 44. 936 ng mL- 1 and <b>Fiducial</b> <b>limit</b> was 20. 4 - 110. 5 ng mL-l. Bt toxins (25 ng/mL concentrations) was also tested in Myllocerus infested field of brinjal 'Purple Long'plants in 5 m Ã 5 m replicated plots by soil drenching.

40|$|A gas chromatographic {{method was}} applied to the {{determination}} of the urinary glycine conjugates, hippuric, o-, m- and p-methylhippuric acids. These were extracted with ethyl acetate from urine after acidification with hydrochloric acid. The internal standard solution (heptadecanoic acid methanol solution) was added before extraction and a diazomethane-ether-ethanol solution was subsequently added to the dried extracts. The methylated residues were dissolved in methanol and injected into a gas chromatograph as described by Buchet and Lauwerys (1973). By the combined use of gas chromatography and mass spectrometry the methyl esters of hippuric acid and m-methylhippuric acid were identified in the urine of a volunteer who had been exposed to toluene and m-xylene vapours. When the urine specimen contained salicyluric acid (a urinary metabolite of salicylic acid) two sharp peaks were observed. The faster peak coincided with m- or p-methylhippuric acid. The upper limit of urinary hippuric acid concentration in healthy subjects with no occupational exposure was calculated by this method to be 1. 026 microgram/ml (<b>fiducial</b> <b>limit</b> 5 %) after correction to 1. 024 for variation in urinary density...|$|E

Heterozygotes can be detected by virtue of codominance in all combinations except a few in which bands of single groups are absent (“semi-null” alleles). No recombinations were detected in 7419 F 2 segregants of 53 different combinations of alleles. A maximum <b>fiducial</b> <b>limit</b> (P = 0. 01) of 0. 08 % crossing-over between any Prx- 4 band groups is estimated.

In respect to the origin of these variants, the probability of 18 instances of simultaneous mutation of genes at two loci, always in such complete agreement, is so remote that no more than one locus could conceivably govern b and d. The disposition of a is not similarly associated with that of the other bands, while that of the faint-staining c could not always be reliably resolved. The negation of all save extremely low recombination rates and the observed concomitant variation of b and d strongly support the concept of single locus control of all Prx- 4 banding, this hypothesis being espoused until rejection should be required be required by future research.

The quality of the fitted model was expressed by the R 2, adjusted R-squared (adj. R 2) and predicted R-squared (Pred. R 2) with the respective values of 0.9924, 0.9886 and 0.9768. Good fitted model should have a minimum R 2  =  0.8. The R 2 of approaching 1.0 shows good agreement between the calculated and observed results within the experimental range. The Adj.

At a given time, a direct negative relationship between seed viability and microwave's radiation power level was detected. Substantial variation in the lethality of tested seeds to microwave's power levels was apparent in the <b>fiducial</b> <b>limits</b> of the estimated LD 50 values in probit analysis approach. A similar trend of A. niger spores’ susceptibility to microwave radiation was detected. The microwaves' radiation and exposure time did not impact one another and a significant interaction was not detected. Short term fungal infection did not cause substantial quantitative and qualitative damage to the oilseeds. The oil quality was generally unaffected by microwave radiation and fungal infestation for tested oilseeds. Moreover, microwave radiation decreased seed germination percentage and vigor index. The microwave radiation could provide an effective and friendly environmental treatment technique for improving the dietary consumption of the oil in any seed disinfestation program...|$|R
40|$|Horn fly immatures {{were raised}} in media {{containing}} different concentrations of diflubenzuron in order to verify their susceptibility to this insect growth regulator (IGR). The 50 % and 95 % lethal concentrations of diflubenzuron for the population (LC 50, LC 95) were determined {{as well as the}} effect of this IGR on the different immature horn fly stages. The tests were performed using the progeny of adults collected in the field. The immatures were maintained in a growth chamber at 25. 0 ± 0. 5 oC and 12 - 12 h photoperiod. IGR concentrations of 300 ppb, 100 ppb and 50 ppb were lethal for 100 % of the sample. Pupae malformation occurred in the breeding media containing different diflubenzuron concentrations. Values for LC 50, LC 95 (± 95 % <b>fiducial</b> <b>limits)</b> and the slope of the regression line were respectively, 25. 521 ± 1. 981 ppb, 34. 650 ± 2. 001 ppb and 12. 720 ± 1. 096. The third larval instar was more sensitive to the sub-lethal concentration of the product than the first and second ones were. The results indicate that this IGR can be an important tool for controlling horn fly populations as well as for managing horn fly resistance to conventional insecticides against Haematobia irritans in Uberlândia, State of Minas Gerais...|$|R
40|$|Two C-terminal {{deletion}} constructs {{were made}} to study the effect of such deletions on the biological activity of the CryV protein of Bacillus thuringiensis subsp. kurstaki. The results of feeding on neonatal larvae of Ostrinia nubilalis (European corn borer [ECB]) indicated that the 50 % lethal dose of the full-length CryV protein was 3. 34 micrograms/g of diet (95 % <b>fiducial</b> <b>limits,</b> 2. 53 to 4. 32 micrograms/g of diet). Removal of 71 amino acids (aa) from the C terminus {{had little effect on}} toxicity, whereas deletion of 184 aa abolished the insecticidal activity of the CryV protein completely. Truncations of the full-length CryV protein were also generated with trypsin and the midgut protease of ECB. The proteolytically treated products were characterized by determining their N-terminal amino acid sequences. The CryV protein was found to be cleaved by both proteases through a two-step process. Initially an intermediary form was generated which contained aa 45 of full-length CryV as its N-terminal end. The C-terminal end of this peptide was not experimentally determined. However, analysis of the deduced amino acid sequence of CryV indicated that the C-terminal end of the intermediary form is likely either aa 655 or 659. Further N-terminal processing of the intermediary form resulted in a protease-resistant core form. The core included aa 156 to aa 655 or 659. While the intermediary form retained 100 % of the ECB larval toxicity, the core form exhibited only approximately 22 % of the toxicity of the full-length protein...|$|R
40|$|The mud crab, Panopeus herbstii, was acutely exposed (96 -hr) to chlorine-produced oxidants (CPO), phenol, and a CPO-phenolic mixture (1 : 1) to {{determine}} lethal and sublethal effects. The 96 -hr (LC 50) values were determined {{for each individual}} compound and mixture. Additionally, whole-animal respiration rates were measured following acute exposure to sublethal concentrations of each compound or mixture. Phenol uptake/depuration rates were measured in the phenol and CPO-phenol mixture concentrations. Results indicated 96 -hr LC 50 values of 1. 06 mg/L for CPO (<b>fiducial</b> <b>limits</b> (FL) = 0. 53 - 2. 01 mg/L), 52. 8 mg/L for phenol (FL = 45. 6 - 64. 5 mg/L), and 184. 7 mg/L total toxicant units (TTU) for the CPO-phenol mixture (FL = 143. 7 - 250. 2 mg/L TTU). Statistical analysis indicated that the acute toxicity of the CPO-phenol mixture was less than additive. Sublethal studies indicated that only acute exposure to sublethal concentrations of CPO caused altered respiration rates. After 96 -hr depuration, metabolic rates in all CPO-exposure crabs generally returned to control rates. Uptake/depuration rate studies indicated significantly lower phenol uptake rates in crabs exposed to the CPO-phenol mixture. These {{findings suggest that the}} less-than-additive toxicity of the CPO-phenol mixture may result from lowered uptake/depuration rate kinetics and indicate that the discharge of chlorinated-phenolic waste may not result in additive and/or synergistic interactions, but rather in less-than-additive effects on decapod aquatic species...|$|R
40|$|The {{availability}} of the counting slides devised by Yoshii and by Tawaraguchi was studied using the dark field illumination recommended by Yoshii. The test organism used was Borrelia duttonii. Each of all slides was of Thoma-haemocytometer type and less 2 mm. in thicknes. The Yoshii's slide consisted of two types. The depth of the counting chamber of one type was 0. 020 mm. and that of other was 0. 010 mm The Tawaeaguchi's slide had 0. 010 mm. depth chambers. The results obtained were treated statistically and could be summarized as follows : 1) There {{was no evidence that}} the distribution of borreliaa in any chamber of three types differed significantly from the Poisson distribution. 2) There was no evidence that the sample estimate of mean of 50 replicate counts in these types of chambers differed significantly from one another. 3) The depath of chambers was concluded to excert an influence upon the precision. The value of the coefficent of variation obtained was 9. 97, 14. 97 and 18. 42 by use of 0. 100 mm-, 0. 020 mm- and 0. 010 mm-slide respectively. 4) The numbers of counts needed to obtain the mean with the error less than 0. 10 at the 95 % <b>fiducial</b> <b>limits</b> was estimated as 4 or more in the 0. 100 mm-slide, 9 or more in the 0. 020. mm-slide and 14 or more in the 0. 010 mm-slide respectively...|$|R
40|$|An accurate, highly {{reproducible}} {{and sensitive}} bioassay for melanocyte-stimulating hormone (MSH) using {{the skin of}} Anolis carolinensis in vitro is described. The time taken for green Anolis skin fragments to change to a specific, visually assessed, green-brown color is dose-related, and this forms {{the basis of the}} new assay. The method is simple to perform, and 1 person may assay 20 samples in a day using the dorsal skin from a single adult lizard. The mean dose-response ranges between 48 × 10 - 12 and 375 × 10 - 12 M (38 to 625 pg/ml). Using the assay, α-MSH, β-MSH, ACTH (4 – 10), and ACTH (1 – 10) were equipotent on a molar basis. For repeated bioassay of rat pituitary extracts, the dose-response curves were highly significant, and only 1 of the 9 pituitary dose-response curves deviated significantly from the slope of the standard α-MSH curve. The index of precision, γ, for the 9 pituitary bioassays ranged between 0. 037 and 0. 081, while the mean 95 % <b>fiducial</b> <b>limits</b> were - 6. 6 and 7. 1 % {{on either side of the}} estimated potency. The new rate method is compared with an earlier quantal method which also uses the isolated skin of Anolis carolinensis. The quantal method does not have dose-response characteristics and is therefore less accurate and reproducible than the new method; the coefficient of variation for repeated bioassay of the same pituitary extracts ranged from between 12 to 20 % for the quantal method and between 2. 9 to 5. 7 % for the new rate method...|$|R
40|$|The {{effect of}} {{acrolein}} vapors against carefully aged eggs of Indian meal moth at 27 ± 1 and 17 ± 1 °C at different dosage levels of acrolein over various exposure times was determined. Considerable {{variation in the}} susceptibility of different age groups of eggs was apparent in the <b>fiducial</b> <b>limits</b> of the LD 50 values. At both temperatures and 24 h exposure period, eggs aged 1 - 2 day-old were more tolerant to acrolein than other age groups. In all bioassays, eggs exposed to higher dosages of acrolein developed at smaller rate. This was significant for the eggs, which {{were exposed to the}} highest dosage for 24 h. Increasing the temperature from 17 ± 1 to 27 ± 1 °C greatly increased the efficacy of acrolein. Overall, at 27 ± 1 °C eggs of P. interpunctella were killed by less than one-fourth of the dosage required for control at 17 ± 1 °C. Acrolein achieved 50 % mortality with a dosage of 3. 80 mg L - 1 in 1 - 2 day-old eggs at 27 ± 1 °C. At this temperature hatching was retarded and greatly reduced when eggs aged 1 - 2 day-old were exposed to 32 mg L - 1 of acrolein for the 24 h exposure period. There was no evidence of a hatch delay longer than the time spent under vapors for eggs exposed at 17 ± 1 or 27 ± 1 °C, indicating that some development must have occurred under fumigation...|$|R
40|$|Insulin analogues with {{relatively}} greater effect on hepatic glucose production than peripheral glucose disposal could {{offer a more}} physiological approach {{to the treatment of}} diabetes mellitus. The fact that proinsulin exhibits this property to a minor degree may suggest that analogues with increased molecular size may be less able than insulin to obtain access to peripheral receptor sites. Covalent insulin dimers have previously been shown to possess lower hypoglycaemic potencies than predicted by their in vivo receptor binding affinities. Reduced rates of diffusion to peripheral target tissues might be an explanation for the lower in vivo potency compared to insulin. To test the relative hepatic and peripheral effects of covalent insulin dimers, glucose clamp procedures with D-[3 - 3 H]glucose tracer infusions were used in anaesthetised greyhounds to establish dose-response curves for rates of hepatic glucose production and glucose disposal with insulin, N alpha B 1, N alpha B' 1,-suberoyl-insulin dimer, and N epsilon B 29, N epsilon B' 29,-suberoyl-insulin dimer. With N alpha B 1, N alpha B' 1,-suberoyl-insulin dimer molar potencies relative to insulin were 68 %, (34 - 133) (mean and 95 % <b>fiducial</b> <b>limits),</b> for inhibition of hepatic glucose production and 14. 7 %, (10. 3 - 20. 9) for glucose disposal. With N epsilon B 29,N epsilon B' 29,-suberoyl-insulin dimer potencies were 75 %, (31 - 184) and 2. 5 %. (1. 5 - 4. 3), for inhibition of hepatic glucose production and for glucose disposal, respectively. The demonstration that both dimers exhibit a significantly greater effect on glucose production than on glucose disposal supports the suggestion that analogues with increased molecular size may exhibit reduced ability to gain access to peripheral target cells...|$|R
40|$|The {{effect of}} {{microwaves}} radiation and cold storage against adults of sawtoothed grain beetle, Oryzaephlius surinamensis (L.) over various exposure times and cold storage period was evaluated. The insects {{were exposed to}} 2450 MHz at five different power levels of 0, 100, 200, 300 and 400 W for five exposure times of 0, 3, 6, 9 and 12 min. A complete mortality was achieved for tested insect at 400 W power level for exposure time of 12 min and 72 h cold storage period. At a given time, a direct positive relationship between mortality rates and microwaves radiation power level was obtained. For instance at 100, 200, 300 and 400 W power levels and 24 h cold storage for 3 min exposure period, the mortality rates were 40, 50, 55 and 72 %, respectively. Similar trend was obtained for LT 50 values. Considerable variation in the susceptibility of tested insect to microwaves power levels and cold storage periods was apparent in the <b>fiducial</b> <b>limits</b> of the LD 50 values. In the analysis of variance (ANOVA) the R 2 value revealed that 90. 8 % of variability in the susceptibility of O. surinamensis {{could be explained by}} the microwaves power, cold storage period and exposure duration. Combinations of microwaves radiation and cold storage were found highly compatible and synergistic. This was more significant for the insects which were exposed to the highest level of microwaves radiation and cold storage period. Synergistic interaction indicates that microwaves radiation can be used with cold storage for management of O. surinamensis. This treatment could provide an effective and friendly environmental treatment technique in IPM program...|$|R
