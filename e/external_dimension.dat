40|$|Previous {{work has}} shown that the scaling of {{mechanical}} behaviour in bending of the metathoracic tibiae of the African desert locust (Schistocerca gregaria) is not predicted by the scaling of <b>external</b> <b>dimensions.</b> The flexural stiffness of the tibia scales to (body mass) 1. 53, which is similar to the predictions of the elastic similarity model of scaling. The <b>external</b> <b>dimensions,</b> however, scale in a manner that produces relatively more elongate limb segments – an observation that differs from the predictions of any existing scaling model. In this paper, we examined two alternative hypotheses to explain this uncoupling of morphology and mechanics: (1) that the load-bearing cuticular material is distributed in the legs {{in a manner that is}} not indicated by changes in <b>external</b> <b>dimensions,</b> or (2) that the stiffness of the cuticular material is altered to produce the observed scaling of flexural stiffness. The second moment of area (I) scaled to (body mass) 1. 19, which was similar to scaling I to (tibial radius) 4. This indicates that the relationship between the <b>external</b> <b>dimensions</b> of the tibiae and the specific distribution of load-bearing material is conserved independently of scale. Therefore, the locust achieves the observed scaling of flexural stiffness by altering the modulus of the load-bearing cuticular material. In fact, the time-dependent modulus (E 9) scales to (body mass) 0. 311. In essence, the scaled material stiffness provides a degree of freedom in design in addition to <b>external</b> morphological <b>dimensions</b> in accommodating the changing demands placed on a skeletal structure with increases in body size...|$|R

However, the EEAS is largely influenced by the intergovernmental method, and its involvement in non-CFSP initiatives may perpetuate the intergovernmental approach to the <b>external</b> <b>dimension</b> of the AFSJ...|$|E

40|$|This project {{examines}} why the EU {{is developing}} an <b>external</b> <b>dimension</b> of their asylum policy and which humanitarian consequenses this cause. The project is build on a {{hypothesis that the}} <b>external</b> <b>dimension</b> of the asylum policy is a breach of the etablished rules. This breach can {{be a result of}} a securization of asylum seeker’s and refugee’s. To investigate whether the development of the externel dimension of EU’s asylum policy is an expression of a securization, the discource and legislation is analysed. The analysis conclude the conflicting result that the <b>external</b> <b>dimension</b> is breaking the rules of the refugee convention, but that asylum seeker’s and refugee’s haven’t been represented as a threat. In spite of this the context that asylum seeker’s and refugee’s are situated in can constitute a discource whereby the object is securized anyway. In addition to that the lacking media coverage of EU politician’s can imply that they can lead a policy that is different to the one that was represented. The ekstraterritorialization lead to a number of consequenses, partly because the right to seek asylum is restricted and partly because the quality of protection that is provided towards refugee’s is reduced...|$|E
40|$|The thesis {{examines}} how the European Commission incorporated and implemented migration policy {{as part of}} the European Union’s external relations, also known as the <b>external</b> <b>dimension</b> of migration. The focus of the thesis is on the period between the coming into force of the Amsterdam Treaty in 1999, when migration largely came to fall under the Commission’s remit, and the ratification of the Lisbon Treaty in 2009. The study compares how the Commission’s Directorates-General (DGs) involved in the <b>external</b> <b>dimension</b> of migration during this period—Justice, Liberty and Security, External Relations and Development—made sense of the changes introduced to their responsibilities. The thesis proposes that the concept of organisational culture, drawn from organisational sociology, can explain how actors interact with and collectively make sense of their organisational environment. The main argument of the thesis is that each of the DGs possesses an organisational culture based on its members’ shared readings of priorities and the function of their unit. The thesis examines these divergent organisational cultures to gauge how policies are internalised and translated into output. The analysis contributes to the external governance literature, which has theorised the <b>external</b> <b>dimension</b> of migration as a continuation of European integration processes without accounting for internal organisational dynamics. It also leads to reflections on organisational sociology theorising, and the implications of the findings on studies of organisational change and implementation. This thesis is divided into five chapters. The first provides a background for how the Commission came to be involved in migration policy. The second provides a theoretical framework for the study, building on organisational sociology. The remaining chapters empirically analyse the three elements of organisational culture: DG members’ sources of organisational identity, their perceptions and prioritisations of the <b>external</b> <b>dimension</b> of migration, and their reading of the Commission’s implementation practices, focusing on relations with Morocco as a tool for illustrating the latter...|$|E
