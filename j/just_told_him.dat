25|$|Australia {{had less}} than {{three and a half}} hours to bowl England out for victory and their spinners gave them 50 overs to do so. Bob Barber hit 34 off 37 balls with 3 fours and a six, but Geoff Boycott carried his bat through to stumps with 63 not out. Boycott pushed a ball from Peter Philpott away with his hand during his innings, but Brian Booth refused to appeal for handled the ball and Wally Grout <b>just</b> <b>told</b> <b>him</b> not to do it again. John Edrich (37) and Ken Barrington (38) also hit sixes and Mike Smith saw out the last half hour as England made 186/3 to ensure a draw.|$|E
25|$|Major Remington then {{ordered his}} squad {{to charge the}} Confederate force, which Dagwell had <b>just</b> <b>told</b> <b>him</b> must be an entire brigade of Confederate cavalry and had {{correctly}} estimated as being a minimum of 2,000 men. The advance Confederates broke {{into the woods and}} Dagwell followed, only to soon find that he was alone. When he came out to the point the New Yorkers had formed their line, he found only five Union men but also saw several dead and wounded Confederates, including a dead Confederate major beside the road. Major John H. Whitaker, commander of the 1st North Carolina Cavalry was killed during the action. Sergeant Charles A. Hartwell stated that the New Yorkers killed 5 Confederates and took 14 prisoners in the initial action. Hartwell soon found himself with about a dozen men, including Major Remington, cut off from the other Union troops. Remington and a few others, including Sergeant H. O. Morris, in the face of overwhelming numbers, had retreated from the nearby hill to which Remington had moved most of the men after their initial charge. When he saw the Union movement, Hampton thought they were trying to position themselves to attack the rear of his force and sent a squadron to outflank them, virtually surrounding the majority of the Union men. Sergeant Morris shot a Confederate officer who assaulted Major Remington during the melee that ensued during the fight for escape of the New Yorkers not trapped on the hill.|$|E

I <b>just</b> <b>told</b> <b>him</b> to settle down, {{everything was going to be}} all right." [...] Hillcourt presented an alternative to Larson's plan to incorporate leadership into Wood Badge. Chief Scout Brunton asked Larson to look at Hillcourt's plan, and Larson reported back that it was the same camping-oriented skills content, just reordered and rewritten.

500|$|The {{friction}} between Shea and Marshall, which had begun when Shea was at OMSF, continued after {{he moved to}} his new position. He became deeply involved in supporting George Mueller's effort to impose the idea of [...] "all up" [...] testing of the Saturn V rocket on the unwilling engineers at Marshall. Von Braun's approach to engineering was a conservative one, emphasizing the incremental testing of components. But the tight schedule of the Apollo program didn't allow for this slow and careful process. What Mueller and Shea proposed was to test the Saturn V as one unit on its very first flight, and Marshall only reluctantly came to accept this approach in late 1963. When later asked how he and Mueller had managed to sell the idea to von Braun, Shea responded that [...] "we <b>just</b> <b>told</b> <b>him</b> that's the way it's going to be, finally." ...|$|E
2500|$|Walker's mother {{explained}} {{her attitude}} towards her son's killers, saying [...] "I have to forgive them. [...] I can't feel anger and hatred, {{because that is}} what killed my son". However, Walker's girlfriend Louise, who was present on the night of his murder, said she never would forgive them adding, [...] "I hate them for what they have done. Anthony and I shared something special. Now he has been taken away from me by those two evil young men. I still feel that he (Anthony Walker) is around. Yesterday, I sent Anthony a text and <b>just</b> <b>told</b> <b>him</b> he (Barton) had been found guilty. It seemed the natural thing to do." ...|$|E

Rina is a very emotional person and depends a lot on Masashi (as Yuna) for support and guidance.|$|R
60|$|At {{that very}} instant Peter looked up {{just in time}} to see a tail disappearing in the little round hole in the side of the bunch of moss. He knew that that tail belonged to Mrs. Sprite, and <b>just</b> that glimpse <b>told</b> <b>him</b> all he wanted to know.|$|R
60|$|And she, {{warm with}} what Dick had <b>just</b> <b>told</b> of <b>him,</b> pleasured at the goodly sight of him, {{dwelling}} {{with her eyes}} on the light, high poise of head, the careless, sun-sanded hair, and the lightness, almost debonaireness, of his carriage despite his weight of body and breadth of shoulders. As he drew near to her, she centered her gaze on the long gray eyes whose hint of drooping lids hinted of boyish sullenness. She waited for the expression of sullenness to vanish as the eyes lighted with the smile she had come to know so well.|$|R
2500|$|The {{fourth day}} of the {{competition}} had started earlier with another withdrawal, as fifth seed and 2007 Masters Cup semifinalist Andy Roddick announced he was {{pulling out of the}} event, after injuring his ankle during a practice session on the previous day. [...] "Yesterday in the warm-up during practice I just went over on it. [...] We tried the best we could to get it better but I can't really stop and start on it very quickly." [...] commented Roddick. The American's withdrawal allowed 26th-ranked Radek Štěpánek, who accepted the invitation to Shanghai as first alternate, after sixteen players ranked above him, and below last qualifier Gilles Simon, refused to come to the Masters Cup. Roddick said he had called Štěpánek, before deciding not to play, to tell him he might enter the competition : [...] "I called Štěpánek earlier today to let him know where my head was at, and then <b>just</b> <b>told</b> <b>him</b> when I came off the practice court. So he knew as early as anybody else." [...] Štěpánek's unexpected appearance (Murray had commented [...] "Štěpánek's turned up without his own racquets, he borrowed some socks off me earlier and he hasn't got his contact lenses either") marked the Czech's first career participation to the year-end championships.|$|E
2500|$|In early 1939, Gromyko {{started working}} for the People's Commissariat for Foreign Affairs in Moscow. Gromyko became the Head of the Department of Americas and because of his {{position}} Gromyko met with United States ambassador to the Soviet Union Lawrence Steinhardt. Gromyko believed Steinhardt to be [...] "totally uninterested in creating good relations between the US and the USSR" [...] and that Steinhardt's predecessor Joseph Davies was more [...] "colourful" [...] and seemed [...] "genuinely interested" [...] in improving {{the relations between the}} two countries. Davies received the Order of Lenin for his work in trying to improve diplomatic relations between the US and the USSR. After heading the Americas department for 6 months, Gromyko was called upon by Joseph Stalin. Stalin started the conversation by telling Gromyko that he would be sent to the Soviet embassy in the United States to become second-in-command. [...] "The Soviet Union," [...] Stalin said, [...] "should maintain reasonable relations with such a powerful country like the United States, {{especially in light of the}} growing fascist threat". Vyacheslav Molotov contributed with some minor modifications but mostly agreed with what Stalin had said. [...] "How are your English skills improving?," [...] Stalin asked, [...] "Comrade Gromyko you should pay a visit or two to an American church and listen to their sermons. Priests usually speak correct English with good accents. Do you know that the Russian revolutionaries when they were abroad, always followed this practice to improve their skills in foreign languages?" [...] Gromyko was quite amazed about what Stalin had <b>just</b> <b>told</b> <b>him</b> but he never visited an American church.|$|E
2500|$|National {{media outlets}} {{reported}} on an exchange between judge Harry Connick Jr. and contestant Quentin Alexander noting the incident of Connick scolding a contestant was awkward. On the live airing of the Top 6 show, there was three contestants {{who had not}} been saved when Alexander was chosen. After he performed, host Ryan Seacrest noted that he appeared to be upset. When asked Alexander responded [...] "This sucks, We've got two of the best vocalists, my best friend [...] sitting over there. This whole thing is whack, but I'm going to shut up right now." [...] Seacrest then replied saying that this is a competition, and with the save anything could happen. When Alexander had left the stage, Connick Jr. said, [...] "Quentin, if it's that whack, then you can always go home, because Idol is paying {{a lot of money to}} give you this experience and for you to say that to this hand that is feeding you right now, I think is highly disrespectful." [...] Alexander was then prompted by the producers to return to the stage where he approached the judges and clarified he meant the two being potentially eliminated was whack, not the show, or the experience. Later, after performing his second song, he explained [...] "I understand that these things are going to happen, and I just didn't want my friend to leave" [...] and apologized. Judge Jennifer Lopez empathized with Alexander's emotions running high but said that as an artist he had to learn to work through that even when it happens to put on the performance. Joey Cook commented after being eliminated on Alexander's statements: I pretty much <b>just</b> <b>told</b> <b>him</b> what he did was beautiful, in my opinion, and it was the perfect representation of him. Quentin is a very emotional person. He’s very 'all cards on the table.' There is no sugar coating. He doesn’t hide his emotions. He’s honest. He’s a raw human being, and I think what happened last night was the perfect example of that and how emotional of a person he is.|$|E

And he was so amazing because there's a lot of producers you tell them things and they don't get it. And you're like oh, that's not the right way. He got it just right. He was amazing. And so that song specifically, you know, I did everything." ...|$|R

When Labaw Donggon expressed his desire to have Saragnayan's young wife, Malitong Yawa Sinagmaling Diwata, the Lord of Darkness <b>just</b> laughed and <b>told</b> <b>him</b> it was impossible.

50|$|The {{novel is}} a first-person {{narrative}} {{told by the}} journalist Piet Maas. He refers to his troubled past when, following {{the collapse of a}} magazine he'd set up and his discovery of his girlfriend's infidelity, he tried to kill himself. As the novel progresses, though, he reveals himself as a tough, imaginative and resourceful planner of complicated arrangements. Early in the novel Lucia's former conman partner, Philip Sanger, had speculated that Piet, dispensing with his past anger at his business failure and at his unfaithful girlfriend, was now driven by 'a new kind of anger', anger against Lucia's enemies. Towards {{the end of the book}} Sanger revises his opinion. He now thinks that what drives Piet isn't new but as old as the hills: he has discovered his vocation as a crook. Following his suicide attempt, instead of prescribing pills and electro-shock treatment, his psychiatrists should <b>just</b> have <b>told</b> <b>him</b> to go rob a bank.|$|R
60|$|That {{evening the}} doctor {{of the royal}} {{household}} was summoned by an affrighted servitor to the apartment of Gadarn, who had been overheard choking.

The exasperated man leaped up intending to kick the doctor out, but, changing his mind, he kicked the horrified servitor out instead, and, taking the doctor into his confidence, related to him an anecdote which had <b>just</b> been <b>told</b> to <b>him</b> by Bladud.|$|R

The discovery of Jimmy with Molly had lent an added significance to that piece of news. He {{saw that he had}} been rough.

60|$|She {{meant to}} take Maso {{with her as}} far as Bologna, and then send him back with letters to her godfather and Tito, telling them that she was gone and never meant to return.

Bernardo del Nero had been absent at his villa, willing to escape from political suspicions to his favourite occupation of attending to his land, and she had paid him the debt without a personal interview. He {{did not even know}} that the library was sold, and was left to conjecture that some sudden piece of good fortune had enabled Tito to raise this sum of money. Maso had been taken into her confidence only so far that he knew her intended journey was a secret; and to do <b>just</b> what she <b>told</b> <b>him</b> was the thing he cared most for in his withered wintry age.|$|R

It is presumed the Red is trying to recruit her but the reason why is unknown; presumably also, her red hair and nickname [...] "Red" [...] has been a long-term hint about this in the same way Q's trench coats tied into the Green.
