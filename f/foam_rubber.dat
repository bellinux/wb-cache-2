5|$|Principal {{photography}} for Titanic {{began in}} July 1996 at Dartmouth, Nova Scotia, with {{the filming of}} the modern day expedition scenes aboard the Akademik Mstislav Keldysh. In September 1996, the production moved to the newly built Fox Baja Studios in Rosarito, Mexico, where a full scale RMS Titanic had been constructed. The poop deck was built on a hinge which could rise from zero to 90 degrees in a few seconds, just as the ship's stern rose during the sinking. For {{the safety of the}} stuntmen, many props were made of <b>foam</b> <b>rubber.</b> By November 15, the boarding scenes were being shot. Cameron chose to build his RMS Titanic on the starboard side as a study of weather data revealed it was a prevailing north-to-south wind which blew the funnel smoke aft. This posed a problem for shooting the ship's departure from Southampton, as it was docked on its port side. Implementation of written directions, as well as props and costumes, had to be reversed; for example, if someone walked to their right in the script, they had to walk left during shooting. In post-production, the film was flipped to the correct direction.|$|E
5|$|The use of {{live animals}} to {{represent}} the tribbles was immediately ruled out. According to Gerrold's account, {{the inspiration for the}} form of the tribble instead came from a fluffy keyring owned by Holly Sherman. Sherman's Planet in this episode was subsequently named after her. The design came from Wah Chang, but they were individually sewn by Jacqueline Cumeré. She was paid $350 to sew five hundred tribbles from synthetic fur and stuff them with <b>foam</b> <b>rubber.</b> Six ambulatory tribbles were made using the mechanisms of walking toy dogs, which were quite noisy and required the dialogue to be looped in during editing. Other tribbles were created by Jim Rugg out of beanbags for when it was required for one to sit on a person or object, and the breathing tribbles were hollow with surgical balloons inserted. Some of these tribbles were later displayed at the Smithsonian National Air and Space Museum in Washington D.C. in 1992. The sale at Christie's auction house in 2006 included tribbles from this episode {{as part of a larger}} Star Trek sale. Because of the synthetic fur technology of the 1960s, relatively few original tribbles exist as of 2010 because the fur fell out over time and they went bald. An original tribble was sold at auction in 2003 for $1,000.|$|E
40|$|AbstractFoamed rubbers {{are widely}} used for the shoe-soles, shin-guards, protectors and so on. The complex {{microstructure}} of <b>foamed</b> <b>rubber</b> consists of rubber matrix and pores. Therefore, <b>foamed</b> <b>rubbers</b> show good shock-absorbing properties in addition to good formability and lightweight. The mechanical characteristics of <b>foamed</b> <b>rubber</b> {{are determined by the}} mechanical characteristics of rubber matrix and its microstructure. In this study, a homogenization numerical analysis of mechanical characteristics of <b>foamed</b> <b>rubber</b> considering the rubber matrix and microstructure was shown. In order to develop the evaluation method, the microstructure of the <b>foamed</b> <b>rubber</b> was assumed to have the periodical holes, and a homogenization FEM code for formed rubber was developed based on homogenization theory with hyperelasticity. To verify the applicability of our developed code, rectangular rubber specimens with periodically holes were prepared to observe stress distributions of periodical inner structure. Incompressible hyperelasticity was applied to the rubber matrix. The material parameters of hyperelasticity for rubber matrix were identified by the biaxial tensile test results. Compression test of the rubber specimen reproducing FEM model was conducted to verify the applicability of the analysis code. The analysis result showed good agreement with the compression test result in the low strain region...|$|R

25|$|Polyurethane foam (including <b>foam</b> <b>rubber)</b> is {{sometimes}} made using {{small amounts of}} blowing agents to give less dense foam, better cushioning/energy absorption or thermal insulation. In the early 1990s, because of their impact on ozone depletion, the Montreal Protocol restricted the use of many chlorine-containing blowing agents, such as trichlorofluoromethane (CFC-11). By the late 1990s, blowing agents such as carbon dioxide, pentane, 1,1,1,2-tetrafluoroethane (HFC-134a) and 1,1,1,3,3-pentafluoropropane (HFC-245fa) were widely used in North America and the EU, although chlorinated blowing agents remained in use in many developing countries.|$|E
30|$|In {{order to}} study the {{properties}} of rubber sound-absorbing materials, this study analyzed the production process of rubber materials and obtained the following results: This study investigated the effect of carbon black on the damping properties of <b>foamed</b> EPDM <b>rubber.</b> The results show {{that only a small}} amount of carbon black will increase the damping performance, and the addition of carbon black will result in a decrease in sound absorption performance. The more carbon black added, the more obvious the sound absorption performance decreases. At the same time, this study discussed the effect of filler types on the damping properties of carbon black reinforced <b>foamed</b> EPDM <b>rubber.</b> It was found that Gd 2 O 3 -filled carbon black reinforced <b>foamed</b> EPDM <b>rubber</b> has the best damping performance and sound absorption performance; Y 2 O 3 -, CeO 2 -, and La 2 O 3 -filled <b>foamed</b> EPDM <b>rubber</b> has poor sound absorption performance; and inorganic filler CaCO 3 -filled <b>foamed</b> EPDM <b>rubber</b> has the worst sound absorption performance. This study investigated the effect of filler loading on the sound absorption properties of carbon black reinforced <b>foamed</b> EPDM <b>rubber.</b> The results show that the effect of the filler on the sound absorption properties of the <b>foamed</b> EPDM <b>rubber</b> is generally the more the filler is used. The worse the sound absorption effect, the best sound absorption effect when the filler dosage is 10 phr. In addition, this study investigated the effect of material thickness on the sound absorption properties of carbon black reinforced <b>foamed</b> EPDM <b>rubber.</b> The results show that the thicker the <b>foamed</b> EPDM <b>rubber,</b> the better its sound absorption performance. When the thickness of the <b>foamed</b> EPDM <b>rubber</b> is 60  mm, the maximum sound absorption coefficient is 0.66 at 400  Hz, and the effective sound absorption band is 250 to 2000  Hz.|$|R
30|$|The {{effect of}} filler type on the damping {{properties}} of carbon black reinforcing <b>foamed</b> EPDM <b>rubber</b> {{is shown in}} Fig. 8. Among them, {{the amount of carbon}} black is 10 phr, and the amount of filler is 20 phr. It can be seen from Fig. 8 a that after the addition of the rare earth oxide filler, the storage modulus of the <b>foamed</b> EPDM <b>rubber</b> decreases rapidly, and the fastest decline in the storage modulus is the Gd 2 O 3 -filled <b>foamed</b> EPDM <b>rubber.</b> When Y 2 O 3, CeO 2, and La 2 O 3 are filled with <b>foamed</b> EPDM <b>rubber,</b> the difference of storage modulus is small, and the addition of inorganic filler CaCO 3 has little effect on the storage modulus of <b>foamed</b> EPDM <b>rubber.</b> It can be seen from Fig. 8 b that the Gd 2 O 3 -filled <b>foamed</b> EPDM <b>rubber</b> has the highest loss peak, the maximum loss factor value is 1.5  MPa at −[*] 20  °C, and the effective damping temperature range is −[*] 65  °C to 20  °C. Followed by Y 2 O 3 -, CeO 2 -, CaCO 3 -, and La 2 O 3 -filled <b>foamed</b> EPDM <b>rubber,</b> the damping effect is the worst. This phenomenon may be caused {{by the fact that the}} rare earth filler is a rigid particle, and the energy generated by the vibration generates more heat in the <b>foamed</b> EPDM <b>rubber</b> than the rigid particle, which causes a further increase in internal friction. The poor damping performance of La 2 O 3 may be due to its poor compatibility with the EPDM rubber matrix, resulting in a large amount of agglomeration, resulting in reduced damping performance.|$|R

Several of the models were originally built for Creation and sometimes two or three models were built of individual species. Prolonged exposure to studio lights wreaked havoc with the latex skin so John Cerasoli carved wooden duplicates of each model to be used as stand-ins for test shoots and lineups.

25|$|For {{the first}} time since 1940 Oldsmobile offered totally {{different}} styling during a single model year. The top of the line 1948 Oldsmobile 98 drew heavily from the Futuramic styling concept that would be used on all 1949 Oldsmobiles. Standard equipment on 98s included a solenoid starter, fender skirts, E-Z-l rearview mirror, and <b>foam</b> <b>rubber</b> seat cushions. The 98s also included front and rear bumper guards, vacuum booster pump, plastic radiator ornament, dual horns, dual sun visors, and cigarette lighter.

25|$|Giger's {{original}} {{design for the}} facehugger was a much larger creature with eyes and a spring-loaded tail. Later, in response to comments from the filmmakers, Giger reduced the creature's size substantially. At first, Giger assumed that the facehugger would wrap around {{the outside of the}} astronaut's helmet, but Scott decided that it would have far more impact if the facehugger were revealed once the helmet was removed. Scott and Giger realised that the facehugger should burn through the helmet's faceplate with its acid blood; subsequent redesigns of the space helmet included a far larger faceplate to allow for this. Dan O'Bannon initially conceived the facehugger as somewhat resembling an octopus, possessing tentacles. However, when he received H. R. Giger's designs, which substituted tentacles with fingerlike digits, he found Giger's design concept to be superior. Since no one was available at the time, O'Bannon decided to design the facehugger prop himself. The technical elements of the musculature and bone were added by Ron Cobb. Giger's initial design for the smaller facehugger had the fingers facing forward, but O'Bannon's redesign shifted the legs to the side. When the <b>foam</b> <b>rubber</b> sculpture of the facehugger was produced, O'Bannon asked that it should remain unpainted, believing the rubber, which resembled human skin, was more plausible.|$|E
500|$|Prior to the 1999 Chi-Chi {{earthquake}} in Nantou County, Taiwan, little information {{was available for}} estimating ground motion that resulted from large (greater than M7) thrust earthquakes, and whether the values seen in that event are commonplace remains unresolved. <b>Foam</b> <b>rubber</b> modeling, numerical modeling, and field {{studies have shown that}} intense ground motions close to 1g are possible on the [...] hanging wall side of the fault during some large thrust earthquakes.

40|$|One of new {{innovation}} in modified concrete is <b>foamed</b> concrete containing <b>rubber</b> bars. The function of <b>rubber</b> on <b>foamed</b> concrete {{is to improve}} the strength and enhance the resistance toward high strain rate loadings.

30|$|The {{effect of}} the amount of carbon black on the SEM {{photograph}} of the <b>foamed</b> EPDM <b>rubber</b> is shown in Fig.  7. It {{can be seen from the}} figure that when carbon black is used to reinforce <b>foamed</b> EPDM <b>rubber,</b> the cells are larger, and when the amount of carbon black is 10 phr, more cells are formed, and the walls of the holes are thicker, but uneven. As the amount of carbon black increases, the structure of the cells begins to deteriorate and gradually forms a pore phenomenon. When the amount of carbon black is more than 30 phr, the cells collapse, most of the cells produce a parallel pore phenomenon, and there are major defects, and the pore walls are also thinner and thinner, which eventually leads to only a small amount of closed-cell foam inside the <b>foamed</b> EPDM <b>rubber.</b> At the same time, a large number of parallel pore foams cause gas to escape and the damping sound absorption performance is degraded.|$|R

30|$|The {{effect of}} {{different}} vulcanization {{time on the}} damping properties of <b>foamed</b> EPDM <b>rubber</b> is shown in Fig. 5, where the vulcanization temperature is 165  °C. It {{can be seen from}} Fig.  5 a that the <b>foamed</b> EPDM <b>rubber</b> has the largest storage modulus when the vulcanization time is 15  min. At other curing times, the storage modulus is not much different. This is because when the vulcanization time reaches 15  min, the vulcanization rate is already fast, the degree of crosslinking is already high, but the foaming is still in the early stage, and the gas pressure generated by the decomposition of the blowing agent is mostly insufficient to open the cross-linked EPDM rubber matrix, so that the cells are difficult to form. At this time, the <b>foamed</b> EPDM <b>rubber</b> has a small internal cell and a small number. When the vulcanization time is 20  min, at this time, the vulcanization rate of the <b>foamed</b> EPDM <b>rubber</b> is close to that of vulcanization at 15  min, but the foaming agent is decomposed in a large amount, and the internal pressure generated is too large, which breaks the cross-linking, and finally forms many cells. Thereafter, when the vulcanization time is 25  min, 30  min, and 35  min, the vulcanization rate and the foaming speed are both fast, the foaming and vulcanization reach a dynamic balance, and a large number of cells having a uniform pore diameter are produced [17].|$|R
