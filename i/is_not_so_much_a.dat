25|$|Critics also {{dispute the}} claim that Centering Prayer is in the {{tradition}} of the Desert Fathers and Carmelite saints, saying that traditional Catholic contemplative prayer <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>so</b> <b>much</b> <b>a</b> method of prayer as a stage of prayer in which God's action predominates. They cite the Catechism of the Catholic Church as evidence that meditation and contemplation are two different expressions of prayer.|$|E

500|$|Smash Hits {{rated the}} album 8 out of 10 {{and called it}} [...] "quite human and {{therefore}} the most enjoyable of the lot". In {{a review of the}} 1999 re-release of the album, Vincent L. of Krinein Magazine praised the entire record because it contains [...] "catchy tracks and joyful melodies". Napster's Nicholas Baker liked the album's composition and concluded [...] "this LP <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>so</b> <b>much</b> <b>a</b> guilty pleasure as an essential point in electropop history." [...] Metro Pulses Anthony Nownes found the tunes [...] "punchy, memorable" [...] and [...] "accessible", concluding his review with [...] "If all rock records sounded like this—shiny and slick and highly processed—the world would be terrible.

500|$|According to Dean Biron of Overland, [...] "Nightcrawler is a {{shattering}} {{critique of}} both modern-day media practice and consumer culture." [...] Throughout the film, Nina sensationalizes news headlines {{in an attempt}} to increase viewership. PopMatters Jon Lisi believes that, because of Nina's actions, the film specifically targets journalists who exaggerate headlines in order to combat a decline in viewership. Ed Rampell of The Progressive offers similar commentary, stating: [...] "Nightcrawler contends that ethnic and class biases are used to determine what is, and is not, deemed 'worthy' of news coverage. Local politics and related matters that actually affect viewers' lives get short shrift." [...] As much as the film indicts modern journalism, Nightcrawler director Dan Gilroy noted that his goal was for audiences to realize that by watching sensationalized news stories, they themselves are encouraging unethical journalism. Biron argues that Lou's character in the film is created because of consumer demand, and that he is a [...] "reflection of the symbiotic relationship between commercial imperatives and audience desire". Some critics argue that Nightcrawler <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>so</b> <b>much</b> <b>a</b> critique of journalism, but instead a depiction of Lou's entitlement.|$|E
500|$|Another {{important}} {{theme in}} many of García Márquez's work is {{the setting of the}} village he calls Macondo. He uses his home town of Aracataca, Colombia as a cultural, historical and geographical reference to create this imaginary town, but the representation of the village is not limited to this specific area. García Márquez shares, [...] "Macondo <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>so</b> <b>much</b> <b>a</b> place as a state of mind, which allows you to see what you want, and how you want to see it." [...] Even when his stories do not take place in Macondo, there is often still a consistent lack of specificity to the location. So while they are often set with [...] "a Caribbean coastline and an Andean hinterland... otherwise unspecified, in accordance with García Márquez's evident attempt to capture a more general regional myth rather than give a specific political analysis." [...] This fictional town has become well known in the literary world. As Stavans notes of Macondo, [...] "its geography and inhabitants constantly invoked by teachers, politicians, and tourist agents..." [...] makes it [...] "...hard to believe it is a sheer fabrication." [...] In Leaf Storm García Márquez depicts the realities of the Banana Boom in Macondo, which include a period of great wealth during the presence of the US companies and a period of depression upon the departure of the American banana companies. As well, One Hundred Years of Solitude takes place in Macondo and tells the complete history of the fictional town from its founding to its doom.|$|E

2500|$|Based {{upon this}} perspective, ontotheology <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>so</b> <b>much</b> <b>a</b> {{problem to be}} {{overcome}} as it is an inevitability of thought that is impossible to be avoided and that conditions all human inquiry, whether theological or philosophical in nature, or whether religious or secular in orientation.

2500|$|In 1995, Harvey Cox, {{the liberal}} Harvard theologian, wrote that Regent {{has been called}} [...] "the Harvard of the Christian Right" [...] but noted that [...] "Regent, it appears, <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>so</b> <b>much</b> <b>a</b> boot camp for rightist cadres as a {{microcosm}} of the theological and intellectual turbulence within what is often mistakenly seen as a monolithic 'religious right' in America".|$|E

She <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>so</b> <b>much</b> <b>a</b> {{woman to be}} unmasked as an unending combination of masks". It is notable that her name is not mentioned in tax or church records.

2500|$|During the Fifties, Hefti didn't get as {{much respect}} as a {{musician}} and band leader as he did as composer and arranger.

[...] This disparity <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>so</b> <b>much</b> <b>a</b> reflection of Hefti's ability (or lack thereof) as a musician, as it is a reflection of his focus as a writer.

2500|$|Thinking, however, <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>so</b> <b>much</b> <b>a</b> {{substitute}} for the earlier processes as a subsidiary addition to them. It only pays in certain cases, and intelligence may be shown also by discerning what they are {{and when it is}} wiser to act without thinking. [...] Philosophers, however, have very mistaken ideas about rational action. They tend to think that men ought to think all the time, and about all things. But if they did this they would get nothing done, and shorten their lives without enhancing their merriment. Also they utterly misconceive the nature of rational action. They represent it as consisting in the perpetual use of universal rules, whereas it consists rather in perceiving when a general rule must be set aside in order that conduct may be adapted to a particular case.|$|E
2500|$|Another primary {{disagreement}} with Freud stemmed from their differing {{concepts of the}} unconscious. Jung saw Freud's theory of the unconscious as incomplete and unnecessarily negative and inelastic. According to Jung, Freud conceived the unconscious solely as a repository of repressed emotions and desires. Jung's observations overlap to an extent with Freud's model of the unconscious, what Jung called the [...] "personal unconscious", but his hypothesis is more about a process than a static model and he also proposed {{the existence of a}} second, overarching form of the unconscious beyond the personal, that he named the psychoid – a term borrowed from Driesch, but with a somewhat altered meaning. The collective unconscious, <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>so</b> <b>much</b> <b>a</b> 'geographical location', but a deduction from the alleged ubiquity of archetypes over space and time. Freud had actually mentioned a collective level of psychic functioning but saw it primarily as an appendix {{to the rest of the}} psyche.|$|E

At the end of 1993, the company revealed that it was heading for a pre-tax loss in the 199293 fiscal year instead of the expected profit. Chairman and chief executive Clive Leach was sacked as a consequence. According to Variety, YTT [...] "oversold its airtime to advertisers and failed to meet its ratings targets, resulting in a huge revenue shortfall estimated by analysts at over $20million." [...] The industry newspaper also reported that the company [...] "attempted to bolster its flagging 1992-93 revenues by giving advertisers deep discounts for advance airtime bookings made for the following year." [...] Local MP Peter Mandelson wrote to the Secretary of State for National Heritage, David Mellor, in June 1992, saying [...] "Yorkshire and Tyne Tees are motivated by the interests of their shareholders, not their viewers, and need to make urgent savings ... it is quite clear that this <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>so</b> <b>much</b> <b>a</b> merger but a gobbling up of a smaller franchise held by a larger company." ...|$|E
