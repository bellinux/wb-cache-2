5|$|Darla {{appears in}} twenty Angel episodes, mainly as an evil antagonist. The {{character}} {{is known for}} dying {{the most in the}} Buffy The Vampire Slayer franchise. Benz later emphasized: I just didn't know how it was going to happen. So when they sent me the script —which I basically had to sign my life away to read—I was sitting in my trailer and I just started to cry. I thought it was such a beautiful ending, it was the payoff and just really brought her whole life kind of to that one moment. So I was really upset my last day of filming because <b>I</b> <b>really</b> <b>thought</b> it was over to me.|$|E
500|$|Moa {{stated that}} [...] "this {{is the first}} album that <b>I</b> <b>really</b> <b>thought</b> about what I wanted ... I wanted to keep [...] simple in structure, concentrating on the {{layering}} of vocals and guitars." [...] With Love in Motion, Moa moved away from her traditional pop and country pop sound to a pop rock environment. She intentionally changed the sound, through alterations in production and engineering, rather than the writing style. Moa told co-producer Andre Upston that she wanted the album to sound [...] "dirty and gritty." ...|$|E
500|$|In 1904, Edwin S. Porter {{directed}} a film entitled Capture of the [...] "Yegg" [...] Bank Burglars, distributed by Edison Studios. Filmed in August and September of that year, the film features {{a group of}} robbers who execute a heist. Porter had been motivated to produce it by The Bold Bank Robbery. A man from Belleville, Ontario, who held screenings of The Bold Bank Robbery and paired it with other films in the crime genre, once screened the films at a fair. The man {{was surprised by the}} ovation received from the audience, writing that [...] "The applause was something amazing. <b>I</b> <b>really</b> <b>thought</b> the grandstand had collapsed." ...|$|E
60|$|I {{answered}} that I {{had thought it}} was later. Not that <b>I</b> had <b>really</b> <b>thought</b> so, but because my conversational powers were effectually scattered.|$|R
6000|$|Wayland {{extended}} his hand impulsively. [...] "Of course I'll stay. <b>I</b> never <b>really</b> <b>thought</b> of leaving." [...] In the grip of McFarlane's hand was something warm and tender.|$|R
5000|$|In Hillmer's own words: [...] "My {{approach}} to architecture was as an art. The approach {{of most other}} architects is as a business. <b>I</b> never <b>really</b> <b>thought</b> {{about how much money}} I was getting." ...|$|R
500|$|The {{album was}} {{recorded}} {{in the basement of}} the Capitol Records Building in Hollywood. [...] Although Kiedis had recently become clean, his withdrawal symptoms increased and affected his musical contributions to the group. After fifty days of sobriety, Kiedis decided to take drugs again as a one-time attempt to celebrate his new music, which led to his resumed addiction. The recording process for the album became difficult as Kiedis would often disappear to seek drugs. [...] Beinhorn recalled that [...] "There were points in pre-production where <b>I</b> <b>really</b> <b>thought</b> the record wasn't gonna get made." [...] Kiedis felt [...] "excruciating pain and guilt and shame" [...] when he would miss a recording session so he would try to write lyrics while searching for drugs; although the band was upset by his drug use and frequent disappearances, they were impressed with his musical output at the time.|$|E
500|$|American singer Christina Aguilera rose to {{prominence}} {{with the success}} of her 1999 self-titled debut album. It topped the US Billboard 200 and was certified eight times platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America. It produced three Billboard Hot 100 number-one singles: [...] "Genie in a Bottle", [...] "What a Girl Wants", and [...] "Come On Over Baby (All I Want Is You)". Despite the success, Aguilera was displeased with being marketed as her then-manager Steve Kurtz desired, and felt unable to control her image. She told The Sydney Morning Herald her dissatisfaction with being a part of the late 1990s teen pop trend, [...] "The label [...] wanted to push the cookie-cutter, [...] almost virginal kind of imagery that wasn't me," [...] Aguilera said. [...] "I really wanted to squirm away from that, because <b>I</b> <b>really</b> <b>thought</b> it was really fake and superficial and untrue of what I was about." ...|$|E
500|$|After {{the release}} of the record, David Bowie praised the band, writing, [...] " [...] might be all shamrocks and deutsche marks to some, but I feel that they {{are one of the few}} rock bands even {{attempting}} to hint at a world which will continue past the next great wall—the year 2000." [...] Although the record was a success, in the years following its release, the group have regarded it with mixed feelings and rarely play its material in live performances. Bono said, [...] "I thought of Zooropa at the time as a work of genius. <b>I</b> <b>really</b> <b>thought</b> our pop discipline was matching our experimentation and this was our Sgt. Pepper. I was a little wrong about that. The truth is our pop disciplines were letting us down. We didn't create hits. We didn't quite deliver the songs. And what would Sgt. Pepper be without the pop songs?" [...] The Edge said that he did not think the songs were [...] "potent", further stating, [...] "I never thought of Zooropa as anything more than an interlude... but a great one, as interludes go. By far our most interesting." [...] Clayton said, [...] "It's an odd record and a favourite of mine." ...|$|E
25|$|The {{most recent}} album, Listen, {{includes}} much more percussion and cross rhythms than previous material. Pritchard described the band's most recent album Listen as “percussion sonnets”. “The first couple albums I made <b>I</b> never <b>really</b> <b>thought</b> about rhythms, <b>I</b> {{focused on the}} recording and the lyrics”, Pritchard said.|$|R
5000|$|The Celtic and [...] "almost middle eastern/Indian approach" [...] of [...] "One Love Forever" [...] made McPherson realize [...] "how these tribes {{around the}} world have musical {{similarities}} that <b>I</b> hadn't <b>really</b> <b>thought</b> about until we did that verse." [...] Steve says he used a style of playing that resembled European folk music.|$|R
5000|$|At {{various points}} in time, {{she has done}} better than she {{initially}} thought possible. Looking back on her entry into the Razorback program, she said, “When I first came in, I was just oblivious to everything. I just kind of came in - <b>I</b> never <b>really</b> <b>thought,</b> as a freshman, that I'd {{have an impact on}} the program.” ...|$|R
500|$|Langford from AfterElton praised Mercedes' part in Lynsey's murder storyline, {{saying he}} was [...] "loving" [...] Metcalfe as [...] "scheming Mercedes". He commented {{that he did not}} believe Mercedes killed Lynsey because [...] "as crazy as Mercedes is, I don’t think she’s a killer, but {{watching}} her benefit from Lynsey’s murder by worming her way back into Riley’s life has been delicious to watch". Langford said that he was [...] "loving the dysfunctional affair between Mercedes and the bad Dr. Browning. Their scenes are hot and they are so suited for each other. The games they play with each other are a hoot". He later added that Mercedes and Doctor Browning have [...] "blistering" [...] chemistry, saying that he is perfect for a [...] "twisted girl like Mercedes. I loved their scenes — they were hot, hot, hot. <b>I</b> <b>really</b> <b>thought</b> they made a delicious and fun couple. But now it’s all ruined with Browning being a killer". Morgan of All About Soap felt that Doctor Browning's act of killing of Lynsey [...] "was a crime of passion, but there’s no way Mercy is worth killing for". Morgan later questioned why Mitzeee did not [...] "just finish the job?!" [...] when she threatened Mercedes with a knife.|$|E
500|$|McKay {{stated that}} Rudd helped him rewrite the script, calling Rudd [...] "great with dialogue", adding [...] "the {{two of us}} holed up in hotel rooms on {{the east and west}} coast, and I think it was like six to eight weeks we just ground it out and did a giant rewrite of the script. I was really proud of what we did, <b>I</b> <b>really</b> <b>thought</b> we put some amazing stuff in there and built on an already strong script from Edgar Wright and sort of just {{enhanced}} some stuff." [...] Rudd elaborated, [...] "The idea, the trajectory, the goal, and the blueprint of it all, is really Edgar and Joe. It's their story. We changed some scenes, we added new sequences, we changed some characters, we added new characters. If you took the two scripts and held them up together they'd be very different—but the idea is all theirs." [...] Reed also offered contributions to the revised script, as did Lilly and Stoll, who contributed ideas to help flesh out their respective characters. Lilly's character received a fuller arc and more action sequences as a result. One of the important things when joining the film for Reed was emphasizing both Hope and Janet van Dyne more, given the Wasp being [...] "a crucial part" [...] of the Ant-Man comics. For their efforts, McKay and Rudd were credited as additional writers of the screenplay, with Wright and Cornish credited for the screenplay and story. Wright also held an executive producer credit on the film.|$|E
2500|$|... "I've {{got a lot}} {{of respect}} for Jerry Reinsdorf, I do. But <b>I</b> <b>really</b> <b>thought,</b> the {{relationship}} we had over the last 16 years, he would have picked up the phone to say, 'Big guy, we're moving forward. We're going somewhere different. We don't know your situation or what's going to happen.' I can live with that, I really can", Thomas said. [...] "But treating me like some passing-by-player. I've got no respect for that." [...] Thomas said he was not bitter or angry and had joined the A's with an open mind.|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes; they've sent a {{check for}} ten dollars, and the editor writes {{that he would like}} to see more of my work. Dear man, he shall. It was an old sketch I found in my box. I re-wrote it and sent it in--but <b>I</b> never <b>really</b> <b>thought</b> it could be {{accepted}} because it had no plot," [...] said Anne, recalling the bitter experience of Averil's Atonement.|$|R
60|$|I FIND it {{impossible}} to describe my sensations while the carriage was taking me to Major Fitz-David's house. I doubt, indeed, if <b>I</b> <b>really</b> felt or <b>thought</b> at all, in the true sense of those words.|$|R
5000|$|... "I {{remember}} my screenwriting professor really liked {{the first draft}} of the script because he gave me an A, so <b>I</b> was <b>really</b> happy. Back then, <b>I</b> never <b>really</b> <b>thought</b> of it as my second feature film. It was only when {{trying to come up with}} some ideas with my brother who wrote the final script that I realized that this script would be great to shoot back home as it had an international theme and crossover appeal," [...] says Bello.|$|R
2500|$|After {{her husband}} became president, Julia reconsidered surgery. [...] “I {{never had the}} courage to consent, but now that my husband had become so famous <b>I</b> <b>really</b> <b>thought</b> it behooved me to try to look as well as possible.” [...] Ulysses objected: “Did I not see you and fall in love with you with these same eyes? I like them just as they are, and now, remember, you are not to {{interfere}} with them. They are mine, and let me tell you, Mrs. Grant, you had better not make any experiments, as I might not like you half so well with any other eyes.” ...|$|E
2500|$|In 1998, after {{completing}} college Carlson {{enrolled at the}} Cooking and Hospitality Institute of Chicago (CHIC) and got chef's position at Spiaggia under Paul Bartolotta. [...] He quit CHIC after one semester, {{due in part to}} an instructor who began a pasta-making class by demonstrating the proper way to open a box. Bartolotta, however, saw promise in Carlson and arranged for him to study under Valentino Marcattilii at San Domenico in Italy. While in Italy, Carlson staged at more than fifteen different restaurants. Carlson describes the experience as a turning point in his career. [...] "It was the first time <b>I</b> <b>really</b> <b>thought</b> about food," [...] he explains.|$|E
2500|$|Garbage's {{intention}} is to make pop-like songs which mixed a variety of genres, with Steve Marker saying that the band wanted to [...] "take pop music and make it as horrible sounding as we can." [...] These genres include trip hop, grunge, 1980s rock music, techno, power pop and shoegazing. Shirley Manson has stated that the band itself [...] "used to describe [...] as sci-fi pop, because {{we felt it was}} taking a futuristic approach." [...] Vig has said the crossover-heavy sound was inspired by the band's background with remixes, where songs would be rearranged to every musical style to which they held interest, and also that he [...] "grew up listening to everything from pop radio and opera to country music and polka, so <b>I</b> <b>really</b> <b>thought</b> that Garbage would be an interesting and eclectic thing to do." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "He has {{not been}} here once," [...] she adds, [...] "since <b>I</b> came. <b>I</b> <b>really</b> had some <b>thoughts</b> of {{breaking}} my heart for the inconstant creature. I had almost {{made up my mind}} that he was dead." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Perhaps I shall live ten {{or twenty}} years, and {{look back and}} say, [...] "I {{recollect}} how in '64 <b>I</b> <b>really</b> almost <b>thought</b> <b>I</b> should not last long." [...] But don't fancy that I am morbidly cherishing such fancies. Only I like you all to know me as I am changing in feeling from time to time. There is quite enough to account for it all.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "It {{would be}} nothing," [...] he resumed, turning round again and {{lowering}} his hammer, [...] "if you hadn't always protested {{that you would}} never marry, but--oh, Jessie, I wonder at a girl who has always been so firm in sticking to her resolves, turning out so fickle. <b>I</b> <b>really</b> never <b>thought</b> that the family of Macnab could be brought so low through one of its female members." ...|$|R
2500|$|He {{rejoined the}} Red Hot Chili Peppers in Los Angeles {{to record the}} album.

Although Kiedis had recently become clean, his withdrawal symptoms increased and affected his musical contributions to the group. After fifty days of sobriety, Kiedis decided to take drugs again as a one-time attempt to celebrate his new music, which led to his resumed addiction.

60|$|I {{was quite}} {{relieved}} {{to find that}} it was only Brooks of Sheffield; for, at first, <b>I</b> <b>really</b> <b>thought</b> it was I.|$|E
6000|$|... "No, my friend," [...] I answered; [...] "but you {{and another}} have lost your best cow." [...] And {{word for word}} I {{repeated}} to him Mameena's message. When <b>I</b> had finished <b>really</b> <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> that Umbezi was about to faint.|$|R
6000|$|... "Have you, indeed! I am {{very sorry}} for it; but <b>really</b> <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> I was in very good time. It is but just one. I hope {{you have not been}} here long?" ...|$|R

40|$|Includes abstract. Includes bibliographical {{references}} (p. 114 - 117). At {{a dinner}} party in Durban after the opening of Come, a 2007 exhibition of Michaelis MFA students, a woman asked me about my work.

5000|$|Almost immediately, {{it became}} {{apparent}} that the Bruins had received the better of the deal. Neely stated that [...] "I was surprised at the trade. <b>I</b> <b>really</b> didn't know what to expect once I got to Boston and had no idea that my career would turn out the way it did for those ten years. From Day One in training camp, I just wanted to get the opportunity to play. The coaches said, 'Let's see what he can do.' As time went by, I got more and more confidence. <b>I</b> never <b>really</b> <b>thought</b> I'd be a 50-goal scorer, but I was given a chance to contribute offensively, not just physically." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{was only}} a stenographer, {{and we were very}} poor, and he was rich and lived in a big house, the most {{important}} man in Hampton.

Please don't think I'm putting all the blame on him, Mrs. Maturity--it was my fault just as much as his. I ought to have gone away from Hampton, but I didn't have the strength.
