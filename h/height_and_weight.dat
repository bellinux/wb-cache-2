5|$|With {{the onset}} of the Industrial Revolution it was {{realized}} that the military and economic might of nations were dependent on both the body size and strength of their soldiers and workers. Increasing the average body mass index from what is now considered underweight to what is now the normal range {{played a significant role in}} the development of industrialized societies. <b>Height</b> <b>and</b> <b>weight</b> thus both increased through the 19thcentury in the developed world. During the 20th century, as populations reached their genetic potential for height, weight began increasing much more than height, resulting in obesity. In the 1950s increasing wealth in the developed world decreased child mortality, but as body weight increased heart and kidney disease became more common.|$|E

Green had taken over Swansea in 1939 and had set about establishing the side as a feeder club for local youth talent {{due to a lack}} of finances, offering 17 year old Ford an amateur contract in 1940 before signing him to his first professional contract with Swansea two years later. With the Football League suspended due to the Second World War, Ford featured for the club in wartime Combination leagues. Having spent his youth career as a defender, during his war service, Ford grew substantially in both <b>height</b> <b>and</b> <b>weight</b> and the Sergeant Major in charge of the local army football side switched him to centre-forward where he flourished, scoring 41 times between 1945 and 1946 in regional wartime competitions. After he was moved from his original army posting in Rhyl to new barracks in Colchester, Ford appeared for Leyton Orient in wartime fixtures, scoring three times in four appearances for the side. Following the return of league football after wartime, he made his fully professional competitive debut and played sixteen times in the first half of the 1946–47 season for the Swans in the Second Division before moving to Aston Villa in January 1947 for a fee of £9,500 plus Tommy Dodds.|$|E

40|$|Background: e-epidemiology, a {{convenient}} and low-cost research method, {{is becoming increasingly}} popular. This study seeks to validate on-line self-reported <b>heights</b> <b>and</b> <b>weights</b> against objectively measured data in young adults. Methods: Young adults self-reported <b>heights</b> <b>and</b> <b>weights</b> in an on-line lifestyle survey. These were validated using two methods: (i) measurements by staff at the primary-care clinic and (ii) measurements by a researcher within two weeks of distribution of the survey. Analyses were conducted to determine differences between the self-reported <b>and</b> measured <b>heights</b> <b>and</b> <b>weights</b> <b>and</b> to identify characteristics associated with under- or over-reporting of these. Results: From a total of 23 010 young adults invited to the survey, 24 % provided on-line data, mean age = 19. 2 (SD 3. 2) years, 43 % male, 91 % EU citizens. Both self-reported and measured data were available for 1446 individuals (547 men, 896 women and mean age 19. 2 (SD 2. 6) years); 1278 validated using medical records, 168 by researcher measurements. Intra-class correlations between self-reported and measured parameters were weight (r = 0. 99), height (r = 0. 98), with acceptable levels of agreement between measured <b>and</b> self-reported <b>weight,</b> <b>height</b> <b>and</b> BMI using Bland & Altman analyses. Self-reported weight was underestimated uniformly across BMI categories, gender and ethnicity, by a mean − 0. 4 (SD 0. 4) kg (P < 0. 001). Height was accurately reported overall across BMI and gender: both self-reported <b>and</b> measured <b>heights</b> = 1. 72 (SD 0. 01) m, P = 0. 783. Discrepancies between methods caused misclassification of BMI category for 17 (1. 8 %) of participants. Conclusions: Engagement of young adults with on-line research is encouraging. On-line self-reporting provides acceptably reliable anthropometric data for young adults, with under-reporting of weight by just 0. 4 kg...|$|R

40|$|The size {{of school}} {{children}} is a valuable index of the wellbeing of a community.
