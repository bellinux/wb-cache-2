5|$|Chris Hadfield, a Canadian Space Agency {{astronaut}} and STS-74 mission specialist, {{used the}} shuttle's robot arm to hoist the docking module {{out of the}} aft portion of the payload bay, rotated it to a vertical position, and moved it to within <b>five</b> <b>inches</b> of the Orbiter Docking System. At that point, the shuttle fired its downward steering jets and moved the shuttle toward the docking module. Once the two spacecraft were locked together, the docking ring on the Orbiter Docking System retracted, {{and a series of}} hooks and latches were engaged to ensure an airtight seal between the two spacecraft.|$|E
5|$|The {{armoured}} belt {{consisted of}} face-hardened Krupp cemented armour (KC), arranged in three strakes. The main waterline belt was 12inches (305mm) thick between 'A' and 'Y' barbettes and thinned to 5 to 6inches (127 to 152mm) towards the ship's ends, {{but did not}} reach either the bow or the stern. The middle armour belt had a maximum thickness of 7inches (178mm) over the same length as the thickest part of the waterline armour and thinned to <b>five</b> <b>inches</b> abreast 'A' barbette. The upper belt was 5inches thick amidships and extended forward to 'A' barbette, with a short 4-inch (102mm) extension aft.|$|E
5|$|The head {{should be}} of {{moderate}} width at the ears, narrowing to the eyes, and slightly flat between the ears. There should be a defined but not overpronounced stop {{at the end of}} the muzzle where it meets the head, and a black nose. The jaw should be powerful and well boned with a scissor bite and straight teeth. The eyes are almond shaped and dark coloured and should be full of life and intelligence. Small V-shaped ears of moderate thickness are carried forward on the head. When the dog is alert, the tip of the V should not extend past the outer corner of the eyes. The tail is set high and in the past was docked to approximately <b>five</b> <b>inches</b> in order to provide a sufficient hand-hold for gripping the terrier.|$|E

5|$|Andrews {{qualified}} {{to represent the}} United States at the 1984 Summer Olympics in Los Angeles, where she won two gold medals. She gained her first gold in the women's 100-meter backstroke, narrowly edging fellow American Betsy Mitchell by eight one-hundredths (.08) of a second – about <b>five</b> <b>inches</b> – for a final time of 1:02.55. It {{was the first time}} she had ever beaten Mitchell. She earned her second gold by swimming the lead-off backstroke leg for the first-place U.S. team in the women's 4×100-meter medley relay event, sharing the honors with her American teammates Tracy Caulkins (breaststroke), Mary T. Meagher (butterfly), and Nancy Hogshead (freestyle), and clocking a winning time of 4:08.34. Her split time of 1:04.00 was slower than her gold-medal time in the individual 100-meter backstroke, but her teammates made good the difference to win and set a new American record in the event.|$|E
5|$|The storm's effects {{north of}} Florida were minor. Rainfall {{reached up to}} nine inches (228mm) in extreme eastern South Carolina and four inches (101mm) in eastern North Carolina. Winds reached 50mph (60km/h) with gusts up to 66mph (101km/h) at the Oak Island Coast Guard Station near Cape Fear, North Carolina and 54mph (87km/h) with gusts of 77mph (123km/h) at the {{offshore}} tower at Frying Pan Shoals about forty miles southeast of Cape Fear on June 18 with 70mph winds (110km/h) the next day. A 68foot fishing trawler sunk {{off the coast of}} Cape Fear in North Carolina from the high waves; no one was killed as the sailors were rescued by the United States Coast Guard on June 19. Flooding was reported with tides of two to three feet in the Carolinas. Rainfall from the subtropical storm reached both states, reaching maximum peaks of up to <b>five</b> <b>inches</b> (127mm) on the Georgia coast and seven inches on the Georgia/South Carolina border. Rainfall totaled to about one inch (25mm) on the Virginian coast. A ship encountered winds of a minimum tropical storm with gusts as high as a maximum tropical storm. The ship also encountered a tidal surge of 15 to 20feet.|$|E

25|$|The next psychic {{claimed to}} be able to read auras around people. He claimed that auras were visible at least <b>five</b> <b>inches</b> above each of them. He {{selected}} ten people who he said had clearly visible auras. They were to stand behind screens and he claimed that their auras would be visible above the screens, which were numbered 1 through 10, and the subjects were told by the astrologer behind which screen to stand. He was to tell whether or not a person was standing behind each screen, by seeing their aura above. Since random guessing would be expected to get about five correct, the psychic needed to get eight of the ten right. The psychic stated that he saw an aura over all ten screens, but people were behind only four of the screens.|$|E
25|$|By far {{the most}} common object was a stone star with a hole through the middle. They were found {{everywhere}} between Ibarra and Riobamba. The majority have six rays (and none have more), proceeding symmetrically from the center, and the whole are fashioned alike upon each side. A certain number have only five rays, and occasional examples are irregular in shape. All are pierced by a hole, which has been drilled from the two sides, {{and the size of}} this varies considerably. In dimensions they range from three to <b>five</b> <b>inches</b> in diameter and from three-quarters of an inch to two inches in thickness. Their weight is from five to twenty ounces. The larger part are made from basaltic rock and gabbro. Objects of this class were also cast in metal but these are now rarely found in Ecuador.|$|E
25|$|Police {{arrested a}} suspect that closely matched the {{description}} on Sunday. The suspect had gloves that Mrs. Harmon {{identified as the}} same gloves worn by her attacker. The man was also wearing blue clothes and khakis. The pocket knife the 33 year-old was carrying, though, had a blade much shorter than <b>five</b> <b>inches.</b> This man was also clean shaven. After investigating the suspect, officers {{did not believe the}} man was the Phantom. According to the man's story about bumming around the country, he could not have been in Texarkana during the slaying of Virgil Starks. The man said that he left Pine Bluff {{in the latter part of}} April and went to Colorado. Officers said that they were going to thoroughly check his story. They kept him in jail for three weeks so his beard would grow back, which would allow Mrs. Harmon to positively identify him as her attacker.|$|E

25|$|This {{manuscript}} inexplicably {{appears in}} Hughan's Old Charges with a date of 1632, which Speth, the next editor, {{attributed to the}} terrible handwriting of Rev. Woodford, Hughan's collaborator. It {{is the first of}} the charges to bear a date, which is just discernible as 1583, on the 25 December. The document {{is in the form of}} a roll of parchment nine feet long and <b>five</b> <b>inches</b> wide, being made up of four pieces pasted at the ends. The United Grand Lodge of England acquired it in 1839 for twenty-five pounds from a Miss Sidall, the great-granddaughter of Thomas Dunckerley's second wife. The handwriting is compatible with the date of 1583, although the language is older, leading Henry Jenner to propose that it was copied from an original up to a century older. The contents of Grand Lodge 1 tell the same tale as the Dowland manuscript, with only minor changes. Again, the charges take the form of an oath on a sacred book.|$|E
25|$|In early March 2016, {{a dip in}} the {{jet stream}} and {{collection}} of moisture from the gulf caused a large, slow-moving weather system that produced torrential rains and severe weather as it made its way from Texas into the Mississippi Valley. On March 8, the storm hit northwest Louisiana, where it proceeded to create huge flood events in the area near Shreveport. Many neighborhoods around Red Chute Bayou and Flat River in Bossier Parish were quickly inundated and evacuated. In the neighborhood of Golden Meadows in Bossier City, the rapid rainfall overwhelmed storm drains and left people stranded in their homes with up to four feet of water in some areas. As the storm later moved east, the rest of North Louisiana was heavily impacted with up to twenty <b>five</b> <b>inches</b> of rain recorded in some areas such as Monroe. There were also many areas in other states such as Illinois, Texas, Oklahoma, Mississippi, Missouri, and Tennessee severely affected by this storm. Five deaths are directly attributed to this storm, and over 3500 people have been displaced.|$|E
