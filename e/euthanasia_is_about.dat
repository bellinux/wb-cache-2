40|$|A {{major reason}} that The Netherlands {{has taken a}} {{different}} approach {{to the rest of the}} world on such a fundamental moral issue is that the courts and legislature in that country have accorded the interests of doctors a cardinal role in the euthanasia debate. This article argues that the interests of doctors are of only incidental and peripheral relevance in relation to the moral status of euthanasia. The moral status of euthanasia has little to do with the preparedness ofdoctors to administer the lethal injection or their general attitude towards the practice. <b>Euthanasia</b> <b>is</b> principally <b>about</b> the interests of the patient and the impact that the practice may have on the community in general, not preserving the conscience or improving the working life ofdoctors...|$|R

Dutch citizens were asked to judge all kinds of ‘euthanasia’ and appeared {{to be able to do}} this in a highly balanced way. They do not use just one or two criteria to judge various cases of euthanasia, they seem to evaluate each new case on its own merits and they do so in a very thoughtful and sophisticated way, using a refined combination of criteria...|$|R

50|$|<b>Euthanasia</b> <b>is</b> {{categorized}} {{in different}} ways, which include voluntary, non-voluntary, or involuntary. Voluntary <b>euthanasia</b> <b>is</b> legal in some countries. Non-voluntary euthanasia (patient's consent unavailable) is illegal in all countries. Involuntary euthanasia (without asking consent {{or against the}} patient's will) is also illegal in all countries and is usually considered murder. As of 2006, <b>euthanasia</b> <b>is</b> the most active area of research in contemporary bioethics.|$|R
50|$|Non-voluntary <b>euthanasia</b> <b>is</b> <b>euthanasia</b> {{conducted}} {{when the}} explicit {{consent of the}} individual concerned is unavailable, such as when the person is in a persistent vegetative state, {{or in the case}} of young children.

50|$|The {{entitlement}} of {{a person}} {{to make the decision}} to end their own life through <b>euthanasia</b> <b>is</b> commonly called a right to choose, while people who oppose the legalization of <b>euthanasia</b> <b>are</b> commonly referred to as the right-to-lifers.|$|R
25|$|Voluntary <b>euthanasia</b> <b>is</b> {{conducted}} {{with the consent of}} the patient. Active voluntary <b>euthanasia</b> <b>is</b> legal in Belgium, Luxembourg and the Netherlands. Passive voluntary <b>euthanasia</b> <b>is</b> legal throughout the US per Cruzan v. Director, Missouri Department of Health.

40|$|Partisans of {{euthanasia}} {{believe that}} they can justify it in terms of moral, and that only voluntary <b>euthanasia</b> should <b>be</b> legalized. In other words, only patients who expresses clearly and repeatedly their desire to die could resort lawfully to <b>euthanasia.</b> This view <b>is</b> based on the right to self-determination, freedom and dignity of the person, principles that represent the fundamental values of a society. However, in addition to those who support the need of <b>euthanasia,</b> there <b>are</b> still many who are against it, or treat this concept with skepticism. There are series of arguments that change the balance in favor of the ones who do not approve euthanasia. A first argument that seeks legalization of <b>euthanasia</b> <b>is</b> based on an ideal vision of hospitals, doctors, nurses and families (and this vision is often the fruit of imagination, so the idea of voluntary <b>euthanasia</b> <b>is</b> one danger). Another key argument against legalizing <b>euthanasia</b> <b>was</b> that is practically impossible to draw up a law to protect doctors who practice euthanasia without sliding towards the inevitable abuses. The final argument against legalizing <b>euthanasia</b> <b>is</b> a legal one. Current law condemns euthanasia considering it a murder, and this argument is sustained practically by all treaties and codes. The Constitution guarantees the “right to life” and the concept of euthanasia violates deeply this fundamental principle...|$|R

40|$|Performing <b>euthanasia</b> {{correctly}} <b>is</b> {{an ethical}} imperative. Proper <b>euthanasia</b> <b>is</b> quick, minimizes pain/distress and reliably causes death.

My thesis <b>is</b> focused on <b>euthanasia</b> in relation to the law. The aim of the thesis is to analyse the issue of euthanasia from the perspective of legislation in the Czech Republic. The thesis consists of five chapters. The first chapter contains introduction to the topic of euthanasia. The second chapter is devoted to the definition of term <b>euthanasia.</b> <b>Euthanasia</b> <b>is</b> a word of Greek origin ("eu"- good and "thanatos"- death). Its meaning is good, beautiful or merciful death. Nowadays the term is used in the sense of intentionally termination of life on request to relieve pain and suffering. This chapter also includes the definition of forms of euthanasia. The third chapter <b>is</b> focused on <b>euthanasia</b> in the sense of killing on request. In this meaning, <b>euthanasia</b> has never <b>been</b> explicitly regulated in the Czech Republic. But it does not mean that the issue of legislation of <b>euthanasia</b> <b>is</b> not actual.

40|$|A survey {{published}} in the Medical Journal of Australia in 1997 showed {{that the incidence of}} non-voluntary <b>euthanasia</b> in Australia <b>was</b> higher than in the Netherlands. <b>Euthanasia</b> <b>is</b> illegal in Australia, while it is openly practiced in the Netherlands. It has been suggested that the results of the survey undermine the slippery slope argument against legalising <b>euthanasia.</b> This <b>is</b> wrong. Although {{at the time of the}} survey, <b>euthanasia</b> <b>was</b> formally prohibited by the law in Australia, the medical and legal culture was such that doctors could practice euthanasia with impunity — in certain circumstances <b>euthanasia</b> by doctors <b>was</b> effectively condoned. This is in fact supported by the findings of the survey. The survey suggests that there were approximately 6, 700 cases of euthanasia in Australia in the year from July 1994 to June 1995 — not one of which was prosecuted, let alone resulted in a conviction. Ultimately the survey merely shows that in a climate where voluntary <b>euthanasia</b> <b>is</b> tolerated, wide scale abuses (in the form of nonvoluntary euthanasia) occur.

40|$|Three {{groups of}} health care {{professionals}} were canvassed for their views on euthanasia - student nurses, practising nurses and doctors.

Passive forms of <b>euthanasia</b> <b>were</b> found to be the most acceptable.

Kant's conclusions are uncompelling and his argument in these matters is undermined on considering other areas of his thought.
