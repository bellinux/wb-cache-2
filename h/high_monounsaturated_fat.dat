Total abdominal fat and sc adipose tissue (SAT) were reduced with the D and D+E interventions (P< 0. 05), whereas visceral adipose tissue (VAT) decreased with the D+E and EX intervention, but not with the D intervention. EX resulted in a reduction in total abdominal fat, VAT, and SAT (P< 0. 05) despite the lack of weight loss. The reductions in total abdominal fat and SAT explained 32. 7 % and 9. 7 %, respectively, of the variability in the changes in fasting glucose levels, whereas the reductions in VAT explained 15. 9 % of the changes in fasting insulin levels (P< 0. 05). In conclusion, modest weight loss, through either D or D+E, resulted in similar improvements in total abdominal fat, SAT, and glycemic status in postmenopausal women with type 2 diabetes; however, the addition of exercise to diet is necessary for VAT loss.

Body fat distribution, fasting plasma glucose, blood pressure, and fasting serum lipids were measured at wk 0 and 12 in 62 women (BMI > 27 kg/m(2)). Weight loss (9. 5 +/- 2. 4 vs. 9. 4 +/- 3. 4 kg, VLF vs. HIMO) and total fat loss (6. 1 +/- 2. 4 vs. 6. 3 +/- 2. 7 kg, VLF vs. HIMO) {{did not differ in}} the groups.

40|$|Samandrag - Abstract The {{metabolic}} syndrome (MetS) includes {{a variety of}} metabolic abnormalities, such as: insulin resistance; glucose intolerance; altered lipid-profile (hypertriglyceridemia and decreased HDL), hypertension and abdominal obesity. MetS is strongly connected to increased risk of cardiovascular disease and development of type 2 diabetes, and the prevalence is increasing as the overweight epidemic plays an important role. To deal with this challenge {{it is essential to}} gain more knowledge about the pathogenesis and optimal treatment of MetS. The present papers task is to look into the meal related metabolic effects in Caucasians with MetS, of altering the type and amount of fat and carbohydrate in the diet. The study has four diet groups: high saturated fat (SAFA), <b>high</b> <b>monounsaturated</b> <b>fat</b> (MUFA) and low fat with and without omega- 3 supplementation. After 6 weeks of diet intervention the meal related effect was measured by analysing important parameters (blood glucose, insulin, C-peptide and fasting lipids) before and during a standardized meal. Significant differences between the diet groups are found in this paper. The metabolism of carbohydrate and lipid is less optimal in the high SAFA diet. The data indicate that persons with MetS have positive effects on their metabolism when replacing SAFA with MUFA and/or PUFA. It is not possible to conclude which of the latter diets to recommend. The results can also lead to speculations that omega- 3 -fatty acids have a positive effect in a low fat diet. The findings of this study are in accordance with prior studies on dietary fat in healthy individuals...|$|E
40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{determine}} the optimal diet for improving glucose and lipid profiles in obese patients with {{type 2 diabetes}} during moderate energy restriction. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: A total of 35 free-living obese patients with type 2 diabetes were {{assigned to one of}} three 1, 600 kcal/day diets for 12 weeks. The diets were high carbohydrate (10 % fat, 4 % saturated), <b>high</b> <b>monounsaturated</b> <b>fat</b> (MUFA) (32 % fat, 7 % saturated), or high saturated fat (SFA) (32 % fat, 17 % saturated). RESULTS: Diet composition did not affect the magnitude of weight loss, with subjects losing an average of 6. 6 +/- 0. 9 kg. Energy restriction and weight loss resulted in reductions in fasting plasma glucose (- 14 %), insulin (- 27 %), GHb (- 14 %), and systolic (- 7 %) and diastolic blood pressure (- 10 %) levels and the glucose response area (- 17 %) independent of diet composition. Diet composition did affect the lipoprotein profile. LDL was 10 % and 17 % lower with the high-carbohydrate and high-MUFA diets, respectively, whereas no change was observed with the high-SFA diet (P < 0. 001 for effect of diet). HDL was transiently reduced on the high-carbohydrate diet at weeks 1, 4, and 8, whereas higher fat consumption maintained these levels. The total cholesterol:HDL ratio, although significantly reduced on the high-MUFA diet (P < 0. 01), was not different from the other two diets after adjustment for baseline differences. CONCLUSIONS: Energy restriction, independent of diet composition, improves glycemic control; however, reducing SFA intake by replacing SFA with carbohydrate or MUFA reduces LDL maximally during weight loss and to a greater degree than has been shown in weight-stable studies.

40|$|Background: There remains {{debate about}} the {{relative}} benefits of <b>high</b> <b>monounsaturated</b> <b>fat</b> diets or high carbohydrate diets in {{reducing the risk of}} coronary heart disease. Intake of lycopene from tomatoes and tomato products has been suggested as inversely related to the risk of coronary heart disease and some forms of cancer. However {{little is known about the}} effects of combination of olive oil and lycopene on the risk factors of heart disease. Objective: To compare the effect of two diets (a monounsaturated fat enriched olive oil diet and high carbohydrate low olive oil diet), with controlled carotenoid content on serum lycopene, lipids and susceptibility of serum to in vitro oxidation. Design: A randomised crossover dietary intervention study, in human subjects (20 - 70 years), of two dietary periods (olive oil enriched, and high carbohydrate low olive oil) of 10 days duration. Both the diets were matched for basic foods and were controlled for carotenoid content, which was high in lycopene. Results: Both diets similarly increased serum lycopene levels. Serum high density lipoprotein cholesterol levels were higher; and triglycerides and low density lipoprotein to high density lipoprotein ratio were lower at the end of the high olive oil diet compared to the high carbohydrate low olive oil diet. No difference was seen in susceptibility of serum to in vitro oxidation between the two diets. Conclusion: A high olive oil diet with high lycopene content may reduce the risk of coronary heart disease by increasing serum lycopene levels and improving serum lipid profile.

40|$|In {{this thesis}} three studies are reported, which aim to {{investigate}} the performance of an interviewer-administered, open-ended diet history for the use in clinical studies where dietary variables are manipulated. The studies presented here are focused on validating self-reported macronutrient and energy intakes in Australian adults who have volunteered to participate in dietary intervention research. The evaluations are performed using food records, 24 -hour recalls and biochemical markers of intake for comparison. In addition, a pilot study is presented, which examines the ability of hair and sebaceous lipid composition to reflect dietary fatty acid intake in healthy volunteers. Clinical trials are the highest form of evidence for examining both the treatment and prevention of disease by dietary nutrients. Given this, {{it is imperative that}} these nutrients are measured as accurately as possible to avoid erroneous conclusions regarding their capabilities. Despite the importance of data from clinical trials, the literature relating to the performance of dietary assessment methods in this context is sparse. Despite evidence to show that food records and 24 -hour recalls are not always able to measure intake accurately, many dietary intervention trials are using these methods to measure dietary intake during the intervention period. Since the diet history method is used in clinical practice, albeit in a less rigorous manner, and the clinical trial is, in essence, a highly controlled form of clinical practice, examination of the diet history method in this research context is warranted. The first study in this thesis examined the validity of an interviewer-administered, open-ended, non-structured diet history in adults with Type II diabetes mellitus. The trial examined the viability of a <b>high</b> <b>monounsaturated</b> <b>fat</b> diet for the treatment of associated blood and insulin abnormalities. The dietary data were obtained retrospectively and the diet history was examined relative to a 3 -day food record using a number of statistical techniques. The results showed that the diet history method was able to measure both energy and macronutrient intakes reasonably well at both the group level and the individual level. There was, however, a failure to measure the fatty acid composition of the diet, which was due to a few outliers who reported discrepant values. Nethertheless, the relationship between paired data for these variables was significant once outliers were removed. There was no relationship between bias and intake indicating that systematic error was not operating in this group. An important finding from this study was the large proportion of individuals underreporting energy intake. This was not method-specific, but rather subject-specific and tended to occur in the larger individuals, however the use of a nutrient density model diluted in the effects of underreporting for comparisons of the diet history with the food record. The non-structured diet history method was found to estimate energy and nutrient intakes relatively well in a clinical population with Type II diabetes. The second study also used retrospective data from both the former study and another clinical trial, which examined the effects of a <b>high</b> <b>monounsaturated</b> <b>fat</b> diet on the prevention of diabetes in Australian adults with mild insulin resistance. The aim of this study was the compare the performance of the interviewer-administered, non-structured diet history between healthy individuals and individual with Type II diabetes mellitus undergoing similar intervention protocols with differing intensity. The results showed that the values measured by the DH in the healthy individuals were closer to those of the food record than in the individuals with Type II diabetes. Moreover, the degree of underreporting in the healthy individuals was significantly lower than in individuals with diabetes. Biases in the measurements of target nutrients also showed movement in different directions between the two sample groups. The third study was designed to fit within the research protocol of a dietary supplementation trials, which examined the effects of fish oil and soy isoflavone on the risk profile for cardiovascular disease. The study presented in this thesis aimed to assess the validity and reproducibility of a diet history method using both food records and multiple 24 hour recalls for reference, in addition to urine nitrogen and erythrocyte membrane phospholipid fatty acid composition as biomarkers of dietary intake. The biochemical markers not only provided information as to the performance of diet history method, but also the reference methods to determine if discrepancies between paired data were indeed due to diet history failings. The diet history method used in this study was slightly different to the aforementioned non-structured approach with the record of foods taking place on a structured meal-based form with food prompts for the dietitian. The allowed the dietitian to prompt for the context of eating as well as the foods consumed. Since the concern in this study was the accuracy of the data for a valid trial outcome, prompting was not considered to introduce bias, but rather to improve memory of foods consumed. The results showed that the diet history method was measuring higher absolute intakes of energy and macronutrients than both the food records and the 24 -hour recalls, however, both reference methods showed a higher degree of underreporting and an underestimation of nitrogen intake of energy and macronutirents than both the food record and the 24 hour recalls, however, both reference methods showed a higher degree of underreporting and an underestimation of nitrogen intake {{during the course of the}} intervention indicating that the reference methods were prone to underestimation. The diet history values also moved in line with those of the food record and the 24 -hour recall. In addition, the diet history was shown to be better at estimating long chain fatty acid intake than the food record for variables, which were of importance in a fish oil supplementation trial. Nevertheless, this study showed that the structured diet history method was both valid and reproducible for estimating macronutrient and energy intake in a sample of Australian adults participating in a dietary supplementation trial. The final study was designed in response to the lack of biomarkers available for fat intake. This study was pilot study, which aimed to investigate if the fatty acid composition of both hair and sebaceous secretions was related to the fatty acid composition of the diet. If a relationship was shown then a potential non-invasive method for assessing what may be a single or a few fatty acids in the usual diet was possible. The results showed that there were no significant relationships between hair or sebaceous fatty acid composition and corresponding dietary fatty acids due, in part, to large numbers of undetectable fatty acids in the different tissues, which prevented correlation. Future research will indicate if hair or sebaceous fatty acid composition is valuable for assessing changes in dietary fat. As a result of the studies presented in this thesis, the interviewer-administered, structured diet history method has been used in numerous studies to date conducted through the author�s institution and requests for its use continue as clinical dietitians conduct research within their own institutions. If anything, this thesis has shown that relative validation of dietary methods is valuable and should be done in context. The issues that affect persons participating in trials with large subject burdens are not the same for those who undertake just a validation study. The methods used in intervention trials needs to be validated within the context of the trial and its participants. However, objective markers should always be used as an adjunct to any validation study especially those that inform on absolute nutrient intake such as urine nitrogen. This thesis reports on a number of interesting limitations associated with measuring dietary intake in free-living individuals especially in larger individuals in the sample group. A number of interesting macronutrient-specific biases are also reported on in this work. Further research in dietary methodology should focus on the need for contextual validation of dietary methods since the administration environment affects the accuracy of the test method. In addition, clinical trails, which are dependent on nutrient targets for outcome, should make validation studies a priority and should question the accuracy of the reference methods used for validation purposes. This thesis has shown that the diet history interview is a valuable method for measuring dietary intake in clinical trials in free-living individuals. Of importance, is the contextual aspect of administration where the diet history would need to be validated in specific research environments, however, the studies presented here provide insight into the performance of the diet history method in clinical research...|$|E
40|$|Diet {{influences}} the {{coronary heart disease}} (CHD) risk factors including lipids and lipoproteins, glucose, insulin, and endothelial function. This research thesis {{examined the effects of}} the three different (tomato-olive oil combination and chilli) but widely consumed dietary components, on a range of metabolic and vascular parameters of CHD risk. The aims of this thesis were to investigate the effects of: o	a lycopene (tomato) -rich <b>high</b> <b>monounsaturated</b> <b>fat</b> (light olive oil) diet and a lycopene-rich high carbohydrate diet (each diet of 10 days duration) on serum lycopene, lipid profile and serum oxidation in 21 men and women aged between 22 and 70 years with a BMI of 18 - 30 kg/m 2. o	a chilli blend (30 g/day) supplemented diet and a bland (chilli free) diet (each diet of four week duration) on a range of metabolic and vascular parameters in 36 men and women aged between 22 and 70 years with a BMI of 18 - 35 kg/m 2. The measured parameters included serum lipids and lipoproteins, lipid oxidation, glucose, insulin, basal metabolic rate (BMR), heart rate (HR), peripheral and aortic blood pressure, augmentation index (AIx; a measure of arterial stiffness) and subendocardial viability ratio (SEVR; an indicator of myocardial perfusion). o	single meals containing chilli blend (30 g) with or without the background of a chilli-containing diet on a range of postprandial metabolic and vascular parameters (n = 36). o	a chilli blend supplemented diet (of three weeks duration) on endothelial-independent and -dependent vasodilation (assessed after administration of glyceryl trinitrate (GTN) and salbutamol, respectively) compared to the effects of a bland diet (n = 15). o	the active ingredient of spices (in different concentrations) including chilli (capsaicin and its analogue dihydrocapsaicin), turmeric (curcumin), piprine (black pepper) and the colour pigment of tomatoes (lycopene) on the in vitro copper-induced oxidation of serum lipids. The dietary intervention studies were conducted using a randomized crossover design on a weight maintenance regime. Two different groups of people volunteered {{to take part in the}} tomato-olive oil and the chilli studies. All participants from the four week chilli study also took part in the meal studies. Ten days of a high lycopene monounsaturated fat rich and high lycopene carbohydrate rich diets presented similar increase in serum lycopene concentration and a similar reduction in serum total and LDL cholesterol. The AIx after three weeks of regular chilli consumption was lower on the chilli diet compared to the bland diet, but there was no significant difference in the overall effects of GTN and salbutamol on endothelium-independent and -dependent vasodilation between the two diets. Four weeks of iso-energetic weight maintenance chilli and bland diets produced no significant differences in serum lipids, glucose, insulin, peripheral and central blood pressure, AIx, SEVR or BMR. HR was lower after four weeks of chilli-supplemented diet in men, but not in women. Serum collected after the chilli-supplemented diet exhibited a lower rate of copper-induced oxidation compared to the serum after the bland diet. Women, but not men, also showed a longer lag phase after the chilli-supplemented diet compared to the bland diet. This was probably due to the higher chilli/capsaicin and dihydrocapsaicin intake (per kg body weight) in women. In vitro studies with capsaicin, dihydrocapsaicin (and curcumin) also exhibited a concentration effect for the resistance to copper-induced serum lipid oxidation. Results of the meal tests were surprising and exciting. The CAB meal (chilli-containing meal after the bland diet, eaten on day 29 of the bland diet) and the CAC meal (chilli-containing meal after the chilli diet, eaten on day 29 of the chilli diet) showed a lower maximum increase in postprandial serum insulin and overall postprandial serum insulin response compared to the BAB meal (bland meal after the bland diet, eaten on day 22 of the bland diet). The probable reason for this ameliorated insulin profile was a small reduction in insulin secretion and a large increase in the hepatic insulin clearance. The correlation between insulin and SEVR indicated an increase in the myocardial perfusion after the CAC meal compared to the BAB meal. All these results were more pronounced after the CAC meal and in people with BMI greater than 26 kg/m 2. Contrary to popular belief and some previously published data, we did not observe a significantly higher energy expenditure (EE) after the CAB meal or the CAC meal compared to the BAB meal. In fact, a lower EE was observed in people with increased BMI on the CAC meal compared to the BAB meal. This effect was possibly the consequence of improved postprandial insulin profile and reduced sympathetic nervous system activity after the CAC meal. The results from these investigations may have significance in improving serum lycopene concentrations, lipid profile (tomatoes and olive oil), postprandial insulin response (chilli) and increased resistance of serum to copper induced oxidation (chilli) and hence decreasing the risk of CHD, especially in people with increased BMI for whom the risk of cardiovascular morbidity and mortality is higher than in lean individuals. Together, the results from these studies not only advance our knowledge relating to the relationship between some foods and the CHD risk factors but provide an opportunity to combine olive oil, tomatoes and chillies with other foods and spices (as often used in curries) in an attempt to further investigate foods and cuisines that will minimise the various risk factors for CHD...|$|E
40|$|The {{effects of}} a fiber-rich, high carbohydrate, low-fat (HCLF) diet and a modified-fat (MF) diet <b>high</b> in <b>monounsaturated</b> <b>fat</b> on body fill {{distribution}} were examined by dual energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA) in 16 subjects with non-insulin dependent diabetes (NIDDM) during a randomized crossover study. Subjects lost similar amounts of body fat consuming the HCLF and MF diets (- 0. 83 ± 0. 37 and - 0. 87 ± 0. 40 kg, respectively) despite a marked difference in total fat consumption. With the MF diet, the ratio of upper- to lower- body fat (UF:LF) remained unchanged because fat was lost proportionately from {{the upper and lower}} body. In contrast, with the HCLF diet, a disproportionate loss of lower-body fat caused the UF:LF to in crease. The effects of diet on regional body fat loss were significant (P < 0. 05, two-factor repeated- measures ANOVA) ...|$|R
40|$|International audienceIn current dietary {{recommendations}} for the treatment and prevention of Type 2 diabetes and related complications there is flexibility {{in the proportion of}} energy derived from <b>monounsaturated</b> <b>fat</b> and carbohydrate as a replacement for saturated fat. Over the past few years, several population studies have shown that subjects eating a lot of refined grains and processed foods gain a much larger increase in waist circumference than those following a diet <b>higher</b> in <b>monounsaturated</b> <b>fat,</b> protein and carbohydrates rich in fibres and whole grains. In this issue of Clinical Science, Sinitskaya and co-workers have demonstrated that, in normal-weight rodents categorized into three groups of high-fat, medium-carbohydrate (53 / 30 ratio of fat/CHO % of energy, 4. 7 kcal/g), high-fat, low-carbohydrate (67 / 9 ratio of fat/CHO % of energy, 5. 2 kcal/g) and high-fat, carbohydrate-free (75 / 0 ratio of fat/CHO % of energy, 5. 9 kcal/g) diets, the high-fat diets that also contained carbohydrates were both obesogenic and diabetogenic while the very high-fat, carbohydrate-free diet was not obesogenic but led to insulin resistance and higher risk of cardiovascular disease. This finding may indicate that high-fat diets could easily be precipitated with carbohydrates to an unhealthy diet, pointing at the significance of macronutrient composition rather than caloric content in high-fat diets...|$|R
50|$|Incidence of Insulin {{resistance}} is lowered with diets <b>higher</b> in <b>monounsaturated</b> <b>fats</b> (especially oleic acid), while {{the opposite is}} true for diets high in polyunsaturated fats (especially large amounts of arachidonic acid) as well as saturated fats (such as arachidic acid). These ratios can be indexed in the phospholipids of human skeletal muscle and in other tissues as well. This relationship between dietary fats and insulin {{resistance is}} presumed secondary to the relationship between insulin resistance and inflammation, which is partially modulated by dietary fat ratios (Omega-3/6/9) with both omega 3 and 9 thought to be anti-inflammatory, and omega 6 pro-inflammatory (as well as by numerous other dietary components, particularly polyphenols and exercise, with both of these anti-inflammatory). Although both pro- and anti-inflammatory types of fat are biologically necessary, fat dietary ratios in most US diets are skewed towards Omega 6, with subsequent disinhibition of inflammation and potentiation of insulin resistance. But this is contrary to the suggestion of more recent studies, in which polyunsaturated fats are shown as protective against insulin resistance.|$|R
40|$|Insulin {{resistance}} {{is associated with}} a number of metabolic abnormalities that increase the risk of developing coronary heart disease. Dietary fat has been linked with insulin resistance, with alterations in the quality as opposed to the quantity of dietary fat now thought be more important in instigating improvements in insulin resistance. The aim of this work was to investigate the effect of alterations in the dietary fat intakes of middle-aged men (n = 32) on the insulin sensitivity of glucose disposal and postprandial lipid metabolism and to explore the mechanistic links between these insulin responsive pathways. Three separate dietary interventions were conducted; the first involved an increase in the intake of n- 3 polyunsaturated fat, the second a decrease in saturated fat and an increase in carbohydrate and the third a decrease in saturated fat and an increase in <b>monounsaturated</b> <b>fat</b> intake. Compliance was monitored by the measurement of red blood cell phospholipid fatty acid composition, postprandial lipid metabolism was measured over 9 hours following a high-fat breakfast (80 g fat), and insulin resistance was measured using the short insulin tolerance test. The results of the study showed that while insulin sensitivity was inversely correlated with red blood cell saturated fatty acid concentration at baseline, the insulin sensitivity of glucose disposal was unaffected by any of the dietary interventions conducted. In measurements of postprandial lipaemia, improvements were observed following the low-saturated fat / high-monounsaturated fat diet and the n- 3 polyunsaturated enriched diet, however the low-saturated fat/ high-carbohydrate diet was associated with a worsening of postprandial lipaemia through an increase in the concentrations of triglyceride-rich-lipoproteins. Changes in fasting biochemical measurements were most evident in the low-saturated / high-monounsaturated diet, with an 11 % reduction in total cholesterol and a 15. 4 % reduction in fasting triglycerides. There were no observed changes in the activity levels or the gene expression of lipoprotein lipase. There was an unexpected positive association between the degree of insulin sensitivity and the extent of postprandial lipaemia, indicating that the link between these pathways is complex and warrants further investigation. Overall this work supports the view that dietary guidelines should be directed towards a change in the composition of fat, to a lower saturated <b>fat</b> intake, a <b>higher</b> <b>monounsaturated</b> <b>fat</b> intake and a lower n- 6 : n- 3 ratio through an increase in the intake of long chain n- 3 polyunsaturated fatty acids...|$|R
