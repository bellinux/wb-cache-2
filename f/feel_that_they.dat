5|$|Demerits: However, competencies, {{efficiency}} and effectiveness can be unclear and contradictory, especially {{when dealing with}} oversimplified matters. In a dehumanized bureaucracy, inflexible in distributing the job-scope, with every worker having to specialize from day one without rotating tasks for fear of decreasing output, tasks are often routine and can contribute to boredom. Thus, employees can sometimes <b>feel</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> {{are not part of}} the organization's work vision and missions. Consequently, they do not have any sense of belonging in the long term. Furthermore, this type of organization tends to invite exploitation and underestimate the potential of the employees, as creativity of the workers is brushed aside in favour of strict adherence to rules, regulations and procedures.|$|E
5|$|While {{the society}} is matrilineal, it is not matriarchal. In past monarchies of the state, {{the son of the}} {{youngest}} sister of the king inherited the throne. Even now in the Meghalaya Legislative Assembly or village councils or panchayats the representation of women in politics is minimal. As of 2013, in a Meghalaya Legislative Assembly of 60 members, there are only four women. In the male centric Dorbar Shnong, which is the basic political arm of the tribes, women are not permitted to hold office. However, women <b>feel</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> take better care of money matters than men and they enjoy economic freedom.|$|E

5|$|The whole {{dramatic}} {{moral of}} Coriolanus {{is that those}} who have little shall have less, and {{that those who have}} much shall take all that others have left. The people are poor; therefore they ought to be starved. They are slaves; therefore they ought to be beaten. They work hard; therefore they ought to be treated like beasts of burden. They are ignorant; therefore they ought not to be allowed to <b>feel</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> want food, or clothing, or rest, that they are enslaved, oppressed, and miserable. This is the logic of the imagination and the passions; which seek to aggrandise what excites admiration and to heap contempt on misery, to raise power into tyranny, and to make tyranny absolute; to thrust down that which is low still lower, and to make wretches desperate: to exalt magistrates into kings, kings into gods; to degrade subjects to the rank of slaves, and slaves to the condition of brutes. The history of mankind is a romance, a mask, a tragedy, constructed upon the principles of poetical justice; it is a noble or royal hunt, in which what is sport to the few is death to the many, and in which the spectators halloo and encourage the strong to set upon the weak, and cry havoc in the chase though they do not share in the spoil. We may depend upon it that what men delight to read in books, they will put in practice in reality.|$|E

25|$|Global {{justice is}} the {{paramount}} to global security, because injustice {{can lead to}} feelings of anger, humiliation, and alienation, which can undermine human dignity. Al-Rodhan argues that humans are primarily driven by emotional self-interest and that protecting humansâ€™ emotional needs is fundamental to human well-being and human dignity. When people <b>feel</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> have {{been the victim of}} unjust decisions, they may try and seek justice by less conventional means such as violence. This, in turn, can promote insecurity. Therefore, justice and not just military power, is essential to maintaining global security. Some obstacles might however arise. Al-Rodhan identifies the disparity in power that exists between states in the current global order as a major obstacle in achieving global justice. Calls for greater global justice are thus likely to continue from disadvantaged societies because they often <b>feel</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> are unjustly subjected to the rules set by more powerful players. However, dominant states that benefit from the current status quo are unlikely to want to alter established institutions or governance structures.|$|E

The UNSC's vehicles were designed by Marcus Lehto, Eric Arroyo, and Eddie Smith, and were designed to be functional and utilitarian. Their use of wheels also led many players to <b>feel</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> were more fun to drive. The addition of the Mongoose ATV made headlines, after being cut from Halo 2. The original Warthog was considered a fan favorite.|$|E
25|$|Controlling abusers may use {{multiple}} {{tactics to}} exert {{power and control}} over their victims. The tactics themselves are psychologically and sometimes physically abusive. Control may be helped through economic abuse thus limiting the victim's actions as they may then lack the necessary resources to resist the abuse. The goal of the abuser is to control and intimidate the victim or to influence them to <b>feel</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> {{do not have an}} equal voice in the relationship.|$|E

25|$|The {{relational}} ties {{principle of}} fusion suggests that highly fused individuals will <b>feel</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> and other group members synergistically strengthen each other. This perception of reciprocal strength should foster {{the perception that}} together, {{members of the group}} are uniquely invulnerable. These feelings of invulnerability may serve to insulate strongly fused individuals from fully recognizing the risks associated with extreme acts. Perceptions of invulnerability have been shown to mediate the effects of fusion on endorsement of pro-group behavior.|$|E

25|$|People with OCD {{understand}} that their notions do not correspond with reality; however, they <b>feel</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> must act as though their notions are correct. For example, an individual who engages in compulsive hoarding might be inclined to treat inorganic matter {{as if it had}} the sentience or rights of living organisms, while accepting that such behavior is irrational on a more intellectual level. There is a debate {{as to whether or not}} hoarding should be considered with other OCD symptoms.|$|E

25|$|Family {{members who}} {{identify}} {{more with the}} culture of their home country may experience frustration when they attempt to instill their cultural values into younger family members. Popular media, schools, and peers act as powerful socializing agents {{and members of the}} older generation may <b>feel</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> cannot compete with these pervasive cultural and social forces. Parents may blame television and magazines for the unwanted change they see in their children and if they decide to act by cracking down on their children's access to popular media, this may lead to further generational schisms.|$|E
25|$|The huge {{losses on}} the battlefields were {{not limited to}} men. The army quickly ran short of rifles and {{ammunition}} (as well as uniforms and food), and, by mid-1915, men were {{being sent to the}} front bearing no arms. It was hoped that they could equip themselves with the arms that they recovered from fallen soldiers, of both sides, on the battlefields. The soldiers did not <b>feel</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> were being treated as human beings, or even as valuable soldiers, but rather as raw materials to be squandered {{for the purposes of the}} rich and powerful.|$|E
25|$|In 2014, the U.S. Veterans Health Administration (VHA) is {{providing}} healthcare services for approximately one million {{gay and lesbian}} veterans. With {{the repeal of the}} Donâ€™t Ask, Donâ€™t Tell policy, more gay and lesbian veterans will be seeking medical care. However, as noted by Sherman and her coauthors, there are many concerns regarding the healthcare needs of the gay and lesbian veterans, and many veterans do not <b>feel</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> have adequate and equitable healthcare services from the VHA. The researchers assert that veterans who are missing quality healthcare are less likely to maintain good health and positive well-being.|$|E
