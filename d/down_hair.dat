25|$|The coarse outer fibers {{have been}} {{traditionally}} used by nomads to make ropes and tents. In earlier times, the coarse hair was mixed with <b>down</b> <b>hair</b> {{to make the}} weaving denser. However, the current increasing demand for the down fiber from the international market means that the fine fiber is mostly sold. The rarity of the white hair implicates that ropes made out of white and black Yarn is admired for its appearance and uniqueness. In west Sichuan, China, 34% of the animal fiber comes from yak hair alone. In Bhutan, the long hair is used for weaving tents, bags, rugs and slings, whereas in Mongolia it is used for clothing tents and bags. To obtain the optimal length, nomads comb the hair and then spin it into yarn. During this process, the loom determines {{the width of the}} tent squares and the length of the tent. The tent squares are then sewn tightly together by men.|$|E
50|$|Awn hairs are the {{intermediate}} hairs in a mammal's coat. They are {{shorter than the}} guard hairs and longer than the <b>down</b> <b>hairs.</b> They help with insulation and protect the <b>down</b> <b>hairs</b> underneath. Most of the visible coat is made {{of this kind of}} hair.|$|R

50|$|The <b>down</b> <b>hair</b> of Orenburg goats is the {{thinnest}} {{in the world}} - 16-18 micrometers, and that of Angora goats (mohair) is 22-24 micrometers. Products made of Orenburg <b>down</b> <b>hair</b> are therefore especially soft and fine. The thinness of hair {{is partly due to}} the severe snowy winters of the Ural mountain steppes, along with particular qualities of feed and living conditions. The Orenburg goat breed can only be reared in the Orenburg Region. Despite being so fine, the fiber is very durable, moreso than wool. The efforts of the French in the 19th century to import Orenburg goats were unsuccessful, as the warm climate of France was not suitable {{for the development of the}} fine <b>down</b> <b>hair.</b> Accordingly, Orenburg goats in France degenerated into ordinary goats with rough thick <b>down</b> <b>hair.</b> In the 18th - 19th centuries France imported tens of thousands of poods (пуд) (an old Russian measure of weight equal to about 36 pounds) of Orenburg goat <b>down</b> <b>hair,</b> which was valued higher than cashmere. The Orenburg shawl became popular in Europe after an enterprise “Imitation a la Orenburg” organized by an English firm “Lipner”.|$|E

5000|$|In many breeds, coat gene {{mutations}} are unwelcome. An {{example is}} the rex allele which appeared in Maine Coons in the early 1990s. Rexes appeared in America, Germany and the UK, where one breeder caused consternation by calling them [...] "Maine Waves". Two UK breeders did test mating which indicated that this was probably a new rex mutation {{and that it was}} recessive. The density of the hair was similar to normally coated Maine Coons, but consisted only of <b>down</b> type <b>hairs</b> with a normal down type helical curl, which varied as in normal <b>down</b> <b>hairs.</b> Whiskers were more curved, but not curly. Maine Coons do not have awn hairs, and after moulting, the rexes had a very thin coat.|$|R

50|$|A quality shawl is knitted from hand-spun yarn: the knitter will spin {{a strong}} <b>down</b> <b>hair</b> yarn and then ply it with commercially spun silk thread. Such a shawl or kerchief will not look downy when first made. They start {{to develop a}} halo when they are worn, and will last for many years. A good knitter can knit two kerchiefs - pautinkas (“spider lines”) of medium size or three tippets a month. It will take {{a month or more}} to knit a large shawl or a kerchief with a pattern or inscription. Because of the high cost of <b>down</b> <b>hair</b> and yarn, an {{original}} hand-made Orenburg shawl or kerchief is an expensive luxury item.|$|E
5000|$|The {{coats of}} {{domestic}} dogs are of two varieties: [...] "double" [...] being common with dogs (as well as wolves) originating from colder climates, {{made up of}} a coarse guard hair and a soft <b>down</b> <b>hair,</b> or [...] "single", with the topcoat only.|$|E
50|$|The {{distinction}} between felted and other fibrous materials {{is not always}} sharp. For example, although truly felted hair on healthy mammals is unusual, many animals, especially in seasonally cold or wet climates or environments, often have a so-called undercoat of <b>down</b> <b>hair</b> plus awn hair that usually lies hidden beneath the outer coat of guard hairs, and may form a mat of lightly felted wool. Such down hairs as a rule are crimped into a finely woolly texture and contain waxy, water-repellent lanolin; in a mass they serve to retain insulating air and exclude water. In many species that live in seasonally frigid zones the winter <b>down</b> <b>hair</b> is shed in clumps during springtime. This is exploited in species such as the muskox; herders collect the wool for commercial purposes without any need for shearing.|$|E

It {{is well known}} that hairiness plays an important role for the frictional and tactile properties of fabrics. In the present, paper, we describe a brush model to predict the friction of hairy fabrics. The new model {{is based on the assumption}} that the deformation of superficial hairs during friction is equivalent to the deformation of the hairy textile structure during surface indentation or compression. The force required to compress a given number of hairs per surface unit can be measured by indentation exeriments and used to predict the force required to lay <b>down</b> <b>hairs</b> during dynamic friction...|$|R
