In one case it may be the father or mother drinks, in another that the child is an orphan, neglected by aunt or stepmother, in another that the mother is an invalid or a sweated worker too overwrought to do much for him, or, though a good-hearted soul, she is careless and dirty or ignorant, or that she is immoral and reckless, {{and so on and so}} on. Our <b>haphazard</b> <b>sample</b> of ten Scotch cases gives instances of nearly all these alternatives. And from these proximate causes one might work back to more general ones, to the necessity of controlling the drink traffic, of abolishing sweating, of shortening women's hours of labour, of suppressing vice. But for the present argument it is not necessary to follow up these special causes. We can make a wider generalization. For our present analysis it is sufficient to say that one more general maladjustment covers every case of neglected or ill-brought-up children in the world, and that is this, that with or without a decent excuse, the parent has not been equal to the task of rearing a civilized citizen. We have demanded too much from the parent, materially and morally, and the ten cases we have quoted are just ten out of ten millions of the replies to that demand. Of fifty-two children born, fourteen are dead; and of the remainder we can hardly regard more than thirteen as being tolerably reared.|$|E
40|$|Detailing {{the genetic}} basis of {{adaptive}} variation in natural populations {{is a first}} step towards understanding the process of adaptive evolution, yet few ecologically relevant traits have been characterized at the genetic level in wild populations. Traits that mediate coevolutionary interactions between species are ideal for studying adaptation because of the intensity of selection and the well-characterized ecological context. We have previously described the ecological context, evolutionary history and partial genetic basis of tetrodotoxin (TTX) resistance in garter snakes (Thamnophis). Derived mutations in a voltage-gated sodium channel gene (Nav 1. 4) in three garter snake species are associated with resistance to TTX, the lethal neurotoxin found in their newt prey (Taricha). Here we evaluate the contribution of Nav 1. 4 alleles to TTX resistance in two of those species from central coastal California. We measured the phenotypes (TTX resistance) and genotypes (Nav 1. 4 and microsatellites) in a local sample of Thamnophis atratus and Thamnophis sirtalis. Allelic variation in Nav 1. 4 explains 23 per cent of the variation in TTX resistance in T. atratus while variation in a <b>haphazard</b> <b>sample</b> of the genome (neutral microsatellite markers) shows no association with the phenotype. Similarly, allelic variation in Nav 1. 4 correlates almost perfectly with TTX resistance in T. sirtalis, but neutral variation does not. These strong correlations suggest that Nav 1. 4 is a major effect locus. The simple genetic architecture of TTX resistance in garter snakes may significantly impact the dynamics of phenotypic coevolution. Fixation of a few alleles of major effect in some garter snake populations may have led to the evolution of extreme phenotypes and an ‘escape’ from the arms race with newts...|$|E

The aim {{of the study was}} to create a clinical impression of the lived experiences of cocaine dependents. A transcendental phenomenological approach was used to elicit the essence of addiction as experienced by the participants. Theoretical sampling ensured relevant participants were selected through <b>haphazard</b> <b>sampling</b> procedures. Data was collected through the use of biographical questionnaires and individual, semi-structured interviews with three cocaine dependents. Data was processed according to the four phenomenological principles epoche, phenomenological reduction, imaginative variation and synthesis using Tesch’s eight steps. The essence of cocaine dependency is contained in the psychological experiences of the drug which define and perpetuate that addiction. The psychological addiction develops prior to physical dependence resulting in an entrenched addiction before treatment is sought by the cocaine dependent...|$|R
40|$|Phylogenetic {{research}} is often stymied by {{selection of a}} marker that leads to poor phylogenetic resolution despite considerable cost and effort. Profiles of phylogenetic informativeness provide a quantitative measure for prioritizing gene sampling to resolve branching order in a particular epoch. To evaluate the utility of these profiles, we analyzed phylogenomic data sets from metazoans, fungi, and mammals, thus encompassing diverse time scales and taxonomic groups. We also evaluated the utility of profiles created based on simulated data sets. We found that genes selected via their informativeness dramatically outperformed <b>haphazard</b> <b>sampling</b> of markers. Furthermore, our analyses demonstrate that the original phylogenetic informativeness method can be extended to trees with more than four taxa. Thus, although the method currently predicts phylogenetic signal without specifically accounting for the misleading effects of stochastic noise, it is robust {{to the effects of}} homoplasy. The phylogenetic informativeness rankings obtained will allow other researchers to select advantageous genes for future studies within these clades, maximizing return on effort and investment. Genes identified might also yield efficient experimental designs for phylogenetic inference for many sister clades and outgroup taxa that are closely related to the diverse groups of organisms analyzed...|$|R
40|$|Introgression is an {{important}} evolutionary force, {{which can lead to}} adaptation and speciation on one hand, {{but on the other hand}} also to genetic extinction. It is in the latter sense that introgression is a major conservation concern, especially when domestic species reproduce with their rare wild relatives. Hence, monitoring introgression in natural populations subject to hybridization is crucial to elucidate the threat represented by introgression. Here, we monitored introgression between wildcats (Felis silvestris silvestris) and domestic cats (Felis silvestris catus) in a wildcat population in the Swiss Jura Mountains using systematically and non-invasively collected hair samples. We found 21 % admixed individuals based on 68 diagnostic nuclear SNP-markers, corresponding to a migration rate from domestic cats to wildcats of 0. 02 migrants per generation. In contrast, gene flow from wildcats into domestic cats was negligible. <b>Haphazard</b> <b>sampling</b> of the same wildcat population, mostly via road kills, led to similar results. Hybridization occurred between wildcat male and domestic cat female and vice versa and, based on the occurrence of backcrosses, both female and male F 1 -hybrids seem viable and fertile. The observed hybridization pattern may indicate an expanding wildcat population with introgression as a byproduct of this expansion but alternative explanations cannot be excluded with the current data...|$|R

Performance evaluation and grading the insurance company in addition to determining the general position of agency in industry, market and informing the beneficiaries, cause increase in competition, dynamism in industry, and development in community. On the other hand, organization strategic performance evaluation is always one the first and most basic prerequisites for compiling improvement programs in organizations and it has a high importance. One of the strategic efficient models in this aspect is BSC that equally analyses all aspects of organization. The statistical population in this research is consists of four governmental insurance (Iran, Asia, Dana and Alborz). For collecting data, <b>haphazard</b> <b>sampling</b> procedure was used. Study tool is questionnaire whose reliability was measured by consistency ratio and whose validity was measured by content-construct method by acquiring the opinions of experts and some managers in this field of study and the results showed appropriate reliability and validity.

Social networking sites {{are changing the}} way individuals {{communicate with each other}} and the world. Social networking sites (SNS) provide users with a unique computer-mediated environment where individuals are able to disclose their thoughts, feelings, and experiences within their own social network. The present study aims to explore the experiences of young adults regarding Facebook. A transcendental phenomenological approach was used to elicit the essence of the experiences of the participants.

40|$|Chronic non-communicable {{diseases}} such as diabetes and asthma are somewhat neglected {{in the field of}} medicine in favour of the more ?classic? infections such as HIV/AIDS,and tuberculosis. The overall worldwide prevalence of diabetes is gradually increasing and is mainly associated with many chronic vascular complications such as stroke, foot ulceration and coronary artery disease. For this reason a multiple linear regression model is proposed that will provide insights into the major risk factors of Type 2 diabetes. Objectives: The objective {{of this study is to}} examine the relationship between glycemia and some established Type 2 diabetes risk factors; in particular, stress, age, obesity, gender, and hypertension using multiple linear regression in the Zimbabwean population. Methods: The method consists of collecting data using a structured questionnaire from a sample of 300 individuals selected from a population through the ?<b>haphazard?</b> <b>sampling</b> technique. In this study we considered Type 2 diabetes because our assessment of glycemia was based on portable glucometer readings. We then develop a statistical model to predict glucose levels. Results: Two predictor variables age and body mass index were found to be significant in the model. Results show an overwhelming evidence of a strong relationship between age, obesity and Type 2 diabetes. Conclusion: Our findings are in agreement with results from Sudan in Africa and also observations from affluentsocieties. However, these findings differ significantly from other African experiences such as Kenya. Without loss of generality, it is concluded that obesity and advancing age are major contributors of Type 2 diabetes...|$|R

40|$|This bibliography, an {{apparently}} <b>haphazard</b> <b>sampling</b> of literature from many sources, {{grew out of}} a general project that was intended to elucidate the role of consumers in the forest system. The 124 articles briefly abstracted here are ones that give some insight into the role of foliage-feeding insects. The process of consumption and its effect on the forest were explored most thoroughly. This {{is by no means a}} complete listing; however, some review articles are cited that will provide an in-depth look into a few specialized subjects. I had three objectives in this search of the literature: (1) to locate materials relevant to the impact or role of foliage-feeding insects in the forest system, (2) to aid in forming concepts of possible control functions exerted by these insects, and (3) to find information necessary for building energy-flow models. Literature strictly related to the stated objectives was scarce. Closely allied fields also were explored and articles containing data, models, and background information on insects in other systems are included in the bibliography. Population models are not included, because some good bibliographies already list them. Originally, the direct impact of insects on forest trees was the subject for the literature search, but the subject was expanded as more facets of the role of foliage-feeding insects became apparent. The topic was expanded to include (1) the gross observed impact of defoliation and (2) aspects of tree physiology that could be affected by insects, but where insects are not directly considered. Because the process of consumption was an important focal point, literature on factors that affect consumption rates [...] such as feeding stimulation, assimilation efficiency, ability to locate food, nutritional requirements, and food quality [...] also were explored. Insect energetics and environmental effects on physiological processes were included in the literature search to aid in the formulation of energy-flow models. I hope this bibliography will serve, not just as a listing, but as a stimulant to a greater expansion of the topics explored. Each article included here has been abstracted briefly and given a set of key words. Some articles were of interest mainly because they contained relevant data. How these data were related is included in the abstract. A sampling of the table headings gives the gist of the contents. Articles with background material for concepts may have only topics of discussion listed. Key ideas were given when these could be expressed briefly. Many articles contain much more information than is indicated by the abstract or key word set. Inclusion of articles and of specific information within their abstracts was at the discretion of the reviewer with, presumably, the rational objectives in mind...|$|R
40|$|Evolutionary {{relationships}} within Amoebozoa {{have been the}} subject of controversy for two reasons: 1) paucity of morphological characters in traditional surveys and 2) <b>haphazard</b> taxonomic <b>sampling</b> in modern molecular reconstructions. These along with other factors have prevented the erection of a definitive system that resolves confidently both higher and lower-level relationships. Additionally, the recent recognition that many protosteloid amoebae are in fact scattered throughout the Amoebozoa suggests that phylogenetic reconstructions have been excluding an extensive and integral group of organisms. Here we provide a comprehensive phylogenetic reconstruction based on 139 taxa using molecular information from both SSU-rDNA and actin genes. We provide molecular data for 13 of those taxa, 12 of which had not been previously characterized. We explored the dataset extensively by generating 18 alternative reconstructions that assess the effect of missing data, long-branched taxa, unstable taxa, fast evolving sites and inclusion of environmental sequences. We compared reconstructions with each other as well as against previously published phylogenies. Our analyses show that many of the morphologically established lower-level relationships (defined here as relationships roughly equivalent to Order level or below) are congruent with molecular data. However, the data are insufficient to corroborate or reject the large majority of proposed higher-level relationships (above the Order-level), with the exception of Tubulinea, Archamoebae and Myxogastrea, which are consistently recovered. Moreover, contrary to previous expectations, the inclusion of availabl...|$|R
40|$|Oito carragenófitas, da costa portuguesa, representando sete géneros e quatro famílias das Gigartinales, foram estudadas na baía de Buarcos durante cerca de um ano (estudo da variações sazonais) e em quinze estações costeiras (estudo das variações geográficas), localizadas entre o Baleal (Peniche) e Moledo. Em geral, o comprimento e a biomassa das carragenófitas estudadas apresentam variações sazonais, com um incremento no início da Primavera (Abril), um aumento acentuado no início do Verão (Junho/Julho) e valores reduzidos no final do Verão, Outono e Inverno. O maior conteúdo médio em carragenana foi registado numa amostra de Chondracanthus acicularis (40. 1 %), seguido dos valores registados nas amostras de Gigartina pistillata (38. 7 %) e Chondracanthus teedei var. lusitanicus (34. 9 %). As carragenófitas com maior cobertura e biomassa foram as seguintes: Chondrus crispus (3. 75 % - 570 g m- 2); C. acicularis (3. 45 % - 99 g m- 2); C. teedei var. lusitanicus (2. 51 % - 208 g m- 2); Mastocarpus stellatus (2. 02 % - 520 g m- 2). Para a caracterização dos diferentes tipos de carragenana foram usadas as técnicas espectroscópicas: FTIR-ATR, FT-Raman, 1 H e 13 C-RMN. Com base nestas técnicas, nomeadamente em FTIR-ATR e FT-Raman, foram desenvolvidas metodologias inovadoras que nos permitiram a correcta identificação das diversas fracções de carragenana, em {{particular}} das variantes da família lambda (carragenana lambda, ksi e theta) e dos precursores biológicos (mu e nu) das carragenanas gelificantes (kappa e iota, respectivamente). Visto que as amostras foram sujeitas a uma manipulação mínima (as algas são simplesmente secas e moídas), a composição determinada representa, o mais fielmente possível, a composição natural dos ficocolóides. A espectroscopia de ressonância magnética nuclear do protão e do carbono 13 foi usada na caracterização e quantificação dos diferentes componentes das carragenanas extraídas. Eight carrageenophytes {{from the}} Central and Northern coast of Portugal, representing seven genera and four families of Gigartinales, were studied {{for a period}} of one year (seasonal variation studies) in the Buarcos bay and in fifteen other different coastal stations (geographic variation studies) from Baleal (Peniche), in the Central zone, to Moledo, in the Northern zone. The reproductive status, dry weight and carrageenan content have been followed by monthly random sampling. In general, the plant size and the biomass shows a seasonal increase in early Spring (April), a marked increase in early Summer (June/July) and low values in late Summer, Autumn and Winter. The low colloid content in Winter (December) and the high colloid content in Summer (July) can be related to high and low nutrient (N and P, mainly) contents of the water, respectively. The highest average carrageenan yield was found in Chondracanthus acicularis (40. 1 %), Gigartina pistillata (38. 7 %) and Chondracanthus teedei var. lusitanicus (34. 9 %). The <b>haphazard</b> <b>sampling</b> method (with quadrates) was used to determine the biomass and the continuous sampling method, applied along a perpendicular transept to the shoreline, was used to calculate the carrageenophytes cover in two periods: Autumn/Winter and Spring/Summer. The following results must be enhanced: the highest cover and biomass was found in Chondrus crispus (3. 75 % - 570 g m- 2), Chondracanthus acicularis (3. 45 % - 99 g m- 2), Chondracanthus teedei var. lusitanicus (2. 51 % - 208 g m- 2) and Mastocarpus stellatus (2. 02 % - 520 g m- 2). In order to characterize the different carrageenan types, vibrational (Infrared and Raman) and resonance (1 H and 13 C-NMR) spectroscopy has been used to show detailed information concerning the properties and structure of these polysaccharides at molecular level. In this work some techniques of analysis based on the FTIR-ATR and FT-Raman spectroscopy have been developed in order to obtain an accurate identification of the diverse carrageenan fractions, with particular relief for the variants of lambda-family (lambda, ksi and theta) and for the biological precursors (mu and nu) of the gelling carrageenans (kappa and iota, respectively). Because the samples are minimally treated (dried ground algal material), the determined composition represents, as accurately as possible, the natural composition of the colloids. The spectra of both commercial carrageenan samples and common carrageenophytes were used as reference. The NMR (1 H and 13 C) spectroscopy was used in order to characterize and quantify the different carrageenan fractions in the extracted phycocolloids (water and alkali extractions). A new set of 13 C and 1 H-NMR chemical shifts of most common carrageenan types is given relative to DSS as the internal standard according to the IUPAC recommendations. Moreover, the chemical shifts of characteristic signal for pyruvate acetal and floridean starch are reported. Relatively to the carrageenan types, the following results are to be enhanced: female gametophytes and non-fertile thalli samples of C. crispus, M. stellatus, C. teedei var. lusitanicus, G. pistillata, C. acicularis and Gymnogongrus crenulatus, show a significant degree of kappa-iota hybrid carrageenan (copolymers of kappa-iota carrageenan). Relative amounts of the different gelling carrageenan fractions were determined with 1 H-NMR. The carrageenans extracted from Ahnfeltiopsis devoniensis are mainly constituted by iota-carrageenan, but seasonal variations in the nature of carrageenans are present. Lambda-family carrageenans were found in tetrasporophytes of C. cripus (lambda carrageenan), M. stellatus (lambda carrageenan), C. teedei var. lusitanicus (hybrid ksi-theta carrageenan), C. aciculais (hybrid ksi-theta carrageenan) and G. pistillata (hybrid ksi-lambda carrageenan). Calliblepharis jubata presents carrageenans of iota-type in all reproductive stages. Considering these results, based on FTIR-ATR, FT-Raman and 1 H-NMR techniques, more sensible than 13 C-NMR, we can conclude that the carragenana kappa and iota have distinct biological precursors, mu and nu respectively. The “soft” alkaline extraction method, used in this work, makes possible the carrageenan extraction with low degradation and high molecular weight. Taking in consideration the high available biomass and the phycocolloid content of the Chondracanthus species and Gigartina pistillata they are a potentially important source of copolymers of kappa-iota carrageenan, in addition to the traditionally harvested carrageenophytes (M. stellatus and C. crispus). However, collection of seaweeds from rocky shore has its limitations, as it always contains the risk of overcollection and subsequent loss of the population. The next step, in the near future, will be to develop further studies in order to introduce these carrageenophytes in the aquaculture integrated systems. In this work, fronds of G. pistillata exhibiting both tetrasporangial sori and cystocarps, i. e., tetraspores and carpospores (heterosporic thalli), were found in several costal stations. In order to clarify the nature and function of these reproductive structures, it’s morphological, cytological and biochemical study was carried out. Other morphological, citochemical and ultrastructural studies were performed in selected carrageenophytes in order to study both the carpospore/tetraspore formation (C. teedei var. lusitanicus) and polysaccharide distribution (cellulose and carrageenan) in the thalli and cell walls (G. crenulatus, A. devoniensis and G. pistillata).
