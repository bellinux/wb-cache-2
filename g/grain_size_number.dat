40|$|A fine, uniform {{grain size}} is {{required}} for creep limited Waspaloy in aircraft engine applications. Upon heating, Waspaloy does not always recrystallize {{in a uniform manner}} resulting in occasional large grains with a majority of the grains meeting the grain size requirements. Waspaloy’s microstructure was analyzed with different heat treatments and in the as-forged condition. The strengthening mechanism is the gamma prime phase. The gamma prime solvus temperature is 1908 °F so the different heat treatments were determined around that temperature, as well as the forging temperature range of 1800 - 2150 °F. At the 1850 °F heat treatment, the microstructure recrystallized with small grains, slightly larger than the as-forged samples. The samples heat treated at 1900 °F had microstructures showing the sample recrystallized with larger grains surrounding the smaller grains with an ASTM grain size 5. The samples heat treated at 1925 °F appeared similar to the samples that were heat treated at 1900 °F, but had an ASTM <b>grain</b> <b>size</b> <b>number</b> slightly larger with an ASTM <b>grain</b> <b>size</b> <b>number</b> of 4. 76. The samples heat treated at 1950 °F showed larger grains than the previous heat treatments with an ASTM grain size 3. 92. The samples heat treated at 2000 °F showed much larger grains than the other heat treatments. The average grain size for the samples at 2000 °F were about 2. 4. The samples fell into the ASTM <b>grain</b> <b>size</b> <b>number</b> requirement for Schlosser at an ASTM grain size of 3 or finer, except for the heat treatments at 2000 °F. The as-forged sample was approximately ASTM grain size 6. The recommended heat treatment temperature is 1925 °F because it has the gamma prime strengthening mechanism and complies with Schlosser’s ASTM <b>grain</b> <b>size</b> <b>number</b> specification requirements...|$|E

40|$|The {{effect of}} <b>grain</b> <b>size</b> on the {{susceptibility}} of high-strength {{low alloy steels}} to hydrogen environment embrittlement in a 45 MPa gaseous hydrogen atmosphere was examined in term of the hydrogen content penetrating the specimen during the deformation. Notch tensile tests were performed in a 45 MPa hydrogen environment using specimens with different prior austenite <b>grain</b> <b>size</b> <b>numbers</b> varying from 2. 5 to 5. 4. The hydrogen content was measured by thermal desorption analysis with a quadrupole mass spectrometer {{before and after the}} tensile test. The fracture stress of the notch tensile test increased with increasing <b>grain</b> <b>size</b> number; this showed that grain refinement was effective in reducing the susceptibility of the specimens to hydrogen environment embrittlement in a high-pressure hydrogen atmosphere. The addition of nickel did not affect the fracture stress. A remarkable increase in the content of diffusive hydrogen was observed after the notch tensile test. Assuming that part of the diffusive hydrogen desorbed from grain boundaries, it can be inferred that grain refinement can reduce the mass of hydrogen in the unit grain boundary area, and the susceptibility to high-pressure hydrogen environment embrittlement.

40|$|Corrosion {{problem which}} exists in {{every stage of}} oil and gas {{production}} has been a great challenge to the operators in the industry. The conventional carbon steel with all its inherent advantages has been adjudged susceptible to the aggressive corrosion environment of oilfield. This has aroused increased interest in the use of micro alloyed steels for oil and gas production and transportation. The corrosion behavior of three commercially supplied micro alloyed steels designated as A, B, and C have been investigated with API 5 L X 65 as reference samples. Electrochemical corrosion tests were conducted in an unbuffered 3. 5 wt% NaCl solution saturated with CO 2 at 30 0 C for 24 hours. Pre-corrosion analyses revealed that samples A, B and X 65 consist of ferrite-pearlite microstructures but with different grain sizes, shapes and distribution whereas sample C has bainitic microstructure with dispersed acicular ferrites. The results of the electrochemical corrosion tests showed that within the experimental conditions, the corrosion rate of the samples can be ranked as CR(A) < CR(X 65) < CR(B) < CR(C). These results are attributed to difference in microstructures of the samples as depicted by ASTM <b>grain</b> <b>size</b> <b>number</b> in accordance with ASTM E 112 - 12 Standard and ferrite-pearlite volume fractions determined by ImageJ Fiji grain size analysis software...|$|E

Relationships between the heat treatments and the resulting gamma distributions were evaluated. Statistical correlations between the gamma distributions and the reported tensile strengths, creep resistances, and dwell crack growth resistances were separately assessed for each alloy. To avoid the effects of grain size related mechanisms, the grain size of the samples used in the correlations for each alloy were limited to narrow ranges of about 1. 5 in ASTM <b>grain</b> <b>size</b> <b>number.</b> In both alloys, yield and tensile strength increased with increasing fraction of medium sized gamma.

Time to 0. 2 percent creep in SR 3 increased with increasing medium gamma volume fraction, and decreasing fine gamma sizes. However, 0. 2 percent creep time was not clearly correlated with the gamma microstructures of KM 4 specimens, apparently due to effects of stabilization heat treatments which greatly suppress creep resistance.

40|$|This {{program was}} {{undertaken}} {{to develop a}} microalloy-modified grade of standard carburizing steel that can successfully exploit the high temperature carburizing capabilities of current commercial low pressure (i. e. 'vacuum') carburizing systems. Such steels can lower {{the amount of energy}} required for commercial carburizing operations by reducing the time required for deep-case carburizing operations. The specific technical objective of the work was to demonstrate a carburizing steel composition capable of maintaining a prior austenite grain size no larger than ASTM <b>grain</b> <b>size</b> <b>number</b> 5 after exposure to simulated carburizing conditions of 1050 C for 8 hr. Such thermal exposure should be adequate for producing carburized case depths up to about 2 mm. Such carburizing steels are expected to be attractive for use across a wide range of industries, including the petroleum, chemical, forest products, automotive, mining and industrial equipment industries. They have potential for reducing energy usage during low pressure carburizing by more than 25 %, as well as reducing cycle times and process costs substantially. They also have potential for reducing greenhouse gas emissions from existing low pressure carburizing furnaces by more than 25 %. High temperature carburizing can be done in most modern low pressure carburizing systems with no additional capital investment. Accordingly, implementing this technology on carburizing furnaces will provide a return on investment significantly greater than 10 %. If disseminated throughout the domestic carburizing community, the technology has potential for saving on the order of 23 to 34 trillion BTU/year in industrial energy usage. Under the program, two compositions of microalloyed, coarsening-resistant low alloy carburizing steels were developed, produced and evaluated. After vacuum annealing at 1050 oC for 8 hrs and high pressure gas quenching, both steels exhibited a prior austenite ASTM <b>grain</b> <b>size</b> <b>number</b> of 5. 0 or finer. For comparison, a control alloy of similar composition but without the microalloy additions exhibited a duplex prior austenite grain size with grains ranging from ASTM grain size 3 down to ASTM grain size 1 after similar processing and thermal exposure. These results confirm the potential for using microalloy additions of Ti, B, Nb, Al, rare earths and/or N for austenite grain size control in Cr-Mo (i. e. 4000 -series) low alloy carburizing steels. They also demonstrate that these microalloy additions will not compromise the processability of the steel; all three materials produced under the program could be hot worked readily using normal steel processing protocols. To fully realize the technical and commercial potential of these steels, {{there is a need to}} continue development work using larger-scale heats. These larger-scale heats are needed to provide adequate material for fatigue testing of quenched and tempered alloys, to conduct more complete investigations of potential alloy chemistries and to provide additional material for processing studies. It will also be beneficial to carefully review intellectual property issues associated with this family of steels, since existing Japanese patent literature suggests that significant microstructural and/or process characterization work may be needed on new materials to confirm that these materials fall outside existing patent claims...|$|E

The plant harboring the mutant version 08 sg 2 locus exhibited a decreased <b>grain</b> <b>size,</b> <b>grain</b> <b>number</b> and plant height.

Making a ballast tank less susceptible to corrosion can, therefore, prolong the useful life of a ship and, thereby, lower its operational cost. An option to reinforce a ballast tank is to construct {{it out of a}} corrosion-resistant steel type. Such steel was recently produced by POSCO Ltd., South Korea. After 6 months of permanent immersion, the average corrosion rate of A and AH steel (31 samples) was 535 g m− 2 year− 1, while the Korean CRS was corroding with 378 g m− 2 year− 1. This entails a gain of 29 %. Follow-up measurements after 10, 20, and 24 months confirmed this. The results after 6 months exposure to alternating wet/dry conditions are even more explicit. Furthermore, the physical and metallurgical properties of this steel show a density of 7. 646 t/m 3, the elasticity modulus 209. 3 GPa, the tensile strength 572 MPa, and the hardness 169 HV 10.

The difference in plant height between TNG 67 and the transgenic lines was not significant until approximately 50 DAI, when the transgenic lines started heading (Figure  1 D). The plant height of transgenic lines was retarded after 50 DAI, and the plants essentially stopped growing after 60 DAI (Figure  1 D).

40|$|An 11 -year study {{provides}} data on saltating sand driven across a barren, bouldery alluvial plain by strong unidirectional wind. By weight, 50 per {{cent of the}} grains travel within 5 inches, and 90 per cent, within 25 inches of the ground. Maximum height attained exceeds 10 feet, even for grains of 3 – 4 mm. Weight of each grain-size fraction decreases with height, except for particles smaller than 0. 062 mm which are presumably in suspension. The weight percentage of grains smaller than 0. 125 mm increases with height, that of grains between 0. 25 and 0. 125 mm decreases with height, and that of still larger grains peaks out at heights increasing with size. This suggests that grains smaller than 0. 125 mm are affected by turbulence, and that the rebound height of particles larger than 0. 25 mm varies directly with grain size. Grains between 0. 125 and 0. 25 mm are too large to be significantly affected by turbulence and too small for high rebound. Arithmetic mean grain size within the saltating curtain attains its maximum at heights between 10 and 40 inches, the higher values occurring with stronger winds. Maximum wear of 0. 038 inch in 10 years on a vertical lucite rod occurred 9 inches above the ground.

Smaller cubes similarly turned over and in addition fell sidewise several times in 11 years. Rotation up to 90 ° on a near-vertical axis accompanied some overturns.

Nominal <b>grain</b> <b>size</b> <b>numbers</b> should correlate with peak temperature (and therefore degree of partial melting) if it is a good melting indicator. The convolution index is not directly testable with these experiments because the experiments do not actually create chondrules (and therefore they have no outline on which to measure a CVI).

A lower number of dislocations per grain results in a lower dislocation 'pressure' building up at grain boundaries. This {{makes it more difficult}} for dislocations to move into adjacent grains.

40|$|It is {{well-known}} that sediment composition strongly depends on <b>grain</b> <b>size.</b> A <b>number</b> {{of studies have}} tried to quantify this relationship focusing on the sand fraction, but only very limited data exists covering wider <b>grain</b> <b>size</b> ranges. Geologists have a clear conceptual model {{of the relation between}} <b>grain</b> <b>size</b> and sediment petrograpic composition, typically displayed in evolution diagrams. We chose a classical model covering <b>grain</b> <b>sizes</b> from fine gravel to clay, and distinguishing five types of grains (rock fragments, poly- and mono crystalline quartz, feldspar and mica/clay). A compositional linear process is fitted here to a digitized version of this model, by (i) applying classical regression to the set of all pairwise log-ratios of the 5 -part composition against <b>grain</b> <b>size,</b> and (ii) looking for the compositions that best approximate the set of estimated parameters, one acting as slope and one as intercept. The method is useful even in the presence of several missing values. The linear fit suggests that the relative influence of the processes controlling the relationship between <b>grain</b> <b>size</b> and sediment composition is constant along most of the <b>grain</b> <b>size</b> spectrum.

30|$|<b>Grain</b> <b>size</b> and <b>grain</b> <b>number</b> are {{the most}} {{important}} factors determining grain yield in rice. So far, a lot of genes related to <b>grain</b> <b>size</b> and <b>number</b> have been documented. Regarding <b>grain</b> <b>size,</b> multiple signaling pathways that influence <b>grain</b> <b>size</b> have been identified in rice (Li and Li 2014, 2016; Zheng et al. 2015; Zuo and Li 2014), including the ubiquitination-mediated proteasomal degradation pathway, G-protein signaling pathway, the mitogen-activated protein kinase signaling pathway, transcriptional regulatory factors and phytohormone pathways. The ubiquitination-mediated proteasomal degradation pathway includes GW 2 (Song et al. 2007) and GW 5 /qSW 5 (Shomura et al. 2008; Weng et al. 2008), and the G-protein signaling pathway includes GS 3 and DEP 1. GS 3 is a homolog of AGG 3, the G protein γ-subunit of Arabidopsis (Li et al. 2012), which encodes a putative transmembrane protein and functions as a negative regulator for <b>grain</b> <b>size</b> (Fan et al. 2006; Mao et al. 2010). DEP 1 encodes a plant-specific G protein γ subunit and mutants in it have short grains (Huang et al. 2009). The mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling pathway includes OsMKK 4 and OsMAPK 6. OsMAPK 6 interacts strongly with OsMKK 4, indicating that the OsMKK 4 -OsMAPK 6 cascade influences <b>grain</b> <b>size</b> in rice (Duan et al. 2014; Liu et al. 2015). The transcriptional regulatory factors pathway includes GW 8, GLW 7 and GS 2 /GL 2 /GLW 2 /OsGRF 4. GW 8 and GLW 7 encode the plant-specific transcription factors OsSPL 16 and OsSPL 13 (Si et al. 2016; Wang et al. 2012), respectively. GS 2 /GL 2 /GLW 2 encodes a transcription factor Growth-Regulating Factor 4 (OsGRF 4), which regulates grain length and width mainly by promoting cell expansion (Che et al. 2015; Duan et al. 2015; Hu et al. 2015; Li et al. 2016). Another important signaling pathway controlling <b>grain</b> <b>size</b> is phytohormone pathway, which has been proven to {{play a crucial role in}} rice development, especially in the course of grain growth. For example, GS 5, a putative serine carboxypeptidase, functions as a positive regulator of <b>grain</b> <b>size</b> (Li et al. 2011), and inhibits the interaction between OsBAK 1 - 7 and OsMSBP 1, suggesting that GS 5 might regulate <b>grain</b> <b>size</b> through the brassinosteroids (BR) signaling pathway (Xu et al. 2015). GL 3.1 /qGL 3 encodes a putative protein phosphatase with a Kelch-like repeat domain (OsPPKL 1), and may function as a negative regulator through BR signaling in rice (Hu et al. 2012; Qi et al. 2012; Zhang et al. 2012). Regarding grain number, many QTLs and genes have been cloned, such as Gn 1 a (Ashikari et al. 2005), DEP 1 (Yan et al. 2007), DEP 3 (Qiao et al. 2011), GNP 1 (Wu et al. 2016 b) and GAD 1 (Jin et al. 2016). However, as complex agronomic traits, the regulatory mechanism of <b>grain</b> <b>size</b> and <b>number</b> remains largely unknown.|$|R

40|$|Characterisation of {{defects in}} solar cell {{material}} is one step towards higher {{energy conversion efficiency}} of solar cells. The method {{used in this study}} allows detection across the wafer of defects causing radiative SRH recombination. In this experiment 30 unpassivated, full size mc-Si wafers from three different ingots are cooled to 90 K. Emissions after excitation with a 808 nm laser are detected by scanning the samples with a hyperspectral camera recording in the range 900 - 2500 nm, which includes both band-to-band photoluminescence (BB-PL) and defect related luminescence (DRL). Multivariate Curve Resolution (MCR) statistical analysis is used to separate the recorded emission into different signals. Even though surface recombination greatly influences the results, eight different signals were found for the most signal-rich wafers from one ingot (B 2). Although all samples from one ingot are believed to contain the same types of defects, emissions were only separated into a few signals for the most defect-rich samples. Wafers from the B 2 ingot are standard mc-Si wafers, with both <b>grain</b> <b>size</b> and <b>number</b> of emission signals successfully differentiated increasing with increasing height on the ingot. The wafers from the two other ingots are HPM Si wafers, and are more stable in respect to both <b>grain</b> <b>size</b> and <b>number</b> of signals differentiated from wafers from different heights on the ingot. Emission signals were identified as being of specific energy, but they were not always distinctively coupled with emission signals from literature. M-M...|$|R

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to estimate the direct and indirect effects of agronomic and culinary traits on iron and zinc contents in 11 cowpea populations. Correlations between traits were estimated and decomposed into direct and indirect effects using path analysis. For the study populations, breeding for larger <b>grain</b> <b>size,</b> higher <b>number</b> of <b>grains</b> per pod, grain yield, reduced cooking time, and number of days to flowering can lead to decreases in the levels of iron and zinc in the grain. Genetic gains for the iron content can be obtained by direct selection for protein content by indirect effects on the number of grains per pod, 100 -grain weight and grain yield. The positive direct effect of <b>grain</b> <b>size</b> and protein content on the zinc content indicates the possibility of simultaneous gain by combined selection of these traits. 201...|$|R
