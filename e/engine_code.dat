5|$|In August and September, {{the first}} {{screenshots}} of Duke Nukem Forever were released in PC Gamer. However, 3D Realms {{did not receive}} the Quake II <b>engine</b> <b>code</b> until November 1997, and the earlier screenshots were mock-ups with the Quake engine that the team had made in their spare time. 3D Realms unveiled the first video footage of Duke Nukem Forever using the Quake II engine at the 1998 Electronic Entertainment Expo (E3) conference. The trailer showed Duke fighting {{on the back of}} a moving truck and firefights with aliens. While critics were impressed, Broussard was not happy with the progress being made.|$|E
25|$|The SC/Rambler {{has become}} a popular muscle car to {{replicate}} because of the ease of installing a powerful AMC V8 drivetrain {{into one of the}} large number of inexpensive 1966 through 1969 Rambler Americans. To identify a true SC/Rambler, it must be a hardtop and the Vehicle Identification Number (VIN) must have the letter M in the third digit and the <b>engine</b> <b>code</b> of X as the seventh digit.|$|E
500|$|Several {{problems}} were encountered during the project. Because the team comprised two software companies, tension emerged regarding job assignments and some developers left the project. Additionally, many employees were largely inexperienced, but in retrospect project manager Jonathan Chey felt this was advantageous, stating [...] "inexperience also bred enthusiasm and commitment {{that might not}} have been present with a more jaded set of developers." [...] The Dark Engine posed problems of its own. It was unfinished, forcing the programmers to fix software bugs when encountered. In contrast, working closely with the <b>engine</b> <b>code</b> allowed them to write additional features. Not all setbacks were localized; a demonstration build at E3 was hindered when it was requested all guns be removed from the presentation due to then-recent Columbine High School massacre.|$|E

2500|$|In July 1973 the New Fronte {{became the}} old Fronte {{as it was}} {{replaced}} by the new LC20. Its very rounded [...] "Oval Shell" [...] design was a radical departure from its predecessor, very much {{in the style of the}} 1970 Datsun Cherry E10. The underpinnings remained largely the same, however, retaining the water-cooled engines and suspension from the LC10 with a 20mm longer wheelbase (2030mm). Overall dimensions, dictated by the kei-car regulations, remained 2995×1295mm. The air-cooled engines were discontinued, but the <b>engine</b> <b>code</b> remained LC10W - with the [...] "W" [...] denoting water-cooling. The radiator is mounted up front.|$|E
2500|$|In May 1971, as kei {{cars were}} {{becoming}} more and more sophisticated, a water-cooled version was presented. The air-cooled versions were soon relegated to use only in the cheapest versions, and disappeared entirely after 1973 as emissions standards became more stringent. The watercooled versions also had slightly better weight distribution (38/62 versus 37.5/62.5), due to the radiator being mounted up front. This, the LC10W, was the only engine ever to be installed in the iconic Suzuki Fronte Coupé, whether in domestic or export market cars. The new 1973-1976 [...] "oval shell" [...] Fronte received the new LC20 chassis code but retained the LC10W <b>engine</b> <b>code.</b>|$|E
2500|$|American Motors did {{not provide}} {{identification}} on the engine block, known as VIN stamping, as some other car manufacturers had been doing at that time. Other than the actual displacement, {{there was no way}} to associate a vehicle with the original [...] "born with" [...] engine. Since this was common practice at the GM and Chrysler plants it is much easier to verify that the exact engine in the car is actually the factory original unit. Each AMC vehicle was inspected to confirm that the engine displacement (identified by numbers cast on the block under the engine mounts) corresponded to its corresponding <b>engine</b> <b>code</b> in the vehicle identification number (VIN). A tag screwed to the valve cover provides an engine's build date, and that date code always preceded a specific car's production sequence. However, there is no engine [...] "numbers matching" [...] test for AMXs or any other AMC automobiles.|$|E

2500|$|A vinyl-roofed Landau option with {{simulated}} S-bars {{was added}} to the Thunderbird for 1962 as was a Sports Roadster package for convertible models. The Sports Roadster included 48-spoke Kelsey Hayes-designed wire wheels and a special fiberglass tonneau cover for the rear seats which gave the car the appearance of a two-seat roadster like the original Thunderbird. The Sports Roadster package was slow-selling due the high price of the package and complexity of the tonneau cover, resulting in few Thunderbirds being equipped with it. Newly optional for 1962 was an upgraded version of the [...] V8 called the [...] "M-Code" [...] (a nickname used in reference to the letter M used as the <b>engine</b> <b>code</b> in the VIN in cars so equipped). The M-Code version of the [...] V8 was equipped with three two-barrel Holley carburetors and could produce [...] M-Code V8 Thunderbirds are exceptionally rare with only 200 being sold between 1962 and 1963. For 1963 only, Y-code cars could come equipped with the same 390 cubic inch V-8 also equipped by the factory with tri-power carburetors only if the buyer desired air conditioning.|$|E
