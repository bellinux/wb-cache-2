Nonetheless, problems with hypercalcemia decrease its usefulness, particularly in patients treated with calcitriol. A P binder not containing calcium (Ca) would be of value in these circumstances. In short-term studies, we showed that magnesium carbonate (MgCO 3) was well-tolerated and controlled P and Mg levels when given {{in conjunction with a}} dialysate Mg of 0. 6 mg/dl. We, therefore, performed a prospective, randomized, crossover study to evaluate if the chronic use of MgCO 3 would allow a reduction in the dose of CaCO 3 and yet achieve acceptable levels of Ca, P, and Mg. We also assessed whether the lower dose of CaCO 3 would facilitate the use of larger doses of calcitriol. The two phases were MgCO 3 plus half the usual dose of CaCO 3 and CaCO 3 alone given in the usual dose. It was found that MgCO 3 (dose, 465 ± 52 mg/day elemental Mg) allowed a decrease in the amount of <b>elemental</b> <b>Ca</b> ingested from 2. 9 ± 0. 4 to 1. 2 ± 0. 2 g/day (P < 0. 0001). The Ca, P, Mg levels were the same in the two phases. The maximum dose of i. v. calcitriol without causing hypercalcemia was 1. 5 ± 0. 3 µg/treatment during the MgCO 3 phase and 0. 8 ± 0. 3 µg/treatment during the Ca phase (P < 0. 02). If these studies are confirmed, the use of MgCO 3 and a dialysate Mg of 0. 6 mg/dl may be considered in selected patients who develop hypercalcemia during treatment with i. v. calcitriol and CaCO 3...|$|E
40|$|Cardiac {{contraction}} {{is caused}} by intracellular Ca 2 + re-lease {{as a result of}} signaling in a nanoscopic domain, the dyad, formed from the close apposition of the sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) and surface membranes. 1 Two types of Ca 2 + channels, the voltage-gated L-type Ca 2 + channels, which con-trol Ca 2 + influx elicited by action potentials, and ryanodine receptors (RyRs), which mediate Ca 2 + release from intracel-lular stores, reside on the surface and SR membranes of the dyad, respectively. Orthograde L-type Ca 2 + channel-to-RyR coupling is mediated by the Ca 2 +-induced Ca 2 + release mecha-nism, whereas retrograde coupling controls the L-type Ca 2 + channel current within the same beat. 2 In This Issue, see p 395 Editorial, see p 396 Whole-cell Ca 2 + transients during cardiac excitation–contrac-tion (EC) coupling were first seen as aequorin bioluminescence in frog cardiac muscle 3 and in canine Purkinje fibers. 4 The cre-ation of small-molecule chemical fluorescence indicators, such as fura- 2, 5 catalyzed an explosion of Ca 2 + imaging activity in single cardiac myocytes under normal conditions 6 and during Ca 2 + overload when propagating waves of elevated Ca 2 + were observed. 7 With the advent of confocal microscopy and the fast, high- contrast Ca 2 + indicator fluo- 3, the discovery of Ca 2 + sparks, 8 which is the result of single-dyad Ca 2 + signaling, has revolutionized our understanding of cardiac EC coupling and the spatiotemporal summation of ≈ 104 <b>elemental</b> <b>Ca</b> 2 + sparks results in a global Ca 2 + transient that controls cell contraction. From the viewpoint of control theory, such digital behavior is quint-essential for enabling high-speed, high-gain amplification wit...|$|E
40|$|The sarcoplasmic {{reticulum}} (SR) of {{skeletal muscle}} contains K+, Cl−, and H+ channels may facilitate charge neutralization during Ca 2 + release. Our {{recent studies have}} identified trimeric intracellular cation (TRIC) channels on SR as an essential counter-ion permeability pathway associated with rapid Ca 2 + release from intracellular stores. Skeletal muscle contains TRIC-A and TRIC-B isoforms as predominant and minor components, respectively. Here we test the physiological function of TRIC-A in skeletal muscle. Biochemical assay revealed abundant expression of TRIC-A relative to the skeletal muscle ryanodine receptor with a molar ratio of TRIC-A/ryanodine receptor ∼ 5 : 1. Electron microscopy with the tric-a−/− skeletal muscle showed Ca 2 + overload inside the SR with frequent formation of Ca 2 + deposits compared with the wild type muscle. This elevated SR Ca 2 + pool in the tric-a−/− muscle could be released by caffeine, whereas the <b>elemental</b> <b>Ca</b> 2 + release events, e. g. osmotic stress-induced Ca 2 + spark activities, were significantly reduced likely reflecting compromised counter-ion movement across the SR. Ex vivo physiological test identified the appearance of “alternan” behavior with isolated tric-a−/− skeletal muscle, i. e. transient and drastic increase in contractile force appeared within the decreasing force profile during repetitive fatigue stimulation. Inhibition of SR/endoplasmic reticulum Ca 2 + ATPase function could lead to aggravation of the stress-induced alternans in the tric-a−/− muscle. Our data suggests that absence of TRIC-A may lead to Ca 2 + overload in SR, which {{in combination with the}} reduced counter-ion movement may lead to instability of Ca 2 + movement across the SR membrane. The observed alternan behavior with the tric-a−/− muscle may reflect a skeletal muscle version of store overload-induced Ca 2 + release that has been reported in the cardiac muscle under stress conditions...|$|E
50|$|Electrons {{exist in}} energy levels (i.e. atomic orbitals) within an atom. Atomic orbitals are quantized, meaning they exist as defined values {{instead of being}} {{continuous}} (see: atomic orbitals). Electrons may move between orbitals, but in doing so they must absorb or emit energy equal to the energy difference between their atom's specific quantized orbital energy levels. In optical spectroscopy, energy absorbed to move an electron to a higher energy level (higher orbital) and/or the energy emitted as the electron moves to a lower energy level is absorbed or emitted {{in the form of}} photons (light particles). Because each element has a unique number of electrons, an atom will absorb/release energy in a pattern unique to its <b>elemental</b> identity (e.g. <b>Ca,</b> Na, etc.) and thus will absorb/emit photons in a correspondingly unique pattern. The type of atoms present in a sample, or the amount of atoms present in a sample can be deduced from measuring these changes in light wavelength and light intensity.|$|R
40|$|Pink pseudomorphs after {{plagioclase}} of up {{to about}} 5 mm in diameter were found in Shinkoji-type granitic rocks from Takakumayama, Kagoshima, Japan, and were studied by chemical and X-ray analyses. Quantitative variations in chemistry were visualized using an X-ray analytical microscope. <b>Elemental</b> image of <b>Ca</b> showed distinct zoning, probably due to abrupt change in growth conditions. There were three zoned regions in the plagioclase:(1) an unzoned region in the core,(2) a dusty zoned region in the mantle, corresponding to the pink altered mineral found in hand specimens,(3) and an oscillatory zoned region in the rim. Alteration is roughly restricted to the mantle of plagioclase. The constituent of this pink altered zone was identified as smectite with a characteristic basal spacing of 15. 3 A under air-dried and untreated conditions. These descriptive mineralogy about the pink pseudomorph of smectite after plagioclase imply the abrupt mixing of mafic and felsic magma followed by hydrothermal alteration in a water-saturated condition. ...|$|R
40|$|Numerous {{methods are}} {{available}} to forensic scientists for detecting fingerprints in which the prints are treated with various agents to enhance the visual contrast between the print and the surface. In the present work, the spatial elemental imaging capabilities of micro-X-ray fluorescence (MXRF) were used to visualize fingerprint patterns based on inorganic elements present in the prints. A major advantage of using MXRF is that the prints are left unaltered for other analyses such as DNA extraction or for archiving. Most of the fingerprints which were examined were imaged from the potassium and chlorine present in the print residue. Among the various prints studied, lower count rates were also observed in the <b>elemental</b> maps of <b>Ca,</b> Al, Na, Mg, Si, P, S, and the X-ray source scatter. A sebaceous oily fingerprint left by one subject was successfully imaged by MXRF, but sebaceous prints left by a different person were undetectable, indicating print elemental composition may be person and/or diet dependent. Prints containing substances that might be found in real world cases were also visualized including sweat, lotion, saliva, and sunscreen...|$|R
