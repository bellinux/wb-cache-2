An electronic ballast is usually quieter than a magnetic one, which produces a line-frequency hum by vibration of the transformer laminations.|$|E

LED instruments are an alternative to traditional stage lighting instruments which use halogen lamp or high-intensity <b>discharge</b> <b>lamps.</b> Like other LED instruments, they have high light output with lower power consumption. Most LED fixtures use three or more colors (usually red, green, and blue) which can be mixed to hypothetically create any color.|$|E

40|$|The {{spectrometer}} has a mass analyzer comprising an ions trap (2) {{to receive}} ions from an ionization source (1) and a detecting unit to detect ions leaving the trap based on relative load mass of ions. An ions activation unit activates {{a part of}} the trapped ions. A luminescent gas-discharge lamp (4) of the activation unit generates a light beam directed toward the trap to fragment energies of photons ranging between 8 - 41 eV or for photoionization or photodetachment of the electrons guided to the trapped ions, where the beam is electromagnetic radiation in a field of vacuum UV. The luminescent gas-discharge lamp is designed as a helium <b>discharge</b> <b>lamp,</b> a neon <b>discharge</b> <b>lamp,</b> an argon <b>discharge</b> <b>lamp</b> or a krypton <b>discharge</b> <b>lamp.</b> An independent claim is also included for a tandem mass spectrometry method...|$|R

25|$|Xenon short-arc lamps have a {{negative}} temperature coefficient like other gas <b>discharge</b> <b>lamps.</b> They are operated at low-voltage, high-current, DC and started with a high voltage pulse of 20 to 50kV. As an example, a 450 W lamp operates normally at 18 V and 25 A once started. They are also inherently unstable, prone to phenomena such as plasma oscillation and thermal runaway. Because of these characteristics, xenon short-arc lamps require a proper power supply.|$|E
25|$|Photographers {{sometimes}} use {{color temperature}} meters. These are usually designed to read only two regions along the visible spectrum (red and blue); more expensive ones read three regions (red, green, and blue). However, they are ineffective with {{sources such as}} fluorescent or <b>discharge</b> <b>lamps,</b> whose light varies in color and may be harder to correct for. Because this light is often greenish, a magenta filter may correct it. More sophisticated colorimetry tools can be used if such meters are lacking.|$|E
25|$|Other common host {{materials}} for neodymium are: YLF (yttrium lithium fluoride, 1047 and 1053nm), YVO4 (yttrium orthovanadate, 1064nm), and glass. A particular host material is chosen {{in order to}} obtain a desired combination of optical, mechanical, and thermal properties. Nd:YAG lasers and variants are pumped either by flashtubes, continuous gas <b>discharge</b> <b>lamps,</b> or near-infrared laser diodes (DPSS lasers). Prestabilized laser (PSL) types of Nd:YAG lasers have proved to be particularly useful in providing the main beams for gravitational wave interferometers such as LIGO, VIRGO, GEO600 and TAMA.|$|E

25|$|High-intensity <b>discharge</b> <b>lamps</b> (HID) produce {{light with}} an {{electric}} arc rather than a glowing filament. The high intensity of the arc comes from metallic salts that are vaporized within the arc chamber. These lamps are formally known as gas-discharge burners, and have a higher efficacy than tungsten lamps. Because of the increased amounts of light available from HID burners relative to halogen bulbs, HID headlamps producing a given beam pattern can be made smaller than halogen headlamps producing a comparable beam pattern. Alternatively, the larger size can be retained, {{in which case the}} xenon headlamp can produce a more robust beam pattern.|$|E
25|$|Most {{theatrical}} lamps are tungsten-halogen (or quartz-halogen), {{an improvement}} {{on the original}} incandescent design that used halogen gas instead of an inert gas. Fluorescent lights are rarely used other than as work lights (see below). Although they are far more efficient, they cannot be dimmed (run at less than full power) without using specialized dimmers, cannot dim to very low levels, do not produce light from a single point or easily concentrated area, and have a warm-up period during which they emit no light or do so intermittently. High-intensity <b>discharge</b> <b>lamps</b> (or HID lamps) are now common where a very bright light output is required, for example in large follow spots, HMI (hydrargyrum medium-arc iodide) floods, and modern automated fixtures. Because these types of lamps cannot be electrically dimmed, dimming is done by mechanical dousers or shutters that physically block portions of the lamp to decrease output. Some specially-designed fittings now use light-emitting diodes (LEDs) as a light source. LEDs are ideal where an intense but unfocused light source is required, such as for lighting a cyclorama.|$|E

Approximately 20kg of scandium (as Sc2O3) is used annually in the United States for high-intensity <b>discharge</b> <b>lamps.</b> [...] One type of metal-halide lamp, similar to the mercury-vapor lamp, is made from scandium iodide and sodium iodide. This lamp is a white-light source with high color rendering index that sufficiently resembles sunlight to allow good color-reproduction with TV cameras.

2500|$|Atoms emit {{and absorb}} light at {{characteristic}} energies. This produces [...] "emission lines" [...] in {{the spectrum of}} each atom. Emission can be spontaneous, as in light-emitting diodes, gas <b>discharge</b> <b>lamps</b> (such as neon lamps and neon signs, mercury-vapor lamps, etc.), and flames (light from the hot gas itself—so, for example, sodium in a gas flame emits characteristic yellow light).

40|$|Miniature(<few cm 3) vapor-cell based devices using {{optical pumping}} of alkali atoms, such as atomic clocks and magnetometers, today mostly employ vertical-cavity surface-emitting lasers as pump light sources.

Laser light is usually highly monochromatic, and is also coherent (all the light has the same phase, unlike the light from a <b>discharge</b> <b>lamp),</b> both of which are advantageous for interferometry.|$|R
2500|$|There {{are many}} non-incandescent light sources, {{such as the}} {{fluorescent}} lamp, high-intensity <b>discharge</b> <b>lamps</b> and LED lamps, which have higher luminous efficiency, and some {{have been designed to}} be retrofitted in fixtures for incandescent lights. These devices produce light by luminescence. These lamps produce discrete spectral lines and do not have the broad [...] "tail" [...] of invisible infrared emissions. By careful selection of which electron energy level transitions are used, and fluorescent coatings which modify the spectral distribution, the spectrum emitted can be tuned to mimic the appearance of incandescent sources, or other different color temperatures of white light. Due to the discrete spectral lines rather than a continuous spectrum, the light is not ideal for applications such as photography and cinematography.|$|E

2500|$|Similar {{structure}} but not fluorescent, germicidal lamps {{depend on}} the property that spectrum of 254nm kills most germs. Germicidal lamps contain no phosphor at all (making them mercury vapor gas <b>discharge</b> <b>lamps</b> rather than fluorescent) and their tubes are made of fused quartz that is transparent to the UV light emitted by the mercury discharge. The 254nm UV emitted by these tubes will kill germs and ionize oxygen to ozone. In addition it can cause eye and skin damage {{and should not be}} used or observed without eye and skin protection. Besides their uses to kill germs and create ozone, they are sometimes used by geologists to identify certain species of minerals by the color of their fluorescence. When used in this fashion, they are fitted with filters {{in the same way as}} blacklight-blue lamps are; the filter passes the short-wave UV and blocks the visible light produced by the mercury discharge. They are also used in some EPROM erasers. Germicidal lamps have designations beginning with G (meaning germicidal), rather than F, for example G30T8 for a 30-watt, [...] diameter, [...] long germicidal lamp (as opposed to an F30T8, which would be the fluorescent lamp of the same size and rating).|$|E
