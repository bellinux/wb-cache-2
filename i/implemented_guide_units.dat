40|$|Given {{that the}} South African {{government}} intends {{to improve its}} literacy rates by <b>implementing</b> <b>Guided</b> Reading in the primary schools, teachers are challenged to give good quality Guided Reading instruction.

Data were drawn from observations of teachers using Fountas & Pinnell’s Guided Reading instruction and a Guided Reading Self-Assessment Inventory. Analyses of the above-mentioned quantitative and qualitative research data indicate that South African teachers have a superficial understanding of Guided Reading. The study suggests that South African teachers struggle to <b>implement</b> <b>Guided</b> Reading in the classroom, because they do not create Guided Reading groups based on ongoing assessment and the teachers {{do not have access to}} levelled Guided Reading books. Furthermore, the new policy requirements for Guided Reading appear to fail to offer teachers a sufficient explanation of Guided Reading.

A structured development model and basic knowledge on safe and robust control loop set-ups were developed.
