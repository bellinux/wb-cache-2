5|$|The {{origins of}} Tropical Storm Debby {{were from a}} {{tropical}} wave that moved {{off the coast of}} Africa on September 4. By September 6, satellite images <b>indicated</b> <b>a</b> vigorous tropical wave with intense convection about midway between Africa and the Lesser Antilles. Encountering northwesterly vertical wind shear, convection markedly decreased and weakened on the following day, only to redevelop on September8 after the shear dropped. Post-analysis indicate that the sixth tropical depression of the season developed on September 9 at 1200UTC, about 185mi (300km) east of Barbados; however, it was not operationally classified as Tropical Depression Six until almost 24hours later. Early on September 10, satellite imagery <b>indicated</b> <b>a</b> surface circulation just north of Barbados, around which time the National Hurricane Center (NHC) initiated advisories.|$|E

5|$|A closed {{low-level}} circulation nearly {{developed on}} August 14 {{to the east}} of Key Largo, Florida, but it weakened due to the deep convection remaining to the north over the mid-level center. The mid-level storm continued westward and moved across Florida. After crossing Florida, Hurricane Hunters <b>indicated</b> <b>a</b> poorly defined circulation, but with winds exceeding tropical storm strength, and the system was designated as Tropical Storm Erika late on August 14 while located 85miles (135km) west of Fort Myers.|$|E
5|$|A midget or fleet {{submarine}} attack. Extensive searches {{immediately following}} the sinking had failed to detect any enemy submarine, and the Allies had made no attempt at claiming the enormous propaganda value of sinking a capital ship in her home anchorage; consequently, this possibility was quickly discounted. Eyewitnesses also spoke of a reddish-brown fireball, which <b>indicated</b> <b>a</b> magazine explosion; this was confirmed during exploration of the wreck by divers.|$|E
5|$|Advances in {{understanding}} genes and inheritance continued throughout the 20th century. Deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) {{was shown to}} be the molecular repository of genetic information by experiments in the 1940s to 1950s. The structure of DNA was studied by Rosalind Franklin and Maurice Wilkins using X-ray crystallography, which led James D. Watson and Francis Crick to publish {{a model of the}} double-stranded DNA molecule whose paired nucleotide bases <b>indicated</b> <b>a</b> compelling hypothesis for the mechanism of genetic replication.|$|E

5|$|After being {{selected}} in April 1945, Hiroshima was spared conventional bombing {{to serve as}} a pristine target, where the effects of a nuclear bomb on an undamaged city could be observed. While damage could be studied later, the energy yield of the untested Little Boy design could be determined only at the moment of detonation, using instruments dropped by parachute from a plane flying in formation with the one that dropped the bomb. Radio-transmitted data from these instruments <b>indicated</b> <b>a</b> yield of about 15 kilotons.|$|E
5|$|Although {{guarantees}} by {{the league}} and organization <b>indicated</b> <b>a</b> return for 2007–08, many fans in New Orleans were still skeptical of a permanent return due to {{the popularity of the}} team in Oklahoma City. Meanwhile, the Hornets opened their season in Oklahoma City with a 26-point win over the Sacramento Kings on November 1, 2005. They played their first game in Louisiana in a loss to the Phoenix Suns on December 21, 2005, and they played the first professional sports event in New Orleans after Hurricane Katrina on March 8, 2006, where they lost to the Los Angeles Lakers.|$|E
5|$|At 9:00am Central Daylight Time (CDT) on September25, the National Hurricane Center {{issued a}} {{hurricane}} watch for coastal regions of Louisiana east of Morgan City. The following day, the watch was upgraded to a hurricane warning {{when the storm}} neared landfall. A hurricane watch was also issued for areas between Morgan City and Intracoastal City. When forecasts <b>indicated</b> <b>a</b> landfall east of the state, the hurricane watch was canceled and the hurricane warning amended to a tropical storm warning. By September29, all tropical cyclone warnings and watches were discontinued.|$|E

5|$|Austrian naturalist Franz Xaver von Wulfen {{described}} the false chanterelle in 1781, noting both its resemblance with the true chanterelles and people's propensity to confuse them.

5|$|Balangoda Man is {{estimated}} to have had thick skulls, prominent supraorbital ridges, depressed noses, heavy jaws, short necks and conspicuously large teeth. Metrical and morphometric features of skeletal fragments extracted from cave sites that were occupied during different periods have <b>indicated</b> <b>a</b> rare biological affinity over a time frame of roughly 16,000 years, {{and the likelihood of}} a biological continuum to the present-day Vedda indigenous people.|$|E
5|$|Bismuth is {{also used}} in aluminium-silicon cast alloys in order to refine silicon morphology. However, it <b>indicated</b> <b>a</b> {{poisoning}} effect on modification of strontium (Sr). Some bismuth alloys, such as Bi35-Pb37-Sn25, are combined with non-sticking materials such as mica, glass and enamels because they easily wet them allowing to make joints to other parts. Addition of bismuth to caesium enhances the quantum yield of caesium cathodes. Sintering of bismuth and manganese powders at 300°C produces a permanent magnet and magnetostrictive material, which is used in ultrasonic generators and receivers working in the 10–100kHz range and in magnetic memory devices.|$|E

5|$|Ciomadul {{has been}} active for over half a million years, with the oldest {{activity}} between 1,000,000 and 750,000 years ago forming lava domes. Older estimates indicate that activity did not start before 250,000 years ago, while more recent research <b>indicated</b> <b>a</b> start of volcanism over 600,000 years ago. Volcanism at Ciomadul consisted mostly of the extrusion of lava domes, their collapse forming block-and-ash flows and subplinian and Vulcanian eruptions.|$|E
