Her {{father was}} a home builder and later {{successful}} real estate developer, while her mother worked as the bookkeeper for her father's business. [...] Early on, her parents encouraged her to read, leading to what would become her love of reading. She said, [...] "I learned [...] at home from my mother. When I was a little girl, my mother would read stories to me. I have loved books {{and going to the}} library ever since. In the summer, <b>I</b> <b>liked</b> <b>to</b> spend afternoons reading in the library. I enjoyed the Little House on the Prairie and Little Women books, and many others... Reading gives you enjoyment throughout your life." [...] Bush has also credited her second grade teacher, Charlene Gnagy, for inspiring her interest in education.|$|E

2500|$|Nina Arkadyevna Shatskaya {{was born}} in Rybinsk to the jazz musician, singer and {{conductor}} Arkady Shatsky. It was in his band Raduga (Радуга, Rainbow) that she has made her singing debut. A strict disciplinarian (who for many years was unwilling to support her ambition to become a professional singer), he proved in retrospect to be a perfect mentor and a major inspiration. [...] "I {{was kind of a}} homely girl; <b>I</b> <b>liked</b> <b>to</b> knit and sew. Besides, I was overweight. All this irritated him immensely: he was sure this way I'd turn out fat, lazy and stupid. He criticized me mercilessly but somehow managed to help me shape up with this criticism. I was eager to prove I was worthy of his praise," [...] she later remembered.|$|E
2500|$|After the Chili Peppers {{announced}} a long hiatus due to exhaustion, Flea enrolled in music {{classes at the}} University of Southern California. Beginning {{in the fall of}} 2008, he studied music theory, composition and jazz trumpet. Flea attributed his interest in attending such courses to a newfound desire to widen his appreciation and understanding of music: [...] "it's so much fun to learn this stuff because I never knew anything. I played trumpet in the school bands. I learned things <b>I</b> <b>liked</b> <b>to</b> play on my trumpet but I didn't learn why this note goes with this note and why it produces that sound. Or how to create tension in the composition [...] Knowing the structure is really fun." [...] Flea also revealed plans to release a mainly instrumental solo record, recorded in his home; guest musicians include Patti Smith and a choir from the Silverlake Conservatory.|$|E
2500|$|As {{possible}} {{evidence that}} the [...] "sexual song" [...] theory was created later, songwriter LaBostrie was quoted as saying, [...] "Little Richard didn't write none of 'Tutti Frutti'. I'll tell you exactly how I came to write that. I used to live on Galvez Street and my girlfriend and <b>I</b> <b>liked</b> <b>to</b> {{go down to the}} drug store and buy ice cream. One day we went in and saw this new flavor, Tutti Frutti. Right away I thought, 'Boy, that's a great idea for a song'. So I kept it {{in the back of my}} mind until I got to the studio that day. I also wrote the flip side of 'Tutti Frutti', 'I'm Just A Lonely Guy', and a spiritual, 'Blessed Mother', all in the same day." [...] LaBostrie was still receiving royalty checks on the average of $5,000 every three to six months from the song in the 1980s.|$|E

2500|$|Anderson {{soon became}} notorious for causing controversy, {{such as his}} infamous quote that resurfaced in {{interviews}} and articles in the following years, that he was [...] "a bisexual man who never had a homosexual experience". In February 1993, Suede went from highly touted indie band to major chart contenders with their third single, [...] "Animal Nitrate", which went into the UK top ten. The single earned them a last-minute invitation to play at that year's Brit Awards ceremony. Impressed by the band's charged sexuality, Suede's first sequence of singles and first album shocked audiences and critics alike. Suede's sexual lyrics made them a rallying point for the alienated, {{one of the few}} British bands since the Smiths who united as much as they divided. Comparisons were being made with David Bowie, though Suede sounded nothing quite like anybody else around at the time, and soon they fell upon what critics quickly deemed was a new movement. Anderson recalls, [...] "I had always been fascinated by suburbia, and <b>I</b> <b>liked</b> <b>to</b> throw these twisted references to small-town British life into songs. This was before we had that horrible term Britpop." ...|$|E
2500|$|Jacob Brackman {{introduced}} fellow producer Bert Schneider to Terrence Malick in 1975. On {{a trip to}} Cuba, Schneider and Malick began {{conversations that}} would lead to the development of Days of Heaven. Malick had tried and failed to get Dustin Hoffman or Al Pacino to star in the film. Schneider agreed to produce the film. He and Malick cast young actors Richard Gere and Brooke Adams and actor/playwright Sam Shepard for the lead roles. Paramount Pictures CEO at the time Barry Diller wanted Schneider to produce films for him and agreed to finance Days of Heaven. At the time, the studio was heading in a new direction. They were hiring new production heads who had worked in network television, and, according to former production chief Richard Sylbert, [...] " [...] product aimed at your knees". Despite the change in direction, Schneider was able to secure a deal with Paramount by guaranteeing the budget and taking personal responsibility for all overages. [...] "Those were the kind of deals <b>I</b> <b>liked</b> <b>to</b> make ... because then I could have final cut and not talk to nobody about why we're gonna use this person instead of that person", Schneider said.|$|E
2500|$|For scenes where Peyton {{is drawing}} or painting, Ward stated, [...] "...there {{would likely be}} very light lines for her to follow. Often I would give a {{finished}} version and an unfinished for this purpose. If I remember correctly, it was usually the words that I left undone." [...] Regarding the evolution of Peyton's artwork over the years, she said, [...] "I {{look back at the}} first season and think the drawings are awful! I certainly became more comfortable working in her style, but I think her style also evolved to fit mine. Does that make sense?" [...] Ward clarified, [...] "Initially I was trying to do something that just didn’t flow well from me. The drawings were too clean. A little forced and not at all the way <b>I</b> <b>liked</b> <b>to</b> work." [...] Ward said that as the show progressed, she began to put more of my own style in them, and became more comfortable and the work got better. In Season 3, the artwork was promoted through the album Friends with Benefit. In Season 6, it is seen in color instead of in black and white, to reflect the character's happiness.|$|E
