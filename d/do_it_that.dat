25|$|As {{a result}} of heavy {{fighting}} during the night of August 10–11 and during {{the day of the}} 11th, the regimental commander decided that he could not safely move the regimental trains and the artillery through the pass during the day, and accordingly he had made plans to <b>do</b> <b>it</b> <b>that</b> night. That afternoon, however, division commander William B. Kean wanted the division to move forward rapidly, and said that a battalion of the US 24th Infantry Regiment would come up and protect its right, north flank. General Kean apparently did not believe any considerable force of enemy troops was in the vicinity of Pongam-ni, despite representations to the contrary.|$|E
25|$|On February 25, Curry made 10 three-pointers {{and scored}} 51 {{points to lead}} the Warriors past the Orlando Magic 130–114. Curry topped 50 points {{for the third time}} in 2015–16, the first player to <b>do</b> <b>it</b> <b>that</b> many times since LeBron James and Dwyane Wade did so in 2008–09. Curry also surpassed Kyle Korver's mark of 127 {{straight}} games with a three-pointer. In the following game two days later, the Warriors defeated the Oklahoma City Thunder in overtime thanks to a Curry three-pointer with 0.6 seconds remaining. Curry finished with 46 points as his winning shot was his 12th three-pointer, tying the NBA single-game record (with Kobe Bryant and Donyell Marshall). He also broke his own NBA record for threes in a season, leaving the new mark at 288. On March 7, in a win over the Orlando Magic, Curry scored 41 points and became the first player in NBA history to make 300 three-pointers in a season. On April 1, Curry missed a three-pointer to tie the game against the Boston Celtics with 5.3 seconds left, as the Warriors suffered their first home defeat since January 27, 2015, losing 109–106 to the Celtics to snap an NBA-record 54-game winning streak in the regular season at Oracle Arena. On April 7, Curry scored 27 points to help the Warriors become the second team in NBA history to win 70 games in a season with a 112–101 win over the San Antonio Spurs. In the Warriors' regular season finale on April 13 against the Memphis Grizzlies, Curry achieved another shooting milestone, becoming the first player to make 400 three-pointers in a season by knocking down 10 from long range on his way to 46 points and 402 total three-pointers. With a 125–104 win over the Grizzlies, the Warriors became the first 73-win team in NBA history, surpassing the 1995–96 Chicago Bulls' 72–10 record to finish the 2015–16 season with just nine losses. With the conclusion of the regular season, Curry became the seventh player in NBA history to join the 50–40–90 club, representing the shooting percentages from the field (.504), beyond the arc (.454), and the free-throw line (.908).|$|E
500|$|A {{spinster}} {{for many}} years, Mavis resisted the advances of men, often {{too shy to}} allow dating to progress beyond {{the initial stages of}} courtship. Ian Randall comments that [...] "Many a man has been smitten with Mavis Riley, but unfortunately she always seemed to attract the drippier of the male species". In 1976 a love interest was introduced for Mavis in the form of Derek Wilton (Peter Baldwin), {{but it was more than}} a decade before the couple finally married in 1988, after simultaneously jilting each other four years earlier. Barbara Knox, who plays Rita, said, [...] "She [...] was quite a tough little character. You know, a lot of girls would have gone through with , and she stuck to her guns and said 'No, no this isn't right.' Again, dithering and weepy, but she was tough enough to <b>do</b> <b>it.</b> <b>That</b> scene [...] is reflective of the two of them. That was the essence of the friendship, they stuck up for each other and [...] great friends, all the way through." ...|$|E

500|$|Lennon stated: [...] "'Imagine', which says: 'Imagine {{that there}} was no more religion, no more country, no more politics,' is {{virtually}} the Communist manifesto, even though I'm not particularly a Communist and I do not belong to any movement." [...] He told NME: [...] "There is no real Communist state in the world; you must realize that. The Socialism I speak about ... not the way some daft Russian might do it, or the Chinese might <b>do</b> <b>it.</b> <b>That</b> might suit them. Us, we should have a nice ... British Socialism." [...] Ono described the lyrical statement of [...] "Imagine" [...] as [...] "just what John believed: that we are all one country, one world, one people." [...] Rolling Stone described its lyrics as [...] "22 lines of graceful, plain-spoken faith in the power of a world, united in purpose, to repair and change itself". Some observers have described the song has having a distinctly anti-religious viewpoint, to the point that some have embraced it as an [...] "atheist anthem".|$|E

2500|$|In April, Portadown loyalists {{threatened}} to picket St John's Catholic Church {{at the top}} of Garvaghy Road. On 29 May a [...] "junior" [...] Orange march passed near Garvaghy Road. There were clashes following the march with 13 police officers and four civilians hurt. The police fired 50 plastic bullets during the clashes. That month, DUP politician and Orangeman Paul Berry said Orangemen would not be stopped from marching the Garvaghy Road: [...] "If {{it is a matter of}} taking the law into our own hands then we are going to have to <b>do</b> <b>it.</b> <b>That</b> is a threat".|$|E

2500|$|Gwynn {{was solid}} on defense, and won five Gold Gloves in a six-year span. He stole 318 bases in his career, {{with a high}} of 56 and a {{four-year}} stretch when he averaged 40. Only four players in MLB history had 300 steals and a career batting average of at least [...]338; Gwynn {{was the only one}} of the four to have played since 1928. He was also just the 10th player to retire with over 3,000 hits and 300 steals. Gwynn in 1999 was the first National League player to reach 3,000 hits since Lou Brock in August 1979. Seven American Leaguers reached the mark after Brock and before Gwynn; all but one played at least 400 games as a designated hitter. An NL player could not be a DH until 1997, when it was allowed for the few interleague games that were played in AL parks. Just six of Gwynn's first 3,000 hits came as a designated hitter. [...] "If you want to do it in the National League, you have to play a position", he said. [...] "It's been 20 years since anybody has been able to <b>do</b> <b>it.</b> <b>That</b> tells you how tough it is to do it in this league." ...|$|E
2500|$|Despite Gravano's rise {{in status}} to consigliere, Gotti {{continued}} to use Gravano for the task of murder. In May 1988, Gravano and Robert Bisaccia, a New Jersey crime family soldier, murdered Francessco Oliverri for beating a Gambino family crew member to death. Bisaccia shot Oliverri to death while Gravano waited in a stolen get-away car. After Oliverri, John Gotti had finally got around to taking care of Wilfred [...] "Willie Boy" [...] Johnson. Johnson had been a childhood friend of Gotti's and a longtime crew member while Gotti was captain of the Bergin crew. However, at Gotti's RICO trial, Diane Giacalone, the head prosecutor, revealed that Johnson had been an informant for the FBI for years. Johnson refused to testify for the prosecution. In Underboss Gravano claims that Gotti met with Johnson during the trial and informed Johnson {{that as long as}} he never testified against Gotti, he and his family would not be harmed. Johnson would never be allowed to participate in mob matters again, however. Johnson asked Gotti to swear on his dead son, Frank Gotti, who had been killed in an accident years ago. Gotti swore. Now Gotti was having second thoughts. [...] "John discussed how it should go, using me to bounce off ideas about the best way to <b>do</b> <b>it.</b> <b>That</b> was my only involvement," [...] Gravano explained. Johnson was shot while walking to his car to go to work {{in front of his house}} in May 1988. In 1990, Gravano was involved in two murders, the first of which was Eddie Garofalo, a demolition contractor who made the mistake of running afoul of the Gambinos. On August 9, 1990, Garofalo was shot to death in front of his home as arranged by Gravano.|$|E
