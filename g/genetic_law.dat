Parents’ mediation and cultural tools in family environment were investigated through relationship between formal thinking and the two basic dimensions of family interaction. Psychological autonomy-giving vs. psychological control and emotional exchange were examined {{in the context of the}} family's cultural status.

40|$|By using {{ethnography}} as a method, I utilized Lave and Wenger’s {{community of}} practice as a major lens and Vygotsky’s <b>genetic</b> <b>law</b> of cultural development as a complementary lens, to visualize the second-language learning (SLL) {{that occurred in the}} activity of podcasting storybook writing. I organized my analysis on three intertwining themes: personal identity development, practices, and access to resources. This activity consisted of two practices: the practice of picture-based storytelling and the practice of story-podcasting. The former practice structured an initiation-response-evaluation (IRE) / initiation-response-follow up (IRF) setting, while the latter practice built a community-of-learners (CoL) setting. In this thesis, I show that the practices structured not only participation forms but also social relations. These structured social relations shaped personal identity development. The personal identity development affected access to learning resources. In addition, access to learning resources was also practice-dependent. I show what the learning resources were, and how the students created, accessed and made sense of them in the practice of picture-based storytelling...|$|E
40|$|Skinner's {{contributions}} to psychology provide a unique bridge between psychology conceptualized as a biological science and psychology conceptualized {{as a social}} science. Skinner focused on behavior as a naturally occurring biological phenomenon of interest in its own right, functionally related to surrounding events and, in particular (like phylogenesis), subject to selection by its consequences. This essentially biological orientation was further enhanced by Skinner's emphasis on the empirical foundations provided by laboratory-based experimental analyses of behavior, often with nonhuman subjects. Skinner's theoretical writings, however, also have affinity with the traditions of constructionist social science. The verbal behavior of humans {{is said to be}} subject, like other behavior, to functional analyses in terms of its environment, in this case its social context. Verbal behavior in turn makes it possible for us to relate to private events, a process that ultimately allows for the development of consciousness, which is thus said to be a social product. Such ideas make contact with aspects of G. H. Mead's social behaviorism and, perhaps of more contemporary impact in psychology, L. Vygotsky's general <b>genetic</b> <b>law</b> of cultural development. Failure to articulate both the biological and the social science aspects of Skinner's theoretical approach to psychology does a disservice to his unique contribution to a discipline that remains fragmented between two intellectual traditions...|$|E

40|$|In {{this study}} we {{examined}} the transition from other to self-regulation by drawing on Vygotsky's general <b>genetic</b> <b>law</b> of cultural development and on Bakhtin's notion of genre appropriation. We attempted to replicate previous sociocultural research findings {{on the development of}} self-regulation with older students and a formal academic multiple-variant task. We aimed at extending this body of research by employing both qualitative and quantitative discourse analytic approaches. Ten secondary school students were individually tutored by their geography teacher in how to solve correlational problems. Every student worked with the teacher for about three hours and solved a minimum of seven correlational problems. All tutorial sessions were videotaped and subsequently transcribed. A coding scheme was developed and all instructional discourse was segmented and coded by two independent judges. On the whole, quantitative discourse analysis supported the notion of a transition from other to self-regulation in the area of correlational reasoning. Additionally, it was found that teacher regulation was differentiated within tasks and that certain properties of discourse influence how explicit student self-regulation is. Qualitative discourse analysis supported the notion of the assimilation of the voice of the teacher into the voice of the student. A three dimensional conception of learning is proposed and the implications of the study are discussed. ...|$|E

In addition, {{during the course of}} physiochemical properties changes of higher AC rice cultivars determined by Wxª or Wx in allele, accompanied by the increasing of AC, gel consistency and head milled rice recovery would be decreased in combination with the rising of chalky traits, all of which resulted in substantial fluctuations on quality traits (p < 0. 01).

40|$|In this paper, we {{analyze the}} conception, {{objectives}} and methodology of the 'Philosophy for Children', a programme aimed at fostering critical thinking in children aged five to eighteen. The analysis {{is based on}} the key concepts and principles of Vygotsky's developmental theory. We believe that discussing the manner in which these concepts and principles are embodied in one successful and influential thinking skills programme could enhance the concept of the zone of proximal development, as well as our understanding of the processes through which cognitive competencies are co-constructed. The practical relevance of the analysis refers to a controversial issue of whether higher-order cognitive skills can be fostered at a young age. The analysis reveals that Lipman has creatively applied Vygotsky's idea of the formative role of spontaneous and scientific concepts interaction, thus focusing on the metacognitive development. Consequently, the methodological procedures are language-based, using the narrative, dialogical and rational forms of discourse as mediation tools for developing the skills of logical reasoning and critical thinking. Philosophical novels, as an innovative educational genre, exemplify Lipman's contribution to enriching the concept of direct cultural interaction, which has generally been less studied within the socio-cultural approach. The analysis of gradual transformation of group discussion, from monological and mostly anegdotical, through genuine dialogical exchanges, to mastering the procedures and skills of critical dialogue, {{is one of the most}} plausible accounts of Vygotsky's <b>genetic</b> <b>law.</b> The specific role of the teacher, who indirectly guides the discussion through the use of Socratic questioning, expands the concept of finely tuned support and the strategies for creating the zone of proximal development in educational context...|$|E

50|$|One 2000s-era {{conception}} of cultural ecology is {{as a general}} theory that regards ecology as a paradigm {{not only for the}} natural and human sciences, but for cultural studies as well. In his Die Ökologie des Wissens (The Ecology of Knowledge), Peter Finke explains that this theory brings together the various cultures of knowledge that have evolved in history, and that have been separated into more and more specialized disciplines and subdisciplines in the evolution of modern science (Finke 2005). In this view, cultural ecology considers the sphere of human culture not as separate from but as interdependent with and transfused by ecological processes and natural energy cycles. At the same time, it recognizes the relative independence and self-reflexive dynamics of cultural processes. As the dependency of culture on nature, and the ineradicable presence of nature in culture, are gaining interdisciplinary attention, the difference between cultural evolution and natural evolution is increasingly acknowledged by cultural ecologists. Rather than <b>genetic</b> <b>laws,</b> information and communication have become major driving forces of cultural evolution (see Finke 2005, 2006). Thus, causal deterministic laws do not apply to culture in a strict sense, but there are nevertheless productive analogies that can be drawn between ecological and cultural processes.|$|R

Based on the published sequences of MT genes from Agaricus bisporus, Garnoderma lucidum, Taiwanofungus camphoratus and Paxillus involutus as a type of the edible or medical mushroom in NCBI database, their molecular structures, physiological functions and evolutionary relationship were analyzed using the bioinformatics methods. Results showed that AbMT, GlMT, TcMT and PiMT genes contained complete open reading frame (ORF) and their theoretical points of the last three encoding proteins were higher than 7. 0. AbMT, GlMT, TcMT and PiMT were relatively rich in random coil and extended strand, but transmembrane helices and signal peptides were not found. 4 MTs were mainly localized in cell nucleus (over 60 %) and their cellular functions might have some relation to central intermediary metabolism. Multiple sequence alignment indicated relatively high identity (more than 52 %) and short genetic distances (lower than 0. 900) among 4 MT nucleotide sequences. Abundant genetic diversity and strong codon bias were found based on the halotype diversity, average number of nucleotide differences, nucleotide diversity, effective number of codons, codon bias index and scaled chisquare. Simultaneously, we deduced that 4 MT genes during molecular evolution were under positive selection.
