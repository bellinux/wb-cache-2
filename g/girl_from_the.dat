40|$|Thesis titled Understanding {{and expressing}} time and causal {{relationships}} between two {{events in the}} pre-school period consists of a short theoretical part, in which I presented notion of time and causal relationship, and examples of their use in the pre-school period, and empirical part, which consists of data, obtained with help of research directly with children, as well as via survey by kindergarten teachers. I wanted to explore understanding and expressing of both of the relationships, between children aged 3 and 5 years, the differences based on age, gender and place of the kindergarten they are attending. Besides the research directly with the children, with whom I was trying to check child's recognition and expression of time and causal relationships between two events – by using ten pairs of pictures that I have shown them, my empirical part also consisted a survey with kindergarten teachers <b>from</b> <b>the</b> city and country kindergarten. I compared the results according {{to the place where}} the respondents were coming <b>from.</b> <b>The</b> results of the research with children have shown that their age affects the understanding and expression of both relationships. In most cases with the time ratio, 5 – 5, 5 years old boys <b>from</b> <b>the</b> city kindergarten were the best, followed by the 5 – 5, 5 years old boys <b>from</b> <b>the</b> rural kindergarten, then <b>girls</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> city and <b>girls</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> rural kindergarten. In a group of younger children, the best results were shown by <b>girls</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> rural kindergarten, followed by <b>girls</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> city, <b>the</b> boys <b>from</b> city and then <b>the</b> boys <b>from</b> <b>the</b> rural kindergarten. In causal relationship, the results were even better. Five-year-olds <b>from</b> <b>the</b> city kindergarten had the best results again, followed by <b>the</b> boys and <b>girls</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> rural kindergarten and then <b>the</b> <b>girls</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> city. In a group of younger children, the best results in causal relationship were shown by <b>the</b> <b>girls</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> rural, followed by <b>the</b> <b>girls</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> city, <b>the</b> boys <b>from</b> <b>the</b> city and then <b>the</b> boys <b>from</b> <b>the</b> rural kindergarten. Analysis of survey with kindergarten teachers had shown that teachers in the city and in the countryside, have the same opinion on the research relationships, and also quite similar ways of representing time and causal relationship to the children in the nursery. ...|$|R
