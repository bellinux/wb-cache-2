40|$|International audienceMediator {{is a large}} multiprotein complex conserved in all eukaryotes, {{which has}} a crucial coregulator {{function}} in transcription by RNA polymerase II (Pol II). However, the molecular mechanisms of its action in vivo remain to be understood. Med 17 is an essential and central component of the Mediator head module. In this work, we utilised our large collection of conditional temperature-sensitive med 17 mutants to investigate Mediator's role in coordinating preinitiation complex (PIC) formation in vivo at the genome level after a transfer to a non-permissive temperature for 45 minutes. The effect of a yeast mutation proposed to be equivalent to the human Med 17 -L 371 P responsible for <b>infantile</b> cerebral <b>atrophy</b> was also analyzed. The ChIP-seq results demonstrate that med 17 mutations differentially affected the global presence of several PIC components including Mediator, TBP, TFIIH modules and Pol II.

The fatal childhood disorder is associated with loss of anterior horn cells and infantile death. Clinical features include hypotonia, areflexia, and multiple congenital contractures. In a large-scale mutation analysis, screening of six XL-SMA families provided results indicating two novel missense mutations in two families and a novel synonymous C->T substitution in another three familiesfootnote. All of these detected mutations were located in exon 15 of the UBE1 gene (the gene encoding ubiquitin-activating enzyme) and were observed to segregate with disease in the families. In brevity, UBE1 missense {{may lead to a}} disturbed complex building with gigaxonin, a protein involved in axonal structure and neuronal maintenance. This can lead to impaired degradation of microtubule-associated protein 1B (MAP1B), resulting in the build-up of MAP1B protein, which may enhance neuronal cell death.

Using strict criteria, electromyography accurately predicted the final diagno-sis in 65 % of infants with spinal muscular atrophy and {{was consistent with the}} diagnosis in another 25 %.

To identify the XL-SMA disease gene, we performed large-scale mutation analysis in genes located between markers DXS 8080 and DXS 7132 (Xp 11. 3 âXq 11. 1). This resulted in detection of three rare novel variants in exon 15 of UBE 1 that segregate with disease: two missense mutations (c. 1617 GâT, p. Met 539 Ile; c. 1639 AâG, p. Ser 547 Gly) present each in one XL-SMA family, and one synonymous CâT substitution (c. 1731 CâT, p. Asn 577 Asn) identified in another three unrelated families. Absence of the missense mutations was demonstrated for 3550 and {{absence of the}} synonymous mutation was shown in 7914 control X chromosomes; therefore, these results yielded statistical significant evidence for the association of the synonymous substitution and the two missense mutations with XL-SMA (p = 2. 416 Ã 10 â 10, p = 0. 001815). We also demonstrated that the synonymous CâT substitution leads to significant reduction of UBE 1 expression and alters the methylation pattern of exon 15, implying a plausible role of this DNA element in developmental UBE 1 expression in humans.

40|$|Neurodegenerative {{diseases}} cause tremendous {{suffering for}} those afflicted and their families. Many of these diseases involve accumulation of mis-folded or aggregated proteins thought {{to play a}} causal role in disease pathology. Ubiquitinated proteins are often found in these protein aggregates, and the aggregates themselves {{have been shown to}} inhibit the activity of the proteasome. These and other alterations in the Ubiquitin Pathway observed in neurodegenerative diseases have led {{to the question of whether}} impairment of the Ubiquitin Pathway on its own can increase mortality or if ongoing neurodegeneration alters Ubiquitin Pathway function as a side-effect. To address the role of the Ubiquitin Pathway in vivo, we studied loss-of-function mutations in the Drosophila Ubiquitin Activating Enzyme, Uba 1 or E 1, the most upstream enzyme in the Ubiquitin Pathway. Loss of only one functional copy of E 1 caused a significant reduction in adult lifespan. Rare homozygous hypomorphic E 1 mutants reached adulthood. These mutants exhibited further reduced lifespan and showed inappropriate Ras activation in the brain. Removing just one functional copy of Ras restored the lifespan of heterozygous E 1 mutants to that of wild-type flies and increased the survival of homozygous E 1 mutants. E 1 homozygous mutants also showed severe motor impairment. Our findings suggest that processes that impair the Ubiquitin Pathway are sufficient to cause early mortality. Reduced lifespan and motor impairment are seen in the human disease X-linked <b>Infantile</b> Spinal Muscular <b>Atrophy,</b> which is associated with mutation in human E 1 warranting further analysis of these mutants as a potential animal model for study of this disease...|$|R
40|$|<b>Infantile</b> spinal muscular <b>atrophy</b> (SMA) {{is caused}} by {{mutations}} in the survival motor neuron (SMN) 1 gene. We investigated the role of human (h) SMN protein on cell death in PC 12 and Rat- 1 cells. hSMN prolonged cell survival in PC 12 cells deprived of trophic support and in Rat- 1 cells induced to die by activation of the protooncogene c-Myc, to similar magnitude as Bcl- 2 or IAP- 2. While hSMN was ineffective in inhibiting apoptosis induced by ultraviolet light (UV) or etoposide treatment in proliferating PC 12 or Rat- 1 cells, a protective effect was observed in terminally NGF/dBcAMP-differentiated PC 12 cells. hSMN inhibited the onset of apoptosis in NGF/dBcAMP-deprived or UV-treated co-differentiated PC 12 cells by preventing cytochrome c release and caspase- 3 activation, indicating that its effects are through suppression of the mitochondrial apoptotic pathway. Expressing hSMN deleted for exon 7 (D 7) or for exons 6 and 7 (D 6 / 7), or with the SMA point mutant Y 272 C, resulted in loss of survival function. Moreover, these mutants also exhibited pro-apoptotic effects in Rat- 1 cells. The localization pattern of full-length hSMN in PC 12 and Rat- 1 cells {{was similar to that}} of endogenous SMN: granular labelling in the cytoplasm and discrete fluorescence spots in the nucleus, some of which co-localized with p 80 coilin, the characteristic marker of Cajal bodies.

40|$|This {{study was}} {{conducted}} in a group of children suffering from spinal muscular atrophy, or Werdnig-Hoffmann dis-ease. 1 â 3 This progressive <b>infantile</b> spinal muscular <b>atrophy</b> is a genetically determined degenerative condition charac-terized by a deletion of exons 7 and 8 of the SMN gene. This autosomal recessive disorder is characterized by a pro-gressive loss of the motoneurons of the anterior horn cells in the spinal cord and in the cranial nerve motor nuclei of the brain stem. The main clinical features consist of profound weakness of the proximal and intercostal muscles and occa-sionally of marked bulbar dysfunction. Several subgroups have been distinguished according to the age of onset, clin-ical severity, and other features. Classically, the acute form of spinal muscular atrophy (type I) is characterized by severe generalized muscle weakness and hypotonia at birth or within the first 6 months. Death from respiratory failure usually occurs within the first 2 years. In the intermediate form (type II), the children are able to sit, although they can-not stand or walk unaided and they live longer. Many authors have studied motor nerve conduction in patients with spinal muscular atrophy and have shown either normal or abnormal conduction. 4 â 8 However, very few studies have analyzed multimodality evoked poten-tials. In the study reported here, visual evoked potentials, brainstem evoked potentials, and somatosensory evoked potentials were obtained on patients with two types of spinal muscular atrophy, types I and II. Evoked potentials were initially recorded in younger children with spinal mus-cular atrophy type I who had major speaking difficulties because of tracheostomy.

40|$|This study {{examines}} the cytokine {{ciliary neurotrophic factor}} as a potential modifier of the clinical course of spinal muscular atrophy. The autosomal recessive <b>infantile</b> spinal muscular <b>atrophy</b> (SMA) is a common neuromuscular disorder. It {{is caused by a}} homozygous mutation of the SMN 1 gene leading to a lack of SMN protein. This lack of protein results in a retrograde denervation of the neuromuscular junction, axonal degeneration and finally the loss of motor neurons in the spinal cord. Clinically, the course of SMA is highly variable. Based on disease onset and achieved motor milestones patients suffering from SMA can be divided into types 1 - 3. Type 1 is characterized by an early start within the first months of life. Patients die within a few months, most likely due to respiratory failure. In type 2 first symptoms occur no later than 18 months of age. These patients never reach the ability to walk. Finally, type 3 is characterized by a late onset, moderate disabilities and normal life expectancy. The most potential factor influencing the clinical course of SMA is a centromeric copy of the SMN gene, which is called SMN 2. It partly compensates the lack of SMN protein. To stop the disease morphologically and functionally, it is necessary to re-innervate the denervated muscle fibers by terminal sprouting of adjacent axonsÂ´ ends. The cytokine ciliary neurotrophic factor (CNTF) is capable of regulating this process. A potential influence on the course of SMA has therefore been discussed particularly due to results from genetic mouse model studies. In humans a SNP in the CNTF gene occurs in 1 - 3 % of the population resulting in a homozygous null mutation. This allows a comparison of disease course in SMA patients with and without CNTF protein to evaluate the potential influence of CNTF. Some previous studies have shown a significantly earlier onset of the disease in patients suffering from multiple sclerosis and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis carrying a CNTF null mutation. In this study, a large cohort of human SMA patients was tested for the first time. 276 patients diagnosed with SMA through molecular genetic analysis were included. The number of copies of the SMN 2 gene was determined by multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification (MLPA). The CNTF genotyping was performed using pyrosequencing. In addition, data concerning specific clinical features was collected. In our study 39, 5 % of the patients show a heterozygous CNTF genotype, 59 % a homozygous wild-type and 1, 5 % showed a homozygous mutation. A total of four patients carry the CNTF null mutation. They belong to types SMA 1 and SMA 2. An excess of heterozygotes in the study group is striking. It results in a significant deviation of genotype distribution from Hardy-WeinbergÂ´s equilibrium. This occurred in earlier studies as well. However, an association of certain CNTF genotypes and SMA types could not be detected. Concerning the parameter disease onset, the Kaplan-Meier analysis shows significant differences between the SMA types and the number of SMN 2 copies. In contrast, there are no significant results regarding the CNTF genotypes. Furthermore, the number of SMN 2 copies has also a significant influence on the survival of SMA patients. The CNTF genotype shows no such influence. For type 1 and 3 no significant influence of CNTF on the expression of clinical features was detected. Among type 2 patients the features tongue fibrillation and strength in the torso show strikingly small but not significant p-values. Due to the exploratory character of the study correction for multiple testing was applied. Overall, {{the results of this study}} do not indicate a strong influence of CNTF on the clinical course of SMA. Following this exploratory study, further studies should be designed to specifically concentrate on promising features. This is necessary to finally decide, if the CNTF genotype should be considered in an establishment of a patientÂ´s prognosis and further treatment trials...|$|R
40|$|The present work {{describes}} the disease course of 66 patients with <b>infantile</b> spinal muscular <b>atrophy</b> (SMA) type I. We examined several clinical and molecular genetic {{factors that may}} modify the disease course and affect {{the survival of the}} patients. This was done with the intention to define a historical control group for future clinical trials. Those patients were eligible who were diagnosed between 2000 and 2005 and whose diagnosis of SMA had been confirmed genetically in one of the participating laboratories (Aachen, Cologne, WÃ¼rzburg) within six months of age. All patients had a homozygous deletion of the SMN 1 gene. Recruitment was through pediatric facilities. Of the 174 patients who met the inclusion criteria, parents of 66 patients agreed to participate, completed questionnaires, and consented to the review of medical reports and further DNA studies. Using dosimetric methods (MLPA and real-time PCR), the SMN 2 copy number of the patients was determined. Disease endpoint was defined by age at death or the age when either tracheostomy or permanent (> 14 days) ventilation was performed. Kaplan-Meier survival analysis was calculated with SPSS version 13 for windows, the statistical comparison of survival course was performed with the log rank or Mantel-Haenszel test if applicable. A statistical analysis of the mean/median was performed using the Man-Whitney-U-test, and to identify correlations two-sided tests with Pearson correlation coefficient were applied. A p value of < 0. 05 was regarded as significant. Age at onset was within 4. 5 months in all patients (median / mean 1. 2 / 1. 4 months). The majority (86. 4 %) of patients showed two SMN 2 copies. In four patients (6. 1 %), only a single copy of SMN 2 was seen. Five patients (7. 6 %) had three SMN 2 copies. The clinical course oft the four unrelated single copy patients was most severe with prenatal onset of muscle weakness, congenital contractures and respiratory distress from birth. Three patients with a single SMN 2 gene copy had congenital heart defects (atrial or ventricular septal defects) that were not explained by intrauterine muscle weakness, respiratory insufficiency at birth or other causes, suggesting a causal link between severe SMN deficiency and impaired cardiogenesis. Overall, the disease course depended on the SMN 2 copy number. We investigated the effects of pneumonia, supportive treatment such as tube feeding or medication, the achievement of motor milestones, and of gender on disease progression. We found no significant increase or decrease of survival by the individual factors. Only the age at onset and the SMN 2 copy number had an impact on survival. Still, the clinical course of children with two SMN 2 copy numbers can be very different, for which other modifying factors are to blame. Ten children in this study received valproic acid (VPA), no positive effect could be proved. We also described the clinical course of eight patients who received mechanical ventilatory support for more than month before their death. Survival analysis in SMA I differed in previous studies depending on the in- and exclusion criteria used and were difficult to compare with or study or with each other. Cumulative death statistics according to age at onset groups in previous studies were similar to ours. We presented several possible historical control groups (two SMN 2 copies, both with and without VPA treatment, with no respiratory problems at birth), which could be used for future clinical trials. In summary, this work represents an important further step towards the understanding of spinal muscular atrophy and possible treatment. In our study, we tried to reduce to a minimum any potential selection of cases that might be caused by either clinical or geographical factors. Unfortunately, the response rate was only 38 %.
