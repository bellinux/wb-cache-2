5|$|The {{predicted}} {{effects of}} the FairTax {{are a source of}} disagreement among economists and other analysts. According to Money magazine, while many economists and tax experts support the idea of a consumption tax, many of them view the FairTax proposal as having serious problems with evasion and revenue neutrality. Some economists argue that a consumption tax (the FairTax is one such tax) would {{have a positive effect on}} economic growth, incentives for international business to locate in the U.S., and increased U.S. <b>international</b> <b>competitiveness</b> (border tax adjustment in global trade). The FairTax would be tax-free on mortgage interest (up to a basic interest rate) and donations, but some lawmakers have concerns about losing tax incentives on home ownership and charitable contributions. There is also concern about the effect on the income tax industry and the difficulty of repealing the Sixteenth Amendment (to prevent Congress from re-introducing an income tax).|$|E

40|$|How can {{small and}} {{medium-sized}} enterprises (SMEs) compete over time within international networks? This thesis takes a stance in that business network relationships are essential for international SMEs as such networks can provide knowledge and learning opportunities. <b>International</b> network <b>competitiveness</b> is, in this thesis, introduced as a concept that captures SMEs long term performance, resulting from the firms being competitive within international business networks. This thesis thereafter proposes that an analytical framework of <b>International</b> network <b>competitiveness,</b> can promote the study of SMEs' long term performance within international networks. The thesis subsequently acknowledges that SMEs frequently need to develop a combination of technical- and foregin market knowledge so as to stay competitive within international networks. In fact, technical knowledge development is central for an increasingly wider selection of firms, not only high tech firms. By investigating the function of co-innovation (innovation together with network partners), for the proposed components of <b>international</b> network <b>competitiveness,</b> the thesis demonstrate that innovation has intriguing and central functions for the <b>international</b> network <b>competitiveness</b> of SMEs.

An earlier study on this issue, Hanif and Jafri (2008), has some empirical limitations as it is based on Engle-Granger (1987) two steps procedure while dealing with multiple variables regressions. In this study we have used ARDL model by Pesaran, Shin and Smith (1999). We have also applied Johansen test for cointegration and checked the robustness of results established by the ARDL model. We have estimated the cointegration vector using Stock and Watson (1993) dynamic OLS method. We find a stable long run positive relationship between <b>international</b> trade <b>competitiveness</b> of Pakistan and its financial sector development.

25|$|In {{the early}} 1990s the country's economy was hit hard when real GDP per capita {{declined}} by 5.1% per year between 1989 and 1992 {{partly due to}} the 1990 oil price spike. Barbados entered into an agreement with the International Monetary Fund financial assistance after a long and hard period of negotiations between the IMF, the government of Barbados, labour unions and employers. This led to a protocol on wages and prices in 1993. This helped prevent an inflationary spiral and restored the island's <b>international</b> <b>competitiveness</b> thereby leading to a period of long term economic growth of 2.7% between 1993 and 2000.|$|E

25|$|International {{comparisons}} {{using the}} number of patents granted by the US Patent and Trademarks Office (USPTO) provide an indirect measure {{of the extent to}} which an economy may be seeking <b>international</b> <b>competitiveness</b> on the basis of technology-driven innovation. Brazil was granted 108 patents by the USPTO between 2004 and 2008 and 189 between 2009 and 2013. Although Brazil has registered strong growth in this field, compared to other emerging economies, it seems to be relatively less focused on international patenting than on publications. Between 2000 and 2013, it counted 10 patents per ten million inhabitants from USPTO, less than Argentina (14), China, India (12) or South Africa (25) and only slightly more than Mexico (9).|$|E

25|$|Brazil generates nearly three-quarters (73%) of its {{electricity}} from hydropower. This contribution was {{as high as}} four-fifths in 2010 but the share of hydropower has been eroded {{by a combination of}} declining rainfall and ageing hydroelectric plants, many of which date back to the 1960s and 1970s. Intensive use of thermoelectric power plants operating on fossil fuels has compensated for much of the loss, since the share of new sources of renewable energy, such as solar and wind, in the energy mix remains small. Moreover, although Brazil has made great strides in the use of bioethanol in transportation, there has been little focus on research and innovation in energy generation, be it in terms of developing new sources of energy or improving energy efficiency. In light of the foregoing, there is little reason to expect public investment in energy R to rebound to the levels seen {{at the turn of the}} century that would rebuild Brazil’s <b>international</b> <b>competitiveness</b> in this field.|$|E
25|$|The {{policy of}} {{non-alignment}} during the Cold War meant that Nehru received financial and technical support from both power blocs in building India's industrial base from scratch. Steel mill complexes were built at Bokaro and Rourkela with {{assistance from the}} Soviet Union and West Germany. There was substantial industrial development. Industry grew 7.0 percent annually between 1950 and 1965 – almost trebling industrial output and making India the world's seventh largest industrial country. Nehru's critics, however, contended that India's import substitution industrialisation, which was continued long after the Nehru era, weakened the <b>international</b> <b>competitiveness</b> of its manufacturing industries. India's share of world trade fell from 1.4 per cent in 1951–1960 to 0.5 per cent over 1981–1990. On the other hand, India's export performance is argued to have actually showed sustained improvement over the period. The volume of exports went up {{at an annual rate}} of 2.9 per cent in 1951–1960 to 7.6 per cent in 1971–1980.|$|E
25|$|For example, if Mauritius imports {{more than}} it exports, then {{this means that the}} supply of rupees is likely to exceed the demand in the foreign exchanging market, ceteris paribus. One can thus infer that the Mauritius rupee would be under {{pressure}} to depreciate against other currencies. On the other hand, if Mauritius exports {{more than it}} imports, then the rupee would be likely to appreciate. Second, a country's balance-of-payment data may signal its potential as a business partner {{for the rest of the}} world. If a country is grappling with a major balance-of-payment difficulty, it may not be able to expand imports from the outside world. Instead, the country may be tempted to impose measures to restrict imports and discourage capital outflows in order to improve the balance-of-payment situation. On the other hand, a country experiencing a significant balance-of payment surplus would be more likely to expand imports, offering marketing opportunities for foreign enterprises, and less likely to impose foreign exchange restrictions. Third, balance-of-payments data can be used to evaluate the performance of the country in international economic competition. Suppose a country is experiencing trade deficits year after year. This trade data may then signal that the country's domestic industries lack <b>international</b> <b>competitiveness.</b> To interpret balance-of-payments data properly, it is necessary to understand how the balance of payments account is constructed.|$|E

[...] Oram considered that the amendments to the NZ ETS destroyed its effectiveness. His examples were: removing limits on emissions by adopting intensity-based allocation of free carbon credits, slavishly following climate-laggard Australia, minimising the price incentive by extending the free allocation of credits for 75 years, muting the price signal with a $NZ25 per tonne of carbon cap, forcing forestry holders of credits to sell them overseas because of the $NZ25 per tonne cap, cancelling complementary measures such as fuel efficiency standards, giving in to special pleading via subsidies, and creating uncertainty for business.|$|E
