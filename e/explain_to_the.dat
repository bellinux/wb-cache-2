5|$|The king sent St-Calais on {{diplomatic}} {{missions to}} the French royal court and to Rome. After the king's imprisonment of Odo of Bayeux, Pope Gregory VII complained to him. The pope was {{also concerned about}} the king's refusal to allow the delivery of papal letters to the English bishops unless royal permission was secured. To placate the pope, the king dispatched St-Calais to Rome, possibly with Lanfranc, to <b>explain</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> pope the reasons for imprisoning Odo. St-Calais also served as a commissioner in the south-western part of England for the Domesday Book, which aimed to survey the whole of England and record who owned the lands. Some historians, including David Bates, have argued that St-Calais was {{the driving force behind the}} organization of the entire Domesday survey, although other candidates have been put forward, including Samson, Bishop of Worcester, before he became bishop. Pierre Chaplais, who argues for St-Calais being the main organizer of the survey, argues the bishop's exile in 1088 interrupted work on the Little Domesday Book, a subproject of the survey which was left uncompleted.|$|E

At Giles' apartment his visiting girlfriend, Olivia, is frightened by one of The Gentlemen outside Giles' window. The following morning in a campus classroom, Giles uses a series of overhead transparencies to <b>explain</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> others that The Gentlemen steal the townspeople's voices so no one can scream as they gather the hearts they need, and that folklore indicates that they have been vanquished before when a princess screamed: the only thing that will kill them is a live human voice.|$|E

25|$|In Buenos Aires and Salta {{electronic}} voting machines {{were used to}} print out a single unified ballot, with voters able to select different candidates and parties on a touch screen.

25|$|To {{determine}} the patient's suitability for undergoing a rhinoplasty procedure, the surgeon clinically evaluates {{him or her}} with a complete medical history (anamnesis) to determine his or her physical and psychological health. The prospective patient must <b>explain</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> physician–surgeon the functional and aesthetic nasal problems {{that he or she}} suffers. The surgeon asks about the ailments' symptoms and their duration, past surgical interventions, allergies, drugs use and drugs abuse (prescription and commercial medications), and a general medical history. Furthermore, additional to physical suitability is psychological suitability—the patient's psychological motive for undergoing nose surgery is critical to the surgeon's pre-operative evaluation of the patient. In the case of men, the surgeon must identify prospective patients presenting the mental traits denoted by the psychiatric acronym SIMON (single, immature, male, over-expectant, and narcissistic), which might indicate a man over-valuing the outcome of a rhinoplasty.|$|E
