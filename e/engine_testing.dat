25|$|The XFH was {{designed}} in 1927 by Charles Hall. It was a single-bay biplane with N-struts for the fabric-covered wings. Its fuselage {{was made of}} steel tubing covered with a watertight aluminum skin, enabling it to float if ditched in the ocean. Also for ditching on water or on land, the landing gear could be jettisoned. Power was provided by a Pratt & Whitney Wasp radial <b>engine.</b> <b>Testing</b> in June 1929 showed poor handling characteristics and performance. During one test flight, the upper wing separated from the aircraft. After repairs, the XFH made test flights from an aircraft carrier. Designated XFH by the Bureau of Aeronautics, it was purchased not for active service, but to study new metal construction techniques.|$|E

Some of the tests were performed from a purpose-built platform at the aerodrome, which functioned to deflect the hot exhaust gases away from the aircraft during early hovering trials while more powerful versions of the engine were developed.

500|$|In 1900, {{almost all}} trains from London to Wales {{travelled}} via Bath and Bristol, with some still routed via [...] However, the final [...] to Bristol were relatively slow and congested, so a new route was built further north, the GWR's Badminton Line, {{now part of}} the South Wales Main Line, running from [...] to a junction just south of Patchway. The new line opened in 1903, and allowed faster services to Wales. There was a new triangular junction between Patchway and Filton, with the new line coming in from the east. As part of the work, the station signal box was closed, replaced by a larger one closer to the junction on 19 October 1902. The signal box would later become one of only a few to be double glazed, due to the noise from jet <b>engine</b> <b>testing</b> from the Bristol Siddeley Aero-Engines factory (now the Rolls Royce factory) opposite the box.

500|$|The Curtis-Wright reactor was {{dismantled}} and its fuel {{returned to}} the AEC. Martin Company, which soon became Martin Marietta, leased the hot cells, intending to use them {{in the manufacture of}} small radioisotope thermoelectric generators. Curtiss-Wright warned Penn State [...] "that the radiation involved in Martin's operations would be 'extremely high' and of a type that posed a particular risk to human health", but Curtiss-Wright itself had left both solid and liquid radioactive waste in the facility. Some of the Curtiss-Wright waste was contaminated with toxic beryllium oxide. Penn State had acquired the reactor license, and with it came legal responsibility for the nuclear waste on the site; its plan with the AEC called for the release of 90percent of the liquid radioactive waste into the environment and the burial of most radioactive solids on site. Items coated with beryllium oxide dust [...] "were covered in plastic and buried out in the woods", where some were unearthed by black bears and white-tailed deer. Once jet <b>engine</b> <b>testing</b> stopped, the bunkers at the test cells were used [...] "to store hazardous and explosive material".|$|E
500|$|The name, [...] "Britannia" [...] {{was chosen}} in April 1950 with Britannia 101 the {{designation}} for first two prototypes {{powered by the}} early series Proteus 625, the follow-up from the 600 series engine that had successfully completed its type trials. The first prototype, registered G-ALBO, with Bristol Chief Test Pilot A.J. [...] "Bill" [...] Pegg at the controls, flew {{for the first time}} on 16 August 1952 at Filton Aerodrome. The maiden flight was eventful as the over-sensitive flying controls led to a wild pitching before Pegg restored control. During the landing approach, smoke filled the cockpit and the main undercarriage bogie was stuck in its cycle, only fully deploying seconds before landing. The [...] "snags" [...] proved to be minor and by September, the prototype was cleared to perform at the 1952 SBAC Display at Farnborough where spectators commented on the [...] "quietness" [...] of the giant airliner. In November 1952, Popular Science reported that by 1954 BOAC would have 25 of these aircraft on routes such as London-to-Tokyo over the Arctic and North Pole. However, in 1953 and 1954, three de Havilland Comets crashed without explanation, and the Air Ministry demanded the Britannia undergo lengthy tests. Further delays were attributed to teething problems with the engine resulting in the loss in December 1953 of the second prototype, G-ALRX, caused by a failed reduction gear that led to an engine fire and the aircraft landing on the mudflats of the Severn Estuary. Resolving easily avoidable inlet icing issues – by selecting a slightly different cruising height than that specified – which were exaggerated by BOAC destroying the Britannia's sales prospects and delaying the Britannia's introduction by two years, also took time. The first prototype G-ALBO was subsequently modified to more closely approximate a production standard but was retained by the company to undergo <b>engine</b> <b>testing</b> and development.|$|E
