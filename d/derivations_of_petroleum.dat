Researched and forecasted scenarios <b>of</b> <b>petroleum</b> consumption in the Ukraine. The problem of efficient use of energy resources is critical for sustainable economic development against the backdrop of energy saving national economy depends on energy imports, on the one hand, and rising prices for these resources. The basic foundation of the formation energy system of Ukraine is to build forecasting scenarios for different types of energy and different criteria for effective use of energy resources. Solving this problem is not only with ensuring energy security, but also with the level of development of regions of Ukraine and ensuring quality of life. Prediction <b>of</b> <b>petroleum</b> consumption in Ukraine today is an extremely important issue of strategic importance since conducted through analysis and building predictive models will be possible to develop guidelines for the efficient production and consumption <b>of</b> <b>petroleum</b> across Ukraine as a whole. ...|$|R

40|$|Bioremediation {{play key}} role in the {{treatment}} <b>of</b> <b>petroleum</b> hydrocarbon contaminated environment. Exposure <b>of</b> <b>petroleum</b> hydrocarbon into the environment occurs either due to human activities or accidentally and cause environmental pollution. Petroleum hydrocarbon cause many toxic compounds which are potent immunotoxicants and carcinogenic to human being. Remedial methods for the treatment <b>of</b> <b>petroleum</b> contaminated environment include various physiochemical and biological methods. Due to the negative consequences caused by the physiochemical methods, the bioremediation technology is widely adapted and considered {{as one of the best}} technology for the treatment <b>of</b> <b>petroleum</b> contaminated environment. Bioremediation utilizes the natural ability of microorganism to degrade the hazardous compound into simpler and non hazardous form. This paper provides a review on the role of bioremediation in the treatment <b>of</b> <b>petroleum</b> contaminated environment, discuss various hazardous effects <b>of</b> <b>petroleum</b> hydrocarbon, various factors influencing biodegradation, role of various enzymes in biodegradation and genetic engineering in bioremediation...|$|R

The samples were then subject to the determination <b>of</b> <b>petroleum</b> hydrocarbons, aliphatic hydrocarbons, and BTEX compounds (benzene, toluene, ethylbenzene, xylene). Due to adding various concentrations <b>of</b> <b>petroleum</b> into particular soil samples and applying different shaking times, it was possible to find out the impact <b>of</b> <b>petroleum</b> content and sample shaking duration on the course and possibility <b>of</b> <b>petroleum</b> substances removal by means of elution process...|$|R

40|$|Extract: When {{examining}} {{and comparing}} Norwegian and Australian petroleum legislation and regulation, parallels exist between petroleum regulation in both jurisdictions, since each have common internalised functions. In particular, this includes a petroleum legislative framework that comprises acts, regulations, and administrative guidelines in each jurisdiction. Both countries award petroleum licences to participants, {{and may also}} stipulate conditions for the award <b>of</b> <b>petroleum</b> licences. Although Norway uses the North Sea model, and Australia the North American model, both jurisdictions use the award <b>of</b> <b>petroleum</b> licences in formal licensing rounds {{to establish and maintain}} a relationship between the State and the oil companies during the exploitation <b>of</b> <b>petroleum</b> resources. In addition, there are administrative provisions in each jurisdiction for the allocation <b>of</b> <b>petroleum</b> licences outside <b>of</b> these formal licensing rounds. This paper provides a descriptive overview of the regulation <b>of</b> <b>petroleum</b> activities in Australia and Norway, covering the legal framework, joint venture arrangements, and the decommissioning <b>of</b> <b>petroleum</b> structures...|$|R
