Upon her return to England, she published Domestic Manners of the Americans in 1832. Mrs. Trollope strongly criticised the country and its customs: [...] "I <b>do</b> <b>not</b> <b>like</b> them. <b>I</b> <b>do</b> <b>not</b> <b>like</b> their principles, <b>I</b> <b>do</b> <b>not</b> <b>like</b> their manners, <b>I</b> <b>do</b> <b>not</b> <b>like</b> their opinions."

500|$|Nonetheless, the Emperor's {{infatuation with}} the Countess {{sometimes}} put Teresa Cristina {{in an awkward}} position, as when her younger daughter Leopoldina naively asked her why PedroII kept nudging Barral's foot during their class. The Countess's increasing intimacy {{with her husband and}} daughter was painful and vexing to Teresa Cristina. Although she feigned ignorance of the situation, it did not pass unnoticed. She wrote in her diary that Barral [...] "wished to make me tell her that <b>I</b> <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>like</b> her, but I did not say either yes or no." [...] Historian Tobias Monteiro wrote that the Empress [...] "could not disguise that she detested Barral." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{success of}} the initial Epaulettes series {{inspired}} the introduction of three new varieties with different designs and denominations in October 1849. These new types replaced the epaulettes design with the so-called [...] "Medallion" [...] (Médaillon) type, featuring Leopold I's portrait within a circular medallion window. In the same issue, a new denomination of forty centimes in red was produced for overseas mail. It was rumoured {{at the time that}} Leopold <b>I</b> <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>like</b> the design at the time, and believed that the epaulettes gave him a childlike aspect. The Epaulettes were officially superseded in 1859, but remained legally valid until 1 July 1866 when, following Leopold I's death, all stamps bearing his effigy were demonetised.|$|E

2500|$|David Lloyd George said of Gladstone in 1915: [...] "What {{a man he}} was!

He hated Nonconformists and Welsh Nonconformists in particular, {{and he had no}} real sympathy with the working-classes. But he was far and away the best Parliamentary speaker I have ever heard. He was not so good in exposition." [...] Asquithian Liberals continued to advocate traditional Gladstonian policies of sound finance, peaceful foreign relations and the better treatment of Ireland. They often compared Lloyd George unfavourably with Gladstone.|$|E
2500|$|She {{was offered}} many {{roles in the}} 1940s and {{throughout}} her retirement years but she rejected {{all but a few}} of them. In the few instances when she accepted, the slightest problem led her to drop out. Although she refused to talk to friends throughout her life about her reasons for retiring, she told Swedish biographer Sven Broman four years before her death [...] "I was tired of Hollywood. <b>I</b> <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>like</b> my work. There were many days when I had to force myself to go to the studio… I really wanted to live another life." ...|$|E
2500|$|McIntyre, {{believing that}} the gang {{intended}} to shoot the whole party, fled on Kennedy's horse. Several shots were fired at McIntyre as he dashed down the creek but none reached him, the rifles apparently being empty by that stage and only the revolvers available. Ned later wrote that he never intended to kill M'Intyre [...] "as <b>I</b> <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>like</b> to shoot him after he had surrendered". McIntyre galloped through the scrub for two miles, and then his horse, evidently wounded, became exhausted. Suffering from a severe fall during his escape and with his clothes in tatters, McIntyre concealed himself in a wombat hole until dark. At dark, he walked for an hour with his boots off to make no noise before collapsing from exhaustion. After a rest, and using a bright star and a small compass, he travelled about 20 miles until he reached a farm outside Mansfield, on Sunday afternoon. He then travelled by buggy to a police camp at the township, where he reported to Sub-Inspector Pewtress.|$|E

2500|$|In her {{introduction}} to The Womanist Reader, Layli Phillips contends that despite womanism's characterization, its {{main concern is}} not the black woman per se but rather the black woman {{is the point of}} origination for womanism. The basic tenets of womanism includes a strong self-authored spirit of activism that is especially evident in literature. Womanism has been such a polarizing movement for women that it has managed to step outside of the black community and extend itself into other non-white communities. [...] "Purple is to Lavender" [...] illustrates this through experiences that Dimpal Jain and Caroline Turner discuss. Some scholars view womanism as a subcategory of feminism while others argue that it is actually the other way around. Purple is to Lavender explores the concept that womanism is to feminism as purple is to lavender, that feminism falls under the umbrella of womanism. In [...] "Purple is to Lavender", Dimpal Jain and Caroline Turner discuss their experiences as non-white women in faculty. They experienced a great deal of discrimination because they were minorities. Jain is south Asian, while Caroline identifies as Filipino (Jain & Turner, pp.67–70). They go on to describe the concept of [...] "The Politics of Naming" [...] which shapes the reason for why they prefer womanism as opposed to feminism (Jain & Turner, pp.73–75). Jain states: [...] "I knew that the term feminism was contested and that <b>I</b> <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>like</b> how it fit in my mouth. It was uncomfortable and scratchy, almost like a foreign substance that I was being forced to consume as the White women continued to smile with comforting looks of familiarity and pride" [...] (Jain & Turner, p.68). Here Turner makes it well known that she feels as though feminism is something that is forced upon her. She feels like she cannot completely identify with feminism. It is also important to note Jain's statement that, [...] "The crux of the politics of naming is that names serve as identifiers and are not neutral when attached to social movements, ideas, and groups of people. Naming and labeling become politicized acts when they serve to determine any type of membership at a group level" [...] (Jain & Turner, p.73). This statement illustrates that if an individual identifies with feminism they may do so for particular reasons. However, those reasons may not be evident to the general public because of the connotation that the word feminism brings with it in terms of social movements, ideas, and groups of people. Individuals want something to identify with that expresses and supports their beliefs holistically. They want something that they can embrace to the fullest without any hint of regret. Similarly, Alice Walker even states: [...] "I don't choose womanism because it is [...] "better" [...] than feminism...I choose it because I prefer the sound, the feel, the fit of it… because I share the old ethnic-American habit of offering society a new word when the old word it is using fails to describe behavior and change that only a new word can help it more fully see" [...] (quoted in Jain & Turner, pp.77–78).|$|E
