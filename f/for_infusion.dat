5|$|Studies {{support the}} safety of antivenom, with around a 5% chance of an acute reaction, 1–2% of {{anaphylaxis}} and 10% chance of a delayed reaction due to serum sickness. Nevertheless, {{it is recommended that}} an injection of adrenaline be ready and available in case it is needed to treat a severe anaphylactic reaction, and also that the antivenom from the vial be administered diluted in a 100 ml bag of intravenous solution <b>for</b> <b>infusion</b> over 30 minutes. While it is rare that patients report symptoms of envenomation lasting weeks or months following a bite, there are case reports from the 1990s in which antivenom was reported to be effective in the relief of chronic symptoms when administered weeks or months after a bite, however, {{in the vast majority of}} cases, it is administered within 24 hours.|$|E

25|$|Hematin (trade name Panhematin) and heme arginate (trade name NormoSang) are {{the drugs}} {{of choice in}} acute porphyria, in the United States and the United Kingdom, respectively. These drugs need to be given very early in an attack to be effective; {{effectiveness}} varies amongst individuals. They are not curative drugs but can shorten attacks and reduce the intensity of an attack. Side effects are rare but can be serious. These heme-like substances theoretically inhibit ALA synthase and hence the accumulation of toxic precursors. In the United Kingdom, supplies of NormoSang are kept at two national centers; emergency supply is available from St Thomas's Hospital, London. In the United States, Lundbeck manufactures and supplies Panhematin <b>for</b> <b>infusion.</b>|$|E

In adults accessing the femoral artery is preferred because the insertion is simpler. Central VA ECMO may be used if cardiopulmonary bypass has already been established (with cannulae in the right atrium and ascending aorta).|$|E
50|$|A stripper, or tube stripper, is {{a medical}} tool used for {{removing}} air or liquid from rubber tubes, such as those used <b>for</b> <b>infusion</b> or connecting bags used when blood is collected and processed in a blood bank.

A stripper may be used, for instance, to move blood that remains in the tube {{at the end of a}} blood collection into the bag, thus avoiding wastage.|$|E
