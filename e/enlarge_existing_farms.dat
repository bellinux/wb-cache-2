The county currently relies on the Shihmen Reservoir as the single water supply system. It will be of great concern in the shortage of water resources. This study aims to explore the impact of changes in farm ponds on the regional agricultural environment in Taoyuan County with multiyear (1993, 2003, and 2010) SPOT satellite imagery. Results show that farm ponds have decreased by 10. 55 million m 2 from 1993 to 2010, and the <b>existing</b> <b>farm</b> ponds were 18. 80 million m 2 in 2010, equivalent to the irrigation water of 21. 10 ~ 31. 65 million m 3 (tons) and 37. 61 ~ 56. 41 million m 3 (tons), respectively. The <b>existing</b> <b>farm</b> ponds are able to provide the water supply for 1. 88 ~ 2. 82 thousand hectares of agricultural land, accounting for 6. 70 %~ 10. 50 % of total agricultural area of Taoyuan County. Corresponding to the government’s promotion policy (2012) on activating fallow land, if we redeploy the <b>existing</b> <b>farm</b> ponds for activating fallow fields, it will lessen the water supply burden of Shimen Reservoir. Thus, farm ponds remain the significant water facilities. For the sustainable agriculture, farm ponds shall be classified and cherished as a public asset for the future development...|$|R
