50|$|The {{annual survey}} Economic Freedom of the World is an {{indicator}} of economic freedom produced by James Gwartney and Robert Lawson, and is published by the Canadian Fraser Institute. The index uses a definition of economic freedom similar to laissez-faire capitalism {{and it has been}} more widely used than any measure of economic freedom. Its use stems in part from the longer time period covered (data exists from 1980-2008), and the fact that this index is constructed from third party information (in contrast to the index created by the Heritage Foundation). According to the index, the cornerstones of economic freedom are personal choice, voluntary <b>exchange,</b> <b>freedom</b> to compete, and security of privately owned property.|$|E

5000|$|... 1928 was {{the year}} of a {{significant}} reduction in external credit; generating a constant decline in the domestic bank credits and a hold back of the stock markets of Bogota and Medellin. Throughout 1929 the international coffee prices continued declining abruptly in addition to the New York stock market, and eventually the fist manifestations of urban unemployment boost generated an immediate internal market crisis. Deflection from that moment on till 1932 {{was the result of the}} international price reduction of Colombian exporting products. It was only until 1932 that the rise in gold production compensated the external dept as well as it created commercial balance, ultimately preventing the continuous loss in reserves. [...] After Colombia was able to defend its currency, it was in search of a new economic politic. This was based on three pillars; the fiscal, monetary and costumes or external commerce. The problem was that a free trade was established and the lack of government intervention in the economy was induced. International imports weren’t charged as much taxes supposedly to pay off the increase of life expenses, this didn’t generate any type of positive results, and by 1931 a protectionist economy reestablished with the purpose of reanimating the public investment. Anyway, Colombia found itself within the countries that had to surrender to their <b>exchange</b> <b>freedom</b> and abandon the gold reserves with the purpose of devaluating their currency before gold and dollars. In the long run it was a reaction to the collapse of international reserves. [...] Parallel to the causes of the economic crisis in Colombia, the presidents in charge of the time period (Abadia Mendez and Olaya Herrera) reduced hastily the public investment programs, causing a decline in the previous infrastructure privileged circumstances. This ultimately affected the public employment and finances.|$|E
40|$|For several years, the Economic Freedom of the World (EFW) annual reportspublished by {{a network}} of public-policy institutes, {{including}} the Fraser Insti-tute and the Cato Institute, have presented an economic freedom index for a large set of nations around the world. 1 This index is designed to measure {{the degree to which}} a nation’s policies and institutions protect its citizens ’ economic freedom. In this article, we explain the basic methodology employed in constructing the index and summarize the study’s findings. What Is Economic Freedom? Any attempt to quantify economic freedom must begin with a solid theoretical under-standing of the concept. The EFW report holds the key ingredients of economic free-dom to be personal choice, voluntary <b>exchange,</b> <b>freedom</b> to compete, and protection of person and property. Institutions and policies are consistent with economic freedom when they provide an infrastructure for voluntary exchange and protect individuals and James D.

40|$|In this paper, I {{would like}} to situate the Sartrean {{perspective}} on freedom {{with respect to the}} fact that the price of freedom is at issue nowadays like never before. Of particular note is the way recourse is taken to what one might call a ‘commodification’ of freedom. We are not only asked to consider the value of freedom, but to do so in relative terms. In the process, therefore, the questions concerning freedom take on a different guise. On the one hand, what must one give up or trade for freedom? On the other, wouldn’t one rather wish to <b>exchange</b> <b>freedom</b> in favor of a life apparently more stable, less risky, and less uncertain? Within this framework of understanding freedom, a critical question can be raised from Sartre’s perspective. Can freedom really be now less costly, now more? As if at least certain aspects of human freedom did not involve certain costs that are incurred no matter what one values, and no matter the circumstances?status: publishe...|$|E

The first two types of exchange freedoms give acceptable description of the spectrum and observables while the one pion exchange can not describe the observables and spectrum simultaneously, so can be excluded.

40|$|This report uses 42 {{distinct}} {{variables to}} create an index ranking of {{countries around the world}} based on policies that encourage economic freedom, and places Australia at number 10. Executive summaryThe index published in Economic Freedom of the World measures {{the degree to which the}} policies and institutions of countries are supportive of economic freedom. The cornerstones of economic freedom are personal choice, voluntary <b>exchange,</b> <b>freedom</b> to compete, and security of privately owned property. Forty-two variables are used to construct a summary index and to measure the degree of economic freedom in five broad areas: 1 Size of Government; 2 Legal System and Property Rights; 3 Sound Money; 4 Freedom to Trade Internationally; 5 Regulation. Since our first publication in 1996, numerous studies have used the data published in Economic Freedom of the World to examine the impact of economic freedom on investment, economic growth, income levels, and poverty rates. Virtually without exception, these studies have found that countries with institutions and policies more consistent with economic freedom have higher investment rates, more rapid economic growth, higher income levels, and a more rapid reduction in poverty rates. The EFW index now covers 152 countries and territories. Data are available for approximately 100 nations and territories back to 1980, and many back to 1970. 3 This data set makes it possible for scholars to analyze the impact of both cross-country differences in economic freedom and changes in that freedom across a threedecade time frame...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{analyzes}} {{the relationship between}} economic performance and institutional development in several Central and Eastern European Countries. Our meta-argument is that the structural transformations at the levels of the quantitative variables and mechanisms are {{only a part of}} the transition processes. In order to view the big picture, the qualitative aspects related to public policies and institutions should also be considered. We test the linkages between the quality of public policies and institutions for seven Central and Eastern European countries (Bulgaria, Poland, Czech Republic, Hungary, Slovenia, Slovakia and Romania) for a time span between 2001 and 2011. These countries are displaying a certain degree of heterogeneity in terms of economic performances and the design and implementation of public policies. We use for our analysis the World Bank indicators from World Wide Governance Indicators. In order to deal with the potential reverse causality issues, we employ Generalized Method of Moments Framework (GMM) by using the lagged variables as instruments. The impact of governance indicators is statistically significant even if we use several control variables: exchange rate, unemployment, current account deficit, taxes burden and price stability. The corresponding Sargan and Arellano-Bond test for zero autocorrelation in first-differenced errors tests shows that the results display a corresponding robustness. The main policy implications for our findings may be synthesized by the thesis, according to which a proper design of public policies, a high degree of their effectiveness and accountability, a stable social and political environment together with {{the rule of law and}} efficient anticorruption mechanisms are critical determinants of economic growth even in emerging markets. The impact of the government “size, economic structure and markets” mechanisms, monetary policy and price stability, ownership structure and legal rights, international <b>exchange,</b> <b>freedom</b> of exchange in capital and financial markets on economic growth is far from being negligible. Hence, the Central and Eastern European countries joining the EU should implement policies strength their institutions and to improve the quality of public decisions. ...|$|E
