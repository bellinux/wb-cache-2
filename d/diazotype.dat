5000|$|The {{process of}} <b>diazotype</b> (Whiteprints) {{replaced}} the cyanotype process (blueprints) for reproducing architectural and engineering drawings because {{the process was}} simpler and involved fewer toxic chemicals.|$|E
50|$|By {{the middle}} of the 20th century, wet-process reprographic {{techniques}} such as blueprinting, Pellet, and Van Dyke printing were largely superseded by various dry-printing processes. The most common of these is the <b>Diazotype</b> process, refined in the 1920s, which used paper supports sensitized with diazonium salts, a coupling agent, and an acid stabilizer to produce a dark line on a white ground. The Diazo positive print was considered more readable than a negative blueprint, and the dry process eliminated the image distortion of wet paper.|$|E
5000|$|A [...] heliographic copier or [...] heliographic {{duplicator}} is {{an apparatus}} {{used in the}} world of reprography for making contact prints on paper from original drawings made with that purpose on tracing paper, parchment paper or any other transparent or translucent material using different procedures. In general terms some type of heliographic copier is used for making: Hectographic prints, Ferrogallic prints, Gel-lithographs or Silver halide prints. All of them, until a certain size, can be achieved using a contact printer with an appropriate lamp (ultraviolet, etc...) but for big engineering and architectural plans, the heliographic copiers used with the cyanotype and the <b>diazotype</b> technologies, are of the roller type, which makes them completely different from contact printers.|$|E

50|$|Drawings {{should be}} grouped and {{identified}} for ease in retrieval, preferably within folders that are cut {{to fit the}} full dimensions of the corresponding container. As with rolled materials, the potentially damaging chemical interactions of print processes should be considered when grouping drawings in folders. Wherever possible, for example, blueprints should be segregated from <b>diazotypes,</b> and sepia diazo prints should be stored alone to the extent possible.|$|R
5000|$|However, {{compound}} [...] "Ozalid Process" [...] appears {{never to}} have been registered as a trademark, {{and the use of}} OZALID specifically for the Ozalid process using diazo compound paper is not currently registered as a trademark at least in the United States. OZALID as a mark for [...] "machines for diazo type prints" [...] was first registered in the United States in 1938 and is now expired. [...] Similarly, another registration for the use of OZALID for Light-Sensitive <b>Diazotype</b> Papers, Cloths, Films, etc., Machines for Photoprinting Thereon, Machines for Developing the Photoprints Thus Produced and Parts of Such Machines was first registered in the United States in 1942, and also has expired.|$|E
5000|$|In {{the process}} of {{whiteprint}} copying , [...] (essentially a <b>diazotype</b> process), a dynamic contact copier is used (similar to the manual action of exposing both sheets strongly bonded directly to the sunlight.). The exposition is made progressively as the twin rollers pull the two papers together (original and copy) against a source of ultraviolet light, typically a powerful black light lamp [...] The original plan (on a transparent support) and the diazo paper are introduced, in perfect contact, within the pinch rollers of the contact copier. The sensitized paper, has a photosensitive coating -an impregnation of diazo - covering {{the surface of the}} paper. Once exposed, the copied paper is immersed in a developer solution made from ammonia (or ammonia vapor) converting the parts of the paper not exposed to the light source to a characteristic dark violet colour (blue-line).|$|E
50|$|With {{the rise}} of the professionalized {{practice}} of western architecture {{in the second half of}} the 19th century, the field of architectural reprography—and the corresponding developments of photography and mass-produced wood-pulp paper—saw significant experiments and advances in technology. Beginning with major refinements in blueprinting processes in the 1840s, through the widespread adoption of <b>diazotype</b> printing after World War II, the design profession turned to analog architectural reprography to create accurate, to-scale reproductions of original drawings created on tracing paper, vellum, and linen supports. These copies were typically used throughout the architect’s own design process and also for distribution to clients, contractors, governmental agencies, and other interested parties. However, the integration of CAD—or Computer-Aided Design—over the last twenty-five years of design practice has made analog reprography far less common in the profession and more ephemeral in nature. For archivists, curators, librarians and other custodians of architectural records, traditional reprographic formats are now often seen as historic documents, with attendant needs for long-term care and conservation.|$|E
