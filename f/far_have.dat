5|$|Metallica's first {{official}} tour was Kill 'Em All for One, {{which started in}} 1983 to promote their debut album. Their longest so <b>far</b> <b>have</b> been the Wherever We May Roam and World Magnetic Tours, which lasted 14 months and 20 months, respectively, with each having over 170 concerts. The band {{is among the most}} lucrative live bands, selling out half of their first 187 concerts held during the 2000s, and gaining an attendance of over 3.5 million people and a gross of over US$227 million.|$|E
5|$|Lehnsherr learns of Jean's resurrection through Callisto, and the X-Men {{arrive at}} the Grey home {{at the same time}} as the Brotherhood. Lehnsherr and Xavier go in alone, and both vie for Jean's loyalty until the Phoenix resurfaces. She destroys the house and disintegrates Xavier before leaving with Lehnsherr. The Brotherhood decides to strike Worthington Labs, and the {{government}} sends multiple teams to attack the Brotherhood's base in the forest, with information gained from Darkhölme, furious over Lehnsherr's betrayal. However, the life forms in the camp are all copies of Multiple Man, and Lehnsherr uses his powers to move the Golden Gate Bridge so he and his army can get to Alcatraz and facilitate the attack on Worthington Labs. The remaining X-Men confront the Brotherhood, despite being significantly outnumbered, and arrive just as the military troops who thus <b>far</b> <b>have</b> been neutralizing the attacking mutants are overwhelmed by the Brotherhood.|$|E
5|$|Psittacosaurus {{is known}} from {{hundreds}} of individual specimens, of which over 75 have been assigned to the type species, P. mongoliensis. All Psittacosaurus fossils discovered so <b>far</b> <b>have</b> been found in Early Cretaceous sediments in Asia, from southern Siberia to northern China, and possibly {{as far south as}} Thailand. The most common age of geologic formations bearing Psittacosaurus fossils is from the late Barremian through Albian stages of the Early Cretaceous, or approximately 126 to 101mya (million years ago). Many terrestrial sedimentary formations of this age in Mongolia and northern China have produced fossils of Psittacosaurus, leading to the definition of this time period in the region as the Psittacosaurus biochron.|$|E

5|$|The {{types of}} {{coevolution}} listed so <b>far</b> <b>have</b> {{been described as}} if they operated pairwise (also called specific coevolution), in which traits of one species have evolved in direct response to traits of a second species, and vice versa. This {{is not always the}} case. Another evolutionary mode arises where evolution is still reciprocal, but is among a group of species rather than exactly two. This is called guild or diffuse coevolution. For instance, a trait in several species of flowering plant, such as offering its nectar {{at the end of a}} long tube, can coevolve with a trait in one or several species of pollinating insects, such as a long proboscis. More generally, flowering plants are pollinated by insects from different families including bees, flies, and beetles, all of which form a broad guild of pollinators which respond to the nectar or pollen produced by flowers.|$|E
5|$|There were {{considerable}} connections– political, trading, and cultural– {{between the}} Anglo-Saxon kingdoms {{and this is}} demonstrated in the burial ground found at Street House. The practice of burying people in beds {{seems to have been}} very uncommon in the north; most of the bed burials found so <b>far</b> <b>have</b> been in southern England, in Cambridgeshire, Essex, Suffolk, and Wiltshire. Several of the brooches and beads found in the graves are thought to have come from Kent and some of the jewellery and beadwork has strong parallels with finds from East Anglia. The Iron Age gold coins found in one grave came from a tribe that lived in the East Midlands, which suggests that their owner, likewise, was not local.|$|E

25|$|All of {{the laws}} treated so <b>far</b> <b>have</b> been for {{conjunction}} and disjunction. These operations have the property that changing either argument either leaves the output unchanged or the output changes {{in the same way}} as the input. Equivalently, changing any variable from 0 to 1 never results in the output changing from 1 to 0. Operations with this property are said to be monotone. Thus the axioms so <b>far</b> <b>have</b> all been for monotonic Boolean logic. Nonmonotonicity enters via complement ¬ as follows.|$|E
25|$|The {{compounds}} cyclohexanehexone or triquinoyl (C6O6) and cyclopentanepentone or leuconic acid (C5O5), {{which so}} <b>far</b> <b>have</b> been obtained only in trace amounts, {{can be regarded}} as polymers of carbon monoxide.|$|E

25|$|Scientists {{working with}} the PFS {{instrument}} announced that they tentatively discovered the spectral features of the compound ammonia in the Martian atmosphere. Just like methane discovered earlier (see above), ammonia breaks down rapidly in Mars' atmosphere {{and needs to be}} constantly replenished.

25|$|The avian {{influenza}} hemagglutinin binds alpha 2-3 sialic acid receptors, while human influenza hemagglutinins bind alpha 2-6 sialic acid receptors. This means when the H5N1 strain infects humans, it will replicate {{in the lower}} respiratory tract, and consequently will cause viral pneumonia. There is as yet no human form of H5N1, so all humans who have caught it so <b>far</b> <b>have</b> caught avian H5N1.|$|E

25|$|A {{number of}} blood {{substitutes}} have been explored (and still are), but thus far they all suffer from many challenges. Most {{attempts to find}} a suitable alternative to blood thus <b>far</b> <b>have</b> concentrated on cell-free hemoglobin solutions. Blood substitutes could make transfusions more readily available in emergency medicine and in pre-hospital EMS care. If successful, such a blood substitute could save many lives, particularly in trauma where massive blood loss results. Hemopure, a hemoglobin-based therapy, is approved for use in South Africa.|$|E
25|$|Both prokaryotes and eukaryotes {{transcripts}} {{have been}} observed with x-ray crystallography to have a NCIN-capped RNA product {{in addition to being}} observed under in vivo condition. The efficiency of NCIN capping is largely influenced by promoter sequence especially the -35 box and -10 box upstream of the transcription start site. Studies so <b>far</b> <b>have</b> defined the mechanism and structural basis of NCIN mediated capping but the function of these caps are still to be discovered. Recent consensus is that NCIN-mediated ab initio capping occurs in all organisms.|$|E
