5|$|We {{consider}} {{the surface area}} of the entire mass of mercury, including {{the part of the}} surface that is <b>in</b> <b>contact</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> glass, because mercury does not adhere to glass at all. So the surface tension of the mercury acts over its entire surface area, including where it is <b>in</b> <b>contact</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> glass. If instead of glass, the tube was made out of copper, the situation would be very different. Mercury aggressively adheres to copper. So in a copper tube, the level of mercury {{at the center of the}} tube will be lower than at the edges (that is, it would be a concave meniscus). In a situation where the liquid adheres to the walls of its container, we {{consider the}} part of the fluid's surface area that is <b>in</b> <b>contact</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> container to have negative surface tension. The fluid then works to maximize the contact surface area. So in this case increasing the area <b>in</b> <b>contact</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> container decreases rather than increases the potential energy. That decrease is enough to compensate for the increased potential energy associated with lifting the fluid near the walls of the container.|$|E

5|$|As {{with other}} welding {{processes}} such as gas metal arc welding, shielding gases are necessary in GTAW to protect the welding area from atmospheric gases such as nitrogen and oxygen, which can cause fusion defects, porosity, and weld metal embrittlement if they come <b>in</b> <b>contact</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> electrode, the arc, or the welding metal. The gas also transfers heat from the tungsten electrode to the metal, and it helps start and maintain a stable arc.|$|E
5|$|Barotrauma, {{an example}} of dysbarism, is {{physical}} damage to body tissues caused by a difference in pressure between a gas space inside, or <b>in</b> <b>contact</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> body, and the surrounding gas or fluid. It typically occurs when the organism is exposed to a large change in ambient pressure, such as when a diver ascends or descends. When diving, the pressure differences which cause the barotrauma are changes in hydrostatic pressure.|$|E
5|$|Before the {{construction}} of the Bjor√∏y Tunnel, the geology of the area was thought to consist entirely of metamorphic basement rocks similar to those exposed on the surrounding islands. The Jurassic sediments encountered in the tunnel included breccia and conglomerate <b>in</b> <b>contact</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> underlying gneisses and a sandstone with coal fragments, some of which was quite unconsolidated. Spore and pollen samples gave an Oxfordian age (Late Jurassic) for the sequence. The sedimentary rocks appear to have been deposited into an eroded depression caused by a fault zone, which later reactivated, disrupting the bedding and causing steep dips.|$|E

One crunch is completed when the upper body is lifted until both arms touch the thighs and then lowered until the shoulder blades touch the ground.

Now, as well as fighting a rearguard action, they had to capture positions between themselves and the railway line. Captain Lionel Queripel of 10 Para was awarded a posthumous Victoria Cross, the highest British military decoration, for his actions while in command of the battalion's rear guard.|$|E
5|$|Dendritic cells (DC) are phagocytes in tissues {{that are}} <b>in</b> <b>contact</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> {{external}} environment; therefore, they are located {{mainly in the}} skin, nose, lungs, stomach, and intestines. They are named for their resemblance to neuronal dendrites, as both have many spine-like projections, but dendritic cells are in no way connected to the nervous system. Dendritic cells serve as {{a link between the}} bodily tissues and the innate and adaptive immune systems, as they present antigens to T cells, one of the key cell types of the adaptive immune system.|$|E
5|$|Dendritic {{cells are}} {{specialized}} antigen-presenting cells {{that have long}} outgrowths called dendrites, that help to engulf microbes and other invaders. Dendritic cells {{are present in the}} tissues that are <b>in</b> <b>contact</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> external environment, mainly the skin, the inner lining of the nose, the lungs, the stomach, and the intestines. Once activated, they mature and migrate to the lymphoid tissues where they interact with T cells and B cells to initiate and orchestrate the adaptive immune response.|$|E

5|$|Fearing the Dutch {{would attempt}} to re-establish their {{authority}} over Indonesia, the new Republican Government and its leaders moved quickly to strengthen the fledgling administration. Within Indonesia, the newly formed government, although enthusiastic, was fragile and focused in Java (where focused at all). It was rarely and loosely <b>in</b> <b>contact</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> outer islands, which had more Japanese troops (particularly in Japanese naval areas), less sympathetic Japanese commanders, and fewer Republican leaders and activists. In November 1945, a parliamentary form of government was established and Sjahrir was appointed Prime Minister.|$|E
5|$|Fossil {{footprints}} {{show that}} pterosaurs stood {{with the entire}} foot <b>in</b> <b>contact</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> ground (plantigrade), {{in a manner similar}} to many mammals like humans and bears. Footprints from azhdarchids and several unidentified species show that pterosaurs walked with an erect posture with their four limbs held almost vertically beneath the body, an energy-efficient stance used by most modern birds and mammals, rather than the sprawled limbs of modern reptiles. Indeed, erect-limbs may be omnipresent in pterosaurs.|$|E

5|$|Franklin's {{electrostatic}} {{machine is}} a high-voltage static electricity generating device used by Benjamin Franklin in the mid-eighteenth century for research into electrical phenomena. Its key components are a glass globe which turned on an axis via a crank; a cloth pad <b>in</b> <b>contact</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> spinning globe; {{a set of}} metal needles to conduct away the charge developed on the globe by its friction with the pad; and a Leyden jara high-voltage capacitorto accumulate the charge. Franklin's experiments with the machine eventually led to new theories about electricity and inventing the lightning rod.|$|E
