25|$|Naphthalene {{has been}} used as a {{household}} <b>fumigant.</b> It was once the primary ingredient in mothballs, although its use has largely been replaced in favor of alternatives such as 1,4-dichlorobenzene. In a sealed container containing naphthalene pellets, naphthalene vapors build up to levels toxic to both the adult and larval forms of many moths that attack textiles. Other <b>fumigant</b> uses of naphthalene include use in soil as a <b>fumigant</b> pesticide, in attic spaces to repel animals and insects, and in museum storage-drawers and cupboards to protect the contents from attack by insect pests.|$|E

40|$|The {{activity}} of commercial soil <b>fumigants</b> on some key soilborne pathogens was assessed in sandy loam soil under controlled conditions. Seven soil <b>fumigants</b> that are registered in California or are being {{or have been}} considered for registration were used in this study: dimethyl disulfide (DMDS) mixed with chloropicrin (Pic) (79 % DMDS and 21 % Pic), Tri-Con (50 % methyl bromide and 50 % Pic), Midas Gold (33 % methyl iodide [MI] and 67 % Pic), Midas Bronze (50 % MI and 50 % Pic), Midas (MI, active ingredient [a. i. ] 97. 8 %), Pic (a. i. 99 % trichloronitromethane) and Pic-Clor 60 (57 % Pic and 37 % 1, 3 -dichloropropene [1 – 3,D]). Dose-response models were calculated for pathogen mortality after 24 hours of exposure to <b>fumigants.</b> Overall, the tested <b>fumigants</b> achieved good efficacy with dosages below the maximum label rate against the tested pathogens. In this study, Pythium ultimum and citrus nematode were sensitive to all the <b>fumigants</b> and Verticillium dahliae was resistant. For most <b>fumigants,</b> California regulations restrict application rates to less than the maximum (federal) label rate, meaning {{that it is possible}} that the <b>fumigants</b> may not control major plant pathogens. This research provides information on the effectiveness of these alternatives at these lower application rates. The results from this study will help growers optimize application rates for registered <b>fumigants</b> (such as Pic and 1, 3 -D) and will help accelerate the adoption of new <b>fumigants</b> (such as DMDS) if they are registered in California...|$|R
40|$|Current {{limitations}} on pesticides for managing prairie dog populations underscore {{the need for}} additional research on candidate compounds. I conducted this study to determine the efficacy and cost-effectiveness of two registered burrow <b>fumigants</b> (aluminum phosphide and gas cartridges) and three unregistered burrow <b>fumigants</b> (methyl bromide, chloropicrin, and a methyl bromide/chloropicrin mixture) for managing black-tailed prairie dogs. All five <b>fumigants</b> reduced burrow activity 94 % to 97 %, as measured by a plugged burrow technique. Total costs for materials and labor for the registered products, excluding application equipment, were nearly twice ($ 30. 00 to $ 38. 50) the cost of the unregistered <b>fumigants</b> ($ 15. 25 to $ 16. 25) ...|$|R
40|$|Tomato (Lycopersicon esculentum Mill.) {{field studies}} were {{conducted}} to determine the impact of mulch types combined with soil <b>fumigants</b> on spring tomato yields and on soilborne pests and weeds. <b>Fumigants</b> were: a) untreated control, b) methyl bromide + chloropicrin (67 / 33 %, respectively) {{at a rate of}} 400 kg ha - 1, c) chloropicrin at 400 kg ha - 1 plus the herbicide pebulate at 4. 5 kg ha - 1, d) 1, 3 -dichlopropene at 325 kg ha - 1 + chloropicrin at 67 kg ha - 1 (83 / 17 %, respectively) plus pebulate at 4. 5 kg ha - 1 and e) metam sodium at 485 kg ha - 1 plus pebulate at 4. 5 kg ha - 1. Mulch types were either black low-density polyethylene film (0. 038 mm thick) or black paper mulch. Results indicated that all <b>fumigants</b> with either mulch type had higher tomato yield and more effective soilborne disease and purple nutsedge (Cyperus rotundus L.) control than the non-fumigated control. Paper mulch appeared to be a valuable alternative to control purple nutsedge with no <b>fumigants</b> and with low-volatility <b>fumigants,</b> such as metam sodium, whereas plastic mulch might retain high-volatility <b>fumigants,</b> such as methyl bromide, longer, thus increasing efficacy...|$|R
25|$|Because the {{previously}} popular <b>fumigant</b> methyl bromide has been phased {{out in some}} countries under the Montreal Protocol, phosphine is the only widely used, cost-effective, rapidly acting <b>fumigant</b> that does not leave residues on the stored product.

High level resistance is also likely to occur in other regions, but has not been as closely monitored. Genetic variants that contribute to high level resistance to phosphine have been identified in the dihydrolipoamide dehydrogenase gene. Identification of this gene now allows rapid molecular identification of resistant insects.|$|E

40|$|Abstract: The {{search for}} {{alternative}} <b>fumigants</b> has been ongoing since the 1992 Parties of the Montreal Protocol classified methyl bromide as a Class I controlled substance with an {{ozone depletion potential}} (ODP) of 0. 7 and destined it for phase-out. This paper focuses on the hazards from <b>fumigants</b> proposed as alternatives for pre-plant soil fumigation in tomato production. We use the Environmental Impact Quotient (EIQ) developed by Kovach et al. to estimate the hazards from methyl bromide and the proposed alternative <b>fumigants</b> to workers, consumers, beneficial arthropods, birds, fish, and bees. Our findings indicate that iodomethane 98 / 2 has the lowest EIQ index value and field use rating, and is the alternative with the lowest relative risk. Among environmental categories, workers and beneficial arthropods experience the highest relative risks from the proposed tomato <b>fumigants,</b> and fish and consumers the least risks...|$|R
25|$|Carbonyl sulfide {{is used as}} an {{intermediate}} {{in the production of}} thiocarbamate herbicides. Carbonyl sulfide is a potential alternative <b>fumigant</b> to methyl bromide and phosphine. In some cases, however, residues on the grain result in flavours that are unacceptable to consumers, e.g. barley used for brewing. Carbonyl sulfide is readily converted to the gaseous signaling molecule hydrogen sulfide by carbonic anhydrase enzymes in plants and mammals. Because of this chemistry, the release of carbonyl sulfide from small organic molecules has been identified as a strategy for delivering hydrogen sulfide in different biological contexts.|$|E
25|$|Methyl iodide {{had also}} been {{proposed}} {{for use as a}} fungicide, herbicide, insecticide, nematicide, and as a soil disinfectant, replacing methyl bromide (also known as bromomethane) (banned under the Montreal Protocol). Manufactured by Arysta LifeScience and sold under the brand name MIDAS, methyl iodide is registered as a pesticide in the U.S., Mexico, Morocco, Japan, Turkey, and New Zealand and registration is pending in Australia, Guatemala, Costa Rica, Chile, Egypt, Israel, South Africa and other countries. The first commercial applications of MIDAS soil <b>fumigant</b> in California began in Fresno County, in May, 2011.|$|E

2500|$|The use of {{methyl iodide}} as a <b>fumigant</b> has drawn concern. For example, 54 chemists and {{physicians}} contacted the U.S. EPA in a letter, saying [...] "We are skeptical of U.S. EPA’s {{conclusion that the}} high levels of exposure to methyl iodide that are likely to result from broadcast applications are 'acceptable' risks. U.S. EPA has made many assumptions about toxicology and exposure in the risk assessment that have not been examined by independent scientific peer reviewers for adequacy or accuracy. Additionally, none of U.S. EPA’s calculations account for the extra vulnerability of the unborn fetus and children to toxic insults." [...] EPA Assistant Administrator Jim Gulliford replied saying, [...] "We are confident that by conducting such a rigorous analysis and developing highly restrictive provisions governing its use, there will be no risks of concern," [...] and in October the EPA approved the use of methyl iodide as a soil <b>fumigant</b> in the United States.|$|E
2500|$|... 1,3-Dichloropropene, {{sold under}} diverse trade names, [...] is an {{organochlorine}} compound. [...] It is colorless liquid {{with a sweet}} smell.

It is widely used in the US and other countries, but {{is in the process}} of being phased out in the European Union.|$|E
2500|$|Pesticides can be {{classified}} by target organism (e.g., herbicides, insecticides, fungicides, rodenticides, and pediculicides – see table), chemical structure (e.g., organic, inorganic, synthetic, or biological (biopesticide), although the distinction can sometimes blur), and physical state (e.g. gaseous (<b>fumigant)).</b> Biopesticides include microbial pesticides and biochemical pesticides. Plant-derived pesticides, or [...] "botanicals", have been developing quickly. These include the pyrethroids, rotenoids, nicotinoids, and a fourth group that includes strychnine and scilliroside.|$|E

40|$|Concerns about {{consumer}} and worker {{safety and the}} fate of <b>fumigants</b> have fuelled strong efforts to determine their residues in foodstuffs. <b>Fumigants</b> are usually extracted from commodities with solvent at room temperature (25 °C). In this paper, solvent extraction of methyl bromide, phosphine, carbonyl sulfide, and carbon disulfide using ultrasonic acceleration or heating was evaluated. Wheat samples plus solvent, in gas-tight bottles, were placed in an ultrasonic chamber or an oven (50 °C), and <b>fumigants</b> were released into the headspace over the solvent. Completeness of extraction was demonstrated within 2 h for ultrasonic extraction, 7 - 20 h for 50 °C heating, and 8 - 35 h for room temperature extraction.

2500|$|The California Department of Pesticide Regulation (DPR) {{concluded}} that methyl iodide is [...] "highly toxic," [...] that [...] "any anticipated scenario for the agricultural or structural fumigation {{use of this}} agent would result in exposures to {{a large number of}} the public and thus would have a significant adverse impact on the public health", and that adequate control of the chemical in these circumstances would be [...] "difficult, if not impossible."

2500|$|On {{the night}} of July 14, 1991, a Southern Pacific train derailed into the upper Sacramento River at a sharp bend of track known as the Cantara Loop, {{upstream}} from Dunsmuir, California, in Siskiyou County. Several cars made contact with the water, including a tank car. Early {{in the morning of}} 15 July, it became apparent that the tank car had ruptured and spilled its entire contents into the river – approximately 19,000 gallons of a soil <b>fumigant</b> – metam sodium. Ultimately, over a million fish, {{and tens of thousands of}} amphibians and crayfish were killed. Millions of aquatic invertebrates, including insects and mollusks, which form the basis of the river's ecosystem, were destroyed. Hundreds of thousands of willows, alders, and cottonwoods eventually died. Many more were severely injured. The chemical plume left a 41-mile wake of destruction, from the spill site to the entry point of the river into Shasta Lake. The accident still ranks as the largest hazardous chemical spill in California history. This substance was not classified as a hazardous material at the time of the incident.|$|E
2500|$|Until {{the late}} 1970s, Dow {{produced}} DBCP (1,2-dibromo-3-chloropropane), a soil <b>fumigant,</b> and nematicide, sold under the names the Nemagon and Fumazone. [...] Plantation workers who alleged that they became sterile or were stricken with other maladies subsequently sued both Dow and Dole in Latin American courts. The cases were marred by extensive fraud, including the falsification of test {{results and the}} recruitment of plaintiffs who had never worked at Dole plantations. While Nicaraguan courts awarded the plaintiffs over $600 million in damages, they {{have been unable to}} collect any payment from the companies. A group of plaintiffs then sued in the United States, and, on November 5, 2007, a Los Angeles jury awarded them $3.2 million. Dole and Dow vowed to appeal the decision. On April 23, 2009 a Los Angeles judge threw out two cases against Dole and Dow due to fraud and extortion by lawyers in Nicaragua recruiting fraudulent plaintiffs to make claims against the company.

40|$|The {{movement}} of soil <b>fumigants</b> through plastic mulch films following soil fumigation {{is of interest}} because reducing film permeability may result in increased efficacy and reduced emissions. Low-density or high-density polyethylene films (LDPE or HDPE) were reported to be permeable to soil <b>fumigants,</b> while virtually impermeable films (VIF) were shown to greatly reduce {{movement of}} these <b>fumigants</b> (Papiernik and Yates 2001). Although VIF reduces permeability and improves efficacy of <b>fumigants</b> (Gilreath and Chellemi 1998, Noling et al. 2001), it has not met with widespread grower acceptance {{for a number of}} reasons, primarily higher cost and poor handling characteristics. As a result, there is still a need to identify films and/or coatings for polyethylene films that will reduce movement of <b>fumigants,</b> but will not be as costly or difficult to handle. The method reported here was developed as a quick, simple, and inexpensive way to detect differences in film permeability. The test chamber used is shown in Fig. 1. Details of construction materials are given in the figure. All seams were sealed with silicon adhesive and chambers tested for leaks by filling with water and allowing to stand overnight. The capacity of each chamber was 2950 ml. Telone ® II (97. 5 % 1, 3 -dichloropropene) was introduced into the lower chamber by placing 0. 5 ml in a 25 ml scintillation vial and placing the vial {{into the bottom of the}} chamber.
