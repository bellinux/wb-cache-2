30|$|For {{the static}} bending test, a {{universal}} testing machine of 200 -kN capacity (made by Tokyokoki Seizosho Ltd.) {{was used for the}} 100 -kN range. Third-point loading was applied with a total span of 360  cm. The total span deflection of green round timber was measured using the CDP- 100 <b>displacement</b> <b>gauge</b> with 10 -cm capacity (made by Tokyo Sokki Kenkyujo Co., Ltd.). The <b>displacement</b> <b>gauge</b> was mounted on a yoke to measure the neutral axis deflection. The targeted duration of testing was 5  min. The apparent Young’s modulus was obtained based on the total span deflection, and calculated at the middle circumference of the round timber. The bending strength was calculated at the circumference of a failure part from the ratio of the mid-length circumference to the circumference at the loading point. However, 9 of the 40 green round timbers did not show failure, even at the extension limit of the testing machine’s ram cylinder. For these specimens, load at the extension limit of the test machine’s ram cylinder was considered the maximum load. For the air-dried round timber, the total span deflection was measured using the rolled-in type DP- 500 E <b>displacement</b> <b>gauge</b> with 50 -cm capacity (made by Tokyo Sokki Kenkyujo Co., Ltd.).

For the present study, the Analogue CSIRO Tomato Firmness Meter (AFM), which measures fruit deformation under a 500 g load applied for 30 s was modified by replacing the analogue <b>displacement</b> <b>gauge</b> with a digital gauge and by using a laboratory jack for positioning the fruit in the vertical dimension. Non-destructive measurements of tomato fruit softening during ripening and determined with the Digital Firmness Meter (DFM) were strongly correlated with both firmness measured with the AFM (r(2) = 0. 96, n = 19) and with firmness determined subjectively by hand pressure (r(2) = 0. 93, n = 19). Similarly, mango fruit softening during ripening was monitored and DFM and hand firmness measurements were well correlated (r(2) = 0. 95, n = 10).

40|$|In bridge maintenance, {{particularly}} with regard to fatigue damage in steel bridges, it is important to determine the displacement response of the entire bridge under a live load {{as well as that of}} each member. Knowing the displacement response enables the identification of dynamic deformations that can cause stresses and ultimately lead to damage and thus also allows the undertaking of appropriate countermeasures. In theory, the displacement response can be calculated from the double integration of the measured acceleration. However, data measured by an accelerometer include measurement errors caused by the limitations of the analog-to-digital conversion process and sensor noise. These errors distort the double integration results. Furthermore, as bridges in service are constantly vibrating because of passing vehicles, estimating the boundary conditions for the numerical integration is difficult. To address these problems, this paper proposes a method for determining the displacement of a bridge in service from its acceleration based on its free vibration. To verify the effectiveness of the proposed method, field measurements were conducted using nine different accelerometers. Based on the results of these measurements, the proposed method was found to be highly accurate in comparison with the reference displacement obtained using a contact <b>displacement</b> <b>gauge...</b>|$|E

40|$|To {{implement}} {{steel bridge}} maintenance, especially that related to fatigue damage, {{it is important}} to monitor bridge deformations under traffic conditions. Bridges deform and rotate differently under traffic load conditions because their structures differ in terms of length and flexibility. Such monitoring enables the identification of the cause of stress concentrations that cause fatigue damage and the proposal of appropriate countermeasures. However, although bridge deformation monitoring requires observations of bridge angle response as well as the bridge displacement response, measuring the rotation angle response of a bridge subject to traffic loads is difficult. Theoretically, the rotation angle response can be calculated by integrating the angular velocity, but for field measurements of actual in-service bridges, estimating the necessary boundary conditions would be difficult due to traffic-induced vibration. To solve the problem, this paper proposes a method for determining the rotation angle response of an in-service bridge from its angular velocity, as measured by a inertial measurement unit (IMU). To verify our proposed method, field measurements were conducted using nine micro-electrical mechanical systems (MEMS) IMUs and two contact <b>displacement</b> <b>gauges.</b> The results showed that our proposed method provided high accuracy when compared to the reference responses calculated by the contact <b>displacement</b> <b>gauges...</b>|$|R

30|$|When a large vehicle {{reaches the}} bridge, its weight is {{measured}} with a load cell at {{the starting point of}} the bridge. When the measured force is uploaded into the system, a program is activated to calculate the counterforce required for controlling the deck deflection. The system calculates the cable tension (optimal counterforce) required to hold the main girder displacement under normal loads (allowable displacement) when the heavy vehicle reaches the first measurement point (A). Once the optimal counterforce is determined, instructions are sent to the actuator to start operation, stressing/releasing of stay cables starts and, at the same time, the monitoring system begins to measure cable tension. The decision-making function compares the measured cable tension with the optimal counterforce and repeatedly stresses and relaxes cable tension until an agreement is reached. When the adjustment of tension is finished, the load is moved to measurement point A where a <b>displacement</b> <b>gauge</b> is in place as shown in Figure  6. When the large vehicle reaches measurement point A, the above process is repeated for the next measurement point B. Operation is repeated from the time a large vehicle reaches the starting point of the bridge model until the vehicle reaches the end, and the deck deflection is measured each time the control measure is taken.|$|E
40|$|Abstract. Recently, Mg-Zn-Y alloys with {{superior}} performance, {{which have a}} long period order (LPO) phase, have been developed. Therefore, {{it is important to}} understand fundamental fatigue properties in such materials. In this study, the fatigue fracture behavior of Mg-Zn 2 -Y 2 -Zr 0. 2 alloy has been investigated using a plain fatigue bending testing machine, which was originally developed for thin sheet specimen. One end of the sheet specimen is fixed at a voice coil of the loudspeaker and the other end is set free. A bending mode resonance occurs in the specimen due to forced vibration at the fixed end. To estimate stress amplitude of bending, deflections at the free end of the specimen oscillating at a frequency of about 250 ~ 700 Hz was measured by a laser <b>displacement</b> <b>gauge.</b> For comparison, AZ 31 B alloy also has been investigated. S-N curve for the Mg-Zn 2 -Y 2 -Zr 0. 2 alloy was obtained using a stress ratio of R=- 1, and the fatigue strength was estimated as about 200 MPa at 106 ~ 108 cycles. The value corresponds to about 50 % of 0. 2 % proof strength of the alloy. Two types of fatigue surface were observed in the alloy. One is striation like pattern and the other is relatively flat surface. The former is similar to fatigue surface of AZ 31 B. Therefore, these two types of fatigue surface correspond to crack passing through α-Mg phase and LPO phase, respectively...|$|E
40|$|An {{improved}} {{method and}} apparatus {{have been devised}} for measuring cyclic errors in the readouts of laser heterodyne interferometers that are configured and operated as displacement gauges. The cyclic errors arise {{as a consequence of}} mixing of spurious optical and electrical signals in beam launchers that are subsystems of such interferometers. The conventional approach to measurement of cyclic error involves phase measurements and yields values precise to within about 10 pm over air optical paths at laser wavelengths in the visible and near infrared. The present approach, which involves amplitude measurements instead of phase measurements, yields values precise to about. 0. 1 microns. about 100 times the precision of the conventional approach. In a <b>displacement</b> <b>gauge</b> of the type of interest here, the laser heterodyne interferometer is used to measure any change in distance along an optical axis between two corner-cube retroreflectors. One of the corner-cube retroreflectors is mounted on a piezoelectric transducer (see figure), which is used to introduce a low-frequency periodic displacement that can be measured by the gauges. The transducer is excited at a frequency of 9 Hz by a triangular waveform to generate a 9 -Hz triangular-wave displacement having an amplitude of 25 microns. The displacement gives rise to both amplitude and phase modulation of the heterodyne signals in the gauges. The modulation includes cyclic error components, and the magnitude of the cyclic-error component of the phase modulation is what one needs to measure {{in order to determine the}} magnitude of the cyclic displacement error. The precision attainable in the conventional (phase measurement) approach to measuring cyclic error is limited because the phase measurements are af...|$|E

40|$|For {{studying}} the deformation and failure modes of tunnel surrounding rock systematically under different continuum media, model tests {{have been performed}} on artificial cohesive material and artificial sandy materials. Barite powder, quartz sand and vaseline are the key ingredients of the cohesive similar material. Two types of sandy material made of quartz, and quartz+barite powder are tested respectively. Pressure cell, <b>displacement</b> <b>gauge</b> and non-contact precision measurement are used to monitor the surrounding rock response after excavation, the stress and deformation of the surrounding rock induced by tunnelling and further loading. For cohesive material {{in the process of}} step loading, failure first occurs {{on both sides of the}} tunnel and then at tunnel crown. According to the displacement and stress monitoring results, in response to the increase in load, the size of plastic zone increases as well. It also reveals that once the plastic zone develops, the rate of deformation in the tunnel surrounding rock will increase. Tunnel excavation in the sandy quartz material does not possess self-stability. However, for sandy material made of quartz and barite, the tunnel remains stable after excavation. For this mixture material, with the increase in applied pressure, failure arch first appears at the tunnel crown which follows the shape of a parabola curve. The arch foot then moves towards the sides of the tunnel. Stability is achieved when it reaches the central axis of the tunnel; at this point, the collapse arch sliding surface is similar to the Platts theory. This series of model tests, which allow the observation of the deformation failure modes for tunnel under different continuum media, provide significant information for the determination of tunnel supporting parameters.

40|$|An {{extensive}} research program {{was performed to}} investigate the load interaction effect of the combined action of small amplitude high R ratio cycles and large amplitude low R ratio underloads on the crack growth of large cracks. The study was driven by {{the needs of the}} damage tolerance approach in the helicopter structures, which requires robust knowledge on the crack growth behaviour of the advance high strength alloys under the characteristic helicopter spectra loading. The study was conducted on three metallic alloys, Ti- 10 V- 2 Fe- 3 Al, Al 8090 T 852 and Al 7010 T 76351 using compact tension specimens (w= 70 mm, t= 17 mm). The potential drop technique was used for the measurements of the crack length. The crack opening loads were determined from the applied load versus crack opening mouth displacement curve using a curve fitting technique and crack opening <b>displacement</b> <b>gauge.</b> The experimental results show that cracks can grow faster than the life predictions with no load interaction effects under spectra containing tensile underloads. The acceleration effects are different depending on the number of the small cycles, the Kmax, the R ratio of the small cycles, the underload cycle and the material. Significant closure observations on the underloads and on the small cycles of variable amplitude loading spectra were made. Based on the test finding and on the studies of other researchers, it is suggested that the acceleration effects are mainly due to the reduction of crack opening point of the tensile underloads comparing with the Constant Amplitude Loading (CAL) data. An extensive evaluation of the ability of FASTRAN model to predict the fatigue lives under the tested loading spectra was carried out. The evaluation focuses on the influence of the constraint factor a and the ∆Keff curve inputs on the predictions. The model produces very good and consistent predictions for the three alloys, when the inputs represent adequately the actual fatigue mechanism. The model predicts the measured acceleration effects by reducing the closure level of the underloads. EThOS - Electronic Theses Online ServiceGBUnited Kingdo...|$|E

The fracture mechanics of brittle solids are outlined and the toughening mechanisms operating within continuous fibre reinforced ceramic matrix composites are discussed. The importance of the fibre-matrix interface in governing the overall mechanical properties of a composite is highlighted with respect to the micromechanical properties of interface debond fracture surface energy OJ and frictional shear stress t. Current techniques for measuring OJ and t are listed, together with their inherent disadvantages. The requirement for a micro-indentation system {{that can be used to}} measure interfacial properties via individual fibre pushing experiments across a wide range of composite systems, is discussed. The development of a unique Scanning Electron Microscope (SEM) based microindentation system is described in detail. It enables dynamic, high magnification imaging of the indentor tip and specimen contact point, and continuously records applied load and tip displacement throughout the indentation cycle. A piezoelectric load cell, coupled to a specifically developed amplifier, enables load resolution of 2 mN measured up to the maximum possible of 20 N. Novel capacitance <b>displacement</b> <b>gauge</b> design gives a resolution of lOnm over a l 00 pm range. The instrument has been used successfully to measure the interface micromechanical properties across a wide range of silicon carbide fibre reinforced glass and glass ceramic matrix composites. This data has been correlated with interface structural information obtained via Transmission Electron Microscopy (TEM) and SEM. Effects of oxidation, fatigue testing and interface pre-synthesis via fibre coating, have been measured. Fibres with diameters ranging from 7 JJ;mto 150 pm have been tested to demonstrate the versatility of the device for interfacial property measurement across the full range of modem ceramic matrix composites.

40|$|This thesis {{addresses}} particular {{topics in}} the field of the length metrology for nanometrology. Nanometrology deals with dimensional measurements of micro- and nanostructures with a high spatial resolution. It typically combines a microscope imaging with a precise coordinate measurement, usually capable of nanometre resolution using the state-of-art laser interferometry techniques. The development in this field is driven, among others, by emerging advanced nanotechnologies that demand to push further the capabilities and limits of the interferometric techniques to make the nanometre-level dimensional measurement of nanostructures possible. The principal limitations of current systems are the environmental conditions and especially the fluctuations in the refractive index of air. The theoretical part of this thesis aim at analysis of individual parts of laser interferometer. I oriented myself on the study of their advantages/disadvantages and further also the possibilities of their industrial applications. The second part of the thesis presents my work that focused on the influence of the refractive index of air (RIA) on the measurement uncertainty. I experimentally demonstrated an interferometric system with a self-cancellation RIA fluctuations: a transparent photodetector is used for the measurement of the standing wave along the axis of a passive resonator, where the resonator also serves as a reference for the laser wavelength stabilisation. Another optical arrangement, based on a setup of several Michelson interferometers, represents a combination of an interferometer and a refractometer into a single system. This setup was used to study the behaviour of the ambient airflow with respect to the optical path difference and physical separation of the interferometer’s and refractometer’s path. Based on the experimental results I proposed new arrangements for shape measuring interferometers, which combine length interferometry and a tracking refractometer for the direct compensation of RIA fluctuations with geometrically adjacent optical beams. The results indicate an improvement in RIA fluctuation induced uncertainty by a factor of 100. Third part describes the design and implementation of interferometric systems for specific applications. For the industrial environment I developed a compact interferometric <b>displacement</b> <b>gauge</b> which is designed to allow nanometre level measurement using a simplified interferometer construction.

40|$|This {{investigation}} {{explores the}} behaviour of contact interaction between probe tips of indicators (<b>displacement</b> <b>gauges)</b> and rough engineering surfaces, {{in order to}} gain new insights into uncertainty in industrial precision gauging. The conditions of interest are contact of a mm-scale hard sphere at 0. 1 to 5 N force with metallic surfaces, Rq < 2 mm. The motivation arises from the growing demand of modern industries for higher machining processes and for finer inspection capabilities. In the near future, such a demand is likely to require careful analyses of the measurement error budget of these instruments with a greater consideration of the potential errors induced by the complex behaviour of contact, which is currently assumed to be negligible. A preliminary experimental study was carried out on an existing test-rig of limited accuracy. It raised several concerns related to the effects of surface roughness and material on the resulting contact deflection at the load regimes of indicators’ probes. It stimulated the need for more reliable data. So, a new test-rig of advanced capabilities was designed to perform a comprehensive study of a wider range of contact parameters to simulate real situations of industrial gauging processes. This advanced study confirms the consistent effects of roughness, material and probe tip size not only on the surface deflections but also on the probe rotations. Roughness variability across the same surface caused some inconsistencies in the deflection behaviour and repeatability, and surface contamination gave additional unsystematic effects on these relations. Re-establishing contact on the same position of a contaminated surface appeared to contribute errors of the order of those of a clean surface. Based on the results of this investigation, systematic errors of contact can exceed the 1 mm level with uncertainty up to at least 0. 4 mm in many measurement processes with precision indicators. Such figures reveal that the contact cannot any longer be considered a negligible source of errors, and precision metrology must account for these induced errors in the budget of <b>displacement</b> <b>gauges...</b>|$|R

Soil response during and after shaking was monitored by many miniature accelerometers, pore pressure transducers, and <b>displacement</b> <b>gauges</b> placed throughout the soil model. The effect on the seismic behavior of the dam of different parameters such as the thickness, location, and depth of liquefiable layer is studied. This paper describes some of these tests and briefly presents the preliminary results. Valuable insights into the dynamic behavior of the employed embankment-foundation systems are provided. Currently, such testing results offer a valuable alternative to actual full-scale dynamic response, which is virtually non-existent...|$|R
