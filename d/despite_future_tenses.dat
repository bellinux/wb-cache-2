40|$|Throughout {{the history}} of Turkic, the <b>future</b> <b>tense</b> affix {{exhibits}} different forms and frequently changes over time. In the modern Turkish of Turkey, the <b>future</b> <b>tense</b> suffix –acak/-ecek corresponds to several different affixes used in the Old Turkic period. In this article, the <b>future</b> <b>tense</b> suffixes used in Orkhon and Uyghur Turkic are examined, and their functions, roots, and the personal suffixes used in their conjugations are discussed. After providing {{a brief overview of}} the Göktürks, the Orkhon Inscriptions, and Orkhon Turkic in the introduction, the main concern of this article, the <b>future</b> <b>tense,</b> is introduced. <b>Future</b> <b>tense</b> verb conjugations found in the Orkhon ınscriptions, in which personal pronouns and possessive suffixes are used, are presented in tables showing how they are formed for all persons, singular and plural. After discussing the etymology of the <b>future</b> <b>tense</b> affix –DaçI, its conjugation, again showing all singular and plural persons, is presented in table format. Discussion of the <b>future</b> <b>tense</b> affixes –sIk and –çI is followed by examples found in the texts. Next, examples of the unrealized <b>future</b> <b>tense</b> are given, after which general information regarding the period of Uyghur Turkic is presented. The etymologies and conjugations of the <b>future</b> <b>tense</b> suffixes -ga and -GAy are discussed, followed by relevant examples. <b>Future</b> <b>tense</b> affixes and conjugations in Uyghur Turkic are examined in this study with the goal of contributing to future research on these topics. ...|$|R

5000|$|Given that {{obligation}} inherently {{carries a}} sense of futurity ("Carthage must be destroyed" [...] {{at some point in}} the future), it anticipates how the Romance languages such as French would use [...] "habeo" [...] as the basis for their <b>future</b> <b>tenses</b> (abandoning the Latin forms of the <b>future</b> <b>tense).</b> While in Latin [...] "amare habeo" [...] is the indirect discourse [...] "I have to love", in the French equivalent,"aimerai" [...] (habeo > ayyo > ai, aimer+ai), it has become the <b>future</b> <b>tense,</b> [...] "I will love", losing the sense of obligation. In Medieval Latin, however, it was still indirect discourse and not yet used as simply a <b>future</b> <b>tense.</b>|$|R
5000|$|In grammar, a <b>future</b> <b>tense</b> (abbreviated [...] ) is a verb {{form that}} {{generally}} marks the event {{described by the}} verb as not having happened yet, but expected {{to happen in the}} future. An example of a <b>future</b> <b>tense</b> form is the French aimera, meaning [...] "will love", derived from the verb aimer ("love"). English does not have a <b>future</b> <b>tense</b> formed by verb inflection in this way, although it has a number of ways to express the future, particularly the construction with the auxiliary verb will or shall or is/am/are going to and grammarians differ in whether they describe such constructions as representing a <b>future</b> <b>tense</b> in English.|$|R
50|$|It {{is likely}} that the tonal {{lowering}} seen in this particular example is related to the low tone nasal prefix found in <b>future</b> <b>tense</b> constructions in some other Senufo languages.

50|$|In other languages, {{mostly of}} European origin, {{specific}} markers indicate futurity. These structures constitute a <b>future</b> <b>tense.</b> In many cases, an auxiliary verb is used, as in English, where futurity is often {{indicated by the}} modal auxiliary will (or shall). However, some languages combine such an auxiliary with the main verb to produce a simple (one-word, morphological) <b>future</b> <b>tense.</b> This is {{the origin of the}} <b>future</b> <b>tense</b> in Western Romance languages such as French and Italian (see below).|$|R

40|$|The {{analysis}} of the <b>future</b> <b>tense</b> in Akan has long proved difficult. This thesis, based on original fieldwork conducted {{in the summer of}} 20101, will attempt to use a Minimalist framework to capture the complexities of this tense in the Fante dialect. It will be shown that the <b>future</b> <b>tense</b> in Fante is epiphenomenal, and that in fact the language has only a binary past/non-past tense system. Diachronic and synchronic accounts of Fante tense and aspect will be developed, shedding new light on the possibilities available for morphosyntactic development cross-linguistically. The Akan <b>future</b> <b>tense</b> shows an extremely limited distribution: It may not co-occur with any aspectual marker or with either of the motional prefixes. In the negative, however, it seemingly undergoes a surface morphological alternation with the progressive aspect and also becomes compatible with the Motion prefixes. The combination of progressive aspect and <b>future</b> <b>tense</b> does appear possible in the affirmative, and yet it unexpectedly carries immediate future meaning. Traditionally, all this complexity has been dismissed as allomorphy: Dolphyne (1988, 1996), Boadi (2008), and Osam (2008) have all proposed different descriptions of the tense/aspect system, each without {{analysis of}} the underlying syntactic mechanisms creating the complex distribution of the <b>future</b> <b>tense.</b> Osam (2008) previously noted that the similarity in form between the COME motion prefix b 1 ̆ 00000 E- and the <b>future</b> <b>tense</b> b E-. This, combined with the incompatibility of the <b>future</b> <b>tense</b> and the motion prefixes, points towards a diachronic origin. It will be argued that they also share a synchronic syntactic origin in Mot 0. Kandybowicz (2010) provides the first proof that V-to-T raising does occur in Akan. Once this is established, motional sentences without aspect marking necessarily allow the motion prefix to raise to T 0. The presence of this functional head in a TNON-PAST head creates an epiphenomenal future reading, {{now in the process of}} being reinterpreted as a true <b>future</b> <b>tense.</b> The analogical pressure of an epiphenomenal <b>future</b> <b>tense</b> in the affirmative causes the adoption of a similar strategy for forming the <b>future</b> <b>tense</b> in the negative, namely by reinterpreting the presence of the progressive aspect in TNON-PAST. An {{analysis of the}} Fante <b>future</b> <b>tense</b> as epiphenomenal provides insight into the nature of morphosyntactic change cross-linguistically. In Asante Twi, a larger dialect of Akan, the development of the <b>future</b> <b>tense</b> seems to have gone a step farther, creating a fully-developed bE- TFUTURE. This may be characterized as an example of syntactically-driven morphological change, in which existing syntactic processes create the opportunity for epiphenomenal semantic shift, which in turn drives true morphological change...|$|R
