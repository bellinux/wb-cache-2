40|$|Reported in {{the current}} paper is {{a study of the}} effects of Nitric Oxide (NO) within a {{simulated}} Exhaust Gas Residual (sEGR) on Spark Ignition (SI) engine end gas autoignition. A modified version of the single cylinder Leeds University Ported Optical Engine Version 2 (LUPOE- 2) engine was designed to completely eliminate retained residual gas and so allow unambiguous definition of the composition of the in-cylinder charge. The engine was alternately operated on stoichiometric mixtures of iso-octane, two Primary Reference Fuels (PRF), a Toluene Reference Fuel (TRF), and a commercially available Unleaded Gasoline (ULG) and air. These mixtures were diluted with sEGR (products of the complete stoichiometric combustion of the given fuel/air mixture) in mass fractions ranging from 0 - 15 %; with and without 5000 ppm NO (0. 52 % by mass) within that sEGR. For those fuels exhibiting little or no Negative Temperature Coefficient (NTC) behaviour, NO addition to the sEGR resulted in increased rate of reaction in the end gas and advanced autoignition and thus <b>knock</b> <b>onset.</b> Conversely, autoignition (and thus <b>knock</b> <b>onset)</b> was suppressed with the addition of NO for fuels exhibiting strong NTC characteristics if the cycle unburned pressure/temperature history spent a significant period of time to autoignition in the NTC regime. Ideas relating to the effects of residual gas NO concentration on autoignition, and thus <b>knock</b> <b>onset</b> are subsequently discussed...|$|E

Natural Gas (NG) and Liquefied Petroleum Gas (LPG), thanks to their low cost and low environmental impact represent the best alternative. Bi-fuel engines, which may run either with gasoline or with gas (NG or LPG), widely spread in many countries thanks to their versatility, high efficiency and low pollutant emissions: gas fueled vehicles, as example, are allowed to run in many limited traffic zones. In the last years, supercharged SI engines fueled with either gasoline or gaseous fuel, spread in the market. Thermodynamic simulations, widely used to reduce costs during engine development and optimization process, require proper combustion and <b>knock</b> <b>onset</b> prediction models. In particular the fuel knocking resistance is a crucial issue in supercharged engines development. Starting from these considerations the authors developed and calibrated an original <b>knock</b> <b>onset</b> prediction model for knock-safe performances optimization of engines fueled by gasoline and gaseous fuels. The proposed model, despite its very simple formulation, {{takes into account the}} Negative Temperature Coefficient (NTC) behavior exhibited by many hydrocarbons fuels such as gasoline, propane and methane. The knock prediction model has been calibrated by a great number of light-knocking pressure cycles sampled using a Cooperative Fuel Research (CFR) engine. The engine Compression Ratio (CR), inlet mixture temperature and spark advance have been varied to obtain very different operative conditions for model calibration; as a result the model can be used in the development of different kind of engines, i. e. naturally aspirated or supercharged. Five fuels have been tested: gasoline, LPG, NG, propane and methane. The calibrated model showed a very high reliability with a maximum <b>knock</b> <b>onset</b> prediction error of only 4 crank angle degrees (CAD) and an overall mean absolute error lower than 1 CAD, that are negligible quantities from an engine control point of view...|$|E
40|$|Engine {{downsizing}} with a turbocharger {{has become}} popular {{these days in}} automotive industries. Downsizing the engine lets the engine operate in a more efficient region, and the engine boosting compensates for the power loss accompanied by downsizing. However, the use of high boost in a downsized engine is limited by knock. Changing operating parameters such as spark timing has shown {{to be effective in}} avoiding knock. However, those strategies usually deteriorate efficiency of the engine. Another method to suppress knock without lowering efficiency is to use knock resistant fuels. Among them ethanol has gotten a large attention due to its renewable characteristics. About 13. 3 billion gallons of ethanol were produced in 2012, and about 99 % of them are used as fuel added to gasoline. However, the optimal use of ethanol in a spark ignited engine as a knock suppressing additive is not well quantified. Also, operation limitations of a knock free engine are not well known. The objective of this project was to determine the <b>knock</b> <b>onset</b> engine operating conditions and to explore the potential of a direct injection of ethanol enhanced fuels. An engine with a turbocharger was used to measure efficiencies of the engine over the wide range of operating points. Speed range was chosen from 1500 rpm to 3000 rpm in which vehicle is usually driven in the driving cycle. Then, <b>knock</b> <b>onset</b> of different ethanol-gasoline blends, from 0 % ethanol to 85 % ethanol contents with 91 RON gasoline, were determined. Generated engine fuel consumption maps with <b>knock</b> <b>onset</b> limits were utilized in a vehicle driving simulation tool. In a simulation, the consumption of gasoline and knock suppressing fuels was determined in different driving cycles. Finally, effects of downsizig and spark retard on ethanol fraction in the fuel were determined. by Young Suk Jo. Thesis (S. M.)

40|$|In this work, {{experimental}} data of ignition delay times of n-butanol, gasoline, toluene reference fuel (TRF), a gasoline/n-butanol blend and a TRF/n-butanol blend were obtained using the Leeds University Rapid Compression Machine (RCM) while autoignition (<b>knock)</b> <b>onsets</b> and <b>knock</b> intensities of gasoline, TRF, gasoline/n-butanol and TRF/n-butanol blends were measured using the Leeds University Optical Engine (LUPOE). The work showed {{that within the}} RCM, the 3 -component TRF surrogate captures the trend of gasoline data well across the temperature range. However, based on results obtained in the engine, {{it appears that the}} chosen TRF may not be an excellent representation of gasoline under engine conditions as the knock boundary of TRF as well as the measured <b>knock</b> <b>onsets</b> are significantly lower than those of gasoline. The ignition delay times measured in the RCM for the blend, lay between those of gasoline and n-butanol under stoichiometric conditions across the temperature range studied and at lower temperatures, n-butanol acts as an octane enhancer over and above what might be expected from a simple linear blending law. In the engine, the measured <b>knock</b> <b>onsets</b> for the blend were higher than those of gasoline at the more retarded spark timing of 6 CA bTDC but the effect disappears at higher spark advances. Future studies exploring the blending effect of n-butanol across a range of blending ratios is required since it is difficult to conclude on the overall effect of n-butanol blending on gasoline based on the single blend that has been considered in this study. The chemical kinetic modelling of the fuels investigated has also been evaluated by comparing results from simulations employing the relevant reaction mechanisms with the {{experimental data}} sourced from either the open literature or measured in-house. Local as well as global uncertainty/sensitivity methods accounting for the impact of uncertainties in the input parameters, were also employed within the framework of ignition delay time modelling in an RCM and species concentration prediction in a JSR, for analysis of the chemical kinetic modelling of DME, n-butanol, TRF and TRF/n-butanol oxidation in order to advance the understanding of the key reactions rates that are crucial for the accurate prediction of the combustion of alternative fuels in internal combustion engines. The results showed that uncertainties in predicting key target quantities for the various fuels studied are currently large but driven by few reactions. Further studies of the key reaction channels identified in this work at the P-T conditions of relevance to combustion applications could help to improve current mechanisms. Moreover, the chemical kinetic modelling of the autoignition and species concentration of TRF, TRF/n-butanol and n-butanol fuels was carried out using the adopted TRF/n-butanol mechanism as input in the engine simulations of a recently developed commercial engine software known as LOGEengine. Similar to the results obtained in the RCM modelling work, the <b>knock</b> <b>onsets</b> predicted for TRF and TRF/n-butanol blend under engine conditions were consistently higher than the measured data. Overall, the work demonstrated that accurate representation of the low temperature chemistry in current chemical kinetic models of alternative fuels is very crucial for the accurate description of the chemical processes and autoignition of the end gas in the engine. ...|$|R

40|$|Gaseous fuels, such as Liquefied Petroleum Gas (LPG) and Natural Gas (NG), {{thanks to}} their {{excellent}} mixing capabilities and high knocking resistance, allow complete and cleaner combustion than gasoline in Spark Ignition (SI) engines, resulting in lower pollutant emissions, above all if particulate matter is considered. In previous works [1, 2] the authors proved how the simultaneous combustion of gasoline and gaseous fuel (NG or LPG) may strongly reduce both fuel consumption and pollutant emissions with respect to pure gasoline operation without a significant power loss. These very encouraging results were obtained thanks to the strong knock resistance increase obtained adding gaseous fuel to gasoline, which allowed the use of stoichiometric mixtures and better spark advances, even at full load. The introduction of such a kind of combustion in series production engines would however {{require the use of}} properly calibrated simulation models, capable to adequately predict the performance and efficiency of engines fuelled by gaseous fuel-gasoline mixtures; in particular, specific combustion models are needed, together with reliable <b>knock</b> <b>onset</b> prediction sub-model. The total absence of such sub-models in the scientific literature induced the authors to investigate the knocking resistance of gasoline-propane mixtures and calibrate a proper <b>knock</b> <b>onset</b> prediction sub-model to be implemented in the zero dimensional thermodynamic models usually employed for engine performance optimization. To this purpose several light knocking in-cylinder pressure cycles have been recorded on a CFR engine, fuelled by gasoline, propane and their mixtures, varying the most important knock-related parameters: compression ratio, spark advance, inlet mixture temperature and fuel mixture composition. The collected data have been used to calibrate two different models, compared in terms of <b>knock</b> <b>onset</b> prediction accuracy: the Knock Integral model (KI) and the Ignition Delay model (ID). Both models revealed a good reliability in predicting the onset of knocking phenomena, with maximum errors around 4 crank angle degrees. The Knock Integral model showed a slightly higher accuracy, which, together with its lower computational effort, makes it preferable for the implementation in the commonly employed thermodynamic engine models...|$|E

In order to qualitatively match the cyclic variability of the combustion process, Large-Eddy Simulation (LES) of the closed-valve portion of the cycle is used with cycle-dependent initial conditions from a previous multi-cycle analysis [1, 2, 3]. Detailed chemical modelling of fuel’s auto-ignition quality is considered through an ad-hoc implemented look-up table approach, as a trade-off between the need for a reasonable representation of the chemistry and that of limiting the computational cost of the LES simulations. Experimental tests were conducted operating the engine at knock-limited spark advance (KLSA) and the proposed knock model was previously validated for such engine setup [3]. All the presented calculations are carried out for an increased spark advance (SA) to both promote <b>knock</b> <b>onset</b> over a large set of cases and to assess the modelling framework sensitivity to small variations in engine operations. The analysis of combustion development and <b>knock</b> <b>onset</b> is carried out analysing 20 subsequent engine cycles through POD of both flame front evolution and local autoignition locations. Particularly, phase-dependent three-dimensional POD is implemented over the scalar distributions of progress variable of the chemical reactions and auto-ignition location, estimated based on the work by Lafossas et al. [4]. The method of snapshots introduced by Sirovich is used for POD [5]. The proposed POD analysis is critically discussed in terms of physical soundness, capability to investigate the engine knock-characteristics and applicability to the optimization of the combustion chamber...|$|E

40|$|SI Engine knock {{is caused}} by {{autoignition}} in the unburnt part of the mixture (end-gas) ahead of the propagating flame. Autoignition of the end-gas occurs when the temperature and pressure exceeds a critical limit when comparatively slow reactions - releasing moderate amounts of heat - transform into ignition and rapid heat release. In this paper {{the difference in the}} heat released in the end-gas - by low temperature chemistry - between lean, rich, stochiometric, and stoichiometric mixtures diluted with cooled EGR was examined by measuring the temperature in the end-gas with Dual Broadband Rotational CARS.

40|$|Engine knock is {{emerging}} as the main limiting factor for modern spark-ignition (SI) engines, facing increasing thermal loads and seeking demanding efficiency targets. To fulfill these requirements, the engine operating point must be moved {{as close as possible}} to the onset of abnormal combustion events. The turbulent regime characterizing in-cylinder flows and SI combustion leads to serious fluctuations between consecutive engine cycles. This forces the engine designer to further distance the target condition from its theoretical optimum, in order to prevent abnormal combustion to severely damage the engine components just because of few individual heavy-knocking cycles. A RANS-based model is presented in this study, which is able to predict not only the ensemble average knock occurrence but also a knock probability. This improves the knock tendency characterization, since the mean <b>knock</b> <b>onset</b> alone is a poorly meaningful indication in a stochastic event such as engine knock. The model is based on a look-up table approach from detailed chemistry, coupled with the transport of the variance of both mixture fraction and enthalpy. These perturbations around the ensemble average value are originated by the turbulent time scale. A multivariate cell-based Gaussian-PDF model is proposed for the unburnt mixture, resulting in a statistical distribution for the in-cell reaction rate. An average knock precursor and its variance are independently calculated and transported, and the earliest knock probability is always preceding the ensemble average <b>knock</b> <b>onset,</b> as confirmed by the experimental evidence. This allows to identify not only the regions where the average knock first occurs, but also where the first knock probability is more likely to be encountered. The application of the model to a RANS simulation of a modern turbocharged direct injection (DI) SI engine is presented and a small percentage of knocking cycles is predicted by the model although the average behavior is knock-free, in agreement with the experiments. The estimate of the knocking probability improves the consolidated “average knock” RANS analysis and gives an indication of the statistical knock tendency of the engin...|$|E
40|$|Direct Fuel Injection (DI) extends {{engine knock}} limits {{compared}} to Port Fuel Injection (PFI) by utilizing the in-cylinder charge cooling effect due to fuel evaporation. The use of gasoline/ethanol blends in DI is therefore especially advantageous {{due to the}} high heat of vaporization of ethanol. Additionally ethanol blends also display superior chemical resistance to auto-ignition, therefore allowing the further extension of knock limits. An engine with both DI and port fuel injection (PFI) was used to obtain <b>knock</b> <b>onset</b> limits for five gasoline/ethanol blends and different intake air temperatures. Using PFI as a baseline, the amount the intake air needed to be heated in DI to knock at the same conditions as PFI is the effective charge cooling realized and ranges from ~ 14 °C for gasoline to ~ 49 °C for E 85. The Livengood-Wu auto-ignition integral {{in conjunction with the}} Douad-Eyzat time to auto-ignition correlation was used to predict <b>knock</b> <b>onset.</b> The preexponential factor in the correlation was varied to fit the experimental data. An "Effective Octane Number-ONEFF" is thus obtained for every blend ranging from 97 ONEFF. for gasoline to 115 ONEFF. for E 85. ONEFF. captures the chemistry effect on knock and shows that there is little antiknock benefit beyond 30 - 40 % ethanol by volume unless the fuel is used in a DI engine. Using this approach, the anti-knock benefit of charge cooling can also be quantified as an octane number. To achieve that, the ONEFF. calculated for an actual DI operating point including charge cooling effects is compared to the ONEFF. obtained from the auto-ignition integral if the unburned mixture temperature is offset to cancel the charge cooling out. The resulting increase in ONEFF., which can be viewed as an "Evaporative Octane Number" ranges from 5 ONEFF. for gasoline to 18 ONEFF. for E 85. by Emmanuel P. Kasseris. Thesis (Ph. D.)

40|$|Experiments {{were carried}} out to collect {{in-cylinder}} pressure data and microphone signals from a single-cylinder test engine using spark timings before, at, and after <b>knock</b> <b>onset</b> for four different octane-rated toluene reference fuels. This data was then processed and analyzed in various ways to gain insight into the autoignition phenomena that lead to knock. This was done to develop a more fundamentally based prediction methodology that incorporates both a physical and chemical description of knock. The collected data was also used to develop a method of data processing that would detect knock in real time without {{the need to have}} an operator listening to the engine. Bandpass filters and smoothing techniques were used to process the data. The processed data was then used to determine knock intensities for each cycle for both the cylinder pressure data and microphone signal. Also, the rate of build-up before reaching peak amplitude in a bandpass filtered pressure trace was found. A trend was found showing that cycles with knock intensities greater than 1 bar with rapid build-up (5 - 10 oscillations) before reaching the peak are the type the cycles whose autoignition events lead to engine knock. (cont.) The cylinder pressure knock intensities and microphone knock intensities were plotted and then fit with a linear trendline. The R 2 value for these linear trendlines will transition from considerably lower values to values greater than 0. 85 at the spark timing of <b>knock</b> <b>onset.</b> It is believed that the higher cylinder pressure knock intensities, in conjunction with the faster build-up of 5 - 10 oscillations before reaching peak, helps to explain the knock phenomena. It supports conclusions from previous works that the end gas contains one or more hot spots that autoignite in sequence causing pressure gradients that can trigger rapid pressure oscillations. These pressure oscillations can cause block and head vibrations that lead to audible noise outside the engine. by Bridget M. Revier. Thesis (S. M.)

40|$|In {{the last}} decade, gaseous fuels, such as {{liquefied}} petroleum gas (LPG) and natural gas (NG), widely spread in many countries, thanks to their prerogative of low cost and reduced environmental impact. Hence, bi-fuel engines, which allow to run either with gasoline or with gas (LPG or NG), became very popular. Moreover, as experimentally demonstrated by the authors in the previous works, these engines may also be fueled by a mixture of gasoline and gas, which, due to the high knock resistance of gas, allow to use stoichiometric mixtures also at full load, thus drastically improving engine efficiency and pollutant emissions with respect to pure gasoline operation without noticeable power loss. This third operation mode, called double fuel combustion, can be easily introduced in series production engine, since a simple electronic control unit (ECU) programing is required. The introduction into series production would require the availability of proper models for thermodynamic simulations, nowadays widely adopted to reduce research and development efforts and costs. To this purpose, the authors developed a quite original <b>knock</b> <b>onset</b> prediction model for knock-safe performances optimization of engines fueled by propane, gasoline, and their mixtures. The ignition delay model has been properly modified {{to account for the}} negative temperature coefficient (NTC) behavior exhibited by many hydrocarbon fuels such as gasoline and propane. The model parameters have been tuned by means of a considerable amount of light knocking in-cylinder pressure cycles acquired on a modified cooperative fuel research (CFR) engine, fueled by gasoline-propane mixtures. The adoption of many different compression ratios (CRs), inlet mixture temperatures, spark advances (SAs), and fuel mixture compositions allowed to use a very differentiated set of pressure and temperature curve, which gives the calibrated model a general validity for using different kinds of engines, i. e., naturally aspirated or supercharged. As a result, the model features a maximum <b>knock</b> <b>onset</b> prediction error around four crank angle degrees (CAD) and a mean absolute error always lower than 1 CAD, which is a negligible quantity from an engine control standpoint...|$|E

A new approach of a self controlling variable {{compression ratio}} connecting rod is presented that does not need a friction intensive external activation and that could even be retrofitted. The potential in fuel consumption and exhaust emission reduction as well as increased power and torque output for this concept has been verified in combustion simulations utilizing the latest research results related to the dynamic heat transfer in the combustion chamber from Professor Kleinschmidt from the University of Siegen, Germany. The self controlling variable compression ratio connecting rod allows the con rod to compress at high load conditions thereby increasing cylinder volume to alleviate combustion pressures and temperatures and therefore limit <b>knock</b> <b>onset.</b> The biggest efficiency gains can be achieved at medium load where the reduction of heat loss during the compression of the connecting rod plays a major role additional to the well known efficiency gains of an increased compression ratio.

An Arrhenius type equation with a pressure correction for ignition delay can be found from interpolation of previously published data for any gasoline if its RON and sensitivity are known. Then, if the pressure and temperature in the unburned gas can be estimated or measured, the Livengood-Wu integral can be estimated as a function of crank angle to predict the occurrence of knock. Experiments in a single cylinder DISI engine over a wide operating range confirm that this simple approach can predict knock very accurately.

The simulation is capable of predicting the onset of autoignition without prior knowledge of the cylinder pressure history. Near-wall temperature gradients were computed {{within the framework of}} the engine cycle simulation by dividing the region into a number of thin mass slices which were assumed to remain adjacent to the combustion chamber surfaces in both the burned and unburned gas. The influence of the near-wall turbulence on the temperature field was accounted for by means of a boundary layer turbulence model developed by the authors. Fluid motion in the bulk gases has been considered by the inclusion of the turbulence model based on k-> theory while the flame propagation rate was predicted using a fractal flame model. Validation of the engine-cycle simulation is afforded by comparison of predicted turbulence intensities, gas temperatures, gas-wall interface heat fluxes and pressure histories with appropriate measured values. All showed good agreement. The heat release from the preflame reactions was estimated using the reduced kinetic model and has been accounted for in the overall engine simulation energy balance. The chemical kinetic and engine cycle models were solved simultaneously enabling the simulation of the coupled effects of the heat release by the preflame reactions on the end-gas temperatures and the subsequent influence of these temperatures on the rates of reaction in the end-gas region as combustion proceeds.

Experiments are conducted on a single-cylinder gas engine bounded to combined heat and power (CHP). Effects of spark advance, volumetric efficiency and equivalent ratio are studied under constant speed operation. The ratio IMPO/(MAPO x W) (with IMPO defined as the Integral of Modulus of Pressure Oscillations, MAPO as the Maximum Amplitude of Pressure Oscillations and W as the width of the computational window) is proposed as suitable indice. In any engine setting, it remains constant under no knocking conditions. When knock occurs, a model deduced from dimensionless analysis allows determination of the oversteps of Knock Limited Spark Advance from a single IMPO/(MAPO x W) measurement with an accuracy better than 1 CA. Knock is then studied for different gas qualities by adding propane or carbon dioxide to the fuel. The results show that there is no significant effect of the fuel composition on the proposed indicator, making the model able to calculate KLSA overstep in all the situations.

European manufacturers are all involved in the effort of improving fuel economy, at least at some engine operating points while meeting, of course, the pollutant emission standards. The EGR technique, since a long time adopted in reducing the NOx formation rate, could be an effective system for fuel economy improvement. Mainly, a de-throttle effect and decreased heat losses to the walls can be obtained in this way. Furthermore, lower exhaust gas temperatures can be reached thus avoiding damages to the noble metals of catalytic converters. In this paper, the EGR technique has been widely investigated by carrying out an experimental analysis of a small, naturally aspirated, spark-ignition engine.

40|$|Avoiding knock is {{the major}} design {{constraint}} for spark ignition engines because of the unacceptable noise and engine damage associated with it. Hence, the Research and Motor Octane Number (RON and MON) tests were established in 1928 such that a fuel with a higher RON and MON {{is less likely to}} knock than a fuel with a lower value. However, engine and fuel technology has evolved since 1928, and thus the relevancy of these tests for modem engines needed to be evaluated. First, the study compared <b>knock</b> <b>onset,</b> knock metrics, reference fuels, and test conditions for the octane tests to those in modem engines. The results showed that in modem engines, for a given RON, fuels with lower MON values performed better than fuels with higher values, and this trend becomes stronger when engines are boosted and intercooled. Second, detailed chemical kinetics models were used to study fuel autoignition phenomena leading to knocking conditions. These models showed that the fuel autoignition chemistry in modem engine is different from that in the RON and MON tests. Based on these results, it was concluded that the RON and MON tests no longer represent modem engine operating conditions; therefore, modifications are suggested and evaluated to improve the tests' applicability. by Vikram Mittal.

40|$|International audienceHighly boosted spark {{ignition}} (SI) engines {{are more and}} more attractive for car manufacturers in terms of efficiency and CO 2 emissions. However, thermodynamic conditions encountered in these engines promote the occurrence of abnormal combustions like knock or super-knock, which are experimentally difficult to analyse due to the risks of engine damages. The Reynolds averaged Navier–Stokes (RANS) method mainly used in industry for piston engines is not the most appropriate as knock does not always affect the mean cyclecaptured by RANS. Using an accurate LES compressible code and improved versions of ECFM-LES (Extended Coherent Flame Model) and TKI (Tabulated Kinetics of Ignition) models allowing a full uncoupling of flame propagation and auto-ignition reaction rates, this work demonstrates {{for the first time that}} LES is able to describe quantitatively knocking combustion in a realistic SI engine configuration. Contrary to previous studies (Fontanesi et al., 2013 [5]) (Lecocq et al., 2011 [4]), a quantified knock analysis is conducted based on a specific post-processing of both numerical and experimental data. LES is able to predict the in-cylinder pressure variability, the knock occurrence frequency and the mean <b>knock</b> <b>onset</b> crank angle for several spark timings. A 3 D analysis also demonstrates that knock occurs at random locations, mainly at the exhaust valves side. Knock intensity is found proportional to the fresh gases mass burned by autoignition at low knock intensities, while an exponential increase at the highest intensities suggests the influence of additional factors like the knock location in the cylinder or complex behaviour of knocking combustion...|$|E
40|$|Cycle-to-cycle {{variability}} is numerically simulated for high-speed, full-load {{operation of}} a turbocharged gasoline direct injection engine. Large-Eddy simulation is adopted to replicate the fluctuations of the flow field affecting the turbulent combustion. Experimental data were provided at <b>knock</b> <b>onset,</b> and large-Eddy simulation was validated for the same condition. In the original engine configuration, the spark plug is displaced toward the exhaust side, while the electrodes orientation is arbitrary. A 90 rotation is imposed to evaluate {{the effects of the}} aerodynamic obstruction caused by the electrode with respect to the flow field and the flame kernel growth. A second speculative analysis is performed modifying the position of the spark plug. The electrodes are shifted 2 mm toward the intake side since this variation is compatible with the cylinder head layout. For both variations in orientation and position, the effects on the flow field around the spark plug are investigated. Statistical analysis is carried out on early flame kernel formation and knock tendency. The results highlight that the orientation of the electrodes affects the flow field for each cycle but plays a negligible role on the statistical cyclic variability, indirectly justifying the lack of an imposed orientation. As for the spark plug position, the numerical analysis indicate that the shifting of the electrodes toward the intake side slightly improves the knock limit mainly because of a reduction in in-cylinder peak pressure. In general, it is inferred that improvements may be achieved only through a simultaneous modification of the fuel jet orientation and phasing...|$|E
40|$|The use of {{methanol}} and ethanol {{in internal}} combustion engines forms an interesting approach to decarbonizing transport and securing domestic energy supply. The physico-chemical properties of these fuels enable engines with increased performance and efficiency {{compared to their}} fossil fuel counterparts. The development of alcohol-fuelled engines has been mainly experimental up till now. The application of an engine cycle code valid for these fuels could help to unlock their full potential. For this reason, our research group decided to extend its in-house engine code to alcohols. This paper discusses the requirements {{for the construction of}} a two-zone thermodynamic model that can predict the power cycle, pollutant emissions and <b>knock</b> <b>onset</b> in alcohol engines. We reviewed the properties of alcohol fuels and their use in dedicated engine technology. From this information we identified the characteristics relevant to combustion engines and defined the areas the model should cover in terms of cylinder pressure, temperature, residual gas fraction, etc. Next, we investigated which building blocks of the current model will need adaptations. For the laminar burning velocity of alcohol-air mixtures, our literature review revealed a lack of data at engine-like conditions. Upon inspection of the pollutant formation models, we found that special attention should be paid to the formation of aldehydes and selected a suitable formation model. Finally we decided that a knock prediction model based on a one-step Arrhenius-type autoignition reaction is best suited for our purpose. Future work will further focus on each of these building blocks separately in order to come to a comprehensive model for the combustion of alcohols in spark-ignition engines...|$|E
40|$|The paper {{reports the}} {{application}} of a look-up table approach within a LES combustion modelling framework for the prediction of knock limit in a highly downsized turbocharged DISI engine. During experimental investigations at the engine test bed, high cycle-to-cycle variability was detected even for relatively stable peak power / full load operations of the engine, where <b>knock</b> <b>onset</b> severely limited the overall engine performance. In order to overcome the excessive computational cost of a direct chemical solution within a LES framework, the use of look-up tables for auto-ignition modelling perfectly fits with the strict mesh requirements of a LES simulation, with an acceptable approximation of the actual chemical kinetics. The model here presented is a totally stand-alone tool for autoignition analysis integrated with look-up table reading from detailed chemical kinetic schemes for gasoline. The look-up table access is provided by a multi-linear interpolating routine internally developed at the “Gruppo Motori (GruMo) ” of the University of Modena and Reggio Emilia. As the experimental tests were conducted operating the engine at knock-limited spark advance, the tool is at first validated for three different LES cycles in terms of knock tolerance, i. e. the safety margin to knock occurrence. As a second stage, the validation of the methodology is performed for discrete spark advance increases in order to assess the sensitivity of the modelling strategy to variations in engine operations. A detailed analysis of the unburnt gas physical state is performed which confirms the knock-limited condition suggested by the experimental tests...|$|E
40|$|AbstractThe recent rise in fuel prices, {{the need}} both to reduce ground transport-generated {{emissions}} (increasingly constrained by legislation) {{and to improve}} urban air quality have brought fuel-efficient, low-emissions powertrain technologies {{at the top of}} vehicle manufacturers’ and policy makers’ agenda. To these aims, engine design is now oriented towards the adoption of the so-called downsizing and down-speeding techniques, while preserving the performance target. Therefore, brake mean effective pressure is markedly increasing, leading to increased risks of <b>knock</b> <b>onset</b> and abnormal combustions in last-generation SI engines. To counterbalance the increased risks of pre-ignition, knock or mega-knock, currently made turbocharged SI engines usually operate with high fuel enrichments and delayed (sometimes negative) spark advances. The former is responsible for high fuel consumption levels, while the latter induce an even lower A/F ratio (below 11), to limit the turbine inlet temperature, with huge negative effects on BSFC. Possible solutions to increase knock resistance are investigated in the paper by means of 3 D-CFD analyses: water, water/methanol emulsion and methanol are port-fuel injected to replace mixture enrichment while preserving, if not improving, indicated mean effective pressure and knock safety margins. The aim of the work is therefore the replacement of the gasoline-only rich mixture with a global stoichiometric one while avoiding power loss and improving fuel consumption. In order to maintain the same knock tendency, water, methanol or a mixture of the two is then added in the intake port to keep the same charge cooling of the original rich mixture.

40|$|Gaseous fuels, such as {{liquefied}} {{petroleum gas}} (LPG) and natural gas (NG), thanks to their good mixing capabilities, allow complete and cleaner combustion than gasoline in spark ignition (SI) engines, resulting in lower pollutant emissions and particulate matter. In a previous work the authors showed that the simultaneous combustion of gasoline and LPG improves an SI engine efficiency with respect to pure gasoline operation with any significant power loss. The addition of LPG to the gasoline-air mixture produces an increase in knock resistance that allows running the engine at full load with overall stoichiometric mixture and better spark advance. In order to predict both performance and efficiency of engines fed by LPG-gasoline mixtures, a specific combustion model and in particular a knock prediction sub-model is required. Due {{to the lack of}} literature works about this matter, the authors investigated the knock resistance of LPG-gasoline mixtures. As a result, a reliable knock prediction sub-model has been obtained. The model can be easily implemented in thermodynamic simulations for a knock-safe engine performance optimization. The authors recorded light knocking in-cylinder pressure cycles on a cooperative fuel research (CFR) engine fueled by LPG-gasoline mixtures in different proportions. The tests were performed varying the compression ratio, the spark advance, and the inlet mixture temperature. The collected data have been used to calibrate and then compare two classical knock-prediction models. The models have been calibrated with a heterogeneous set of experimental data in order to predict knock occurrence in SI engines of different kinds. The results show that the models predict the <b>knock</b> <b>onset</b> position with a maximum error of around 6 crank angle degrees (CAD) ...|$|E

40|$|Variable {{compression}} {{engines are}} a mean {{to meet the}} demand on lower fuel consumption. A high compression ratio results in high engine efficiency, but also increases the knock tendency. On conventional engines with fixed compression ratio, knock is avoided by retarding the ignition angle. The variable compression engine offers an extra dimension in knock control, since both ignition angle and compression ratio can be adjusted. The central question is thus for what combination of compression ratio and ignition angle the maximum efficiency is achieved, considering the set of compression ratios and ignition angles that give a sufficiently low knock intensity. Four knock detection methods are proposed, compared and evaluated with respect to robustness for noise and choices of parameter values. Three of the knock detectors are categorised as on-line, and are designed for giving feedback about knock occurrence to the engine control unit. The methods can determine both whether or not knock is present and the crank angle at <b>knock</b> <b>onset.</b> A study of the relationship between knock oscillation properties and knock-onset is performed. It is concluded that the logarithm of the normalised knock energy depends almost linearly on the rate of knock occurrence. A new formulation of multi-zone engine models is presented. The formulation makes it easy to increase or decrease the number of zones during the simulation. One of many possible applications is the investigation of engine efficiency. An analysis of experimental data shows how the engine efficiency changes with compression ratio and ignition angle. An engine torque model is developed and validated, from which the optimal choice of compression ratio and ignition angle can be calculated with high accuracy...|$|E
40|$|The {{increasing}} {{limitations in}} engine emissions and fuel consumption have led researchers {{to the need}} to accurately predict combustion and related events in gasoline engines. In particular, knock {{is one of the most}} limiting factors for modern SI units, severely hindering thermal efficiency improvements. Modern CFD simulations are becoming an affordable instrument to support experimental practice from the early design to the detailed calibration stage. To this aim, combustion and knock models in RANS formalism provide good time-to-solution trade-off allowing to simulate mean flame front propagation and flame brush geometry, as well as “ensemble average” knock tendency in end-gases. Still, the level of confidence in the use of CFD tools strongly relies on the possibility to validate models and methodologies against experimental measurements. In the paper, two sets of cycle-resolved flame visualizations are available from a single-cylinder 400 cm 3 direct-injection spark-ignition (DISI) unit with optical access. The engine is operated at two spark timings, ranging from knock-safe to light-knock conditions. On this basis, a numerical analysis is carried out to reproduce flame kernel growth and propagation using the well-known ECFM- 3 Z combustion model for all the operating conditions. CFD results are compared in terms of enflamed volume and flame morphology against cycle averaged experimental data. In addition, average knock is simulated by means of the in-house built UniMORE Knock Model [1] in terms of <b>knock</b> <b>onset</b> location and phasing. The agreement between predicted and measured position of the flame front and knock inception location for the two different operating conditions confirms the validity of the adopted models and proves their predictive capability for engine design and optimizatio...|$|E
40|$|In {{the last}} years new and stricter {{pollutant}} emission regulations together with raised cost of conventional fuels resulted in an increased use of gaseous fuels, such as Natural Gas (NG) or Liquefied Petroleum Gas (LPG), for passenger vehicles. Bi-fuel engines represent a transition phase product, allowing to run either with gasoline or with gas, {{and for this reason}} are equipped with two separate injection systems. When operating at high loads with gasoline, however, these engines require rich mixtures and retarded combustions in order to prevent from dangerous knocking phenomena: this causes high hydrocarbon (HC) and carbon monoxide (CO) emissions together with high fuel consumption. With the aim to exploit the high knock resistance of NG maintaining the good performances of gasoline, the authors experienced, in a previous work [1], the simultaneous combustion of NG-gasoline mixtures on a series production Spark Ignition (SI) engine, obtaining, with respect to pure gasoline operation, strong reduction in pollutant emissions, noticeable efficiency increase and no significant power losses. In order to ascertain the knock resistance increase due to the addition of natural gas to gasoline, and given the total absence of such information in the scientific literature, the authors decided to carry out a dedicated experimental campaign: a standard Cooperative Fuel Research (CFR) engine, properly upgraded to inject both fuels in the intake duct, has been employed to determine the Motor Octane Number (MON) of several fuel mixtures following the ASTM Standard D 2700. The results showed a non-linear relation between mixture knock resistance and natural gas concentration, correctly interpolated by a polynomial law. The correlation found can be usefully implemented in <b>knock</b> <b>onset</b> prediction sub-models for thermodynamic engine simulation, or used in future works involving the simultaneous combustion of natural gas and gasoline in a SI engine...|$|E
40|$|The {{following}} pages describe the experimentation {{and analysis of}} two different fuels in GM's high compression ratio, turbocharged direct injection (TDI) engine. The focus is on a burn rate analysis for the fuels - gasoline and E 85 - at varying intake air temperatures. The results are aimed at aiding in a subsequent study that {{will look at the}} benefits of direct injection in turbocharged engines, ethanol's knock suppression properties, and the effects of ethanol concentration in gasoline/ethanol blends. Spark sweeps were performed for each fuel/temperature combination to find the knock limit and to assess each fuels' sensitivity to spark timing and temperature. The findings were that E 85 has lower sensitivity to spark timing in terms of NIMEP loss for deviation from MBT timing. A 5 % loss in NIMEP was seen at 3 ° of spark advance or retard for gasoline, whereas E 85 took 5 ' to realize the same drop in NIMEP. Gasoline was also much more sensitive to intake air temperature changes than E 85. Increasing the intake air temperature for gasoline decreased the peak pressure, however, <b>knock</b> <b>onset</b> began earlier for the higher temperatures, indicating that end-gas autoignition is more dependent on temperature than pressure. E 85 's peak pressure sensitivity to spark timing was found to be about 50 % lower than that of gasoline and it displayed much higher knock resistance, not knocking until the intake air temperature was 130 °C with spark timing of 30 ° bTDC. These results give some insight into the effectiveness of ethanol to improve gasoline's anti-knock index. Future experiments will aim to quantify charge cooling and anti-knock properties, and determine how ethanol concentration in gasoline/ethanol blends effects this knock suppression ability. by Justin E.

40|$|In {{the recent}} past engine knock {{emerged as one of}} the main {{limiting}} aspects for the achievement of higher efficiency targets in modern spark-ignition (SI) engines. To attain these requirements, engine operating points must be moved as close as possible to the onset of abnormal combustions, although the turbulent nature of flow field and SI combustion leads to possibly ample fluctuations between consecutive engine cycles. This forces engine designers to distance the target condition from its theoretical optimum in order to prevent abnormal combustion, which can potentially damage engine components because of few individual heavy-knocking cycles. A statistically based RANS knock model is presented in this study, whose aim is the prediction not only of the ensemble average knock occurrence, poorly meaningful in such a stochastic event, but also of a knock probability. The model is based on look-up tables of autoignition times from detailed chemistry, coupled with transport equations for the variance of mixture fraction and enthalpy. The transported perturbations around the ensemble average value are based on variable gradients and on a local turbulent time scale. A multi-variate cell-based Gaussian-PDF model is proposed for the unburnt mixture, resulting in a statistical distribution for the in-cell reaction rate. An average knock precursor and its variance are independently calculated and transported; this results in the prediction of an earliest knock probability preceding the ensemble average <b>knock</b> <b>onset,</b> as confirmed by the experimental evidence. The proposed model estimates not only the regions where the average knock is promoted, but also where and when the first knock is more likely to be encountered. The application of the model to a RANS simulation of a modern turbocharged direct injection (DI) SI engine with optical access is presented and the analysis of the knock statistical occurrence obtained by the proposed model adds an innovative contribution to overcome the limitation of consolidated “average knock” analyses typical of a RANS approach...|$|E
40|$|Experiments to {{identify}} the knock trends of lean gasoline-air mixtures, and such mixtures enhanced with hydrogen (H 2) and carbon monoxide (CO), were performed on a single-cylinder research engine with boosting capability. The experimental method used to investigate knock trends consisted of determining the octane number (ON) of the primary reference fuel (mixture of isooctane and n-heptane) supplied to the engine that just produced audible knock. All tests were completed at 1500 rpm, MBT spark timing, with coolant temperature at fully warmed-up conditions and intake air temperature at 200 C. Various relative air-fuel ratio (lambda) sweeps were performed, while holding different parameters constant. First, testing with primary reference fuels investigated knock limits of lean operation; selected tests were then repeated with H 2 and CO-enhancement. These mixtures simulated 15 % and 30 % of the engine's gasoline being reformed in a plasmatron fuel. reformer. Experimental results show that leaner operation does not decrease the knock tendency of an engine under conditions where a fixed output torque is maintained; rather it slightly increases the octane requirement. The onset of knock does decrease with lean operation when the intake pressure is held constant, but engine torque is then reduced. When H 2 and CO {{are added to the}} mixture, the knock susceptibility is reduced, as illustrated by a decrease in the measured octane number of the primary reference fuel resulting in knock. Experiments conducted with the addition of H 2 show similar trends, but to a lesser degree. Therefore, both H 2 and CO act as octane enhancers when added to a hydrocarbon-air mixture. The extent to which H 2 and CO improve the knock resistance of a mixture can be estimated by finding the bond-weighted octane number for the mixture of fuels. To substantiate these. results, a chemical kinetic ignition model was used to predict autoigntion of the end-gas for various conditions and fuel-air mixtures. Predicted model trends of <b>knock</b> <b>onset</b> partially agree with experimental observations. A comprehensive isooctane chemistry mechanism was used to demonstrate that H 2 and CO-enhancement are effective in lengthening the ignition delay, and thereby reduce knock tendency. by Jennifer A.
