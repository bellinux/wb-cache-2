25|$|Transport {{from the}} {{economic}} centre of Shire Highlands to river ports was by inefficient and costly <b>head</b> <b>porter,</b> and low water levels in the rivers made water transport difficult. Sharrer took the initiative in proposing {{the construction of a}} railway to the most suitable river port, Chiromo and the prospectus for the Shire Highlands Railway Company Ltd was published in December 1895. As Sharrer had acquired much of the land over which the proposed railway was to run, there was disagreement over the route, particularly from the African Lakes Company. Because of this and delays over raising capital and loans for construction, and it was not until early 1903 that construction work began. Sharrer became a director of the Shire Highlands Railway Company Ltd and continued as such after he left the protectorate, and was also a director of the Central Africa Railway Company Ltd which was built after his departure.|$|E
40|$|The {{implementation}} of neoliberal economic reforms with its resultant effects on rural agricultural economies has facilitated {{the migration of}} young girls from northern to southern Ghana to seek for alternative livelihoods in the urban informal economy as <b>head</b> <b>porters</b> (Kayayei). Using semistructured questionnaires and interviews with 45 Kayayei in Makola and Agbogbloshie Markets, Accra,this study examines how migration as a livelihood strategy contributes to an improvement in the living conditions of young girls and their families. The paper also looks more closely into the pathways through which the livelihoods of these young female migrants may contribute to local economic development. The study highlights that Kayayei contribute to local economic development through market exchangeand revenue generation, also there is significant perceived positive impact of <b>head</b> <b>portering</b> on standard of living of these young girls through improved access to income, health care and asset accumulation while their families benefit from remittances. The study concludes by advocating for {{the need to provide}} access to credit and skills training in enhancing the livelihood of Kayayei...|$|R

40|$|Over {{the last}} three decades or so, complex factors {{including}} the implementation of neoliberal economic reforms has led to a decline in formal sector employment in the Ghanaian economy. This together with increasing feminization of poverty has driven many, especially young women, to seek livelihoods in the informal sector mainly as hawkers and <b>head</b> <b>porters.</b> Drawing on qualitative interviews with approximately 40 urban poor women (aged 6 - 25 years), this paper reports the gendered aspects of poverty and the surviving strategies of young women on urban streets. The cameos presented herein highlight the experiences of poverty among street workers and how their livelihood portfolios contribute to overcoming the poor socio-economic conditions facing them. The paper shows that hawking and <b>head</b> <b>portering</b> significantly provides income for upkeep of young women and their families through meeting consumption and other needs. However, vulnerabilities manifested in unfavourable weather conditions, vehicular dangers, exploitation from employers and customers often due to lack of written work contracts are the major risks sturdily connected with these surviving strategies. The paper concludes by arguing for policy interventions such as subsidized credit schemes and organization of formal and informal forms of capacity building for the urban street workers to enhance their livelihoods...|$|R
500|$|George Criticos {{served as}} <b>head</b> <b>porter</b> of the Ritz for 45 years, {{retiring}} in 1960 for health reasons; {{he had been}} recommended for {{a job at the}} Ritz by Sir Basil Zaharoff. In his 1959 book, George of the Ritz, Criticos remembered some of the notable people and events during his years of service. [...] Criticos once acted as an agent to the Aga Kahn at the racetrack, having been given US$45,000 by the monarch to place bets in his name. [...] He was also asked to take the 18-year-old Prince Aly Khan on a monthlong tour of the United States to help the young man forget a failed romance. [...] When Criticos saw an unshaven man in coveralls entering the hotel, he called out to the man to stop him. [...] When the man turned to face Criticos, he recognised him as King Boris of Bulgaria, who was a railroad buff and was returning from driving a special train.|$|E

6000|$|Presently {{we heard}} that the <b>head</b> <b>porter</b> at Maynard's had left, and that William was <b>head</b> <b>porter</b> at twenty-three shillings a week.

6000|$|A {{little while}} later and another owl began to hoot in the distance, whereat the three <b>head</b> <b>porters</b> nudged each other. Perhaps {{they had heard}} such owls hoot before at night, and perhaps they knew that Jeekie, who had [...] "passed Bonsa," [...] could only be harmed by the direct command of Bonsa {{speaking}} through {{the mouth of the}} Asika herself. Still they might have been interested in the nocturnal conversation of those two owls, which, as is common with such magical fowl in West Africa, had transformed themselves into human shapes, the shape of Jeekie and the shape of an Asiki priest, who was, as it happened, a blood relation of Jeekie.|$|R
60|$|Outside of {{it three}} of the <b>head</b> <b>porters,</b> who {{appeared}} to be friends of his, were waiting for him, and with these men he engaged in low and earnest conversation. Next, after they had arrived at some agreement, which they seemed to ratify by a curious oath that involved their crossing and clasping hands in an odd fashion, and other symbols known to West African secret societies, Jeekie went the round of the camp to see that everyone was at his post. Then he did what most people would have thought a very curious and strange thing, namely climbed the fence and vanished into the forest, where presently a sound was heard as of an owl hooting.|$|R

60|$|Then an owl hooted again {{immediately}} {{beneath the}} fence and Jeekie, blowing out the candle, opened the flap of the tent and tapped the <b>head</b> <b>porter,</b> who stood outside, on the shoulder. He crept in and between them they lifted the senseless Aylward and bore him to the V-shaped entrance of the boma which was immediately opposite to the tent and, oddly enough, half open. Here the two other porters with whom Jeekie had performed some ceremony, chanced to be on guard, {{the rest of their}} company being stationed at a distance. Jeekie and the <b>head</b> <b>porter</b> went through the gap like men carrying a corpse to midnight burial, and presently in the darkness without two owls began to hoot.|$|E

60|$|The <b>head</b> <b>porter,</b> moreover, {{was filled}} with a virtuous resolve to break the record as a {{lightning}} packer and make up for lost time. Mr. Swaffenham, of the Sandgate Riviera, for example, who was going out to dinner that night at seven, received at half-past six, instead of the urgently needed dress shirt he expected, a corset specially adapted to the needs of persons inclined to embonpoint. A parcel of summer underclothing selected by the elder Miss Waldershawe, was somehow distributed in the form of gratis additions throughout a number of parcels of a less intimate nature, and a box of millinery on approval to Lady Pamshort (at Wampachs) was enriched by the addition of the junior porter's cap....|$|E

Nearly every important act of her life had been precipitate. But she was conscious in this instance of no regret. Delay, she felt, would have killed her. Let her exile begin at once.|$|E
60|$|When {{we got on}} {{the street}} where the Babylon Hotel was he whipped up his horses so that they went almost on a run, and the horner blew his horn until his eyes seemed bursting, and with a grand sweep and a clank and a jingle we pulled up {{at the front of the}} big hotel.

The men in the red coats looked disappointed when they saw we had no baggage, but the great doors was flung open and we went straight up to the clerk's desk.|$|E
