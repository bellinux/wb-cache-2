40|$|The text of {{this paper}} has passed across many Internet routers {{on its way to}} the reader, but some routers will not pass it along {{unfettered}} because of censored words it contains. We present two sets of results: 1) Internet measurements of keyword filtering by the Great “Firewall ” of China (GFC); and 2) initial results of using latent semantic analysis as an efficient way to reproduce a blacklist of censored words via probing. Our Internet measurements suggest that the GFC’s keyword filtering is more a panopticon than a firewall, i. e., it need not block every illicit word, but only enough to promote self-censorship. China’s largest ISP, ChinaNET, performed 83. 3 % of all filtering of our probes, and 99. 1 % of all filtering that occurred at the first hop past the Chinese border. Filtering occurred beyond the third hop for 11. 8 % of our probes, and there were sometimes as many as 13 hops past the border to a <b>filtering</b> <b>router.</b> Approximately 28. 3 % of the Chinese hosts we sent probes to were reachable along paths that were not filtered at all. While more tests are needed to provide a definitive picture of the GFC’s implementation, our results disprove the notion that GFC keyword filtering is a firewall strictly at the border of China’s Internet. While evading a firewall a single time defeats its purpose, it would be necessary to evade a panopticon almost every time. Thus, in lieu of evasion, we propose ConceptDoppler, an architectur...|$|E

40|$|Abstract—Distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks {{continue}} to pose an important challenge to current networks. DDoS attacks can cause victim resource consumption and link congestion. A filter-based DDoS defense is considered {{as an effective}} approach, since it can defend against both attacks: victim resource consumption and link congestion. However, existing filter-based approaches do not address necessary properties for viable DDoS solutions: how to practically identify attack paths, how to propagate filters to the best locations (<b>filter</b> <b>routers),</b> and how to manage many filters to maximize the defense effectiveness. We propose a novel mechanism, termed PFS (Probabilistic Filter Scheduling), to efficiently defeat DDoS attacks and to satisfy the necessary properties. In PFS, <b>filter</b> <b>routers</b> identify attack paths using probabilistic packet marking, and maintain filters using aschedulingpolicytomaximizethedefenseeffectiveness.

40|$|The {{end-to-end}} {{availability of}} Internet services is {{between two and}} three orders of magnitude worse than other important engineered systems, including the US airline system, the 911 emergency response system, and the US public telephone system. This dissertation explores three systems designed to mask Internet failures, and, through a study of three years of data collected on a 31 -site testbed, why these failures happen and how effectively they can be masked. A core aspect {{of many of the}} failures that interrupt end-to-end communication is that they fall outside the expected domain of well-behaved network failures. Many traditional techniques cope with link and router failures; as a result, the remaining failures are those caused by software and hardware bugs, misconfiguration, malice, or the inability of current routing systems to cope with persistent congestion. The effects of these failures are exacerbated because Internet services depend upon the proper functioning of many components—wide-area routing, access links, the domain name system, and the servers themselves—and a failure in any of them can prove disastrous to the proper functioning of the service. This dissertation describes three complementary systems to increase Internet availability {{in the face of such}} failures. Each system builds upon the idea of an overlay network, a network created dynamically between a group of cooperating Internet hosts. The first two systems, Resilient Overlay Networks (RON) and Multi-homed Overlay Networks (MONET) determine whether the Internet path between two hosts is working on an end-to-end basis. Both systems exploit the considerable redundancy available in the underlying Internet to find failure-disjoint paths between nodes, and forward traffic along a working path. RON is able to avoid 50 % of the Internet outages that interrupt communication between a small group of communicating nodes. MONET is more aggressive, combining an overlay network of Web proxies with explicitly engineered redundant links to the Internet to also mask client access link failures. Eighteen months of measurements from a six-site deployment of MONET show that it increases a client’s ability to access working Web sites by nearly an order of magnitude. Where RON and MONET combat accidental failures, the Mayday system guards against denialof- service attacks by surrounding a vulnerable Internet server with a ring of <b>filtering</b> <b>routers.</b> Mayday then uses a set of overlay nodes to act as mediators between the service and its clients, permitting only properly authenticated traffic to reach the server...|$|R
