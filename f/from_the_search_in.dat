40|$|This thesis {{examines}} <b>search</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> physical world, which differs significantly <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>searches</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> digital {{world that}} we perform every day on our computers. When <b>searching</b> <b>the</b> internet, for instance, success {{is a matter of}} informed indexing that allows the information to be retrieved quickly. In these cases, there is no consideration of the physical nature of the world, and <b>the</b> <b>search</b> is not cognizant of space, time, or traversal distance. <b>In</b> contrast, <b>search</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> physical world must consider a target that could be continuously moving, possibly even trying to evade being found. The environment may be partially known, and <b>the</b> <b>search</b> proceeds with information gathered during <b>the</b> <b>search</b> itself. <b>In</b> many cases, such as guaranteeing capture of an adversarial target, the problem cannot be solved with a single searcher, and all group members must coordinate their actions with others on the team. Prior work has explored limited instances of such problems, but existing techniques either scale poorly or do not have performance guarantees.

30|$|To {{overcome}} the drawback of the greedy scheduler in [9] and to guarantee full fairness to all users, we propose {{in this paper}} to use opportunistic round robin (ORR) scheduling. In addition, we compare the performance of greedy and ORR scheduling schemes. We demonstrate the fundamental trade-off between performance and fairness in multiuser scheduling. The greedy scheme selects the best user without considering fairness among users. On the other hand, the ORR algorithm selects the best user first based on a scheduling criterion, then this selected user will be excluded <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>search</b> <b>in</b> the next round until all users are served. The result of this work shows that the ORR scheduler provides SNR gains compared to round robin scheduling while still providing full fairness to all users.|$|E
40|$|Objective: to {{identify}} research linking premature birth with prenatal care, reflecting this relationship through the writings of Canguilhem. Method: integrative review of literature <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>search</b> <b>in</b> the databases available on the Virtual Health Library, in the period from 2007 to 2011, with final selection of six manuscripts. Results: the relationship between premature birth and prenatal care refers to the insufficient number of prenatal visits, the absence or insufficient quality of care. Prematurity and prenatal care {{should be considered as}} a single whole, with consideration of the expanded concept of care that extends the biological paradigm to the subjectivity of the subjects. Conclusion: based on the concepts of normal and pathological, is expected to contribute to change the focus of health professionals, from pregnancy to the mother, not belittling clinical and biological aspects, but considering the woman in her uniqueness, subjectivity and insertion in the social context...|$|E
40|$|Molecular {{dynamics}} (MD) {{simulations of}} proteins in a lipid bilayer environment are usually undertaken {{with one or}} a few starting structures. Here we report a search protocol for systematically exploring the possible interactions in helical bundle transmembrane proteins, a frequently occurring structural motif. The search protocol correctly identifies the experimentally known structure of the dimeric human glycophorin A transmembrane domain as the lowest energy structure among five different models without any prior assumptions, whilst an identical in vacuo search fails to identify the correct structure. The lowest energy structure <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>search</b> <b>in</b> a lipid bilayer has a root mean square deviation of 1. 1 Å to the experimental structure. We have applied the same search protocol to the unknown transmembrane structure of the oncogenic mutant ErbB- 2 protein, {{a member of the family}} of epidermal growth factor receptors. Resulting structures show the role of glutamic acid hydrogen bonding and close helical packing. Water molecules may also play a key role in stabilisation of the transmembrane helix association...|$|E

30|$|In {{order to}} {{retrieve}} the primary studies containing OSS quality models we made use of Scopus digital library. It indexes several renowned scientific journals, books and conference proceedings (e.g. IEEE, ACM, Science Direct and Springer). We considered only papers from (2003 to 2015) since the first OSS quality model emerged in 2003 (Haaland et al. 2010; Adewumi et al. 2013). We also focused on journal papers and conference proceedings in the subject area of Computer Science that were written in English. A total of 3198 primary studies were initially retrieved. After checking through their titles and abstracts, the number was reduced to 209. To be sure that no paper had been left out, we also performed a search in IEEE Explore, ACM and Springer using the same search string. No new papers were retrieved from this search that had not already been seen <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>search</b> <b>in</b> Scopus. Furthermore, a search was performed using Google Search and two relevant articles were retrieved (Duijnhouwer and Widdows 2003; Atos 2006) and added to make a total of 211 retrieved papers. These papers were read in detail to determine their suitability for inclusion.|$|E
40|$|Many factors {{influence}} visual search, {{including how}} much targets stand out (i. e., their visual salience) {{and whether they}} are currently relevant (i. e., Are they in working memory?). Although these are two known influences on search performance, {{it is unclear how}} they interact to guide attention. The present study explored this interplay by having participants hold an item in memory for a subsequent test while simultaneously conducting a multiple-target visual search. Importantly, the memory item could match one or neither of two targets <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>search.</b> <b>In</b> Experiment 1, when the memory item did not match either target, participants found a high-salience target first, demonstrating a baseline salience effect. This effect was exaggerated when a high-salience target was in working memory and completely reversed when a low-salience target was in memory, demonstrating a powerful influence of working memory guidance. Experiment 2 amplified the salience effect by including very high-salience, “pop-out”-like targets. Yet this salience effect was still attenuated when the memory item matched a less salient target. Experiment 3 confirmed these were memory-based effects and not priming. Collectively, these findings illustrate the influential role of working memory in guiding visual attention, {{even in the face of}} competing bottom-up salience cues...|$|E
40|$|Background: The inequitable {{distribution}} of health professionals, {{within and between}} countries, poses an important obstacle to the achievement of optimal attainable health for all. Objectives: To assess the effectiveness of interventions aimed at increasing the proportion of health professionals working in rural and other underserved areas. Search strategy: We searched the specialised register of the Cochrane Effective Practice andOrganisation of Care Group (up to July 2007), the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) and the Database of Abstracts of Reviews of Effectiveness (up to July 2007), MEDLINE (1966 to July 2007), EMBASE (1988 to July 2007), CINAHL (1982 to July 2007) and LILACS (up to July 2007). We also searched reference lists of all papers and relevant reviews identified, and contacted authors of relevant papers regarding any further published or unpublished work. Selection criteria: Randomised controlled trials, controlled trials (not strictly randomised), controlled before-after studies and interrupted time series studies evaluating the effects of various interventions (e. g. educational, financial or regulatory strategies) on the recruitment and/or retention of health professionals in under-served areas. Data collection and analysis: Two reviewers independently screened titles and abstracts obtained <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>search</b> <b>in</b> order to identify potentially relevant studies. Main result: No studies met the inclusion criteria. Authors' conclusions: There are no studies in which bias and confounding are minimised to support any of the interventions that have been implemented to address the inequitable {{distribution of}} health care professionals. Well-designed {{studies are needed to}} confirm or refute findings of various observational studies regarding educational, financial, regulatory and supportive interventions that may influence health care professionals' choice to practice in underserved areas. Governments and educators should ensure that where interventions are implemented this is done {{within the context of a}} well-planned study so that the true effects of these measures on recruitment and long term retention can be determined in various settings.
