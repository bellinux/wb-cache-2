The use of parts of endangered species (such as seahorses, rhinoceros horns, binturong and tiger bones and claws) has created controversy and resulted in a black market of poachers.

40|$|Abstract The University of Hong Kong’s {{statement}} on vision now has three themes: 1) Research, 2) teaching & learning, and 3) knowledge exchange (KE). KE emphasizes HKU’s desire {{to interact with}} its community for a mutual benefit. A new five-year strategic plan (2009 – 2014) sets out operational priorities and key indicators to enable knowledge exchange at HKU. Chief among these is {{the establishment of an}} exchange hub to make HKU researchers and their research products highly visible. The institutional repository of HKU, the HKU Scholars Hub, developed by its University Libraries, has become this KE exchange hub. Now the Hub includes HKU ResearcherPages, featuring the accomplish-ments of each HKU professoriate staff. HKU’s policy on knowledge exchange and the HKU ResearcherPages have increased the incentive for faculties, departments, and authors to place more <b>items</b> <b>in</b> <b>open</b> access (OA).

40|$|Open {{access is}} defined, and {{explored}} {{in the context}} of enclosure and emancipatory communication. One attempt at enclosure, in the form of heavy lobbying by very wealthy companies in the publishing industry against research funders' open access mandates, has been exposed. A PR message is traced from the recommendations of PR pitbull Eric Dezenhall to a failed anti-OA coalition attempt called PRISM to the White House. In spite of this intense lobbying, open access is succeeding. Resources are growing dramatically; the Directory of Open Access Journals, a list of fully open access, peer-reviewed journals, lists more than 2, 800 journals, more than 10 % of the world's peer-reviewed journals, and is adding titles at a rate of more than one per calendar day. There are more than 16 million <b>items</b> <b>in</b> <b>open</b> access archives, retrievable through portals such as Scientific Commons or OAIster. Despite heavy lobbying, the US Senate recently voted heavily in favor of language to change the National Institutes of Health Public Access policy from an ineffective request to a requirement.

However, all qualitative studies identified by the review were lacking in quality, transparency and/or richness. It is recommended that further research be conducted which utilise qualitative methodologies involving rigorous and transparent processes...|$|R

40|$|Differential {{predation}} risk between habitats, or 'the {{landscape of}} fear', can have profound impacts on foraging strategies of prey. Few studies, however, {{have described the}} landscape of fear in the wild, in relation to predator densities. Using giving-up density experiments, and vertebrate surveys, we described the landscape of fear for two rodent species in relation to actual predator abundances in a tropical savannah. We offered native eastern chestnut mice, Pseudomys gracilicaudatus, and introduced house mice, Mus musculus domesticus, food <b>in</b> the <b>open,</b> and {{under the cover of}} grass. When eastern brown snakes, Pseudonaja textilis, were absent, both eastern chestnut and house mice consumed more food <b>items</b> under grass. <b>In</b> habitats where snakes were abundant, however, eastern chestnut mice changed their foraging behaviour, and consumed more food <b>items</b> <b>in</b> the <b>open</b> than under grass. In contrast, non-native house mice reduced their foraging activity under cover, but showed no increase in foraging <b>in</b> the <b>open</b> <b>in</b> the presence of snakes. Thus, native eastern chestnut mice have the ability to change their foraging tactics to adjust their antipredator behaviour to remain successful in the presence of native eastern brown snakes, whereas introduced house mice did not exhibit this behaviour...|$|R

25|$|Since TCM recognizes bear bile as a medicinal, {{more than}} 12,000 asiatic black bears {{are held in}} bear farms. The bile is {{extracted}} through a permanent hole in the abdomen leading to the gall bladder, which can cause severe pain. This can lead to bears trying to kill themselves. As of 2012, approximately 10,000 bears are farmed in China for their bile. This practice has spurred public outcry across the country. The bile is collected from live bears via a surgical procedure. The deer penis {{is believed to have}} therapeutic benefits according to traditional Chinese medicine. It is typically very big and, proponents believe, in order to preserve its properties, it should be extracted from a living deer. Medicinal tiger parts from poached animals include tiger penis, believed to improve virility, and tiger eyes. The illegal trade for tiger parts in China has driven the species to near-extinction because of its popularity in traditional medicine. Laws protecting even critically endangered species such as the Sumatran tiger fail to stop the display and sale of these <b>items</b> <b>in</b> <b>open</b> markets. Shark fin soup is traditionally regarded in Chinese medicine as beneficial for health in East Asia, and its status as an elite dish has led to huge demand with the increase of affluence in China, devastating shark populations. The shark fins {{have been a part of}} traditional Chinese medicine for centuries. Shark finning is banned in many countries, but the trade is thriving in Hong Kong and China, where the fins are part of shark fin soup, a dish considered a delicacy, and used in some types of traditional Chinese medicine.|$|R
