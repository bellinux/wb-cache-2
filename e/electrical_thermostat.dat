40|$|A new TI wall system {{combining}} {{the advantages of}} transparent and opaque insulation for buildings is being investigated. This concept uses free air convection within vertical gaps between the TIM, the opaque insulation material, and the building wall for heat transfer. Overheating during high solar irradiation periods can be avoided by opening a shutter and directing the hot air stream out of the facade. A 5. 9 mhigh 2 TI facade of this type was constructed on a test building at the ISE test site in Freiburg. The building is equipped with an <b>electrical</b> <b>thermostat</b> heater to keep the room temperature constant. Solar irradiation, wall heat fluxes and temperatures are measured. Special points of interest are the heat transfer coefficients due to free convection, and the protection against overheating...|$|E

50|$|Since 1979 the Convention on Long-range Transboundary Air Pollution has {{addressed}} {{some of the}} major environmental problems of the UNECE region through scientific collaboration and policy negotiation. The Convention has been extended by eight protocols that identify specific measures to be taken by Parties to cut their emissions of air pollutants.The Executive Body adopted the Protocol on Heavy Metals on 24 June 1998 in Aarhus (Denmark). It targets three particularly harmful metals: cadmium, lead and mercury. According to one of the basic obligations, Parties will have to reduce their emissions for these three metals below their levels in 1990 (or an alternative year between 1985 and 1995). The Protocol aims to cut emissions from industrial sources (iron and steel industry, non-ferrous metal industry), combustion processes (power generation, road transport) and waste incineration. It lays down stringent limit values for emissions from stationary sources and suggests best available techniques (BAT) for these sources, such as special filters or scrubbers for combustion sources or mercury-free processes. The Protocol requires Parties to phase out leaded petrol. It also introduces measures to lower heavy metal emissions from other products, such as mercury in batteries, and proposes the introduction of management measures for other mercury-containing products, such as <b>electrical</b> components (<b>thermostats,</b> switches), measuring devices (thermometers, manometers, barometers), fluorescent lamps, dental amalgam, pesticides and paint.|$|R
50|$|Due to {{its unique}} properties, mercury {{has been used}} in various {{products}} and processes for hundreds of years. Currently, it is mostly utilised in industrial processes that produce chlorine (mercury chlor-alkali plants) or vinyl chloride monomer for polyvinyl chloride (PVC) production, and polyurethane elastomers. It is extensively used to extract gold from ore in artisanal and small-scale gold mining. It is contained in products such as <b>electrical</b> switches (including <b>thermostats),</b> relays, measuring and control equipment, energy-efficient fluorescent light bulbs, batteries and dental amalgam. It is also used in laboratories, cosmetics, pharmaceuticals, including in vaccines as a preservative, paints, and jewellery. Mercury is also released unintentionally from some industrial processes, such as coal-fired power and heat generation, cement production, mining and other metallurgic activities such as non-ferrous metals production, as well as from incineration of many types of waste.|$|R
40|$|The Velocity Control Propulsion Subsystem (VCPS) was {{designed}} the propulsion required for trajectory and lunar orbit corrections of the spacecraft. A GFE clamp assembly physically attaches the VCPS to the spacecraft and {{the unit is}} ejected after completing the required corrections. The VCPS is physically and functionally separated from the spacecraft except for the electrical and telemetry interfaces. A GFE transtage provides the superstructure on which the VCPS is assembled. The subsystem consists of two 5 foot pound rocket engine assemblies, 4 propellant tanks, 2 latching valves, 2 fill and drain valves, a system filter, pressure transducer, gas and propellant manifolds and <b>electrical</b> heaters and <b>thermostats.</b> The RAE-B VCPS program covered the design, manufacture and qualification of one subsystem. This subsystem was to be manufactured, subjected to qualification tests; and refurbished, if necessary, prior to flight. The VCPS design and test program precluded the need for refurbishing the subsystem and the unit was delivered to GSFC {{at the conclusion of}} the program...|$|R
40|$|Johnson Controls is {{a global}} company, founded in 1885. The company was started by Mr. Warren Johnson when he invented the first <b>electrical</b> room <b>thermostat.</b> Nowadays Johnson Controls is a diverse {{technology}} and industrial leader. The company has 162, 000 employees and makes a yearly revenue of 40. 5 billion US$. Due to energy efficiency retrofit projects the company has reduced more than 9. 8 million tons of CO² emission since 2000. Johnson Controls {{is made up of}} three distinct divisions: Building Efficiency, Power Solutions and Automotive Experience. The JCI UK Slough office where this study was carried out, is part of the Building Efficiency division. This department deals with intelligent HVAC controls: controlling heating and cooling plants, air handling units and energy release elements. All of these a building the ideal living environment. Since Johnson Controls is a large company, every process the company undertakes is written down in a BOS "Business Operating System Manual". In this manual you can find the procedure of processes of Johnson Controls. These processes are similar for {{every country in the world}} that JCI is active in, so as to keep the Johnson Controls quality at the same ISO 9001 quality standard all over the world. The problem with the manual is that it is comprehensive and takes some time to navigate to the relative part you require. The project at Johnson Controls is to deliver a quick and easy electronic document, relevant to the systems business UK for approval and to be successfully embedded in the business processes. The general purpose of the generated flowcharts is to facilitate and promote those internal processes used by the employees and managers. The applied procedures are achieved by interviewing employees and managers of multiple departments. The outcome of the interviews is to provide a profound view on how processes are executed in real life. The generated flowcharts were adapted in consultation with the managing staff to be in accordance with the required JCI standards. In order to check the generated flowcharts within the real project environment, it is best to gain hands-on experience in as many of the processes involved. Therefore I spent time working on a number of real projects such as Cisco, Camden and EBC Cisco. This involved on-site working at Cisco Bedford Lakes and some on-site software programming work...|$|R
40|$|This {{fact sheet}} is {{designed}} to increase the primary care provider’s knowledge of environmental elemental (metallic) mercury exposure, and {{to aid in the}} clinical evaluation and treatment of patients who have been exposed to elemental mercury. Elemental Mercury The elemental (metallic) form of mercury is a heavy, silver- gray liquid that volatilizes slowly at room temperature. Elemental mercury, also known as quicksilver, poses a negligible risk of severe toxicity after a single ingestion dose. However, mercury vapors are readily absorbed when inhaled and mercury is rapidly distributed through the body, including the central nervous system and the placenta. Exposures can result in central nervous system and renal toxicity which may be insidious in onset and non-specific. Possible Exposure Sources • Improper clean-up (vacuuming) of broken mercury-containing household items (thermometers, <b>thermostats,</b> <b>electrical</b> switches, compact fluorescent light bulbs) • Recent application of mercury-containing paint or caulk • Occupation and hobbies of home occupants • Recent move to a residence contaminated with mercury by previous tenant • Use of folk remedies • Use of elemental mercury in a school laboratory • Misuse of mercury by collecting large quantities and using it for recreational activities • Mercury containing sphygmomanometers and thermometers in your office Signs, Symptoms and Health Effects Signs, symptoms and health effects from elemental mercury exposure will vary based on concentration of exposure, route of exposure, duration of exposure as well as individual susceptibility. Acute Inhalation (High Dose) Inhalation of high concentrations of elemental mercury vapor may rapidly produce cough, dyspnea, chest pain, nausea, vomiting, stomatitis, diarrhea, fever, and a metallic taste in the mouth. Later, interstitial pneumonitis, necrotizing bronchiolitis, and pulmonary edema may develop. Children less than 30 months of age appear to be at increased risk for pulmonary toxicity, usually following an incident of mercury vaporization in the home. Renal manifestations include proteinuria, acute tubular necrosis, and oliguric renal failure. Conjunctivitis and an erythematous, pruritic rash have been reported with relatively mild exposure to mercury vapor...|$|R
