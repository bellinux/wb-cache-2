40|$|The Erie {{doctrine}} requires <b>federal</b> <b>courts</b> {{sitting in}} diversity jurisdiction to apply state substantive law if applying federal law {{would change the}} outcome of the case. If statutory interpretation methodologies affect the outcomes of cases and state courts give them stare decisis effect, does Erie require <b>federal</b> <b>courts</b> to use state interpretation methodologies when applying state substantive law? This Note examines whether <b>federal</b> <b>courts</b> are already applying state interpretation methodologies when they interpret state statutes by examining state statutory interpretation cases heard in Michigan <b>federal</b> <b>courts</b> interpreting Michigan statutes. This Note examines Michigan state cases because its supreme court established a distinct statutory interpretation methodology that it uses as precedent for all cases. For the most part, <b>federal</b> <b>courts</b> do not appear to use Michigan statutory interpretation techniques when they interpret Michigan law. Instead, they use a variety of inconsistent tests. This Note argues that a better approach would be for the <b>federal</b> <b>courts</b> to apply Erie to statutory interpretation and use state interpretation methods to interpret state statutes. This Note adds to the current statutory interpretation literature by examining how lower <b>federal</b> <b>courts</b> interpret <b>federal</b> and state statutes and investigating whether they treat both sets differently. Because more than 99 percent of statutory interpretation cases do not reach the U. S. Supreme Court, how lower courts interpret statutes matters for case outcomes and for litigants gauging their likelihood of success...|$|R

40|$|Thesis (Ph. D.) [...] University of Washington, 2012 What {{explains}} variation {{over the}} issues <b>federal</b> <b>courts</b> examine over time? Adopting an interbranch approach, I {{argue that this}} variation {{is a function of}} changes in rules of access. Rules of access govern whether litigants can use the <b>federal</b> <b>courts</b> and are set by both lawmakers and judges. I focus on two rules of access - jurisdiction and standing. During the legislative process, lawmakers decide how to grant policy-making authority to <b>federal</b> <b>courts</b> through rules of access. Open access encourages litigants to use the <b>federal</b> <b>courts.</b> These decisions create statutory environments that shape the federal courts' agendas. I examine how Congress varies jurisdiction and standing. Using original data of Public Laws that grant jurisdiction to the <b>federal</b> district <b>courts</b> and Public Laws that confer standing on potential litigants, I explain how rules of access for the <b>federal</b> <b>courts</b> have changed over time and across policy issues. I present a theory that links changes in rules of access to the courts' agendas in that Congress makes antecedent decisions that influence which issues are presented to the <b>federal</b> <b>courts.</b> I employ both quantitative and qualitative methods to demonstrate the relationship between rules of access and judicial agendas...|$|R

5|$|According to Australian court documents, on 10 January 2006, the Šibenik County Court {{ordered that}} a warrant be issued for Vasiljković's arrest.

40|$|This Article explores, and {{ultimately}} embraces, a new {{exception to the}} complete diversity rule in removal cases: the doctrine of procedural misjoinder. We argue that the doctrine offers <b>federal</b> <b>courts</b> a vital tool with which to police joinder gamesmanship. Absent this power, plaintiffs may preclude defendant access to <b>federal</b> <b>courts</b> by the relatively simple expedient of joining in state court largely unrelated claims against or on behalf of non-diverse parties. The resulting lawsuit thus fails the complete diversity test, rendering such cases removal-proof. Like fraudulent joinder, the long-standing practice of ignoring non-diverse parties against whom no valid claim may be asserted, the doctrine of procedural misjoinder would permit <b>federal</b> <b>courts</b> to disregard any diversity-destroying parties who have been improperly added to the state lawsuit. Because access to <b>federal</b> <b>courts</b> is at stake, we believe <b>federal</b> <b>courts</b> should adopt this new doctrine, applying federal joinder standards to test the legitimacy of plaintiffs’ party alignments before denying removal jurisdiction...|$|R
