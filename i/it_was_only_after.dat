5|$|<b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>only</b> <b>after</b> Svyatoslav's {{death in}} late 1076 that Izyaslav {{was able to}} recover the status of Grand Prince. Vsevolod, who had {{previously}} fought against him, was appointed Prince of Chernigov and thus heir to the Kievan throne, explaining perhaps Vsevolod's lack of opposition. The Poles were persuaded by the papacy to give Izyaslav assistance recovering his kingdom, and on July 15, 1077, Izyaslav re-entered Kiev.|$|E

5|$|To avoid {{identification}} with her former family or with Mormonism, Ina's mother reverted to using her maiden name, Coolbrith. The family resolved {{not to speak}} of their Mormon past, and <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>only</b> <b>after</b> Ina Coolbrith's death that the general public learned of her origin. Coolbrith did keep in touch with her Smith relations, however, including a lifelong correspondence with her first-cousin Joseph F.

5|$|When Carpathia {{arrived at}} Pier54 in New York {{on the evening}} of 18April after a {{difficult}} voyage through pack ice, fog, thunderstorms and rough seas, some 40,000people were standing on the wharves, alerted to the disaster by a stream of radio messages from Carpathia and other ships. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>only</b> <b>after</b> Carpathia docked– three days after Titanics sinking– that the full scope of the disaster became public knowledge.|$|E
5|$|After Shirley had {{returned}} home that afternoon, the mob, which had seized another naval officer and several petty officers, {{returned to his}} house. Shirley ordered a number of armed men who were protecting his house to fire at the mob, but William Pepperrell was able to stop Shirley's men from firing and to persuade the mob to leave. In the meantime, Commodore Knowles threatened to bombard Boston with his squadron. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>only</b> <b>after</b> the Massachusetts Council adopted resolutions {{in support of the}} demands of the mob that the situation became quieter in Boston. The mob eventually released its hostages and Knowles released the impressed seamen.|$|E
5|$|After {{the split}} with I-35, the Kansas Turnpike {{continues}} northeast as I-335. However, its exits are numbered as if I-35 had continued along it. This highway exists entirely {{as a part}} of the Kansas Turnpike. In fact, until 1987, this stretch of the turnpike was designated solely as the Kansas Turnpike without an Interstate number. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>only</b> <b>after</b> a change in the National Maximum Speed Law, when state legislators were given the authority to raise the speed limits on rural Interstate Highways to , that this segment of the Kansas Turnpike was given the I-335 designation so that it could fall under the new law.|$|E

5|$|Akshaya Tritya is {{considered}} holy and supremely auspicious by Jains. It {{is believed that}} Rishabhanatha took his first ahara (alms) after becoming an ascetic on this day. Rishabhanatha, Jains believe, was the first monk of the present half cycle of time (avasarpini). Therefore, people {{did not know how}} to offer food (ahara) to monks. King Shreyansa of Hastinapur offered sugarcane juice (ikshu-rasa) to Rishabhanatha. Jains attach great importance to this day as <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>only</b> <b>after</b> one year that Rishabhanatha was offered food. The day is celebrated in the Jain tradition on the third day of the bright fortnight of the month Vaishaka (usually April).|$|E
5|$|Around {{this time}} he adopted his famous style of dressing, {{consisting}} of a knee-length one-piece Kafni robe and a cloth cap. Ramgir Bua, a devotee, testified that Sai Baba was dressed like an athlete and sported 'long hair flowing down {{to the end of}} his spine' when he arrived in Shirdi, and that he never had his head shaved. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>only</b> <b>after</b> Baba forfeited a wrestling match with one Mohiddin Tamboli that he took up the kafni and cloth cap, articles of typical Sufi clothing. This attire contributed to Baba's identification as a Muslim fakir and was a reason for initial indifference and hostility against him in a predominantly Hindu village.|$|E
5|$|Fukuda's {{training}} method consisted mostly {{of the student}} taking fall after fall for the teacher or senior student until he began to understand {{the mechanics of the}} technique. Fukuda stressed applied technique over ritual form. He gave beginners a short description of the technique and had them engage in free practice (randori) in order to teach through experience. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>only</b> <b>after</b> the student had attained some proficiency that he taught them traditional forms (kata). This method was difficult, as there were no special mats for falling, only the standard straw mats (tatami) laid over wooden floors.|$|E

5|$|Furthermore, it {{was found}} that the {{handling}} of armoured forces during the campaign left much to be desired. During the beginning of Guderian's attack in northern Poland, his corps was held back to coordinate with infantry for quite a while, preventing a faster advance. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>only</b> <b>after</b> Army Group South had its attention taken from Warsaw at the Battle of Bzura that Guderian's armour was fully unleashed. There were still lingering tendencies to reserve Germany's armour, even if in independent divisions, to cover an infantry advance or the flanks of advancing infantry armies. Although tank production was increased to 125 tanks per month after the Polish Campaign, losses forced the Germans to draw further strength from Czech tank designs, and light tanks continued to form the majority of Germany's armored strength.|$|E
5|$|He {{attended}} Columbia University, {{where he}} received a Bachelor of Arts degree in mathematics in 1945 and, eleven years later, his PhD in economics in 1956. The delay in receiving his PhD was {{due in part to}} conflict with his advisor, Joseph Dorfman, and in part to Arthur Burns rejecting his doctoral dissertation. Burns was a longtime friend of the Rothbard family and their neighbor at their Manhattan apartment building. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>only</b> <b>after</b> Burns went on leave from the Columbia faculty to head President Eisenhower's Council of Economic Advisors that Rothbard's thesis was accepted and he received his doctorate. Rothbard later stated that all of his fellow students there were extreme leftists and {{that he was one of}} only two Republicans on the Columbia campus at the time.|$|E
5|$|Immigrant {{communities}} {{first developed}} in the riverside settlements. From the Tudor era until the 20th century, ships' crews were employed on a casual basis. New and replacement crew would be found wherever they were available, local sailors being particularly prized for their knowledge of currents and hazards in foreign ports. Crews would be paid off {{at the end of}} their voyage. Inevitably, permanent communities became established, including colonies of Lascars and Africans from the Guinea Coast. Large Chinatowns at both Shadwell and Limehouse developed, associated with the crews of merchantmen in the opium and tea trades. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>only</b> <b>after</b> the devastation of the Second World War that this predominantly Han Chinese community relocated to Soho.|$|E

5|$|In April 1321 the French Dominican friar Jordanus Catalani of Severac (in {{south-western}} France) {{landed at}} Thana {{with four other}} friars. He then travelled to Bhatkal in North Canara, a port town on the coastal route from Thana to Quilon. Being the first bishop of India and the Quilon Diocese, he was entrusted the spiritual nourishment of Christian community in Mangalore {{and other parts of}} India by Pope John XXII. According to historian Severine Silva, no concrete evidence has yet been found that there were any permanent settlements of Christians in South Canara before the 16th century. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>only</b> <b>after</b> the advent of the Portuguese in the region that Christianity began to spread.|$|E
5|$|<b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>only</b> <b>after</b> {{the death}} of Ibn Killis in 991, that Mufarrij was {{able to return to}} Palestine. Ibn Killis had {{remained}} implacably opposed to Mufarrij, whom he regarded a dangerous individual: even on his deathbed, the vizier had urged al-Aziz to have Mufarrij executed should he fall into Fatimid hands, but in the event, the Caliph gave the Jarrahid a full pardon. In 992 al-Aziz invited Mufarrij to participate in the campaign against Aleppo under the Turkish general Manjutakin, but it is unclear whether Mufarrij fought in this or the subsequent campaigns, as he is not mentioned again until 996.|$|E
5|$|Khalid {{utilized}} {{his better}} understanding of terrain in every possible way to gain strategic superiority over his enemies. During his Persian campaigns, he initially never entered deep into Persian territory and always kept the Arabian desert at his rear, allowing his forces to retreat there {{in case of a}} defeat. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>only</b> <b>after</b> all the strong Persian and Persian-allied forces were routed that he penetrated deep into Euphrates region and captured the regional capital of Iraq, Al-Hira. Again, at Yarmouk, the terrain would help him in executing his grand strategy of annihilating the Byzantines.|$|E

The group made appearances at Rocking Kolonia Festival in Maastricht in 1992, Pukkelpop in 1992, Transmusicales in 1992, A Campingflight to Lowlands Paradise in 1993, and the Reading Festival in 1993. They also recorded a John Peel session on September 2, 1993 and a Black Session on February 25, 1994.|$|E
5|$|On {{the seventh}} day after the person had died, people celebrated the sjaund (the word both for the funeral ale and the feast, since it {{involved}} a ritual drinking).
