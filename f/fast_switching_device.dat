However, the on-resistance of SiC power MOSFETs is almost {{the same as that}} of Si IGBTs, which is much higher than the calculated value. This is caused by the low channel mobility due to high interface trap density. Large improvement of channel mobility is expected for SiC power MOSFETs with low on-resistance. We have already reported that the inversion channel mobility of 4 H-SiC MOSFETs fabricated on the C(000 _, 1) face was 72 cm 2 /Vs, which is higher than the Si(0001) face. In this paper, we have investigated the effects of gate-oxidation temperature and H 2 post oxidation annealing on the Dit of n-type MOS capacitors and the inversion channel mobility of 4 H-SiC MOSFETs fabricated on the C(000 _, 1) face. The Dit is reduced and the inversion channel mobility is improved as the gate-oxidation temperature decreases. The inversion channel mobility of 4 H-SiC MOSFETs with the gate-oxide film grown at 900 °C is 118 cm 2 /Vs. Furthermore, using H 2 POA, we have succeeded in the inversion channel mobility as high as 127 cm 2 /Vs.

SiC power MOSFETs are {{expected}} to be normally-off type <b>fast</b> <b>switching</b> <b>devices.</b> The on-resistance of SiC power MOSFETs is much higher than the value predicted from the physical properties of SiC.

Titanium dioxide was successfully doped layer-by-layer with two metal ions, namely tungsten and cobalt. The time-resolved data demonstrate clearly that the carrier trapping time decreases progressively as the doping concentration increases.

In addition, solid-state devices are considered environmental friendly, since they do not contain nasty gases and toxic materials used in old devices. The power level requirements and switching frequency are continually increasing in the power electronic industry, and this demands larger and <b>faster</b> <b>switching</b> <b>devices.</b> As a result, both bipolar and unipolar {{semiconductor devices}} have undergone continued improvement in current and voltage ratings, and switching speed. The main advantage of bipolar devices is their low conduction losses due to conductivity modulation, but their main disadvantage is the high switching losses which is due to minority carrier injection. The Insulated Gate Bipolar Transistor (IGBT) combines the advantages of both unipolar and bipolar devices. It has a simple gate drive circuit like that of the MOSFET, with high current and low saturation voltage capability of bipolar transistor.

It is only possible by breaking with tradition and taking an innovative, comprehensive approach including development of dedicated semiconductor devices and packaging concepts. Innovative solutions are needed to meet these challenges. The requirements for increased power density and very high, short time overload currents demand semiconductor switches capable of operating reliably at junction temperatures exceeding the industrial standard of 150 oC. In order to minimize the conduction losses the voltage drop across the switch during its on-state must be reduced. Consequently, the interconnection resistance contribution to the power losses becomes more significant {{and needs to be}} addressed on the device as well as the package levels. Switching losses are the second most important contributor to the power converter losses. <b>Fast</b> <b>switching</b> <b>devices</b> are required. The challenge is to achieve low switching losses without generating excessive voltage overshoots, ringing and exceeding the EMI limits. Table 1 : Status and Approximate Technical Targets for power Electronics International Rectifier embarked on this road by developing a complete, innovative, automotive high power semiconductor platform called CooliR ™ starting with the development of large IGBTs (CooliRIGBT™) and matching diodes (CooliRDiode™) optimized for application in automotive traction inverters. In order to enable full utilization of these devices, IR is also developing complementary, innovative high power packaging platform including half-bridge modules (CooliR 2 Bridge™) with dual-sided cooling capability...|$|R
