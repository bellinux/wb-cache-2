5|$|Carney {{arrived as}} U.S. Ambassador to Haiti on January 14, 1998. At {{the time of}} his appointment, Haiti was in {{political}} turmoil: former president, Jean-Bertrande Aristide, was locked in a battle to retake power in the election of 2000. Upon arrival in Haiti, Carney laid out U.S. concerns—lack of governance, lack of economic sustainability programs and an inability to prevent narco-trafficking through Haiti as the first port of call by the Cali <b>drug</b> <b>cartels</b> from Colombia.|$|E

5|$|In interrogation, Wexler, {{a former}} Stasi colonel, {{explains}} to Salinger that the IBBC is practically untouchable {{because of its}} utility to terrorist organizations, <b>drug</b> <b>cartels,</b> governments, and powerful corporations of all complexions. Even if he succeeds in bringing the IBBC down {{there are hundreds of}} other banks which will replace them. If Salinger wants justice, he needs to go outside the system, and Wexler indicates a willingness to help. In Italy, Salinger tells the Calvini brothers of the IBBC's responsibility for their father's murder, prompting them to cancel the deal with the bank and have White killed.|$|E
5|$|In 2008, Gorrostieta Salazar {{was elected}} mayor of Tiquicheo. Several drug {{trafficking}} organizations, particularly the La Familia Michoacana and the Knights Templar Cartel, {{are based in}} the area. Michoacán is a leading producer of marijuana and opium poppy, making it a lucrative route for smugglers taking narcotics into the United States. Despite receiving threats, Gorrostieta Salazar publicly denounced the activities of these groups. The <b>drug</b> <b>cartels,</b> which are constantly fighting each other for territorial control, often target mayors who confront them. Other mayors, however, are corrupted and bribed by the cartels. Mexico has more than 2,500 municipalities, {{many of which are}} far from the capital cities and lack amenities available {{in other parts of the}} country. Many of these areas are plagued with drug-related violence, so the political parties have faced difficulties finding people interested in holding the post of mayor.|$|E
5|$|Noriega began {{supplying}} {{weapons to}} the M-19 rebel group in Colombia in 1981. On one occasion, the PDF supplied weapons to {{a small band of}} M-19 fighters who flew to Panama from Cuba, before an attack on Colombia's west coast. According to some reports, the M-19 also asked Noriega to mediate their negotiations with Columbian <b>drug</b> <b>cartels</b> in February 1982. A 1990 book discussing Noriega's administration stated that he had sold 5000 Panamanian passports to the Cuban government for use by its intelligence services. Noriega's direct involvement in moving weapons and drugs declined in the early 1980s; instead, he invested in legal businesses, and used these as a cover for money laundering operations, much of which were related to the drug trade. The U.S. intelligence service believed Noriega to have amassed a personal fortune in European banks {{as a result of his}} illegal activities, as well as owning two homes in Panama and one in France.|$|E

25|$|Currently, the Mexican <b>drug</b> <b>cartels</b> {{already have}} a {{presence}} in most major U.S. cities. In 2009, the Justice Department reported that Mexican <b>drug</b> <b>cartels</b> distribute drugs in nearly 200 cities across the United States, including Los Angeles, Chicago and Atlanta. Gang-related activity and violence has increased along the U.S. Southwest border region, as US-based gangs act as enforcers for Mexican <b>drug</b> <b>cartels.</b>|$|E
25|$|It is {{estimated}} that 20% – 30% of measured GDP represents the hidden economy. Within the Trinidadian and Tobagonian business structure illicit activities and licit activities work side by side, with many business and political organisations being funded by institutionalised drug smugglers. Within Trinidad and Tobago {{there are two main}} <b>drug</b> <b>cartels,</b> the Syrian/Lebanese <b>drug</b> <b>cartels</b> and the Indo Trinidadian <b>drug</b> <b>cartels.</b> The Syrian Lebanese <b>drug</b> <b>cartels</b> are the longest tenured drug cartel on the islands, having ridden the wave of cocaine exportation from the 1970s to the current day. The Syrian <b>Drug</b> <b>Cartels</b> control the vast sway of financing and business interest on the island and exhibit monopolistic tendencies which limit free market policies in insurance, health, finance, heavy and light manufacturing, and land distribution.|$|E
25|$|Calderón's {{government}} also ordered massive raids on <b>drug</b> <b>cartels</b> upon assuming office in December 2006 {{in response to}} an increasingly deadly spate of violence {{in his home state of}} Michoacán.

25|$|<b>Drug</b> <b>cartels</b> are a {{major concern}} in Mexico. Mexico's drug war has left over 60,000 dead and perhaps another 20,000 missing.

25|$|In 2012 it was {{reported}} that Mexican <b>drug</b> <b>cartels</b> had joined forces with the Sicilian Mafia, when Italian officials unearthed information that Palermo’s black market, along with other Italian ports, was being used by Mexico’s <b>drug</b> <b>cartels</b> as a conduit to bring drugs to the European market, in which they had been trafficking drugs, particularly cocaine, throughout the Atlantic Ocean for over 10 years to Europe.|$|E

25|$|Since {{harassment}} neutralized many of {{the traditional}} media outlets, anonymous blogs like Blog del Narco took {{on the role of}} reporting on events related to the drug war. The <b>drug</b> <b>cartels</b> responded by murdering bloggers and social media users.

25|$|Although Mexican <b>drug</b> <b>cartels,</b> or drug {{trafficking}} organizations, have existed for several decades, their influence has increased since {{the demise of}} the Colombian Cali and Medellín cartels in the 1990s. Mexican <b>drug</b> <b>cartels</b> now dominate the wholesale illicit drug market and in 2007 controlled 90% of the cocaine entering the United States. Arrests of key cartel leaders, particularly in the Tijuana and Gulf cartels, has led to increasing drug violence as cartels fight for control of the trafficking routes into the United States.|$|E

25|$|The {{drug control}} {{policies}} Mexico has adopted to prevent drug trafficking and {{to eliminate the}} power of the <b>drug</b> <b>cartels</b> have adversely affected the human rights situation in the country. These policies have given the responsibilities for civilian drug control to the military, which has the power to not only carry out anti-drug and public security operations but also enact policy. According to the United States Department of State, the police and the military in Mexico were accused of committing serious human rights violations as they carried out government efforts to combat <b>drug</b> <b>cartels.</b>|$|E
25|$|Despite drug {{legislation}} (or {{perhaps because}} of it), large, organized criminal <b>drug</b> <b>cartels</b> operate worldwide. Advocates of decriminalization argue that drug prohibition makes drug dealing a lucrative business, leading {{to much of the}} associated criminal activity.|$|E
25|$|Paramilitaries, {{including}} the Zetas, have now entered uncharted territories.

The United States has stepped in to offer support in the “war on drugs” by the way of funding, American training and military support, and transforming the Mexican judicial system to parallel the American system.|$|E
