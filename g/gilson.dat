5|$|On 27 October 1916, as his {{battalion}} attacked Regina Trench, Tolkien {{came down}} with trench fever, a disease carried by the lice. He was invalided to England on 8 November 1916. Many of his dearest school friends {{were killed in the}} war. Among their number were Rob <b>Gilson</b> of the Tea Club and Barrovian Society, who was killed {{on the first day of}} the Somme while leading his men in the assault on Beaumont Hamel. Fellow T.C.B.S. member Geoffrey Smith was killed during the same battle when a German artillery shell landed on a first aid post. Tolkien's battalion was almost completely wiped out following his return to England.|$|E
5|$|Harvard had so {{much trouble}} finding a {{replacement}} for Gray that they considered hiring a European, but they found an American and hired George Lincoln Goodale in late 1872. Goodale had a medical degree from Harvard and a solid knowledge of botany. By late June 1873 Goodale had enough experience that Gray was exalted to pronounce he had taught his last class. William <b>Gilson</b> Farlow also had a medical degree from Harvard and had studied botany. He became Gray's assistant in 1870 after obtaining his medical degree and then studied in Europe for a few years. He returned to Harvard in 1874 and became a botany professor. Sereno Watson began helping Gray with taxonomy in 1872 and became the herbarium curator. The reorganization of botany at Harvard in the early 1870s was a major accomplishment of Gray's.|$|E

60|$|Milt {{wondered}} what unperceived bag of cement had hardened {{the faces of}} Saxton and the <b>Gilsons.</b>|$|R
60|$|He endured his martyrdom till {{his party}} arrived--the <b>Gilsons,</b> Claire, Jeff Saxton, and a {{glittering}} young woman whose name, Milt thought, was Mrs. Corey.|$|R

25|$|Spectators {{included}} Desperate Housewives actress Dana Delany, whilst {{participants included}} RTÉ personalities Síle and Gráinne Seoige, model Glenda <b>Gilson</b> and former Xposé presenter Lorraine Keane. 85-year-old Maureen Armstrong from Thurles, County Tipperary, was the race's oldest competitor.|$|E
60|$|Mr. Geoffrey Saxton, in Alaskan tan and New York evening {{clothes and}} Piccadilly poise, {{was talking to}} the Eugene <b>Gilsons</b> while Claire {{finished}} dressing for the theater.|$|R
6000|$|They all sat down, four on the bed; and Milt's {{inner ear}} heard a mute snicker from the <b>Gilsons</b> and Saxton. He tried to talk. He couldn't. Bill {{looked at him}} and, perceiving the dumbness, gallantly helped out: ...|$|R
60|$|Mr. Martin was an unentertaining {{bachelor}} who entertained. There were a dozen supercilious young {{married people}} at his bayside cottage when the <b>Gilsons</b> arrived. Among them were two eyebrow-arching young matrons whom Claire had not met--Mrs. Corey and Mrs. Betz.|$|R
25|$|Chairman of the American Israel Public Affairs Committee Alan Solow has {{expressed}} his enthusiasm {{in an interview}} by George <b>Gilson</b> {{that there is an}} increasing exchange of information between the two lobbies and leaders of both communities consistently join forces to solve their common problems.|$|E
25|$|The {{successive}} linguistic disputes {{have made}} the successive Belgian governments very unstable. The three major parties (Liberal -right wing-, Catholic -center- and, Socialist -left wing-) all split in two according to their French- or Dutch-speaking electorate. A language border {{was determined by the}} first <b>Gilson</b> Act of November 8, 1962. The boundaries of certain provinces, arrondissements and municipalities were modified (among others, Mouscron became a part of Hainaut and Voeren became a part of Limburg) and facilities for linguistic minorities were introduced in 25 municipalities. On August 2, 1963, the second <b>Gilson</b> Act entered into force, fixing the division of Belgium into four language areas: a Dutch, a French and a German language area, with Brussels as a bilingual area.|$|E
25|$|When {{appointed}} to Paris he encouraged some liberal clergy {{to return to}} the lay state. He was influential in the appointment of his moderate conciliar auxiliary Georges <b>Gilson</b> to the See of Le Mans, replacing senior clergy with men who shared similar views to his own.|$|E
6000|$|The {{guests were}} gone; the <b>Gilsons</b> upstairs. Claire came running, seized Milt's sleeve, coaxed {{him to the}} {{davenport}} in the drawing-room--then sighed, and rubbed her forehead, and looked so tired that he could say nothing but, [...] "Hope you haven't been overdoing." ...|$|R
60|$|But the <b>Gilsons</b> and Jeff Saxton {{were happy}} about it all--till the car turned from a main {{thoroughfare}} upon a muddy street of shacks that clung like goats {{to the sides of}} a high cut, a street unchanged from the pioneer days of Seattle.|$|R
6000|$|Before Milt could answer, Claire {{rose from}} the bed, {{inspected}} the <b>Gilsons</b> and Jeff with cold dislike, and said quietly to Milt, [...] "The poor dear thing--he was dreadfully embarrassed. It's so {{good of you to}} be nice to him. I believe in being loyal to your old friends." ...|$|R
25|$|Wilmette {{contains}} three public beaches, a {{large one}} at the 60 acre <b>Gilson</b> Park and two smaller ones at Langdon Park and the Elmwood Dunes Preserve. The beaches have been a local family attraction for decades. Swimming is allowed only in specific areas. The park also provides a dog beach which is located south of the main public beach area. Depending on weather conditions, the park's beaches may be temporarily closed {{in order to maintain}} the safety of the park's visitors. <b>Gilson</b> Park also hosts a public theater, the Wallace Bowl, which provides a variety of performances throughout the summer. Tennis courts are open from sunrise to after sunset, and there is space for people to play beach volleyball and soccer. Gillson Park also has a marina (Wilmette Harbor) and built-in grills for barbecuing located throughout the park.|$|E
25|$|Saint Bonaventure, the seraphic doctor, is {{regarded}} as deeply penetrated and imbued with the mind of Saint Francis of Assisi. Étienne <b>Gilson</b> has said that in reading Saint Bonaventure, one receives the impression {{that it is a}} Saint Francis who has been raised up – or who has forgotten himself – and who is philosophizing.|$|E
25|$|With TVS's {{continuing}} to generate large profits, but restricted in ITV network programming, the company started {{to search for}} other investments. In 1985 it launched failed bids to acquire the French TV channel TF1 and Thorn EMI Screen entertainment. In 1986 TVS was successful in buying Midem, an organisation that promoted trade fairs, and <b>Gilson</b> International a Los Angeles distribution company selling programmes outside the US. TVS also acquired a 3.5% stake in Australia Network Ten company Northern Star.|$|E
60|$|He {{saw that}} Claire was angry; {{but that the}} <b>Gilsons</b> and Mrs. Corey, flap-eared, gape-mouthed, forward-bending, were very proud of their little Jeff. He saw that, except for their clothes and {{self-conscious}} coiffures, they were exactly like a gang of cracker-box loafers at Heinie Rauskukle's badgering a new boy in town.|$|R
60|$|They {{were in the}} drawing-room, resting {{after the}} tact and tumult of the bruncheon. Claire had been here long enough now for the <b>Gilsons</b> to forget her comfortably, and be affectionate and quarrelsome and natural, and to admit by their {{worrying}} that even in their exalted social position there were things to fuss about.|$|R
6000|$|... "Tea---- Now we're so {{near your}} <b>Gilsons,</b> I {{begin to get}} scared. Wouldn't know what to do. Gee, I've heard you have to balance a tea-cup and a {{sandwich}} and a hunk o' cake {{and a lot of}} conversation all at once! I'd spill the tea, and drop crumbs, and probably have the butler set on me." ...|$|R
25|$|However, unlike {{transcendental}} Thomism, the metaphysics of Lublin Thomism places {{priority on}} existence (as opposed to essence), {{making it an}} existential Thomism that demonstrates consonance with the Thomism of Étienne <b>Gilson.</b> It {{should be noted that}} the phenomenological concerns of the Lublin school are not metaphysical in nature as this would constitute idealism. Rather, they are considerations which are brought into relation with central positions of the school, such as when dealing with modern science, its epistemological value, and its relation to metaphysics.|$|E
25|$|Less than 3 {{months after}} winning the Copa do Brasil, Scolari would leave the club that was having poor {{appearances}} in the Campeonato Brasileiro. This way, Palmeiras signed with <b>Gilson</b> Kleina, then coach of Ponte Preta, but the team failed to improve its performances in tournament and was relegated to the Campeonato Brasileiro Série B, {{for the second time}} since 2002, in its history, after a draw against Flamengo, on November 18, in round 36 of the 2012 Série A.|$|E
25|$|The most iconic {{structure}} is the Berlaymont, the primary {{seat of the}} Commission. It was the first building to be constructed for the Community, originally built in the 1960s. It was designed by Lucien De Vestel, Jean <b>Gilson,</b> André Polak and Jean Polak and {{paid for by the}} Belgian government (who could occupy it if the Commission left Brussels). It was inspired by the UNESCO headquarters building in Paris, designed as a four-pointed star on supporting columns, and at the time an ambitious design.|$|E
60|$|Milt had desperately {{tried to}} make his answer gracious but somehow---- He hated this devil's obsequiousness {{more than he had}} his chilliness at Flathead Lake. He had a feeling that the <b>Gilsons</b> had delightedly kicked each other under the table; that, for all her unchanging smile, Claire was unhappy.... And she was so far off, a white wraith {{floating}} beyond his frantic grasp.|$|R
6000|$|... "My dear!" [...] She was {{fiercely}} addressing not {{him alone}} but the Betzes and Coreys and <b>Gilsons</b> and Jeff Saxtons, [...] "don't you forget {{for one moment}} that all these people--here or Brooklyn either--that seem so aloof and amused, are secretly just plain people with enamel on, and you're to have the very best enamel, if it's worth while. I'm {{not sure that it}} is----" ...|$|R
6000|$|Claire {{tried to}} wriggle {{out from under}} the thought of Milt while, with the <b>Gilsons</b> as the perfect audience, she improvised on the theme of wandering. With certain {{unintended}} exaggerations, and certain not quite accurate groupings of events, she described the farmers and cowpunchers, the incredible hotels and garages. Indeed they had become incredible to her own self. Obviously this silken girl couldn't possibly take seriously a Dlorus Kloh--or a young garage man who said [...] "ain't." ...|$|R
25|$|Julius P. <b>Gilson</b> of the British Museum dated the {{manuscript}} 1185–1225. It is copied from {{two very different}} exemplars in different orthographies, both from the twelfth century and both from the same area in the West Midlands; the older (E) contains eleventh-century documents transliterated into Middle English; the newer (L) contains only Middle English texts. Until R. M. Wilson's 1935 investigation of the dialect, the collection {{was thought to be}} written in the Middlesex dialect of the London area; Wilson's West Midlands provenance is generally accepted.|$|E
25|$|He {{read the}} Thomistic {{philosophers}} Étienne <b>Gilson</b> and Jacques Maritain—one {{of the main}} Catholic thinkers of his youth—as well as Jean Guitton, but also the Protestant philosopher Paul Ricœur, and Maurice Clavel, and the existentialist philosopher Jean-Paul Sartre. Close to Augustinism, he preferred the post-conciliar theologian Louis Bouyer to the (pre-conciliar) neo-Thomist Reginald Garrigou-Lagrange. His main influence was Henri de Lubac, {{as well as the}} Jesuits Albert and Paul Chapelle. Lustiger, unlike other leading twentieth-century French bishops, did not draw noticeably on patristic writings and was more sensitive to rabbinic texts.|$|E
25|$|During the depression, the Works Progress Administration program {{undertook}} {{a project in}} Wilmette to resurface brick streets. Bricks were removed and relaid upside-down, exposing a smooth non-weathered side. Another WPA project that was undertaken was the refurbishment of Wilmette pier, which is located {{just north of the}} mouth of Wilmette Harbor and had originally been built in 1906. An additional WPA project broke ground in 1936, beginning construction on a lakefront amphitheater at <b>Gilson</b> Park. The venue, now known as the Wallace Bowl (in honor of Gordon Wallace, Park District superintendent from 1936 until 1968), opened the following year.|$|E
60|$|Claire {{had often}} managed her circle of girls, {{but it had}} never {{occurred}} to her to manage her executive father save by indirect and pretty teasing. Now, in conspiracy with the doctor, she bullied her father. He saw gray death waiting as alternative, and he was meek. He agreed to everything. He consented to drive with her across two thousand miles of plains and mountains to Seattle, to drop in for a call on their cousins, the Eugene <b>Gilsons.</b>|$|R
6000|$|She {{could only}} mutter in growing panic, [...] "I'm crazy. In-sane! Pledging myself to this boy before I {{know how he}} will turn out. Will he learn {{anything}} besides engineering? I know it--I do want to stroke his cheek and--his kiss frightened me, but---- Will I hate him when I see him with nice people? Can I introduce him to the <b>Gilsons?</b> Oh, I was mad; so wrought up by that idiotic chase with Dlorus, and so sure I was a romantic heroine and---- And I'm simply an indecisive girl in a realistic muddle!" ...|$|R
6000|$|Milt made tea, {{ignoring}} them, while Bill {{entertained the}} <b>Gilsons</b> and Saxtons with Rabelaisian stories of threshing-time when shirts prickly with chaff and gritty with dust stuck to sweat-dripping backs; of the [...] "funny thing" [...] of Milt and Bill being hired {{to move a}} garbage-pile and [...] "swiping" [...] their employer's [...] "mushmelons"; of knotting shirts at the swimming-hole so that the bawling youngsters had to [...] "chaw beef"; of drinking beer in the livery-stable at Melrose; of dropping the water-pitcher from a St. Klopstock hotel window upon {{the head of the}} [...] "constabule" [...] and escaping from him across the lean-to roof.|$|R
