5|$|Crystal Tools <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>game</b> engine {{created and}} used {{internally}} by the Japanese company Square Enix. It combines standard libraries for {{elements such as}} graphics, sound and artificial intelligence while providing game developers with various authoring tools. The target systems of Crystal Tools are the PlayStation 3, the Xbox 360, Microsoft Windows and the Wii. This was decided {{with the intention of}} making cross-platform production more feasible. The idea for the engine sprang from Square Enix's desire to have a unified game development environment in order to effectively share the technology and know-how of the company's individual teams.|$|E
5|$|Mind of a Man <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>game</b> show {{broadcast}} by Game Show Network, with DeRay Davis as host. On each episode, two female contestants attempt {{to figure out}} what men believe about marriage, dating, work, and other subjects. Similar to Family Feud, the questions have previously been answered by a survey of one hundred men. Over the course of four rounds, a celebrity panel consisting of two men and a woman helps the contestants by offering their opinions about the correct answers to the surveys. The winner advances to the bonus round, which features a top prize of $10,000.|$|E
5|$|The Witches, 2013, by Martin Wallace, {{published}} by Treefrog Games. This <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>game</b> aimed at younger or more family oriented players. They must {{move around the}} town of Lancre and its surrounds, dealing with 'problems' ranging from a sick pig, to an invasion by vampires. Each player has a one-use special power. It is a semi-cooperative game, in that all players can lose if the game wins, but if they resolve all the problems, then {{one of them will}} win.|$|E
50|$|Russia and Denmark have {{similarly}} declared poker to <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>game</b> of skill. In the Gutshot Poker Club case in England, {{the court}} ruled poker to <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>game</b> of luck and so subject to the Gaming Act (though this is currently under appeal).|$|R
50|$|Also {{released}} in 2004 <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>game</b> {{very different from}} anything KSK had done before. It <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>game</b> called Tennis, which obviously <b>was</b> just <b>a</b> tennis <b>game.</b> However, it was not released as <b>a</b> boxed <b>game</b> available in stores, instead it was only available to buy over {{the internet as a}} download for a small price. KSK followed this up with <b>a</b> Golf <b>game</b> {{released in}} 2005, which is also only available over the internet.|$|R
5000|$|Commonwealth of Pennsylvania v. Walter Watkins <b>was</b> <b>a</b> Pennsylvania {{court case}} wherein a Columbia County Court ruled that poker <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>game</b> of skill not luck, thus not illegal {{gambling}} per the state statutes. [...] Later, On April 2, 2010, a Pennsylvania Superior Court overturned the ruling declaring poker to <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>game</b> of luck.|$|R
5|$|The {{broadcasts}} of {{the games}} between the rivals have led {{to an increase in}} television ratings. These games have had at least 50% higher ratings than all of the other games broadcast, sometimes almost twice as high than locally broadcast games. In most cases, the most-watched MLB game on any network during a season <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>game</b> between the Yankees and the Red Sox.|$|E
5|$|Baccarat <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>game</b> {{for up to}} 20 players, {{together}} with a banker and croupier; several packs of cards are used, depending {{on the number of}} players. The value of the ace to nine cards are as their pip value, while tens and court cards count as zero. A player is dealt two cards and adds up the combined pips, discounting 10's and court cards, and only using the single digit value as a score - a King and a 6 will equal 16, but their value will be 6; two 8s will equal 16, and their value will also be 6. Two court cards will count as zero, or baccarat. The idea of the game is to get 9 points. A player may ask for one extra card to be added to their hand. Betting is between the player and the bank, with the closest to reach 9 on a hand receiving the stake.|$|E
5|$|Each side then {{attempted}} to rush all available pilots into the system, and the game's time dilation software engaged. Time dilation <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>game</b> feature created by developer CCP Games to handle heavy loads {{on the game}} server without the game lagging or disconnecting players. In time dilation, the game slows to ten percent normal speed, with each second of game time displaying as ten seconds of real time. The two sides traded Titan kills every hour, when their Doomsday weapons could fire again, and the system became filled with warp disruption bubbles, making extraction difficult. For a while neither side gained any real advantage, though CFC/Rus managed to on-line their Territorial Control Units and held a slight lead {{in the number of}} enemy Titans destroyed. Throughout the engagement, related battles played out across the entire game universe as fleets tried to block reinforcements, destroy fleeing capitals and super-capitals, or trap pilots attempting to enter the fray.|$|E

5|$|Grant {{continued}} his coaching {{success in the}} NFL as he took over from original coach, Norm Van Brocklin. Over his tenure as Vikings head coach, Grant was known for instilling discipline in his teams and displaying a lack of emotion during games. He believed that football <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>game</b> of controlled emotion and teams would not follow the coach's lead {{if he were to}} panic or lose his poise {{during the course of a}} game. He required his team to stand at attention in a straight line during the entire national anthem played before the game and even had national anthem practice. Grant required outdoor practice during the winter to get players used to the cold weather and would not allow heaters on the sidelines during games.|$|E
5|$|Like the original, {{there are}} the {{challenge}} and head-to-head game modes. In challenge mode, players play a series of races against three opponents and must finish first or second to progress to the next race. If a good enough lap time {{on any of the}} earlier levels is achieved, players automatically win the race. Placing first three times in a row earns players the chance to win an extra life by playing a special round to collect vehicles within a time limit. Head-to-head <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>game</b> which involves one opponent achieving enough distance from opponents to be the only racer on the screen. This earns that player a point, represented by coloured lights on the screen: one light turns the colour of that player. If all eight lights are one colour, the player of that colour wins. If after three laps, the colours are mixed, the player with the most lights wins. Players are given thee lives in both modes. Players select a character, whose stats only affect computer-controlled players, to play as before racing.|$|E
5|$|Peter Molyneux {{stated that}} {{he came up with}} the idea of {{creating}} Theme Park because he felt the business genre was worth pursuing. He said that Theme Park <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>game</b> he had always wanted to create, and wanted to avoid the mistakes of his earlier business simulation game, The Entrepreneur: he wanted to create a business simulation game and make it fun so people would want to play it. In an interview, he explained that the primary reason he created Theme Park was because he wanted players to create their dream Theme Park. Another reason is he wanted players to understand the kind of work running one entails. The three difficulty settings enable players to choose the desired depth: simply having fun creating a theme park, or making all the business decisions too. Molyneux stated that the most difficult part to program was the visitors' behaviour.|$|E
