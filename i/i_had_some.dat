He later appeared in the television commercial for Gwalior Suiting on the insistence of a family friend, and was subsequently cast by director Anand Mahindroo. The project eventually got cancelled but [...] Khan relocated to Mumbai {{to pursue a career}} in film; he recalls, [...] "Finally <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>some</b> direction and focus. I remember [...] feeling so excited that I could go to Mumbai, stay in my own place and enjoy the adventure of starting my own career." ...|$|E
500|$|In 2008, {{while working}} on several films, A. R. Rahman {{received}} an email from Danny Boyle, {{the director of the}} film Slumdog Millionaire, stating: [...] "Hey I'm Danny Boyle, I like your work, and it would be great for us to have you on our film". Rahman was unsure how to answer, but after exchanging several more emails, they met in Mumbai. Rahman summarized their first meeting by saying [...] "when I talked to him, <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>some</b> interest and I wanted to see the film. He had a first cut of the film already, and when I saw that I was really interested and wanted to do it. So I left another film to do this one. I made time for it".|$|E
500|$|Between {{his time}} in the poor schools and his mother succumbing to mental illness, Chaplin began to perform on stage. He later {{recalled}} making his first amateur appearance at the age of five years, when he took over from Hannah one night in Aldershot. This was an isolated occurrence, {{but by the time he}} was nine Chaplin had, with his mother's encouragement, grown interested in performing. He later wrote: [...] " [...] imbued me with the feeling that <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>some</b> sort of talent". Through his father's connections, Chaplin became a member of the Eight Lancashire Lads clog-dancing troupe, with whom he toured English music halls throughout 1899 and 1900. Chaplin worked hard, and the act was popular with audiences, but he was not satisfied with dancing and wished to form a comedy act.|$|E

500|$|On March 21, 2011, Alice in Chains {{announced}} that {{they were working on}} a fifth studio album, and both Cantrell and Inez later made statements that they had begun the recording process. The album was expected to be finished by summer of 2012 and released by the end of 2012 or beginning of 2013. While Alice in Chains were writing for the album in 2011, Cantrell required surgery, which delayed recording the new material. In an interview published in May 2012, Cantrell explained, [...] "The thing that set me back is <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>some</b> bone spurs [...] cartilage issues in my shoulders. I had the same issue in the other shoulder about six years ago so I've had them both done now. It's a repetitive motion injury from playing." ...|$|E
500|$|Because the Fugitive Slave Law {{had made}} the {{northern}} United States a more dangerous place for escaped slaves to remain, many escaped slaves began migrating to Southern Ontario. In December 1851, Tubman guided an unidentified group of 11 fugitives, possibly including the Bowleys and several others she had helped rescue earlier, northward. There is {{evidence to suggest that}} Tubman and her group stopped at the home of abolitionist and former slave Frederick Douglass. In his third autobiography, Douglass wrote: [...] "On one occasion I had eleven fugitives at the same time under my roof, and it was necessary for them to remain with me until I could collect sufficient money to get them on to Canada. It was the largest number I ever had at any one time, and <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>some</b> difficulty in providing so many with food and shelter...." [...] The number of travelers and the time of the visit make it likely that this was Tubman's group.|$|E
500|$|The film project {{started in}} late 2004 when John Nordling, a {{producer}} at the production company EFTI, contacted Ajvide Lindqvist's publisher Ordfront {{to acquire the}} rights for a film adaptation of his novel, Let the Right One In: [...] "At Ordfront they just laughed when I called, I was like the 48th they put on the list. But I called John Ajvide Lindqvist {{and it turned out}} we had the same idea of what kind of film we should make. It wasn't about money, but about the right constellation". A friend introduced Tomas Alfredson to the novel. While he normally does not like to receive books, because [...] "it's a private thing to choose what to read", he decided after a few weeks to read it. The depiction of bullying in the novel affected Alfredson deeply. [...] "It's very hard and very down-to-earth, unsentimental (...) <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>some</b> period when I grew up when I had hard times in school (...) So it really shook me", he told the Los Angeles Times. Ajvide Lindqvist already knew Alfredson's previous work, and he and Alfredson discovered that they [...] "understood each other very well".|$|E

500|$|In a 1991 {{interview}} with People, Barr described {{herself as an}} [...] "incest survivor", accusing both of her parents of physical and sexual abuse, claims which they and Geraldine publicly denied. Melvin Belli, her parents' lawyer, {{said that they had}} passed a lie detector test [...] "with flying colors". Barr was even part of an incest recovery group, something she said her parents knew about but for which they were [...] "in denial". On February 14, 2011, Barr and Geraldine appeared on The Oprah Winfrey Show where Barr admitted that the word [...] "incest" [...] could have been the wrong word to use and should have waited until her therapy was over before revealing the [...] "darkest time" [...] in her life. She told Oprah, [...] "I was in a very unhappy relationship and I was prescribed numerous psychiatric drugs... to {{deal with the fact that}} <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>some</b> mental illness... I totally lost touch with reality... (and) I didn’t know what the truth was... I just wanted to drop a bomb on my family". She added that not everything was [...] "made up", saying, [...] "Nobody accuses their parents of abusing them without justification". Geraldine said they did not speak for 12 years, but had recently reconciled.|$|E
500|$|The {{episode was}} filmed in mid-September 2009 in Vancouver. Due to the Russian {{lettering}} {{on many of}} the episode props, director Cassar joked during shooting, [...] "Can we get a translator and find out what this writing means, specifically? Maybe it says 'Do not open until Christmas' or 'Watch The Simpsons on Sunday night,' knowing Fox." [...] To create the episode's auditory effects, sound editor Bruce Tanis explained his production steps in an interview with Designing Sound, [...] "'Earthling' was a really good episode for strange sounds. It starts out with the appearance of a smoke monster that kills its victims by enveloping them and leaving behind an exact life-like looking corpse only the body is made of ash which crumbles horribly when touched. The smoke creature moved rapidly as opposed to gently drifting so <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>some</b> movement to play off of in creating a sound for him. I came up with some stuttering, fluttery whooshes that kind of vibrated which made him more dangerous than if he sounded like a puff of steam moving along the hall. The smoke monster requires a host body to live in when he's not vibrating around killing people. The only way to recall the smoke monster to the host body, or to keep him there in the first place, is by severe electrical shock." ...|$|E
500|$|Mullen has {{admitted}} his bass drum technique {{is not one}} of his strengths and has used a floor tom to his left to create the effect he wants (since The Unforgettable Fire era), using it for accents or in songs such as [...] "With or Without You", [...] "In God's Country", [...] "One" [...] and Pride (In the Name of Love)". Speaking in 1995, he said, [...] "When it came to recording 'Pride' for The Unforgettable Fire album, Danny [...] was able to pick up from me that <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>some</b> interesting ideas but here was a slight lack of focus. My kick drum technique was then, as it is now, completely underdeveloped and I {{never got a chance to}} practice and learn like most people would. In the marching bands, I only used a snare and when I first got a kit, I never learned how to properly use all the elements together. So I went and listened to a basic demo of 'Pride' and tried to play a beat just using the kick and snare. But I couldn't get the kick to do what I wanted, so I got a floor tom down and did what I'd done in the past, which was if I couldn't physically do what was necessary, I'd find another way around it. I couldn't do what most people would consider a normal beat for the song, so I chose alternatives." ...|$|E
