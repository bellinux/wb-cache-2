5|$|Research done by McCarthy and Taylor (1999), <b>found</b> <b>that</b> <b>children</b> with abusive {{childhood}} {{experiences were}} more likely to develop ambivalent attachments. The study also <b>found</b> <b>that</b> <b>children</b> with ambivalent attachments {{were more likely}} to experience difficulties in maintaining intimate relationships as adults.|$|E
5|$|Attachments between {{infants and}} {{caregivers}} form {{even if this}} caregiver is not sensitive and responsive in social interactions with them. This has important implications. Infants cannot exit unpredictable or insensitive caregiving relationships. Instead they must manage themselves {{as best they can}} within such relationships. Based on her established Strange Situation Protocol, research by developmental psychologist Mary Ainsworth in the 1960s and 1970s <b>found</b> <b>that</b> <b>children</b> will have different patterns of attachment depending primarily on how they experienced their early caregiving environment. Early patterns of attachment, in turn, shape — but do not determine — the individual's expectations in later relationships.|$|E
5|$|Cognitive {{flexibility}} and other executive function skills {{are crucial to}} success both in classroom settings and life. A study examining the impact of cognitive intervention for at-risk children in preschool classrooms <b>found</b> <b>that</b> <b>children</b> who received such intervention for {{one to two years}} significantly outperformed their peers. Compared to same-age children who were randomly assigned to the control condition (a literacy unit developed by the school district), preschoolers who received intervention achieved accuracy scores of 85% on tests of inhibitory control (self-discipline), cognitive flexibility, and working memory. Their peers in the control (no intervention) condition, on the other hand, demonstrated only 65% accuracy. Educators involved in this study ultimately opted to implement the cognitive skills training techniques instead of the district-developed curriculum.|$|E
30|$|All {{the studies}} {{summarized}} in Table  1 <b>found</b> <b>that</b> having <b>children</b> {{increases the likelihood}} of self-employment among women. With one exception (Arai 2000), the studies also <b>found</b> <b>that</b> having <b>children</b> increases the odds of self-employment among men.|$|R

40|$|This thesis added {{new insight}} to {{research}} {{knowledge about the}} role that season and ultraviolet radiation (UV) exposure during pregnancy has on children's temperament and behaviours, using a nation-wide longitudinal study. It was <b>found</b> <b>that</b> young <b>children</b> born in summer months {{are likely to have}} problematic behaviours. The thesis also <b>found</b> <b>that</b> summer-born <b>children</b> are likely to receive lowest levels of UV exposure during the gestational period. Finally, this work showed that low gestational UV exposure is associated with an increased risk of behavioural problems in children...|$|R

25|$|A Factories Inquiry Commission of 1833 <b>found</b> <b>that</b> <b>children</b> {{working in}} the mills were often too tired to eat and, when woken in the morning, unable to dress themselves. Scotland was {{considered}} the worst area for child cruelty and their tiredness often caused serious accidents with the machinery.|$|E
25|$|It {{has also}} been <b>found</b> <b>that</b> <b>children</b> who are cruel to animals have often {{witnessed}} or been victims of abuse themselves. In two separate studies cited by the Humane Society of the United States, roughly one-third of families suffering from domestic abuse indicated {{that at least one}} child had hurt or killed a pet.|$|E
25|$|Sweet potato cultivars {{with dark}} orange flesh have more {{beta-carotene}} {{than those with}} light-colored flesh, and their increased cultivation is being encouraged in Africa where vitamin A deficiency is a serious health problem. A 2012 study of 10,000 households in Uganda <b>found</b> <b>that</b> <b>children</b> eating beta-carotene enriched sweet potatoes suffered less vitamin A deficiency than those not consuming as much beta-carotene.|$|E
2500|$|Based on data {{collected}} in 1921–22, Terman concluded <b>that</b> gifted <b>children</b> suffered no more health problems than normal for their age, save {{a little more}} myopia than average. [...] He also <b>found</b> <b>that</b> the <b>children</b> were usually social, were well-adjusted, did better in school, and were even taller than average. A follow-up performed in 1923–1924 <b>found</b> <b>that</b> the <b>children</b> had maintained their high IQs and were still above average overall as a group. Data collected in the 1920s also including a pioneering effort to implement above-level testing on a large scale, a practice that is widespread in gifted education today.|$|R
50|$|In 2017, an Associated Press {{investigation}} <b>found</b> <b>that</b> {{for every}} adult-on-child offence, {{there are seven}} child-on-child sex offences. These crimes are rarely reported in the media or prosecuted. However, in Human Rights Watch's 2013 investigation of strict US laws, it was <b>found</b> <b>that</b> <b>child</b> perpetrators as young as 11 have, at times, been forced to register on long-term publicly searchable databases. In some US jurisdictions, consenting teenage couples in possession of each other's nude photographs have also been charged with possessing child pornography and forced to register as sex offenders under mandatory sentencing requirements.|$|R
40|$|Previous {{research}} has <b>found</b> <b>that</b> <b>child</b> support receipts deter mothers' labor supply less than does other non-wage income. This paper argues <b>that</b> because <b>child</b> support is a variable income source, actual receipts {{may differ from}} unobservable permanent receipts on which hours worked are based. This introduces an errors-in-variables bias causing the estimated income effect of child support on hours worked to be biased toward zero. When one replaces actual receipts with predicted permanent receipts, such income effect {{is found to be}} statistically indistinguishable from that of other non-wage income.

25|$|The Bobo doll {{experiment}} {{was conducted by}} Albert Bandura in 1961. In this work, Bandura <b>found</b> <b>that</b> <b>children</b> exposed to an aggressive adult model acted more aggressively {{than those who were}} exposed to a nonaggressive adult model. This experiment suggests that anyone who comes in contact with and interacts with children can affect the way they react and handle situations.|$|E
25|$|Malaria {{has also}} been a {{historically}} major health issue in Nicaragua, and during the 1930s up to 60% of the population had malaria. Usage of bed-nets protecting against mosquitos have been reported to be 25.3% amongst all Nicaraguan households. Within these households, it was <b>found</b> <b>that</b> <b>children</b> were more often protected than adults with 46% of bed-net coverage of infants under 1 year.|$|E
25|$|A {{comparison}} of how children {{interact with their}} brothers and sisters on such 1950s situation comedy television programs as Leave It To Beaver and Father Knows Best with those on such 1980s programs as The Cosby Show and Family Ties <b>found</b> <b>that</b> <b>children</b> interacted more positively in the early period but were important and central – if more conflictual – to the main story action in the 1980s.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{examines}} whether {{child labour}} affects {{the acquisition of}} a child's human capital. For this purpose, a behavioural model in which child labour is itself a choice and simultaneous equation models with limited dependent variables are employed to examine the determinants of human capital formation and its relationship with child labour. No trade-off relationship could be found between child labour and child schooling attainment. However, it was <b>found</b> <b>that</b> <b>child</b> labour is not detrimental to a child's health and nutritional status; rather, it improves these if children work within a critical threshold level. ...|$|R
25|$|There {{has been}} much {{research}} on whether eating prior to a cognitive recall test can affect cognitive functioning. One example was {{a study of the}} effect of breakfast timing on selected cognitive functions of elementary school students. Their results <b>found</b> <b>that</b> <b>children</b> who ate breakfast at school scored notably higher on most of the cognitive tests than did students who ate breakfast at home and also children who did not eat breakfast at all.|$|E
25|$|Also, if the Flynn {{effect has}} ended for the {{majority}} in developed nations, it may still continue for minorities, especially for groups like immigrants where many may have received poor nutrition during early childhood or have had other disadvantages. A study in the Netherlands <b>found</b> <b>that</b> <b>children</b> of non-Western immigrants had improvements for g, educational achievements, and work proficiency compared to their parents, although there were still remaining differences compared to ethnic Dutch.|$|E
25|$|A {{study by}} Gathercole and Baddeley (1989) showed the {{importance}} of sound for early word meaning. They tested the phonological memory of 4- and 5-year-old children, i.e., how well these children were able to remember a sequence of unfamiliar sounds. They <b>found</b> <b>that</b> <b>children</b> with better phonological memory also had larger vocabularies at both ages. Moreover, phonological memory at age 4 predicted the children’s vocabulary at age 5, even with earlier vocabulary and nonverbal intelligence factored out.|$|E
5000|$|The reward left {{varies by}} country, the family's {{economic}} status, amounts the child's peers report receiving and other factors. [...] A 2013 survey by Visa Inc. <b>found</b> <b>that</b> American <b>children</b> receive $3.70 per tooth on average.|$|R
50|$|Additionally, {{poor and}} {{minority}} students have disproportionately less access to high-quality early childhood education, {{which has been}} shown to have a strong impact on early learning and development. One study <b>found</b> <b>that</b> although black <b>children</b> are more likely to attend preschool than white children, they may experience lower-quality care. The same study also <b>found</b> <b>that</b> Hispanic <b>children</b> in the U.S. are much less likely to attend preschool than white children. Another study conducted in Illinois in 2010 <b>found</b> <b>that</b> only one in three Latino parents could find a preschool slot for his or her child, compared to almost two thirds of other families.|$|R
50|$|A 2002 {{review of}} the {{literature}} identified 20 studies examining outcomes among children raised by gay or lesbian parents and <b>found</b> <b>that</b> these <b>children</b> did not systematically differ from those raised by heterosexual parents on any of the studied outcomes.|$|R
25|$|In one {{experimental}} study, adults {{accustomed to}} wearing helmets cycled more slowly without a helmet, but {{no difference in}} helmeted and unhelmeted cycling speed was found for cyclists who do not usually wear helmets. An experimental study <b>found</b> <b>that</b> <b>children</b> negotiating an obstacle course on foot went faster and took more risks when wearing safety gear (including helmets). A telephone interview study found that in hypothetical scenarios of their children wearing protective equipment or not, parents' ratings of permissible risk for their children was higher if protective gear was hypothetically worn.|$|E
25|$|Music {{has been}} found to be an {{effective}} tool for music therapists through extensive research. It is beneficial for any individual, both physically and mentally, through improved heart rate, reduced anxiety, stimulation of the brain, and improved learning. Music therapists use their techniques to help their patients in many areas, ranging from stress relief before and after surgeries, to neuropathologies such as Alzheimer's disease. One study <b>found</b> <b>that</b> <b>children</b> who listened to music while having an IV inserted into their arms showed less distress and felt less pain than the children who did not listen to music while having an IV inserted.|$|E
25|$|One common {{group of}} people that have visual memory {{problems}} are children with reading disabilities. It was often thought that disabilities are caused by failure to perceive the letters of a written word in the right order. However, studies show {{it is more likely that}} it is caused by a failure to encode and process the correct order of letters within the word. This means that the child perceives the word just as anyone else would, however their brains do not appear to hold onto the visual characteristics of the word. Although initially it was <b>found</b> <b>that</b> <b>children</b> with reading disabilities had comparable visual memory to those without difficulty, a more specific part of the visual memory system has been found to cause reading disabilities.|$|E
50|$|A {{study in}} 1978 <b>found</b> <b>that,</b> {{although}} <b>children</b> enjoyed {{the characters and}} stories, the material {{had a number of}} inadequacies.
