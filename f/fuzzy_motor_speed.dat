40|$|Fuzzy logic or {{fuzzy set}} theory is {{recently}} getting increasing emphasis in process control applications. This paper presents {{an application of}} fuzzy logic to control {{the speed of a}} synchronous machine (SM). Based on the analysis of the SM transient response and fuzzy logic, a fuzzy controller is developed. The fuzzy controller generates the variations of the reference current vector of the SM speed control based on the speed error and its change. Digital simulation results shows that the designed fuzzy speed controller realises a good dynamic behaviour of the <b>motor,</b> a perfect <b>speed</b> tracking with no overshoot and a good rejection of impact loads disturbance. The results of applying the fuzzy logic controller to a SM give best performances and high robustness than those obtained by the application of a conventional controller (PI).

40|$|It is {{well known}} that Escherichia coli {{achieves}} chemotaxis by modulating the bias of the flagellar motor. Recent experiments have shown that the bacteria vary their swimming speeds as well in presence of attractants. However, this increase in the swimming speed in response to the attractants has not been correlated with the increase in the flagellar <b>motor</b> <b>speed.</b> Using flickering dark-field microscopy, we measure the head-rotation speed of a large population of cells to correlate it with the flagellar <b>motor</b> <b>speed.</b> Experiments performed with wild-type and trg-deletion mutant strains suggest that the cells are capable of modulating the flagellar <b>motor</b> <b>speed</b> via mere sensing of a ligand. The <b>motor</b> <b>speed</b> can be further correlated with the swimming speed of the cells and was found to be linear.

40|$|Naming <b>speed,</b> <b>motor</b> skill, and {{auditory}} temporal processing (ATP) are constructs {{that are important}} to reading and language. These variables require processing timing information inherent in the stimulus or processing stimuli rapidly. ATP deficits are found in individuals with reading impairments, but studies are conflicting regarding the relationship between reading and ATP. This study examined relationships between naming <b>speed,</b> <b>motor</b> <b>speed,</b> and ATP, and centered on possible factors why inconsistencies have occurred across studies examining the association between reading and ATP. If the timing element of naming speed (rapid automatized naming-RAN) and of <b>motor</b> <b>speed</b> is common to ATP, then RAN and <b>motor</b> <b>speed</b> should predict thresholds for three auditory tasks (CMR, backward masking, and the precedence effect with TOJ) known to require temporal processing. Tasks were administered to adult participants in order to examine the effects with skilled readers. Many of the variables were skewed and there were multiple outliers that altered the analyses. Ultimately, 75 participants were included in the final data set. Results indicated that RAN did not predict thresholds for any of the masking tasks given. However, <b>motor</b> <b>speed</b> predicted thresholds for one CMR and two backward masking tasks, suggesting that <b>motor</b> <b>speed</b> should be controlled for in research assessing the contribution of ATP to reading or language. Neither naming <b>speed</b> nor <b>motor</b> <b>speed</b> predicted localization performance. Non-verbal intelligence predicted performance on several of the masking tasks, consistent with previous research. Performance on all three auditory tasks was similar to that reported in the literature assessing smaller samples of participants. Although the suggestion of a general timing component is not supported, the relationships found between <b>motor</b> <b>speed</b> and several auditory temporal measures indicate that the underlying timing elements are not independent...|$|R

After neglecting nonlinear terms, torsional vibration of the shaft-disk system and lateral and longitudinal vibration of the flexible beam are still coupled through the <b>motor</b> <b>speed.</b> The system has three natural frequencies; the flexible shaft-disk system torsional natural frequency, the flexible beam lateral and longitudinal natural frequencies. Eigenvalue calculations show that while the shaft speed changes, torsional natural frequency of the shaft-disk system and the beam longitudinal natural frequency are not changing but the beam lateral natural frequency changes. Beam lateral natural frequency stays {{the same as the}} nonrotating beam lateral natural frequency ωb until the motor speed ωm is equal to ωb. After then ωb increases and remains equal to the <b>motor</b> <b>speed</b> ωm until the <b>motor</b> <b>speed</b> is equal to the shaft-disk system natural frequency ωT.

In addition to univariate analyses, factor analyses, ordinal logistic regression, and multiple linear regressions were used. A general score was also calculated.
