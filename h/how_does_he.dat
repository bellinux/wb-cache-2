Very few records in our genre are like that. Musically it's heavy and the lyrics are very symbolic." [...] In the liner notes of the album's 20th anniversary edition, music journalist Kory Grow wrote that [...] "thanks to a perfect balance of hard-rock song structures, epic choruses, and fleet-fingered guitar work, Countdown to Extinction became an instant classic, benefiting from copious MTV and radio play." [...] Artistdirect editor in chief Rick Florino called the album a [...] "seminal" [...] release and commented that it [...] "changed the game by preserving the band's thrash intensity and impressive technical prowess, while dropping some of the biggest hooks the genre had ever seen". In a retrospective review of the album, Craig Hayes from Popmatters wrote that Countdown to Extinctions [...] "status as a gateway metal album is indisputable" [...] and its [...] "popularity speaks volumes about its significance in the metal canon".|$|E
500|$|On March 25, 1983, Jackson {{reunited with}} his {{brothers}} for a performance taped at the Pasadena Civic Auditorium for , an NBC television special. The show aired on May 16, 1983, to an estimated audience of , and featured the Jacksons and other Motown stars. It is best remembered for Jackson's solo performance of [...] "Billie Jean", which earned Jackson his first Emmy nomination. Wearing a distinctive black-sequined jacket and a golf glove decorated with rhinestones, he debuted his signature dance move, the moonwalk, which former Soul Train dancer and Shalamar member Jeffrey Daniel had taught him three years earlier. Jackson had originally turned down the invitation to perform at the show, believing {{he had been doing}} too much television at the time; at the request of Motown founder Berry Gordy, he agreed to perform in exchange for time to do a solo performance. According to Rolling Stone reporter Mikal Gilmore, [...] "There are times when you know you are hearing or seeing something extraordinary ... that came that night." [...] Jackson's performance drew comparisons to Elvis Presley's and the Beatles' appearances on The Ed Sullivan Show. Anna Kisselgoff of The New York Times wrote in 1988: [...] "The moonwalk that he made famous is an apt metaphor for his dance style. <b>How</b> <b>does</b> <b>he</b> do it? As a technician, he is a great illusionist, a genuine mime. His ability to keep one leg straight as he glides while the other bends and seems to walk requires perfect timing." [...] Gordy said of the performance: [...] "From the first beat of 'Billie Jean', I was mesmerized, and when he did his iconic moonwalk, I was shocked, it was magic, Michael Jackson went into orbit, and never came down." ...|$|E

2500|$|Cohen was {{described}} as a Sabbath-observant Jew in an article in The New York Times:Mr. Cohen keeps the Sabbath even while on tour and performed for Israeli troops during the 1973 Arab-Israeli war. So <b>how</b> <b>does</b> <b>he</b> square that faith with his continued practice of Zen? [...] "Allen Ginsberg asked me the same question many years ago", he said. [...] "Well, for one thing, in the tradition of Zen that I've practiced, there is no prayerful worship and there is no affirmation of a deity. So theologically there is no challenge to any Jewish belief." [...] In his concert in Ramat Gan, Israel, on September 24, 2009, Cohen spoke Jewish prayers and blessings to the audience in Hebrew. He opened the show with the first sentence of Ma Tovu. At the middle he used Baruch Hashem, and he ended the concert reciting the blessing of Birkat Cohanim.|$|E
2500|$|.....think of the {{following}} use of language: I send someone shopping. I give him a slip marked 'five red apples'. He takes the slip to the shopkeeper, who opens the drawer marked 'apples', then he looks up the word 'red' in a table and finds a colour sample opposite it; then he says the series of cardinal numbers—I assume that he knows them by heart—up to the word 'five' and for each number he takes an apple of the same colour as the sample out of the drawer.—It is in this and similar ways that one operates with words—"But <b>how</b> <b>does</b> <b>he</b> know where and how he is to look up the word 'red' and what he is {{to do with the}} word 'five'?" [...] Well, I assume that he acts as I have described. Explanations come to an end somewhere.—But what is {{the meaning of the word}} 'five'? No such thing was in question here, only how the word 'five' is used.|$|E
2500|$|Marvel {{editor-in-chief}} Roy Thomas asked writer Len Wein {{to devise}} a character specifically named Wolverine, who is Canadian and of small stature and with a wolverine's fierce temper. John Romita, Sr. designed the first Wolverine costume, and believes he introduced the retractable claws, saying, [...] "When I make a design, I {{want it to be}} practical and functional. I thought, 'If a man has claws like that, <b>how</b> <b>does</b> <b>he</b> scratch his nose or tie his shoelaces?'" [...] Wolverine first appeared in the final [...] "teaser" [...] panel of The Incredible Hulk #180 (cover-dated Oct. 1974) written by Wein and penciled by Herb Trimpe. The character then appeared in a number of advertisements in various Marvel Comics publications before making his first major appearance in The Incredible Hulk #181 (Nov. 1974) again by the Wein–Trimpe team. In 2009, Trimpe said he [...] "distinctly remembers" [...] Romita's sketch and that, [...] "The way I see it, [...] sewed the monster together and I shocked it to life!... It {{was just one of those}} secondary or tertiary characters, actually, that we were using in that particular book with no particular notion of it going anywhere. We did characters in The [...] Hulk all the time that were in [...] issues and that was the end of them." [...] Though often credited as co-creator, Trimpe denied having had any role in Wolverine's creation.|$|E
