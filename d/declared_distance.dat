40|$|International audienceIn recent years, fault {{detection}} {{has become a}} crucial issue in semiconductor manufacturing. Indeed, {{it is necessary to}} constantly improve equipment productivity. Rapid detection of abnormal behavior is one of the primary objectives. Statistical methods such as control charts are the most widely used approaches for {{fault detection}}. Due to the number of variables and the possible correlations between them, these control charts need to be multivariate. Among them, the most popular is probably the Hotelling T 2 rule. However, this rule only makes sense when the variables are Gaussian, which is rarely true in practice. A possible alternative is to use nonparametric control charts, such as the k-Nearest Neighbor Detection rule (He and Wang, 2007), only constructed from the learning sample and without assumption on the variables distribution. This approach consists in evaluating the distance of an observation to its nearest neighbors in the learning sample constituted of observations under control. A fault is <b>declared</b> if this <b>distance</b> is too large. In this paper, a new adaptive Mahalanobis distance, which takes into account the local structure of dependence of the variables, is proposed. Simulation trials are performed to study the benefit of the new distance against the Euclidean distance. The method is applied on the photolithography step of the manufacture of an integrated circuit...|$|R
40|$|This article {{provides}} a new critical edition and a commentary of Peire Bremon Ricas Novas’s “Rics pres, ferms e sobeirans”, a courtly love song composed between 1228 and 1257 and dedicated to Audiart del Baux. Built as a eulogy of the lady, the song {{focuses on the}} central theme of the moral and material ‘ricor’ (richness) of the latter. The complexity of the metrical form, which displays a systematic use of the technique of ‘rim derivatiu’, is paralleled by the semantic obscurity {{of a number of}} verses and hapaxes, all discussed in the commentary. Stanzas III and IV show echoes of Jaufre Rudel’s “amor de lonh”, since the lover-poet <b>declares</b> that the <b>distance</b> and the ethnical difference between himself and the lady are abolished by the strength of his feelings. The use of ethnonyms in stanza IV is closely examined: the lover-poet reveals that he loves a Castilian lady who looks like a ‘Serrana’ (the name of an Iberian population), admitting that he would like her even if she were Catalan or Syrian. These references to the lady’s ethnical origins are puzzling: they can be read as a calembour with burlesque overtones, as well as a climax aiming to define the real provenance of the lady or as a rhetorical device to underline that courtly love does not know any kind of boundary...|$|R
40|$|Transport-category or FAR/CS 25 {{certified}} airplanes may occasionally become {{braking energy}} capacity limited. Such limitation may exist when heavy airplanes are departing airports at high-density altitudes, on relatively long runways, and/or possibly with some tailwind component. A {{maximum braking energy}} VMBE speed exists which may limit the maximum allowable takeoff decision/action speed V 1. The ever-existing possibility of high-speed rejected takeoff in such conditions may also limit the airplane gross weight for <b>declared</b> available <b>distances.</b> To gain deeper insights and acquire {{better understanding of the}} topic, a theoretical model of the maximum braking energy and the related VMBE speed for T-category airplanes was developed. The total kinetic energy of an airplane includes translational and rotary kinetic energy and the potential height-energy component for sloped runways. Time-dependent airplanes’ mechanical power expression has been derived. Weight transfer during dynamic braking has been implemented in the full nonlinear model. Added mass due to rotary inertia of spinning components has been incorporated and assumed constant. The brakes thermal model is based on a lumped-parameter analysis of ventilated brake rotors and stators; the thermal model is based on a small Biot-number approximation and sufficiently well describes the physics of friction braking. The nonlinear differential equations of motion and the differential thermal model are coupled. A nonlinear model incorporating a set of ordinary differential equations with tire slip can be solved numerically. This model enables determination of the entire history of translational and angular accelerations and speeds, longitudinal distance, forces, torque, and disc temperature during braking. A simpler model assuming constant physical and thermodynamic parameters is solved analytically for constant negative acceleration. This linear analytical model {{has been used as a}} workhorse method in our calculations. A new semi-empirical expression of temperature-dependent friction coefficient on brake rotor-stator pairs has been proposed. A theoretical model of maximum braking energy speed VMBE, which includes density-altitude, runway slope, and wind effects as parameters, has been developed for the first time to the best of our knowledge. A comparison of the theoretical VMBE model showed good agreement with measured and approved data for the B 737 - 400 airplane at different density altitudes with and without, individual and combined, runway slope and tailwind effects. Results for new and fully worn brakes were obtained showing the effect of elevated temperatures on brake fade and consequently braking time and distance...|$|R

The higher ground was overgrown with a kind of cactus, which here becomes a tree, forming shady avenues.

Prominent social theorizations have <b>declared</b> locality and <b>distance</b> dead in the global era, which {{is characterized by the}} widespread use of virtual communication. Yet diverse empirical studies on transnational skilled mobility, global brain circulation, and innovation and knowledge transfer show that locality and distance still matter. I argue that grand theorizations would benefit from empirically grounded research, while empirical studies would gain from explicit, systematic studies {{on the issue of the}} presumed demise of distance and locality. The present study aims towards filling this gap with an empirically grounded approach close to real-life meanings and experiences. The empirical questions focus on two issues: 1) personal motivations and identities in relation to place and 2) everyday work and knowledge sharing both locally and at distance. The approach is qualitative and inductive with ethnographic features; the main data are in-depth interviews with Finnish professionals in Silicon Valley. Highly skilled Finns in Silicon Valley represent a case of West-West mobility; from one successful Western location to another. Skilled professionals are an interesting case for the investigation of {{the meaning of}} locality and distance, because according to many authors more privileged people in particular are presumed to be detached from localities and free from the realities and constraints of distance. The findings show that locality and distance are still very much alive from both personal and work perspectives. Firstly, the relationship between personal motivations/identities and place is a two-way one: locations can be seen as targets or ways to fulfill personal or professional dreams, achieve goals, or challenge and develop as a person. Changing locations also evokes new identities, such as the pioneer or the mediator, which are counterintuitive considering the presumed death of distance. Secondly, the dynamics of locality and distance are present in everyday work, which is structured across several time zones, not only the local one. Virtual communication has therefore changed the organization of work locally, but has not erased distance or rendered locality less significant. In contrast, the awareness of distance is emphasized in virtual communication. Physical distance and differences of context (time of day, weather, cultural environment) can pose challenges in reaching mutual understandings or making joint decisions. Furthermore, being present in a locality and experiencing face-to-face interaction becomes even more meaningful in the form of chance encounters, taking collaboration to the next level, accessing certain types of information and knowledge, and inspiration (the experience of "being at the center of things"). Furthermore, the findings indicate that certain kinds of information and tacit knowledge do not travel well across distance and that local presence is needed to access these. The meaning of locality for these professionals can be summarized as three I?s: Information, Interaction and Inspiration. Finally, I will consider the idea of the death of locality and distance and what has actually changed and what has not when it comes to their current meanings, on a more interpretive level...|$|R
