5|$|After welding, {{a number}} of {{distinct}} regions can be identified in the weld area. The weld itself is called the fusion zone—more specifically, it <b>is</b> <b>where</b> <b>the</b> filler metal was laid during the welding process. The properties of the fusion zone depend primarily on the filler metal used, and its compatibility with the base materials. It is surrounded by the heat-affected zone, the area that had its microstructure and properties altered by the weld. These properties depend on the base material's behavior when subjected to heat. The metal {{in this area is}} often weaker than both the base material and the fusion zone, and is also where residual stresses are found.|$|E

5|$|Alastair Hudson, Professor of Equity and Law at Queen Mary, University of London, {{suggests}} {{the potential for}} a third class of secret trust.

If this is the case, the next-of-kin would be obliged to hold the property on trust and fulfil the dying person's wishes.|$|E
5|$|An {{overhead}} or penetration diving environment <b>is</b> <b>where</b> <b>the</b> diver {{enters a}} space from {{which there is}} no direct, purely vertical ascent to the safety of breathable atmosphere at the surface. Cave diving, wreck diving, ice diving and diving inside other natural or artificial underwater structures or enclosures are examples. The restriction on direct ascent increases the risk of diving under an overhead, and this is usually addressed by adaptations of procedures and use of equipment such as redundant breathing gas sources and guide lines to indicate the route to the exit.|$|E

5|$|Blaster Master has {{two modes}} of {{gameplay}} {{that depends on}} the situation and location of the player. The first mode <b>is</b> <b>where</b> <b>the</b> player controls SOPHIA in a two–dimensional platform mode; the second mode <b>is</b> <b>where</b> <b>the</b> player controls Jason while outside SOPHIA in either the same 2D platform mode or in a top-down perspective. Gameplay in the top-down perspective consists of a series of labyrinths in which players navigate and defeat enemies along the way. Gameplay is non-linear, and players must return to earlier levels in order to advance to later levels in the game. The objective is to complete all eight levels and destroy the mutants and their bosses with various weaponry such as guns, grenades, and special weapons.|$|E
5|$|E. coli {{and related}} {{bacteria}} possess {{the ability to}} transfer DNA via bacterial conjugation or transduction, which allows genetic material to spread horizontally through an existing population.

5|$|Electrons are {{identical}} particles because they cannot {{be distinguished from}} each other by their intrinsic physical properties. In quantum mechanics, this means that a pair of interacting electrons {{must be able to}} swap positions without an observable change to the state of the system. The wave function of fermions, including electrons, is antisymmetric, meaning that it changes sign when two electrons are swapped; that <b>is,</b> , <b>where</b> <b>the</b> variables r1 and r2 correspond to the first and second electrons, respectively. Since the absolute value is not changed by a sign swap, this corresponds to equal probabilities. Bosons, such as the photon, have symmetric wave functions instead.|$|E

5|$|However, {{the focal}} point of the {{painting}} is widely debated. Leo Steinberg argues that the orthogonals in the work are intentionally disguised so that the picture's focal center shifts.

More specifically, the crook of his arm <b>is</b> <b>where</b> <b>the</b> orthogonals of the windows and lights of the ceiling meet.|$|E

5|$|Just as {{the concept}} of the First World came about as a result of World War II, so did the European Union.

From the beginning of its inception, countries in the EU were judged by many standards, including economic ones. This <b>is</b> <b>where</b> <b>the</b> relation between globalization, the EU, and First World countries arises.
