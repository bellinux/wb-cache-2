Devon then serves Hilary with divorce papers and after Neil rejects her, Hilary suddenly changes her mind about loving Devon but he is hesitant to believe her. A drunken Neil causes trouble {{at a press conference}} forcing Devon to fire allowing Hilary to take over. Devon is suspicious when Ashley suddenly gives up her position at the research company to Hilary. When Jack and Neil form the Abbott-Winters Foundation to support recovery centers across the country, Hilary convinces Devon to donate $1 million to challenge Ashley. Hilary also fights for a seat {{on the board of the}} foundation and Devon convinces Neil not to hire her fearing the trouble she could cause. A furious Hilary announces plans to divorce Devon and take half his fortune but when Hilary ends up in the hospital again, he rushes to her side as Neville administers treatment. Though Neville believes his medicine is working, Hilary collapses in Devon's arms—she is dying. Devon fires Neville and hires another doctor to save his wife. When the victims of the fail <b>drug</b> <b>protocol</b> announce plans to sue, Hilary convinces Devon to settle with them to avoid escalated scandal. Devon, Hilary, Lily and Cane later support Neil when he reconnects with his estranged mother who dies shortly after their reunion. In September 2016, Devon attempts to bribe the GC Buzz to kill a story about Jack Abbott (Peter Bergman) allegedly abusing his wife Phyllis (Gina Tognoni) and it backfires when the tabloid runs a story about Devon bribing the press. To stop the stories' circulation, Devon buys the production company and plans to shut down production until Hilary convinces him to keep it on the air and just change the way they tell stories. Devon goes a step further and decides to make Hilary the lead anchor. However, Hilary becomes obsessed with keeping viewers happy and spiking ratings which clashes with Devon's wishes of telling stories without destroying lives. Devon enlist Hilary's new assistant Mariah Copeland (Camryn Grimes) to help keep Hilary on the straight and narrow. Hilary and Mariah clash over how to handle the revelation that her mother Sharon Newman (Sharon Case) has secretly been raising her ex-husband Nick's (Joshua Morrow) presumed dead son. When Hilary edits an interview with Sharon's husband Dylan McAvoy (Steve Burton) to smear Sharon to get back at Mariah, a furious Devon fires her. Despite a humiliating fall on air, Devon convinces Mariah to serve as a temporary replacement until he can find a permanent host as Hilary refuses to return to the job. Meanwhile, Devon and Hilary reconcile and they move into a new penthouse. When Lily reveals that Hilary lied to Devon about her several job offers in order to get him to rehire her, they discuss their trust issues and decide to start over, with honesty first. However, during a gala for the Abbott-Winters Foundation, Devon rejects Hilary when he discovers that Hilary also lied about being responsible for Mariah's accident and gets into a car accident. Fortunately, Devon survives but initially doesn't remember the incident due to a concussion. Devon regains his memory and dumps Hilary because of her constant lying. However, Devon convinces Hilary to co-host GC Buzz with Mariah. After weeks of back and forth, Devon is jealous when Hilary starts seeing Jordan Wilde (Darnell Kirkwood) and after she demands that he forgive her or divorce her -- the couple signs divorce papers. As part of Hilary's divorce settlement, Devon gives her complete control of GC Buzz with the stipulation that she can't fire anyone for a year -- to protect Mariah whom he is dating. In the meantime, Devon launches a new business venture with Neil. Soon after his divorce is finalized, Devon and Neil look to acquire Mergeron Enterprises from former Abbott family matriarch Dina (Marla Adams).|$|E

40|$|In {{the years}} since 2008, when the Supreme Court upheld the {{constitutionality}} of a commonly used lethal injection protocol in Baze v. Rees, states have shifted away from the approved protocol and turned towards new <b>drugs,</b> <b>drug</b> <b>protocols,</b> and <b>drug</b> sources to carry out state-sponsored executions by lethal injection. Even as states have shifted to new, untested protocols and less-regulated sources than they used in pre-Baze years, state legislatures have enacted and amended secrecy statutes that hide information about the <b>drug</b> <b>protocols</b> and sources of lethal injection drugs from the press, the public, and condemned prisoners. Meanwhile, {{a number of recent}} executions have gone awry, with executions lasting far longer than expected or causing apparent pain in prisoners being executed.

This Comment argues that state secrecy statutes concerning lethal injection drugs are unconstitutional because they impose on the public’s presumptive right of access to state-held information of this sort.

40|$|BACKGROUND DATA: Livers {{that have}} been exposed to a period of warm {{ischemia}} (WI) prior to transplantation (Tx) have an increased risk of primary non function (PNF), graft dysfunction and ischemic type biliary strictures all associated with Ischemia Reperfusion Injury (IRI). Our multifactorial biological modulation approach (Leuven <b>Drug</b> <b>Protocol</b> [LDP]) has been shown to eliminate PNF, improve liver function, reduce bile salt toxicity and increase recipient survival after transplantation of WI/IRI-damaged porcine livers. AIM: The identification of the molecular mechanisms responsible for the hepatoprotective effect of the LDP. METHODS: Porcine livers were exposed to 45 ' WI, cold stored (4 hrs), transplanted and either modulated (LDP-group, n = 3) or not (controls, n = 4). In the LDP-group, donor livers were flushed with streptokinase and epoprostenol prior to cold perfusion; recipients received IV glycine, α 1 -acid-glycoprotein, MAPKinase-inhibitor FR 167653, α-tocopherol, glutathione and apotransferrine upon graft reperfusion. Liver samples were taken before WI and 1 hour after reperfusion. Gene expression was determined by microarray and molecular pathways and key regulatory genes were identified. RESULTS: The number of differentially expressed genes between baseline and 1 hr after reperfusion was 686 in the LDP-group and 325 in controls. The extra genes in the LDP group belonged predominantly to molecular pathways related to cytokine activity, apoptosis and cell proliferation. We identified 7 genes (IL 6, IL 8, JUN, MMP 1, PTGS 2 /COX 2, SERPINE 1 and STAT 3) that were suppressed in the LDP group. These genes could be linked - in part - to the drugs administered. New potential drugs targets were identified based on (i) genes induced in the control group but left unaffected in the LDP group and (ii) by predicted interactions according to literature. CONCLUSIONS: The Leuven <b>Drug</b> <b>Protocol</b> primarily results in the suppression of inflammation regulating genes in IRI. Furthermore, the microarray technique helped to identify additional gene targets. Liver Transpl, 2011. © 2011 AASLD. status: publishe...|$|E
40|$|We {{develop a}} method for {{computing}} efficient patient-specific <b>drug</b> <b>protocols.</b> Using this method, we identify two general categories of anticancer <b>drug</b> <b>protocols,</b> depending on the temporal cycle parameters of the host and cancer cells: a one-time intensive treatment, or a series of nonintensive treatments. Our method {{is based on a}} theoretical and experimental work showing that treatment efficacy can be improved by determining the dosing frequency on the drug-susceptible target and host cell-cycle parameters. Simulating the patient’s pharmaco-dynamics in a simple model for cell population growth, we calculate the number of drug susceptible cells at every moment of therapy. Local search heuristics are then used to conduct a search for the desired solution, as defined by our criteria. These criteria include the patient’s state {{at the end of a}} predetermined time period, the number of cancer and host cells at the end of treatment, and the time to the patient’s cure. The process suggested here does not depend on the exact biological assumptions of the model, thus enabling its use in a more complex description of the system. We test three solution methods. Simulated annealing is compared to threshold acceptance and old bachelor acceptance, which are less known variants to this method. The conclusions concerning the three approximation methods are that good results can be achieved by choosing the proper parameters for each of the methods, but the computational effort required for achieving good results is much greater in simulated annealing than in the other methods. Also, a large number of iterations does not guarantee better solution quality, and resources would b...|$|R

40|$|SummaryAlthough DNA {{damaging}} {{agents have}} revolutionized chemotherapy against solid tumors, a narrow therapeutic window combined with severe side effects has limited their broader use. Here {{we show that}} RAD 001 (everolimus), a rapamycin derivative, dramatically enhances cisplatin-induced apoptosis in wild-type p 53, but not mutant p 53 tumor cells. The use of isogenic tumor cell lines expressing either wild-type mTOR cDNA or a mutant that does not bind RAD 001 demonstrates {{that the effects of}} RAD 001 are through inhibition of mTOR function. We further show that RAD 001 sensitizes cells to cisplatin by inhibiting p 53 -induced p 21 expression. Unexpectedly, this effect is attributed to a small but significant inhibition of p 21 translation combined with its short half-life. These findings provide the molecular rationale for combining DNA damaging agents with RAD 001, showing that a general effect on a major anabolic process may dramatically enhance the efficacy of an established <b>drug</b> <b>protocol</b> in the treatment of cancer patients with solid tumors...|$|E
