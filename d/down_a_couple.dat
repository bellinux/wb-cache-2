Running back Willis McGahee was tackled on the second down in the backfield for a loss of 2 yards. On third and 15, Dorsey {{completed}} a 20-yard pass to Andre Johnson for a 1st <b>down.</b> <b>A</b> <b>couple</b> of plays later, Dorsey again completed a pass to Andre Johnson for 11 yards. The next play saw Dorsey sacked again, this time for a 5-yard loss. The Miami offense failed to gain a first down and punter Freddie Capshaw punted the ball 43 yards. Ohio State received the ball on its one-yard line.|$|E
500|$|On 4 October, TV3 {{broadcast}} Vincent Browne's Big Presidential Debate. Gay Mitchell challenged Martin McGuinness on the [...] "fairytale" [...] that he {{left the}} IRA in 1974, asking him directly: [...] "If you (McGuinness) say you left the IRA in 1974 and persist in saying that when you didn’t; {{if you say you}} are living on the average industrial wage when you are drawing <b>down</b> <b>a</b> <b>couple</b> of hundred grand– how can people have confidence in your word?" [...] Moderator Vincent Browne later challenged Martin McGuinness' claims {{that he left}} the Provisional Irish Republican Army in 1974, producing eight books with alleged evidence claiming otherwise. McGuinness referenced this moment when he said in a later debate on the radio that people would blame him for the 1916 Rising if they {{could find a way to}} implicate him.|$|E
500|$|Tyler next {{appeared}} in Armageddon (1998), where {{she played the}} daughter of Bruce Willis' character and love interest of Ben Affleck's character. The film generated mixed reviews, {{but it was a}} box office success, earning $553million worldwide. The movie included the songs [...] "I Don't Want to Miss a Thing" [...] and [...] "What Kind of Love Are You On" [...] by Aerosmith. In a 2001 interview with The Guardian, she said that she initially turned down the role in Armageddon; [...] "I really didn't want to do it at first and I turned it <b>down</b> <b>a</b> <b>couple</b> of times, but the biggest reason I changed my mind was because I was scared of it. I wanted to try it for that very reason. I mean, I'm not really in this to do amazing things in my career – I just want it to be special when I make a movie." ...|$|E
5000|$|Bates once epitomized {{the image}} of hard-partying, sex-crazed athletes in the PBA. His Filipino {{teammates}} vividly recall times when Bates <b>downed</b> <b>a</b> <b>couple</b> of beers {{in the locker room}} before tip-off. It is believed {{that he was able to}} put up Wilt Chamberlain-like numbers in the bedroom, as well as on the court. Even his PBA nickname, [...] "Black Superman", contained a hint of innuendo.|$|R

500|$|Jeremy Thomas {{of music}} website 411 Mania called the track as [...] "incredibly in-your-face", commending Minaj for {{delivering}} [...] "one {{of the best}} flows we've seen from her since she showed up on Kanye West's 'Monster'." [...] Joel Meares of Time Out shared this view, adding that Minaj's rap verse was reminiscent of the times when Madonna's own songs were {{as good as the}} former's single [...] "Starships". The Village Voices Maura Johnston was also complimentary about Minaj, writing that, [...] " [...] lays <b>down</b> <b>a</b> <b>couple</b> of rhymes that are by no means the best in her vast catalog, but her sudden presence shows that the music isn't the song's biggest weakness." [...] Genevieve Koski of The A.V. Club also considered the rapper's performance as [...] "one of her better features in a while", and better than her inclusion in the lead single [...] "Give Me All Your Luvin'". Soderberg from Spin described the song as a [...] "rap track that positions Nicki Minaj, as the brash, pop subversive in the tradition of Madonna" [...] and criticized the latter's rapping, finding the vocals to be weak. Conversely, he appreciated Minaj's verses and vocal delivery, calling them [...] "witty" [...] and [...] "confident". He further wrote about Madonna's vocals in detail: ...|$|E
2500|$|On October 16, 2014, {{as part of}} a {{stand-up}} comedy routine in Philadelphia, Hannibal Buress addressed Cosby's legacy of [...] "talk down" [...] to young black men about their mode of dress and lifestyle. Buress criticized the actor's public moralizing by saying, [...] "Yeah, but you raped women, Bill Cosby, so that kind of brings you <b>down</b> <b>a</b> <b>couple</b> notches." [...] The audience appeared to respond to Buress's accusation as an incredulous joke before he encouraged everyone to [...] "Google 'Bill Cosby rape' [...] " [...] when they got home. Buress had been using the same Cosby routine for the previous six months with little response, but the October performance went viral after being posted on Philadelphia magazine's website. A media firestorm ensued, with numerous publications tackling the question of how Cosby had managed to maintain, as Buress called it in his routine, a [...] "teflon image" [...] despite {{more than a decade of}} public sex abuse accusations.|$|E
2500|$|When England {{arrived in}} Australia Ray Illingworth boasted {{of his new}} ball fast bowlers [...] "The Derbyshire Demon" [...] Alan Ward and [...] "The Abominable Snow Man" [...] John Snow. The [...] tall Ward was 'tall, lean, raw boned youngster with a fine pair of {{shoulders}} and powerful, rhythmical side-on action' compared to Frank Tyson, but suffered from assorted injuries and never made the expected impact in Test cricket. Instead he returned to England and the young Bob Willis was flown out to Australia as his replacement, though few people realised that this tall, gangling bowler with the chest on action would be England's fast bowling spearhead for the next 14 years. John Augustine Snow dominated the series with 31 wickets (22.83). Although {{the son of a}} country vicar who published two volumes of poetry, Snow revelled in his reputation as a big, fast bowler and emerged as Fred Trueman's successor in 1967-68 when he took a record 27 wickets (18.66) in the West Indies. He usually bowled within himself at fast-medium, but sent <b>down</b> <b>a</b> <b>couple</b> of quick balls every over as he varied his pace and Australia had no real answer to his fast, short pitched bowling. Snow had a reputation for being mercurial - he took only 7 wickets (71.57) in the state matches - strong-willed and difficult to handle, and his autobiography was suitably entitled Cricket Rebel. Keith Fletcher said [...] "In 1970/71 John Snow was at his peak, obtaining pace and movement off the seam and troubling all the upper-order batsmen". Ken Shuttleworth and Peter Lever provided good support to the two quick bowlers, Lever took 7/83 against the Rest of the World at the Oval, and Shuttleworth 5/47 in the First Test at Brisbane, but neither held down a regular Test place. Basil d'Oliveira helped with his tidy medium pace swing bowling and occasional off-spin. Illingworth himself was an off-spinner of nagging accuracy who contained batsmen rather than took wickets, conceding only 1.91 runs an over in Tests. If [...] "Illy" [...] was proof that spin bowlers mature slowly his partner Derek Underwood was a first class bowler from his teens and he would take his 100th Test wicket and 1,000th First Class wicket on the tour aged only 25. He bowled immaculate slow-medium spinners and used to say that bowling was a [...] "low mentality profession: plug away, line and length, until there's a mistake" [...] as sooner or later every batsmen would make a mistake. On damp English wickets he earned the nickname [...] "Deadly" [...] for his ability to make the ball leap and turn, as when he took 7/50 against Australia at The Oval in 1968 to win the match and square the series with five minutes to spare. The reserve spinner Don Wilson was Illingworth's old Yorkshire [...] "spin twin", but he and Underwood kept him out of the England team, like the other two he was an accurate bowler rather than a wicket-taker.|$|E
