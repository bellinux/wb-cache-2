40|$|AbstractThe {{present study}} {{evaluated}} the antinociceptive {{effect of the}} pro-inflammatory cytokines inhibitor <b>diacerein</b> in mice and its possible mechanism of action. The antinociception produced by <b>diacerein</b> was tested at different sites of action, moreover selective antagonists or agonists were used to identify the mechanism that {{may be involved in}} its antinociceptive action against acetic acid-induced visceral pain. <b>Diacerein</b> administered systemically (intraperitoneal [i. p. ] or intra-gastric [i. g. ] routes), supra-spinally (i. c. v.), spinally (i. t.) or peripherally (in association with the irritant agent) inhibited the visceral nociception induced by acetic acid in mice. Interestingly, <b>diacerein</b> treatment (25 mg/kg, i. p. or 50 mg/kg, i. g.) produced long-lasting (for up to 4 h) inhibition of acetic acid-induced nociception. Intraperitoneal treatment of mice with <b>diacerein</b> (25. 0 mg/kg) inhibited somatic nociception induced by i. t. injection of glutamate, NMDA, kainate, and trans-ACPD but not that caused by AMPA. <b>Diacerein</b> (5. 0 – 25. 0 mg/kg) also produced dose related inhibition of interleukin- 1 β (IL- 1 β) and tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-α) induced nociception. These results indicate that <b>diacerein</b> produces antinociception by inhibiting glutamatergic transmission through both ionotropic and metabotropic receptors as well as activity of pro-inflammatory cytokines...|$|E
40|$|This 9 -month {{pragmatic study}} {{compared}} 2 therapeutic regimens {{in the management}} of osteoarthritis of the hip and knee. Patients received either <b>diacerein</b> 100 mg/day plus standard osteoarthritic therapy for 6 months, followed by a 3 -month monitoring period without <b>diacerein,</b> or standard therapy alone for the entire 9 -month period. A total of 207 patients with osteoarthritis of the knee and hip were enrolled. Improvements in Lequesne's functional index and quality-of-life scores (revised Arthritis Impact Measurement Scales Health Status Questionnaire and Nottingham Health Profile), and decreases in nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug and analgesic consumption were significantly greater with <b>diacerein</b> plus standard therapy than with standard therapy alone. The overall assessment of therapy by patients was good or excellent for 60 % of those who received <b>diacerein</b> plus standard therapy, compared with 26 % who received standard therapy alone. Medical and paramedical procedures carried out in addition to those stipulated in the protocol (medical consultations, physiotherapy, nursing, etc.), osteoarthritisrelated, were fewer and less costly in the <b>diacerein</b> plus standard therapy group than in the standard therapy group. The average outpatient cost (in 1995 French francs) of osteoarthritis treatment in the standard therapy group was FF 2272 compared with FF 2360 in the <b>diacerein</b> plus standard therapy group.

40|$|The {{impact of}} <b>diacerein,</b> an {{effective}} cartilage targeted therapy {{that is used}} in patients with osteoarthritis, on the development and progression of chronic inflammatory arthritis was evaluated in a tumor necrosis factor (TNF) transgenic mouse model (Tg 197).

Treatment was initiated before the onset of arthritis and was continued for 5 weeks. A significant improvement in clinical symptoms was found in all three <b>diacerein</b> treated groups in comparison with untreated groups. Confirming these data, semiquantitative histopathologic analysis of the hind paws revealed a significant reduction not only in cartilage destruction but also in the extent of synovitis and bone erosion in <b>diacerein</b> treated groups in comparison with untreated groups. At the most effective dose tested (2 mg/kg daily), <b>diacerein</b> inhibited the onset of arthritis in 28 % and attenuated the progression of arthritis in 35 % of the Tg 197 mice. Comparative analyses showed <b>diacerein</b> to be more potent than methotrexate but not as effective as dexamethasone or anti-TNF agents in suppressing the progression of the TNF mediated arthritis in this model.

40|$|<b>Diacerein</b> is a {{symptomatic}} slow-acting drug in osteoarthritis (SYSADOA) with anti-inflammatory, anti-catabolic and pro-anabolic properties on cartilage and synovial membrane. It {{has also}} recently {{been shown to}} have protective effects against subchondral bone remodelling. Following the end of the revision procedure by the Pharmacovigilance Risk Assessment Committee of the European Medicines Agency, the European Society for Clinical and Economic Aspects of Osteoporosis and Osteoarthritis (ESCEO) constituted a panel of 11 experts to better define the real place of <b>diacerein</b> in the armamentarium for treating OA. Based on a literature review of clinical trials and meta-analyses, the ESCEO confirms that the efficacy of <b>diacerein</b> {{is similar to that of}} non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) after the first month of treatment, and superior to that of paracetamol. Additionally, <b>diacerein</b> has shown a prolonged effect on symptoms of several months once treatment was stopped. The use of <b>diacerein</b> is associated with common gastrointestinal disorders such as soft stools and diarrhoea, common mild skin reactions, and, uncommonly, hepatobiliary disorders. However, NSAIDs and paracetamol are known to cause potentially severe hepatic, gastrointestinal, renal, cutaneous and cardiovascular reactions. Therefore, the ESCEO concludes that the benefit-risk balance of <b>diacerein</b> remains positive in the symptomatic treatment of hip and knee osteoarthritis. Furthermore, similarly to other SYSADOAs, the ESCEO positions <b>diacerein</b> as a first-line pharmacological background treatment of osteoarthritis, particularly for patients in whom NSAIDs or paracetamol are contraindicated.

40|$|<b>Diacerein</b> {{seems to}} improve {{metabolic}} control and reduce inflammatory marker levels in individuals with {{type 2 diabetes}} mellitus (Type 2 DM), but for participants with chronic kidney disease (CKD) its effect is unknown. This study aimed to evaluate the effect of <b>diacerein</b> vs. placebo on urinary albumin/creatinine ratio (ACR), glomerular filtration rate (GFR), and inflammatory cytokines in type 2 DM participants with CKD. Blood pressure (BP) and metabolic control were secondary outcomes. This randomized, placebo-controlled, parallel trial of adjuvant treatment of type 2 DM with <b>diacerein</b> enrolled seventy-two participants with CKD, aged 30 - 80 years, with glycated hemoglobin levels from 53 - 97 mmol/mol (7. 0 - 11. 0 %), receiving angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors or angiotensin receptor blockers and antidiabetic agents. Participants randomized to <b>diacerein</b> or placebo were followed-up up to 90 days. Both groups had a marked reduction in ACR, {{but there was no}} effect on glomerular filtration rate. While the <b>diacerein</b> group had reduced TNF-α levels at the 75 th percentile with a borderline significance (P = 0. 05), there were no changes in the IL levels at the 75 th percentile. <b>Diacerein</b> prevented the increase in blood glucose to the level observed in the placebo group (P = 0. 04), improving metabolic control by 74 %, reducing 24 -hour diastolic BP, nighttime systolic and diastolic BP compared to the placebo group.

This study aimed to provide insights into the proposed beneficial effects of these agents and to assess {{the applicability of the}} C- 28 /I 2 cell line {{as a model for the}} evaluation of chondroprotective action. MethodsInterleukin- 1 beta (IL- 1 β) -stimulated C- 28 /I 2 cells were cultured in the presence of GlcN, curcumin, and <b>diacerein</b> prior to the evaluation of parameters such as viability, morphology and proliferation. The impact of GlcN, curcumin, and <b>diacerein</b> on gene expression was determined using quantitative real-time RT-PCR (qPCR). ResultsAt the transcriptional level, 5 mM GlcN and 50 μM <b>diacerein</b> increased the expression of cartilage-specific genes such as aggrecan (AGC) and collagen type II (COL 2), while reducing collagen type I (COL 1) mRNA levels. Moreover, the IL- 1 β-mediated shift in gene expression pattern was antagonized by GlcN and <b>diacerein.</b> These effects were associated with a significant reduction in cellular proliferation and the development of chondrocyte-specific cell morphology. In contrast, curcumin was not effective at lower concentrations but even damaged the cells at higher amounts. ConclusionsBoth GlcN and <b>diacerein</b> promoted a differentiated chondrocytic phenotype of immortalized human C- 28 /I 2 chondrocytes by altering proliferation, morphology, and COL 2 /COL 1 mRNA ratios.

40|$|SummaryObjectiveTo {{estimate}} the efficacy {{and safety of}} <b>diacerein</b> as a pain-reducing agent {{in the treatment of}} osteoarthritis (OA), using meta-analysis of published randomized placebo-controlled trials (RCTs). MethodsSystematic searches of the bibliographic databases Medline, Embase, Cinahl, Chemical Abstracts, Cochrane and Web of Science for RCTs concerning <b>diacerein</b> treatment of OA. Inclusion criteria: explicit statement about randomization to either <b>diacerein</b> or placebo, and co-primary outcomes being reduction in pain and improvement in function. Efficacy effect size (ES) was estimated using Hedges's standardized mean difference. Safety was measured via the risk ratio (RR) of patients having at least one episode of diarrhoea, or withdrawal due to adverse events. Trials were combined by using random-effects meta-analysis. Consistency was evaluated via the I-squared index. ResultsSix trials (seven sub-studies; 1533 patients) contributed to the meta-analysis, revealing a large degree of inconsistency among the trials (I 2 = 56 %) in regard to pain reduction: the combined ES was − 0. 24 [95 % confidence intervals (CI) : − 0. 39 to − 0. 08, P= 0. 003], favouring <b>diacerein.</b> The statistically significant improvement in function (P= 0. 01) was based on a small amount of heterogeneity (I 2 = 11 %), but presented a questionable clinical effect size (ES=− 0. 14). Risk of publication bias could not be excluded, and trials with duration of more than 6 months did not favour <b>diacerein.</b> There was an increased risk of diarrhoea with <b>diacerein</b> (RR= 3. 51 [2. 55 – 4. 83], P< 0. 0001), and some withdrawal from therapy following adverse events (RR= 1. 58 [1. 05 – 2. 36], P= 0. 03). ConclusionsDiacerein may be an alternative therapy for OA for patients who cannot take paracetamol or non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) because of adverse effects or lack of benefit.

Rats were divided into two groups: a control group that received saline solution (n = 16) and a group that received <b>diacerein</b> (80 mg/kg) daily (n = 10). After 4 weeks, the LV volume, cellular signaling, caspase 3 activity, and nuclear factor kappa B (NF-κB) transcription were compared between the two groups. After 4 weeks, end-diastolic and end-systolic LV volumes were reduced in the treatment group compared to the control group (p <. 01 and p <. 01, respectively). Compared to control rats, diacerein-treated rats exhibited less fibrosis in the LV (14. 65 %± 7. 27 % vs. 22. 57 %± 8. 94 %; p <. 01), lower levels of caspase- 3 activity, and lower levels of NF-κB p 65 transcription. Treatment with <b>diacerein</b> once a day for 4 weeks after MI improved ventricular remodeling by promoting lower end-systolic and end-diastolic LV volumes. <b>Diacerein</b> also reduced fibrosis in the LV.

Method I was developed using solvent pyridine with minimum processing steps which showed maximum absorbance at 435 nm and Beer’s law was obeyed in the concentration range from 4 - 20 μg/ml. In Method II a spectroscopic method was developed using 0. 1 N sodium hydroxide which showed λmax at 503 nm and Beer’s law was obeyed in the range of 10 - 50 mcg/ml. The result of analysis was validated statistically and by recovery studies, thus this methods of estimation of <b>diacerein</b> was found to be simple, precise and accurate...|$|E
