25|$|The firebox was {{separate}} from the boiler and was double walled, with a water jacket between them. Stephenson recognised that the hottest part of the boiler, and thus the most effective for evaporating water, was that surrounding the fire itself. This firebox was heated by radiant heat from the glowing coke, not just convection from the <b>hot</b> <b>exhaust</b> <b>gas.</b>|$|E
25|$|Rocket engines {{employ the}} {{principle}} of jet propulsion. The rocket engines powering rockets come in {{a great variety of}} different types; a comprehensive list can be found in rocket engine. Most current rockets are chemically powered rockets (usually internal combustion engines, but some employ a decomposing monopropellant) that emit a <b>hot</b> <b>exhaust</b> <b>gas.</b> A rocket engine can use gas propellants, solid propellant, liquid propellant, or a hybrid mixture of both solid and liquid. Some rockets use heat or pressure that is supplied from a source other than the chemical reaction of propellant(s), such as steam rockets, solar thermal rockets, nuclear thermal rocket engines or simple pressurized rockets such as water rocket or cold gas thrusters. With combustive propellants a chemical reaction is initiated between the fuel and the oxidizer in the combustion chamber, and the resultant hot gases accelerate out of a rocket engine nozzle (or nozzles) at the rearward-facing end of the rocket. The acceleration of these gases through the engine exerts force ("thrust") on the combustion chamber and nozzle, propelling the vehicle (according to Newton's Third Law). This actually happens because the force (pressure times area) on the combustion chamber wall is unbalanced by the nozzle opening; {{this is not the case}} in any other direction. The shape of the nozzle also generates force by directing the exhaust gas along the axis of the rocket.|$|E
2500|$|Rocket uses a multi-tubular boiler design. Previous {{locomotive}} boilers {{consisted of}} a single pipe surrounded by water (though the Lancashire Witch did have twin flues). Rocket has 25 copper fire-tubes that carry the <b>hot</b> <b>exhaust</b> <b>gas</b> from the firebox, through the wet boiler to the blast pipe and chimney. [...] This arrangement resulted in a greatly increased surface contact area of hot pipe with boiler water when compared to a single large flue. Additionally, radiant heating from the enlarged separate firebox helped deliver a further increase in steaming and hence boiler efficiency.|$|E
50|$|The fire warning {{appears to}} have been caused by an exhaust {{connector}} clamp failure. <b>Hot</b> <b>exhaust</b> <b>gases</b> were blown directly onto an overheat detector.|$|R
50|$|The {{efficiency}} of larger gas turbine plants {{can be enhanced}} by using a combined cycle, where the <b>hot</b> <b>exhaust</b> <b>gases</b> are used to generate steam which drives another turbo generator.|$|R
5000|$|Turbulent or hot airflow {{into the}} engine intake, e.g. use of reverse thrust at low forward speed, {{resulting}} in re-ingestion of hot turbulent air or, for military aircraft, ingestion of <b>hot</b> <b>exhaust</b> <b>gases</b> from missile firing.|$|R
2500|$|Almost all coal, petroleum, nuclear, geothermal, {{solar thermal}} electric, and waste {{incineration}} plants, {{as well as}} many natural gas power stations are thermal. Natural gas is frequently combusted in gas turbines as well as boilers. [...] The waste heat from a gas turbine, in the form of <b>hot</b> <b>exhaust</b> <b>gas,</b> can be used to raise steam, by passing this gas through a Heat Recovery Steam Generator (HRSG) the steam is then used to drive a steam turbine in a combined cycle plant that improves overall efficiency. Power stations burning coal, fuel oil, or natural gas are often called fossil-fuel power stations. [...] Some biomass-fueled thermal power stations have appeared also. Non-nuclear thermal power stations, particularly fossil-fueled plants, which do not use co-generation are sometimes referred to as conventional power stations.|$|E
2500|$|Rotor sealing. This {{is still}} a minor problem as the engine housing has vastly {{different}} temperatures in each separate chamber section. The different expansion coefficients of the materials leads to imperfect sealing. Additionally, {{both sides of the}} seals are exposed to fuel, and the design does not allow for controlling the lubrication of the rotors accurately and precisely. Rotary engines tend to be overlubricated at all engine speeds and loads, and have relatively high oil consumption and other problems resulting from excess oil in the combustion areas of the engine, such as carbon formation and excessive emissions from burning oil. By comparison, a piston engine has all functions of a cycle in the same chamber giving a more stable temperature for piston rings to act against. Additionally, only one side of the piston in a (four-stroke) piston engine is being exposed to fuel, allowing for oil to lubricate the cylinders from the other side. Piston engine components can also be designed to increase ring sealing and oil control as cylinder pressures and power levels increase. To overcome the problems in a Wankel engine of differences in temperatures between different regions of housing and side and intermediary plates, and the associated thermal dilatation inequities, a heat pipe has been used to transport heat from the hot to the cold parts of engine. The [...] "heat pipes" [...] effectively direct <b>hot</b> <b>exhaust</b> <b>gas</b> to the cooler parts of the engine, with resulting decreases in efficiency and performance. In small-displacement, charge-cooled rotor, air-cooled housing Wankel engines, that has been shown to reduce the maximum engine temperature from 231°C to 129°C, and the maximum difference between hotter and colder regions of engine from 159°C to 18°C.|$|E
5000|$|DEF is a 32.5% {{solution}} of urea, [...] When it is {{injected into the}} <b>hot</b> <b>exhaust</b> <b>gas</b> stream, the water evaporates and the urea thermally decomposes to form ammonia and isocyanic acid: ...|$|E
50|$|The {{turborocket}} design {{offers a}} mixture of benefits with drawbacks. It is not a true rocket, so it cannot operate in space. Cooling the engine {{is not a problem}} because the burner and its <b>hot</b> <b>exhaust</b> <b>gases</b> are located behind the turbine blades.|$|R
50|$|Catalytic oxidizers {{can also}} be {{in the form of}} recuperative heat {{recovery}} to reduce the fuel requirement. In this form of heat recovery, the <b>hot</b> <b>exhaust</b> <b>gases</b> from the oxidizer pass through an heat exchanger to heat the new incoming air to the oxidizer.|$|R
5|$|In Akagi predecessor, Hōshō, the <b>hot</b> <b>exhaust</b> <b>gases</b> vented by {{swivelling}} funnels posed {{a danger}} to the ship, and wind-tunnel testing had not suggested any solutions. Akagi and Kaga were given different solutions to evaluate in real-world conditions. Akagi was given two funnels on the starboard side. The larger, forward funnel was angled 30° below horizontal with its mouth facing the sea, and the smaller one exhausted vertically a little past the edge of the flight deck. The forward funnel was fitted with a water-cooling system to reduce the turbulence caused by <b>hot</b> <b>exhaust</b> <b>gases</b> and a cover that could be raised to allow the <b>exhaust</b> <b>gases</b> to escape if the ship developed a severe list and the mouth of the funnel touched the sea. Kaga adopted a version of this configuration when she was modernized during the mid-1930s.|$|R
50|$|On September 8, BP {{published}} {{a report that}} suggested that the ignition source was the released gas entering the air intakes of the diesel generators, and engulfing the deck area where the exhaust outlets for the main generators were emitting <b>hot</b> <b>exhaust</b> <b>gas.</b>|$|E

50|$|The {{simplest}} solution taps {{off some}} <b>hot</b> <b>exhaust</b> <b>gas</b> from the propulsion motor and routes it instead through the generator turbine.

50|$|A heat {{recovery}} steam generator (HRSG) is a steam boiler that uses <b>hot</b> <b>exhaust</b> <b>gases</b> {{from the gas}} turbines or reciprocating engines in a CHP plant to heat up water and generate steam. The steam, in turn, drives a steam turbine or is used in industrial processes that require heat.|$|R
50|$|In {{combustion}} processes, a wet {{analysis is}} performed when water vapor is {{taken into account}} {{as one of the}} products of the reaction. This analysis can be undertaken both on volumetric and mass basis. The wet analysis differs from the dry analysis as the latter considers that water vapor is condensed and removed from the <b>hot</b> <b>exhaust</b> <b>gases.</b>|$|R
50|$|Many {{vehicles}} have a close-coupled {{catalytic converter}} {{located near the}} engine's exhaust manifold. The converter heats up quickly, due to its exposure to the very <b>hot</b> <b>exhaust</b> <b>gases,</b> enabling it to reduce undesirable emissions during the engine warm-up period. This is achieved by burning off the excess hydrocarbons which result from the extra-rich mixture required for a cold start.|$|R
5000|$|Combined cycle {{plants have}} both a gas turbine fired by natural gas, and a steam boiler and steam turbine which use the <b>hot</b> <b>exhaust</b> <b>gas</b> {{from the gas}} turbine to produce electricity. This greatly {{increases}} the overall efficiency of the plant, and many new baseload power plants are combined cycle plants fired by natural gas.|$|E

5000|$|Controlling {{the amount}} of <b>hot</b> <b>exhaust</b> <b>gas</b> {{retained}} in the combustion chamber: VVA can control {{the amount of}} hot EGR within the combustion chamber, either by valve re-opening or changes in valve overlap. Balancing the percentage of cooled external EGR with the hot internal EGR generated by a VVA system, {{makes it possible to}} control the in-cylinder temperature.|$|E
50|$|Later {{applications}} {{included the}} blast furnace {{process known as}} hot blast and the Open hearth furnace also called Siemens regenerative furnace (which was used for making glass), where the <b>hot</b> <b>exhaust</b> <b>gases</b> from combustion are passed through firebrick regenerative chambers, which are thus heated. The flow is then reversed, so that the heated bricks preheat the fuel.|$|R
40|$|Report proposes use of shape-memory-alloy actuators, {{instead of}} {{hydraulic}} actuators, for aerodynamic flight-control surfaces. Actuator made of shape-memory alloy converts thermal energy into mechanical work by changing shape {{as it makes}} transitions between martensitic and austenitic crystalline phase states of alloy.

50|$|The {{plant is}} based on a gas turbine (a GE frame 6B) which can produce up to 45 MW of electricity. <b>Hot</b> <b>exhaust</b> <b>gases</b> from this gas turbine are ducted to a HRSG to raise steam. This HRSG has duct burners to {{increase}} steam output, which can be up to 180 tons of steam per hour. The plant was commissioned in 1999.|$|R
50|$|In many conflicts, it was usual to see {{infantry}} {{riding on}} the back of tanks, ready to jump off and provide support when necessary. Unfortunately, the design of many modern tanks makes this a dangerous practice. The turboshaft-powered M1 Abrams, for example, has such <b>hot</b> <b>exhaust</b> <b>gas</b> that nearby infantry have to be careful where they stand. Tanks can also be very vulnerable to well aimed artillery; well-coordinated air support and counter-battery artillery units can help overcome this.|$|E
50|$|In 1999 the Range Rover V8 {{received}} a new Bosch {{engine management system}} from the BMW 7 Series. This replaced the Lucas GEMS system. This engine {{is also known as}} the Bosch or Thor engine. It can easily be identified by its intake manifold. The diesel edition {{received a}}n EGR system, which came with a plastic inlet manifold. A modulator sends back part of the exhaust gas into the manifold, thus mixing <b>hot</b> <b>exhaust</b> <b>gas</b> via a vacuum pump into the cold air from the intercooler.|$|E

50|$|The flue {{system is}} {{composed}} of two flues, the inner flue and the outer flue. The outer flue draws air {{into the bottom of}} the sealed firebox to allow for combustion. The inner flue draws <b>hot</b> <b>exhaust</b> <b>gasses</b> from the top of the sealed firebox and vents them directly to the outside of the structure through either an adjacent wall or the roof.|$|R
40|$|Portions of the {{combined}} Apollo spacecraft (the command and service module and the lunar module) are subjected to the impingement of <b>hot</b> <b>exhaust</b> <b>gases</b> from the various propulsion systems of the modules. The configurations of the vehicles and the sources of impinging engine plumes are described. A typical Apollo mission is outlined. Protection and design-verification methods are discussed. Finally, recommendations are made for future spacecraft programs...|$|R
50|$|In about 1812, Trevithick {{designed}} the ‘Cornish boiler’. These were horizontal, cylindrical boilers {{with a single}} internal fire tube or flue passing horizontally through the middle. <b>Hot</b> <b>exhaust</b> <b>gases</b> from the fire passed through the flue thus increasing the surface area heating the water and improving efficiency. These types were installed in the Boulton and Watt pumping engines at Dolcoath and more than doubled their efficiency.|$|R
50|$|A {{magnetohydrodynamic}} generator (MHD generator) is a magnetohydrodynamic device that transforms thermal energy and kinetic energy into electricity. MHD generators {{are different from}} traditional electric generators in that they operate at high temperatures without moving parts. MHD was developed because the <b>hot</b> <b>exhaust</b> <b>gas</b> of an MHD generator can heat the boilers of a steam power plant, increasing overall efficiency. MHD was developed as a topping cycle {{to increase the efficiency}} of electric generation, especially when burning coal or natural gas. MHD dynamos are the complement of MHD propulsors, which have been applied to pump liquid metals and in several experimental ship engines.|$|E
50|$|Jet engines, {{particularly}} turbojets, are {{a type of}} {{gas turbine}} configured such {{that most of the}} work available results from the thrust of the hot exhaust gases. High bypass turbofans that are used in all modern commercial jetliners, and most modern military aircraft, get most of their thrust from the internal fan, which is powered by a gas turbine; turboprop engines are similar, but use an external propeller rather than an internal fan. The <b>hot</b> <b>exhaust</b> <b>gas</b> from a turboprop engine can give a small amount of thrust, but the propeller is the main source of thrust.|$|E
50|$|For {{aerodynamic}} {{reasons the}} flow goes sonic ("chokes") at the narrowest {{part of the}} nozzle, the 'throat'. Since {{the speed of sound}} in gases increases with the square root of temperature, the use of <b>hot</b> <b>exhaust</b> <b>gas</b> greatly improves performance. By comparison, at room temperature the speed of sound in air is about 340 m/s while the speed of sound in the hot gas of a rocket engine can be over 1700 m/s; much of this performance is due to the higher temperature, but additionally rocket propellants are chosen to be of low molecular mass, and this also gives a higher velocity compared to air.|$|E
50|$|Heat engines {{generate}} {{mechanical power}} by extracting energy from heat flows, {{much as a}} water wheel extracts mechanical power from a flow of mass falling through a distance. Engines are inefficient, so more heat energy enters the engine than comes out as mechanical power; the difference is waste heat which must be removed. Internal combustion engines remove waste heat through cool intake air, <b>hot</b> <b>exhaust</b> <b>gases,</b> and explicit engine cooling.|$|R
50|$|The {{original}} funnel was a straight, cylindrical {{affair that}} was designed to resist a nuclear blast, but this was prone to down-draughting and did not clear the <b>hot</b> <b>exhaust</b> <b>gasses</b> particularly well. It was replaced by a heightened, raked, streamlined version with a characteristic domed top. This was incorporated in later build vessels, and in all of the subsequent Rothesay class. Only Scarborough retained the stubby vertical funnel throughout her career.|$|R
25|$|When the {{pressure}} of the engine's intake air is increased, its temperature also increases. In addition, heat soak from the <b>hot</b> <b>exhaust</b> <b>gases</b> spinning the turbine will also heat the intake air. The warmer the intake air, the less dense, and the less oxygen available for the combustion event, which reduces volumetric efficiency. Not only does excessive intake-air temperature reduce efficiency, it also leads to engine knock, or detonation, which is destructive to engines.|$|R
