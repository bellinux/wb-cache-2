The ambulance transported him to the Emergency Hospital where he died a few minutes later.” Édouard Beaupré died on July 3, 1904 from a pulmonary hemorrhage at age 23. Airne Benard, who acted as Édouard’s agent, had the body embalmed. Even {{at the time of his}} death, doctors determined that Beaupré was still growing.|$|E
