5|$|Assessment of {{intellectual}} functioning including memory testing can further characterise {{the state of}} the disease. Medical organisations have created diagnostic criteria to ease and standardise the diagnostic process for practising physicians.

5|$|Optical {{heterodyne}} detection {{is used for}} coherent Doppler lidar measurements capable of detecting very weak light scattered in the atmosphere and monitoring wind speeds with <b>high</b> <b>accuracy.</b> It has application in optical fiber communications, in various high resolution spectroscopic techniques, and the self-heterodyne method {{can be used to}} measure the linewidth of a laser.|$|E
30|$|These {{confidence}} levels {{indicate that}} the performance of all six methods based on the fitted normal distribution and SQP showed <b>higher</b> <b>accuracy</b> than the other five in Problem I, in Problem II PS showed <b>higher</b> <b>accuracy</b> than the other five. But in the Problem III hybrid technique PS-SQP showed <b>higher</b> <b>accuracy</b> than the other five solvers.|$|R

30|$|In Table 3, the LNBNN with SIFT {{gives the}} highest {{correction}} rate compared to others for the speech classification problem. In the ISOLET database, LNBNN reaches 72.8  % correct classified samples, then random forest (64.4  %) and naïve Bayes (64.2  %). Especially, in English Isolated digits database, the LNBNN classifies correctly accounting for 96.2  %, then random forest reaches {{the rate of}} 70.7  %. The most apparent difference between LNBNN and other approaches is in JVPD and Vietnamese Places database. The LNBNN reaches the <b>highest</b> <b>accuracy</b> at 96.9  % and the second <b>highest</b> <b>accuracy</b> at 62.4  % in Random Forest on the former and LNBNN reaches the <b>highest</b> <b>accuracy</b> at 95.0  % and the second <b>highest</b> <b>accuracy</b> at 78.5  % in Random Forest on the later. Especially, in 20 first classes of TMW database, LNBNN in combination with SIFT classifies correctly all samples, while the second <b>highest</b> <b>accuracy</b> is 69.0 of Random Forest and SVM has the lowest accuracy (8.5). Table 3 also shows that SVM has the lowest accuracy rate for all database when using quantized SIFT features.|$|R
5|$|On the average, {{space is}} {{observed}} {{to be very}} nearly flat (close to zero curvature), meaning that Euclidean geometry is empirically true with <b>high</b> <b>accuracy</b> {{throughout most of the}} Universe. Spacetime also appears to have a simply connected topology, in analogy with a sphere, at least on the length-scale of the observable Universe. However, present observations cannot exclude the possibilities that the Universe has more dimensions and that its spacetime may have a multiply connected global topology, in analogy with the cylindrical or toroidal topologies of two-dimensional spaces.|$|E
5|$|The orbital {{properties}} of Triton were already determined with <b>high</b> <b>accuracy</b> in the 19th century. It {{was found to}} have a retrograde orbit, at a very high angle of inclination to the plane of Neptune's orbit. The first detailed observations of Triton were not made until 1930. Little was known about the satellite until Voyager 2 flew by in 1989.|$|E
5|$|Gliese 3634 b {{was one of}} {{a sample}} of over 300 very-low-mass stars {{targeted}} by astronomers in search of planets that may orbit such stars. Using the <b>High</b> <b>Accuracy</b> Radial Velocity Planet Searcher (HARPS) at La Silla Observatory in Chile, six years of radial velocity data led the astronomers in the discovery of eleven other planets. After these discoveries, the astronomers chose to refocus their search on short-period planets, hoping to follow up after discoveries using the radial velocity method with a search for planets that also transited, or crossed in front of, their host stars as seen from Earth.|$|E
50|$|In models using large corpora and a {{high number}} of dimensions, the skip-gram model yields the <b>highest</b> overall <b>accuracy,</b> and {{consistently}} produces the <b>highest</b> <b>accuracy</b> on semantic relationships, as well as yielding the <b>highest</b> syntactic <b>accuracy</b> in most cases. However, the CBOW is less computationally expensive and yields similar accuracy results.|$|R
40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{a method of}} creating a rapid tool for injection moulding, which can produce components of <b>higher</b> <b>accuracy</b> and better surface finish. Main investigation focuses on the rapid tooling process of a complex part using high speed machining and Electro Discharge Machining (EDM) to produce an injection mould of <b>higher</b> <b>accuracy</b> and surface finish than that achieved by a rapid prototyping based tooling process. Results demonstrate how short-run injection moulds with a <b>higher</b> <b>accuracy</b> could be made in a much faster way using high speed machining and EDM with a lead-time that can match any other methods of rapid tooling process...|$|R

5|$|The {{approach}} in the New World, where anthropologists began to consider more fully the role of astronomy in Amerindian civilizations, was markedly different. They had access to sources that the prehistory of Europe lacks such as ethnographies and the historical records of the early colonizers. Following the pioneering example of Anthony Aveni, this allowed New World archaeoastronomers to make claims for motives which in the Old World would have been mere speculation. The concentration on historical data led to some claims of <b>high</b> <b>accuracy</b> that were comparatively weak {{when compared to the}} statistically led investigations in Europe.|$|E
5|$|Elephants exhibit mirror self-recognition, an {{indication}} of self-awareness and cognition that has also been demonstrated in some apes and dolphins. One study of a captive female Asian elephant suggested the animal was capable of learning and distinguishing between several visual and some acoustic discrimination pairs. This individual was even able to score a <b>high</b> <b>accuracy</b> rating when re-tested with the same visual pairs a year later. Elephants are among the species known to use tools. An Asian elephant has been observed modifying branches and using them as flyswatters. Tool modification by these animals is not as advanced as that of chimpanzees. Elephants are popularly thought of as having an excellent memory. This could have a factual basis; they possibly have cognitive maps {{to allow them to}} remember large-scale spaces over long periods of time. Individuals appear {{to be able to keep}} track of the current location of their family members.|$|E
