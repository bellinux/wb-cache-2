500|$|Creangă's {{contribution}} to literature also covers {{a series of}} didactic fables written as lively dialogues, among them [...] "The Needle and the Sledge Hammer", in which the objects of traditional metalworking scold the byproducts of their work for having forgotten their lowly origin. The inspiration behind this theme was identified by Călinescu as [...] "The Story of a Gold Coin", written earlier by Creangă's Junimist colleague Vasile Alecsandri. A similar piece, [...] "The Flax and the Shirt", reveals the circuit of fibers from weed-like plants into recycled cloth, leading {{to the conclusion that}} [...] "all things are not what they seem; they were something else once, they are something else now;—and shall become something else." [...] The technique employed by Creangă has the <b>flax</b> <b>plant</b> teaching the less knowledgeable textile, a dialogue which Călinescu likened to that between old women in a traditional society. Included alongside the two stories were: Pâcală, a writing which, Mircea Braga argued, is not as much didactic as it is a study in dialogue; [...] "The Bear Tricked by the Fox", which uses legendary and humorous elements in an attempt to explain why bears are the tail-less species among mammals; and Cinci pâini ("Five Loafs of Bread"), which serves as a condemnation of greed.|$|E

In the present work, we investigated expression alterations of microRNAs in flax (Linum usitatissimum L.) plants under Al stress. Flax seedlings of resistant (TMP 1919 and G 1071 / 4 _k) and sensitive (Lira and G 1071 / 4 _o) to Al cultivars and lines {{were exposed to}} AlCl 3 solution for 4 and 24 hours. Twelve small RNA libraries were constructed and sequenced using Illumina platform. In total, 97 microRNAs from 18 conserved families were identified. miR 319, miR 390, and miR 393 revealed expression alterations associated with Al treatment of <b>flax</b> <b>plants.</b> Moreover, for miR 390 and miR 393, the alterations were distinct in sensitive and resistant to Al genotypes. Expression level changes of miR 319 and miR 390 were confirmed using qPCR analysis. In flax, potential targets of miR 319 are TCPs, miR 390 –TAS 3 and GRF 5, and miR 393 –AFB 2 -coding transcripts. TCPs, TAS 3, GRF 5, and AFB 2 participate in regulation of plant growth and development. The involvement of miR 319, miR 390, and miR 393 in response to Al stress in flax was shown {{here for the first}} time.

40|$|The {{influence}} of crop rotation and wheather {{conditions on the}} Fusarium population in soil and on Fusarium wilt of flax was examined in the Institute of Native Natural Fibres in 1968 - 1975.

Fusarium population in soil increased after <b>planting</b> <b>flax,</b> wheat, barley and sugar-beet, and decreased or did not change after rape, hemp, potato and leguminous plants. The crop rotation significantly influenced the composition of the Fusarium population as far as species are concerned. The highest wilt infection of flax was found in plantings after flax, sugarbeet and wheat and the weakest in plantings after rape. A six-year crop rotation was sufficient to eliminate the wilt pathogen from infested soil. But on flax-sick soil the process of biological disinfestation proceeded more slowly and a seven-year interval between flax crops was too short...|$|R

5000|$|The {{most common}} textile in ancient Egypt was flax.

Aside from this, other animal based products, such as animal pelts, were reserved for priests and eventually saw adoption by only the highest class of ancient Egyptian citizenry. Linen is also light, strong and flexible which made it ideal for life in the warm climate, wherein abrasion and heat would wear and tear at any fabric worn by its people. Thus, aside from this small minority, every ancient Egyptian used linen as their predominant textile.|$|E
