5|$|Unfortunately, Daley's theory—that it can {{be better}} to get a sum X immediately, rather than getting over many years a sum Y that is {{substantially}} larger than X—assumes something that cannot be assumed. It assumes that <b>governments</b> <b>will</b> prudently husband sudden surges of revenue from the lease or sale of assets.|$|E

25|$|In essence, {{the lesson}} {{learned is that}} <b>governments</b> <b>will</b> use {{legislative}} and judicial means to thwart attempts to change the economic system, even when conducted by non-violent means.

25|$|<b>Governments</b> <b>will</b> tend {{to produce}} laws and {{policies}} that {{are close to the}} views of the median voter—with half to their left and the other half to their right. This is not actually a desirable outcome as it represents the action of self-interested and somewhat unaccountable political elites competing for votes. Anthony Downs suggests that ideological political parties are necessary to act as a mediating broker between individual and governments. Downs laid out this view in his 1957 book An Economic Theory of Democracy.|$|E

25|$|The Tokyo Conference on Afghanistan, held on 8 July 2012 was the civilian-diplomatic bookend to NATO’s 2012 May {{summit in}} Chicago, where the {{alliance}} confirmed plans to withdraw foreign combat troops {{by the end}} of 2014 and pledged about $4 billion a year to pay for ongoing training, equipment and financial support for Afghanistan’s security forces. In exchange for pledges from the Afghan government to combat corruption $16 billion {{over the next four years}} for civilian projects such as roads to schools or projects aimed to strengthen the rule of law were pledged by the some 70 nations attending the conference. The reconstruction and development aid was pledged for the timeframe through 2015, but under the condition that the Afghan government reduce corruption before receiving all of the money. In the so-called Tokyo Framework of Mutual Accountability foreign <b>governments</b> <b>will</b> assure Afghanistan a steady stream of financing in exchange for stronger anticorruption measures and the establishment of the rule of law.

25|$|During {{the last}} few days the representatives of the German Government and His Majesty's Government in the United Kingdom have been engaged in conversations, the primary purpose of which has been to prepare the way for the holding of a general conference {{on the subject of the}} {{limitation}} of naval armaments. I have now much pleasure in notifying your Excellency of the formal acceptance by His Majesty's Government in the United Kingdom of the proposal of the German Government discussed at those conversations that the future strength of the German navy in relation to the aggregate naval strength of the Members of the British Commonwealth of Nations should be in the proportion of 35:100. His Majesty's Government in the United Kingdom regard this proposal as a contribution of the greatest importance to the cause of future naval limitation. They further believe that the agreement which they have now reached with the German government, and which they regard as a permanent and definite agreement as from to-day between the two <b>Governments,</b> <b>will</b> facilitate the conclusion of a general agreement on the subject of naval limitation between all the naval Powers of the world.|$|E

500|$|The book {{states that}} Seitz, Singer, Nierenberg and Robert Jastrow were all {{fiercely}} anti-communist and they viewed government regulation {{as a step}} towards socialism and communism. The authors argue that, {{with the collapse of}} the Soviet Union, they looked for another great threat to free market capitalism and found it in environmentalism. They feared that an over-reaction to environmental problems would lead to heavy-handed government intervention in the marketplace and intrusion into people's lives. Oreskes and Conway state that the longer the delay the worse these problems get, and the more likely it is that <b>governments</b> <b>will</b> need to take the draconian measures that conservatives and market fundamentalists most fear. They say that Seitz, Singer, Nierenberg and Jastrow denied the scientific evidence, contributed to a strategy of delay, and thereby helped to bring about the situation they most dreaded. The authors have a strong doubt about the ability of the media to differentiate between false truth and the actual science in question; however, they stop short of endorsing censorship in the name of science. The journalistic norm of balanced reporting has helped, according to the authors, to amplify the misleading messages of the contrarians. Oreskes and Conway state: [...] "small numbers of people can have large, negative impacts, especially if they are organised, determined and have access to power".|$|E
