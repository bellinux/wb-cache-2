40|$|While {{the demand}} for the {{performance}} <b>evaluation</b> <b>of</b> <b>proposals</b> using real hardware is ever increasing, the lineup of wireless testbeds focuses on IEEE 802. 11 -based WLAN, and lacks cellular communication environments despite of their popularity. We argue that research community needs a wireless testbed targeted on cellular technologies. To this end, this paper proposes a novel wireless testbed, dubbed Cell-Lab, which is developed to evaluate a wide spectrum <b>of</b> <b>proposals</b> in cellular environments. Cell-Lab resolves a cost problem, which is a decisive barrier to the deployment of cellular network testbed, by adopting a low-cost femtocell base station instead of conventional one. To support both virtualization and programmability as basic features, we integrate all the cellular network entities into a femtocell base station, and introduce a separate controller that performs virtualization and controls a femtocell base station. By means of Cell-Lab, researchers {{will be able to}} experiment their proposals under realistic cellular network conditions [...] INTRODUCTIONช A recent trend in the networking research area is the increasing demand on the performance <b>evaluation</b> <b>of</b> <b>proposals</b> by real prototypes or testbeds. That is, we need to run proposals on network testbeds for realistic evaluation. Ther...|$|R
