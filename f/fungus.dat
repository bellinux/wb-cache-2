5|$|Amanita gemmata is a {{mycorrhizal}} <b>fungus,</b> {{meaning it}} forms a mutually beneficial relationship with the roots of compatible host plants. Through the association, the plant provides the <b>fungus</b> with a carbon source, and the <b>fungus</b> provides the plant with several benefits such as nutrients and protection from pathogens. Largent and collaborators (1980) document mycorrhizal associations of A.gemmata with Manzanita (Arctostaphylos spp.) and Lodgepole Pine (Pinus contorta), and Nieto and Carbone with Maritime Pine (Pinus pinaster) in Spain. The <b>fungus</b> favours sandy and slightly acidic soils, and is often found in association with Norway Spruce (Picea abies). The mushroom grows either singly, scattered, or in groups in coniferous and mixed forests, especially along paths and roads.|$|E

40|$|AbstractEctomycorrhizal <b>fungi,</b> a {{group of}} {{widespread}} symbiotic <b>fungi</b> with plant, obtain carbon source from trees and improve plant mineral nutrient uptake with their widespread hyphal network. Ectomycorrhizal <b>fungi</b> {{can be used as}} inoculants to improve the survival rates of plantation. Saprophytic <b>fungi</b> use the nutrition from the debris of plant or animals, {{and it is difficult to}} distinguish the saprophytic and ectomycorrhizal <b>fungi</b> by morphological and anatomic methods. In this research, the differences of stable carbon and nitrogen isotopic compositions of these <b>fungi</b> were analyzed. The results showed that the abundances of 13 C of were higher than those of ectomycorrhizal <b>fungi</b> and the abundances of 15 N of saprophytic <b>fungi</b> were lower than those of ectomycorrhizal <b>fungi.</b> Such differences of stable carbon and nitrogen isotopic compositions between ectomycorrhizal <b>fungi</b> and saprophytic <b>fungi</b> can be ascribed to their different nutrition sources and ecological functions. These results collectively indicate that stable carbon and nitrogen isotopic compositions are an effective proxy for distinguishing between ectomycorrhizal and saprophytic <b>fungi...</b>|$|R

5|$|A {{nutritional}} {{analysis of}} P.indusiatus (based on specimens collected from Nigeria) {{determined that the}} egg stage of the <b>fungus</b> contains (per 100g of <b>fungus,</b> dry weight) 33.6g of crude protein, 1.66g of fat, and 3.98g of carbohydrates. The egg stage was also measured to comprise 20.9g dietary fibre, and 88.76% moisture. The high levels of protein and fibre (which are comparable to values found in meat and vegetables, respectively) suggest that the egg form of P.indusiatus is a good food source. The concentration of several mineral elements, including potassium, sodium, and iron, was also favourable compared to fruits and vegetables, although the mineral composition in the <b>fungus</b> is dependent on their corresponding concentrations in the soil in which they grow.|$|E

40|$|Background: Dematiaceous <b>fungi</b> appear {{brown in}} tissue section due to melanin in their cell walls. When the brown color {{is not seen}} on routine H and E and culture is not available, {{differentiation}} of dematiaceous <b>fungi</b> from other <b>fungi</b> is difficult on morphology alone. Aims and Objective: To study if melanin production by dematiaceous <b>fungi</b> can help differentiate them from other types of <b>fungi.</b> Materials and Methods: Fifty tissue sections of various fungal infections and 13 smears from cultures of different species of <b>fungi</b> were stained with Masson Fontana stain to assess melanin production. The tissue sections included biopsies from 26 culture-proven <b>fungi</b> and 24 biopsies of filamentous <b>fungi</b> diagnosed on morphology alone with no culture confirmation. Results: All culture-proven dematiaceous <b>fungi</b> and Zygomycetes showed strong positivity in sections and culture smears. Aspergillus sp showed variable positivity and intensity. Cryptococcus neoformans showed strong positivity in tissue sections and culture smears. Tissue sections of septate filamentous <b>fungi</b> (9 / 15), Zygomycetes (4 / 5), and <b>fungi</b> with both hyphal and yeast morphology (4 / 4) showed positivity for melanin. The septate filamentous <b>fungi</b> negative for melanin were from biopsy samples of fungal sinusitis including both allergic and invasive fungal sinusitis and colonizing fungal balls. Conclusion: Melanin is produced by both dematiaceous and non-dematiaceous <b>fungi.</b> Masson-Fontana stain cannot reliably differentiate dematiaceous <b>fungi</b> from other filamentous <b>fungi</b> like Aspergillus sp; however, absence of melanin in the hyphae {{may be used to}} rule out dematiaceous <b>fungi</b> from other filamentous <b>fungi.</b> In the differential diagnosis of yeast <b>fungi,</b> Cryptococcus sp can be differentiated from Candida sp by Masson-Fontana stain in tissue sections...|$|R

5|$|Although the <b>fungus</b> {{is one of}} {{the most}} common in Central Europe, the species was not validly {{described}} until 1968 by German mycologist Frieder Gröger. Before this, L.deterrimus was regarded as a variety of L.deliciosus (L.deliciosus var. piceus, described by Miroslav Smotlacha in 1946). After Roger Heim and A.Leclair described L.semisanguifluus in 1950, this <b>fungus</b> was referred to as the latter. L.fennoscandicus was separated from L.deterrimus in 1998 by Annemieke T.

5|$|Amanita aestivalis is a {{mycorrhizal}} species, {{meaning it}} forms a mutualistic relationship in which the vegetative hyphae of the <b>fungus</b> grow around and enclose the tiny roots of trees and shrubs. In this way, the plant is better able to absorb phosphorus and other soil nutrients, while the <b>fungus</b> receives moisture, protection, and nutritive byproducts of the plant's metabolism. Fruit bodies of the <b>fungus</b> grow {{on the ground in}} deciduous, coniferous, and mixed forests. A preference has been noted for oak woods containing Tsuga or Pinus species, as well as beech wood with Picea, Abies, and Betula. Fruit bodies typically appear from late June until autumn. In North America, it has been found in the states of New England, as well as Alabama, New York, and Virginia. The distribution extends north to the southeastern provinces of Canada and south to Florida.|$|E
5|$|Ascocoryne sarcoides is {{a species}} of <b>fungus</b> in the family Helotiaceae. The species name {{is derived from the}} Greek sarkodes (fleshy). Formerly known as Coryne sarcoides, its taxonomical history has been {{complicated}} by the fact that it may adopt both sexual and asexual forms. Colloquially known as jelly drops or the purple jellydisc, this common <b>fungus</b> appears as a gelatinous mass of pinkish or purple-colored discs. Distributed widely in North America, Europe and Asia, A.sarcoides is a saprobic <b>fungus</b> and grows in clusters on the trunks and branches of a variety of dead woods. Field studies suggest that colonization by A.sarcoides of the heartwood of black spruce confers some resistance to further infection by rot-causing fungi. A.sarcoides contains the antibiotic compound ascocorynin, shown in the laboratory to inhibit the growth of several Gram-positive bacteria.|$|E

5|$|Auriscalpium vulgare, {{commonly}} known as the pinecone mushroom, the cone tooth, or the ear-pick <b>fungus,</b> is a species of <b>fungus</b> in the family Auriscalpiaceae of the order Russulales.

The <b>fungus</b> is widely distributed in Europe, Central America, North America, and temperate Asia.

The C 1 cellulases produced by only the whiterot <b>fungi</b> were more unstable than those of the Cx to pH and temperature changes. Sulfhydryl groups apparently are not active sites for any of the cellulases. Degradation of carboxymethylcellulose by Cx was similar for the four <b>fungi</b> and proceeded in a random manner; degradation of microcrystalline cellulose by C 1 was in an endwise manner, and evidently acts as a ß- 1 - 4 -glucan cellobiohydrolase. ß-glucosidase produced by the four <b>fungi</b> hydrolyzed the cellulase breakdown products to glucose...|$|R
