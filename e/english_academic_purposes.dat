The delivery of ESP in Indonesia is facing some challenges yet many prospects are also occurring to some extent. The advancement of technology has been facilitating the teaching of ESP which is undoubtedly essential as supporting devices in the English Language Teaching. The big five phases of ESP development according to Hutchinson and Waters are parts of the process into a perfect accomplishment in teaching this subject. The methodology is designed to be a learner-centered where the students or learners should be more active in responding to every single materials brought into class. Teachers should function as facilitator only that mostly giving guidance during the learning process. Some recommendations are imposed to have a better delivery in the future. To maximize the output, materials should be specifically designed based on the needs...|$|E

Vocabulary acquisition is important for <b>English</b> for <b>Academic</b> <b>Purposes</b> students, given the vocabulary demands of academic language. The Academic Word List (Coxhead, 2000) has been shown to include important vocabulary in written academic texts, and has become a standard part of <b>English</b> for <b>Academic</b> <b>Purposes</b> curricula and pedagogical materials. Although explicit vocabulary instruction is important, research has shown that large amounts of vocabulary may be acquired incidentally by attending to meaning. Classroom instructio...|$|R

40|$|The {{definitions}} {{and methods of}} ESP vary. ESP is focused on practical outcomes and among its characteristics are: {{the fact that it}} is designed to meet specific needs; it is related to or designed for specific disciplines; it is likely to be designed for adult learners, intermediate or advanced students, it should be centered on the language (grammar, lexis, register), skills discourse and genres appropriate to these activities. The ESP classification by professional area shows that <b>English</b> for (<b>Academic)</b> Legal <b>Purposes</b> is one of the branches of <b>English</b> for <b>Academic</b> <b>Purposes,</b> which consists of <b>English</b> for (<b>Academic)</b> Science and Technology, <b>English</b> for (<b>Academic)</b> Medical <b>Purposes</b> and <b>English</b> for Management, Finance and Economics.

40|$|AbstractUpon faculty request, {{information}} literacy instruction was fully integrated into an <b>English</b> for <b>Academic</b> <b>Purposes</b> course for non-native English speaking students pursuing a medical degree at a U.

Adopting the flipped classroom modality, librarians designed modules to meet the students' {{information literacy}} needs while adapting the content to the course syllabus. Content was uploaded to the learning management system, Canvas. Readings, online tutorials, quizzes and assignments were created to achieve the outcomes of each session. Completion of information literacy modules is factored in the overall grades {{of students in the}} <b>English</b> for <b>Academic</b> <b>Purposes</b> course. This paper will outline the design, implementation, and assessment of information literacy sessions and will highlight the importance of collaboration between faculty and librarians to set a common ground and reach expected outcomes.

40|$|This project aims {{to develop}} an {{improved}} tool for the testing of academic writing skills of international students for use within the School of Languages <b>English</b> for <b>academic</b> <b>Purposes</b> programmes and beyond. At present, a lack of harmonisation of testing procedures on non-credit-bearing programmes within the School means that test results are difficult to compare and evaluate. Additionally, work within the EAP (<b>English</b> for <b>Academic</b> <b>Purposes)</b> and Writing Assessment communities has suggested {{that there is a}} need for a better fit between assessment procedures currently employed in many HEIs and the academic writing process (Hamp-Lyons 1991; Cushing Wiegle 2002). The project seeks to address these issues through the development and validation of more processed-based approaches to writing assessment (Cho 2003) to be used within the pre-sessional <b>English</b> for <b>Academic</b> <b>Purposes</b> programme. The experience gained in test development and evaluation will lead to the creation of a useful model for assessment development for other non-credit-bearing programmes within the School. Further benefits of the project are expected to include enhancement of student learning through greater understanding of their progress; a fuller diagnosis for teachers of student writing abilities; and clearer information to academic subject departments about their new students’ writing skills...|$|R

Findings indicate that misformation accounted {{for the majority of the}} total grammatical errors identified followed by omission and addition.

Through a critical review of the literature and a discussion of the key issues arising, illustrated by practical examples where appropriate, the article aims to demonstrate that for a number of pedagogical and practical reasons an EGAP rather than an ESAP approach is the most appropriate approach in most EAP contexts.
