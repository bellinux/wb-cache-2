During his electoral campaign, Tsiranana was able to count on the support of the Malagasy National Front (FNM), led by Merina who had left Malagasy Action, and especially on the support of the High Commissioner André Soucadaux, who saw Tsiranana as the most reasonable of the nationalists seeking election. Thanks to this support and the following which he had built up over the previous five years, Tsiranana was successfully <b>eleted</b> as deputy for the western region, with 253,094 of the 330,915 votes.|$|R

He added that Márkus [...] "was lack of knowledge and diligence". In contrast, other contemporaries argued that Márkus had [...] "classical education, brilliant oratorical skills and extraordinary working capacity".|$|E

Alexander, together with Professor Józef Bánóczi, later edited a seminal series of books on philosophers, the Filosofiai Irók Tára, for which he did translations and annotations of René Descartes, David Hume, and the Prolegomena to Immanuel Kant. Jointly with Bánóczi, he translated Kant's Critique of Pure Reason. He was an active writer on matters of education, editing the pedagogical journal Magyar Tanügy from 1882 to 1886.|$|E

50|$|The pre-Scythian {{inhabitants}} of the steppe may have been Cimmerians {{who may have been}} a Thracians-Iranian mix with an Iranian <b>elete.</b> From around the ninth century BC the nomads of the western steppe are described as Scythians (800 BC - 100 BC). They spoke an Iranian language and may have been the first to develop horse nomadism. Herodotus said that Scythians drove the Cimmerians from north of the Caucasus into Anatolia (about 700 BC), but this has been questioned. From around the second century BC the Sarmatians (c. 500 BC - 400 AD?) replaced the closely related Scythians, either as an ethnonym or ruling group. The Siraces (300 BC - 200 AD) were a group of Hellenized Sarmatians who lived along the Kuban. To their east and north were the Aorsi (100 BC - 100 AD), also a Sarmatian group. In the first and second centuries AD the Alans (100 AD - 1239) came from the east and took over from the Sarmatians. Since the Sythians, Sarmatians and Alans spoke similar languages the names may represent different dominant groups ruling similar people. From about 370 AD the Huns (376-469) overthrew the Alans, but many Alans continued to live in the area and later re-emerged. As a result of the Hun attack many Alans moved west and joined the Huns and Goths in attacking the Roman Empire. Around 600 AD the Western Turkic Kaganate took over the lower Volga - perhaps the first appearance of Turkic languages in this area. The obscure Sabir people (c. 460 - 700s), who may have been Turkic, lived near the Caspian. After 630 the Khazars (c. 630 - 969), who had a Turkic-speaking ruling class, formed a state mainly on the lower Volga which lasted until it was destroyed by the Rus’ about 969. Around 635 the Turkic Bulgars (c. 480-1014) were established west of the Khazars. The Alans re-formed a state (c. 700 - 1240) in Kabardia which was Christianized by the Byzantines. The rise of Islam led to the Arab-Khazar Wars (642-737) and in 737 Arabs briefly reached the lower Volga. The Pechenegs (c. 800 - 1100) moved from north of the Caspian into this area perhaps around 850. They pushed or were pushed westward and were eventually broken up in wars with the Byzantines. Behind them came the Cumans - Kipchaks (?-1241), two peoples that are hard to distinguish. Like the Pechenegs they continued west and fought the Rus’ and Byzantines. The appearance of the Kipchaks may mark the final establishment of Turkic languages north of the Black Sea.|$|E
