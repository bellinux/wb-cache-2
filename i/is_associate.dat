500|$|A {{total of}} 113 Justices have {{served on the}} Supreme Court of the United States, the highest {{judicial}} body in the United States. Justices have life tenure, and so they serve until they die in office, resign or retire, or are impeached and removed from office (which has never happened; the one impeached Justice was acquitted). The longest-serving member of the current court <b>is</b> <b>Associate</b> Justice Anthony Kennedy, with a term to date of [...] days ( [...] years). For the 104 non-incumbent justices, the mean length of service was 6,112 days (16.7 years) {{with a standard deviation}} of 3,620 days (9.9 years).

40|$|This study {{analyzes}} the financial crises in Argentina and Turkey {{in order to}} find out whether a set of six major macroeconomic indicators account for these crises or not. Evidence suggests that in Turkey, an increase in domestic credit <b>is</b> <b>associated</b> with the 1992, 1994 and 2001 financial crises, whereas an increase in CPI <b>is</b> <b>associated</b> with all crisis episodes. Similarly, a decrease in exchange rate <b>is</b> <b>associated</b> with all crises. A fall in the market index <b>is</b> <b>associated</b> with financial crises in 1991, 1992 and 1994. An increase in M 1 <b>is</b> <b>associated</b> only with the crisis in 1992 and a fall in the volume of exports relative to volume of imports <b>is</b> <b>associated</b> with the crisis in 1994. In Argentina, an increase in neither CPI nor domestic credit <b>is</b> <b>associated</b> with any of the financial crises. A decrease in exchange rate <b>is</b> <b>associated</b> with all crises, whereas a fall in the market index <b>is</b> <b>associated</b> with financial crises in 1991 and 2000. An increase in M 1, on the other hand, <b>is</b> <b>associated</b> with the crises in 1993, 2000 and 2001...|$|R

2500|$|In her book, Birth Control for Christians: Making Wise Choices, Jenell Williams Paris, who <b>is</b> <b>associate</b> {{professor}} of anthropology at Bethel College in St. Paul, reviews the benefits and uncertainties of various birth control methods, and decidedly favors the Fertility Awareness Method (FAM), which is similar to NFP but is different. (Paris is a FAM instructor.) The main difference is that FAM is not tied to Roman Catholic teaching. [...] Regarding hormonal methods and abortion, Paris explains that both assertions that the hormonal methods are necessarily acting as abortifacients and the counter claim that they never do are impossible to substantiate from data, and that the probability of the hypothesized scenarios are so small such that the collection of data seems infeasible.|$|E

The pit crew wore grey Richard Childress Racing shirts and Burton had a plain orange fire suit with associate sponsors. The car, which carried a [...] "subliminal advertising" [...] scheme, arrived in a black hauler with only the number 31 on the side. NASCAR officials said the car {{would not have made}} it through inspection with the AT logos. During that weekend, AT claimed that two alternate paint schemes proposed by AT— one advertising its [...] "go phone" [...] and another with the old Cingular slogan [...] "more bars in more places" [...] that AT recently brought back— were rejected by NASCAR. The Go Phone scheme had been used in the past. NASCAR later denied these claims.|$|E
2500|$|Labor unions were {{a factor}} in the Court's decision. Labor unions use {{picketing}} as a common tactic, so any case concerning public assembly is of great interest to labor groups. Justices Black and Clark made note of the obstruction charge as bad for labor picketing in their opinions, and even stated that the threat to labor picketing was their main reasoning for that decision. (Kalven 1965) In the words of one justice, Hugo L. Black, [...] "Those who encourage minority groups to believe that the United States Constitution and Federal laws give them a right to patrol and picket in the streets whenever they choose, in order to advance what they think to be a just and noble end, do no service to those minority groups, their cause, or their country."
