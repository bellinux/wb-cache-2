25|$|Based on a {{prototype}} with the factory designation 4A15, the G.I and its successors were built to a conventional bomber design for their time, two-bay biplanes with unstaggered wings of unequal span. The pilot sat {{in an open}} cockpit just forward of the wings, and open positions were provided in the nose and amidships for a gunner and observer. The engines were mounted pusher-fashion in nacelles atop the lower wings and enclosed in streamlined cowlings. Fixed tricycle undercarriage was fitted, with <b>dual</b> <b>wheels</b> on each unit.|$|E
25|$|As designed, the R.II {{was a large}} three-bay biplane with unstaggered {{wings of}} unequal span and a fully {{enclosed}} cabin. Power was to be supplied by three 180-kW (240-hp) Maybach HS engines mounted internally in the fuselage, which transmitted their power via driveshafts to two propellers mounted tractor-fashion on the interplane struts nearest the fuselage. The main undercarriage consisted of divided units, each of which carried <b>dual</b> <b>wheels,</b> and the tail {{was supported by a}} pair of tailwheels. The fueslage was forked into an upper and lower section, which allowed a clear field of fire {{to the rear of the}} aircraft.|$|E
25|$|As designed, the R.V {{was a large}} three-bay biplane with unstaggered {{wings of}} unequal span and a fully {{enclosed}} cabin.

The Maybach engines had been a never-ending source of trouble on the R.II, R.III, and R.IV, and by June 1916, Siemens-Schuckert had obtained permission from the Idflieg to substitute Benz Bz.IV engines on the R.III The firm made the same change on the R.V, which was almost complete by then. The substitution required an almost complete rebuild of the aircraft, and included adding an extra bay to the wings, increasing their span. The Idflieg accepted the R.V in this form, after agreeing to a reduction in the aircraft's original specifications.|$|E

25|$|As designed, the R.VI {{was a large}} three-bay biplane with unstaggered {{wings of}} unequal span and a fully {{enclosed}} cabin.

The fuselage was modified to accommodate the new powerplant, and an extra bay was added to the wings, increasing their span. Upon completion, designer Bruno Steffen piloted the R.VI on a test flight in which the aircraft carried a 2,400-kg (5,300-lb) load for six hours, a world record at the time, but one which was never publicised due to the war.|$|E

The latter powerplant was also selected for the R.VII, still under construction at the time. Apart from the new engines, the R.VII also received extensive modifications while still at the factory, including overall strengthening to take the greater weight of the heavier Mercedes engines, as well as changes to the fuel tanks, propellers, and undercarriage. The wings were completely redesigned to incorporate heavier spars and a new rib section and gained two extra bays, to provide a greater span.|$|E

2500|$|The XP-89 had a thin, straight, {{mid-mounted}} {{wing and}} {{a crew of}} two, seated in tandem. The slim rear fuselage and the high-mounted horizontal stabilizer led Northrop employees calling it the Scorpionâ€”a name later formally adopted by the Air Force. The intended armament of four 20mm M-24 cannon in a small nose turret was not ready when the XP-89 was completed in 1948. Pending the availability of {{either of the two}} turrets under development, an interim six-gun fixed installation, with 200 rounds per gun, was designed for the underside of the nose. The thin wing had an aspect ratio of 5.88, a thickness-to-chord ratio of 9% and used a NACA 0009-64 section, which was selected for its low drag at high speed and stability at low speeds. A further advantage of the straight wing was that it could accommodate heavy weights at the wingtips. The wing could not fit the circular-type ailerons used in the P-61, so Northrop used the [...] "decelerons" [...] designed for the unsuccessful XP-79 prototype. These were clamshell-style split ailerons, which could be used as conventional ailerons, as dive brakes, or function as flaps as needed. All flying surfaces, the flaps and the landing gear were hydraulically powered. The thin wing dictated tall, thin, high-pressure (...) mainwheel tires, while the low height of the fuselage required the use of <b>dual</b> <b>wheels</b> for the nose gear.|$|E

40|$|Shrinking {{line width}} {{geometries}} in IC-devices {{translate into a}} substantial {{increase in the number of}} chips per wafer. However, as a consequence, it also results in a greatly extended cut length during wafer dicing. Since the cutting speed is already quite high, no substantial increase of it may be expected. As a solution, the use of a <b>dual</b> gang <b>wheel</b> is suggested in this paper. Whereas conventional gang wheel dicing requires specially designed machines to support the gang wheel arbor, this new approach allows mounting of a <b>dual</b> dicing <b>wheel</b> on the same pair of flanges designed for single hubless dicing wheel use.

50|$|One of {{the major}} {{disadvantages}} of the super singles {{is that they are}} currently not as widely available as a standard tire. In addition, if a tire should become deflated or be destroyed, there is not another tire attached to the same hub to maintain the dynamic stability of the vehicle, as would be the case with <b>dual</b> <b>wheels.</b> With <b>dual</b> <b>wheels,</b> the remaining tire may be overloaded, but it will typically allow the vehicle to be safely stopped or driven to a repair facility.|$|E
50|$|In Europe, {{super singles}} became popular when the allowed weight of {{semitrailer}} rigs was increased from 38 to 40 tonnes. In this reform the trailer industry replaced two 10 t axles with <b>dual</b> <b>wheels,</b> with three 8 t axles on wide-base single wheels. The significantly lower axle weight on super singles {{must be considered}} when comparing road wear from single versus <b>dual</b> <b>wheels.</b> The majority of super singles sold in Europe have a width of 385 mm. The standard 385 tires have a legal load limit of 4500 kg. (Note that expensive, specially reinforced 385 tires approved for 5000 kg do exist. Their market share is tiny, except for mounting on the steer axle.) A high share of research on road wear from heavy vehicles have failed to consider relevant axle load on super singles, as they compare road wear from 10-tonne axle load both <b>dual</b> <b>wheels</b> and on single wheels, instead of the relevant 8 - 9 t axle load on single wheels.|$|E
50|$|In Europe usually both rear tractor axles have <b>dual</b> <b>wheels,</b> while {{single or}} <b>dual</b> <b>wheels</b> {{are used for}} the cargo trailer. The most common {{combination}} used in Europe is a semi tractor with three axles, one a lift axle, and a cargo trailer with three axles, one also a lift axle, giving six axles and 22 wheels in total. This format is now common across Europe, due to reduced road-loading requirements, especially for bridges. The lift axles used on both tractors and trailers allow the trucks to remain legal, but reduce tyre scrub and wear while carrying lighter loads by raising an axle set off the roadway. For greater detail, see the United Kingdom section, below.|$|E

40|$|The Finite Element Method (FEM) {{was used}} in many fields of {{engineering}} with the advanced of computers programs, and in lasts years have begun to evaluate pavements structures. In the transition at different structures of pavement, {{the behavior of the}} materials has resulted in the differential settlement response when they are loaded. A three-dimensional finite element model was developed in Ansys Program and performed statics analyses to evaluate the responses of interface among the bridge abutment and flexible pavement for <b>dual</b> <b>wheel.</b> Was simulated a pavement behaviour in this study and results for different structures in 3 D FEM were compared with a linear elastic model in ELSYM 5 program. Different structures of pavement varying the mechanical properties of the base in each case, were developed to review a pavement response to static load in the transitions of flexible pavements. This difference in material of base causes the problem of a differential settlement in the most cases. This paper tries to develop a research of response at bridge approach without slab transition in flexible pavement to one static load. In this case a <b>dual</b> <b>wheel,</b> in a comparison was conducted from a variation in the compaction near the structure of bridge...|$|R

In the load application procedure, a <b>dual</b> <b>wheel</b> with the a series of pressure was chosen. The results have shown that the deflection tensile stress and subgrade compressive strain on the surface increase with the increase of axle load and they would result in serious effect of overloading on the earlier damage of asphalt pavement...|$|R
