5|$|According to Gandhi, {{religion}} {{is not about}} what a man believes, it is about how a man lives, how he relates to other people, his conduct towards others, and one's relationship to one's conception of god. It is not important to convert or to join any religion, but it <b>is</b> <b>important</b> <b>to</b> improve one's {{way of life and}} conduct by absorbing ideas from any source and any religion, believed Gandhi.|$|E
5|$|Because linear probing is {{especially}} sensitive to unevenly distributed hash values, it <b>is</b> <b>important</b> <b>to</b> {{combine it with}} a high-quality hash function that does not produce such irregularities.|$|E
5|$|For adults, {{the testing}} of electrolyte, blood glucose and calcium levels <b>is</b> <b>important</b> <b>to</b> rule out {{problems}} with these as causes. An electrocardiogram can rule out problems with {{the rhythm of the}} heart. A lumbar puncture may be useful to diagnose a central nervous system infection but is not routinely needed. In children additional tests may be required such as urine biochemistry and blood testing looking for metabolic disorders.|$|E

5|$|Government family-friendly {{initiatives}} such {{as child}} subsidies and cheaper child care facilities can also greatly decrease the gender {{difference in the}} workplace, due to the woman being able to work longer hours outside the home. In addition, when developing policies related to paid work, it <b>is</b> <b>important</b> <b>to</b> do gender impact assessments {{in order to assess}} the impact of a policy on both the paid and unpaid sector.|$|E
5|$|In {{practical}} terms, horses {{prefer to}} eat {{small amounts of}} food steadily throughout the day, {{as they do in}} nature when grazing on pasture. Although this is not always possible with modern stabling practices and human schedules that favor feeding horses twice a day, it <b>is</b> <b>important</b> <b>to</b> remember the underlying biology of the animal when determining what to feed, how often, and in what quantities.|$|E
5|$|In the end, Carys is {{reunited with}} her father. The team returns to Torchwood, {{and as she}} leaves for home, Jack advises Gwen {{not to let the}} job consume her because her {{perspective}} <b>is</b> <b>important</b> <b>to</b> the team. He then encourages Gwen to go home and spend time with Rhys.|$|E

5|$|Income from tourism <b>is</b> <b>important</b> <b>to</b> Ashland's economy. A {{large number}} of restaurants, galleries, and retail stores cater to {{thousands}} of visitors who attend plays each year at the Oregon Shakespeare Festival. In 2011, the festival sold more than 390,000 tickets to its theater productions.|$|E
5|$|It <b>is</b> <b>important</b> <b>to</b> {{also note}} that images of the family depend upon the {{specific}} source in which the image is found {{and the type of}} audience that the source aims to reach. For example, in a women’s magazine such as Good Housekeeping, one can expect to find women in the family portrayed solely as domestic housewives.|$|E
5|$|It <b>is</b> <b>important</b> <b>to</b> {{note that}} the {{boundaries}} between category are able to be moved to allocate more or fewer clients to each category. It is normal to see fewer higher likelihood and/or consequence clients rather than 50% of the population or 50% of the assessed likelihood or consequence. In other words, the boundary is shifted so {{there can be a}} strong focus on the few assessed to be higher risk.|$|E

5|$|Regular pruning <b>is</b> <b>important</b> <b>to</b> {{give the}} plant an {{attractive}} habit and {{prevent it from}} becoming leggy. Hard-pruning below green growth is not advisable with this banksia; since it lacks a lignotuber, {{it does not have}} dormant buds below the bark that respond to pruning or fire and therefore is unable to sprout from old wood as readily as commonly cultivated lignotuberous species, such as B.spinulosa and B.robur.|$|E
5|$|The {{economy of}} Gyeongju is more diverse than the city's {{image as a}} tourist haven would suggest. Although tourism <b>is</b> <b>important</b> <b>to</b> the economy, most {{residents}} work in other fields. Over 27,000 are employed in manufacturing compared to roughly 13,500 in the hospitality industry.|$|E
5|$|The {{first line}} therapy for aphthous {{stomatitis}} is topical agents rather than systemic medication, with topical corticosteroids being the mainstay treatment. Systemic treatment is {{usually reserved for}} severe disease due {{to the risk of}} adverse side effects associated with many of these agents. A systematic review found that no single systemic intervention was found to be effective. Good oral hygiene <b>is</b> <b>important</b> <b>to</b> prevent secondary infection of the ulcers.|$|E

5|$|The list of highest {{points in}} each state <b>is</b> <b>important</b> <b>to</b> the sport of highpointing, where enthusiasts attempt to visit the highest point {{in each of the}} {{contiguous}} forty-eight states or in all fifty states. As of 2006, 155 people had reached all fifty state highpoints. Roughly 200–300 people attend the Highpointers Club convention each year.|$|E
5|$|The most {{interesting}} aspects of Irish phonotactics {{revolve around the}} behavior of consonant clusters.

5|$|The {{seafood and}} poultry {{industries}} thrived {{through much of}} the 20th century, but neither <b>is</b> <b>important</b> <b>to</b> the island's economy today. Chincoteague is a major tourist destination on Virginia's Eastern Shore, with many coming to enjoy the beaches on Assateague Island. The success of Marguerite Henry's 1947 children's book Misty of Chincoteague and its sequels helped publicize Chincoteague, as did the 1961 film, Misty.|$|E

5|$|To be able {{to choose}} the more {{appropriate}} algorithm for each specific problem, it <b>is</b> <b>important</b> <b>to</b> determine both the effectiveness and precision of all the available algorithms. The domain studying these matters is called numerical linear algebra. As with other numerical situations, two main aspects are the complexity of algorithms and their numerical stability.|$|E
5|$|College {{students}} {{are at risk}} of engaging in poor sleep hygiene and also of being unaware of the resulting effects of sleep deprivation. Because of irregular weekly schedules and the campus environment, college students may be likely to have variable sleep-wake schedules across the week, take naps, drink caffeine or alcohol near bedtime, and sleep in disruptive sleeping environments. Because of this, it <b>is</b> <b>important</b> <b>to</b> have sleep hygiene education on college campuses.|$|E
5|$|To left {{of center}} in the station model, the {{temperature}} and dew point are plotted. Within the United States on surface weather maps, they are still plotted in degrees Fahrenheit. Otherwise, {{they will be in}} units of degrees Celsius. This knowledge <b>is</b> <b>important</b> <b>to</b> meteorologists because when this data is plotted on a map, isotherms and isodrosotherms (lines of equal dew point) are easily analyzed, either by man or machine, which can help determine location of weather fronts.|$|E
