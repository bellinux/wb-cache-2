40|$|Capítulos en librosDuring {{the last}} ten years Iberdrola Distribución Eléctrica has built a {{considerable}} number of high voltage/medium voltage transformer stations in urban areas using high voltage (220 kV and 132 kV) Gas Insulated Substations (GISs). The typical configuration of such GISs is double bar with two transmission line bays, two transformer bays and a coupling bay. Overhead transmission lines and power transformers are connected to the GIS using either <b>insulated</b> <b>cables</b> or Gas <b>Insulated</b> Lines (GILs) of different length. The protection of the power transformers against lightning overvoltages is performed with surge arresters at the connection point of the overhead lines with either the <b>insulated</b> <b>cables</b> or the GILs. This paper reports an exhaustive study conducted by Iberdrola aimed at assessing the performance of the protective scheme in three configurations in both 132 kV and 220 kV stations: 1. Power transformers are connected to the GIS using GILSs. Overhead lines are connected to the GIS also using GILs. 2. Power transformers are connected to the GIS using <b>insulated</b> <b>cables.</b> Overhead lines are connected to the GIS also using <b>insulated</b> <b>cables.</b> 3. Power transformers are connected to the GIS using <b>insulated</b> <b>cables.</b> Overhead lines are connected to the GIS using GILs. Very detailed models of the stations for electromagnetic transient simulation have been developed using manufacturer data of the GISs, <b>insulated</b> <b>cables,</b> GILs, power transformers and surge arresters. The study has comprised simulation of a reference case of each configuration and several sensitivity studies with respect to the length of the <b>insulated</b> <b>cables</b> and the GILs. info:eu-repo/semantics/publishedVersio...|$|R

This offers a more related to physics alternative to the transfer function model. The equivalence between both models is shown. Materials and Methods: In a first step, the possibility of modeling an <b>insulated</b> <b>cable</b> with a transmission line model was analyzed through full-wave numerical simulations. An electrode model that has a physical meaning was proposed. The transmission line model predictions were confronted to experimental and simulated data of the transfer function of a cable and of the resonant behavior {{as a function of}} length of cables with different termination conditions. Results: The assumption of a transmission line model which underlies the transfer function model is right for a simple cable embedded in tissue imitating gel. A transmission line model extracted from a transfer function allows to predict the resonant behavior of two cables with different termination conditions. Conclusion: A transmission line model of an <b>insulated</b> <b>cable</b> embedded in tissue imitating gel offers a more directly related to physics alternative to the transfer function model...|$|R
40|$|The {{relationship}} between impulse breakdown stress and stressed oil volume {{has been extensively}} investigated for uniform field electrodes. In large high voltage transformers {{it is essential to}} extend this relationship to paper insulated non-uniform field situations which are more frequently encountered in practice. This paper develops the stated relationship by experimental tests, using <b>insulated</b> <b>cable</b> to plane configurations, and statistical methods. These tests show that the impulse breakdown strength of an <b>insulated</b> <b>cable</b> to plane or nonuniform field system has a two parameter Weibull distribution, when the oil is considered to be the weak-link of the system. A non-linear regression analysis is then used to find that the Weibull parameters for insulated non-uniform field electrodes are approximately the same as the parameters for the uninsulated uniform field electrodes provided their stressed oil volumes are equivalent. Statistical calculations are used to derive the fundamental {{relationship between}} the Weibull parameters for any stressed oil volume and the Weibull parameters for the unit oil volume. With this relationship it is possible for design engineers to approximately determine the probability of electrical breakdown of any <b>insulated</b> <b>cable</b> to plane configuration in large power transformers.

When the electrical tree propagates into the nonlinear shielding layer sandwiched between insulation layers of cable, the electric field distribution near the tip of electrical tree is obviously improved. These findings prove the feasibility and the effectivity of inhibiting electrical tree propagation inside high-voltage cable by adding nonlinear shielding layer into the insulation layer...|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{deals with}} the {{prediction}} of medium voltage cable insulation condition. Different kinds of electrical measurements and chemical analyses are tested {{to find out the}} most representative combination. A large scale test program was carried out on field aged XLPE-insulated and oil-paper <b>insulated</b> <b>cables.</b> Cable samples were collected from different utility companies in Finland. Degradation of XLPE-insulation will change insulation material properties and {{it should be possible to}} detect these changes with chemical analysis. These chemical changes can lower the voltage withstand level of XLPE-cables. Degradation of paper insulation will decrease the mechanical properties of the paper. Increased moisture content will affect the electrical performance of the oilpaper insulation and will also speed up degradation processes. Methods such as dielectric response measurement and FTIR-analysis were used to determine the degree of degradation. It was found that XLPE-cables used in friendly environments are still in good condition after thirty years of service. Cables can be ranked clearly into different condition classes, but overall the XLPE-cables were in good condition. The FTIR-analysis results had good correlation to the voltage withstand levels of the cable samples. The field aged oilpaper <b>insulated</b> <b>cables</b> were also in good condition, even after more than fifty years of service life. Insulations were dry and degree of polymerisation (DP-value), related to mechanical strength, were high. FTIR-analysis results showed good correlation to the moisture content in the insulation. Since increased moisture content and high temperature will increase degradation rate significantly, FTIR-analysis can be used to estimate oilpaper insulation condition. Based on the research project results, FTIR-analysis can be used to estimate cable insulation condition. Results of FTIR-analysis can be linked to the voltage withstands levels of XLPE-cables and the moisture content of oilpaper cables. FTIR-analysis results can be converted to the condition classes of XLPE and oilpaper <b>insulated</b> <b>cables...</b>|$|R
