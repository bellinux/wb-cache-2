40|$|Recent {{advances}} in reprogramming {{allow us to}} turn somatic cells into human {{induced pluripotent stem cells}} (hiPSCs). Disease modeling using patient-specific hiPSCs allows the study of the underlying mechanism for pathogenesis, also providing a platform for the development of in vitro drug screening and gene therapy to improve treatment options. The promising potential of hiPSCs for regenerative medicine is also evident from the increasing number of publications (> 7000) on iPSCs in recent years. Various cell types from distinct lineages have been successfully used for hiPSC generation, including skin fibroblasts, hematopoietic cells and epidermal keratinocytes. While skin biopsies and blood collection are routinely performed in many labs as a source of somatic cells for the generation of hiPSCs, the collection and subsequent derivation of hair keratinocytes are less commonly used. Hair-derived keratinocytes represent a non-invasive approach to obtain cell samples from patients. Here we outline a simple non-invasive method for the derivation of keratinocytes from plucked hair. We also provide <b>instructions</b> <b>for</b> <b>maintenance</b> of keratinocytes and subsequent reprogramming to generate integration-free hiPSC using episomal vectors.

40|$|In {{all known}} {{cellular}} organisms, from the smallest bacteria to the tallest of trees, DNA stores the <b>instructions</b> <b>for</b> <b>maintenance,</b> growth and — crucially — reproduction that have allowed life to proliferate {{to the far}} reaches of our planet. When a cell divides to form two equivalent cells, it must first copy its genome using an enzyme known as a replicative DNA polymerase. This protein functions as part of a replisome, which is a group of specialized proteins that work in concert to duplicate, faithfully, DNA molecules numbering several million bases in length. As a graduate student, I studied the atomic-level structure, biochemical properties and evolution of the replicative polymerase, and some of its helper proteins, in the replisome of the Gram-negative &# 947;-proteobacterium Escherichia coli. Interestingly, although some replisome proteins are universally conserved, the replicative polymerases themselves are not, and those from Bacteria appear, on the basis of sequence and structure, unrelated to those from the two other domains of life, Eukaryota and Archaea. This lack of homology is evidence of the convergent evolution of two different types of polymerases and suggests that bacterial DNA replication may be a promising target for antibiotic development. Within bacteria, there are two main types of replicative polymerases — the PolC homologs and the DnaE 1 -pol homologs. PolC homologs appear to be limited to the low-GC Gram-positive bacteria that comprise the phyla Firmicutes and Tenericutes, while nearly all others use a DnaE 1 -pol. In this thesis, I align a diverse set of DnaE 1 -homologs and identify among them two main versions, one like the polymerase from E. coli (Eco-like) and the other like that of Thermus aquaticus (Taq-like). Using a second alignment, I observe that the Eco-like polymerase almost always appears with an editing protein, DnaQ-exonuclease, which removes mismatch errors during DNA synthesis. Guided by these sequence data, I analyze previously solved structures of the E. coli and T. aquaticus polymerases and place the sequence and structure interpretations in the context of known bacterial phylogeny. Taq-like DnaE 1 -pol, which is a constitutively active polymerase that contains DNA-editing exonuclease activity in its PHP domain, is the ancestral version and, based on its presence in cyanobacteria, likely dates back roughly 3, 500 million years, nearly to the origin of life on Earth. In contrast, Eco-like DnaE 1 -pol can adopt a distorted conformation incompatible with DNA synthesis and has a PHP domain that lacks editing activity and, instead, binds a DnaQ-exonuclease for editing in trans. Because mitochondria are descended from an &# 945;-proteobacterium, the Eco-like polymerase predates the emergence of eukaryotes more than 1, 500 million years ago. In addition to identifying the two main types of DnaE 1 -pol, I describe significant progress toward crystal structures the E. coli replicative polymerase in complex with DNA. Furthermore, I demonstrate the precise structural conservation of the PHP domain in this polymerase by restoring metal binding to it using only three point-mutations...|$|E

40|$|For an {{increasing}} number of applications the manual creation of multimedia/hypermedia presentations is no longer feasible. In order to meet the specific needs of the individual presentation consumer, information has to be communicated fast and flexibly. Although powerful authoring tools are available, they are not likely to solve this problem since they only facilitate the presentation editing. In this paper, we discuss the automation of the authoring process. Our approach to automated multimedia authoring is illustrated by means of two prototype systems. The first system, WIP, generates multimedia <b>instructions</b> <b>for</b> the <b>maintenance</b> of technical devices. The benefit of WIP lies in its ability to produce presentations depending on a given set of presentation parameters.

40|$|There are {{currently}} substantial efficiency losses in industry worldwide and downtime in pro-duction resources is naturally a major reason. In Sweden for example, the Overall Equipment Efficiency (OEE) is reported around 55 % while world-class is argued to be 85 %. One expla-nation {{is that many}} companies have adopted LEAN production concepts and implemented flow-oriented layouts with closer interrelations between resources. This shift puts high re-quirements on reliability services {{in order to avoid}} systems losses, e. g. indirect downtime like idle and blocked resource states. This paper presents findings from two existing research areas: namely automated management of production data, and task and resource allocation.

40|$|AbstractHome {{mechanical}} ventilation requires equipment, {{consisting of a}} generator of pressure, a tubing and an interface to deliver air to the patient. <b>Instructions</b> <b>for</b> equipment <b>maintenance</b> are generally not based on scientific evidence. Studies however have reported that tubing and masks used at home are the most commonly found as very dirty and contaminated. Dirtiness and contamination of equipment potentially expose patients to {{a higher risk of}} airway colonization, which, in turn, should cause respiratory infections. For this reason, published hygiene instructions include the use of disinfectant solution. Nevertheless, they generally fail to explain how basic maintenance may be achieved by simple cleaning with soap and water. The <b>instructions</b> <b>for</b> post-cleaning disinfection will depend upon the relative sensitivity of patients to respiratory tract infections and the related risks for bacterial colonization of the airways. Restrictive and obstructive disease patients are not equally sensitive to infections and, as a consequence, should not require similarly elaborate disinfection level. According with the restrictive or obstructive origin of respiratory insufficiency, the current educational review suggests simple and adequate rules for hygiene of tubing and masks in the home setting. Written instructions on how to clean the equipment for home ventilation are useful and sufficient in restrictive patients. In obstructive patients, cleaning always precedes disinfection. After cleaning, rinsing and drying are important. An effective weekly 20 -minute disinfection may be achieved by using an hypochlorite solution of soaking in a concentration of 0. 5 %...|$|R
40|$|International audienceOne of {{the main}} {{weaknesses}} with traditional computing {{is the fact that}} the numerical world of the computer is decoupled from the user's real world. The application of Augmented Reality (AR) can provide interactive systems in which real objects and computer data are combined in a cohesive way. This new paradigm has many potential applications in various fields, in particular in the maintenance domain. It allows the user to see computer generated virtual objects superimposed to the real world through the see-through Head Mounted Display (HMD). The technician of maintenance, when using this system, can interact with the virtual world and have additional information, such as <b>instruction</b> <b>for</b> performing <b>maintenance</b> tasks in form of text messages, images, 3 -D models of pieces or audio such as speech instruction.

50|$|Stelae K, M, and X on {{the east}} side of the Nile contain what Davies termed the Earlier Proclamation. All three stelae contain both {{vertical}} and horizontal lines of text. Stela K is the best preserved and was made to replace Stela M which was damaged early on, thus necessitating a replacement. Both Stela K and Stela M are located in the southern side of the site and the text in their horizontal lines reads from left to right, away from the center of the site. Stela X is located in the northern side of the site and it is a mirror image of stelae K and M in that its horizontal lines read from right to left, also away from the center. The inscription on the stelae K, M, and X is dated to the fifth regnal year of Akhenaten in day 13 of the season of Peret. They include the full title of the god Aten, as well as titles of the king Akhenaten and the king’s wife Nefertiti.

40|$|Older {{adults are}} at {{increased}} risk both of falling and of experiencing accidental domestic fire. In addition to advanced age, these adverse events share the risk factors of balance or mobility problems, cognitive impairment and socioeconomic deprivation. For both events, the consequences include significant injury and death, and considerable socioeconomic costs for the individual and informal carers, as well as for emergency services, health and social care agencies. Secondary prevention services for older people who have fallen or who are identifiable as being at high risk of falling include NHS Falls clinics, where a multidisciplinary team offers an individualised multifactorial targeted intervention including strength and balance exercise programmes, medication changes and home hazard modification. A similar preventative approach is employed by most Fire and Rescue Services who conduct Home Fire Safety Visits to assess and, if necessary, remedy domestic fire risk, fit free smoke alarms with <b>instruction</b> <b>for</b> use and <b>maintenance,</b> and plan an escape route. We propose that the similarity of population at risk, location, specific risk factors and the commonality of preventative approaches employed could offer net gains in terms of feasibility, effectiveness and acceptability if activities within these two preventative approaches were to be combined...|$|R

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to {{estimate}} the oral hygiene and gingival condition in patients with fixed prosthodontic restorations for a period of 3 months along with the oral hygiene instructions. The study included 60 patients with fixed prosthetic appliances. Medical examinations of dental condition were carried out using basic diagnostic tools like dental mirror and periodontal probe. As well, we examine how factors, such as: age, gender, type of fixed dental prosthesis (single crown or fixed partial denture) and material (metal or porcelain fused to metal) are statistically associated with oral hygiene and gingival condition. Plaque and Gingiva index was taken according to the method of Silness and Löe. The examination was accomplished on the first dental visit, after 14 days and three months appropriately with the oral hygiene instructions. Statistical analysis was performed by using paired sample t-test from Statistical software SPSS for Windows version 23. A p-value < 0. 05 was considered as statistically significant. Our results confirmed that the Plaque and Gingiva index had higher values in the first visit than that found in the other periods. Patients with crowns had better oral hygiene levels compared to fixed dental prosthesis wearers. No statistical differences were found for type of material. Also, younger patients showed better hygiene levels than the older ones.
