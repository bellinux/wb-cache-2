40|$|The {{research}} {{work in this}} thesis was undertaken between 1983 and 1986 whilst employed as a research officer (1983 - 1984) and as a meat marketing officer by the Department of Agriculture and Rural Affairs (DARA), Victoria. The development of techniques and experimental work formed {{a part of my}} training as a research officer at the Animal Research Institute, Werribee. At this time I was professionally supervised by Dr T G Truscott and Mr G A Eldridge. The statistical analyses were conducted under the supervision of Dr T G Truscott and Mr P Franz (DARA Biometrician). The occurrence of <b>dark-cutting</b> high pH beefmeat is recognised as a problem by the meat industry world-wide. In Australia, early pioneering work on the problem suggested the importance of the animal's stress response to marketing procedures in determining the occurrence of <b>dark-cutting</b> beef. More recently, the majority of Australian research investigating the problem has been conducted in Queensland where the climate and marketing conditions for cattle are often quite different to that experienced in south-eastern Australia. During 1980 - 1983 the Victorian meat industry reported several outbreaks of <b>dark-cutting</b> beefmeat at certain times of the year. Supermarket buyers of beef carcasses were found to discriminate against this "dark" beef. It became obvious that {{research work}} was required to establish the seasonal incidence of <b>dark-cutting</b> beefmeat under Victorian conditions and to investigate the contributing factors. It was on this basis that I was employed as a trainee with the Victorian Department of Agriculture and Rural Affairs. The material presented in chapters 2, 3 and 4 is largely reproduced or adapted from published reports or papers (see Bibliography) of Halpin and Warner (1985); Warner, Eldridge, Barnett, Halpin and Cahill (1986); Warner, Eldridge, Truscott and Cahill (1986) and Warner (1985). Chapters 5 and 6 present new material. I was responsible for the preparation and writing of these papers and Chapters. I initiated and organised the survey, experiment and technique developments described in Chapters, 3, 4 and 6 and was responsible for the organisation of post-slaughter meat quality measurements described in Chapter 5.

40|$|Dark {{cutting in}} beef {{carcases}} can represent a significant financial loss to processors and producers involved in direct marketing. In our study we valued <b>dark–cutting</b> downgrades {{to a loss}} of $ 100 to $ 150 per carcase since all such bodies had to be diverted away from their primary export market, and additional cattle had to be killed in their place. A supplier survey conducted in November 2000 documented the on-farm histories of 937 market-specific yearling cattle killed at the one meat plant over an 18 months period. This enabled the examination of on-farm records pertaining to the handling, treatments, grazing history and preparation for sale of turnoff lots that were then correlated to the number and percentage of dark cutters. By association we pinpointed a number of social and behavioural background factors that applied to the circumstances, such as handling issues, long pick-ups, purchased stock, mixed mobs and limited weaner training. Although not commonly observed, improving pasture conditions were a possible nutritional influence associated with less <b>dark-cutting.</b> In conclusion, we suggest that animal behavioural influences reported in this paper are worth managing in the lead up to processing. However the number of dark cutters was not considered to be high by industry standards for pasture fed cattl...|$|E
40|$|The dark, {{firm and}} dry (DFD) or <b>dark-cutting</b> {{condition}} causes large losses {{to both the}} cattle feedlot and meat industry due to its unattractive, dark red colour and its limited shelf life. <b>Dark-cutting,</b> is {{a direct consequence of}} low muscle glycogen at slaughter and results in a lack of normal acidification of meat during rigor development causing high pH (> 5. 8). Glycogen breakdown in muscle may be rapidly triggered by increased circulating adrenaline or by strenuous muscular activity. Several other factors have also been found to lead to the DFD condition in cattle. The aims of this investigation were to determine the incidence of DFD in cattle slaughtered at a South African abattoir and to identify potential causative factors of this syndrome. It was furthermore also important to evaluate the sensory attributes, microbiological quality and hence, shelf life of DFD meat. The incidence of DFD carcasses, based on pH measurements (threshold ~ 5. 8) within I h post mortem on 22 178 cattle in the M. longissimus dorsi, was 11. 8 %. The estimated overall incidence measured over a 5 -day period, testing only cattle supplied by the four main feedlots, was 7. 83 % (N= 5 659), measuring pH 24 (~ 5. 8), confirmed by colour grades (values of 7 or 8 were classified as DFD). The incidence of <b>dark-cutting</b> beef, also seemed to be feedlot related with the highest being 12. 37 % and the lowest 1. 75 %. It is suspected that the incidence of DFD carcasses is higher in extremely hot or cold weather or large fluctuations, and should decrease during the months with milder temperatures. Transport distances did not affect the DFD incidence. In experiment 2, cattle from Feedlot C, transported over a short distance (45 km) had a higher incidence of DFD (9 %) than those of Feedlot A (1. 7 %), transported over the longer distance of 290 km. Long holding periods in the holding pens at the abattoir (> 24 h and even as high as 54 h), appeared not to have a significant influence on the occurrence of DFD. There was no correlation between bruised carcasses and DFD carcasses (the respective means of bruising were 6. 7 % and 3 %, and respective mean incidences of DFD were 1. 7 % and 9 %). Using Scheffe's test to compare the effect of gender on the incidence of DFD, significantly more bulls and steers were affected by <b>dark-cutting</b> than heifers (P 0. 05) in heifers could possibly indicate a non-¬oestrus situation in the majority of the heifers, since a significant association between the presence of oestrus and DFD was shown previously by other researchers. The effect of gender on the incidence of <b>dark-cutting,</b> related to feedlot, was also significant. Higher incidences of DFD were found with steers of Feedlots B, C and 0 (14. 5 %, 11. 6 % and 13. 7 % respectively) than in Feedlot A (1. 9 %). The lowest overall incidence of dark-cutters was found in Feedlot A (1. 7 %). It appeared as if the breed type of the cattle had an effect on the <b>dark-cutting</b> beef. The Bos indicus (Brahman-type) animals had a significant effect (P< 0. 001), on the colour of the beef when compared with European breeds. Cattle of two feedlots, fasted for periods of 40 hand 60 h, showed that a shorter fasting period had a significant effect (P < 0. 001) on the pH. It appeared as if pre-slaughter stress, induced <b>dark-cutting</b> more readily in fasted than in fed cattle. Fasting also inhibited muscle glycogen re-synthesis during recovery of stress. The effect of pre-slaughter handling on the blood composition and muscle glycogen content of cattle of three different feedlots was studied. After transport (phase 1), the glycogen depletion was significant for all three feedlots (P < 0. 05). Further glycogen depletion was found after slaughter (phase 2) (P < 0. 01). The hematocrit increased after transport, which indicated that animals of Feedlot B (P < 0. 0001) experienced stress. During the second phase, a significant decrease in hematocrit for Feedlot B was observed (P < 0. 05). For Feedlot A, a non-significant increase was found in phase 1, with a significant (P < 0. 05) increase in phase 2. The hematocrit of cattle of Feedlot C, however, showed a significant decrease during both phases. The blood glucose concentration for all three feedlots increased during phase 1, but was not significant. However, the blood glucose concentrations for all three feedlots increased significantly during phase 2 which probably indicated that the animals experienced stress during this period. The increase in creatine kinase was significant (P < 0. 01) during both phases 1 and 2 for Feedlot A. Fluctuations were found in the creatine kinase concentrations of Feedlot C. Feedlot B, however, showed a significant decrease in the creatine kinase concentrations. Free fatty acid concentrations for all feedlots increased linearly over the different stages. The high free fatty acid concentrations in blood samples of phase 2, of Feedlots Band C confirmed that these animals experienced stress, especially from the period being held in the pens to after slaughter (P < 0. 01 for both). The free fatty acid concentration, appear to be the best blood parameter to relate to meat quality. The DFD incidence during this experiment, for Feedlots Band C, is 35 %. For Feedlot A, with the lowest DFD incidence (16 %), the increase of free fatty acid concentration was not significant. Although the effect of growth promoters was not tested, the use of beta-agonists as growth promoters may increase the incidence of <b>dark-cutting</b> meat unless a sufficient withdrawal period before slaughter is observed. Feedlots A and C implanted Revelor in 9 month old cattle, while Feedlot B implanted both Synovex S (at 6 weeks) and Revelor (at 4 months). Consumer sensory evaluations indicated that the general appearance (P < 0. 05), colour (P < 0. 001) and acceptability (P < 0. 01) of raw normal steak were preferred significantly to those of raw DFD steak. Twice as many panellists preferred the raw normal steak than raw DFD because of the more attractive red colour, compared to the almost black colour of raw DFD steak. The hedonic ratings of the sensory attributes of fried normal steak versus fried DFD steak were non-significant for all attributes, although it was expected that consumers would find the DFD steak more tender and less flavoursome than normal steak. DFD meat samples (N= 84) were tested over a 7 -week period for total aerobic count, Pseudomonas, coliforms and Eschericia coli. Normal beef samples were expected to be acceptable, both on microbiological grounds and sensory evaluations until at least the seventh week. Microbiological spoilage of vacuum-packaged DFD meat took place during the second week and deterioration was more evident during the fourth week, due to the presence of cheesy odours. During the fifth week, green discolouration of the meat was observed. Dissertation (MSc Agric (Food Science)) [...] University of Pretoria, 2007. Food Scienceunrestricte...|$|E
40|$|Extra lean (3. 3 % fat) {{and lean}} (20. 0 % fat) hamburgers in three pH groups (≤ 6. 0; 6. 01 - 6. 49; 6. 50 - 6. 92) were {{evaluated}} for cooking-temperature profile, total process lethality, and physical properties after cooking to 71 °C by double-side frying on an electric grill. Neither cooking-temperature profile nor cooking time {{was affected by}} hamburger fat content or pH. Double-side frying to 71. 1 °C internal temperature was adequate for more than 6 -log destruction of viable E. coli O 157 :H 7 and Salmonella at the geometrical center of extra lean and lean hamburgers. The coldest spot was on the circumferential surface, {{as indicated by the}} presence of a red ring of undenatured myoglobin, and confirmed by the finite-element temperature distribution model. The effect of pH (5. 80, 6. 29, 6. 73) on myoglobin denaturation in extra lean (3. 3 % fat) and lean (20. 0 % fat) hamburgers was studied. Compared to normal meat (pH= 5. 8), raw extra lean ground beef of pH = 6. 73 had significantly lower oxidation-reduction potential (ORP) value, lower concentration of metmyoglobin after 48 hr of refrigerated storage, and more distinct cherry-red color. Percent of myoglobin denaturation during cooking was affected mainly by pH and was not affected by total pigment or fat content of hamburgers. A pH ≥ 6. 5 and ORP ≤ - 200 mV were characteristic of <b>dark-cutting</b> beef In a third experiment, extra lean (3. 5 %) and lean (20. 0 %) beef patties were made from normal beef (pH= 5. 70) and <b>dark-cutting</b> beef (pH = 6. 60). Controls were made with no additives or with 1 % salt and 10 % added water. Various browning agents (1 % glucose, 0. 2 % caramel colorant, 0. 3 % calcium peroxide, or 2. 5 % encapsulated lactic acid) were added with 10 % water and 1 % salt. Salt had a pronounced prooxidant effect on myoglobin. Distinctive absorption peaks at 541 - 548 nm and 577 - 582 nm indicated that the undenatured pigment in cooked patties was oxymyoglobin. <b>Dark-cutting</b> patties had more rubbery texture and slightly perceptible off-flavor. Patties with lactic acid were less juicy and had lower intensity of beef flavor than other patties, and moderate intensity of sour off-flavor. Addition of salt and encapsulated lactic acid to beef patty formulation could solve the problem of hard-to-cook patties...|$|E
40|$|Food-grade oxidants and {{browning}} agents were compared for prevention of undesirable raw appearance of cooked <b>dark-cutting</b> (DC) beef patties. DC beef had higher pH (6. 6 vs 5. 7) and lower 24 h oxidation-reduction potential (– 190 vs – 108 mV) than controls, with higher cooked yield and cohesiveness, but lower beef flavor intensity scores. DC patties with lactic acid (LA) had acceptable cooked appearance and increased myoglobin (Mb) denaturation during cooking (77 %-LA; 63 %-normal control; 41 %-DC control), but a tangy off-flavor. Calcium peroxide increased Mb denaturation to 69 %, but caused excessive oxidation.

40|$|Approximately 4, 000 {{yearling}} heifers (initial BW = 306 ± 1. 9 kg) {{were randomly}} allotted into 4 treatment groups {{to determine the}} effect of melengestrol acetate (MGA) on feedlot performance and carcass parameters. Treatments included a diet containing monensin (Rumensin) and tylosin (Tylan; RT) fed during the entire feeding period; RT plus MGA (RTM) also fed during the entire feeding period; RT withdrawn 35 d preslaughter (RTwd); and RTM withdrawn 35 d preslaughter (RTMwd). All cattle were implanted at arrival with Revalor-IH and reimplanted with Revalor- 200, and were fed a standard feedlot finishing diet (that met or exceeded 1996 NRC requirements) for approximately 150 d. Final BW, ADG, hot carcass weight (HCW), DMI, and percentage of cattle grading Choice were greater (P 3 ̆c 0. 05) for RTM than for all other treatments. Withdrawal of MGA (RTMwd) significantly (P 3 ̆c 0. 01) decreased ADG, HCW, 12 th-rib fat thickness, calculated YG, and percentage of carcasses grading Choice, but significantly increased the percentage of <b>dark-cutting</b> carcasses, LM area, and YG 1, 2, or 3 carcasses compared with RTM. There were no significant differences (except for dressing percentage) between RT and RTwd. Heifers continuously fed MGA increased in ADG, HCW, and carcass quality traits of economic importance compared with other treatments.

40|$|Crossbred Hereford × Angus calves (n = 103) {{were used}} to {{determine}} the effect of early weaning on carcass and ribeye (longissimus muscle) characteristics of bulls and steers. Treatments were: 1) early-weaned (117 days of age) bulls, 2) early-weaned steers, 3) normal-weaned (220 days of age) bulls, and 4) normal-weaned steers. Cattle were harvested at 360 and 389 days of age. At 36 hours postmortem, carcass quality and cutability were measured. Ribeye steaks were aged 14 days and scored for color, Warner-Bratzler shear force, and sensory panel evaluations. Carcasses from early-weaned cattle had greater dressing percentages, heavier weights, greater fat thicknesses, and higher numerical USDA Yield Grades (lower cutability). They also had more marbling and greater USDA quality grades, but had similar longissimus color, shear force, and sensory panel scores, compared with those of normal-weaned cattle. Bulls had greater dressing percentages, but had similar carcass weights to steers. Bull carcasses had less fat thickness and greater ribeye areas, resulting in lower numerical USDA Yield Grades (higher cutability) than steers had. They also had less marbling, darker color, and lower USDA quality grades than steers did. Longissimus muscles from bulls were darker, had greater shear forces, and had lower sensory panel tenderness scores than those from steers. For early-maturing British-type cattle, early weaning is a viable management strategy to produce heavier, higher-quality carcasses than those of normal-weaned cattle. Carcasses from early-weaned cattle are fatter and have lower cutability. For a non-implant “natural” market, bulls could be an alternative for producing high-cutability carcasses. Steaks may be less tender, however, and pre-harvest management must be optimized to reduce <b>dark-cutting</b> carcasses...|$|E
40|$|Castration of a bull (male) calf is {{the process}} of removal or {{destruction}} of the testicles. A steer is a castrated male calf raised for beef. REASONS FOR CASTRATION Reasons given for castrating beef calves include to: • stop the production of male hormones and semen • historically, tame oxen for draught purposes • prevent mating and reproduction after the age of puberty • produce docile cattle that are easier to handle compared to bulls • decrease aggressiveness, mounting activity, injuries, frequency of <b>dark-cutting</b> carcasses • enhance on-farm safety for animals, producers and employees • decrease costs associated with fencing and handling facilities compared to bulls • avoid discounted price that packers pay for bull carcasses • provide meat products of the quality consumers demand MANAGING MALE CALVES Owners may choose to manage male calves as intact bulls, castrate early, castrate late, or castrate plus implant with a growth stimulant implant. Which is selected will depend on the available handling facilities, the producer’s ability, the awareness of castration effects and the market available for the calves. Owners with guaranteed buyers willing to purchase green calves (horns and testicles in place), at the same price as processed calves (castrated and dehorned), might be advised to avoid these procedures. However, this buyer is very rare. Most purchasers of green calves are well aware of the risks associated with processing older calves and routinely bid less at auction. Recently, preconditioned (castrated, dehorned, vaccinated, bunk-adjusted) calves have brought a premium price at auctions. BEEF FROM INTACT BULLS There is a niche market for meat from young, intact bulls. The meat appeals to consumers who oppose castration for welfare reasons, desire meat produced without hormonal implants and prefer lean meat. Intact animals could be marketed one to two months earlier than castrates, which saves feed. Generally, consumers cannot detect differences in taste or tenderness between meat from steers and young bulls...|$|E
40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to determine the effect of degree of <b>dark-cutting</b> (DC) on the tenderness, juiciness and flavor descriptive attributes of beef. During carcass grading at a large U. S. commercial beef harvesting facility, DC carcasses and matching normal cohort (NC) carcasses (n= 160) were selected. Longissimus lumborum (LL) pH was determined online and DC carcasses were classified as severe (SEDC; mean pH= 6. 9, n= 40), moderate (MODC; mean pH= 6. 6, n= 40), mild (MIDC; mean pH= 6. 4, n= 40) or shady (SHDC; mean pH= 6. 1, n= 40). Vacuum-packaged strip loins (LL) were obtained from the left side of each carcass and aged for 14 d postmortem at 2 ?C. One steak (2. 54 cm) was collected for fresh slice shear force (SSF). A 6 cm section was frozen and used for trained descriptive analysis of tenderness, juiciness and flavor. Cooked SSF pieces were frozen and utilized for western blotting of desmin to determine extent of postmortem proteolysis. Thaw and cook loss decreased as intensity of DC increased with SEDC having the lowest loss (1. 83 % and 10. 1 %, respectively) compared to NC (3. 37 % and 14. 9 %, respectively). Slice shear force was higher (P< 0. 05) for SHDC (25. 6 kg) and MIDC (22. 9 kg) compared to SEDC (16. 8 kg), MODC (19. 4 kg) and NC (17. 8 kg). Sarcomere length was shorter (P< 0. 05) between DC class and NC (1. 66, 1. 67, 1. 71 and 1. 73 ?m for SEDC, MODC, MIDC and SHDC) and NC (1. 86 ?m). Postmortem proteolysis of desmin was greater (P< 0. 05) for NC compared to all DC classes (59. 83 % vs. 49. 20 %, 40. 31 %, 42. 07 % and 43. 30 % for SEDC, MODC, MIDC and SHDC, respectively). Trained sensory panel ratings for tenderness differed (P< 0. 05) among DC class with SEDC (6. 51) the most tender, followed by MODC (6. 04), then MIDC (5. 19) while SHDC (4. 66) and NC (4. 93) were the toughest. Juiciness ratings differed (P< 0. 05) among each DC class (5. 9, 5. 7, 5. 4 and 5. 2 for SEDC, MODC, MIDC and SHDC, respectively), with no difference between MIDC or SHDC compared to NC (5. 23). Fat-like, rancid, heated oil, chemical and musty/earthy/hummus flavors increased (P< 0. 05) while metallic, sour and salty flavors decreased as severity of DC increased. This study showed DC and NC differed in LL tenderness, juiciness and flavor. The direction and/or magnitude of those differences were greatly dependent of severity of DC. Steaks from intermediate pH (SHDC) are most likely to be tough, yet are regularly included in U. S. Select and U. S. Choice product lines...|$|E
