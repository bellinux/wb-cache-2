25|$|The {{phenotypic}} {{effect of}} a particular gene is contingent on its environment, including the fellow genes constituting with it the total genome. A gene never has a fixed effect, so how <b>is</b> <b>it</b> <b>possible</b> {{to speak of a}} gene for long legs? It is because of the phenotypic differences between alleles. One may say that one allele, all other things being equal or varying within certain limits, causes greater legs than its alternative. This difference enables the scrutiny of natural selection.|$|E

25|$|As {{was shown}} in the section on {{properties}} of linear representations, we can, by restricting to a subgroup, obtain a representation of a subgroup starting from a representation of a group. Naturally {{we are interested in}} the reverse process: <b>Is</b> <b>it</b> <b>possible</b> to obtain the representation of a group starting from a representation of a subgroup? We will see, that the induced representation, which will be defined in the following, provides us with the necessary concept. Admittedly, this construction is not inverse but adjoint to the restriction.|$|E
25|$|But <b>is</b> <b>it</b> <b>possible</b> {{that the}} {{particular}} temperature increase {{observed in the}} last 100 years {{is the result of}} carbon dioxide produced by human activities? The scientific evidence clearly indicates {{that this is not the}} case... measurements of atmospheric temperatures made by instruments lofted in satellites and balloons show that no warming has occurred in the atmosphere in the last 50 years. This is just the period in which humanmade carbon dioxide has been pouring into the atmosphere and according to the climate studies, the resultant atmospheric warming should be clearly evident.|$|E

25|$|The {{very first}} step which is {{normally}} overlooked {{by the top}} level management is defining the exact problem. Though {{we think that the}} problem identification is obvious, many times it is not. The rational decision making model is a group-based decision making process. If the problem is not identified properly then we may face a problem as each and every member of the group might have a different definition of the problem. Hence, {{it is very important that}} the definition of the problem is the same among all group members. Only then <b>is</b> <b>it</b> <b>possible</b> for the group members to find alternate sources or problem solving in an effective manner.|$|E
25|$|The {{documentary}} film The Armor of Light, features {{the story of}} Jordan Davis. Disney heir Abigail Disney made her directorial debut with The Armor of Light, which follows pro-life Evangelical minister Rev. Rob Schenck, Lucy McBath, the mother of teenager Jordan Davis, and attorney John Michael Phillips as they interact in the years post shooting. The film follows Rev. Schenck as he meets McBath, a pro-choice Christian, and her attorney John Phillips. It leads to the question: <b>is</b> <b>it</b> <b>possible</b> to be both pro-gun and pro-life? The Armor of Light premiered at the Tribeca Film Festival in April 2015 before opening theatrically on October 30, 2015. In 2017, it was nominated for an Emmy Award.|$|E
25|$|This {{branch of}} {{recursion}} theory analyzed the following question: For fixed m and n with 0<m<n, for which functions A <b>is</b> <b>it</b> <b>possible</b> to compute for any different n inputs x1,x2,...,xn a tuple of n numbers y1,y2,...,yn such {{that at least}} m of the equations A(xk) = yk are true. Such sets are known as (m,n)-recursive sets. The first major result in this branch of Recursion Theory is Trakhtenbrot's result that a set is computable if it is (m,n)-recursive for some m,n with 2m>n. On the other hand, Jockusch's semirecursive sets (which were already known informally before Jockusch introduced them 1968) are examples of a set which is (m,n)-recursive {{if and only if}} 2m<n+1. There are uncountably many of these sets and also some recursively enumerable but noncomputable sets of this type. Later, Degtev established a hierarchy of recursively enumerable sets that are (1,n+1)-recursive but not (1,n)-recursive. After a long phase of research by Russian scientists, this subject became repopularized in the west by Beigel's thesis on bounded queries, which linked frequency computation to the above-mentioned bounded reducibilities and other related notions. One of the major results was Kummer's Cardinality Theory which states that a set A is computable if and only if there is an n such that some algorithm enumerates for each tuple of n different numbers up to n many possible choices of the cardinality of this set of n numbers intersected with A; these choices must contain the true cardinality but leave out at least one false one.|$|E

Can we believe that natural selection could produce, on the one hand, organs of trifling importance, such as {{the tail of a}} giraffe, which serves as a fly-flapper, and, on the other hand, organs of such wonderful structure, as the eye, of which we hardly as yet fully understand the inimitable perfection? ...|$|E
500|$|When {{constructing}} continuous-time stochastic processes certain mathematical difficulties arise, {{due to the}} uncountable index sets, {{which do}} not occur with discrete-time processes.

For example, both the left-continuous modification and the right-continuous modification of a Poisson process have the same finite-dimensional distributions.

500|$|In {{classical}} Athens, women ideally remained {{apart from}} men. This ideology of separation {{was so strong}} that a party to a lawsuit (Lysias' Against Simon) could claim that his sister and nieces were ashamed to be in the presence of their male relatives as evidence that they were respectable. Some historians have accepted this ideology as an accurate description of how Athenian women lived their lives; W. B. Tyrrell, for example, said: [...] "The outer door of the house is the boundary for the free women". [...] However, even in antiquity it was recognised that an ideology of separation could not be practiced by many Athenians.

500|$|The {{problem with}} metaphysical realism, {{according}} to Putnam, {{was that it}} fails to explain the possibility of reference and truth. According to the metaphysical realist, our concepts and categories refer because they match up in some mysterious manner with the pre-structured categories, kinds and individuals that are inherent in the external world. But how <b>is</b> <b>it</b> <b>possible</b> that the world [...] "carves up" [...] into certain structures and categories, the mind carves up the world into its own categories and structures, and the two [...] "carvings" [...] perfectly coincide? The answer must be that the world does not come pre-structured but that structure must be imposed on it by the human mind and its conceptual schemes. [...] In Reason, Truth, and History, Putnam identified truth with what he termed [...] "idealized rational acceptability." [...] The theory, which owes something to C. S. Peirce, is that a belief is true {{if it would be}} accepted by anyone under ideal epistemic conditions.|$|E
500|$|Not surprisingly, Quentin Tarantino {{has lately}} {{become the focus}} {{for this sort of}} {{criticism}} (about the relationship between the movies and acts of violence).

500|$|Philosophy of {{economics}} is {{the branch of}} philosophy which studies philosophical issues relating to economics.

For example, <b>is</b> <b>it</b> <b>possible</b> to research economics in such a way that it is value-free, establishing facts that are independent of the normative views of the researcher? The second topic is the meaning and implications of rationality. For example, can buying lottery tickets (increasing the riskiness of your income) at the same time as buying insurance (decreasing the riskiness of your income) be rational? The third topic is the normative evaluation of economic policies and outcomes. What criteria should be used to determine whether a given public policy is beneficial for society? ...|$|E
