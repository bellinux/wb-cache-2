[...] Bertin's final pose reverses the usual {{relationship between the two}} men. The artist becomes the cool, detached observer; Bertin, usually calm and reasoned, is now restless and impatient, mirroring Ingres' irritation at spending time on portraiture.|$|E

Coming so quickly after my decision to stay on the radio, this was quite an irony. I was given one day of training... from one minute to zero, at which point you have to say goodbye. I did not find that easy at all... I made a real hash of it after one of the early games..... very kindly, suggested a plan... as soon as the count started in our earpieces I would ask him a question, and he would talk until the count reached eight seconds to go. I would then thank him, turn to the camera and tell the audience briefly about the next game to be televised. Miraculously, {{for the rest of the}} tournament I always heard 'zero' <b>in</b> <b>my</b> <b>ear</b> at the moment I said goodbye... the whole experience served to confirm my belief that my decision to stick with Test Match Special was the right one." ...|$|E

The following year, he appeared at The Prince's Trust concert at London's Wembley Arena, performing [...] "While My Guitar Gently Weeps" [...] and [...] "Here Comes the Sun". In February 1987 he joined Dylan, John Fogerty and Jesse Ed Davis on stage for a two-hour performance with the blues musician Taj Mahal. Harrison recalled: [...] "Bob rang me up and asked if I wanted to come out for the evening and see Taj Mahal... So we went there and had a few of these Mexican beers – and had a few more... Bob says, 'Hey, why don't we all get up and play, and you can sing?'

500|$|Vocalist David Draiman states that, lyrically, {{the album}} was {{inspired}} by various occurrences of bad luck that happened to him. [...] "I had a motorcycle accident, and I had my garage burn down with most of my vehicles," [...] Draiman commented. [...] "...I've had really bad relationships that I've {{been in and out}} of. They've left their mark", he concluded. The song [...] "Indestructible" [...] is [...] "an anthem for soldiers", Draiman comments. [...] "It's meant to be something that would make them feel invincible, take away their fear, make them strong and that's what this whole body of work on this record does. It's music to help you feel strong," [...] he concludes. Cuts such as [...] "Deceiver" [...] and [...] "Inside the Fire" [...] are about [...] "really bad relationships". [...] "Inside the Fire" [...] is about [...] "standing over the body of my girlfriend, who just killed herself, and the Devil is standing over me, whispering <b>in</b> <b>my</b> <b>ear</b> to kill myself," [...] says Draiman. The song [...] "The Night" [...] is, [...] "just kind of meant to portray the night almost as like a living entity that sets you free. You're enveloped by it, enmasked by it," [...] Draiman comments. The band's vocalist also says the song [...] "Perfect Insanity" [...] is about [...] "toying with the idea of insanity. Coming at you from the perspective from the individual who is [...] and warning people around him, particularly his love interests, about his psychotic tendencies." [...] Draiman says the track [...] "Divide" [...] "is meant to detract from the idea 'oh, let's all be one, let's all be united!' Fuck that, be yourself, be an individual, stand out, make your mark, make an impact." [...] Commenting on the meaning of the song [...] "Façade", Draiman says it is, [...] "...a song {{from the perspective of a}} girl in a relationship where she's abused... she's thinking about killing him, like you see on the news." ...|$|E

It stars Jeff Daniels and Marlee Matlin as the parents of a Deaf child, played by Noah Valencia, who struggle with deciding to give their child an implant that will allow him to hear again.|$|E

2500|$|About {{six months}} after its British release, Scissor Sisters was {{released}} in the US. To publicize it the band appeared on the popular morning television show Live with Regis and Kelly, an event that Shears later recalled: [...] "Kelly Ripa loved us, after {{the first time we}} played, she gave me a hug and whispered <b>in</b> <b>my</b> <b>ear,</b> 'I {{just want you to know}} that this is my favorite music performance we've ever had.' It was amazing." [...] Nonetheless, neither the band nor the album proved to be a big commercial success in the US: major chain store Wal-Mart refused to stock it, claiming on its website that it contained [...] "a snarling, swaggering attack on conservatism" [...] in the form of the song [...] "Tits on the Radio".|$|E

A poem, {{preserved}} in his sister’s notebook, reads in part: “I stand as one who from a dungeon dream / Of open air and the free arch of stars / Waking to things that be from things that seem / Beats madly on the bars. // I am not yet quite used to be aware / That all my labor & my hope had birth / Only to freeze me with the coffined share / Of void & soulless earth.” ...|$|E

[...] "Find Your Love" [...] was originally written for Rihanna. In a later interview with MTV News Drake said that he felt the song should have been performed by a woman, stating, [...] "Find Your Love is an extremely vulnerable song. And it's actually a huge risk. It almost feels like the song should be performed by a woman. I'm just hoping that men really hear the song and they're honest with themselves. I know a lot of men feel that way." [...] The song was posted on Drake's official blog on April 29, 2010, but was later removed due to bandwidth issues.|$|E
2500|$|When Mrs. Rodenhurst {{told me of}} {{the advent}} to Shrewsbury of Wainwright, I asked her {{if he was in}} his room, or where. 'No,' she said, 'he went out about an hour ago. I think you'll find him in the King's Arms.' I went to the King's Arms and made my very first {{appearance}} in the bar-parlour of a public-house. The room was empty save for one man, dressed in blue serge, with a shrewd lean face. I recognised him. I had seen him playing for Yorkshire at Old Trafford. I introduced myself. 'I'm the assistant pro.,' I explained. 'Art thou?' he replied, 'well, then 'ave a drink wi' me.' I told him I didn't drink — only ginger ale. 'Christ,' he said, 'tha'rt a reight bloody cricketer.' He was a tall man, who walked as though he didn't care a damn for anybody. There was something sinister about him. Every night he got drunk as a matter of course, quietly and masterfully. One day he backed a winner at a glorious price, and towards eleven o'clock that night he and the drill-sergeant of the school arrived arm-in-arm (supporting one another) in the sitting-room of our lodgings. Very gravely Ted introduced me to the drill-sergeant, whom of course I knew very well. The drill-sergeant as gravely introduced Ted to me, then taking my arm, he whispered rather noisily <b>in</b> <b>my</b> <b>ear,</b> 'I'm 'fraid 'e's a l'il drunk, so I've jus' bror him h-home.' Whereupon Ted dissolved into helpless laughter and said, 'My dear sersergeant, don't be 'diculous[...] [...] [...] Bror me home? Why, you ole fool, it's me that's bror you 'ome.' Then (aside), 'E's jus' a l'il drunk, so I've bror him home.' The sergeant hooted with glee. 'Bless m' soul,' he said, 'Ted; jus' lis'en t'me. If you'd bror me home, this would be my lodgin's, see? I would be 'ome, not you. See? But this is your lodgin's—so I mus' 'ave bror you 'ome. See?' ...|$|E
