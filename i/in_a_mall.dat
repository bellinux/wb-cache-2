That same year, members Sooyoung and Hyoyeon were cast into S.M.'s training system through the 2000 S.M. Open Audition, in which Hyoyeon danced for her audition. Yuri was the next Girls' Generation member to become an S.M. trainee after coming second in the 2001 S.M. Youth Best Dancer competition. Yoona was cast the following year through the 2002 S.M. Saturday Open Casting Audition, where she sang and danced to her favorite singers, BoA and Britney Spears.

The 2008 edition of the spree was planned, but was shelved by lawyers who argued it could only take place if a mall gave permission.|$|E

500|$|After seeing men {{working on}} an open {{escalator}} <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>mall</b> around Christmas time, Glen Morgan decided to revisit the character of Eugene Victor Tooms, from the first episode he and co-writer James Wong wrote for the series, [...] "Squeeze". [...] "Tooms" [...] introduced the character of Walter Skinner, although this would be his only appearance in the first season. The character had been conceived as playing against the stereotypical bureaucratic [...] "paper-pusher", being instead someone more [...] "quietly dynamic".|$|E
500|$|... "Complicated" [...] was {{released}} by Arista as the album's lead single, which {{was seen as an}} across-all-age-groups introduction to Lavigne.

The song was a worldwide No. 1 hit and was nominated for two Grammy Awards for Song of the Year and Best Female Pop Vocal Performance.|$|E

500|$|Morgan was {{inspired}} to write this episode after seeing men working on an open escalator <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>mall</b> around Christmas time. He thought of the scare factor from a creature living underneath the escalator, and felt Tooms {{would be the perfect}} choice for the creature. Tooms was the first villain in the show's history to make an appearance in a second episode. It was actor Doug Hutchison's idea to play Tooms nude during the escalator sequence, a decision which Carter felt [...] "caused a little discomfort", but that [...] "actually added to the scene". The bile-like substance coating Tooms and his nest was actually a yellow piping gel, which the cast found would stick to their skin and pull out hair upon removal. Tooms framing Mulder for assault seems to have been inspired by a similar plot point in the film Dirty Harry.|$|E
500|$|Following {{his career}} with the Greyhounds, Vanbiesbrouck moved on to the minor leagues joining the Central Hockey League's (CHL) Tulsa Oilers. [...] During the 1983-84 season, his first with the Oilers, the {{ownership}} group was unable to sustain the team. [...] They went bankrupt, were taken over by the league, and forced to play their remaining games on the road. [...] After losing their home rink the team was housed in Denver, Colorado where they shared a practice facility with the University of Denver and fellow CHL team the Colorado Flames. [...] The lack of ice time often forced the Oilers to practice <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>Mall</b> where they were not allowed to shoot pucks. [...] For extra practice Vanbiesbrouck had tennis balls hit at him in the parking lot. [...] Despite all the adversity the Oilers won the Adams Cup as league champions. Meanwhile, Vanbiesbrouck won the Terry Sawchuk Award, with back-up Ron Scott, for fewest goals against in the league and shared CHL MVP honors with Bruce Affleck by winning the Tommy Ivan Trophy.|$|E
500|$|In 2008, Gates {{appeared}} {{in a series of}} ads to promote Microsoft.

[...] The salesman is trying to sell Mr. Gates shoes that are a size too big. As Gates is buying the shoes, he holds up his discount card, which uses a slightly altered version of his own mugshot of his arrest in New Mexico in 1977, for a traffic violation. As they are walking out of the mall, Seinfeld asks Gates if he has melded his mind to other developers, after getting a [...] "Yes", he then asks if they are working on a way to make computers edible, again getting a [...] "Yes". Some say that this is an homage to Seinfeld's own show about [...] "nothing" [...] (Seinfeld). In a second commercial in the series, Gates and Seinfeld are at the home of an average family trying to fit in with normal people.|$|E

500|$|... "â€¦Baby One More Time" [...] {{has been}} covered on {{numerous}} occasions. One {{of the earliest}} live covers of the song was by the Scottish band Travis, recorded during one of their concerts at [...] "The Bay Tavern" [...] in Robin Hood's Bay, North Yorkshire, England. The song was later included in the release of their 1999 single, [...] "Turn". Lead singer Francis Healey said, [...] "We did it for a laugh the first time. [...] And as we played it, the irony slipped from my smile. It's a very well-crafted song. It [...] that magic thing." [...] The Guardian said this cover showed {{a new and more}} [...] "dark" [...] side of the band, commenting [...] "slowed down to a mournful crawl, it was amazing how ominous the couplet [...] "This loneliness is killing me / Hit me, baby, one more time" [...] sounded". PopWreckoning.com called it [...] "perhaps the most well done cover of Britney's catalyst to eternal fame". Spears heard their version while shopping <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>mall</b> and said, [...] "It was so weird. I liked it though, I thought it was cool. It was a very different vibe from what I did".|$|E
500|$|Chris William of Entertainment Weekly graded {{the show}} a B+ and commented that, despite her age (at the time fourteen), Cyrus was a {{determined}} and likable performer {{who was able}} to command the stage the entire show. He continued to compare her to Britney Spears and Avril Lavigne stylistically and musically, respectively. Jim Abbott of the Orlando Sentinel believed the Best of Both Worlds Tour was as entertaining as concerts performed by Spears or the Backstreet Boys, adding that the show's quality made past Hilary Duff concerts [...] "look like something <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>mall</b> food court." [...] However, Abbott also stated that Cyrus was unable to duplicate the energy of Hannah Montana. Kelefa Sanneh of The New York Times expected to be let down by the concert after the commotion and hype built for it, but was not. She said, [...] "The show was terrific: a two-hour sugar rush and one long challenge to fans, who had to keep up with Ms. Cyrus's hectic pace." [...] Regarding Cyrus, Sanneh stated she was a likable singer, being able to emphasize on certain words and that her demeanor on stage portrayed her as a [...] "hard-working, sweet-natured troublemaker. There's something slightly disruptive about her bright smile [...] And she brings a welcome hint of chaos to everything she does." [...] J. Freedom du Lac of The Washington Post described the concert as [...] "a nearly 90-minute blast of pop in which the charismatic Cyrusâ€“ who complained that she wasn't feeling wellâ€“ commanded the stage with confidence, performing with a particular swagger." [...] Mikael Wood of the Los Angeles Times described the show to be operated at a [...] "frenzied fever pitch" [...] and be only appealing to children, confusing adults with its presentation.|$|E
500|$|Merryman had a {{relationship}} with stock car racing driver Jeff Gordon. She first met Gordon in 2000 while she was employed in Palm Beach, Florida at a Neiman Marcus store <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>mall</b> where she advised customers about cosmetics products. Merryman did not recognize the race-car driver at their first meeting, though her friends were excited to meet him during the same encounter. Initially Merryman turned down Gordon's request to take her out for lunch. One year after their initial encounter, they began {{a relationship}}. They were romantically-linked for 11 months. Merryman and Gordon vacationed together in Saint-Jean, Saint BarthÃ©lemy in the Caribbean in January 2003 to celebrate the New Year. This relationship caused difficulty for his then-ongoing marriage to Brooke Sealy. Sealy discovered Gordon's relationship with Merryman and subsequently divorced the race-car driver. Gordon's wife, who also went by the name Jennifer Brooke Gordon, cited Merryman by name in her divorce papers with the racecar driver. Merryman was featured in the October 2003 issue of Playboy magazine, where she was interviewed about her relationship with Gordon. Merryman stated that Gordon had confided in her: [...] "He got married when he was 23 and has been on the racetrack since he was a kid. He used to tell me all the time he {{never had a chance to}} have fun." [...] She reflected on what she had learned after her period of time with Gordon, saying in the future she would avoid relationships both with men of his occupation and those who were married. Gordon did not comment on Merryman's 2003 appearance in the magazine. When asked about the article, Gordon refused to comment on it. He stated: [...] "It's not even worth commenting on. All I want to talk about is being fast". Gordon's divorce was finalized in June 2003.|$|E
