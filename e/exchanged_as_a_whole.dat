40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to (1) explore the environmental, cultural, and hydrologic characteristics for sustainable development of San-Bu-Keng Creek watershed in Shangan area, Shuili Township, Nantou County, (2) investigate factors of causing debris flow such as terrain, geology, hydrology, land use, (3) evaluate the implemented watershed conservation and management strategies and suggest necessary improvements, and propose suitable land uses for sustainable development. For the debris flow hazards of San-Bu-Keng Creek watershed, the Soil and Water Conservation Bureau had constructed different engineering structures for the initiation, passing and accumulation zones of debris flows. These include landslide treatment, submerged dams, and check dams. During the flood on July 2, 2004, and the heavy rainstorms during typhoon Haitang and Matsa in 2005, these engineering structures appeared to have successfully blocked and eased the damaging effects of debris flows. However, at the area along the channel above intersection of San-Bu-Keng Creek and Chenyoulan River,was occupied by the residents for farming, therefone the San-Bu-Keng Creek was forced to turn at angle of 90 degree and then into Chenyoulan River. This would increase the possibility of severe disasters during major debris flow events in the future. In this study, it was proposed that efforts should be made to straighten the channel to reduce the impacts of future debris flow disasters. After straightening, lands between the areas occupied existent channel and the straightened channel could be <b>exchanged.</b> <b>As</b> <b>a</b> <b>whole,</b> the quantity of engineering structures in the San-Bu-Keng Creek appeared to be moderate and suitable for minimizing debris flow disasters. Other watershed management strategies include evacuation, relocation, public education regarding disaster minimization, promotion of local products such as tea and fruits, and landscape improvement for development of tourism. Therefore the integrated watershed management of San-Bu-Keng Creek can be considered as a successful example in central Taiwan. The possibility of debris flow occurring again of San-Bu-Keng Creek is still high. Therefore the Soil and Water Conservation Bureau helped the residents originally lived in the danger area along the channel to move to the higher and safer area of this watershed. Drills of evacuation for nearby residents were also an important part of disaster mitigation. A single-span crossing suspension bridge was constructed by the Soil and Water Conservation Bureau to help develop local tourism. The original grape and tea production industry, the beautiful mountain and water landscapes,had established the foundation for local diversification development that include leisure agriculture and tourism. All these will help create local job opportunities and decrease the outward migration of Shangan area residents. In the study watershed, four land use zones are proposed with strategies for sustainable development according to ecological and existing social-economic characteristics. These 4 land use zones are (1) the zone for conservation enhancement, (2) zone for evacuation, (3) the leisure farms and (4) the riparian zone along San-Bu-Keng Creek. For the goals of sustainable development, conservation strategies should be developed and implemented in each zone. For achieving these goals, the understanding, support, and participation of the local people is essential. The implementation of various strategies for integrated management of San-Bu-Keng Creek watershed will help (1) reduce the frequency and severity of debris flow disasters, (2) protect the residents of Shangan area and the Tai- 21 provincial roads from flood and debris flow disasters. 本研究以南投縣水里鄉上安地區為對象，主要目的在於探討三廍坑溪集水區有關之環境、人文、水文特性及適合永續發展的土地利用分區配置及相關對策。內容包括：（ 1 ）探討造成土石流現象的地形、地質、水文氣象、土地利用等影響因子；（ 2 ）評估水土保持局推動的集水區保育治理對策之優缺點並提出改善之對策；（ 3 ）以永續發展為導向，研擬兼顧環境、安全、社會經濟考量的合理土地利用方式及配置。 三廍坑溪集水區遇強度高、總量大的暴雨常發生土石流災害，常造成下游上安社區發生屋毀人亡之慘劇。 1996 年賀伯颱風、 1999 年的 921 地震造成水里上安地區溪流集水區源頭裂縫、土層鬆動、坡地崩壞，其後 2001 年的桃芝颱風暴雨更在三廍坑溪造成土石流災害，計有死亡失蹤 17 人，田園流失近百公頃，房屋全倒 26 戶、半倒 29 戶。造成災害的原因包括陡峭地形、鬆散地質與颱風暴雨等自然因子及濫墾濫伐，佔用河道等不當土地利用。 針對本集水區土石流災害問題，水土保持局在土石流的發生段、輸送段及輸送堆積混合段，分別施做源頭崩塌地治理、連續潛壩護岸及防砂壩等相關工程措施。歷經 93 年 72 水災及 94 年海棠颱風與馬莎颱風暴雨，顯示相關土砂消滅工程，均能將土石流在發生時即予以成功攔阻減緩，發揮預期功效。但在三廍坑溪出口銜接陳有蘭溪處，因村民耕作上之需要佔用河道，治理單位遷就當地居民使河道必須以九十度轉彎匯入陳有蘭溪，今後大型土石流發生造成災害的可能性很高。本研究建議將河道改成直行，使河道內之水土砂能迅速匯入陳有蘭溪，降低災害發生的機會。河道改直後，將可利用原本現有河道與改直後河道做為土地交換，可利政策推動，交換後剩餘土地也可作為社區發展之用。 整體而言，因過去颱風及豪雨所釀成災害興辦之防砂治理總工程量，還算適中。加上其它保育治理措施包括土石流整治、避災與遷村、防災教育宣導與觀光旅遊等產業發展工作，三廍坑溪集水區整體保育治理在中台灣地區可算是治理範例。 土石流災害使靠近三廍坑溪河道兩側區內居民家毀人亡，而且今後土石流再發生可能性仍然很高，因此水土保持局協助原先住在溪流兩旁危險區之居民，遷移至本集水區位置較高且安全的區域，這是台灣少數因避災而遷移成功的案例。 水土保持局協助興辦多元化產業發展配套措施，這些措施包括聯結河道兩側的單垮距吊橋（鵲橋）等公共設施，配合本區原已具有的製茶產業及山河優美景觀，再加上民間興建的民宿，奠定本區發展休閒農業及旅遊業之基礎。藉由產業的發展增加就業機會，應可讓都市化發展而逐漸人口外移的上安村，減少人口外移。 依照集水區之生態特性及永續發展概念，本研究對集水區提出綜合保育治理規劃，將集水區分成下列四種區域：a. 山坡地加強保育區、b. 避災遷移區、c. 茶梅休閒育樂區、d. 生態遊樂濱水區，應落實各分區不同的保育管理措施，達到永續發展的目標。土石流具有再現性，規模一次甚於一次，本社區坐落於土石流堆積扇區，為避面土石流再現且溢出河道，建議應於河道兩側設置緩衝帶，現有相關建築物及措施應該因應遷移調整，藉由緩衝帶的設置來避免土石流溢出河道時對人命及建築物的破壞傷害。 集水區合理土地利用及永續發展的各種對策措施的研擬推動，都應需取得集水區內民眾的了解、認同、支持與參與，並藉由政府鼓勵及實際上之支持，讓參與社區發展人數增加，以集思廣益、共同分擔責任，以「責任共負、成果共享」的理念共同努力的方式，達成集水區永續發展的目標。 本集水區的整體保育治理措施及本研究所提的建議如能落實，可使災害之規模及影響性降低。除可有效保護上安社區居民之安全，降低土砂災害規模，並可維護國土保安、土地永續利用及集水區內台 21 線與上安社區之安全。謝 誌	I 摘 要	II ABSTRACT	IV 目 錄	VI 表 目 錄	IX 圖 目 錄	X 第一章. 前言	 1 （一）研究緣起及動機	 1 （二）研究目的	 2 第二章. 文獻回顧	 3 （一）土石流	 3 1. 土石流基本因素	 3 2. 土石流的形成機制與條件	 5 3. 土石流類型	 7 （二）土地利用對水文及穩定特性的影響	 10 （三）集水區整體保育治理與永續發展	 12 第三章. 研究區域與方法	 15 （一）研究流程	 15 （二）研究步驟	 16 1. 資料蒐集	 16 2. 現地勘查	 16 （三）研究區域	 17 1. 地理位置及人口數	 17 2. 水文氣象	 20 3. 地文特性	 21 4. 災害歷史	 27 5. 現況照片	 30 （四）問題分析研判	 33 （五）集水區保育治理對策	 34 第四章. 結果與討論	 35 （一）土石流問題嚴重性及原因	 35 1. 土石流所造成的嚴重性	 35 2. 土石流形成原因(自然環境) 	 36 3. 土石流成災原因(人為因素) 	 47 （二）集水區保育治理對策	 49 1. 土石流治理工程：	 49 2. 避災與遷移	 61 3. 多元化產業發展配套措施	 71 4. 土地永續利用發展為目標的集水區土地利用分區配置、對策及配套措施	 72 5. 區域整體營造	 76 6. 產業發展（旅遊民宿與農業生產推銷）	 77 （三）綜合評論	 79 第五章. 結論與建議	 82 （一）結論	 82 （二）建議	 84 參考文獻	 85 附件、南投縣建築物使用執照住宅類工程造價表	 9...|$|E

40|$|Abstract. Designing {{authenticated}} key exchange algorithms is {{a problem}} well understood in cryptography: there are established security models, and proposals proved secure in these models. However, models currently used assume that a honest entity involved in a key <b>exchange</b> is trusted <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>whole.</b> In many practical contexts, the entity is divided in an authentication device storing a private key and having low computing power, and a computing device, that performs part of the computations required by protocol runs. The computing device might be a PC connected to the Internet, and the authenticating device a smart card. In that case as well in many others, a compromise of the computing device is to be expected. We therefore propose {{a variant of the}} MQV and HMQV key exchange protocols secure in that context, unlike the original protocols. The security claim is supported by a proof in a model derived from the Canetti-Krawczyk one, which takes into account more general rogue behaviours of the computing device. ...|$|R
40|$|Using a {{qualitative}} research methodology, this paper examines {{the responses of}} multinational companies (MNCs), their organisational structures, systems and managers to strategic exchange rate risk, a risk resulting from long-term movements in exchange rates.

This paper seeks to address this inconsistency. Findings from case study research suggest that contrary to results of prior research, companies do attempt to manage the risk, often aligning various organisational factors such as staff and systems to optimise the risk management process. The management of <b>exchange</b> rate risk <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>whole</b> appears to have been an evolutionary process with companies progressing gradually from the management of translation risk in the 1970 s to that of transaction risk in the 1980 s, and more recently to strategic exchange rate risk management...|$|R
40|$|In {{lactic acid}} {{bacteria}} (LAB), amino acids and their derivatives may be converted into amine-containing compounds designated biogenic amines, in pathways providing metabolic energy and/ or acid resistance to the bacteria. In a previous study, a pathway converting tyrosine to tyramine was detected in Lactobacillus brevis and a fragment of a gene possibly involved {{in the production of}} another biogenic amine, putrescine, from agmatine, was detected in the same locus. The present study was carried out to determine if Lb. brevis actually harbours two biogenic amine-producing pathways in the same locus and to investigate the occurrence of the two gene clusters in other bacteria. Sequencing of the DNA locus in Lb. brevis revealed a cluster of six genes that are related to previously reported genes of agmatine deiminase pathways but with marked differences such as two genes encoding putative agmatine deiminases rather than one. Heterologous expression of encoded enzymes confirmed the presence of at least one active agmatine deiminase and one amino acid transporter that efficiently exchanged agmatine and putrescine. It was concluded that the Lb. brevis gene cluster encodes a functional and highly specific agmatine deiminase pathway. Screening of a collection of 197 LAB disclosed the same genes in 36 strains from six different species, and almost all the positive bacteria also contained the tyrosine catabolic pathway genes in the same locus. These results support the hypothesis that the agmatine deiminase and tyrosine catabolic pathways belong to a genomic region that provides acid resistance and that is <b>exchanged</b> horizontally <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>whole</b> between LAB...|$|R
40|$|There {{has been}} much {{historic}} discussion about the effectiveness, or otherwise, of technical trading strategies in the financial markets. The view, that ‘technical analysis’ (TA) may be of limited value in a market seemingly driven by economic fundamentals, {{would seem to be}} supported by research showing that retail Foreign <b>Exchange</b> (FX) traders <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>whole</b> are not achieving returns above that of random trading.

Using a non-optimised, computer based trading simulation, results from over 175 million ‘random’ trades across nine years of data were evaluated to try and establish if such rules exist and to answer the question ‘can a Retail FX Trader ever expect to use technical analysis to achieve net profitable outcomes?’ The results show that the use of Technical Analysis does seem to offer better-than-random results and that setting significantly larger profit targets for trades, versus the maximum loss a trader is prepared to accept, can produce profitable trading, even when using no TA and entering trades randomly...|$|R
40|$|The {{impact of}} oil price {{changes on the}} demand for (and the supply of) {{the output of the}} oil and gas {{industry}} suggests that increased knowledge about the nature and effect of crude oil price movements is likely to be of interest to most institutions and organisations in the global economy. The importance of the energy sector is evident even in countries as widely divergent in industrial and financial structure as the UK and Libya. The two nations have fundamentally different economic structures: the UK operates a classical free-market, private capital-based system, whereas Libya has a more centrally-planned economy and has for many years been dominated by the productive activity of the oil and gas sector. Despite these differences, each country's financial strength appears to be vulnerable to fluctuations in oil prices; in countries such as the UK, this manifests itself most obviously in the potential impact on the values of shares in oil and gas firms. The sector is one of the largest on the London Stock <b>Exchange,</b> which, <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>whole</b> continues to dominate global non-domestic share trading and is critical to the health of the UK's financial services industry. In Libya, the nation's massive dependence on oil export revenues renders the economy especially prone to significant swings in oil prices. However, to date no study has attempted to compare directly the impact of price changes in such disparate environments, and this therefore: (i) investigates the relationship between various risk factors (including oil prices, exchange rates, and interest rates) and oil and gas share returns in the UK; (ii) replicates the same investigation for different sectors to allow the aboye results to be set in context: (iii) examines perceptions of how these risk factors affect the Libyan economy: and (iv) compares the characteristics and the influence of these factors in the UK and Libya at a macro-economic level. The results of parts (i) and (ii) of the empirical analysis suggest that oil price movements have a significant impact on UK-listed oil and gas firms, and that the finding is unique to that sector. This evidence, allied to that of previous studies in other parts of the world, suggests that the finding of a strong empirical link between oil prices and share values in the oil and gas sector is robust across time and national borders. The main finding from part (iii), reflecting a detailed interview survey in Libya, suggests that the state of the Libyan macro- and micro-economy is highly dependent on the oil price; the interviews also reveal a degree of concern about Libya's long-term ability to develop into a multi-industry economic system. The analysis of the impact of oil pricing volatility on macro-economic health indicates that, as predicted by the interviewees, the impact of price changes on the Libyan national economy is highly significant, whereas no significant relationship exists between oil price alterations and the state of the UK economy. Overall however, and despite the very different economic structures existing in the UK and Libya, oil price movements are is shown in the thesis to have impacts on the two countries that are fundamentally different in nature, but potentially highly significant in each case.

The main hypothesis formulated in the paper is that higher social capital will benefit the hierarchy relatively more than the market <b>as</b> <b>a</b> governance mechanism, and therefore in economies with higher social capital, the equilibrium number of entrepreneurs will be lower and their average span of control larger than in economies with lower social capital. The empirical evidence, with data from the Spanish Autonomous Communities, is consistent with this prediction...|$|R
