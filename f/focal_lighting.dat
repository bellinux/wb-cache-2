40|$|BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: Experimental {{assessment}} of anticancer effect, normal tissue damage, and toxicity of intrathoracic mTHPC-mediated photodynamic therapy (PDT) combined to surgery in malignant pleural mesothelioma (MPM) bearing rats. STUDY DESIGN/MATERIALS AND METHODS: Six days after implantation of syngenic malignant mesothelioma {{cells in the}} left chest cavity of Fischer rats (n = 21) and 4 days after sensitization (0. 1 mg/kg mTHPC), a left-sided pneumonectomy was performed, followed by intraoperative light delivery (652 nm, fluence 20 J/cm(2)), either by spherical illumination of the chest cavity (fluence rate 15 mW/cm(2)) or by focal illumination of a tumor area (fluence rate 150 mW/cm(2)). Controls comprised tumor-bearing untreated animals, tumor-bearing animals undergoing pneumonectomy, and tumor-bearing animals undergoing pneumonectomy and light delivery without sensitization or sensitization without light delivery. No thoracocentesis was performed during follow-up. RESULTS: An invasively growing sarcomatous type of mesothelioma was found in all animals at day 10, without tumor necrosis in control animals. PDT resulted in 0. 5 - 1 mm deep inhomogeneous tumor necrosis after spherical, and in a 1 - 2 mm deep tumor necrosis after focal illumination. No injury to mediastinal organs was observed, neither after PDT with spherical nor with <b>focal</b> <b>light</b> delivery except <b>focal</b> interstitial lung fibrosis at the mediastinal area of the opposite lung. All animals with pneumonectomy followed by spherical PDT of the entire tumor-bearing chest cavity died within 72 hours whereas all other animals survived. All animals that died presented massive pleural effusion. CONCLUSIONS: PDT following pneumonectomy in mesothelioma bearing rats was technically feasible and allowed to study its effect on tumor and normal tissues. PDT-related tumor necrosis was observed after spherical and <b>focal</b> <b>light</b> delivery, however, pneumonectomy followed by PDT with spherical light delivery to the tumor-bearing chest cavity resulted in fatal complications...|$|R
40|$|Spectral {{dispersion}} of ultrashort pulses allows simultaneous focusing {{of light in}} both space and time creating so-called spatio-temporal foci. Such space-time coupling may be combined with existing holographic techniques to give a further dimension of control when generating <b>focal</b> <b>light</b> fields.

Exploiting the pulse front tilt generated at focus when applying simultaneous spatial and temporal focusing (SSTF), it is possible to overlap neighbouring foci in time to create a smooth intensity distribution.

40|$|BACKGROUND Reactive {{microglia}} {{are commonly}} seen in retinal degenerative diseases, and neurotoxic microglia responses {{can contribute to}} photoreceptor cell death. We and others have previously shown that translocator protein (18 kDa) (TSPO) is highly induced in retinal degenerations and that the selective TSPO ligand XBD 173 (AC- 5216, emapunil) exerts strong anti-inflammatory effects on microglia in vitro and ex vivo. Here, we investigated whether targeting TSPO with XBD 173 has immuno-modulatory and neuroprotective functions in two mouse models of acute retinal degeneration using bright white light exposure. METHODS BALB/cJ and Cx 3 cr 1 (GFP/+) mice received intraperitoneal injections of 10 mg/kg XBD 173 or vehicle for five consecutive days, starting 1 day prior to exposure to either 15, 000 lux white light for 1 h or 50, 000 lux <b>focal</b> <b>light</b> for 10 min, respectively. The effects of XBD 173 treatment on microglia and Müller cell reactivity were analyzed by immuno-stainings of retinal sections and flat mounts, fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) analysis, and mRNA expression of microglia markers using quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR). Optical coherence tomography (OCT), terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase dUTP nick end labeling (TUNEL) stainings, and morphometric analyses were used to quantify the extent of retinal degeneration and photoreceptor apoptosis. RESULTS Four days after the mice were challenged with bright white light, {{a large number of}} amoeboid-shaped alerted microglia appeared in the degenerating outer retina, which was nearly completely prevented by treatment with XBD 173. This treatment also down-regulated the expression of TSPO protein in microglia but did not change the TSPO levels in the retinal pigment epithelium (RPE). RT-PCR analysis showed that the microglia/macrophage markers Cd 68 and activated microglia/macrophage whey acidic protein (Amwap) as well as the pro-inflammatory genes Ccl 2 and Il 6 were reduced after XBD 173 treatment. Light-induced degeneration of the outer retina was nearly fully blocked by XBD 173 treatment. We further confirmed these findings in an independent mouse model of <b>focal</b> <b>light</b> damage. Retinas of animals receiving XBD 173 therapy displayed significantly more ramified non-reactive microglia and more viable arrestin-positive cone photoreceptors than vehicle controls. CONCLUSIONS Targeting TSPO with XBD 173 effectively counter-regulates microgliosis and ameliorates light-induced retinal damage, highlighting a new pharmacological concept for the treatment of retinal degenerations...|$|R
40|$|Aim: Contrast {{sensitivity}} (CS) provides {{important information}} on visual function. This study aimed to assess differences in clinical expediency of the CS increment-matched new back-lit and original paper {{versions of the}} Melbourne Edge Test (MET) to determine the CS of the visually impaired. Methods: The back-lit and paper MET were administered to 75 visually impaired subjects (28 - 97 years). Two versions of the back-lit MET acetates were used to match the CS increments with the paper-based MET. Measures of CS were repeated after 30 min {{and again in the}} presence of a <b>focal</b> <b>light</b> source directed onto the MET. Visual acuity was measured with a Bailey-Lovie chart and subjects rated how much difficulty they had with face and vehicle recognition. Results: The back-lit MET gave a significantly higher CS than the paper-based version (14. 2 ± 4. 1 dB vs 11. 3 ± 4. 3 dB, p < 0. 001). A significantly higher reading resulted with repetition of the paper-based MET (by 1. 0 ± 1. 7 dB, p < 0. 001), but this was not evident with the back-lit MET (by 0. 1 ± 1. 4 dB, p = 0. 53). The MET readings were increased by a <b>focal</b> <b>light</b> source, in both the back-lit (by 0. 3 ± 0. 81, p < 0. 01) and paper-based (1. 2 ± 1. 7, p < 0. 001) versions. CS as measured by the back-lit and paper-based versions of the MET was significantly correlated to patients' perceived ability to recognise faces (r = 0. 71, r = 0. 85 respectively; p < 0. 001) and vehicles (r = 0. 67, r = 0. 82 respectively; p < 0. 001), and with distance visual acuity (both r =- 0. 64; p < 0. 001). Conclusions: The CS increment-matched back-lit MET gives higher CS values than the old paper-based test by approximately 3 dB and is more repeatable and less affected by external light sources. Clinically, the MET score provides information on patient difficulties with visual tasks, such as recognising faces. © 2005 The College of Optometrists...|$|R

40|$|Laser speckle flowmetry (LSF) was {{initially}} developed to measure blood {{flow in the}} retina. More recently, its primary application has been to image baseline blood flow and activity-dependent changes in blood flow in the brain. We now describe experiments in the rat retina in which LSF was {{used in conjunction with}} confocal microscopy to monitor light-evoked changes in blood flow in retinal vessels. This dual imaging technique permitted us to stimulate retinal photoreceptors and measure vessel diameter with confocal microscopy while simultaneously monitoring blood flow with LSF. We found that a flickering light dilated retinal arterioles and evoked increases in retinal blood velocity with similar time courses. In addition, <b>focal</b> <b>light</b> stimulation evoked local increases in blood velocity. The spatial distribution of these increases depended on the location of the stimulus relative to retinal arterioles and venules. The results suggest that capillaries are largely unresponsive to local neuronal activity and that hemodynamic responses are mediated primarily by arterioles.

Animals studied: Five dogs, five cats, and five rabbits with clear media were imaged using a prototype of the D-EYE. Procedure: The optical device was composed of lenses, polarizing filters, a beam splitter, a diaphragm, and mirrors, attached to a smartphone via a metal shell. Images were obtained 20 min after pupil dilation with topical 0. 5 % tropicamide in a darkened room, to ensure maximum pupillary dilation. Focus was set to the infinite when the autofocus was overwhelmed. Light intensity was adapted to each animal via the application (minimum light intensity for imaging the tapetal region, maximum light intensity for imaging the nontapetal region). Both still images and video sequences were recorded for each animal. Results: Posterior segment structures were visible in all animals: optic nerve head, tapetum lucidum (when present), nontapetal region, retinal vessels, and choroidal vessels (when the retinal pigment epithelium and the choroidal pigmentation were discreet). <b>Focal</b> <b>light</b> artifacts were common when photographing the tapetum lucidum.

40|$|Optical {{coherence}} tomography (OCT) {{is a novel}} {{method of}} retinal in vivo imaging. In this study, we assessed the potential of OCT to yield histology-analogue sections in mouse models of retinal degeneration. We achieved to adapt a commercial 3 (rd) generation OCT system to obtain and quantify high-resolution morphological sections of the mouse retina which so far required in vitro histology. OCT and histology were compared in models with developmental defects, light damage, and inherited retinal degenerations. In conditional knockout mice deficient in retinal retinoblastoma protein Rb, the gradient of Cre expression from center to periphery, leading to a gradual reduction of retinal thickness, was clearly visible and well topographically quantifiable. In Nrl knockout mice, the layer involvement {{in the formation of}} rosette-like structures was similarly clear as in histology. OCT examination of <b>focal</b> <b>light</b> damage, well demarcated by the autofluorescence pattern, revealed a practically complete loss of photoreceptors with preservation of inner retinal layers, but also more subtle changes like edema formation. In Crb 1 knockout mice (a model for Leber's congenital amaurosis), retinal vessels slipping through the outer nuclear layer towards the retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) {{due to the lack of}} adhesion in the subapical region of the photoreceptor inner segments could be well identified. We found that with the OCT we were able to detect and analyze a wide range of mouse retinal pathology, and the results compared well to histological sections. In addition, the technique allows to follow individual animals over time, thereby reducing the numbers of study animals needed, and to assess dynamic processes like edema formation. The results clearly indicate that OCT has the potential to revolutionize the future design of respective short- and long-term studies, as well as the preclinical assessment of therapeutic strategies. ...|$|R

40|$|Photodynamic therapy (PDT) {{is based}} on the {{preferential}} uptake and retention of a photosensitizer (PS) in metabolically more active cells then <b>focal</b> <b>light</b> activation of the PS in the presence of molecular oxygen which leads to cytotoxicity. Compared to other cancer therapies, PDT has some advantages in that it spares the tissue architecture, is minimally invasive, does not damage tissue outside the treated area and can be used repeatedly with no serious side effects or development of resistance. However, PDT with the currently approved photosensitizers is not without adverse effects such as prolonged widespread photosensitivity. We propose using glucosamine, a natural glucose analogue widely used as a dietary supplement, to potentiate the PDT effect. Glucosamine was first reported as an inhibitor of tumour growth by Quastel and Cantero in 1953 and various in vivo and in vitro studies have confirmed the inhibitory effect. In our experiments, we used glucosamine together with disulfonated aluminium phthalocyanine (AIPcS 2), one of the most clinically effective second-generation photosensitizers, on MCF- 7 cell cultures. Dark toxicity and phototoxicity were studied by propidium iodide exclusion assay using fluorescence microscopy and flow cytometry. Dark toxicity was minimal and phototoxicity showed that AIPcS 2 in the presence of human physiologically tolerable glucosamine increased cell death by around 15 % compared to AIPcS 2 alone. Our findings raise the possibility of using a combination of photosensitizers and glucosamine clinically in a simple and cheap way to improve the efficiency of PDT treatment. The combination might therefore help in lowering the dose of photosensitizer that patients need to receive in order to achieve an optimal PDT effect. This has a very important implication in that it can reduce treatment toxicity and other side effects associated with PDT treatment. Further studies are required in order to see if these observations on MCF- 7 cell line can be replicated in other established cancer cell lines and in vivo...|$|R
