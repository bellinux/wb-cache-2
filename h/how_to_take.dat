5|$|Amato's {{prospective}} buyer is intercepted and arrested. The FBI {{had initially}} planned to send {{one of their}} agents undercover in his place, but Tubbs volunteers for the role, fearing the agent is too inexperienced. Tubbs meets with Amato and his henchmen, who demonstrate one of the Stingers and explain <b>how</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> out a civilian airplane with an unarmed missile. Tubbs agrees to purchase all of Amato's inventory and arranges another meet to make the buy. That night, Crockett, surveilling Amato's house, sees him beat Rita again, and is unable to intervene.|$|E
5|$|William Bell, Seward's butler, {{answered}} the door when Powell knocked slightly after 10p.m. Powell told Bell that he had medicine from Seward's physician, and that his instructions were to personally show Seward <b>how</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> it. Overcoming Bell's skepticism, Powell made {{his way up the}} stairs to Seward's third-floor bedroom. At the top of the staircase he was stopped by Seward's son, Assistant Secretary of State Frederick W. Seward, to whom he repeated the medicine story; Frederick, suspicious, said his father was asleep.|$|E
40|$|One {{hundred and}} fifty four {{patients}} were interviewed to determine the type and source of information that they had received about drugs that had been prescribed for them. Most had been told <b>how</b> often <b>to</b> <b>take</b> the drugs (145 (94 %)) and <b>how</b> much <b>to</b> <b>take</b> each time (143 (93 %)), but few had been informed about side effects (49 (32 %)) and fewer had received written information (22 (14 %)). Pharmacists most commonly supplied information about <b>how</b> often <b>to</b> <b>take</b> the drugs (105 (68 %)), <b>how</b> much <b>to</b> <b>take</b> each time (99 (64 %)), {{and the best way}} <b>to</b> <b>take</b> it (109 (71 %)). Doctors most often gave information about duration of treatment (116 (75)) and possible side effects (126 (82 %)). Few patients requested specific information on their own initiative.

5|$|Early {{approaches}} to preserving food used variants of traditional cold boxes {{to solve the}} problem of <b>how</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> small quantities of products short distances to market. Thomas Moore, an engineer from Maryland, invented an early refrigerator which he patented in 1803; this involved a large, insulated wooden box, with a tin container of ice embedded in the top. This refrigerator primarily relied upon simple insulation, rather than ventilation, but the design was widely adopted by farmers and small traders, and illegal copies abounded. By the 1830s portable refrigerator chests became used in the meat trade, taking advantage of the growing supplies of ice to use ventilation to better preserve the food. By the 1840s, improved supplies and an understanding of the importance of circulating air was making a significant improvement to refrigeration in the U.S.|$|E
5|$|The name of Sejanus {{continued}} to be pressed into political service during the 18th century. Prime Minister Robert Walpole was attacked in 1735 {{in the course of}} a popular skit, C----- and country: A play of seven acts...the whole concluding with the grand masque, call'd, The downfall of Sejanus; its authorship is attributed to 'a masquerader' and in the printed version the masque precedes the play, although it is performed last. This gives the clue of <b>how</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> what is to follow and consists of a conversation between Punch and the Hangman, opening with the question 'Is this same Sejanus to go out of the World like a Man, or to die the Death of a mad Dog? For he has lived like a sad One, from the first Day that the Emperor Tiberius took him into Favour.' A subtler attack on a later prime minister occurred in 1769 when Jonson's Sejanus was reissued under the title of The Favourite. This was prefaced with a tongue-in-cheek dedication to Lord Bute, denying that there can be any comparison between the conduct of Sejanus and that of his lordship.|$|E

Seng borrowed a friend's camera and researched <b>how</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> photos on the Internet.

25|$|Usually, in {{response}} to any proposed economic development, French settlers would marshal their influence in order to reap the major benefits. For many French, such benefits were the raison d'être for their living in Tunisia. If the local French administrator on occasion decided against them, they would hasten to appeal to their political contacts in Paris. These they carefully cultivated, e.g., through the large, political pressure group Parti-Colonial. A growing conflict naturally emerged between {{the interests of the}} settlers and those of Tunisians; a struggle which became increasingly sour. The French officials themselves were sometimes uncomfortably divided as to which course to take, and exactly <b>how</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> it.|$|E

25|$|In 1997 Jones had {{his first}} {{professional}} loss, a disqualification against Montell Griffin (26-0, 18 KOs) at the Taj Majal Hotel & Casino in Atlantic City, New Jersey. Griffin was trained by the legendary Eddie Futch, who had taught him <b>how</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> advantage of Jones technical mistakes and lack of basic boxing fundamentals. Griffin jumped out to an early lead on Jones but by round 9 Jones was ahead on the scorecards by a point and had Griffin on the canvas early in round nine. But as Griffin took a knee on the canvas to avoid further punishment, Jones hit him twice. Subsequently, Jones was disqualified and lost his title. At the time of disqualification, Jones was ahead {{on two of the}} judges scorecards (75-76, 77-75, 76-75).|$|E
25|$|Citizens of the United States are {{entitled}} to a host of social benefits. Government programs such as Food Stamps and Medicaid can provide support for low-income families. However, children who are U.S. citizens may not always be able to fully enjoy these benefits. Immigrant parents with limited English language ability may be unaware they are eligible for such benefits, or may not know <b>how</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> advantage of social welfare programs. Even legal non-citizens may find that their access to social supports is restricted due to welfare reforms. In addition, parents who are undocumented may be afraid to deal with government agencies, even if their citizen children are eligible for such assistance programs. When there is risk of deportation, it affects the likelihood of a mixed-status mother's use social services. The anti-immigrant sentiment increases this and then would deter mixed-status mothers to not to participate in government programs in which their U.S. born children are eligible to receive.|$|E
25|$|Charlotte Corday {{arrives in}} Paris at dawn. In a square she meets Camille, her {{childhood}} friend, now a deputy to the National Convention. He is disappointed, defeated, and fears for his life. Amongst {{the crowd is}} Gaston, who tells Charlotte {{that he is the}} bodyguard and faithful friend of Marat. Their conversation is interrupted by a commotion which arises around a bakery. In play, a group of children act out the events of the Revolution. The square slowly empties out, except for a child who is left behind by his playmates, tied up as a victim. Charlotte releases and comforts him, thereby building up courage herself, then she buys a long-bladed knife and a shawl from a pedlar. Marat arrives surrounded by an adulating crowd which, at the same time, notices his fatigue and ill-health. Charlotte attracts his attention for a moment, then he continues on to the hall of the Convention. She does not know <b>how</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> advantage of the situation to kill him.
