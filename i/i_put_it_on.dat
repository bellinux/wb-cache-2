500|$|I'd gone to CBS, and I'd become {{convinced}} Beverly Hillbillies {{was going}} to work. Bill Paley wasn't convinced. Bill has this great sense of propriety. Putting aside the Sarnoffs {{and all the other}} great names of broadcasting, Paley stood– stands– head and shoulders above everyone else. He had this blasting genius of instinctively looking at a show and knowing if it should be on the air. He could also be ruthless and distant ... But Bill was intuitive about both the business and creative sides of TV. And he genuinely disliked Beverly Hillbillies. <b>I</b> <b>put</b> <b>it</b> <b>on</b> the schedule anyway.|$|E
500|$|The New York Times {{presented}} {{three stories}} that it felt were particularly emotional: {{the first was}} {{about a woman who}} removed miniskirts from her college wardrobe after being raped, but continued wearing her favorite boots; another was about wedding attire anxieties; and the third was about the choice of adorning a newly reconstructed breast with a tattoo. The same article also noted a humorous ode to black {{as a part of a}} wardrobe or in fact as a wardrobe, when one character notes: [...] "Sometimes I buy something that isn't black, and <b>I</b> <b>put</b> <b>it</b> <b>on</b> and I am so sorry".|$|E
500|$|On the {{original}} LP's third disc, entitled Apple Jam, {{four of the}} five tracks – [...] "Out of the Blue", [...] "Plug Me In", [...] "I Remember Jeep" [...] and [...] "Thanks for the Pepperoni" [...] – are improvised instrumentals built around minimal chord changes, {{or in the case of}} [...] "Out of the Blue", a single-chord riff. The title for [...] "I Remember Jeep" [...] originated from the name of Clapton's dog, Jeep, and [...] "Thanks for the Pepperoni" [...] came from a line on a Lenny Bruce comedy album. In a December 2000 interview with Billboard magazine, Harrison explained: [...] "For the jams, I didn't want to just throw [...] in the cupboard, and yet at the same time it wasn't part of the record; that's why <b>I</b> <b>put</b> <b>it</b> <b>on</b> a separate label to go in the package as a kind of bonus." ...|$|E

500|$|Wainwright {{attended}} McGill University in Montreal for a {{short time}} to study Classical music composition. With his mother's support, he began writing pop songs and learned how to play guitar. Wainwright started performing at the night club Sarajevo, and eventually recorded a demo tape with record producer Pierre Marchand, a family friend, who had worked with Kate and Anna and who later produced Wainwright's second studio album Poses. Songs were recorded at Marchand's studio in Morin-Heights, Quebec, and no edits were made to the simple live tunes. The tape impressed Wainwright's father, who passed the songs along to producer Van Dyke Parks, who in turn presented them to DreamWorks executive Lenny Waronker. Waronker had signed McGarrigle to Warner Bros. Records in the 1970s. Describing his initial reaction to Wainwright's music, Waronker stated: [...] "When I was about to listen to his tape, I remember clearly I was thinking, 'Gee, if he has the mom's musicality and smarts, and the dad's smarts and voice, that'd be nice.' Then <b>I</b> <b>put</b> <b>it</b> <b>on</b> and I said, 'Oh, my God, this is stunning. Wainwright acknowledged that having musicians as parents gave him a [...] "foot in the door", but attributed his success to hard work.|$|E
2500|$|Further {{evidence}} of John's political development {{is found in}} a letter of October 1842, to his friend John Martin, responding to Martin's sending him a copy of The Nation: [...] "I think The Nation will do very well"; and again in October, on the arrival of 20,000 additional troops in Ireland: [...] "How {{do you think the}} country will take all this?" [...] he asks, [...] "I think I know how it ought to take it; but if <b>I</b> <b>put</b> <b>it</b> <b>on</b> paper, you might inform the Attorney-General, and get me arrested." ...|$|E
2500|$|Through weekly {{shows at}} Cafe Sarajevo, Wainwright {{was on the}} Montreal club circuit and {{eventually}} cut a series of demo tapes produced by Pierre Marchand, who later produced Wainwright's album Poses. The resulting tapes impressed his father Loudon, who passed them on to his friend Van Dyke Parks. Parks sent the recordings to Lenny Waronker, the DreamWorks executive who eventually signed Wainwright to his label. Waronker stated the following of Wainwright: [...] "When I was about {{to listen to his}} tape, I remember clearly I was thinking, 'Gee, if he has the mom's musicality and smarts, and the dad's smarts and voice, that'd be nice.' Then <b>I</b> <b>put</b> <b>it</b> <b>on</b> and I said, 'Oh, my God, this is stunning.'" ...|$|E

6000|$|Nettie laughed. “Well,” she said, “I {{feel very}} like a torpedo. Anyway, <b>I</b> didn’t <b>put</b> <b>it</b> <b>on,</b> though I’m open {{to admit that}} there’s quite a trace of the peacock about me.” ...|$|R

2500|$|Chrétien {{responded to}} the media's {{questions}} about the incident at a press conference. He {{was asked about the}} pepper-spraying by a Vancouver-based comedic reporter known as [...] "Nardwuar the Human Serviette", a frequent contributor to Canada's MuchMusic network, known for his high-pitched voice and odd attire, who told Chrétien that there was a song released by a punk rock band called [...] "The Nomads" [...] (a fictitious band Nardwuar had made up) called [...] "The Suharto Stomp". Nardwuar then asked Chrétien [...] "Do you think, if you were say 40 years younger, that you too would be writing punk songs about Suharto and protesting against APEC?" [...] Chrétien replied that he himself had protested as a student, and that in a democracy, protests were to be expected. Nardwuar followed up by telling the Prime Minister that [...] "Some of the protesters were maced." [...] Chrétien asked, [...] "What do you mean by that?" [...] Nardwuar then clarified, [...] "Mace? Pepper spray?" [...] Chrétien then stated abruptly, [...] "I don't know, these techniques did not exist in those days", which received big laughs from everyone in the room. Nardwuar simply smiled at Chrétien's joke, and the Prime Minister concluded his answer by adding [...] "For me, pepper, <b>I</b> <b>put</b> <b>it</b> <b>on</b> my plate", with a smile while pantomiming shaking pepper onto a plate. This line also received laughter. However, allegations soon arose that someone in the Prime Minister's Office or Chrétien himself gave the go-ahead for the pepper-spraying of protesters. Chrétien denied any involvement, and it has never been proven.|$|E

6000|$|I {{went down}} into the forecastle, and here Tony Dibble, a hand, managed to hunt me up some dry clothing. While <b>I</b> was <b>putting</b> <b>it</b> <b>on</b> the old sailor stood by, and {{presently}} said: ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You are the best-natured, kindest {{creature}} in the world, Deborah.--But {{you have never}} seen the ring I bought for you at Paris. Nay, <b>I</b> will <b>put</b> <b>it</b> <b>on</b> your finger myself;--what! your foster-son, whom you loved so well, and took such care of?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I have it here, madam," [...] Magdalene said; [...] "but it {{was useless}} to leave it up there for him, for he would {{have no idea how}} to fold it rightly. Now sit down on that stool, sir, and <b>I</b> will <b>put</b> <b>it</b> <b>on</b> for you." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I wasn't keeping {{anything}} {{back from}} you. I don't mind {{telling you what}} would happen if <b>I</b> <b>put</b> <b>it</b> <b>on.</b> You'd never see again. You'd be stone-blind the rest of your days." ...|$|E
60|$|He {{held out}} his hand to say good-by. I insisted on his taking up his abode with me, for the present at least. Ordinary persuasion failed to induce him to yield. <b>I</b> <b>put</b> <b>it</b> <b>on</b> selfish grounds next.|$|E
6000|$|... "It will {{be ready}} in five minutes. This roker is a very thick one. <b>I</b> <b>put</b> <b>it</b> <b>on</b> as soon as I heard you stirring, {{and it is not}} quite ready yet. That was a pretty near escape last night, Bill." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "What's {{the meaning}} of this, ma'am? Don't get trying any little games upon me," [...] said I, in my roughest way--and <b>I</b> can <b>put</b> <b>it</b> <b>on</b> rough when <b>I</b> like.

50|$|I don't {{classify}} {{myself as}} an abstract artist. If the feeling is abstract, then yes, I am painting abstract -- the feeling and the subconscious emotions are slowing pushed out.

6000|$|... "Impossible, child. I {{could not}} eat with {{appetite}} {{while this is}} puzzling my brain. Let me see; there were fifteen pounds, apparently, spent last year, when <b>I</b> <b>put</b> <b>it</b> <b>on</b> paper, and yet here is a sovereign over," [...] said Mrs Foster, holding up the coin, and looking at it reproachfully, as if the blame lay with it and not with herself.|$|E
6000|$|... "Matter! That {{stuff was}} TOOTH-POWDER, that's what it was.

I am afraid I never shall do that," [...] she added soberly.|$|E
5000|$|When {{asked about}} if the wet Fender guitar {{used on the}} cover was real, John said, [...] "Oh yes, {{it is a real}} photo. I bought a new Fender Stratocaster just for this occasion.

6000|$|... "I {{beg your}} pardon--that's exactly what <b>I</b> do <b>put</b> <b>it</b> <b>on</b> for. <b>It's</b> exactly {{the thing that}} I'm reduced to doing for myself.
