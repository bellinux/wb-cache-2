5|$|Some {{of these}} special cases are {{much easier to}} solve than the general case of three given circles. The two {{simplest}} cases are the problems of drawing a circle through three given points (PPP) or tangent to three lines (LLL), which were solved first by Euclid in his Elements. For example, the PPP problem can be solved as follows. The center of the solution circle is equally distant from all three points, and therefore must lie on the perpendicular bisector line of any two. Hence, the center {{is the point of}} intersection of any two perpendicular bisectors. Similarly, in the LLL case, the center must lie on a line bisecting the angle at the three intersection points between the three given lines; hence, the center lies at the <b>intersection</b> <b>point</b> of two such angle bisectors. Since there are two such bisectors at every <b>intersection</b> <b>point</b> of the three given lines, there are four solutions to the general LLL problem.|$|E
5|$|Any initial two {{disjoint}} given circles can {{be rendered}} concentric as follows. The radical {{axis of the}} two given circles is constructed; choosing two arbitrary points P and Q on this radical axis, two circles can be constructed that are centered on P and Q and that intersect the two given circles orthogonally. These two constructed circles intersect each other in two points. Inversion in one such <b>intersection</b> <b>point</b> F renders the constructed circles into straight lines emanating from F and the two given circles into concentric circles, with the third given circle becoming another circle (in general). This follows because the system of circles is equivalent {{to a set of}} Apollonian circles, forming a bipolar coordinate system.|$|E
50|$|There are two {{versions}} of the board perhaps {{due to the lack of}} clarity in Stewart Culin's diagram. The rules to both versions are the same. Both versions contain 25 <b>intersection</b> <b>points.</b> The middle row has 9 <b>intersection</b> <b>points,</b> and the two outer rows has 8 <b>intersection</b> <b>points</b> each.

25|$|To {{compute the}} {{intersection}} of the curve defined by the polynomial p with the line of equation ax+by+c = 0, one solves the equation of the line for x (or for y if a = 0). Substituting the result in p, one gets a univariate equation q(y) = 0 (or q(x) = 0, if the equation of the line has been solved in y), each of whose roots is one coordinate of an <b>intersection</b> <b>point.</b> The other coordinate is deduced from the equation of the line. The multiplicity of an <b>intersection</b> <b>point</b> is the multiplicity of the corresponding root. There is an <b>intersection</b> <b>point</b> at infinity if the degree of q is lower than the degree of p; the multiplicity of such an <b>intersection</b> <b>point</b> at infinity is the difference of the degrees of p and q.|$|E

50|$|Adjacent cubes share all edges in the {{connecting}} face, including the same diagonal. This {{is an important}} property to prevent cracks in the rendered surface, because interpolation of the two distinct diagonals of a face usually gives slightly different <b>intersection</b> <b>points.</b> An added benefit is that up to five computed <b>intersection</b> <b>points</b> can be reused when handling the neighbor cube.

25|$|The last {{stage in}} finding the Cournot {{equilibrium}} is to find firm 2’s reaction function. In this case it is symmetrical to firm 1’s as {{they have the same}} cost function. The equilibrium is the <b>intersection</b> <b>point</b> of the reaction curves. See diagram 4.|$|E
25|$|Knowing {{the points}} of {{intersection}} of a curve with a given line is frequently useful. The intersection with the axes of coordinates and the asymptotes are useful to draw the curve. Intersecting with a line parallel to the axes allows one to find at least a point in each branch of the curve. If an efficient root-finding algorithm is available, this allows to draw the curve by plotting the <b>intersection</b> <b>point</b> with all the lines parallel to the y-axis and passing through each pixel on the x-axis.|$|E

25|$|Steinitz' {{original}} proof involved {{finding a}} sequence of Δ-Y and Y-Δ transforms that reduce any 3-connected planar graph to K4, the graph of the tetrahedron. A Y-Δ transform removes a degree-three vertex from a graph, adding edges between all of its former neighbors if those edges did not already exist; the reverse transformation, a Δ-Y transform, removes the edges of a triangle from a graph and replaces them by a new degree-three vertex adjacent to the same three vertices. Once such a sequence is found, it can be reversed to give {{a sequence of}} Δ-Y and Y-Δ transforms that build up the desired polyhedron step by step starting from a polyhedron. Each Y-Δ transform transform in this sequence can be performed by slicing off a degree-three vertex from a polyhedron. A Δ-Y transform can be performed by removing a triangular face from a polyhedron and extending its neighboring faces until {{the point where they}} meet, but only when that triple <b>intersection</b> <b>point</b> of the three neighboring faces is on the correct side of the polyhedron; when the triple <b>intersection</b> <b>point</b> is not on the correct side, a projective transformation of the polyhedron suffices to move it to the correct side. Therefore, by induction on the number of Δ-Y and Y-Δ transforms needed to reduce a given graph to K4, every polyhedral graph can be realized as a polyhedron.|$|E
25|$|The Basin Reserve is also {{surrounded}} by numerous other Wellington landmarks, including Mount Cook Barracks, the National War Memorial, several colleges and high schools, the Caledonian Hotel {{and the former}} Dominion Museum. A fire station is located {{across the street from}} the ground: traditionally its occupants would watch ongoing matches during their down-time, and would set off the station's siren to mark New Zealand wickets taken or when a batsman reached a milestone like a 50 or century. The Basin Reserve is the <b>intersection</b> <b>point</b> for the Wellington suburbs of Mount Cook, Newtown and Mount Victoria.|$|E
30|$|After obtaining all {{parameters}} of the pair of conics, the four <b>intersection</b> <b>points</b> of two conics on the model plane and their projections can be computed.

For complex <b>intersection</b> <b>points</b> without physical position, it is impossible to directly find their correspondences in the image.|$|R

30|$|The {{horizontal}} {{variation of}} <b>intersection</b> <b>points</b> of straight trajectories from individual pulses, {{together with the}} fact that the depth of <b>intersection</b> <b>points</b> lies within the range of z derived by CAM, might also serve as an indication for a typical pulse width: a pulse which has an initial width of 2 r should be characterized by <b>intersection</b> <b>points</b> that are up to approximately 10 m deeper than the z value provided by CAM. The fact that there is no significant difference between the result of CAM and the depth values of <b>intersection</b> <b>points</b> suggests that the pulses analyzed were punctuating jets with a comparatively small initial width, rather than bursts with a width of 2 r.|$|R
25|$|Projective spaces can {{be studied}} as a {{separate}} field in mathematics, but are also used in various applied fields, geometry in particular. Geometric objects, such as points, lines, or planes, can be given a representation as elements in projective spaces based on homogeneous coordinates. As a result, various relations between these objects {{can be described in}} a simpler way than is possible without homogeneous coordinates. Furthermore, various statements in geometry can be made more consistent and without exceptions. For example, in the standard Euclidean geometry for the plane, two lines always intersect at a point except when parallel. In a projective representation of lines and points, however, such an <b>intersection</b> <b>point</b> exists even for parallel lines, and it can be computed {{in the same way as}} other intersection points.|$|E
25|$|Some authors {{add more}} {{constraints}} {{to the definition}} of a drawing, for instance that each pair of edges have at most one <b>intersection</b> <b>point</b> (a shared endpoint or crossing). For the crossing number as defined above, these constraints make no difference, because a crossing-minimal drawing cannot have edges with multiple intersection points. If two edges with a shared endpoint cross, the drawing can be changed locally at the crossing point, leaving the rest of the drawing unchanged, to produce a different drawing with one fewer crossing. And similarly, if two edges cross two or more times, the drawing can be changed locally at two crossing points to make a different drawing with two fewer crossings. However, these constraints are relevant for variant definitions of the crossing number that, for instance, count only the numbers of pairs of edges that cross rather than the number of crossings.|$|E
500|$|The {{property}} of tangency {{is defined as}} follows. First, a point, line or circle {{is assumed to be}} tangent to itself; hence, if a given circle is already tangent to the other two given objects, it is counted as a solution to Apollonius' problem. Two distinct geometrical objects are said to intersect if they have a point in common. By definition, a point is tangent to a circle or a line if it intersects them, that is, if it lies on them; thus, two distinct points cannot be tangent. If the angle between lines or circles at an <b>intersection</b> <b>point</b> is zero, they are said to be tangent; the <b>intersection</b> <b>point</b> is called a tangent point or a point of tangency. (The word [...] "tangent" [...] derives from the Latin present participle, tangens, meaning [...] "touching".) In practice, two distinct circles are tangent if they intersect at only one point; if they intersect at zero or two points, they are not tangent. The same holds true for a line and a circle. Two distinct lines cannot be tangent in the plane, although two parallel lines can be considered as tangent at a point at infinity in inversive geometry (see below).|$|E
40|$|An {{approach}} {{using two}} intersecting circles is proposed as a linear approach for determining a camera's intrinsic parameters. The two intersecting coplanar circles have four <b>intersection</b> <b>points</b> in the projective plane: two real points and two circular points. In the image plane, the diagonal triangle - {{on which the}} image of the four <b>intersection</b> <b>points</b> composes a complete quadrangle - is a self-polar triangle for the projection curves of the circles. The vertex of the self-polar triangle is the null space of the degenerate conic formed by {{the image of the}} four <b>intersection</b> <b>points.</b> By solving the three vertices of the self-polar triangle using the image coordinates of the two real <b>intersection</b> <b>points,</b> the degenerate conic can be obtained. The image of the two circular points is then computed from the <b>intersection</b> <b>points</b> of the degenerate conic. Using the image of the circular points from the three images of the same planar pattern with different directions, the intrinsic parameters can be linearly determined...|$|R
