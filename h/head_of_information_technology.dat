40|$|This chapter {{reports the}} {{findings}} from an empirical analysis of the opinions <b>of</b> <b>Heads</b> <b>of</b> <b>Information</b> <b>Technology</b> (IT) in Local Authorities relating to e-government initiatives in Wales in the UK. A highly qualitative questionnaire sought to understand the current strategic and operational implications for the e-government agenda proposed by the National Assembly for Wales. The findings identify a number of critical imperatives, which are of concern to the <b>Heads</b> <b>of</b> IT. These require consideration when planning egovernment implementation and are presented {{in the form of}} a framework, which consists of e-government objectives, priorities and barriers. The chapter also highlights the need for a fundamental shift in management thinking and practice. Drawing upon the empirical analysis and the framework, the chapter elicits areas for future research. The research is related to academic and executive alliances in the e-government arena. The issues raised in the chapter are believed to be of potential value to public sector authorities and elsewhere, which may help facilitate successful e-government implementations. ...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Background Due to the {{strained}} {{financial situation}} in the healthcare sector, hospitals and other healthcare providers are facing an increasing pressure to improve their efficiency and to reduce costs. These trends challenge health care organizations to introduce innovative information technology (IT) based supportive processes. To guarantee that IT supports the clinical processes perfectly, IT must be managed proactively. However, until now, there is only very few research on IT service management especially on ITIL ® implementations {{in the health care}} context. Methods The current study aims at exploring knowledge about and acceptance of IT service management (especially ITIL ®) in hospitals in Austria and its neighboring regions Bavaria (Germany), Slovakia, South Tyrol (Italy) and Switzerland. Therefore highly standardized interviews with the respective <b>head</b> <b>of</b> <b>information</b> <b>technology</b> (CIO, IT manager) were conducted for selected hospitals from the different regions. In total 75 hospitals were interviewed. Data gathered was analyzed using descriptive statistics and where necessary methods of qualitative content analysis. Results In most regions, two-thirds or more of the participating IT managers claim to be familiar with the concepts of IT service management and of ITIL ®. IT managers expect from ITIL ® mostly better IT services, followed by an increased productivity and a reduction of IT cost. But only five hospitals said to have implemented at least parts of ITIL ®, and eight hospitals stated to be planning to do this in the next two years. When it comes to ITIL ®, Switzerland and Bavaria seem to be ahead of the other countries. There, the highest levels of knowledge, the highest number of implementations or plans of an implementation as well as the highest number of ITIL ® certified staff members were observed. Conclusion The results collected through this study indicate that the idea of IT services and IT service management is still not widely recognized in hospitals in the countries and regions of the study. It is also indicated that hospitals need further assistance {{in order to be able}} to successfully implement ITIL ®. Overall, research on IT service management and ITIL ® in health care is rare. </p...|$|E
