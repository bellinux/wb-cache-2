We are interested in how contexts can affect or contribute to language understanding and model the phenomena as a system of communicating processes to study the interaction between them in detail. For this purpose, {{we turn to the}} pie-calculus and investigate how communicating processes may be defined. While investigating the computational grounds of communication and concurrency,we devise a graphical representation for processes to capture the structure of interaction between them. Then, we develop a logic, combinatory intuitionistic linear logic with equality relation, to specify communicating processes logically. The development enables us to study Situation Semantics with process algebra. We construct semantic objects employed in Situation Semantics in the pi-calculus and then represent them in the logic. Through the construction,we also relate Situation Semantics with the research on the <b>information</b> <b>flow,</b> <b>Channel</b> Theory, by conceiving of linear logic as a theory of the information flow. To show how sentences can be parsed as the result of interactions between processes, we present a concurrent chart parser encoded in the pi-calculus.

40|$|Abstract—Protecting {{sensitive}} information from improper disclosure {{is a fundamental}} security goal. It is complicated, and difficult to achieve, often because of unavoidable or even unpredictable operating conditions {{that can lead to}} breaches in planned security defences. An attractive approach is to frame the goal as a quantitative problem, and then to design methods that measure system vulnerabilities in terms of the amount of information they leak. A consequence is that the precise operating conditions, and assumptions about prior knowledge, can {{play a crucial role in}} assessing the severity of any measured vunerability. We develop this theme by concentrating on vulnerability measures that are robust in the sense of allowing general leakage bounds to be placed on a program, bounds that apply whatever its operating conditions and whatever the prior knowledge might be. In particular we propose a theory of channel capacity, generalising the Shannon capacity of information theory, that can apply both to additive- and to multiplicative forms of a recently-proposed measure known as g-leakage. Further, we explore the computational aspects of calculating these (new) capacities: one of these scenarios can be solved efficiently by expressing it as a Kantorovich distance, but another turns out to be NP-complete. We also find capacity bounds for arbitrary correlations with data not directly accessed by the channel, as in the scenario of Dalenius’s Desideratum.

40|$|In {{information}} systems, {{a fundamental}} notion is representation. And yet, {{it would seem}} that in the literature of information systems, this notion has been treated intuitively at least informally, and in particular, how a possible representational relationship between two sets of objects may be systematically identified, formalized and reasoned about has not been fully addressed. Such a relationship should be formalizable because information flow channels underpin representational relationships between systems. A good understanding of such a relationship would help advance our knowledge regarding information systems. To this end, this thesis builds an information flow based representation framework whereby to capture, formalize, analyze and reason about representation for distributed systems. This is based on semantic information theories, which not only lay solid philosophical foundations, but also contribute to forming a mathematical foundation for the framework. Taking regularities as a fundamental principle, an <b>information</b> <b>flow</b> <b>channel</b> is constructed by taking both token and type levels into consideration. We introduce the notion of representation link, which connects separate contexts through type level constraints and token level connections. The framework enables an analysis of information flow within a distributed system both qualitatively and quantitatively. The channel hierarchy and link hierarchy take into account background information, which enhances inference on representation links. The framework allows agents to choose a channel that is the most appropriate for their purposes without violating the objectivity of information flow. Representation links also facilitate the identification of the information bearing capability of a system in terms of what and how information flows. This framework is then applied to the semantic integration of systems. A semantic integration model is thus built. With this model, the process of semantic integration is examined by using the mathematical mechanism of the framework. Important issues in semantic integration are investigated including how initial semantic correspondences affect integration results, how good and flexible an integration process is, and to what extent systems that are involved in integration may be changed and yet the result remains the same and thus reusable. The validity of the framework is also verified by analyzing results of integration from both content and quantity perspectives. This thesis shows that information flow based inference is applicable to analysing results of integration, and also channel and representation link hierarchy help us reason over different but relevant integrations. All these show the value of the proposed framework for information systems. EThOS - Electronic Theses Online ServiceGBUnited Kingdo...|$|E

This study was motivated by the general trend of commodity price volatility over the past close to a decade. The study therefore set out to review factors that influence commodity prices with a focus on fish price determinants in Kisumu County. The specific objectives of the study were; to determine the main factors that influence fish prices in Kisumu County, to establish {{the manner in which the}} factors influence fish prices in Kisumu County and to examine the influence of price on the marketability of fish in Kisumu County. The study adopted a descriptive study research design. The study will employ purposive and stratified random sampling targeting fishermen, wholesalers, retailers, middlemen and retailers with a sample size of 350 respondents. Data was collected vide a 5 point Likert type scale questionnaire. The study established that commodity prices are influenced by internal factors (Cost of fish harvesting/production, Marketing costs, Margins/profit appetite, ROI, Market share objective, Cost structure, storage, processing) and external factors (Market structure, speculation, middlemen, <b>information</b> <b>flow,</b> <b>channel</b> costs). The results indicate that speculation, middlemen and general economic performance are leading fish price drivers in Kisumu County. The internal and external factors identified through literature review that influence fish prices have a significant influence on fish pricing in Kisumu County. A 0. 755 variation in the internal and external factors affecting fish prices results in a unit change in fish prices. There is a significant relationship storage costs and fish prices in Kisumu County. A 0. 356 variation in storage costs results in a unit change in fish prices. A 0. 168 variation in fish packaging costs results in a unit change in fish prices while a 0. 428 variation in fish distribution channel costs results in a unit change in fish prices. Based on the results of the study we concluded that a combination of internal and external factors are responsible for the determination of fish prices in Kisumu County, however, market (external) factors play a greater role than internal factors. Policy recommendations include; development of policies to encourage fish value addition (processing), development of policies for infrastructural development and protection of marine ecosystems. Practice recommendations included the establishment of cooperatives and other partnerships that will enhance access to finance, technology, information and markets in a bid to reduce the influence of middlemen and ensure competitive pricing of value added fish products.

The state and observation noises {{do not need to}} be Gaussian. It is shown that the optimal filter of degree one (best affine filter) does not solve the parameter estimation problem, due to a structural first-order unobservability property, and therefore the use of higher order filters becomes necessary. As an application of the proposed filter, the problem of the on-line simultaneous estimation of the transmitted signal and of the impulse response samples of a multipath fast-fading digital communication channel, is considered in this paper. Differently from other approaches, the polynomial filter solves the problem without the use of training sequences (preambles) in the transmitted data, so that the <b>information</b> <b>flow</b> through the <b>channel</b> is not interrupted...|$|R
40|$|Abstract—High-assurance systems, such as {{flight control}} and banking systems require strict {{guarantees}} on <b>information</b> <b>flows</b> or else face catastrophic consequences. <b>Information</b> <b>flow</b> tracking (IFT) is a frequently used security measure for preventing unintended <b>information</b> <b>flows</b> in such systems. Recently, Gate Level <b>Information</b> <b>Flow</b> Tracking (GLIFT) {{has been proposed}} to track <b>information</b> <b>flows</b> at the hardware level. GLIFT enables a concrete understanding of all <b>information</b> <b>flows</b> from Boolean gates. It unifies the notions of explicit <b>flows,</b> covert <b>channels,</b> and even timing channels at the gate level and provides a general approach for enhancing important security properties such as integrity and confidentiality. This article presents a new encoding scheme for GLIFT with fewer encoding states by combining two states into one. Unlike the previous method, this reduction in encoding states allows the GLIFT tracking logic to operate independently from the original circuit. This independence allows for the GLIFT logic to be configured as both redundancy and tracking logic for the original circuit. Further, experimental results show this new state assignment provides on average 25. 7 % reductions in area, 31. 4 % reductions in delay, and 48. 6 % decrease in simulation time for several IWLS benchmarks.

IRN (injection-rolling nozzle) {{is the key}} {{component}} of the new Polymer CIDR (Continue Injection Direct Rolling) process, and it has higher requirements than the metal roll-casting nozzle. In order to achieve uniform exit velocity, {{a new type of}} structure of the <b>flow</b> <b>channel</b> which is called IRN <b>flow</b> <b>channel</b> structure is designed by combining with the two traditional <b>flow</b> <b>channel</b> characteristics, i. e. the fishtail and coat-hanger <b>flow</b> <b>channel.</b> Then the simulation was used to calculate the fluid field in IRN <b>flow</b> <b>channel</b> and analyze 3 D flow phenomenon and characteristics. The simulation results show that it has a uniform exit velocity of the IRN <b>flow</b> <b>channel</b> with the value of about 0. 06 m/s...|$|R
