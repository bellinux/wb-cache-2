50|$|<b>Formation</b> <b>{{pressure}}</b> is {{the pressure}} exerted by the formation fluids, {{which are the}} liquids and gases contained in the geologic formations encountered while drilling for oil or gas. It can also {{be said to be}} the pressure contained within the pores of the formation or reservoir being drilled. <b>Formation</b> <b>pressure</b> {{is a result of the}} hydrostatic pressure of the formation fluids, above the depth of interest, together with pressure trapped in the formation. Under <b>formation</b> <b>pressure,</b> there are 3 levels:normally pressured formation,abnormal <b>formation</b> <b>pressure,</b> orsubnormal <b>formation</b> <b>pressure.</b>|$|E
50|$|Subnormal <b>formation</b> <b>{{pressure}}</b> is a <b>formation</b> <b>pressure</b> that is {{less than}} the normal pressure for the given depth. It is common in formations that had undergone production of original hydrocarbon or formation fluid in them.|$|E
50|$|Shut-in {{drill pipe}} {{pressure}} (SIDPP), which is recorded when a well is shut in on a kick, {{is a measure}} of the difference between the pressure at the bottom of the hole and the hydrostatic pressure (HSP) in the drillpipe. During a well shut-in, the pressure of the wellbore stabilizes, and the <b>formation</b> <b>pressure</b> equals the pressure at the bottom of the hole. The drillpipe at this time should be full of known-density fluid. Therefore, the <b>formation</b> <b>pressure</b> can be easily calculated using the SIDPP. This means that the SIDPP gives a direct of <b>formation</b> <b>pressure</b> during a kick.|$|E

30|$|The {{followed}} section experienced high total gas {{readings and}} a small gas kick. Measured shut-in pressures within the Eocene Lithothamnium Limestone yielded <b>formation</b> <b>pressures</b> of 51.02  MPa or 1.26  g/cm 3 in equivalent mud weight. As a result, the drilling mud weight was increased from 1.24 to 1.31  g/cm 3, which stopped the gas influx.|$|R
5000|$|As {{discussed}} above, {{once the}} fluids are trapped within {{the formation and}} not allow to escape there is a pressure build-up leading to abnormally high <b>formation</b> <b>pressures.</b> This will generally require a mud weight of greater than 9.0 ppg to control. Excess pressure, called [...] "overpressure" [...] or [...] "geopressure", can cause a well to blow out or become uncontrollable during drilling.|$|R

50|$|In well control,it {{is defined}} as the {{difference}} between the <b>formation</b> <b>pressure</b> and the bottomhole hydrostatic pressure. These are classified as overbalanced, underbalanced and balanced.|$|E
50|$|In the {{planning}} stages of a well, a drilling engineer, usually with input from geologists and others, will pick strategic depths at which the hole {{will need to be}} cased in order for drilling to reach the desired total depth. This decision is often based on subsurface data such as <b>formation</b> <b>pressures,</b> strengths, and makeup, and is balanced against the cost objectives and desired drilling strategy.|$|R
30|$|Equation (10) {{indicates}} that a higher mud temperature can increase the <b>formation</b> breakdown <b>pressure,</b> namely increase the fracture gradient.|$|R
5000|$|Hydrostatic {{pressure}} also {{controls the}} stresses caused by tectonic forces, these may make wellbores unstable even when <b>formation</b> fluid <b>pressure</b> is balanced.|$|R
50|$|The shut-in casing {{pressure}} (SICP) {{is a measure}} of the difference between the <b>formation</b> <b>pressure</b> and the HSP in the annulus when a kick occurs.|$|E
50|$|Another {{cause of}} kicks is {{drilling}} accidentally into abnormally-pressured permeable zones. The increased <b>formation</b> <b>pressure</b> may {{be greater than}} the bottom hole pressure, resulting in a kick.|$|E
50|$|LWD {{tools are}} able to measure a suite of {{geological}} characteristics including density, porosity, resistivity, acoustic-caliper, inclination at the drill bit (NBI), magnetic resonance and <b>formation</b> <b>pressure.</b>|$|E
50|$|The {{types of}} shocked quartz found in surface {{samples from the}} rim of the Bloody Creek {{structure}} indicate anomalously high <b>formation</b> <b>pressures.</b> Based on shock recovery experiments, the threshold pressure for the types of shocked quartz found in these samples is estimated to be 16 GPa, with a mean pressure of 23 GPa. These pressure estimates greatly exceed the estimated <b>pressures</b> for the <b>formation</b> of shocked quartz found in the rims of similar size and types of craters. They are only comparable in magnitude with pressures estimated for in situ target rocks at the base of such impact craters. Based upon the simple, 2.9 km in diameter Brent crater in Ontario, Canada, as a model, to have the types of shocked quartz exposed at the surface at {{the rim of the}} Bloody Creek structure would theoretically require removal of at least the upper half of the original final crater. That an oblique impact, as an elliptical structure would indicate, would lessen, not increase, the pressures to which rim strata would be subjected makes the estimated <b>formation</b> <b>pressures</b> for the shocked quartz found in the rim of the Bloody Creek structure even more anomalously high.|$|R

30|$|We assumed {{hydrostatic}} pressure within the sediment columns above the BSRs; {{the differences in}} the results that arise from <b>formation</b> <b>pressures</b> between hydrostatic and lithostatic conditions were discussed in the following section. Using a phase diagram for methane hydrate (Tishchenko et al. 2005), the estimated pressure indicated the temperature at the BSR depth. Although other gases such as CO 2 and H 2 S affect the phase boundary of methane hydrate (Claypool and Kaplan 1974), core samples revealed that methane hydrate in the Nankai subduction zone consists of almost pure methane (~[*] 99 %) (Tobin et al. 2015).|$|R

50|$|Seal {{rocks in}} the Barnett-Paleozoic TPS are mostly shale units and dense, low {{permeability}} carbonate rock that are distributed on both regional and local scales. Barnett Shale is a major regional seal for older reservoirs, mostly porous carbonate rock reservoirs of the Ellenburger Group. Production from Barnett Shale is largely dependent on {{the presence or absence}} of Marble Falls and Viola limestones. Although these formations are not considered seal rocks in areas where they are tight and not water wet, they serve as barriers confining hydraulic-induced fracturing (frac barriers) and help retain <b>formation</b> <b>pressures</b> during well stimulation.|$|R
30|$|The {{shale gas}} {{production}} mechanism after fracturing is as follows. First, free {{gas in the}} formation fracture networks is transported to the wellbore driven by the pressure difference between the borehole and <b>formation</b> <b>pressures.</b> Then free gas in the pore network flows to the fracture network due to the gas concentration difference between the pore network and fracture network, resulting in reduction of pore pressure. Finally, gas adsorbed {{on the surface of}} organic matter will desorb to pore spaces to increase the pore pressure. Overall, natural gas moves from the pore network to the fracture network and finally flows to the wellbore to be collected (Zou et al. 2014).|$|R

50|$|In case of {{drilling}} a wildcat or exploratory well(often the formation pressures {{are not known}} accurately) the bit suddenly penetrates into an abnormal pressure formation resulting the hydrostatic pressure of mud become less than the <b>formation</b> <b>pressure</b> and cause a kick.|$|E
50|$|<b>Formation</b> <b>{{pressure}}</b> is {{the pressure}} of the fluid within the pore spaces of the formation rock. This pressure can be affected by the weight of the overburden (rock layers) above the formation, which exerts pressure on both the grains and pore fluids. Grains are solid or rock material, and pores are spaces between grains. If porefluids are free to move, or escape, the grains lose some of their support and move closer together. This process is called consolidation.Depending on the magnitude of the pore pressure, it can be described as being normal, abnormal or subnormal.Normal pore pressure or <b>formation</b> <b>pressure</b> is equal to the hydrostatic pressure of formation fluid extending from the surface to the surface formation being considered. In other words, if the formation was opened up and allowed to fill a column whose length is equal to the depth of the formation, then the pressure {{at the bottom of the}} column will be equal to the <b>formation</b> <b>pressure</b> and the pressure at surface is equal to zero.Normal pore pressure is not a constant. Its magnitude varies with the concentration of dissolved salts, type of fluid, gases present and temperature gradient.|$|E
50|$|A sudden {{increase}} in penetration rate (drilling break) is usually {{caused by a}} change in the type of formation being drilled. However, it may also signal an {{increase in}} <b>formation</b> pore <b>pressure,</b> which may indicate a possible kick.|$|R

30|$|There {{are many}} {{factors that are}} to be weighed when {{choosing}} a DF. However, the key considerations are well design, anticipated <b>formation</b> <b>pressures</b> and rock mechanics, formation chemistry, the degree of damage the DF imparts to the formation, temperature, environmental effects and regulations, logistics, and economics. To meet these key design factors, DFs offer a complex array of interrelated properties. Five basic properties are usually defined by the well program and monitored during drilling. These properties are listed as viscosity, density, filter cake or filtration of water loss, solids content, and quality of water make up. Once the properties and their parameters are determined, the DF can be controlled and adjusted accordingly.|$|R
