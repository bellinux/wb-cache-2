25|$|In 1969, Wilson's Labour Government {{introduced}} In Place of Strife, a {{white paper}} designed to circumvent strikes by imposing compulsory arbitration. Opposed by many trade unionists, including Home Secretary James Callaghan; it was soon withdrawn. Later legislation passed by Edward Heath's Conservative government was successfully resisted as union militants, many close to the CPGB, led the successful 1974 UK miners' strike. More ominously for the left, the unsuccessful Grunwick dispute, and the 1978-79 Winter of Discontent were also blamed on them. The Labour leadership's <b>failure</b> <b>to</b> <b>work</b> with trade unions, or for their opponents an inability to keep them under control, resulted in the election in 1979 of an economically liberal Conservative government, led by Margaret Thatcher, which finally ended the post-war political consensus.|$|E

500|$|Typical pay in the 1840s and 1850s {{would be}} 4d {{per day for}} younger girls, rising to 8d–1s per day for full-grown women engaged in skilled bucking work. (Wages varied by region owing to differing levels {{of supply and demand}} for workers; in Kea and Wendron the average wage for women and girls was as high as 18s in 1841.) As they were {{employed}} as casual labour, bal maidens were not tied to any particular mine, and it was not unusual for them to transfer to other mines offering better pay or conditions. Some mines may have paid a monthly loyalty bonus in an effort to retain their workers. The workers could be fined for bad language, <b>failure</b> <b>to</b> <b>work</b> hard enough, absenteeism and other misdemeanours. As their pay was dependent on the profitability of the mine, it was not unusual early in the 19th century for bal maidens to work for long periods (in at least one case, a laundry woman, 11 months) without pay, and to receive their pay in arrears once the mine returned to profit. While some younger bal maidens would attend school before starting work and, in 1841, around a quarter of bal maidens attended Sunday schools, illiteracy was rife. When [...] Charles Foster Barham's reported to the 1842 Royal Commission into the Employment of Children at the Mines he found that less than half of bal maidens he interviewed were able to read to any extent. Some mines subsidised basic education for the children of their employees. Mining families generally valued education so highly that they would often try to send at least one child to school, but any education children did receive tended to be curtailed once they became old enough to work in the mines.|$|E
2500|$|Civil War {{historian}} E. Merton Coulter {{noted that}} {{for those who}} would secure its independence, [...] "The Confederacy was unfortunate in its <b>failure</b> <b>to</b> <b>work</b> out a general strategy for the whole war". Aggressive strategy called for offensive force concentration. Defensive strategy sought dispersal to meet demands of locally minded governors. The controlling philosophy evolved into a combination [...] "dispersal with a defensive concentration around Richmond". The Davis administration considered the war purely defensive, a [...] "simple demand that the people of the United States would cease to war upon us". Historian James M. McPherson is a critic of Lee's Offensive Strategy: [...] "Lee pursued a faulty military strategy that ensured Confederate defeat".|$|E

Defining wealth in terms of knowledge, as the [...] "technological ability to protect, nurture, support, and accommodate all growth needs of life," [...] {{his analysis of the}} condition of [...] "Spaceship Earth" [...] caused him to conclude that at a certain time during the 1970s, humanity had attained an unprecedented state. He was convinced that the accumulation of relevant knowledge, combined with the quantities of major recyclable resources that had already been extracted from the earth, had attained a critical level, such that competition for necessities had become unnecessary. Cooperation had become the optimum survival strategy. He declared: [...] "selfishness is unnecessary and hence-forth unrationalizable.... War is obsolete." [...] He criticized previous utopian schemes as too exclusive, and thought this was a major source of their <b>failure.</b> <b>To</b> <b>work,</b> he thought that a utopia needed to include everyone.|$|E

60|$|I {{remember}} concerning {{it a very}} becoming despair when, at {{a certain}} moment in it, I began to wonder what I was driving at. I have always had such moments in my work, and if I cannot fitly boast of them, I can at least own to them in freedom from the pride that goes before a fall. My only resource at such times was to keep working; keep beating harder and harder at the wall which seemed to close me in, till at last I broke through into the daylight beyond. In this case, I had really such a very good grip of my characters that I need {{not have had the}} usual fear of their <b>failure</b> <b>to</b> <b>work</b> out their destiny. But even when the thing was done and I carried the completed manuscript to my dear old friend, the late Henry Loomis Nelson, then editor of the Weekly, it was in more fear of his judgment than I cared to show. As often happened with my manuscript in such exigencies, it seemed to go all to a handful of shrivelled leaves. When we met again and he accepted it for the Weekly, with a handclasp of hearty welcome, I could scarcely gasp out my unfeigned relief. We had talked the scheme of it over together; he had liked the notion, and he easily made me believe, after my first dismay, that he liked the result even better.|$|E

40|$|Ability <b>to</b> return <b>to</b> <b>work</b> after stroke {{has been}} proven to have {{positive}} psychosocial benefits on survivors and caregivers. Even though one-fifth of aSAH survivors suffer from poor psychosocial outcomes, the relationship between such outcomes and ability <b>to</b> <b>work</b> post-stroke is limited in the literature. This project seeks to define the relationship between age, gender, race, marital status, household income, anxiety and depression and ability <b>to</b> return <b>to</b> <b>work</b> 3 and 12 months post aSAH. 121 subjects were included in this retrospective analysis. Anxiety was scored via the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI) while depression was measured using Becks Depression Inventory-II (BDI-II). Both variables were assessed at 3 and 12 months post-aSAH. Ability <b>to</b> return <b>to</b> <b>work</b> was dichotomized into ability to return or not and was measured {{at the same time}} points. The categorical variables - gender, race, and household income - were analyzed using chi-squares or Fisher’s exact test, while continuous variables including age, BDI, State & Trait anxiety scores were analyzed using independent t-tests. Age was significantly associated with <b>failure</b> <b>to</b> return <b>to</b> <b>work</b> 3 and 12 months post-aSAH in both adjusted and unadjusted analysis. High scores of depression, State anxiety, and Trait anxiety 3 and 12 months post-aSAH all had significant or trending associations with <b>failure</b> <b>to</b> return <b>to</b> <b>work</b> 12 months post-aSAH in both adjusted and unadjusted analysis. Female gender had a trending association with <b>failure</b> <b>to</b> return <b>to</b> <b>work</b> 12 months post-stroke. The interactive variables of older age and high State anxiety, older age and high Trait anxiety, and older age and high rates of depression 3 and 12 months post-aSAH also were significantly associated with <b>failure</b> <b>to</b> return <b>to</b> <b>work</b> 12 months post-aSAH. Patients who are older, female, and suffer from poor psychological outcomes such as depression or anxiety are at an increased risk of failing <b>to</b> return <b>to</b> <b>work</b> 1 -year post-aSAH. The interactive results of this study give us information about which patients are at risk for poor outcomes and therefore can be streamlined for therapy that targets such psychosocial needs...|$|R
