As little as 10 ttM <b>flurofamide</b> (2 Ag/ml) prevented any growth, but U. urealyticum survived for about eight hours before colony counts become undetectable. <b>Flurofamide</b> was a specific inhibitor of U. urealyticum since it did not inhibit growth of four Mycoplasma species or Acholeplasma hippikon. <b>Flurofamide</b> was 1, 000 times more active than acetohydroxamic acid and thus has promise as a chemotherapeutic agent and a biochemical tool. Urease is perhaps the most interesting protein currently, among the multitudinous proteins occurring in the organisms of the Mycoplasmatales. The enzyme and its substrate urea appear critical to Ureaplasma urealyticum because both the growth rate and the growth yield of the organisms in culture are functions of the urea concentration in the medium. The maximum growth rate is achieved at about 3 mM urea and the yield {{is directly related to the}} urea concentration up to 32 mM, provided that adequate buffering capacity is maintained [1].

40|$|Helicobacter pylori {{exhibits}} chemotactic {{responses to}} urea, <b>flurofamide,</b> acetohydroxamic acid, and sodium bicarbonate. In buffer, the chemotactic activities of a urease-positive strain {{were higher than}} those of the isogenic urease-negative strain. Moreover, the chemotactic activities of the urease-positive strain were increased in a viscous solution containing 3 % polyvinylpyrrolidone, whereas those of the urease-negative mutant were not. These results are in accordance {{with the fact that the}} mutant strain did not show swarming in motility agar regardless of having flagella. Incubation of the wild-type strain with <b>flurofamide</b> resulted in partial inhibition of the chemotactic activities in the viscous solution. In addition, incubation with acetohydroxamic acid, a low-molecular-weight, diffusible urease inhibitor, resulted in complete loss of chemotactic activity in the viscous solution. The inhibition of the chemotactic activity by urease inhibitors paralleled the inhibition of urease. The chemotactic activity of H. pylori was also inhibited by the proton carrier carbonyl cyanide m-chlorophenylhydrazone, showing that H. pylori utilizes proton motive force for motility. These results indicate that cytoplasmic urease plays an important role in the chemotactic motility of H. pylori under a condition that mimics the ecological niche of the bacterium, the gastric mucous layer...|$|E

40|$|Infectious {{meningitis}} and encephalitis {{is caused}} by invasion of circulating pathogens into the brain. It is unknown how the circulating pathogens dynamically interact with brain endothelium under shear stress, leading to invasion into the brain. Here, using intravital microscopy, we have shown that Cryptococcus neoformans, a yeast pathogen that causes meningoencephalitis, stops suddenly in mouse brain capillaries of a similar or smaller diameter than the organism, {{in the same manner}} and with the same kinetics as polystyrene microspheres, without rolling and tethering to the endothelial surface. Trapping of the yeast pathogen in the mouse brain was not affected by viability or known virulence factors. After stopping in the brain, C. neoformans was seen to cross the capillary wall in real time. In contrast to trapping, viability, but not replication, was essential for the organism to cross the brain microvasculature. Using a knockout strain of C. neoformans, we demonstrated that transmigration into the mouse brain is urease dependent. To determine whether this could be amenable to therapy, we used the urease inhibitor <b>flurofamide.</b> <b>Flurofamide</b> ameliorated infection of the mouse brain by reducing transmigration into the brain. Together, these results suggest that C. neoformans is mechanically trapped in the brain capillary, which may not be amenable to pharmacotherapy, but actively transmigrates to the brain parenchyma with contributions from urease, suggesting that a therapeutic strategy aimed at inhibiting this enzyme could help prevent meningitis and encephalit{{is caused by}} C. neoformans infection...|$|E
40|$|Sonication of Ureaplasma urealyticum cells {{grown in}} a dialysate growth medium {{effectively}} separated the cytoplasmic fraction from the membrane fraction, with both fractions relatively free from exogenous contaminating proteins. The urease activity {{was associated with}} the cytoplasmic fraction, and the ureaplasmal urease exhibited a specific activity higher than that of crystalline jack bean urease. The enzymatic activity of the ureaplasmal enzyme was optimum at pH 7. 5 and was resistant to the chelating agents EDTA and sodium citrate. Sulfhydryl-blocking agents such as HgCl 2 and Pb(NO 3) 2 inhibited the ureaplasmal urease, which was also shown to be particularly sensitive to <b>flurofamide</b> and, to a much lesser extent, to acetohydroxamic acid. Electrophoretic analysis of the proteins of the ureaplasmal cell fractions combined with Western immunoblot with an antiserum to the ureaplasmal urease indicated that the urease constitutes a major component of the cytoplasm and is composed of several 70 -kilodalton polypeptides...|$|E
40|$|When urea {{is added}} to Ureaplasma urealyticum, it is {{hydrolysed}} internally by a cytosolic urease. Under our measuring conditions, and at an external pH of 6. 0, urea hydrolysis caused an ammonia chemical potential equivalent to almost 80 mV and, simultaneously, an increase in proton electrochemical potential (delta p) of about 24 mV with resultant de novo ATP synthesis. Inhibition of the urease with the potent inhibitor <b>flurofamide</b> abolished both the chemical potential and the increase of delta p such that ATP synthesis was reduced to approximately 5 % of normally obtained levels. Uncouplers of electrochemical gradients {{had little or no}} effect on these systems. The electrochemical parameters and ATP synthesis were measured similarly at three other external pH values. Any change in delta p was primarily via membrane potential (delta psi), and the level of de novo ATP synthesis was related to the increase in delta p generated upon addition of urea and more closely to the ammonia chemical potential. Although the organisms lack an effective mechanism for internal pH homeostasis, they maintained a constant delta pH. The data reported are consistent with, and give evidence for, the direct involvement of a chemiosmotic mechanism in the generation of around 95 % of the ATP by this organism. Furthermore, the data suggest that the ATP-generating system is coupled to urea hydrolysis by the cytosolic urease via an ammonia chemical potential...|$|E
40|$|Proteus mirabilis, {{a common}} agent of nosocomially {{acquired}} and catheter-associated urinary tract infection, {{is the most}} frequent cause of infection-induced bladder and kidney stones. Urease-catalyzed urea hydrolysis initiates stone formation in urine and can be inhibited by acetohydroxamic acid and other structural analogs of urea. Since P. mirabilis urease is inducible with urea, {{there has been some}} concern that urease inhibitors actually induce urease during an active infection, thus compounding the problem of elevated enzyme activity. Quantitating induction by compounds that simultaneously inhibit urease activity has been difficult. Therefore, to study these problems, we constructed a fusion of ureA (a urease subunit gene) and lacZ (the beta-galactosidase gene) within plasmid pMID 1010, which encodes an inducible urease of P. mirabilis expressed in E. coli JM 103 (Lac-). The fusion protein, predicted to be 117 kDa, was induced by urea and detected on Western blots (immunoblots) with anti-beta-galactosidase antiserum. Peak beta-galactosidase activity of 9. 9 mumol of ONPG (o-nitrophenyl-beta-D-galactopyranoside) hydrolyzed per min per mg of protein, quantitated spectrophotometrically, was induced at 200 mM urea. The uninduced rate was 0. 2 mumol of ONPG hydrolyzed per min per mg of protein. Induction was specific for urea, as no structural analog of urea (including acetohydroxamic acid, hydroxyurea, thiourea, hippuric acid, <b>flurofamide,</b> or hydroxylamine) induced fusion protein activity. These data suggest that induction by inactivation of UreR, the urease repressor protein that governs regulation of the urease operon, is specific for urea and does not respond to closely related structural analogs...|$|E
40|$|Helicobacter pylori is a gram-negative {{bacterium}} which causes chronic gastritis and {{is associated with}} peptic ulcer disease, gastric carcinoma, and gastric lymphoma. The bacterium is characterized by potent urease activity, thought to be located on the outer membrane, which is essential for survival at low pH. The {{purpose of the present}} study was to investigate mechanisms whereby urease and HspB, a GroEL homolog, become surface associated in vitro. Urease, HspB, and catalase were located almost exclusively within the cytoplasm in fresh log-phase cultures assessed by cryo- immunoelectron microscopy. In contrast, significant amounts of surface-associated antigen were observed in older or subcultured preparations concomitantly with the appearance of significant amounts of extracellular antigen, amorphous debris, and membrane fragments. By use of a variety of biochemical methods, a significant fraction of urease and HspB was associated with the outer membrane in subcultured preparations of H. pylori. Taken together, these results strongly suggest that H. pylori cells undergo spontaneous autolysis during culture and that urease and HspB become surface associated only concomitant with bacterial autolysis. By comparing enzyme sensitivity to <b>flurofamide</b> (a potent, poorly diffusible urease inhibitor) in whole cells with that in deliberately lysed cells, we show that both extracellular and intracellular urease molecules are active enzymatically. Autolysis of H. pylori is an important phenomenon to recognize since it likely exerts significant effects on the behavior of H. pylori. Furthermore, the surface properties of H. pylori must be unique in promoting adsorption of cytoplasmic proteins...|$|E
40|$|A 14 C-urea {{breath test}} {{analogous}} to its clinical counterpart is described {{for use in}} ferrets naturally or experimentally infected with Helicobacter mustelae. The test is performed within a sealed glass metabolism chamber through which air is drawn at a constant rate and expired breath collected into sodium hydroxide. Peak 14 CO 2 production occurred approximately 1 hour after substrate administration. Both inter- and intra-animal responses were highly reproducible, with mean coefficients of variation less than 10 %. Other than enhancing peak 14 CO 2 levels very slightly, fasting had little influence on the response. In infant animals challenged with H mustelae, breath test activity increased linearly with the total count of culturable bacteria isolated from the antrum. Treatment of established infections with colloidal bismuth subcitrate (DeNol) for 4 weeks resulted in clearance of all detectable bacteria but retention of some breath test activity. Subsequent regrowth of bacteria was parallelled {{by an increase in}} the breath test response. Inclusion of amoxycillin and metronidazole in the treatment regimen, however, eradicated all the bacteria and almost totally eliminated 14 CO 2 production. This response parallels the clinically observed suppressive effect on H pylori achieved with bismuth alone relative to the total eradication seen with triple therapy. A single oral dose of the urease inhibitor, <b>flurofamide,</b> inhibited over 90 % of the response for at least 24 hours. Acetohydroxamic acid was less effective. These findings suggest that in the ferret H mustelae model, breath test analysis can be a useful, non-invasive alternative to endoscopy for evaluation of agents affecting either growth of the organism or urease activity...|$|E
40|$|Campylobacter pylori, a {{suspected}} agent of gastritis and peptic ulceration, rapidly hydrolyzes urea. Because urease {{serves as the}} basis of detection of the organism in gastric biopsies and may represent an important virulence factor, biochemical characteristics of the enzyme were determined. C. pylori was isolated from antral biopsies from 10 patients with complaints of abdominal pain or history of peptic ulcer disease. All isolates were urease positive, with an average rate of hydrolysis by cell lysates being 36 +/- 28 mumol of NH 3 per min per mg of protein, more than twice that of Proteus mirabilis and 10 times that of other urinary tract isolates. The enzyme had an apparent molecular weight of 625, 000 +/- 15, 000 by column chromatography, an isoelectric point of 5. 9, a Km of 0. 8 +/- 0. 1 mM urea, an optimal temperature of 45 degrees C, and an optimal pH of 8. 2. Ten isolates tested produced ureases with identical electrophoretic mobilities on nondenaturing 5 % polyacrylamide activity gels. Acetohydroxamic acid (100 micrograms/ml), hydroxyurea (85 micrograms/ml), <b>flurofamide</b> (0. 05 micrograms/ml), and EDTA (8 mM) inhibited enzyme activity by 50 %. Cell lysates retained 50 % of initial urease activity after 6 days and 40 % activity after 18 days when stored at 4 degrees C in 20 mM sodium phosphate, pH 6. 8. At - 70 degrees C for 18 days, 1 mM EDTA or 15 % glycerol preserved 40 or 34 %, respectively, of initial activity. The urease of C. pylori appears to be biochemically unique from the enzymes of other common urease-producing species...|$|E
40|$|Helicobacter pylori {{can produce}} a {{persistent}} infection in the human stomach, where chronic and active inflammation, including the infiltration of phagocytes such as neutrophils and monocytes, is induced. H. pylori may have a defense system against the antimicrobial actions of phagocytes. We studied the defense mechanism of H. pylori against host-derived peroxynitrite (ONOO−), a bactericidal metabolite of nitric oxide, focusing {{on the role of}} H. pylori urease, which produces CO 2 and NH 3 from urea and is known to be an essential factor for colonization. The viability of H. pylori decreased in a time-dependent manner with continuous exposure to 1 μM ONOO−, i. e., 0. 2 % of the initial bacteria remained after a 5 -min treatment without urea. The bactericidal action of ONOO− against H. pylori was significantly attenuated by the addition of 10 mM urea, the substrate for urease, whereas ONOO−-induced killing of a urease-deficient mutant of H. pylori or Campylobacter jejuni, another microaerophilic bacterium lacking urease, was not affected by the addition of urea. Such a protective effect of urea was potentiated by supplementation with exogenous urease, and it was almost completely nullified by 10 μM <b>flurofamide,</b> a specific inhibitor of urease. The bactericidal action of ONOO− was also suppressed by the addition of 20 mM NaHCO 3 but not by the addition of 20 mM NH 3. In addition, the nitration of l-tyrosine of H. pylori after treatment with ONOO− was significantly reduced by the addition of urea or NaHCO 3, as assessed by high-performance liquid chromatography with electrochemical detection. These results suggest that H. pylori-associated urease functions to produce a potent ONOO− scavenger, CO 2 /HCO 3 −, that defends the bacteria from ONOO− cytotoxicity. The protective effect of urease may thus facilitate sustained bacterial colonization in the infected gastric mucosa...|$|E
40|$|Ureaplasmas killed mice within 5 min after {{intravenous}} injection. The 50 % {{lethal dose}} of whole ureaplasmal organisms was 32,ug per mouse, a value also found for crystalline jackbean urease. The reaction was specific to urease, since protection was afforded by intraperitoneal injection of 200,ug of <b>flurofamide,</b> a potent urease inhibitor. The finding {{that a similar}} lethal effect was produced by injection of 200,umol of NH 4 + indicates that the toxicity of urease is mediated by ammonium ions or free ammonia. Ureaplasma urealyticum not only hydrolyzes urea but also requires urea for growth (8). The hydrolysis of urea by ureaplasmal urease appears {{to serve as a}} primary source of energy (15). The urease activity of ureaplasmas is high, since the specific activities of whole organism preparations were up to three times as great as those for crystalline jackbean urease (2). Jackbean urease, the first enzyme to be crystal-lized (in 1931), has long been known to be toxic for labora-tory animals (16), and ureaplasmal urease has been impli-cated in the pathogenesis of ureaplasmas (3, 9, 13). That ureaplasmas have been recovered from the renal pelvis and upper urinary tracts of patients during surgery (5, 13) sug-gests that ureaplasmal urease could have a role in the formation of "infection " kidney stones, as do bacterial ureases. When we sought to immunize mice with whole ureaplas-mas for the production of monoclonal antibodies, we found that whole ureaplasmas killed mice rapidly. We determined that this killing effect was specific to the ureaplasmal urease and not to some other component of the ureaplasmal cell.

40|$|Urease {{activity}} {{has recently been}} shown to be an important virulence determinant for Helicobacter pylori, allowing it to survive the low pH of the stomach during colonization. Experimental murine infection with Helicobacter felis is now being used as a model for H. pylori infection to study the effects of vaccines, antibiotics, and urease inhibitors on colonization. However, little information comparing the ureases of H. felis and H. pylori is available. Urease was partially purified from the cell surface of H. felis ATCC 49179 by A- 5 M agarose chromatography, resulting in an eightfold increase in specific activity over that of crude urease. The apparent Km for urea for the partially purified urease was 0. 4 mM, and the enzyme was inhibited in a competitive manner by <b>flurofamide</b> (50 % inhibitory concentration = 0. 12 microM). Antiserum to whole cells of H. pylori recognized both H. pylori and H. felis urease B subunits. Antiserum raised against H. felis whole cells recognized the large and small autologous urease subunits and the cpn 60 heat shock molecule in both H. felis and H. pylori. However, this antiserum showed only a weak reaction with the B subunit of H. pylori urease. Two oligomeric DNA sequences were used as probes to evaluate the relatedness of H. felis and H. pylori urease gene sequences. One 30 -mer from the ureA sequence, which had been shown previously to be specific for H. pylori, failed to hybridize to H. felis genomic DNA. A probe to the putative coding sequence for the active site of the H. pylori ureB subunit hybridized at low intensity to a 2. 8 -kb fragment of BamHI-HindIII-digested H. felis DNA, suggesting that the sequences were homologous but not identical, a result confirmed from the recently published sequences of ureA and ureB from H. felis...|$|E
40|$|Helicobacter pylori, an {{important}} etiologic agent {{in a variety}} of gastroduodenal diseases, produces large amounts of urease as an essential colonization factor. We have demonstrated previously that urease is located within the cytoplasm and on the surface of H. pylori both in vivo and in stationary-phase culture. The {{purpose of the present study}} was to assess the relative contributions of cytoplasmic and surface-localized urease to the ability of H. pylori to survive exposure to acid in the presence of urea. Toward this end, we compared the acid resistance in vitro of H. pylori cells which possessed only cytoplasmic urease to that of bacteria which possessed both cytoplasmic and surface-localized or extracellular urease. Bacteria with only cytoplasmic urease activity were generated by using freshly subcultured bacteria or by treating repeatedly subcultured H. pylori with <b>flurofamide</b> (1 μM), a potent, but poorly diffusible urease inhibitor. H. pylori with cytoplasmic and surface-located urease activity survived in an acid environment when 5 mM urea was present. In contrast, H. pylori with only cytoplasmic urease shows significantly reduced survival when exposed to acid in the presence of 5 mM urea. Similarly, Escherichia coli SE 5000 expressing H. pylori urease and the Ni 2 + transport protein NixA, which expresses cytoplasmic urease activity at levels similar to those in wild-type H. pylori, survived minimally when exposed to acid in the presence of 5 to 50 mM urea. We conclude that cytoplasmic urease activity alone is not sufficient (although cytoplasmic urease activity is likely to be necessary) to allow survival of H. pylori in acid; the activity of surface-localized urease is essential for resistance of H. pylori to acid under the assay conditions used. Therefore, the mechanism whereby urease becomes associated with the surface of H. pylori, which involves release of the enzyme from bacteria due to autolysis followed by adsorption of the enzyme to the surface of intact bacteria (“altruistic autolysis”), is essential for survival of H. pylori in an acid environment. The ability of H. pylori to survive exposure to low pH is likely to depend on a combination of both cytoplasmic and surface-associated urease activities...|$|E
