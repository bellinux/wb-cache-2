50|$|Boucherot was {{interested}} in using polyphase supplies to power asynchronous motors as early as 1894. The squirrel-cage rotor asynchronous motor was invented by Mikhail Dolivo-Dobrovolsky in 1889 and they were being built industrially from 1891. A problem with asynchronous machines {{is that they are}} difficult to start. The coupling to the rotor is weak until it gets moving and the current drawn by the motor is high.

40|$|Posterior lumbar interbody fusion {{has been}} widely {{accepted}} {{as one of the}} surgical procedure to treat clinical problems. However, vertebral endplate subsidence failure has been detected as one of its major problems that might increase the potential of pain and mechanical instability. Therefore, posterior instrumentation (PI) has been introduced alongside with <b>double</b> fusion <b>cages</b> implant to limit segmental movement and to facilitate fusion. Nevertheless, the use of two interbody fusion cages will be likely to incur higher cost and more risky. Hence, single oblique cage insertion surgical procedure has been reported as one of the reliable solution. In the present study, an image-based finite element analysis was used to evaluate a subsidence phenomenon based on the fracture risks evaluation and the stress profiles at cage-endplate interface in two different cage insertion orientations namely as <b>double</b> <b>cages</b> and single oblique cage. Apparently, the single oblique inserted cage with PI has significantly produced lower stress than the <b>double</b> inserted <b>cages</b> at the cage-endplate interfaces. At higher impact loading (2000 N), the total number of compressive deformations of the <b>double</b> <b>cages</b> outnumbered the single oblique cage at the cage-endplate interface junctions and the deformations were more uniformly distributed. Obviously, there was a trade-off between the stress generation, the implant stability and the risk of vertebral bone failures.

40|$|<b>Double</b> <b>cage</b> {{induction}} motors {{are typically}} employed in applications that require high starting torque for frequent, loaded starts. This makes the starting (outer) cage susceptible to fatigue failure since it must withstand the large thermo-mechanical stress {{associated with the}} high starting current and long acceleration time. Conventional FFT-based spectrum analysis techniques are insensitive to outer cage faults due to the small outer cage current under steady state operation, and the fault indicators and thresholds applied to single cage rotors cannot be used.
