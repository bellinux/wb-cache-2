5|$|The red-backed fairywren mainly eats insects, and {{supplements}} its {{diet with}} seed and small fruit. The preferred habitat is heathland and savannah, particularly where low shrubs and tall grasses provide cover. It can be nomadic {{in areas where}} there are frequent bushfires, although pairs or small groups of birds maintain and defend territories year-round {{in other parts of}} its range. Groups consist of a socially monogamous pair with one or more helper birds who assist <b>in</b> <b>raising</b> the young. These helpers are progeny that have attained sexual maturity yet remain with the family group for one or more years after fledging. The red-backed fairywren is sexually promiscuous, and each partner may mate with other individuals and even assist <b>in</b> <b>raising</b> the young from such pairings. Older males in breeding plumage are {{more likely to engage in}} this behaviour than are those breeding in eclipse plumage. As part of a courtship display, the male wren plucks red petals from flowers and displays them to females.|$|E
5|$|The white-winged fairywren mainly eats insects, supplementing {{this with}} small fruits and leaf buds. It occurs in {{heathland}} and arid scrubland, where low shrubs provide cover. Like other fairywrens, it is a cooperative breeding species, and {{small groups of}} birds maintain and defend territories year-round. Groups consist of a socially monogamous pair with several helper birds who assist <b>in</b> <b>raising</b> the young. These helpers are progeny that have attained sexual maturity but remain with the family group for one or more years after fledging. Although not yet confirmed genetically, the white-winged fairywren may be promiscuous and assist <b>in</b> <b>raising</b> the young from other pairings. As part of a courtship display, the male wren plucks petals from flowers and displays them to female birds.|$|E

5|$|Because of {{the greater}} {{investment}} <b>in</b> <b>raising</b> the young and because foraging for food may occur far from the nest site, in all seabird species except the phalaropes, both parents participate in caring for the young, and pairs are typically at least seasonally monogamous. Many species, such as gulls, auks and penguins, retain the same mate for several seasons, and many petrel species mate for life. Albatrosses and procellariids, which mate for life, take many years to form a pair bond before they breed, and the albatrosses have an elaborate breeding dance {{that is part of}} pair-bond formation.|$|E
5|$|Birds {{currently}} {{receive the}} greatest attention {{in regards to}} conservation. Arguably the most successful fauna recovery plan in Puerto Rico was the Puerto Rican Parrot Recovery Plan. Initiated in 1968, its main objective was to downlist the Puerto Rican parrot's status from critical to threatened by 2020. Other objectives include the establishment of two separate, effective, wild populations (500 or more individuals for 5 years), the protection of habitat for those populations and the control of predators, parasites and competitors of the species. Currently, the total wild parrot population is estimated at 44 individuals, and 105 birds are in captivity. This program was fundamental <b>in</b> <b>raising</b> ecological awareness in Puerto Rico.|$|E
5|$|In {{light of}} the {{difficulties}} <b>in</b> <b>raising</b> capital for these expansions and despite MIT's privately endowed status, Walker {{and other members of}} the Corporation lobbied the Massachusetts legislature for a $200,000 grant to aid in the industrial development of the Commonwealth ($ in 2016 dollars). After intensive negotiations that called upon Walker's extensive connections and civic experience, in 1887 the legislature made a grant of $300,000 over two years to the Institute, which would lead to a total of $1.6 million in grants from the Commonwealth before the practice was discontinued in 1921.|$|E

5|$|Like other fairy-wrens, {{the superb}} fairy-wren is notable for several {{peculiar}} behavioural characteristics; {{the birds are}} socially monogamous and sexually promiscuous, meaning that although they form pairs between one male and one female, each partner will mate with other individuals and even assist <b>in</b> <b>raising</b> the young from such pairings.
