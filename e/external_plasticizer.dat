40|$|Thermoplastic {{sugar beet}} pulp (thermo-mechanical {{processing}} was discussed in previous studies) was formed into film strips by extrusion. Film tensile properties are discussed according to the molecular structure of <b>external</b> <b>plasticizer.</b> Sorbitol, fructose and adipic acid have a marked antiplasticizing effect, while urea and xylitol gave higher ultimate tensile stress than glycerol for a comparable strain at break. Xylitol {{can be considered as}} the best plasticizer with UTS and EL of, respectively, 4. 9 MPa and 11. 3 % and water absorption (85 %RH, 25 °C) was less than 25 %. Glycidyl methacrylate was directly used in the extrusion process as cross-linker. In high humidity atmosphere (97 %RH, 25 °C), film water absorption was then kept under 40 % while the tensile properties were improved of 50 % and with a 30 minute UV post-treatment the mass gain in absorption was even less than 30 % after 5 days...|$|E
40|$|We have {{analyzed}} {{the evolution of}} the photorefractive phase shift and the photoconductivity in three fully functionalized photorefractive polymethacrylates with increasing temperature and plasticizer concentration. Apart from a strong increase in refractive index modulation amplitude, the polymers show a larger phase shift and photoconductivity as the measurement temperature is raised. When the measurement temperature is kept at 21 degreesC, the photorefractive performance can be improved by reducing the glass transition temperature of the polymers by adding an <b>external</b> <b>plasticizer.</b> Two types of plasticizer were used. When doped with 10 or 20 wt% of an inert plasticizer (IP), diffraction efficiencies and gain coefficients are improved substantially. Due to a dilution of the charge transporting groups, however, the photoconductivities and the phase shifts start to decrease when more than 10 wt% of inert plasticizer is added. A detailed analysis of this behaviour is presented. When the carbazole-functionalized copolymers with carbazole as the only charge transporting group are doped with 20 wt% of N-ethylcarbazole, the concentration of the charge transport molecules is increased. Together with the lowering of T-g, this produces a larger phase shift. In all experiments, a good correlation between photoconductivity and photorefractive phase shift was observed. status: publishe...|$|E
40|$|Xylans {{are among}} the most {{abundant}} polymers on earth. Nature has created xylans with different molecular structures in different plant species. This molecular architecture is not a coincidence but is tailored to create a particular desirable functionality. If we were able to understand the effect of the molecular architecture on the material properties, we could create tailor-made xylan-based materials and utilise this immense natural resource in material applications now fulfilled by non-renewable resources. This is of the utmost importance as oil supplies are reducing rapidly and the greenhouse effect {{is becoming more and more}} pronounced. In this work, xylans were isolated from various sources and modified chemically and physically. The material properties were evaluated with a focus on softening behaviour and film formation. Aspen glucuronoxylan extracted with alkali was deacetylated. It aggregated in aqueous solution and crystallized when cast from water. In contrast, DMSO-extracted aspen glucuronoxylan contained acetyl groups, had a higher water solubility and was totally amorphous. The irregularity introduced with the acetyl groups impedes crystallization. The same phenomenon was observed for arabinose substituents when using barley husk arabinoxylan. Aspen glucuronoxylan was acetylated to different degrees of acetyl substitution. Acetylation decreased the interactions with water and introduced a glass transition temperature (Tg). When the effect of esterification on the Tg of corn fibre arabinoxylan was evaluated, it was found that Tg decreased with an increasing degree of substitution and side chain length. It was also shown that xylan has a potential in film applications, such as food packaging. Plasticization of aspen glucuronoxylan with xylitol or sorbitol enabled the formation of continuous films with low oxygen permeability. Barley husk arabinoxylan formed films without the addition of an <b>external</b> <b>plasticizer.</b> An attempt was made to decrease the interactions with water by surface fluorination, at which the films became more hydrophobic with an increasing fluorine content at the film surface. This research contributes to the knowledge of relationships between the xylan structure and its material properties, and it is my hope that this will facilitate the use of xylan in industrial applications in the future...|$|E
40|$|The {{growing amount}} of {{household}} waste {{and the limited}} supply of fossil fuel on earth make it important to find renewable resources {{for the production of}} biodegradable polymers for a variety of applications, particularly as packaging and other disposable products. Hemicelluloses are important components in all plants and the second most abundant plant biopolymers on earth. Although hemicelluloses are biosynthesized to a large extent they are not yet utilized as polymeric materials. The aim {{of the study was to}} find a suitable method to isolate arabinoxylans from barley in order to produce a film forming product that could be used for preparation of oxygen barrier films or coatings. Arabinoxylan has been extracted from barley husks and endosperm fiber using different methods and the chemical composition and detailed structure has been determined. In the husks, the arabinoxylan is tightly bond to cellulose and lignin, building up a complex composite structure. Relatively high amount of chemicals was needed to render them soluble, and a delignification step was necessary to obtain good yields and high purity. The arabinoxylans in the cell walls of the starchy endosperm were more water soluble and could be extracted using less chemicals. This raw material had a higher starch and protein content. It also contained more β-glucans, which might have an effect on material properties and oxygen barrier of films. There were also differences in the fine structure of arabinoxylans from husk and fiber. Barley husk arabinoxylan was found to have longer branches with a terminal xylose unit on the arabinose, and also glucuronic acid substituents, as shown by NMR. Barley fiber arabinoxylan on the other hand had disubstituted xylose residues. The Ara/Xyl ratio was a lot higher in the fiber sample, 0. 63 compared to 0. 22 for the husk arabinoxylans. Films have been made by water casting and material and barrier properties of these have been evaluated. The isolated arabinoxylan formed films without addition of <b>external</b> <b>plasticizer.</b> The degree of arabinose substitution had a large effect on water holding capacity and plasticization of the material. The films were transparent, strong, rather stiff and moisture sensitive. They had good gas barrier properties, and thus have a potential application as biodegradable oxygen barrier films in multilayer food packaging...|$|E
40|$|This {{work has}} focused on using {{agriculture}} residues as raw material for new polymeric materials. Arabinoxylans have been isolated from barley husks and endosperm fiber using alkali extraction, and the chemical composition and detailed structure have been determined. Different isolation conditions, pre-treatments, and purification steps were investigated to find an optimized and environmentally sustainable process. It was shown that a key operation for successful extraction of arabinoxylan from barley husk is the degradation of the lignin network prior to extraction. Delignification was not needed when using endosperm fiber as raw material. The extracts were mixtures of arabinoxylan, β-glucan, starch, and proteins. Sequential purification showed that residual starch makes arabinoxylan films more brittle; β-glucan makes them more flexible, and proteins {{have little or no}} effect at all. If only mechanical properties of films are taken into account, enzymatic removal of starch is the only purification needed. This is very useful information when designing an isolation process, since the number of operations should be kept at a minimum for economic and environmental reasons. Differences in the molecular structure between arabinoxylans from husk and fiber were determined. Barley husk-derived arabinoxylan was found to have disaccharide branches with a terminal xylose unit on the arabinose, and also glucuronic acid substituents, as shown by NMR. Barley fiber arabinoxylan, on the other hand, had xylose residues disubstituted with only arabinose. The Ara/Xyl ratio was much higher in the fiber sample, 0. 63 compared to 0. 22 for the husk arabinoxylans. Films have been made by casting from water solution and material and barrier properties were evaluated. The films were transparent, strong, rather stiff and moisture sensitive. They had good gas barrier properties, and thus have a potential application as biodegradable oxygen barrier films in multilayer food packaging. The isolated arabinoxylan formed films without addition of <b>external</b> <b>plasticizer.</b> This special property was explained by internal plasticizing by water, caused by the ability of arabinose to attract water. Controlled debranching of arabinose substituents showed that the degree of arabinose substitution had a large effect on water holding capacity, plasticization, and crystallinity of the material. Optimal mechanical properties were obtained for arabinoxylan with an Ara/Xyl ratio of 0. 35 - 0. 40. Enzymatic treatment was demonstrated to be a very attractive tool for tailor-making xylans with specific properties. This work shows that bioprocessing of agricultural residues through an optimized, environmentally sustainable process, together with an understanding of the relationship between structure and properties of biopolymers will lead {{to the development of a}} biorefinery for the production of future materials, chemicals, and fuels...|$|E
