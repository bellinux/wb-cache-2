5000|$|Early <b>filing</b> <b>or</b> <b>rasping</b> (the {{distinction}} is emic, not etic) has prehistoric roots and grew naturally {{out of the}} blending of the twin inspirations of cutting with stone cutting tools (such as hand axes) and abrading using natural abrasives, such as well-suited types of stone (for example, sandstone). Relatedly, lapping is also quite ancient, with wood and beach sand offering a natural pair of lap and lapping compound. The Disston authors state, [...] "To abrade, <b>or</b> <b>file,</b> ancient man used sand, grit, coral, bone, fish skin, and gritty woods,—also stone of varying hardness in connection with sand and water." ...|$|R

[...] Upon auscultation, this sign is an extra heart sound of to-and-fro character, typically with three components, ONE systolic and TWO diastolic. It resembles the sound of squeaky leather and often is described as grating, scratching, <b>or</b> <b>rasping.</b> The sound seems {{very close to the}} ear and may seem louder than or may even mask the other heart sounds. The sound usually is best heard between the apex and sternum but may be widespread.|$|R
