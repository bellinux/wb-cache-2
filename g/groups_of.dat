5|$|Domesticated {{guinea pigs}} thrive in <b>groups</b> <b>of</b> two or more; <b>groups</b> <b>of</b> sows, or <b>groups</b> <b>of</b> {{one or more}} sows and a {{neutered}} boar are common combinations. Guinea pigs learn to recognize and bond with other individual guinea pigs, and testing of boars shows their neuroendocrine stress response is significantly lowered {{in the presence of}} a bonded female when compared to the presence of unfamiliar females. <b>Groups</b> <b>of</b> boars may also get along, provided their cage has enough space, they are introduced at an early age, and no females are present. Domestic guinea pigs have developed a different biological rhythm from their wild counterparts, and have longer periods of activity followed by short periods of sleep in between. Activity is scattered randomly over the day; aside from avoidance of intense light, no regular circadian patterns are apparent.|$|E
5|$|In mathematics, {{particularly}} {{algebraic topology}} and homology theory, the Mayer–Vietoris sequence is an algebraic tool to help compute algebraic invariants of topological spaces, known as their homology and cohomology groups. The result {{is due to}} two Austrian mathematicians, Walther Mayer and Leopold Vietoris. The method consists of splitting a space into subspaces, for which the homology or cohomology groups may be easier to compute. The sequence relates the (co)homology <b>groups</b> <b>of</b> the space to the (co)homology <b>groups</b> <b>of</b> the subspaces. It is a natural long exact sequence, whose entries are the (co)homology <b>groups</b> <b>of</b> the whole space, the direct sum of the (co)homology <b>groups</b> <b>of</b> the subspaces, and the (co)homology <b>groups</b> <b>of</b> {{the intersection of the}} subspaces.|$|E
5|$|Like the {{fundamental}} group or the higher homotopy <b>groups</b> <b>of</b> a space, homology groups are important topological invariants. Although some (co)homology theories are computable using tools of linear algebra, many other important (co)homology theories, especially singular (co)homology, are not computable directly from their definition for nontrivial spaces. For singular (co)homology, the singular (co)chains and (co)cycles groups are often {{too big to}} handle directly. More subtle and indirect approaches become necessary. The Mayer–Vietoris sequence is such an approach, giving partial information about the (co)homology <b>groups</b> <b>of</b> any space by relating it to the (co)homology <b>groups</b> <b>of</b> two of its subspaces and their intersection.|$|E
