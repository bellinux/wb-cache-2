Cavanaugh, booked the band to play at Flint's Capitol Theater. The supporting act was MC5, who had <b>just</b> <b>briefly</b> reunited and agreed {{to play at the}} event. The band opened with their popular song [...] "Live Wire" [...] and closed with [...] "It's a Long Way to the Top (If You Wanna Rock 'n' Roll)". They gained invaluable experience of the stadium circuit, supporting leading rock acts such as Aerosmith, Kiss, Styx, UFO, and Blue Öyster Cult, and co-headlined with Cheap Trick.|$|E
2500|$|Lionfish {{are known}} for their venomous fin rays, an {{uncommon}} feature among marine fish in the East Coast coral reefs. The potency of their venom makes them excellent predators and hazardous to fishermen and divers. Pterois venom produced negative inotropic and chronotropic effects when tested in both frog and clam hearts and has a depressing effect on rabbit blood pressure. These results are thought to be due to nitric oxide release. In humans, Pterois venom can cause systemic effects such as extreme pain, nausea, vomiting, fever, breathing difficulties, convulsions, dizziness, redness on the affected area, headache, numbness, paresthesia (pins and needles), heartburn, diarrhea, and sweating. Rarely, such stings can cause temporary paralysis of the limbs, heart failure, and even death. Fatalities are common in very young children, the elderly, those with a weak immune system, or those who are allergic to their venom. Their venom is rarely fatal to healthy adults, but some species have enough venom to produce extreme discomfort for a period of several days. However, Pterois venom is a danger to allergic victims as they may experience anaphylaxis, a serious and often life-threatening condition that requires immediate emergency medical treatment. Severe allergic reactions to Pterois venom include chest pain, severe breathing difficulties, a drop in blood pressure, swelling of the tongue, sweating, runny nose, or slurred speech. Such reactions can be fatal if not treated. There is a possibility for a human to be stung without any venom being [...] injected. If venom is injected, the sting will hurt more than <b>just</b> <b>briefly.</b> Lionfish are not aggressive towards swimmers. Most accidents happen to fishermen who happen to catch them.|$|E
