5|$|In {{the last}} three decades of the 19th century the 3rd Earl Brownlow spent much time and money {{restoring}} Belton, and consequently the house entered the 20th century in a <b>good</b> <b>state</b> of repair and preservation. However, the 20th century was to present Belton and its estate with serious problems. These included the introduction of income tax and death duties which would leave the finances of the Brownlow family severely depleted.|$|E

5|$|Following World War I (a {{period when}} the Machine Gun Corps was based in the park, as {{referred}} to in Henry Williamson's Chronicle of Ancient Sunlight), the Brownlows, like many of their peers, were faced with mounting financial problems. In 1984 they gave the house away—complete with most of its contents. The recipients of their gift, the National Trust, today fully open Belton to the public. It is in a <b>good</b> <b>state</b> of repair and visited by many thousands of tourists each year.|$|E

We show that a deep theoretical connection between <b>good</b> <b>states</b> of affairs and reasons to bring them about can indeed be vindicated by the conceptual connections between <b>good</b> <b>states</b> of affairs, fitting desires that they obtain, and reasons to act out of them. We argue, however, that the conceptual connection between fitting attitudes and reasons for action equally vindicates reasons to do things other than bring about the best states of affairs.

5|$|An {{estimated}} 5,000 {{buildings were}} damaged beyond repair. In the Qazvin province, 120 buildings were demolished and 50 villages suffered massive damage. In the neighboring Hamadan province, 45 villages were destroyed. A {{large majority of}} houses in the region were single-story masonry buildings, and virtually all of these collapsed. As non-engineered structures, these could not withstand seismic forces, with structural failure and collapse resulting from wall-to-wall separation {{and the lack of}} structural integrity and of a proper lateral system of resisting. Newer structures built in accordance with the Iranian code of practice for seismic-resistant design fared much better. Damage to the historic Kharaqan tomb towers, which were in a <b>good</b> <b>state</b> of preservation before the event, suggests that the earthquake was possibly {{one of the most powerful}} in the region for approximately 900 years.|$|E
5|$|A further {{report in}} 1945, {{supporting}} the same conclusion, was produced and stifled. In 1943, two U.S. POWs—Lt. Col. Donald B. Stewart and Col. John H. Van Vliet—had {{been taken by}} Germans to Katyn for an international news conference. Documents released by the National Archives and Records Administration in September 2012 revealed that Steward and Van Vliet sent coded messages to their American superiors indicating that they saw proof that implicated the Soviets. Three lines of evidence were cited. Firstly, the Polish corpses were in such an advanced state of decay that the Nazis could not have killed the Poles, as they had only taken over the area in 1941. Secondly, none of the numerous Polish artifacts, such as letters, diaries, photographs and identification tags pulled from the graves, were dated later than the spring of 1940. Most incriminating was the relatively <b>good</b> <b>state</b> of the men's uniforms and boots, which showed {{that they had not}} lived long after being captured. Later, in 1945, Van Vliet submitted a report concluding that the Soviets were responsible for the massacre. His superior, Major General Clayton Lawrence Bissell, General George Marshall's assistant chief of staff for intelligence, destroyed the report. Washington kept the information secret, presumably to appease Stalin and not distract from the war against the Nazis. During the 1951–52 Congressional investigation into Katyn, Bissell defended his action before the United States Congress, arguing that it was not in the U.S. interest to antagonize an ally (the USSR) whose assistance was still needed against the Empire of Japan. In 1950 Van Vliet recreated his wartime report.|$|E

The fittingness of motives other than desires for <b>good</b> <b>states</b> of affairs – some more intimately related to morality than such desires- undermines consequentialism whether as a theory of rationality or morality. I. Why Consequentialism? Consequentialism is the view that what an agent has most reason or most moral reason to do is determined solely by the goodness of some resulting states of affairs. This may take the form of act consequentialism, according to which one’s (moral) reasons to perform an act are determined directly by whether the act brings about the best consequences. Or it may take some form o...|$|R

40|$|We {{propose a}} rank-dependent {{portfolio}} choice model in continuous time that captures the role {{in decision making}} of three emotions: hope, fear, and aspirations. Hope and fear are modeled through an inverse-S shaped probability weighting function and aspirations through a probabilistic constraint. By employing the recently developed approach of quantile formulation, we solve the portfolio choice problem both thoroughly and analytically. These solutions motivate us to introduce a fear index, a hope index, and a lottery-likeness index to quantify the impacts of three emotions, respectively, on investment behavior. We find that a sufficiently high level of fear endogenously necessitates portfolio insurance. On the other hand, hope {{is reflected in the}} agent's perspective on <b>good</b> <b>states</b> of the world: a higher level of hope causes the agent to include more scenarios under the notion of <b>good</b> <b>states</b> and leads to greater payoffs in sufficiently <b>good</b> <b>states.</b> Finally, an exceedingly high level of aspirations results in the construction of a lottery-type payoff, indicating that the agent needs to enter into a pure gamble in order to achieve his goal. We also conduct numerical experiments to demonstrate our findings. © 2013 Wiley Periodicals, Inc...|$|R

50|$|No state imposes {{sales tax}} on all types of <b>goods.</b> <b>State</b> laws vary widely as to what goods are subject to tax. Food for {{preparation}} and consumption in the home is often not taxable, nor are prescription medications. By contrast, restaurant meals are often taxed.|$|R
40|$|We {{provide a}} {{rationale}} for imposing counter-cyclical capital ratios on banks. In our simple model, bankers cannot pledge the entire future revenues to investors, which limits borrowing in good and bad times. Complete markets do not sufficiently stabilize credit fluctuations, as banks allocate too much borrowing capacity to <b>good</b> <b>states</b> and too little to bad states. As a consequence, bank credit, output, capital prices or wages are excessively volatile. Imposing a (stricter) capital ratio in <b>good</b> <b>states</b> corrects the misallocation of the borrowing capacity, increases expected output and can be beneficial to all agents in the economy. Although in our economy, all agents are risk-neutral, counter-cyclical capital ratios are an effective stabilization tool. To ensure this effectiveness, capital ratios have {{to be based on}} ex ante equity capital, as classical capital ratios can be bypassed...|$|R

30|$|The {{probability}} that an HIV/AIDS patient with {{any one of}} the <b>good</b> <b>states</b> will transition to the death state is increasing with greater age, irrespective of the current state and age of the patient. More generally, the probability of dying decreases with increasing CD 4 counts over time. For an HIV/AIDS patient in a specific state of the disease, the probability of remaining in the same state decreases with increasing age. Within the <b>good</b> <b>states,</b> the results show that the probability of being in a better state is non-zero, but less than the probability of being in a worse state for all ages. At any time of the process, there {{is more likely to be}} in worse state than to be in better one. The reliability analysis indicates that the survival probabilities are all decreasing with increasing ages.|$|R
