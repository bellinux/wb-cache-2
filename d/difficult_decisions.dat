5|$|Along with {{offering}} {{emotional support}} {{to both the}} patient and family, palliative care serves {{an important role in}} addressing goals of care. People with Parkinson's may have many <b>difficult</b> <b>decisions</b> to make as the disease progresses such as wishes for feeding tube, non-invasive ventilator, and tracheostomy; wishes for or against cardiopulmonary resuscitation; and when to use hospice care. Palliative care team members can help answer questions and guide people with Parkinson's on these complex and emotional topics to help them make the best decision based on their own values.|$|E
5|$|In the 1948 season, the White Sox faced <b>difficult</b> <b>decisions</b> {{regarding}} their pitching staff and starting rotation. In {{the midst of}} Caldwell's departure and Papish's absence {{for most of the}} preseason, Grove remained a starter heading into the season, having pitched decently during spring training. In his final exhibition matchup of the season against Johnny Schmitz, Grove pitched the full nine innings and the White Sox defeated the Chicago Cubs 1–0, making Grove the only White Sox pitcher to throw a complete game during the preseason. By the end of May, Grove was the lone White Sox pitcher with a complete game through the first several weeks of the season. However, Grove eventually lost his starting job, {{and by the end of}} the season, he had two wins, 10 losses, a 6.16 ERA, and had started 11 games out of 32 total pitching appearances.|$|E

25|$|In many {{healthcare}} systems, prolonged ventilation as part {{of intensive}} care is a limited resource (in {{that there are only}} so many patients that can receive care at any given moment). It is used to support a single failing organ system (the lungs) and cannot reverse any underlying disease process (such as terminal cancer). For this reason, there can be (occasionally <b>difficult)</b> <b>decisions</b> to be made about whether it is suitable to commence someone on mechanical ventilation. Equally many ethical issues surround the decision to discontinue mechanical ventilation.|$|E

There can also be one assistant referee (especially at tournaments) that helps the referee with making any <b>difficult</b> <b>decisions</b> and in preventing error. Also, scorers are there to record the points of the two individual wrestlers. Finally, a match or meet timekeeper with assistant timekeepers are present to note the match time, timeouts, and time advantage {{and work with the}} scorers.|$|E
25|$|In recent years, DSPD {{has faced}} steep {{obstacles}} in its mission {{to care for}} Utahns with disabilities. The most acute and recent challenge involved funding issues which arose after the economic downturn of 2008. As state tax receipts fell {{in the months following}} the crisis, the legislature began making <b>difficult</b> <b>decisions</b> about how to fund state programs. The Division was asked to make do with a significant budget reduction. DSPD decided {{that the best way to}} reduce operational costs was to privatize casework. This allowed the Division to preserve critical services. By the end of 2009, all but a handful of caseworkers had transitioned from direct employment with the state to a private contractor. In both 2010 and 2011, the Division met additional budget shortfalls with staffing reductions, to avoid the reduction of critical services to waiver services recipients. It has been challenging for the Division to meet the same workload demands with less staff and resources.|$|E
25|$|Oxenham is {{best known}} for her Abbey Series of 38 titles which chart the lives of the main {{characters}} from their mid-teens until their daughters reach a similar age. The Hamlet Club, formed in the first book in the series Girls of the Hamlet Club, was set up to combat snobbery in the school. Underlying the club’s overt activities of folk-dancing and rambles was its motto 'To be or not to be', and its badge, the Whiteleaf Cross. These were both symbols of deeper meanings. The motto, deliberately using a quote from the Shakespeare play Hamlet, is taken to mean to make the right choice, usually duty above self-interest, when it arises. Throughout the Abbey Series the various main characters come up against this choice and its consequences, and are shown growing and maturing through making <b>difficult</b> <b>decisions.</b> The badge, taken from a landmark local to the area in which the series is set, is also symbolic—as is any cross—of sacrifice.|$|E

25|$|The Tunisians populace {{appreciated}} {{the introduction of}} such improvements, but noticed the advantages the Protectorate bestowed on the European newcomers. Community leaders began {{to appeal to the}} self-proclaimed public virtues of the French state, e.g., droit humane, in order to obtain equal treatment with the French colons. Yet at first such appeals resulted more often than not in disappointment, increasingly so, enough that many Tunisians turned cynical regarding the Protectorate's claims. Mass movements arose. Yet not all French officials were non-responsive. From the start, the fundamental nature of the colonial enterprise had been disputed. Various causes and/or justifications were proposed during the period of the Protectorate as its self-explanation: for revenue and natural resources, for export markets, for cultural expansion and national prestige, for career opportunities and jobs for the arriving colons, or as a frontier for the military. French policy, in attempting to satisfy such a variety of rationals, could shift in focus from one to another, often depending on which French administrator made the choices and the immediate circumstances. As a natural result French policy was not always consistent over time. During the latter decades of the Protectorate, local French officials increasing also sought to better address the needs, complaints, and demands of the Tunisian people. On many issues, the Protectorate could be confronted with its own contradictory objectives, and underlying political conflicts, leading to <b>difficult</b> <b>decisions</b> or negotiations.|$|E

Just {{as he starts}} developing romantic feelings for his teammate Fred (Amy Acker), he finds himself mystically influenced to kill her after a demon influences him to become homicidally misogynistic. While studying the birth of Angel's infant son Connor, Wesley discovers a prophecy which claims that Angel will kill the baby. Intending {{to take him to}} safety, Wesley betrays his friends and kidnaps Connor, a decision which has disastrous consequences when he has his throat slit and the baby is kidnapped into a hell dimension by Angel's sworn enemy, Holtz. Angel then attempts to kill him while he is in recovery at the hospital. Alienated from Angel Investigations, a recovered Wesley forms his own team to fight evil, but maintains an interest in his former friends' affairs. He also begins a sexual relationship with Wolfram & Hart lawyer Lilah Morgan (Stephanie Romanov), who tries to convince him to join the firm. In the fourth season (2002–2003), Angel is rescued and revived by Wesley after being sunk {{to the bottom of the}} ocean by his now-adolescent son Connor (Vincent Kartheiser).
