5|$|Lapierre spent five-and-a-half {{seasons in}} the Canadiens {{organization}} before being traded to the Anaheim <b>Ducks</b> <b>in</b> December 2010. Two months later, he {{was traded to the}} Vancouver Canucks and helped the team to the 2011 Stanley Cup Finals, where they lost to the Boston Bruins. On July 5, 2013, Lapierre signed with the St. Louis Blues as a free agent. On January 27, 2015, Lapierre was traded from St. Louis to the Pittsburgh Penguins in exchange for Marcel Goc.|$|E
5|$|Loons and grebes, which nest on lakes but winter at sea, {{are usually}} {{categorized}} as water birds, not seabirds. Although {{there are a}} number of sea <b>ducks</b> <b>in</b> the family Anatidae that are truly marine in the winter, by convention they are usually excluded from the seabird grouping. Many waders (or shorebirds) and herons are also highly marine, living on the sea's edge (coast), but are also not treated as seabirds.|$|E
5|$|Following the 2004–05 NHL lockout, the Avalanche {{were forced}} to lose many of their key players {{in order to stay}} below the salary cap. Even with the loss of {{teammates}} Peter Forsberg and Adam Foote, Sakic still helped the Avalanche get into the playoffs, where they eventually lost to the Anaheim <b>Ducks</b> <b>in</b> the conference semi-finals. In June 2006, Sakic signed a one-year, $5.75 million deal to keep him with the Avalanche for the 2006–07 season. Upon the retirement of Steve Yzerman a month later, on July 3, 2006, Sakic became the League leader for most NHL career points scored among active players.|$|E

5|$|Gilchrist's form dipped momentarily, {{with a rare}} king pair (two golden <b>ducks</b> <b>in</b> {{the same}} match) in the Second Test in Kolkata and just two runs in his two innings in Chennai. He was out LBW four {{consecutive}} {{times in the last}} two Tests, three of these to Harbhajan Singh, who took 32 wickets in the series to end Australia's run by inflicting a 2–1 series loss. His one-day form remained strong, with 172 runs at 43.00 in the ODI series in India, as Australia bounced back to win the series 3–2. During this series he captained the ODI team for the first time, winning all three of the matches under his captaincy.|$|E
5|$|In the 2014–15 season, the Flames, {{assisted}} by 2013 draft pick Monahan and other highly touted prospect Johnny Gaudreau, won {{one of their}} final home games against the Los Angeles Kings to clinch their first playoff spot since 2009, which eliminated the Kings from the playoffs. They eliminated the Vancouver Canucks in six games {{in the first round}} of the playoffs (which was their first playoff series win since 2004) but would be eliminated by the Anaheim <b>Ducks</b> <b>in</b> five games in the second round.|$|E

At the time, he was playing in his fifth season with the Lightning. He appeared in 17 games, and had four assists on the year. Brewer played in 246 games with Tampa, scoring 10 goals and 46 assists. He also had 180 penalty minutes in his four-and-a quarter seasons with Tampa Bay.

5|$|On 15June1839 the {{entrepreneur}} and former Member of Parliament for Buckingham, Sir Harry Verney, 2nd Baronet, opened the Aylesbury Railway. Built {{under the direction}} of Robert Stephenson, it connected the London and Birmingham Railway's Cheddington railway station on the West Coast Main Line to Aylesbury High Street railway station in eastern Aylesbury. On 1October1863 the Wycombe Railway also built a line to Aylesbury, from Princes Risborough railway station to a station on the western side of Aylesbury (the present-day Aylesbury railway station). The arrival of the railway had a powerful impact on the duck industry, and up to a ton of <b>ducks</b> <b>in</b> a night were being shipped from Aylesbury to Smithfield Market in London by 1850.|$|E
5|$|On February 15, {{the team}} had a record of 27–25–5 and was five points out of playoff position.

On February 26, the team traded defenseman Ryan Whitney to the Anaheim <b>Ducks</b> <b>in</b> return for Chris Kunitz. Before the trade deadline on March 4, they acquired Bill Guerin from the New York Islanders. Under Bylsma, the team went 18–3–4, including 10–1–2 in March, and lost only one home game.|$|E

5|$|The First World War {{badly damaged}} the {{remaining}} duck industry in Buckinghamshire, wiping out the small scale producers and {{leaving only a}} few large farms. Disruption caused by the Second World War further damaged the industry. By the 1950s only one significant flock of Aylesbury ducks remained in Buckinghamshire, and by 1966 there were no duck-breeding or -rearing businesses of any size remaining in Aylesbury itself. Although {{there is only one}} surviving flock of pure Aylesbury <b>ducks</b> <b>in</b> the United Kingdom and the breed is critically endangered in the United States, the Aylesbury duck remains a symbol of the town of Aylesbury, and appears on the coat of arms of Aylesbury and on the club badge of Aylesbury United.|$|E
5|$|Unlike the Rouen duck, {{the other}} popular meat variety in England in the 19th century, Aylesbury ducks lay eggs from early November. Aylesbury ducks fatten quickly and by eight weeks after {{hatching}} weigh up to , {{large enough to}} eat but still young and extremely tender. Consequently, their meat came onto the market from February onwards, after {{the close of the}} game season but before the earliest spring chickens were on sale. Rouen ducks, whose mallard-like coloration made them less valuable, lay eggs from early February and take six months to grow large enough to eat. As a consequence, Aylesbury ducks were sold primarily in the spring and summer, and Rouen <b>ducks</b> <b>in</b> the autumn and winter.|$|E
5|$|After five-and-a-half seasons playing {{within the}} Canadiens organization, Lapierre {{was traded to}} the Anaheim <b>Ducks</b> <b>in</b> {{exchange}} for defenceman Brett Festerling and a fifth-round draft pick in 2012 on December 31, 2010. He made his Ducks debut on January 5, 2011, in a 4–1 loss to the Nashville Predators. The following game, he recorded his first point as a Duck, assisting on a goal by Matt Beleskey in a 6–0 win against the Columbus Blue Jackets. Lapierre played 21 games with the Ducks, recording three assists in that span, before being dealt again prior to the NHL trade deadline on February 28, 2011. He was sent to the Vancouver Canucks, along with forward MacGregor Sharp, in exchange for minor-league forward Joel Perrault and a third-round draft pick in 2012.|$|E

5|$|After scoring two {{consecutive}} <b>ducks</b> <b>in</b> the Test series against Sri Lanka, Pathan was elevated to {{opening in the}} second innings of the Second Test in Delhi, after regular opener Virender Sehwag was down with illness. Having taken 3/34 from 22 overs in the first innings, Pathan scored 93 runs, building on a first innings lead of 60 to help set up a winning target of 436. In the following match in Ahmedabad, he scored 82 runs and combined in a century stand with V. V. S. Laxman to revive India after an early batting collapse saw five wickets fall {{during the first half}} of the opening day. He also took seven wickets at an average of 26.00 runs in the series, which India won 2–0. Pathan later admitted that he had been disappointed in failing to score a Test century. Following his strong performances in 2005, Pathan was promoted in December to an A-grade contract by the Board of Control for Cricket in India.|$|E
5|$|Although {{the match}} results were {{encouraging}} {{for such a}} young and inexperienced team, Craig scored only 103runs at 14.71. Despite his contributions as a leader, this was not up to standard. He had trouble with his defence, being bowled eight times in 17innings. In the 12 matches {{in the last three}} months of the tour, Craig passed fifty only once in 13 innings. However, the selectors did not have to reverse their youth policy: Craig contracted a bout of hepatitis before the start of the 1958–59 season. He returned to cricket at the beginning of the season, but was underprepared, scoring two <b>ducks</b> <b>in</b> his only two innings of the season, the second coming against the touring England team. Craig declared that he was not ready for a return to Test cricket and relinquished the captaincy, which the selectors handed to Benaud. Benaud went on to defeat England 4–0; as England were widely regarded as the best team at the time, this established him as captain of a resurgent Australia.|$|E
5|$|Early in the 2006–07 season, {{he scored}} his first NHL goal on October 13, 2006, against Vesa Toskala {{in a loss}} to the San Jose Sharks. Bieksa rapidly {{developed}} {{into one of the}} Canucks' top blueliners and finished the season leading all team defencemen with 30 assists, 42 points and 134 penalty minutes, while also tallying a career-high 12 goals. Paired with stay-at-home defenceman Willie Mitchell, he was also regularly given a shutdown role against opposing teams' top forwards. At the end of his first full NHL season, he was awarded the Canucks' Babe Pratt Trophy as best defenceman and Fred J. Hume Award as the unsung hero. In Bieksa’s first NHL playoff game he had just over 55 mins of ice time in a quadruple Overtime victory against the Dallas Stars. Later in the series Bieksa suffered three stomach oblique muscle tears in Game 6 sidelining him for five games, before the Canucks were eliminated by the Anaheim <b>Ducks</b> <b>in</b> the second round.|$|E
