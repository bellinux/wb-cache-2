5000|$|Gottman et al. {{found that}} <b>fathers</b> <b>who</b> are {{more aware of}} their sadness were more affectionate and have wives who were [...] "less contemptuous and belligerent" [...] (198). <b>Fathers</b> <b>who</b> {{followed}} an emotion-coaching philosophy with concern to both sadness and anger were less defensive and more affectionate, but <b>fathers</b> <b>who</b> were merely aware of their own anger and their child's anger were more defensive and belligerent. Thus, the father's awareness of his anger was not necessarily a positive quality with concern to his marriage. On the other hand, <b>fathers</b> <b>who</b> maintained an emotion-coaching philosophy were more affectionate with their spouses and have wives who were also more affectionate and less contemptuous.|$|R

40|$|Whereas {{the effect}} of {{motherhood}} on women’s earnings has been well documented, {{little research has been}} done in Canada exploring the impact of fatherhood on men’s earnings. Although international research has shown that, unlike women, men who have a child increase their earnings, {{a growing body of research}} suggests that this benefit may be mediated by whether or not the father takes a parental leave. Using the 2011 General Social Survey (GSS) on family issues and employing ordinary least squares regression I investigate whether fathers receive an earnings bonus compared to childless men and whether <b>fathers</b> <b>who</b> take paternity/ parental leave earn less than <b>fathers</b> <b>who</b> do not. Our findings show that after controlling for personal and work related characteristics fathers earn significantly more than childless men and <b>fathers</b> <b>who</b> took paternity/parental leave earn significantly less than <b>fathers</b> <b>who</b> did not. Potential explanations for these earnings gaps are discussed...|$|R

40|$|It {{is unclear}} whether {{information}} obtained from a one parent {{can be used to}} infer the other parent’s history of psychopathology. Two hundred and one parental dyads were asked to complete psychiatric interviews. Based on maternal report, non-participating husbands/ fathers had higher rates than participating fathers of psychiatric illness. For <b>fathers</b> <b>who</b> did participate, maternal report did not match direct interview of paternal psychopathology with sensitivities less than 0. 40 and positive predictive values of 0. 33 to 0. 74. Psychopathology may be over-represented among <b>fathers</b> <b>who</b> do not participate in research. Mother report of paternal symptoms is not an effective proxy.
