40|$|Abstract: Generalized Hyperbolic distributions, {{introduced}} by Barndorff-Nielsen in 1977, have become quite popular in various areas of theoretical and applied statistics. These distributions possess {{a number of}} attractive properties and they allow representation of the skewness and their tails tend to be heavier {{than those of the}} normal. In this paper we develop a numerical algorithm for estimating the parameters of both Hyperbolic (HYP) and Normal <b>Inverse</b> <b>Gaussian</b> (NIG) <b>distributions</b> via Maximum Likelihood. This task relies on numerical methods for solving systems of nonlinear equations. We give two C programs, based on GSL library available under GPL license, for the estimation procedure.

40|$|This note {{describes}} estimation algorithms for generalized hyperbolic, hyperbolic {{and normal}} <b>inverse</b> <b>Gaussian</b> <b>distributions.</b> These distributions {{provide a better}} t to empirically observed log-return distributions of nancial assets than the classical normal distributions. Based on the better t to the semi-heavy tails of nancial assets we can compute more realistic Value-at-Risk estimates. The modelling of nancial assets as stochastic processes is determined by distributional assumptions on the increments and the dependence structure. It {{is well known that}} the returns of most nancial assets have semi-heavy tails, i. e. the actual kurtosis is higher than the zero kurtosis of the normal distribution (see Pagan (1996)). On the other hand the use of stable distributions leads to models with nonexisting moments. The class of generalized hyperbolic distributions and its sub-classes { the hyperbolic and the normal <b>inverse</b> <b>Gaussian</b> <b>distributions</b> { possess these semi-heavy tails. Generalized hyperbolic distributions were introduced by Barndor-Nielsen (1977) and applied e. g. to model grain size distributions of wind blown sands.
