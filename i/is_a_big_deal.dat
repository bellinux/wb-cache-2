[...] The girls performed wearing spandex-and-leather getups, while a backdrop was displayed in the background with images of flashbulbs, tabloid headlines and diamonds. They were joined by America's Best Dance Crew winners the Jabbawockeez who descended from the ceiling wearing matching red T-shirts with stark-white masks covering their faces, and baseball caps perched at 45-degree angles atop their heads. Of the performance, Geoff Boucher from the Los Angeles Times commented: [...] "the Pussycat Dolls' set climaxed with a powerful pyro display that left celebs {{in the first few}} rows feeling a bit roasted". MTV Buzzworthy described the performance as [...] "sexy" [...] and [...] "sultry". However, Tod Martens, in another review for the Los Angeles Times, criticized their performance. He commented: [...] " [...] onstage looking like they had escaped a taping for a sexed-up Jazzercise video." [...] He also wrote that Scherzinger never commanded the song except on [...] "the cut's final seconds when she turned her vocals up to a growl" [...] and noted JabbaWockeez's appearance as [...] "annoy".|$|E

At home, Clinton was even more expansive, looking on a worldwide basis: [...] "I believe that the rights of women and girls is the unfinished business of the 21st century. We see women and girls across the world who are oppressed and violated and demeaned and degraded and denied so much of what they are entitled to as our fellow human beings." [...] She also maintained that the well-being of women in other countries was a direct factor in American self-interest: [...] "This <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>big</b> <b>deal</b> for American values and for American foreign policy and our interests, {{but it is also a}} big deal for our security. Because where women are disempowered and dehumanized, you are more likely to see not just antidemocratic forces, but extremism that leads to security challenges for us."
