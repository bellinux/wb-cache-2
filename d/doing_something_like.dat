According to Denham, a popular phrase amongst those protesting was [...] "I never thought that I would find myself <b>doing</b> <b>something</b> <b>like</b> this." [...] Stephen Ward, who {{had been involved in}} the original 1970s protest, decided in early 1993 that excessive force was being used against protesters, and started keeping a log of events. He used this log when defending other protesters in court, visited those who had been imprisoned, and offered them bail. He subsequently established a legal precedent of the right for protesters and demonstrators to have a witness while being questioned.|$|E
500|$|... "Stupid Girl" [...] {{began as}} a rough demo around January 1994. It was {{recorded}} during informal studio sessions between Duke Erikson, Steve Marker and Butch Vig in Marker's home basement recording studio in Madison, Wisconsin prior to Shirley Manson joining the group. The band had been jamming using an ADAT eight-track, AKAI samplers and a small drum kit. Vig took a loop from the drum introduction from The Clash's [...] "Train In Vain" [...] and added further percussion. Afterwards, Marker created the bassline, under the request of <b>doing</b> <b>something</b> <b>like</b> Creedence Clearwater Revival's [...] "Suzie Q", [...] "something that's almost like a Motown feel". Erikson finished off what became the song's core with a jangly guitar riff.|$|E
500|$|Since Grohl {{felt the}} songs were {{different}} from the band's previous input and [...] "had {{the potential to be}} something great", he considered that instead of <b>doing</b> <b>something</b> <b>like</b> the last three albums, the band had to go out of [...] "our own comfort zone" [...] and [...] "needed someone to push us out of there". So Grohl decided to work again with Gil Norton, who produced the band's second album The Colour and the Shape, citing how Norton taught the band of the importance of pre-production and refining the composition, and claiming Norton's [...] "unconventional" [...] approach [...] "seems to capture the best of this band", considering that with him [...] "we're not going to do a straightforward AC/DC record, he's gonna make it different".|$|E

[...] Since the rape was, as he called it, [...] "so in-depth and so brutal", he viewed Todd and Marty <b>doing</b> <b>something</b> <b>like</b> having drinks with each other bizarre. Entertainment Weekly reported that One Life to Live agreed to let Howarth go on the condition he would not appear on another soap opera for twelve months. Indy Week said, [...] "Todd was partially redeemed into a self-destructive antihero who remained popular until the show's end, but his portrayer and many critics were wary of having him becoming a romantic lead." ...|$|E

It should be who we are at that particular moment. We still want to create something that's better than what we did before. That's what keeps you interested in what you do. But if along the way we {{feel that there is}} another album we should recognize once again, then we'll do it." [...] LaBrie also stated that the band will concentrate on [...] "one album at a time and not thinking in a concept", and added, [...] "Unless we wanna write an epic song that has multiple parts in it. <b>Doing</b> <b>something</b> <b>like</b> that might be cool. Something like A Change of Seasons. But a whole album again, no." [...] The album is currently slated for early 2019.|$|E

[...] It is not recorded that Corbin accepted this cheerful invitation, but for a few days afterwards he was more darkly observant of, and respectful to, Miss Sally. Strange indeed if he had not noticed--although always in his resigned fashion--the dull green stagnation of the life around him, or when not accepting it as part of his trouble he had not chafed at the arrested youth and senile childishness of the people. Stranger still if he had not at times been startled to hear the outgrown superstitions and follies of his youth voiced again by grown-up men, and perhaps strangest of all if he had not vaguely accepted it all as the hereditary curse of that barbarism under which he himself had survived and suffered.|$|E
