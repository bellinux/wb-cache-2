40|$|A {{low speed}} survey was {{conducted}} on a 3. 44 aspect ratio wing having a 65 ° swept-back leading edge and double wedge symmetrical airfoil section to obtain information as {{to the effectiveness of}} various high-lift devices. These devices included trailing edge split and extended split flaps, leading edge split flaps, slats and combined configurations. Tests were carried out on the wing with and without the fuselage and horizontal tail surface. The split flaps increased the lift over the lower ranges of angle of attack only. The extended split flaps increased the lift over the whole angle of attack range. Hose flaps showed practically no gain over any of the range when used by themselves. However, when combined with the trailing edge split flaps in the wing-fuselage configuration, the optimum maximum lift conditions were obtained. Addition of the fuselage and horizontal tail surfaces each produced considerable increments of lift. In all configurations except leading edge flaps in the <b>inboard</b> <b>position</b> undesirably large negative pitching moments resulted. However, they had stabilizing tendencies except where there were irregularities in the lift curves...|$|E
40|$|Objective: The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{evaluate}} and propose improvements to the injury mitigation systems, in near-side impacts, for 6 common sitting positions of young adolescents using a previously validated model. Methods: The evaluation was made by using a model of a complete passenger car, including head and thorax–pelvis air bags, which was impacted laterally by a barrier in 2 load cases. The SID-IIs finite element model was used for the evaluations and was seated in 6 different positions in the rear outboard seat: the nominal anthropomorphic test device (ATD) position, 1 <b>inboard</b> <b>position,</b> 3 outboard positions, and 1 braking (forward) position. These positions have previously been identified as common sitting positions in awake and asleep children. The studied dependent variables were head injury criterion (HIC) 36, resultant head linear acceleration, resultant head rotational acceleration, chest viscous criterion, and chest deflection. Results: The lowest head injury measures were seen in the braking positions and in the nominal ATD position, and the highest were seen in the inboard and outboard positions. The lowest chest injury measures were recorded in the inboard and nominal ATD positions, and the highest were recorded in the outboard and braking positions. The occupant in the outboard positions interfered with the air bags during their deployment. The occupant in inboard and braking positions tended to push the curtain air bag over the windowsill. Conclusions: Studies that investigate the injury mitigation effects in common sitting positions, beyond the nominal ATD position, are essential to highlight means to provide improved and robust safety for child occupants. This study was based on the SID-IIs 5 th percentile female, which has very similar anthropometry to a 50 th percentile 12 -year-old. Therefore, the conclusions of this study are applicable to many 11 -year-olds up to young adolescents, as well as to small females. The outboard and inboard positions of this study resulted in the highest head injury measures. Although all of the injury measures were only slightly higher than the nominal position, the trends suggest that, in near-side impacts, these positions should be discouraged. The extensively outboard positions resulted in unfavorable air bag positioning during deployment. The <b>inboard</b> <b>position</b> resulted in head strikes further forward of the nominal one; the curtain air bags need inflated cells at all locations of head strike...|$|E
40|$|The {{effect of}} dynamic {{pitch-up}} motion of delta wing on twin-tail buffet response is investigated. The computational model {{consists of a}} delta wing-twin tail configuration. The computations are carried out on a dynamic multi-block grid structure. This multidisciplinary problem is solved using three sets of equations which consists of the unsteady Navier-Stokes equations, the aeroelastic equations, and the grid displacement equations. The configuration is pitched-up from zero up to 60 deg. angle of attack, and the freestream Mach number and Reynolds number are 0. 3 and 1. 25 million, respectively. With the twin tail fixed as rigid surfaces and with no-forced pitch-up motion, the problem is solved for the initial flow conditions. Next, the problem is solved for the twin-tail response for uncoupled bending and torsional vibrations due to the unsteady loads on the twin tail and due to the forced pitch-up motion. The dynamic pitch-up problem is also solved for the flow response with the twin tail kept rigid. The configuration is investigated for <b>inboard</b> <b>position</b> of the twin tail which corresponds to a separation distance between the twin tail of 33 % wing chord. The computed results are compared with the available experimental data...|$|E

40|$|Rotational {{effects are}} known to {{influence}} severely the aerodynamic performance of the inboard region of rotor blades. The underlying physical mechanisms are however far from being well understood. The present work addresses this problem using Reynolds averaged Navier-Stokes computations and experimental results of the MEXICO (Model Experiments in Controlled Conditions) rotor. Four axisymmetric inflow cases with wind speeds ranging from pre-stall to post-stall conditions are computed and compared with pressure and particle image velocimetry (PIV) experimental data, obtaining, in general, consistent results. At low angles of attack, the aerodynamic behavior {{of all of the}} studied blade sections resembles the one from the corresponding 2 D airfoils. However, at high angles of attack, rotational effects lead to stall delay and/or lift enhancement at <b>inboard</b> <b>positions.</b> Such effects are shown to occur only in the presence of significant radial flows. Interestingly, the way in which rotational effects influence the aerodynamics of the MEXICO blades differs qualitatively in certain aspects from the descriptions found in the literature about this topic.

40|$|Adaptive active {{flow control}} for twin-tail buffet {{alleviation}} is investigated. The concept behind {{this technique is}} to place control ports on the tail outer and inner surfaces with flow suction or blowing applied through these ports {{in order to minimize}} the pressure difference across the tail. The suction or blowing volume flow rate from each port is proportional to the pressure difference across the tail at this location. A parametric study {{of the effects of the}} number and location of these ports on the buffet response is carried out. The computational model consists of a sharp-edged delta wing of aspect ratio one and swept-back flexible twin tail with taper ratio of 0. 23. This complex multidisciplinary problem is solved sequentially using three sets of equations for the fluid flow, aeroelastic response and grid deformation, using a dynamic multi-block grid structure. The computational model is pitched at 30 deg angle of attack. The freestream Mach number and Reynolds number are 0. 3 and 1. 25 million, respectively. The model is investigated for the <b>inboard</b> <b>position</b> of the twin tails, which corresponds to a separation distance between the twin tails of 33 % of the wing span.

40|$|Effectiveness {{of active}} flow control for twin- tail buffet {{alleviation}} is investigated. Tangen- tial leading-edge blowing (TLEB) and flow suction along the vortex cores (FSVC) of the lead- ing {{edges of the}} delta wing are used to delay the vortex breakdown flow upstream of the twin tail. The combined effect of the TLEB and FSVC is also investigated. A parametric study {{of the effects of}} the spanwise position of the suction tubes and volumetric suction flow rate on the twin-tail buffet response are also investigated. The TLEB moves the path of leading-edge vortices laterally towards the twin tail, which increases the aero- dynamic damping on the tails. The FSVC effectively delays the breakdown location at high angles of attack. The computational model consists of a sharp-edged delta wing of aspect ratio one and swept-back flexible twin tail with taper ratio of 0. 23.

40|$|The {{effect of}} dynamic rolling {{oscillations}} of delta-wing/twin-tail configuration on twin-tail buffet response is investigated. The computational model {{consists of a}} sharp-edged delta wing of aspect ratio one and swept-back flexible twin tail with taper ratio of 0. 23. The configuration model is statically pitched at 30 deg. angle of attack and then forced to oscillate in roll around the symmetry axis at a constant amplitude of 4 deg. and reduced frequency of pi and 2 (pi). The freestream Mach number and Reynolds number are 0. 3 and 1. 25 million, respectively. This multidisciplinary problem is solved using three sets of equations on a dynamic multi-block grid structure. The first set is the unsteady, full Navier-Stokes equations, the second set is the aeroelastic equations for coupled bending and torsion vibrations of the tails, and the third set is the grid-displacement equations. The configuration is investigated for <b>inboard</b> <b>position</b> of the twin tails which corresponds to a separation distance between the twin tails of 33 % wing span. The computed results are compared {{with the results of}} stationary configuration, which previously have been validated using experimental data.

5000|$|The Lotus 76 was a Formula One car {{designed}} by Colin Chapman, Tony Rudd and Ralph Bellamy for the 1974 Formula One season.

The car also featured a bi-plane rear wing, designed to increase rear downforce and stability. Additionally it had an electronically operated clutch, which was the precursor to the modern semi automatic gearboxes seen on today's F1 cars, with the control mounted into the gearstick which theoretically speeded up gearchanges. The Lotus 76 was seen as a major technological breakthrough by Team Lotus. Outwardly, the car looked sleek and impressive.

50|$|The forward wing {{was divided}} into two half spans so that their angles of {{incidence}} could be altered together to control pitch or independently for roll. The semi-spans were built around main box spars with spruce spar caps and plywood webs. Forward of the spar the wings were ply skinned, forming a D-shaped torsion box. Ribs were built from spruce trellis work. There was a secondary spar behind the main one and an over-all fabric covering. A trim tab was <b>positioned</b> <b>inboard</b> on {{the trailing edge of}} each half-span. The rear wing was similarly constructed but fixed in place. A long trailing edge flap could be raised, but not lowered, to steepen descents. The tips carried triangular endplate fins fitted with horn balanced rudders, spring centred and only opening outwards. These vertical tails were wooden structures with fabric covering.|$|R
40|$|A salt {{shoulder}} is a low-angle {{segment of}} the salt-sediment interface where the margin of a passive diapir steps abruptly inboard. The Late Triassic Chinle Formation overlies caprock on the northeastern margin of Gypsum Valley (GV) at the salt-sediment interface in the natural amphitheater of Bridge Canyon. Modern erosion of the Dolores River has created 3 D outcrop of the salt shoulder, expressed by a 500 meter wide, sub-horizontal platform that dips abruptly into the subsurface to the northeast toward the Dry Creek minibasin. Within Bridge Canyon, seven facies associations have been recognized and interpreted within the Chinle Formation: 1) non-caprock bearing channel-fill sandstone and stratified conglomerate (FA 1), 2) caprock-bearing channel-fill sandstone and stratified conglomerate (FA 2), 3) tabular shale, siltstone (FA 3), 4) unsorted conglomerate lense (FA 4), 5) caprock-bearing heterolithic channel sandstone and conglomerate (FA 5), 6) fossiliferous mudstones 2 ̆ 6 sandstones (FA 6), 7) paleosols (FA 7). The erosional contact between the Chinle Formation and caprock indicates the development of caprock prior to Chinle deposition. The distribution of facies associations transition from relatively coarser grained facies, including sheet-prone sandstone bodies of FA 1 2 ̆ 6 FA 2 and subordinate fine grained facies of FA 3 on the outboard margin to isolated ribbon sand bodies of FA 2 and FA 5 and more common fine-grained facies of FA 3 toward the inboard margin of the salt wall. ^ The Chinle Formation thins from approximately 160 meters at the outboard margin of the salt wall to 53 meters at the inboard margin. Three wedge halokinetic sequences onlap and overlap the shoulder forming an antiformal geometry of strata that are separated by low angle halokinetic sequence boundaries (2 – 3 °). The lowest of the three halokinetic sequences (WHS- 1) thins from 12. 5 meters to pinchout over a distance of 200 meters, and is distinguished from the overlying halokinetic sequence (WHS- 2) by an angular unconformity of 2 °. The WHS- 2 reaches a maximum thickness of 27. 5 meters and onlaps onto the shoulder over a distance of 325 meters, and is distinguished from the overlying halokinetic sequence by an angular unconformity of 3 °. The third wedge halokinetic sequence reaches a maximum thickness of 120 meters and thins to 53 meters where it onlaps and overlaps onto the shoulder. The three wedge halokinetic sequences of the Chinle Formations stack into a tapered-CHS. ^ The evolution of the GV shoulder is described through the following sequence: (1) development of a Moenkopi-aged caprock on the GV salt wall through meteoric groundwater influx, (2) regional beveling {{at the end of}} Moenkopi/beginning of Chinle deposition, documented as the Tr- 3 unconformity, (3) decrease in salt rise during Chinle deposition leading to progressive onlap and eventual overlap over the shoulder, (4) rotation of WHS- 1 and WHS- 2 by subsidence of the Dry Creek Minibasin flanking the still active northeast margin of the GV salt wall, evident by halokinetic sequence boundaries, (5) subsequent overlap by WHS- 3 due to discontinued of the northeast margin of the GV salt wall created a drape-fold monocline overlying the shoulder, and (6) continued salt rise continued at an <b>inboard</b> <b>position</b> creating topography explaining the presence of the FA 4 debris flows observed at the inboard margin of the salt wall in WHS- 3. This timing has an effect that is two-fold: the outboard margin of the shoulder discontinues drape folding strata, as the drape folding zone transitions to the inboard margin of the salt wall, where salt continues to rise creating a new zone of drape folding. Chinle through Navajo strata share common high angle normal fault planes that collapsed strata overlying the shoulder that are dipping into the salt wall completing the antiformal geometry of the strata overlying the shoulder. ...|$|E
40|$|In {{order to}} {{determine}} the effect of turboprop propulsion on the aerodynamic benefits of formation flight, a 3 D Vortex Filament Method (VFM) programme, which made use of a Burnham-Hallock viscous core model, was formulated and employed to model the progression and interaction of the wing and turboprop trailing wakes. Within this programme, an initial prescribed wake for the turboprop engines was discretised by shed helicoidal vortex filaments generated by the use of an amalgamation of the propeller theory of Goldstein and Theodorsen. The downwash velocity field of a B 747 during cruise, obtained via the use of the VFM Burnham-Hallock (VFM B-H) model programme, was verified against both the simulation conducted by Ehret and Oertel, in which an integrated Biot-Savart law VFM was utilised, as well as against experimental results obtained by Burnham et al. in their ground-based measurements of the wake vortex characteristics of a B 747 aircraft. The VFM B-H model produced peak upwash and downwash velocities which matched those obtained by Ehret and Oertel to within 95 % accuracy. Furthermore, a distance of 47. 48 m between the rolled up vortex centres was achieved utilising the programmed VFM B-H model, which differed from the Ehret and Oertel model by only 0. 48 m. Qualitatively, the 3 D VFM B-H plot displayed similar degrees of roll-up and descent when compared to their Biot-Savart VFM plot. As a result of this positive validation process, the programmed VFM B-H model was utilised to simulate turboprop aircraft wakes of a higher complexity. In order to compare the effects of the number of turboprop engines on the aerodynamic benefits of formation flight, the three-bladed single turboprop engine Lancair Propjet, the six-bladed twin turboprop engine ATR 72 and the four-bladed four engine Lockheed Martin P- 3 Orion were selected for comparative simulations. As extended formation flight makes use of aircraft downstream separation distances of more than ten wingspans, a wake length of 330 m (which equates to 10. 9 span lengths for the P- 3 Orion, 12. 4 span lengths for the ATR 72 and 36. 3 span lengths for the Lancair Propjet) was selected. All aircraft were simulated via the use of the VFM B-H model programme for a range of flight states from cruise conditions to zero g wing loading with full propeller thrust, such as in vertical ascents. From said simulations a novel viscous core radius to simulation convergence relationship equation was developed. The induced velocity fields at 330 m downstream in the wake were then generated in order to investigate the effects of the inclusion of turboprop engines on the aerodynamic benefits of formation flight. From said downwash plots, {{it was found that the}} helicoidal vortices affected that region of the wake within an average value of 35 % of the wingspan, measured from the fuselage symmetry plane, for all simulated aircraft. In aircraft design, wing mounted engines are placed in a more <b>inboard</b> <b>position</b> in order to reduce rudder strength requirements as well as to minimize the yawing moment due to asymmetric thrust in the event of an engine failure. These helicoidal vortices' areas of influence are a result of said aircraft design convention as well as the helicoidal vortex sheets having a much lower vortex strength and filament density than the wing wake. The regions of the wing wake dominated by upwash induced velocities are outboard of an average value of 40 % of the wingspan, measured from the fuselage symmetry plane. It is this region in which the drag reduction, fuel saving benefits of extended formation flight are harnessed. Therefore, as a result of aircraft engine mounting convention and marginal outboard drift of the helicoidal vortices, the turboprops' helicoidal vortices have minimal to negligible effect on the 10 % wing overlap outboard-most region that sees positive fuel savings of 10 % to 16 % for previous extended formation flight investigations...|$|E

It was observed that the actuation is able to delay the separation over the NACA 0015 finite wing model up to α = 20 °. For all the Cμ values tested, the synthetic jet excitation is effective at F+ = 1, 2. 8, and 13. 9 at α = 16 °, but only at F+ = 13. 9 at α = 20 °. At α = 16 °, the Cp suction peak under the synthetic jet excitation at F+ = 1, 2. 8, and 13. 9 all gradually reduce from Cp ≅ - 4 at in the inboard area to about Cp ≅ - 3 near the wingtip, about 25 % reduction. The situation is similar for F+ = 13. 9 at α = 20 ° except at 2 y/b = 0. 30, the most <b>inboard</b> testing <b>position,</b> where the excitation shows almost no effect. The surprising result is that slit is not the only actuation influencing the flow. For F+ from 1 to 2. 8, the synthetic jet is indeed the most effective configuration and is successful in causing flow attachment as seen in previous experiments. For F+= 13. 9, however, the flow is successfully attached with the model vibration caused by the actuators alone without the slit at 16 °. At 20 °, this configuration was not successful in delaying separation...|$|R
40|$|Far {{side impact}} trauma has been {{demonstrated}} as {{a significant portion of}} the total trauma in side impacts. The objective of the study was to assess the potential usefulness of countermeasures and assess the trade-offs associated with generic countermeasure design. Because the WorldSID dummy has demonstrated promise as a potential far side impact dummy, it was chosen to assess countermeasures in this mode. A unique far side impact buck was designed for a sled test system that included, as a standard configuration, a center console and outboard three-point belt system. This configuration assumed a left side driver with a right side impact. The buck allowed for additional options of generic restraints including shoulder or thorax plates or an inboard shoulder belt. The entire buck could be mounted on the sled in either a 90 -degree (3 -o’clock PDOF) or a 60 -degree (2 -o’clock PDOF) orientation. A total of 19 WorldSID tests were completed. The inboard shoulder belt configuration produced high shear forces in the lower neck (2430 N) when the belt position was placed over the mid portion of the neck. Shear forces were reduced and of opposite sign when the <b>inboard</b> belt <b>position</b> was horizontal and over the shoulder; forces were similar to the standard outboard belt configuration (830 – 1100 N). A shoulder or thorax restraint was effective in limiting the head excursion, but each caused significant displacement at the corresponding region on the dummy. A shoulder restraint resulted in shoulder displacements of 30 – 43 mm. A thorax restraint caused thorax deflections of 39 – 64 mm. Inboard restraints for far side impacts can be effective in reducing head excursion but the specific design and placement of these restraints determine their overall injury mitigating characteristics...|$|R
40|$|Traffic related {{trauma is}} {{the most common cause of}} {{fatality}} and severe injury to children in developed countries. The majority of these fatalities and injuries are caused by frontal and side impacts. Researchers agree that the head {{is the most}} important body region to protect for all ages of children, while the thorax is equally important for older children. Injury epidemiology has shown that special attention is needed for the 3 -year-olds in boosters and the 12 -year-olds in seat belts only. The aim of this thesis is to develop mathematical frontal and side impact models and to use them to investigate and define the beneficial characteristics of restraint systems and other crash-related car parameters. It must be emphasized that children are better protected in rear-facing child restraints; they should remain rear-facing for as long as possible. Most children have outgrown the large rear-facing restraints by the age of about 4 years. This work concentrates on injury mitigation for those who have transited to forward-facing restraints. Models for two load cases were developed and validated. One of them was a frontal impact type, and the other was a near-side impact type. The frontal model was used both for a parameter study, to define beneficial restraint system characteristics for 3 -year-olds, and for reconstructing three crashes in order to evaluate the head kinematics of the occupant model. The characteristics of the side impact load case were defined by analyzing real life crashes involving child occupants. The near-side impact model was used for a parameter study to define beneficial restraint system characteristics for 3 - and 12 -year-olds. It was also used to evaluate and propose improvements to the restraint systems within a range of common sitting positions for 12 -year-olds. The validations carried out here showed that the models developed were suitable tools for conducting comparative studies of injury mitigation systems in both frontal and near-side impacts. The parameter studies showed that several of the restraint systems for adults also reduced the values measured by the child model. In the near-side impact, a curtain airbag, a thorax-pelvis airbag and a seat belt with a pretensioner reduced the head and chest injury measures of the two occupant models. To help mitigate injuries resulting from a frontal impact, the upper belt anchor point should be positioned so that the belt is routed near mid-shoulder (slightly toward the neck) and encloses the shoulder (tight fit). The lap belt anchor points should be positioned to make the lap belt angle as horizontal as possible without inducing submarining. Seat belts with pretensioners and load limiters also reduced the head injury measures for the 3 -year-old occupant model. In side impacts, the results of the evaluation of common sitting positions suggested that extensive outboard, <b>inboard</b> and forward <b>positions</b> should be discouraged, while the restraint systems should be adapted to function with slight inboard, outboard and forward positions. This can be achieved with side supports integrated in the seat back, pre-impact (pre-brake) trigged seat belts, high performance full cell coverage curtain airbags, and/or thorax-pelvis airbags with an extended cover area. These findings are significant contributions to the continuous work of mitigating traffic accident induced injuries and fatalities to children...|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{investigated}} {{the evolution of}} a high temperature, low pressure crustal block of the Late Cambrian to Silurian Famatinian orogeny in the Sierra de Quilmes mountain range of the Sierras Pampeanas, NW Argentina. The crustal block is bound by the El Pichao-Ovejería shear zone, of which the eastern strand, the El Pichao shear zone, is a focus for this thesis. The El Pichao shear zone contains a 1 km-thick ultramylonite at its base and thrusts the granulite facies Tolombón complex, onto the amphibolite facies Agua del Sapo complex. The aims of this project were (1) to characterise the structural and metamorphic evolution of the Tolombón complex and its significance for understanding the western margin of Gondwana during the Famatinian orogeny, and (2) to determine the processes that formed the thick ultramylonitic layer. Mapping in the Tolombón complex revealed that metamorphic zones increased from greenschist facies in the NE to granulite facies migmatites in the SW (chapter 2). Rocks are sheared with top-to-W or -NW thrust shear sense that intensifies near major thrust shear zones, which repeat metamorphic zones (chapters 2, 4). We determined that thrusting in the Tolombón complex began during peak metamorphism (chapter 2), between 485 and 465 Ma (U-Pb monazite, chapter 4). The kinematics remained the same as rocks were thrust to shallower structural levels and shearing localised to the amphibolite facies El Pichao shear zone (chapters 2 and 4). Major- and trace- element geochemistry revealed that the mylonitic rocks of the El Pichao shear zone define a geochemical field narrower than their protolith, suggesting that they underwent mixing and homogenisation during shearing and did not experience substantial alteration (chapter 2). Peak metamorphism in the footwall of the PSZ occurred between ~ 435 and 420 Ma (U-Pb monazite, chapter 4) suggesting that the Tolombón complex was thrust onto the Agua del Sapo complex prior to this time, coinciding with the activation of other mylonitic shear zones in the Sierras Pampeanas. We speculate that the heat flux during peak metamorphism in the Tolombón complex may be a result of contact metamorphism, increased rates of shallow convection in the asthenosphere, or inherited high geothermal gradients from an earlier period of shearing (chapter 4). We suggest that the Sierra de Quilmes may {{have been part of the}} Famatinian back-arc at this time, indicated by a shared high geothermal gradient and <b>position</b> <b>inboard</b> of the Famatinian magmatic arc (chapter 4). Pervasive shortening in the Sierra de Quilmes from early in the Famatinian orogeny suggests that the Famatinian back-arc was dominantly convergent and any period of extension was brief, concluding before peak metamorphism. Ultramylonites 1 km thick are rare and suggest the layer may have widened over time, perhaps a result of weakening of the host rock or hardening of the ultramylonite. These processes may be facilitated by water migration, so we used FTIR to measure the water content of mylonitic rocks (chapter 3). We found that water content decreased as strain increased, the opposite of previous studies. We speculate that water and heat diffusion out of the ultramylonitic layer caused the ultramylonite to harden and the neighbouring rocks to weaken (chapter 3). This caused shearing to refocus to the neighbouring rocks and widened the shear zone. Repetition of this cycle gradually built up the 1 km-thick layer of ultramylonite (chapter 3). The work presented in this thesis provides insight into strain localisation in shear zones and the role of water and heat diffusion in generating thick layers of ultramylonite. This work also demonstrates that the Sierra de Quilmes provides a unique insight into the tectono-metamorphic evolution of Famatinian back-arc, suggesting shortening was dominant during its development...|$|R
