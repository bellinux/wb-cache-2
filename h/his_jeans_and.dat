500|$|Crash {{served as}} a mascot for Sony Computer Entertainment from his {{creation}} until September 2000 when Universal Interactive Studios and Konami entered an agreement that would enable Konami to publish a Crash Bandicoot game (which would later become [...] ) for next-generation game systems, with Universal Interactive handling {{the production of the}} games; the agreement served to break the Crash Bandicoot franchise's exclusivity to Sony-produced consoles and effectively made Crash Bandicoot a mascot character for Universal rather than Sony. Crash's game model in Crash Bandicoot: The Wrath of Cortex was composed of approximately 1,800 polygons, which allowed an increase in detail compared to past models, including a more complex and realistic tuft of hair, a visible uvula, stitching on <b>his</b> <b>jeans</b> <b>and</b> shoes and a designer label on his pants.|$|E

In response Expo officials cut the power to the pavilion, ending the entire event.|$|R

'Say, I got something to be fresh about!' he says to me. And then he reaches into <b>his</b> <b>jeans</b> <b>and</b> hauls out the sparkler. 'What's that?' I says to him. 'It's an engagement ring,' he says to me. 'For you, if you'll wear it!' I came over so weak, I could have fell! And the next thing I know he's got it on my finger and--" [...] Celestine broke off modestly. [...] "Say, ain't it a beaut, honest!" [...] She gave herself over to contemplation once more. [...] "He says to me how he's on Easy Street now, or will be pretty soon. I says to him 'Have you got a job, then?' He says to me 'Now, I ain't got a job, but I'm going to pull off a stunt to-night that's going to mean enough to me to start that health-farm I've told you about.' Say, he's always had a line of talk about starting a health-farm down on Long Island, he knowing all about training and health and everything through having been one of them fighters. I asks him what the stunt is, but he won't tell me yet. He says he'll tell me after we're married, but he says it's sure-fire and he's going to buy the license tomorrow." ...|$|E

Buckle said she smiled back, but another woman in the group responded by mocking <b>his</b> <b>jeans</b> <b>and</b> sneakers as [...] "cheap." [...] Buckle says he responded to the insult in kind and an argument ensued, whereupon one woman slapped him and another spat on him. Buckle says he spat back, then he was attacked by the group, clawed and ultimately severely cut on the abdomen.|$|E

25|$|Several {{recurring}} themes {{can be seen}} within Anger's cinematic work. One of {{the most}} notable of these is homoeroticism; this was first seen in Fireworks (1947), which was based around Anger's own homosexual awakening, and featured various navy officers flexing their muscles, and a white liquid (often thought of as symbolising semen), pouring over the protagonist's body. Similar homoerotic imagery is found in Scorpio Rising (1963), which stars a muscled, topless, leather-clad biker, and Kustom Kar Kommandos (1965), where a young man sensually polishes a car, with close up shots of <b>his</b> tight-fitting <b>jeans</b> <b>and</b> crotch. Images of naked men also appear in Invocation of My Demon Brother (1969), where they are eventually filmed wrestling, and in Anger Sees Red (2004), in which a muscled, topless man performs press-ups.|$|R
25|$|The first {{murder for}} which Bonin was charged {{was that of}} a 13-year-old {{hitchhiker}} named Thomas Glen Lundgren. Lundgren was last seen leaving his parents' house in Reseda at 10:50a.m. on the morning of May 28, 1979: his body, clad only in a T-shirt, shoes and socks, was found the same afternoon in Agoura. An autopsy revealed that Lundgren had suffered emasculation and bludgeoning to his face and head, with his skull sustaining multiple fractures. In addition, the youth had been slashed across the throat, extensively stabbed, and strangled to death. <b>His</b> underwear, <b>jeans,</b> <b>and</b> severed genitals were discovered strewn in a field close to his body. In the abduction and murder of Lundgren, Bonin was assisted by Vernon Butts, who is suspected of accompanying or assisting Bonin on at least eight further murders attributed to the Freeway Killer.|$|R

One day, Mike was fixing a pipe that broke in Jen's office. He ripped <b>his</b> <b>jeans,</b> <b>and</b> Jennifer decided that she would make a design out of them. With Mike as her inspiration, she decided to start her own design company called [...] "Street Jeans". Mike and Jen started {{spending}} time together as he was modeling her clothes. They decided to embark on a relationship but when Mike's ex-girlfriend, Katie Peretti, came back into town, it was obvious that Katie and Mike still had feelings for one another.|$|E

[...] While trying to disguise that he has seen the sponges, he tells her his secret about <b>his</b> <b>jeans</b> <b>and</b> she dumps him - she figures he is not [...] "sponge-worthy". Later at the AIDS Walk, Jerry and George see Kramer (disheveled after getting attacked by the [...] "ribbon bullies") stumble across the finishing line; Jerry, however, assumes this was because Kramer had exhausted himself (from running up several flights of stairs and having a poker game the night before the Walk). George then asks Kramer where his ribbon is, causing Kramer to look up at him in despair.|$|E
5000|$|Vyvyan, often {{referred}} to as [...] "Vyv", is a psychopathic punk medical student. He has spiked red hair and four metal stars seemingly embedded into his forehead. He wears a denim waistcoat over a black T-shirt, a black studded belt across <b>his</b> denim <b>jeans</b> <b>and</b> bovver boots. In the episode [...] "Interesting", he drinks a pint of blue liquid which makes his hair fall out and the number 666 is visible {{on the side of his}} head. He is extremely violent and regularly attacks Neil and Rick with pieces of wood, cricket bats, other large objects or simply his fists. For some reason he looks up to Mike, whom he never attacks and often addresses as [...] "Michael". He despises Rick more than he does Neil; for example when Rick, Mike and Neil meet his mother at a bar in the episode [...] "Boring", he calls both Neil and Mike his friends, but refers to Rick as [...] "a complete bastard." [...] Ironically, this antagonistic relationship between Rick and Vyvyan makes them virtually inseparable, as the two spend by far more time together than with the other housemates, albeit this time is spent fighting.|$|R
60|$|And {{turning about}} {{he found himself}} {{face to face with}} a {{handsome}} sunburnt youth, somewhat fatted, arrayed in the finest of fine raiment, and sporting about a sovereign's worth of flowers in his button-hole. Norris had met him during his first days in Sydney at a farewell supper; had even escorted him on board a schooner full of cockroaches and black-boy sailors, in which he was bound for six months among the islands; and had kept him ever since in entertained remembrance. Tom Hadden (known to the bulk of Sydney folk as Tommy) was heir to a considerable property, which a prophetic father had placed in the hands of rigorous trustees. The income supported Mr. Hadden in splendour for about three months out of twelve; the rest of the year he passed in retreat among the islands. He was now about a week returned from his eclipse, pervading Sydney in hansom cabs and airing the first bloom of six new suits of clothes; and yet the unaffected creature hailed Carthew in <b>his</b> working <b>jeans</b> <b>and</b> with the damning bundle on his shoulder, as he might have claimed acquaintance with a duke.|$|R
5000|$|Stone [...] "has a {{reputation}} for sartorial elegance" [...] and does not wear socks, a fact that Nancy Reagan brought to her husband's attention during his 1980 presidential campaign. Labash described him as: [...] "a dandy by disposition who boasts of having not bought off-the-rack since he was 17" [...] who has [...] "taught reporters how to achieve perfect double-dimples underneath their tie knots." [...] Washington journalist Victor Gold has noted Stone's {{reputation as one of}} the [...] "smartest dressers" [...] in Washington. Stone's longtime tailor is Alan Flusser. Stone dislikes single-vent jackets (describing them as the sign of a [...] "heathen"); says he owns 100 silver-colored neckties; and has 100 suits in storage. Fashion stories have been written about him in GQ and Penthouse. Stone has written of <b>his</b> dislike for <b>jeans</b> <b>and</b> ascots and has praised seersucker three-piece suits, as well as Madras jackets in the summertime and velvet blazers in the winter.|$|R
50|$|In {{the climax}} of the story Jack realises he has one bullet left in his gun to kill the last three terrorists with â€” Maggie, Megan and Tim. Jack {{cautiously}} sneaks up on Megan and Maggie, turns and fires Maggie's gun in her hands at Megan. As Jack and Maggie fall to the ground he manages to shoot her gun at her. Jack quickly moves to find Moira but discovers her with a gun pointed to her head in the hand of Tim McGinnis. McGinnis tells Jack to drop his weapon. Jack drops Maggie's gun to the ground and tries to persuade McGinnis to cut a deal and let her go.

The tweets {{selected for}} the segment are invariably abusive, vulgar or rude, often objecting to the celebrity's physical appearance or perceived lack of talent. In many cases, the celebrity is then afforded {{the opportunity for a}} brief response to the mean tweet. The show has also aired several themed editions of [...] "Mean Tweets," [...] including special NBA, NFL, college football and music editions. In March 2015, President Barack Obama took part in a [...] "President Obama edition" [...] of [...] "Mean Tweets," [...] during which he read tweets from people mocking <b>his</b> <b>jeans</b> <b>and</b> blaming him for the high price of beer.

50|$|His {{next major}} {{appearance}} was in 1998's Street Fighter Alpha 3, being the fourth Final Fight character {{to appear in}} the Alpha sub-series. In this game, Cody had ended his relationship with Jessica (who has since left Metro City to study abroad in Europe) and became a convicted felon, having been thrown into jail after becoming a vigilante. Bored with his peaceful life, Cody had wandered the streets looking for any riffraff he could find, and subsequently beat them into submission until he was finally caught and jailed. Instead of <b>his</b> <b>jeans</b> <b>and</b> white T-shirt from Final Fight, Cody's wardrobe now consists of a blue-and-white striped prison uniform with handcuffs on his wrists (which he is actually able to remove when he taunts his opponent, but fights wearing them anyway) and stubble on his face. His fighting style in the game is modeled after his abilities from Final Fight. During his single-player storyline, Cody is challenged by Birdie and ends up joining forces with his friend and former ally Guy in his fight against M. Bison.|$|E

2500|$|Driscoll is {{an evangelical}} Christian. Within that broad movement, he is theologically and {{socially}} conservative. On the Bible, he is a literalist and inerrantist. Driscoll's theology draws inspiration from historical theologians, including St. Augustine, John Calvin, and Martin Luther, {{along with the}} Puritans, Jonathan Edwards, and Charles Spurgeon. He also respects evangelical leaders such as Billy Graham, J. I. Packer, Francis Schaeffer, and John Stott. His contemporary influences include Lesslie Newbigin and the group he terms the [...] "Missional Reformed Evangelicals": Don Carson and John Piper for theology, and Tim Keller and Ed Stetzer for missiology. Driscoll's combination of theological conservatism and his [...] "missional" [...] embrace of contemporary culture contribute to controversies. Molly Worthen wrote: [...] "Conservatives call Driscoll 'the cussing pastor' and wish that he'd trade in <b>his</b> fashionably distressed <b>jeans</b> <b>and</b> taste for indie rock for {{a suit and tie}} and placid choral arrangements. Liberals wince at his hellfire theology and insistence that women submit to their husbands." ...|$|R
50|$|Arashi is {{a student}} of Yazagaku {{with a taste for}} punk style and {{alternative}} music. With <b>his</b> distressed <b>jeans</b> <b>and</b> safety pin piercings, Yukari flees when he tries to scout her in the streets of Tokyo. George enjoys harassing the serious-minded punk. Miwako reassures her that though Arashi looks intimidating, he is very kind. He is Miwako's childhood friend turned boyfriend, and this was the cause of the split in friendship between Miwako and Hiroyuki, having told Miwako that she could no longer see him anymore. Arashi despises being compared to Hiroyuki for any reason as he secretly believes himself to be inferior to the clean-cut prodigy. He even breaks Miwako's phone when he realizes she is texting Hiroyuki. By the end of the manga, Hiroyuki and Miwako help him to get over his inferiority complex, and the three childhood friends attend a New Year's celebration together. When the members of ParaKiss engage in outrageous behavior, Arashi is usually the voice of reason. He is the one that talks most directly to Yukari about her decision to drop out of school. He is the son of a musician, Risa Kanzaki, who is a good friend of Mikako Kouda. (Both characters appear in Gokinjo Monogatari.) Arashi and Miwako eventually marry and have a daughter who looks much like Arashi (whom Hiroyuki believes would look cuter if she had looked like Miwako instead).|$|R

However, he would play his prized heavy metal records very loudly at any time of the day or night and take LSD with casual indifference. Hurley attempted to calm Friday down by moving him into an apartment above the football club's elderly ex-groundsman, but to no avail: [...] "Even if it was three in the morning, the first thing would be to get the music playing", Simmonds later said. [...] "We had an old boy living below us ... the ex-groundsman at Reading. He was coming up to 80 and he had a dog's life in the flat.

When the tour concluded with ten shows at New York's Madison Square Garden, on several days Weinberg taped the Conan show at Rockefeller Center in the late afternoon, put his hands in ice and changed from <b>his</b> suit into <b>jeans</b> <b>and</b> a vest, and played with Springsteen at night.

In 1971 Ralph Lauren opened a boutique {{for both men and}} women in Beverly Hills. His aristocratic style at prices the average American could afford created a sensation.
