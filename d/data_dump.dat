25|$|On 25 June 2011, LulzSec {{released}} {{what they}} described as their last <b>data</b> <b>dump.</b> The release contained {{an enormous amount}} of information from various sources. The files contained a half gigabyte of internal information from telecommunication company AT, including information relating to its release of 4G LTE and details pertaining to over 90,000 personal phones used by IBM. The IP addresses of several large corporations including Sony, Viacom, and Disney, EMI, and NBC Universal were included. It also contained over 750,000 username and password combinations from several websites, including 200,000 email addresses, usernames, and encrypted passwords from hackforums.net; 12,000 names, usernames, and passwords of the NATO online bookshop; half a million usernames and encrypted passwords of players of the online game Battlefield Heroes; 50,000 usernames, email addresses, and encrypted passwords of various video game forum users; and 29 users of Priority Investigations, an Irish private investigation company. Also included were an internal manual for AOL engineering staff and a screencapture of a vandalized page from navy.mil, the website of the United States Navy. Members of the group continued the operation with members of Anonymous after disbanding.|$|E

We used <b>data</b> <b>dumps</b> of fourteen projects from the FLOSSMetrics (FM) retrieval system. Our intentions are (i) to present a possible methodology, its advantages and disadvantages which can benefit future researchers using {{some aspects of the}} FM retrieval system’s <b>data</b> <b>dumps,</b> and (ii) discuss our initial research results on the contributions developers make to both coding and lists activities...|$|R

50|$|All M1 models include 2 slots for {{expansion}} - one for sample ROMs {{and the other}} for patch/combi ROMs or RAM cards for saving sounds or sequences. Korg offered the MCR-02 128 Kilobit card and the MCR-03 256 Kilobit card for around $80-$150 list, as well as the four-bank MCR-04 MegaRam card with a capacity of 1 Megabit (128 kilobytes). These cards and the M1's internal memory all use 3V lithium cells which last ~5 years without needing to be replaced (CR2032 in the M1, and CR2016 in the memory cards). If the battery dies, sounds and sequences are lost. Factory Programs and Combinations are not stored in ROM, so the loss of battery power in the keyboard necessitates a <b>data</b> <b>dump</b> from a RAM card, a Factory Preload card, or a MIDI sysex <b>data</b> <b>dump</b> to restore the factory patches.|$|E

2500|$|University of North Carolina Professor Zeynep Tufekci has criticised Wikileaks for exposing {{sensitive}} personal information: [...] "WikiLeaks, for example, gleefully tweeted to its {{millions of}} followers that a Clinton Foundation employee had attempted suicide... <b>Data</b> <b>dumps</b> by WikiLeaks have outed rape victims and gay people in Saudi Arabia, private citizens' emails and personal information in Turkey, {{and the voice}} mail messages of Democratic National Committee staff members." [...] She argues these <b>data</b> <b>dumps</b> which violate personal privacy without being {{in the public interest}} [...] "threaten our ability to dissent by destroying privacy and unleashing a glut of questionable information that functions, somewhat unexpectedly, as its own form of censorship, rather than as a way to illuminate the maneuverings of the powerful." ...|$|R
50|$|HackBB was a Tor hidden service Internet forum {{specializing in}} buying stolen credit cards, {{skimming}} ATMs, and hacking computers, servers and accounts.

40|$|In recent years, GITHUB {{has become}} the largest code host in the world, with more than 5 M {{developers}} collaborating across 10 M repositories. Numerous popular open source projects (such as Ruby on Rails, Homebrew, Bootstrap, Django or jQuery) have chosen GITHUB as their host and have migrated their code base to it. GITHUB offers a tremendous research potential. For instance, it is a flagship for current open source development, a place for develop-ers to showcase their expertise to peers or potential recruiters, and the platform where social coding features or pull requests emerged. However, GITHUB data is, to date, largely underexplored. To facil-itate studies of GITHUB, we have created GHTorrent, a scalable, queriable, offline mirror of the data offered through the GITHUB REST API. In this paper we present a novel feature of GHTorrent designed to offer customisable <b>data</b> <b>dumps</b> on demand. The new GHTorrent data-on-demand service offers users the possibility to request via a web form up-to-date GHTorrent <b>data</b> <b>dumps</b> for any collection of GITHUB repositories. We hope that by offering cus-tomisable GHTorrent <b>data</b> <b>dumps</b> we will not only lower the “bar-rier for entry ” even further for researchers interested in mining GITHUB data (thus encourage researchers to intensify their min-ing efforts), but also enhance the replicability of GITHUB studies (since {{a snapshot of the}} data on which the results were obtained can now easily accompany each study) ...|$|R

50|$|In 2016, Wikileaks {{released}} {{thousands of}} emails in a <b>data</b> <b>dump</b> {{which came to}} be known as the Podesta emails. In one exchange, between Tanden and Podesta, while discussing Lawrence Lessig's bid for the Democratic nomination, she insulted Lessig. In turn, Lessig responded that while he supported whistle blowing and the pardon of Edward Snowden, Tanden should not have to be burdened with having her private emails scrutinized and that it was not in the public interest.|$|E
5000|$|Yet {{like many}} app {{competitions}} driven by government data, {{many of the}} winning apps have not developed into viable companies. One challenge that civic hacking competitions face is that “they rely on programmers to define problems, instead of citizens or even government itself.” [...] Hana Schank wrote of the 2011 contest that “the problem with the 2011 BigApps contest is that it leaves both user needs and likely user behavior out of the equation, instead beginning with an enormous <b>data</b> <b>dump</b> and asking developers to make something cool out of it”.|$|E

5000|$|In 2006, Prima Games {{undertook}} {{an effort}} to revolutionize the quality of MMORPG strategy guides. Historically those had largely consisted of charts of data, maps and basic instructions. What they were lacking was expert strategy content. Prima engaged the online gaming community known as The Syndicate (www.LLTS.org) who was very large, well known and well connected with developers. [...] That partnership resulted in a shift in how strategy guides were written. They began to be less of a <b>data</b> <b>dump</b> {{and more of a}} deep strategy. Examples of this {{can be seen in the}} LOTRO, Pirates of the Burning Seas, Vanguard, Warhammer Online and other similar guides from 2006 through 2009.|$|E
5000|$|The first {{releases}} {{were made}} {{to be used with}} the Cobra BlackFin dongle for the PlayStation Vita handheld, using the [...]psv (BlackFin) format for its <b>data</b> <b>dump.</b> After the release of the Vitamin dumper in August 2016 following the HENkaku homebrew enabler, there weren't many new releases immediately after because of issues with this new tool. A couple of weeks later the first ruleset was signed by 4 groups. The best tool to make a copy of the game cartridge data at that moment was MaiDumpTool in combination with Vitamin 2.0 when needed. The file format used for these newer dumps is [...]vpk: a ZIP containing the decrypted files of the game folder.|$|E
5000|$|Garbage {{operated}} a [...] "quiet stage" [...] by removing wedges, side-fills and live backline from their stage set-up. The absence of monitors meant zero stage volume - if the P.A. was {{switched off the}} only audible elements would be Manson's voice and the cymbals; and no monitor volume - instead, the band utilised Sennheiser IEMs to monitor their live sound. The use of digital technology in the band's in-ear mixes and F.O.H. mix meant that instead of a multitude of manual settings needing restored at each soundcheck, the band's FOH and monitor engineers only had to recall the last session from the previous night. Each performance was recorded in the DSD format by taking a <b>data</b> <b>dump</b> from the mixing console at 24-bit/48k and saving the wave file onto disc for future reference.|$|E
