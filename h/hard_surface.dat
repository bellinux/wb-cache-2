5|$|As {{their name}} suggests, bee-eaters {{predominantly}} eat flying insects, especially bees and wasps, which {{are caught in}} the air by flights from an open perch. The stinger is removed by repeatedly hitting and rubbing the insect on a <b>hard</b> <b>surface.</b> During this process, pressure is applied to the insect, thereby extracting most of the venom.|$|E
5|$|Among {{the types}} of insects {{consumed}} are many families of beetles, wasps and ants, flies (families Tabanidae and Asilidae), bugs, and caterpillars. Other invertebrates eaten include spiders, millipedes and earthworms. The flame robin consumes small prey items whole, and bashes larger victims against a <b>hard</b> <b>surface</b> repeatedly to break up before eating. The latter group constitute only 0.5% of prey over time—seasonally varying {{from a peak of}} 1.8% in autumn to a low of 0.2% of prey caught in winter.|$|E

5|$|A typical {{sea anemone}} {{is a single}} polyp {{attached}} to a <b>hard</b> <b>surface</b> by its base, but some species live in soft sediment and a few float near {{the surface of the}} water. The polyp has a columnar trunk topped by an oral disc with a ring of tentacles and a central mouth. The tentacles can be retracted inside the body cavity or expanded to catch passing prey. They are armed with cnidocytes (stinging cells). In many species, additional nourishment comes from a symbiotic relationship with single-celled dinoflagellates, zooxanthellae or with green algae, zoochlorellae, that live within the cells. Some species of sea anemone live in association with hermit crabs, small fish or other animals to their mutual benefit.|$|E
5|$|Planula larvae exhibit {{positive}} phototaxis, swimming towards {{light to}} reach surface waters, where they drift and grow before descending {{to seek a}} <b>hard</b> <b>surface</b> to which they can attach and begin a new colony. They also exhibit positive sonotaxis, moving towards sounds that emanate from the reef and away from open water. High failure rates afflict many stages of this process, and even though millions of gametes are released by each colony, few new colonies form. The time from spawning to settling is usually two to three days, but can be up to two months. The larva grows into a polyp and eventually becomes a coral head by asexual budding and growth.|$|E
5|$|The {{underside}} {{consists of}} a muscular foot, which has adapted to different purposes in different classes. The foot carries a pair of statocysts, which act as balance sensors. In gastropods, it secretes mucus as a lubricant to aid movement. In forms having only a top shell, such as limpets, the foot acts as a sucker attaching the animal to a <b>hard</b> <b>surface,</b> and the vertical muscles clamp the shell down over it; in other molluscs, the vertical muscles pull the foot and other exposed soft parts into the shell. In bivalves, the foot is adapted for burrowing into the sediment; in cephalopods it is used for jet propulsion, and the tentacles and arms are derived from the foot.|$|E

5|$|Construction of Stampesletta {{started in}} 1946 {{and the grass}} {{football}} field opened in 1949. A now removed equestrian exhibition area opened in 1958, and in 1973 the track and field venue opened. The latter received a <b>hard</b> <b>surface</b> in 1982. During the 1994 Winter Olympics, Stampesletta itself was used for medal ceremonies, attracting crowds of up to 30,000 people. The area around Stampesletta was {{sometimes referred to as}} the Olympic Park, as it also has in its immediate vicinity the ice hockey venues Håkons Hall and Kristins Hall, the ski jumping hill Lysgårdsbakken, and Kanthaugen Freestyle Arena. The two halls are often regarded as part of Stampesletta. The arena is used as the goal are for Birkebeinerrittet and Birkebeinerløpet, and from 1932 to 1992 for Birkebeinerrennet. Stampesletta hosted the Norwegian Athletics Championships in 1977, 1995 and 2009, and annually hosts Norway's second-largest track and field tournament, Veidekkelekene. Stampesletta is scheduled to host the opening and closing ceremonies of the 2016 Winter Youth Olympics.|$|E
5|$|Drumming {{is a form}} of non-vocal {{communication}} used by {{most species}} of woodpecker and involves the bill being repeatedly struck on a <b>hard</b> <b>surface</b> with great rapidity. After a pause, the drum roll is repeated, each species having a pattern which is unique in the number of beats in the roll, the length of the roll, the length of the gap between rolls and the cadence. The drumming is mainly a territorial call, equivalent to the song of a passerine, with male birds drumming more frequently than females. Woodpeckers choose a surface that resonates, such as a hollow tree, and may use man-made structures such as gutters and downpipes. Drumming serves for the mutual recognition of conspecifics and plays a part in courtship rituals. Individual birds are thought to be able to distinguish the drumming of their mates and that of their neighbours.|$|E
5|$|The {{paintings}} of the Italian Renaissance differed {{from those of the}} Northern Renaissance. Italian Renaissance artists {{were among the first to}} paint secular scenes, breaking away from the purely religious art of medieval painters. Northern Renaissance artists initially remained focused on religious subjects, such as the contemporary religious upheaval portrayed by Albrecht Dürer. Later, the works of Pieter Bruegel influenced artists to paint scenes of daily life rather than religious or classical themes. It was also during the Northern Renaissance that Flemish brothers Hubert and Jan van Eyck perfected the oil painting technique, which enabled artists to produce strong colors on a <b>hard</b> <b>surface</b> that could survive for centuries. A feature of the Northern Renaissance was its use of the vernacular in place of Latin or Greek, which allowed greater freedom of expression. This movement had started in Italy with the decisive influence of Dante Alighieri on the development of vernacular languages; in fact the focus on writing in Italian has neglected a major source of Florentine ideas expressed in Latin. The spread of the printing press technology boosted the Renaissance in Northern Europe as elsewhere, with Venice becoming a world center of printing.|$|E

The next year, the northern half of the Fannin County portion of the segment from Porter Springs to Morganton was <b>hard</b> <b>surfaced.</b> In 1954, the southern half was <b>hard</b> <b>surfaced.</b> The next year, the unnumbered road south-southeast of Gainesville was extended to SR 124 east of Braselton. By 1957, SR 60 was extended south-southwest on US 19/SR 9 to Dahlonega, then south-southeast to Gainesville, replacing all of SR 249 and parts of SR 115 and SR 136. Between 1957 and 1960, SR 60 was extended south-southeast to SR 124 east of Braselton.|$|R

5|$|The willie wagtail perches on low branches, fences, posts, and the like, {{watching}} for insects {{and other small}} invertebrates in the air or on the ground. It usually hunts by hawking flying insects such as gnats, flies, and small moths, but will occasionally glean from the ground. It will often hop along the ground and flit behind people and animals, such as cattle, sheep or horses, as they walk over grassed areas, to catch any creatures disturbed by their passing. It wags its tail in a horizontal fashion while foraging in this manner; the exact purpose of this behaviour is unknown but is thought to help flush out insects hidden in vegetation and hence make them easier to catch. The willie wagtail takes ticks from the skin of grazing animals such as cattle or pigs, even from lions asleep in a zoo. It kills its prey by bashing it against a <b>hard</b> <b>surface,</b> or holding it and pulling off the wings before extracting the edible insides.|$|E
5|$|Although {{some species}} of sea anemone burrow in soft sediment, the {{majority}} are mainly sessile, attaching to a <b>hard</b> <b>surface</b> with their pedal disc, and tend {{to stay in the}} same spot for weeks or months at a time. They can move however, being able to creep around on their bases; this gliding can be seen with time-lapse photography but the motion is so slow as to be almost imperceptible to the naked eye. The process resembles the locomotion of a gastropod mollusc, a wave of contraction moving from the functionally posterior portion of the foot towards the front edge, which detaches and moves forwards. Sea anemones can also cast themselves loose from the substrate and drift to a new location. Gonactinia prolifera is unusual in that it can both walk and swim; walking is by making a series of short, looping steps, rather like a caterpillar, attaching its tentacles to the substrate and drawing its base closer; swimming is done by rapid movements of the tentacles beating synchronously like oar strokes. Stomphia coccinea can swim by flexing its column, and the sea onion anemone inflates and casts itself loose, adopting a spherical shape and allowing itself to be rolled about by the waves and currents. There are no truly pelagic sea anemones, but some stages in the life cycle post-metamorphosis are able, in response to certain environmental factors, to cast themselves off and have a free-living stage that aids in their dispersal.|$|E

25|$|By {{the middle}} of 1930, SR20 was {{established}} from SR61 in Rydal to SR5 in Canton. The entire Rome–Cartersville and Buford–Lawrenceville segments had a completed <b>hard</b> <b>surface.</b> Also, SR53 was designated from the Alabama state line to Rome, farther to the north than SR20. Later that year, the portion of SR20 and SR53 west of Rome were swapped. By the beginning of 1932, US19 was shifted farther {{to the west and}} off of the current SR20 between Buford and Lawrenceville; at the same time, US23 was designated on this same segment. In January 1932, SR20 was established from Canton to Cumming. SR68, from Cumming to Buford, was decommissioned and redesignated as part of SR20. Also, since SR13 was shifted to a more western alignment, its segment from Buford to Lawrenceville was also redesignated as part of SR20. A few months later, SR20 was established from Loganville to Conyers. Nearly a year later, SR20 was established from Conyers to McDonough. The next month, {{the western part of the}} segment from the Alabama state line to Rome was under construction. Later that year, SR20 was designated along SR61 from Cartersville to Rydal, with the entire length having a sand clay or top soil surface. Also, a portion of the highway east of Canton was under construction. Before the year ended, US41W between Rome and Cartersville was redesignated as part of US411, which was also designated along SR20/SR61 from Cartersville to Rydal. At this time, the Rockdale County portion of the segment between Loganville and Conyers was under construction. By {{the middle of}} 1935, the western half of the Canton–Cumming segment was under construction. By October of that year, a small portion east of Canton had a sand clay or top soil surface. At the end of the year, a small portion north-northeast of Cartersville, as well as a small portion north-northeast of Conyers, had a completed <b>hard</b> <b>surface.</b> Later in 1936, the central portion of the SR20/SR61 segment, from Cartersville to Rydal, had completed grading, but was not surfaced. A few months later, a small portion south-southwest of Rydal had a completed <b>hard</b> <b>surface.</b> The entire Forsyth County portion of the Canton–Cumming segment, except for the eastern end, was under construction. Also, the entire Gwinnett County portion of the Cumming–Buford segment had completed grading, but was not surfaced. By the middle of the year, the central portion of SR20/SR61, from Cartersville to Rydal, had a completed <b>hard</b> <b>surface.</b> Also, the eastern three-fourths of the Canton–Cumming segment was under construction. A few months later, the western third of this segment had a completed <b>hard</b> <b>surface,</b> while the eastern third of it had completed grading, but was not surfaced. The northern half of the segment between Lawrenceville and Loganville, and nearly the entire northern half of the segment between Conyers and McDonough, also had completed grading, but was not surfaced. About two years later, US23 was shifted farther to the west and off of SR20's path. Also, a small portion northeast of Buford had a sand clay or top soil surface. Before the year ended, about half of the total length of the segment from the Alabama state line and Rome had a completed <b>hard</b> <b>surface.</b>|$|E
