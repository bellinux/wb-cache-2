500|$|Stephen Doig, a {{professor}} at Arizona State University, estimated that 1.1 millionpeople attended the inauguration ceremony using the same satellite image. Although the image was taken {{a little less than}} 45minutes before Obama's swearing-in ceremony, Doig adjusted his estimate to include people who were still arriving in the area before the event. In spite of his crowd estimate, Doig stated that [...] "if I had to bet, <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>say</b> <b>the</b> [...] Obama crowd is in fact bigger than those that showed up for [...] {{or any of the other}} things... I'm wholly prepared to think it was the largest crowd." [...] Approximately 1.2million people had attended the second inauguration of Lyndon B. Johnson in 1965.|$|E
500|$|LeMond grew {{up living}} an active, outdoor life. Hiking, hunting, skiing and flyfishing were boyhood pastimes. The ranch country [...] of the Sierra Nevada {{mountain}} range lent itself to such pursuits. A hyperactive youngster, LeMond believes these outdoor activities helped {{keep him out}} of trouble. [...] "I was a boy who just could not sit still. I had trouble focusing in school. Parents and educators then did not have the skill set to diagnose and cope with what we know now was a classic case of Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD). ADHD certainly was not the frequently medicated childhood disease it is today. My triumph over the symptoms was found atop two thin tires over many dusty miles." [...] Said LeMond: [...] "That's one of the traits. It's the inability to sit down [...] to something you are not really interested in and absorb it. If they are interested in it, people with ADD excel in really good ways. When I got into cycling <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>say</b> <b>the</b> sport itself took a fog off my brain. I was able to absorb stuff I read. It changed my life." ...|$|E
500|$|The Way of All Flesh was {{released}} on 13 October in Europe via Listenable Records and 14 October in North America through Prosthetic Records in 2008. On 25 July 2008, the band announced the track listing and revealed the final cover art for the record. Joe Duplantier stated about the album, [...] "This record is a lot darker — like, a lot darker, <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>say.</b> <b>The</b> music is darker and more violent." [...] Duplantier stated the album will be [...] "more intense, more brutal, and more melodic" [...] than its predecessor. [...] "That's the theme — it's about death itself," [...] he explained. [...] "It's also about the immortality of the soul. That's the main subject for us". Randy Blythe from the American band Lamb of God appeared as a guest vocalist on the song [...] "Adoration for None" [...] The album took four months to write and record, and three months to mix. On 17 March 2009, the band's first North American headlining tour was announced. The opening bands were The Chariot and Car Bomb. Gojira accompanied Metallica on their tour from 14 September to 18 October, performing before Lamb of God.|$|E

500|$|Paul Babeu, {{the sheriff}} of Pinal County, Arizona, {{appeared}} on The Political Cesspool on July 10, 2010 to discuss illegal immigration; during the interview, {{he referred to}} James Edwards as a [...] "great American". Less than two weeks later, Babeu's spokesman issued an apology, {{saying that he had}} not researched the show thoroughly enough before scheduling the interview and that Babeu has a policy of not conducting interviews with hate groups. Babeu himself said that he was [...] "hoodwinked" [...] into appearing on the show and that he rejects [...] "any hate or bigotry". Prior to the interview, cohost Eddie Miller said that [...] "Of all the people we’ve interviewed on this radio show, <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>say</b> <b>the</b> only people that came close to getting me this excited was Dr. David Duke." [...] Following Babeu's spokesman's apology, Edwards alleged that Babeu was aware of the show's true ideology prior to appearing on the show, saying: [...] "For Sheriff Babeu to change his mind and now regret coming on our show, for whatever reason, is his right. For him to act as though he had no idea of our ideology is a lie." [...] As a result of the controversy surrounding Babeu's appearance on the show, Arizona U.S. Senate candidate J. D. Hayworth asked his primary opponent, John McCain, to drop several campaign ads featuring McCain and Babeu. In 2011, another sheriff, Dennis Spruell of Montezuma County, Colorado, also apologized after appearing on the show without knowing its actual agenda.|$|E

If I might put it to you, <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>say</b> <b>the</b> principles of tariffs, the principle of railway connection, the principle of appeal in law, the principle of coinage, and in fact all those principles which exist at the present moment in the United States, irrespective of the local assemblies which exist in each separate state in that country." ...|$|E

My approach is to update it and make it feel modern and 2013. The pilot opens with a 4-5 minute sequence which I think is really harrowing and really dangerous, that would be something that you might have seen on Chicago Code or The Shield. I want it to feel grounded in that way. There'll be some opportunities for laughs after that. It's not a laughs come first show." ...|$|E
2500|$|On February 15, 2012, Korine {{contacted}} rapper Riff Raff about {{appearing in}} an upcoming film of his which {{would turn out to}} be Spring Breakers. Once the trailer was released there was speculation that the character Alien was based around Riff Raff. According to Franco, his character is based on the underground rap artist Dangeruss, who has a cameo in the film. [...] "Of course Harmony and I looked at some of Riff Raff's videos as inspiration, but he was one of a number of people we looked at. <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>say</b> <b>the</b> biggest influence on the role was this local Florida rapper named Dangeruss. He's fairly unknown, but he was down there in the place, living the life, and he became the biggest model for me, and he's in the movie." [...] After much back and forth between both camps about the issue, during July 2013 Riff Raff announced he was suing the creators of Spring Breakers for $10 million for [...] "sampling" [...] his life without his permission or a proper producer credit.|$|E

2500|$|Compared by {{many music}} critics to the Beach Boys' Pet Sounds {{because of its}} {{inclusion}} of harmonies and orchestrated sounds, The Soft Bulletin also featured greater use of synthesizers, drum machines, sound effects and more studio manipulation. After this album was released, Coyne stated that, [...] "if someone was to ask me what instrument do I play, <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>say</b> <b>the</b> recording studio." [...] As the band considered an attempt to recreate this complex album live solely with additional musicians to be complex and expensive, they decided to tour as a three-piece and make extensive use of pre-recorded music to fill out those parts that were not performed live {{by the members of}} the band. Perhaps most notably, this led to the decision to have the drummer Drozd play primarily keyboards and guitar live instead of the drums. This, in turn, led to a decision to utilize video recordings and projections of Steven playing the drums for some of the band's older songs, so the band added Kliph Scurlock on drums and percussion, Drozd focused on guitars, keyboards, bass (when he plays bass, Ivins plays keyboards), drums and occasional vocals, when he sings, Coyne plays guitars, keyboards and theremin.|$|E
2500|$|In {{addition}} to the many bridges that Steinman designed, he was consulted on several projects that his firm did not win. Perhaps {{the most famous of}} these bridges is [...] "Galloping Gertie," [...] the original Tacoma Narrows Bridge. Steinman consulted extensively with the boosters of the bridge during the 1920s, but his design was not selected. He wrote of his frustration with the design that was chosen, and predicted a failure. He presented his findings at the 1938 meeting of the structural division of the American Society of Civil Engineers. In the audience was the designer of the Tacoma Narrows Bridge, which was under construction at the time. The failure did occur and he wrote that it {{had a profound impact on}} his design principles; he became even more conservative. It is said that he designed the Mackinac Bridge to withstand winds of 365mph. It is considered by many to be his most significant work, although, perhaps not by Steinman himself, who expressed a personal preference for the St. Johns bridge, saying, [...] "If you asked me which of the bridges I love best, I believe <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>say</b> <b>the</b> St. Johns bridge. I put more of myself into that bridge than any other bridge." ...|$|E
