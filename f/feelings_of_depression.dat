5|$|The album's working {{title was}} {{originally}} announced as Magic's in the Makeup in May 1998 {{and later as}} Saturn Returns in November 1999. Stefani was confused by her <b>feelings</b> <b>of</b> <b>depression</b> and interest in Sylvia Plath while recording the album. Her boyfriend Gavin Rossdale {{told her that she}} was going through her Saturn return. Saturn's orbit takes 29.4 Earth years and, in astrology, the time when Saturn returns to its position during a person's birth is believed to be a period of self-evaluation. Stefani was born October 3, 1969, and many of the songs were written during her Saturn return.|$|E

25|$|Children {{raised in}} {{alcoholic}} families {{have the potential}} to suffer emotional distress as they move into their own committed relationships. These children are at a higher risk for divorce and separation, unstable marital conditions and fractured families. <b>Feelings</b> <b>of</b> <b>depression</b> and antisocial behaviors experienced in early childhood frequently contribute to marital conflict and domestic violence. Women are {{more likely than men to}} be victims of alcohol-related domestic violence.|$|E
25|$|Another {{treatment}} for both loneliness and depression is pet therapy, or animal-assisted therapy, {{as it is}} more formally known. Studies and surveys, as well as anecdotal evidence provided by volunteer and community organizations, indicate {{that the presence of}} animal companions such as dogs, cats, rabbits, and guinea pigs can ease <b>feelings</b> <b>of</b> <b>depression</b> and loneliness among some sufferers. Beyond the companionship the animal itself provides there may also be increased opportunities for socializing with other pet owners. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention {{there are a number of}} other health benefits associated with pet ownership, including lowered blood pressure and decreased levels of cholesterol and triglycerides.|$|E
25|$|<b>Feelings</b> <b>of</b> <b>depression</b> {{can cause}} a child to overeat. Researchers {{provided}} an in-home interview to 9,374 adolescents, in grades seven through 12 and discovered {{that there was not}} a direct correlation with children eating in response to depression. Of all the obese adolescents, 8.2% had said to be depressed, compared to 8.9% of the non-obese adolescents who said they were depressed. Antidepressants, however, seem to have very little influence on childhood obesity. Researchers provided a depression questionnaire to 487 overweight/obese subjects and found that 7% of those with low depression symptoms were using antidepressants and had an average BMI score of 44.3, 27% of those with moderate depression symptoms were using antidepressants and had an average BMI score of 44.7, and 31% of those with major depression symptoms were using antidepressants and had an average BMI score of 44.2.|$|E

2500|$|Chlordiazepoxide in {{laboratory}} mice studies impairs latent learning. [...] Benzodiazepines impair learning and memory via their action on benzodiazepine receptors, which causes a dysfunction in the cholinergic neuronal system in mice. It was later found that scopolamine impairment in learning {{was caused by}} an increase in benzodiazapine/GABA activity (and that benzodiazepines were not associated with the cholinergic system). In tests of various benzodiazepine compounds, chlordiazepoxide was found to cause the most profound reduction in the turnover of 5HT (serotonin) in rats. Serotonin is closely involved in regulating mood and {{may be one of the}} causes of <b>feelings</b> <b>of</b> <b>depression</b> in rats using chlordiazepoxide or other benzodiazepines.|$|E
2500|$|By April Mansfield's {{divorce from}} Bowden had been finalised, {{and she and}} Murry married, only to part again two weeks later. They came {{together}} again, however, and in March 1919 Murry became editor of Athenaeum, for which Mansfield wrote more than 100 book reviews, collected posthumously as Novels and Novelists. During the winter of 1918–19 she and Baker stayed in a villa in San Remo, Italy. Their relationship came under strain during this period, and after she wrote to Murry to express her <b>feelings</b> <b>of</b> <b>depression</b> he stayed over Christmas. Although her relationship with Murry became increasingly distant after 1918 and the two often lived apart, this intervention of his spurred her on, and she wrote [...] "The Man Without a Temperament", {{the story of an}} ill wife and her long-suffering husband. [...] Mansfield followed her first collection of short stories, Bliss (1920), with another collection The Garden Party, published in 1922.|$|E

2500|$|In Depression: A Public Feeling, Cvetkovich {{looks at}} “depression as a {{cultural}} and social phenomenon rather than a medical disease.” She interrogates the biological model of depression and suggests the significance of both cultural criticism and individual experience as alternative – and perhaps even more important – knowledges of depression. Situating her work {{in relation to the}} larger Public Feelings project, she links the private world of feelings to the public world of politics, associating depression with neoliberal capitalism. While Cvetkovich explores how <b>feelings</b> <b>of</b> <b>depression</b> “are produced by social forces,” she also emphasizes the ordinary and everyday aspects of depression and tries to capture “how it feels.” Thus, her work is influenced by Eve Sedgwick's argument for a reparative critical approach. Divided into two sections, Cvetkovich's book is part personal memoir and part critical essay. Drawing together these genres of writing, Cvetkovich's aim is to produce “a cultural analysis that can adequately represent depression as a historical category, a felt experience, and a point of entry into discussions not only about theory and contemporary culture but about how to live.” ...|$|E
2500|$|Collins later {{admitted}} having suffered from bulimia after she quit {{smoking in the}} 1970s. [...] "I went straight from the cigarettes into an eating disorder", she told People magazine in 1992. [...] "I started throwing up. I didn't know anything about bulimia, certainly not {{that it is an}} addiction or that it would get worse. My feelings about myself, even though I had been able to give up smoking and lose 20 lbs., were of increasing despair." [...] She has written at length of her years of addiction to alcohol, the damage it did to her personal and musical life and how it contributed to her <b>feelings</b> <b>of</b> <b>depression.</b> Collins admits that although she tried other drugs in the 1960s, alcohol had always been her drug of first choice, just as it had been for her father. She entered a rehabilitation program in Pennsylvania in 1978 and has maintained her sobriety ever since, even through such traumatic events as the death of her only child, Clark, who committed suicide in 1992 at age 33 after a long bout with clinical depression and substance abuse. Since his death, she has also become an activist for suicide prevention.|$|E
2500|$|The Visitacion Valley Community Resiliency Project (VVCRP) was {{reviewed}} {{by an independent}} evaluator hired by the Pottruck Foundation. [...] Her final report notes that [...] "Early program evaluation...found that the VVCRP was successful in reducing individuals’ <b>feelings</b> <b>of</b> <b>depression</b> and isolation, and increasing their sense of happiness and self-control. The cumulative evaluation research conducted on the VVCRP and the HR model in general concludes that HR is {{a powerful tool for}} changing individuals’ beliefs and behaviors." [...] In the Summary of Case Studies, the report goes on to state, [...] "The VVCRP was effective over a period of five years of sustained involvement in two major neighborhood institutions...at influencing not just individuals, but also organizational policies, practices, and culture. This level of organizational influence is impressive when the relatively modest level of VVCRP staff time and resources invested into making these changes is taken into account. The pivotal levers of change at each organization were individual leaders who were moved by the HR principles to make major changes in their own beliefs, attitudes, and behaviors, and then took the initiative to inspire, enable, and mandate similar changes within their organizations. This method of reaching [...] "critical mass" [...] of HR awareness within these organizations appears to be both efficient and effective when the leadership conditions are right. However, this pathway to change is vulnerable to the loss of the key individual leader." ...|$|E
50|$|In June 1999, {{the album}} Judgement was released, marking Anathema's {{complete}} {{shift from the}} doom metal genre, focusing instead on slower and more experimental songs. This new sound has been likened to artists such as Pink Floyd, Jeff Buckley, {{and to a lesser}} extent, Radiohead. However, the essence of the band remained the same. Their songs continued to express a <b>feeling</b> <b>of</b> <b>depression</b> and, more often than not, desperation.|$|R
50|$|When people overeat, {{their bodies}} have the {{tendency}} to chemically change, including metabolic shifts. There are also electrolyte imbalances due {{to the process of}} digestion that occur once the massive amounts of food have entered the body. This can also cause a <b>feeling</b> <b>of</b> <b>depression,</b> emotional attachment to food, fatigue, and also boredom. This is hypothesized to be partially due to dopamine and endorphin release after food consumption (especially spicy foods).|$|R
