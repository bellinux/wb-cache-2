25|$|Poirot {{begins his}} investigations. Having ascertained {{the name of}} Miss Carnaby's {{previous}} employer, Lady Hartingfield who died a year before, he visits her niece who confirms Lady Hoggin's view of Miss Carnaby's lack of intellect but essential good qualities, looking after an invalid sister and being good with dogs, {{so much so that}} Lady Hartingfield left her Pekingese to her. Poirot interviews the park keeper who remembers the incident of the kidnap. He then investigates the address where the ransom money was sent to and finds it is a cheap hotel where letters are often left for non-residents. His third visit is to the wife of the man <b>Hoggin</b> met at his club who gives a very similar story to that told by Lady <b>Hoggin</b> as to the method of kidnap and ransom demand. His last visit is back to Sir Joseph to report on progress where he observes that Sir Joseph's relationship with his blond secretary is not exactly on a professional level.|$|E
25|$|Poirot sends his valet out {{investigating}} {{and finds}} an address which confirms Poirot's suspicions {{of where it}} would be and what he would find there. Poirot visits it and finds Miss Carnaby, her invalid sister, Emily and a Pekingese dog, Augustus. They are part of a scam run by women who are companions to rich and ungrateful ladies. These women are poorly paid, without talent and will be cast adrift when they get older. The dog that is taken out for a walk is their own, Augustus, who is let off his lead and is able to find {{his way back to the}} sister's flat unaided, thus providing witnesses to the 'crime'. The 'subject' of the kidnap is held at the sister's flat and their owner told of the ransom. Quite often it is the companion who is sent out with the envelope of pound notes which goes into a general pool for all the companions involved in the scheme. Miss Carnaby feels guilty for her crime but excuses it on the basis of the way they are treated by their employers – only the other day Lady <b>Hoggin</b> accused her of tampering with her tonic as it tasted unpleasant. Poirot tells them their activities must stop and that the money must be returned to Lady <b>Hoggin</b> although he is sure that he will be able to persuade her husband not to involve the police.|$|E
25|$|Poirot meets Sir Joseph {{and offers}} two alternatives: prosecute the {{criminal}} (whom he doesn't name), {{in which case}} he will lose his money, or just {{take the money and}} call the case closed. The greedy Sir Joseph agrees to the latter option and takes Poirot's cheque. The detective turns the conversation round to murder cases and tells a rattled Sir Joseph that he reminds him of a Belgian murderer who poisoned his wife to marry his secretary. Poirot's meaning is quite clear and the shaken man gives Poirot his cheque back, telling him to keep the money. Poirot sends it back to the Misses Carnaby, telling them that it is the final contribution to their fund before it is wound up. Meanwhile, Lady <b>Hoggin</b> tells her relieved husband that her tonic no longer tastes so bitter.|$|E

Poirot meets <b>Hoggin,</b> who tells him the dog was taken a week ago but {{returned}} for a ransom of two hundred pounds. <b>Hoggin</b> would have left the matter there but {{for the fact that the}} same thing had happened to an acquaintance at his club. Poirot meets the petulant Lady <b>Hoggin</b> and her put-upon companion, Miss Amy Carnaby, who is clearly frightened of her employer. Miss Carnaby took the yapping dog, Shan-Tung (described by Poirot as [...] "a veritable lion"), for his walk in the park and she stopped to admire a baby in the pram. When she looked down, someone had cut the dog's lead and it had been taken. A ransom note said to leave the money in notes in an envelope for a Captain Curtis at an address in Bloomsbury.|$|E

The Honourable <b>Hoggin</b> Armer, who was lately travelling in the East, wore about his stomach two brace of pistols, of such exquisite finish and make, that a Sheikh, in the Jericho country, robbed him merely {{for the sake of}} the pistols.

The contractors Alaska designed and built an experimental light railway from a forest track to the cutting. By this they reduced the compaction of the soil of the forest by eliminating heavy dumper movements. This allowed work to continue even in wet weather. It also resulted in lower fuel consumption and less noise and pollution. The project cost of £214,500 included plant hire and labour (£106,500) and infill materials (£108,000).|$|E

50|$|<b>Hoggin</b> is a {{compactable}} groundcover that {{is composed}} of a mixture of clay, gravel, and sand or granite dust that produces a buff-coloured bound surface. It is more commonly seen {{in the south of}} England and at National Trust properties. The material is aesthetically suited to older properties and is lower maintenance than gravel alone since it does not need regular raking. Once laid, the surface is somewhat permeable to water and therefore does not easily hold puddles or generate rapid surface runoff. The material is increasingly being used at domestic properties as a low cost and environmentally friendly alternative to concrete and block paving in paths and driveways.|$|E

Surprisingly, much of the course of the original, pre-1850s, stream could still be seen on the ground. The aim of the works was to reinstate the original stream as closely as possible, whilst filling in the Cutting. It was necessary to bring in 10,000 tonnes of <b>hoggin</b> to fill in the cutting, plus some clay to make plugs to ensure that water followed the desired course.|$|E

In the field of nano technologies researchers are enthusiastic about its potential applications in fields such as energy, medicine, electronics, computing and materials. Of late, one of the emerging aspects dealing Nanotechnology in mechanical field is the internal combustion engine on a nano scale, which we have chosen as our area of interest.

The game's expanded environments were well received, with Edge noting they encouraged the player to think more tactically and improvise. Tom Francis of PC Gamer and <b>Hoggins</b> felt that Infinites overall combat was an improvement over the previous BioShock games largely due to the dynamism of the expanded environments.
