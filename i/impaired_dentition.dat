40|$|Background Few {{have studied}} the {{association}} between chewing ability and longevity. Design and methods In this prospective study, we analyzed 697 80 -year-old participants residing in Fukuoka Prefecture, Japan. Chewing ability was assessed {{on the basis of}} the types of food that each participant reported being able to chew. Results During follow-up, 108 participants died. Patients reporting the lowest numbers of chewable foods were associated with higher risks of cardiovascular mortality than those who were able to chew all the types of food surveyed (multivariate hazard ratio: 4. 60; 95 % confidence interval: 1. 01 – 21. 1). Conclusions <b>Impaired</b> <b>dentition</b> status with poor masticatory ability was an independent risk factor for cardiovascular mortality in active elderly individuals.

40|$|Study {{aimed to}} {{identify}} diagnoses and plan outcomes and interventions {{based on the}} CIPE® nomenclature and on the theory of adaptation to hypertensive patients with associated diseases. It is a multiple case study conducted with 45 users of the Family Health Strategy and registered in HIPERDIA. The most frequent diagnoses identified were partial self-care (93. 3 %), decreased exercise pattern (84. 4 %), <b>impaired</b> <b>dentition</b> (82. 2 %), and low learning process (60 %). Outcomes and interventions aimed at improving adherence to treatment {{and quality of life}} were planned for these diagnoses. The results of this study highlight the need for care of hypertensives with complications, supporting a theoretical foundation and practice of nursing care through the development of statements of diagnoses, outcomes, and interventions. doi: 10. 5216 /ree. v 16 i 4. 22945...|$|E
