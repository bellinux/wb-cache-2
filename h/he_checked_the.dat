5|$|McCudden set {{out across}} the English Channel. Unsure of the dispositions on the ground after the German advance <b>he</b> <b>checked</b> <b>the</b> {{airfield}} he suspected to be Boffles but found it empty. Flying in heavy mist he decided to head to Auxi-le-Château, France, to get directions from the RAF personnel stationed there. He approached Corporal W.H. Burdett and L. E Vallins of 52 Squadron. Burdett had served with McCudden in 3 Squadron back in 1915. Burdett did not recognise him in his flying gear. They marked his map and McCudden returned to his machine. Around 90 seconds after takeoff from Auxi-le-Château, the S.E.5a plunged into the ground. 8 Squadron's Corporal W.H. Howard was on the scene within minutes and fought through the fire to free McCudden who was lying {{next to one of}} the wings—he had not worn his safety belt. Burdett followed and recognised the pilot as soon as his headgear had been removed. He was taken to No. 21 Casualty clearing station and diagnosed with a fractured skull. He did not regain consciousness and died at 20:00.|$|E

25|$|When Jerome {{undertook}} {{the revision}} of the Old Latin translations of the Septuagint, <b>he</b> <b>checked</b> <b>the</b> Septuagint against the Hebrew texts that were then available. He broke with church tradition and translated most of the Old Testament of his Vulgate from Hebrew rather than Greek. His choice was severely criticized by Augustine, his contemporary; a flood of still less moderate criticism came from those who regarded Jerome as a forger. While {{on the one hand}} he argued for the superiority of the Hebrew texts in correcting the Septuagint on both philological and theological grounds, on the other, in the context of accusations of heresy against him, Jerome would acknowledge the Septuagint texts as well.|$|E
25|$|As {{darkness}} fell, Adan {{ordered the}} armored forces {{out of the}} city. They were evacuated along the gulf shore, which had been cleared. Adan learned that another force was also meeting stiff resistance in the green belt north of the town, and could spare only one battalion, in addition to another battalion from near Shalufa. Zaken's battalion had eighteen men killed, thirty-five wounded and three disabled tanks which were abandoned. Adan ordered the paratroopers {{to get out of}} the city on foot. Hisdai and Keren spoke in the Hebrew equivalent of pig latin to confuse the Egyptians, and Hisdai asked to have tank projectors beam lights toward the sky to indicate the location of the nearest Israeli unit. <b>He</b> <b>checked</b> <b>the</b> route and returned to lead his troops out.|$|E
500|$|The {{first officer}} {{described}} the snowfall as [...] "not heavy, no large flakes." [...] He told authorities that snow was sliding off the jet and {{the nose of}} the airplane was coated in a watery layer. He used a light positioned on the wing of his jet to check for signs of ice several times before they attempted to take off. Neither he or the pilot saw any evidence of contamination on the wing or on the black strip and therefore decided against a third deicing. He told investigators that <b>he</b> <b>checked</b> <b>the</b> wings [...] "maybe 10 times, but at least 3." [...] He said that he did not consider the snowfall heavy, and he did not recall any wind blowing the snow. The first officer stated that as they taxied, they looked back at the wings several times. Near the time of the takeoff, he said [...] "looks good to me, black strip is clear." ...|$|E

500|$|In 1902, Edson S. Jones, a {{descendant}} of Thomas Arnold of Watertown and Providence mentioned earlier, visited England in search of records pertaining to his family. [...] Thinking that Thomas Arnold was connected with William Arnold (which, it turned out, he was not), he visited Northover and Ilchester, finding the original parish registers, {{as well as other}} important source documents. [...] He discovered that every entry in the Arnold record that could be compared with entries in the parish registers matched perfectly. [...] He also discovered that the Somerby pedigree of the Arnold family had serious discrepancies with original documents. [...] As <b>he</b> <b>checked</b> <b>the</b> source documents from which Somerby supposedly compiled the pedigree, he found that some of the generations in the Somerby pedigree had been shuffled from the original documents, some members of the lineage came from unrelated families, and some place names seemed to have been totally made up. [...] It had earlier been believed that a Thomas Arnold was the father of William Arnold, and Somerby stated that this Thomas Arnold came from a place called Northover near Cheselbourne in County Dorset. [...] No such place exists. [...] The Somerby pedigree of the Arnold family published in 1879 was riddled with misinformation, and it had been accepted as fact for over three decades by even prominent genealogists such as John Osborne Austin. [...] Fred Arnold wrote in 1921, [...] "The most regrettable feature in Somerby's work is, that {{in the absence of any}} English record, known here to disprove it, so reliable a genealogist as Mr. John O. Austin was led to accept and use it in his dictionary, although neither give any record evidence. [...] Very rarely has Mr. Austin accepted another's statement, unless he has himself seen evidence to support it." [...] This fabricated research was not an isolated incident; Mr. Somerby had also been implicated in other fraudulent research and was out to please his clients regardless of the veracity of his work.|$|E

In The Way To Win, a book written by Halperin and John Harris, Drudge is called [...] "the Walter Cronkite of his era". Democratic Party strategist Chris Lehane says [...] "phones start ringing" [...] whenever Drudge breaks a story, and Mark McKinnon, a former media advisor to George W.

2500|$|Bent {{over the}} model, he viewed it from all angles, and in {{different}} kinds of lighting. [...] He asked for a seat. [...] <b>He</b> <b>checked</b> <b>the</b> proportions of the different buildings. [...] He asked {{about the details of}} the bridges. [...] He studied the model for a long time, apparently lost in thought. [...] While Geisler stayed in Berlin, Hitler accompanied him twice daily to view the model, in the afternoon and again during the night. [...] Others in his entourage were taken down to have his building plans explained to them as they pored over the model. Looking down on the model of a city which, he knew, would never be built, Hitler could fall in reverie, revisiting the fantasies of his youth, when he would dream with his friend Kubizek about rebuilding Linz.|$|E

2500|$|On 31 December 1986, {{the first}} {{prototype}} {{took off on}} its maiden flight. The test pilot, Menachem Shmul, head of IAI's Air Operations section, took off at 13:21 and stayed {{in the air for}} 26 minutes, during which <b>he</b> <b>checked</b> <b>the</b> engine and controls. The handling was described as [...] "excellent", {{with a high degree of}} stability in crosswind landings. Both B-01 and B-02 were tandem two-seaters, with the rear cockpit occupied by test equipment. About three months later, a second Lavi prototype took to the air; it featured improvements and additional features over the first, with a belly-mounted fuel tank, a special midair refuelling probe and several new avionic systems. By August 1987, the month in which the Lavi was canceled, a total of 82 sorties had reportedly been flown between the two completed prototypes, during which a significant proportion of the flight envelope had been explored.|$|E

2500|$|Meanwhile, in Carlisle, England, {{officials}} were {{experimenting with a}} sewage treatment, using carbolic acid to reduce the smell of sewage cess pools. [...] Having heard of these developments and having himself previously experimented with other chemicals for antiseptic purposes without much success, Lister decided to try carbolic acid as an wound antiseptic. [...] He had his first chance on August 12, 1865, when he received a patient: an eleven year old boy with a tibia bone fracture which pierced {{the skin of his}} lower leg. [...] Ordinarily, amputation would be the only solution. [...] However, Lister decided to try carbolic acid. [...] After setting the bone and supporting the leg with splints, Lister soaked clean cotton towels in undiluted carbolic acid and applied them to the wound, covered with a layer of tin foil, leaving them for four days. [...] When <b>he</b> <b>checked</b> <b>the</b> wound, Lister pleasantly surprised to find no signs of infection, just redness near the edges of the wound from mild burning by the carbolic acid. [...] Reapplying fresh bandages with diluted carbolic acid, the boy was able to walk home after about six weeks of treatment.|$|E
2500|$|Indeed, Bourguiba {{developed}} a great consideration for mathematics {{because of the}} attention that dedicated his new teacher, Mr. Perrachon to his students. However, he was never present during French lessons, taught by an old regularly heckled professor: [...] "Our timetable scheduled, for Friday afternoon, a history-geography lesson, from 2pm to 3pm and a french lesson from 3pm to 4pm. I was present during the first lesson then left high school at 3pm {{in order to go}} to the theatre where an Arab play was held, in Friday afternoon [...] I was very keen on drama. I thought, moreover, that in matters of French, I really did not need to provide additional efforts, being taught by Mr. Collières at Sadiki". Indeed, he was ranked first in quarterly exams of French, despite these repeated absences. The reason was mere according to Bourguiba who explained it: [...] "Every Friday afternoon, a supervisor came to our history class at 2p.m. <b>He</b> <b>checked</b> <b>the</b> presents and wrote the names of those who were absent. Thus supervisor, who by the way was Tunisian, came back the next hour in french classes. The professor, whose dignity forbade him to suffer a native heckling, hastened to mention the same names written on the notebook and sign. Thus, I had never attended French classes and my absences were regularly unnoticed". Nevertheless, during quarterly exams, Bourguiba was ranked first of second in French.|$|E
2500|$|Cato Uticensis (95–46). His mother's {{brother was}} the {{reformer}} Livius Drusus. His father's grandfather was the famous censor, Cato the Elder (234–149). Here, Cato (also called 'the Younger') {{was a rare}} man among the aristocracy, [...] "a man of the best intentions and of rare devotedness", yet Quixotic and cheerless. Although honourable, steadfast, earnest, and strongly attached [...] "to country and to its hereditary constitution" [...] he possessed little practical understanding. Cato, [...] "dull in intellect and sensuously as well as morally destitute of passion", might have made [...] "a tolerable state accountant." [...] Walking [...] "in the sinful capital as a model citizen and mirror of virtue" [...] he would 'scold' those out of line. His ancestor Cato the Elder worked as a farmer, his anger had made him an orator; wielder of plough and sword, in politics [...] "his narrow, but original and sound common sense ordinarily {{hit the nail on}} the head." [...] The younger Cato, however, inspired by the example of his great-grandfather, made a [...] "strange caricature" [...] of him. Formal and philosophical, a follower of the Stoa, the younger Cato would speak in [...] "scholastic wisdom" [...] and appeared as [...] "this cloud-walker in the realm of abstract morals." [...] Yet like his ancestor, he began [...] "to travel on foot instead of riding, to take no interest, to decline badges of distinction as a soldier", and like the legendary king Romulus to appear shirtless. In [...] "an utterly wretched and cowardly age his courage and his negative virtues told powerfully with the multitude." [...] As [...] "the only conservative of note who possessed if not talent and insight, at any rate integrity and courage... he soon became the champion of the Optimate party." [...] He never missed a senate meeting, and [...] "as long as he lived <b>he</b> <b>checked</b> <b>the</b> details of the public budget." [...] Yet unfortunately in politics he simply lacked common sense. Cato's tactics seemed to consist of nothing more than [...] "setting his face against every one who deviated" [...] from the traditional catechism of the aristocracy, which of course worked as much against the Optimates as for them. By his character and his actions this [...] "Don Quixote of the aristocracy" [...] proved the exhaustion of senate politics.|$|E
