40|$|The {{cytochrome}} P 450 (P 450) and flavin-containing monooxygen-ase (FMO) enzymes are {{the major}} oxidative enzymes in phase I metabolism. Many organophosphate and carbamate thioether compounds are excellent substrates for these enzymes. Stereose-lective sulfoxidation of fenthion and methiocarb by human liver, kidney, and microsomes was investigated. A high level of stereo-selectivity {{in the formation of}} fenthion () -sulfoxide was observed in kidney and intestinal microsomes. This activity was not inhibited by the P 450 inhibitor 1 -aminobenzotriazole but was dramatically reduced following mild heat treatment. In liver, fenthion was me-tabolized to its sulfoxide in a nonstereoselective manner, and the activity was sensitive to both 1 -aminobenzotriazole and heat treat-ment. The carbamate pesticide methiocarb also was sulfoxidated {{with a high degree of}} stereoselectivity in human kidney micro-somes. Human liver microsomes formed both stereoisomers in equal amounts. Sulfoxide formation in kidney was not inhibited by 1 -aminobenzotriazole but was abolished in liver microsomes. For-mation of methiocarb sulfoxides was not observed in intestinal microsomes. The relative contribution of FMO 1 and FMO 3 to the sulfoxidation of carbophenothion, <b>demeton-O,</b> ethiofencarb, fono-fos, and methiocarb also was investigated by using baculovirus-expressed recombinant proteins. FMO 1 showed the highest cata-lytic activity for all pesticides. This study indicates that FMO 1 may have a bigger role in extrahepatic metabolism than previously thought. The P 450 and FMO systems are multigene families involved in the oxidative metabolism of a wide range of xenobiotics. The P 450 family is a superfamily of monooxygenases with at least 57 isoforms iden-tified in human...|$|E
