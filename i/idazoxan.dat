50|$|<b>Idazoxan</b> (INN) {{is a drug}} {{which is}} used in {{scientific}} research. It acts as both a selective α2 adrenergic receptor antagonist, and an antagonist for the imidazoline receptor. <b>Idazoxan</b> has been under investigation as an antidepressant, {{but it did not}} reach the market as such. More recently, it is under investigation as an adjunctive treatment in schizophrenia. Due to its alpha-2 receptor antagonism it is capable of enhancing therapeutic effects of antipsychotics, possibly by enhancing dopamine neurotransmission in the prefrontal cortex of the brain, a brain area thought {{to be involved in the}} pathogenesis of schizophrenia.|$|E
50|$|Fenmetozole (DH-524) {{is a drug}} {{which was}} {{patented}} as an antidepressant, but was later studied as an antagonist {{of the effects of}} ethanol, though results were poor and it even increased its effects in some cases. It acts as an α2-adrenergic receptor antagonist similarly to other imidazoles like <b>idazoxan.</b> It was never marketed.|$|E
50|$|There {{are several}} types of {{adrenergic}} receptors which are identified by their differing sensitivities to various drugs. Neurons in {{the central nervous system}} contain α1- and α2-adrenergic receptors and β1- and β2-adrenergic receptors. All four kinds of receptors are also found in the various organs of the body aside from the brain. They are responsible for the effects of epinephrine and norepinephrine when they act as hormones outside the central nervous system. In the brain, all autoreceptors appear to be of the α2 type. (The drug <b>idazoxan</b> blocks α2 autoreceptors and hence acts as an antagonist.) All adrenergic receptors are metabotropic, coupled to G proteins that control the production of second messengers. Adrenergic receptors can produce both excitatory and inhibitory effects. In general, the behavioral effects of the release of norepinephrine are excitatory. In the brain the α1 receptors produce a slow depolarizing (excitatory) effect on the postsynaptic membrane, while α2 receptors produce a slow hyperpolarization (inhibitory) effect. Both types of β receptors increase the responsiveness of the postsynaptic neuron to its excitatory inputs, which presumably related to the role this neurotransmitter plays in vigilance.|$|E
40|$|<b>Idazoxan</b> was {{studied at}} three dose rates to assess its {{potential}} as an antagonist to xylazine.

A control group received a saline injection instead of <b>idazoxan.</b> All three dose levels of <b>idazoxan</b> successfully reversed the xylazine induced central nervous depression and all animals stood within two minutes of injection. No residual signs of sedation were noticed and relapse did not occur. In addition <b>idazoxan</b> was successful in reversing respiratory and cardiovascular depression produced by xylazine.

40|$|To {{examine the}} role of alpha 2 -adrenoceptors in the control of {{cortisol}} and ACTH, hormone responses to the selective alpha 2 -antagonist <b>idazoxan</b> were studied in 12 normal volunteers. Plasma cortisol and ACTH were measured from 0930 h- 1230 h on three occasions: before, on the 1 st day, and on the 22 nd day of an open treatment trial with <b>idazoxan</b> 40 mg administered three times per day. Compared with pretreatment cortisol levels, acute but not chronic <b>idazoxan</b> treatment attenuated the normal diurnal fall in plasma cortisol. Plasma ACTH concentrations were not altered by either dose of <b>idazoxan.</b> The attenuation of the diurnal fall in cortisol after acute <b>idazoxan</b> may be mediated through increased central availability of norepinephrine, and is similar to responses after high doses of the less selective alpha 2 -antagonist yohimbine. Activity of central noradrenergic neurons appears to be reduced or normalized by chronic <b>idazoxan,</b> indicated by restoration of the normal diurnal fall in cortisol...|$|E
40|$|The {{profiles}} of four analogues of <b>idazoxan</b> {{have been examined}} at alpha-adrenoceptors and the results compared to those obtained with <b>idazoxan</b> and yohimbine. The compounds possessed either a methyl (RX 801079), ethyl (RX 811033), n-propyl (RX 811054) or isopropenyl (RX 811005) group at the two position of <b>idazoxan.</b> The rank order of antagonist potency against UK- 14, 304 at prejunctional alpha 2 -adrenoceptors of the rat isolated vas deferens was RX 811054 greater than RX 811033 greater than <b>idazoxan</b> greater than RX 811005 greater than yohimbine = RX 801079. All compounds were competitive antagonists. The rank order of antagonist potency against noradrenaline at postjunctional alpha 1 -adrenoceptors of the rat isolated anococcygeus muscle was RX 811054 = RX 811033 = <b>idazoxan</b> = yohimbine greater than RX 811005 = RX 801079. All compounds were competitive antagonists. The rank order of alpha-adrenoceptor selectivity (alpha 2 /alpha 1) was RX 811005 greater than RX 801079 greater than RX 811054 greater than RX 811033 greater than <b>idazoxan</b> greater than yohimbine. In pithed rats, intravenous administration of all compounds fully reversed the prejunctional alpha 2 -adrenoceptor agonist effects of clonidine and guanabenz on electrically-induced contractions of the vas deferens and anococcygeus muscle respectively. In pithed rats the rank order of antagonist potency against UK- 14, 304 at cardiac prejunctional alpha 2 -adrenoceptors was RX 811054 greater than RX 811033 greater than <b>idazoxan</b> greater than yohimbine greater than RX 811005 greater than RX 801079. In contrast, the rank order of antagonist potency against cirazoline pressor effects (vascular postjunctional alpha 1 -adrenoceptors) was RX 811054 greater than RX 811033 greater than yohimbine greater than <b>idazoxan</b> greater than RX 811005 greater than RX 801079. The rank order of alpha 2 -adrenoceptor selectivity was RX 811033 = RX 801079 = RX 801005 greater than RX 811054 greater than <b>idazoxan</b> greater than yohimbine. Although <b>idazoxan</b> produced contractions of the anococcygeus muscle and increased blood pressure in pithed rats, three of the analogues (RX 811005, RX 801079 and RX 811033) were inactive. In conclusion, alkyl substitution in the 2 -position of <b>idazoxan</b> can enhance either alpha 2 -adrenoceptor antagonist potency or selectivity or both and furthermore, the weak partial alpha 1 -adrenoceptor agonist properties of <b>idazoxan</b> can be removed...|$|E
40|$|An {{experiment}} {{was carried out}} to determine whether <b>idazoxan,</b> a drug which increases the turnover of central noradrenaline, removes the malaise (reduced alertness, slower psychomotor performance) associated with upper respiratory tract illness (URTI). Eighty-one volunteers were tested when healthy and 17 returned to the laboratory when they developed URTIs. Those who remained healthy were then recalled as a control group. Volunteers were tested before and after receiving either <b>idazoxan</b> (40 mg) or a lactose placebo. <b>Idazoxan</b> removed the URTI-induced slowing in a simple reaction time task and this group performed at a comparable level to the healthy group. No significant stimulant effect of <b>idazoxan</b> {{was found in the}} healthy subjects.

40|$|Our {{previous}} {{studies suggest that}} in addition to the cerebral dopaminergic systems the noradrenergic ones have {{a crucial role in the}} morphine-induced behavioural sensitization in mice. Therefore the effects of α 2 -adrenoceptor antagonist, <b>idazoxan</b> (1 and 3 [*]mg[*]kg− 1, i. p.) on morphine-induced locomotor hyperactivity as well as on morphine-induced changes in cerebral noradrenaline (NA) and striatal dopamine (DA) metabolism were studied in mice withdrawn for 3 days from 5 day repeated morphine treatment. The concentrations of NA, free 3 -methoxy- 4 -hydroxyphenylethylene glycol (MOPEG), DA, 3, 4 -dihydroxyphenylacetic acid (DOPAC), homovanillic acid (HVA), and 3 -methoxytyramine (3 -MT) were determined. Acute morphine (10 [*]mg[*]kg− 1, s. c.) increased locomotor activity in control and in morphine-withdrawn mice; <b>idazoxan</b> alone did not alter the activity. <b>Idazoxan</b> pretreatment did not alter the locomotor hyperactivity induced by acute morphine in control mice but potentiated it in morphine-withdrawn mice. Acute morphine elevated MOPEG less but increased DOPAC and HVA more clearly in morphine-withdrawn mice than in controls, and decreased 3 -MT only in controls. <b>Idazoxan</b> alone did not alter the NA or DA metabolite concentrations in control mice, but elevated MOPEG as well as DOPAC in morphine-withdrawn mice. In control mice <b>idazoxan</b> enhanced acute morphine's elevating effect on MOPEG. In withdrawn mice <b>idazoxan</b> counteracted the tolerance so that acute morphine elevated MOPEG in these mice to about similar level as in controls. <b>Idazoxan</b> pretreatment abolished the HVA increasing effect of acute morphine both in control and withdrawn mice. In control mice <b>idazoxan</b> enhanced morphine's elevating effect on DOPAC and abolished morphine's decreasing effect on 3 -MT. <b>Idazoxan</b> did not alter morphine's effects on DOPAC or 3 -MT concentrations in withdrawn mice. Our results show that in morphine-withdrawn mice <b>idazoxan</b> pretreatment reveals the morphine-induced locomotor sensitization. This most probably occurs by overcoming the tolerance towards the acute morphine-induced increase of cerebral NA turnover and release. It is suggested that in mice the cerebral noradrenergic in addition to the dopaminergic systems are major determinants of the behavioural sensitization to morphine...|$|E
40|$|In {{an attempt}} to assess {{separately}} the peripheral and central effects of clonidine on cardiovascular parameters and plasma catecholamine levels, the selective alpha 2 -adrenoceptor antagonist <b>idazoxan</b> (RX 781094) was given either intravenously (i. v.) or intracerebroventricularly (i. c. v.) to anaesthetized rats before administration of intravenous clonidine. Plasma noradrenaline and plasma growth hormone concentrations were used as indices of peripheral sympathetic nervous activity and central alpha-adrenoceptor stimulation, respectively. Peripheral and central administration of <b>idazoxan</b> antagonized the cardiovascular responses to i. v. clonidine, 5 micrograms kg- 1. However, <b>idazoxan</b> was more effective against the hypotension than the bradycardia induced by clonidine. <b>Idazoxan</b> 300 micrograms kg- 1 i. v. and 50 micrograms i. c. v. prevented clonidine-induced falls in plasma noradrenaline and adrenaline. The results suggest that 50 micrograms <b>idazoxan</b> i. c. v. caused some blockade of peripheral as well as central alpha 2 -adrenoceptors. <b>Idazoxan,</b> 10 micrograms i. c. v., caused similar inhibition of the hypotensive response to clonidine as 300 micrograms kg- 1 i. v. and 50 micrograms i. c. v. but did not significantly inhibit the clonidine-induced fall in plasma noradrenaline concentration. Animals pretreated with i. v. or i. c. v. <b>idazoxan</b> had significantly lower levels of plasma growth hormone than vehicle-treated rats. <b>Idazoxan</b> 10 micrograms and 50 micrograms i. c. v. suppressed growth hormone secretion to the same extent. These results suggest that stimulation of peripheral, prejunctional alpha 2 -adrenoceptors in anaesthetized rats {{may contribute to the}} fall in plasma catecholamines produced by i. v. clonidine, and confirm that the hypotensive effect is centrally mediated...|$|E
40|$|Two {{studies were}} {{performed}} each in six normal volunteers {{in order to}} find evidence of either a physiological or pharmacological role of presynaptic alpha- and presynaptic beta-adrenoceptors in man. In Study 1 subjects received a 60 min infusion of guanfacine 3 mg (alpha 2 -adrenoceptor agonist) preceded by either <b>idazoxan</b> (alpha 2 -adrenoceptor antagonist) or vehicle. Guanfacine reduced plasma noradrenaline concentration by approximately 30 % and this fall was not antagonised by the alpha 2 -receptor antagonist. The 30 -fold increase in plasma growth hormone, measured as a marker of the central action of guanfacine, was almost completely blocked by <b>idazoxan.</b> A comparison of the drug concentrations of <b>idazoxan</b> and guanfacine, together with their relative affinities for alpha 2 -adrenoceptors, suggested that the <b>idazoxan</b> could not block the peripheral actions of guanfacine and that these were responsible for the fall in plasma noradrenaline concentration. In Study 2 adrenaline 0. 05 micrograms kg- 1 min- 1 was infused for 80 min preceded by either <b>idazoxan</b> or vehicle. After vehicle, adrenaline caused no change in plasma noradrenaline concentration whereas it rose approximately 25 % after administration of <b>idazoxan.</b> This was probably due to unmasking of presynaptic beta-adrenoceptor stimulation by adrenaline when the opposing inhibitory autoreceptor was blocked...|$|E
40|$|The {{effects of}} the {{selective}} alpha 2 -adrenoceptor agonist detomidine on gastric acid secretion from pylorus-ligated and stomach-perfused rats have been investigated. In pylorus-ligated rats i. p. injection of detomidine markedly inhibited acid secretion, this effect being prevented by yohimbine or <b>idazoxan.</b> Under the same conditions, <b>idazoxan</b> significantly increased secretion in a dose-independent fashion. In non-vagotomized and vagotomized stomach-perfused rats i. p. detomidine stimulated acid secretion: this excitatory effect was antagonized by <b>idazoxan.</b> The present results suggest that both inhibitory and excitatory gastric secretory effects of detomidine are mediated by alpha 2 -adrenoceptors on cholinergic and adrenergic nerves, respectively. The stimulant activity of <b>idazoxan</b> on gastric secretion from pylorus-ligated rats may be interpreted in terms of increased excitatory vagal tone following the blockade of inhibitory alpha 2 -adrenoceptors...|$|E
40|$|In rats, the jaw-opening reflex is {{elicited}} by {{activation of}} a nociceptive receptor by the electric {{stimulation of the}} tooth pulp. This study was undertaken to assess the effects of 30 % nitrous oxide and 30 % nitrous oxide with <b>idazoxan,</b> an alpha 2 -adrenergic antagonist, on this reflex. Each rat received electric stimulation for the jaw-opening reflex at 3, 5, 7, 10, 15, and 20 min after both the start of inhalation and the withdrawal of 100 % oxygen or 30 % nitrous oxide in oxygen. <b>Idazoxan,</b> 400 micrograms/ kg, was administered intravenously {{at the start of}} the inhalation period. Amplitudes significantly decreased during inhalation of nitrous oxide, but they returned gradually to control levels after cessation of nitrous oxide inhalation. In the cases of 100 % oxygen, 100 % oxygen with <b>idazoxan,</b> and 30 % nitrous oxide in oxygen with <b>idazoxan,</b> amplitudes did not change from controls during and after 30 % nitrous oxide inhalation.

40|$|The alpha 2 -adrenoceptor {{blocking}} {{properties of}} <b>idazoxan</b> enantiomers were evaluated at pre- and postsynaptic level.

The antagonist (+) -idazoxan showed an affinity towards the alpha 2 -autoreceptors 40 times higher than that showed by (-) -idazoxan. Binding studies revealed (+) -idazoxan to be 7 - 8 times more potent than (-) -idazoxan in inhibiting the p-[3 H]aminoclonidine binding. These results indicate a different affinity of alpha 2 -adrenoceptors for the two <b>idazoxan</b> stereoisomers, thus suggesting that the alpha 2 -adrenoceptors located pre- and postsynaptically may be of two stereochemically different subtypes...|$|E
40|$|Slices of rabbit {{cerebral}} cortex were preincubated with [3 H]-noradrenaline and then superfused and stimulated electrically twice for 2 min each (S 1, S 2) at various frequencies (0. 2 - 3 Hz). The stimulation-evoked overflow of tritium (S 1) increased {{with increasing frequency}} and was higher when cocaine (10 microM) was present. In the absence of cocaine, tetraethylammonium (TEA; 100 and 300 microM), added before S 2, increased the stimulation-evoked overflow of tritium to about the same extent, irrespective of the frequency. In contrast, rauwolscine (0. 1 and 1 microM) and <b>idazoxan</b> (0. 1 - 10 microM) increased the evoked overflow much more, the higher the frequency of stimulation. Phentolamine (0. 1 and 1 microM) reduced the overflow elicited at 0. 3 and 1 Hz, and (1 microM) caused an increase only at 3 Hz. In slices superfused throughout with cocaine 10 microM, rauwolscine (1 microM) and <b>idazoxan</b> (1 and 10 microM) again increased the evoked overflow of tritium more, the higher the frequency of stimulation. For a given frequency, rauwolscine and <b>idazoxan</b> enhanced the evoked overflow {{to a greater extent}} in the presence than in the absence of cocaine. <b>Idazoxan</b> (1 and 10 microM) and rauwolscine (1 microM) counteracted the inhibition that phentolamine (0. 1 microM) produced at low frequency. The increases caused by rauwolscine (1 microM) and TEA (300 microM) were approximately additive, but those caused by rauwolscine (1 microM) and <b>idazoxan</b> (10 microM) were not. The effects of rauwolscine, <b>idazoxan</b> and phentolamine depend on the experimental conditions (frequency, cocaine) in a manner compatible with the operation of a presynaptic alpha 2 -adrenoceptor-mediated autoinhibition of noradrenaline release.

40|$|Preliminary reports suggest {{improved}} {{executive function}} {{in patients with}} lobar dementia after treatment with single doses of the alpha 2 adrenoceptor antagonist, <b>idazoxan.</b> The potential for use in probable Alzheimer-type dementia prompted the present study. Fifteen patients with probable Alzheimer-type dementia were examined twice with neuropsychological measures and 14 also with single photon emission tomography (SPET) after a single double blind oral administration of 40 mg <b>idazoxan</b> or placebo in a balanced cross-over design. Brain perfusion maps were spatially transformed into standard stereotactic space and compared pixel-by-pixel. A parametric {{analysis was used to}} examine the relationship between the drug effect, verbal fluency and brain perfusion. Two to 3 h after <b>idazoxan,</b> measures of reaction time, Stroop test, category fluency and anxiety were unchanged. Verbal fluency (letter) and spatial working memory were impaired and performance on the Tower of London test in a sub-set of patients showed a trend to impairment in the <b>idazoxan</b> condition. <b>Idazoxan</b> produced a modest relative activation in left thalamus and inferior occipital cortex: decreases occurred in inferior anterior cingulate and left insular cortex. There were significant correlations on both days between measures of fluency and brain perfusion in left lateral prefrontal cortex. The reduced performance with <b>idazoxan</b> was directly correlated with reduced perfusion in left lateral prefrontal cortex, supporting an important interaction between drug and task performance. The imaging component of the study therefore suggested that activation of frontal networks is necessary for performing fluency tasks in Alzheimer-type dementia. Brain networks involving prefrontal cortex are the locus for the primary cognitive effects of noradrenergic drugs. The direction of the effect of any dose of agonist or antagonist may depend critically upon the age and pathology of the experimental subjects and the relationship between performance, noradrenergic drive and task difficulty...|$|E
40|$|The {{nature of}} the binding site(s) {{involved}} in the insulin secretory activity of imidazoline compo- unds remains unclear. An imidazoline I 2 binding site (I 2 BS) has been neglected since the classic I 2 ligand, <b>idazoxan,</b> does not release insulin. Using the rabbit as an appropriate model {{for the study of}} this type of binding sites, we have tried to re-evaluate the effects of <b>idazoxan,</b> the selective I 2 compound BU 224, and efaroxan on insulin secretion. Mimicking efaroxan, <b>idazoxan</b> and BU 224 potentiated insulin release from perifused islets in the presence of 8 mM glucose. In static incubation, insulin secretion induced by <b>idazoxan</b> and BU 224 exhibited both dose and glucose dependencies. ATP-sensitive K+ (KATP) channel blockade, though at a different site from the SUR 1 receptor, with subsequent Ca 2 + entry, mediates the insulin releasing effect of the three ligands. However, additional MAO independent intracellular steps in stimulus- secretion coupling linked to PKA and PKC activation are only involved in the effect of BU 224. Therefore, both an I 2 related binding site at the channel level shared by the three ligands and a putative I 3 -intracellularly located binding site stimulated by BU 224 would be mediating insulin release by these compounds. In vivo experiments reassess the abilities of <b>idazoxan</b> and BU 224 to enhance glucose-induced insulin secretion and to elicit a modest blood glucose lowering response...|$|E

Application of the α 2 -adrenoceptor antagonist, <b>idazoxan</b> (1 μM), increased the amplitude of NA-induced oxidation currents evoked by trains of 10 stimuli at 1 and 10 Hz. In cells deep in the media, <b>idazoxan</b> (1 μM) had no effect on the amplitude of e. j. p. 's evoked by trains of 10 stimuli at 1 and 10 Hz. In cells close to the adventitial – medial border, <b>idazoxan</b> produced a small increase in the amplitude of e. j. p. 's evoked at the end of trains of 10 stimuli at 1 Hz. In tissues pretreated with the neuronal NA uptake inhibitor, desmethylimpramine (0. 3 μM), <b>idazoxan</b> (1 μM) markedly increased the amplitude of e. j. p. 's in cells deep in the media. The α 2 -adrenoceptor agonist, clonidine (0. 5 μM), produced similar reductions in the amplitudes of both NA-induced oxidation currents and e. j. p. 's evoked by 10 stimuli at 1 Hz.

In cortical binding assays using [3 H]-idazoxan and [3 H]-prazosin, <b>idazoxan</b> had a 5 times greater alpha 2 /alpha 1 -selectivity than yohimbine. The 2 -alkyl substituted analogues all showed improved selectivity, being between 17 and 29 times more selective than yohimbine for [3 H]-idazoxan binding sites. In terms of central antagonist potency in vivo, the most favourable substitutions were 2 -ethyl (RX 811033) and 2 -n-propyl (RX 811054).

40|$|Rationale: The {{combination}} of <b>idazoxan,</b> a specific alpha(2) -adrenoceptor antagonist with raclopride, a selective D- 2 /D- 3 receptor antagonist, has been recently proposed {{to produce an}} atypical antipsychotic profile {{comparable to that of}} clozapine, based on an animal study which analysed dopamine efflux in the medial prefrontal cortex and the preclinical test of conditioned avoidance response (CAR) for evaluation of antipsychotic potential. Accordingly, the {{combination of}} a typical antipsychotic with <b>idazoxan</b> has been proposed as an augmentation strategy in treatment-resistant schizophrenia, although its therapeutic potential remains difficult to predict. Objectives: Given the momentum stimulated by these reports, the present study investigated whether the combination of <b>idazoxan</b> with raclopride is indeed sufficient to mimic the ability of clozapine to reverse prepulse inhibition (PPI) deficits in rats, a behavioral paradigm that models PPI deficits observed in the schizophrenia spectrum, and currently the only test which reliably appears to distinguish between typical antipsychotics and compounds with atypical antipsychotic potential. Methods: The effects of the combination idazoxan/raclopride were examined in two PPI paradigms: 1) phencyclidine (PCP) -induced disruption of PPI, which {{has been shown to be}} preferentially reversed by atypical antipsychotics; 2) apomorphine-induced disruption of PPI which can be reversed by either typical high-potency D- 2 dopamine antagonists or atypical antipsychotics. Results: In contrast to clozapine, combining <b>idazoxan</b> with raclopride failed to reverse PCP-induced deficits in PPI In addition, there was no evidence of an enhancing effect of <b>idazoxan</b> on the blockade of apomorphine-induced disruption of PPI by raclopride. Conclusion: The present results challenge the hypothesis that simple alpha(2) /D- 2 blockade is sufficient to produce clozapine-like atypical antipsychotic activities, and support the consensus that the PPI paradigm represents the most sophisticated behavioral preclinical test for detecting selective atypical profile of antipsychotics...|$|E

The inhibitory potency of 6 FNA was significantly increased {{in the presence of}} cocaine (1 microM) or pargyline (10 microM), but was not modified in the vas deferens from rats pretreated with reserpine when the endogenous levels of noradrenaline (NA) were decreased by 97 %. Clonidine was significantly more potent than 6 -FNA as an inhibitory agonist, and the potency of clonidine was not modified after cocaine, pargyline or reserpine. The alpha 2 -adrenoceptor blocking agent <b>idazoxan,</b> was a competitive antagonist against the inhibitory effects of clonidine under all experimental conditions. In contrast, the only antagonism shown by <b>idazoxan</b> against the inhibitory effects of 6 -FNA was in the presence of cocaine (1 microM), and this antagonist effect of <b>idazoxan</b> was not concentration-related. Low concentrations of 6 -FNA caused concentration-dependent facilitatory effects on the twitch response, which were significantly greater after treatment with <b>idazoxan</b> (1 microM) in reserpine-treated vas deferens. These facilitatory effects of 6 -FNA were always observed in the presence of prazosin (300 nM) and also after treatment of the preparations with phenoxybenzamine (10 microM), a concentration which abolished the inhibitory actions of both clonidine and 6 -FNA. The facilitatory effects on the twitch response induced by low concentrations of 6 -FNA are therefore unlikely to be due to either alpha 1 - or alpha 2 -adrenoceptor stimulation. In conclusion, the failure of <b>idazoxan</b> to block the inhibitory effects of 6 -FNA, while exerting a potent competitive antagonism of clonidine-induced inhibitory effects, supports the proposal that alpha 2 -adrenoceptors may in fact be subdivided into two subclasses, involving imidazoline and phenylethylamine recognition sites...|$|E
40|$|Previous {{studies have}} {{suggested}} that imidazoline I(2) receptors play a role in feeding control in rats. The effect of subcutaneous (s. c.) injections of four novel imidazoline I(2) ligands, 2 -naphthalen- 2 yl- 4, 5 -dihydro- 1 H-imidazole hydrochloride (benazoline), 2 -styryl- 4, 5 -dihydro- 1 H-imidazole oxalate (tracizoline), o-nitro-tracizoline and o-methyl-tracizoline (metrazoline) on food intake during the light phase was now evaluated in freely feeding male Wistar rats. Their effect was compared to that of <b>idazoxan,</b> a high-affinity ligand at imidazoline I(2) binding sites, but also a potent alpha(2) -adrenoceptor antagonist. Compared to <b>idazoxan,</b> metrazoline exhibits a higher pK(i) for imidazoline I(2) binding sites in rat liver, while the other compounds have a slightly lower pK(i); on the other hand, the novel compounds have much lower affinity than <b>idazoxan</b> at alpha(2) -adrenoceptors. <b>Idazoxan</b> stimulated drinking at a dose as low as 1 mg/kg, and evoked feeding at a higher dose (30 mg/kg). The selective alpha(2) -adrenoceptor antagonist 2 -methoxy-idazoxan (RX 821002), with negligible affinity at imidazoline I(2) binding sites, significantly increased drinking but failed to stimulate feeding at doses of 10 - 50 mg/kg. Metrazoline induced hyperphagia and water drinking at doses of 50 mg/kg or higher. Its dipsogenic effect was secondary to the hyperphagic effect, since it was not observed in rats without access to food. Benazoline significantly increased feeding only in response to 30 mg/kg, but its effect was less pronounced than that of metrazoline. Tracizoline and o-nitro-tracizoline were inactive. Following injection into the lateral cerebroventricle at doses up to 100 microgram/rat, and into the third or fourth brain ventricle at doses up to 50 microgram/rat, neither <b>idazoxan</b> nor metrazoline induced hyperphagia. The present results support the idea that imidazoline I(2) ligands influence feeding in rats, and suggest that their site of action is not in the central nervous system. The finding that <b>idazoxan</b> elicits a more potent hyperphagic effect than metrazoline and benazoline, although its affinity for imidazoline I(2) binding sites is lower than that of metrazoline and similar to that of benazoline, raises the question whether its hyperphagic effect might also be due to interaction with other receptors...|$|E
40|$|Agmatine, the {{proposed}} endogenous ligand for imidazoline receptors, {{has been shown}} to attenuate tolerance to morphine-induced antinociception (Kolesnikov et al., 1996). The main aim {{of this study was to}} assess if <b>idazoxan,</b> an α 2 -adrenoceptor antagonist that also interacts with imidazoline receptors, could also modulate opioid tolerance in rats and to establish which type of imidazoline receptors (or other receptors) are involved. Antinociceptive responses to opioid drugs were determined by the tail-flick test. The acute administration of morphine (10 [*]mg[*]kg− 1, i. p., 30 [*]min) or pentazocine (10 [*]mg[*]kg− 1, i. p., 30 [*]min) resulted in marked increases in tail-flick latencies (TFLs). As expected, the initial antinociceptive response to the opiates was lost after chronic (13 days) treatment (tolerance). When <b>idazoxan</b> (10 [*]mg[*]kg− 1, i. p.) was given chronically 30 [*]min before the opiates it completely prevented morphine tolerance and markedly attenuated tolerance to pentazocine (TFLs increased by 71 – 143 % at day 13). <b>Idazoxan</b> alone did not modify TFLs. The concurrent chronic administration (10 [*]mg[*]kg− 1, i. p., 13 days) of 2 -BFI, LSL 60101, and LSL 61122 (valldemossine), selective and potent I 2 -imidazoline receptor ligands, and morphine (10 [*]mg[*]kg− 1, i. p.), also prevented or attenuated morphine tolerance (TFLs increased by 64 – 172 % at day 13). This attenuation of morphine tolerance was still apparent six days after discontinuation of the chronic treatment with LSL 60101 -morphine. The acute treatment with these drugs did not potentiate morphine-induced antinociception. These drugs alone did not modify TFLs. Together, these results indicated the specific involvement of I 2 -imidazoline receptors in the modulation of opioid tolerance. The concurrent chronic (13 days) administration of RX 821002 (10 [*]mg[*]kg− 1, i. p.) and RS- 15385 - 197 (1 [*]mg[*]kg− 1, i. p.), selective α 2 -adrenoceptor antagonists, and morphine (10 [*]mg[*]kg− 1, i. p.), did not attenuate morphine tolerance. Similarly, the concurrent chronic treatment of moxonidine (1 [*]mg[*]kg− 1, i. p.), a mixed I 1 -imidazoline receptor and α 2 -adrenoceptor agonist, and morphine (10 [*]mg[*]kg− 1, i. p.), did not alter the development of tolerance to the opiate. These results discounted the involvement of α 2 -adrenoceptors and I 1 -imidazoline receptors in the modulatory effect of <b>idazoxan</b> on opioid tolerance. <b>Idazoxan</b> and other imidazol(ine) drugs fully inhibited [3 H]-(+) -MK- 801 binding to N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptors in the rat cerebral cortex with low potencies (Ki: 37 – 190 [*]μM). The potencies of the imidazolines <b>idazoxan,</b> RX 821002 and moxonidine were similar, indicating a lack of relationship between potency on NMDA receptors and ability to attenuate opioid tolerance. These results suggested that modulation of opioid tolerance by <b>idazoxan</b> is not related to NMDA receptors blockade. Chronic treatment (13 days) with morphine (10 [*]mg[*]kg− 1, i. p.) was associated with a marked decrease (49 %) in immunolabelled neurofilament proteins (NF-L) in the frontal cortex of morphine-tolerant rats, suggesting the induction of neuronal damage. Chronic treatment (13 days) with <b>idazoxan</b> (10 [*]mg[*]kg− 1) and LSL 60101 (10 [*]mg[*]kg− 1) did not modify the levels of NF-L proteins in brain. Interestingly, the concurrent chronic treatment (13 days) of <b>idazoxan</b> or LSL 60101 and morphine, completely reversed the morphine-induced decrease in NF-L immunoreactivity, suggesting a neuroprotective role for these drugs. Together, the results indicate that chronic treatment with I 2 -imidazoline ligands attenuates the development of tolerance to opiate drugs and may induce neuroprotective effects on chronic opiate treatment. Moreover, these findings offer the I 2 -imidazoline ligands as promising therapeutic co-adjuvants in the management of chronic pain with opiate drugs...|$|E

B-HT 958. Plasma noradrenaline {{was used as an}} approximate index of peripheral sympathetic nervous activity. B-HT 958 350 micrograms kg- 1 i. v. caused significant falls in blood pressure and heart rate which were maximal 5 min after dosing (- 29. 25 +/- 3. 2 mmHg and - 52 +/- 6. 8 beats min- 1 respectively, mean of all control animals). The hypotension and bradycardia were accompanied by significant falls in plasma noradrenaline concentration of 30 - 40 %. <b>Idazoxan</b> 300 micrograms kg- 1 i. v. caused a marked, but transient tachycardia and a large sustained rise in plasma noradrenaline concentration. <b>Idazoxan</b> 300 micrograms kg- 1 and 1000 micrograms kg- 1 i. v. did not prevent B-HT 958 -induced falls in mean arterial pressure, heart rate and plasma noradrenaline concentration. Responses to B-HT 958 were unaffected by <b>idazoxan</b> 20 micrograms i. c. v. B-HT 958 -induced falls in mean arterial pressure, heart rate and plasma noradrenaline concentration were significantly attenuated by i. v. administration of the dopamine receptor antagonist, sulpiride 300 micrograms kg- 1. Sulpiride 10 micrograms and 50 micrograms i. c. v. caused inhibition of B-HT 958 hypotension and bradycardia similar to that of intravenous sulpiride. After i. c. v. sulpiride, B-HT 958 did not cause a significant fall in plasma noradrenaline concentration. A combination of <b>idazoxan</b> 1000 micrograms kg- 1 i. v. and sulpiride 300 micrograms kg- 1 i. v. did not cause further significant inhibition of B-HT 958 hypotension and bradycardia compared with sulpiride 300 micrograms kg- 1 i. v. alone. This combination however had a significantly greater effect in inhibiting B-HT 958 hypotension than had <b>idazoxan</b> 1000 micrograms kg- 1 alone, and almost completely blocked the B-HT 958 -induced fall in plasma noradrenaline concentration. These results suggest that in the anaesthetized rat the cardiovascular effects of B-HT 958 are due to stimulation of dopamine receptors, probably located within the central nervous system, and not to stimulation of peripheral prejunctional alpha 2 -adrenoceptors...|$|E
40|$|Context Certain {{imidazoline}} drugs stimulate insulin secretion acutely {{but their}} longer term {{effects on the}} viability of pancreatic beta-cells are less well characterised. Indeed, some reports have suggested that imidazolines can be toxic to beta-cells while others have reported protective effects against other cytotoxic agents. Objective In order to address these discrepancies, the effects of two structurally related imidazolines, efaroxan and <b>idazoxan,</b> on the viability of clonal BRIN-BD 11 beta-cells, were compared. Design and main outcome measures BRIN-BD 11 cells were exposed to test reagents and their viability monitored by measuring cellular reducing ability and DNA fragmentation. Nitric oxide was measured indirectly via medium nitrite formation. Results Efaroxan (up to 100 µM) did not directly affect BRIN-BD 11 cell viability {{in the absence of}} other agents and it did not protect these cells against the cytotoxic effects of interleukin- 1 beta. Indeed, analysis of DNA fragmentation in BRIN-BD 11 cells revealed that efaroxan enhanced the level of damage caused by interleukin- 1 beta. <b>Idazoxan</b> caused a time- and dose-dependent loss of BRIN-BD 11 cell viability in the absence of other ligands. This was associated with marked DNA degradation but was not associated with formation of nitric oxide. The effects of <b>idazoxan</b> were insensitive to blockade of alpha 2 -adrenoceptors or 5 -HT 1 A (5 -hydroxytryptamine; serotonin) receptors. Conclusions The results confirm that <b>idazoxan</b> is cytotoxic to beta-cells but show that efaroxan is better tolerated. However, since efaroxan enhanced the cytotoxic effects of interleukin- 1 beta, it appears that this imidazoline may sensitise BRIN-BD 11 cells to the damaging effects of certain cytokines...|$|E
40|$|Characteristic {{features}} of noradrenaline (NA) and adenosine 5 ′-triphosphate (ATP) release from postganglionic sympathetic nerves in rat small mesenteric arteries in vitro {{have been investigated}} on an impulse-by-impulse basis. NA release was measured using continuous amperometry and ATP release was monitored by intracellular recording of excitatory junction potentials (e. j. ps). Electrical stimuli evoked transient increases in oxidation current. During trains of ten stimuli at 0. 5 – 4 [*]Hz there was a depression in the amplitude of oxidation currents evoked following the first stimulus in the train. The neuronal NA uptake inhibitor, desmethylimipramine (1 [*]μM), increased the amplitude of the summed oxidation current evoked by ten stimuli at 1 [*]Hz and slowed the decay of oxidation currents evoked by trains of ten stimuli at 1 and 10 [*]Hz. The α 2 -adrenoceptor antagonist, <b>idazoxan</b> (1 [*]μM), increased the amplitudes of the oxidation currents evoked during trains of ten stimuli at 0. 5 – 10 [*]Hz but {{had no effect on}} the oxidation currents evoked by the first stimulus in the train. <b>Idazoxan</b> (1 [*]μM) increased the amplitude of all e. j. ps evoked during trains of stimuli at 0. 5 and 1 [*]Hz. In addition, the facilitatory effect of <b>idazoxan</b> on e. j. ps was significantly greater than that on oxidation currents. The findings indicate that NA release from sympathetic nerves supplying small mesenteric arteries is regulated by activation of presynaptic α 2 -adrenoceptors and that clearance of released NA in this tissue depends, in part, upon neuronal uptake. The different effects of <b>idazoxan</b> on the oxidation currents and e. j. ps may indicate that the release of NA and ATP is differentially modulated...|$|E

Oxymetazoline, xylazine, detomidine and alpha-methylnoradrenaline caused a significant and concentration-dependent inhibition of the stimulation-evoked release of [3 H]acetylcholine, with calculated IC 50 values of 1. 22 microM, 0. 88 microM, 0. 93 microM and 0. 83 microM, respectively. <b>Idazoxan</b> (1 microM), CH 38083 (1 microM), WB 4101 (1 microM), prazosin (1 - 10 microM) and ARC 239 (1 - 10 microM) did not significantly affect the evoked release of [3 H]acetylcholine.

The effect of phenoxybenzamine in increasing the efflux of radioactivity produced by a single pulse of stimulation was abolished by cocaine, indicating that the increase in efflux was due to blockade of noradrenaline uptake. Contractile responses of guinea-pig vasa stimulated with a single pulse in the presence of cocaine were unaltered by phenoxybenzamine, whereas with a train of stimulation the twitch component was enhanced and the second phase was reduced. The effects of phenoxybenzamine or <b>idazoxan</b> on the efflux of radioactivity from rat vasa portions were qualitatively the same as were observed in whole vasa. The contractile response of the prostatic portion consisted of a rapid twitch with a single pulse of stimulation, but was biphasic with a train of stimulation; the response of the epididymal portion was biphasic with either a single pulse or a train of pulses.
