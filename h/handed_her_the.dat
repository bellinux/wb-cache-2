2500|$|In 1944, Edith Rogers helped draft, {{and then}} co-sponsored the G. I. Bill, with Representative John E. Rankin, and Senators Ernest McFarland, and Bennett Champ Clark. The bill {{provided}} {{for education and}} vocational training, low-interest loans for homes, farms, and businesses, and limited unemployment benefits for returning servicemen. A secondary intent was to reduce {{the economic impact of}} the millions of veterans returning to the workforce by staggering their reentry. On June 22, 1944, President Franklin D. Roosevelt signed [...] "The Servicemen's Readjustment Act", which became Public Law 78-346 and <b>handed</b> <b>her</b> <b>the</b> first pen. As a result of the bill, roughly half of the returning veterans went on to higher education.|$|E
2500|$|The records {{contained}} the official testimony from Colonel R.S. Sarkisov and Colonel V. Nadaraia, two of Beria's most senior NKVD bodyguards. They stated that on warm nights {{during the war}} years, Beria was often driven slowly {{through the streets of}} Moscow in his armored Packard limousine. He would point out young women to be detained and escorted to his mansion where wine and a feast awaited them. After dining, Beria would take the women into his soundproofed office and rape them. Beria's bodyguards reported that their orders included handing each victim a flower bouquet as she left Beria's house. The implication was that to accept made it consensual; refusal would mean arrest. In one incident his chief bodyguard, Sarkisov, reported that a woman who had been brought to Beria rejected his advances and ran out of his office; Sarkisov mistakenly <b>handed</b> <b>her</b> <b>the</b> flowers anyway prompting the enraged Beria to declare [...] "Now it's not a bouquet, it's a wreath! May it rot on your grave!" [...] The woman was arrested by the NKVD the next day.|$|E

60|$|He <b>handed</b> <b>her</b> <b>the</b> {{envelope}} in silence. She took it, extracted the sheets, {{and read the}} letter through.|$|E
60|$|FITZSIMMONS. [Who, all <b>the</b> time, {{watching}} <b>her</b> transformation, {{has been}} growing bashful, now <b>handing</b> <b>her</b> <b>the</b> cigarette case.] Here's the cigarette case. You may k-k-keep it.|$|R

60|$|A servant {{brought the}} coffee and went out again. Her father lighted a cigar and <b>handed</b> <b>her</b> <b>the</b> cigarettes.|$|E
60|$|He rolled {{forward with}} his {{ponderous}} yet curiously noiseless gait. Scaramouche turned to her, smiling, and <b>handed</b> <b>her</b> <b>the</b> candle.|$|E
60|$|He <b>handed</b> <b>her</b> <b>the</b> letter she {{had written}} and left {{on the table at}} Mrs. Jethway's. She looked over it vacantly.|$|E

6000|$|... "This, my darling," [...] he answered, <b>handing</b> <b>her</b> <b>the</b> paper. [...] "I {{never loved}} book-learnings over-much, and this morn I seem to hate them; read, {{you who are}} more scholarly." ...|$|R
60|$|They {{moved away}} along the platform, and on {{reaching}} the trap {{he got up}} beside her and <b>handed</b> <b>her</b> <b>the</b> reins.|$|E
60|$|Alora passed out, {{scarcely}} {{aware that}} Janet had pretended {{to lock the}} door. Halfway down the hall the woman <b>handed</b> <b>her</b> <b>the</b> key.|$|E
60|$|And {{stood in}} homespun. Now grown wholly hers, I <b>handed</b> <b>her</b> <b>the</b> gold, her jewels all, And him the choicest of her robes diverse.|$|E
6000|$|She pours it out, and {{he drinks}} it, <b>hands</b> <b>her</b> <b>the</b> glass and sits [...] down {{suddenly}} in an armchair. CAMILLE puts the glass on a tray, and [...] {{looks for a}} box of matches from the mantelshelf.|$|R
6000|$|Leland looked up, {{and there}} was a trace of dryness in his smile. [...] "I have had quite a few things to worry me lately," [...] he said, <b>handing</b> <b>her</b> <b>the</b> note. [...] "This is merely one of them." ...|$|R

60|$|He <b>handed</b> <b>her</b> <b>the</b> little note, and Mrs. Ross stooped {{down and}} read it by the fitful gleam of light which came from the cracked stove.|$|E
6000|$|BLUNTSCHLI. True. Allow me. (He {{takes out}} his card-case, and stops to write his address, keeping Catherine in an agony of impatience. As he <b>hands</b> <b>her</b> <b>the</b> card, Petkoff, hatless, rushes from the house in a fluster of hospitality, {{followed}} by Sergius.) ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Thank you. Now this," [...] he continued, {{rising and}} <b>handing</b> <b>her</b> <b>the</b> {{book with a}} bow, [...] "is my revenge for your father's {{treatment}} of me. Perhaps he'll be sorry he didn't buy the 'Complete Works of Peter Smith.' Good-by, my dear." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes, {{but would}} she marry YOU? What I ask of you {{of course is}} nothing less than your word of honour as to your {{conviction}} of this. If you give it me," [...] I said, [...] "I'll engage to <b>hand</b> <b>her</b> <b>the</b> letter before night." ...|$|R
