5|$|An {{important}} {{area of research}} concerned the Wigner effect. Under bombardment by neutrons, the carbon atoms in the graphite moderator can be <b>knocked</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> the graphite's crystalline structure. Over time, this causes the graphite to heat and swell. Investigation of the problem would take most of 1946 before a fix was found.|$|E

5|$|Pirlo was {{not able}} to play the first two games in the 2010 World Cup for Italy due to recent injuries. He came off the bench for Italy late in the match on 24 June against Slovakia.

5|$|Burgmeier {{injured his}} ankle {{at the start}} of the 2007–08 season, and after playing only four league games, Thun signed him on a six-month loan deal in January 2008. He played 17times for Thun, who {{finished}} bottom of the Super League. Thun were also <b>knocked</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> the Swiss Cup by Burgmeier's main employers in the semi-finals. On 13 July 2008, his contract with Basel was terminated early to allow him to find himself a new club after just 23league appearances because he was seen as surplus to requirements by manager Christian Gross.|$|E
5|$|By {{the end of}} January 2004, Arsenal {{were still}} in the hunt for all four trophies, but {{suffered}} setbacks in each of the cup competitions; they were unable to retain the FA Cup, losing out to eventual winners Manchester United in the semi-finals and days later were <b>knocked</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> the UEFA Champions League by Chelsea in the quarter-finals.

5|$|Despite Stroheim's {{reputation}} as a perfectionist, Greed contains anachronisms. In the scenes on Polk Street, the main characters are clothed in 1890s fashions, but the extras wear 1920s clothing. Stroheim {{did his best to}} avoid such historical mistakes; he shot only those buildings that were from the era Greed was set in, and he kept motor vehicles out of sight while filming. Daniels stated that, despite his desire for authenticity, Stroheim sometimes had walls <b>knocked</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> real locations to achieve a desired camera position.|$|E
5|$|In the Olympics, Djokovic was <b>knocked</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> the men's singles in {{the opening}} round by Juan Martín del Potro, in {{a repeat of the}} bronze medal match from four years earlier.

Murray ultimately won the final in four sets, becoming the first man to win the singles gold medal twice. Nadal lost the bronze medal match to Kei Nishikori, but won gold in the men's doubles event.|$|E
5|$|Nigel Worthington made eight signings in {{his second}} summer {{transfer}} window as York manager. With the team only one place above the relegation zone by mid October 2014, Worthington resigned {{and was replaced by}} former Scunthorpe United manager Russ Wilcox. After a six-match unbeaten run from late March to mid April 2015, York ensured survival from relegation before finishing in 18th-position in the 24-team 2014–15 League Two.

By {{the turn of the}} year York were only above the relegation zone on goal difference, before a 17-match unbeaten run saw the team finish in seventh-place in the 24-team 2013–14 League Two. This meant York qualified for the play-offs, and they were eliminated in the semi-final by Fleetwood Town. York were <b>knocked</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> the 2013–14 FA Cup, League Cup and Football League Trophy in their opening round matches.|$|E

5|$|The FA Cup win in 1973 {{meant that}} Sunderland, {{for the first}} time in their history, had {{qualified}} for a European competition, in this case the UEFA Cup Winners' Cup. They were first drawn against Hungarian side Vasas Budapest, who they beat 3–0 on aggregate. In the next round Sunderland were drawn against Sporting Lisbon. They won the first leg 2–1 at Roker Park, but in the return leg in Lisbon they were beaten 2–0, and were thus <b>knocked</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> the competition in the second round.|$|E

5|$|The {{battle has}} gone {{down in history as}} one of the turning points of the War of the Spanish Succession. Bavaria was <b>knocked</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> the war, and Louis' hopes for a quick victory came to an end. France {{suffered}} over 38,000 casualties including the commander-in-chief, Marshal Tallard, who was taken captive to England.
