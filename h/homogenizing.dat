Milk <b>homogenized</b> after ultra-high-temperature treatment is apparently more susceptible to forming a cream layer than milk <b>homogenized</b> before the heat treatment. However, this study shows that milk <b>homogenized</b> after indirect ultra-high-temperature treatment has both a microstructure, as determined by transmission electron microscopy and immunogold labelling, and a cream layer thickness {{similar to that of}} milk <b>homogenized</b> before indirect ultra-high-temperature treatment, suggesting that it is feasible to <b>homogenize</b> milk before ultra-high-temperature treatment. Also, directly heated milk had a microstructure similar to that of indirectly heated milk.

Credited with shaping much of Chinese thought, Confucianism was the official philosophy throughout most of Imperial China's history, institutionalizing values like filial piety, which implied the performance of certain shared rituals. Thus, villagers lavished on funeral and wedding ceremonies that imitated the Confucian standards of the Emperors. Mastery of Confucian texts provided the primary criterion for entry into the imperial bureaucracy, but even those degree-holders who did not enter the bureaucracy or who left it held increased social influence in their home areas, contributing to the <b>homogenizing</b> of Han Chinese culture.

25|$|New {{chemical}} glass compositions or {{new treatment}} techniques can be initially investigated in small-scale laboratory experiments. The {{raw materials for}} laboratory-scale glass melts are often different from those used in mass production because the cost factor has a low priority. In the laboratory mostly pure chemicals are used. Care must be taken that the raw materials have not reacted with moisture or other chemicals in the environment (such as alkali or alkaline earth metal oxides and hydroxides, or boron oxide), or that the impurities are quantified (loss on ignition). Evaporation losses during glass melting should be considered during {{the selection of the}} raw materials, e.g., sodium selenite may be preferred over easily evaporating SeO2. Also, more readily reacting raw materials may be preferred over relatively inert ones, such as Al(OH)3 over Al2O3. Usually, the melts are carried out in platinum crucibles to reduce contamination from the crucible material. Glass homogeneity is achieved by <b>homogenizing</b> the raw materials mixture (glass batch), by stirring the melt, and by crushing and re-melting the first melt. The obtained glass is usually annealed to prevent breakage during processing.|$|E

40|$|This Licentiate {{thesis is}} {{focussed}} on some new questions in homogenization theory, {{which have been}} motivated by some concrete problems in tribology. From the mathematical point of view, these questions are equipped with scales of Reynolds equations with rapidly oscillating coefficients. In particular, in this Licentiate thesis we derive the corresponding <b>homogenized</b> (averaged) equation. We consider the Reynolds equations in both the stationary and unstationary forms to analyze the effect of surface roughness on the hydrodynamic performance of bearings when a lubricant is flowing through it. In Chapter 1 we describe the possible types of surfaces a bearing can take. Out of these, we select two types and derive the appropriate Reynolds equations needed for their analysis. Chapter 2 {{is devoted to the}} derivation of the <b>homogenized</b> equations, associated with the stationary forms of the compressible and incompressible Reynolds equations. We derive these <b>homogenized</b> equations by using the multiple scales expansion technique. In Chapter 3 the <b>homogenized</b> equations for the unstationary forms of the Reynolds equations are considered and some numerical results based on the <b>homogenized</b> equations are presented. In chapter 4 we consider the equivalent minimization problem for the unstationary Reynolds equation and use it to derive a <b>homogenized</b> minimization problem. Finally, we obtain both the lower and upper bounds for the derived <b>homogenized</b> problem. Godkänd; 2007; 20070523 (ysko...|$|R

25|$|It is {{proposed}} {{that there were}} three major pathways that most animal domesticates followed into domestication: (1) commensals, adapted to a human niche (e.g., dogs, cats, fowl, possibly pigs); (2) prey animals sought for food (e.g., sheep, goats, cattle, water buffalo, yak, pig, reindeer, llama, alpaca, and turkey); and (3) targeted animals for draft and nonfood resources (e.g., horse, donkey, camel). The dog {{was the first to}} be domesticated, and was established across Eurasia {{before the end of the}} Late Pleistocene era, well before cultivation and before the domestication of other animals. Unlike other domestic species which were primarily selected for production-related traits, dogs were initially selected for their behaviors.

The news coverage from the early years to the mid-1980s was perceived by some as being [...] "white-washed" [...] for its lack of coverage of the gay African-American population located in Washington, D.C., a city where more than 70 percent of its residents were African-American. This {{led to the creation}} of the short-lived publication Blacklight, the city's first African-American gay monthly periodical in August 1979, which attempted to compete with the Blade. Coverage of the City Council special election in April 1991 garnered intensive criticism of biased coverage and led to calls for reforming the paper's editorial board. In 1993, the Blade and its publishing company threatened to sue the Fairfax County Library over a potential ban [...] on the distribution of the Blade at its branches. Also, the 2001 sale of the Washington Blade to Window Media, LLC led to intense criticism from former employees, editors, and media pundits of the consolidation of so many gay newspapers' editorial boards into the same company, leading to fears of <b>homogenizing</b> of content and editorial control.

40|$|International audienceThis paper {{presents}} a numerical strategy that allows {{to lower the}} costs associated {{to the prediction of}} the value of <b>homogenized</b> tensors in elliptic problems. This is done by solving a coupled problem, in which the complex microstructure is confined to a small region and surrounded by a tentative <b>homogenized</b> medium. The characteristics of this <b>homogenized</b> medium are updated using a self-consistent approach and are shown to converge to the actual solution. The main feature of the coupling strategy is that it really couples the random microstructure with the deterministic <b>homogenized</b> model, and not one (deterministic) realization of the random medium with a <b>homogenized</b> model. The advantages of doing so are twofold: (a) the influence of the boundary conditions is significantly mitigated, and (b) the ergodicity of the random medium can be used in full through appropriate definition of the coupling operator. Both of these advantages imply that the resulting coupled problem is less expensive to solve, for a given bias, than the computation of <b>homogenized</b> tensor using classical approaches.
