5|$|Determined Egyptian {{resistance}} {{made progress}} extremely slow for the Israelis, who suffered heavy losses. The Israelis were repeatedly reinforced with armor but {{were unable to}} make much headway, only managing to seize an important crossroad on the second day. Suffering {{from a lack of}} infantry, the Israelis brought up paratroopers during the night of October 16/17. They were tasked with clearing anti-tank defenses for the armor, but they became pinned down by heavy Egyptian fire. The paratroopers drew Egyptian attention long enough for the <b>Israelis</b> <b>to</b> move bridging equipment to the canal undetected. Armored forces later extricated the paratroopers.|$|E
5|$|Israel {{continued}} {{to control the}} city until early June 1974, when it was returned to Syrian civilian control following the signature of a United States-brokered disengagement agreement signed on 31 May 1974. The surrender of Quneitra was controversial, with Israeli settlers and the Likud and National Religious Party opposing it. According to Michael Mandelbaum, the agreement provided {{that the city was}} to be repopulated to serve as evidence of peaceful Syrian intentions, by doing so it would encourage the <b>Israelis</b> <b>to</b> pull back further.|$|E
5|$|The 1990s saw an {{increasing}} interest in international cuisines. Sushi, in particular, has taken hold {{as a popular}} style for eating out and as an entrée for events. In restaurants, fusion cuisine, with the melding of classic cuisines such as French and Japanese with local ingredients has become widespread. In the 2000s, the trend of “eating healthy” {{with an emphasis on}} organic and whole grain foods has become prominent, and medical research has led many <b>Israelis</b> <b>to</b> re-embrace the Mediterranean diet, with its touted health benefits.|$|E

5|$|Reshef {{decided to}} change tactics. He {{personally}} commanded the 40th Armored Battalions, after reinforcing it with tanks salvaged and repaired from the previous night's fighting, and maneuvered to attack from the west – {{from the direction of}} the canal – hitting Egyptian positions in the flank, while a tank company and an infantry company attacked from south to north. Reshef's forces engaged the Egyptians from long range, picking off defensive positions from afar, while using alternate fire and movement to advance to the crossroads. The defending infantry battalion, exhausted by continuous fighting and suffering from a severe lack of ammunition, soon withdrew allowing the <b>Israelis</b> <b>to</b> at last seize the junction.|$|E
5|$|From 1983 to 1993, Arafat based {{himself in}} Tunisia, {{and began to}} shift his {{approach}} from open conflict with the <b>Israelis</b> <b>to</b> negotiation. In 1988, he acknowledged Israel's right to exist and sought a two-state solution to the Israeli–Palestinian conflict. In 1994 he returned to Palestine, settling in Gaza City and promoting self-governance for the Palestinian territories. He engaged {{in a series of}} negotiations with the Israeli government to end the conflict between it and the PLO. These included the Madrid Conference of 1991, the 1993 Oslo Accords and the 2000 Camp David Summit. In 1994 Arafat received the Nobel Peace Prize, together with Yitzhak Rabin and Shimon Peres, for the negotiations at Oslo. At the time, Fatah's support among the Palestinians declined with the growth of Hamas and other militant rivals. In late 2004, after effectively being confined within his Ramallah compound for over two years by the Israeli army, Arafat fell into a coma and died. While the cause of Arafat's death has remained the subject of speculation, investigations by Russian and French teams determined no foul play was involved.|$|E
5|$|However, there {{remained}} {{too many}} signs for the <b>Israelis</b> <b>to</b> ignore, chief among {{which was the}} hasty Soviet evacuation from Cairo and Damascus, and the constant buildup of forces on the Syrian front when Egypt, it was assumed, would not enter war. Though the Chief of Staff, David Elazar, was assured that the probability of war remained low, he took precautionary steps on October 5. Elazar placed the entire military on alert, canceled all leaves, and ordered the Air Force to assume a full-alert posture. He also ordered the 7th Armored Brigade to relocate from the Sinai to the Golan Heights. This raised Israeli numbers in the Golan Heights to 177 tanks and 44 artillery pieces on October 6. To replace the 7th Armored Brigade, the Armor School, {{under the command of}} Colonel Gabi Amir, was ordered to activate its tank brigade for immediate airlift; it was in the Sinai by October 6, before the war began. Ultimately though, no orders for mobilization were issued to reservists; Elazar and other senior commanders still expected a 24- to 48-hour warning from the intelligence services if the Arab nations were bent on war.|$|E

5|$|With {{the end of}} the 1948 Arab Israeli War, the {{majority}} of volunteer airmen returned home, and 69 Squadron once again went through a period of reorganization. From an English-speaking outfit it was transformed into a Hebrew speaking unit. Training was stepped up to qualify <b>Israelis</b> <b>to</b> take over vacated positions and the squadron settled into a peacetime routine, with the B-17s conducting bombing and cloud seeding tests and participating in IDF exercises. The IAF itself was undergoing major changes, and in early May 1949 69 Squadron relocated to Tel Nof. In October 1951 the squadron moved once more, this time to Hatzor. In December 1952 the three B-17 was joined by three PBY Catalinas, acquired to guarantee supply to the town of Eilat at Israel's southern extremity. Utilization of these aircraft, however, was low and they were soon withdrawn from service with the squadron. Spares, meanwhile, were also hampering B-17 operations and in March 1954 69 Squadron was deactivated and its assests handed over to 103 Squadron, which soon retired the Catalinas but continued to operate the three B-17s.|$|E
5|$|At around 13:00, a recon {{group from}} 2nd Division {{discovered}} around 75 tanks concentrating north {{east of the}} bridgehead. Ten minutes later the Egyptians intercepted a radio signal in Hebrew. Nir was informing his command that {{he was ready to}} attack within twenty minutes. With little time left, Abu Sa'ada decided to take a risky move. Estimating, correctly, that the attack would come be directed between his two forward brigades, the weakest point in his lines, Abu Sa'ada planned to draw Israeli forces into his bridgehead to within three kilometers of the canal before engaging them from all sides, committing all his anti-tank reserves. At 13:30, the attack was carried out by Amir and Nir's brigades. A lack of coordination and communication difficulties between both brigades hampered the attack. Nir's two battalions attacked {{at the same time in}} two echelons. The Egyptians allowed the <b>Israelis</b> <b>to</b> advance, then encircled them. When the attackers entered the prepared killing zone, Egyptian armor of the 24th Brigade opened fire on the advancing tanks, complemented by infantry anti-tank weapons on either flank of the Israeli forces, while tank hunting detachments attacked from the rear. Within just 13 minutes, most of the Israeli force was destroyed—the Egyptians destroyed over 50 tanks and captured eight intact. Among the captured were Lieutenant Colonel Asaf Yaguri, a battalion commander, whose unit lost 32 killed. By the end of the attack Nir had just four operational tanks remaining, including his own. Gabi Amir's battalion, attacking to Nir's right, was forced to halt his advance after encountering stiff resistance. Amir requested air support several times, but did not receive any.|$|E
25|$|Territorial Therapy, the {{ideation}} {{of migration}} or yerida, {{is often a}} psychological outlet or mechanism utilized by many <b>Israelis</b> <b>to</b> counter the stress {{of living in a}} dangerous political situation in the Middle East.

25|$|While {{planning}} the raid, the Israeli forces had to plan how to refuel the Lockheed C-130 Hercules aircraft {{they intended to}} use while en route to Entebbe. The Israelis lacked the logistical capacity to aerially refuel four to six aircraft so far from Israeli airspace.

By the end of the battle, nearly 150 Fatah militants had been killed, as well as twenty Jordanian soldiers and twenty-eight Israeli soldiers.

25|$|The Soviet Union, {{after long}} {{peering through the}} keyhole of a closed door on what it {{considered}} a Western sphere of influence, now found itself invited over the threshold {{as a friend of}} the Arabs. Shortly after it reopened, the canal was traversed by the first Soviet warships since World War I. The Soviets' burgeoning influence in the Middle East, although it was not to last, included acquiring Mediterranean bases, introducing multipurpose projects, supporting the budding Palestinian liberation movement and penetrating the Arab countries. Nasser claimed to be the defender of the Palestinian cause, but his anti-Israel warlike rhetoric damaged the Palestinians since it convinced a lot of the <b>Israelis</b> <b>to</b> oppose reconciliation with the Palestinians.|$|E
25|$|The Egyptians {{took time}} to regroup for a final assault on the villages inner defenses, {{bringing}} reinforcements. During this reprieve, the defenders repaired the mortars and PIAT that were damaged by the flood and the dust, and {{made a series of}} raids on Egypt-held structures. At 14:00, the Egyptians counterattacked but were met with heavy fire and took many casualties. This prompted the <b>Israelis</b> <b>to</b> move their only working communications device to a safer location, but it broke down, and contact with the brigade HQ was only restored at 16:00. At 17:00, the villagers again reported that their situation was critical, and that an attempted counterattack failed. The Negev Brigade intelligence officer, David Niv, intercepted an Egyptian radio message where the commander of the assault claimed to have already taken the village.|$|E
25|$|GEDCO {{estimates}} {{the damage to}} the electricity network due to the recent hostilities at over $10 million. Even before the conflict, its reserves of spare parts were close to depletion due to the 18-month blockade on Gaza. By 29 January 38 transformers essential for the repair of the electricity system are still waiting permission from the <b>Israelis</b> <b>to</b> be allowed into Gaza. Due to the lack of supplies, GEDCO continues to partially repair the network where possible. The UN warns that those ad-hoc partial repairs will increase technical losses by 25-30 percent, reduce the lifetime of network components, and further expose sections of the network to possible collapse. Since the cease-fire, Israel has allowed approximately 87 tonnes cooking gas per day, which is much less than the estimated need of 300 tonnes per day. No petrol or diesel has been allowed into Gaza since 2 November, except for UNRWA. No petrol, diesel or cooking gas was allowed by Israel into Gaza between 8 and 14 February.|$|E
