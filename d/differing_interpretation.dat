2500|$|Unlike Rabbinic Jews, Karaites do not {{practice}} {{the ritual of}} lighting Shabbat candles. They have a <b>differing</b> <b>interpretation</b> of the Torah verse, [...] "You shall not [...] (Hebrew: bi‘er the pi‘el form of ba‘ar) a fire in any of your dwellings {{on the day of}} Shabbat." [...] In Rabbinic Judaism, the qal verb form ba‘ar is understood to mean [...] "burn", whereas the pi‘el form (present here) is understood to be, not intensive as usual but causative, the rule being that the pi‘el of a stative verb will be causative, instead of the usual hif‘il. Hence bi‘er means [...] "kindle", which is why Rabbinic Judaism prohibits starting a fire on Shabbat. The vast majority of Karaite Jews hold that, throughout the Tanakh, ba‘ar explicitly means [...] "to burn", while the Hebrew word meaning [...] "to ignite" [...] or [...] "to kindle" [...] is hidliq. Accordingly, the mainstream in Karaite Judaism takes the passage to mean that fire should not be left burning in a Jewish home on Shabbat, regardless of whether it was lit prior to, or during the Sabbath. However, the minority of Karaites who view the prohibition to be on kindling a fire often permit a fire to continue burning into the Sabbath.|$|E
