Visibility underwater is reduced because light passing through water attenuates rapidly with distance, leading to lower levels of natural illumination. Underwater objects are also blurred by scattering of light between the object and the viewer, resulting in lower contrast. These effects vary with the wavelength of the light, and the colour and turbidity of the water. The human eye is optimised for air vision, and when it is immersed in direct contact with water, visual acuity is adversely affected by the difference in refractive index between water and air. Provision of an airspace between the cornea and the water can compensate, but causes scale and distance distortion. Artificial illumination can improve visibility at short range. Stereoscopic acuity, the ability to judge relative distances of different objects, is considerably reduced underwater, and this {{is affected by}} the field of vision. A narrow field of vision caused by a small viewport in a helmet results in greatly reduced stereoacuity, and an apparent movement of a stationary object when the head is moved. These effects lead to poorer <b>hand-eye</b> <b>coordination.</b>|$|E

25|$|Slips and bat pad require fast reactions, {{an ability}} to {{anticipate}} the trajectory of the ball {{as soon as it}} takes the edge, and intense concentration. Most top slip fielders tend to be top-order batsmen, as these are both skills that require excellent <b>hand–eye</b> <b>coordination.</b> Wicket-keepers and Bat-pad tend to be amongst the shortest players of the team.|$|E
25|$|This shot {{requires}} good <b>hand-eye</b> <b>coordination</b> and bravery, especially against faster bowlers—where a miss can {{not only}} result in the batsmen being dismissed. but the ball can injure the batsman if it hits his head. However, used occasionally as a calculated risk, the shot can frustrate the fielding side's captain, because positioning a fielder to stop a paddle scoop may present gaps and scoring opportunities in other areas.|$|E
25|$|It {{has been}} shown that action video game players have better <b>hand–eye</b> <b>coordination</b> and visuo-motor skills, such as their {{resistance}} to distraction, their sensitivity to information in the peripheral vision and their ability to count briefly presented objects, than nonplayers. Researchers found that such enhanced abilities could be acquired by training with action games, involving challenges that switch attention between different locations, but not with games requiring concentration on single objects.|$|E

A common thought is that video games are for people who are lazy, but in reality they are benefiting children with spatial navigation, reasoning, memory and perception.|$|E
25|$|The {{driver of}} a cable car {{is known as}} the gripman or grip operator. This is a highly skilled job, {{requiring}} the gripman to smoothly operate the grip lever to grip and release the cable, release the grip at certain points to coast the vehicle over crossing cables or places where the cable does not follow the tracks, and to anticipate well in advance possible collisions with other traffic that may not understand the limitations of a cable car. Being a gripman requires great upper body strength needed for the grip and brakes, as well as good <b>hand–eye</b> <b>coordination</b> and balance.|$|E
25|$|Research {{has focused}} on two {{elements}} {{of the effects of}} video games on players: the player's health measures and educational achievements as a function of game play amounts; the players' behavior or perceptions {{as a function of the}} game's violence levels; the context of the game play in terms of group dynamics; the game's structure which affects players' visual attention or three dimensional constructional skills; and the mechanics of the game which affects <b>hand-eye</b> <b>coordination.</b> Two other research methods that have been used are experimental (in a laboratory), where the different environmental factors can be controlled, and non-experimental, where those who participate in studies simply log their video gaming hours.|$|E
25|$|Rhythmic {{gymnastics}} is a {{sport in}} which individuals or groups of five or more manipulate one or two pieces of apparatus: rope, hoop, ball, clubs, ribbon and freehand (no apparatus). Rhythmic gymnastics is a sport that combines elements of ballet, gymnastics, dance, and apparatus manipulation. The victor is the participant who earns the most points, determined {{by a panel of}} judges, for leaps, balances, pirouettes (pivots), apparatus handling, and execution. The choreography must cover the entire floor and contain a balance of jumps, leaps, pivots, balances (a certain number is required depending on the gymnast's level) and flexibility movements. Each movement involves a high degree of athletic skill. Physical abilities needed by a rhythmic gymnast include strength, power, flexibility, agility, dexterity, endurance and <b>hand-eye</b> <b>coordination.</b>|$|E
25|$|With Faulkner {{retiring}} in 1924, the South Africans, {{who had only}} two quality players in Taylor and Cattrell, underwent somewhat of a barren period in the 1920s. However, {{the emergence of a}} new generation of South African cricketers, more so in their batting than in their bowling, in the 1930s such as Bruce Mitchell, Xen Balaskas, Ken Viljoen, Dudley Nourse, Eric Rowan, Alan Melville, Pieter van der Bijl, and Ronnie Grieveson once again ensured that South Africa became a top quality international team. The team's leading batsmen during this era were Mitchell, Nourse, Rowan, Melville, and van der Bijl. Nourse, in particular, became famous for his <b>hand-eye</b> <b>coordination</b> and his excellent fielding, one of many to be produced by South Africa in the coming decades; natural skills which were according to legend inspired and developed by his father Dave's refusal to coach him as an youngster, demanding that he learnt the rudiments of the game on his own, as he himself had. This South African team was also distinct from past South African teams in one respect: whereas the previous teams had comprised entirely of British-origin players, this team had Afrikaners like van der Bijl and Greeks such as Balaskas, regarded by wide consensus to be the greatest Greek cricketer ever.|$|E
25|$|There {{are many}} {{variants}} of tavla in Turkey, where {{the course of}} play changes drastically. The usual tavla {{is also known as}} erkek tavlası meaning boys' or men's tavla. The other variant kız tavlası (meaning girls' tavla) is a game which depends only on the dice and involves no strategy. There is another variant called asker tavlası (meaning soldiers' tavla) where the pieces are thrown to the board randomly and the opponents try to flip their pieces over the opponents' pieces to beat them. The player with no pieces left loses the game. This variant doesn't involve dice at all and the play depends more on <b>hand-eye</b> <b>coordination</b> than tactical decision making. Üniversite tavlası (university tavla) is a variant of the game played with two or more tavlas and four or more players, with the players forming groups. The dice are thrown only by two opposing players and the rest must play the same dice. If a team member gets beaten and cannot enter, his team mates cannot play for that round. Although the dice are the same, the game on every board differs interestingly, where the case of one team member winning and another losing is very common. This variant is considered much harder because the player must take more than one play into account while only being capable of making decisions on his own board.|$|E

2500|$|Kohn and Mithen {{independently}} {{arrived at}} the explanation that symmetric hand axes were favoured by sexual selection as fitness indicators. Kohn in his book As We Know It wrote that the hand axe is [...] "a highly visible indicator of fitness, and so becomes a criterion of mate choice." [...] Miller followed their example and said that hand axes have characteristics that make them subject to sexual selection, such as that they were made for over a million years throughout Africa, Europe and Asia, they were made in large numbers, and most were impractical for utilitarian use. He claimed that a single design persisting across time and space cannot be explained by cultural imitation and draws a parallel between bowerbirds' [...] (built to attract potential mates and used only during courtship) and Pleistocene hominids' hand axes. He called hand axe building a [...] "genetically inherited propensity to construct {{a certain type of}} object." [...] He discards the idea that they were used as missile weapons because more efficient weapons were available, such as javelins. Although he accepted that some hand axes may have been used for practical purposes, he agreed with Kohn and Mithen who showed that many hand axes show considerable skill, design and symmetry beyond that needed for utility. Some were too big, such as the hand axe found in Furze Platt, England that is over a foot long. Some were too small - less than two inches. Some feature symmetry beyond practical requirements and show evidence of unnecessary attention to form and finish. Miller thinks that the most important clue is that under electron microscopy hand axes show no signs of use or evidence of edge wear. Furthermore, hand axes can be good handicaps in Zahavi's handicap principle theory: learning costs are high, risks of injury, they require physical strength, <b>hand-eye</b> <b>coordination,</b> planning, patience, pain tolerance and resistance to infection from cuts and bruises when making or using such a hand axe.|$|E
