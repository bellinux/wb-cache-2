We {{prove that}} when the group of homo-theties H(M;d) is a locally compact group, {{with respect to the}} compact-open topology, it is a Lie group if, and only if, the group of isometries I(M;d) is a Lie group. Then we prove that when (M;d) is a Heine-Borel metric space, its group of <b>homotheties</b> H(M;d) is also a Heine-Borel met-ric space and, if (M;d) is a Heine-Borel ultrametric space, its group of isometries is an {{increasing}} union of compact subgroups. We also prove that when (M;d) is locally compact and the space (M) of the connected components of M is quasi-compact, its group of <b>homotheties</b> H(M;d) is locally compact. As applications we give some generalizations of classical results in Riemannian geometry. Namely, if (M;d) is a Finsler manifold or an Alexandro space, then its group of <b>homotheties</b> is a Lie group. With some additional hypothesis, this is also true for a Hadamard space. ...|$|R
