500|$|Heydrich {{spoke for}} nearly an hour. Then {{followed}} about thirty minutes of questions and comments, followed by some less formal conversation. Otto Hofmann (head of the SS Race and Settlement Main Office (RuSHA)) [...] and Wilhelm Stuckart (State Secretary of the Reich Interior Ministry) pointed out the legalistic and administrative difficulties over mixed marriages, and suggested compulsory dissolution of mixed marriages or the wider use of sterilisation as a simpler alternative. Erich Neumann from the Four Year Plan argued for the exemption of Jews who were working in industries vital {{to the war effort}} and for whom no replacements were available. Heydrich assured him that this was already the policy; such Jews would not be killed. Josef Bühler, State Secretary of the General Government, stated his support for the plan and his hope that the killings would commence as soon as possible. Towards the end of the meeting cognac was served, and after that the conversation became less restrained. [...] "The gentlemen were standing together, or sitting together", Eichmann said, [...] "and were discussing the subject quite bluntly, quite differently from the language which <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>use</b> later in the record. During the conversation they minced no words about it at all... they spoke about methods of killing, about liquidation, about extermination". Eichmann recorded that Heydrich was pleased with the course of the meeting. He had expected a lot of resistance, Eichmann recalled, but instead he had found [...] "an atmosphere not only of agreement {{on the part of the}} participants, but more than that, one could feel an agreement which had assumed a form which had not been expected".|$|E

[...] reported that the Icelandic gunboat Aegir had attempted to ram her while she was escorting British trawlers in the disputed area. Two reports were received from the ship during the evening. The first, at 19:00 BST read, [...] "Four gunboats in the area and plainly up to something. While covering trawlers from Aegir she plainly tried to ram me." [...] The second, at 20:30 BST, read, [...] "Russell had drawn abreast Aegirs starboard side and was steaming at 12knots on the same course at a distance of 200ft. Intention was to shield trawlers from Aegir... Aegir sounded one short blast [...] and put wheel over. Her wake showed considerable wheel used. <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>use</b> 20degrees to get clear. Aegir passed close astern." ...|$|E
2500|$|From {{an early}} age, José showed a {{precocious}} intellect. He learned the alphabet {{from his mother}} at 3, and could read and write at age 5. Upon enrolling at the Ateneo Municipal de Manila, he dropped the last three names that made up his full name, {{on the advice of}} his brother, Paciano and the Mercado family, thus rendering his name as [...] "José Protasio Rizal". Of this, he later wrote: [...] "My family never paid much attention , but now <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>use</b> it, thus giving me the appearance of an illegitimate child!" [...] This was to enable him to travel freely and disassociate him from his brother, who had gained notoriety with his earlier links to Filipino priests Mariano Gomez, Jose Burgos and Jacinto Zamora (popularly known as Gomburza) who had been accused and executed for treason.|$|E

60|$|Soon my tackle was {{all used}} up, and, {{for want of}} better, <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>use</b> tiny hooks and thread lines--because I was going to fish, by hook or crook! This method, however, which I learned first of all, {{is not to be}} despised.

60|$|Before {{going to}} bed, I desired a black servant of Mr. Marchinton's {{to call me}} about day-break, as I desired {{to go out and}} pick berries. This was done, and I was up and dressed before any other member of the family was stirring. I lost no time, but quitted the house, and walked {{deliberately}} down to the schooner. No one was up on board of her, and I was obliged to give the mate a call, myself. This man now seemed disposed to draw back from his bargain, and <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>use</b> a good deal of persuasion before I could prevail on him {{to be as good as}} his word. He did not like to part with the fowling-piece, but seemed to think it would be fairly purchased, could he persuade me to run away. At length he yielded, and I got into the locker, where I was covered with potatoes.|$|E
60|$|High {{up these}} cracked and stained walls {{were covered with}} lichens, with little spruces growing in niches, and tiny yellow bushes. Points of {{crumbling}} rock were stained gold and russet and bronze. Below the huge gorge was full of aspens, maples, spruces--a green, crimson, yellow density of timber, apparently impenetrable. We were accorded different stations on the ledges all around the cove, and instructed to stay there until called by four blasts from a hunting horn. My point was so far from R.C.'s, across the canyon, that <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>use</b> my field-glass to see him. When I did look he seemed contented. Lee and Nielsen and Haught I could not see at all. Finding a comfortable seat, if hard rock could ever be that, I proceeded to accept my wait for developments. One thing was sure--even {{though it were a}} futile way to hunt it seemed rich in other recompense for me. My stand towered above a vast colorful slope down which the wind roared as in a gale. How could I ever hear the hounds? I watched the storm-clouds scudding across the sky. Once I saw a rare bird, a black eagle in magnificent flight; and so whatever happened I had my reward in that sight.|$|E

5000|$|As for his almost polite {{approach}} to the game, Jones believed that anything less would have been downright un-Christian. [...] "If <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> play defense by holding on, that's when I quit," [...] Jones said early in his career. [...] "If <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>use</b> an elbow <b>to</b> get position, then I’m going <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> settle for another position.

[...] "In all that storm, when flying clouds and spray and driving rain shut us in on every side, I thought of nothing else save of you. No one knows the boat so well as I, and for the last four hours I was lashed to a board, steering. Margharita, all that time, and all the time I stood on the bridge, I seemed to see you always. Sometimes it was the mist of rain and spray which opened to let you through; and sometimes--sometimes I almost fancied that you were by my side. Think of you, Margharita! Why, I was a haunted man. In all that thunder of sea and wind, when <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>use</b> a {{speaking}} trumpet to make my men hear me a few yards away, I could only hear your voice in my ears as distinctly as you hear me now. They say that when one is in danger, or near death, that the imagination is quickened. It must have been so with me, for your presence and the sound of your voice were very real to me." ...|$|E
6000|$|From {{underneath}} the Natural Bridge showed to advantage, {{and if not}} magnificent like the grand Nonnezoshe of Utah, {{it was at least}} striking and beautiful. It had a rounded ceiling colored gray, yellow, green, bronze, purple, white, making a crude and scalloped mosaic. Water dripped from it like a rain of heavy scattered drops. The left side was dryest and large, dark caves opened up, one above the other, the upper being so high that it was dangerous to attempt reaching it. The right side was slippery and wet. All rocks were thickly encrusted with lime salt. Doyle told us that any object left under the ceaseless drip, drip of the lime water would soon become encrusted, and heavy as stone. The upper opening of the arch was much higher and smaller than the lower. Any noise gave forth strange and sepulchral echoes. Romer certainly made the welkin ring. A streak of sunlight shone through a small hole in the thinnest part of the roof. Doyle pointed out the high cave where Indians had once lived, showing the markings of their fire. Also he told a story of Apaches being driven into the highest cave from which they had never escaped. This tale was manifestly to Romer's liking and <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>use</b> force to keep him from risking his neck. A very strong breeze blew under the arch. When we rolled a boulder into the large, dark pool it gave forth a hollow boom, boom, boom, growing hollower the deeper it went. I tried to interest Romer in some bat nests in crevices high up, but the boy wanted to roll stones and fish for the mullet. When we climbed out and were once more on a level I asked him what he thought of the place. [...] "Some hole--I'll say!" [...] he panted, breathlessly.|$|E
6000|$|... "That whitish house {{back there}} among the trees," [...] said he, [...] "with the green blinds, {{is called the}} Witton place. The Wittons {{themselves}} are nuthin' out o' the common; but there's an old lady lives there with 'em, who if you ever meet, you'll know agin, if you see her agin. Her name's Panney,--Miss Panney,--and she's a one-er. What she don't know about me, I don't know, and what she won't know about you, three days after she gits acquainted with you, you don't know. That's {{the kind of a}} person Miss Panney is. There's a lot of very nice people, some rich and some poor, and some queer and some not quite so queer, that lives in and around Thorbury, and if you like it at Mrs. Brinkly's and conclude to stay there any length of time, I don't doubt you'll git acquainted with a good many of 'em; but take my word for it, you'll never meet anybody who can go ahead of Miss Panney in the way of turnin' up unexpected. I once had a sick hoss, who couldn't do much more than stand up, but I had to drive him one day, 'cause my other one was hired out. 'Now' says I, as I drew out the stable, 'if I can get around town this mornin' without meetin' Miss Panney, I think old Bob can do my work, and to-morrow I'll turn him out to grass.' And as I went around the first corner, there was Miss Panney a drivin' her roan mare. She pulled up when she seed me, and she calls out, 'Andy, what's the matter with that hoss?' I told her he was a little under the weather, but <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>use</b> him that day, 'cause my other hoss was out. Then she got straight out of that phaeton she drives in, and come up to my hoss, and says she, 'Andy, you ought to be ashamed of yourself to make a hoss work when he is in a condition like that. Take him right back to your stable, or I'll have you up before a justice.' 'Now look here, Miss Panney,' says I, 'which is the best, for a hoss to jog a little round town when he ain't feeling quite well, or for a man to sit idle on his front doorstep and see his family starve?' 'Now, Andy,' says she, 'is that the case with you?' and havin' brought up the pint myself, I was obliged to say that it was. 'Very good, then,' said she, and she took her roan mare by the head and led it up to the curbstone. 'Now then,' said she, 'you can take your hoss out of the cab and put this hoss in, and you can drive her till your hoss gets well, and durin' that time I'll walk.' ...|$|E
