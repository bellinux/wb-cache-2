40|$|Evaluation of <b>garment</b> <b>bagging</b> is a <b>garment</b> {{standard}} accrediting method as to aim {{for meeting}} with the consumers' demand. This ascertains the appearance/shape retention performances of clothing. Scientists and scholars may encounter difficulties and shortages {{in the selection of}} appropriate testing and evaluation methods of <b>garment</b> <b>bagging.</b> A comprehensive literature review was conducted to investigate the existing evaluation methods of <b>garment</b> <b>bagging</b> and to advance a novel improved evaluation method. It was noted that there are two essential factors for evaluating <b>garment</b> <b>bagging</b> deformation: simulation and measurement. It is important to develop objective evaluation methods and parameters to suit the practical requirement. Under such an aspiration, more practical and effective simulation methods, accurate and precious measurement should be developed along the pathway of the previous investigations.

40|$|The aim of {{this work}} {{is to develop a}} method to {{evaluate}} <b>garment</b> <b>bagging</b> by image processing with different modeling techniques. <b>Garment</b> <b>bagging</b> is a kind of three-dimen sional residual deformation during wear, which can be characterized by a few parameters such as bagging height, volume, shape, and anisotropy. Traditional methods are limited to evalu ating bagging appearance by single parameters such as height, which cannot represent the abundant information given by the appearance of a bagged fabric. In this paper, we develop a method to evaluate fabric bagging from captured images of bagged fabrics by image processing and abstracting the criteria to recognize bagging magnitude. Based on an analysis of the intensity images, eight criteria are extracted to characterize the image features including bagging height, volume, and shape, and fabric surface patterns on bagging appearance. The criteria are used as variables in three predictive models. The work shows that bagging appearance can be predicted by the criteria extracted from the images of bagged fabrics.

5000|$|On Wednesday, December 5, 2012, Trotter {{was charged}} with [...] "attempt to board an {{aircraft}} with a weapon", which is normally a Class 4 felony, after Transportation Security Administration (TSA) agents found a [...]25 caliber Beretta handgun and magazine loaded with six live rounds, which were in the outer pocket of a <b>garment</b> <b>bag.</b> The incident occurred at Chicago's O'Hare International Airport, as Senator Trotter was attempting to board a flight to Washington, D.C. Trotter was held in police custody pending an appearance in bond court the following day, Thursday, December 6. On December 6, a Cook county judge set bond for Trotter at $25,000. Trotter was released after posting $2,500 bail. Trotter's next court appearance was scheduled for Wednesday, December 12, 2012. The Class 4 felony with which Trotter was charged normally carries a sentencing range of one {{to three years in}} prison if he is convicted of that charge, and under U.S. and Illinois laws, conviction of a felony normally prohibits someone, at least for a time (depending upon the seriousness of the felony), from holding public office. However, on Wednesday, April 24, 2013, Thomas Durkin, Trotter's attorney, stated that his client had entered a guilty plea, in a plea deal approved by the judge, to a misdemeanor count of reckless conduct (Trotter allegedly had worked a part-time security job, and had forgotten that the weapon was in a <b>garment</b> <b>bag).</b> The misdemeanor plea allows him to keep his job without fear of impeachment or removal, and the conviction will be stricken if Senator Trotter completes a year of non-reporting court supervision.|$|E

50|$|Humboldt Cave is a dry cave {{which was}} first {{excavated}} by archeologists in 1936. The cave's environment preserved artifacts including fiber and skin <b>garments,</b> <b>bags</b> and mats. Other artifacts {{found in the}} cave have documented contact with cultures in what are now Arizona and California. The cave was formed by vertical faulting in a cliff face, which was periodically flooded by Lake Lahontan. The flooding deposited tufa over the cave's surfaces, preserving them from erosion. The remains of the lake, now known as Humboldt Sink, are 220 ft below the cave, 6 mi away. The cave opening is about 8 ft high and 6 ft wide, widening to 8 ft inside, with a depth of about 49 ft. In addition to humans, the cave was also inhabited by bats, whose guano was 3 ft to 6 ft in depth on the cave's floor before excavation.|$|R
