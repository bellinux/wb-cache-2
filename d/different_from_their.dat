5|$|Domesticated rats are physiologically {{and psychologically}} <b>different</b> <b>from</b> <b>their</b> wild relatives, and—when {{acquired}} from reputable breeders and shops—pose {{no more of}} a health risk than other common pets. For example, domesticated brown rats are not considered a disease threat, while exposure to wild rat populations could introduce pathogens like Salmonella into the home. Fancy rats experience different health risks from their wild counterparts, and thus {{are less likely to}} succumb to many of the same illnesses as wild rats.|$|E
5|$|The cottage {{garden in}} France is a {{development}} of the early 20th century. Monet's garden at Giverny is a prominent example, a sprawling garden full of varied plantings, rich colors, and water gardens. In modern times, the term 'cottage garden' is used to describe any number of informal garden styles, using design and plants very <b>different</b> <b>from</b> <b>their</b> traditional English cottage garden origins. Examples include regional variations using a grass prairie scheme (in the American midwest) and California chaparral cottage gardens.|$|E

5|$|When {{asked by}} emperor Frederick to {{also join the}} Swabian League, the Eidgenossen flatly refused: they {{saw no reason to}} join an {{alliance}} designed to further Habsburg interests, and they were wary of this new, relatively closely knit and powerful alliance that had arisen on their northern frontier. Furthermore, they resented the strong aristocratic element in the Swabian League, so <b>different</b> <b>from</b> <b>their</b> own organization, which had grown over the last two hundred years liberating themselves from precisely such an aristocratic rule.|$|E
5|$|Echoes, Silence, Patience & Grace is {{the sixth}} studio album by rock band Foo Fighters, {{released}} on September 25, 2007 by RCA Records. The album is noted for {{a blend of}} regular rock and acoustic tracks with shifting dynamics, which emerged from the variety of styles employed on the demos the band produced. It also marks the second time the band worked with producer Gil Norton, whom frontman Dave Grohl brought to fully explore the potential of his compositions and have a record that sounded <b>different</b> <b>from</b> <b>their</b> previous work. Grohl {{tried to focus on}} songs with messages that resonated on the audience, writing reflective lyrics which drew inspiration from the birth of his daughter.|$|E
5|$|Theoretical {{understanding}} of {{condensed matter physics}} {{is closely related to}} the notion of emergence, wherein complex assemblies of particles behave in ways dramatically <b>different</b> <b>from</b> <b>their</b> individual constituents. For example, a range of phenomena related to high temperature superconductivity are understood poorly, although the microscopic physics of individual electrons and lattices is well known. Similarly, models of condensed matter systems have been studied where collective excitations behave like photons and electrons, thereby describing electromagnetism as an emergent phenomenon. Emergent properties can also occur at the interface between materials: one example is the lanthanum aluminate-strontium titanate interface, where two non-magnetic insulators are joined to create conductivity, superconductivity, and ferromagnetism.|$|E

5|$|From {{the late}} 15th century, {{a number of}} {{painters}} emphasised landscape in their works, a development led {{in part by the}} shift in preference from religious iconography to secular subjects. Second-generation Netherlandish painters applied the mid-14th-century dictum of natural representation. This was born of the rising affluence of the region's middle class, many of whom had now travelled south and seen countryside noticeably <b>different</b> <b>from</b> <b>their</b> flat homeland. At the same time, the later part of the century saw the emergence of specialisation and a number of masters focused on detailing landscape, most notably Konrad Witz in the mid-15th century, and later Joachim Patinir. Most innovations in this format came from artists living in the Dutch regions of the Burgundian lands, most notably from Haarlem, Leiden and 's-Hertogenbosch. The significant artists from these areas did not slavishly reproduce the scenery before them, but in subtle ways adapted and modified their landscapes to reinforce the emphasis and meaning of the panel they were working on.|$|E
5|$|In November 1987, Warner Bros. Records {{commissioned}} {{the release of}} You Can Dance—Madonna's first retrospective—which was aimed at the dance segment of her audience. It was an album containing seven of Madonna's songs in remixed format, which was still a revolutionary concept in the 1980s. By the mid-eighties, post-disco dance music was extremely popular {{and the concept of}} remix was widely regarded as a new direction of music. Several artists were remixing their tracks and compiling them to create new albums. Mixing was an interpretative process, where the artist was usually involved, but the development was generally looked after the record producer. The different parts of a song, including the lead vocals, background vocals, guitars, bass, synths, drum machine—all went through the process of mixing to sound considerably <b>different</b> <b>from</b> <b>their</b> original counterpart. Mixing determined how loud these instruments were going to sound in relation to each other and what particular sound effects should be added to each instrument. Improvements in studio technologies meant the possibility of shaping the sound of a song in any way, after it has been recorded. The arrangements were itself created at the mixing stage, rather than being created previously. A particular vocal phrase could be endlessly copied, repeated, chopped up, transposed up and down in pitch and give them more echo, reverberation, treble or bass.|$|E

40|$|As {{potential}} mismatches between teachers’ and students’ perceptions {{can have}} {{negative effects on}} students’ satisfaction with the language class and even on their ultimate achievement, many researchers have attempted to identify and examine possible sources of such mismatches. In line with those investigations, the present study intended to compare the perceptions held by Iranian English as a Foreign Language (EFL) public school teachers with those of their students. To this aim, a convenient sample of teachers (N = 75) and students (N = 202) <b>from</b> <b>different</b> cities of Iran was recruited {{to participate in the}} study. Using a 50 -item Likert-type questionnaire and running between-groups independent-samples t tests and a two-way ANOVA, the researchers found that students’ perceptions were completely <b>different</b> <b>from</b> those of <b>their</b> teachers. Contrary to expectations, while students preferred a communicative approach to learning English, their teachers tended to favor a more traditional approach. Also, although high- and low-achieving students’ perceptions were not statistically different, they were significantly <b>different</b> <b>from</b> those of <b>their</b> teachers. Moreover, male teachers held <b>different</b> perceptions <b>from</b> <b>their</b> female students, and female teachers’ perceptions were also <b>different</b> <b>from</b> those of <b>their</b> male students. Findings of the study along with their implications for the practice of English teaching are also discussed...|$|R
