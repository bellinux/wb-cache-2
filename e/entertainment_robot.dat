40|$|Abstract: In {{the early}} years of robotics, an {{industrial}} robot was developed, but in these days, an <b>entertainment</b> <b>robot</b> is emerging as a new type of a robot. The design methodologies for industrial robots were based on the task or the function of the robots. However, because the purpose of an <b>entertainment</b> <b>robot</b> is to stimulate people’s emotion rather than to provide function, it is needed to be designed using different methodology from that of an industrial robot. In this paper, we define an <b>entertainment</b> <b>robot</b> as an autonomous robot, which interacts with people or environment in human’s daily life with entertaining purpose. As you can see from the definition of an <b>entertainment</b> <b>robot,</b> <b>entertainment</b> <b>robot</b> needs to have better interaction with people. In order to design an <b>entertainment</b> <b>robot</b> with better interaction, human’s interaction and communication cues should be inserted into robots ’ mind model. Especially in case of entertainment robots, needed interaction and communication way is more focused on the emotional one rather than functional one. In this paper, in order to give an <b>entertainment</b> <b>robot</b> emotional social cues, we suggest a process to design a robot’s personality based on temperaments, which drives from psychological types, and for people to get involved in forming an entertainment robot’s personality, we propose ‘personality growth model’. The design methodology for constructing an entertainment robot’s personality will make the development process of an entertainment robot’s personality more efficient by providing criteria of possible personalities of robots...|$|E

40|$|Research in Human-Robot {{interaction}} {{stresses the}} importance of non verbal behaviours in order to enforce credibility and believability in robots. When using small and cheap <b>entertainment</b> <b>robots,</b> verbal cues are very limited, gaze and facial gestures can be absent, whereas body gestures comprise – {{as a matter of fact}} – only stereotyped behaviours. The main contribution of this article is an evaluation study about the effects of pure body gestures when <b>entertainment</b> <b>robots</b> are observed by humans in an interaction process. Robots are required to execute a sequence of behaviours, as if they were playing on a stage. To this aim, a model for composing behaviour primitives for <b>entertainment</b> humanoid <b>robots</b> using AND/OR graphs is presented. Both single and multi robot scenarios are considered. The framework can sequence robot behaviours using complex scripts, which can be easily programmed using standard ontology-based knowledge representation mechanisms. Procedures are used to operate on the ontology representation in order to execute behaviours in a fully hierarchical and recursive fashion. Experimental validation with an interview campaign has been carried out using toy Kondo robots...|$|R

40|$|This thesis {{report is}} {{submitted}} in partial {{fulfillment of the}} requirements for the degree of Bachelor of Science in Electrical and Electronic Engineering, 2015. Cataloged from PDF version of thesis report. Includes bibliographical references (page 52). This project presents in detail an electrically operated mechanical robotic system based on an animated character of Pixar’s WALL-E (2008). The replica’s boxy physical structure is built using plywood mounted on top of track wheel which is a complex mechanical combination of parts like teethed wheel, metallic frames and some soft PVC wood casted shapes driven by 2 independent single shaft geared DC motor. The movements of the arms and neck are attained {{with the help of}} servo-motors. This sophisticated <b>entertainment</b> <b>robot</b> has features like its head pivots realistically; movement of different body parts, and also some supplementary enhancements incorporated such as giving WALL-E some vocal through audio system. The main focus of our work is developing a life-size meticulous Arduino-based <b>entertainment</b> <b>robot</b> entirely from custom-fabricated parts with distinctive features which can be controlled wirelessly, motivated from the animated character and as a constant reminder of how we should deal with our technologies without hampering the regular order of our personal and sociocultural life, we strived for building a life-size robotic structure of WALL-E to keep our conscience ever functional.
