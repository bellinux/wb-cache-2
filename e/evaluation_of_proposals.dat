Following {{an evaluation of the}} technical complexity of this task, the strategy was adjusted and on December 23, 2005, the OSTP issued a memorandum directing NASA to implement the Landsat 8 {{in the form of a}} free-flyer spacecraft carrying an instrument referred to as the Operational Land Imager (OLI).

40|$|While {{the demand}} for the {{performance}} <b>evaluation</b> <b>of</b> <b>proposals</b> using real hardware is ever increasing, the lineup of wireless testbeds focuses on IEEE 802. 11 -based WLAN, and lacks cellular communication environments despite of their popularity. We argue that research community needs a wireless testbed targeted on cellular technologies. To this end, this paper proposes a novel wireless testbed, dubbed Cell-Lab, which is developed to evaluate {{a wide spectrum of}} proposals in cellular environments. Cell-Lab resolves a cost problem, which is a decisive barrier to the deployment of cellular network testbed, by adopting a low-cost femtocell base station instead of conventional one. To support both virtualization and programmability as basic features, we integrate all the cellular network entities into a femtocell base station, and introduce a separate controller that performs virtualization and controls a femtocell base station. By means of Cell-Lab, researchers will be able to experiment their proposals under realistic cellular network conditions [...] INTRODUCTIONช A recent trend in the networking research area is the increasing demand on the performance <b>evaluation</b> <b>of</b> <b>proposals</b> by real prototypes or testbeds. That is, we need to run proposals on network testbeds for realistic evaluation. Ther...|$|E

40|$|An ethnographic and {{linguistic}} study conducted at a high-technology corporation examined decision-making in managerial meetings, {{focusing on the}} effects of silences following a proposal on the maker <b>of</b> the <b>proposal.</b> An opinion is that such silences signify a negative <b>evaluation</b> <b>of</b> the <b>proposal,</b> inviting the proposal maker to alter his position. Observation of meetings took place over 16 months. First, the form and dynamics of decision-making in this context are described, noting that when a negative <b>evaluation</b> <b>of</b> a <b>proposal</b> is given, the group's activity becomes more complex, generally eliciting a "reversal " from one or more participant. A key theme examined here is avoidance of direct disagreement, which the researcher proposes is signified by silence. Silences appeared to carry three neanings in the meetings examined: thought in progress; confusion; and disagreement. Analysis of the activities afte...|$|R
