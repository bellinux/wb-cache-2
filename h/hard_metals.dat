Clinically, the condition resembles hypersensitivity pneumonitis, with subacute presentations and possible evolution to pulmonary fibrosis.

Cobalt is the critical toxic component causing <b>hard</b> <b>metal</b> lung disease, hence also the term cobalt-lung. <b>Hard</b> <b>metal</b> lung disease is more likely to occur in poorly regulated workplaces, but its occurrence depends mainly on individual susceptibility, rather than on cumulative exposure, so that even young subjects may be affected. status: publishe...|$|R

40|$|OBJECTIVES: To study {{individual}} {{effects on}} pulmonary function {{of exposure to}} <b>hard</b> <b>metal</b> including cobalt. METHODS: All of the workers in a <b>hard</b> <b>metal</b> company (583 men and 120 women) were examined for smoking, respiratory symptoms, ventilatory function, occupational history of exposure to <b>hard</b> <b>metal,</b> and present exposure to airborne cobalt. The ventilatory function indices (forced vital capacity (FVC), forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV 1), forced expiratory volume in one second per cent (FEV 1 %), peak expiratory flow (PEF), mid-maximal flow (MMF), forced expiratory flow at 50 % vital capacity (V 50), forced expiratory flow at 25 % vital capacity (V 25)) were standardised for height and age and expressed {{as a percentage of}} predicted values. RESULTS: Two way analysis of variance of indices of ventilatory function showed that an interaction of <b>hard</b> <b>metal</b> exposure and smoking decreased %V 50 for both men and women. Among the currently exposed men, those with asthmatic symptoms (defined as reversible dispnoea with wheeze) had significantly lower %FVC, %FEV 1 %, %PEF, %MMF, %V 50, and %V 25 than did workers without asthma. The ventilatory disfunction did not differ between exposed and non-exposed workers with asthmatic symptoms. Even among the men without asthmatic symptoms, %V 50 was significantly lowered by the interaction of <b>hard</b> <b>metal</b> exposure and smoking. The multilinear regression analysis of indices of ventilatory function for all of the subjects on sex, smoking (Brinkman index), exposure to <b>hard</b> <b>metal,</b> and asthmatic symptoms showed that asthmatic symptoms and smoking had significant effects on all variables and that the decrease in %V 25 was associated with <b>hard</b> <b>metal</b> exposure. In the currently exposed and non-exposed workers, multilinear regression analysis applying indices for cobalt exposure (mean cobalt concentration, duration of exposure, and cumulative dose) showed that not only asthmatic symptoms or smoking but also duration of exposure had significant decreasing effects on %FVC, %MMF, and %V 25.

40|$|<b>Hard</b> <b>metal</b> alloys (or {{cemented}} carbides) {{are made}} of a mixture of tungsten carbide particles (WC, more than 80 %) cemented in cobalt metal powder (Co, 5 - 10 %). The inhalation of <b>hard</b> <b>metal</b> particles may cause an interstitial pulmonary disease, the mechanism of which involves an interaction between Co and WC particles. Some epidemiological data also suggest that <b>hard</b> <b>metal</b> dust can induce lung cancer in workers. In a macrophage culture model, butylated hydroxytoluene (1 mM) protected from the cytotoxicity of <b>hard</b> <b>metal</b> particles, suggesting a possible involvement of lipid peroxidation in the toxicity of these powders. In a biochemical system, a mixture of Co and WC particles, but not Co or WC alone, stimulated the production of thiobarbituric acid-reactive substances from arachidonic acid. Using a spin trapping system applied to aqueous particulate suspensions and electrochemical techniques, we present experimental evidence that the association of Co and carbide particles represents a specific toxic entity producing large amounts of activated oxygen species. The mechanism of this interaction proceeds through the oxidation of cobalt metal catalyzed at the surface of carbide particles and resulting in the reduction of dissolved oxygen.

40|$|OBJECTIVES—To {{study the}} {{mortality}} from lung cancer from exposures to <b>hard</b> <b>metal</b> dust at an industrial site producing hard metals—pseudoalloys of cobalt and tungsten carbide—and other metallurgical products {{many of which}} contain cobalt.  METHODS—A historical cohort was set up of all subjects {{who had worked for}} at least 3  months on the site since its opening date in the late 1940 s. A full job history could be obtained for 95 % of the subjects. The cohort was followed up from January 1968  to December 1992.  The exposure was assessed by an industry specific job exposure matrix (JEM) characterising exposure to <b>hard</b> <b>metal</b> dust from 1  to 9  and other possibly carcinogenic exposures as present or absent. Smoking information was obtained by interview of former workers. Standard lifetable methods and Poisson regression were used for the statistical analysis of the data.  RESULTS—Mortality from all causes was close to the expected (standardised mortality ratio (SMR) 1. 02,  399  deaths) whereas mortality from lung cancer was significantly increased among men (SMR 1. 70; 46  deaths, 95 % confidence interval (95 % CI) 1. 24  to 2. 26). By workshop, lung cancer mortality was significantly higher than expected in <b>hard</b> <b>metal</b> production before sintering (SMR 2. 42; nine deaths; 95 %CI 1. 10  to 4. 59) and among maintenance workers (SMR 2. 56; 11  deaths; 95 %CI 1. 28  to 4. 59), whereas after sintering the SMR was lower (SMR 1. 28; five deaths; 95 %CI 0. 41  to 2. 98). The SMR for all exposures to <b>hard</b> <b>metal</b> dust at a level > 1 in the JEM was in significant excess (SMR 2. 02; 26  deaths; 95 %CI 1. 32  to 2. 96). The risks increased with exposure scores, duration of exposure, and cumulative dose reaching significance for duration of exposure to <b>hard</b> <b>metal</b> dust before sintering, after adjustment for smoking and known or suspected carcinogens.  CONCLUSION—Excess mortality from lung cancer was found among <b>hard</b> <b>metal</b> production workers which cannot be attributed to smoking alone. This excess occurred mostly in subjects exposed to unsintered <b>hard</b> <b>metal</b> dust.    Keywords: lung cancer; <b>hard</b> <b>metal...</b>|$|R
40|$|OBJECTIVES: To {{elucidate}} {{factors contributing}} to <b>hard</b> <b>metal</b> asthma, the entire workforce of a corporation producing <b>hard</b> <b>metal</b> tools (n = 703) was examined. METHODS: The variables evaluated were the atopy reflected by immunoglobulin E (IgE) antibody against mite allergen, history of exposure to <b>hard</b> <b>metal,</b> smoking, concentration of airborne cobalt, specific IgE antibody reaction against cobalt, and the respiratory symptom of attacks of reversible dyspnoea with wheeze (asthmatic symptoms). RESULTS: Univariate analysis showed that the prevalence of the asthmatic symptoms was significantly higher in formerly and currently exposed male workers than in non-exposed male workers. Positive IgE reaction against cobalt was found in seven men (2. 0 %), {{all of whom had}} asthmatic symptoms. Furthermore, it was found that atopy, positive IgE antibody against cobalt, and age of 40 or older were significantly correlated with asthmatic symptoms. Multilogistic analysis on the same factors and smoking in all of the workers showed that the age, experience of <b>hard</b> <b>metal</b> exposure, and atopy were significant risk factors associated with the asthmatic symptoms. Multilogistic analysis of data for currently exposed and non-exposed workers also showed that age and atopy were risk factors, and that the exposure to cobalt at the low concentration (at or below 50 micrograms/m 3) but not at the higher concentration was a significant risk factor. Exposure to mist of coolants containing ionic cobalt, used during grinding, was not found to be any more hazardous in terms of onset of asthmatic symptoms than exposure to <b>hard</b> <b>metal</b> dust containing metallic cobalt. CONCLUSIONS: Accordingly, it is concluded that both environmental factors and individual susceptibility should be taken into consideration in efforts to reduce the prevalence of <b>hard</b> <b>metal</b> asthma...|$|R
