30|$|Although these {{interventions}} {{are based on}} thoughtful and well-researched models of hope, and they have become popular in recent years, their effectiveness has not been adequately examined (Kirschman, Johnson, Bender, & Roberts, 2009). Before these strategies are recommended {{as a way to}} reduce psychological distress, cope with <b>illness</b> <b>or</b> <b>loss,</b> <b>or</b> improve the lives of adults and children, it is necessary to demonstrate that hope is, indeed, a malleable construct, that hope enhancement strategies can increase hopeful cognitions, and that these strategies are associated with symptom reduction or improvement in subjective well-being. Without such evidence, it may be premature to recommend these hope enhancement strategies for clinic-referred individuals, persons coping with medical <b>illness</b> <b>or</b> interpersonal <b>loss,</b> <b>or</b> members of the general community.|$|R

Stephen saw his fortunes decline during a series of economic depressions, leading {{to the collapse of}} his merchant trade in Paris. Eliza, however, managed their American estate and holdings with a good business acumen, and proved an astute investor. She made herself unpopular as a businesswoman in New York, however. Several of Stephen's business acquaintances were dishonest with his finances during the Jumel's absence, and it became Eliza's task to both make accusations and recoup money lost. Through her initiative, the couples' finances were saved from ruin. [...] The couple continued to travel between New York, Paris, and Stephen's family home in Bordeaux. During these travels, Eliza amassed a large and respected art collection, often considered the first great collection of European Art in North America.|$|R

50|$|The fury of {{the people}} seemed to know no bounds. Tiberius refused to return to Rome but ended his days in Capri in 37, at age 77. The empire was left without direction. There was no {{suitable}} successor to Tiberius. He willed the imperium to the joint rule of Caligula and Tiberius Gemellus. Caligula's first move was to alter Tiberius' will. Then he assassinated his co-emperor. Leaning heavily {{on the advice of}} the Guard he was for several months a good and popular emperor. After a near-fatal episode of <b>either</b> <b>illness</b> <b>or</b> poisoning his behavior became deranged, which is often accounted for by authors both modern and ancient as a result of brain damage. In 41 he was assassinated by a general governmental conspiracy, which agreed that his reign could not continue. On that same night, probably the one mentioned by Quintus Curtius Rufus, the Senate debated the abolition of the principate. The Praetorian Guard intervened to propose the election of Claudius, Livilla's brother, which was accepted with gratitude.|$|R

RESULTS: Thirty-one percent of patients with diabetes were diagnosed with <b>either</b> mental <b>illness</b> <b>or</b> substance use and had higher rates of diabetes-related complications.

30|$|Herth's {{model has}} also been used to guide {{interventions}} in nursing and medicine (Kylma et al., 2009; Schrank, Stanghellini, & Slade, 2008). The Hope Intervention Program (Herth, 2001) draws heavily on Herth's model to improve the coping strategies {{and quality of life}} of individuals with cancer and other serious illnesses. The program is administered in small groups, facilitated by trained mental health or nurse practitioners. Components of the program target the theoretical dimensions of hope. For example, participants are taught to set personally-meaningful and plausible goals, to break these goals into manageable steps, and to flexibly modify these steps in the face of setbacks or obstacles. Furthermore, like Snyder's hope enhancement strategies, participants are encouraged to share stories about challenges in their own lives (or in the lives of family members or friends) and to explore how these challenges show courage and optimism. Finally, considerable time is spent fostering a sense of community within the group, encouraging participants to draw upon others for support outside the group, and helping participants find meaning in their <b>illness</b> <b>or</b> <b>loss.</b>|$|R

At that time {{he was also a}} member of Friedrich Naumann's National-Social Association. In 1906 {{he was elected to the}} Dresden town council. Though he had initially worked in trade associations, Stresemann soon became a leader of the National Liberal Party in Saxony. In 1907, he was elected to the Reichstag, where he soon became a close associate of party chairman Ernst Bassermann. However, his support of expanded social-welfare programs didn't sit well with some of the party's more conservative members, and he lost his post in the party's executive committee in 1912. Later that year he lost both his Reichstag and town council seats. He returned to business and founded the German-American Economic Association. In 1914 he returned to the Reichstag. He was exempted from war service due to poor health. With Bassermann kept away from the Reichstag by <b>either</b> <b>illness</b> <b>or</b> military service, Stresemann soon became the National Liberals' de facto leader.

The adolescent period {{is characterized by}} changes in social roles and expectations that may interact with biological changes or psychosocial stressors. Few studies focus on the adolescents’ own reports of perceived risk factors. To assess differences at age 16 between persons who later develop psychotic disorders (“Confirmed Psychosis”, CP) and their class-mates (“Population Controls”, PC) we collected information on: (1) Social support factors (size of social network and expectancies of social support from friends), (2) Cognitive functioning (concentrating in the classroom, actual grades and expectancies of own academic achievements) and (3) Problems and stressors in families (<b>illness</b> <b>or</b> <b>loss</b> of work for parents), and in relationship with others (exposure to bullying, violence or sexual violation). Self-reported data from students at 15 – 16 years of age were linked to the case-registers from the “Thematically Organized Psychosis (TOP) Study”.
