6000|$|The personages here {{mentioned}} {{are most}} of them characters of historical fame; but those less known and remembered {{may be found in}} the tract entitled, 'The Judgment and Justice of God Exemplified, or, a Brief Historical Account of some of the Wicked Lives and Miserable Deaths {{of some of the most}} remarkable Apostates and Bloody Persecutors, from the Reformation till after the Revolution.' This constitutes a sort of postscript or appendix to John Howie of Lochgoin's 'Account of the Lives of the most eminent Scots Worthies.' The author has, with considerable ingenuity, reversed his reasoning upon the inference to be drawn from the prosperity or misfortunes which befall individuals in this world, either in the course of their lives or in the hour of death. In the account of the martyrs' sufferings, such inflictions are mentioned only as trials permitted by providence, for the better and brighter display of their faith, and constancy of principle. But when similar afflictions befell the opposite party, they are imputed to the direct vengeance of Heaven upon their impiety. If, indeed, the life of any person obnoxious to the historian's censures happened to have passed in unusual prosperity, the mere fact of its being finally concluded by <b>death,</b> <b>is</b> <b>assumed</b> as an undeniable token of the judgement of Heaven, and, to render the conclusion inevitable, his last scene is generally garnished with some singular circumstances. Thus the Duke of Lauderdale is said, through old age but immense corpulence, to have become so sunk in spirits, 'that his heart was not the bigness of a walnut.' ...|$|E

50|$|Luther {{travelled}} on 23 January 1546 from Halle to Eisleben on {{a mission}} to solve an inheritance dispute in the House of Mansfeld. This mediation was protracted and in the meantime Luther was tormented by cramps in his chest.Luther anticipated his death many days beforehand because he was increasingly suffering many heart attacks. By 17 February 1546 the inheritance dispute had finally been resolved and at dinner that day Luther commented he would finally lie down to sleep in his coffin and allow the worms to have a good meal. The pain in his chest continued to worsen and many medications were tried on him, but to no avail. In his last hours more than twenty people were with him, including his son Paul Luther. The theologian Justus Jonas documented his death. Luther recited prayers, begged the Lord to take his soul and then his senses faded. On 18 February 1546, Luther {{died at the age of}} 63 years.

40|$|Two quasi-experiments {{are used}} to {{estimate}} the impact of parental divorce on the adult incomes and labour market behaviour of adolescents, {{as well as on}} their use of social programs, and their marital/fertility behaviour. These involve the use of individuals experiencing the death of a parent, and legislative changes to the Canadian divorce law in 1986. Parental loss by <b>death</b> <b>is</b> <b>assumed</b> to be exogenous; the experience of children with a bereaved background offering a benchmark to assess the endogeneity of parental loss through divorce. Differences between individuals with divorced parents and those from intact and bereaved families significantly overstate the impact of divorce across a broad range of outcomes. When background characteristics are controlled for - most notably the income and labour market activity of parents in the years leading up to the divorce - parental divorce seems to influence the marital decisions of adolescents, but not their labour market outcomes. Adolescents whose parents divorced tend to put off marriage, and once married suffer a greater likelihood of marital instability, but their earnings and incomes are not on average much different from others. ...|$|E
40|$|Sacrifice often connotes {{death or}} {{some form of}} lack within popular discourse. The {{association}} of sacrifice with <b>death</b> <b>is</b> <b>assumed</b> in some strains of the Christian tradition that employ sacrifice within a penal substitutionary account of the atonement. In this framework, sacrifice is understood as death {{for the purposes of}} punishment. This dissertation challenges the identification of sacrifice with death. It presents a reinterpretation of sacrifice through a canonical and literary reading of Old and New Testament texts. Sacrificial practice displayed in Leviticus and Hebrews suggests that sacrifice is oriented at life rather than at death. Specifically, sacrifice in Leviticus aims toward a reinstatement of the good order of creation displayed in Genesis 1. The telos of the Levitical cult is humanity’s redemption and creation’s restoration. Both are achieved on the Day of Atonement described in Leviticus 16 as a Sabbath. Hebrews expands upon the sacrificial logic of Leviticus in presenting Christ’s resurrection as the perfection of the cult. Christ’s sacrifice is his resurrected body, not his death. Christians are called to participate in Christ’s sacrifice, and discipleship assumes a form that challenges society’s deathly sacrifices. Dissertatio...|$|E

Bycatch discards would be estimated by estimating the percent of fish that are captured in a certain gear and the mortality associated with being captured in this gear. These mortality studies are generally done by using cages for {{a certain period of}} time following capture to determine the percentage of fish that die during being held in holding cages.

40|$|Oxysterols are 27 -carbon atom {{molecules}} {{resulting from}} autoxidation or enzymatic oxidation of cholesterol. They {{are present in}} numerous foodstuffs and have been demonstrated to be present at increased levels in the plasma of patients with cardiovascular diseases and in atherosclerotic lesions. Thus, their role in lipid disorders is widely suspected, and they might also be involved in important degenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's disease, osteoporosis, and age-related macular degeneration. Since atherosclerosis {{is associated with the}} presence of apoptotic cells and with oxidative and inflammatory processes, the ability of some oxysterols, especially 7 -ketocholesterol and 7 &# 946;-hydroxycholesterol, to trigger cell death, activate inflammation, and modulate lipid homeostasis is being extensively studied, especially in vitro. Thus, since {{there are a number of}} essential considerations regarding the physiological/pathophysiological functions and activities of the different oxysterols, it is important to determine their biological activities and identify their signaling pathways, when they are used either alone or as mixtures. Oxysterols may have cytotoxic, oxidative, and/or inflammatory effects, or none whatsoever. Moreover, a substantial accumulation of polar lipids in cytoplasmic multilamellar structures has been observed with cytotoxic oxysterols, suggesting that cytotoxic oxysterols are potent inducers of phospholipidosis. This basic knowledge about oxysterols contributes to a better understanding of the associated pathologies and may lead to new treatments and new drugs. Since oxysterols have a number of biological activities, and as oxysterol-induced cell <b>death</b> <b>is</b> <b>assumed</b> to take part in degenerative pathologies, the present review will focus on the cytotoxic activities of these compounds, the corresponding cell death signaling pathways, and associated events (oxidation, inflammation, and phospholipidosis) ...|$|E
30|$|In {{contrast}} to the other ground tissues, the mesodermis is composed of four to five cell layers in the radicle, which will differentiate into a lysigenous–schizogenous aerenchyma with intercellular spaces that develop into large lacunae. First, during mesodermis differentiation, the cells become round and spaces between cells are generated. These intercellular spaces are called schizogenous spaces. Later, programmed cell death of mesodermal cells produces cellular spaces called lysigenous spaces. Lysogeny results in a typical radial morphology that includes strands of surviving cortical cells separated by gas spaces [23]. Aerenchyma {{is regarded as a}} tissue that is devoted to gas exchange from the shoot and acts as a reservoir of oxygen that is required for root respiration under flooding conditions. Development of the aerenchyma is observed in several aquatic plants species and can also be induced by submergence or anoxia in maize [87]. In comparison, aerenchyma formation is constitutive in rice, and cell <b>death</b> <b>is</b> <b>assumed</b> to represent a part of the developmental process. The aerenchyma is visible in all rice root types, excluding the small lateral roots that possess no mesodermis layer. Finally, the innermost cell layer of the ground tissue system is the endodermis. Endodermal cells contain the Casparian strip, which is made of suberin and surrounds the entire cell. The Casparian strip was more developed when the roots were grown in soil but remained poorly developed when the roots were fostered under hydroponic conditions. Endodermal cells represent a resistant apoplastic barrier to water and nutrition flow and are known to ensure selective transfer through cell symplasts between the mesodermis and the central cylinder (Fig.  3 b).|$|E

Moreover, this procedure allows us to establish the nature (or, at least, the prevalent effect) of a single therapy in vivo. To accomplish this, we suggest a criterion based on the Kullback–Leibler divergence (or relative entropy). Some simulation studies are performed and an application to real data is presented...|$|R
40|$|Stroke is a {{major cause}} of death and {{disability}} worldwide. Therapeutic hypothermia is a potentially useful neuroprotective treatment. A mathematical model of brain metabolism during stroke is extended here to simulate the effect of hypothermia on cell survival. Temperature decreases were set to reduce chemical reaction rates and slow diffusion through ion channels according to the Q 10 rule. Heat delivery to tissues was set to depend on metabolic heat generation rate and perfusion. Two cooling methods, scalp and vascular, were simulated to approximate temperature variation in the brain during treatment. Cell <b>death</b> <b>was</b> <b>assumed</b> to occur at continued cell membrane depolarization.
