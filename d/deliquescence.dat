Microscopically, it is characterized by the long, gold-pigmented, thick-walled setae on the cap, and ellipsoid spores with a germ pore. The distinctly grooved and pleated cap margin indicates that it is allied with the coprinoid species and not with the genus Psathyrella. Similar Parasola species include the common and widespread P.plicatilis, P.leiocephala, P.lilatincta, and P.kuehneri. Only microscopy will definitively separate these from P.auricoma—none of them have setae on the cap.|$|E

500|$|Coprinellus micaceus is {{a common}} species of fungus in the family Psathyrellaceae with a {{cosmopolitan}} distribution. The fruit bodies of the saprobe typically grow in clusters on or near rotting hardwood tree stumps or underground tree roots. Depending on their stage of development, the tawny-brown mushroom caps may range in shape from oval to bell-shaped to convex, and reach diameters up to [...] The caps, marked with fine radial grooves that extend nearly to the center, rest atop whitish stems up to [...] long. In young specimens, the entire cap surface is coated with a fine layer of reflective mica-like cells that provide the inspiration for both the mushroom's species name and the common names mica cap, shiny cap, and glistening inky cap. Although small and with thin flesh, the mushrooms are usually bountiful, as they typically grow in dense clusters. A few hours after collection, the gills will begin to slowly dissolve into a black, inky, spore-laden liquid—an enzymatic process called autodigestion or <b>deliquescence.</b> The fruit bodies are edible before the gills blacken and dissolve, and cooking will stop the autodigestion process.|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACTS IN ENGLISH Charles Baudelaire : Anthropology and Poetics					 The life of Man is {{exile in}} a hostile land, where {{original}} harmony is corrupted and broken down. In the work of art, these heterogeneous fragments are composed by means of Imagination, and the original unity of the cosmos is restored. Baudelaire translates this idea of man and of art into rhetoric which merges heterogeneous parts of language into stylistic figures (such as thematic association, paysage d’âme, allegory, etc.) which will later become typical of Symbolist literature. Les <b>Déliquescences.</b> Poèmes décadents d’Adoré Floupette. 	 Introduction. The collection Les <b>Déliquescences</b> offers a parody of mannerisms in Symbolist literature, particularly syntactical acrobatics, metrical virtuosity, and sinister motifs. The two designations Symbolisme and Décadentisme actually refer to a single literary movement. Rimbaud from the Lettre du Voyant to the Bateau ivre					 The theoretical text Lettre du Voyant and the narrative poem Le Bateau ivre share the same argumentative structure. It takes another {{two years before the}} revolution of poetry advocated by Rimbaud in these two texts is extended from semantic structures to versification. Bateau ivre is in fact moulded out of a still typically Parnassian metrical form. Rimbaud, Une saison en enfer, « Adieu ». On Essentiality			 The beginning of Adieu shows a stylistic feature that frequently occurs in Rimbaud’s poetry : the reduction of a syntagm to its factual core by the elimination of anything that derives from subjective perception. This feature reflects his idea that poetry should aim to tell the essence of things About Le Loup criait sous les feuilles by Arthur Rimbaud			 Le loup criait sous les feuilles presents an obvious reference to the book of Ezekiel, in the Old Testament. Critics who intend to address the exegesis of a poet of such wide reading as Rimbaud ought to be conversant with the Scriptures. Mallarmé, Autre éventail								 Autre éventail {{is one of the best}} outcomes of Mallarmé’s poetics. The poem sets the elegant translation of a frivolous, typically Parnassian object, such as a fan, into a disincarnated image of the ultimate reality. As opposed to other poems by Mallarmé, this one closes with the return of the object to its basic function. Paul Verlaine. ΙΗΣΟΥΣ ΧΡΙΣΤΟΣ ΘΕΟΥ ΥΙΟΣ ΣΩΤΗΡ. Analysis and comment. The poem ΙΗΣΟΥΣ ΧΡΙΣΤΟΣ ΘΕΟΥ ΥΙΟΣ ΣΩΤΗΡ is based on a thematic association between Christ and a fish, an association which refers to a well-grounded tradition in the Scriptures and in patristic literature. Two poems by Verlaine The composition of Cortège was influenced by the first version of Flaubert’s Tentation de Saint Antoine. In Verlaine’s poem, though, the original images are weakened and in some way coarsened. While searching for the sources of the poem Marco, one is led to reconstruct a whole literary cycle : the « history of Marco the courtesan » in XIXth century French literature. Ces huit études de Sergio Cigada sur la littérature symboliste parurent en italien, dans des revues ou dans des ouvrages collectifs, entre 1960 et 2010. Elles sont ici pour la première fois rassemblées, par les soins de ses élèves, et traduites en français. À la lumière d’une conception « interprétative et non didactique » de la critique littéraire, Cigada décèle chez Baudelaire les racines anthropologiques, esthétiques et rhétoriques de tout le Symbolisme. Il en suit les ramifications diverses dans l’œuvre des ses « héritiers », Rimbaud, Mallarmé et Verlaine, dont la vaste culture, classique et chrétienne, interpelle l’acuité du philologue. Par l’Imagination, vertu spirituelle suprême « qui siège en l’homme mais qui puise à l’absolu », le poète accède à la Vision des correspondances absconses qui régissent objectivement l’univers. Mais pour les rendre intelligibles aux autres hommes, il devra « trouver une langue », une forme adéquate. D’où les figures typiques de la poésie symboliste – synesthésie, association thématique, paysage d’âme, allégorie, oxymore – figures « doubles », où la parole agrège les fragments désunis de l’expérience humaine et révèle l’harmonie cosmique recomposée...|$|R
60|$|It {{had once}} been a {{somewhat}} pretentious dwelling, but had evidently followed the fortunes of its late owner, Don Juan Briones, who had offered it as a last sop to the three-headed Cerberus that guarded the El Refugio Plutonean treasures, and who had swallowed it in a single gulp. It was in very bad case. The furrows of its red-tiled roof looked {{as if they were the}} results of age and decrepitude. Its best room had a musty smell; there was the dampness of <b>deliquescence</b> in its slow decay, but the Spanish Californians were sensible architects, and its massive walls and partitions defied the earthquake thrill, and all the year round kept an even temperature within.|$|E
6000|$|The final {{attainment}} {{of this great}} synthesis, like the social <b>deliquescence</b> and reconstruction {{dealt with in the}} earlier of these anticipations, has an air of being a process independent of any collective or conscious will in man, as being the expression of a greater Will; it is working now, and may work out to its end vastly, and yet at times almost imperceptibly, as some huge secular movement in Nature, the raising of a continent, the crumbling of a mountain-chain, goes on to its appointed culmination. Or one may compare the process to a net that has surrounded, and that is drawn continually closer and closer upon, a great and varied multitude of men. We may cherish animosities, we may declare imperishable distances, we may plot and counter-plot, make war and [...] "fight to a finish;" [...] the net tightens for all that.|$|E
60|$|The {{young girl}} {{remained}} {{standing by the}} window, motionless and apparently passive, as if receiving an accepted and usual punishment. But here the elder woman gave way to sobs and some incoherent snuffling, at which the younger went away. Whether she recognized in her mother's tears the ordinary <b>deliquescence</b> of emotion, or whether, as a woman herself, she knew that this mere feminine conventionality {{could not possibly be}} directed at her, and that the actual conflict between them had ceased, she passed slowly on to an inner hall, leaving the male victim, her unfortunate father, to succumb, as he always did sooner or later, to their influence. Crossing the hall, which was decorated with a few elk horns, Indian trophies, and mountain pelts, she entered another room, and {{closed the door behind her}} with a gesture of relief.|$|E
60|$|This is {{the limit}} {{of the power of}} the modern {{newspaper}} of large circulation, the newspaper that appeals to the grey element, to the average democratic man, the newspaper of the <b>deliquescence,</b> and if our previous conclusion that human society has ceased to be homogeneous and will presently display new masses segregating from a great confusion, holds good, that will be {{the limit of}} its power in the future. It may undergo many remarkable developments and modifications,[35] but none of these tend to give it any greater political importance than it has now. And so, after all, our considerations of the probable developments of the party machine give us only negative results, so long as the grey social confusion continues. Subject to that continuance the party machine will probably continue as it is at present, and Democratic States and governments follow the lines upon which they run at the present time.|$|E
60|$|Modern Democracy thus {{came into}} being, not, as eloquent persons have pretended, by the {{sovereign}} people consciously and definitely assuming power--I imagine the sovereign people in France {{during the first}} Revolution, for example, quite amazed and muddle-headed with it all--but by the decline of old ruling classes {{in the face of}} the quasi-natural growth of mechanism and industrialism, and by the unpreparedness and want of organization in the new intelligent elements in the State. I have compared the human beings in society to a great and increasing variety of colours tumultuously smashed up together, and giving at present a general and quite illusory effect of grey, and I have attempted to show that there is a process in progress that will amount at last to the segregation of these mingled tints into recognizable distinct masses again. It is not a monotony, but an utterly disorderly and confusing variety that makes this grey, but Democracy, for practical purposes, does really assume such a monotony. Like 'infinity', the Democratic formula is a concrete-looking and negotiable symbol for a negation. It is the aspect in political disputes and contrivances of that social and moral <b>deliquescence</b> the nature and possibilities of which have been discussed in the preceding chapters of this volume.|$|E
60|$|The {{appearance}} {{of these two}} strange functionless elements, although the most striking symptom of the new phase of progressive mechanical civilization now beginning, {{is by no means}} the most essential change in progress. These appearances involve also certain disappearances. I have already indicated pretty clearly that the vast irregular development of irresponsible wealthy people is swallowing up and assimilating more and more the old class of administrative land-owning gentlemen in all their grades and degrees. The old upper class, as a functional member of the State, is being effaced. And I have also suggested that the old lower class, the broad necessary base of the social pyramid, the uneducated inadaptable peasants and labourers, is, with the development of toil-saving machinery, dwindling and crumbling down bit by bit towards the abyss. But side by side with these two processes is a third process of still profounder significance, and that is the reconstruction and the vast proliferation of what constituted the middle class of the old order. It is now, indeed, no longer a middle class at all. Rather all the definite classes in the old scheme of functional precedence have melted and mingled,[25] and in the molten mass there has appeared a vast intricate confusion of different sorts of people, some sailing about upon floating masses of irresponsible property, some buoyed by smaller fragments, some clinging desperately enough to insignificant atoms, a great and varied multitude swimming successfully without aid, or with an amount of aid that is negligible in relation to their own efforts, and an equally varied multitude of less capable ones clinging to the swimmers, clinging to the floating rich, or clutching empty-handed and thrust and sinking down. This is the typical aspect of the modern community. It will serve as a general description of either the United States or any western European State, and the day is not far distant when the extension of means of communication, and of the shareholding method of conducting affairs, will make it applicable to the whole world. Save, possibly, in a few islands and inaccessible places and regardless of colour or creed, this process of <b>deliquescence</b> seems destined to spread. In a great diversity of tongues, in the phases of a number of conflicting moral and theological traditions, in the varying tones of contrasting racial temperaments, the grandchildren of black and white, and red and brown, will be seeking more or less consciously to express themselves in relation to these new and unusual social conditions. But the change itself is no longer amenable to their interpretations, the world-wide spreading of swift communication, the obliteration of town and country, the <b>deliquescence</b> of the local social order, have an air of being processes as uncontrollable by such collective intelligence as men can at present command, and as indifferent to his local peculiarities and prejudices as the movements of winds and tides....|$|E
60|$|A {{considerable}} {{proportion of}} the socialist movement remains, {{as it has been}} from the first, vaguely democratic. It points to collective ownership with no indication of the administrative scheme it contemplates to realise that intention. Necessarily it remains a formless claim without hands to take hold of the thing it desires. Indeed in a large number of cases it is scarcely more than a resentful consciousness in the expropriated masses of social disintegration. It spends its force very largely in mere revenges upon property as such, attacks simply destructive by reason of the absence of any definite ulterior scheme. It is an ill-equipped and planless belligerent who must destroy whatever he captures because he can neither use nor take away. A council of democratic socialists in possession of London would be as capable of an orderly and sustained administration as the Anabaptists in Munster. But the discomforts and disorders of our present planless system do tend steadily to the development of this crude socialistic spirit in the mass of the proletariat; merely vindictive attacks upon property, sabotage, and the general strike are the logical and inevitable consequences of an uncontrolled concentration of property in a few hands, and such things must and will go on, the deep undertow in the <b>deliquescence</b> of the Normal Social Life, until a new justice, a new scheme of compensations and satisfactions is attained, or the Normal Social Life re-emerges.|$|E
60|$|In the {{preceding}} four chapters {{there has been}} developed, in a clumsy laborious way, a smudgy, imperfect picture of the generalized civilized state of the coming century. In terms, vague enough at times, but never absolutely indefinite, the general distribution {{of the population in}} this state has been discussed, and its natural development into four great--but in practice intimately interfused--classes. It has been shown--I know not how convincingly--that as the result of forces that are practically irresistible, a world-wide process of social and moral <b>deliquescence</b> is in progress, and that a really functional social body of engineering, managing men, scientifically trained, and having common ideals and interests, is likely to segregate and disentangle itself from our present confusion of aimless and ill-directed lives. It has been pointed out that life is presenting an unprecedented and increasing variety of morals, ménages, occupations and types, at present so mingled as to give a general effect of greyness, but containing the promise of local concentration that may presently change that greyness into kaleidoscopic effects. That image of concentrating contrasted colours will be greatly repeated in this present chapter. In the course of these inquiries, we have permitted ourselves to take a few concrete glimpses of households, costumes, conveyances, and conveniences of the coming time, but only as incidental realizations of points in this general thesis. And now, assuming, as we must necessarily do, the soundness of these earlier speculations, we have arrived at a stage when we may consider how the existing arrangements for the ostensible government of the State are likely to develop through their own inherent forces, and how {{they are likely to be}} affected by the processes we have forecast.|$|E
60|$|We {{have seen}} that the {{essential}} process arising out {{of the growth of}} science and mechanism, and more particularly out of the still developing new facilities of locomotion and communication science has afforded, is the <b>deliquescence</b> of the social organizations of the past, and the synthesis of ampler and still ampler and more complicated and still more complicated social unities. The suggestion is powerful, the conclusion is hard to resist, that, through whatever disorders of danger and conflict, whatever centuries of misunderstanding and bloodshed, men may still have to pass, this process nevertheless aims finally, and will attain to the establishment of one world-state at peace within itself. In the economic sense, indeed, a world-state is already established. Even to-day we do all buy and sell in the same markets--albeit the owners of certain ancient rights levy their tolls here and there--and the Hindoo starves, the Italian feels the pinch, before the Germans or the English go short of bread. There is no real autonomy any more in the world, no simple right to an absolute independence such as formerly the Swiss could claim. The nations and boundaries of to-day do no more than mark claims to exemptions, privileges, and corners in the market--claims valid enough to those whose minds and souls are turned towards the past, but absurdities to those who look to the future as the end and justification of our present stresses. The claim to political liberty amounts, as a rule, to no more than the claim of a man to live in a parish without observing sanitary precautions or paying rates because he had an excellent great-grandfather. Against all these old isolations, these obsolescent particularisms, the forces of mechanical and scientific development fight, and fight irresistibly; and upon the general recognition of this conflict, upon the intelligence and courage with which its inflexible conditions are negotiated, depends very largely the amount of bloodshed and avoidable misery the coming years will hold.|$|E
6000|$|The reigning Prince, Otto Johann Friedrich, a {{young man}} of {{imperfect}} education, questionable valour, and no scintilla of capacity, has fallen into entire public contempt. It was with difficulty that I obtained an interview, for he is frequently absent from a court where his presence is unheeded, and where his only rôle {{is to be a}} cloak for the amours of his wife. At last, however, on the third occasion when I visited the palace, I found this sovereign in the exercise of his inglorious function, with the wife on one hand and the lover on the other. He is not ill-looking; he has hair of a ruddy gold, which naturally curls, and his eyes are dark, a combination which I always regard as the mark of some congenital deficiency, physical or moral; his features are irregular but pleasing; the nose perhaps a little short, and the mouth a little womanish; his address is excellent, and he can express himself with point. But to pierce below these externals is to come on a vacuity of any sterling quality, a <b>deliquescence</b> of the moral nature, a frivolity and inconsequence of purpose that mark the nearly perfect fruit of a decadent age. He has a worthless smattering of many subjects, but a grasp of none. [...] "I soon weary of a pursuit," [...] he said to me, laughing; it would almost appear as if he took a pride in his incapacity and lack of moral courage. The results of his dilettanteism are to be seen in every field; he is a bad fencer, a second-rate horseman, dancer, shot; he sings--I have heard him--and he sings like a child; he writes intolerable verses in more than doubtful French; he acts like the common amateur; and in short there is no end to the number of things that he does, and does badly. His one manly taste is for the chase. In sum, he is but a plexus of weaknesses; the singing chambermaid of the stage, tricked out in man's apparel, and mounted on a circus horse. I have seen this poor phantom of a prince riding out alone or with a few huntsmen, disregarded by all, and I have been even grieved for the bearer of so futile and melancholy an existence. The last Merovingians may have looked not otherwise.|$|E
6000|$|Democracy of {{the modern}} type, manhood {{suffrage}} and so forth, became a conspicuous phenomenon in the world only in the closing decades of the eighteenth century. Its genesis is so intimately connected with the first expansion of the productive element in the State, through mechanism and a co-operative organization, as to point at once to a causative connection. The more closely one looks into {{the social and political}} life of the eighteenth century the more plausible becomes this view. New and potentially influential social factors had begun to appear--the organizing manufacturer, the intelligent worker, the skilled tenant, and the urban abyss, and the traditions of the old land-owning non-progressive aristocratic monarchy that prevailed in Christendom, rendered it incapable--without some destructive shock or convulsion--of any re-organization to incorporate or control these new factors. In the case of the British Empire an additional stress was created by the incapacity of the formal government to assimilate the developing civilization of the American colonies. Everywhere there were new elements, not as yet clearly analyzed or defined, arising as mechanism arose; everywhere the old traditional government and social system, defined and analyzed all too well, appeared increasingly obstructive, irrational, and feeble in its attempts to include and direct these new powers. But now comes a point to which I am inclined to attach very great importance. The new powers were as yet shapeless. It was not the conflict of a new organization with the old. It was the preliminary dwarfing and <b>deliquescence</b> of the mature old beside the embryonic mass of the new. It was impossible then--it is, I believe, only beginning to be possible now--to estimate the proportions, possibilities, and inter-relations of the new social orders out of which a social organization has still to be built in the coming years. No formula of definite re-construction had been evolved, or has even been evolved yet, after a hundred years. And these swelling inchoate new powers, whose very birth condition was the crippling, modification, or destruction of the old order, were almost forced to formulate their proceedings for a time, therefore, in general affirmative propositions that were really in effect not affirmative propositions at all, but propositions of repudiation and denial. [...] "These kings and nobles and people privileged in relation to obsolescent functions cannot manage our affairs"--that was evident enough, that was the really essential question at that time, and since no other effectual substitute appeared ready made, the working doctrine of the infallible judgment of humanity in the gross, as distinguished from the quite indisputable incapacity of sample individuals, became, in spite of its inherent absurdity, a convenient and acceptable working hypothesis.|$|E
