5000|$|The {{heritage}} of mivacurium and indeed its very closely related cousin, doxacurium chloride, {{harks back to}} the synthesis of numerous compounds following structure-activity relationships that drove researchers to find the ideal replacement for succinylcholine (suxamethonium). Both mivacurium and doxacurium are descendants of early vigorous attempts to synthesize potent non-depolarizing agents with pharmacophores derived from cross-combinations of the non-depolarizing agent, laudexium, and the well-known <b>depolarizing</b> <b>agent,</b> succinylcholine (suxamethonium chloride). Ironically, laudexium itself was invented by a cross-combination between the prototypical non-depolarizing agent, d-tubocurarine and the <b>depolarizing</b> <b>agent,</b> decamethonium. From the 1950s through to the 1970s, the present-day concept of a neuromuscular blocking agent with a rapid onset and an ultra-short duration of action had not taken root: researchers and clinicians {{were still on the}} quest for potent but non-depolarizing replacements devoid of the histamine release and the dreaded [...] "recurarizing" [...] effects seen with tubocurarine and, more importantly, the absence of a depolarizing mechanism of action as seen with succinylcholine and decamethonium.|$|E
5000|$|Antinicotinic agents {{operate on}} the nicotinic {{acetylcholine}} receptors. The majority of these are non-depolarising skeletal muscle relaxants for surgical use that are structurally related to curare. Several are <b>depolarizing</b> <b>agents.</b>|$|R
50|$|<b>Depolarizing</b> agentsDepolarizing <b>agents</b> {{produce their}} block by binding to and {{activating}} the ACh receptor, at first causing muscle contraction, then paralysis. They bind to the receptor and cause depolarization by opening channels just like acetylcholine does. This causes repetitive excitation that lasts {{longer than a}} normal acetylcholine excitation and is most likely explained by the resistance of <b>depolarizing</b> <b>agents</b> to the enzyme acetylcholinesterase. The constant depolarization and triggering of the receptors keeps the endplate resistant to activation by acetylcholine. Therefore, a normal neuron transmission to muscle cannot cause contraction of the muscle because the endplate is depolarized and thereby the muscle paralysed.|$|R
40|$|The {{relationship}} between the free cytoplasmic Ca 2 + concentration, [Ca 2 +]i, and neurotransmitter release was investigated in guinea pig brain synaptosomes and the neurosecretory cell line PC 12. Release was induced by alpha-latrotoxin, which acts in both Ca 2 + -containing and Ca 2 + -free incubation media, or by the classical <b>depolarizing</b> <b>agents</b> high K+ and veratridine, which require extracellular Ca 2 +. Two complementary approaches were used to reveal changes of [Ca 2 +]i: (i) direct measurement by a fluorescent Ca 2 + indicator (quin 2) and (ii) study of the Ca 2 + -dependent phosphorylation of a protein, synapsin I, located at the cytoplasmic surface of synaptic vesicles. <b>Depolarizing</b> <b>agents,</b> when applied in Ca 2 + -containing medium, induced the [Ca 2 +]i to increase promptly 3 - to 6 -fold, drastically increased synapsin I phosphorylation, and caused stimulation of transmitter release. With alpha-latrotoxin, the [Ca 2 +]i increase was delayed and occurred at a slower rate, the increase of synapsin I phosphorylation was less drastic, and the release response was much more pronounced. In Ca 2 + -free medium, <b>depolarizing</b> <b>agents</b> released no transmitter and {{had no effect on}} [Ca 2 +]i or synapsin I phosphorylation, whereas with alpha-latrotoxin these processes were dissociated: considerable stimulation of the release without apparent change of [Ca 2 +]i and synapsin I phosphorylation. We conclude that the {{relationship between}} average [Ca 2 +]i and transmitter release is not straightforward and, in particular, that the release evoked by alpha-latrotoxin in Ca 2 + -free medium is mediated by a factor(s) other than bulk redistribution of Ca 2 + from intracellular stores...|$|R

50|$|The {{singular}} distinguishing clinical {{feature of}} gantacurium {{from any other}} non-depolarizing neuromuscular blocking drug clinically tested {{is that it has}} the desired duality of a rapid onset and an ultrashort duration of action even when administered at 3-4 times the ED95 doses. With the exception of one other clinically tested agent, BW785U77, no other clinically administered neuromuscular blocking drug has matched this feat to date: all other non-depolarizing neuromuscular blocking drugs clinically administered at equivalent doses most certainly would result in a medium or long duration of action albeit with a rapid onset of paralyzing effect. In this sense, gantacurium is a first in its class non-depolarizing neuromuscular blocking drug to arguably challenge the pharmacological profile of the gold-standard ultrashort acting <b>depolarizing</b> <b>agent</b> succinylcholine (suxamethonium). BW785U77 was not pursued for further clinical development owing to its propensity for eliciting histamine release in humans with more intensity than that observed during pre-clinical evaluation in animals. The holy grail of research in the neuromuscular blocking drugs arena {{for the better part of}} the 1980s and 1990s has been to find a non-depolarizing replacement for succinylcholine.|$|E

The latter was temporarily annulled by hexamethonium (which retained antagonist properties), but returned when hexamethonium was removed.

The combined treatment with protein kinase A and -C activators induced a 6 -fold increase of intracellular levels of CNP-(1 – 103). The biosynthesized CNP-(1 – 103) was co-released with its mature forms, typically CNP-(51 – 103), upon stimulation by nicotine or <b>depolarizing</b> <b>agents.</b> This confirms the neuropeptidic character of this third member of the natriuretic peptide family, which might act as a neuromodulator or neurotransmitter...|$|R
25|$|Normal {{end plate}} {{function}} can be blocked by two mechanisms. Nondepolarizing agents, such as tubocurarine, block the agonist, acetylcholine, from binding to nicotinic receptors and activating them, thereby preventing depolarization. Alternatively, <b>depolarizing</b> <b>agents,</b> such as succinylcholine, are nicotinic receptor agonists which mimic Ach, block muscle contraction by depolarizing {{to such an}} extent that it desensitizes the receptor and it can no longer initiate an action potential and cause muscle contraction. Both of these classes of neuromuscular blocking drugs are structurally similar to acetylcholine, the endogenous ligand, in many cases containing two acetylcholine molecules linked end-to-end by a rigid carbon ring system, as in pancuronium (a nondepolarizing agent).|$|R
40|$|International audienceThe {{characteristics}} of the transduction mechanism(s) activated by glutamate (Glu) via the quisqualate metabotropic receptor, {{as well as by}} <b>depolarizing</b> <b>agents,</b> to trigger formation of inositol phosphates (IPs) were investigated in 8 -day-old rat forebrain synaptoneurosomes. The replacement of external Na+ by various compounds (Li+, Tris+, N-methyl-D-glucamine+, and sucrose) induces an increase in basal accumulation of IPs and depolarizes synaptoneurosome membranes. Under these conditions, Glu- and K(+) -induced accumulations of IPs are inhibited, whereas the carbachol (Carb) -elicited response of IPs parallels the basal one. Agents increasing Na+ influx, such as veratridine and monensin, depolarize synaptoneurosomes and stimulate formation of IPs. These stimulations are not additive with responses of IPs elicited by Glu or K+. These data suggest that (a) Glu activates phosphoinositide metabolism via a specific mechanism (distinct from that of cholinergic agonists), (b) <b>depolarizing</b> <b>agents</b> and Glu share at least one common intermediate step in their mechanisms of activation of the metabolism of IPs, and (c) the depolarization may correspond to this common step. In addition, Na+ seems to be required for Glu stimulation of metabolism of IPs. The depolarization associated with the action of Glu on formation of IPs results neither from an influx via tetrodotoxin-sensitive voltage-dependent Na+ channels nor from an entry via the classically characterized Na+/Ca 2 + or Na+/H+ exchangers. In fact, tetrodotoxin (2 microM) has no effect on the Glu- or K(+) -elicited response of IPs. Amiloride (greater than 50 microM) and some of its derivatives similarly inhibit not only Glu- and K(+) - but also Carb-evoked formation of IPs...|$|R
40|$|AbstractA {{continuous}} fluorometric assay {{was adapted}} {{to measure the}} release of endogenous glutamate from cultured chick retinospheroids. The results obtained with this technique are compared {{with the release of}} [3 H]d-aspartate from monolayer cultures of chick retina cells. It is shown that although excitatory amino acids may be released in a Ca 2 +-dependent manner, most of the neurotransmitter release from cultured retina cells occurs by reversal of the glutamate transporter. The presence of extracellular Ca 2 + may actually inhibit glutamate release by the cells present in the retinospheroids, or the [3 H]d-aspartate release by cells in monolayers, when veratridine is the <b>depolarizing</b> <b>agent.</b> Copyright © 1996 Elsevier Science Ltd...|$|E
40|$|When {{cortical}} slices are incubated with adenine- 14 C, adenine nucleotides {{are labeled}} {{in a small}} and relatively stable pool. The ATP- 14 C of this pool is readily converted to cAMP- 14 C during incubations with depolarizing agents, such as K+, ouabain, veratridine, or batrachotoxin. During incubations with these agents, release of acetylcholine and of adenosine into the medium is enhanced. The increase in release of adenosine parallels the enhanced formation of cAMP- 14 C elicited by depolarizing agents, providing further evidence that adenosine may serve to couple electrical activity in {{the central nervous system}} with formation of cAMP. When adenosine or a <b>depolarizing</b> <b>agent</b> are incubated, together with a biogenic amine, such as histamine, serotonin, or norepinephrine, the combined effect on cAMP- 14 C formation in cortical slices is much more than additive. Extracellular levels of biogenic amines could in this manner modulate cAMP formation and biochemical responses in nervous tissue during electrical activity...|$|E
40|$|Neuronal {{cell death}} is an {{important}} phenomenon involving many biochemical pathways. This degenerative event has been studied {{to understand how the}} cells activate the mechanisms that lead to self-destruction. Target cells and afferent cells play a relevant role in the regulation of natural cell death. We studied the effect of veratridine (1. 5, 3. 0, 4. 5 and 6. 0 µM) on the survival of neonatal rat retinal ganglion cells in vitro. Veratridine (3. 0 µM), a well-known <b>depolarizing</b> <b>agent</b> that opens the Na+ channel, promoted a two-fold increase in the survival of retinal ganglion cells kept in culture for 48 h. This effect was dose-dependent and was blocked by 1. 0 µM tetrodotoxin (a classical voltage-dependent Na+ channel blocker) and 30. 0 µM flunarizine (a Na+ and Ca 2 + channel blocker). These results indicate that electrical activity is also important for the maintenance of retinal ganglion cell survival in vitr...|$|E
40|$|Batrachotoxin {{under certain}} {{conditions}} has a strong depolarizing effect on the innervated membrane of the monocellular electroplax preparation from the electric eel, El-ectrophorus electricus. No effect is observed when the toxin (50 - 200 nM) {{is applied to the}} resting membrane for periods up to 1 hr. However, if the membrane is exposed to batrachotoxin and the cell is subjected to stimulation at a stimulus voltage slightly above the threshold for action potential firing, a progressive prolongation of the action potential and concomitant progressive depolarization of the innervated membrane is observed. When the membrane is depolarized by 15 - 20 mV, a further abrupt all-or-none depolarization occurs, and the potential attains a steady-state value between 0 and - 10 mV. Brief stimulation of a cell in the presence of batrachotoxin is sufficient to define a batrachotoxin-treated cell, even though negligible depolarization occurs. If <b>depolarizing</b> <b>agents</b> such as carbamoylcholine or potassium chloride are introduced to such a cell in concentrations that normally produce a 20 - 30 mV depolarization, the abrupt all-or-none depolarization immediately occurs. All-or-none depolarizations arising from either electrical stimulation or <b>depolarizing</b> <b>agents</b> are unaffected by d-tubocurarine but are completely reversed by tetrodotoxin. Batrachotoxin thus appears to activate only the action potential sodium channels. In the batrachotoxin-treated membrane, these channels can attain stable steady states in either a closed configuration at the normal resting potential or in an open configuration after complete depolarization. A striking hysteresis cycle thus can be generated, which is strongly indicative of a voltage-dependent interaction of the toxin with the action potential sodium channels...|$|R

40|$|Intracellular calcium {{concentrations}} in individual rat motoneurones in enriched primary cultures were measured by Indo- 1 fluorimetry. Motoneurones in the cultures were characterized morphometrically and by cholineacetyltransferase immunocytochemistry. Depolarization {{of the cells}} with glutamic acid or veratridine increased intracellular calcium levels, which returned to baseline only slowly after removal of the <b>depolarizing</b> <b>agent.</b> The use of selective agonists (N-methyl-D-aspartic acid, AMPA, kainic acid, quisqualic acid and 1 R- 3 S-ACPD) and antagonists (MK 801 and CNQX) showed that the excitatory amino acid-evoked responses were mediated by AMPA/kainate receptors rather than by NMDA receptors. Depolarization-evoked calcium transients in motoneurones are blocked by the neuroprotective drug riluzoleCalcium transients reflected entry of calcium from without the cell, and their blockade by nitrendipine and lanthanum chloride suggested that this entry took place primarily through voltage-dependent calcium channels. These findings may be relevant for understanding the selective vulnerability of motoneurones to excitotoxicity in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, and the therapeutic activity of riluzole {{in the treatment of}} this disease...|$|E
40|$|The {{biological}} {{effects of}} electric and magnetic fields, which are ubiquitous in modern society, remain poorly understood. Here, we applied a single-cell approach {{to study the}} effects of short-term exposure to extremely low frequency electromagnetic fields (ELF-EMFs) on muscle cell differentiation and function using C 2 C 12 cells as an in vitro model of the skeletal muscle phenotype. Our focus was on markers of oxidative stress and calcium (Ca 2 +) handling, two interrelated cellular processes previously shown to be affected by such radiation in other cell models. Collectively, our data reveal that ELF-EMFs (1) induced reactive oxygen species production in myoblasts and myotubes with a concomitant decrease in mitochondrial membrane potential; (2) activated the cellular detoxification system, increasing catalase and glutathione peroxidase activities; and (3) altered intracellular Ca 2 +homeostasis, increasing the spontaneous activity of myotubes and enhancing cellular reactivity to a <b>depolarizing</b> <b>agent</b> (KCl) or an agonist (caffeine) of intracellular store Ca 2 +channels. In conclusion, our data support a possible link between exposure to ELF-EMFs and modification of the cellular redox state, which could, in turn, increase the level of intracellular Ca 2 +and thus modulate the metabolic activity of C 2 C 12 cells...|$|E
40|$|We {{tested the}} {{hypothesis}} that magnetic stimulation of muscle evokes cerebral potentials by causing a muscle contraction that then activates muscle receptors. We measured cerebral evoked potentials accompanying magnetic stimulation of muscle in 3 patients during surgery {{both before and after}} muscle paralysis with succinylcholine, a <b>depolarizing</b> <b>agent.</b> The magnetic stimulation was at low intensity (30 %) and at a 2 /s rate. The administration of succinylcholine sufficient to produce muscle paralysis did not alter cerebral potentials evoked by either low-intensity magnetic stimulation of muscle (gastrocnemius/soleus) or electrical stimulation of peripheral nerve (tibial nerve). In 1 normal subject, the S 1 nerve root action potentials conducting at rapid velocity (> 60 m/s) were detected at the S 1 foramen with a needle electrode using electrical stimulation of the tibial nerve. However, no S 1 nerve root potentials could be identified to magnetic stimulation of muscle that evoked a cerebral potential. We conclude that magnetic stimulation of muscle activates terminal afferents in the muscle to provide the afferent drive for the cerebral potentials independent of muscle contraction. The failure to detect the afferent volley in S 1 nerve root to magnetic stimulation suggests that only a few afferents are activated or that the activation of afferents is temporally dispersed...|$|E

Bovine retina also contains a protein kinase that is stimulated 20 -fold by cyclic AMP. It is proposed that dopamine is the major activator of a retinal adenylate cyclase, and that this activation is related to its role as a neurotransmitter...|$|R

Tertiary and quaternary analogs were equiactive. The relative ability of oxo, thio, and seleno analogs to displace nicotine was the same as their relative ability to block axonal conduction and synaptic transmission. Among cholinergic ligands, choline and aminocholine, previously shown to be inactive as <b>depolarizing</b> <b>agents,</b> were uniquely unable to displace nicotine. The findings are compatible with the presence of a biopolymer capable of binding cholinergic ligands in axonal membranes and support the postulate that the relative inactivity of quaternary compounds in intact axons is due to permeability barriers...|$|R
40|$|International audienceIn this article, we {{demonstrate}} that {{an increase in}} intracellular Ca 2 + concentration may represent a specific common step(s) in the mechanism(s) of action of glutamate (Glu) and <b>depolarizing</b> <b>agents</b> on formation of inositol phosphates (IPs) in 8 -day-old rat forebrain synaptoneurosomes. In fact, A 23187, a Ca 2 + ionophore, induces a dose-dependent accumulation of IPs, which is not additive with that evoked by Glu and K+ but is slightly synergistic with that induced by carbachol. In addition, Glu and K+ augment the intracellular Ca 2 + concentration in synaptoneurosome preparations {{as measured by the}} fura- 2 assay. The absence of external Ca 2 + decreases basal and Glu-, and K(+) -stimulated formation of IPs. Cd 2 + (100 microM) fully inhibits both Glu- and K(+) -evoked formation of IPs without affecting the carbachol-elicited response of IPs. Zn 2 + inhibits Glu- and K(+) -stimulated accumulation of IPs (IC 50 approximately 0. 4 mM) but with a lower affinity than Cd 2 + (IC 50 approximately 0. 035 mM). The organic Ca 2 + channel blockers verapamil (10 microM), nifedipine (10 microM), omega-conotoxin (2 microM), and amiloride (10 microM) as well as the inorganic blockers Co 2 + (100 microM) and La 3 + (100 microM) block neither Glu- nor K(+) -evoked formation of IPs, a result suggesting that the opening of the L-, T-, N-, or P-type Ca 2 + channels does not participate in these responses. All these data suggest that an increase in intracellular Ca 2 + concentration resulting from an influx of Ca 2 +, sensitive to Cd 2 + but not to other classical Ca 2 + antagonists, may {{play a key role in}} the transduction mechanism activated by Glu or <b>depolarizing</b> <b>agents...</b>|$|R
40|$|Primary {{cultures}} of cerebellar granule cells {{have been used}} in pharmacologically and functionally characterizing excitatory amino acid recognition sites coupled with guanylate cyclase. When granule cells were incubated in physiological culture conditions (Locke's solution, pH 7. 4), only kainate and, to a lesser extent, L-glutamate increased cyclic GMP (cGMP) levels. Under these conditions, L-aspartate, N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA), and quisqualate were inactive. When granule cells were incubated in the absence of extracellular Mg 2 + or {{in the presence of the}} <b>depolarizing</b> <b>agent</b> veratrine, L-glutamate, L-aspartate, and NMDA became as effective as kainate in enhancing cGMP formation. The action of kainate was preferentially antagonized by 2, 3 -cis-piperidindicarboxylate, whereas the action of L-glutamate was preferentially antagonized by (+/-) 2 -amino- 5 -phosphonovalerate. These data suggest that 2 different excitatory amino acid recognition sites (activated by kainate or by L-glutamate, L-aspartate, and NMDA, respectively) are coupled with guanylate cyclase in primary {{cultures of}} cerebellar granule cells: While the coupling of the recognition site for kainate with guanylate cyclase operates under resting conditions and in the presence of Mg 2 +, the coupling of the recognition site for L-glutamate, L-aspartate, and NMDA with guanylate cyclase requires depolarizing conditions or the absence of extracellular Mg 2 +...|$|E

This increase is reversed by low concentrations of 2 -amino- 5 -phosphono-valerate (APV), a result indicating {{that the absence of}} Mg 2 + facilitates the activation of a specific receptor by the endogenous excitatory amino acids (presumably L-glutamate and L-aspartate) released from the granule cells. The absence of Mg 2 + also potentiates the action of exogenously applied N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA), L-glutamate, L-aspartate, and kainate. In contrast, the action of quisqualate is virtually unaffected by Mg 2 + and is resistant to APV inhibition. Addition of the <b>depolarizing</b> <b>agent</b> veratridine enhances the accumulation of [3 H]Ins- 1 -P also in Mg 2 +-containing buffer. The action of veratridine is antagonized by APV, a result suggesting that, under depolarized conditions, the NMDA receptor can be activated by the endogenously released excitatory amino acids, despite the presence of Mg 2 +. Accordingly, in the presence of Mg 2 +, veratridine potentiates the action of exogenously applied NMDA but does not facilitate the action of quisqualate...|$|E

These flux measurements were related to light-induced changes in the plasma membrane potential. The influx of Ca 2 + was the main <b>depolarizing</b> <b>agent</b> in electrical responses to light in the mesophyll. Changes in the net fluxes of H+, K+, and Cl− occurred only after a significant delay of about 2 min, whereas light-stimulated influx of Ca 2 + began within the time resolution of our measurements (5 s). In the absence of H+ flux, light caused an initial quick rise of external pH near the mesophyll and epidermal tissues. In the mesophyll this fast alkalinization was followed by slower, oscillatory pH changes (5 – 15 min); in the epidermis the external pH increased steadily and reached a plateau 3 min later. We explain the initial alkalinization of the medium as a result of CO 2 uptake by photosynthesizing tissue, whereas activation of the plasma membrane H+ pump occurred 1. 5 to 2 min later.

Depolarization and internal calcium rise {{are known to}} stimulate IPs production. Moreover, DTT does not modify the depolarizing effect and the calcium rise elicited by glutamate and potassium. In addition, the antioxidant compounds 2 -aminoethylisothiouronium bromide (AET) and ascorbic acid {{have no effect on}} the basal and stimulated IPs accumulation. Thus, it is concluded that: (1) two distinct transduction pathways exist, one stimulated by glutamate and <b>depolarizing</b> <b>agents</b> and the other one by cholinergic agonists; (2) DTT produces its inhibition by reducing disulfide bridges likely at the level of proteins of the phosphoinositide transduction mechanism...|$|R

40|$|AbstractWe have {{previously}} shown that elevated K+-mediated neuronal survival correlates {{well with a}} sustained increase in cytoplasmic Ca 2 + ([Ca 2 +]i) through the opening of L-type Ca 2 + channels. Elevated K+ (40 mM), however, failed to support the survival of superior cervical ganglion (SCG) cells freshly isolated from newborn rats, while another <b>depolarizing</b> <b>agent,</b> veratridine, {{was able to do}} so, suggesting that elevated K+-mediated Ca 2 + influx occurs in a stage-dependent manner. Indeed, sustained levels of [Ca 2 +]i in response to high K+ remained low (91 nM) in these neurons, but became elevated (238 nM) in SCG neurons which had been exposed to nerve growth factor (NGF) for 5 - 7 days and were capable of responding to elevated K+ by survival. Semi-quantitative PCR measurements of L-type Ca 2 + channel mRNA revealed that this transcript increased dramatically during incubation with NGF for 3 days and reached a plateau level at Day 5 (seven-fold per surface area or nine-fold per total volume compared to that at Day 1). These findings show that NGF-mediated up-regulation of the expression of L-type Ca 2 + channel mRNA correlates with the development of elevated K+-mediated neuronal survival in vitro and suggest its involvement in coordinate strengthening of pre- and postganglionic synapses in rat SCG neurons...|$|E
40|$|The slow tonic {{responses}} of the anterior byssus retractor of Mytilus eduIis to rapid cooling were investigated by simultaneously recording tension and resting potential changes after soaking the muscle in banthine, a powerful neuromuscular blocking agent. The quantitative relations {{between the amount of}} cooling and the amount of associated depolarization necessary for contraction at various concentrations of potentiating potassium can be expressed in a family of curves. The plateaus of the curves for sea water and for potassium-free sea water were beneath the depolarization value necessary for contraction, so that it is clear that no amount of cooling with sea water alone or with potassium-free sea water would ever be effective. When the muscle is treated with subthreshold amounts of potassium arid rapidly cooled in various concentrations of sodium ion and calcium ion, respectively, the sodium and calcium do not affect the amount of depolarization. Acetylcholine, in subthreshold amounts, has a potentiating effect, but, unlike potassium and cooling, acts through the nervous apparatus. Mytilus muscle will respond to cooling with tonic contraction whenever a critical threshold amount of depolarization is achieved. Cooling alone cannot trigger the contraction since it cannot bring about sufficient depolarization. Cooling can result in contraction, however, if used in conjunction with some other subthreshold <b>depolarizing</b> <b>agent.</b> Cooling affects the contractile mechanism by first causing membrane breakdown and depolarization...|$|E

This study investigated the effect of tolcapone, a brain-penetrant COMT inhibitor, on a rat model of attentional set shifting, which is dependent on catecholamines and the medial PFC (mPFC). Additionally, we investigated the effect of tolcapone on extracellular catecholamines in the mPFC using microdialysis in awake rats. Tolcapone significantly and specifically improved extradimensional (ED) set shifting. Tolcapone did not affect basal extracellular catecholamines, but significantly potentiated the increase in extracellular dopamine (DA) elicited by either local administration of the <b>depolarizing</b> <b>agent</b> potassium chloride or systemic administration of the antipsychotic agent clozapine. Although extracellular norepinephrine (NE) was also elevated by local depolarization and clozapine, the increase was not enhanced by tolcapone. We conclude that COMT activity specifically affects ED set shifting and is a significant modulator of mPFC DA but not NE under conditions of increased catecholaminergic transmission. These data suggest that the links between COMT activity and PFC function can be modeled in rats and may be specifically mediated by DA. The interaction between clozapine and tolcapone may have implications for the treatment of schizophrenia...|$|E
40|$|The {{diagnosis}} of myasthenia gravis {{is often difficult}} and calls for a broader use of pharmacological and electrodiagnostic tests. The decamethonium-edrophonium test, which has proved superior to other procedures for this purpose, is based on neurophysiological principles and depicts the behaviour of the neuromuscular junction. A state of resistance to <b>depolarizing</b> <b>agents</b> in the limited form of myasthenia and a state of a non-depolarizing (competitive) block in advanced cases has been shown. This test has demonstrated that the neuromuscular defect exists throughout the skeletal musculature, including muscles clinically unaffected. It produced no false-positive results either in normal or neurasthenic persons or in patients with neurological diseases with myasthenic symptoms. In a patient with botulism and in a patient with ocular palsies from brain-stem encephalitis the edrophonium test gave a false-positive result, while the decamethonium-edrophonium test was negative...|$|R
50|$|Drugs that {{influence}} nAChRs can be agonists, partial agonists or antagonists. Agonists, e.g. nicotine, can however act as <b>depolarizing</b> <b>agents</b> when encountered to nAChRs {{for some time}} (seconds or minutes, depending on concentration and nAChR subtype), chronic exposure to agonist {{can also lead to}} long lasting functional deactivation because of rapid and persistent desensitization. Partial nAChR agonists have been studied since they seem to be helpful in smoking cessation. The partial agonists are believed to bind to the nAChRs and stimulate the release of dopamine in smaller portions than the agonists and therefore compensate for the absence of nicotine.The lack of specificity among some of the nicotinic agonists is well known and is a potential problem when using them to treat illnesses that require targeting a specific subtype of nAChRs. Among these nonspecific agonists are for example ACh, nicotine and epibatidine that all target more than one subtype of nAChRs.|$|R
40|$|The relaxant {{effects of}} five organic calcium antagonists (nicardipine, diltiazem, PY 108068, {{verapamil}} and bepridil) on guinea-pig isolated trachea were tested against contractions induced by acetylcholine, histamine, 5 -hydroxytryptamine, potassium chloride (KCl) and tetraethylammonium (TEA) {{in a medium}} containing the normal amount of calcium and against calcium dose-response curves in a calcium-free, potassium-enriched medium. These effects were {{compared with those of}} spasmolytic or specific acetylcholine or histamine antagonists. In contrast to the other drugs tested, organic calcium antagonists exerted a specific inhibitory effect on KCl- and TEA-induced contractions. Their degree of activity was in the order: nicardipine greater than diltiazem greater than PY 108068 greater than verapamil greater than bepridil. All calcium antagonists inhibited calcium dose-response curves at similar concentrations. Organic calcium antagonists therefore seem to exert a specific inhibitory effect on <b>depolarizing</b> <b>agents</b> in the guinea-pig isolated trachea, unlike other tissues, notably some vascular smooth muscles...|$|R
