40|$|Effects of {{magnetic}} <b>field</b> <b>heat</b> treatment {{on the structure}} and magnetic properties of Sm-Co/alpha-Fe nanocomposite permanent magnetic materials fabricated by {{high energy ball milling}} are investigated in the present work. After a magnetic <b>field</b> <b>heat</b> treatment below 700 degrees C on as-milled amorphous Sm-Co/alpha-Fe samples, the nanocomposite magnets with strong hard and soft magnetic interaction, showing a hysteresis loop of single phase characteristic, are obtained. The coercivity increases with the increase of annealing temperature. The coercivity, remanence and remanence ratio of the Sm-Co/Fe nanocomposite magnets are all enhanced after a heat treatment at a magnetic field as compared with those of nanocomposite magnets heat treated without a magnetic field. X ray diffraction analysis shows that the diffusion between the Sm-Co hard and alpha-Fe soft phases is suppressed by the magnetic field applied during the heat treatment process, leading to the inhibition of the grain growth of nanocrystal Sm-Co and alpha-Fe phases, and a finer nanostructure is obtained. Thus, a higher coercivity, remanence and remanence ratio are realized in Sm-Co/alpha-Fe nanocomposite magnets after the magnetic <b>field</b> <b>heat</b> treatment. Magnetic <b>field</b> <b>heat</b> treatment also makes the direction of c axis of Sm-Co hard grains along the heat treatment magnetic field direction, leading to an enhancement {{of magnetic}} anisotropy of the Sm -Co/Fe nanocomposite magnets.

40|$|In recent years, the {{application}} of nanomaterials to biological and biomedicine areas has attracted intensive interest. One of the hot topics is the nanomaterial mediated radiofrequency (RF) hyperthermia or ablation, i. e., using RF fields/waves to heat tumor tissues treated with nanomaterials to destroy cancerous cells while minimizing the side-heating effect. However, there are currently many contradictive results reported concerning the heating effect of nanomaterials under a RF field.

40|$|The title radical (F 4 BlmNN) is {{a stable}} nitronylnitroxide that forms hydrogen-bonded NH center dot center dot center dot ON chains in the solid state. The chains {{assemble}} the F 4 BlmNN molecules to form stacked contacts between the radical groups, in a geometry {{that is expected}} to exhibit ferromagnetic (FM) exchange based on spin polarization (SP) models. The experimental magnetic susceptibility of F 4 BlmNN confirms the expectation, showing 1 -D Heisenberg chain FM exchange behavior over 1. 8 - 300 K with an intrachain exchange constant Of J(chain) /k = + 22 K. At lower temperatures, ac magnetic susceptibility and variable <b>field</b> <b>heat</b> capacity measurements show that F 4 BlmNN acts as a quasi- 1 -D ferromagnet. The dominant ferromagnetic exchange interaction is attributable to overlap between spin orbitals of molecules within the hydrogen-bonded chains, consistent with the SP model expectations. The chains appear to be antiferromagnetically exchange coupled, giving cusps in the ac susceptibility and zero <b>field</b> <b>heat</b> capacity at lower temperatures. The results indicate that the sample orders magnetically at about 0. 7 K. The magnetic heat capacity ordering cusp shifts to lower temperatures as external magnetic field increases, consistent with forming a bulk antiferromagnetic phase below a Neel temperature of T-N(0) = 0. 72 K, with a critical field of H-c approximate to 1800 Oe.
