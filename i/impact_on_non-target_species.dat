40|$|A {{major concern}} during {{pesticide}} {{development and use}} is the <b>impact</b> <b>on</b> <b>non-target</b> <b>species,</b> such as raptors or domestic cats and dogs. Sodium nitrite and para-aminopropiophenone (PAPP) are two toxicants currently being studied for the control of invasive species, such as starlings and feral swine. When given to an animal these compounds oxidize hemoglobin, which renders it unable to carry oxygen resulting in methemoglobinemia. This study developed a method to estimate methemoglobin levels in mammals and birds by examining the efficacy of sodium nitrite to induce the conversion of hemoglobin to methemoglobin. Varying concentrations of sodium nitrite were added to aliquots of coyote, vole, feral swine, starling, and duck blood, collected from captive animals. The blood samples were analyzed spectrophotometrically to determine percent methemoglobin and digitally to determine red color values (RCV) associated with different methemoglobin levels. The avian and mammalian blood reached 100 % methemoglobin levels at 200 mM and 15 mM sodium nitrite, respectively. All animals had similar RCV for a given percent methemoglobin. In conclusion, this study developed a procedure to quickly determine methemoglobin levels in mammals and birds. Furthermore, percent methemoglobin can be estimated with one standard curve from any animal species and {{an image of a}} blood spot. The technique will be useful during field studies, in agricultural areas, or in a veterinarian's office for the rapid diagnosis of methemoglobinemia in non-target animals that have eaten toxicants/baits or baited animals...|$|E
40|$|Anticoagulant {{rodenticide}} (AR) {{resistance in}} Norway rat populations {{has been a}} problem for fifty years, however its <b>impact</b> <b>on</b> <b>non-target</b> <b>species,</b> particularly predatory and scavenging animals has received little attention. Field trials were conducted on farms in Germany and England where resistance to anticoagulant rodenticides had been confirmed. Resistance is conferred by different mutations of the VKORC 1 gene in each of these regions: tyrosine 139 cysteine in Germany and leucine 120 glutamine in England. A modelling approach was used to study the transference of the anticoagulants into the environment during treatments for Norway rat control. Baiting with brodifacoum resulted in lower levels of AR entering the food chain via the rats and lower numbers of live rats carrying residues during and after the trials due to its lower application rate and efficacy against resistant rats. Bromadiolone and difenacoum resulted in markedly higher levels of AR uptake into the rat population and larger numbers of live rats carrying residues during the trials and for long periods after the baiting period. Neither bromadiolone nor difenacoum provided full control on any of the treated farms. In resistant areas where ineffective compounds are used there is the potential for higher levels of AR exposure to non-target animals, particularly predators of rats and scavengers of rat carcasses. Thus, resistance influences the total amount of AR available to non-targets and should be considered when dealing with rat infestations, as resistance-breakers may present a lower risk to wildlife...|$|E
40|$|International audienceSmall mammals {{such as the}} European rabbits, {{the plateau}} pikas, the prairie dogs have been {{traditionally}} perceived as pests and targeted for control {{on a large scale}} despite their importance as key-stone species in their native ecosystem. This is also the case for the fossorial form of the water vole (Arvicola terrestris). This species can reach large population densities and causes heavy damage to grassland with subsequent economic losses for farmers (9, 000 to 25, 000 € for a 70 ha farm during an outbreak year in Franche-Comté, France). However, higher population densities of A. terrestris and also of Microtus arvalis, help maintaining a large and rich community of vole predators. Such non-target species (red kite, common buzzard, wild boar, red fox, etc.) are impacted, some of them heavily, by the unconditional use of rodenticides (e. g. bromadiolone). In order to minimize the use of rodenticides in controlling A. terrestris populations, a long term research program has been undertaken since the late 80 s, aiming at identifying the key-parameters of such regional systems. Based on a systems approach, this collaborative research network involves academic researchers, farmer, game, conservationist organizations and governmental and local administrations together. On a regional scale (area of about 2500 km 2), Delattre et al. (1992), Giraudoux et al. (1997), Fichet et al. (2000) provided evidence that M. arvalis and A. terrestris population dynamic patterns correlate with land composition. On a sectorial scale (area of about 25 km 2), Delattre et al. (1996), Delattre et al. (1999) showed for M. arvalis that landscape heterogeneity dampen population fluctuations and may modulate prey/predator relationships; Duhamel et al. (2000) that A. terrestris outbreak epicentres occur in homogeneous grassland and Foltete et al. (2008) that hedgerow networks slow down the propagation of travelling waves. On a local scale (area of about 0. 01 km 2), Delattre et al. (2006), Morilhat et al. (2007, 2008) showed that A. terrestris population growth was enhanced by larger gallery networks of Talpa europea, was slowed down by ploughing and cattle tramping and was modified by neighbouring landscape (10 - 100 ha). This led to a number of recommendations, now implemented for a more sustainable control of A. terrestris (Delattre and Giraudoux 2009) with substantial decrease in rodenticide utilization and lesser <b>impact</b> <b>on</b> <b>non-target</b> <b>species.</b> Poster downloadable at: [URL]...|$|E

This paper reviews the history of how increased numbers of observed stranded sea turtles in 1999 led to the discovery that turtles were becoming entangled in the large-mesh gillnet fishery in Pamlico Sound, North Carolina. It also demonstrates how a variety of data sets from fisheries observers, aerial surveys, and fisheries statistics programs contributed to shaping management of the large-mesh gillnet fishery in Pamlico Sound to decrease turtle bycatch and now point towards the need of additional assessment of gillnet bycatch {{in other parts of}} North Carolina.

40|$|This {{research}} {{describes the}} commercial trap fishery and biology {{of the blue}} swimmer crab, Portunus pelagicus, in Wallis Lake (NSW). It also reports on preliminary trials for appropriate sampling of P. pelagicus populations for fisheries and biological studies. It reports {{on the status of}} the NSW commercial fisheries. Overall 81 % of male and 79 % of female P. pelagicus captured in the Wallis lake crab trap fishery were larger than the current minimum legal carapace length (CL) (i. e. 60 mm) and therefore retained. It was estimated that approximately 385, 988 (± 37, 551) P. pelagicus were retained and 183, 653 (± 29, 716) discarded from the trap fishery during the 2002 / 03 season. The quantities of non-target species captured were generally very low, and significantly less than that generally reported for other crab-trap fisheries. Acanthopagrus australis was the most abundant bycatch species, with an estimated total of 2, 445 (± 1, 564) caught, representing 43 % of the total bycatch, during the 2002 / 03 season. Discarded organisms were in good condition when returned to the wild. This study demonstrates that the Wallis Lake trap fishery for P. pelagicus is relatively selective and has minimal direct <b>impact</b> <b>on</b> <b>non-target</b> <b>species.</b> The fecundity of Portunus. pelagicus in Wallis Lake increased in a positive linear relationship with CL. The mean number of eggs carried per brood in this study was greater than that reported throughout P. pelagicus distribution. Examination of gonads in overvigorous females showed that female P. pelagicus from Wallis Lake can produce several batches of eggs from a single mating. The estimated number of egg broods produced by female crabs in the different size classes ranged from one in crabs (50 - 55 mm CL) to three in crabs (75 - 80 mm CL). The size at which females reach maturity (CL 50) is below the current minimum legal size limit of 60 mm carapace length applied in NSW waters. Yield per recruit analysis indicated that lowering the minimum legal size to 52 mm would increase yield provided there was no change in exploitation rates. However, by exposing female crabs in the 55 - 60 mm size class to fishing pressure, egg production in Wallis Lake could potentially decline. Tag-based studies have been of limited success in estimating growth and describing the movement patterns of the blue swimmer crabs in Australia. In an attempt to improve survival rates of tagged individuals, this study investigated alternative tag designs. However, results indicate that tagging P. pelagicus using polyethylene streamer tags may not be viable due to the high levels of initial mortality observed after tagging (Male 62. 5 %, female 25 %) ...|$|E
40|$|The use of {{livestock}} guarding dogs (LGDs) to mitigate farmer-predator conflict in Namibia was evaluated. As farmer-predator conflict has two sides, LGDs were evaluated in terms {{of livestock}} production and conservation. The main objectives {{in terms of}} livestock production were to document: 1) the perceived ability of LGDs to reduce livestock losses in a cost-effective manner; 2) the farmers’ satisfaction with LGD performance; and 3) factors influencing LGD behaviour. The main objectives in terms of conservation were to record: 1) predator killing by farmers relative to LGD introduction; 2) direct impacts of LGDs on target (damage-causing) species; and 3) the impact of LGDs on non-target species. This evaluation was conducted on LGDs bred by the Cheetah Conservation Fund (CCF) and placed on farms in Namibia. The data were collected during face-to-face interviews with farmers using LGDs. Historical data from the CCF programme were {{used in conjunction with}} a complete survey of the farmers in the CCF LGD programme during 2009 - 2010. In terms of livestock production, 91 % of the LGDs (n = 65) eliminated or reduced livestock losses. Subsequently, 73 % of the farmers perceived their LGDs as economically beneficial, although a cost-benefit analysis showed that only 59 % of the LGDs were cost-effective. Farmers were generally satisfied with the performance of their LGDs. However, farmer satisfaction was more closely linked to good LGD behaviour than the perceived reduction in livestock losses. The most commonly-reported LGD behavioural problems (n = 195) were staying at home rather than accompanying the livestock (21 %) and chasing wildlife (19 %). LGD staying home behaviour was linked to a lack of care on subsistence farms, as high quality dog food was not consistently provided. Care for LGDs declined with LGD age on subsistence, but not commercial, farms. In terms of conservation, predator-killing farmers killed fewer individuals in the year since LGD introduction than previously; this result was only significant for black-backed jackal Canis mesomelas. However, 37 LGDs killed jackals, nine killed baboons Papio ursinus, three killed caracals Caracal caracal and one killed a cheetah Acinonyx jubatus (n = 83). Farmers and LGDs combined killed significantly more jackals in the survey year than the same farmers (n = 36) killed before LGD introduction. Conversely, five farmers killed 3. 2 ± 2. 01 cheetahs each in the year before LGD introduction, whereas LGDs and these farmers combined killed only 0. 2 ± 0. 2 cheetahs per farm in the survey year. Only 16 LGDs (n = 83) killed non-target species. The high LGD success rate in terms of livestock production was facilitated by livestock husbandry practices in the study area. In terms of conservation, LGDs were more beneficial for apex predators than for mesopredators and had a minor <b>impact</b> <b>on</b> <b>non-target</b> <b>species...</b>|$|E
40|$|This work {{focuses on}} the {{by-catch}} composition of Plesionika edwardsii experimental fishery in the Cape Verde Islands. Obtaining information on abundance, composition and lifecycle of species involved in this potential fishery is useful, {{in order to ensure}} its sustainable development under an ecosystem approach. The first step towards this goal is the description of catches. Four 15 -day research surveys were conducted on board the R/V Prof. Ignacio Lozano: April 2010 (S˜ao Vicente and Santa Luzia islands), November 2011 (Santiago island), March 2012 (Boa Vista island,) and July 2012 (Sal and S˜ao Nicolau islands). The working depths were between 66 and 458 m depth. A standardized innovative fishing gear was used, so-called multiple semi-floating shrimp traps. Each fishing line was composed by 40 - 65 traps operating around 2. 4 m above the seafloor, using Decapterus macarellus (Carangidae) as unique bait of the traps.

Plesionika edwardsii, the target species of this fishery, represented 97. 8 % of the catch in terms of abundance and 40. 1 % in biomass. By-catch represented 59. 9 % of total catch in terms of biomass. Osteichthyes (87. 5 %) were the dominant group and was represented by the following main families; Sparidae (33. 9 %), Moridae (32. 5 %), Muraenidae (32. 5 %), Scorpaenidae (9. 9 %) and Tetraodontidae (9. 8 %). Chondrichthyes (11. 6 %) were composed by Centrophoridae (65. 3 %) and Triakidae (34. 1 %). Finally, Crustacea (1. 9 %) were chiefly composed by Pandalidae (79. 1 %). However, different families represented by specific species were found to be dominant around each island. Sparidae were the dominant family represented by Pagellus acarne (46. 2 % of total by-catch) at S˜ao Vicente, and by Dentex macrophthalmus (42. 6 %) at Boa Vista. Tetraodontidae with Sphoeroides pachygaster (25. 9 %) and Sparidae with P. acarne (25. 1 %) were the co-dominant families in the by-catch around Santa Luzia.

Analysis of a 16 year dataset collected at South Georgia {{indicated that the}} amount of gear found in association with wandering albatrosses was an order of magnitude greater than in any other species, reflecting their wider foraging range and larger gape. Unlike other taxa, most gear associated with grey-headed albatrosses was from squid and not longline fisheries, and mistaken for natural prey rather than the result of direct interaction. Observed rates of foul-hooking (entanglement during line-hauling) were much higher in giant petrels and wandering albatrosses than black-browed albatrosses, and no grey-headed albatross was affected. The index of wandering albatross gear abundance showed two peaks, the most recent corresponding with a substantial {{increase in the number of}} multifilament snoods (gangions), Suggesting that the widespread adoption of a new longline system (Chilean mixed) may have been responsible. Although all identified gear was demersal, given the widespread use of similar hooks, little could be assigned to a specific fishery. Stomach content analysis suggested that 1300 - 2048 items of gear are currently consumed per annum by the wandering albatross population. Many hooks are completely digested by chicks, long-term effects of which are entirely unknown. We suggest a number of management approaches for addressing the problem of gear discarding, and guidelines for monitoring schemes elsewhere. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved...|$|R

The bitou-free web contained 36 species, the bitou-threatened plot 9 species and the bitou-infested web contained 6 species. One native Australian herbivore attacked the seeds of bitou bush. M. polana, a seed-feeding Xy, was heavily attacked by native parasitoids, these being more abundant than the parasitoids feeding on the native seed feeders.

40|$|Thesis (Ph. D. (Environmental Science) [...] North-West University, Potchefstroom Campus, 2010. The {{environmental}} impacts of genetically modified (GM) crop plants such as Bt (Bacillus thuringiensis) maize {{have not yet been}} fully assessed in South Africa. Bt maize designed to express Bt endotoxin for control of Busseola fusca (Fuller) (Lepidoptera: Noctuidae) and Chilo partellus (Swinhoe) (Lepidoptera: Crambidae) is planted on approximately 1. 103 million hectares in South Africa. The monitoring of GM crops after release is important in order to assess and evaluate possible environmental effects. No risk assessment for Bt maize was done in South Africa before its release in 1998 and no targeted post-release monitoring of possible resistance development or <b>impact</b> <b>on</b> <b>non-target</b> <b>species</b> have been done. Awareness has risen in South Africa through research highlighting the possible effects GM crops may have. The aim {{of this study was to}} determine, through feeding experiments, the effects of Bt maize on selected non-target Lepidoptera, Coleoptera and Diptera species that occur in maize agro-ecosystems in South Africa. Results provide information for use in future risk assessment studies on Bt maize and indicate which species could possibly be of importance in post-release monitoring of Bt maize. Priority insect species were identified and laboratory- and semifield experiments were conducted to evaluate the effect of Bt maize on these species. In the light of the reportedly lower toxicity of Bt maize to certain noctuid borers, the effect of Bt maize was evaluated on Sesamia calamistis (Hampson), Agrotis segetum (Denis & Schiffermüller), and Helicoverpa armigera (Hubner). Feeding studies were also conducted to determine the effect of Bt maize on non-target Coleoptera, i. e. Heteronychus arator Fabricius (Coleoptera: Scarabaeidae) and Somaticus angulatus (Fahraeus) (Coleoptera: Tenebrionidae). The effect of indirect exposure of the stem borer parasitoid Sturmiopsis parasitica (Curran) (Diptera: Tachinidae) to Bt toxin was evaluated to determine if there is any effect when it parasitizes Bt-resistant B. fusca larvae that have fed on Bt maize. Results from the study conducted with S. calamistis indicated that Bt maize of both events (Bt 11 and MON 810) were highly toxic to S. calamistis. The behavioural characteristic of S. calamistis to feed behind leaf sheaths and to enter stems directly did not result in escape of exposure to the toxin. Larval feeding on leaf sheaths therefore resulted in the ingestion of sufficient toxin to kill larvae before they entered maize stems. Results showed that the effect of Cry 1 Ab toxin on the biology of A. segetum larvae and moths were largely insignificant. Whorl leaves were observed to be an unsuitable food source for H. armigera larvae and larval growth was poor. No larvae survived to the pupal stage on any of the Bt maize treatments. When feeding on maize ears H. armigera larval mass increased on non-Bt maize whereas no increase occurred on Bt maize. The feeding study conducted with Coleoptera showed that the effect of Bt maize on H. arator and S. angulatus was insignificant and no differences were observed in any of the parameters measured for the two species. Although not always significant, the percentage parasitism of Bt-consuming host larvae by S. parasitica was always higher compared to host larvae that fed on non-Bt maize. It could be that Bt toxin affects B. fusca fitness to such an extent that the immune systems of host larvae were less effective. The different parameters tested for S. parasitica indicated only one case where fly maggots originating from diapause host larvae feeding on non-Bt maize had a greater mass compared to host larvae that fed on Bt maize. The same applied to S. parasitica pupal length. For other parameters tested there were no significant differences. Sesamia calamistis is stenophagous and occurs in mixed populations with other borer species. It was therefore concluded that the ecological impact of local extinctions of S. calamistis caused by Bt maize is not expected to be great. Bt maize will most likely not have any significant effect on the control of A. segetum under field conditions. The feeding study conducted with H. armigera quantified the effects of Bt maize on this species and provided important information on the potential of Bt maize as protection against this polyphagous pest. However, the likelihood of H. armigera becoming an important secondary pest is high. It can be concluded that the Cry 1 Ab toxin targeting lepidopteran pests will not have adverse effects on H. arator or S. angulatus. Although some adverse effects were observed on S. parasitica mass and pupal length it is most likely that this will not contribute to adverse effects in the field, but that there rather be synergism between Bt maize and S. parasitica. An ecological approach was followed in which the potential effects of exposure of priority species to Bt toxin in maize was investigated. A series of selection matrixes were developed in which each of the above mentioned species was ranked for its maximum potential exposure to Bt toxin by assessing it occurrence, abundance, presence and linkage in the maize ecosystem. Through the use of these selection matrixes, knowledge gaps were identified for future research and to guide the design of ecologically realistic experiments. This study contributes to knowledge regarding the possible effects of Bt maize on the most economically important non-target pests in South Africa. There is, however, a need to evaluate other non-target species in feeding studies, as well as in field studies. From this study it can be concluded that some species can be eliminated from further testing since Bt maize had no adverse effect while more research have to be conducted on other species.

40|$|Oilseed rape (Brassica napus) is an {{important}} combinable break crop in the UK, which is largely protected from arthropod pests by insecticidal chemicals. Despite ongoing debate {{regarding the use of}} neonicotinoids, the dominant seed treatment ingredients used for this crop, there is little publicly available data comparing the efficacy of insecticides in controlling key arthropod pests or comparing the <b>impacts</b> <b>on</b> <b>non-target</b> <b>species</b> and the wider environment. To provide an insight into these matters, a UK-wide expert survey targeting agronomists and entomologists was conducted from March to June 2015. Based on the opinions of 90 respondents, an average of 20 % yield loss caused by the key arthropod pests was expected to have occurred in the absence of insecticide treatments. Relatively older chemical groups were perceived to have lower efficacy for target pests than newer ones, partly due to the development of insecticide resistance. Without neonicotinoid seed treatments, a lack of good control for cabbage stem flea beetle was perceived. Wide spectrum foliar insecticide sprays were perceived to have significantly greater negative impacts than seed treatments on users' health, natural enemies, pollinators, soil and water, and many foliar active ingredients have had potential risks for <b>non-target</b> arthropod <b>species</b> in UK oilseed rape fields for the past 25 years. Overall, 72 % of respondents opposed the neonicotinoid restriction, while 10 % supported it. Opposition and support of the restriction were largely based on concerns for pollinators and the wider environment, highlighting the uncertainty over the side effects of neonicotinoid use. More people from the government and research institutes leaned towards neutrality over the issue, compared to those directly involved in growing the crop. Neonicotinoid restriction was expected to result in greater effort and expenditure on pest control and lower production (0 - 1 t/ha less). Alternatives for future oilseed rape protection were then discussed...|$|R

40|$|Minimising {{catches of}} non-target animals in a trawl fishery reduces the <b>impact</b> <b>on</b> a marine {{community}} and {{may help to}} sustain the fishery resource in the long term. Hence the desirability for trawls that minimise <b>impacts</b> <b>on</b> <b>non-target</b> <b>species</b> while maintaining catches of target species. This study resulted from a need to further develop easily handled, semi-pelagic style trawls for Australia's Northern Fish Trawl Fishery. In November 1993 we compared catches from three differently rigged versions of a demersal wing trawl: one fished in a standard demersal configuration with its footrope on the sea bed, and two fished semi-pelagically, with their footropes raised to either 0. 4 - 0. 5 or 0. 8 - 0. 9 m above the sea bed. At two sites in the northeast Gulf of Carpentaria, each trawl type was used on the same combination of sites, grids within sites and times of day. Catches of the main target species (Lutjanus malabaricus and Lutjanus erythropterus) by the three trawl types were not significantly different. However, the mean catches of both these species and of other commercially important snappers, were highest in the semi-pelagic trawl raised 0. 4 - 0. 5 m above the sea bed. This increase {{could be due to}} a larger trawl spread or to the whole rig fishing higher in the water column. Of the 107 species of fishes analysed, 61 were caught in greater abundance in the demersal trawl. Seven species were caught more effectively in the semi-pelagic trawl with the footrope 0. 4 - 0. 5 m above the substrate; none was caught most effectively with the footrope set at 0. 8 - 0. 9 m. Epibenthic byproduct species (squid and Thenus orientalis), fish bycatch, sponges and other epibenthic invertebrates were also caught in lower numbers in the semi-pelagic trawls. The semi-pelagic trawls convincingly caught less (in both numbers and biomass) of the unwanted species which are normally discarded. Semi-pelagic fish trawls of the types tested would be suitable for Australia's Northern Fish Trawl Fishery and probably other demersal trawl fisheries that would benefit from the conservation of non-target epibenthic communities...|$|R
40|$|Thesis (M. S.) University of Alaska Fairbanks, 2015 This study {{contributes}} {{to the understanding of}} the persistence of silvicultural treatments into the stem exclusion stage of forest development in an experiment originally designed to test the effectiveness of various white spruce (Picea glauca Moench [Voss]) regeneration practices. Many studies in the North American boreal forest address the effect of silvicultural treatments on a single tree species, specifically white spruce in the great majority of cases. The experiment measured in this study provided an excellent opportunity to compare treatment effects on white spruce density and growth. The Rosie Creek Fire Tree Regeneration Installation experiment represents an operational-scale, spatially-explicit, replicated design on a single site disturbed consecutively by high-severity wildfire and clearcut salvage harvest. Three hierarchical factors, each with multiple levels, were examined: landform type, ground scarification methods, and white spruce regeneration methods. All three of the experimental factors exercised continuing influence on the patterns of white spruce regeneration and growth. The treatment effects did not attenuate over time for white spruce, and we found statistically significant effects that the original researchers could only describe as tendencies. However, relatively few studies address treatment <b>impacts</b> <b>on</b> <b>non-target</b> <b>species</b> or determine how the silvicultural treatments affect a site's overall woody biomass production. Experimental silvicultural practices targeted in this study to improve white spruce survival had profound effects on other dominant upland tree species such as quaking aspen (Populus tremuloides Michx.) and Alaska birch (Betula neoalaskana Sarg.). Interior Alaska timber species demonstrate different regeneration strategies to post-disturbance environmental conditions, especially residual organic soil layer thickness and spatial configuration of surviving potential seed sources. Effective silvicultural practices must consider each species' unique reproductive biology, and clonal sprouting as a source of aspen persistence was a particularly important example in our study. Site differences, such as we found between the slope and ridge landforms, are a key consideration for implementing effective silvicultural practices. Significant interactions between the regeneration treatments and landform types proved to be critical to meet specific reforestation objectives, particularly the different herbaceous vegetation cover types, presence/absence of aspen clonal rootstocks, and spatial configurations regarding seed sources. Managing mixed species stands, which are common in the lightly managed portions of the boreal forest, requires not only the consideration of the future crop tree, but the interacting effects of silvicultural practices on all tree species...|$|R

40|$|Six {{types of}} {{pheromone}} traps were tested between 2012 and 2014 in the High Tatra Mountains, northern Slovakia. Traps were baited with lures for attracting the European {{spruce bark beetle}} (Ips typographus L.) (Coleoptera: Curculionidae, Scolytinae). Among the tested traps, four types are commercial products; Theysohn (T-trap), Ecotrap (E-trap), Lindgren funnel trap (L-trap), BEKA trap (B-trap) and two are our newly developed models; Funnel trap (P-trap) and Cross trap (K-trap). The traps were set up on ten selected sites and tested during three growing seasons (2012, 2013 and 2014). The newly developed models were compared to the commercially available models for trapping efficiency of target pest, {{easy to use and}} <b>impact</b> <b>on</b> <b>non-target</b> insect <b>species.</b> We found that the best commercially available model is the L-trap, however the bottom of L-trap is considered too shallow resulting in an accumulation of rainwater that increases the traps attractiveness for Silphids. In our experiment, the newly developed models; P-trap and K-trap performed better compared to commercially used models. P-trap caught 28 % more I. typographus and K-trap caught 57 % more beetles compared to T-trap in 2014. There are additional advantages of the newly developed traps such as easy handling, good rainwater drainage, higher collection container volume, and scale marking within the collection container. The results of this study have encouraged us to patent P-trap and K-trap as utility models...|$|R
40|$|Recently, {{the role}} which {{fisheries}} {{play in the}} provision of marine ecosystem services has been more widely acknowledged, largely as a result in recent years of fisheries management organisations developing and adopting more ecosystem-based approaches to fisheries management (EAFM). Accordingly, several important management and science challenges have been identified. We argue that these challenges represent a number of important steps which underpin effective science based fisheries management, and when taken together and integrated, offer a logical framework by which to best achieve an EAFM. The challenges, or steps of the framework, identified and described are, i. defining appropriate spatial management units based upon significant and coherent ecosystem production processes, ii. assessing multi-species stock dynamics, iii. developing mixed fisheries management approaches, and iv. assessing the <b>impacts</b> of fisheries <b>on</b> <b>non-target</b> <b>species</b> and ecosystem components. The paper considers how the knowledge gained from research on these challenges can be applied to a risk-based management framework as an essential step towards the achievement of the Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) 14 with respect to the conservation and sustainable use of marine resources for sustainable development...|$|R
40|$|The LUBILOSA (Lutte Biologique contre les Locusts et les Sauteriaux) Programme {{has been}} working on the {{development}} of a myco-insecticide for the control of locusts and grasshoppers for the past 9 years. The resulting myco-insecticide product (trade name Green MuscleTM) is based on an oil formulation of aerial conidia of the fungal entomopa-thogen, Metarhizium anisopliae var. acridum. Field testing of this myco-insecticide in sou-thern Africa has been conducted in close collaboration with the Locust and Termite Research Division of the Plant Protection Research Institute, South Africa. Trials have been conducted against Brown Locust, Locustana pardalina, in the Karoo region of South Africa and the Red Locust, Nomadacris septemfasciata, in the Buzi outbreak area of Moz-ambique. High (H 90 %) insect mortalities have been demonstrated following field appli-cations with standard ultra low volume (ULV) spraying equipment normally used in acridid control. Moreover, extensive eco-toxicological work has shown that Green MuscleTM has minimal <b>impact</b> <b>on</b> other <b>non-target</b> <b>species,</b> including other insects, reptiles, birds and mammals. Accordingly, Metarhizium has been recommended by the Food and Agriculture Organisation (FAO) Pesticide Referee Group for locust control in environmen-tally sensitive areas. Most significantly, Green MuscleTM has recently undergone successful registration for locust control in South Africa. This represents a fundamental breakthrough in locust control and creates, for the first time, real opportunities {{to move away from the}} use of chemicals towards more integrated control strategies incorporating biological con-trol techniques.

40|$|Seabirds, turtles and {{sharks are}} often of {{conservation}} concern {{because they are}} frequently bycatch in fisheries. Fisheries managers shifting from a target species focus to an ecosystem-based approach are being required to consider the <b>impact</b> of fisheries <b>on</b> <b>non-target</b> <b>species.</b> There are a range of complementary management tools that help reduce bycatch, such as gear restrictions, temporal restrictions, and bycatch reduction devices. One management approach that is increasingly being considered is fisheries closures. We tested the utility of 3 closure approaches for the improved protection of bycatch species in the South African pelagic longline fishery. As there was some variation where and when different groups of bycatch species were caught, we found that temporary spatial closures were the most effective strategy for both protecting bycatch and minimizing the cost to fishers. This is logical because having mobile closures {{in space and time}} provides more flexibility than permanent spatial closures or seasonal closures. However these benefits need to be traded off against the costs and problems of implementing temporary spatial closures. Of the 2 sub-optimal strategies, we discovered that seasonal closures are significantly less effective than spatial closures...|$|R
40|$|Fisheries {{management}} in European waters is gradually {{moving from a}} single-species perspective towards a more holistic ecosystem approach to management (EAM), acknowledging {{the need to take}} all ecosystem components into account. Prerequisite within an EAM is the need for management processes that directly influence the ecological effects of fishing, such as the mortality of target and <b>non-target</b> <b>species.</b> Up until recently, placing limits on the quantities of fish that can be landed, through the imposition of annual total allowable catches (TACs) for the target species, has been the principal management mechanism employed. However, pressure <b>on</b> <b>non-target</b> components of marine ecosystems is more closely linked to prevailing levels of fishing activity, so only if TACs are closely related to subsequent fishing effort will TAC management serve to control the broader ecosystem impacts of fishing. We show that in the mixed fisheries that characterise the North Sea, the linkage between variation in TAC and the resulting fishing effort is in fact generally weak. Reliance solely on TACs to regulate fishing activity is therefore unlikely to mitigate the <b>impacts</b> of fishing <b>on</b> <b>non-target</b> <b>species.</b> Consequently, we conclude that the relationship between TACs and effort is insufficient for TACs to be used as the principal management tool within an EAM.

Adult apterae that developed on Rapier wheat had their mean relative growth rate (MRGR) reduced by 6 and 9 % under uncrowded and crowded conditions, respectively, whereas the crowding treatment reduced MRGR by 3 %, but only in Rapier aphids. Rapier resistance also reduced adult dry weight by 13 and 14 % under crowded and uncrowded conditions, respectively, whereas crowding reduced it by 34 and 35 % in Rapier and Huntsman aphids, respectively. Development on Rapier substantially reduced the topical LC 50 of malathion by 37. 8 and 34. 8 % under crowded and uncrowded conditions, suggesting that plant antibiosis increased malathion susceptibility. By comparison, crowding only reduced the LC 50 by 29. 5 and 26. 0 % on Huntsman and Rapier. The LD 50 data showed that reductions on aphid body size on Rapier and through crowding did not fully explain the differences in LC 50. This was particularly in the values for crowded aphids that were actually 80 % higher than for uncrowded ones.
