By early on the following day, the gale center had transitioned into a tropical storm, and it is estimated that Tropical Storm <b>Frances</b> developed at 0600UTC on October 23. <b>Frances</b> quickly strengthened after becoming a tropical storm, and was upgraded to a hurricane by 1800UTC on that same day. After becoming a hurricane, <b>Frances</b> curved northeastward, and remained well east of Bermuda. By midday on October 24, <b>Frances</b> peaked as an 85mph (140km/h) Category1 hurricane.|$|E
