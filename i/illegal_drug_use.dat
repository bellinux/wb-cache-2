25|$|Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas: A Savage Journey to the Heart of the American Dream is a {{novel by}} Hunter S. Thompson, {{illustrated}} by Ralph Steadman.

The story follows its protagonist, Raoul Duke, and his attorney, Dr. Gonzo, as they descend on Las Vegas to chase the American Dream through a drug-induced haze, all the while ruminating on {{the failure of the}} 1960s countercultural movement. The work is Thompson's most famous book, and is noted for its lurid descriptions of <b>illegal</b> <b>drug</b> <b>use</b> and its early retrospective on the culture of the 1960s. Its popularization of Thompson's highly subjective blend of fact and fiction has become known as gonzo journalism. The novel first appeared as a two-part series in Rolling Stone magazine in 1971, and was published as a book in 1972. It was later adapted into a film of the same name in 1998 by Terry Gilliam, starring Johnny Depp and Benicio del Toro who portrayed Raoul Duke and Dr. Gonzo, respectively.|$|E

25|$|Leading {{constitutional}} law scholar Erwin Chemerinsky {{participated in the}} same symposium, exploring how this decision would be understood and applied by school officials, school boards, and lower court judges. He suggested that the opinion was misguided and—from a First Amendment perspective—highly undesirable, arguing that the decision cannot be justified under existing First Amendment principles, {{that it could be}} seen as authorizing punishment of students for speech that is deemed distasteful or offensive, even just juvenile. However, he noted Justice Alito's concurring opinion, which suggests that the majority opinion might be exceedingly narrow and based on a very unusual factual context; Chemerinsky noted that if Justice Alito's opinion is seen as defining the scope of the holding, then the case establishes only the power of schools to punish speech encouraging <b>illegal</b> <b>drug</b> <b>use</b> rather than giving school officials great discretion to punish student speech. Thus, despite the fact that Morse v. Frederick is consistent with decisions from the Supreme Court and lower federal courts over the last two decades, his hope is that Chief Justice Roberts's majority opinion will be read through the prism of Justice Alito's concurring opinion, thereby having little effect on the already very limited First Amendment rights of students.|$|E

40|$|Objective: To {{determine}} the prevalence and predictors of antiretroviral therapy adherence among HIV/ AIDS patients in Kathmandu district. Methods: A cross-sectional study of 316 HIV-positive individuals receiving antiretroviral therapy from three ART sites in Kathmandu districts was done from January 2012 to February 2012. The participants were interviewed and answered questions about socio-demographic status and antiretroviral therapy {{during the past}} week. Participants were considered adherent if they reported taking ≥ 95 % of their medication as prescribed. The association between explanatory variables and adherence was measured using logistic regression and was reported as odds ratio (OR) with 95 % confidence interval. Results: Out of the 316 participants, 64. 6 % (n= 201) were men and 35. 4 % (n= 112) were women. The adherence prevalence of the study participants was 86. 7 % (n= 274). The adherence prevalence in {{men and women were}} 84. 3 % and 91 %, respectively. Age (OR 1. 04; 95 % CI 1. 00 - 1. 09), time taken to reach ART center (OR 1. 38; 95 % CI 1. 12 - 1. 71), past <b>illegal</b> <b>drugs</b> <b>use</b> (OR 3. 98; 95 % CI 1. 71 - 9. 24), side effects (OR 4. 88; 95 % CI 1. 09 - 21. 8), were all independently and negatively associated with adherence. Whereas, use of reminder tools (OR 3. 45; 95 % CI 1. 33 - 8. 91) was independently and positively associated with adherence. Conclusion: The prevalence of adherence found in this study is encouraging. Age, time taken to reach ART center, side effects, <b>illegal</b> <b>drugs</b> <b>use</b> and not using reminder tools present barriers for adherence to ART. Improving adherence requires interventions which recognize these barriers. Key Words: Antiretroviral Therapy (ART), Adherence, Kathmandu, AIDS patient...|$|R
