40|$|Domestic {{central heating}} systems result in micro bubble {{nucleation}} and detachment at the boiler wall {{due to the}} presence of supersaturated conditions in the system. Such conditions originate due to the widespread use of untreated tap water in such systems and due to the air leakage into the system’s closed loop circuit during the daily thermal cycling. The presence of air bubbles in such systems results in a number of undesired effects such as corrosion, blockages, noise and the filling of radiators with air due to the deposit of the micro bubbles in the radiators. As a result, a loss in the heat transfer area of the radiator occurs thus resulting in an inefficient use, consequently increasing the carbon footprint of such widely used systems. Therefore, the capture of micro bubbles at the exit point of the boiler should result in improved system efficiencies. A comprehensive knowledge of the expected bubble production rate and bubble size is important for an efficient <b>deaeration</b> <b>system.</b> To date, no studies have been published on the fundamentals of bubble production and size in wet central heating systems, therefore, the importance of this paper for the building services industry. Experimental results on a test rig incorporating a typical 19 kW (rated) domestic gas fired boiler show typical micro bubble production rates ranging between 0. 03 to 0. 47 litres of nitrogen gas per hour with a shift in the system heating load. An analysis of the expected bubble diameters was done at different system conditions. Bubbles with average diameters within the range of 0. 13 and 0. 39 mm were observed. A comparison with Winterton’s finite angle force balance model resulted in reasonable predictions...|$|E
40|$|A {{system for}} continuous, rapid {{deaeration}} of hydraulic oil {{has been built}} to replace a prior system that effected deaeration more slowly in a cyclic pressure/ vacuum process. Such systems are needed because (1) hydraulic oil has an affinity for air, typically containing between 10 and 15 volume percent of air and (2) in the original application for which these systems were built, there is a requirement to keep the proportion of dissolved air below 1 volume percent because a greater proportion can lead to pump cavitation and excessive softness in hydraulic-actuator force-versus-displacement characteristics. In addition to overcoming several deficiencies of the prior <b>deaeration</b> <b>system,</b> the present system removes water from the oil. The system (see figure) includes a pump that continuously circulates oil {{at a rate of}} 10 gal/min (38 L/min) between an 80 -gal (303 -L) airless reservoir and a tank containing a vacuum. When the circulation pump is started, oil is pumped, at a pressure of 120 psi (827 kPa), through a venturi tube below the tank with a connection to a stand-pipe in the tank. This action draws oil out of the tank via the standpipe. At the same time, oil is sprayed into the tank in a fine mist, thereby exposing a large amount of oil to the vacuum. When the oil level in the tank falls below the lower of two level switches, a vacuum pump is started, drawing a hard vacuum on the tank through a trap that collects any oil and water entrained in the airflow. When the oil level rises above higher of the two level switches or when the system is shut down, a solenoid valve between the tank and the vacuum pump is closed to prevent suction of oil into the vacuum pump. Critical requirements that the system is designed to satisfy include the following: 1) The circulation pump must have sufficient volume and pressure to operate the venturi tube and spray nozzles. 2) The venturi tube must be sized to empty the tank (except for the oil retained by the standpipe) and maintain a vacuum against the vacuum pump. 3) The tank must be strong enough to withstand atmospheric pressure against the vacuum inside and must have sufficient volume to enable exposure of a sufficiently large amount of sprayed oil to the vacuum. 4) The spray nozzles must be sized to atomize the oil and to ensure that the rate of flow of sprayed oil does not exceed {{the rate at which the}} venturi action can empty the tank. 5) The vacuum pump must produce a hard vacuum against the venturi tube and continue to work when it ingests some oil and water. 6) Fittings must be made vacuum tight (by use of O-rings) to prevent leakage of air into the system. The system is fully automatic, and can be allowed to remain in operation with very little monitoring. It is capable of reducing the air content of the oil from 11 to less than 1 volume percent in about 4 hours and to keep the water content below 100 parts per million...|$|E
40|$|International audienceWet {{central heating}} systems are used {{throughout}} {{the world and the}} domestic variants are known to account for 16 % of the carbon dioxide emissions in the UK. It is an industry wide fact that significant quantities of air leak into the system's closed loop circuit, mostly due to thermal cycling during routine use. The water in the system results in high dissolved gas saturation levels thus resulting in micro bubble nucleation and detachment at the boiler wall. An in depth knowledge into the behaviour of micro bubbles in such systems could result in better <b>deaeration</b> <b>systems</b> thus improving the overall system efficiency. In this study, we will report a measurement of the bubble detachment sizes in this system at different operating conditions, these being, the system flow rate, pressure, heating load and saturation ratio. The Winterton models for zero and finite contact angles for the prediction of the bubble detachment diameters in supersaturated solutions were used as a comparison with the test results. The model for the prediction of bubble detachment diameters at finite contact angles in round pipes has yielded good predictions. A new correlation has been proposed so as to include the effects of pressure and heat flux on the bubble characteristics which were not represented through the Winterton model...|$|R
40|$|The {{operation}} of pre-industrial membrane distillation (MD) units {{is of great}} importance in order to implement this new technology. The systematic development from module to plant design for MD is conducted in an industrial research-cooperation. The consequent up-scaling from a lab plant at Hamburg University of Technology (TUHH) for MD module evaluation to a pre-industrial plant is presented. Permeate gap MD (PGMD) and Direct Contact MD (DCMD) spiral wound modules with different channel lengths {{have been used in}} this study to evaluate the most suitable module configuration and design. It has been decided to go along with DCMD modules with a relatively short channel length. A pilot plant for on land testing has been built and operated for 9 months before constructing the pre-industrial unit. In the pre-industrial plant waste heat was used and a heat recovery and recycle concept was implemented and tested successfully. It has been proven that long-term operation with real seawater is possible without significant performance decline. Besides operational data also MD plant design specifics will be discussed. The importance of ambient pressure conditions for the MD modules was determined. In addition, the possibility of piping <b>system</b> <b>deaeration</b> is discussed...|$|R
