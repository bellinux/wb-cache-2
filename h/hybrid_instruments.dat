25|$|Instruments {{that have}} a five-string banjo neck on a wooden body (for example, a guitar, bouzouki, or dobro body) have also been made, such as the banjola. A 20th-Century Turkish {{instrument}} similar to the banjo is called the cümbüş—which has been made into eight different <b>hybrid</b> <b>instruments,</b> including guitar, mandolin, ukulele, and oud. At {{the end of the}} twentieth century, a development of the five-string banjo was the BanSitar. This features a bone bridge, giving the instrument a sitar-like resonance. A recent innovation is the patented Banjo-Tam, invented by Frank Abrams of Asheville North Carolina combining a traditional five string banjo neck with a tambourine as a rim or pot.|$|E
25|$|A {{number of}} <b>hybrid</b> <b>instruments</b> exist, {{crossing}} the banjo with other stringed instruments. Most of these use {{the body of}} a banjo, often with a resonator, and the neck of the other instrument. Examples include the banjo mandolin (first patented in 1882) and the banjo ukulele or banjolele, most famously played by the English comedian George Formby. These were especially popular {{in the early decades of}} the twentieth century, and were probably a result of a desire either to allow players of other instruments to jump on the banjo bandwagon at the height of its popularity, or to get the natural amplification benefits of the banjo resonator in an age before electric amplification.|$|E
2500|$|Particle {{detection}} of alpha and beta can {{used in both}} integral and two-piece designs. A pancake probe (for alpha/beta) is generally used to increase the area of detection in two-piece instruments whilst being relatively light weight. In integral instruments using an end window tube there is a window {{in the body of}} the casing to prevent shielding of particles. [...] There are also <b>hybrid</b> <b>instruments</b> which have a separate probe for particle detection and a gamma detection tube within the electronics module. The detectors are switchable by the operator, depending the radiation type that is being measured.|$|E
40|$|A <b>hybrid</b> wind <b>instrument</b> is {{constructed}} {{by putting a}} theoretical excitation model (such as a real-time computed physical model of a clarinet embouchure) in interaction with a real wind instrument resonator. In previous work, the successful construction of a <b>hybrid</b> wind <b>instrument</b> has been demonstrated, with the interaction facilitated by a loudspeaker and a microphone placed {{at the entrance of}} a clarinet-like tube. The present paper focuses on some key findings, concentrating particularly on the “musical instrument” and “research tool” perspectives. The limitations of the hybrid set-up are considered. In particular, the choice of the loudspeaker used in the set-up is explained and the occurrence (and prevention) of instabilities during the operation of the <b>hybrid</b> <b>instrument</b> are discussed. For the design of excitation models used to drive the <b>hybrid</b> <b>instrument,</b> the usefulness of dimensionless and reduced parameter forms is outlined. In contrast to previously reported physically based excitation models, it is demonstrated that a purely mathematical “polynomial model” enables an independent control of separate sound features. For all excitation models, the sounds produced with the <b>hybrid</b> <b>instrument</b> are shown to match to those predicted by simulation. However, the <b>hybrid</b> <b>instrument</b> is more easily destabilized for certain extreme parameter states...|$|R

40|$|Abstract Despite the {{prevalence}} of grandfathered permits, we still observe that a hybrid policy, in which a fraction of initial emission permits is distributed through auctions, is adopted in some cases. We also observe that some polluting industries support auctioned permits, and that most environmental groups support grandfathered permits. This paper at-tempts to explain these phenomena {{from the perspective of}} political economy, and investi-gates the conditions under which grandfathering, auctions, or a <b>hybrid</b> <b>instrument</b> will be the equilibrium policy. By constructing a two-stage lobbying game, in which the type of policy instrument (auction, grandfathering, or a <b>hybrid</b> <b>instrument)</b> is determined in the first stage, and then the number of permits is decided in the second stage, we highlight the strategic interaction of the lobbying activities between the two stages in explaining the behavior of the lobbying groups...|$|R

40|$|Using a {{magnetic}} sector/quadrupole hybrid tandem mass spectrometer designed for high transmission at high ion energies (400 - 500 eV), {{it has been}} possible to obtain tandem mass spectra results for high-mass ions (m/z 1000 - 2500) which resemble those achieved with four-sector tandem instruments. With a number of peptide ions, the high laboratory collision energies (at 400 - 500 eV compared to 30 eV) led to the observation of fragmentations which were not present at lower energies. At constant center-of-mass collision energy, changing the collision gas from Ar to He {{and at the same}} time changing laboratory collision energies from 400 to 4000 eV, resulted in more high-energy fragmentation pathways. This implies a greater uptake of internal energy with He collision gas. In the case of dynorphin A fragment 1 -g, a tandem mass spectrum was obtained with the <b>hybrid</b> <b>instrument</b> using 500 pmol of sample whereas a previous attempt had failed to obtain useful fragmentation by collisional activation in a <b>hybrid</b> <b>instrument...</b>|$|R

5000|$|In May 1998 the CFTC {{issued a}} 'concept release' {{requesting}} comment on whether regulation of OTC derivatives markets was appropriate and, if so, what form such regulation should take. Legislation enacted in 1999 {{at the request}} of the US Treasury, the Federal Reserve Board, and the SEC limited the CFTC's rulemaking authority with respect to swaps and <b>hybrid</b> <b>instruments</b> until March 30, 1999, and froze the pre-existing legal status of swap agreements and <b>hybrid</b> <b>instruments</b> entered into in reliance on the 'Swap Exemption', the 'Hybrid Instrument Rule', the 'Swap Policy Statement, or the 'Hybrid Interpretation'.
