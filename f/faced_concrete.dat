40|$|Abstract: <b>Concrete</b> <b>face</b> {{rockfill}} dams (CFRDs) {{are gaining}} a worldwide recognition {{as the most}} economical type of dams to be constructed in extreme northern and sub-Antarctic regions. Height of CFRDs may exceed 200 m. Safety of CFRDs depends on the proper design, construction, and monitoring of actual behaviour during the construction and during {{the operation of the}} structure. The main concern for the safety of CFRDs is the deformation of the <b>concrete</b> <b>face.</b> During the reservoir filling, the load of the water and deformations of the dam rockfill, force upstream concrete slab to deform. The displacements of the <b>concrete</b> <b>face</b> during the reservoir filling should not exceed the maximum allowed values {{in order to maintain the}} structural integrity of the <b>concrete</b> <b>face.</b> In a classic CFRD where the <b>concrete</b> <b>face</b> is constructed after the end of construction of the rockfill embankment, it is very important to estimate the displacements of the <b>concrete</b> <b>face</b> during the filling of the reservoir and to verify if these displacements are lower than displacements compatible with the structural integrity of the <b>concrete</b> <b>face.</b> Due to the uncertainty of the model parameters, careful monitoring of the dam and its surroundings are required in order to verify and enhance the model. The paper presents a study of behaviour of the Shibuya Dam in P. R. China, the tallest (233 m) <b>concrete</b> <b>face</b> rockfill dam in the world using results of monitoring and FEM analysis. The study shows that the in real time fusion of the monitoring results and FEM analysis would give indication that the deformations of the <b>concrete</b> <b>face</b> reached critical values before the reservoir level reached the maximum level. This information could trigger the proper action from engineering team and lead to prevention of the cracking of the <b>concrete</b> <b>face...</b>|$|R

The type of mould release technology used, has a direct effect on the surface finish of the formation of fair <b>faced</b> <b>concrete,</b> and this in turn affects long term durability and surface finish. This paper examines two mould release agents, one permeable formwork liner and Type 1 polypropylene fibres used with a single mould release agent. Cubes were cast in film faced plywood moulds using a C 40 concrete that enabled comparisons to be drawn between the mould release agents. The range of variables tested comprised of, two (FS and CL) commercially available solvent based mould release agents (MRA), permeable formwork and C 1 used with polypropylene fibres. The results showed that the controlled permeability formwork (CPF) liner produced the fewest blowholes and was the best performing technology used in that respect. As a consequence of this, CPF provided the most likely finish that would provide long term durability. None of the technologies employed produced a completely uniform colour throughout, however the CL MRA cubes and polypropylene fibre reinforced cubes produced the most consistent colouring...|$|E

40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{a study on}} the numerical performance of three contact simulation methods, namely, the interface element, thin-layer element, and contact analysis methods, through the analysis of the contact behavior between the <b>concrete</b> <b>face</b> slab and the dam body of a high concrete-faced rockfill dam named Tianshengqiao-I in China. To investigate the accuracy and limitations of each method, the simulation results are compared in terms of the dam deformation, contact stress along the interface, stresses in the <b>concrete</b> <b>face</b> slab, and separation of the <b>concrete</b> <b>face</b> slab from the cushion layer. In particular, the predicted dam deformation and slab separation are compared with the in-situ observation data to classify these methods according to their agreement with the in-situ observations. It is revealed that the interface element and thin-layer element methods have their limitations in predicting contact stress, slab separation, and stresses in the <b>concrete</b> <b>face</b> slab if a large slip occurs. The contact analysis method seems to be the best choice whether the separation is finite or not...|$|R

40|$|The author {{considered}} {{the results of}} the numerical studies of stress-strain state of a 100 m high rockfill dam with a reinforced <b>concrete</b> <b>face.</b> In the analysis, the dam construction sequence and loads applied to it were considered; it was assumed that the reinforced <b>concrete</b> <b>face</b> was constructed after filling the dam. The calculations were carried out in the elastic formulation at various moduli of deformation and Poisson’s ratio. It was revealed that at rockfill settlement under the action of hydrostatic pressure the reinforced <b>concrete</b> <b>face</b> not only bends but also is subject to longitudinal force. The development of these forces is connected not only with rockfill shear deformation in horizontal direction. Depending on the value of rockfill Poisson’s ratio these longitudinal forces may be both compressive and tensile. At the Poisson’s ratio exceeding 0. 25 the longitudinal forces are tensile, and when it is equal to 0. 2 - they are compressive. Evidently these particular longitudinal forces are the course of crack formation in reinforced <b>concrete</b> <b>faces</b> of a number of constructed dams. The indirect confirmation of the development of tensile forces on the face is the fact that actually in all the dams with reinforced <b>concrete</b> <b>face</b> opening of perimeter joint was observed. Thus, in order to provide the strength of reinforced concrete it is important to increase rockfill shear modulus. Only the decrease of stone compressibility (i. e. increase of linear deformation modulus E) will slightly improve the stress state of the face, as the value of E has less effect on settlements and shear of the dam than Poisson’s ratio. High rockfill dams with reinforced <b>concrete</b> <b>face</b> may have a favorable stress state only at narrow site when the face horizontal displacements are inconsiderable and due to the settlements of rockfill in the face the forces are compressive but not tensile longitudinal forces...|$|R
