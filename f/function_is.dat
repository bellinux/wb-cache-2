5|$|An {{analytic}} <b>function</b> <b>is</b> uniquely {{extended to}} a holomorphic function {{on an open}} disk in the complex plane. This makes the machinery of complex analysis available.|$|E
5|$|The {{convergence}} of both series has very different properties. Even if the Taylor series has positive convergence radius, the resulting series may not {{coincide with the}} function; but if the <b>function</b> <b>is</b> analytic then the series converges pointwise to the function, and uniformly on every compact subset of the convergence interval. Concerning the Fourier series, if the <b>function</b> <b>is</b> square-integrable then the series converges in quadratic mean, but additional requirements are needed to ensure the pointwise or uniform convergence (for instance, if the <b>function</b> <b>is</b> periodic and of class C1 then the convergence is uniform).|$|E
40|$|AbstractA {{new class}} of functions, termed semistrictly preinvex <b>functions,</b> <b>is</b> {{introduced}} in this paper. Some properties of semistrictly preinvex <b>functions</b> <b>are</b> discussed. In particular, the relationship between semistrictly preinvex functions and preinvex <b>functions</b> <b>is</b> investigated. Some characterization properties of semistrictly preinvex <b>functions</b> <b>are</b> derived under a lower semicontinuous condition, and a gradient property of semistrictly preinvex <b>functions</b> <b>is</b> obtained...|$|R
30|$|From Definition  3, {{it follows}} that 2 -convex <b>functions</b> <b>are</b> just convex <b>functions.</b> Furthermore, 1 -convex <b>functions</b> <b>are</b> {{increasing}} <b>functions</b> and 0 -convex <b>functions</b> <b>are</b> nonnegative <b>functions.</b>|$|R

5|$|A further type of (mostly strong red and yellow) {{emergence}} {{has recently}} been discovered in a few Australian species (D. hartmeyerorum, D. indica). Their <b>function</b> <b>is</b> not known yet, although they may help in attracting prey.|$|E
5|$|A mixed {{inhibitor}} binds to an {{allosteric site}} and the binding of the substrate and the inhibitor affect each other. The enzyme's <b>function</b> <b>is</b> reduced but not eliminated when bound to the inhibitor. This type of inhibitor does not follow the Michaelis-Menten equation.|$|E
50|$|Function names {{end with}} a period. Internal and {{external}} <b>functions</b> <b>are</b> supported. Internal <b>functions</b> <b>are</b> compiled {{as part of the}} program in which they are used and share declarations and variables with the main program. External <b>functions</b> <b>are</b> compiled separately and do not share declarations and variables. A one statement definition of internal <b>functions</b> <b>is</b> permitted. Recursive <b>functions</b> <b>are</b> permitted, although the function must do some of the required saving and restoring work itself.|$|R
30|$|Summing up {{the above}} observations, we can present in Figure  2 Venn’s diagram for {{continuous}} functions under our investigation. The classes of almost-periodic, semi-periodic and quasi-periodic <b>functions</b> <b>are</b> in circles, while sums of semi-periodic <b>functions</b> <b>are</b> in the ellipse. Sums of periodic <b>functions</b> <b>are</b> in {{the intersection of}} the classes of quasi-periodic functions and sums of semi-periodic functions. In fact, one can check by similar arguments as in the proof of Theorem  2 that a sum of periodic <b>functions</b> <b>is</b> exactly the sum of semi-periodic <b>functions</b> which <b>is</b> quasi-periodic. Periodic <b>functions</b> <b>are,</b> according to Theorem  2, at the same time semi-periodic and quasi-periodic. Purely semi-periodic <b>functions</b> <b>are</b> in the grey strip.|$|R
50|$|In mathematics, coarse <b>functions</b> <b>are</b> <b>functions</b> {{that may}} appear to be {{continuous}} at a distance, but in reality are not necessarily continuous. Although continuous <b>functions</b> <b>are</b> usually observed on a small scale, coarse <b>functions</b> <b>are</b> usually observed on a large scale.|$|R

5|$|In applied mathematics, as we {{have done}} here, the delta <b>function</b> <b>is</b> often {{manipulated}} {{as a kind of}} limit (a weak limit) of a sequence of functions, each member of which has a tall spike at the origin: for example, a sequence of Gaussian distributions centered at the origin with variance tending to zero.|$|E
5|$|In {{inorganic}} chemistry, hydrides {{can also}} serve as bridging ligands that link two metal centers in a coordination complex.

However, the point-price elasticity can be computed only if the formula for the demand <b>function,</b> , <b>is</b> known so its derivative with respect to price, , can be determined.|$|E
5|$|Kidney {{dysfunction}} typically develops 1–2days {{after the}} initial muscle damage. If supportive treatment is inadequate to manage this, renal replacement therapy (RRT) may be required. RRT removes excess potassium, acid and phosphate that accumulate when the kidneys are unable to function normally and is required until kidney <b>function</b> <b>is</b> regained.|$|E
5|$|Metformin is {{recommended}} to be temporarily discontinued before any radiographic study involving iodinated contrast agents, (such as a contrast-enhanced CT scan or angiogram), as the contrast dye may temporarily impair kidney function, indirectly leading to lactic acidosis by causing retention of metformin in the body. Metformin can be resumed after two days, assuming kidney <b>function</b> <b>is</b> normal.|$|E
