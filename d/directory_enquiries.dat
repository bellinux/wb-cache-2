25|$|Common {{practice}} in the Northern Ireland Civil Service, Derry City Council, and in communication throughout business and other organisations within Northern Ireland, when responding to {{a letter from a}} correspondent from the city or county, is to reply using the same nomenclature as the initial communication. Therefore, a letter addressed Derry will be replied to an address in Derry, while a letter addressed from Londonderry will be returned to an address in Londonderry. When the UK <b>directory</b> <b>enquiries</b> service was demonopolised in 2003, Oftel guidelines specifically required addresses using either name to be accessible.|$|E
25|$|These {{services}} offer users {{recommendations on}} {{what they should do}} next. An example would be recommending a user a similar ringtone to the one that s/he has just browsed for. They operate, in a mobile context, in a similar way to the recommendation engines provided by internet retail shops such as Amazon.com. An example of real usage is the <b>Directory</b> <b>Enquiries</b> (DQ) service operated by Orange in the UK. Callers to the Orange landline DQ service are given the business and residential numbers they have requested verbally by an operator. In addition, Orange sends the information in text format to the users mobile phone. The information contains a text reminder of the requested information as well as links to local businesses, services and other interesting information in the local area that the user has searched on.|$|E

40|$|A {{number of}} European countries, {{among them the}} UK and Spain, have opened up their <b>Directory</b> <b>Enquiry</b> Services (DQs) market to competition. In Spain, both local and foreign firms {{challenged}} the incumbent as of April 2003. The latter raised its rivals' costs and forced quality downgrading by providing an inferior quality version of the (essential) input, namely the subscribers database. We illustrate {{how it is possible}} to quantify the effect of the practice in a situation where an entrant has no previous history in the market. We use the UK experience to construct the relevant counterfactual, that is, the but-for scenario. After controlling for relative prices and advertising intensity, we find that one of the foreign entrants achieved a Spanish market share substantially below what it would have obtained in the absence of abuse. While the case was taken to Court {{and the nature of the}} abuse was recognized, the amount of damages awarded was limited to evidence of invoice-based inflated input costs, while estimates derived from construction of the but-for scenario were dismissed. This initial ruling was upheld on appeal. At the time of writing, an appeal had been lodged with the Tribunal Supremo (highest Appeal Court) regarding the quantum of damages. We believe that the limited amount of damages probably reflects a mixture of an overly conservative attitude towards damage awards, coupled with a lack of understanding of the underlying economic reasoning of the case, as well as of the quantitative evidence presented by the aggrieved party. ...|$|R
40|$|The {{research}} {{described in}} this thesis {{is part of a}} study undertaken by the Post Office to determine criteria for the evaluation of training. In particular the training of operators for switchboards at Auto Manual Centres (AMCs) is investigated. This is done both at AMCs and in training centres known as Wing Schools. The similarilies and differences between the training at AMCs and Wing Schools are discussed, together with a brief outline of the work itself and the recruitment process. The work is considered quasi-repetitive, and includes an element of decision-making. Measures of output exist, which are used by management to determine staffing levels. These measures are considered for the purpose of assessing training effectiveness, which is seen as the core of the problem of evaluating training. However, they are shown to be unsuitable in this role, and a simpler measure of progress is proposed. By activity sampling methods, the existence of activity profiles is shown for experienced operators. The profiles are affected by the traffic mix in the AMC, but are seen as a means of comparing trainees' progress in different locations. Activity sampling observations of trainees compare the effects of practice on live and simulated traffic during their initial training period, and for a further five months of post-training experience. Additionally, comparisons are drawn between successful and unsuccessful trainees. Next, objective tests using partial simulation of call situations are used to compare different methods of studying programmed texts. No difference is found between the methods but a comparison is made also between two different orders of training, wilh positive results. A brief study of costs shows that training in an AMC is Iikely to cost very much less than in a school, but also indicates that improved selection would show financial returns. The principal conclusions are that (a) Common activiy-profiles exist for trained operators within a particular exchange. (b) The profiles can be used in the assessment of training performance. (c) The benefit of training operators for <b>Directory</b> <b>Enquiry</b> work initially and subsequently training for switchboard operation should be given further investigation. (d) Training in an AMC is more cost-effective than at a Wing School. (e) A trainability test should be a useful addition to the present selection procedures...|$|R
