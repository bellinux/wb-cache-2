A {{study of}} the effect of {{strontium}} on some solidification parameters, such as <b>eutectic</b> nucleation <b>temperature,</b> <b>eutectic</b> growth <b>temperature,</b> <b>eutectic</b> undercooling <b>temperature</b> and <b>eutectic</b> undercooling time, has been carried out using thermal analysis for a composite reinforced with 15 vol. % SiCP and, for comparison, for an A 356 aluminum alloy. The composite is prepared by the melt stirring technique with a SiC particle size of 38 µm. Thermal analysis results show that the presence of SiCP in the unmodified A 356 aluminum alloy increases the <b>eutectic</b> growth <b>temperature</b> (TE) and the <b>eutectic</b> nucleation <b>temperature</b> (TNucl); on the contrary, SiCP decreases the <b>eutectic</b> undercooling <b>temperature</b> (∆θ) and the eutectic undercooling time (tE). These phenomena suggest that SiC particles give favorable conditions for the growth of eutectic silicon. On the other hand, the modification with strontium of the composite material, although showing basically the same effect on the eutectic parameters as the one described for the A 356 aluminum alloy, brings about certain differences due to the presence of the SiC particles. Microstructural analysis shows that the eutectic structures in the composite are coarser than those of the matrix alloy and {{they do not have the}} classic fibrous eutectic shape obtained in the matrix alloy.
