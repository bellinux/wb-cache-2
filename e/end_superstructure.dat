40|$|The {{first part}} of the thesis {{describes}} in general the many different types of bridge constructions with emphasis on integral concrete bridge constructions. The main characteristic of the latter is a rigid link between superstructure, intermediate piers and abutments at the <b>end</b> of <b>superstructure.</b> These concrete bridges therefore have no expansion joints and bearings at the <b>end</b> of <b>superstructure,</b> which would otherwise render them very expensive. Consequently the post-construction maintenance cost is significantly lower, since {{there is no need to}} replace frayed expansion joints, the usual high maintenance cost at conventional bridges. The current global economic state calls for radical low cost solutions and for these reasons the integral concrete bridges make a very interesting choice. In the second part of the thesis an integral concrete bridge is designed. Separate models for global and local analysis of the structure are made. Local analysis is used to design the overhang of the bridge deck. The model I have created with the Sofistik computer program is made of surface elements. In global analysis structure elements like the bridge deck and piers are dimensioned. The model is made of linear beams as a 3 D frame. The foundation ground rigidity has an extremely high influence on internal forces of the structure, therefore I model the soil behavior in global analysis with springs, attached to the piers. The results of internal forces are calculated with linear-elastic analysis and deformations with nonlinear static analysis. The modal analysis results have proven to be insignificant for the most part, except in the case of horizontal shift of the bridge deck. At the end of the thesis reinforced cross-sections in selected nodes are shown for the bridge deck and pier. The main purpose of the thesis is to demonstrate the possibility of designing the fore mentioned bridge as an integral concrete bridge construction, instead of semi-integral bridge construction. The actual construction is in fact being designed as semi-integral bridge construction. What I also found interesting in the thesis is comparison between design reinforcements results calculated with the Sofistik computer program and calculations made by following the eurocode guidelines...|$|R
