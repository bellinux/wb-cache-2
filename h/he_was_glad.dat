5|$|Russell T Davies {{scrapped}} a {{glass bowl}} storyline for the Partners in Crime slot in Series 4, as he decided {{this would make}} the story too contained, and that wasn't the tone he wanted. In his book The Writer's Tale, Davies remarked that <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>glad</b> he abandoned the idea, because The Simpsons Movie had a similar premise.|$|E
5|$|Although Taft was {{successful}} as Solicitor General, winning 15 of the 18 cases he argued before the Supreme Court, <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>glad</b> when in March 1891, the United States Congress {{created a new}} judgeship {{for each of the}} United States Courts of Appeal and Harrison appointed him to the Sixth Circuit, based in Cincinnati. In March 1892, Taft resigned as Solicitor General to resume his judicial career.|$|E
5|$|Grace {{comments}} {{in his memoirs}} that <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>glad</b> to make his hundredth century at Gloucestershire's ground. Excluding the two centuries not considered first-class by some modern statisticians, Grace's hundredth century came later in the same month when he scored 169 for Gloucestershire against Middlesex at Lord's. He scored his final first-class century in July 1904 for London County, reaching 166 against the Marylebone Cricket Club. He played first-class cricket for another four seasons, and scored 15 and 25 for the Gentlemen of England in his final outing, an innings defeat against Surrey.|$|E

5|$|After {{returning}} to Birmingham, Doyle soon linked up with Championship club Nottingham Forest on a short-term loan deal in December 2004. The loan was then extended {{to keep him}} at the City Ground {{for the rest of}} the season. Doyle made his first-team debut for Forest in a fifth-round FA Cup tie against Tottenham Hotspur on 20 February 2005. As the match approached half-time, Doyle gifted Tottenham the lead as a Jermain Defoe free kick bounced out of his hands and into the net, but Forest were able to equalise in the second half to take the tie to a replay. Even though Doyle only played in a further three league matches for Forest, he said <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>glad</b> to be able to play regular reserve-team football and the loan spell had exceeded his expectations. He was rumoured to be {{returning to}} Forest on loan for the following season, a move which did not occur.|$|E
5|$|The first presenters of Blue Peter were Christopher Trace and Leila Williams. Trace {{presented}} for nearly nine years, and Williams for just {{over three years}} (although no footage of her has been retained by the BBC). In the early days, as the show ran continuously on a weekly basis, other presenters occasionally stepped in to give the regular team a break. Artist Tony Hart and actress Ann Taylor both presented the show either in place of either Trace or Williams, or sometimes in place of both, with Taylor replacing Williams for six weeks in 1959 and presenting the show at least once alone, as did Hart. When Williams was fired from the show in 1962 following a series of spats with a newly appointed producer, Trace continued to present the show alone or with one-off presenters until a replacement was found. The role went to Anita West, who presented sixteen editions over a four-month period in 1962—the shortest tenure of any full-time presenter—before abruptly resigning due to her imminent divorce, a reason she hid from the producers. Her tenure was so short that no footage from her time on Blue Peter exists in the BBC Archives, although footage of her audition remains, along with that of Valerie Singleton and other auditionees. It was not until 1998 that West was officially recognised as a former presenter. John Noakes is the longest-serving presenter, having presented the show for over twelve years, and Konnie Huq is the longest-serving female presenter, with a tenure of over ten years, beating Valerie Singleton by three months. However, although Singleton left the series full-time in 1972 to present the spin-off series Blue Peter Special Assignment, she continued to be an occasional presenter until 1975. Singleton's last 'official' appearance on the show came on 20 October 1975 although she was also credited with appearing on the 1975 'review of the year' programme, broadcast on 29 December 1975 Sandra Michaels presented the show twice in April 1964 {{in the absence of}} Singleton and impressed producer Edward Barnes enough that he considered replacing Singleton, but Michaels turned him down and he opted to carry on with Singleton, something he admits in hindsight <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>glad</b> he did. The youngest presenter of Blue Peter was Yvette Fielding, who was eighteen when she began presenting, and the oldest was John Noakes, who was forty-four when he left. Only one presenter, Peter Duncan, had two stints of presenting, his first being from 1980 to 1984, and his second being from 1985 to 1986.|$|E
25|$|After the Louis-Schmeling fight, Jack Dempsey {{expressed}} {{the opinion that}} <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>glad</b> he never had to face Joe Louis in the ring. When Louis fell on hard financial times, Dempsey served as honorary chairman of a fund to assist Louis.|$|E

25|$|A week later, Engel {{listened to}} the first four composers and, though they {{followed}} his instructions, the songs were flat and nothing special.

Engel would later comment that <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>glad</b> Gayle had not followed his instructions.|$|E
25|$|Ewbank {{moved back}} to Oxford in {{retirement}} and wrote a book in 1977 called Football Greats. He {{was inducted into the}} Pro Football Hall of Fame in 1978, but said later that year that <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>glad</b> to be out of coaching. With the expansion of the NFL, he said, talent had become diluted and fielding a good team was difficult. Coaches, meanwhile, customarily took the blame for a team's failures, and the sport had become too violent.|$|E

25|$|Despite {{disagreeing with}} many of Bhaktivedanta Swami's {{required}} prohibitions, Ginsberg often sang the Hare Krishna mantra publicly {{as part of his}} philosophy and declared that it brought a state of ecstasy. <b>He</b> <b>was</b> <b>glad</b> that Bhaktivedanta Swami, an authentic swami from India, was now trying to spread the chanting in America. Along with other counterculture ideologists like Timothy Leary, Gary Snyder, and Alan Watts, Ginsberg hoped to incorporate Bhaktivedanta Swami and his chanting into the hippie movement, and agreed {{to take part in the}} Mantra-Rock Dance concert and to introduce the swami to the Haight-Ashbury hippie community.|$|E
25|$|The Guru {{stayed in}} the Ashram for two days, went around and saw all {{arrangements}} and joined the community meal. The volunteers felt, not {{the presence of a}} formal visitor, but the presence of an intimate advisor and an elderly leader. His presence and appreciation gave them renewed spirit and sense of commitment. The Guru was extremely happy to see a Pulaya boy in the kitchen to help the cooks. <b>He</b> <b>was</b> <b>glad</b> the seeds sown by him were proliferating and bearing fruit. The SNDP had most willingly taken over the task of supplying manpower for the endeavor, and continued to support until the Satyagraha was withdrawn.|$|E
25|$|In the 2009 offseason, the A's traded {{promising}} young star OF Carlos González, closer Huston Street and starting pitcher Greg Smith for Matt Holliday of the Colorado Rockies. On January 6, 2009, Jason Giambi signed a one-year, $4.6 {{million contract with}} a 2nd year option. Giambi said <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>glad</b> to be back as {{he put on his}} old number 16. Also signed were infielders Orlando Cabrera of the Chicago White Sox and Nomar Garciaparra of the Los Angeles Dodgers. The first half of the season the team played relatively poor, but finished the second half strong, yet still posting a losing record. Holliday was dealt to the St. Louis Cardinals for prospects and Giambi was released in August after spending time on the DL.|$|E

25|$|St-Pierre {{successfully}} {{defended his}} welterweight title against Dan Hardy on March 27, 2010, at UFC 111 {{which took place}} in Newark, NJ. St-Pierre dominated the fight with his wrestling. He caught Hardy in the first round with an armbar, but Hardy refused to tap and eventually fought out of the hold. In the fourth round St-Pierre caught Hardy in a kimura while in the reverse-mount position, but St-Pierre was again unable to finish Hardy before he was able to escape. St-Pierre {{went on to win the}} fight by unanimous decision (50–43, 50–44, 50–45). After the fight, he stated that <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>glad</b> to win but was not impressed by his performance, stating that he wanted to finish the fight which fans agreed. St-Pierre received harsh criticism for stalling the fight against Hardy and not being able to finish him.|$|E
25|$|At UFC 48 in June 2004, Sylvia {{returned}} to face Frank Mir for the vacant UFC Heavyweight Championship; he lost. Early {{on in the}} fight Mir trapped Sylvia's right arm in an armbar submission attempt. As Sylvia tried to escape the hold, Sylvia's right radius bone snapped about three inches below his elbow. Referee Herb Dean immediately stopped the fight and declared Sylvia unable to continue. Sylvia took exception to the decision and repeatedly claimed his arm was not broken (though the break could be explicitly seen on the slow-motion replay of the fight), even touching it and moving it around to demonstrate. Sylvia {{was taken to a}} local hospital where an x-ray revealed that his arm was in fact broken; he then took several months off to recuperate. Afterward, Sylvia said <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>glad</b> the referee stopped the fight, thereby saving his arm from further damage.|$|E
25|$|Almost {{immediately}} after the conclusion of peace Louis renewed his aggressions on the German frontier through the Réunions policy. Engaged in a serious struggle with the Ottoman Empire, the emperor was again slow to move, and although he joined the Association League against France in 1682 <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>glad</b> to make a truce at Regensburg two years later. In 1686 the League of Augsburg was formed by the emperor and the imperial princes, to preserve {{the terms of the}} treaties of Westphalia and of Nijmegen. The whole European position was now bound up with events in England, and the tension lasted until 1688, when William III of Orange won the English crown through the Glorious Revolution and Louis invaded Germany. In May 1689, the Grand Alliance was formed, including the emperor, the kings of England, Spain and Denmark, the elector of Brandenburg and others, and a fierce struggle against France was waged throughout almost the whole of western Europe. In general the several campaigns were favourable to the allies, and in September 1697, England, Spain and the United Provinces made peace with France at the Treaty of Rijswijk.|$|E
