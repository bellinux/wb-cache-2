Though {{the extent to which}} these principles can be applied to model-building without computers is an interesting issue (to be revisited below), there are at least two good reasons to consider <b>Empirical</b> <b>Modelling</b> in the first instance as computer-based. Without doubt, new technologies that are based on computers have had a transformative impact where the full exploitation of <b>Empirical</b> <b>Modelling</b> principles is concerned.

If a linear relationship is found to exist, the variables are said to be correlated. However, correlation does not prove causation, as both variables may be correlated with other, hidden, variables, or the dependent variable may [...] "reverse" [...] cause the independent variables, or the variables may be otherwise spuriously correlated. [...] For example, suppose there is a correlation between deaths by drowning and the volume of ice cream sales at a particular beach. Yet, both the number of people going swimming and the volume of ice cream sales increase as the weather gets hotter, and presumably the number of deaths by drowning is correlated with the number of people going swimming. Perhaps an increase in swimmers causes both the other variables to increase.|$|E

40|$|Educational {{technology}} {{has yet to}} deliver the benefits or successes that were expected in educational practice, especially in relation to issues other than the communication and delivery of teaching materials. Evidence suggests that these difficulties stem from the mismatch between formalised virtual learning environments and everyday sensemaking and between the rich potential for enhanced learning afforded by new technology and the constraints of old-style educational practice. In addressing this mismatch, some commentators suggest that the primary need is for a new culture of educational practice-and even that such a culture is already emerging, and others identify {{the need for a}} new paradigm for educational technology. The aim of this thesis is to explore the potential for a new paradigm for educational technology based on the principles and tools of <b>Empirical</b> <b>Modelling</b> (see [URL] The thesis builds upon previous research on <b>Empirical</b> <b>Modelling</b> as a constructionist approach to learning, and in particular Roe's doctoral thesis 'Computers for learning: an <b>Empirical</b> <b>Modelling</b> perspective'. Roe's treatment of <b>Empirical</b> <b>Modelling</b> can be viewed as generalising the use of spreadsheets for learning through applying 'programming by dependency' within the framework of existing educational practice. In contrast, this thesis is concerned at a more fundamental level with the contribution that <b>Empirical</b> <b>Modelling</b> can make to technology enhanced learning that may lead to new educational practices. In particular, it identifies eight significant characteristics of learning that are well-matched to <b>Empirical</b> <b>Modelling</b> activity, and associates these with experimental, flexible and meaningful strands in learning. The credentials of <b>Empirical</b> <b>Modelling</b> as a potential new foundation for educational technology are enhanced by demonstrating that <b>Empirical</b> <b>Modelling</b> is radically different from traditional software development and use. It provides a methodology for modelling with dependency that is more closely related to the use of spreadsheets for learning. The thesis elaborates on the relationship between <b>Empirical</b> <b>Modelling</b> and learning in a variety of different contexts, ways and applications. Three examples drawn from computer science higher education are explored to emphasise the experimental, flexible and meaningful characteristics of <b>Empirical</b> <b>Modelling.</b> This discussion of <b>Empirical</b> <b>Modelling</b> in a specific educational context is complemented by an investigation of its relevance to learning in a wider context, with reference to a broad range of subjects, to specific issues in language learning, and to the topics of lifelong learning and collaborative learning. Although the application of <b>Empirical</b> <b>Modelling</b> for learning is as yet too immature for large scale empirical studies, its potential is evaluated using informal empirical evidence arising from <b>Empirical</b> <b>Modelling</b> practice at Warwick. The sources for this evaluation are well-established teaching activities relating to <b>Empirical</b> <b>Modelling</b> in Computer Science at the University of 'Warwick, comprising an introductory module and a number of final year undergraduate projects. The thesis concludes by considering the extent to which <b>Empirical</b> <b>Modelling</b> can go beyond the support for constructionism envisaged by Roe, to address the broader agenda of supporting constructivist learning using computers.

By this token, <b>Empirical</b> <b>Modelling</b> principles may be an appropriate way to analyse varieties of <b>empirical</b> <b>modelling</b> that are not computer-based.

40|$|Purpose: The <b>empirical</b> <b>modelling</b> {{of major}} rapid {{prototyping}} (RP) {{processes such as}} fused deposition modelling (FDM), selective laser sintering (SLS) and stereolithography (SL) has {{attracted the attention of}} researchers in view of their contribution to the overall cost of the product. <b>Empirical</b> <b>modelling</b> techniques such as artificial neural network (ANN) and regression analysis have been paid considerable attention. In this paper, a powerful modelling technique using genetic programming (GP) for modelling the FDM process is introduced and the issues related to the <b>empirical</b> <b>modelling</b> of RP processes are discussed. The present work aims to investigate the performance of various potential <b>empirical</b> <b>modelling</b> techniques so that the choice of an appropriate modelling technique for a given RP process can be made. The paper aims to discuss these issues. Design/methodology/approach: Apart from the study of applications of <b>empirical</b> <b>modelling</b> techniques on RP processes, a multigene GP is applied to predict the compressive strength of a FDM part based on five given input process parameters. The parameter setting for GP is determined using trial and experimental runs. The performance of the GP model is compared to those of neural networks and regression analysis. Findings: The GP approach provides a model {{in the form of a}} mathematical equation reflecting the relationship between the compressive strength and five given input parameters. The performance of ANN is found to be better than those of GP and regression, showing the effectiveness of ANN in predicting the performance characteristics of the FDM part. The GP is able to identify the significant input parameters that comply with those of an earlier study. The distinct advantages of GP as compared to ANN and regression are highlighted. Several vital issues related to the <b>empirical</b> <b>modelling</b> of RP processes are also highlighted in the end. Originality/value: For the first time, a review of the application of <b>empirical</b> <b>modelling</b> techniques on RP processes is undertaken and a new GP method for modelling the FDM process is introduced. The performance of potential <b>empirical</b> <b>modelling</b> techniques for modelling RP processes is evaluated.

40|$|<b>Empirical</b> <b>modelling</b> {{is a new}} {{approach}} to the construction of physical (typically computer-based) artefacts [sic]. Model construction proceeds in an open-ended and exploratory manner in association with the identification of observables, dependency and agency. Knowledge of the referent is acquired through experiment, and - through the use of metaphor - interaction with the artefact is contrived so as to resemble interaction with the referent. Previous research has demonstrated the potential for <b>empirical</b> <b>modelling</b> in many areas. These include concurrent engineering, virtual reality and reactive systems development. This thesis examines the relationship between <b>empirical</b> <b>modelling</b> and geometric modelling on computer systems. <b>Empirical</b> <b>modelling</b> is suggested as complementary to variational and parametric modelling techniques commonly used in software packages for geometric modelling. Effective techniques for exploiting richer geometric models in visual metaphors within <b>empirical</b> <b>modelling</b> are also developed. Technical issues arising from geometric aspects of existing <b>empirical</b> <b>modelling</b> tools and case-studies are reviewed. The aim is improve the efficiency of existing implementations, and to introduce data representations that better support geometric modelling. To achieve this, a mathematical model (the DM Model) for representing the dependency between observables is introduced, and this is used as the basis for a new algorithm for propagating updates through observables. A novel computing machine (the DAM Machine) that maintains dependencies representing indivisible relationships between words in computer store is derived from the DM Model. Examples of the use of this machine for the representation of geometry are presented. In implementation, a comparative efficiency gain is achieved by the DAM Machine over existing tools. This allows for the real-time animation of models. A novel and general approach to the representation of data, suitable for integrating <b>empirical</b> <b>modelling</b> and general Java applications, with additional support for collaborative working, is developed. Object-oriented programming methods provide the foundation for new tools to support this representation. The empirical world class library allows a programmer to implement new applications for shape <b>modelling</b> that support <b>empirical</b> <b>modelling</b> and integrate a wide range of shape representations. A method of integrating these geometric techniques into spreadsheet-like environments that are well-adapted to support <b>empirical</b> <b>modelling</b> is proposed...|$|R
