5|$|When Bruce Lee died in 1973, he left an {{unreleased}} movie {{script that}} he had developed with James Coburn and Stirling Silliphant called The Silent Flute.

5|$|Etty {{considered}} {{the painting to}} be <b>his</b> <b>best</b> <b>work,</b> insisting that it form the centrepiece of his 1849 Royal Society of Arts solo exhibition. The Royal Manchester Institution was concerned that the painting would be damaged if moved, refusing {{to allow it to}} be used in the exhibition until Etty, and a number of influential friends, visited Manchester to beg them to release it. Etty died later that year, and his work enjoyed a brief boom in popularity. Interest in him declined over time, and by the end of the 19th century the cost of all his paintings had fallen below their original prices. As it was rarely exhibited, The Sirens and Ulysses had little influence on later artists, although it is credited as an influence on Frederic Leighton's 1858 The Fisherman and the Syren.|$|E

5|$|Malliswari is {{regarded}} as one of the cult classic films of Telugu cinema. It is one of the earliest Telugu films making use of Indian art and architecture and was followed by films such as Sankarabharanam (1980), Meghasandesam (1982), Ananda Bhairavi (1983), Sagara Sangamam (1983), and Rudraveena (1988). It was also the first film script to be serialised in Vijayachitra magazine. During the film's screening in the United States, a few universities requested the film's script as a part of their film study curriculum. Narasimha Reddy considered Malliswari <b>his</b> <b>best</b> <b>work</b> as a filmmaker, and the film was recognised as such. Malliswari success led to Rama Rao's resurgence from a career slump. A 2004 Telugu film directed by K. Vijaya Bhaskar was also titled Malliswari and marked the debut of the British-Indian film actress Katrina Kaif in Telugu cinema.|$|E
5|$|The first {{work that}} Ito {{composed}} after leaving Square was the soundtrack to Culdcept II, which he regards as <b>his</b> <b>best</b> <b>work.</b> He attributes this feeling {{both to the}} fact that it was his first freelance piece and that he handled all aspects of the music production, from composition through arrangement and sound production. From there he returned to working with Square and the Mana series with the remake of his second soundtrack, Final Fantasy Adventure, into the soundtrack of Sword of Mana. It was an act he would repeat two years later for Square, now Square Enix, with the remake of Romancing SaGa, Romancing SaGa: Minstrel Song. He has since returned to the Mana series twice, with the soundtracks to Children of Mana and Dawn of Mana. All of the video game soundtracks that he has composed since the third expansion pack for Cross Gate in 2004 have been with the assistance of other composers except for 2007's Hero Must Die, though during those years he has branched out from video games into composing and producing albums and singles for performers as well as composing music for plays and concerts. He has also released an album of piano pieces that he has composed; only two of the eight tracks are from his video game works.|$|E

25|$|He {{was one of}} {{the first}} European {{producers}} to fully exploit the possibilities of using multi-track recording facilities to create dramatic production effects and treatments that acted as musical and rhetorical elements in their own right, rather than mere gimmicks. He favoured sometimes harsh-sounding effects and contrasting audio spaces for each element in the mix. <b>His</b> <b>best</b> <b>work</b> stands in stark opposition to the smooth, 'evened-out' sound that predominated in most commercial pop and rock at that time.|$|E

25|$|Hubbard {{achieved}} {{his greatest}} popular {{success in the}} 1970s {{with a series of}} albums for Creed Taylor and his record label CTI Records, overshadowing Stanley Turrentine, Hubert Laws, and George Benson. Although his early 1970s jazz albums Red Clay, First Light, Straight Life, and Sky Dive were particularly well received and considered among <b>his</b> <b>best</b> <b>work,</b> the albums he recorded later in the decade were attacked by critics for their commercialism. First Light won a 1972 Grammy Award and included pianists Herbie Hancock and Richard Wyands, guitarists Eric Gale and George Benson, bassist Ron Carter, drummer Jack DeJohnette, and percussionist Airto Moreira. In 1994, Hubbard, collaborating with Chicago jazz vocalist/co-writer Catherine Whitney, had lyrics set to the music of First Light.|$|E
