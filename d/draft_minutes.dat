5000|$|By the 17th century, Portugal had {{established}} colonial rule over Macau after gaining concessions from various Chinese governments. In 1887, Portugal and the Qing dynasty signed the Sino-Portuguese <b>Draft</b> <b>Minutes</b> and the Sino-Portuguese Treaty of Peking, in which China ceded to Portugal {{the right to}} [...] "perpetual occupation and government of Macau"; conversely, Portugal pledged to seek China's approval before transferring Macau to another country. Colonial rule continued until 1974, when the Carnation revolution installed a democratic regime in Portugal that sought to end colonialism.

The full framework of transfer of sovereignty was decided in 1987 with the Sino-Portuguese Joint Declaration.|$|E

His early career was promising {{and he became}} Parliamentary Private Secretary (PPS) to Richard Crossman. He annoyed a number of ministers and was heavily censured by the Privileges Committee for a leak about the biological weapons research establishment, Porton Down, to the newspapers (though {{he said that he}} thought the <b>draft</b> <b>minutes</b> of the Select Committee on Science and Technology were in the public domain). When Labour lost power in 1970, his chances of senior office were effectively over. He was opposed to Scottish devolution and was the first to pose the [...] "West Lothian question", although it was given its name by Enoch Powell. He continued to argue his own causes: in 1978-79 he voted against his own government over 100 times, despite a three-line whip.|$|E
50|$|The Court is {{supported}} by a staff of approximately 800 auditors, translators and administrators recruited as part of the European Civil Service. Auditors are divided into auditor groups which inspect and prepare draft reports for the Court to take decisions upon. Inspections take place not only of EU institutions but of any state which receives EU funds, given that 90% of income and expenditure is managed by national authorities rather than the EU. Upon finding a fault, the Court—possessing no legal powers of its own—informs the European Anti-fraud Office (OLAF), which is the EU's anti-fraud agency. The Court is also assisted by the Secretary-General of the European Court of Auditors, elected by the Court, who—along with general management and assistance to the President—draws up <b>draft</b> <b>minutes</b> and keeps archives of decisions, as well as ensuring the publication of reports in the Official Journal of the European Union.|$|E

50|$|Assuming the {{organization}} supports the Scanlon Roadmap a Design Team is created. The Design Team {{is made up}} of both elected and appointed members. The Design Team takes the theory of Scanlon and creates a written Plan for how Scanlon will be practiced in {{the organization}}. Often today, the Design Team will break into four subcommittees based on the Frost/Scanlon Principles of Identity, Participation, Equity and Competence. While the plan is being <b>drafted</b> <b>minutes</b> are shared throughout the Organization so that everyone is aware of the progress of the Design Team. When the Design Team feels it has done its best work they vote on taking the plan to the Organization. Unless the Design Team is unanimous in their decision to proceed they continue working on the plan. The plan is then taken to the Board of Directors for final approval. The Design Team then takes the Plan to the entire Organization and asks for a vote to try the Plan for a trial period of a year or two. Most Organizations will require an 80-90% vote of approval. If the vote passes the plan is put into effect and the Design Team will monitor the plan and make adjustments during the trial period. At the end of the trial period the Plan is voted on one more time and made a permanent part of culture of the Organization. (Some organizations will renew the plan after a number of years by recreating a Design Team. Others will only vote or change the plan if there is a major change to the bonus formula or other aspects of the Plan).|$|R

The main objective of this project was to undertake the full monitoring of the construction of the above-described dwelling thus valuing the use of all the constructive solutions in order to obtain an energy performance certificate grade B.

The description of what happened will therefore be useful to any administrative office. To prepare the basis of this challenging project we scrutinized studies on organization issues and digital resources management. Alongside university textbooks, it was above all important to study working methods already applied elsewhere by reading guidelines, articles, policies and case studies. At that point, work was divided into several phases, which can be summarized in: on-going dialogue with staff members, careful and meticulous analysis of all kind of documents and their application software, the study, selection and retention of duplicate or not definitive documents (such as <b>minutes,</b> <b>drafts,</b> semi-finished studies), the comparison between paper and hybrid archives and their coexistence, and finally the reaching of a new and definitive management system and a related tree network...|$|R
