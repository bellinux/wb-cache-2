The 1, 242, 163 – 1, 574, 910 -bp fragmented genomes of B. recurrentis and B. duttonii contain a unique 23 -kb linear plasmid. This linear plasmid exhibits a large polyT track within the promoter region of an <b>intact</b> <b>variable</b> large protein <b>gene</b> and a telomere resolvase that is unique to Borrelia. The genome content is characterized by several repeat families, including antigenic lipoproteins. B. recurrentis exhibited a 20. 4 % genome size reduction {{and appeared to be}} a strain of B. duttonii, with a decaying genome, possibly due to the accumulation of genomic errors induced by the loss of recA and mutS. Accompanying this were increases in the number of impaired genes and a reduction in coding capacity, including surface-exposed lipoproteins and putative virulence factors. Analysis of the reconstructed ancestral sequence compared to B. duttonii and B. recurrentis was consistent with the accelerated evolution observed in B. recurrentis. Vector specialization of louse-borne pathogens responsible for major epidemics was associated with rapid genome reduction.

An analysis of the local DNA sequences revealed many direct repeats and palindromic sequences that were capable of templating some of the known mutations.

Of the weighted average of 1, 531 genes present in the two sequenced genomes, 25 % are absent in at least one strain of H. pylori and 21 % were absent or variable in H. acinonychis.

Results 63 variable lambda chain and 22 <b>variable</b> kappa chain <b>genes</b> were identified and phylogenetically assigned to 8 and 4 subgroups, respectively. The specified phylogenetic relationships are compatible with the established ruminant light chain <b>variable</b> <b>gene</b> families or subgroups. Because of gaps and uncertainties in the assembled genome sequence, the number of genes might change in the future versions of the genome sequence. In addition, three bovine surrogate light chain genes were identified. The corresponding cDNAs were cloned and the expression of the surrogate light chain genes was demonstrated from fetal material. Conclusion The bovine kappa gene locus is compact and simple which may reflect the preferential use of the lambda chain in cattle. The relative orientation of <b>variable</b> and joining <b>genes</b> in both loci are consistent with a deletion mechanism in VJ joining. The orientation of some <b>variable</b> <b>genes</b> cannot be determined from the data available. The number of functional <b>variable</b> <b>genes</b> is moderate when compared to man or mouse.

In order to identify <b>variable</b> <b>genes</b> present in isolates from alternative host species, five subtractions between C. jejuni isolates from different sources (rabbit, cattle, wild bird) were carried out, designed to assess genomic variability within and between common multilocus sequence type (MLST) clonal complexes (ST- 21, ST- 42, ST- 45 and ST- 61). Results The vast majority (97 %) of the 195 subtracted sequences identified had a best BLASTX match with a Campylobacter protein. However, there was considerable variation within and between the four clonal complexes included in the subtractions. The distributions of eight variable sequences, including four with putative roles in the use of alternative terminal electron acceptors, amongst a panel of C. jejuni isolates representing diverse sources and STs, were determined.

In contrast, there was no evidence to support the hypothesis that the distribution of such genes may be related to host preference.

40|$|It {{has been}} long {{accepted}} that {{many types of}} B cell cancer (lymphomas, myelomas, plasmacytomas, etc.) are derived from the antigen-stimulated B cell Germinal Center (GC) reaction [1], [2], [3] and [4], i. e. they are aberrant products of the somatic hypermutation mechanism normally targeting rearranged immunoglobulin (Ig) <b>variable</b> <b>genes</b> (so-called V[D]J regions). Here we provide evidence that the somatic mutation patterns of some well-characterised cancer genomes [5] such as lung carcinomas, breast carcinomas and squamous cell carcinomas, strongly resemble in toto or in part the spectrum of somatic point mutations observed in normal physiological somatic hypermutation (SHM) in antibody <b>variable</b> <b>genes</b> [6]. This implies that whilst SHM itself is a tightly regulated and beneficial mutational process for B lymphocytes of the immune system, aberrant mutations (or “crises”) or inadvertent activation of this complex activation-induced cytidine deaminase (AID) -dependent mechanism {{in a range of}} somatic tissue types could result, as often speculated [7], in cancer...|$|R

However, the proper insertion of PCR-amplified immunoglobulin genes into expression vectors remains an obstacle to the high-throughput production of recombinant monoclonal antibodies. Results: We developed a single-step cloning method, target-selective {{homologous recombination}} (TS-HR), in which PCR-amplified immunoglobulin <b>variable</b> <b>genes</b> were selectively inserted into vectors, even in the presence of nonspecifically amplified DNA. TS-HR utilizes Red/ET-mediated homologous recombination with a target-selective vector (TS-vector) with unique homology arms on its termini. Using TS-HR, immunoglobulin <b>variable</b> <b>genes</b> were cloned directly into expression vectors by co-transforming unpurified PCR products and the TS-vector into E. coli. Furthermore, the high cloning specificity of TS-HR allowed plasmids to be extracted from pools of transforme...|$|R

Although the single cell-based immunoglobulin <b>variable</b> <b>gene</b> cloning technique is a powerful tool, the current methods remain an obstacle to the rapid production of large numbers of recombinant antibodies. Results: We have developed a novel overlap extension polymerase chain reaction, the target-selective joint polymerase chain reaction (TS-jPCR), and applied it to the generation of linear immunoglobulin gene expression constructs. TS-jPCR is conducted using a PCR-amplified immunoglobulin <b>variable</b> <b>gene</b> and an immunoglobulin gene-selective cassette (Ig-cassette) that contains all essential elements for antibody expression and overlapping areas of immunoglobulin gene-specific homology. The TS-jPCR technique is simple and specific; the 3 ’-rando...|$|R
