500|$|According to Lee, {{the album}} was fun {{but not in a}} [...] "poppy way" [...] and the band enjoyed its recording. She was {{inspired}} by her relationship with Evanescence's fans: [...] "I can really hear myself singing about my relationship with Evanescence and with the fans. There's always one big relationship on a record that I sing about the most. I feel like my big relationship on this album [...] with Evanescence itself, and with the fans. I think lyrically you're <b>hearing</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> about a relationship, a struggle with a relationship or love in a relationship, and mostly I'm singing about that." ...|$|E
2500|$|In {{contrast}} to the first two, Season 3 of the series was met with mostly negative reception. After the eventual cancellation of the show, Schwartz admitted that [...] "the whole {{first half of the}} third season was a total mess." [...] IGN faulted a season which, in their opinion, had [...] "far too much time and too many episodes spent with the less than beloved character Johnny." [...] IGN also noted that [...] "Kirsten and Sandy both suffered from unsatisfying stories," [...] and that the departure of character Caleb Nichol had been a mistake [...] "as he had been a great character to bounce off both of the elder Cohens." [...] In September 2007, Schwartz admitted in an interview for New York that the show [...] "went down the wrong road" [...] with Johnny. The season did, however, receive some praise. The new character Taylor Townsend was stated as being [...] "played to perfection by Autumn Reeser" [...] and her character was described as [...] "one of the greatest elements of The O.C." [...] Jeffrey Robinson of DVD Talk described the storylines as [...] "very intelligent and also incorporate a great deal of humor to keep your interest." [...] While looking back on the series in an interview for the complete series box-set, Schwartz explained that [...] "somewhere around Season 3, for reasons too numerous to discuss, I lost focus. The network wasn't really supporting the show." [...] Schwartz {{went on to say that}} Season 3 was probably [...] "the most important season, because it's where I learned the most. About television, about myself as a writer, about discipline and trying to hold onto your focus even if you're <b>hearing</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> of opinions or being forced to add things creatively that you don't agree with. And I don't think Season 4 would have been as fun or as adventurous or as weird and zany and ultimately emotional if it weren't for that experience." ...|$|E

5000|$|Ben Ratliff, {{writing for}} the New York Times in 2009: [...] "You could say that Big Ears was for people who like hearing nuanced music in {{excellent}} theaters, {{in a city with}} no hassle: {{a place where you can}} walk down the main drag on Saturday night and see 10 feet of empty space between you and the next pair of feet. You could also say that Big Ears was for people with long attention spans, good concentration and an appetite for letting repetitive non-dance music wash over them. And at least in its first edition — Mr. Capps intends to repeat Big Ears in Knoxville, and also export the idea to other cities — Big Ears was for concertgoers who appreciate not <b>hearing</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> of introductions and context and sponsor announcements before the music even starts. In other words, at times it was heaven." ...|$|E

50|$|Chris Vallillo {{was born}} in Hammond, Indiana on August 3, 1954. His father was a civil {{engineer}} and the transitory nature of that profession meant that the Vallillo family moved around every couple of years. In addition to Hammond, Chris lived in Pittsburg, Pennsylvania - Flint, Michigan - Hamilton, Ohio - Newcastle, Pennsylvania - Buffalo, New York and Rochester, New York. His earliest musical memory is that of seeing singing cowboys on TV, which engendered a yearning in chris to own and play a guitar. Aged ten, his parents presented Chris with an old archtop Kay guitar. He went on take lessons for around 6 months. The family were living near Detroit at the time, and Chris recalls <b>hearing</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> of Motown music, plus it was {{the era of the}} Beatles U.S. invasion {{and the end of the}} Folk Music boom. Mississippi John Hurt, John Fahey, the Beatles and a whole range of singer songwriters all inspired Chris’s musical interest.|$|E
5000|$|In Variety, critic Rob Nelson wrote: [...] "The {{scars and}} {{blemishes}} {{on the faces}} of the high-school lovers in The Spectacular Now are beautifully emblematic of director James Ponsoldt's bid to bring the American teen movie back to some semblance of reality, a bid that pays off spectacularly indeed."
