5|$|Archaeological {{investigations}} {{have revealed that}} the diet of the inhabitants of Motul de San José included dogs (Canis familiaris), turtles including pond sliders (Trachemys scripta) and Mesoamerican river turtles (Dermatemys mawii), freshwater snails (mostly Pomacea flagellata but also jute snails (Pachychilus spp.)), white-tailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus), red brocket (Mazama americana, a species of small deer), white-lipped peccary (Tayassu pecari), rabbits (Sylvilagus spp.), lowland pacas (Cuniculus paca), Central American agouti (Dasyprocta punctata) and nine-banded armadillos (Dasypus novemcinctus). Only the dog had been domesticated by the Late Classic Maya so the majority of protein <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>diet</b> of the inhabitants came from hunting and fishing within the catchment area around the city.

40|$|ABSTRACT The {{clinical}} aspects of fructose supplementa-tion <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>diets</b> {{of individuals with}} diabetes {{should focus on the}} balance between beneficial effects and possible side effects.

40|$|OBJECTIVE. The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{determine}} whether a low-fiber diet is necessary for optimal tagging-only bowel preparation for CT colonography. SUBJECTS AND METHODS. Fifty consecutively enrolled patients received an iodine bowel preparation: 25 patients used a low-fiber diet and 25 used no special diet. One observer determined the tagging quality per segment on a 5 -point scale (1, inhomogeneous tagging; 5, excellent preparation) and the largest size of untagged feces. Semiautomatic measurements of density and homogeneity of residual feces were performed. Patient acceptance was assessed with questionnaires. Per polyp sensitivity for polyps 6 mm in diameter and larger was calculated for two experienced observers. RESULTS. Tagging quality was scored less than grade 5 in 15 segments (10 %) <b>in</b> <b>the</b> low-fiber <b>diet</b> group and in 25 segments (17 %) <b>in</b> <b>the</b> unrestricted <b>diet</b> group (p = 0. 098). One piece of untagged feces 10 mm in diameter or larger was found <b>in</b> <b>the</b> low-fiber <b>diet</b> group, and 12 were found <b>in</b> <b>the</b> unrestricted <b>diet</b> group (p < 0. 001). Automatic measurement of attenuation resulted in a mean value of 594 HU <b>in</b> <b>the</b> low-fiber <b>diet</b> group and 630 HU <b>in</b> <b>the</b> unrestricted <b>diet</b> group (p = 0. 297). <b>In</b> <b>the</b> low-fiber <b>diet</b> group, 22 % of patients indicated that the bowel preparation was extremely or severely burdensome; 8 % of patients <b>in</b> <b>the</b> unrestricted <b>diet</b> group had this response (p = 0. 19).
