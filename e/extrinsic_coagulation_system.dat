40|$|The {{efficacy}} of oral aspirin {{treatment in the}} secondary prevention of cardio and cerebro vascular disease is well known. However oral administration {{is often associated with}} abdominal discomfort. The feasibility of delivering aspirin transdermally from eudragit and polyvinyl acetate (PVA) matrix-type patches to enhance its antithrombotic efficiency of aspirin was investigated. Transdermal films containing mixture of eudragit RL: eudragit RS and polyvinyl acetate were fabricated. Eudragit RL: eudragit RS (5 : 1) films containing 30 mg / transdermal patch aspirin showed maximum release (11. 891. 1 g/cm 2) after 24 hrs as compared to PVA films. With regards to appearance eudragit films were also wrinkle free, uniform, flexible and transparent with good adhesion property to skin. The effect of turpentine oil and lemon oil at different concentrations on the in vitro percutaneous absorption of aspirin from eudragit copolymer patches through rat skin was investigated. Two formulation containing 50 mg/transdermal patch ASA with 0. 042 ml turpentine oil and 0. 042 ml lemon oil showed a significantly higher flux of ASA 4. 22 g/cm 2 /hr and 38. 52 g/cm 2 /hr respectively.

Tissue factor (TF), the major initiator of the <b>extrinsic</b> <b>coagulation</b> <b>system,</b> is induced on monocytes by aPL in vitro, explaining in part the pathophysiology in APS. We previously reported that the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway {{plays an important role in}} aPL-induced TF expression on monocytes. In this study, we identified plasma gelsolin as a protein associated with β 2 GPI by using immunoaffinity chromatography and mass spectrometric analysis. An in vivo binding assay showed that endogenous β 2 GPI interacts with plasma gelsolin, which binds to integrin α 5 β 1 through fibronectin. The tethering of β 2 GPI to monoclonal anti-β 2 GPI autoantibody on the cell surface was enhanced in the presence of plasma gelsolin. Immunoblot analysis demonstrated that p 38 MAPK protein was phosphorylated by monoclonal anti-β 2 GPI antibody treatment, and its phosphorylation was attenuated in the presence of anti-integrin α 5 β 1 antibody. Furthermore, focal adhesion kinase (FAK), a downstream molecule of the fibronectin-integrin signalling pathway, was phosphorylated by anti-β 2 GPI antibody treatment. These results indicate that molecules including gelsolin and integrin are involved in the anti-β 2 GPI antibody-induced MAPK pathway on monocytes and that integrin is a possible therapeutic target to modify a prothrombotic state in patients with APS...|$|E

Activation of the <b>extrinsic</b> <b>coagulation</b> <b>system</b> and the fibrinolytic cascade within a tumour {{is thought to}} be related with growth, invasion and metastasis. We have investigated the relationship between these markers of fibrin metabolism, standard clinicopathological variables and serum levels of angiogenic cytokines in three cohorts: group A (n= 30) consisted of 30 healthy female volunteers, group B (n= 23) of consecutive patients with operable breast cancer and group C (n= 84) of patients with untreated or progressive metastatic breast cancer. Plasma D-dimers, fibrinogen, IL- 6, vascular endothelial growth factor and calculated vascular endothelial growth factor load in platelets are clearly increased in patients with breast cancer. D-dimers were increased in nearly 89 % of patients with progressive metastatic disease. The level of D-dimers was positively correlated with tumour load (P< 0. 0001), number of metastatic sites (P= 0. 002), progression kinetics (P< 0. 0001) and the cytokines related to angiogenesis: serum vascular endothelial growth factor (P= 0. 0016, Spearman correlation= 0. 285), calculated vascular endothelial growth factor load in platelets (P< 0. 0001, Spearman correlation= 0. 37) and serum interleukin- 6 (P< 0. 0001, Spearman correlation= 0. 59). Similarly increased D-dimer levels were positively correlated with increased fibrinogen levels (P< 0. 0001, Spearman correlation= 0. 38). The association between markers of fibrin degradation in patients with progressive breast cancer suggests that the D-dimer level is a clinically important marker for progression and points towards a relation between haemostasis and tumour progression. A role of interleukin- 6, by influencing both angiogenesis and haemostasis, is suggested by these observations...|$|E
40|$|Factor X (FX) plays {{a pivotal}} role in blood coagulation. FX {{represents}} the point where all coagulation systems converge and, once activated, it converts prothrombin into thrombin. The discovery and definition of FX are based on the description between 1956 and 1957 about three patients and their families with a peculiar defect later demonstrated to be almost identical. These patients were an American (Mr. Stuart), a British (Ms. Prower), and a Swiss with Italian background (infant Delia B). We stated "almost identical" because immunological and molecular biology studies subsequently revealed that even though the basic clotting defect was identical, the FX protein level and the mutation were different in each case. Mr. Stuart had no FX protein in his plasma and the mutation was Val 298 Met (homozygote). Ms. Prower instead had a normal level of FX protein and the mutation was Arg 287 Trp[*]+[*]Asp 282 Asn (compound heterozygote). Unfortunately, the status of the Swiss patient in this regard is not known. Subsequent studies described a few major variants (FX Friuli, FX Melbourne, FX Padua, and other similar patients), which showed peculiar activation patterns (FX Friuli had a normal Russell viper venom clotting time; FX Melbourne was defective only in the intrinsic coagulation system; FX Padua, on the contrary, was defective only in the <b>extrinsic</b> <b>coagulation</b> <b>system).</b> All these studies have informed on the great heterogeneity and complexity of the FX defect. The story of the discovery and classification of FX deficiency has contributed considerably to our understanding of blood coagulation.

Because obesity has a role in the pathogenesis of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease, we measured TFPI antigen plasma levels (ng/mL) by ELISA at baseline and 5 minutes after an IV bolus of 20 IU/kg body weight of unfractionated commercial mucous heparin in 12 obese patients with a mean body mass index (BMI) of 41. 4 +/- 1. 4 kg/m 2 and 14 normal-weight control subjects (BMI 23. 1 +/- 1. 3 kg/m 2). All subjects were submitted to an OGTT. The obese patients displayed a normal glucose tolerance. However, they had a different glucose-induced hyperinsulinemia (14. 9 +/- 2. 0 versus 7. 8 +/- 0. 8 mU/L, p < 0. 01). Total serum cholesterol did not differ between controls and obese patients, whereas plasma triglycerides were higher in the latter group. Basal TFPI antigen plasma levels were similar in obese and controls (83. 8 +/- 5. 0 versus 77. 7 +/- 3. 5 ng/mL, p = N. S.). In contrast, after heparin a significantly lower rise in TFPI antigen plasma levels was observed in obese patients (511. 2 +/- 43. 4 ng/mL) (p < 0. 003). Moreover, a significant inverse correlation was found between the heparin-stimulated TFPI antigen plasma levels and both BMI and basal plasma insulin concentrations. Thus, the link between insulin level and endothelial cell-associated TFPI could at least partially explain why obese patients are more prone to develop cardiovascular disorders...|$|E

The potential pathophysiological roles of tissue factor (TF) (the initiator of the <b>extrinsic</b> <b>coagulation</b> pathway) and thrombomodulin (TM) (an initiator of the anticoagulatory protein C pathway) are unknown. We therefore measured plasma concentrations of TF and TM in 111 patients with liver diseases who were evaluated for liver transplantation. We could demonstrate that the levels of both molecules increased with the Child's class of liver cirrhosis, independently of aetiology. TM was significantly elevated in Child A, B and C patients compared with patients without cirrhosis; TF only in Child C patients. The plasma TM and TF concentrations correlated with prothrombin time, activated partial thromboplastin time, and inversely with factor VII activity, cholinesterase serum activity, and serum albumin concentration.

40|$|For the {{development}} and improvement of endovascular interventional therapy-methods the use of test-animals unavoidable. Criterions for {{the selection of a}} particular animal kind are quite often the vessel-size and thereof resulting the applicatibility of different implants (Catheters, Coils, Stents), law-reasons, society-ethical reasons, subject- and experiment-specific use of a particular animal model as well as costs. Less known and less attention is paid to coagulation-physiologic and -pathologic aspects, especially in comparison to man. The most frequently used laboratory animals for endovascular studies are pigs, dogs and rabbits; less used are sheep and very seldom used are primates. An extensive literature-research shows that every particular species is used in a broad experimental spectrum but there is only little information on coagulation-parameters of those species. Besides a number of publifications about coagulation- and fibrinolysis systems are contradictous in terms which makes the extrapolation of those results to man more difficult or even impossible. More information about this topic is spread through pharmacologic and pharmacodynamic publications than experimental interventional studies. In most cases of interventional literature pig and dog are claimed to be the most suitable test animals without any experimental validation. In our study we faced that problem and tried with own systematic experiments and extensive literature-research to recommend an animal model which is most suitable concerning the <b>coagulation</b> and fibrinolysis <b>system.</b> We tested the <b>coagulation</b> <b>systems</b> of those species who are mostly used in interventional studies: pig, dog, rabbit and sheep. The blood of ten animals of each species was examined and all the relevant coagulation parameters were measured. The results were compared to the human standard values and the ones in between species. Because a direct quantitative comparison of the parameters was often impossible due to the complexity of the <b>systems</b> (intrinsic and <b>extrinsic</b> <b>coagulation,</b> influence of fibrinolysis, etc) or would have distorted the results, we tried to create a qualitative ratio by analyzing the parameters of the particular subsystems, assembling them and creating a ranking order. Human parameters counted as baseline and the results of different species were graded as increased or decreased in comparison. We wanted to rate the antagonistic coagulation and fibrinolysis activity as whole. A limitation occurred in the rating of plasminogen activity. Our tests showed (confirmed through other publications) that Plasminogen of all analyzed species was insufficiently activated by Streptokinasis. Another limitation appeared in the results of aPTT. An activation of the intrinsic coagulation with Ellag-acid resulted in massive prolongation of rabbit-aPTT and a moderate prolongation of dog- and pig-aPTT compared to an activation with Kaolin as described in other publications. Also one has to recognize a species specifity of Thromboplastine especially when transferring the results of sheep and dog to the human <b>coagulation</b> <b>system.</b> In consideration of all systems sheep are closest to human coagulation and fibrinolysis. According to our results the sheep is well suitable with ist <b>coagulation</b> <b>system.</b> The rabbit takes second place in ranking. Coagulation and fibrinolysis are more active compared to human which is yet compensated by a more active contra-coagulation (AT III, Protein C) and increased fibrinolysis. Third place in ranking is held by the dog whose <b>coagulation</b> <b>system</b> is distinguished with a remarkably active <b>extrinsic</b> <b>coagulation.</b> The pig appears to be last in ranking. Its <b>coagulation</b> <b>system</b> is very increased compared to human and cannot be quite compensated by its fibrinolysis activity. Compared to the other species the contra-regulation of coagulation is decreased. Besides primates sheep and rabbit seem to be well suitable for endovascular experimental operations and {{the development}} of therapy methods. A little less suitable is the dog, least suitable is the pig. A suitable animal model without limitation for different experiments does not exist. Rather in consideration of literature one has to make a careful selection. It is important that existing differences between animal species and human are demonstrated and, if necessary, limitations of a particular test animal are recognized. Correcting factors can simplify the extrapolation. Because of lacking standardization of many experimental arrangements in numerous cases a comparison of publications is quite difficult. It is necessary that more standardized tests concerning coagulation and fibrinolysis of frequently in interventional studies used animal kinds are carried out for improvement of extrapolation of those studies to man...|$|R

During severe sepsis and septic shock microthrombi and multiorgan dysfunction are observed as a result of bacterial interference with the host defense and <b>coagulation</b> <b>systems.</b> OBJECTIVES: In the present study, staphylococcal superantigens were tested for their ability to induce procoagulant activity and tissue factor (TF) expression in human whole blood and in peripheral blood mononuclear cells. METHODS AND RESULTS: Determination of clotting time showed that enterotoxin A, B and toxic shock syndrome toxin 1 from S. aureus induce procoagulant activity in whole blood and in mononuclear cells. The procoagulant activity was dependent on the expression of TF in monocytes since antibodies to TF inhibited the effect of the toxins and TF was detected on the surface of monocytes by flow cytometry. In the supernatants from staphylococcal toxin-stimulated mononuclear cells, interleukin (IL) - 1 beta was detected by ELISA. Furthermore, the increased procoagulant activity and TF expression in monocytes induced by the staphylococcal toxins were inhibited in the presence of IL- 1 receptor antagonist, a natural inhibitor of IL- 1 beta.

40|$|Background: Aging is {{associated}} with an increased hypercoagulable state. Degenerative diseases of the large joints are also accompanied by increased coagulation activity. We investigated the effect of age on the hemostatic function in patients with osteoarthritis. Material and Methods: The study included 192 patients with osteoarthritis admitted to the clinic for primary hip or knee arthroplasty. The patients were categorized into 5 age groups: the age group under 40 years, the 41 –to- 50 -year age group, the 51 –to- 60 -year age group, the 61 -to- 70 - year age group, and the age group over 70 years. The general blood clotting tests, platelet number, fibrinogen, antithrombin, protein C, TAT, D-dimer, vonWillebrand factor (vWF), PAI- 1, ß-thromboglobulin were determined. Results: Among patients with osteoarthritis, the antithrombin III level significantly decreased by the age of 50; however, above the age of 60 there was a distinct decrease in platelet count, and over the age of 70 the activity of the <b>extrinsic</b> <b>coagulation</b> pathway and the plasminogen level dropped significantly. TAT and D-dimer levels were elevated in most of the patients. Conclusion: The decrease in platelet count coupled with the activity of the <b>extrinsic</b> <b>coagulation</b> pathway in elderly osteoarthritic patients may increase blood loss during total arthroplasty; also, the drop in the anticoagulant and fibrinolytic potential may play a negative role in strengthening the prothrombotic state during the postoperative period...|$|R
