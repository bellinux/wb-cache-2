The loudspeakers have built-in amplifiers and feature a <b>feedback</b> <b>sensor</b> on the woofer. The sensor measures the output signal of the woofer and compares it to the amplifier input signal. This results in a very low distortion and furthermore a more extended low frequency response in a relatively small enclosure. Any distortion induced by the enclosure or the woofer itself is immediately corrected by the feedback loop. To a degree, the sensor-feedback system also compensates for non-optimal room acoustics.|$|E
40|$|Recently, {{there has}} been {{significant}} interest in conducting polymer actuators including their applications in micro devices and micro manipulation. A feedback control system is usually used to enhance the positioning ability of these actuators in order to widen their application areas. To this end, a <b>feedback</b> <b>sensor</b> is employed to acquire the position feedback information for implementing the control system. However, a <b>feedback</b> <b>sensor</b> is extremely large in size compared {{to the size of}} the conducting polymer actuators. With this in mind, this paper proposes a sensorless control scheme without the use of a position <b>feedback</b> <b>sensor,</b> which we call the simulated feedback control approach. It has a feedback loop based on the actuator model, not requiring a physical sensor. With an accurately identified system model, this control strategy has shown an excellent control performance when following a displacement input experimentally.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} an adaptive algorithm to reduce residual vibrations when the <b>feedback</b> <b>sensor</b> used has null drift along the time. The adaptive approaches are useful {{to deal with}} large variations of the system parameters at each maneuver, such as it occurs in cranes. For the <b>feedback</b> <b>sensor,</b> the use of inertial measurement units such as Micro-Electro-Mechanical Systems (MEMS) is increasingly extended because of their cost, size, robustness and power consumption. However, {{the effectiveness of the}} adaptive input shaping algorithms is compromised because of this drift, which is a commonly raised issue in this kind of devices. The study presented in this manuscript focuses on the development of an automatic compensation of this drift to obviate frequent calibrations. It is based on a non-asymptotic algebraic identification technique, which does not require initial conditions and has a short convergence time. This study uses the Zero-Vibration (ZV) input shaper technique, and the null drift is added to the algorithm as a parameter to be identified. The proposed method is particularized for single maneuvers of cranes with a gyroscope as <b>feedback</b> <b>sensor,</b> in a real time scenario.

40|$|Current biofuel {{production}} methods use engineered bacteria {{to break down}} cellulose and convert it to biofuel. A major challenge in microbial fuel production is that increasing biofuel yields can be limited by the toxicity of the biofuel to the organism that is producing it. Previous {{research has demonstrated that}} efflux pumps are effective at increasing tolerance to various biofuels. However, when overexpressed, efflux pumps burden cells, which hinders growth and slows {{biofuel production}}. Therefore, the toxicity of the biofuel must be balanced with the toxicity of pump overexpression. We have developed a mathematical model for cell growth and biofuel production that implements a synthetic feedback loop using a biosensor to control efflux pump expression. In this way, the production rate will be maximal when the concentration of biofuel is low because the cell does not expend energy expressing efflux pumps when they are not needed. Additionally, the microbe is able to adapt to toxic conditions by triggering the expression of efflux pumps, which allow it to continue biofuel production. Sensitivity analysis indicates that the <b>feedback</b> <b>sensor</b> model is insensitive to most system parameters, but a few key parameters can influence growth and production. In comparison to systems that express efflux pumps at a constant level, the <b>feedback</b> <b>sensor</b> increases overall biofuel production by delaying pump expression until it is needed. This result is more pronounced when model parameters are variable because the system can use feedback to adjust to the actual rate of biofuel production...|$|E

40|$|This work {{develops}} a frequency domain loop shaping design strategy based on linear quadratic gaussian controllers with loop transfer recovery (LQG/LTR). The design strategy presented is an integrated design synthesis procedure which {{is conducive to}} educated trade-off management. The controller design specification are {{expressed in terms of}} loop shaping bounds for load dynamic and model uncertainties, command response times and disturbance response times. The design philosophy is to first and foremost satisfy the stability constraints subject to the model variation specification and then to satisfy the time domain design specifications. The LQG/LTR controller is synthesised in discrete time, the resulting design is a Robust-Optimal design. Asymptotic disturbance rejection is achieved by using a disturbance estimate feedforward technique. Within the servo control industry two position <b>feedback</b> <b>sensors</b> are commonly used, namely the resolver and the optical encoder. In this work the controllers designed are applicable to both types of <b>feedback</b> <b>sensors.</b> Particular attention is given to the resolver sensor and corresponding estimator design.
