5|$|The {{orbits of}} the Halley-type comets {{suggest that they}} were {{originally}} long-period comets whose orbits were perturbed by {{the gravity of the}} giant planets and directed into the inner Solar System. If Halley was once a long-period comet, it is likely to have originated in the Oort Cloud, a sphere of cometary bodies that has an inner edge of 20,000–50,000 AU. Conversely the Jupiter-family comets are generally believed to originate in the Kuiper belt, a <b>flat</b> <b>disc</b> of icy debris between 30 AU (Neptune's orbit) and 50 AU from the Sun (in the scattered disc). Another point of origin for the Halley-type comets was proposed in 2008, when a trans-Neptunian object with a retrograde orbit similar to Halley's was discovered, , whose orbit takes it from just outside that of Uranus to twice the distance of Pluto. It may be a member of a new population of small Solar System bodies that serves as the source of Halley-type comets.|$|E
25|$|In 1755, Immanuel Kant {{speculated that}} {{observed}} nebulae {{may in fact}} be regions of star and planet formation. In 1796, Laplace elaborated by arguing that the nebula collapsed into a star, and, as it did so, the remaining material gradually spun outward into a <b>flat</b> <b>disc,</b> which then formed the planets.|$|E

25|$|The TEC Awards nominating panel {{may choose}} to honor a number of {{pioneering}} or innovative audio products with induction into the TECnology Hall of Fame. A product must be ten years old to receive the honor. At the establishment of this award category at the AES Convention in San Francisco in October 2004, the initial 25 inductees included the venerable Edison cylinder (1877), Emile Berliner's <b>flat</b> <b>disc</b> recorder (1887), and Alan Dower Blumlein Stereo Patent (1931).|$|E
25|$|In {{order to}} keep the {{geometry}} of the tube-sample-detector assembly constant, the sample is normally prepared as a <b>flat</b> <b>disc,</b> typically of diameter 20–50mm. This is located at a standardized, small distance from the tube window. Because the X-ray intensity follows an inverse-square law, the tolerances for this placement and for the flatness of the surface must be very tight in order to maintain a repeatable X-ray flux. Ways of obtaining sample discs vary: metals may be machined to shape, minerals may be finely ground and pressed into a tablet, and glasses may be cast to the required shape. A further reason for obtaining a flat and representative sample surface is that the secondary X-rays from lighter elements often only emit from the top few micrometres of the sample. In order to further reduce the effect of surface irregularities, the sample is usually spun at 5–20 rpm. It is necessary to ensure that the sample is sufficiently thick to absorb the entire primary beam. For higher-Z materials, a few millimetres thickness is adequate, but for a light-element matrix such as coal, a thickness of 30–40mm is needed.|$|E
500|$|The Solar System formed 4.6 {{billion years}} ago from the {{gravitational}} collapse of a giant interstellar molecular cloud. The {{vast majority of the}} system's mass is in the Sun, with the majority [...] of the remaining mass contained in Jupiter. The four smaller inner planets, Mercury, Venus, Earth and Mars, are terrestrial planets, being primarily composed of rock and metal. The four outer planets are giant planets, being substantially more massive than the terrestrials. The two largest, Jupiter and Saturn, are gas giants, being composed mainly of hydrogen and helium; the two outermost planets, Uranus and Neptune, are ice giants, being composed mostly of substances with relatively high melting points compared with hydrogen and helium, called volatiles, such as water, ammonia and methane. All eight planets have almost circular orbits that lie within a nearly <b>flat</b> <b>disc</b> called the ecliptic.|$|E

Above the cup, there is a <b>flat</b> <b>disc.</b> This grebe nests both in colonies and by itself. When it does not nest by itself, it will often nest in mixed-species colonies that are made up of birds such as black-headed gulls, ducks, and various other waterbirds.

When the bird is not in a colony, the nest has an average diameter of , although this can vary, with nests ranging from about [...] to over [...] This is compared to nests in colonies, which have an average diameter of about [...] It is suggested that rarely some pairs of this grebe will steward over multiple nests when in colonies.|$|E
500|$|Ultra-light carbon {{nanotubes}} meshed through molecular manufacturing {{techniques have}} densities between 1.3 g/m2 to 1.4 g/m2. By {{the time a}} civilization is ready to use this technology, the carbon nanotube's manufacturing might be optimised {{enough for them to}} have a density lower than the necessary 0.7 g/m2, and the average sail density with rigging might be kept to 0.3 g/m2 (a [...] "spin stabilized" [...] light sail requires minimal additional mass in rigging). If such a sail could be constructed at this areal density, a space habitat the size of the L5 Society's proposed O'Neill cylinder—500km2, with room for over 1 million inhabitants, massing 3 tons—could be supported by a circular light sail 3,000km in diameter, with a combined sail/habitat mass of 5.4 kg. For comparison, this is just slightly smaller than the diameter of Jupiter's moon Europa (although the sail is a <b>flat</b> <b>disc,</b> not a sphere), or the distance between San Francisco and Kansas City. Such a structure would, however, have a mass quite a lot less than many asteroids. Although the construction of such a massive inhabitable statite would be a gigantic undertaking, and the required material science behind it is early stage, there are other engineering feats and required materials proposed in other Dyson sphere variants.|$|E

60|$|The {{observations}} on which these several statements are founded {{must now be}} given in some detail. Castings when first ejected are viscid and soft; during rain, at which time worms apparently prefer to eject them, they are still softer; so that I have sometimes thought that worms must swallow much water at such times. However this may be, rain, even when not very heavy, if long continued, renders recently-ejected castings semi-fluid; and on level ground they then spread out into thin, circular, <b>flat</b> <b>discs,</b> exactly as would so much honey or very soft mortar, with all traces of their vermiform structure lost. This latter fact was sometimes made evident, when a worm had subsequently bored through a <b>flat</b> circular <b>disc</b> of this kind, and heaped up a fresh vermiform mass in the centre. These <b>flat</b> subsided <b>discs</b> have been repeatedly seen by me after heavy rain, in many places on land of all kinds.|$|R

40|$|Poloxamers are {{amphiphilic}} copolymers {{capable of}} interacting with biological membranes, while the fundamental {{mechanism of the}} interactions is not yet fully understood. Using liposomes as model membranes, we have investigated the interactions of the poloxamer with phospholipids bilayers by isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC) and electron cryomicroscopy (cryo-EM). The {{results suggest that the}} phase structure of the lipid bilayer plays a critical role in regulating poloxamer insertion into lipid bilayers. ITC shows that the poloxamer is incorporated into the liposome at temperatures (T) above the bilayer main phase transition temperature (T m) but the incorporation is completely inhibited otherwise. This distinct effect from the phase structure of the lipid bilayer determines the concentration of poloxamer incorporated into the membrane and affects the morphology of the self-assembled structure of lipid-poloxamer mixtures. When poloxamers are introduced at concentrations above the critical micelle concentration to pre-formed liposomes, liposomes are disrupted into <b>flat</b> <b>discs</b> at temperatures above Tm but remain as spherical shells at temperatures below Tm, as evidenced by cryo-EM. With relatively low concentrations of poloxamers introduced during liposome formation, spherical poloxamer-lipid vesicles are formed at T> T m; The spherical-shell structure of binary poloxamer-lipid liposomes changes to <b>flat</b> <b>discs</b> over a short time scale when the temperature is dropped below Tm. These <b>flat</b> <b>discs</b> are capable of reverting to the spherical vesicular structure when the temperature is raised above Tm, though a much longer time is needed. Understanding the effects of the bilayer phase in lipid-poloxamer interactions can help improve the design of poloxamers for pharmaceutical use...|$|R

2500|$|Sample {{macroscopic}} effects {{consist of}} effects of inhomogeneities of the sample, and unrepresentative conditions at its surface. Samples are ideally homogeneous and isotropic, {{but they often}} deviate from this ideal. Mixtures of multiple crystalline components in mineral powders can result in absorption effects that deviate from those calculable from theory. When a powder is pressed into a tablet, the finer minerals concentrate at the surface. Spherical grains tend to migrate to the surface more than do angular grains. In machined metals, the softer components of an alloy tend to smear across the surface. Considerable care and ingenuity are required to minimize these effects. Because they are artifacts of the method of sample preparation, these effects can not be compensated by theoretical corrections, and must be [...] "calibrated in". This means that the calibration materials and the unknowns must be compositionally and mechanically similar, and a given calibration is applicable only to a limited range of materials. Glasses most closely approach the ideal of homogeneity and isotropy, and for accurate work, minerals are usually prepared by dissolving them in a borate glass, and casting them into a <b>flat</b> <b>disc</b> or [...] "bead". Prepared in this form, a virtually universal calibration is applicable.|$|E
