500|$|This led to Boycott {{being dropped}} from the side and forced to return to England, despite apologising via a note to the England {{dressing}} room. He claimed in his autobiography, however, {{that he went to}} the golf course following medical advice to get fresh air. Later in 1982 he was instrumental in organising, in defiance of a United Nations and a TCCB ban, a so-called [...] "rebel" [...] tour of apartheid South Africa by 13 current and former England Test cricketers, who were almost all nearing the end of their careers. All the players were banned from international cricket for three years as a result. By the mid-1980s, with Boycott in good county form and physical shape, there was speculation that he might return to the England side. David Gower, England captain of the time, stated, however, that [...] "Geoffrey's been a marvellous servant for England but we <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>look</b> <b>to</b> the future and, in view of his age, it wouldn't make an awful lot of sense to pick him again." [...] This was confirmed by the return of Graham Gooch and Tim Robinson's 175 against Australia at Leeds, which prompted Botham, who had once remarked that Boycott was [...] "totally, almost insanely, selfish", to sing [...] "Bye-bye Boycott" [...] from the England balcony.|$|E

2500|$|On 17 February 2005, the Mid-Bedfordshire Conservative Association held {{a meeting}} at the Rufus Centre in Flitwick to {{consider}} Jonathan Sayeed's future. The meeting decided by a majority of 173 to 126, that Sayeed should remain the Conservative candidate in the forthcoming General Election. After the vote, Constituency association president Sir Stanley Odell resigned in protest. One constituency party member, Geoffrey Beckwith, said: [...] "I think the membership was strongly against the motion. Mr Sayeed has behaved impeccably. This is just a storm in a teacup.

2500|$|After German {{needs for}} {{military}} supplies after the Munich Agreement and Soviet demand for military machinery increased, {{talks between the}} two countries occurred from late 1938 to March 1939. [...] The Soviet Third Five Year Plan would require massive new infusions of technology and industrial equipment. An autarkic economic approach or an alliance with England were impossible for Germany, such that closer relations with the Soviet Union were necessary, if not just for economic reasons alone. At that time, Germany could supply only 25 percent of its petroleum needs, and without its primary United States petroleum source in a war, would <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>look</b> <b>to</b> Russia and Romania. Germany suffered the same natural shortfall and supply problems for rubber and metal ores needed for hardened steel in war equipment , for which Germany relied on Soviet supplies or transit using Soviet rail lines. Finally, Germany also imported 40 per cent of its fat and oil food requirements, which would grow if Germany conquered nations that were also net food importers, and, thus, needed Soviet imports of Ukrainian grains or Soviet transshipments of Manchurian soybeans. Moreover, an anticipated British blockade in the event of war and a cutoff of petroleum from the United States would create massive shortages for Germany regarding a number of key raw materials ...|$|E
