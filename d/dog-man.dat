60|$|The Hyena-swine avoided me, and I {{was always}} on the alert for him. My inseparable <b>Dog-man</b> hated and dreaded him intensely. I really believe that was {{at the root of the}} brute's {{attachment}} to me. It was soon evident to me that the former monster had tasted blood, and gone the way of the Leopard-man. He formed a lair somewhere in the forest, and became solitary. Once I tried to induce the Beast Folk to hunt him, but I lacked the authority to make them co-operate for one end. Again and again I tried to approach his den and come upon him unaware; but always he was too acute for me, and saw or winded me and got away. He too made every forest pathway dangerous to me and my ally with his lurking ambuscades. The <b>Dog-man</b> scarcely dared to leave my side.|$|E

5000|$|The term existed by {{at least}} 1901, when it was applied to stories from China about humans turning into dogs, dogs {{becoming}} people, and sexual relations between humans and canines.

50|$|Ironically, {{this led}} {{to one of the}} most fabled events {{associated}} with the film. During the latter stages of filming Stanley had a chance meeting with some of the film's former production staff, who had been rehired as extras and were camping in the area. It was rumoured at the time, and confirmed as true by these same production staff in the 'Lost Souls' documentary that with their help Stanley secretly came back to the set over several days - disguised in full costume as one of the <b>dog-men,</b> he performed as an extra on the film he had originally been hired to direct. It has also been reported that he showed up at the film's wrap party, where he ran into Kilmer, who was said to have apologized profusely for Stanley's removal from the film.|$|R
60|$|For {{a moment}} {{the opening of the}} hut was {{blackened}} by the exit of the <b>Dog-man.</b> Then I followed and stood up, almost in the exact spot where I had been when I had heard Moreau and his staghound pursuing me. But now it was night, and all the miasmatic ravine about me was black; and beyond, instead of a green, sunlit slope, I saw a red fire, before which hunched, grotesque figures moved to and fro. Farther were the thick trees, a bank of darkness, fringed above with the black lace of the upper branches. The moon was just riding up {{on the edge of the}} ravine, and like a bar across its face drove the spire of vapour that was for ever streaming from the fumaroles of the island.|$|E

5000|$|<b>Dog-Man</b> - A Beast Man {{created from}} a St. Bernard who, {{near the end}} of the book, becomes Prendick's {{faithful}} companion.

50|$|The book {{opens with}} protagonist Luka {{and his father}} Rashid walking home from Luka's school in the fictional city of Kahani {{in the land of}} Alifbay. They pass the Great Rings of Fire circus, where, upon seeing the pitiful state of the animals, Luka yells: “May your animals stop obeying your {{commands}} and your rings of fire eat up your stupid tent.” (Rushdie 6) Later that day, the animals revolt and the rings of fire consume the tents; and Dog and Bear (a bear and a dog respectively), two animals from the circus, become Luka's faithful pets. (Rushdie 4) One month afterwards, Rashid enters a coma, attributed to a curse placed by antagonist 'Captain Aag'. Thereafter, Luka travels through the 'World of Magic' imagined by his father, guided by a phantom-like creature nicknamed 'Nobodaddy', representing Rashid's imminent death. Bear is identified as Barak of the it-Barak (a set of immortal <b>dog-men),</b> turned into a dog by a Chinese curse; and Dog as the monarch of a northern land, transformed by an ogre. All four seek the eponymous 'Fire of Life' to revive Rashid. At the River of Time, which they must follow to find the Fire, they are attacked by the Old Man of the River, who kills Luka. Once revived, Luka realises that this world will revive him continually until he achieves his purpose, or exceeds his chances of doing so. Luka eventually bests the Old Man in a game of riddles. The protagonists then find a boat but are soon capsized and thereafter carried upriver by the Elephant Ducks: “a pair of absurd creatures with duck-like bodies and large elephant heads” (Rushdie 66).|$|R

Leonard angrily beats the machine and it fires at the blue dust and turns Scott back into his original dog form. Leonard and Spot reunite, and Spot decides that he is [...] "Proud to Be a Dog".|$|E
50|$|Ur(i)dimmu, {{the reading}} is uncertain, meaning “Mad/howling Dog” or Langdon’s “Gruesome Hound”, Sumerian UR.IDIM and giš.pirig.gal = ur-gu-lu-ú = ur-idim-mu in the lexical series ḪAR.gud = imrû = ballu, was an ancient Mesopotamian mythical {{creature}} {{in the form}} of a human headed <b>dog-man</b> or lion-man who first appearance might be during the Kassite period, if the Agum-Kakrime Inscription proves to be a copy of a genuine period piece. He is pictured standing upright, wearing a horned tiara and holding a staff with an uskaru, or lunar crescent, at the tip. The lexical series ḪAR-ra=ḫubullu describes him as a kalbu šegû, “rabid dog,” but due to the propensity for Sumerian culture to group canines and felines together (ur.maḫ, big dog = lion) and Akkadian to separate them (nēšu, labbu = lion), the issue remains unresolved although the prominent genitalia on the few extant representations argues for a canine interpretation.|$|E

They cease to follow Prendick's instructions and eventually the Hyena-Swine kills his faithful companion, a <b>Dog-Man</b> created from a St. Bernard. Prendick then shoots the Hyena-Swine in self-defence {{with the help of}} the Sloth Creature. Luckily for Prendick ever since his efforts to build a raft have been unsuccessful, a boat that carries two corpses drifts onto the beach (perhaps the captain of the ship that picked Prendick up and a sailor). Prendick uses the boat to leave the island and is picked up three days later. But when he tells his story he is thought to be mad, so he feigns amnesia.|$|E
