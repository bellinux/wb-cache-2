I feel that it will be. But it will emerge from my dialogue with the American people. I've traveled to every part of this country during the last six years. During my service in the United States Congress, <b>I</b> <b>took</b> <b>the</b> initiative in creating the Internet. <b>I</b> <b>took</b> <b>the</b> initiative in moving forward a whole range of initiatives that have proven to be important to our country's economic growth and environmental protection, improvements in our educational system.|$|E
5|$|Two events {{affected}} me most, one when a colleague dropped himself from second floor to escape under-covered police who stormed school. The second incident was when a dear teacher was arrested. That is when my voice started {{to rise and}} become annoying. I was caught vandalizing a school wall by writing apolitical human rights statements on school walls and was given the choice to either be submitted to police or to switch school. So <b>I</b> <b>took</b> <b>the</b> easy way out and since I was the top student back then, I choose to switch to Sheikh Abdul Aziz school.|$|E

25|$|Meanwhile, another Rum Seljuq, Malik Shah (not to be {{confused}} with the Seljuq sultan of the same name), captured Konya. In 1116 Kilij Arslan's son, Mesud <b>I,</b> <b>took</b> <b>the</b> city with the help of the Danishmends.|$|E
25|$|After {{about a year}} {{some trouble}} arose {{between them and the}} Indians, and <b>I</b> <b>took</b> <b>the</b> war path as a warrior, not as a chief.

25|$|By marriage, the {{fortress}} passed in 1447 to the Austrian Habsburgs {{along with all}} Burgundian possessions. In 1542, the French troops of Francis <b>I</b> <b>took</b> <b>the</b> fortress, which was soon retaken by troops of the Holy Roman Empire. Around 1545, Italian and Dutch engineers under Holy Roman Emperor Charles V built the first bastions, linked by curtain walls, {{on the site of}} the current Boulevard Roosevelt and Boulevard Royal. The ditch was enlarged from 13 to 31 metres. Ravelins were also added.|$|E
25|$|The {{substance}} of what <b>I</b> <b>took</b> <b>the</b> liberty to mention {{to you this}} morning was: You are on {{the borders of the}} grave, as well as I; shortly we must both appear before God. When it seemed to me, some months since, that my life was near an end, I was troubled that I had not dealt plainly with you. This you will permit me to do now, without any reserve, in the fear and in the presence of God.|$|E
25|$|The Bourbon dynasty seemed {{finished}} in Spain {{as in the}} rest of the world, but it would be resurrected. The Second Spanish Republic was overthrown in the Spanish Civil War, leading to the dictatorship of Francisco Franco. He named Juan Carlos de Borbón, a grandson of Alfonso XIII, his successor in 1969. When Franco died six years later, Juan Carlos <b>I</b> <b>took</b> <b>the</b> throne to restore the Bourbon dynasty. The new king oversaw the Spanish transition to democracy; the Spanish Constitution of 1978 recognized the monarchy.|$|E

25|$|Beginning {{with this}} period, {{the upper class}} and the elites in the Ottoman Empire started to use the open and public areas frequently. The traditional, {{introverted}} manner of the society began to change. Fountains and waterside residences such as the Aynalıkavak Kasrı became popular. A water canal (other name is Cetvel-i Sim) and a picnic area (Kağıthane) were established as recreational areas. Although the Tulip period ended with the Patrona Halil uprising, it became a model for attitudes of Westernization. During the years 17201890, Ottoman architecture deviated from the principles of classical times. With Ahmed III's deposition, Mahmud <b>I</b> <b>took</b> <b>the</b> throne (17301754). It was during this period that Baroque-style mosques were starting to be constructed.|$|E
25|$|Naram-Sin or Narām–Suen, {{inscribed in}} {{cuneiform}} on contemporary seal impressions as dna-ra-am-dEN.ZU, was the ensí or waklum of Aššur (da-šùr), {{listed as the}} thirty-seventh king of Assyria on the later Assyrian King Lists, where he is inscribed mna-ram-dEN.ZU, or a fragmentary list where he appears as -d30. (c. 1814 BC – c. 1760 BC), son and successor of Puzur-Ashur II, was named for the illustrious Naram-Sin of Akkad and, like his grandfather, Sargon <b>I,</b> <b>took</b> <b>the</b> divine determinative in his name. He {{should not be confused}} with the Naram-Sin who ruled Eshnunna for around twelve years, the successor and son, as identified on an inscription, of the long-reigning Ebiq-Adad II. The city-state of Assur which he had inherited would have been fairly wealthy as the hub of the trading network at the height of the Old Assyrian Empire's activity and, despite the destruction of the trading post at Kanesh partway through his reign, commerce apparently continued elsewhere. The Assyrian King List records that Shamshi-Adad I, “went away to Babylonia in the time of Narām-Sîn.” Shamshi-Adad I was not to return until taking Ekallatum, pausing three years and then overthrowing Erishum II (c. 1760 BC – c. 1754 BC), son and successor of Naram-Sin.|$|E
25|$|The blacking-warehouse was {{the last}} house on the {{left-hand}} side of the way, at old Hungerford Stairs. It was a crazy, tumble-down old house, abutting of course on the river, and literally overrun with rats. Its wainscoted rooms, and its rotten floors and staircase, and the old grey rats swarming down in the cellars, {{and the sound of}} their squeaking and scuffling coming up the stairs at all times, and the dirt and decay of the place, rise up visibly before me, as if I were there again. The counting-house was on the first floor, looking over the coal-barges and the river. There was a recess in it, in which I was to sit and work. My work was to cover the pots of paste-blacking; first with a piece of oil-paper, and then with a piece of blue paper; to tie them round with a string; and then to clip the paper close and neat, all round, until it looked as smart as a pot of ointment from an apothecary's shop. When a certain number of grosses of pots had attained this pitch of perfection, I was to paste on each a printed label, and then go on again with more pots. Two or three other boys were kept at similar duty down-stairs on similar wages. One of them came up, in a ragged apron and a paper cap, on the first Monday morning, to show me the trick of using the string and tying the knot. His name was Bob Fagin; and <b>I</b> <b>took</b> <b>the</b> liberty of using his name, long afterwards, in Oliver Twist.|$|E

500|$|Other {{accomplished}} {{early works}} include the two string quartets, composed between 1928 and 1930, in which Tippett sought {{to combine the}} styles of Beethoven and Haydn respectively with folk-song, as Beethoven had in his Rasumovsky quartets of 1806. Tippett explains the withdrawal of these and the other early works: [...] "I realised very clearly {{that they were not}} totally consonant with myself. I didn't think they had the stamp of artistic durability. So <b>I</b> <b>took</b> <b>the</b> whole lot along to R.O. Morris who agreed that they didn't show enough technical mastery." ...|$|E

500|$|A [...] "symbol of courage, strength, and wisdom", Link was {{designed}} by Miyamoto as a coming of age motif for players to identify with: he begins the game an ordinary boy but strengthens to triumph over the ultimate evil. The name of the princess was inspired by Zelda Fitzgerald: [...] "Zelda {{was the name of}} the wife of the famous novelist F. Scott Fitzgerald. She was a famous and beautiful woman from all accounts, and I liked the sound of her name. So <b>I</b> <b>took</b> <b>the</b> liberty of using her name for the very first Zelda title," [...] Miyamoto explained.|$|E
500|$|Cameron Thor had {{previously}} worked with Spielberg on Hook, and initially auditioned {{for the role}} of Malcolm, before trying out {{for the role of}} Dodgson. Thor said about casting, [...] "It just said 'shaving-cream can' in the script, so I spent endless time in a drug store to find the most photogenic. I went with Barbasol, which ended up in the movie. I was so broke that <b>I</b> <b>took</b> <b>the</b> can home after the audition to use it." [...] Laura Dern was Spielberg's first choice for the role of Ellie Sattler. Spielberg chose to cast Wayne Knight after seeing his acting performance in Basic Instinct, saying, [...] "I waited for the credits to roll and wrote his name down".|$|E
500|$|In {{the first}} part, [...] "Love Without Tragedy", Rihanna as the narrator, sings about {{a moment in}} the life which she regrets in the lines [...] "Who knew the course of this one drive/ Injured us fatally/ You took the best years of my life/ <b>I</b> <b>took</b> <b>the</b> best years of your life". [...] "Love Without Tragedy", blends 80s pop music and guitar with a [...] "modern and fresh" [...] reggae {{inspired}} melody. Rihanna is channeling the emotions caused by her assault from Chris Brown in which can be seen through the lines [...] "Felt love struck me with a knife/ I pray that love don't strike twice", and [...] "Who knew the course of this one drive injured us fatally?" ...|$|E
