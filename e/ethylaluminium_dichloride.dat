40|$|Initiator systems {{resulting}} from the combination of cyclopentadienyltitanium trichloride (CpTiCl 3), <b>ethylaluminium</b> <b>dichloride</b> (EtAlCl 2) with and without methylaluminoxane (MAO), were used to initiate styrene (S) homopolymerization and S/ 1 -alkene copolymerization.

Both S/ 1 -C 10 H 20 and S/ 1 -C 16 H 32 copolymers obtained from various S/ 1 -alkene molar ratios in the initial feed contained variable amounts of boiling-butanone-insoluble product which was a S/ 1 -alkene copolymer according to NMR and DSC analyses.

40|$|The {{main goal}} of this work is to study the {{cationic}} polymerisation of terpenes, particularly of -pinene, with alkylaluminium catalysts. Some experiments at different polymerisation temperatures (10, 20 and 50 ºC) were carried out with <b>ethylaluminium</b> <b>dichloride</b> catalyst, C 2 H 5 AlCl 2. From the results, {{it is possible to}} draw some general conclusions about the evolution of chain growth during polymerisation. This also includes the influence of reaction temperature upon some properties of the final resin, particularly the molecular weight distribution, the softening point and the Gardner colour index. The role of reducing agents, such as iodine, during the distillation of the final resin is also evaluated with respect to colour and softening point. As a result of this investigation, the Mark-Howink constants for terpene resins in toluene and dicloromethane as solvents have also been experimentally determined, thus allowing a more precise use of SEC in the characterisation of such natural based products...|$|E

Compounds L 1 -L 3 (2 -(3, 5 -dimethyl- 1 H-pyrazol- 1 -yl) ethyldiphenylphosphinite (L 1), 2 -(3, 5 -di-tert-butyl- 1 H-pyrazol- 1 -yl) ethyldiphenylphosphinite (L 2), 2 -(3, 5 -diphenyl- 1 H-pyrazol- 1 -yl) ethyldiphenylphosphinite (L 3) were prepared using the synthetic routes reported in literature. These compounds were characterized using 1 H NMR, 31 P{ 1 H}NMR and 13 C{ 1 H}NMR spectroscopy. Treatment of L 1 -L 3 with [NiCl 2 (CH 3 OCH 2) 2] or [NiBr 2 (CH 3 OCH 2) 2] under appropriate reaction conditions resulted in the formation of six new nickel(II) compounds (1 – 6). These nickel complexes, due to their paramagnetic nature, failed to give satisfactory NMR signals. The nickel complexes were therefore characterized using elemental analysis, mass spectrometry, infra-red spectroscopy and magnetic susceptibility measurements. Additionally, these new nickel(II) complexes catalyzed the oligomerization of ethylene in the presence of <b>ethylaluminium</b> <b>dichloride</b> co-catalyst, to produce butenes, hexenes, octenes and higher carbon chain ethylene oligomers with very little Friedel-Crafts alkylation products. The catalytic products were analyzed using gas chromatography (GC), gas chromatography–mass spectrometry (GC-MS) and atmospheric pressure chemical ionization (APCI) mass spectroscopy. Compounds L 1 -L 3 were further treated with [PdCl(CH 3) (COD) ] and [PdCl 2 (NCCH 3) 2] using literature protocols. This resulted in the formation of six palladium complexes 7 - 12. Compound 7 is known but compounds 8 - 12 were new. All the palladium compounds were characterized using 1 H NMR, 31 P{ 1 H}NMR, 13 C{ 1 H}NMR spectroscopy and in selected cases [...] ...|$|E
40|$|Complexes of some {{divalent}} {{first row}} {{transition metal ions}} with various ligands have been prepared. These included bis-complexes of β-ketoenolate ligands, nickel complexes of trialkylphosphine and nickel complexes containing phosphine and β-ketoenolate ligands, and finally, tris, bis and mono(ethylenediamine) complexes. Composition was ascertained by microanalysis and ¹H, ¹³C NMR of the diamagnetic complexes. In addition, the crystal structure {{of one of the}} nickel β-ketoenolate triethylphosphine complexes was determined. The infrared spectra of the above compounds have been examined over the range 4000 - 50 cm⁻¹ with a view to determining band assignments based on metal ion substitution, ligand substitution (for phosphine and β-ketoenolate complexes), ligand and metal ion isotopic labelling [for tris(ethylenediamine) complexes] and anion substitution (for phosphine and ethylenediamine complexes). In each case, spectra-structure correlations have been established and are discussed. Each of the nickel complexes prepared above was tested as a catalyst for the oligomerisation of 1 -hexene. The experiments were carried out in batch at 40 °C using toluene as solvent. Four different Lewis acid cocatalysts were tested and nickel : co-catalyst ratios of 1 : 1 and 1 : 10 were used. The effects of Lewis acid strength and concentration, nickel complex structure, a change in the donor chelating atom and the presence of phosphine ligands on the isomerisation, as well as the activity and selectivity of the oligomerisation reaction, are discussed. Two polymer-supported catalyst complexes have been prepared; the first,: by polymerisation of a nickel β-ketoenolate complex monomer and th, second, by binding a nickel β-ketoenolate phosphine complex to a polystyrene support through the phosphine ligand. The resultinJ polymers were extensively characterised by microanalysis, infrared, ¹H and ¹³C NMR, mass spectrometry, energy dispersive X-ray and thermal techniques. In the presence of a ten-fold excess of the <b>ethylaluminium</b> <b>dichloride</b> co-catalyst, each supported complex formed an active 1 -hexene oligomerisation and isomerisation system. The activity and selectivity of each system have been compared to that of their respective monomers. Finally, the polymerised, 8 -ketoenolate monomer was tested at various temperatures as a propene oligomerisation catalyst and the effect of temperature on activity and selectivity is discussed...|$|E

A similar reaction using the meta ligand, namely α,α,α′,α′-tetrakis(3, 5 -di-tert-butyl- 2 -hydroxyphenyl) -m-xylene (m-L 2 H 4) afforded the complex {[VO(OnPr) (THF) ] 2 (-p-L 2) } (3). Use of [V(Np-R 1 C 6 H 4) (tBuO) 3] (R 1 = Me, CF 3) with p-L 1 H 4 led to {{the isolation of the}} oxo-imido complexes {[VO(tBuO) ][V(Np-R 1 C 6 H 4) (tBuO) ](-p-L 1) } (R 1 = Me, 4 ·CH 2 Cl 2; CF 3, 5 ·CH 2 Cl 2), whereas use of [V(Np-R 1 C 6 H 4) Cl 3] (R 1 = Me, CF 3) in combination with Et 3 N/p-L 1 H 4 or p-L 1 Na 4 afforded the diimido complexes {[V(Np-MeC 6 H 4) (THF) Cl] 2 (-p-L 1) }· 4 toluene (6 · 4 toluene) or {[V(Np-CF 3 C 6 H 4) (THF) Cl] 2 (-p-L 1) } (7). For comparative studies, the complex [(VO) (μ-OnPr) L 3] 2 (8) has also been prepared via the interaction of [VO(nPrO) 3] and 2 -(α-(2 -hydroxy- 3, 5 -di-tert-butylphenyl) benzyl) - 4, 6 -di-tert-butylphenol (L 3 H 2). The crystal structures of 1 · 2 THF, 2 · 2 MeCN, 3, 4 ·CH 2 Cl 2, 5 ·CH 2 Cl 2, 6 · 4 toluene·thf, 7 and 8 have been determined. Complexes 1 – 3 and 5 - 8 have been screened as pre-catalysts for the polymerization of ethylene {{in the presence of a}} variety of co-catalysts (with and without a re-activator), including DMAC (dimethylaluminium chloride), DEAC (diethylaluminium chloride), EADC (<b>ethylaluminium</b> <b>dichloride)</b> and EASC (ethylaluminium sesquichloride) at various temperatures and for the co-polymerization of ethylene with propylene; results are compared versus the benchmark catalyst [VO(OEt) Cl 2]. In some cases, activities as high as 243, 400 g/mmolV. h (30. 43 Kg PE/mmolV. h. bar) were achievable, whilst it also proved possible to obtain higher molecular weight polymers (in comparable yields to the use of [VO(OEt) Cl 2]). In all cases with dimethylaluminium chloride (DMAC) /ethyltrichloroacetate (ETA) activation, the activities achieved surpassed those of the benchmark catalyst.

40|$|Magister Scientiae - MSc (Chemistry) Reactions of furan, {{thiophene}} and alkyl carbonyl chlorides with Unsubstituted and substituted pyrazoles {{produced the}} desired pyrazolyl ligands, [R 2 pyrazole-CO-R/] (R= H, Me, tBu, Ph, R/ = furan, thiophene, Me or tBu) in good yields. The reaction of these synthons with Pd(NCMe) 2 Cl 2 as the metal precursor afforded the respective palladium(II) complexes in moderate to high yields. All compounds synthesised were characterised {{by a combination}} of 1 H NMR, 13 C NMR and IR spectroscopic techniques for structure elucidation. Microanalyses were performed to confirm the purity of the compounds. Single crystal X-ray crystallography of complexes bis{ 2 -(3, 5 -dimethylpyraz olyl- 1 -carbonyl) furan}PdCl 2, 1, and bis{ 2 -(3, 5 -dimethylpyrazolyl- 1 -carbonyl) thiophene} PdCl 2, 2, was performed to determine the molecular structures of the compounds. The two structures show that the complexes formed are mononuclear. The ligands exhibit monodentate coordination with trans-geometry being favoured in the square planar complexes. Activation of some of the complexes, 1 - 4, with the methylaluminoxane (MAO) produced active catalysts for ethylene polymerisation at elevated temperatures giving high-density linear polyethylene. The optimum Al:Pd ratio was found to be 5000 : 1. The nature of the substituent on the pyrazolyl moiety affects the activity of these catalysts in ethylene polymerisation. In general, increase in steric bulk resulted in decreased catalytic activity and low molecular weight polyethylene. The use of the Lewis acid, B(C 6 F 5) 3, with catalyst 2 resulted in enhanced catalytic activity towards ethylene polymerisation. When <b>ethylaluminium</b> <b>dichloride,</b> EtAlCl 2, was used as the co-catalyst, these catalyst systems were found to be active towards ethylene oligomerisation producing mostly C 10 and C 12 oligomers. An optimum Al:Pd ratio of 1000 : in the catalytic activity of catalyst 2 was observed. The nature of the alkyl substituent on the pyrazolyl system also shows significant influence in the oligomerisation process. The activity of the catalysts as well as the nature of the oligomers produced greatly depends on the oligomerisation conditions. For example, increase in both temperature and pressure resulted on significant increase in turnover number of catalyst 1 and 2. Longer reaction times resulted in drastic drop in the catalytic activity of the complexes. When acetic acid was reacted with the appropriate pyrazole {{in the presence of a}} phase transfer catalyst, the bidentate bis-pyrazolyl acetic acid ligands, {(pyrazole) 2 CHCO 2 H}, L 14, {(Me 2 pyrazole) 2 CHCO 2 H, L 15, and {(tBu 2 pyrazole) 2 CHCO 2 H} L 16 were obtained in good yields. The reaction of these ligands with Pd(NCMe) 2 Cl 2 in a 1 : 1 ratio afforded the corresponding yellow complexes, Pd(L 14) Cl 2, 9, Pd(L 15) Cl 2, 10, and Pd(L 16) Cl 2, 11, in moderate yields. 1 H NMR, 13 C NMR and IR spectroscopy have been used to characterise these compounds. Microanalysis confirmed the purity and empirical formulae of the complexes. Reaction of L 14 with ethanol under acidic conditions produced the respective ester, bis(pyrazol- 1 -yl) ethyl acetate, (L 17) in good yield. The acid dissociation constants of the ligands and their palladium(II) complexes have been determined by titration using dilute NaOH. Ka values within the range of 1. 8 × 10 - 4 to 1. 75 × 10 - 2 were obtained. Acidity was found to decrease with increase in the electron donor ability of the alkyl pyrazolyl substituents. In general, the palladium(II) complexes were more acidic than their corresponding ligands. South Afric...|$|E
