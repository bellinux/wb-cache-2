25|$|In 2002, the <b>front</b> <b>clip</b> {{was changed}} {{slightly}} {{to match the}} R/T and ACR <b>front</b> <b>clip</b> {{with the exception of}} missing a lower lip. This was done by making the grille smaller.|$|E
25|$|The {{front and}} rear clips were also {{redesigned}} on the Taurus and Sable sedans; all body panels were brand-new except the doors. Station wagons received the new front clips but from the firewall back they were {{essentially the same as}} the 1996-1999 wagons. The Taurus now had the turn signals integrated into the headlamps, {{similar to that of the}} previous generation Sable. The front bumper was also redesigned to include a larger front grille which, like the previous generation, contained a chrome bar running through the middle containing the Ford logo. The rear clip was redesigned with a larger trunk and trunklid, as mentioned above, as well as giving the Taurus two large taillights as opposed to the rear lightbar used in the previous generation cars. Mounted on the trunklid was a large chrome bar containing the Ford logo, like in the front. In 2003 for the 2004 model year, the <b>front</b> <b>clip</b> was slightly redesigned, and the Taurus got a new front bumper and grille. The grille was made smaller, with the chrome bar removed, replaced by just a large Ford logo in the center. The taillights were slightly redesigned, originally to include amber turn signals, but this was cancelled at the eleventh hour. Instead the rear was given larger reverse lights, and the chrome bar above the license plate bracket was deleted.|$|E
2500|$|... 1992: All {{three models}} of the Storm {{received}} a new headlight cluster (with narrow sealed-beam halogen headlamps also seen in that year's Pontiac Grand Prix GTP), tail lights, and <b>front</b> <b>clip.</b> Base models received a new rear bumper treatment. Instrument panel and gauge graphics were also slightly revised. The GSi version received a new spoiler and a larger DOHC engine which offered 10 extrahp.|$|E
50|$|The base Coronet and Deluxe were {{available}} as two-door sedans, four-door sedans and station wagons. For 1965 only, Dodge also sold only 101 units of a modified wheelbase {{version of the}} base Coronet two-door sedan and 440 hardtop used for NHRA drag racing. The model known as A990 came with a racing version of the 426 Hemi engine. The car A990 was stripped of all features and included base bucket seats from Dodge's truck-van line of vehicles. The altered wheelbase eventually became commonly known as Funny Cars because of their stretched <b>front</b> <b>clips.</b> <b>Front</b> seat belts and padded dash were standard.|$|R
50|$|The only {{model that}} was deleted from the 1962 lineup was the Deluxe series two-door wagon, which had slipped in {{popularity}} since the four-door wagon's debut in 1960. However, some leftover 1961-model two-door wagon bodies were fitted {{with the new}} 1962 <b>front</b> <b>clips.</b> This was done to fill a U.S. government fleet order. No one is certain how many were built, although the number was certainly minuscule, and none are known to exist today.|$|R
2500|$|The VAM cars {{came with}} {{different}} trims and interiors than the equivalent AMC-made models. The models also combined different <b>front</b> <b>clips,</b> {{such as the}} 1977 VAM American came with the shorter U.S. and Canadian market 1977 Gremlin front end, while its interior trim featured premium seats and upholstery. The engines in VAM models were based on AMC designs, but modified and built by VAM. Unique to Mexico included the [...] and [...] I6 engines. These were designed {{to cope with the}} high altitudes encountered in Mexico.|$|R
2500|$|The American ECD {{was once}} again {{restricted}} to the four-door sedan only for 1977. The model incorporated the new Gremlin <b>front</b> <b>clip</b> {{like the rest of}} the American line of the year. The [...] "258" [...] engine displacement emblems were replaced by new [...] "4.2" [...] units and the bumper guards were included free of extra charge. Power brakes were moved to the standard equipment list. Most of the light group was also installed as standard equipment; aside from the already existing courtesy lights came the hood light, trunk light and glove box light. The electric clock was fully standardized in all units. Front seat belts were upgraded into three-point retractable units. The rear seat back got a concealed fold-down armrest. AMC's original factory air conditioning system for the first time became available as optional equipment. The Carter RBS one-barrel carburetor was discontinued leaving only the Carter YF model.|$|E
2500|$|The generational {{change that}} AMC Matadors {{received}} for 1974 in the United States was also introduced in Mexico. The Classic DPL obtained the longer [...] "coffin nose" [...] <b>front</b> <b>clip</b> design {{complete with the}} change from dual headlights to single units, grille-mounted parking lights as well as five-mile-per-hour bumpers with standard bumper guards. The rear licence plate was relocated {{to the center of}} the rear panel and obtained new longer rectangular taillights. The interior saw the all-new padded dashboard with three squared pods for instruments (emergency lights, gasoline level and water temperature to the left, 200 km/h speedometer at the center and the electric clock on the right) and a horizontal radio design. Seats and interior door panels were once again redesigned. Units ordered with the automatic transmission also included power steering and a heater. The beginning of automotive engine emission certification in Mexico affected the [...] six, which changed to a lower 8.5:1 compression ratio.|$|E
2500|$|In July 1986 the CB71 {{became the}} CB72 after a rather {{thorough}} facelift. The headlights were new, of the wraparound sort {{and the interior}} was changed with a new dashboard, but the main changes were under the skin: the old rear suspension was replaced with Suzuki's patented ITL suspension (Isolated Trailing Link). This three-link rigid setup considerably improved the ride. By February 1987, the Fronte became available as a three-door, with the FS Twin Cam 12 version with a [...] at 7500rpm, DOHC 12-valve F5A engine (FR in the five-door version). The engine had two horsepower more in the Alto; {{this is due to}} less stringent emissions standards for commercial vehicles. In August 1987 a three-speed automatic transmission became available, and lastly there was also a pert-time four-wheel drive version of the five-door CB72 Fronte (the CD72S, from January 1988). By September, the CB/CD72 was replaced. The 1988 Suzuki Cervo used the chassis, <b>front</b> <b>clip</b> and door panels from the CB/CD72 Fronte.|$|E

5000|$|From August 1976, long-wheelbase {{versions}} (3425 mm) were produced. These {{were available}} as 7/8 seater saloons with works bodies or as a chassis with complete <b>front</b> body <b>clip,</b> the latter {{serving as the}} base for ambulance and hearse bodies by external suppliers like Binz or Miesen. These [...] "Lang" [...] versions could be ordered as 240D, 300D and 250 models.|$|R
2500|$|On January 22, 1988, {{the next}} Cervo was introduced. Suzuki were accentuating the Cervo's van {{capabilities}} this time around, with a squat, boxy rear end {{which gave the}} car an excceedingly bizarre appearance {{in combination with the}} <b>front</b> <b>clip</b> and door skins of the Alto/Fronte. The C-pillar was very wide, the front part of the roof was made of glass, there was a small wraparound rear spoiler and a more prominent one {{at the top of the}} hatchback lid. One nickname in Japan was [...] "Airbrick", while others referred to it as [...] "Komachi Yokocho" [...] (横丁小町, [...] "side alley beauty") - hinting at the Cervo's continued popularity with stylish young females. The interior was no less unusual than the outside: a large gray and bright yellow diagonal pattern covered the seats while white gauges added a touch of sportiness. Storage compartments abounded, in the thick C-pillars as well as in a central console. A high-powered Mitsubishi Diatone stereo was also standard.|$|E
2500|$|The GXP {{powerplant}} is the LS4 V8, a 5.3L Displacement on Demand (active fuel management) engine {{based on}} the LS1 block. Output of this version is 303hp (226kW)/323lb·ft (438 N·m). It has a shortened crankshaft, {{and a host of}} other modifications to make it fit into a front-wheel-drive vehicle. The GXP also has a 4-speed automatic transmission with paddle-style TAPshift, heads-up display, vented cross drilled brakes with PBR calipers, performance tuned suspension with Bilstein gas-charged struts (sits about [...] lower than other GP models), Magnasteer II, and StabiliTrak dynamic control system. Also, the DIC will display G-Force (maximum achieved for lateral, acceleration, and deceleration) information when the car is not moving. [...] Cosmetically, the GXP differs from the other models with more aggressive bodywork including a different <b>front</b> <b>clip,</b> wheel well cooling vents on the front fenders, a different rear bumper, and twin-dual polished exhaust. The Grand Prix GXP also offers a unique feature of the different-width [...] polished Alcoa Forged aluminum wheels. The front wheels are [...] wide, and the rear wheels are [...] wide.|$|E
2500|$|American Motors {{advertising}} {{assured that}} the new Matador {{was not just a}} name change and facelift, but in reality it was the 1970 Rebel restyled with a longer <b>front</b> <b>clip</b> and a new interior. The 1971 model year Matadors acquired a [...] "beefier" [...] front end look for all three body designs: two-door hardtop, four-door sedan, and station wagon. The AMC Matador shared its basic body design from the firewall back with the Ambassador, which was built on the same platform, but had a longer wheelbase and front-end sheetmetal, a formal grille and luxurious trim, as well as more standard equipment that included air conditioning. Interior wise, it shared the same dash, instrument cluster, steering wheel, and arm rests as the 1970 Rebel. Also reused was the 1967–1970 Rebel [...] "Weather Eye" [...] three-lever fan/heat control unit. The 1971 model came with a split-bench front seat with individual fold-down center arm rests for passenger and driver seats. Externally the 1971 model retained the same trunk lid chrome strip and rear-corner chrome garnishes as the 1970 Rebel. The rear bumper was also the same as the 1970 Rebel but with a new tail light lens assembly of three-in-line square lenses with rounded corners.|$|E

50|$|The rebuild did {{not just}} involve the {{installation}} of a new boiler; the entire locomotive underwent modification. The most obvious external change was the steam space cover running {{the length of the}} boiler barrel and copied from the ČSD Class 477.0, which lent the locomotives a sleek, modern appearance. The large smoke deflectors too were replaced by smaller ones with the upper <b>front</b> corners <b>clipped</b> off at an angle.|$|R
5000|$|This {{approach}} has problems when the eye itself is inside a shadow volume (for example, {{when the light}} source moves behind an object). From this point of view, the eye sees the back face of this shadow volume before anything else, and this adds a −1 bias to the entire stencil buffer, effectively inverting the shadows. This can be remedied by adding a [...] "cap" [...] surface {{to the front of}} the shadow volume facing the eye, such as at the <b>front</b> <b>clipping</b> plane. There is another situation where the eye may be in the shadow of a volume cast by an object behind the camera, which also has to be capped somehow to prevent a similar problem. In most common implementations, because properly capping for depth-pass can be difficult to accomplish, the depth-fail method (see below) may be licensed for these special situations. Alternatively one can give the stencil buffer a +1 bias for every shadow volume the camera is inside, though doing the detection can be slow.|$|R
2500|$|The {{introductory}} 1974 Gremlins became unique {{by incorporating}} the <b>front</b> <b>clip</b> of the 1974 U.S. AMC Hornet models. VAM never attempted {{to hide the}} relation between the two models, which never harmed the sales or image of either model and was favored by the public. The launch of the Gremlin in Mexico also meant the resurrection of the [...] I6 engine that was discontinued in 1972. The engine was practically the same as in its final year except for a slightly lower compression ratio (8.3:1 instead of 8.5:1). The advertised output was still the same at 145 gross horsepower at 4,400 revolutions per minute and was restricted to one-barrel carburetors. In contrast, since 1973 all VAM-based Hornets had the [...] six as the standard and only engine. VAM Gremlins were basic economy cars with manual 3-speed transmission, four-wheel drum brakes, manual steering, front sway bar, column-mounted shifters only, rigid four-bladed cooling fan, folding bench seats, two-point front seatbelts, electric wipers and washers, monaural AM radio, cigarette lighter, front and rear ashtrays, locking glovebox, flip-open rear side vents, roof rack, full carpeting with driver's side rubber mat, padded sunvisors, sound-insulating cardboard-type headliner, dual coat hooks and round dome light. Options for 1974 included a column-mounted automatic transmission, power steering, power drum brakes, heater, parcel shelf, light group, remote-controlled driver and passenger side outside mirrors, sports steering wheel, bright molding package, and wheel trim rings. All VAM Gremlins used the AMC's three-pod instrument cluster from the domestic-built Hornet with a blank in the third gauge position from the factory. The introductory year production was 2,137.|$|E
2500|$|As the 1977 models arrived, the {{engineering}} upgrades {{seen on the}} 258 six the year before finally saw {{the light on the}} 282. An all-new head design with Quench-type combustion chambers took compression ratio from 7.7:1 to 8.0:1. It was accompanied by a totally new aluminum intake manifold with improved flow keeping the Holley 2300 two-barrel carburetor. These improvements made the 1977 American Rally the best-performing model of its series, even surpassing the high compression 1972 model. Despite this, advertised horsepower and torque ratings were the same as the year before. The power increase allowed the use of a new 3.07:1 rear differential gear ratio for better economy and top speed without losing acceleration and towing capacity. The front high-back bucket seats obtained new patterns {{and for the first time}} since 1972 reclining mechanism (as standard equipment), three-point front seatbelts with double retractable mechanism were added, a new VAM-designed digital tachometer took the place of the conventional analog unit in the midyear. In the exterior, the largest novelty of the year was the application of the new Gremlin <b>front</b> <b>clip.</b> New decals covering only the front fenders in their top sides started near the doors all the way to the marker lights, between the lights and stripe was a [...] "Rally 4.6" [...] sticker. Like the three luxury versions of the line for the year, the 1977 American Rally was the first unit of its series to offer the original factory air conditioning system as an option. The hood and trunk lights as well as the glove box unit were added to the standard equipment list.|$|E
