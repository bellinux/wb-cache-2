2500|$|The 567 is {{laid out}} with engine {{accessories}} (oil and water pumps and governors) at the [...] "forward" [...] end and the power take off at the [...] "rear" [...] end. The blowers and camshafts are at the [...] "rear" [...] end of the engine, with the blowers mounted above the power take off."The full line of engines was designed with the same general arrangement, revising basically only the length of crankshaft and crankcase to [...] the required number of cylinders. It appeared that the most satisfactory method of having the engine accessories such as pumps, governor, etc. easily maintained would be to drive them through a gear train at the forward end of the engine, that is, opposite the power take-off end. Having {{the location of the}} pumps all {{at one end of the}} engine, called the accessory <b>drive</b> <b>end,</b> fitted very well into locomotive installation. A leaf spring flexible drive gear mounted on the crankshaft was used to eliminate all crankshaft torsional vibration from the gear train."By using either one or two blowers for an 8 or 12 cylinder engine respectively and mounting them above the main generator, it was possible to shorten the overall length of the engine and generator installation. This was one of the main original objectives. The blowers as well as the camshafts were driven at the power take-off end of the engine by another gear train." ...|$|E

50|$|The {{following}} two <b>drives</b> <b>ended</b> with passing errors; a Tusker <b>drive</b> <b>ended</b> when Adrian Awasom broke up a Griesen pass on fourth-and-two at the Vegas 35, {{but the next}} Locos <b>drive</b> <b>ended</b> with Florida defensive back Keiwan Ratliff intercepting a pass intended for Brian Hernandez with 1:55 elapsed in the fourth quarter. Ratliff's interception, the only turnover of the game, turned into a Tuskers offensive drive that {{led them to the}} Las Vegas 4-yard line (thanks to a 36-yard reception by Maurice Hicks and resulted in a 21-yard field goal by Nick Novak that drew Florida to within 21-20 of Las Vegas with 7:48 left in regulation.|$|R

5000|$|The {{full-scale}} IsaMills allowed MIM {{to refine}} the mill design to allow improved ease of maintenance. For example, the shell design was changed {{to allow it to}} split along the horizontal center-line (see Figure 5). This was done to allow the use of a replaceable slip-in liner, avoiding the need for the shell to be sent away for cold rubber lining and the need to have a stock of spare, lined shells. Also, the direction of flow of feed through the mill was reversed, because most of the disk wear occurred at the feed end, which was initially at the <b>drive</b> <b>end</b> of the mill. By changing the feed end to that opposite the <b>drive</b> <b>end,</b> the disks that required most frequent replacement were the first that were removed from the shaft rather than the last (see Figure 6 and Figure 7). [...] While the IsaMills at Mount Isa were operated using screened copper smelter reverberatory furnace slag as the grinding medium, those at McArthur River used screened primary grinding mill fines as the grinding medium for the first seven years of their operation and, in 2004, switched to using screened river sand.|$|E

50|$|The Bills, {{hoping to}} shake off a loss to the winless Miami Dolphins on the road the week before, faced the 0-4 Cleveland Browns at Ralph Wilson Stadium. The wind played a factor {{throughout}} the game, {{making it difficult for}} both teams to sustain drives in the air. The Browns and Bills traded punts in the first quarter until the Bills had a <b>drive</b> <b>end</b> at their own 47 after turning it over on downs. This stop led to the only points of the first half by the Browns, a 24-yard field goal by backup kicker Billy Cundiff. Cundiff was the starter at kicker for the Browns due to the injury to their regular kicker Phil Dawson.|$|E

50|$|The game {{began with}} little action. Denver and Cincinnati both traded {{possessions}} {{to begin the}} game. However, on the Bengals' second possession {{they were able to}} drive deep into Denver territory, reaching the 11-yard line before setting up for a short field goal. However, the field goal snap was fumbled. After the flubbed field goal, both teams entered a period of offensive ineptness - Denver had four consecutive one-and-done drives, while Cincinnati was forced to punt, then had a promising <b>drive</b> <b>end</b> with a Carson Palmer interception after Denver cornerback Champ Bailey tipped the ball into the air and Wesley Woodyard recovered the interception. Denver was finally able to put together a drive {{at the end of the}} first half that finished with a Matt Prater 48-yard field goal as time ran out. Despite being out-gained in all offensive indicators, Denver took a 3-0 lead into halftime due to Cincinnati mistakes, including the fumbled field goal, interception, and multiple dropped passes.|$|E
5000|$|A {{harmonic}} damper is {{a device}} fitted {{to the free}} (accessory <b>drive)</b> <b>end</b> of the crankshaft of an internal combustion engine to counter torsional and resonance vibrations from the crankshaft. This device must be interference fit to the crankshaft in order to operate in an effective manner. An interference fit ensures the device moves in perfect step with crankshaft. It is essential on engines with long crankshafts (such as straight-8 engines) and V8 engines with cross plane cranks. Harmonics and torsional vibrations can greatly reduce crankshaft life, or cause instantaneous failure if the crankshaft runs at or through an amplified resonance. Dampers are designed with a specific weight (mass) which {{is dependent on the}} damping material/method used and the freedom it affords the mass move allowing to reduce mechanical Q factor, or damp, crankshaft resonances. A harmonic balancer (sometimes crankshaft damper, torsional damper, or vibration damper) is the same thing as a harmonic damper except that the balancer includes a counterweight to externally balance the rotating assembly. The harmonic balancer often serves as a pulley for the accessory drive belts turning the alternator, water pump and other crankshaft driven devices.|$|E

50|$|Losman {{returned}} at QB for the Locos on {{the next}} drive, connecting with John Madsen on its second play. Madsen appeared to fumble the ball away to the Tuskers, but a replay challenge determined that Madsen fumbled while his foot was on the boundary line, making him out of bounds and ending the play. The Locos <b>drive</b> <b>ended</b> two plays later in a punt. In fact, the next two <b>drives</b> <b>ended</b> in punts, the second of which featured {{what appeared to be}} a serious injury to the Locos' Josh Scobey, who leaned in with his head when tackling Tuskers return man Willie Andrews. Though Scobey left under his own power, he would not return due to back spasms. The Tuskers' next <b>drive</b> <b>ended</b> in an interception, which the Locos turned into a 45-yard field goal by Gano to end the half and make the score 7-3 in favor of the Tuskers.|$|R
50|$|In {{the third}} quarter, Texas scored on three {{consecutive}} touchdowns {{to begin the}} second half, including a 74-yard pass from David Ash to Malcolm Brown. The final two Longhorns drives {{in the third quarter}} ended in punts. New Mexico State began to third quarter with a <b>drive</b> <b>ending</b> in an interception; the four subsequent <b>drives</b> <b>ended</b> on punts. All Texas drives in the fourth quarter ended in touchdowns, while the Aggies were held scoreless. The game ended with Texas winning 56-7, exceeding the point spread and over-under set by oddsmakers prior to the game.|$|R
50|$|On {{their opening}} drive, the Texans reached the Bears 34-yard line, but had their <b>drive</b> <b>end</b> when Tracy Porter pulled {{the ball away}} from Hopkins for the interception; Chicago {{capitalized}} on the takeaway with Jeremy Langfords one-yard touchdown run. After the Texans punted, the Bears elected to attempt a fourth down conversion at Houstons 31-yard line, but turned the ball over on downs when Jay Cutler fumbled the snap. Nick Novak kicked a 28-yard field goal in the second quarter. The Texans took the lead when Osweiler threw a 23-yard touchdown pass to Hopkins, and {{had a chance to}} increase the margin when Osweiler threw a potential 83-yard touchdown pass to Fuller, but he dropped the pass; they punted three plays later. With 31 seconds left in the half, the Bears offense traveled 75 yards on three plays, including a 54-yard pass by Cutler to Alshon Jeffery, ending the drive with Cutlers 19-yard touchdown pass to Eddie Royal. On the second play of the third quarter, Cutler was intercepted by Andre Hal after Kevin White appeared to stop running his route midplay. Novak kicked a 28-yard field goal on the resulting drive. The next five drives of the game ended in punts, ending early in the fourth quarter when Fuller converted a screen pass into an 18-yard touchdown. The Texans increased the score to 23-14 via Novaks 38-yard kick. The Bears were unable to enter Houston territory on their final two drives.|$|E
5000|$|In March 1973 {{a team of}} Matra {{engineers}} led by Georges Pinardaud {{completed the}} initial design for project M560, {{which was to be}} a more powerful Bagheera. A key part of the project was the creation of a unique [...] "U engine" [...] out of two existing Simca straight-4 engines. The blocks came from two different Simca applications and rotated in opposite directions but shared the same 1294 cc displacement. One block was from the 1100Ti and was adapted to transverse mounting while the other was from the Simca 1000 Rallye II in which it had been mounted longitudinally. The two blocks were joined at an 82° angle using a common cast-aluminum sump that also carried a common oil supply for the engine. At the non-drive end another aluminum casting assured the alignment of the blocks while at the <b>drive</b> <b>end</b> a steel adapter fit the ends of both crankshafts. A sprocket and Morse chain from each crankshaft were connected to a 0.9 in shaft running {{down the middle of the}} sump that transmitted power from the left-hand crank to the right. Each block retained its own crankshaft, distributor, and water pump. The clutch and bell-housing of the engine from the Rallye II engine provided the transaxle mounting while a flywheel was only mounted to the 1100Ti crankshaft. The resulting [...] 8-cylinder assembly was fitted with four Weber 36 DCNF carburetors and, with a 9.8:1 compression ratio, produced [...] @ 6200 rpm and 216 Nm @ 4000 rpm.|$|E
40|$|A {{system that}} can {{accurately}} monitor and control low concentrations of ethylene gas includes a test chamber configured to receive sample gas potentially containing an ethylene concentration and ozone, a detector configured to receive light produced during a reaction between the ethylene and ozone and to produce signals related thereto, and a computer connected to the detector to process the signals to determine therefrom a value of the concentration of ethylene in the sample gas. The supply for the system can include a four way valve configured to receive pressurized gas at one input and a test chamber. A piston is journaled in the test chamber with a <b>drive</b> <b>end</b> disposed in a drive chamber and a reaction end defining with walls of the test chamber a variable volume reaction chamber. The <b>drive</b> <b>end</b> of the piston is pneumatically connected to two ports of the four way valve to provide motive force to the piston.

40|$|Case StudyA 1957 vintage {{multi-stage}} centrifugal compressor, {{critical in}} a refrigeration process, {{had a history}} of poor reliability and LP stage bearing failures. Around 1995 the HP casing had been replaced and upgraded. In early 2010, the compressor suffered a major failure, including rubbing internally due to a thrust bearing failure, and damages to the shaft and <b>drive</b> <b>end</b> coupling. A new rotor and new gear type coupling were installed, both matching the original design. Since the start up after this, the thrust and journal bearings had failed approximately once per month greatly reducing the reliability of the compressor and plant profitability. To eliminate this problem, it was decided to change the coupling and to redesign and replace the bearings from the LP compressor, within the very limited spacing of the original bearing assemblies...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{introduces}} a new bearing fault detection and diagnosis {{scheme based on}} hidden Markov modeling (HMM) of vibration signals. First features are extracted from amplitude demodulated vibration signals obtained from both normal and faulty bearings. The features {{are based on the}} reflection coefficients of the polynomial transfer function of the autoregressive model of the vibration signal. These features are then used to train HMMs to represent various bearing conditions. The technique allows for online detection of faults by monitoring the probabilities of the pre-trained HMM for the normal case. It also allows for the diagnosis of the fault by the HMM that gives the highest probability. The new scheme was tested with experimental data collected from <b>drive</b> <b>end</b> ball bearing of an induction motor (Reliance Electric 2 HP IQPreAlert) driven mechanical system...|$|E
