5|$|Molecular studies {{based on}} DNA {{analysis}} have suggested new relationships among mammal families {{over the last}} few years. Most of these findings have been independently validated by retrotransposon presence/absence <b>data.</b> <b>Classification</b> systems based on molecular studies reveal three major groups or lineages of placental mammals—Afrotheria, Xenarthra and Boreoeutheria—which diverged in the Cretaceous. The relationships between these three lineages is contentious, and all three possible different hypotheses have been proposed with respect to which group is basal. These hypotheses are Atlantogenata (basal Boreoeutheria), Epitheria (basal Xenarthra) and Exafroplacentalia (basal Afrotheria). Boreoeutheria in turn contains two major lineages—Euarchontoglires and Laurasiatheria.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. We present ActMiner, which {{addresses}} {{four major}} challenges to <b>data</b> stream <b>classification,</b> namely, infinite length, concept-drift, conceptevolution, and limited labeled data. Most {{of the existing}} <b>data</b> stream <b>classification</b> techniques address only the infinite length and conceptdrift problems. Our previous work, MineClass, addresses the conceptevolution problem in addition to addressing the infinite length and conceptdrift problems. Concept-evolution occurs in the stream when novel classes arrive. However, most of the existing <b>data</b> stream <b>classification</b> techniques, including MineClass, require that all the instances in a data stream be labeled by human experts and become available for training. This assumption is impractical, since data labeling is both time consuming and costly. Therefore, {{it is impossible to}} label a majority of the data points in a high-speed data stream. This scarcity of labeled data naturally leads to poorly trained classifiers. ActMiner actively selects only those data points for labeling for which the expected classification error is high. Therefore, ActMiner extends MineClass, and addresses the limited labeled data problem in addition to addressing the other three problems. It outperforms the state-of-the-art <b>data</b> stream <b>classification</b> techniques that use ten times or more labeled data than ActMiner. ...|$|R

The present paper proposes a Hybrid Fuzzy clustering algorithm (combination of Fuzzy C-means with extension and Subtractive clustering algorithm) for <b>data</b> <b>classifications</b> applications. The fuzzy c-means (FCM) and subtractive clustering (SC) algorithm {{has been widely}} discussed and applied in pattern recognitions, machine learning and <b>data</b> <b>classifications.</b> However the FCM could not guarantee unique clustering result because initial cluster number is chosen randomly {{as the result of}} the classification is unstable. On the other hand, the SC is a fast, one-pass algorithm for estimating the numbers and center of clusters for a set of data. This paper presents the two different clustering algorithms and their comparison. First clustering algorithm is fuzzy c-means clustering, and second is subtractive clustering. Results show that the SC is better than FCM in respect of speed but not as good in accuracy, so a modified hybrid clustering algorithm is designed with all these parameters. The experiments show that the hybrid clustering algorithm can improve the speed, and reduce the iterative amount. At the same time, the hybrid algorithm can make the results of data partitions are more stable and higher accuracy...|$|R
