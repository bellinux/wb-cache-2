40|$|At the {{beginning}} of the 20 th century London already head a steady Lithuanian community consisting of 1500 - 2000 persons. The first traces of organized community life date from 1894, when religiously conscious Lithuanians joined a Catholic Polish-Lithuanian mission. From 1896 onwards a few dozen activists formed a mutual assistance society and started to plan the establishment of a purely Lithuanian mission. On November 25, 1899 they formed a committee to found the St. Peter’s Lithuanian Mission; adapted standard statute for immigrant Catholic missions to Lithuanian needs; and began raising funds both to support the mission and to pay rent to the German Catholic church which the Lithuanians used for the mission. The committee also sought to obtain legitimation from the Westminster Archbishop for the already active Lithuanian mission and began looking for a Lithuanian priest willing to come to London. The archdiocese curia approved of the idea of a separate mission for Lithuanians and also began looking for a suitable priest. But it didn’t quite appreciate the subtleties of the Polish-Lithuanian dispute and the Lithuanian desire for not just a Lithuanian-speaking priest but one who supported the ideas of Lithuanian national separateness from Poland. Despite this tension, which included Lithuanian suspicions that the Westminster hierarchy tacitly intended to foist a Lithuanian-speaking Polonizer on the Lithuanians, the latter, on July 11, 1900, received official permission to found their mission. On January 7, 1901, the statute of St. Peter’s were approved by the curia, and Father Boleslovas Šlamas (1871 – 1917), a priest suggested by the Lithuanian activists, was appointed rector. The statute provided for the priest to be hired and paid an agreed-upon honorarium, with all material assets of the mission belonging not to the Westminster archdiocese but to the Lithuanian mission itself. A general meeting {{of the members of the}} mission was to be held once a year with the power to elect an executive committee composed of men with standing in the community. During the first three decades of the 20 th c. the mission’s leadership consisted of 20 to 30 men, of whom five or six were especially active and competed with each other. Until World War I Lithuanian community leaders in London established several more cultural and economic societies headed by the same people who also headed the Lithuanian mission. The not very numerous social activists espousing leftwing views also participated in organizing the Catholic mission. They believed that making Lithuanian community life more active is a task that should not be impeded by ideological commitments. During the rectorship of Fr. Boleslovas Šlamas (from January 7, 1901 to January 3, 1903) the Lithuanians bought a neglected building which they turned into a house of prayer after taking out a loan in the rector’s name. When the house was blessed on March 25, 1902, the archdiocese and the Lithuanian mission signed an agreement reflecting the Lithuanians’ deep-seated anxieties: it stated that the mission’s priests could be of any nationality except Polish. Though Father Šlamas played an essential role in securing the mission’s property, he also managed to split the mission itself. It is likely that he could not abide his status as a mere employee. After accusing the leadership of St. Peter’s Mission of financial machinations, he established a Society of St. Casimir which he himself controlled as well as a mutual aid society to serve the members of St. Casimir’s. Because of the well-entrenched tradition of respect for priests and also because of the fear that disputes might force the long-awaited Lithuanian priest to quit his job, most Lithuanians chose to join these new organizations. Even so it was Father Šlamas himself who soon became disappointed with what he had wrought, and he left London never to return. After his departure the leaders of St. Casimir Society took over the house of prayer and began looking for a new priest. After several unsuccessful attempts in that direction they hired Father Antanas Racevičius-Talmontas who served from July 1903 until November 1905 but he did not meet the expectations of London Lithuanians nor heal the rift that Father Šlamas had engendered. That was accomplished only by Father Kazimieras Jurgis Matulaitis (1868 – 1945) who served as rector in London for a quarter century (from November 15, 1905 to November 15, 1930); accepted the already established tradition of the mission’s self-government; and displayed exceptional initiative. As a result, the marginalized St. Peter’s Society in August 1906 joined forces with <b>he</b> <b>St.</b> Casimir Society, and the split was finally overcome when in February, 1908 both societies coalesced into one. Father K. J. Matulaitis created a huge symbolic capital and was the unquestioned leader of the Lithuanian community. The lay leaders acted in the shadows of his initiatives and recognized his authority, despite the fact that the rector and the committee of the mission had formally separate powers. The main event responsible for the rector’s popularity was the building of a new Lithuanian church in 1911 - 1912. The old house of prayer was sold having become dilapidated after ten year’s of use mainly because of a leaking roof. Even though the lot on which the new church was built and the building of it cost nearly five times as much as the acquisition of the old house of prayer, the rector and community leaders convinced the local Lithuanians to take on a greater financial burden for the sake of the future. This church is still the only Lithuanian church in Western Europe. The trust that the rector enjoyed is shown by the fact that the Lithuanians entrusted financial operations to him and not to the nucleus of community activists. Father Matulaitis supervised the community chest, established in 1913, that functioned like a quasi-savings bank. During World War I he established and ran a number of mutual aid societies. After the war local Lithuanians entrusted to him their personal savings to invest in Lithuanian banks. From {{the beginning}} of his term as rector Father Matulaitis generously cared for the indigent. But his authority also had its limits. Beside the church there was a Lithuanian social club which actually was mainly a pub. Father Matulaitis tried to curtail alcohol use there at least during the big religious feast-days. From 1927 to 1929 he even succeeded in getting the sale of alcohol prohibited altogether in this club. The Lithuanian immigrants, however, like real Londoners, could not imagine spending their free time on weekends without any alcohol whatsoever, so this temperance promotion from on high did not yield the desired results...|$|E
