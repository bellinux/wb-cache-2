500|$|Cobain {{originally}} {{wanted to}} name the album I Hate Myself and <b>I</b> <b>Want</b> <b>to</b> <b>Die,</b> a phrase that had originated in his journals in mid-1992. [...] At the time, the singer used the phrase as a response whenever someone {{asked him how he}} was doing. [...] Cobain intended the album title as a joke; he stated he was [...] "tired of taking this band so seriously and everyone else taking it so seriously". [...] Novoselic convinced Cobain to change the title due to fear that it could potentially result in a lawsuit. [...] The band then considered using Verse Chorus Verse—a title taken from its song [...] "Verse Chorus Verse", and an earlier working title of [...] "Sappy"—before eventually settling on In Utero. [...] The final title was taken from a poem written by Courtney Love.|$|E
