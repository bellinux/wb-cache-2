40|$|A Doctoral Thesis. Submitted in partial {{fulfilment}} of {{the requirements}} for the award of Doctor of Philosophy of Loughborough University. This thesis is concerned with identifying the problems and constraints faced by small batch manufacturing companies during the implementation of Computer Integrated Manufacturing (CIM). The main aim of this work is to recommend generic solutions to these problems with particular regard to those constraints arising {{because of the need}} for ClM systems integration involving both new and existing systems and procedures. The work has involved the application of modern computer technologies, including suitable hardware and software tools, in an industrial environment. Since the research has been undertaken with particular emphasis on the industrial implementor's viewpoint, it is supported by the results of a two phased implementation of computer based control systems within the machine shop of a manufacturing company. This involved the specific implementation of a Distributed Numerical Control system on a single machine in a <b>group</b> <b>technology</b> <b>cell</b> of machines followed by the evolution of this system into Cell and Machine Management Systems to provide a comprehensive decision support and information distribution facility for the foremen and uperators within the cell. The work also required the integration of these systems with existing Factory level manufacturing control and CADCAM functions. Alternative approaches have been investigated which may have been applicable under differing conditions and the implications that this specific work has for CIM systems integration in small batch manufacturing companies evaluated with regard not only to the users within an industrial company but also the systems suppliers external to the company. The work has resulted in certain generic contributions to knowledge by complementing ClM systems integration research with regard to problems encountered; cost implications; the use of appropriate methodologies including the role of emerging international standard methods, tools and technologies and also the importance of 'human integration' when implementing CIM systems in a real industrial situation...|$|E

30|$|Delivery {{reliability}} practice bundle {{is useful}} to ensure the on-time in-full delivery of products. In <b>Group</b> <b>Technology,</b> the components with similar characteristics are grouped together and manufactured in a cell with standard processes. As a result, a small minuscule “focused factories” are being formed as independent manufacturing units within large plants. Cellular manufacturing {{is based on the}} principles of <b>Group</b> <b>Technology.</b> The <b>cell</b> layout of machines is usually an U-shaped, to enable smooth one-piece flow production. Cellular manufacturing deploys quick setup, simple machine maintenance by operator himself (autonomous Maintenance), multi-process tools, working on multiple processes and efforts of flexible or multi-functional workforce by means of multi-machine working environment which results in reduction of cumulative lead time. Hence, ISM Model (phase 6) and UNIDO–ACMA Model (stage 5) are similar in nature to improve delivery reliability.|$|R

40|$|Cell {{formation}} {{is a critical}} step {{in the design of}} cellular manufacturing systems. Recently, it was tackled using a cut-based-graph-partitioning model. This model meets real-life production systems requirements as it uses the actual amount of product flows, it looks for the suitable number of cells, and it takes into account the natural constraints such as operation sequences, maximum cell size, cohabitation and non-cohabitation constraints. Based on this model, we propose an original encoding representation to solve the problem by using a genetic algorithm. We discuss the performance of this new GA in comparison to some approaches taken from the literature on a set of medium sized instances. Given the results we obtained, {{it is reasonable to assume}} that the new GA will provide similar results for large real-life problems.

40|$|In {{cellular}} manufacturing, {{machines are}} organized into compact and independent product-based <b>group</b> <b>technology</b> (GT) <b>cells.</b> Production in smaller GT cells not only reduces travel distances but also facilitates better material and production control. Cell compactness and cell independence {{are two basic}} requirements of efficient GT cells. Most cell formation procedures consider maximizing cell independence as the objective. In doing so, these procedures impose an upper limit on cell size as a threshold value for cell compactness. This paper views cell compactness and cell independence in terms of intercell and intracell move costs. The trade-off between intracell and intercell move costs is explained in detail. A nonlinear mathematical model and simulated annealing algorithm are developed that minimize the total intracell and intercell move costs. In the calculation of move costs, production quantity, effect of cell size on intracell move, effect of sequence of operations, and multiple nonconsecutive visits to the same machine are considered. The results are compared with published results...|$|R
40|$|This thesis compares three {{approaches}} for assigning workers and scheduling {{the flow of}} jobs in a <b>Group</b> <b>Technology</b> (GT) <b>cell.</b> The performance measure considered is the throughput time of jobs. The performance of the three strategies is analyzed by varying the following factors: (1) The ratio of Batch processing time to setup time. (2) Utilization. (3) The number of operators assigned to the cell. The scheduling strategies considered are Individual Machine Loading, Cell Dedication and Worker Batch Assignment. Analytical queueing models as well as computer simulations are {{used to compare the}} performance of the scheduling strategies. The dedicated cells perform best with large batch sizes and moderate workloads. The Worker Batch Assignment strategy does as well as traditional batch handling techniques with respect to the throughput time measure. This may be important since this kind of job assignment strategy has the advantage of augmenting quality (due to direct accountability) and enhancing morale without adversely impacting throughput times...|$|R

This facility layout of a FMS involves the positioning of cells within given boundaries, so as to minimize the total projected travel i time between cells. Defining the layout includes specifying the spatial coordinates of each cell, its orientation in either a horizontal or vertical position, and the location of its load or unloads point. There are many type of FMS layout such as In-line, loop ladder and robot centered cell layout. The research is concentrate on design and optimization FMS layout.

40|$|In this {{dissertation}} study, {{the problem}} of forming manufacturing cells is investigated {{with a focus on}} the cell formation methodology based on operation requirements and machine capability. Manufacturing economics, cell independence, within-cell layout and machine utilization are incorporated into the methodology. First, the formation of independent flow-line cells based on operation sequence is considered. Algorithms for sequence constrained part family formation are developed. A shortest path model with node-augmentation and an implicit enumeration algorithm are proposed to identify the optimal machine sequence and capacity, the result is compared with a greedy heuristic. Formation of general <b>Group</b> <b>Technology</b> (GT) <b>cells</b> without sequence constraints is then investigated. Parts are grouped into families according to the operation types required. A mathematical formulation is presented for machine group selection problem. This integer model takes into account fixed machine cost, variable production cost, setup cost, and intracell material handling cost. For the problems with moderate size, the model can be solved to optimality by a standard package such as Cplex. Heuristic procedures are also developed for machine group selection problem, which can identify good feasible solutions more efficiently. Finally, improvements on the methodology are made with an effort to integrate the decisions regarding part grouping and machine selection. Experimental results are provided to compare the performance and computational efficiency of different algorithms/heuristics. The effect of changing cost structure on the heuristic performance is also investigated for the case without sequence constraints through statistical experiment design. Future research is discussed at the conclusion of this dissertation...|$|R

40|$|One of {{the most}} {{practical}} approaches of improving productivity in a factory is to adopt the superior concept and technique of cellular manufacturing (CM) based on <b>group</b> <b>technology</b> (GT). Particularly, <b>cell</b> formation is an important, critical and difficult step in CM. In general, {{there have been a}} number of methodologies proposed for solving a machine-part grouping problem (MPGP). Besides considering the simple cell formation problem, some researchers have focused on machine flexibility, in which parts are having alternative routeings/process plans. However, it is very rare to consider the area of aggregation and disaggregation of machines in cell formation under uncertain constraints and uncertainty. In the light of this, the main aim of this present work is to address the MPGP holistically with the considerations of machine flexibility as well as machine aggregation and disaggregation simultaneously. In addition, based on the availability of alternative routeings, a method is proposed to generate an alternative solution for machine breakdown situations. Thus, the problem nature of this work will be more realistic and practical for today's global manufacturing era. The problem scope has been identified and the model is formulated in mathematical programming form. The objective function of this model is to minimize the total intercellular and intracellular part movement. Since MPGP has been proved to be non-polynomial (NP) complete, a genetic algorithm (GA), which is an excellent optimization technique, is employed to solve this problem. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|R
