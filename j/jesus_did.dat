Operated by the Irmandade de Bom <b>Jesus</b> <b>do</b> Monte the funicular connects the upper-town of Braga with the Shrine on which it gets its name, over a distance that parallels the Escadaria de Bom Jesus (Bom Jesus staircase) to the highest point at the statue of Saint Longinus.|$|R

25|$|Some early Christian Gnostic sects, believing <b>Jesus</b> <b>did</b> {{not have}} a {{physical}} substance, denied that he was crucified. In response, Ignatius of Antioch insisted that Jesus was truly born and was truly crucified and wrote that those who held that Jesus only seemed to suffer only seemed to be Christians.|$|E

25|$|Later, Wells {{concluded}} that a historical Jesus figure did exist and was a Galilean preacher, whose teachings were preserved in the Q document, a hypothetical common source for the gospels of Matthew and Luke. However, he continued to insist that Biblical <b>Jesus</b> <b>did</b> not exist and argued that stories such as the virgin birth, the crucifixion around A.D. 30 under Pilate and the resurrection {{should be regarded as}} legendary.|$|E

25|$|He {{emphasized}} that <b>Jesus</b> <b>did</b> not {{cease to be}} God {{when he became a}} man, nor did he lose any of his divine attributes when he took on human nature. Furthermore, Gregory asserted that Christ was fully human, including a full human soul. He also proclaimed the eternality of the Holy Spirit, saying that the Holy Spirit's actions were somewhat hidden in the Old Testament but much clearer since the ascension of Jesus into Heaven and the descent of the Holy Spirit at the feast of Pentecost.|$|E
25|$|In Islam, Jesus is {{believed}} to have been the precursor to Muhammad, attributing the name Ahmad to someone who would follow Jesus. Islam traditionally teaches the rejection of Jesus' divinity, that Jesus was not God incarnate, nor the Son of God, and—according to some interpretations of the Quran—the crucifixion, death, resurrection, and ascension is widely denied and not believed to have occurred. Despite the earliest Muslim traditions and exegesis quoting somewhat conflicting reports regarding death and length of death, the mainstream Muslim belief is that <b>Jesus</b> <b>did</b> not physically die, but was instead raised alive to heaven.|$|E
25|$|Most {{scholars}} in the third quest for the historical Jesus consider the crucifixion indisputable, as do Bart Ehrman, John Dominic Crossan and James Dunn. Although scholars agree on the historicity of the crucifixion, they differ on the reason and context for it, e.g. both E. P. Sanders and Paula Fredriksen support the historicity of the crucifixion, but contend that <b>Jesus</b> <b>did</b> not foretell his own crucifixion, and that his prediction of the crucifixion is a Christian story. Geza Vermes also views the crucifixion as a historical event but believes {{this was due to}} Jesus’ challenging of Roman authority.|$|E

25|$|As the Gospel {{accounts}} are generally held {{to have been}} composed in the period immediately following the revolt of 66-73, {{it has been suggested}} that Christians had to refashion their theological and apocalyptic claims given that <b>Jesus</b> <b>did</b> not immediately return to restore the Jewish kingdom. Moreover, as Christianity emerged as a new religion seeking converts among the gentiles, and eventually as the religion of the emperor himself, it needed to assure both Roman authorities and prospective Gentile audiences that it neither threatened nor challenged imperial sovereignty. Some historians have argued that these two conditions played a crucial role in the revision of accounts of Jesus' life and teachings into the form they ultimately took in the Gospels.|$|E
25|$|Hundreds {{of years}} before the time of Jesus, Jewish prophets promised that a messiah would come. Judaism claims that <b>Jesus</b> <b>did</b> not fulfill these prophecies. Other skeptics usually claim that the prophecies are either vague or unfulfilled, or that the Old Testament {{writings}} influenced the composition of New Testament narratives. Christian apologists claim that Jesus fulfilled these prophecies, which they argue are nearly impossible to fulfill by chance. Many Christians anticipate the Second Coming of Jesus, when he will fulfill the rest of Messianic prophecy, such as the Last Judgment, the general resurrection, establishment of the Kingdom of God, and the Messianic Age (see the article on Preterism for contrasting Christian views).|$|E
25|$|The historicity and {{origin of}} the Resurrection of Jesus {{has been the subject}} of {{historical}} research and debate, as well as a topic of discussion among theologians. The accounts of the Gospels, including the empty tomb and the appearances of the risen Jesus to his followers, have been interpreted and analyzed in diverse ways, and have been seen variously as historical accounts of a literal event, as accurate accounts of visionary experiences, as non-literal eschatological parables, and as fabrications of early Christian writers, among various other interpretations. It has been suggested, for example, that <b>Jesus</b> <b>did</b> not die on the cross, that the empty tomb was the result of Jesus' body having been stolen, or, as was common with Roman crucifixions, that Jesus was never entombed.|$|E
