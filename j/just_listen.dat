500|$|Bill Szymczyk's has {{frequently}} been noted as {{the sort of}} producer who pushes bands to expand their musical horizons; he has been brought in with the specific intent of changing a band's sound. He himself has credited this tendency to his lack of musical knowledge, stating: [...] "I'm a professional listener. I listen and I react. I never was a musician, so I don't bring any preconceived prejudices to the table; I don't favour the guitar over the keyboard, and so forth. I <b>just</b> <b>listen</b> {{and try to figure}} out if I have anything I can bring to a song." ...|$|E

500|$|During {{his first}} game for the Cubs, Banks {{received}} a visit from Jackie Robinson that influenced his quiet presence in baseball. Robinson told Banks, [...] "Ernie, I'm glad to see you're up here so now <b>just</b> <b>listen</b> and learn...For years, I didn't talk and {{learned a lot about}} people". Later, when Banks felt like becoming more vocal, he discussed the issue with teammate Billy Williams, who advised him to remain quiet. Williams drew the analogy of fish that are caught once they open their mouths. Banks said, [...] "I kept my mouth shut but tried to make a difference. My whole life, I've just wanted to make people better".|$|E
500|$|Britten's fellow-composers had divided {{views about}} him. To Tippett he was [...] "simply the most musical person I have ever met", with an [...] "incredible" [...] {{technical}} mastery; some contemporaries, however, were less effusive. In Tippett's view Walton {{and others were}} convinced that Britten and Pears were leaders of a homosexual conspiracy in music, a belief Tippett dismisses as ridiculous, inspired by jealousy at Britten's postwar successes. Leonard Bernstein considered Britten [...] "a man {{at odds with the}} world", and said of his music: [...] "f you hear it, not <b>just</b> <b>listen</b> to it superficially, you become aware of something very dark". The tenor Robert Tear, who was closely associated with Britten {{in the latter part of}} the composer's career, made a similar point: [...] "There was a great, huge abyss in his soul... He got into the valley of the shadow of death and couldn't get out".|$|E
500|$|The {{voice of}} SpongeBob was {{originally}} used by Kenny for a minor background character in Rocko's Modern Life. Kenny forgot the voice initially as he created it only for that single use. Hillenburg, however, remembered {{it when he}} was coming up with SpongeBob and used a video clip of the episode to remind Kenny of the voice. When Hillenburg heard Kenny do the voice, he said, [...] "That's it—I don't want to hear anybody else do the voice. We've got SpongeBob." [...] He said that to Nickelodeon; however, the network said, [...] "Well, let's <b>just</b> <b>listen</b> to 100 more people." [...] Kenny said, [...] "But {{one of the advantages of}} having a strong creator is that the creator can say, 'No, I like that—I don't care about celebrities.'" [...] Kenny says that SpongeBob's high pitched laugh was specifically aimed at being unique, stating that they wanted an annoying laugh in the tradition of Popeye and Woody Woodpecker.|$|E

500|$|Simon {{assembled}} {{and led the}} initial team of writers, consisting of John Swartzwelder, Jon Vitti, George Meyer, Jeff Martin, Al Jean, Mike Reiss, Jay Kogen and Wallace Wolodarsky. Simon has been credited as [...] "developing [...] sensibility". Ken Levine says he [...] "brought a level of honesty to the characters" [...] and made them [...] "three-dimensional", adding that Simon's [...] "comedy is all about character, not just a string of gags. In The Simpsons, the characters are motivated by their emotions and their foibles. 'What are they thinking?'—that is Sam's contribution. The stories come from the characters." [...] Simon saw The Simpsons {{as a chance to}} solve [...] "what [...] didn't like about the Saturday-morning cartoon shows [...] worked on... wanted all the actors in a room together, not reading their lines separated from each other. The Simpsons would have been a great radio show. If you <b>just</b> <b>listen</b> to the sound track, it works." [...] The music for all 13 episodes was composed by former Oingo Boingo member Richard Gibbs, who would depart the show {{at the end of the}} season.|$|E
500|$|For {{most of the}} film, Berry's character, Turner, the 9-1-1 operator, does {{stay inside}} [...] "the hive" [...] before {{becoming}} {{actively involved in the}} search for Breslin's character, Welson, the kidnapped caller. D'Ovidio chose two female leads, explaining, [...] "I wanted strong women... I think it was appropriate here, since most 911 call operators are women." [...] Berry remarked, [...] "I love the idea of being a part of a movie that was so empowering for women. We don't often get to play roles like this, where ordinary people become heroic and do something extraordinary." [...] D'Ovidio chose to tell the story from the perspective of two characters—the operator and the caller—believing that it would become repetitive if it focused on only one. As a result, he switched perspectives every ten pages when writing the screenplay. As well as collaborating on the story with his wife, Nicole and Jon Bokenkamp, he accepted suggestions from Berry, Breslin and Eklund: [...] "Halle came in with some great notes and Abigail and Michael and it started to flesh things out. I'm not one to say 'no' to a great suggested line of dialogue. It just makes me look better as a writer! I feel it's a very collaborative process, and some of the happiest accidents happen when you <b>just</b> <b>listen</b> to people. When someone comes up to you and says, 'Why don't we do it this way?' I think that it's important to listen." ...|$|E
500|$|Nine demos were {{recorded}} at The Mill studio in September 2003 by Paul McCartney and his touring band. A month later, in October, album sessions for Memory Almost Full began, and were produced by David Kahne and recorded at Abbey Road Studios. McCartney {{and the band}} recorded the songs [...] "You Tell Me", [...] "Only Mama Knows", [...] "Vintage Clothes", [...] "That Was Me", [...] "Feet in the Clouds", [...] "House of Wax", [...] "The End of the End", and [...] "Whole Life". However, the sessions were cut short and put on hiatus when McCartney started another album, Chaos and Creation in the Backyard, with producer Nigel Godrich. In the website constructed for the album, McCartney stated: [...] "I actually started this album, Memory Almost Full, before my last album Chaos and Creation in the Backyard, released September 2005. (...) When I was just finishing up everything concerned with Chaos and had just got the Grammy nominations (2006) I realised I had this album {{to go back to}} and finish off. So I got it out to listen to it again, wondering if I would enjoy it, but actually I really loved it. All I did at first was <b>just</b> <b>listen</b> to a couple of things and then I began to think, 'OK, I like that track– now, what is wrong with it?' And it might be something like a drum sound, so then I would re-drum and see where we would get to. (...) In places it's a very personal record {{and a lot of it}} is retrospective, drawing from memory, like memories from being a kid, from Liverpool and from summers gone. The album is evocative, emotional, rocking, but I can't really sum it up in one sentence".|$|E

500|$|Simon {{has been}} {{credited}} with [...] "developing [...] sensibility". Former Simpsons director Brad Bird has described him as [...] "the unsung hero" [...] of the show, while Vitti has stated to [...] "leave out Sam Simon" [...] is to tell [...] "the managed version" [...] of The Simpsons history, because [...] "he was the guy we wrote for." [...] Writer Ken Levine called Simon [...] "the real creative force behind The Simpsons...The tone, the storytelling, the level of humor – that was all developed on Sam's watch." [...] Levine says that Simon [...] "brought a level of honesty to the characters" [...] and made them [...] "three-dimensional", adding that his [...] "comedy is all about character, not just a string of gags. In The Simpsons, the characters are motivated by their emotions and their foibles. 'What are they thinking?'—that is Sam's contribution. The stories come from the characters." [...] Simon crafted {{much of the world}} of Springfield and designed the models for many of the show's recurring characters, including Mr. Burns, Dr. Hibbert, Chief Wiggum and Eddie and Lou, as well as many of the one-time and guest star roles, such as Bleeding Gums Murphy. One of his contributions to the show's character development was his proposal that Waylon Smithers should be gay, but that this should never have too much attention drawn to it; Smithers' sexuality became one of the show's longest-running gags. [...] Simon saw The Simpsons as a chance to solve [...] "what [...] didn't like about the Saturday-morning cartoon shows [...] worked on... wanted all the actors in a room together, not reading their lines separated from each other. The Simpsons would have been a great radio show. If you <b>just</b> <b>listen</b> to the sound track, it works." ...|$|E

2500|$|During Richland's argument, {{the justices}} inquired closely about the city's {{contention}} that Quon had no reasonable expectation of privacy over his text messages. Justice Sotomayor asked Richland about a hypothetical {{scenario in which}} a sergeant knew that various officers engaged in sexually explicit texting with romantic partners and decided {{to look at the}} transcripts out of sheer salacity. [...] "Does that officer have any expectation of privacy that his boss won't <b>just</b> <b>listen</b> in out of prurient interest?" [...] Richland answered that the motive of the examiner should not affect a privacy expectation. [...] "hen the filthy-minded police chief listens in, it's a very bad thing, but it's not—it's not offending your right of privacy," [...] concluded Justice Antonin Scalia.|$|E
2500|$|After {{the release}} date announcement, Gambino stated {{he was upset}} since Glassnote Records wanted to push back its release to 2014, which he said was because [...] "it's not a holiday record and I'm not a big artist". He responded to this, saying: [...] "If it wasn't gonna be {{released}} then, I was gonna release it myself. What's the point of waiting? I feel like that's the only time people {{would be able to}} listen to it. December is the perfect time. Albums made a really big impact on me when I was alone and everything was quiet, and I know that's when students go home, that's when everything is closed, so it's a good time to <b>just</b> <b>listen</b> to something and be yourself."

Ultimately, for all its naked ambition, [...] "Advocate" [...] ends up proving that without the guiding hand of Dre, Game can ... sound like Dre. <b>Just</b> <b>listen</b> to him, he’ll tell you. But without that ability to hammer out his own identity, the Game is still in progress." [...] Stylus Magazine stated [...] "Despite the fact that Dre {{had nothing to do}} with this project, the album sounds just as big-budget and lavishly appointed as The Documentary. Like his mentor, Game knows how to tweak the bone-rattling clap of the snare and play up the percussive aspect of keyboards." ...|$|E

2500|$|Armageddon and its singles have {{received}} a number of positive reviews. Jamie Horne, music journalist for the Border Mail gave the album {{four and a half}} out of five stars, saying, [...] "Armageddon truly is mature pop. But do not fear — it's not adult contemporary and, more importantly, it's nothing like the club pop that's been diseasing our charts. It is late, however, having been penciled in for a mid-year release. But that's also forgiven early with the opening duo, Amnesia and Beg, the latter a swirling mid-tempo effort destined to be a live favourite." [...] Cameron Adams from the Herald Sun wrote, [...] "You've heard Guy's best single to date in Battle Scars; now welcome to his best album. His songwriting has matured as he's left the club behind to focus on the real world. Amnesia and Beg are classy, dramatic adult pop songs that showcase his voice." [...] Adams said [...] "Get Along" [...] was [...] "inspired", and showed new depth from Sebastian. Take 40, said, [...] "Brilliant work Guy! We know {{this is going to be}} a success, and will hopefully give you some ARIA nods this time next year." [...] They called the title track [...] "Armageddon" [...] an [...] "uplifting anthem", and said [...] "Get Along" [...] showed [...] "the beautiful timbre of his voice, and has a very inspiring message". Jessica Tisdell from music site Novastreamusic wrote, [...] "Sebastian's latest album Armageddon (2012) demonstrates the great growth as an artist that he has achieved over the years of dedication to his career. [...] Armageddon is one of those albums that you <b>just</b> <b>listen</b> to easily and does not have one bad track."
