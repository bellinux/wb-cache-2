Then, Jeter became the all-time hits leader as a member of the Yankees (2,722), passing Lou Gehrig on September 11, 2009. The hit was a single off Baltimore Orioles pitcher Chris Tillman in the third inning.|$|E

5|$|While heparin was {{introduced}} {{for clinical use}} in the late 1930s, new thrombosis in people treated with heparin was not described until 1957, when vascular surgeons reported the association. The fact that this phenomenon occurred together with thrombocytopenia was reported in 1969; prior to this time, platelet counts were not routinely performed. A 1973 report established <b>HIT</b> <b>as</b> a diagnosis, as well as suggesting that its features {{were the result of}} an immune process.|$|E
5|$|After {{the game}} resumed, Labine scored on {{back-to-back}} singles by Reese and Snider. The Giants then {{came up to}} bat, failing to earn a <b>hit</b> <b>as</b> the score became 6–0 after six innings. To start the seventh inning, Al Corwin replaced Bill Rigney for the Giants, who had pinch hit for Spencer. Andy Pafko {{hit a home run}} to start the inning, and Hodges walked; he later scored on the fifth and final error made by the Giants to make the score 8–0. The bottom of the seventh and the eighth inning passed without a hit. In the ninth inning, Walker hit a home run, the fourth of the game, to make the score 10–0. The Giants failed to get a hit {{in the bottom of the}} ninth, ending the game. Labine pitched a six-hit shutout, not allowing a hit in the final four innings as the series went to a deciding third game.|$|E
5|$|Despite {{being located}} in remote Scapa Flow, Battleship Division Nine {{was unable to}} avoid a global killer that struck just as World War I was coming to a close. Spanish Influenza—which killed {{millions}} worldwide in 1918–1919—did not spare the Grand Fleet. By late fall, an average of seven men per day were dying of the virus throughout the Fleet, and some ships were so badly affected that they were practically unmanageable. Though they were not as badly <b>hit</b> <b>as</b> some of the British vessels, the American battleships were not immune. By early November, only Florida was not in quarantine, and Arkansas had 259 cases, with 11 deaths.|$|E

5|$|Immediately after {{completing}} The Road to Glory, Hawks began writing his next film, Fig Leaves, his first (and, until 1935, only) comedy. The film portrays {{a married couple}} by juxtaposing them in the Garden of Eden and in modern New York City. The Garden of Eden humorously depicts Adam and Eve awoken by a Flintstones-like coconut alarm clock and Adam reading the morning news on giant stone tablets. In the modern day, the biblical serpent is replaced by Eve's gossiping neighbor and Eve becomes a sexy flapper and fashion model when Adam is at work. The film starred George O'Brien as Adam and Olive Borden as Eve and received positive reviews, particularly for the art direction and costume designs. It was released in July 1926 and was Hawks's first <b>hit</b> <b>as</b> a director. Although he mainly dismissed his early work, Hawks praised this film in later interviews.|$|E
5|$|Modern Sounds in Country and Western Music {{became one}} of the best-selling albums {{recorded}} by a black musician of the time, as well as one of the best-selling country albums, shipping at least 500,000 copies in its first three months of release. This achievement was {{due in part to the}} mainstream promotional efforts Modern Sounds had received from ABC prior to and following release. The album proved to be a crossover <b>hit</b> <b>as</b> well, as distributors claimed the record had been selling in pop, R and country music markets; at the time, often referred to as white and black markets during the period.|$|E
5|$|The Australians {{travelled}} to London to play Surrey at The Oval. Tallon came in {{with the}} score at 6/553, and held up his end, scoring an unbeaten 50 as his partners steadily fell and Australia were bowled out at 632. Tallon had some difficulty in English conditions as he sustained a bruised right finger when he lost sight of a Ray Lindwall bouncer on a misty morning during the match and was <b>hit</b> <b>as</b> he put hand over his face for protection, with the ball running away for four byes. Tallon took two catches in the second innings as Australia won the match by an innings, but he also conceded 24 byes in Surrey's match total of 336.|$|E

5|$|The State Farm Home Run Derby {{was held}} {{the night before}} the All-Star Game, July 9, and {{broadcast}} on ESPN. Four players from each league competed to <b>hit</b> <b>as</b> many home runs as they could in each round to advance and eventually win the contest. This year, a five-swing swing-off would be used to break ties occurring in any round. This became necessary when Albert Pujols and Justin Morneau tied for fourth in the first round. The champion of last year's Derby, Ryan Howard of the Philadelphia Phillies, competed even though he was not named to the NL All-Star roster.|$|E
5|$|During {{the first}} month of the 2009–10 season, Booth {{sustained}} a concussion after being hit by Philadelphia Flyers forward Mike Richards during a game on October 24, 2009. Skating up to the Flyers' blueline, Booth had shot the puck into the offensive zone when Richards hit him in the head with his shoulder. Rendered unconscious, Booth was taken off the ice on a stretcher and brought to a Philadelphia hospital. In addition to his concussion, he sustained a cut above one eye that required stitches; he was released from hospital the next day. While Richards received a five-minute major penalty for interference and a game misconduct for intent to injure, he was not suspended for the play. The decision not to further penalize Richards proved to be a highly contentious issue. Panthers General Manager Randy Sexton and defenceman Keith Ballard voiced their opinion that Richards' hit was directed at the head while knowing Booth was in a vulnerable position, warranting a suspension. The Flyers captain expressed concern for Booth's health both in the media and to Panthers Head Coach Peter DeBoer personally, but asserted that he was not intending to hurt him. Another concern was the timing of Richards' <b>hit,</b> <b>as</b> Booth had already released the puck. In response, NHL Vice President Bill Daly explained that the hit was not late enough to justify a suspension.|$|E
5|$|During {{the second}} game of the season, Davis hit his 200th career home run in an Orioles uniform, making him the eighth Oriole in {{franchise}} history to do so. On May 16, {{in a game against}} the Tigers, Davis went 3-5 with three runs scored, four RBIs, two walks, a double and two home runs, including the game winning home run in the 13th inning of the 13-11 victory. Davis became just the 2nd player in MLB history to hit two home runs in the 12th inning or later of a game, joining Matt Adams of the Cardinals. Davis also became the first Orioles player with multiple extra-inning home runs during a single game since Mike Young on May 28, 1987. His four RBIs also moved him past former teammate Brian Roberts for 21st all-time in franchise history. On May 18, Davis hit his 250th career home run (208th as an Oriole). He became the 221st player in MLB history to reach 250 career home runs. He also collected his 738th career <b>hit</b> <b>as</b> an Oriole, moving him into 50th all-time in franchise history. On May 24, he tied Brady Anderson for 7th in franchise history with his 209th career home run as an Oriole.|$|E

5|$|The first main {{match was}} for the WWE Championship, in which {{champion}} Rob Van Dam defended the title against Edge accompanied with Lita. In {{the beginning of the}} match, Edge performed a sunset flip powerbomb on Van Dam outside the ring. Van Dam, however, managed to execute a crossbody on Edge inside the ring, resulting in the two landing {{on the outside of the}} ring floor. Both men took the upper hand in the match, until Van Dam was scripted to knock the referee unconscious. Edge took advantage, as Lita gave him the title. Edge tried to hit Van Dam with the title, but Van Dam dodged the <b>hit</b> <b>as</b> he performed a spinning kick on the title, resulting in hitting Edge's face. Edge, however, got the advantage as he attempted to perform a shoulder block takedown on Van Dam, while Lita propped a chair on a ring corner. Edge went for the shoulder block takedown, but Van Dam moved out of the way, resulting in Edge to crash head-first onto the chair. Capitalizing on the situation, Van Dam then performed a body splash from the top turnbuckle on Edge, which he followed with a cover and a pinfall, thus retaining the WWE Championship.|$|E
5|$|All fifteen Hamilcars which {{participated in}} the first lift on 17 September arrived over the landing zones safely, but {{problems}} were experienced {{when they came in}} to land. Two of the gliders landed on soft ground, which caused them to rapidly decelerate; this, combined with the majority of their equipment being {{in the front of the}} gliders, resulted in them flipping onto their backs. Three of the pilots were killed and the fourth was badly wounded and later taken prisoner, and several passengers were wounded; the 17-pounder anti-tank guns on board the gliders were damaged beyond repair. The rest of the Hamilcars landed successfully, although one overran the landing zone and hit a railway embankment; this damaged the two Universal Carriers being carried by the glider, although both were later salvaged. The lift on 18 September was delayed for several hours due to poor weather conditions, and the glider force did not take off until approximately 11:00. En route to the landing zones, one Hamilcar was forced to cast off and land at an airfield in England after its tow aircraft developed engine trouble, and another ditched in the English Channel when its tug developed engine troubles as well; both had been carrying 17-pounder anti-tank guns. The rest of the Hamilcars encountered heavy anti-aircraft fire as they landed, with several being <b>hit.</b> <b>As</b> a result, one Hamilcar landed short of the landing zone after being hit in the wing, and another was forced to make an emergency landing far from the landing zone after being hit; the stores, pilots and passengers were captured by German forces shortly after the glider landed. The rest of the Hamilcars landed successfully. The third lift on 19 September did not take place due to weather problems, and because several of 1st Airborne Division's landing zones had been overrun. Finally on 21 September the weather cleared, but due to 1st Airborne Division's deteriorating situation it was decided that the 878th Aviation Engineer Battalion would not be delivered. As such, only a single Hamilcar accompanied 1st Polish Independent Parachute Brigade when it set off for its drop near the town of Driel; this was the same Hamilcar which had been forced to land in England on 19 September when its tug had experienced engine trouble. However, the tow rope between the glider and tug snapped over Belgium, and it was forced to land near Ghent.|$|E
