5|$|Captain Merrill T. Kinnecommander of the Port Chicago {{facility}} {{at the time}} of the explosionhad served in the Navy from 1915 to 1922 and had returned to the Navy from civilian life in 1941 to be posted aboard a general cargo ship. Prior to his being sent to command Port Chicago, Kinne had no training in the loading of munitions and very little experience <b>in</b> <b>handling</b> them. White loading officers serving underneath Kinne had not been trained in supervising enlisted personnel or <b>in</b> <b>handling</b> munitions until they had been posted to Mare Island Navy Yard, after which they were considered adequate to the task by the Navy.|$|E
5|$|Although railroads {{have lost}} much of the general-freight-carrying {{business}} to semi-trailer trucks, they remain the best means of transporting large volumes of such bulk commodities as coal, grain, chemicals, and ore over long distances. The development of containerization has made the railroads more effective <b>in</b> <b>handling</b> finished merchandise at relatively high speeds. In addition, the introduction of piggyback flatcars, in which truck trailers are transported long distances on specially-designed cars, has allowed railroads to regain some of the business lost to trucking.|$|E

5|$|Despite the {{rejection}} of Taylor's constitutional position, the Court did create the framework for a balancing test for lower courts to use <b>in</b> <b>handling</b> future discovery preclusion questions. A trial court must balance the defendant's interest in a robust defense with the (i) state's interest in 'efficient' justice, (ii) state's interest in excluding evidence lacking integrity, (iii) state's interest in a strong judicial authority with followed rules, and (iv) the prosecution interest in avoiding prejudice due to a defendant's discovery violation.|$|E
5|$|Harry confronts monsters in {{each area}} with both melee weapons and firearms. An {{ordinary}} man, Harry cannot sustain many blows from enemies, and gasps for breath after sprinting. His inexperience <b>in</b> <b>handling</b> firearms means that his aim, and therefore the player's targeting of enemies, is often unsteady. A portable radio collected {{early in the game}} alerts Harry to the presence of nearby creatures with bursts of static.|$|E
5|$|In April 1956, Marshall led a {{delegation}} to London to negotiate for complete self-rule in the Merdeka Talks, but the talks failed when the British {{were reluctant to}} give up control over Singapore's internal security. The British were concerned about communist influence and labour strikes which were undermining Singapore's economic stability, and felt that the local government was ineffective <b>in</b> <b>handling</b> earlier riots. Marshall resigned following {{the failure of the}} talk.|$|E

5|$|Neptunium {{reacts with}} {{hydrogen}} {{in a similar}} manner to its neighbor plutonium, forming the hydrides NpH2+x (face-centered cubic) and NpH3 (hexagonal). These are isostructural with the corresponding plutonium hydrides, although unlike PuH2+x, the lattice parameters of NpH2+x become greater as the hydrogen content (x) increases. The hydrides require extreme care <b>in</b> <b>handling</b> as they decompose in a vacuum at 300°C to form finely divided neptunium metal, which is pyrophoric.|$|E
5|$|On February 29, 2016, The Northwest Seaport Alliance {{invited the}} CMA CGM Benjamin Franklin, the largest cargo ship {{to visit the}} United States, to dock at the Port of Seattle's Terminal 18. The move {{was used to test}} the terminal's {{capabilities}} <b>in</b> <b>handling</b> a ship of that size (in the range of 18,000 twenty-foot equivalent units, or TEUs) and promote expansion of Terminal 5 into a facility to handle larger ships. In April 2016, the alliance approved $141 million in funding to upgrade piers and cranes at the Port of Tacoma's Husky Terminal.|$|E
5|$|The pelagic {{stingray}} is not aggressive and rarely encountered {{because of its}} habitat preferences, but its very long tail spine demands extreme caution be exercised <b>in</b> <b>handling</b> it.

5|$|Two large famines {{occurred}} in Madras during this period, the Great Famine of 1876–78 and the Indian famine of 1896–97. As a result, {{the population of}} the Presidency fell for the first time from 31.2 million in 1871 to 30.8 million in 1881. These famines and alleged partiality shown by the government <b>in</b> <b>handling</b> the Chingleput Ryots' Case and the Salem riots trial caused discontent among the population.|$|E
5|$|By 1910, the Regia Marina {{had decided}} {{to dispose of the}} {{obsolescent}} cruiser. Rumors that year of a potential sale to the Ecuadorian Navy prompted Peru to buy the old French cruiser , though Ecuador did not end up purchasing Umbria. Instead, in December 1910, the Regia Marina sold Umbria to the Haitian Navy, but she did not arrive in Port-de-Paix, Haiti, until 13 June 1911. After the sale, the ship was renamed Consul Gostrück. The ship was rumored to be carrying Cipriano Castro, the deposed president of Venezuela, though they later proved to be false. A German captain, Willy Meyer, was hired to take command of the ship upon its arrival in Haiti, but due to the lengthy delays, he quit. The cruiser sank shortly after entering service because her crew was not experienced <b>in</b> <b>handling</b> the ship. Umbria was eventually raised and towed to Rotterdam, the Netherlands, for disposal in 1913.|$|E
5|$|Miri Port Authority (MPA) was {{established}} on 1 February 1981 and commenced operation on 1 March 1983. It is {{located near the}} mouth of Baram River. The port is able to take in ships measuring up to 1,500 GRT (Gross Register Tonnage), with general cargo area of 50,895 m2 and total developed area of 34 hectares (0.34km2). It is mainly used <b>in</b> <b>handling</b> petroleum, timber products, coal, and building materials. A total of 23.94 million metric tonnes of goods was handled by MPA from 2011 to 2013, which earned a total revenue of RM 48.58 million in port dues.|$|E

5|$|The {{accident}} {{has since}} become {{a prime example of}} successful crew resource management. For much of aviation's history, the captain was considered the final authority, and crews were to respect the captain's expertise and not question him. This began to change in the 1970s, especially after the Tenerife airport disaster. Crew Resource Management, while still considering the captain the final authority, instructs crewmembers to speak up when they detect a problem, and instructs captains to listen to their concerns. United Airlines instituted a Crew Resource Management class in the early 1980s. The NTSB would later credit this training as valuable toward the success of United 232's crew <b>in</b> <b>handling</b> their emergency. The FAA made Crew Resource Training mandatory {{in the aftermath of the}} accident.|$|E
5|$|The early {{nuclear weapons}} were large, complex and cumbersome. They were stored as {{components}} rather than complete devices and required expert knowledge to assemble. The short {{life of their}} lead-acid batteries and modulated neutron initiators, and the heat generated by the fissile cores, precluded storing them assembled. The large quantity of conventional explosive in each weapon demanded special care be taken <b>in</b> <b>handling.</b> Groves hand-picked a team of regular Army officers, who were trained in the assembly and handling of the weapons. They in turn trained the enlisted soldiers, and the Army teams then trained teams from the Navy and Air Force.|$|E
5|$|The {{operation}} did {{not give}} the Allies any tactical or strategic advantage; Howard notes that it provided experience for the planners <b>in</b> <b>handling</b> deception and for the Twenty Committee in proving the worth of double agents. Terry Crowdy, writing in 2008, argued that any experience that the LCS attained was limited {{by the lack of}} guidance from Cairo and knowledge of double agents. Dudley Clarke had already shown that the most effective method of deception involved the use of agents and faked wireless traffic, rather than major training and troop movements. Hardboiled was the first deception plan aimed at Norway. It led into several others, including Operation Tindall and Operation Solo, culminating in the 1944 Operation Fortitude North, one of the Allies' largest and most successful deceptions.|$|E

5|$|Wipeout Pure is {{a racing}} game {{which is set}} in the year 2197, exactly 100 years after the events of Wipeout 2097, and {{revolves}} around players competing in the FX300 anti-gravity racing league. Players control anti-gravity ships which are owned racing corporations (effectively referred to as 'teams' in-game). There are a total of eight teams featured in the game, with one ship available for each. Every ship has different characteristics, for example each ship has variations <b>in</b> <b>handling,</b> thrust, maximum speed and shield strength. Each craft is equipped with an energy shield which absorbs damage sustained during a race; energy is lost whenever the player's ship collides or is hit by weapons fire. If the shield runs out, the player's ship will explode and is consequently eliminated from the race. However, the player may replenish energy by absorbing weapon pick-ups.|$|E
5|$|Adams {{did work}} for {{publishers}} other than Marvel during the 1980s, {{as when he}} drew several pages of Batman #400 in 1986 and Action Comics Annual #1 in 1987. The latter {{is viewed as a}} turning point in Adam's drawing style, characterized by bulkier figures of Batman and Superman, though Adams explains that this was in part due to the influence of The Dark Knight Returns, and that the overall change in art was style partly due to deliberate experimentation on his part, and partly to Dick Giordano's inking, which exhibited a different line weight. That same year, he illustrated Gumby Summer Fun Special #1 by Comico Comics, a job he obtained through Comico editor Diana Schutz, an old friend who noticed the incidental images of Gumby that Adams had included in the pages of Longshot. Adams, who did not harbor fond memories of that cartoon as a child, and who feared he would be typecast as a Gumby artist if he took the job, told Schultz he would only do it if she could get Bob Burden to write it, on the assumption that Schultz would decline this condition. Schultz, who initially wanted Mark Evanier for the job, considered this, and eventually agreed to it after contacting Burden, who was enthusiastic about the idea. That book, which demonstrated Adams' versatility <b>in</b> <b>handling</b> comedy as well as superheroics, garnered him and Burden a 1988 Eisner Award for Best Single Issue. Adams would later illustrate a second Gumby book, Gumby's Winter Fun Special, which was written by Steve Purcell.|$|E
5|$|Bessières and Nansouty led {{these men}} forward, through {{a hail of}} cannonballs and case-shot, with the carabiniers-à-cheval at the front. Finding a weaker spot in the Austrian line, they pierced it and stormed past the enemy {{infantry}} formed in squares, sabering the Georger Grenzer battalion as they went along their way. However, many of the French cavalry did not manage to penetrate through the formidable masses of Austrian infantry, so Nansouty was now commanding a much diminished force. Showing great skill <b>in</b> <b>handling</b> his men, Nansouty then wheeled right and charged Liechtenstein's artillery line. However, the Austrian cavalry promptly intervened, spearheaded by the Rosenberg chevaulegers and the Kronprinz cuirassier regiments, which caught the carabiniers-à-cheval in flank and repulsed them, pursuing {{them back to their}} lines. The costly repulse of Nansouty's division did not dishearten Bessières, who was preparing another rapid charge, now with the support of elements of the Guard cavalry. This charge never came, as the Marshal's horse was killed by a cannonball, with Bessières also hit and carried unconscious behind the lines. With his commander presumed dead, Nansouty did not know what the Emperor's orders were and thus promptly decided to pull back his men, to avoid further damage to his already battered division.|$|E
