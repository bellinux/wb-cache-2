Furthermore, the change of the permeability coefficient with pH correlated well with the distribution coefficient by a 2 -degree polynomial equation.

However, the physicochemical properties of dapsone {{make it difficult to}} incorporate into conventional formulations. The current study was directed toward developing a stable nanoemulsion that contains dapsone which can be adapted for topical use. Methods: Nanoemulsions were prepared using <b>isopropyl</b> <b>myristate</b> or n-methyl-pyrrolidone as the oil phase, and characterized according to their mean droplet size, conductivity, refractive index, pH, drug content, and stability. The in vitro release of dapsone and its ability to permeate the epidermis were also evaluated. Results: Physicochemical characterization demonstrated that nanosystems were formed, which had a uniform droplet distribution and a pH compatible with the skin surface. Use of n-methyl-pyrrolidone provided a greater nanoemulsion region and higher solubilization of dapsone, and increased the in vitro release rate when compared with a nanoemulsion prepared using <b>isopropyl</b> <b>myristate.</b> However, use of <b>isopropyl</b> <b>myristate</b> promoted an increase in in vitro epidermal permeation that followed the Higuchi model. This demonstrates the ability of a nanosystem to influence permeation of dapsone through the skin barrier. Furthermore, the nanoemulsions developed and evaluated here had ideal physicochemical stability over a 3 -month period. Conclusion: Incorporation of dapsone into a nanoemulsion may be a promising system for enabling topical delivery of dapsone, while minimizing skin permeation, for the treatment of acne.

40|$|The {{interactions}} of two oil droplets {{grown in the}} presence of swollen, lightly cross-linked cationic poly(tert-butylamino) ethyl methacrylate (PTBAEMA) microgels was monitored using a high-speed video camera. Three oils (n-dodecane, <b>isopropyl</b> <b>myristate</b> and sunflower oil) were investigated, each in the absence and presence of an oil-soluble cross-linker [tolylene 2, 4 -diisocyanate-terminated poly(propylene glycol), PPG-TDI]. Adsorption of the swollen microgel particles was confirmed by interfacial tension, interfacial elasticity and dilational viscosity measurements on single pendant oil droplets, and assessment of the oscillatory dynamics for coalescing droplet pairs. Like the analogous bulk emulsions, particle adsorption alone did not prevent coalescence of pairs of giant Pickering emulsion droplets. However, prior addition of surface-active PPG-TDI cross-linker to the oil phase results in the formation of highly stable microgel colloidosomes via reaction with the secondary amine groups on the PTBAEMA chains. Colloidosome stability depended on the age of the oil-water interface. This reflects a balance between the adsorption kinetics of the PPG-TDI cross-linker and the microgel particles, each of which must be present at the interface to form a stable colloidosome. Colloidosome formation was virtually instantaneous in n-dodecane, but took up to 120 s in the case of <b>isopropyl</b> <b>myristate.</b> The impact of an acid-induced latex-to-microgel transition on the interaction of giant colloidosomes (originally prepared at pH 10 using <b>isopropyl</b> <b>myristate)</b> was also studied.

40|$|Introduction: The {{development}} of a reliable in vitro permeation system necessitates {{the use of a}} precise and accurate method of quantifying the amount of permeant partitioning from the membrane into the cell receptor phase. Aqueous donor and receptor chamber fluids have been used in the majority of reported investigations, which makes quantitative permeant analysis relatively facile. Alternatively, radiolabelled diffusants have been used and flux rates monitored by scintillation counting, obviating the need for chromatographic separation of the receptor-phase components. However, this technique is not applicable when nonlabelled compounds or commercial dosage forms are to be evaluated by a cell system. Furthermore, several studies indicate that aqueous receptor phases may not present an optimal partitioning environment for certain lipophilic permeants (1 - 4), thereby impairing accurate flux monitoring due to limited diffusant solubility. Several attempts have therefore been made to improve the partitioning environment within these systems, by the addition of surfactants for example (4). A lipophilic receptor environment appears beneficial for corticosteroid partitioning, and thus, the use of <b>isopropyl</b> <b>myristate</b> has been investigated because of its bipolar properties that tend to mimic the biochemical composition of the skin (5, 6).

Effects of different enhancers were evaluated on release and permeation of drugs. F 3 formulations having <b>isopropyl</b> <b>myristate</b> as permeation enhancer, showed maximum amounts of drugs release (88. 11 % of salbutamol sulphate and 88. 33 % of ketotifen fumarate) {{at the end of}} 24 h dissolution study. F 3 also showed maximum permeation of both drugs (4. 235 mg salbutamol sulphate and 1. 057 mg ketotifen fumarate) after 24 h permeation study through rabbit skin mounted in Franz cell. The patches having no enhancer in the formulation also showed some drug release and permeation due to the presence of plasticizer. The results of the study suggested that new controlled release transdermal formulations of combined antiasthmatic drugs can be suitably developed as an alternate to conventional dosage forms...|$|E
40|$|The {{purpose of}} the present study was to {{investigate}} the permeation of glipizide (GP) and observe the effect of an interaction with amines as counter ions, including diethylamine, triethylamine, ethanolamine, diethanolamine, triethanolamine, N-(2 -hydroxylethyl) piperidine. Permeation experiments were performed in vitro, using rat abdominal skin as a barrier. The lipophilic donor system consisting of <b>isopropyl</b> <b>myristate</b> (IPM) and ethanol (EtOH; EI system, 8 : 2) produced a marked enhancement of GP flux through rat skin. All the amines investigated in this study had performed an enhancing effect on GP flux, and triethylamine had the most potent enhancing effect on GP in the vehicle IPM:EtOH[*]=[*] 8 : 2 (w/w). In the presence of counter ions, the solubility of GP in the donor solution (IPM:EtOH[*]=[*] 8 : 2) was increased and the log Ko/w of GP was decreased, which may due to higher solubility of the GP in the IPM:EtOH[*]=[*] 8 : 2 (w/w). 13 C NMR spectroscopy was used to identify the ion-pairing formation between GP and the respective counter ion. It was surprising that all the four enhancers examined, such as <b>isopropyl</b> <b>myristate,</b> propylene glycol, N-methyl- 2 -pyrrolidone, azone, and oleic acid, had no enhancing effect on the percutaneous permeation of GP. This study showed that the formation of ion-pairs between GP and counter ions is a useful method to promote the skin permeation of GP...|$|E
40|$|Diploma Thesis 2006, Eva Režňáková Abstract The {{theoretical}} part gives {{a list of}} selected issues on transdermal drug delivery and summarizes information on Azone, including new technical information published in 2005. In vitro permeation experiments using the excised pig skin confirm the considerable potential for transdermal administration of 7 -methoxytacrine. Using the <b>isopropyl</b> <b>myristate</b> as a vehicle the therapeutically valuable fluxes at about 15 [μg/cm 2. h- 1] were obtained. Transdermal acceleration and impact of 5 % added amounts of methyl pyrrolidone and dodecyl pyrrolidone were not established. As a promising in this respect appears to use Azone and transkarbam 12...|$|E
