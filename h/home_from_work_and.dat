5|$|Homer {{at first}} {{goes to the}} Kwik-E-Mart and {{purchases}} Buzz Cola, then gets into more routine tasks, such as giving Lisa her science project or going to work. At {{the end of the}} day, Homer is sent <b>home</b> <b>from</b> <b>work</b> <b>and</b> watches a news report on TV, which informs him that the mysterious cameras and black vans are being spotted all across town. He notices one of the vans spying on him outside the house, and decides to pursue it, leading him to Mr. Burns' mansion. Homer concludes that Mr. Burns is responsible, and goes to confront him.

5|$|Homer {{stops by}} the Kwik-E-Mart {{on the way}} <b>home</b> <b>from</b> <b>work,</b> <b>and</b> {{witnesses}} a robbery committed by a masked clown, resembling Krusty. He identifies the clown as Krusty to the police, and Krusty is arrested, upsetting Bart, who considers him to be his idol. During his trial the next day, Krusty is revealed to be illiterate. After being called out to the stand, Homer points out Krusty as the robber, and he is {{convicted and sentenced to}} jail. The community then gathers up in a public burning as they burn up all of Krusty's merchandise. Krusty's sidekick Sideshow Bob becomes the new host of his show, making it a more educational program. Still refusing to accept that his hero could have committed the crime, Bart enlists the help of a reluctant Lisa and they set out to prove Krusty's innocence.|$|E

Later, Guadalupe Maldonado's wife called police, {{concerned}} that her husband had not returned <b>home</b> <b>from</b> <b>work</b> <b>and</b> that his car was still in the apparently closed Brown's Chicken parking lot.

25|$|Emmet {{finds himself}} in the human world as a Lego minifigure unable to move. The events of the story are being played out by a little boy named Finn on his father's {{expansive}} Lego set in their basement. His father—"the Man Upstairs"—comes <b>home</b> <b>from</b> <b>work</b> <b>and</b> chastises his son for ruining the set by creating variations of different playsets, and proceeds to permanently rebuild and glue his perceived perfect creations together (causing Lord Business' forces to regain the upper hand as a result). Realizing the danger his friends are in, Emmet wills himself to move and gains Finn's attention. Finn returns Emmet and the Piece of Resistance to the set, where Emmet now possesses the powers of a Master Builder and confronts Business. Meanwhile, Finn's father looks at his son's creations and realizes that Finn had based the villainous Business on him and his perfectionism. Through a speech Emmet gives Business, Finn tells his father that he is special and {{has the power to}} change everything. Finn reconciles with his father, which plays out as Business having a change of heart, capping the Kragle, and ungluing his victims with mineral spirits. Emmet is hailed as a hero, and begins a relationship with Wyldstyle with Batman's blessing.|$|E

Kyle Darren, the caricature of Luke Perry star of Beverly Hills, 90210, appears as well. Mayor Quimby uses the phrase [...] "May the Force be with you" [...] from the Star Wars franchise, confusing it with Nimoy's work on Star Trek (and—at the same time—believing Nimoy to have been [...] "one of The Little Rascals"). Homer's Monorail conductor uniform is based on uniforms from Star Wars. When Mr. Burns is brought into the court room, he is restrained {{in the same way as}} Hannibal Lecter in the film The Silence of the Lambs. Homer briefly serenades Marge in their bedroom with a line from the folk song [...] "The Riddle Song".|$|E

60|$|And {{then there}} stole over him delicious {{thoughts}} of coming <b>home</b> <b>from</b> <b>work,</b> <b>and</b> drawing Hetty to his side, and feeling her cheek softly pressed against his, till he forgot where he was, {{and the music}} and the tread of feet might have been the falling of rain and the roaring of the wind, for what he knew.|$|E
60|$|He {{left the}} house with head erect and the light of battle in his eyes, and, meeting Mr. Ricketts at the corner, gave that justly aggrieved gentleman the {{surprise}} of his life. Elk Street thrilled {{to the fact that}} Mr. Billing had broken out again, and spoke darkly of what the evening might bring forth. Curious eyes followed his progress as he returned <b>home</b> <b>from</b> <b>work,</b> <b>and</b> a little later on the news was spread abroad that he was out and paying off old scores with an ardour that nothing could withstand.|$|E

60|$|We all knew, of course, that Uncle William is the {{greatest}} artist in the world, but no one liked {{to suggest that he}} should sell his pictures for money, a thing that no prince was ever capable of doing.

60|$|There {{were many}} little knots {{and groups of}} persons in Westminster Hall: some few looking upward at its noble ceiling, and at the rays of evening light, tinted by the setting sun, which {{streamed}} in aslant through its small windows, and growing dimmer by degrees, were quenched in the gathering gloom below; some, noisy passengers, mechanics going <b>home</b> <b>from</b> <b>work,</b> <b>and</b> otherwise, who hurried quickly through, waking the echoes with their voices, and soon darkening the small door in the distance, as they passed into the street beyond; some, in busy conference together on political or private matters, pacing slowly {{up and down with}} eyes that sought the ground, and seeming, by their attitudes, to listen earnestly from head to foot. Here, a dozen squabbling urchins made a very Babel in the air; there, a solitary man, half clerk, half mendicant, paced up and down with hungry dejection in his look and gait; at his elbow passed an errand-lad, swinging his basket round and round, and with his shrill whistle riving the very timbers of the roof; while a more observant schoolboy, half-way through, pocketed his ball, and eyed the distant beadle as he came looming on. It was that time of evening when, if you shut your eyes and open them again, the darkness of an hour appears to have gathered in a second. The smooth-worn pavement, dusty with footsteps, still called upon the lofty walls to reiterate the shuffle and the tread of feet unceasingly, save when the closing of some heavy door resounded through the building like a clap of thunder, and drowned all other noises in its rolling sound.|$|E
