5|$|Advancements in {{microscopic}} stamping {{have led}} to a push for the inclusion of firing pin microstamping. The microstamp is etched onto the firing pin and is transferred to the cartridge during the <b>firing</b> <b>process.</b> Each firing pin would have a unique serial number allowing investigators to trace casings found at a crime scene to a known firearm. The practice is not in use , although California has enacted legislation that requires microstamping on all newly sold firearms. The law, and microstamping in general, has received significant opposition from gun manufacturers due to increased costs associated with introducing the microstamps into the manufacturing lines.|$|E

5|$|Spent {{cartridges}} {{found at}} a scene can be examined for physical evidence such as fingerprints or compared to samples that match them to a weapon. The examination of the cartridge relies on the unique tool marks left by the {{various parts of the}} weapon including the firing pin and the ejector in semi and fully automatic firearms. These markings can be compared and matched to known exemplars fired from the same weapon using the same parts. The examination of the marks left on the cartridge is done using a comparison microscope. Examiners view the questioned cartridge and the known exemplar simultaneously, looking for similar microscopic marks left during the <b>firing</b> <b>process.</b>|$|E
40|$|One-dimensional {{model is}} {{fundamental}} to two- or three-dimensional modeling of combustible materials, which can be classified into wood, non-charring polymer, charring polymer and intumescent polymer according to their characteristics. Four <b>fire</b> <b>processes</b> are involved in fire development, such as thermal process, physical process, chemical process and failure process. Consideration of all four <b>fire</b> <b>processes</b> for these combustible materials is significant to modeling accuracy and application fields. Therefore, {{the state of the}} art of one-dimensional modeling describing all four <b>fire</b> <b>processes</b> of woods, non-charring polymers, charring polymers and intumescent polymers under external heat flux was reviewed. A summary of typical considerations in previous one-dimensional models was provided, including heat conduction, pyrolysis, production of gas volatiles, volume change, water evaporation, internal gas pressure, properties of permeability and porosity, and mechanical behaviors. Empirical models and critical data of <b>fire</b> <b>processes</b> were also collected for modeling input.

At each site of Z, a fire starts at rate λ> 0, immediately destroying the whole corresponding connected component of trees. We show that when λ {{is made to}} tend to 0 with an appropriate normalization, the forest <b>fire</b> <b>process</b> tends to a uniquely defined process, the dynamics of which we precisely describe. The normalization consists of accelerating time by a factor (1 /λ) and of compressing space by a factor λ(1 /λ). The limit process is quite simple: it can be built using a graphical construction and can be perfectly simulated.

5|$|Celadon: Named after a pale-tinted spring green colour, Chinese {{archaeologist}} Wang Zhongshu (1982) {{asserts that}} shards having {{this type of}} ceramic glaze have been recovered from Eastern Han Dynasty (25–220 AD) tomb excavations in Zhejiang; he also asserts {{that this type of}} ceramic became well known during the Three Kingdoms (220–265). Richard Dewar (2002) disagrees with Wang's classification, stating that true celadon—which requires a minimum 1260°C (2300°F) furnace temperature, a preferred range of 1285° to 1305°C (2345° to 2381°F), and reduced firing—was not created until the beginning of the Northern Song Dynasty (960–1127). The unique grey or green celadon glaze is a result of iron oxide's transformation from ferric to ferrous iron (Fe2O3 → FeO) during the <b>firing</b> <b>process.</b> Longquan celadon wares, which Nigel Wood (1999) writes were first made during the Northern Song, had bluish, blue-green, and olive green glazes and high silica and alkali contents which resembled later porcelain wares made at Jingdezhen and Dehua rather than stonewares.|$|E

The effect of different wall structures on the fire smoke flow properties were compared under the condition of same thermal resistance of external wall. Heat absorption of wall has a cooling effect on indoor air in <b>fire</b> <b>process.</b> Wall with external insulation has the most significant cooling effect on indoor air, and that with internal insulation has the weakest. The effect of intermediate insulation is close to external insulation and that of bilateral insulation close to internal insulation. Room temperature and smoke concentration of internal insulation are both higher markedly than of external insulation. The effect of intermediate insulation is close to external insulation and bilateral insulation close to internal insulation.

25|$|He {{needed a}} means of {{transport}} to move the heavy mineral to kilns for firing, and he determined to build what became the Brecon Forest Tramroad to do so. The original route was to lead from Fan Gyhirych, {{at an altitude of}} about 1,500 feet and descend to near present-day Sennybridge. However the long route over difficult terrain was discouraging, and in addition he needed to link in a source of coal for the <b>firing</b> <b>process.</b> A modified route was adopted, from quarries lower in the Tawe Valley at 1,267 feet; this involved hauling the limestone up for {{the first part of the}} journey to the pass known as Bwlch Bryn-rhydd.|$|E
25|$|The {{success of}} all this effort could only be judged after a complicated, {{three-phase}} <b>firing</b> <b>process</b> which generated the red color of the vase clay and the black of the applied slip. Specifically, the vessel was fired in a kiln at a temperature of about 800°C, with the resultant oxidization turning the vase a reddish-orange color. The temperature was then raised to about 950°C with the kiln's vents closed and green wood added to remove the oxygen. The vessel then turned an overall black. The final stage required the vents to be re-opened to allow oxygen into the kiln, which was allowed to cool down. The vessel then returned to its reddish-orange colour due to renewed oxidization, while the now-sintered painted layer remained the glossy black color which had been created in the second stage.|$|E
25|$|Slip is {{a liquid}} clay {{suspension}} of mineral pigments {{applied to the}} ceramics before firing. Slips are typically red, buff, white, and black; however, Nazca culture ceramic artists in Peru perfected 13 distinct colors of slips. They also used a hand-rotated turntable that allowed all sides of a ceramic piece to be painted with ease. These were first used in 500 BCE {{and continue to be}} used today. Slips can be applied overall in washes, creating large color fields, often with cloth, or they can be painted in fine detail with brushes. Yucca leaves, chewed slightly to loosen fibers, make excellent brushes that are still in use today in the American Southwest. Negative painting is a technique employed by precontact Mississippian potters in the Eastern Woodlands, Mayan potters in Mesoamerica, and others, which involves covering the ceramic piece in beeswax or another resist, incised a design in the resist, then soaking the piece with a slip. In the <b>firing</b> <b>process</b> the resists melts away, leaving the colored design.|$|E
40|$|The {{demand for}} more {{accurate}} measurements is increasing in today’s industry. One {{reason for this is}} to optimize production and thus maximize profits. Another reason is that in some cases government regulations dictate that supervision of certain parameters must be followed. At Preemraff Lysekil there are basically four reasons for measuring skin temperatures inside <b>fired</b> <b>process</b> heaters, namely; because of government regulations, in order to estimate the load of the <b>fired</b> <b>process</b> heater, to estimate the lifetime of the tubes inside the <b>fired</b> <b>process</b> heater and finally, to determine the need of decoking. However, only the first three of these reasons are applied to H 2301 / 2 / 3. The current skin thermocouple design has been in use for many years and now the question of how well it measures surface temperature has risen. Furthermore a new weld-free design is under consideration to replace the old skin thermocouple design. Another question is therefore how well the new design can measure the surface temperature under the same operating conditions as the old one. In order to evaluate this, three–dimensional computer simulations were made of the different designs. As this thesis will show, the differences in calculated skin thermocouple temperature and calculated surface temperature is about the same for the two designs. However, the current design will show a lower temperature than the surface temperature, while the new design will show a higher temperature. Regarding the core of the skin thermocouple designs, namely the thermocouple, no hard conclusions can be drawn, although the industry appears to favor type ’N’ over type ’K’...|$|R

40|$|The {{progressive}} {{changes in}} ceramic raw materials during <b>firing</b> <b>processes</b> are a complex area. This is {{partly due to}} the large number of raw material characteristics, primarily mineral composition, and partly to the relatively inadequate particle distribution in the unfired clay body.

The paper analyzes the influence of some additives (fly ashes and waste glass materials) {{on the development of the}} ceramic roofing tile microstructure during the thermal treatment. The analyzed raw material mixtures were: the standard raw material mixture (from Kanjiza, Northern part of Serbia) and the modified one, i. e. the mixture of the standard raw material and corresponding additive.
