5|$|An acute {{exacerbation}} (a sudden worsening of symptoms) {{is commonly}} triggered by infection or environmental pollutants, or sometimes by other {{factors such as}} improper use of medications. Infections {{appear to be the}} cause of 50 to 75% of cases, with bacteria in 25%, viruses in 25%, and both in 25%. Environmental pollutants include both poor indoor and outdoor air quality. Exposure to personal smoke and secondhand smoke increases the risk. Cold temperature may also play a role, with <b>exacerbations</b> occurring more commonly in winter. Those with more severe underlying disease have more frequent exacerbations: in mild disease 1.8 per year, moderate 2 to 3 per year, and severe 3.4 per year. Those with many <b>exacerbations</b> have a faster rate of deterioration of their lung function. Pulmonary emboli (blood clots in the lungs) can worsen symptoms in those with pre-existing COPD. Signs of PE in COPD include pleuritic chest pain and heart failure without signs of infection.|$|E
5|$|An acute {{exacerbation}} of COPD {{is defined}} as increased shortness of breath, increased sputum production, {{a change in the}} color of the sputum from clear to green or yellow, or an increase in cough in someone with COPD. This may present with signs of increased work of breathing such as fast breathing, a fast heart rate, sweating, active use of muscles in the neck, a bluish tinge to the skin, and confusion or combative behavior in very severe <b>exacerbations.</b> Crackles may also be heard over the lungs on examination with a stethoscope.|$|E
5|$|People {{who live}} in large cities have {{a higher rate of}} COPD {{compared}} to people {{who live in}} rural areas. While urban air pollution is a contributing factor in <b>exacerbations,</b> its overall role as a cause of COPD is unclear. Areas with poor outdoor air quality, including that from exhaust gas, generally have higher rates of COPD. The overall effect in relation to smoking, however, is believed to be small.|$|E
30|$|Introduction: In Tunisia {{tuberculosis}} is {{the most}} common etiology of bronchiectasis. In our intensive care bronchiectasis <b>exacerbation</b> is the second pulmonary cause of admission after COPD <b>exacerbation.</b> Few studies have assessed prognosis of bronchiectasis <b>exacerbation</b> requiring mechanical ventilation. Objectives—to determine the prognosis of bronchiectasis <b>exacerbation</b> and factors associated with mortality in these patients.|$|R
50|$|An <b>exacerbation,</b> in medicine, is the {{worsening}} of {{a disease}} or an increase in its symptoms. Examples includes an acute <b>exacerbation</b> of {{chronic obstructive pulmonary disease}} and acute <b>exacerbation</b> of congestive heart failure.|$|R
30|$|Introduction: Noninvasive {{ventilation}} (NIV) is {{the gold}} standard {{in the treatment of}} COPD <b>exacerbation.</b> NIV in acute respiratory failure (ARF) due to bronchiectasis <b>exacerbation</b> remain less recommended.

5|$|Low oxygen levels and, eventually, {{high carbon}} dioxide {{levels in the}} blood can occur from poor gas {{exchange}} due to decreased ventilation from airway obstruction, hyperinflation and a reduced desire to breathe. During <b>exacerbations,</b> airway inflammation is also increased, resulting in increased hyperinflation, reduced expiratory airflow and worsening of gas transfer. This {{can also lead to}} insufficient ventilation and, eventually, low blood oxygen levels. Low oxygen levels, if present for a prolonged period, can result in narrowing of the arteries in the lungs, while emphysema leads to breakdown of capillaries in the lungs. Both these changes result in increased blood pressure in the pulmonary arteries, which may cause cor pulmonale.|$|E
5|$|The {{condition}} {{begins in}} 85% of cases as a clinically isolated syndrome (CIS) {{over a number}} of days with 45% having motor or sensory problems, 20% having optic neuritis, and 10% having symptoms related to brainstem dysfunction, while the remaining 25% have more than one of the previous difficulties. The course of symptoms occurs in two main patterns initially: either as episodes of sudden worsening that last a few days to months (called relapses, <b>exacerbations,</b> bouts, attacks, or flare-ups) followed by improvement (85% of cases) or as a gradual worsening over time without periods of recovery (10–15% of cases). A combination of these two patterns may also occur or people may start in a relapsing and remitting course that then becomes progressive later on. Relapses are usually not predictable, occurring without warning. <b>Exacerbations</b> rarely occur more frequently than twice per year. Some relapses, however, are preceded by common triggers and they occur more frequently during spring and summer. Similarly, viral infections such as the common cold, influenza, or gastroenteritis increase their risk. Stress may also trigger an attack. Women with MS who become pregnant experience fewer relapses; however, during the first months after delivery the risk increases. Overall, pregnancy does not seem to influence long-term disability. Many events have been found not to affect relapse rates including vaccination, breast feeding, physical trauma, and Uhthoff's phenomenon.|$|E
5|$|Hydroquinone lightens {{the skin}} when applied topically by {{inhibiting}} tyrosinase, the enzyme responsible for converting the amino acid tyrosine {{to the skin}} pigment melanin, and is used to treat acne-associated postinflammatory hyperpigmentation. By interfering with new production of melanin in the epidermis, hydroquinone leads to less hyperpigmentation as darkened skin cells are naturally shed over time. Improvement in skin hyperpigmentation is typically seen within six months when used twice daily. Hydroquinone is ineffective for hyperpigmentation affecting deeper layers of skin such as the dermis. The use of a sunscreen with SPF15 or higher {{in the morning with}} reapplication every two hours is recommended when using hydroquinone. Its application only to affected areas lowers the risk of lightening the color of normal skin but can lead to a temporary ring of lightened skin around the hyperpigmented area. Hydroquinone is generally well-tolerated; side effects are typically mild (e.g., skin irritation) and occur with use of a higher than the recommended 4% concentration. Most preparations contain the preservative sodium metabisulfite, which has been linked to rare cases of allergic reactions including anaphylaxis and severe asthma <b>exacerbations</b> in susceptible people. In extremely rare cases, repeated improper topical application of high-dose hydroquinone has been associated with an accumulation of homogentisic acid in connective tissues, a condition known as exogenous ochronosis.|$|E
40|$|The aim of {{this study}} is to screen the {{cognitive}} function during <b>exacerbation</b> of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and investigate whether there is any association between cognitive function and functional impairment, disease severity, or other clinical parameters. Age and sex-matched 133 subjects with COPD <b>exacerbation,</b> 34 stable COPD subjects, and 34 non-COPD subjects were enrolled in this study. For the purpose of this study, mini-mental state examination (MMSE) and Hospital Anxiety and Depression scale were performed. Six-minute walk distance (6 MWD) was recorded, and BODE index was calculated. COPD subjects with <b>exacerbation</b> had the lowest MMSE scores (p = 0. 022). Frequency of subjects with MMSE score lower than 24 is 22. 6, 8. 8, and 8. 8 % in the COPD subjects with <b>exacerbation,</b> stable COPD, and non-COPD control subjects, respectively. The COPD subjects with <b>exacerbation</b> who had MMSE scores lower than 24 were older and less educated. Subjects with COPD <b>exacerbation</b> had shorter 6 MWD than that of stable COPD and non-COPD subjects. After controlling for the impact of age and educational level on MMSE, there was no association between 6 MWD and MMSE scores in subjects with COPD <b>exacerbation.</b> Cognitive impairment is an important comorbidity during COPD <b>exacerbation.</b> Functional capacity is also lower in <b>exacerbation.</b> However, no association was found between cognitive impairment and functional capacity during <b>exacerbation...</b>|$|R

30|$|Patients and methods: In this {{retrospective}} study we included all patients hospitalized between 2001 and 2016 in the Medical intensive care for <b>exacerbation</b> of bronchiectasis and who required invasive or noninvasive ventilation.

40|$|Women with {{obsessive-compulsive}} disorder (OCD) often report that symptoms first appear or exacerbate during reproductive cycle events; however, {{little is known}} about these relationships. The goals of this study were to examine, in a US and a European female OCD sample, onset and <b>exacerbation</b> of OCD in reproductive cycle events, and to investigate the likelihood of repeat <b>exacerbation</b> in subsequent pregnancies and postpartum periods. Five hundred forty-two women (United States, n = 352; Dutch, n = 190) who met DSM-IV criteria for OCD, completed self-report questionnaires designed to assess OCD onset and symptom <b>exacerbation</b> associated with reproductive events. OCD onset occurred within 12 months after menarche in 13. 0 %, during pregnancy in 5. 1 %, at postpartum in 4. 7 %, and at menopause in 3. 7 %. Worsening of pre-existing OCD was reported by 37. 6 % of women at premenstruum, 33. 0 % during pregnancy, 46. 6 % postpartum, and 32. 7 % at menopause. <b>Exacerbation</b> in first pregnancy was significantly associated with <b>exacerbation</b> in second pregnancy (OR = 10. 82, 95 % CI 4. 48 - 26. 16), as was <b>exacerbation</b> in first postpartum with <b>exacerbation</b> in second postpartum (OR = 6. 86, 95 % CI 3. 27 - 14. 36).

40|$|AbstractBackgroundAdequate {{monitoring}} of cystic fibrosis lung disease is difficult. CF <b>exacerbation</b> offers a unique setting {{to test the}} utility of biomarkers {{in the assessment of}} changing airways inflammation. We hypothesised that levels of calprotectin in sputum (and serum) would change informatively following treatment of an <b>exacerbation.</b> Methods 27 patients with CF were recruited at onset of pulmonary <b>exacerbation.</b> Sputum and serum were collected at the start and end of anti-biotic therapy. Sputum calprotectin, interleukin- 8 (IL 8), and myeloperoxidase (MPO) were measured, as were serum calprotectin, CRP and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF). ResultsSputum calprotectin decreased following treatment of an <b>exacerbation</b> (p< 0. 05), and was superior to other sputum markers. Serum calprotectin, CRP, and VEGF also decreased significantly (p= 0. 002, p= 0. 002, p= 0. 013 respectively). Serum calprotectin level following treatment had predictive value for time to next <b>exacerbation</b> (p= 0. 032).

40|$|The {{pathogenesis}} {{of acute}} <b>exacerbation</b> of {{idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis}} (IPF) remains to be elucidated. To evaluate the roles of inflammatory mediators in acute <b>exacerbation,</b> the concentrations of high mobility group protein B 1 (HMGB 1), a chief mediator of acute lung injury, and 18 inflammatory cytokines were measured in the bronchoalveolar lavage fluid, serially sampled from seven IPF patients after the onset of acute <b>exacerbation.</b> HMGB 1 gradually increased in the alveolar fluid after the onset of acute <b>exacerbation,</b> in positive correlation with monocytes chemotactic protein- 1 (MCP- 1), a potent fibrogenic mediator. In the lung tissues of eight IPF patients autopsied after acute <b>exacerbation,</b> intense cytoplasmic staining for HMGB 1 was observed in the alveolar epithelial cells in alveolar capillary augmented lesions, where the capillary endothelial cells remarkably reduced the expression of thrombomodulin, an intrinsic antagonist of HMGB 1. These results suggest pathogenic roles for HMGB 1 and MCP- 1 in the late phase of acute <b>exacerbation</b> of IPF...|$|R
30|$|Acute <b>exacerbation</b> of IPF, {{which occurs}} in {{approximately}} 5 – 15  % of cases with stable IPF per year, has a poor prognosis with a mortality rate of 50 – 80  % (Song et al. 2011). Early diagnosis is therefore considered crucial. KL- 6 {{has been widely}} investigated in the markers of acute <b>exacerbation</b> of IPF (Zhang and Kaminski 2012). It {{has been reported that}} KL- 6 levels rise in patients with acute <b>exacerbation</b> of IPF (Collard et al. 2010; Ishikawa et al. 2012). On the other hand, KL- 6 levels do not always rise in the early phase of acute <b>exacerbation</b> of IPF (Ishizaka et al. 2004; Kakugawa et al. 2013). In this study, sICAM- 1 levels were elevated already on the first day diagnosed as acute <b>exacerbation</b> of IPF, suggesting that it could be a biomarker for early phase of acute <b>exacerbation</b> of IPF. Because the expression of ICAM- 1 was enhanced in the initial phase of inflammation and early phase of acute respiratory distress syndrome (Schütte et al. 1996; Pugin et al. 1996; Kuppner et al. 1990), sICAM- 1 levels may also rise in the early phase of acute <b>exacerbation</b> of IPF.|$|R

25|$|Chronic rhinosinusitis {{represents}} a multifactorial inflammatory disorder, {{rather than simply}} a persistent bacterial infection. The medical management of chronic rhinosinusitis is now focused upon controlling the inflammation that predisposes patients to obstruction, reducing the incidence of infections.

Most individuals require initial antibiotics to clear any infection and intermittently afterwards to treat acute <b>exacerbations</b> of chronic rhinosinusitis.|$|E
40|$|Background Asthma is {{a chronic}} airway {{inflammatory}} disease; however, the molecular mechanisms that underlie asthma <b>exacerbation</b> are only partially understood. Objective To identify gene expression signatures {{that reflect the}} acute <b>exacerbation</b> of asthma, we examined the differential expression of genes during asthma <b>exacerbation</b> and stable condition by using microarray analysis. Methods The subjects were mite-sensitive asthmatic children and non-asthmatic control children. The children were divided into four groups (AE: asthma <b>exacerbation,</b> n= 12; SA: stable asthma, n= 11; IC: infected control, n= 6; and NC: non-infected control, n= 5). Total RNA was extracted from {{peripheral blood mononuclear cells}} and subjected to microarray analysis with Illumina Human Ref 8 BeadChip arrays. Welch 2 ̆ 7 s t-test was performed to identify genes whose expression was altered during asthma <b>exacerbation.</b> Quantitative real-time RT-PCR was performed on samples collected from 43 asthmatic children and 11 control children to verify the microarray results. Results The expression of 137 / 16 genes was significantly up/down-regulated during asthma <b>exacerbation</b> assessed by microarray analysis. Of the genes, 62 were also differentially expressed during upper respiratory infection. Many of the asthma <b>exacerbation</b> related genes were involved in defence responses and responses to external stimuli, but these associations disappeared after excluding the infection-related genes. Quantitative real-time RT-PCR confirmed that the genes related (S 100 A 8 and GAS 6) and unrelated to infections (CD 200 and RBP 7) were differentially expressed during asthma <b>exacerbation</b> (P< 0. 01). Conclusions Previously unidentified immune responses during asthma <b>exacerbation</b> may provide further clarification of the molecular mechanisms underlying asthma...|$|R
40|$|Objectives: Most clinicians {{refrain from}} trauma {{treatment}} {{for patients with}} psychosis because they fear symptom <b>exacerbation</b> and relapse. This study examined the negative side effects of trauma-focused (TF) treatment in patients with psychosis and posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD). Methods: Analyses were conducted on data from a single-blind randomized controlled trial comparing TF treatment (N = 108; 8 sessions prolonged exposure or eye movement desensitization) and waiting list (WL; N = 47) among patients with a lifetime psychotic disorder and current chronic PTSD. Symptom <b>exacerbation,</b> adverse events, and revictimization were assessed posttreatment and at 6 -month follow-up. Also investigated were symptom <b>exacerbation</b> after initiation of TF treatment {{and the relationship between}} symptom <b>exacerbation</b> and dropout. Results: Any symptom <b>exacerbation</b> (PTSD, paranoia, or depression) tended to occur more frequently in the WL condition. After the first TF treatment session, PTSD symptom <b>exacerbation</b> was uncommon. There was no increase of hallucinations, dissociation, or suicidality during the first 2 sessions. Paranoia decreased significantly during this period. Dropout was not associated with symptom <b>exacerbation.</b> Compared with the WL condition, fewer persons in the TF treatment condition reported an adverse event (OR = 0. 48, P =. 032). Surprisingly, participants receiving TF treatment were significantly less likely to be revictimized (OR = 0. 40, P =. 035). Conclusions: In these participants, TF treatment did not result in symptom <b>exacerbation</b> or adverse events. Moreover, TF treatment was associated with significantly less <b>exacerbation,</b> less adverse events, and reduced revictimization compared with the WL condition. This suggests that conventional TF treatment protocols can be safely used in patients with psychosis without negative side effects...|$|R
40|$|SummaryNon-thyroidal illness {{syndrome}} (NTIS) {{is frequently}} detected in chronic, systemic diseases. The {{objectives of the}} current study is to assess the alterations of thyroid hormones during <b>exacerbation</b> period, recovery of <b>exacerbation</b> and stable phase of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and correlates of these hormonal alterations. A total of 83 stable COPD patients, 20 patients with acute <b>exacerbation</b> and 30 control subjects were evaluated. TT 3, fT 3, TT 3 /TT 4 levels of both stable and <b>exacerbation</b> COPD groups were lower than control subjects. TSH was also decreased during <b>exacerbation</b> period. In follow-up of COPD <b>exacerbation</b> group, TSH, TT 3, fT 3 and TT 3 /TT 4 were found to be increased in measurements on the day of discharge from hospital and after 1 month, compared to baseline values. TT 3 and TT 3 /TT 4 were lower in severe COPD; whereas TSH, fT 3, TT 3 and TT 3 /TT 4 were lower in patients with severe hypoxemia. IL- 6 and TNF-α were higher in both stable and <b>exacerbation</b> phase COPD groups and IL- 6 was correlated to TT 3 in stable COPD. As a result, there are significant alterations in thyroid hormones of stable COPD patients, which are related to severity of disease and hypoxemia. The hormonal changes are more significant during <b>exacerbation</b> and partially regress after 1 month when the disease is stabilized. We conclude that COPD patients should not be evaluated for thyroid disease during <b>exacerbation</b> of the disease, and thyroid function alterations during stable phase of the disease should be considered cautiously, since thyroid function abnormalities in non-thyroid illness may mimic or mask biochemical abnormalities observed in true thyroid disease...|$|R

Severe asthma <b>exacerbation</b> with V-D-deficiency showed lower forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV 1) compared to that with V-D-sufficiency. V-D-deficiency intensified ROS release and DNA damage and increased TNF-α, OGG 1 and NFκB expression and NFκB phosphorylation in severe asthma <b>exacerbation.</b> Supplemental vitamin D 3 significantly increased the rates of FEV 1 change and decreased ROS and DNA damage in V-D-deficiency. Vitamin D 3 inhibited LPS-induced ROS and DNA damage and were associated with a decline in TNF-α and NFκB in epithelial cells. H 2 O 2 reduces nuclear translocation of glucocorticoid receptors in airway epithelial cell lines. V-D pretreatment enhanced the dexamethasone-induced nuclear translocation of glucocorticoid receptors in airway epithelial cell lines and monocytes from 25 -hydroxyvitamin D 3 -deficiency asthma patients.

40|$|Premenstrual <b>exacerbation</b> {{of major}} {{depression}} is not uncommon. Premenstrual phase-related violence {{has also been}} reported. Serotonergic antidepressants, used both continuous-ly and with increased dosage in the late luteal phase, {{are believed to be}} effective for major depressive disorder with premenstrual <b>exacerbation.</b> Adding a second medication for non-responder treatment is another treatment option.
