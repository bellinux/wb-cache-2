40|$|The {{electromagnetic}} {{design and}} performance analysis of dual/ multi-band metamaterial frequency selective surface (FSS) structures {{have been carried}} out for radome applications in microwave and millimeter wave frequency regimes. The proposed metamaterial FSS structure, consisting of cascaded MNG (mu-nega -tive) and DPS (double positive) layers, exhibits dual-band transmission responses at V-band and W-band. Excellent transmission efficiency (more than 95 %) has been obtained over the frequency range 45. 8 - 53. 1 GHz at first resonance, and from 93. 0 - 97. 1 GHz at second resonance. The incorporation of additional DPS layer to the proposed metamaterial-FSS structure facilitates multiband bandpass characteristics at 30 GHz (in Ka-band), 64 GHz (in V-band), and 93. 6 GHz (in W-band).

40|$|Abstract—In {{this paper}} an inverse source problem is investigated. The {{measurement}} set-up is a reflector antenna {{covered by a}} radome. Equivalent currents are reconstructed on a surface shaped as the radome in order to diagnose the radome’s interaction with the radiated field. To tackle this inverse source problem an analysis of a full-wave integral representation, with the equivalent currents as unknowns, is used. The extinction theorem and its associated integral equation ensure that the reconstructed currents represent sources within the radome. The axially symmetric experimental set-up reduces the computational complexity of the problem. The resulting linear system is inverted by using a singular value decomposition.

30|$|We {{have been}} researching the method {{to enhance the}} {{targeting}} in breast tissue, named a preloading-based needle insertion method.

During the needle <b>insertion</b> <b>phase,</b> the needle direction does not change to avoid damaging internal tissues. Insertion is stopped when the tumor position and needle tip are closest. Thus, this method has a preloading phase and a needle <b>insertion</b> <b>phase</b> to locate the preloading probe and pierce the breast tissue.

A nose-cone radome is diagnosed by recreating the equivalent surface currents on its surface from measured near fields.

40|$|Knowledge of {{the current}} {{distribution}} on a radome {{can be used to}} improve radome design, detect manufacturing errors, and to verify numerical simulations. In this paper, the transformation from near-field data to its equivalent current distribution on a surface of arbitrary material, i. e., the radome, is analyzed. The transformation is based on the scalar surface integral representation that relates the equivalent currents to the near-field data. The presence of axial symmetry enables usage of the fast Fourier transform (FFT) to reduce the computational complexity. Furthermore, the problem is regularized using the singular value decomposition (SVD). Both synthetic and measured data are used to verify the method. The quantity of data is large since the height of the radome corresponds to 29 − 43 wavelengths in the frequency interval 8. 0 − 12. 0 GHz. It is shown that the method gives an accurate description of the field radiated from an antenna, on a surface enclosing it. Moreover, disturbances introduced by copper plates attached to the radome surface, not localized in the measured near field, are focused and detectable in the equivalent currents.

40|$|In this thesis, {{an inverse}} source {{reconstruction}} method with great potential in radome diagnostics is presented. A radome is a cover that encloses an antenna {{in order to}} protect it from environmental influences. Radome diagnostics are acquired in the design process, the delivery control, and in performance verification of repaired and newly developed radomes. A measured near or far field may indicate deviations, e. g., beam deflection, but the origins of the flaws are not uncovered. In this thesis, radome diagnostics is performed by imaging the tangential electromagnetic fields on radome surfaces, disclosing the radome influence on the electromagnetic fields as well as the positions and influences of defects. The source reconstruction is based on a surface integral representation together with the extinction theorem. The extinction theorem and its associated surface integral equation ensure that the reconstructed tangential electromagnetic fields have their sources within the radome. The presence of axial symmetry in the measurement set-up enables usage of the fast Fourier transform to reduce the computational complexity. Furthermore, the problem is solved by an in-house body of revolution method of moments (MoM) code utilizing a singular value decomposition (SVD) for regularization. The reconstruction is performed on a fictitious surface in free space, located precisely outside the physical surface of the radome, i. e., no a priori information of the material of the radome is requested. Moreover, both synthetic and measured data are used to verify the method. In Papers I-III, the measurement set-up is a reflector antenna covered by a monolithic radome, and the near field is measured on a cylindrical surface. The height of the radome corresponds to 29 - 43 wavelengths in the frequency interval 8. 0 - 12. 0 GHz. The amplitude and phase of the tangential electromagnetic fields are reconstructed on the radome surface and the influence of the radome is investigated. Moreover, the alteration of the phase due to the transmission of the radome, the <b>insertion</b> <b>phase</b> <b>delay</b> (IPD), is imaged. Defects in the form of square copper patches, with an edge length corresponding to 1. 6 - 2. 4 wavelengths in the considered frequency interval, are attached to the radome wall. These might {{serve as a model for}} e. g., a lightning conductor or a Pitot tube. The attached patches alter the near field, and by applying source reconstruction, the disturbances of the patches are focused and detectable. In Paper IV, the field is measured on a spherical sector in the far-field region at 10. 0 GHz. Two set-ups with dielectric defects attached to the radome surface, are investigated. The aim is to investigate if variations in the electrical thickness of the radome wall can be detected. It is concluded that it is possible to discover dielectric patches of various edge sizes (0. 5 - 2. 0 wavelengths), and with the smallest thickness corresponding to a phase shift of a couple of degrees. In Paper V, a frequency selective (FSS) radome corresponding to a height of 51 wavelengths at the frequency 9. 35 GHz is investigated. The electrical performance of an FSS radome depends on the periodic structure of the elements in the radome frame. The periodic structure of the investigated radome is disrupted by horizontal defects (vertical displacements of elements) and vertical defects (a column of missing elements). The far-field data is measured on a spherical sector, and the far-field data reveals that the radome changes the radiation properties. The tangential electromagnetic fields on the radome surface are reconstructed for several antenna illuminations to image the cause of these alterations. Furthermore, it is shown that the different components of the electromagnetic fields are affected differently by the defects, implying that both co- and cross-components of the electric and magnetic fields need to be considered. Moreover, the Poynting's vector is employed to visualize how the defects block the field from the antenna...|$|E

The phase difference obtained from multi-temporal synthetic aperture radar images contains errors of several types, and the atmospheric <b>phase</b> <b>delay</b> can be an obstacle to estimating surface subsidence.

Then, assuming a range direction between a target pixel and the sensor, we derive the cumulative amount of differential PW {{at the height of the}} slant range vector at pixels along that direction. The atmospheric <b>phase</b> <b>delay</b> of each interferogram is acquired by taking a residual after a preliminary determination of the linear deformation velocity and digital elevation model (DEM) error, and by applying high-pass temporal and low-pass spatial filters.
