5|$|My {{interpretation}} {{is that she}} isn’t {{trying to keep the}} secret. That she doesn’t care. She changed her last name to avoid getting kidnapped, but really, if anyone <b>figured</b> <b>it</b> <b>out</b> and asked her, she’d just probably be like “Yeah, shut up!” or whatever. I feel like everyone at ISIS is so self-involved and so concerned with furthering their own agenda that it would never occur to them to think that anyone else has anything else going on.|$|E
5|$|Benny was {{a tricky}} one because he doesn't speak English very well. I ended up kind of using his cousin Allessandro as an interpreter. It {{was a little}} bit {{frustrating}} at first but eventually we found a way to communicate. You figure out a way. With music it's so much about the vibe and the energy and you know when things are working and when they’re not. When you're working with someone for the first time, there's a kind of shyness that everybody has, so with Benny it was more challenging because of that but we <b>figured</b> <b>it</b> <b>out</b> and by the end I felt like I knew him very well.|$|E
5|$|At {{the age of}} 10, Kunis {{auditioned for}} but failed to get {{the role of a}} Russian Jewish girl who moves to America in the film Make a Wish, Molly. Instead, she was cast in the {{secondary}} role of a Mexican girl. In 1998, Kunis was cast as Jackie Burkhart in the Fox sitcom That '70s Show. All who auditioned were required to be at least 18 years old; Kunis, who was 14 at the time, told the casting directors she would be 18 but did not say when. Though they eventually <b>figured</b> <b>it</b> <b>out,</b> the producers still thought Kunis was the best fit for the role. That '70s Show ran for eight seasons. She won two consecutive Young Star Awards as Best Young Actress in a Comedy TV Series in 1999 and 2000 for her performances.|$|E

500|$|Bad Girls Club was renewed for a seventeenth season, {{and will}} be titled Bad Girls Club: East Meets West. In February 2017, the series' future was put in limbo, with the network's {{annoucement}} that it would convert to a true crime programming format, which was instituted in July 2017. When discussing the series' future, Frances Berwick, NBCUniversal Cable Entertainment Lifestyle Networks' president, revealed: [...] "Bad Girls Club, at this stage, I don't see it on Oxygen linear (referencing that it could air in a non-linear media form). Beyond that, we haven't <b>figured</b> <b>it</b> <b>out</b> yet." ...|$|E
500|$|Some {{songs were}} from McCartney's childhood, {{in which his}} father, Jim, would often be playing on the family piano. Most of the songs were played based on the sheet music, as LiPuma said that [...] "We'd have {{somebody}} write out a chord sheet for us, {{and then we went}} in and <b>figured</b> <b>it</b> <b>out</b> on the date". LiPuma also said McCartney wasn't unfamiliar with the group's way of recording, saying that McCartney said [...] "I love this. It reminds me of the way we used to do the Beatles. John [...] and I would write a song, we'd have a date booked at Abbey Road, and neither George Martin, George Harrison or Ringo [...] knew what the songs were about. They'd work it out right there in the room".|$|E
500|$|Filming {{began in}} February 2005; the crew filmed for ten {{hours a day}} for thirty-one days. The eleven-year-old Palmer had to follow the United States' child labor laws, which necessitated {{spending}} at least three hours a day at school, one on recreation, and one at lunch. Nevertheless, Palmer appeared in almost every scene, about which Ganis commented, [...] "I honestly don't know how we <b>figured</b> <b>it</b> <b>out,</b> but we did". To get the filming done on time, Atchison storyboarded the scenes ahead of time and chatted with cinematographer David Mullen, the production designer Warren Young, and Glenn Farr to compile a list of scenes. This way, the filming team began each day knowing what shots they would take, their order, and the performances scheduled for each day. Most of the filming took place in South Los Angeles, which Atchison picked as the filming location due to their low budget. Scenes were also filmed at the University of Southern California, Hollywood Palladium—which stood in for the Grand Ballroom of the Washington, D.C. Hyatt Hotel—and Venice High School.|$|E

500|$|While the {{portions}} of the episode focusing on Joan, Peggy, and Sally were critically acclaimed, some critics were mixed {{on the value of}} the dream sequence. One writer for Zap2it declared the episode one of the best episodes yet. Alan Sepinwall, writing for Hitfix said that the episode was [...] "full of nightmares and self-realizations" [...] as well as [...] "horrifying images". Sepinwall wrote that the [...] "only way the strangulation scene would have been acceptable to me was with the understanding going in that it was a dream. Had the show not telegraphed that — or had I not <b>figured</b> <b>it</b> <b>out</b> — and Don woke up the next morning with no corpse on the floor, I'd have been irked." [...] One writer for Paste Magazine noted that the [...] "brilliantly shot" [...] episode had a [...] "Hitchcockian feel", and pointed to the use of [...] "reverse point-of-view shots" [...] and [...] "close-ups of hands on doorknobs that added an air of suspense not usually present on Mad Men." [...] Eric Goldman of IGN declared it the [...] "best episode yet for Season 5, with some very good material for Joan, Peggy, Don and Sally packed into a busy hour." [...] Goldman praised the resolution to the Harris marriage, crediting Weiner with mastering [...] "the slow burn on this show, and it was just so gratifying to finally have this issue be dealt with." ...|$|E
500|$|Another major {{breakthrough}} was developing the plot twist that Prince Hans would be revealed as the film's true villain only near the end. Hans {{was not even}} in the earliest drafts, then at first was not a villain, and after becoming one, was revealed to be evil much earlier in the plot. Del Vecho said, [...] "We realized [...] was most important [...] {{if we were going to}} make the ending so surprising you had to believe at one point that Hans was the answer... he's not the answer, it's Kristoff... f you can get the audience to leap ahead and think they have <b>figured</b> <b>it</b> <b>out</b> you can surprise them by turning it the other way." [...] Lee acknowledged that Hans was written as [...] "sociopathic" [...] and [...] "twisted" [...] throughout the final version. For example, Hans mirrors the behavior of the other characters: [...] "He mirrors [...] and he's goofy with her... he Duke [...] is a jerk, so he's a jerk back. And with Elsa he's a hero." [...] It was difficult to lay the foundation for Anna's belated turn to Kristoff without also making Hans' betrayal of Anna too predictable, in that the audience had to [...] "feel... her feeling something but not quite understanding it... Because the minute it is [...] it deflated." [...] At one point, Anna openly flirted with Kristoff upon first meeting him, but that was changed after Walt Disney Studios chairman Alan Horn pointed out that it would confuse and annoy viewers since Anna was already engaged to Hans.|$|E
500|$|Chris Kelly of Fact said, [...] "By {{embracing}} the codeine-weed-molly trifecta, hashtag-friendly hooks, and — perhaps most significantly — ascendant producers, the 38-year-old rapper has maintained rap relevance, even as {{that has become}} more difficult than ever." [...] Peter Marrack of Exclaim! stated, [...] "For all its vulgarity, predictability, repetitiveness and reckless musings on drugs, Juicy J's trippy music succeeds because of its spirit." [...] Julia LeConte of Now said, [...] "The whole thing isn't about disrespecting women, though. Some songs merely weave the misogyny around simple-pleasure narratives: popping molly, making money. On his third solo record, the Three 6 Mafia rapper signed to Wiz Khalifa's Taylor Gang is 'getting high like he's 18.' At 38, though, it's not super-amusing, like J is the hip-hop Peter Pan refusing to grow up among a crew of younger emcees." [...] Elysa Gardner of USA Today stated, [...] "Stay Trippy can be musically compelling. Granted, the words are hard to miss. [...] "Stay motivated, stay high, stay hustling, (forget) everything else," [...] he intones on [...] "So Much Money", a title that sums up the highest virtue in J's world." [...] David [...] "Rek" [...] Lee of HipHopDX said, [...] "Some Rap is tailor made for headphone listening and careful analysis of every word. Then there are songs that {{are meant to be}} played loud in public settings, and the lyrics don't matter so much. If you haven't already <b>figured</b> <b>it</b> <b>out,</b> Stay Trippy is the latter. And for as much flack as it receives, there is entertainment value there and it serves its purpose as a soundtrack to the 'trippy' lifestyle." ...|$|E

Back then, we never did that. We never spent a very long time recording anything.

I could see he was getting a bit paranoid and so I was getting paranoid. I turned around and said [...] "You're making me paranoid!" [...] And he said, [...] "No, you're making me paranoid!"

2500|$|In April 1940 he {{was traded}} to the Detroit Lions in {{exchange}} for two rookie players. However, Smukler decided to leave football and join the United States Army. He said, “I got $3,000 a year for playing football professionally. It was great during the season. Everybody shook your hand, slapped you on the back, and told you what a swell fellow you were. But the rest of the time, I couldn’t get a job.” Between football seasons Smukler could only make money doing piecework as a glove cutter. “It was enough to discourage any man, and I kept thinking about what I was going to do when I couldn’t play football anymore.

2500|$|In 1939, the Japanese {{introduced}} a new cipher machine for their most sensitive diplomatic traffic, replacing an earlier system that SIS referred to as [...] "RED."

The Navy's cryptological unit (OP-20-G) and the SIS {{thought it might be}} related to earlier Japanese cipher machines, and agreed that SIS would handle the attack on the system. After several months trying to discover underlying patterns in PURPLE ciphertexts, an SIS team led by Friedman and Rowlett, in an extraordinary achievement, <b>figured</b> <b>it</b> <b>out.</b> PURPLE, unlike the German Enigma or the Hebern design, did not use rotors but stepper switches like those in automated telephone exchanges.
