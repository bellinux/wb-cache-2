Reasons for selecting the YAH-64A included its more damage tolerant four-blade main rotor and the instability of the YAH-63's tricycle landing gear arrangement.|$|E

5|$|Following {{this the}} routine of the {{battalion}} became more settled and time was found for the men of <b>each</b> <b>company</b> to spend a fortnight at a hotel on the Lignano beach. Afterwards, preparations began for the battalion's return to New Zealand. The war with Japan continued however, {{and at the time}} it was believed that the Māoris would take part in further operations in the Pacific. New Zealand policy at the time was that long serving men were to be repatriated and their places taken by men with less time in service. In this regard, commencing in late May, drafts of men departed in the order of their arrival at the battalion. This included the commanding officer, Lieutenant Colonel Arapeta Awatere, who was replaced by Lieutenant Colonel James Henare.|$|E
5|$|In 1890 Lilly {{and other}} civic leaders founded the Commercial Club; Lilly was elected {{as its first}} president. The club, renamed the Indianapolis Chamber of Commerce in 1912, was the primary vehicle for Lilly's city {{development}} goals. It was instrumental in making numerous advances for the city, including citywide paved streets, elevated railways to allow vehicles and people to pass beneath them, and a city sewage system. The companies that provided these services were created through private and public investments and operated at low-cost; in practice they belonged to the companies' customers, who slowly bought <b>each</b> <b>company</b> back from its initial investors. The model was later followed other regions of Indiana to establish water and electric utility companies. The Commercial Club members also helped fund the creation of parks, monuments, and memorials, as well as successfully attracted investment from other businessmen and organizations to expand Indianapolis's growing industries.|$|E

The Lancashire and Yorkshire Railway also needed routes into the coalfields, and the two companies agreed with the two new railways on a takeover plan. The North Eastern Railway Act of 31 July 1902 dissolved, transferred to and vested both companies in the North Eastern and the Lancashire and Yorkshire railway companies jointly, with three directors appointed by <b>each</b> <b>company.</b> They paid £73,500 for the Goole and Marshland line, which had been completed, and £27,500 for the Isle of Axholme Light Railway, which {{was still in the}} early stages of construction.|$|E
