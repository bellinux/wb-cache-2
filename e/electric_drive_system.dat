40|$|Abstract — Modeling of Electric Motors {{coupled to}} complex {{nonlinear}} mechanical {{system is a}} challenging task. However, high performance control of <b>electric</b> <b>drives</b> <b>systems</b> requires accurate models of mechanical loads. Gray-Box models using neural networks are used here to identify the electrical machine-mechanical load <b>system</b> of an <b>electric</b> <b>drive.</b> The use of this approach for <b>electric</b> <b>drive</b> identification is illustrated with a DC motor <b>drive</b> <b>system</b> driving an unknown static load. Simulation results are presented to demonstrate the capability of the proposed approach.

25|$|The {{prototype}} bus {{was equipped}} with an innovative system of Bombardier PRIMOVE, allowing inductive charging without connecting cables. The drive system uses an <b>electric</b> <b>drive</b> <b>system</b> by Vossloh Kiepe GmbH made in Düsseldorf. The motor was centrally mounted by 4 poles with the asynchronous motor which has a maximum power output of 160kW (1400 Nm) and allows the use of standard axles: ZF AV 132, and the independently sprung axle ZF RL 75 EC. Energy recovered during braking is stored in the lithium-ion batteries with a capacity of 210 kWh. The vehicle is also equipped with a plug-in connector {{that allows you to}} connect additional to an external energy source. All devices in the vehicle, which are usually powered by a diesel engine have been electrified. The air conditioning system has a built-Konvekta UL500EM CO2 heat pump, which is also used for heating the vehicle.|$|E

[...] Laser weapon systems {{are likely to}} become more prominent to engage threats without using missiles that could potentially cost more than the target it is engaging. Less costly weapon systems may help keep the destroyer class from becoming too expensive. Initial requirements for the Future Surface Combatant will emphasize lethality and survivability, as well as being able to continue to protect aircraft carriers.

40|$|There {{are many}} reasons, why <b>electric</b> <b>drive</b> <b>systems</b> {{will be used}} in future more {{frequently}} in transportation systems. The electrification allows a flexible use of different energy sources and thus creates a greater independence from fossil energy. However, <b>electric</b> <b>drive</b> <b>systems</b> are a challenge for the manufacturers of transportation systems. The electrical powertrain can not only be exposed to interferences, it may also emit interferences into components and communication cables in the vicinity. This can be a high risk for the <b>drive</b> <b>system</b> and for the passengers. For that reason, an EMC study of an electrical powertrain for transportation systems is presented. There the interference at the unshielded high-voltage cable (HV-cable) is characterized. The analysis of the influence of position variation of the communication cable with respect to the unshielded HV-cables is one main aspect.

40|$|The paper {{presents}} {{a number of}} advanced solutions on electric machines and machine-based systems for the powertrain of electric vehicles (EVs). Two types of systems are considered, namely the <b>drive</b> <b>systems</b> designated to the EV propulsion and the power split devices utilized in the popular series-parallel hybrid electric vehicle architecture. After reviewing the main requirements for the <b>electric</b> <b>drive</b> <b>systems,</b> the paper illustrates advanced electric machine topologies, including a stator permanent magnet (stator-PM) motor, a hybrid-excitation motor, a flux memory motor and a redundant motor structure. Then, it illustrates advanced <b>electric</b> <b>drive</b> <b>systems,</b> such as the magnetic-geared in-wheel drive and the integrated starter generator (ISG). Finally, three machine-based implementations of the power split devices are expounded, built up around the dual-rotor PM machine, the dual-stator PM brushless machine and the magnetic-geared dual-rotor machine.
