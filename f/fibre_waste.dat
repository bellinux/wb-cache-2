The carrier material were consisted of sisal <b>fibre</b> <b>waste,</b> pumice stone and porous glass beads, and the bioprocess evaluated was the methanogenesis anaerobic digestion of sisal leaf waste leachate. Process performance was investigated by increasing the organic loading rate (OLR) step-wise. The best results {{were obtained from the}} bioreactor packed with sisal <b>fibre</b> <b>waste.</b> It had the highest chemical oxygen demand (COD) removal efficiencies in the range of 80 - 93 % at OLRs in the range of 2. 4 - 25 g COD L- 1 d- 1. The degradation pattern of volatile fatty acids (VFAs) showed that the degradation of propionate was limiting at higher OLRs. The stable pH and higher partial alkalinity (PA) of the outflow illustrated that packed-bed bioreactors have a good ability to withstand the variations in load and volatile fatty acid concentrations that can occur in a two-stage anaerobic process. In conclusion, sisal <b>fibre</b> <b>waste</b> was shown to be a novel promising biofilm carrier and would work very well in methanogenic biofilm bioreactors treating sisal leaf tissue waste leachate.

In geotechnical engineering, expansive clay soils are categorised as problematic soils due to their swelling behaviour upon increase in the moisture content. The problematic nature of such soils is intensified with the increase in the plasticity index.

The results obtained by Ceglie et al. (2015) revealed that green waste compost (GC) and palm fibre trunk (PF) waste-derived substrates were suitable for their use in peat (SP) substitution. Using a mixture design, authors have reported that a substrate formulation with 20 % GC, 39 % PF and 31 % SP offers the best lettuce, tomato and melon plantlets growth in nursery stage. This formulation includes a high amount of palm <b>fibre</b> <b>waste</b> which confirms our results about date-palm wastes effectiveness in peat substitution. This effectiveness was reported by different authors, such as Ghehsareh (2013), in a study using different mixtures of date-palm wastes and rice hull.

40|$|With the world’s {{population}} {{predicted to}} grow by another two billion people within the next forty years (United Nations, 2013) the demand for arable land space for agricultural food production will increase rapidly. This in turn will result in an increased volume of waste fibre. The availability of land to produce virgin fibre-only crops is limited. Companies and designers are beginning to use non-traditional innovative approaches to utilise the fibre from agricultural food production or renewable sources. The Formary have placed themselves amongst these companies and have an aim to {{reduce the need for}} virgin fibre-only crops, freeing up valuable land space for food production. The Formary are developing ways to convert <b>fibre</b> <b>waste</b> from agricultural food production into viable and marketable fabrics, “by transforming waste through good design” (The Formary, n. d.). The Formary developed a relationship with the Chinese Government in 2011, while on the Wellington City Council’s Mayoral Delegation to China, approaching them with an idea to use rice straw fibre from the 33 % of unused waste. In 2012, a collaborative partnership between The Formary, Dr. Sandy Heffernan of Massey University’s Textile department and Wool Yarns Ltd {{led to the development of}} a prototype yarn, using a blend of rice straw waste and New Zealand strong wool 1. Funding provided by Callaghan Innovation enabled this investigation to further the research into using rice straw waste fibre as a textile material. The overall research had two key requirements. The first requirement was undertaken by Dr. Gaile Dombroski who researched the technical processing of the rice straw into a viable yarn using different retting 2 processes. This research and design development focuses on the second requirement, investigating design processes that can use rice straw waste as a fundamental material. The key goal was to use an optimal ratio of rice straw waste to develop innovative, distinctive and viable fabrics. Fabric experiments were constructed through the reinterpretation and development of traditional textile woven and non-woven techniques. The traditional textile construction process of weave has been comprehensively investigated and experimented with to develop the use of the rice straw and wool yarn within a textile structure. The non-woven textile technique of felting was also incorporated into this research as it offered an opportunity to increase the percentage of rice straw used. It also created a unique way to bind the rice straw and wool fibres together. Both textile processes have added value to the rice straw fibre by highlighting its natural properties, with the intention of producing innovative, high end, marketable fabrics as alternatives to current forms of disposal. This research depicts the partnership that was formed between The Formary and myself and progresses through my journey to shape the development of using the rice straw waste within textile design...|$|E
40|$|The {{world today}} {{is faced with}} serious global warming and {{environmental}} pollution. Besides that, the fossil fuel will become decrease {{in the near future}} and also increasing prices of fuel cause awareness to find alternative energy. Carbon {{is one of the most}} abundant elements found on earth. Nowadays carbon is really useful in the chemical industries and the demand of carbon used is high based on its applications towards the human needed. Carbonization is one of the possible thermo chemical conversions of biomass into energy, where a solid residue known as charcoal is produced through a slow process of partial thermal decomposition of in the absence or controlled presence of oxygen. (Bridgewater, 2003). There are three objectives that need to achieve at the end of this research. The objectives are; to develop and demonstrate the technology of hydrothermal carbonization process; to compare the carbon particles produce from HTC process and pyrolysis process; to study the effect of the wood <b>fibre</b> <b>waste</b> used towards the production of carbon. The HTC process occurs in the excess of water. About 1 liter water was used for every experiment of hydrothermal carbonization process. The reaction is based on catalyst which is 50 ml of citric acid was used for every experiment of hydrothermal carbonization process. the reaction occur in the supercritical unit for temperature about 200 oC. The product obtained then was drying to remove the water contain. Second process which is the pyrolysis was run in the furnace by using the same operation condition as the HTC process. The differences between the process is the pyrolysis is no including water during the process. The process is about heating the wood fiber waste with absence of oxygen. Then the products were undergoing the physical characteristic testing by using Field Emission Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM) and Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR). After analyzing the sample from both process through FESEM and NM) the comparison was made. Through the FESEM characterization, the diameter of the sample and the morphology effect was determined. The comparison was made and the best sample shown by the sample from HTC process using 150 g of wood fiber waste. The diameter of the sample shown about 7. 3 μm and the highest rupture occur at the surface of the particles. Results from NMR proves that the carbon content inside the sample was changes after undergo the HTC and pyrolysis process. The comparison was made and it shows that after undergo the HTC process the carbon content for cellulose and lignin was increased and HTC sample shows the content of aromatic lignin. Differ with pyrolysis process which does not contain aromatic lignin but for other content still increase after undergo the pyrolysis process. The proximate analysis also was done and it was found that HTC 175 g WF gives the highest value of moisture content, HTC 150 g WF gives the highest values of ash content with 15. 07 %. for volatile content the highest values was the sample from pyrolysis 175 g WF with 91. 89 % and lastly for calorific value proves the pyrolysis with 175 g of WF give the highest calorific value with 24. 88 MJ/kg...|$|E

40|$|This paper {{investigated}} the supramolecular properties and accessibility of fibres regenerated from cotton-based waste garments and compared to typical lyocell fibres. The supramolecular and accessibility {{properties of the}} cotton-based <b>waste</b> garments <b>fibres</b> regenerated from three sources (waste denim garments, easy care finished cotton fabrics and a blend of cotton-based waste garment with wood pulp) were analyzed and compared to the lyocell fibres. The Attenuated Total Reflectance Fourier Transform Infrared (ATR-FTIR) spectroscopy and Wide Angle X-ray Diffraction (WAXD) analyses indicated that the <b>fibres</b> from cotton <b>waste</b> garments had supramolecular properties similar to the typical lyocell fibres. The exception was spun from the cotton pulp reclaimed from easy care treated cotton fabrics and maybe related to increased amorphous cellulose content in its structure. The fibre’s accessibility by reagents behaviour correlated well with the supramolecular properties. The {{results indicate that the}} waste garment purification process may affect the properties of the pulp and hence the supramolecular properties of the resultant fibres. Further research on the purification and regeneration of <b>fibres</b> from <b>waste</b> garments may lead to the use of cotton waste garments as an alternative feedstock source to the lyocell process...|$|R
40|$|Due to a {{shortage}} of wood source fibre in paper making industry's interest to agriculture residues fibre as a potential fibre sources in this industry. In this situation, importance has been developing in the paper industry from agriculture residue that will replace the wood fibre. Cocoa pod husk and Corn stalk are agriculture residues, which is good materials for paper production. The objectives {{of this study are}} to investigate the chemical characterization and surface morphology structure of these materials. The main components of materials which are cellulose, hemicellulose, lignin and ash content were parameters that involved in determination of chemical characterization in this study. The determination of chemical composition was accordance to Kurshner-Hofher approach (cellulose), Chlorine Method (hemicellulose), T 222 om- 06 (lignin) and T 2 1 1 om- 07 (ash content). Scanning electron microscopy was used to observe the surface structure of materials. From results obtained, corn stalk shows the higher amount in cellulose (39 %) and hemicellulose (42 %) content compared to the cocoa pod husk. In addition, lower lignin content also obtained in Corn stalk (7. 3 %) rather than that Cocoa pod husk (14. 7 %). From Scanning electron microscopy images, Corn stalk and Cocoa pod husk contained abundance lignocellulosic and rough surface structure due to the untreated materials. The result either chemical characterization or surface morphology that obtained in Corn stalk and Cocoa pod husk <b>fibre</b> <b>wastes</b> can be used successfully as an alternative fibres sources in papermaking application...|$|R
