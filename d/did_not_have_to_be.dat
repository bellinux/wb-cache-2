5|$|Reginald Yzendoorn, {{author of}} History of the Catholic Mission in the Hawaiian Islands, later wrote that Kaʻauwai was {{a judge and}} Calvinist deacon who related the burning of the Roman Catholic chapel of Wailuku in 1843 to his {{mother-in-law}} Marie Leahi, an early Catholic female catechumen. In the early Hawaiian Protestant mission, deacons <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> licensed to preach.|$|E
5|$|Two earlier {{business}} decisions by the Chicago Sun-Times led to substantial savings {{of time and}} money during the Trump Tower's construction. The original 1950s sea wall was built by the newspaper company to bomb-shelter thickness, to withstand a Cold War attack, and thus <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> broken down and rebuilt. Furthermore, the company decided in the 1970s to switch from petroleum-based to soy-based ink, which reduced ground pollution from the printing plant. This considerably reduced the costs and time for cleaning up the site prior to building anew.|$|E
5|$|The entire works was {{upgraded}} between 1956 and 1969, in five distinct phases. The {{plan was}} announced in January 1956, and was expected to cost £1 million. The first phase was {{the construction of a}} filter pressing plant, for which the main contractor was Norwest Construction Co Ltd, while the actual presses and other plant were supplied by S. H. Johnson and Co Ltd. This phase was completed in 1962, and was officially opened by the Lord Mayor on 14 May 1963. The second phase consisted of a preliminary treatment plant, a storm sewage separation plant, and metering of the flows within the plant. This was completed in 1965. The third phase was split into two parts, which initially involved the building of new primary sedimentation tanks. Once these were operational in 1969, the old sedimentation tanks were converted to become temporary storm sewage tanks. This fourth phase was called phase 3b, and was completed in 1970. The final phase was the construction of a sludge incinerator, which was completed in 1969 and meant that the pressed sewage cake <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> taken to Thrybergh to be dumped.|$|E

5|$|The film {{returns to}} the {{traditional}} gun barrel opening shot, which was altered into {{part of the story}} for Casino Royale where it was moved {{to the beginning of the}} title sequence. In this film the gun barrel sequence was moved to the end of the movie, which Wilson explained was done for a surprise, and to signify the conclusion of the story begun in the previous film. The opening credits sequence was created by MK12. Having worked on Forster's Stranger than Fiction and The Kite Runner, MK12 spontaneously began developing the sequence early on in production, and had a good idea of its appearance which meant it <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> redone when the title singer was changed. MK12 selected various twilight colours to represent Bond's mood and focused on a dot motif based on the gunbarrel shot. MK12 also worked on scenes with graphical user interface, including the electronic table MI6 use, and the Port-au-Prince, Haiti title cards.|$|E
5|$|Yarborough v. Alvarado, 541 U.S. 652 (2004), is a United States Supreme Court case {{in which}} the Court {{declined}} to overturn a state court's conclusion that a minor was not in custody for Miranda purposes during his police interview. Michael Alvarado helped his friend Paul Soto steal a truck in Santa Fe Springs, California. The truck owner was killed by Soto during the robbery and Alvarado was convicted of second-degree murder {{for his role in the}} crime. The evidence for Alvarado's conviction was primarily based on statements given by Alvarado during a two-hour police interrogation that occurred when Alvarado's parents brought him to the police station. Alvarado was 17 years old and was not read his Miranda rights before questioning. During Alvarado's murder trial in a state court, motions to suppress the statements given by Alvarado were denied on the ground that Alvarado was not in police custody at the time of the interrogation and thus <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> read his Miranda rights. Alvarado appealed his conviction, claiming that the determination that he was not in custody was incorrect because the courts did not take his age into account.|$|E
25|$|The fractionally {{numbering}} arose because locks 70-75 {{were completed}} in 1842, before locks 62 and 66. It {{was found that}} the level of the canal between locks 62 and 66 could be raised in three steps instead of four. So the additional locks through there were numbered 1⅓ steps apart (62, 63⅓, 64⅔ and 66) so that the other locks, already completed, <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> renumbered.|$|E

Ideologically, Hoxha found Mao's initial views to be in line with Marxism-Leninism. Mao condemned Nikita Khrushchev's alleged revisionism {{and he was also}} critical of Yugoslavia.

25|$|Survivors {{of ships}} sunk by Allied {{submarines}} frequently refused to surrender, {{and many of}} the prisoners who were captured by submariners were taken by force. US Navy submarines were occasionally ordered to obtain prisoners for intelligence purposes, and formed special teams of personnel for this purpose. Overall, however, Allied submariners usually did not attempt to take prisoners, and the number of Japanese personnel they captured was relatively small. The submarines which took prisoners normally did so towards the end of their patrols so that they <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> guarded for a long time.|$|E

25|$|The North Vietnamese also netted their SA-2 Fan Song fire-control radars {{with their}} Bar Lock, Whiff, and Spoon Rest ground control {{intercept}} (GCI) radars.

25|$|After the Beatles' {{break-up}} in 1970, McCartney recorded two albums: McCartney (1970), {{credited to}} himself, and Ram (1971), with wife Linda.

Ram was recorded in New York City, where McCartney auditioned a number of drummers and guitarists, selecting Seiwell and guitarist David Spinozza. When Spinozza became unavailable due to other session commitments, Hugh McCracken was enlisted to take his place.|$|E

25|$|Charter {{schools are}} state funded schools which operate {{outside of the}} normal state system. They began in 2014 with 5 small schools. Charter schools <b>do</b> <b>not</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> operate with any {{registered}} or trained teachers. Teachers <b>do</b> <b>not</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> current practicing certificates. They <b>do</b> <b>not</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> a principal. They are allowed to benefit from profit making. They <b>do</b> <b>not</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> follow the national curriculum. They receive approximately 3 times the level of funding per student than normal state schools. If the charter school roll drops during the year, the school keeps the extra funding, unlike normal state schools, where funding is matched to students actually attending. If a charter school fails the management/owners are allowed to keep the land and buildings and other capital assets. Charter schools have less compliance with regulations than State schools although teachers must undergo police vetting.|$|R
25|$|All the {{defendants}} were charged in a Common Design of unlawfully and intentionally participating in abuses and killings of {{prisoners of war}} and non-German civilians.

The degree of individual responsibility in the Common Design was determined by acts of excess and rank of the accused. This also influenced the verdict and degree of punishment.|$|E
25|$|In February 1996, {{just before}} the World Cup, Muralitharan {{underwent}} biomechanical analysis at the Hong Kong University of Science and Technology {{under the supervision of}} Prof. Ravindra Goonetilleke, who declared his action legal in the conditions tested, citing a congenital defect in Muralitharan's arm which makes him incapable of fully straightening the arm but gives the appearance of fully straightening it. Although under the original Laws a bowler's arm <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> fully straightened to be an illegal delivery, it was concluded that his action created the 'optical illusion of throwing'. Based on this evidence, ICC gave clearance to Muralitharan to continue bowling.|$|E
25|$|In 1977, county {{officials}} in Nye County tried {{to shut down}} Walter Plankinton's Chicken Ranch as a public nuisance; brothels <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> licensed in that county at the time, and several others were operating. Plankinton filed suit, claiming that the 1971 state law had implicitly removed the assumption that brothels are public nuisances per se. The Nevada Supreme Court agreed with this interpretation in 1978, and so the Chicken Ranch was allowed to operate. In another case, brothel owners in Lincoln County protested when the county outlawed prostitution in 1978, having issued licenses for seven years. The Nevada Supreme Court ruled, however, that the county {{had the right to}} do so.|$|E

25|$|Later {{accounts}} {{reveal that}} the French vessel was the privateer Bellone, of Bordeaux. The reports credit Milbrook with having her carronades fixed on the non-recoil principle (i.e., fixed to the vessel so that the vessel absorbs the recoil and the cannons <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> run out before firing again), enabling Milbrook to fire 11 broadsides before the French vessel could fire three. Bellone had to put into Vigo and reports from there suggested that she had suffered 20 men killed, and her first and second captains and 45 men wounded, out of a crew of 220-260 men. Bellone had been armed with twenty-four 8-pounder guns and six or eight 36-pounder carronades.|$|E
25|$|Meanwhile, {{there was}} an {{modernization}} of the upstream logistics. A breakthrough occurred when it was established that lumber <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> air-dried {{for two years before}} being made to pulp, freeing up a storage site at Veden which had stored up to one million logs. Trucks were introduced in transport and hundreds of kilometers (hundreds of miles) of lumber roads were built to ease extraction. For instance they were used to truck lumber from Store Le to Øymarkasjøen, thus closing the Otteeid Canal. Increased lumber demand was covered through procurement from Värmland and the Glomma watershed. Log driving was eliminated on tributaries and limited to the main course of Haldenvassdraget.|$|E
25|$|The charter {{by which}} the city was governed prior to the 1835 reforms was that granted by Charles I in 1615. This created a {{corporation}} {{by the name of}} the Mayor, Aldermen, Bailiffs and Citizens of the City of Carlisle. There were twelve aldermen, one of whom was elected mayor, two coroners and twenty-four capital citizens. The right of election to the body was vested in the free burgesses, who consisted of members of eight fraternities or trade guilds of the city, namely the Merchants, Tanners, Skinners, Butchers, Smiths, Weavers, Tailors and Shoemakers. Burgesses, of which there were estimated to be about a thousand in 1835, <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> resident in the city.
