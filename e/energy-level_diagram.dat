In the optical trimer structure, we show that the perfect photonic flash can be realized in the situation of resonant driving.

Therefore, both of the C-V curves of green and red devices rise again. At this point, the Langevin recombination {{has happened in the}} EML causing the reduction of internal stored carriers. When the dissipative rate of charges exceeds their injection rates, the accumulated charges reduce rapidly and the C-V curve exhibits a sharp drop. The recombination process is shown in Fig.  6 b, c. For comparison, only one strong peak appears in the capacitance characterize of the blue device, indicating that only the Langevin recombination occurs in the EML.

40|$|We {{develop a}} Feynman rule for <b>energy-level</b> <b>diagrams</b> {{emphasizing}} their {{connections to the}} double-sided Feynman diagrams and physical processes in the Liouville space. Thereby we completely identify such diagrams and processes contributing to the two-dimensional response function in the Brownian oscillator model. We classify such diagrams or processes in quartet and numerically present signals separately from each quartet of diagrams or Liouville-space processes. We find that the signal from each quartet is distinctly different from the others; we can identify each peaks in frequency domain with a certain quartet. This offers the basis for analyzing and assigning actual two-dimensional peaks and suggests the possibility of Liouville-space-path selective spectroscopy. As an application we demonstrate an example in which two familiar homogeneous mechanisms of relaxation are distinguished by existence or non-existence of certain peaks on the two-dimensional map; appearance or disappearance of certain peak is sensitive to the coupling mechanism. We also point out some confusion in the literature with regard to inclusion of relaxation effects...|$|R

Observation of all the optically allowed transitions of the charged exciton allows us to experimentally verify a revised <b>energy-level</b> <b>diagram</b> of spin-split singlet and triplet states. The PL data obtained on all samples are completely consistent with this diagram, leading us to conclude that the negatively charged exciton is a model three-particle system. The binding energy of the negatively charged exciton is measured between 23 and 50 T, and found to be constant for both singlet and triplet states.

40|$|International audience; In {{the long}} bygone days of continuous-wave nuclear {{magnetic}} resonance (NMR) spectroscopy, a selected transition within a multiplet of a high-resolution spectrum could be irradiated by a highly selective continuous-wave (CW) radio-frequency (rf) field with a very weak amplitude ${ω _ 2 }$/(2 π) ≤J. This causes splittings of connected transitions, allowing one to map the connectivities of all transitions within the <b>energy-level</b> <b>diagram</b> of the spin system. Such "tickling" experiments stimulated the invention of two-dimensional spectroscopy, but {{seem to have been}} forgotten for nearly 50  years. We show that tickling can readily be achieved in homonuclear systems with Fourier transform spectrometers by applying short pulses in the intervals between the sampling points. Extensions to heteronuclear systems are even more straightforward since they can be carried out using very weak CW rf fields...|$|E

Flames with temperatures ranging from 1911 to 2886 K were used. The excitation energy values found can be reconciled with the assumption that the lower 1 ∑ state of the optical transitions is the electronic ground state only if there are low-lying electronic levels that contribute at least a factor of 6 to the electronic partition function...|$|E
40|$|Mutants {{of green}} {{fluorescent}} protein (GFP) are usually designed to absorb and emit light as "one color" systems, i. e. with a single, photostable conformation of the chromophore. We have studied two red-shifted GFP-mutants (S 65 T and EYFP) by means of hole-burning and high-resolution optical spectroscopy at low temperature, and compare the data to those previously reported for RS-GFP. We prove that these GFP-mutants are not "one color" systems {{because they can be}} reversibly phototransformed from one conformation into another. The results are rationalized in terms of energy-level schemes that are similar to that previously derived by us for wild-type GFP. In these schemes, each mutant can be interconverted by light among at least three conformations that are associated with the protonation-state of the chromophore. The results have relevance for the study of protein-protein interactions by fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET), where GFP-mutants of different colors are used as labels in donor-acceptor pairs. Furthermore, we present a detailed mechanism that explains the "on-off" and "blinking" behavior of single GFP-molecules with the proposed <b>energy-level</b> <b>diagrams.</b> (C) 2002 Elsevier Science B.

40|$|A spectroscopic {{study of}} Rydberg states of helium (n = 30 and 45) in magnetic, {{electric}} and combined magnetic and electric fields with arbitrary relative orientations {{of the field}} vectors is presented. The emphasis is on two special cases where (i) the diamagnetic term is negligible and both paramagnetic Zeeman and Stark effects are linear (n = 30, B ≤ 120 mT and F = 0 - 78 V/cm), and (ii) the diamagnetic term is dominant and the Stark effect is linear (n = 45, B = 277 mT and F = 0 - 8 V/cm). Both cases correspond to regimes where the interactions induced by the electric and magnetic fields are much weaker than the Coulomb interaction, but much stronger than the spin-orbit interaction. The experimental spectra are compared to spectra calculated by determining the eigenvalues of the Hamiltonian matrix describing helium Rydberg states in the external fields. The spectra and the calculated <b>energy-level</b> <b>diagrams</b> in external fields reveal avoided crossings between levels of different m_l values and pronounced m_l-mixing effects at all angles between the electric and magnetic field vectors other than 0. These observations {{are discussed in the}} context of the development of a method to generate dense samples of cold atoms and molecules in a magnetic trap following Rydberg-Stark deceleration.

Adv., 2015, 1, e 1500425]. We find that both Au kernels of the Au 40 (SR) 24 and Au 52 (SR) 32 nanoclusters can be classified as interpenetrating cuboctahedra. Simulated X-ray diffraction patterns of the RS-AuNPs with the cuboctahedral kernel are collected and then compared with the X-ray diffraction patterns of the RS-AuNPs of two other prevailing Au-kernels identified from previous experiments, namely the Ino-decahedral kernel and icosahedral kernel. The distinct X-ray diffraction patterns of RS-AuNPs with the three different types of Au-kernels can be utilized as signature features for future studies of structures of RS-AuNPs. Moreover, the simulated UV/Vis absorption spectra and Kohn–Sham orbital <b>energy-level</b> <b>diagrams</b> are obtained for the Au 40 (SR) 24 and Au 52 (SR) 32, {{on the basis of}} time-dependent density functional theory computation.

The observed bands have half-widths of 0. 221, 0. 258 and 0. 067 eV for A-, B-, and C-bands, respectively.

Due to the quantum interference effect, we can realize a partially dark optical molecule, where the steady-state mean photon number in one of the cavities achieves zero even under the external driving. And the dark cavity can be changed from one of the cavities to the other by only adjusting the phase difference. Furthermore, we show that when one of the cavities couples with an atomic ensemble, it will be dark under the same condition as that without atoms, but the condition for the other cavity to be dark is modified.

40|$|We have {{measured}} and assigned {{more than 800}} new far-infrared absorption lines and 12 new microwave absorption lines of the ammonia dimer. Our data are analyzed in combination with all previously measured far-infrared and microwave spectra for this cluster. The vibration–rotation–tunneling (VRT) states of the ammonia dimer connected by electric-dipole-allowed transitions are separated into three groups that correspond to different combinations of monomer rotational states: A+A states (states formed from the combination of two ammonia monomers in A states), A+E states, and E+E states. We present complete experimentally determined <b>energy-level</b> <b>diagrams</b> for the Ka= 0 and Ka= 1 levels of each group in the ground vibrational state of this complex. From these, we deduce that the appropriate molecular symmetry group for the ammonia dimer is G 144. This, in turn, implies that three kinds of tunneling motions are feasible for the ammonia dimer: interchange of the "donor" and "acceptor" roles of the monomers, internal rotation of the monomers about their C 3 symmetry axes, and quite unexpectedly, "umbrella" inversion tunneling. In the Ka= 0 A+E and E+E states, the measured umbrella inversion tunneling splittings range from 1. 1 to 3. 3 GHz. In Ka= 1, these inversion splittings between two sets of E+E states are 48 and 9 MHz, while all others are completely quenched. Another surprise, in light of previous analyses of tunneling in the ammonia dimer, is our discovery that the interchange tunneling splittings are large. In the A+A and E+E states, they are 16. 1 and 19. 3 cm^– 1, respectively. In the A+E states, the measured 20. 5 cm^– 1 splitting can result from a difference in "donor" and "acceptor" internal rotation frequencies that is increased by interchange tunneling. We {{rule out the possibility}} that the upper state of the observed far-infrared subbands is the very-low-frequency out-of-plane intermolecular vibration predicted in several theoretical studies [C. E. Dykstra and L. Andrews, J. Chem. Phys. 92, 6043 (1990); M. J. Frisch, J. E. Del Bene, J. S. Binkley, and H. F. Schaefer III, ibid. 84, 2279 (1986) ]. In their structure determination, Nelson et al. assumed that monomer umbrella inversion tunneling was completely quenched and that "donor–acceptor" interchange tunneling was nearly quenched in the ammonia dimer [D. D. Nelson, G. T. Fraser, and W. Klemperer, J. Chem. Phys. 83, 6201 (1985); D. D. Nelson, W. Klemperer, G. T. Fraser, F. J. Lovas, and R. D. Suenram, ibid. 87, 6364 (1987) ]. Our experimental results, considered together with the results of six-dimensional calculations of the VRT dynamics presented by van Bladel et al. in the accompanying paper [J. Chem. Phys. 97, 4750 (1992) ], make it unlikely that the structure proposed by Nelson et al. for the ammonia dimer is the equilibrium structure...|$|R

A ground-state interface dipole at the donor/acceptor heterojunction is present for both systems, but the origin of the interface dipole differs, quadrupole-induced in the case of poly(2 -methoxy- 5 -(3, 7 -dimethyl-octyloxy) - 1, 4 -phenylene vinylene), and ICT state based for poly(3 -hexylthiophene). The presence of bound electron-hole charge carriers (CT states) and/or interface dipoles are expected to enhance exciton dissociation into free charge carriers, thus reducing the probability that charges become trapped by Coulomb forces at the interface followed by recombination. © 2011 IEEE.

However, significantly brighter red emission is observed under 1550 nm pumping and the ratio {{is as high as}} 12. 5, which is most decided by non-radiative decay processes between I- 4 (9 / 2) and I- 4 (11 / 2) levels. In addition, mechanisms of the upconversion by multiphoton absorption and energy transfer processes are discussed based on the <b>energy-level</b> <b>diagram</b> of Er 3 + and upconversion luminescence spectra. These results benefit investigations on upconversion luminescence materials, particularly Er 3 +-doped glasses. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd and Techna Group S. r. l. All rights reserved...|$|E
40|$|A {{detailed}} and systematic electron trapping {{study was conducted}} in the scientifically important wide band-gap materials LuPO 4 and YPO 4 doubly doped with Ce 3 + and Ln 3 + (Ln=Sm, Dy, Ho, Er, Tm). By using vacuum-ultraviolet luminescence spectroscopy and detailed thermoluminescence spectroscopy it was possible to establish by two independent methods that the observed electron traps can be assigned to the Ln 3 + codoping ions. It is shown that the associated electron trap depths are determined by the energy separation between the Ln 2 + ground states and the bottom of the conduction band. Both methods reveal a systematic behavior of electron trap depths {{as a function of the}} type of Ln 3 + codoping ion that can be explained by recently developed empirical models. Small differences in trap depths obtained by the two methods are discussed in the context of charge-transfer induced relaxation processes and uncertainties in glow peak analysis. Our experiments provide valuable information on 4 fn? 4 fn, 4 fn? 4 fn? 15 d, O 2 ??Ln 3 + charge transfer and the lowest-energy PO 43 ? group transitions as well as electron trap depths. These transition energies allowed us to construct a complete <b>energy-level</b> <b>diagram</b> for LuPO 4 :Ln 3 +/ 2 + and YPO 4 :Ln 3 +/ 2 +.

40|$|Abstract: We have {{performed}} ballistic-electron emission microscopy (BEEM) of Pd and Pt Schottky contacts on 6 H- and 4 H-SiC and Pd Schottky contacts on 15 R-SiC. Measured Schottky barrier heights (SBH’s) appear spatially uniform {{up to the}} fitting error due to noise (~ 0. 03 and ~ 0. 1 eV for 6 H- and 4 H-SiC, respectively). In 4 H-SiC, we observed an additional conduction band minimum (CBM) ~ 0. 14 eV above the lowest CBM, which is in good agreement with our band theoretical calculation. Preliminary results on Pd/ 15 R-SiC indicate a higher CBM ~ 0. 5 eV above the lowest CBM, and possibly another higher CBM ~ 0. 3 eV above the lowest CBM. Also, in Pd/ 15 R-SiC, large variations in BEEM spectra at different locations were observed, suggesting an inhomogeneous interface. Additionally, we sometimes observed enhancement in ballistic transmittance over regions intentionally stressed by hot electron injection. We report ballistic-electron emission microscopy (BEEM) measurements of Pd and Pt Schottky contacts on 6 H- and 4 H-SiC, and Pd contacts on 15 R-SiC. The BEEM technique {{is an extension of}} scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) and can be used to probe local electronic properties of buried metal/semiconductor interfaces with nanometer-scale spatial resolution and high energy resolution [1, 2].

40|$|Results {{of crack}} growth {{observations}} on mica in water-containing environments are described. The study focuses on equilibrium crack states for reversed loading cycles, i. e., for initial propagation through virgin solid and subsequent retraction-repropagation through healed or misoriented-healed interfaces. Departures from these equilibrium states are manifest as steady-state forward or backward crack velocities at specific applied loads. The equilibria are thereby interpreted as quiescent, threshold configurations G = W E, with G the Griffith mechanical-energy-release rate and W E the Dupré work of adhesion, on crack velocity (v-G) diagrams. Generally, W E {{is found to}} decrease with concentration of water, in accordance with a Gibbs formalism. Hysteresis is observed in the forward-backward-forward crack propagation cycle, signifying {{a reduction in the}} adhesion energy on exposure of the open interface to environmental species prior to healing. This hysteresis is especially marked for those interfaces that are misoriented before healing, indicating that the structure of the underlying solid substrate {{as well as of the}} intervening fluid is an important consideration in the interface energetics. The equilibrium states for different environments can be represented on a simple <b>energy-level</b> <b>diagram,</b> as differences between thermodynamic end-point states: initial, closed-interface states refer to crystallographic bonding configurations ahead of the crack-tip adhesion zone; final, open interface states refer to configurations behind the crack-tip zone. The significance of this diagram in relation to the fundamental atomic structure of interfaces in fracture and other adhesion geometries, including implications concerning kinetics, is discussed. <br /...|$|E

A novel photosynthetic-antenna-reaction-center model compound, {{comprised}} of BF 2 -chelated dipyrromethene (BODIPY) as an energy-harvesting antenna, zinc porphyrin (ZnP) as the primary electron donor, ferrocene (Fc) as a hole-shifting agent, and phenylimidazole-functionalized fulleropyrrolidine (C(60) Im) as an electron acceptor, has been synthesized and characterized. Optical absorption and emission, computational structure optimization, and cyclic voltammetry studies were systematically performed to establish the role of each entity in the multistep photochemical reactions. The <b>energy-level</b> <b>diagram</b> established from optical and redox data helped identifying different photochemical events. Selective excitation of BODIPY resulted in efficient singlet energy transfer to the ZnP entity. Ultrafast electron transfer from the (ZnP) -Zn- 1 * (formed either {{as a result of}} singletsinglet energy transfer or direct excitation) or C- 1 (60) * of the coordinated fullerene resulting into the formation of the Fc-(C- 60 (-) Im: ZnPC+) -BODIPY radical ion pair was witnessed by femtosecond transient absorption studies. Subsequent hole migration to the ferrocene entity resulted in the Fc(+) -(C- 60 (+) Im: ZnP) -BODIPY radical ion pair that persisted for 7 - 15 ms, depending upon the solvent conditions and contributions from the triplet excited states of ZnP and ImC(60), as revealed by the nanosecond transient spectral studies. Better utilization of light energy in generating the long-lived charge-separated state {{with the help of the}} present "antenna- reaction-center" model system has been successfully demonstrated.
