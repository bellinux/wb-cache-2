6000|$|... § VII. 1. SAVAGENESS. I am {{not sure}} when the word [...] "Gothic" [...] was first generically applied to the {{architecture}} of the North; but I presume that, whatever the date of its original usage, it was intended to imply reproach, and express the barbaric character of the nations among whom that architecture arose. It never implied that they were literally of Gothic lineage, far less that their architecture had been originally invented by the Goths themselves; but it did imply that they and their buildings together exhibited a degree of sternness and rudeness, which, in contradistinction to the character of Southern and Eastern nations, appeared like a perpetual reflection of the contrast between the Goth and the Roman in their first encounter. And when that fallen Roman, in the utmost impotence of his luxury, and insolence of his guilt, became the model for the imitation of civilized Europe, {{at the close of the}} so-called Dark ages, the word Gothic became a term of unmitigated contempt, not unmixed with aversion. From that contempt, by the exertion of the antiquaries and architects of this century, Gothic architecture has been sufficiently vindicated; and perhaps some among us, in our admiration of the magnificent science of its structure, and sacredness of its expression, might desire that the term of ancient reproach should be withdrawn, and some other, of more apparent <b>honorableness,</b> adopted in its place. There is no chance, as there is no need, of such a substitution. As far as the epithet was used scornfully, it was used falsely; but there is no reproach in the word, rightly understood; on the contrary, there is a profound truth, which the instinct of mankind almost unconsciously recognizes. It is true, greatly and deeply true, that {{the architecture of the}} North is rude and wild; but it is not true, that, for this reason, we are to condemn it, or despise. Far otherwise: I believe it is in this very character that it deserves our profoundest reverence.|$|E
6000|$|... § XXXV. If, then, {{considering}} these things, {{any of my}} readers should determine, {{according to}} their means, to set themselves to the revival of a healthy school of architecture in England, and wish to know in few words how this may be done, the answer is clear and simple. First, let us cast out utterly whatever is connected with the Greek, Roman, or Renaissance architecture, in principle or in form. We have seen above, that the whole mass of the architecture, founded on Greek and Roman models, which {{we have been in}} the habit of building for the last three centuries, is utterly devoid of all life, virtue, <b>honorableness,</b> or power of doing good. It is base, unnatural, unfruitful, unenjoyable, and impious. Pagan in its origin, proud and unholy in its revival, paralyzed in its old age, yet making prey in its dotage of all the good and living things that were springing around it in their youth, as the dying and desperate king, who had long fenced himself so strongly with the towers of it, is said to have filled his failing veins with the blood of children;[55] an architecture invented, as it seems, to make plagiarists of its architects, slaves of its workmen, and Sybarites of its inhabitants; an architecture in which intellect is idle, invention impossible, but in which all luxury is gratified, and all insolence fortified;--the first thing {{we have to do is}} to cast it out, and shake the dust of it from our feet for ever. Whatever has any connexion with the five orders, or with any one of the orders,--whatever is Doric, or Ionic, or Tuscan, or Corinthian, or Composite, or in any way Grecized or Romanized; whatever betrays the smallest respect for Vitruvian laws, or conformity with Palladian work,--that we are to endure no more. To cleanse ourselves of these [...] "cast clouts and rotten rags" [...] is the first thing to be done in the court of our prison.|$|E
6000|$|... § XXXI. The {{same answer}} is given, practically, {{by the men}} of this century, to every such question; only the walls with which they enclose {{themselves}} are those of pride, not of prayer. But {{in the middle ages}} it was otherwise. Not, indeed, in landscape itself, but in the art which can take the place of it, in the noble color and form with which they illumined, and into which they wrought, every object around them that was in any wise subjected to their power, they obeyed the laws of their inner nature, and found its proper food. The splendor and fantasy even of dress, which in these days we pretend to despise, or in which, if we even indulge, it is only for the sake of vanity, and therefore to our infinite harm, were in those early days studied for love of their true beauty and <b>honorableness,</b> and became one of the main helps to dignity of character, and courtesy of bearing. Look back to what we have been told of the dress of the early Venetians, that it was so invented [...] "that in clothing themselves with it, they might clothe themselves also with modesty and honor;"[54] consider what nobleness of expression there is in the dress of any of the portrait figures of the great times, nay, what perfect beauty, and more than beauty, there is in the folding of the robe round the imagined form even of the saint or of the angel; and then consider whether the grace of vesture be indeed a thing to be despised. We cannot despise it if we would; and in all our highest poetry and happiest thought we cling to the magnificence which in daily life we disregard. The essence of modern romance is simply the return of the heart and fancy to the things in which they naturally take pleasure; and half the influence of the best romances, of Ivanhoe, or Marmion, or the Crusaders, or the Lady of the Lake, is completely dependent upon the accessaries of armor and costume. Nay, more than this, deprive the Iliad itself of its costume, and consider how much of its power would be lost. And that delight and reverence which we feel in, and by means of, the mere imagination of these accessaries, the middle ages had in the vision of them; the nobleness of dress exercising, as I have said, a perpetual influence upon character, tending in a thousand ways to increase dignity and self-respect, and together with grace of gesture, to induce serenity of thought.|$|E
6000|$|Nor, if we would, {{can we get}} rid of this conviction. We have at {{all times}} some instinctive sense that the {{function}} of one painter is greater than that of another, even supposing each equally successful in his own way; and we feel that, if it were possible to conquer prejudice, and do away with the iniquities of personal feeling, and the insufficiencies of limited knowledge, we should all agree in this estimate, and be able to place each painter in his right rank, measuring them by a true scale of nobleness. We feel that the men in the higher classes of the scale would be, in the full sense of the word, Great--men whom one would give much to see the faces of but for an instant; and that those in the lower classes of the scale (though none were admitted but who had true merit of some kind) would be very small men, not greatly exciting either reverence or curiosity. And with this fixed instinct in our minds, we permit our teachers daily to exhort their pupils to the cultivation of [...] "great art"--neither they nor we having any very clear notion as to what the greatness consists in: but sometimes inclining to think it must depend on the space of the canvas, and that art on a scale of 6 feet by 10 is something spiritually separated from that on a scale of 3 feet by 5;--sometimes holding it to consist in painting the nude body, rather than the body decently clothed;--sometimes being convinced that it is connected with the study of past history, and that the art is only great which represents what the painter never saw, and about which he knows nothing;-and sometimes being firmly persuaded that it consists in generally finding fault with, and endeavoring to mend, whatsoever the Divine Wisdom has made. All which various errors, having yet some motes and atoms of truth in the make of each of them, deserve some attentive analysis, for they come under that general law,--that [...] "the corruption of the best is the worst." [...] There are not worse errors going than these four; and yet the truth they contain, and the instinct which urges many to preach them, are at the root of all healthy growth in art. We ruin one young painter after another by telling him to follow great art, without knowing, ourselves, what greatness is; and yet the feeling that it verily is something, and that there are depths and breadths, shallows and narrows, in the matter, is all that we have to look to, if we would ever make our art serviceable to ourselves or others. To follow art for the sake of being a great man, and therefore to cast about continually for some means of achieving position or attracting admiration, is the surest way of ending in total extinction. And yet it is only by honest reverence for art itself, and by great self-respect in the practice of it, that it can be rescued from dilettantism, raised to approved <b>honorableness,</b> and brought to the proper work it has to accomplish in the service of man.|$|E

5000|$|What {{this means}} is that a {{community}} governed by an honor principle is a community not of rules and procedures but of virtue. As such, it is a community of unfreedom. There is no protected realm; one can never take refuge in, seek protection from, or hide behind a doctrine of rights. Anything that anyone does is, in principle, subject to evaluation. Was it a virtuous thing to do? Was it consistent with notions of <b>honorableness?</b> Does it contribute to the well-being of the community? Is it the kind of behavior that we value and wish to encourage? In the absence of rights, behavior that we do not wish to value and do not wish to encourage has absolutely no protection. Peter J. Steinberger, Former Dean of the Faculty Reed's ethical code is known as [...] "The Honor Principle". First introduced as an agreement to promote ethical academic behavior with the explicit end of relieving the faculty of policing student behavior, the Honor Principle was extended to cover all aspects of student life. While inspired by traditional honor systems, Reed's Honor Principle differs from these in that it is a guide for ethical standards themselves and not just their enforcement. Under the Honor Principle, there are no codified rules governing behavior. Rather, the onus is on students individually and as a community to define which behaviors are acceptable and which are not.|$|E

40|$|The {{current study}} was {{intended}} to discern the importance of ability and morality in a presidential candidate {{and the degree to}} which religiosity predicts valuing these characteristics. As part of a large questionnaire, 258 college students (46 male, 208 female, 4 not reported) completed a measure of intrinsic religiosity (the view that one’s religion is important in itself and not merely for social benefits). Participants also rated the degree to which 10 traits, five pertaining to ability (e. g., intelligence) and five pertaining to morality (e. g., integrity), were among the most important for a presidential candidate to possess, on 9 -point Likert-type scales anchored with the phrases “Strongly disagree” and “Strongly agree. ” All 10 traits were judged to be relatively important, but the degree of importance varied. A descriptive analysis revealed the following means: good judgment (8. 18), knowledgeability (8. 08), self-control (8. 03), <b>honorableness</b> (7. 97), integrity (7. 85), ethicalness (7. 78), intelligence (7. 71), interpersonal skill (7. 30), articulateness (7. 00), and humility (6. 98). Indices were also created by summing the ability traits ( =. 86, mean = 38. 28) and the morality traits ( =. 82, mean = 38. 70). Intrinsic religiosity was correlated with the morality index (r =. 164, p =. 012), and with two of the moral traits, humility (r =. 195, p =. 003) and <b>honorableness</b> (r =. 136, p =. 036). Intrinsic religiosity was not correlated with the ability index or any of the ability traits (all rs 3 ̆c. 044, all ps 3 ̆e. 50).

In a study of young Southern Italians (N = 176; Mage = 16. 17), we found that those who endorsed ideological beliefs related to the <b>honorableness</b> of male violence reported lower intentions to engage in antimafia activities.

Applying honor to business may appear to be a particularly challenging task, since (for reasons I discuss) honor has traditionally been seen as incompatible with commerce. Nonetheless, I argue here that two of the central virtues of the honor ethos—competiveness and magnificence—are perfectly apt ones for rich business executives, who plausibly can be expected to work more for prestige and the thrill of competition than for wealth itself. In addition to making top executives more honorable people, the virtues of competitiveness and magnificence would have positive social effects: honorable competitiveness would intrinsically dispose executives to shun anti-competitive practices, and magnificence would encourage tycoons to redistribute their fortunes voluntarily through philanthropy...|$|E
40|$|The middle-age {{history of}} Dubrovnik {{notified}} frequent conflicts among citizens or between foreigners and citizens. The city had a mixed court council forsolving {{conflicts in the}} region of Dubrovnik hinterland. If court procedures were in Dubrovnik, they took place in front of a Grand Duke and his judges but if outside Dubrovnik, priciples based on charters and agreements were applied. According to the Statute of Dubrovnik in 1272, a Small Council represented both administrative and judiciary power. A member of the Small Council was called an iudex or a consul. Some time later, the Big Council received a more prominent role obtaining the right to choose the judges. Although chosen only among nobility, judges were shortly afterwards separately selected either for civil or criminal cases. Court appeals were sent to the Senate. Marine procedures could be dealt by arbitration courts which developed later into the institution of maritime consulate. Court decisions of certain cases were kept in thorough transcripts with notified damage compensations, punishments types and dispute settlements. It is emphasized in this text that Middle-age courts in Dubrovnik not only passed the official court decisions but acted also as conciliators between the opposing parties in order to peacefully solve conflicts. They had a very subtle sense of justice in avoiding any kind of damage or injury. Determination of Dubrovnik judges for fast and appropriate actions demands our full attention, along with their justice in applying compensations and pronouncing sentences. At that time, Dubrovnik was admired by Europe for its court procedure methods, being the exception from the middle-age darkness, showing justice and <b>honorableness...</b>|$|E
40|$|Esta Tese trata da reconstrução da trajetória republicana do Senado Federal, com o objetivo de demonstrar como a idéia de superioridade atribuída àquela Casa reduziu-se ao longo do tempo e como o Senado brasileiro afastou-se do ‘terreno sagrado’ que ocupava na fase inicial de sua existência, quando era visto como um ambiente ‘sério’ e composto por ‘dignos’ senhores e, por tais características, inviolável diante de sua honradez e respeitabilidade. As reflexões aqui apresentadas basearam-se em referências teóricas de pensadores vinculados à História Cultural. A partir de tal referencial analisou-se parte da documentação disponível sobre a trajetória republicana do Senado Federal, com foco na articulação do discurso sobre ética e decoro parlamentar no período de 120 anos (1889 - 2009) e na explicitação de como os códigos de conduta senatoriais foram construídos e alterados ao longo desses anos. Neste estudo foram analisados alguns casos representativos de práticas conflitantes com a ética e com o decoro parlamentar que resultaram em cassações e renúncias, em perdas de mandato. Nesta reflexão enfatizou-se as características fundamentais do discurso sobre ética e decoro produzido no seio da instituição parlamentar, bem como nos segmentos representativos da sociedade civil e repercutido nos principais veículos de comunicação brasileiros. O período republicano marca o distanciamento do Senado da idéia de ‘sacralidade’, de um ambiente intocado ostentado anteriormente, sendo decisivo para a construção desse novo cenário os fatos inerentes ao processo de democratização verificado no País nas últimas décadas do século XX e início do século XXI (1979 - 2009). Com a democratização explicitaram-se as conseqüências das interferências externas e as mazelas internas produzidas pela própria Instituição. Na democracia os escândalos envolvendo senadores se tornaram frequentes, fazendo com que a idéia de ‘superioridade’ do Senado fosse minimizada e que o status de Câmara Alta e de casa ‘aristocrática’ aos poucos se desfizesse, confirmando assim, o que aqui se denomina como a dessacralização do Senado brasileiro. _________________________________________________________________________________ ABSTRACTThis {{thesis is}} about the {{reconstruction}} of the republican pathway of the Brazilian Senate. Its goal is to demonstrate how the idea of superiority attributed to that Institution has been reduced all over these years and how the Brazilian Senate strayed of the ‘sacred land’ that it had occupied in the beginning of its existence, when it was seen as a ‘serious place’ which was composed by ‘dignified’ gentlemen and inviolable because of those features and before its <b>honorableness</b> and respectability. The reflections presented here had been based on theoretical references of thinkers linked to the Cultural History. From that referential, part of the available documentation of the Federal Senate was analyzed, focusing on the speech articulation about ethics and parliamentary decorum in the period of 120 years (1889 - 2009) and on the explanation of how the senatorial codes of behavior were built and modified throughout these years. In this study were analyzed some representative cases of conflicting practices with the ethic and the parliamentary decorum that resulted in abrogation, renouncements and mandates losses. In this reflection, were emphasized the basic characteristics of the speech on ethics and honor produced in the bosom of the parliamentary institution, {{as well as in the}} representative segments of the civil society, and that was reverberated in Brazilian main communication channels. The republican period marks the Senate detachment from the idea of ‘sacredness’ and of an untouched environment that was previously flaunted, being decisive for the construction of this new scene the inherent facts to the process of democratization verified in the Country in the last few decades of 20 th century and the beginning of 21 st century (1979 - 2009). With the democratization became explicit the consequences of the external interferences and of the internal wounds produced by the Institution. In democracy, scandals involving senators became frequent, minimizing the idea of Senate’s superiority and slowly undoing the status of Upper House and aristocratic house, thus confirming, what here is called the Brazilian Senate’s desecration...|$|E
