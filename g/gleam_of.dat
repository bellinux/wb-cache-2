25|$|A term may be {{omitted from}} a {{well-known}} kenning: val-teigs Hildr “hawk-ground’s valkyrie/goddess” (Haraldr Harðráði: Lausavísa 19). The full expression implied here is “goddess of gleam/fire/adornment of ground/land/seat/perch of hawk” = “goddess of <b>gleam</b> <b>of</b> arm” = “goddess of gold” = “lady” (characterised according to convention as wearing golden jewellery, the arm-kenning being a reference to falconry). The poet relies on listeners’ familiarity with such conventions to carry the meaning.|$|E
25|$|Sometimes {{there is}} a kind of {{redundancy}} whereby the referent of the whole kenning, or a kenning for it, is embedded: barmi dólg-svölu “brother of hostility-swallow” = “brother of raven” = “raven” (Oddr breiðfirðingr: Illugadrápa 1); blik-meiðendr bauga láðs “gleam-harmers of the land of rings” = “harmers of <b>gleam</b> <b>of</b> arm” = “harmers of ring” = “leaders, nobles, men of social standing (conceived of as generously destroying gold, i.e. giving it away freely)” (Anon.: Líknarbraut 42).|$|E

In California of the South (1888), described by David Fine as [...] "one of the earliest booster tracts" [...] Widney and Walter Lindley wrote: [...] "The health-seeker who, after suffering in both mind and body, after vainly trying the cold climate of Minnesota and the warm climate of Florida, after visiting Mentone, Cannes, and Nice, after traveling to Cuba and Algiers, and noticing that he is losing ounce upon ounce of flesh, and his cheeks have grown more sunken, his appetite more capricious, his breath more hurried, that his temperature is no longer normal,... turns with a <b>gleam</b> <b>of</b> hope toward the Occident"—by which they meant Southern California. Many people followed that gleam and found it something more than hope".|$|E
500|$|Burroughs {{continued}} to publicly disagree with Long and his allies, {{and a number}} of his essays dedicated to [...] "sham nature history" [...] were collected in the volume Ways of Nature, published in late 1905. Admitting that his authorial tone had changed since 1903, he wrote in the preface that [...] "My readers will find this volume quite a departure in certain ways from the tone and spirit of my previous books, especially in regard to the subject of animal intelligence. Heretofore I have made the most of every <b>gleam</b> <b>of</b> intelligence of bird or four-footed beast that came under my observation, often, I fancy, making too much of it, and giving the wild creatures credit for more 'sense' than they really possessed." [...] Mabel Osgood Wright weighed in on the debate in a 1905 essay titled [...] "Nature as a Field for Fiction", in which she criticized both sides. Believing that nature writing could imbue animal characters with human qualities in order to better connect with the reader on an emotional level, Wright argued that nature writing should nonetheless strive to be factual and not fantastical.|$|E
500|$|The Birmingham News Mary Colurso complemented Mars' capicity to {{demonstrate}} [...] "major charisma", his vocals, the band who backed {{him up and}} the dynamic atmosphere in the arena. Colurso commented that Mars might not have the most deep and breathtaking music, [...] "but he certainly {{knows how to get}} the party started." [...] Chris Richards of The Washington Post said that it was a [...] "one of those rare, thrilling, upside-down pop concerts", because Mars did not try to recreate the <b>gleam</b> <b>of</b> his most successful tracks, instead he reshaped the songbook at his will, which Richards found amazing. The reviewer also mentioned the wide ranges of genres that Mars approached, including [...] "Motown, new wave, late-’70s funk, mid-’90s R" [...] influenced by pop, which earned him various generations of admirers and fans. However, he criticized the singer for not claiming his own personality through all the [...] "genre-jumping time travel" [...] and for not adding the band name, The Hooligans, on the ticket, as well. Jim Farber from the New York Daily News praised the concert as it tried to recreate the 70's era regarding its entertainment. The reviewer compared it to some acts of that period such as The Jacksons, The Tramps and The Bee Gees. He enlightened Mars' voice matching its [...] "purity, cream and range" [...] to the [...] "mid-period Michael Jackson". Farber compared Mars and Jackson as both of them are [...] "pure entertainers". He pointed, [...] "it hardly seemed to matter that the show wasn’t big on risk or depth." ...|$|E

500|$|After Beckford's {{death on}} 2 May 1844 his younger {{daughter}} Susan Euphemia Beckford, wife of Alexander Hamilton, 10th Duke of Hamilton, removed {{the books and}} greatest treasures to Hamilton Palace and the Tower was put up for sale, however it failed to reach its reserve. In 1847 the tower was sold for £1,000 to a local publican who {{turned it into a}} beer garden. Eventually it was re-purchased by Beckford's daughter, who gave the surrounding land to Walcot parish for consecration as a cemetery in 1848. This enabled the return of Beckford's body from his tomb in Bath Abbey Cemetery, Lyncombe Vale (off Ralph Allen Drive) for reburial near the tower as he had originally wished. His self-designed tomb — a massive sarcophagus of polished pink granite with bronze armorial plaques — stands on a hillock in the cemetery surrounded by an oval ditch and ha-ha. On one side is a quotation from his Gothic novel Vathek: [...] "Enjoying humbly the most precious gift of heaven to man — Hope"; and on another these lines from his poem, A Prayer: [...] "Eternal Power! Grant me, through obvious clouds one transient <b>gleam</b> <b>Of</b> thy bright essence in my dying hour." [...] The Scarlet Drawing Room was converted into a chapel in 1848 to serve the cemetery. In 1864 the Rector of Walcot gave £100 for the repair of tower stonework and in 1884 a similar amount of money for further repairs to {{the upper part of the}} tower, however the condition of the stonework was deteriorating by 1898 and described in 1918 as [...] "piteous and dilapidated".|$|E
500|$|Joe Morgenstern of The Wall Street Journal {{gave the}} film a {{positive}} review, saying [...] "The characters are irresistible, the animation is astonishing and the film, a fantasy {{version of a}} foodie rhapsody, sustains a level of joyous invention that hasn't been seen in family entertainment since The Incredibles." [...] Kenneth Turan of the Los Angeles Times gave the film {{four and a half}} stars out of five, saying [...] "Brad Bird's Ratatouille is so audacious you have {{to fall in love with}} its unlikely hero." [...] Claudia Puig of USA Today gave the film three and a half stars out of four, saying [...] "Ratatouille is delicious fun sure to be savored by audiences of all ages for its sumptuous visuals, clever wit and irresistibly inspiring tale." [...] Miriam Di Nunzio of the Chicago Sun-Times gave the film three and a half stars out of four, saying [...] "Ratatouille will make you wonder why animation needs to hide behind the mantle of 'it's for children, but grownups will like it, too.' This one's for Mom and Dad, and yep, the kids will like it, too." [...] Michael Booth of The Denver Post gave the film three and a half stars out of four, saying [...] "Writer and director Brad Bird keeps Ratatouille moving without resorting to the cute animal jokes or pop-culture wisecracking that ruined so many other recent animated films." [...] Tom Long of The Detroit News gave the film an A, saying [...] "Ratatouille has the technical genius, emotional core and storytelling audacity to lift it into the ranks of [...] Pixar films, the crème de la crème of modern animation." [...] Liam Lacey of The Globe and Mail gave the film three and a half stars out of four, saying [...] "No sketchy backgrounds here – Ratatouilles scenes feels like deep-focus camera shots. The textures, from the <b>gleam</b> <b>of</b> copper pans to the cobblestone streets, are almost palpable." [...] Desson Thomson of The Washington Post gave the film a positive review, saying [...] "Ratatouille doesn't center on the over-familiar surfaces of contemporary life. It harks back to Disney's older era, when cartoons seemed part of a more elegant world with less edgy characters." ...|$|E

During the meeting it was proposed to address a petition to Her Majesty asking her to recall governor Elgin and disavow the indemnification act. In the 1887 account he gave of his participation to the events, some 38 years later, Alfred Perry, the captain of a volunteer corps of firemen, asserted that on that night he stepped on the hustings to speak to the crowd, put his hat on the torch lighting the petition, and exclaimed: [...] "The time for petitions is over, but if the men who are present here are serious, let them follow me to the Parliament Buildings." ...|$|E

2500|$|The work of re-organization over, Marshal Turenne {{began the}} {{campaign}} in June 1644 by crossing the Rhine at Breisach, but almost instantly an army under the Duke of Enghien (afterwards the great Condé) joined him. The Duke, as a prince of the royal house, took the chief command of the united armies of [...] "France" [...] and [...] "Weimar". The four famous campaigns which followed brought to an end the Thirty Years' War. The desperately fought battle of Freiburg against Franz von Mercy's Bavarians (3, 5 and 9 August 1644) proved the chief event of the first campaign, after which the French successfully besieged Philippsburg. Before the capitulation Enghien withdrew and left Turenne in command. The marshal opened the campaign of 1645 with a strong forward movement, but Mercy surprised and defeated him at Mergentheim (Bad Mergentheim) on 2 May. Enghien again came to the front with the army of France, and Turenne's army received substantial reinforcement {{with the arrival of}} a Swedish force and of a contingent from Hesse-Kassel (or Hesse-Cassel). The Swedes soon departed, but Enghien commanded 20,000 men when he met the Bavarians in a battle even more stubbornly contested than Freiburg. The French forces killed Mercy and decisively defeated his army at Allerheim near Nördlingen (3 August 1645). Ill-health forced Enghien to retire soon afterwards, leaving Turenne {{for the third time in}} command of the French army. Again he did not fare well against the larger imperial forces, but the campaign ended with a <b>gleam</b> <b>of</b> success in his capture of Trier (Trèves).|$|E
