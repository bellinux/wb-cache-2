5|$|Bacon {{ice cream}} (or bacon-and-egg ice cream) is {{an ice cream}} {{generally}} created by adding bacon to egg custard and freezing the mixture. The concept of bacon ice cream originated in a 1973 sketch on the British comedy series The Two Ronnies as a joke; however, it was eventually created for April Fools' Day. Heston Blumenthal experimented {{with the creation of}} ice cream, making a custard similar to scrambled eggs then adding bacon to create one of his signature dishes. <b>It</b> <b>now</b> <b>appears</b> on dessert menus in other restaurants.|$|E

25|$|A 1995 Russian {{document}} {{suggested a}} complete production facility had {{been transferred to}} Shanghai, {{for the development of}} a nuclear-armed cruise missile. Originally it was thought that this was based on the 300nbsp&km-range Raduga Kh-15 (AS-16 'Kickback'), but <b>it</b> <b>now</b> <b>appears</b> that it was the Kh-55 that was transferred to China.|$|E

50|$|Allix had {{remained}} {{in contact with}} the GER concerning his scheme, and <b>it</b> <b>now</b> <b>appeared</b> that a line from Cambridge through Mildenhall might be advantageous; if extended east to Thetford it might provide a shortened route between Cambridge and Norwich, avoiding the northward sweep through Ely.|$|R
25|$|As of 15 June 2012, Spain's {{public debt}} stood at 72.1% of GDP, still {{less than the}} Euro-zone average of 88%. If Spain uses the €100 billion credit line to bailout its banks, its debt will {{approach}} 90% of GDP. To avoid this the EU has pledged to lend to banks directly although <b>it</b> <b>now</b> <b>appears</b> that the Spanish government may have to guarantee the loans.|$|E
25|$|To date, Ornitholestes {{is known}} {{only from a}} single partial {{skeleton}} with a badly crushed skull found at the Bone Cabin Quarry near Medicine Bow, Wyoming, in 1900. It was described by Henry Fairfield Osborn in 1903. An incomplete hand was later attributed to Ornitholestes, although <b>it</b> <b>now</b> <b>appears</b> to belong to Tanycolagreus. The type (and only known) species is O. hermanni. The specific name honors the American Museum of Natural History preparator Adam Hermann.|$|E
25|$|The {{extent to}} which mild 3β-HSD CAH can cause early {{appearance}} of pubic hair {{and other aspects of}} hyperandrogenism in later childhood or adolescence is unsettled. Early reports about 20 years ago suggesting that mild forms of 3β-HSD CAH comprised significant proportions of girls with premature pubic hair or older women with hirsutism have not been confirmed and <b>it</b> <b>now</b> <b>appears</b> that premature pubarche in childhood and hirsutism after adolescence are not common manifestations of 3β-HSD CAH.|$|E
50|$|This rather {{shocking}} {{attempt to}} rally the pro-Nazi elements among the German Christians backfired, as <b>it</b> <b>now</b> <b>appeared</b> to many Protestants that the State was attempting {{to intervene in the}} most central theological matters of the church, rather than only in matters of church organization and polity.|$|R

25|$|The Platyzoa {{include the}} phylum Platyhelminthes, the flatworms. These were {{originally}} considered {{some of the}} most primitive Bilateria, but <b>it</b> <b>now</b> <b>appears</b> they developed from more complex ancestors. A number of parasites are included in this group, such as the flukes and tapeworms. Flatworms are acoelomates, lacking a body cavity, as are their closest relatives, the microscopic Gastrotricha. The other platyzoan phyla are mostly microscopic and pseudocoelomate. The most prominent are the Rotifera or rotifers, which are common in aqueous environments. They also include the Acanthocephala or spiny-headed worms, the Gnathostomulida, Micrognathozoa, and possibly the Cycliophora. These groups share the presence of complex jaws, from which they are called the Gnathifera.|$|E
25|$|The Frieze was {{constructed}} between 420 and 400 BC. Unlike {{the rest of}} the temple, the blocks were carved from marble. Each of the 23 stones shows sections of the frieze but it is rare to find any continuation of the design from one stone to the next. It has also been proposed that the stones were not eventually installed as they had originally been proposed in the Temple of Apollo. These two complications are important as when the stones were found they had already fallen to the ground and they were already mixed in with other building rubble. So the stones are arranged in one logical way, {{but it is not clear}} if the frieze was actually either intended or designed to be as <b>it</b> <b>now</b> <b>appears.</b>|$|E
25|$|The Lophotrochozoa, evolved within Protostomia, {{include two}} of the most {{successful}} animal phyla, the Mollusca and Annelida. The former, which is the second-largest animal phylum by number of described species, includes animals such as snails, clams, and squids, and the latter comprises the segmented worms, such as earthworms and leeches. These two groups have long been considered close relatives because of the common presence of trochophore larvae, but the annelids were considered closer to the arthropods because they are both segmented. Now, this is generally considered convergent evolution, owing to many morphological and genetic differences between the two phyla. Lophotrochozoa also includes the Nemertea or ribbon worms, the Sipuncula, and several phyla that have a ring of ciliated tentacles around the mouth, called a lophophore. These were traditionally grouped together as the lophophorates. but <b>it</b> <b>now</b> <b>appears</b> that the lophophorate group may be paraphyletic, with some closer to the nemerteans and some to the molluscs and annelids. They include the Brachiopoda or lamp shells, which are prominent in the fossil record, the Entoprocta, the Phoronida, and possibly the Bryozoa or moss animals.|$|E

60|$|Between one and {{two o'clock}} the Spanish fire abated, and soon ceased altogether. The {{inhabitants}} {{took advantage of the}} lull to hurry back to their houses, whence they removed the lighter and more portable articles; but the heavy stores--of which <b>it</b> <b>now</b> <b>appeared</b> many of them had large quantities concealed--they were, of course, unable to take away.|$|R

Most {{surprisingly}} the innkeepers' story on this occasion proved to be entirely true, a possibility I had never entertained for a second; and furthermore it appeared that our present inn was {{the one in which}} I had been offered rooms but had refused, disliking its exterior.|$|R
500|$|Although Gilbert later had to {{resurface}} the aqueduct, {{the structure}} remained in use {{for more than}} 100 years. In {{the first volume of}} his Lives of the Engineers (1862) Scottish author Samuel Smiles said of the construction that [...] "Humble though <b>it</b> <b>now</b> <b>appears,</b> it was parent of the magnificent aqueducts of Rennie and Telford, and the viaducts of Stephenson and Brunel".|$|E

500|$|Their abdomens bear {{appendages}} {{that have}} been modified into spinnerets that extrude silk from up to six types of glands. Spider webs vary widely in size, shape {{and the amount of}} sticky thread used. <b>It</b> <b>now</b> <b>appears</b> that the spiral orb web {{may be one of the}} earliest forms, and spiders that produce tangled cobwebs are more abundant and diverse than orb-web spiders. Spider-like arachnids with silk-producing spigots appeared in the Devonian period about , but these animals apparently lacked spinnerets. True spiders have been found in Carboniferous rocks from , and are very similar to the most primitive surviving suborder, the Mesothelae. The main groups of modern spiders, Mygalomorphae and Araneomorphae, first appeared in the Triassic period, before [...]|$|E
60|$|And {{presently}} as I recalled what talks we had had, and one {{in particular}} from which <b>it</b> <b>now</b> <b>appeared</b> to me that her coldness had sprung, a light seemed suddenly to break upon my mind, as perchance it hath long ago broken upon {{the minds of those}} who may happen upon these pages, and whose wits in matters amorous are of a keener temper than were mine.|$|R

50|$|On 25 September 1938, Daladier and Bonnet {{returned}} to London for {{another set of}} meetings with British leaders; during this summit, Bonnet said almost nothing. When Britain rejected Hitler's Bad Godesberg ultimatum on 26 September, Bonnet sought to prevent {{the news of the}} British rejection appearing in the French press, as <b>it</b> <b>now</b> <b>appeared</b> that British were pushing the French towards war, and deprived Bonnet of using British pressure as an excuse.|$|R
500|$|Potter was {{sensitive}} to the beginnings and endings of her books and usually avoided the conventional at those key places. The publisher {{did not like the}} Benjamin Bunny ending, but she refused to alter it to their suggested [...] "happily ever after" [...] because such an ending in her estimation was [...] "rather trite" [...] and [...] "inexact". She suggested the last paragraph as <b>it</b> <b>now</b> <b>appears</b> in the book with the comment, [...] "I would like the book to end with the word 'rabbit-tobacco', it is a rather fine word." [...] She rewrote several other passages including twice rewriting the passage depicting Mr. McGregor's discovery of the cat locked in the greenhouse.|$|E
500|$|Floyd Norris of The New York Times {{said the}} cause of the losses was rooted in the Plaza Accord that caused {{the value of the dollar}} to slide from 250 yen in 1984, to 121 yen by the end of 1987, heavily penalising Japanese exports.

500|$|Radio-telescope {{images taken}} in 1998 confirm that Betelgeuse has a highly complex atmosphere, with a {{temperature}} of , similar to that recorded on the star's surface but much lower than surrounding gas in the same region. The VLA images also show this lower-temperature gas progressively cools as it extends outward. Although unexpected, {{it turns out to}} be the most abundant constituent of Betelgeuse's atmosphere. [...] "This alters our basic understanding of red-supergiant star atmospheres", explained Jeremy Lim, the team's leader. [...] "Instead of the star's atmosphere expanding uniformly due to gas heated to high temperatures near its surface, <b>it</b> <b>now</b> <b>appears</b> that several giant convection cells propel gas from the star's surface into its atmosphere." [...] This is the same region in which Kervella's 2009 finding of a bright plume, possibly containing carbon and nitrogen and extending at least six photospheric radii in the southwest direction of the star, is believed to exist.|$|E
60|$|The {{effect was}} evident.
