25|$|Penn {{shifted the}} focus of the works to marine engines. His 40-horsepower beam engines were fitted in the paddle steamers 'Ipswich' and 'Suffolk', and it is likely these were the first marine engines to be {{designed}} and built by Penn. He then focussed on improving the oscillating engine from the version patented by Aaron Manby in 1821. In 1844 he replaced the engines of the Admiralty yacht, HMS Black Eagle with oscillating engines of double the power, without increasing either the weight or space occupied, an achievement which broke the naval supply dominance of Boulton & Watt and Maudslay, Son & Field. His enhanced reputation due to this notable advancement was further augmented by Penn's introduction of trunk engines for <b>driving</b> <b>screw</b> propellers in vessels of war. HMS Encounter (1846) and HMS Arrogant (1848) were the first ships to be fitted with such engines and such was their efficacy that by the time of Penn's death in 1878, the engines had been fitted in 230 ships. Initially, ships were adapted to incorporate these engines, but in 1851, the Navy ordered its first ship specifically designed as a steam-screw auxiliary, HMS Agamemnon. In 1852 the new owners of SS Great Britain decided to recognise the rapid advances in propeller engine technology, and replace the original engines with a pair of smaller, lighter and more modern oscillating engines, designed and built by John Penn and Son.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. This study investigates {{a spiral}} {{polishing}} mechanism in polishing the inner wall of stainless bore with the mixture grinding material of silicon carbide and polystyrene. The delicate polishing process is verified {{to be more}} efficient, cost-saving, and environment friendly than traditional processes. Varied sets of polishing parameters, including SiC grain size, SiC weight, polystyrene(PS) weight, viscosity of silicon oil, revolution speed of the <b>driving</b> <b>screw,</b> and machining time, are examined through the Taguchi Methods for optimum polishing effects. Impacts of different combinations of the six polishing parameters on surface roughness and texture are probed into and analyzed {{in the process of}} the experiment. The findings suggest that with the increase of time, the fluidity and stickiness of the abrasive medium improve, resulting in a finer polished surface within delicate spiral polishing process. It appears that significant differences are observed {{through the use of a}} mixture of 60 grams of SiC (with size of 7 ¬µm) and 70 grams of polystyrene, silicon oil of 1000 mm 2 /s viscosity under the speed of 3500 rpm screw revolution speed for 30 -minute machining time, improving the surface roughness from 0. 90 ¬µm to 0. 158 ¬µm Ra. The finding thus lends support to the effect of spiral polishing mechanism, which can be further developed...|$|E
40|$|AbstractWith {{the aging}} of human society and the rapid {{development}} of transportation industry, the disease rates of bone and joint are also in constant increase, making the biological healing and regeneration of articular cartilage as a core issue of joint surgery in basic and clinical. In general, the regeneration capacity of articular cartilage injury difficult to selfrepair {{is considered to be}} limited. At present, many new technologies and methods have been used for clinical treatment, but it only can relieve the pain of the patients. Human knee joint has two main movement patterns: rolling and sliding. Rolling, as a typical representative of the articular cartilage, is very similar to the mechanical environment in vivo. Accordingly, we first proposed and developed this rolling depression loading device with perfusion system for the mechanobiology researching on in vitro articular cartilage, which includes rolling control system, compression adjusting system and circulating perfusion system. The innovation of the biological reactor is the combination of the rolling loading system and circulation of grouting system. The roll controlling system is achieved by roller rolling back and forth through stepper motor <b>driving</b> <b>screw</b> rod. The compressive system could produce uniform, controlled compressions by relatively sliding of two wedge blocks. The circulating perfusion system is mainly finished by controlling the peristaltic pump. It can provide an environment which is closer to the normal physiological condition of articular cartilage. Rolling depression loading is useful to clarify the pathogenesis of osteoarthritis and apply biomechanical factors to prevent and treat osteoarthritis and repair cartilage. This device is small enough to work in the general culture box, and we will test it with biological experiment in future...|$|E
