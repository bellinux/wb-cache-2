40|$|An {{important}} aspect in generating creative ideas {{is the ability}} of transition from one concept to another concept whose manipulation in certain ways can yield novel viewpoints. Although, the analogical inference has the ability to generate new ideas through a process of carry-over or adaptation from the source onto the target, the certitude in the format of this process may prohibit the generated ideas from being creative in a real sense. To overcome this problem, a new approach is proposed to generating creative ideas based on a two-fold interpretation of the concepts in the source space. According to this approach, first the concepts in the source are interpreted in terms of some concepts in an intermediate space, and the results are then interpreted in terms of the final concepts in the target space. It is observed that the ideas generated in this way are the results of a process, which does not include any <b>direct</b> <b>monologue</b> from the source and the target. More over, the interpretation process discussed above may principally lead to numerous alternatives both in the intermediate and the target spaces. Such ability in generating various alternatives for the final idea provides a high possibility for yielding creative ideas...|$|R

40|$|The paper {{investigates the}} stylistic {{features}} of narrative procedure in a psychological short {{story in the}} context of its interpretation in the teaching of the Serbian language and literature. The narrative procedure in a psychological short story is characterized by the use of the first person in narrating, that is I form, an interior <b>monologue</b> and <b>direct</b> interior <b>monologue,</b> dreams, oversights and introspective. It is also characterized by a particular sentence structure, of often incomplete and elliptical form, used to express the conflicts going on in characters' inner sphere and verbal interaction between the characters. The narrative procedure applied in a psychological short story indicates that its plot is subdued to the internal psychological experiences. During the interpretation of a psychological short story students, through the interpretation of stylistic and narrative procedures, are directed and encouraged to discover complex and often hidden psychological mechanisms which spur the characters to act, influence their behavior, verbal expression and mutual relations. The interpretation of language signs which may have psychological and semantic potential leads to the revealing of unconscious internal psychological processes and mechanisms which take place within a literary character...|$|R
60|$|Murmur, murmur, rippled the child's happy low-toned <b>monologue</b> <b>directed</b> to her silent but {{sufficient}} playmate, and so {{far from}} disturbing the aunt, {{that more than one}} smile played on her lips at the quaint fancies, and at the well of gladness in the young spirit, which made day after day of the society of a cripple and an old doll, one constant song of bliss, one dream of bright imaginings. Surely it was an equalization of blessings that rendered little lonely Rose, motherless and well nigh fatherless, poor, with no companion but a crippled aunt, a bird and a toad, with scarcely a toy, and never a party of pleasure, one of the most joyous beings under the sun, free from occasions of childish troubles, without collisions of temper, with few contradictions, and with lessons rather pleasure than toil.

5000|$|According to Dujardin, {{the idea}} was to {{represent}} a character's thoughts as directly as possible, with the least possible mediation from an author—thoughts were to be represented as if they were a <b>monologue</b> <b>directed</b> at no one, and the author was not to comment on any of it. Syntax was of no concern, since the thoughts were to be {{as close as possible to}} the character's unconscious. Lawrence Edward Bowling points out that Dujardin's arguments actually covered a wide range of possible interiority, since the character's words are at the same time almost-conscious speech as well as almost-unconscious unordered thought. Bowling distinguishes between [...] "stream of consciousness" [...] and [...] "interior monologue" [...] and finds both in the novel; the former, he says, occurs clearly and most perfectly in a dream sequence (when [...] "the mind drops below the level of language usage and functions by means of pure images and sensations"), but much of the other material in the novel is thought turned so consciously into language that it is far from unmediated.|$|R
50|$|Del Río Reyes's {{successful}} {{acting career}} in theater {{was launched in}} 1952 with her debut in the play, Contigo, pan y cebolla by Manuel Eduardo de Gorostiza in the Palacio de Bellas Artes, alongside Manolo Fábregas and {{under the direction of}} Salvador Novo. She would go on to have roles in other plays such as Un día de octubre by George Kaiser; Empire State by Lino Landy; La molinera de Arcos by Alejandro Casona; El juicio by Alfredo Pacheco Buenrostro, and Por el ojo de una aguja by Carlos Prieto, among others. In 1957, Del Río Reyes wrote her first drama Fraude a la tierra, a monologue that addresses the hardships of the Mexican emigrant laborers. She took it to Moscow and assumed the role of director and actress. It premiered on August 3 in the Malenki Theater during a festival. After returning from her first trip to Europe, she realized that the type of dramatic activity that gave her more satisfaction was writing. However, she still fulfilled the previous commitment to act in Fuenteovejuna by Lope de Vega and directed by Alvaro Custodio, even though it would be her last performance. Two years later, Del Río Reyes <b>directed</b> her <b>monologue</b> Fraude a la tierra in the Instituto Regional de Cuernavaca, with one of her theater students playing the role of the female protagonist. She became a collaborator in 1958 for the cultural supplement section of the newspaper Excélsior in Mexico City where she published daily interviews. That same year, she set in motion her teaching career as professor of dramatic arts in the Secretaría de Educación Pública (SEP). Her new position {{was the result of a}} project designed to teach courses to manual laborers in Ciudad Sahagún. Shortly thereafter, she would join the Instituto Nacional de Bellas Artes (INBA) as professor of dramatic arts, teaching her classes in the Centro de Iniciación Artística in Cuernavaca and in the one in Atzcapotalco. As a drama critic, Del Río Reyes published during a period of ten years (1958-1968), the column Diorama teatral in the supplement Diorama de la Cultura of the newspaper Excélsior, using the pen-name Mara Reyes. She joined the teaching body at the Escuela de Arte Teatral de Bellas Artes in Mexico City where she remained as a professor until 1972.|$|R
40|$|Selina {{sent me a}} poem she’d written called “E-mailing Albert ” (see Marsh, this issue, 252). It’s a great poem, a kind of ode or <b>monologue,</b> <b>directed</b> {{specifically}} at Albert Wendt, outlining the frustrations and questions of a relatively new Pacific woman scholar working in the hallowed corridors of an English department in which Albert himself worked {{for a number of}} years. I love Selina’s poem, and I love the way the poem is both an e-mail to Albert and an “e-mail ” about Albert. I love the way Al is the alleged recipient /addressee of the e-mail but really it’s intended for all of us. I especially love the juxtaposition between the reverence in which he is held and the accessibility implied by the production of an e-mail called “E-mailing Albert. ” I’d never write it myself. I’d never write a poem called “E-mailing Albert. ” I’ve probably only e-mailed Albert about three times in my entire life. I don’t e-mail Albert because I’m shy around him: he’s a genius, amaz-ing, imposing, charismatic, compelling. When I’m hanging out with most people, I am normal and able to string a sentence together; when I’m talking to him, I am that eighteen-year-old first-year university student in his New Zealand Literature lectures all over again. I don’t e-mail Albert because back in Auckland, when I took his undergrad classes, or his writing course, or his Pacific Literature master’s class, e-mail hadn’t yet become the domi-nant mode of communication between teacher and student that it is today. I also don’t e-mail Albert because he hasn’t been my research supervisor or boss so I haven’t established a regular online relationship with him around logistical things, like times to meet and tasks to finish. These days, if I am going to write an e-mail to someone in the area of Pacific literary studies, it’s far more likely to be Selina, or Teresia, or Anna Christiansen...|$|R
40|$|Die vorliegende Masterarbeit beschäftigt sich mit drei verschiedene Kommunikationseben in zwei Werken des englischen Autors Henry Green – Loving (1945) und Doting (1952). Die Analyse basiert auf den narrativen Kommunikationseben die Manfred Jahn in seinem Buch Narratology: A Guide to the Theory of Narrative postuliert. Es werden folgende drei Kommunikationseben vorgestellt: 1. die Aktionsebene, welche die Kommunikation zwischen den Charakteren der Geschichte beinhaltet, 2. die fiktionale Diskursebene, die den Diskurs zwischen Erzähler und Zuhörer erfasst, und 3. die non-fiktionale Kom-munikation, welche die Kommunikation zwischen Autor und Leser betrachtet. Das komplexe Zusammenspiel dieser drei Kommunikationsebenen ist ein wichtiger Bestandteil in den Werken des Schriftstellers Henry Green, der zwar heutzutage schon beinahe in Vergessenheit geraten ist, in Fachkreisen jedoch nach wie vor berüchtigt für seine stilistischen Eigenheiten ist: seine umfangreiche Bildsprache, seine zahlreichen Bildmontagen sowie seine ausgeklügelte Erzähltechnik. Das Theoriekapitel bietet einen Überblick über den narratologischen Rahmen mit Hilfe welches Greens Texte analysiert und interpretiert werden. Der Theorieteil beschäftigt sich mit Erzählsituationen (Erzählfiguren und Fokalisierung), Erzählperspektiven (Rede, Bericht, Beschreibung, Kommentar), Erzählformen (innerer Monolog, erzählender Monolog, direkte Rede, indirekte Rede, etc.) und den drei verschiedenen Kom-munikationsebenen (Aktionsebene, fiktionale Kommunikationsebene, non-fiktionale Kommunikationsebene). Mit Hilfe der erarbeiteten Kommunikationstheorie und den vorgestellten Kommunikationsmodellen von David K. Berlo, Roman O. Jakobson, Paul Watzlawick und Herbert Paul Grice wird erläutert, wie Kommunikation stattfindet und was erfolgreiche Kommunikation ermöglicht oder verhindert. Der analytische Hauptteil dieser Masterarbeit untersucht detailliert die verschiedenen Kommunikationsebenen in Greens Texten Loving und Doting. Anhand dieser beiden Texte werden die drei verschiedenen Kommunikationseben im Detail analysiert: Aktionsebene (Charakter-Rede-Charakter), fiktionale Diskursebene (Erzähler-Geschichte-Zuhörer) und non-fiktionale Kommunikation (Autor-Text-Leser). Mein Schwerpunkt hierbei liegt bei folgenden Fragen: wie ist die Erzählung aufgebaut? Welche Arten des Erzählens werden für welche Ziele genutzt? Welche Schwierigkeiten gefährden den Erfolg des Kommunkationsprozesses? Wo und wie wird aus Kommunikation letztendlich Fehlkommunikation? Diese Masterarbeit thematisiert und konzentriert sich vorwiegend auf die narrativen Formen und Funktionen. Mein Hauptaugenmerk, um vorherrschende Fehlkommunikation aufzuzeigen, liegt demzufolge in der Aktionsebene – in der Kommunikation zwischen Greens Charakteren. This thesis {{discusses}} the {{different levels of}} communication in two literary narratives of Henry Green. Although relatively little known today, Green is noted for his enigmatic writing style and stylistic idiosyncrasies: metaphorical language, extensive use of images and montage as well as elaborate narrative techniques. Literary narrative communication comprises a complex interplay of different communicative levels. In this thesis I shall focus on three different types of literary narrative communication, based on the standard structure of fictional narrative communication defined by Manfred Jahn in Narratology: A Guide to the Theory of Narrative. Within the scope of my thesis I will consider: the communicative acts and strategies employed by {{the characters in the}} narrated story, the narrative discourse between narrator and narratee as well as, the literary conversation between author and implied or actual reader. The complex interplay of these levels of communication is a key concept in Green’s writing. A theory chapter shall offer an overview of the narratological framework in Green’s texts, exploring literary techniques such as narrative situations (i. e., narrative voice and focalization), narrative modes (i. e., speech, report, description and comment), different types of the representation of consciousness in literary texts (i. e., interior <b>monologue,</b> narrated <b>monologue,</b> <b>direct</b> discourse, indirect discourse and psychonarration) and the different levels of literary communication (i. e., the level of nonfictional communication, the level of fictional mediation and the level of action). With the help of communication theory and formal communication models by David K. Berlo, Roman O. Jakobson, Paul Watzlawick and Herbert Paul Grice, I will show how communication is thought to work and what makes successful communication possible. The main part of my thesis investigates in greater detail the respective levels of literary communication in two of Henry Green’s texts: {{on the basis of the}} novels Loving and Doting I will analyse three different levels of communication: the level of action (character-speech-character), the level of fictional mediation (narrator-story-narratee) and the level of nonfictional communication (author-text-reader). My focus will be on questions such as: How is the narrative in the book constructed? Which types of discourse are used to fulfil which aim? What are the difficulties that threaten the success of the communication process? Where and how does communication turn into miscommunication? That is to say, I will mostly concentrate on the presentation of narrative forms and functions. The discourse analysis of the theory chapter will be used as the general foundation of this discussion. My main concern throughout will be on scenes of social intercourse between Green’s characters in order to portray the prevalent failure to communicate successfully...|$|R
