50|$|<b>Foredge</b> {{shelving}} (or fore-edge shelving) {{is a book}} shelving technique. Books {{are typically}} shelved upright with the spines facing outwards. However, when a book is too tall to stand upright on a shelf it may be shelved horizontally, i.e., flat, or with the spine resting on the shelf (spine shelving), or alternatively with the <b>foredge,</b> i.e., {{the part of the}} book opposite the spine, resting on the shelf, (<b>foredge</b> shelving).|$|E

50|$|<b>Foredge</b> {{shelving}} may {{damage the}} spine and joints of a book. A possible reason {{for doing it}} was that leaving the spine facing up {{makes it easier to}} see the call number, which is usually located on the spine.|$|E

50|$|Spine {{shelving}} is a book-shelving technique. Books {{are usually}} shelved upright with the spines facing out; when {{a book is}} higher than the shelf, it is usually placed sideways. Putting a book with the spine down is called spine shelving; and the opposite is called <b>foredge</b> shelving.|$|E
50|$|The Northeast Document Conservation Center (NEDCC) {{recommends}} that books {{should never be}} stored on the <b>foredge.</b> Instead, {{it is recommended that}} either the shelves should be rearranged to accommodate the books standing upright, or the books should be moved to other shelves that can accommodate the books standing upright.|$|E
