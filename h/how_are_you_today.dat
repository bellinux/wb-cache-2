[...] The album was a double-platinum selling Canadian record. It earned MacIsaac a 1996 Juno in the category Best Roots & Traditional Album – Solo. During his early career, MacIsaac subtly acknowledged his sexual identity, sometimes wearing a set of rainbow flag freedom rings on a neck chain in promotional photos, but avoided explicitly coming out to the press. He officially came out in 1996 after Frank, a Canadian gossip magazine, published a cover story about his sexuality. In 1996, in a Maclean's interview, he claimed that he had discussed his sexual life, including his young boyfriend and a claimed fondness for watersports, {{in an interview with}} the LGBT newsmagazine The Advocate.

In fact, organizations that have measured organizational climate and engagement have on average 21 % higher levels of productivity than those with disengaged employees. They also have significantly lower turnover of employees, lower absenteeism, and significantly fewer safety incidents. Understanding and measuring your current organizational climate allows you to see <b>how</b> <b>you</b> <b>are</b> doing <b>today</b> and develop specific behaviors and practices to create a highly effective organization that gets results. In this session, we will discuss the research on engagement, some methods of measuring it, and how leaders lead their businesses to a more fulfilling and productive climate...|$|R
40|$|Depression in {{adolescence}} and adulthood is common, afflicting up to 20 {{percent of the}} population. It represents a significant public health concern and is associated with considerable suffering and functional impairment. Adolescent-onset depression {{tends to be a}} particularly malignant and recalcitrant condition, increasing the likelihood of recurrence in adulthood. Adolescence being in a transitional period from childhood to adulthood is a stage of emotional instability resulting from demand for separation and independence. Evidence suggests that early intervention for depression in children can improve long-term outcomes. Therefore, careful assessment and differential diagnosis is essential. In this experiment, an investigation into the potential use of questions to survey the effects of our region on depression levels {{in adolescence}}s and adults will be used to collect qualitative data. A survey will also be conducted which includes multiple students and teachers from around the school by asking a series of questions: <b>how</b> <b>are</b> <b>you</b> feeling <b>today,</b> do <b>you</b> have little interest or pleasure in completing tasks or activities, <b>are</b> <b>you</b> feeling bad about yourself, have you ever felt like <b>you</b> <b>are</b> a failure, have you let yourself or your family down? The answers to these questions will help determine the data needed to analyze whether your region can affect your depression levels. Upon calculating the results of the survey, further research will be conducted in order to discover the amount of depression upon adolescences and adults in a more impoverished region outside of the Eastern Kentucky Coalfield region...|$|R

40|$|This {{research}} aims to: (a) develop English learning materials {{based on}} Astabrata for nursing program in Asper Cipta Bhakti Husada, (b) {{to know the}} students target needs and learning needs of developing English learning materials for the nursing program, (c) explore quality (content of the materials, presentation, and language) product of the English module based on astabrata. This is a research and development (R&D) study. It is mixed of the model presented by Borg and Gall with the systematic design of instruction by Dick and Carey. This study was conducted at Cipta Bhakti Husada Center and its branch. The data were collected using an interview guide, evaluation checklist, and questionnaires of teacher, students and expert responses. The needs analysis questionnaire was used to obtain the data about the students’ needs and the try-out questionnaire was used to gain information about the students’ agreement towards the materials. The data obtained were analyzed qualitatively and quantitatively. The results of the target needs indicate that most students prefer to the topics related to desease, medicine, midwifery and hospital. The result of learning needs points out that materials and activities needed by the students are about nursing tasks and medical equipment. The material consists of four units. Each of the unit has two astabrata characters. First, I <b>am</b> Looking After <b>You</b> <b>Today</b> (conversation). It has earth characters which are helpful and caring, and stars characters which are precise and honest. Second, <b>How</b> <b>are</b> <b>You</b> Feeling <b>Today</b> (recount text). It has sun characters which are communicative, warm and emphaty, and wind characters which are curious and carefully. Third, Medical Equipment and Disease (procedure text) has fire characters which are firm and strict, and sea characters which are creative and innovative. Fourth, Congratulations! <b>You</b> <b>are</b> Allowed to Go Home Today (information report text). It has moon characters which are friendly and good looking, and cloud characters which are kind and wise. The unit has eight components: unit title, objectives, warm-up, main activities, summary, reflection, evaluation, and cultural value of astabrata. The first draft was validated by two experts. The first is culture expert to correct Astabrata. The second is curriculum, media, and English education expert to correct the whole material. The product is revised before it was tried out. The first try-out data of the second draft show that the draft is “good” because the average score is within the data interval 2. 52 - 3. 27. The field-trial of the third draft is considered “very good” because it is indicated by average score within the interval of ≥ 3. 28. ...|$|R

40|$|In 1995, fiddler Ashley MacIsaac {{released}} the album Hi, <b>How</b> <b>Are</b> <b>You</b> <b>Today?</b> that featured MacIsaac performing traditional Celtic tunes accompanied by modern rock instruments. The musical genre transformation {{on the album}} (notable because {{people who were not}} fans of Celtic music bought this album, tracks were released for airplay, and music videos accompanied the singles) can be studied according to the types of genre transformation outlined by Alastair Fowler in Kinds of Literature. If MacIsaac's goal was to offer a popular rock album while playing traditional tunes on the fiddle, critics and members of his audience inevitably questioned his motivation, from which charges of pandering and exploitation followed. Alternate interpretations stressed that MacIsaac was merely adapting traditional music to reflect a changing musical climate. This thesis examines such perspectives, along with the global phenomenon of modernizing folk music amidst the ambiguous boundary between popular and folk musical genres...|$|E

40|$|<b>How</b> <b>are</b> <b>you</b> <b>today?</b> The {{question}} was asked on a website {{by the artist}} Erik Krikortz, and the answers were displayed as a light show on a building complex in central Stockholm. In this thesis more than 20000 people have rated their subjective well-being on their own chosen occasions, on a seven graded scale of smileys in different colours. Results from November 2007 were analysed. The most frequently chosen colour was yellow, symbolising slightly better moods than average. Comparing means between {{days of the week}} showed that people feel the best on Sundays and are least happy on Tuesdays. Posthoc tests indicated significant dips in well-being on two days of the month. After answering the main question participants could also choose to rate their subjective experience of how well their sleep, family and friends, physical activity, stress levels and inspiration had been that day. The variables with the highest correlation with well-being were found to be “inspiration” and “family and friends”. Lowest were correlations for “sleep” and “physical activity”. The last variable was blank, for people to fill out for themselves and rate. The most frequently used word here was by far “love”, followed by “work” and “weather”. Summing up the results it seems social activities means most for the subjective well-being...|$|E
40|$|The {{supermarket}} doors automatically whirl {{open and}} two friends find themselves facing each another. Linda, with empty hands, just enter ing the store, warmly greets Patty. “How are you, it’s been so long!” Patty, pushing a loaded grocery cart with one hand, dragging a two-year-old {{through the door}} with the other hand, and trying to keep a newborn in a Snugli balanced on her chest, responds, “Just fine, thank you and how are you? ” Linda looks at the baby and moves on into the store. Patty continues to carefully navigate her way through the door. Ida has severe arthritic pain. It’s time to consult her physician because the old prescriptions and the usual home remedies have not given any relief. Moving with difficulty, she enters her doctor’s office using two canes. She grimaces as she lowers herself to the chair in the examina tion room and props her canes up beside her. Her doctor comes into the room. They have great affection for each other. These bad bouts have been frequent. He nods hello to her as he enters the room, turns his back, and washes his hands. His muffled voice, coming from somewhere {{out of the back of}} his head, asks, “Well Ida, <b>how</b> <b>are</b> <b>you</b> <b>today?</b> ” Ida replies, “Fine, thank you and how are you?” Elaine recovering from a bout of pneumonia responds to her hairdresser’s “How are you? ” with a “Not too fantastic. ” Her hairdresser, without listening or thinking, replies, “That’s good, ” and starts to wash Elaine’s hair. In a twinkling, she realizes what has happened and says, “Oh I’m sorry, I thought you were saying, ‘not too bad, ” and she continues to wash Elaine’s hair. Clearly all these people are socially correct in recognizing the other with “How are you? ” Undoubtedly each individual not only greets the other but also wishes the individual well. But at the same time imagine not helping an overburdened mother through a door when you can clearly see she needs help. Why tell the doctor you are fine when you are most unwell? Even when the hairdresser realizes her mistake she doesn’t pursue the response...|$|E
