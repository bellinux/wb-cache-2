He and former PayPal colleague, Russel Simmons, who was also working at MRL Ventures, began brainstorming on <b>how</b> <b>to</b> <b>create</b> an online community where users could share recommendations for local services. Stoppelman and Simmons pitched the idea to Levchin who provided $1 million in initial funding. Under Stoppelman's leadership, Yelp grew to a market capitalization of $4 billion and hosted 138 million user reviews.|$|E

5|$|Sabrina's {{education}} {{has been compared to}} George Bernard Shaw's Pygmalion, which may have been inspired by her story. Strong parallels have also been drawn between Sabrina's upbringing and two novels of 1871: Henry James's Watch and Ward, and Anthony Trollope's Orley Farm. The story of Sabrina's life has been told in Wendy Moore's 2013 book <b>How</b> <b>to</b> <b>Create</b> the Perfect Wife and dramatised in the 2015 BBC Radio 4 play The Imperfect Education of Sabrina Sidney.|$|E

5|$|The {{series was}} {{originally}} {{developed as a}} comedy sketch by Alan Resnick, {{as part of his}} comedy tours with the Baltimore-based art collective Wham City, best known for their work with Dan Deacon. The skit, first conceived in 2009 and roughly modeled after TED Talks, features Resnick telling the audience <b>how</b> <b>to</b> <b>create</b> a complete digital backup of himself. Long-time associate Ben O'Brien co-produced, directed and edited the special along with Resnick. In addition, both co-produced the episode under their video production division, AB Video Solutions. Resnick, along with set decorator Emma Alamo, transformed Resnick's house into the set of the special.|$|E
5|$|Wanting {{readers to}} know that the stone mask and its powers would be what would drive the plot, Araki started the manga with a prologue {{involving}} the mask, focusing on communicating the mood, rather than the standard way of opening a manga with an introduction of the protagonist. The concept of the Hamon power was created as he thought about <b>how</b> <b>to</b> <b>create</b> drawings that show the invisible; he {{came up with the idea}} of a character punching a frog, which was left unharmed, while the rock underneath cracked open, thus showing the supernatural power of the character's abilities. It was also influenced by his love for karate manga, with the supernatural moves used within them.|$|E
5|$|Leto {{played his}} first video {{game at the}} age of five, playing Super Mario Bros. In his early teens he played and won local video game competitions. At the age of 17, he broke the world record for points scored in the video game Crazy Taxi, and when Twin Galaxies, which records video game records, wanted more proof, he {{recorded}} a video of beating his own record. He then spent the next year focused on breaking video game records and eventually broke 742 of them. He had the highest number of records ever achieved until Tom Duncan surpassed him. Originally Zyos was interested in going to DigiPen Institute of Technology to learn <b>how</b> <b>to</b> <b>create</b> video games, but found it intense and that it was not his passion. Having dropped out of college, he later left his job at an ice cream shop at age 19 and began pursuing a career in professional gaming. In late 2002 Leto competed at AGP1, his first video game tournament, and though his team placed fifth, he ranked second individually out of three hundred players.|$|E

5|$|Prague-born Wilhelm Steinitz {{beginning}} in 1873 described {{how to avoid}} weaknesses in one's own position and <b>how</b> <b>to</b> <b>create</b> and exploit such weaknesses in the opponent's position. The scientific approach and positional understanding of Steinitz revolutionized the game. Steinitz {{was the first to}} break a position down into its components. Before Steinitz, players brought their queen out early, did not completely develop their other pieces, and mounted a quick attack on the opposing king, which either succeeded or failed. The level of defense was poor and players did not form any deep plan. In addition to his theoretical achievements, Steinitz founded an important tradition: his triumph over the leading German master Johannes Zukertort in 1886 is regarded as the first official World Chess Championship. Steinitz lost his crown in 1894 to a much younger player, the German mathematician Emanuel Lasker, who maintained this title for 27years, the longest tenure of all World Champions.|$|E
5|$|The {{original}} Pool of Radiance game shipped with a 28-page introductory booklet, {{which describes}} secrets {{relating to the}} game and the concepts behind it. The booklet guides players through the character creation process, explaining <b>how</b> <b>to</b> <b>create</b> a party. The game also included the 38-page Adventurer's Journal, which provides the game's background. The booklet features depictions of fliers, maps, and information that characters see in the game. The package also included a translation decoder wheel. After the title screen, a copy protection screen was displayed consisting of two pictures and a line. The player was required to use the decoder wheel to line up the pictures, then enter the word revealed on the decoder wheel. After three unsuccessful attempts, the game automatically shut down.|$|E
5|$|Using the Geneforge {{to empower}} {{himself and his}} followers, the Barzites, Barzahl intends to bestow god-like {{abilities}} on himself and his followers within the city of Rising. Barzahl cut off contact with Drypeak, preparing to repel the inevitable assault of the Shaper Council, who they wish to remain independent from. The Takers, a faction of intelligent serviles who had originated on Sucia Island, were given powers by Barzahl because they worked for him. In turn the Takers created powerful dragon-like beasts called drakons, taught the drakons <b>how</b> <b>to</b> <b>create</b> life themselves, and betrayed Barzahl. The Takers stand for the total destruction of the Shaper Council. The Awakened, the other servile faction in Geneforge 2, believe that Shapers should treat them as equals. They had {{been working with the}} Barzites, but the Awakened's leader Learned Pinner rejected the Barzites' view that serviles need to be controlled. Trade and communications between Zakary's now Shaper Council loyalist Drypeak and the other three factions have ceased, replaced with spies and subterfuge. The player is free to decide which faction they wish to join, if any, and to explore the game world, reacting to the characters and situations they encounter.|$|E

5|$|Meanwhile, Claire is {{reunited with}} Sherry and discovers that the mutated Birkin has {{implanted}} his daughter with an embryo to produce offspring. Leon, Ada, Claire and Sherry advance through an abandoned factory connected to Umbrella's secret underground research facility. An attack by Birkin leaves Ada heavily wounded, and Leon explores the laboratory {{to find something}} to treat her wounds. He is interrupted by a psychotic Annette, who explains to him that Ada's relationship with John was only a means of getting information about Umbrella: Ada is a spy sent to steal the G-virus for an unknown organization. Just as Annette is about to shoot Leon, the Tyrant appears, and she is forced to retreat. Ada returns to save Leon and battles the Tyrant – which falls into a pit of molten metal – seemingly at the cost of her own life. She confesses her love to Leon, who leaves behind her motionless body. Meanwhile, Annette tries to escape with another sample of the G-virus but is fatally wounded by her mutated husband. However, before she dies, she tells Claire <b>how</b> <b>to</b> <b>create</b> a vaccine that will stop the mutations caused by the embryo within Sherry. After preparing the cure, Leon and Claire reunite at an emergency escape train and inject Sherry with the vaccine, which saves her life. En route, Leon is assisted in terminating the now-mutated Tyrant by a woman in shadow, implying Ada's survival and escape with the G-virus in the pendant. Birkin– now mutated into a large agglomeration of flesh and teeth– follows the protagonists, but is destroyed when a self-destruct system causes the train to explode. After escaping from the city with Sherry, Leon intends to take down Umbrella, while Claire continues to search for her brother. Hunk, one of the special agents sent by Umbrella, is able to successfully complete his G-virus retrieval mission.|$|E
