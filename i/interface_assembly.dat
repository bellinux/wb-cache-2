40|$|SummaryAdherens junctions, which play {{a central}} role in {{intercellular}} adhesion, comprise clusters of type I classical cadherins that bind via extracellular domains extended from opposing cell surfaces. We show that a molecular layer seen in crystal structures of E- and N-cadherin ectodomains reported here and in a previous C-cadherin structure corresponds to the extracellular architecture of adherens junctions. In all three ectodomain crystals, cadherins dimerize through a trans adhesive interface and are connected by a second, cis, <b>interface.</b> <b>Assemblies</b> formed by E-cadherin ectodomains coated on liposomes also appear to adopt this structure. Fluorescent imaging of junctions formed from wild-type and mutant E-cadherins in cultured cells confirm conclusions derived from structural evidence.

40|$|The {{electronic}} {{properties of}} interfaces between two different solids can differ strikingly {{from those of}} the constituent materials. For instance, metallic conductivity, and even superconductivity, have been recently discovered at interfaces formed by insulating transition metal oxides. Here we investigate interfaces between crystals of conjugated organic molecules, which are large gap undoped semiconductors, i. e. essentially insulators. We find that highly conducting interfaces can be realized with resistivity ranging from 1 to 30 kOhm square, and that, for the best samples, the temperature dependence of the conductivity is metallic. The observed electrical conduction originates from a large transfer of charge between the two crystals that takes place at the interface, on a molecular scale. As the <b>interface</b> <b>assembly</b> process is simple and can be applied to crystals of virtually any conjugated molecule, the conducting interfaces described here represent the first examples of a new class of electronic systems.

A 200 N load (static load) was applied at the central point of the abutment extremity, at a crosshead speed of 5 mm/minute, until failure. Data was analyzed by ANOVA and Tukey&# 8217;s range test. The titanium screws had higher fracture resistance, compared with PEEK and 30 % carbon fiber-reinforced PEEK screws (p 0. 05).

40|$|Background: AGUIA is a {{front-end}} {{web application}} originally developed to manage clinical, demographic and biomolecular patient data collected during clinical trials at MD Anderson Cancer Center. The diversity of methods involved in patient screening and sample processing generates {{a variety of}} data types that require a resourceoriented architecture to capture the associations between the heterogeneous data elements. AGUIA uses a semantic web formalism, resource description framework (RDF), and a bottom-up design of knowledge bases that employ the S 3 DB tool {{as the starting point}} for the clientâs <b>interface</b> <b>assembly.</b> Methods: The data web service, S 3 DB, meets the necessary requirements of generating the RDF and of explicitly distinguishing the description of the domain from its instantiation, while allowing for continuous editing of both.

However, S 3 DB alone does not address the issue of representing content in a form that makes sense for domain experts.

40|$|The {{impact of}} the {{discovery}} of the synthesis of periodic mesoporous material using amphiphilic surfactants is apparent from the demographics of papers that have appeared in this area. In addition to providing for the first time access to high surface area, monodispersed mesopores (1 nm to > 10 nm), the research has provided, in a more generic sense, a new synthesis paradigm on the ways in which to bring together spatially distinct, nanostructured organic, and inorganic arrays into two- and three-dimensional periodic, composite structures. Designed materials synthesis and properties based on the molecular level interplay of the kinetics and energetics of organic and inorganic domain and <b>interface</b> <b>assembly</b> are of vital interest to many areas including biomineralization, conducting and optical display polymer composites, chemical sensors, fine chemical and bio-catalysis, and the creation of composite phases with useful mechanical and thermal properties for insulation and packaging applications.

40|$|Actinoporins are {{a family}} of 20 -kDa, basic {{proteins}} isolated from sea anemones, whose activity is inhibited by preincubation with sphingomyelin. They are produced in monomeric soluble form but, when binding to the plasma membrane, they oligomerize to produce functional pores which result in cell lysis. Equinatoxin II (EqtII) from Actinia equina and Sticholysin II (StnII) from Stichodactyla helianthus are the actinoporins that have been studied in more detail. Both proteins display a beta-sandwich fold composed of 10 beta-strands flanked on each side by two short alpha-helices. Twodimensional crystallization on lipid monolayers has allowed the determination of low-resolution models of tetrameric structures distinct from the pore. However, the actual structure of the pore is not known yet. Wild-type EqtII and StnII, {{as well as a}} nice collection of natural and artificially made variants of both proteins, have been produced in Escherichia coli and purified. Their characterization has allowed the proposal of a model for the mechanism of pore formation. Four regions of the actinoporins structure seem to play an important role. First, a phosphocholine-binding site and a cluster of exposed aromatic residues, together with a basic region, would be involved in the initial interaction with the membrane, whereas the amphipathic N-terminal region would be essential for oligomerization and pore formation. Accordingly, the model states that pore formation would proceed in at least four steps: Monomer binding to the membrane <b>interface,</b> <b>assembly</b> of four monomers, and at least two distinct conformational changes driving to the final formation of the functional pore...|$|E

40|$|The {{development}} of alternative details to manage water intrusion at the window-wall interface {{has produced a}} number of novel approaches to detailing the interface between the window and adjacent wall assembly. Many of these approaches advocate {{the need to provide}} drainage at the rough opening of the window subsill given that the window components themselves are susceptible to water entry over their expected life. Depending on the types of windows used and the cladding into which the windows are installed, there arise different methods to provide drainage that may also affect air leakage through the assembly. This in turn may give rise to the formation of condensation along the window at the sill or along the window sash and glazing panels. Hence {{there is a need to}} determine if, under cold weather conditions, specific interface details that incorporate sill pans provide potential for condensation on the window components in which air leakage paths may be prominent at the sill or elsewhere on the window assembly. The paper reports on a laboratory evaluation of conditions suitable for the formation of condensation at the window frame perimeter of the <b>interface</b> <b>assembly</b> as a function of both temperature deferential and air leakage rate across the test assembly.

30|$|To further {{increase}} the number of SERS hot spots, many efforts have been focused on roughening the surface of AgNWs, including direct metal deposition, chemical etching [20], and decorating nanowire with small metallic nanoparticles onto the AgNWs [21, 22]. These methods have been proved effective in increasing active hot spots along the Ag nanowireâs longitudinal axis. Lu et al. [23] revealed a surface plasmon-mediated photochemical etching in the presence of Raman probes. The nanoscale morphology changes on the surface of AgNW can be generated, resulting in a dramatic increase of Raman scattering intensity. Goh et al. [20] have successfully produced roughened Ag nanowires using a chemical etching method. Single nanowire SERS mapping indicated that the etched nanowires exhibited a SERS enhancement factor of ~[*] 104, while the as-synthesized Ag nanowires only showed limited SERS signals at their tips. The result testified the advantage of chemically etched nanowires, and chemically etched nanowires are more suitable than as-synthesized nanowires for SERS substrates. However, many studies focused on single-nanowire Raman scattering or roughened AgNWs out of order; there has been little literature reporting aligned surface with roughed silver nanowires as SERS substrates by far. Furthermore, when nanowires are extremely close to each other, the electromagnetic fields at the gap region between the nanoparticles are drastically increased [24]. Herein, we present an aligned chemically etched AgNW monolayer as the SERS substrate using a chemical etching and three-phase <b>interface</b> <b>assembly</b> method. The resultant substrates were used for detection of rhodamine B (RB) with astonishing sensitivity (10 â 11 Â M). Repeated measurements show an excellent reproducibility of the SERS substrate. The relative standard deviations in the SERS intensities are limited to only approximately 12 %. The new type of substrate provided a higher performance comparing with as-synthesized AgNWs. The findings may contribute to novel and efficient design of SERS substrates.|$|E

ADAMS has evolved over the last 11 years from a system built around a single minicomputer to a system using two minicomputers to a distributed processing system based on microprocessors. The system is built around two buses. One bus is used for passing setup and control information between elements of the system. This is burst type data. The second bus is used for passing periodic data between the units. This data originates in the sensors installed by Flight Test or in the Black Boxes on the airplane. These buses interconnect {{a number of different}} processors. The Application Processor is the primary data analysis processor in the system. It runs the application programs and drives the display devices. A number of Application Processors may be installed. The File Processor handles the mass storage devices and such common peripheral devices as the printer. The Acquisition <b>Interface</b> <b>Assembly</b> is the entry point for data into ADAMS.
