40|$|Oxidative {{reactions}} {{are the main}} culprits in color alterations associated with seafood spoilage. Black spot formation or melanosis is a natural post-mortem oxidative mechanism, which cause crustaceans rejection by consumers because of their appearance. The use of phenolic compounds, such as 4 -hexylresorcinol, {{appears to be a}} good alternative to the conventional sulphites, allowing longer conservation periods. Lipidic oxidation {{is also one of the}} main restrictive factors in the preservation of fish products. The application of natural plant extracts to prevent oxidative rancidity has been studied in a number of fish products. However, polyphenol-protein interactions may have a masking effect on the free radical scavenging activity of polyphenols and may also have a detrimental effect on the in vivo bioavailability of both phenolics and proteins. Polyphenolic plant extracts may be included into <b>fish</b> <b>gelatin-based</b> <b>films</b> in order to obtain an edible film with antioxidant properties. These films applied on the surface of raw or mild processed salted or smoked fish may increase the shelf life of fish products by reduction the lipid oxidation during the chilled storage...|$|E
40|$|The {{incorporation}} of graphene oxide (GO) nanosheets into <b>fish</b> <b>gelatin-based</b> <b>films</b> {{and the resulting}} effect on the structural, mechanical, and thermal properties of the film was investigated. Gelatin films were prepared using a casting method with D-sorbitol as the plasticizer and carrageenan as the stabilizer. GO nanofillers were dispersed into the gelatin network in different weight percentages. FTIR spectroscopy was used to characterize the molecular structure of gelatin films and revealed {{that there were no}} major changes in the functional groups of fish gelatin films after addition of GO and carrageenan. Tensile, differential scanning calorimetery (DSC), and thermo gravimetric analysis (TGA) tests were performed to study the effectiveness of GO nanofillers and the effect of sorbitol and carrageenan on the film properties. Addition of 1 wt% of GO significantly increased the tensile strength and the elongation modulus of the gelatin films (to 44 and 1320 MPa, respectively). This was attributed to the strong interfacial interactions between GO sheets and gelatine molecules. However, increasing the GO percentage to 2 wt% resulted in a considerable decrease in both properties (to 11 and 224 MPa, respectively). This might be due to the agglomeration of GO sheets in the gelatin network. DSC results showed a substantial increase in the T-m of the films as a result of adding carrageenan and GO to the gelatin network. This might be due to the strong combination of helical structure of carrageenan and oxygen containing groups of GO...|$|E

The effects of ZnO NR fillers on the mechanical, optical, and electrical properties of fish gelatin bio-nanocomposite films were investigated.

X-ray diffraction showed an increase in the intensity of the crystal facets of (10 ī 1) and (0002) with the addition of ZnO NRs in the biocomposite matrix. The surface topography of the fish gelatin films indicated an increase in surface roughness with increasing ZnO NR concentrations. The conductivity of the films also significantly increased with the addition of ZnO NRs. These results indicated that bio-nanocomposites based on ZnO NRs had great potentials for applications in packaging technology, food preservation, and UV-shielding systems.|$|R
30|$|ZnO NRs {{played an}} {{important}} role in enhancing the physical properties of <b>fish</b> <b>gelatin-based</b> biocomposites. After the incorporation of low levels of ZnO NR fillers, significant differences were observed in the film properties, particularly in electrical, mechanical, and UV protection activities. The optical properties of bio-nanocomposites indicated that the UV transmission becomes almost zero with the addition of small amounts of ZnO NRs to the biopolymer matrix. The presence of ZnO NRs in <b>fish</b> <b>gelatin-based</b> polymers enabled the localization of charge carriers, thus improving the electrical properties of conventional polymers. The FTIR spectra indicated the physical interaction between the gelatin and ZnO NRs. XRD diffraction shows that the intensity of the crystal facets of (10 ī 1) and (0002) increased with increasing ZnO NR concentrations in the biocomposite matrix. These crystal facets also increased the UV absorption. Therefore, ZnO biopolymer nanocomposites have excellent potential applications in food packaging and UV shielding.|$|R

30|$|During {{the last}} decade, {{there has been}} an {{increasing}} interest in edible or biodegradable films based on biopolymers. The main advantage of biopolymers over synthetic polymers is their biodegradability. Biopolymers such as polysaccharides and proteins have been used as biodegradable and/or edible food packaging materials (Artharn et al. 2009; Gennadios et al. 1997). Proteins are important biopolymers possessing good film-forming ability. Among proteins, fish gelatin has been used as film-forming material (Gómez-Guillén et al. 2009). Properties of <b>fish</b> <b>gelatin-based</b> <b>films</b> depend on various factors such as the source of gelatin, concentration of gelatin, plasticisers and substances incorporated into the film-forming solutions (Jongjareonrak et al. 2006; Limpisophon et al. 2010; Tongnuanchan et al. 2012). Gelatin film generally has good mechanical and oxygen barrier properties. However, it has high water absorptivity due to hydrophilicity of gelatin molecules and the presence of hydrophilic plasticisers such as glycerol (Gennadios et al. 1994; Krochta and De Mulder-Johnston 1997; McHugh and Krochta 1994). To improve water vapour barrier properties of the gelatin films, hydrophobic substances such as fats and oils have been added (Bertan et al. 2005; Tongnuanchan et al. 2012). Recently, gelatin film incorporated with palm oil has been prepared by Tongnuanchan et al. (2015) and it had the lowered water vapour permeability. With the improved water vapour barrier property, the gelatin films incorporated with fats and oils could become an environmental friendly edible packaging, which could be used to maintain the quality of foods, especially those prone to the textural changes induced by moisture absorption. Thus, the aim of this work was to study the effect of the gelatin films incorporated without and with palm oil on the quality of shrimp cracker during the extended storage.|$|E

Here, we study films containing combinations of collagen, gelatin and soluble and insoluble elastin, crosslinking of which results in altered film stiffness and roughness. Collagen and gelatin have similar amino acid sequences, but altered cell binding sites. We studied cell response with both C 2 C 12 myoblast cells, (which possess RGD-recognising integrins αVβ 3 and α 5 β 1) and C 2 C 12 -α 2 + cells (which, in addition, express the collagen-binding integrin α 2 β 1) to establish the effect of altering the available binding sites on cell adhesion and spreading on films. Systematically altering the composition, crosslinking and cell type, allows us to deconvolute the effects of physical parameters and available binding sites on the cell reactivity of films in this system. Collagen-based films were rougher and stiffer and supported lower cell surface coverage than <b>gelatin-based</b> <b>films.</b> Additionally, C 2 C 12 -α 2 + cells showed preferential attachment to collagen-based films compared with C 2 C 12 cells, but no significant difference was seen using <b>gelatin-based</b> <b>films.</b> The cell count and surface coverage was found to decrease significantly on all films after crosslinking (Coll X...|$|R
40|$|The {{effect of}} gelatin, glycerol, and {{cellulose}} nanofiber (CNFs) concentrations on the mechanical properties, water vapor permeability, and color parameters of films was evaluated. The {{results indicate that}} the color is only affected by the gelatin concentration. Mechanical tests indicated that with increasing concentration of gelatin and CNFs, there is an increase in tensile strength, whereas an increase in glycerol concentration causes an increase in elongation, making the films more flexible. An increased concentration of gelatin and glycerol makes the film more permeable to water vapor, while an increase in the concentration of CNFs reduces this property.

Permeability to water vapor varied between 0. 17 and 0. 34 (g mm/m(2) h kPa), slightly increasing with the increase in concentration of plasticizers.

40|$|The {{properties}} of edible, <b>gelatin-based</b> <b>films</b> with added oregano or rosemary extract (two different concentrations) were studied.

The bovine-hide gelatin reacted only slightly with the polyphenols in the extracts as shown by the electrophoretic profile and analysis of the dynamic viscoelastic properties, and consequently the attributes (mechanical properties, water solubility, water vapour permeability) of the films were practically unchanged compared with the film made without any added plant extract. The tuna-skin gelatin did evidence some interactions with the polyphenols in both the oregano and the rosemary extracts, especially for the more concentrated of the two extracts tested, thereby altering the attributes of the corresponding films, namely, a higher glass transition temperature, decreased deformability, and, in particular, increased water solubility.

40|$|The {{development}} of biofilms has grown considering {{the possibility of}} partial substitution of plastic materials which are not biodegradable. Proteins and polysaccharides {{have been used to}} produce films with good mechanical properties. However, films produced with these materials present a high permeability in water vapor. An alternative to improve the water vapor barrier of films is to incorporate hydrophobic substances (stearic and caproic fatty acids) in the composition of the filmogenic solution, however this incorporation does not occur homogeneously. Thus, to improve the incorporation of hydrophobic substances in the protein matrix of the film, surfactants (SDS and Tween 80) were added. They are compounds that improve the interaction between the protein and the fatty acids, producing a less heterogeneous filmogenic matrix. The effect of pH was also studied, with the purpose of observing if it influences the homogeneity of the filmogenic matrix. The addition of stearic acid to the <b>gelatin-based</b> <b>films</b> was more efficient in reducing the water vapor permeability than the caproic acid.

40|$|ABSTRACT: In {{the fields}} of surgery and {{regenerative}} medicine, {{it is crucial to}} understand the interactions of proteins with the biomaterials used as implants. Protein adsorption directly influences cell-material interactions in vivo and, as a result, regulates, for example, cell adhesion {{on the surface of the}} implant. Therefore, the development of suitable analytical techniques together with well-defined model systems allowing for the detection, characterization, and quantification of protein adsorbates is essential. In this study, a protocol for the deposition of highly stable, thin <b>gelatin-based</b> <b>films</b> on various substrates has been developed. The hydrogel films were characterized morphologically and chemically. Due to the obtained low thickness of the hydrogel layer, this setup allowed for a quantitative study on the interaction of human proteins (albumin and fibrinogen) with the hydrogel by Quartz Crystal Microbalance with Dissipation Monitoring (QCM-D). This technique enables the determination of adsorbant mass and changes in the shear modulus of the hydrogel layer upon adsorption of human proteins.

The formulations that resulted in either larger or smaller elongation values were used to produce films via both blown extrusion (EBF) and casting (CF) and were characterized with respect to their mechanical properties, water vapor permeability, moisture content, solubility, morphology and infrared spectroscopy. The elongation of the EF films was significantly higher than that of the CF and EBF films. The transversal section possessed a compact, homogeneous structure for all of the films studied. The solubility of the films (36 - 40 %) did not differ significantly between the different processes evaluated.

Também foi caracterizada a microestrutura por microscopia eletrônica de varredura (MEV) e microscopia de força atômica (AFM); às imagens obtidas por MEV foi aplicado um analise de imagem mediante o programa Image J, para obter o valor da dimensão fractal (DF). Depois foram caracterizadas as propriedades superficiais de ângulo de contato (AC), molhabilidade ou coeficiente de espalhamento (Se), e energia livre {{superficial}} (ELS) mediante a medida do ângulo de contato pelo método da gota séssil (água: 5 µL e 1 -Bromonaftaleno: 3 µL). Para o cálculo da ELS também foi aplicado o método de Owens-Wendt. Estas caracterizações foram feitas em ambos os lados do filme, lado ar e lado placa. A natureza do filme de G/ATB influenciou na umidade e as propriedades óticas, enquanto que os filmes de G e G/MMT apresentaram características similares. Em relação à microestrutura e rugosidade, o filme de G apresentou a superfície mais homogênea e lisa, contrario ao observado no filme de G/MMT, que apresentou a maior rugosidade seguida do filme de G/ATB. Foi observado que houve uma relação entre os valores de rugosidade e DF. De acordo com o valor do AC, os filmes apresentaram um caráter hidrofóbico, pois seus valores foram superiores a 65 ° (em ambos os lados dos filmes), na seguinte ordem: G/MMT > G > G/ATB; sendo que o Se seguiu a mesma tendência. Cabe mencionar também que não foi encontrada uma correlação significativa entre os valores de AC e rugosidade. Em função dos valores de AC, Se e ELS (especificamente a componente polar), o filme de G/ATB apresentou o menor caráter hidrofóbico, pois apresentou menores valores de AC e maiores valores de Se em comparação com os outros dois filmes. Os valores da componente polar da G/ATB foram os maiores, explicando de melhor maneira o caráter menos hidrofóbico deste filme. Pode-se concluir que os filmes à base de gelatina elaborados no presente trabalho têm propriedades hidrofóbicas (AC> 65 °), sendo a G/MMT o filme com melhores características hidrofóbicas. The aim of {{this study}} was to characterize the surface properties of <b>gelatin-based</b> <b>films.</b> For which, films were produced as following: gelatin plasticized with glycerol (gelatin: 5 g/ 100 g SFF; glycerol: 30 g/ 100 g of gelatin), gelatin reinforced with montmorillonite (gelatin: 5 g/ 100 g SFF; glycerol: 30 g/ 100 of gelatin; montmorillonite: 5 g/ 100 g of gelatin), and gelatin plasticized with acetyltributyl citrate (gelatin: 5 g/ 100 g SFF; acetyltributyl citrate: 50 g/ 100 of gelatin, soy lecithin: 60 g/ 100 g acetyltributyl citrate; ethanol: 20 g/ 100 g SFF). The films were produced by using an automatic film applicator S̈preading. ̈ Then, the films were tested for determining thickness, humidity and optical property (gloss, color and opacity). Also the microstructure was characterized by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and atomic force microscopy (AFM); in the images obtained by SEM it was applied image analysis using Image J program, to get the value of the fractal dimension (FD). After, the surface properties of contact angle (CA), wettability or spreading coefficient (Cs) and surface free energy (SFE) were characterized by measuring the contact angle by the method of the sessile drop (water: 5 µL, 1 -Bromonaphthalene: 3 µL). For the calculation of the ELS, it was also applied the method of Owens-Wendt. These characterizations were made on both sides of the film (air side and plate side). The nature of the G/ATB film influenced the moisture and optical properties, while the films of G and G/MMT showed similar values. With regard to microstructure and roughness, the G film presented a more homogeneous and smooth surface, contrary to that was observed in films of G/MMT, who presented the highest roughness followed by G/ATB film. It was observed that there was a relationship between the roughness values and DF. According to the value of the CA, the three films had a hydrophobic character, because their values were above 65 ° (on both sides of the film), in the following order: G/MMT > G > G/ATB; the Cs followed the same trend. It should be also mentioned that a significant correlation between the values of CA and the roughness was found. According to the values of CA, Cs and SFE (specifically the polar component), the films of G/ATB had the lowest hydrophobicity, because had lower CA values and higher Cs values, as compared to the other two films. The values of the polar component of the film G/ATB were higher, which explains better the less hydrophobic character of this film. It can be concluded that the <b>gelatin-based</b> <b>films</b> produced in this work have hydrophobic properties (CA> 65 °), being the film G/MMT which showed better hydrophobic characteristics...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. The {{effect of}} {{glycerol}} content {{on the physical}} properties of <b>gelatin-based</b> edible <b>films</b> was studied in this work, {{on the basis of}} the interactions between the plasticizer and polymeric matrix. In this work, some non-usual techniques were used to characterize edible films. For dielectric measurements and infrared spectroscopy, these films were conditioned in silica gel in order to minimize the water effect. For other analysis, the films were conditioned in NaBr. Infrared spectroscopy showed no apparent changes in the position peaks, suggesting an absence of new interactions between the plasticizer and film matrix. It seems that the plasticizers only occupy some specific regions between the polymeric matrix, increasing their distance, and thus, affecting their mobility, which results in more flexible films. Dielectric constant of the films increased with plasticizer content, and decreased over silica gel conditioning. The polarizability was found to arise mainly from water molecules present in the film. Microwave response was found to be also sensitive to water content in the films, due to plasticizer hydrophilic nature. According to the diffractograms, gelatin films presented essentially an amorphous nature, independently of the glycerol content. The results suggest, therefore, that the glycerol induces no chemical modifications in the films...|$|R

The fruits were subjected to the following processing: a) whole fruit without flavedo; b) whole fruit without flavedo and albedo; and c) segmented into wedges and packed as follows: uncoated packaging (control); polyethylene film; PVC film; <b>gelatin-based</b> edible <b>films</b> (3 %); and polyesthyrene translucent plastic container with a lid. The minimally processed oranges were stored at 5 ± 1 °C for 8 days and were subjected to physicochemical and microbiological analyses every two days. Greater weight loss occurred in fruits without flavedo and segmented, uncoated, and coated with the edible gelatin film During storage, there was a slight increase in Total Soluble Solids (TSS) for the treatments with greater weight loss and reduction in acidity and ascorbic acid, regardless of the packaging type. The microbial counts did not exceed the acceptable limits in the treatments; however, higher counts were observed at the end of storage. The minimally processed fruit packed in lidded polystyrene containers and polyethylene and PVC films kept their overall fresh visual appearance with a few physicochemical and microbiological changes up to the 8 th day of storage...|$|R

40|$|The present {{experiment}} {{was an attempt}} to improve the shelf-life of cold-smoked sardine (Sardina pilchardus) using, singly or in combination, high pressure (300 MPa/ 20 °C/ 15 min) and <b>gelatin-based</b> functional edible <b>films</b> enriched by adding an extract of oregano (Origanum vulgare) or rosemary (Rosmarinus officinalis) or by adding chitosan. The uncoated muscle itself exhibited a certain level of antioxidant power (as measured by the FRAP method) ensuing from the deposition of phenols during smoking. Coating the muscle with the films enriched with the oregano or rosemary extracts increased the phenol content and the antioxidant power of the muscle, particularly when used in association with high pressure, due to migration of antioxidant substances from the film. The edible films with the added plant extracts lowered lipid oxidation levels (as measured by the peroxide and TBARS indices) and also, to a lesser extent, reduced microbial growth (total counts), whereas the gelatin-chitosan-based edible films lowered microbial counts (total counts, sulphide-reducing bacteria). Neither luminescent bacteria nor Enterobacteriaceae were detected in any of the batches. The combination of high pressure and edible films yielded the best results in terms of both preventing oxidation and inhibiting microbial growth. © 2007 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Objetivou-se com este trabalho determinar a influência do nível de processamento mínimo e atmosfera modificada na qualidade de laranja 'Champagne' minimamente processada armazenada sob refrigeração. Laranjas submetidas aos seguintes processos: a) remoção do albedo; b) remoção do albedo e flavedo; c) segmentada em gomos, foram acondicionadas em embalagem sem revestimento (controle), com filme de polietileno, com filme de PVC, com revestimento comestível de gelatina a 3 % e em pote plástico com tampa de poliestireno. O armazenamento dos frutos foi realizado a 5 ± 1 °C por oito dias, sendo submetidos a análises físico-químicas e microbiológicas a cada dois dias. A maior perda de massa ocorreu em frutos sem flavedo e segmentados, sem revestimento e com película de gelatina. À medida que avançou o período de armazenamento, observou-se ligeira elevação no teor de SST para os tratamentos com maior perda de massa e redução da acidez e ácido ascórbico, sem efeito da embalagem. As contagens microbianas não ultrapassaram os limites preconizados em nenhum tratamento, entretanto, maiores contagens foram verificadas no final do armazenamento. As frutas minimamente processadas embaladas em potes de poliestireno com tampa, filmes de polietileno e PVC mantiveram boa aparência com poucas modificações nas características físico-químicas e microbiológicas até o 8 ° dia de armazenamento...|$|R
