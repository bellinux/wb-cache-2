40|$|Transcoding Arabic numbers (e. g., 64) {{from and}} into verbal number words (e. g., ‘sixty-four’) {{is one of}} the most basic tasks in the domain of number processing. Although {{transcoding}} is very simple for adults, it is often a great challenge for children – and especially so in inversed number languages. In inversed number languages, such as Dutch and German, the ten-unit order is inversed when number words are pronounced or written down (e. g., 64 is pronounced as ‘four-and-sixty’). This gives rise to inversion errors (e. g., writing 46 when hearing 64). In a recent study, 7 -year-old German-speaking children were asked to write down dictated Arabic numbers (Zuber et al., 2009). The error rate was very high (47 %) and <b>inversion</b> <b>errors</b> <b>were</b> very frequent (50 % of overall error rate). The children’s transcoding performance was best predicted by executive working memory (WM), and – in a lesser degree – by visuospatial WM. We want to pursue these results by comparing Dutch- and French-speaking children. In Study 1, we tested 57 Dutch-speaking and 60 French-speaking children between 7 and 9 years old. All children completed a group-administered dictation of Arabic numbers. Although the error rate was equally large in Dutch- and French-speaking children, the percentage of inversion errors differed significantly (Figure 1). In Study 2, we tested 49 Dutch-speaking and 38 French-speaking children of 8 years old. They all completed a group-administered dictation of Arabic numbers. For each language group, we selected the 10 worst and 10 best transcoders (based on the number of transcoding errors). The WM of these children was further tested by means of two phonological tasks (Digit span forwards and Letter span forwards), two visuospatial tasks (Corsi Blocks forwards and Mazes Memory), and four executive tasks (Digit span backwards, Letter span backwards, Corsi Blocks backwards, and Sun Moon Stroop). For each WM component, a compound score was calculated as the mean of the z-scores. A stepwise logistic regression analysis was performed on transcoding performance (bad vs. good) with intelligence, age, gender, and WM (phonological, visuospatial, and executive) as predictors (Table 1). Executive WM was a significant predictor for both groups, whereas intelligence, gender, and phonological WM were significant for Dutch-speaking children only. A test of the final model versus a model with intercept only was statistically significant, χ²(4, N= 20) = 27. 73 (p <. 001) for Dutch-speaking children and χ²(1, N= 20) = 5. 04 (p =. 03) for French-speaking children. The final model was able correctly to classify all Dutch-speaking children (100 %) as being good or bad transcoders, whereas the overall success rate for the French-speaking children was 65 %. In conclusion, children speaking an inversed number language experience great difficulties when transcoding numbers. They make many inversion errors and rely to a great degree on their WM. Elementary school teachers should be aware of this, and may have to give extra attention to children with lower intelligence or WM scores. Children speaking a non-inversed number language, in contrast, make very few inversion errors and rely to a lesser degree on their WM when transcoding numbers. status: publishe...|$|E

The <b>inversion</b> <b>error</b> <b>is</b> reflected through an angular estimate which measures the deviation between the measured and predicted concentrations. The uncertainty estimation methodology is evaluated for point source reconstruction studies, using real measurements from two field experiments, known as Fusion Field Trials 2007 (FFT 07) in flat terrain and Mock Urban Setting Test (MUST) in urban like terrain. In FFT 07 and MUST experiments, the point source location is retrieved with an average Euclidean distance of 22 m and 15 m respectively. The source strength is retrieved, on average, within a factor of 1. 5 in both the datasets. The <b>inversion</b> <b>error</b> <b>is</b> observed as 24 ° and 21 ° in FFT 07 and MUST experiment, respectively.

For a comparative analysis, the interval estimates are also compared with a more general method of uncertainty estimation, Residual Bootstrap Sampling.

40|$|Abstract: Due to {{the large}} {{deviation}} of sound speed fields caused by internal waves, the sound propagation through this range-dependent medium induces an energy exchange between different acoustic normal modes. Two kinds of methods are proposed to reconstruct the internal solitary wave (ISW) parameters: phase speed and wavelength. First, in case of internal waves moving between an acoustic source and receiver, the time series of the mode amplitude behave like some quasi-period phenomena, and the periods are described {{as a product of}} the ISW moving-speed and the difference of normal mode wave number. The ISW speed is inverted by means of the spectrum analysis of the time series of mode amplitude. Second, the mode coupling only occurs when the wave number difference between the two coupling modes is equal to the wave number of the ISW spectrum, serving to estimate the ISW wavelength. The simulation is performed to evaluate the above inversion methods, setting an internal solitary wave or an internal solitary wave packet in the simulation domain. The <b>inversion</b> <b>errors</b> due to the wave phase speed are about 5 % and 10 % for the flat and slope topographies, respectively. The lower the sound frequency, the more accurate the inversion result. When the suitable resonance frequency <b>is</b> adopted, the <b>inversion</b> <b>errors</b> of wavelength <b>are</b> smaller than 10 %.

Study 2 examined two minimally intrusive methods of remediation. Eighty third grade children were given either instructions to borrow, promised rewards for accurate performance or no intervention and were asked to solve a series of subtraction problems requiring borrowing. Neither experimental condition resulted in a significant increase in the number of problems solved correctly. Those children who initially failed to solve any problems correctly responded to instructions with a decrease in <b>inversion</b> <b>errors</b> and an increase in borrowing errors. These results suggested that more intensive instruction was required. In Study 3, 67 third and fourth grade children were assigned to one of three conditions: Component skills Training, Criterion Training or a regular classroom control condition.

40|$|M. Ing. (Electrical and Electronic Engineering) In this study, {{the problem}} of {{correcting}} burst of adjacent deletions by adapting product codes was investigated. The first step in any digital transmission is to establish synchronization between the sending and receiving nodes. This initial synchronization ensures that the receiver samples the information bits at the correct interval. Unfortunately synchronization is not guaranteed to last for the entire duration of data transmission. Though synchronization errors rarely occur, it has disastrous effects at {{the receiving end of}} transmission. These synchronization <b>errors</b> <b>are</b> modelled as either insertions or deletions in the transmitted data. In the best case scenario, these <b>errors</b> <b>are</b> restricted to single bit errors. In the worst case scenario, these errors lead to bursts of bits being incorrect. If these synchronization <b>errors</b> <b>are</b> not detected and corrected, it can cause a shift in the transmitted sequence which in turn leads to loss of synchronization. When a signal is subjected to synchronization <b>errors</b> it <b>is</b> difficult accurately recover the original data signal. In addition to the loss of synchronization, the information transmitted over the channel is also subjected to noise. This noise in the channel causes <b>inversion</b> <b>errors</b> within the signal. The objective of this dissertation is to investigate if an error correction scheme can be designed that has the ability to detect and correct adjacent bursts of deletions and random <b>inversion</b> <b>errors.</b> This error correction scheme needed to make use of a product code matrix structure.

In particular, several attempts to constrain the hydrogeophysical inverse problem to reduce <b>inversion</b> <b>errors</b> have <b>been</b> made using time-lapse geophysical measurements through both coupled and uncoupled (also known as sequential) inversion approaches. Despite the appeal and popularity of coupled inversion approaches, their superiority over uncoupled methods has not been proved conclusively; {{the goal of this}} work is to provide an objective comparison between the two approaches within a specific inversion modeling framework based on the ensemble Kalman filter (EnKF). Using EnKF and a model of Lagrangian transport, we compare the performance of a fully coupled and uncoupled inversion method for the reconstruction of heterogeneous saturated hydraulic conductivity fields through the assimilation of ERT-monitored tracer test data. The two inversion approaches are tested {{in a number of different}} scenarios, including isotropic and anisotropic synthetic aquifers, where we change the geostatistical parameters used to generate the prior ensemble of hydraulic conductivity fields. Our results show that the coupled approach outperforms the uncoupled when the prior statistics are close to the ones used to generate the true field. Otherwise, the coupled approach is heavily affected by “filter inbreeding” (an undesired effect of variance underestimation typical of EnKF), while the uncoupled approach is more robust, being able to correct biased prior information, thanks to its capability of capturing the solute travel times even in presence of inversion artifacts such as the violation of mass balance. Furthermore, the coupled approach is more computationally intensive than the uncoupled, due to the much larger number of forward runs required by the electrical model. Overall, we conclude that the relative merit of the coupled versus the uncoupled approach cannot be assumed a priori and should be assessed case by case...|$|R

The 3 D ray-tracing method is applied to forward-model the microseismic data and traditional inversion methods are applied to locate events and analyse the <b>inversion</b> <b>error.</b> Finally, we introduce a new method, called the equivalent velocity inversion method (EVIM), taking into account the influence of the fracturing process. The simulation results show that {{the hydraulic}} fracturing process affects the velocity and thus makes the inversion accuracy of the same receiver array vary considerably with the sources in the traditional methods. The new EVIM can effectively reduce the <b>inversion</b> <b>error.</b> ...|$|R
40|$|Two {{studies are}} {{reported}} in which the transcoding abilities of Dutch- and French-speaking children (e. g., writing 64 when hearing ‘sixty-four') are tested. French is, like English, a non-inversed number language, {{which means that the}} tens are pronounced before the units (‘sixty four'). Dutch, in contrast, is an inversed number language, which means that the ten-unit order is inversed when number words are pronounced (e. g., 64 is pronounced as ‘four-and-sixty'), which gives rise to <b>inversion</b> <b>errors</b> (e. g., writing 46 when hearing 64). In the first study, we show that 7 - and 8 -year old Dutch-speaking children make significantly more <b>inversion</b> <b>errors</b> than do 7 - and 8 -year old French-speaking children. In the second study we show that both Dutch- and French-speaking 8 -year-old children rely on their executive working memory when transcoding numbers, but that only Dutch-speaking children rely on their phonological working memory when transcoding numbers. For the Dutch-speaking children only, gender effects (bad transcoders are more often girls) and effects of intelligence (bad transcoders are more often less intelligent) were also observed. Implications for elementary school education as well as ideas for further research are discussed. status: publishe...|$|R
40|$|Considering the {{hypersonic}} aerospace vehicle, {{with high}} dynamic, strong varying parameters, strong nonlinear, strong coupling, and the complicated flight environment, conventional flight control methods based on linear system may become invalid. To the high precision and reliable control problem of this vehicle, nonlinear flight control strategy based on neural network robust adaptive dynamic inversion is proposed. Firstly, considering the nonlinear characteristics of aerodynamic coefficients varying with Mach numbers, attack angle, and sideslip angle, the complete nonlinear 6 -DOF model of RBV is established. Secondly, {{based on the}} time-scale separation, using the nonlinear dynamic inversion control strategy achieves the pseudolinear decoupling of RBV. And then, using the neural network with single hidden layer approximates the dynamic <b>inversion</b> <b>error</b> for system model uncertainty. Next, the external disturbance and network approximating <b>error</b> <b>are</b> suppressed by robust adaptive control. Finally, using Lyapunov’s theory proves that all error signals of closed loop system are uniformly bounded finally under this control strategy. Nonlinear simulation verifies the feasibility and validity of this control strategy to the RBV control system...|$|R
