5|$|Halogenated refrigerants, termed Freons in {{informal}} contexts, {{are identified}} by R-numbers that denote {{the amount of}} fluorine, chlorine, carbon, and hydrogen present. Chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs) like R-11, R-12, and R-114 once dominated organofluorines, peaking in production in the 1980s. Used for air conditioning systems, propellants and solvents, their production was below one-tenth of this peak by the early 2000s, after widespread international prohibition. Hydrochlorofluorocarbons (HCFCs) and hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs) were designed as replacements; their synthesis consumes more than 90% of the fluorine in the organic industry. Important HCFCs include R-22, chlorodifluoromethane, and R-141b. The main HFC is R-134a with {{a new type of}} molecule HFO-1234yf, a Hydrofluoroolefin (HFO) coming to prominence owing to <b>its</b> <b>global</b> warming potential of less than 1% that of HFC-134a.|$|E
