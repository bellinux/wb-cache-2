5|$|The {{house was}} built in 1879 by William Palmer Southworth, a Cleveland {{businessman}} who established W.P. Southworth Co., a leading Cleveland grocery, in the 1850s. He and his wife Louise were prominent in Cleveland society; while she was {{a leader of the}} women's suffrage movement, his store (located in Public Square downtown) was significant enough that its destruction by fire in 1882 prompted a <b>front-page</b> <b>story</b> in the New York Times.|$|E
5|$|Around Storybrooke, {{residents}} {{notice the}} clock tower's hands moving. Regina (Lana Parrilla) {{looks through the}} book of fairy tales and discovers that the last few pages are torn out. She confronts Henry (Jared S. Gilmore), who lies and says that the pages are missing {{because it is an}} old book. Regina learns Emma is still in town when the clock's hands move forward. Believing that Emma Swan (Jennifer Morrison) will try to take Henry away from her, Regina encourages Emma to leave town. Regina meets with The Daily Mirror editor, Sidney Glass (Giancarlo Esposito), who has run a <b>front-page</b> <b>story</b> about Emma's auto accident which portrays Emma in a poor light, but tells Regina that he has found very little of interest in Emma's past.|$|E
5|$|The {{excavated}} hoard {{was taken}} to the British Museum. The discovery was leaked to the press, and on 19 November, the Sun newspaper ran a <b>front-page</b> <b>story,</b> alongside a picture of Lawes with his metal detector. Although the full contents of the hoard and its value were still unknown, the newspaper article claimed that the hoard was worth Â£10 million. In response to the unexpected publicity, the British Museum held a press conference at the museum on 20 November to announce the discovery. Newspapers lost interest in the hoard quickly, allowing British Museum curators to sort, clean and stabilize the hoard without further disruption from the press. The initial cleaning and basic conservation of the hoard was completed within a month of its discovery.|$|E

5|$|Shilts made {{comparisons}} to the government's disparate {{reaction to the}} Chicago Tylenol murders, and the recent emergence of Legionnaire's Disease in 1977. In October 1982, seven people died after ingesting cyanide-laced Tylenol capsules. The New York Times wrote a <b>front-page</b> <b>story</b> about the Tylenol scare every day in October, and produced 33 more stories about the issue after that. More than 100 law enforcement agents, and 1,100 Food and Drug Administration employees worked on the case. Johnson & Johnson disclosed they spent $100million attempting to uncover who had tampered with the bottles. In October 1982, 634 people were reported having AIDS, and of those, 260 had died. The New York Times wrote three stories in 1981 and three more stories in 1982 about AIDS, none on the front page. The Tylenol Crisis was a criminal act of product-tampering; Legionnaire's Disease was a public health emergency. Twenty-nine members of the American Legion died in 1976 at a convention in Philadelphia. The National Institute of Health spent $34,841 per death of Legionnaire's Disease. In contrast, the NIH spent $3,225 in 1981 and about $8,991 in 1982 for each person who died of AIDS.|$|E
5|$|Such strategies, which {{minimize}} the maximum loss for each player, are called optimal. Von Neumann showed that their minimaxes are equal (in absolute value) and contrary (in sign). Von Neumann improved and extended the minimax theorem to include games involving imperfect information and games {{with more than}} two players, publishing this result in his 1944 Theory of Games and Economic Behavior (written with Oskar Morgenstern). Morgenstern {{wrote a paper on}} game theory and thought he would show it to von Neumann because of his interest in the subject. He read it and said to Morgenstern that he should put more in it. This was repeated a couple of times, and then von Neumann became a coauthor and the paper became 100 pages long. Then it became a book. The public interest in this work was such that The New York Times ran a <b>front-page</b> <b>story.</b> In this book, von Neumann declared that economic theory needed to use functional analytic methods, especially convex sets and topological fixed-point theorem, rather than the traditional differential calculus, because the maximum-operator did not preserve differentiable functions.|$|E
5|$|The Baltimore Sun runs a <b>front-page</b> <b>story</b> {{accusing the}} {{homicide}} unit of fumbling {{the investigation and}} protecting the Wilsons based on their race. Under pressure form his superiors, Gee demands they solve the murder immediately. Pembleton admits privately to his wife Mary (Ami Brabson) that he let his personal feelings of respect for Felix Wilson {{get in the way}} of the investigation; he agrees to make them a central part of the investigation. After searching the Wilson house, the detectives find love letters written by Hal Wilson to Brierre. Pembleton questions Felix and Hal, who agree to talk only if their statements are not admissible in court. Pembleton confronts the Wilsons with the love letters, which Hal said he never had the courage to give to Brierre. Felix said he would not have had sex with Brierre if he had known, which Hal said he does not believe. Felix demands the truth from Hal, who admits to killing Brierre in a jealous rage upon learning of her affair with his father.|$|E

5|$|The Hollywood Reporter ran a <b>front-page</b> <b>story</b> on January 13 that Hearst {{papers were}} about to run a series of editorials attacking Hollywood's {{practice}} of hiring refugees and immigrants for jobs {{that could be done}} by Americans. The goal was to put pressure on the other studios to force RKO to shelve Kane. Many of those immigrants had fled Europe after the rise of fascism and feared losing the safe haven of the United States. Soon afterwards, Schaefer was approached by Nicholas Schenck, head of Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer's parent company, with an offer on the behalf of Louis B. Mayer and other Hollywood executives to RKO Pictures of $805,000 to destroy all prints of the film and burn the negative. Once RKO's legal team reassured Schaefer, the studio announced on January 21 that Kane would be released as scheduled, and with one of the largest promotional campaigns in the studio's history. Schaefer brought Welles to New York City for a private screening of the film with the New York corporate heads of the studios and their lawyers. There was no objection to its release provided that certain changes, including the removal or softening of specific references that might offend Hearst, were made. Welles agreed and cut the running time from 122 minutes to 119 minutes. The cuts satisfied the corporate lawyers.|$|E

25|$|In January 1987, MacKenzie {{published}} a totally unfounded <b>front-page</b> <b>story</b> alleging that pop singer Elton John had {{had sex with}} underage rentboys. Shortly afterwards, MacKenzie published further entirely false allegations that the singer had had the voiceboxes of his guard dogs removed because their barking kept him awake at night. MacKenzie confirmed their inaccuracy shortly after publication by sending a reporter to the singer's house, who quickly discovered that all of his guard dogs were quite capable of barking.|$|E
25|$|On 17 June, the Adelaide Daily Mail {{raised the}} {{possibility}} that Harris was the hoaxed rather than the hoaxer. Alarmed, Harris hired a private detective to establish whether Ern and Ethel Malley existed or had ever done so. But by now, the Australian national press was on the trail. The next week, the Sydney Sunday Sun, which had been conducting some investigative reporting, ran a <b>front-page</b> <b>story</b> alleging that the Ern Malley poems had in fact been written by McAuley and Stewart.|$|E
25|$|On October 26, 1991, schoolteacher Dan O'Malley was birdwatching and {{exploring}} marshlands in the Raritan Center business park in Edison, New Jersey. He discovered a child's Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles sneaker, {{which had been}} highly publicized as the kind Timmy was wearing when he disappeared. O'Malley {{brought it to the}} Sayreville Police Department that same day. The sneaker was shown to Lodzinski, who stated it was not her sonâs. It was then stored in an evidence area and apparently forgotten. After weeks with no word from the police, O'Malley reported the sneaker to a local newspaper, The Home News of New Brunswick, resulting in a <b>front-page</b> <b>story</b> and FBI forensic testing.|$|E
5000|$|The {{story was}} picked up by the Washington Post, which ran <b>front-page</b> <b>stories</b> about the problem in January 2004.

25|$|Serpico was a plainclothes {{police officer}} working in Brooklyn, the Bronx and Manhattan to expose vice racketeering. In 1967 he {{reported}} credible evidence of widespread systematic police corruption. Nothing happened, until he met another police officer, David Durk, who helped him. Serpico believed his partners knew about his secret meetings with police investigators. Finally, he contributed to an April 25, 1970, New York Times <b>front-page</b> <b>story</b> on widespread corruption in the NYPD which drew national attention to the problem. Mayor John V. Lindsay appointed a five-member panel to investigate accusations of police corruption. The panel became the Knapp Commission, named after its chairman, Whitman Knapp.|$|E
25|$|Yogo sapphires {{sometimes}} {{do not need}} heat treating because their cornflower blue coloring is uniform and deep, they are generally free of the characteristic inclusions, and they have high uniform clarity. When Intergem Limited began marketing the Yogo in the 1980s as the world's only guaranteed untreated sapphire, heat treatment was not commonly disclosed; by 1982 the heat treatment became a major issue. At that time, 95% of all the world's sapphires were being heated to enhance their natural color. Intergem's marketing of guaranteed untreated Yogos set them against many in the gem industry. This issue appeared as a <b>front-page</b> <b>story</b> in the Wall Street Journal on 29 August 1984 in an article by Bill Richards, Carats and Schticks: Sapphire Marketer Upsets The Gem Industry.|$|E
25|$|Aware that Lenihan {{had been}} one of Duffy's sources for the {{original}} article in September, with Duffy's permission the Irish Times ran a <b>front-page</b> <b>story</b> stating that Lenihan had made the calls he was now denying. In the resulting furore Lenihan's campaign manager Bertie Ahern either deliberately or accidentally revealed on a radio programme that Duffy had interviewed Lenihan. Duffy became the subject of mounting political and media pressure, with his silence being spun by Fianna FÃ¡il press staff as evidence that the rumours that Lenihan had confirmed to him that he had made calls were false. (Lenihan had assured his campaign team that he had said nothing in the interview that could cause problems.) After three days of intense political and media pressure, Duffy released the relevant proportion of the on-the-record tape interview he had done with Lenihan. The release took place in a press conference in a Dublin hotel.|$|E

25|$|The {{media have}} exerted {{substantial}} {{influence over the}} timing and course of HIV control in China by bringing news of HIV {{to the attention of}} the public, administrators, and policymakers. In 1996, the Southern Weekend newspaper ran a <b>front-page</b> <b>story</b> and devoted another two pages to AIDS in China. This coverage was the first time any comprehensive exposure of the HIV/AIDS epidemic in China had been published by the Chinese press. From 1999, the international and subsequently the national media reported on the thousands of infected plasma donors in Henan and neighbouring provinces who did not have access to services. Although the government had acted quickly when the tragedy became apparent in 1995 by shutting down collection stations and, later, introducing new laws and regulations on the collection and management of blood and blood products, provision of HIV testing, prevention, and care for donors in the local areas was slower. Progress was stimulated by the media's attention to the plight of the infected plasma donors. Since these initial reports, the HIV/AIDS situation in China has received much attention from the local and international media.|$|E
