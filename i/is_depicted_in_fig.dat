50|$|Type-2 fuzzy {{sets are}} finding very wide {{applicability}} in rule-based fuzzy logic systems (FLSs) because they let uncertainties be modeled by them whereas such uncertainties cannot be modeled by type-1 fuzzy sets. A block diagram of a type-2 FLS <b>is</b> <b>depicted</b> <b>in</b> <b>Fig.</b> 3. This kind of FLS {{is used in}} fuzzy logic control, fuzzy logic signal processing, rule-based classification, etc., and is {{sometimes referred to as}} a function approximation application of fuzzy sets, because the FLS is designed to minimize an error function.|$|E

From {{left to right}} it {{consists}} of a piston, a compression space, and heat exchanger (all at ambient temperature Ta), a regenerator, and a heat exchanger, expansion space, and a piston (all at the low temperature TL). Left and right the thermal contact with the surroundings at the temperatures Ta and TL {{is supposed to be}} perfect so that the compression and expansion are isothermal. The work, performed during the expansion, is used to reduce the total input power. Usually helium is the working fluid.|$|E
50|$|Besides {{the focus}} on {{semi-autonomous}} system control, the MASSiVE framework includes a second main paradigm, namely the pre-structuring of task knowledge. This task planner input is specified offline in a scenario and model driven approach {{with the help of}} so-called process-structures on two levels of abstraction, the abstract level and the elementary level. After specification and before being used for task execution, the task knowledge is verified offline, to guarantee a robust runtime behavior. This development process model provides a structured guidance and enforce consistency throughout the whole process, so that uniform implementations and maintainability are achieved. Furthermore, it guides through development and test of system core functionality (skills). The whole paradigm <b>is</b> <b>depicted</b> <b>in</b> <b>Fig.</b> 3.|$|E

5000|$|The {{software}} framework MASSiVE (Multi-layer Architecture for Semi-autonomous Service robots with Verified task Execution) [...] {{is a special}} kind of hybrid multi-layer control architecture which is tailored to the requirements of semi-autonomous and distributed systems, like the care-providing robot FRIEND, acting in environments with distributed smart components. These intelligent wheelchair mounted manipulator systems allow to benefit from the inclusion of the user's cognitive capabilities into task execution and consequently lower the system complexity compared to a fully autonomous system. The semi-autonomous control requires a sophisticated integration of a human-machine-interface (HMI) which is able to couple input devices according to the user's impairment, for example a haptic suit, eye-mouse, speech-recognition, chin joystick or a brain-computer interface (BCI). The resulting MASSiVE control architecture with special emphasis on the HMI component <b>is</b> <b>depicted</b> <b>in</b> <b>Fig.</b> 2. Here, the deliberator has been moved to the sequencer component, and the HMI has direct access to control the actuators in the reactive layer during user interactions (e.g., to move the camera, until the desired object to be manipulated is in field of view).|$|E
50|$|Figure 5 shows a {{so-called}} DC SQUID. It {{consists of two}} superconductors connected by two weak links. The fluxoid quantization of a loop through the two bulk superconductors and the two weak links demandsIf the self-inductance of the loop can be neglected the magnetic flux in the loop Φ {{is equal to the}} applied fluxwith B the magnetic field, applied perpendicular to the surface, and A the surface area of the loop. The total supercurrent is given bySubstitution of Eq(33) in (35) givesUsing a well known geometrical formula we getSince the sin-function can vary only between −1 and +1 a steady solution is only possible if the applied current is below a critical current given byNote that the critical current is periodic in the applied flux with period Φ₀. The dependence of the critical current on the applied flux <b>is</b> <b>depicted</b> <b>in</b> <b>Fig.</b> 6. It has a strong resemblance with the interference pattern generated by a laser beam behind a double slit. In practice the critical current is not zero at half integer values of the flux quantum of the applied flux. This {{is due to the fact}} that the self-inductance of the loop cannot be neglected.|$|E
30|$|The {{occurrence}} of a steep plasma gradient, {{necessary for the}} ballooning instability, inevitably causes the drift effects. Including the drift compressional mode and its coupling with Alfvén mode changes the situation dramatically. The dispersion relation (10) becomes a fourth-order equation with respect to ω.

The temperature and nanoparticle concentration profiles for different values of nanofluid buoyancy ratio parameter are presented <b>in</b> <b>Fig.</b> 11 a, b, respectively. Thermal and nanoparticle boundary layer thickness decrease by increasing the nanofluid buoyancy ratio parameter.|$|R
30|$|To verify and {{intuitively}} {{inspect the}} effectiveness of the proposed directional mutation operator, we apply PSEA-m to solve a bi-objective benchmark optimization problem, that is, DTLZ 2, and observe the distribution of a set-based individual before and after mutation in the objective space at the 1 st, 10 th, 30 th, and 70 th generations. The experimental results <b>are</b> <b>depicted</b> <b>in</b> <b>Fig.</b> 3, where the rectangular area is the preferred region and points and circles represent solutions in a set-based individual before and after mutation, respectively.|$|R
5000|$|In {{order to}} cope with the above {{described}} problems in the care-providing robot FRIEND the special vision system ROVIS (RObust machine VIsion for Service robotics) [...] was developed. The structure of ROVIS <b>is</b> <b>depicted</b> <b>in</b> <b>Fig.</b> 5. There are two main ROVIS components: hardware and object recognition and reconstruction chain. The connection between ROVIS and the overall robot control system is represented by the World Model where ROVIS stores the processed visual information. At the initialization phase of ROVIS the extrinsic camera parameters needed for 3D object reconstruction and the transformation between stereo camera and manipulator which is necessary for vision based object manipulation are calculated by the Camera Calibration module. The object recognition and reconstruction chain consists of robust algorithms for object recognition and 3D reconstruction for the purpose of reliable manipulation motion planning and grasping in unstructured environments and variable illumination conditions. Therefore, an accuracy of 5mm for the estimated 3D pose is necessary which enforces very good and precise algorithms. In ROVIS, robustness must be understood as the capability to the system to adapt to varying operational conditions and is realized through the inclusion feedback mechanisms at the image processing level and also between different hardware and software components of the vision system. A core part of the system is the automatic, closed-loop calculation of an image Region of Interest (ROI) on which vision methods are applied. By using a ROI the performance of object recognition and 3D reconstruction can be improved since the scene complexity is reduced.|$|E

30|$|We {{choose the}} “fast pneu-net” (fPN) design [51] for the bending {{actuators}} of our soft robot {{because it requires}} less pressure for the same curvature and can achieve higher bending speeds and forces compared to similar actuator designs. In order to realize a functional integration, the supply tubes are used as the bending actuators’ non-stretchable parts. Furthermore, the bending actuators forming the soft robot’s legs are equipped with side walls for increased stiffness. The partially cut CAD models of the bending actuator designs used in our soft robot <b>are</b> <b>depicted</b> <b>in</b> <b>Fig.</b> 7.|$|R

However, {{with the increase}} of substrate temperature in the in situ annealing treatment, an attenuation of electrical performance was revealed. The subthreshold swing exhibited an obvious trend of increment along with the in situ annealing temperature, which implies a relatively high trap density at the interface between the dielectric and semiconductor layer [27].|$|R

Additionally, the RSSE (1, 1, 1, 1, 1) equalizer has a very close performance to classical DFE equalizers.

30|$|RQ 2 : Significance of {{performance}} overhead. To put the absolute performance overhead measurements into perspective, we have executed our benchmarks {{in two different}} environments: (i) a remote single-node MongoDB instance, and (ii) a 9 -node MongoDB cluster. These concrete setups <b>are</b> <b>depicted</b> <b>in</b> <b>Fig.</b> 2. <b>In</b> both cases, the actual execution of the benchmark is done on a separate machine to avoid CPU contention. The inserted data size consumes the entire memory pool of the single node and cluster shards. Read requests are not always {{able to find the}} intended record in-memory, resulting in lookup on disk. Based on the two types of responses we determine the general impact of ONDMs on overhead for deployments of varying data set sizes and memory resources.|$|R

30|$|The {{execution}} {{times of}} the algorithms on the original database and different increment sizes <b>are</b> <b>depicted</b> <b>in</b> <b>Fig.</b> 10 a, b, respectively. Figure 10 c on the other hand, illustrates the runtime invested by the algorithms on updated database {{with respect to the}} original database. From the figures, we can observe that the performance of the algorithms degrade upon addition of the increments. The execution time spent on the updated database is quite higher than the original database and it kept on increasing with smaller increments to very large increments. This is quite obvious since the algorithms run from scratch when new transactions are added to the original data. This clearly establishes the inefficiency of the rare pattern mining techniques in handling incremental data and the need of competent techniques for handling the same with greater adaptability.|$|R
