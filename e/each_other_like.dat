5|$|The {{genitalia}} of {{the male}} and female in any particular species are adapted to fit <b>each</b> <b>other</b> <b>like</b> a lock (male) and key (female). In males, the ninth abdominal segment is divided into a dorsal 'tegumen' and ventral 'viniculum'. They form a ring-like structure for the attachment of genital parts and a pair of lateral clasping organs (claspers or 'harpe'). The male has a median tubular organ (called the aedeagus) which is extended through an eversible sheath (or 'vesica') to inseminate the female. The males have paired sperm ducts in all lepidopterans; the paired testes are separate in basal taxa and fused in advanced forms.|$|E
25|$|There {{are also}} some words with two vowels {{occurring}} next to <b>each</b> <b>other</b> <b>like</b> in iate and sábio may be pronounced both as rising diphthongs or hiatus.|$|E

50|$|A grasp {{is an act}} of taking, holding or seizing firmly with (or as if with) the hand. An {{example of}} a grasp is the handshake, wherein two people grasp one of <b>each</b> <b>other's</b> <b>like</b> hands.|$|R
5000|$|Play {{can take}} many forms. It ranges from light [...] "getting to know you" [...] {{sessions}} where participants discover <b>each</b> <b>other's</b> <b>likes</b> and dislikes to extreme, extended play between committed individuals that know <b>each</b> <b>other's</b> limits {{and are willing to}} push or be pushed at their boundaries. While physical activities are better known and more infamous, it also includes 'mental play' such as erotic hypnosis and mind games.|$|R
25|$|Static {{electricity}} is usually caused when certain materials are rubbed against <b>each</b> <b>other,</b> <b>like</b> wool on plastic or {{the soles of}} shoes on carpet.

25|$|In 1992, Tyne Tees {{dropped their}} famous logo {{which they had}} {{previously}} been using since 1970 and opted instead for four separate letters stacked atop <b>each</b> <b>other</b> <b>like</b> previously accomplished spelling TTTV. The form up was over a grey background with a line moving across the screen, forming the letters as they went.|$|E
25|$|The {{vocabulary}} of Teochew shares {{a lot of}} similarities with Cantonese because of their continuous contact with <b>each</b> <b>other.</b> <b>Like</b> Cantonese, Teochew {{has a great deal}} of monosyllabic words. However, ever since the standardisation of Modern Standard Chinese, Teochew has absorbed a lot of Putonghua vocabulary, which is predominantly polysyllabic. Also, Teochew varieties in Singapore, Malaysia and Indonesia have also borrowed extensively from Malay.|$|E

25|$|The Gall–Peters {{projection}} is {{a rectangular}} map projection that maps all areas {{such that they}} have the correct sizes relative to <b>each</b> <b>other.</b> <b>Like</b> any equal-area projection, it achieves this goal by distorting most shapes. The projection is a particular example of the cylindrical equal-area projection in that it sets latitudes 45° north and south as the regions on the map that have no distortion.|$|E
25|$|Another study (Chen & Li, 2001) sequenced 53 non-repetitive, intergenic DNA {{segments}} from a human, a chimpanzee, a gorilla, and orangutan. When the DNA sequences were concatenated to {{a single}} long sequence, the generated neighbor-joining tree supported the Homo-Pan clade with 100% bootstrap (that is that humans and chimpanzees are the closest related species of the four). When three species are fairly closely related to <b>each</b> <b>other</b> (<b>like</b> human, chimpanzee and gorilla), the trees obtained from DNA sequence data may not be congruent with the tree that represents the speciation (species tree).|$|E
25|$|The {{concept of}} race in Brazil is complex. A Brazilian child was never {{automatically}} identified with the racial type of {{one or both of}} his or her parents, nor were there only two categories to choose from. Between an individual of unmixed West African descent and a very light mulatto individual, more than a dozen racial categories were acknowledged, based on various combinations of hair color, hair texture, eye color, and skin color. These types grade into <b>each</b> <b>other</b> <b>like</b> the colors of the spectrum, and no one category stands significantly isolated from the rest. In Brazil, people are classified by appearance, not heredity.|$|E

25|$|The wave theory {{predicted}} that light waves could interfere with <b>each</b> <b>other</b> <b>like</b> sound waves (as noted around 1800 by Thomas Young). Young showed {{by means of}} a diffraction experiment that light behaved as waves. He also proposed that different colours were caused by different wavelengths of light, and explained colour vision in terms of three-coloured receptors in the eye. Another supporter of the wave theory was Leonhard Euler. He argued in Nova theoria lucis et colorum (1746) that diffraction could more easily be explained by a wave theory. In 1816 André-Marie Ampère gave Augustin-Jean Fresnel an idea that the polarization of light {{can be explained by the}} wave theory if light were a transverse wave.|$|E
25|$|First, there's {{the idea}} of the {{movement}} of the train, and then that of the sad young man who is in a corridor and who is moving about; thus there are two parallel movements corresponding to each other. Then, there is the distortion of the young man—I had called this elementary parallelism. It was a formal decomposition; that is, linear elements following <b>each</b> <b>other</b> <b>like</b> parallels and distorting the object. The object is completely stretched out, as if elastic. The lines follow each other in parallels, while changing subtly to form the movement, or the form of the young man in question. I also used this procedure in the Nude Descending a Staircase.|$|E
25|$|Unusually among basal sauropodomorphs, Xingxiulong {{has four}} sacral vertebrae. This is a trait {{typically}} seen in more derived sauropodomorphs, like Melanorosaurus, Leonerasaurus, Barapasaurus, and Shunosaurus. The {{first of these}} sacral vertebrae, the dorsosacral, is not very well-fused to the next sacral vertebra; neither is it entirely fused to the corresponding sacral rib on the transverse processes. Collectively, the dorsosacral and first pair of sacral ribs extend forward to contact the ilium. The second and third sacral vertebrae, the two primordial sacrals, {{are about the same}} length, and are well-fused to <b>each</b> <b>other.</b> <b>Like</b> other basal sauropodomorphs, the transverse processes of the third sacral vertebra project backwards and outwards. The same is true of the transverse process and sacral ribs for the fourth sacral vertebra, which contact the ilium again at the back. All of the neural spines are plate-like, like the last few dorsal vertebrae.|$|E

25|$|Prior to any {{physical}} examination, {{the diagnosis of}} keratoconus frequently begins with an ophthalmologist's or optometrist's assessment of the person's medical history, particularly the chief complaint and other visual symptoms, the presence of any history of ocular disease or injury which might affect vision, {{and the presence of}} any family history of ocular disease. An eye chart, such as a standard Snellen chart of progressively smaller letters, is then used to determine the person's visual acuity. The eye examination may proceed to measurement of the localized curvature of the cornea with a manual keratometer, with detection of irregular astigmatism suggesting a possibility of keratoconus. Severe cases can exceed the instrument's measuring ability. A further indication can be provided by retinoscopy, in which a light beam is focused on the person's retina and the reflection, or reflex, observed as the examiner tilts the light source back and forth. Keratoconus is amongst the ophthalmic conditions that exhibit a scissor reflex action of two bands moving toward and away from <b>each</b> <b>other</b> <b>like</b> the blades of a pair of scissors.|$|E
25|$|From 26 April 2013, in the {{run up to}} the elections, {{both the}} PML-N and the Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) started to criticise <b>each</b> <b>other</b> <b>like</b> never before. In the run up to the elections, Imran Khan {{challenged}} Sharif for a live television debate. Sharif immediately rebuffed the offer. However, during the confrontations, Khan was accused of personally attacking Sharif and as a result, the Election Commission of Pakistan gave notice to Khan because political candidates should refrain from personal attacks on others. Khan denied he was launching personal attacks on Sharif. On 18 August 2014, Khan announced his party would renounce all its seats it won in the 2013 elections, claiming the elections were rigged, a claim he had made before. He accused Sharif of plundering the national wealth, and demanded his resignation. He called on the public to withhold taxes and payment of utility bills to force the government to resign. On 22 August 2014 Khan and his fellow 33 PTI lawmakers resigned from the national assembly. He called for a caretaker government to be formed composing non-political people, and for fresh elections.|$|E
