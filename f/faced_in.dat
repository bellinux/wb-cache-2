40|$|In this study, we {{examined}} whether {{the detection of}} frontal, ¾, and profile face views differs from their categorization as <b>faces.</b> <b>In</b> Experiment 1, we compared three tasks that required observers to determine {{the presence or absence}} of a <b>face,</b> but varied <b>in</b> the extents to which participants had to search for the <b>faces</b> <b>in</b> simple displays and in small or large scenes to make this decision. Performance was equivalent for all of the <b>face</b> views <b>in</b> simple displays and small scenes, but it was notably slower for profile views when this required the search for <b>faces</b> <b>in</b> extended scene displays. This search effect was confirmed in Experiment 2, in which we compared observers’ eye movements with their response times to <b>faces</b> <b>in</b> visual scenes. These results demonstrate that the categorization of faces at fixation is dissociable from the detection of <b>faces</b> <b>in</b> space. Consequently, we suggest that face detection should be studied with extended visual displays, such as natural scenes...|$|R

5|$|Apart from Bank, {{which was}} {{completely}} below ground, all stations had buildings designed by Harry Bell Measures.

The electricity to run the trains and the stations was supplied from the power station at Wood Lane at 5,000V AC which was converted at sub-stations along the route to 550V DC to power the trains via a third rail system.|$|E

5|$|In 1994, the Indonesian Sumatran Tiger Conservation Strategy {{addressed}} the potential crisis that tigers <b>faced</b> <b>in</b> Sumatra. The Sumatran Tiger Project (STP) was initiated in June 1995 {{in and around}} the Way Kambas National Park in order to ensure the long-term viability of wild Sumatran tigers and to accumulate data on tiger life-history characteristics vital for the management of wild populations. By August 1999, the teams of the STP had evaluated 52 sites of potential tiger habitat in Lampung Province, of which only 15 these were intact enough to contain tigers. In the framework of the STP a community-based conservation programme was initiated to document the tiger-human dimension in the park in order to enable conservation authorities to resolve tiger-human conflicts based on a comprehensive database rather than anecdotes and opinions.|$|E
