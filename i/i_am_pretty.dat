And it is like the most extreme long-distance relationship, which <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>pretty</b> good at as it turns out in real life. My baby mama is in another universe. I think he has to find out, but I don’t know exactly how we’re gonna work that out yet. As with other Fringe episodes, Fox released a science lesson plan in collaboration with Science Olympiad for grade school children, focusing on the science seen in [...] "Immortality", with the intention of having [...] "students learn about the influenza virus and how it spreads and impacts its host." ...|$|E

Australian Chairman of Selectors, Andrew Hilditch, stated before the team for the match was announced: [...] "If we play a {{specialist}} spinner, which <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>pretty</b> sure we will be, it will be Xavier", which showed the likelihood that Doherty would make his Test and Ashes debuts simultaneously. He took his first Test wicket by dismissing Ian Bell in Brisbane.|$|E

2500|$|Dzierzon's {{questioning}} of papal infallibility {{caused him to}} be retired him from the priesthood in 1869. This disagreement, along with his public engagement in local politics, led to his 1873 excommunication. In 1884 he moved back to Lowkowitz, settling in the hamlet An der Grenze, (Granice Łowkowskie). Of his new home, he wrote:In every direction, one has a broad and pleasant view, and <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>pretty</b> happy here, despite the isolation, as I am always close to my beloved bees — which, if one's soul be receptive to {{the works of the}} Almighty and the wonders of nature, can transform even a desert into a paradise. From 1873 to 1902 Dzierzon was in contact with the Old Catholic Church, [...] but in April 1905 he was reconciled with the Roman Catholic Church.|$|E

2500|$|In October 1934 Abe {{was arrested}} in a police raid on the {{unlicensed}} brothel at which she {{was working at the}} time. Kinnosuke Kasahara, a well-connected friend of the brothel owner, arranged for her release. He was attracted to Abe, finding that she had no debts, and with Abe's agreement, made her his mistress. Kasahara set up a house for Abe on December 20, 1934, and also provided her with an income. In his deposition to the police, he remembered, [...] "She was really strong, a real powerful one. Even though <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>pretty</b> jaded, she was enough to astound me. She wasn't satisfied unless we did it two, three, or four times a night. To her, it was unacceptable unless I had my hand on her private parts all night long... At first it was great, but after a couple of weeks I got a little exhausted." [...] When Abe suggested that Kasahara leave his wife to marry her, he refused. She then asked Kasahara to allow her to take another lover, which he also refused to do. Afterwards, their relationship ended, and to escape him Abe left for Nagoya. Kasahara ended his testimony with an angry remark about Abe, [...] "She is a slut and a whore. And as what she has done makes clear, she is a woman whom men should fear." [...] Likewise, Abe remembered Kasahara in less than flattering terms, saying, [...] "He didn't love me and treated me like an animal. He was the kind of scum who would then plead with me when I said that we should break up." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "Ah," [...] said Wyndham, [...] "I wondered--didn't think you'd {{carelessly}} stop too long. In fact, <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>pretty</b> anxious until <b>I</b> {{heard the}} gun. But do you reckon somebody did push off the dinghy?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>pretty</b> mad by this time, {{as you can}} guess. It {{is funny}} {{when you come to}} think of it afterwards, but the wonder then <b>was</b> that <b>I</b> didn't punch his head.|$|R

I get fan mail now from people who weren't really born yet when the book came out. I don't think it's a perfect book by any means, but it's valid. I get where it comes from. I get what it <b>is.</b> <b>I</b> know that sounds so ambiguous. It's sort of out of my hands and it has its reputation, so what can you do about it? There's a lot of it that <b>I</b> wish <b>was</b> {{slightly}} more elegantly written. Overall, <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>pretty</b> shocked.

5000|$|... #Caption: Jamie Dornan commented of his character's exit, [...] "It's pretty gruesome, but you know, it's {{a little}} bit cool. Not many people get to die like that... As TV deaths go, <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>pretty</b> happy." ...|$|R
60|$|By {{this time}} I {{had succeeded in}} raising myself on my elbow, and, by {{the dim light of}} a hanging lamp somewhere down the passage, <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>pretty</b> well able to take stock of my surroundings.|$|R
60|$|I did so, and {{a moment}} later we <b>were</b> off. <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>pretty</b> {{confident}} that Mr. Allen Price had not witnessed my departure, and I hoped he would not find it out for some hours to come.|$|R

50|$|It was sad at first, {{but once}} I {{realized}} how <b>I</b> <b>was</b> {{going to die}} in it, then it was cool. It was a cool death, and it was {{always going to be a}} good death, so at the same time, <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>pretty</b> happy.|$|R
