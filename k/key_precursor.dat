5|$|Three Studies for Figures at the Base of a Crucifixion is a <b>key</b> <b>precursor</b> to Bacon's later work, and he {{sustained}} {{its formal}} and thematic preoccupations throughout his career. The triptych format, {{the placement of}} figures behind glass in heavily gilded frames, the open mouth, the use of painterly distortion, the Furies, and {{the theme of the}} Crucifixion were all to reappear in later works. Bacon's principal mode of expression is introduced: the subjects are anatomically and physically distorted, and the mood is violent, foreboding, and relentlessly physical. In other respects the triptych stands apart from other paintings in his oeuvre. It refers directly to its inspirations, and interprets the source material in an uncharacteristically literal manner. The triptych is further distinct in that its creatures are located in an outside space; by 1948, Bacon's studies of heads and figures specifically emphasised their confinement in rooms or other closed spaces.|$|E
5|$|The {{emerging}} {{discipline of}} geology also brought {{natural history and}} natural philosophy closer together; {{the establishment of the}} stratigraphic column linked the spatial distribution of organisms to their temporal distribution, a <b>key</b> <b>precursor</b> to concepts of evolution. Georges Cuvier and others made great strides in comparative anatomy and paleontology in the late 1790s and early 19th century. In a series of lectures and papers that made detailed comparisons between living mammals and fossil remains Cuvier was able to establish that the fossils were remains of species that had become extinct—rather than being remains of species still alive elsewhere in the world, as had been widely believed. Fossils discovered and described by Gideon Mantell, William Buckland, Mary Anning, and Richard Owen among others helped establish that there had been an 'age of reptiles' that had preceded even the prehistoric mammals. These discoveries captured the public imagination and focused attention on the history of life on earth. Most of these geologists held to catastrophism, but Charles Lyell's influential Principles of Geology (1830) popularised Hutton's uniformitarianism, a theory that explained the geological past and present on equal terms.|$|E

25|$|The major uses of phenol, {{consuming}} {{two thirds}} of its production, involve its conversion to precursors for plastics. Condensation with acetone gives bisphenol-A, a <b>key</b> <b>precursor</b> to polycarbonates and epoxide resins. Condensation of phenol, alkylphenols, or diphenols with formaldehyde gives phenolic resins, a famous example of which is Bakelite. Partial hydrogenation of phenol gives cyclohexanone, a precursor to nylon. Nonionic detergents are produced by alkylation of phenol to give the alkylphenols, e.g., nonylphenol, which are then subjected to ethoxylation.|$|E
500|$|Conway {{described}} the panel as indicating [...] "an astonishing depth of psychological insight" [...] {{for an artist}} not yet 20 years old. In its simple design and detail it shares many of the characteristics of, and is a <b>key</b> <b>precursor</b> to, Dürer's mature work. He [...] portrayed his father again in 1497, when the older man would have been around 70. He has aged noticeably in the intervening seven years: his skin is saggier, the wrinkles deeper and more pronounced. In this later portrait Dürer seems at pains to convey these effects of ageing, which are all too evident on his father's face. According to Brion, his eyes have lost their [...] "distant, mystic" [...] appearance and now seem less contented. Conway agrees, seeing traces of haggardly agitation, but holds that the two paintings convey a similar overall highly favourable and compassionate impression of the man.|$|E
