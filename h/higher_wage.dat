25|$|The basic {{supply and}} demand model implies that by mandating a price floor above the {{equilibrium}} wage, minimum wage laws should cause unemployment. This is because {{a greater number of}} people are willing to work at the <b>higher</b> <b>wage</b> while a smaller number of jobs will be available at the <b>higher</b> <b>wage.</b> Companies can be more selective in those whom they employ thus the least skilled and least experienced will typically be excluded. An imposition or increase of a minimum wage will generally only affect employment in the low-skill labor market, as the equilibrium wage is already at or below the minimum wage, whereas in higher skill labor markets the equilibrium wage is too high for a change in minimum wage to affect employment.|$|E

25|$|To {{emphasize}} {{the work ethic}} in Protestantism relative to Catholics, he notes a common problem that industrialists face when employing precapitalist laborers: Agricultural entrepreneurs will try to encourage time spent harvesting by offering a <b>higher</b> <b>wage,</b> {{with the expectation that}} laborers will see time spent working as more valuable and so engage it longer. However, in precapitalist societies this often results in laborers spending less time harvesting. Laborers judge that they can earn the same, while spending less time working and having more leisure. He also notes that societies having more Protestants are those that have a more developed capitalist economy.|$|E
25|$|In 1993, {{during the}} KCLC’s Labor Day picnic, a yearly {{institution}} that {{had replaced the}} annual Labor Day Parade, Washington Governor Mike Lowry expressed {{his support for the}} North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA). NAFTA was widely opposed by the U.S. labor movement and Lowry’s announcement was not well received. The agreement proposed to allow the free movement of goods, services and investments between the United States, Canada and Mexico without restrictions. Labor’s position in opposition centered on concerns relating to a wage “race to the bottom” if the <b>higher</b> <b>wage</b> U.S. economy was forced to compete directly with the relatively low wages of Mexico.|$|E
25|$|The {{emergence}} {{of high school}} education in the Philippines, however, did not occur until 1910. It was borne out of rising numbers in enrollment, widespread economic depression, and a growing demand by big businesses and technological advances in factories and the {{emergence of}} electrification for skilled workers. In order to meet this new job demand, high schools were created and the curriculum focused on practical job skills that would better prepare students for professional white collar or skilled blue collar work. This proved to be beneficial for both the employer and the employee; the investment in human capital caused employees to become more efficient, which lowered costs for the employer, and skilled employees received a <b>higher</b> <b>wage</b> than those employees with just primary educational attainment.|$|E

50|$|A second policy {{relating}} to care {{work is the}} push for <b>higher</b> <b>wages</b> {{in the sphere of}} paid care work. Advocates of this policy believe that individuals who respect and fulfill norms of care will be seen as losers in the competitive economic game, if wages are not increased. Due to this stigma, some economists argue {{that there may be a}} gradual erosion of the supply of unpaid care services in the system. Therefore, in order to encourage care work, these proponents advocate for <b>higher</b> <b>wages</b> for care work. However, not all feminist economists believe that <b>higher</b> <b>wages</b> would be appropriate for care work. For example, those who ascribe to the commoditization of emotion framework argue that <b>higher</b> <b>wages</b> may push out true caring emotions in care workers.|$|R
25|$|A {{minimum wage}} {{is the lowest}} {{remuneration}} that employers can legally pay their workers. Equivalently, it is the price floor below which workers may not sell their labor. Although minimum wage laws are in effect in many jurisdictions, differences of opinion exist about the benefits and drawbacks of a minimum wage. Supporters of the minimum wage say it increases {{the standard of living}} of workers, reduces poverty, reduces inequality, and boosts morale. In contrast, opponents of the minimum wage say it increases poverty, increases unemployment (particularly among unskilled or inexperienced workers) and is damaging to businesses, because excessively high minimum wages require businesses to raise the prices of their product or service to accommodate the extra expense of paying a <b>higher</b> <b>wage.</b>|$|E
25|$|Charles' next club {{would be}} Welsh Football League side Porthmadog.

Despite enjoying his time in North Wales, {{he decided that he}} could not turn down an offer to return to the Football League by Port Vale, then managed by Stanley Matthews. Port Vale paid Porthmadog a £1,250 fee, and Charles made his Vale debut in a 1–0 defeat at local rivals Crewe Alexandra on 3 February 1967. He played a further six games, including a rough encounter with Walsall, another one of Vale's rivals, before he decided to head back to Wales.|$|E

They could, however, identify fair trade based on some of its possible benefits to their community. When asked, overall, farmers cited that fair trade has had a positive effect on their lives and communities. They also wanted consumers to know that fair trade is important for supporting their families and their cooperatives.|$|E

500|$|Walsh {{was signed}} by First Division (second tier) club Portsmouth for a £400,000 fee in June 1992. In order to tempt {{him out of the}} top-flight [...] "Pompey" [...] manager Jim Smith offered him a {{four-year}} contract on a <b>higher</b> <b>wage</b> than he had been on at Spurs, whilst the club also bought his London home off him in order to facilitate his move to the south coast. In his autobiography he admitted that he was not keen on joining Portsmouth, but stated that he decided to take a much more professional approach to his career in terms of training and eating healthier food so as to start the 1992–93 pre-season in good physical condition; he credited his new approach to the birth of his first child. Ironically though a virus picked up on a family holiday to Saint Lucia caused him to miss a month early in the season and drained him of fitness. He recovered to build a strike partnership with Guy Whittingham, whilst midfielders Alan McLoughlin and Mark Chamberlain made an effective four-pronged attack, and with two games to go Portsmouth were top of the table and needed only to beat relegation threatened Sunderland to secure an automatic promotion place. However they lost the match 4–1 and Walsh was sent off; he wrecked the Roker Park dressing rooms in retaliation. He was suspended for the play-off games, and Portsmouth lost at the semi-final stage to Leicester City. Despite Whittingham scoring 47 league and cup goals, it was Walsh who the fans voted as their Player of the Year.|$|E

40|$|Based on linked employer-employee panel data on all Swedish inventors, {{this paper}} {{analyses}} how wages affect inventors' job mobility. It is commonly assumed that <b>higher</b> <b>wages</b> reduce mobility because they reduce {{the value of}} outside opportunities. We argue that <b>higher</b> <b>wages</b> also send performance signals to potential employers, who raise their wage offers in response. By disentangling the effects of <b>higher</b> <b>wages,</b> we show evidence of a utility and an opportunity cost effect, which reduce mobility, and a performance-signalling effect, which increases mobility. In our data, the effects cancel each other out, with no effects of wages on mobility rates on average. We find, however, that for star inventors, who have sufficiently strong alternative performance signals (e. g., strong patent records), the performance signal sent by wages is crowded out by the alternative signals. Accordingly, for star inventors we find that <b>higher</b> <b>wages</b> decrease mobility...|$|R
2500|$|Three other {{possible}} reasons minimum wages do not affect employment were suggested by Alan Blinder: higher wages may reduce turnover, and hence training costs; raising {{the minimum wage}} may [...] "render moot" [...] the potential problem of recruiting workers at a <b>higher</b> <b>wage</b> than current workers; and minimum wage workers might represent such {{a small proportion of}} a business's cost that the increase is too small to matter.

2500|$|At {{very low}} wage levels, near the {{subsistence}} level, the supply curve {{may also be}} curved backwards for a completely different reason. That effect creates an [...] "inverted S" [...] or [...] "backward S" [...] shape: a tail is added {{at the bottom of}} the labour-supply curve shown in the graph above with the quantity of labour-time supplied falling as wages rise. Then, because families face some minimum level of income needed to meet their subsistence requirements, lowering wages increases the amount of labour-time offered for sale. [...] Similarly, a rise in wages can cause a decrease in the amount of labour-time offered for sale, and individuals take advantage of the <b>higher</b> <b>wage</b> to spend time on needed self- or family-maintenance activities.|$|E
40|$|This paper {{argues that}} Sweden's {{structural}} problems of slow productivity growth and <b>high</b> <b>wage</b> inflation {{can be linked}} in an important way to the institutional features of its labor market, which {{is characterized by a}} combination of centralized bargaining and wage equalization. In particular, Sweden's <b>high</b> <b>wage</b> inflation in the 1980 s was due to the combined impact of the breakdown of the leading role assigned to the traded goods sector in <b>wage</b> determination and <b>high</b> <b>wage</b> drift. Slow productivity growth is attributed to the inappropriateness of the policy of wage equalization in an environment in which flexible work practices have become increasingly important. ...|$|R

The union, however, was pushing the Wage Stabilization Board (WSB), another ESA agency, to grant the workers a significantly <b>higher</b> <b>wage.</b> [...] President Truman and Putnam were convinced that the key to taming inflation was to break the price/wage spiral in which higher wages pushed prices higher, only to induce workers to seek even higher wages to overcome the inflation in prices.|$|E
2500|$|Any given raw {{wage gap}} can be {{decomposed}} into an explained part, due {{to differences in}} characteristics such as education, hours worked, work experience, and occupation, and/or an unexplained part, which is typically attributed to discrimination. This may be further explained when America takes into account that men are more likely to negotiate for higher pay. [...] According to a study by Carnegie Mellon, when negotiating pay, 83% of men negotiated for a <b>higher</b> <b>wage</b> compared to the 58% of women who asked for more. Researchers say that women who do request either a raise or a higher starting salary are {{more likely than men to}} be penalized for those actions. Cornell University economists Francine Blau and Lawrence Kahn stated that while the overall size of the wage gap has decreased somewhat over time, the proportion of the gap that is unexplained by human capital variables is increasing.|$|E
2500|$|As wages {{increase}} {{above the}} subsistence level (discussed below), {{there are two}} considerations affecting a worker's choice of how many hours to work per unit of time (usually day, week, or month). The first is the substitution or incentive effect. With wages rising, the tradeoff between working an additional hour for pay and taking one extra hour of unpaid time changes in favor of working. Thus, more hours of labour-time will be offered at the <b>higher</b> <b>wage</b> than the lower one. The second and countervailing effect is that the hours worked at the old wage rate now all gain more income than before, creating an income effect, which encourages more leisure to be chosen {{because it is more}} affordable. Most economists assume that unpaid time (or [...] "leisure") is a normal good and so people want more of it as their incomes (or wealth) rise. Since a rising wage rate raises incomes, all else constant, the attraction of unpaid time rises, eventually neutralising the substitution effect and causing the backward bend.|$|E
