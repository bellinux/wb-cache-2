On {{the basis}} of {{research}} in foreign countries on the relationship among technological progress, rebound <b>effect</b> <b>and</b> energy efficiency, the paper mainly from the following two aspects to study relationship among technological progress, rebound <b>effect</b> <b>and</b> energy efficiency in China. First of all, it studies mechanism of rebound effect on {{the basis of}} technological progress. It is mainly from the direct rebound effect, indirect rebound <b>effect</b> <b>and</b> economy-wide rebound <b>effect</b> of energy efficiency for the analysis of the mechanism of action. Secondly, it studies both theoretical research and empirical analysis on rebound effect based on technological progress relationship with energy efficiency. Based on the actual situation in China, it researches "Jevons paradox " led to the relationship between rebound <b>effect</b> <b>and</b> energy efficiency both theory analysis and empirical test. Through the above study, we expect to offer useful references for China’s research on the relationship among technological progress, rebound <b>effect</b> <b>and</b> energy efficiency...|$|R
