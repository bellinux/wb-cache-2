5000|$|The Generality Constraint, {{according}} to Evans, {{is intended to}} capture the structure that there is in thought.

The Generality Constraint requires that if one is to have a thought (that <b>John</b> <b>is</b> happy, for example) about an object (John), then one must be able to conceive of the object (John) as having different properties (such as being sad).|$|R

5|$|Shortly {{after his}} birth, <b>John</b> <b>was</b> passed from Eleanor into {{the care of}} a wet nurse, a {{traditional}} practice for medieval noble families. Eleanor then left for Poitiers, the capital of Aquitaine, and sent John and his sister Joan north to Fontevrault Abbey. This may have been done with the aim of steering her youngest son, with no obvious inheritance, towards a future ecclesiastical career. Eleanor spent the next few years conspiring against her husband Henry and neither parent played a part in John's very early life. <b>John</b> <b>was</b> probably, like his brothers, assigned a magister whilst he was at Fontevrault, a teacher charged with his early education and with managing the servants of his immediate household; <b>John</b> <b>was</b> later taught by Ranulf de Glanvill, a leading English administrator.
