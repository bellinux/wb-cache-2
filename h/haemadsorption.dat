40|$|International audienceThe Mycoplasma synoviae {{haemagglutinin}} gene, vlhA, encodes {{two major}} immunodominant and surface-exposed membrane proteins, MSPB and MSPA. Both products are antigenically variable but only MSPA mediates binding to erythrocytes. Previously {{we have shown}} that M. synoviae type strain WVU 1853 could express a variant vlhA gene, referred to as MS 2 / 28. 1, with a considerably shorter and divergent MSPA region. A finding that prompted detailed characterization of its antigenic and functional properties. Here we mutagenized {{each of the six}} opal codons of the variant MS 2 / 28. 1 vlhA member into tryptophan, thus allowing its expression in Escherichia coli as well as its cleavage products, MSPB and MSPA. In addition, we expressed 5 contiguous regions of MS 2 / 28. 1 extending from the last part of MSPB to the C-terminus of MSPA. Colony immunostaining with region-specific antisera mapped antigenic variation to the N-terminal half of MS 2 / 28. 1 MSPA. No haemagglutinating activity was observed for MSPB, but consistent <b>haemadsorption</b> inhibition was mapped to the region extending from amino acid 325 to 344. Inhibition of both haemagglutination and <b>haemadsorption</b> activities were obtained with sera directed against the C-terminal region of MSPA, with the highest titers (1 / 320 and 1 / 160, respectively) being recorded for its last 60 residues. Importantly, antibodies to this region also yielded the highest metabolic inhibition titer of 1 / 1280. Overall, aside from mapping the functional domains of a M. synoviae highly divergent haemagglutinin gene, this study shows that the C-terminal half of its MSPA region induced the highest titers of antibodies inhibiting haemagglutination, <b>haemadsorption,</b> and metabolism...|$|E
40|$|A ring zone effect {{noted with}} the radial {{diffusion}} disc test {{modification of the}} mixed <b>haemadsorption</b> technique has been studied using human anti-thyroid sera reacting with thyroid monolayer cultures. Results are presented which suggest that the `empty' centre of the ring zones is due to an excess of attached antibody. Sera giving the ring zone effect contain {{a larger number of}} antibody specificities than those producing filled zones. The appearance of ring zones is favoured by a low density of antigens on the culture. These findings and a number of synergistic effects produced by mixing ring and filled zone reactions are compatible with the hypothesis that the ring zone is produced when several antibodies of different specificities react with restricted antigenic areas carrying densely located clusters of antigenic determinants representing the different specificities contained in the ring zone sera. The crowding of antibodies on the clusters in the centre of the ring zones creates a steric hindrance for the indicator cells so that they are not firmly attached in this area. The antibody zone is therefore indicated as a peripheral <b>haemadsorption</b> ring...|$|E

Vero cell-adapted, plaque-forming strains derived from three field isolates at the third passage in Vero cell cultures (T 8 Ve- 3, T 11 Ve- 3 and N 13 Ve- 3) also exhibited markedly decreased binding activity, as determined by infectivity-absorption and <b>haemadsorption</b> tests. On the other hand, binding activity of the respective strains at the twentieth passage (T 8 Ve- 20, TllVe- 20 and N 13 Ve- 20) increased to practically {{the same level as}} that of the Edmonston strain, a standard strain of MV passaged long-term. A membrane immunofluorescence test revealed that the decreased binding activity to AGM-RBC of T 8 Ve- 3, TllVe- 3 and N 13 Ve- 3 was not due to decreased expression of the haemagglutinin (H) protein on the cell surface. The deduced amino acid sequence of the H protein synthesized in T 11 Ve- 3 -infected cells was identical to that in T 11 Ve- 20 -infected cells, although a single amino acid alteration was observed when T 8 Ve- 3 was compared with T 8 Ve- 20. Similarly, approximately half of the N 13 Ve- 20 -infected cells synthesized an H protein identical to that produced in N 13 Ve- 3 -infected cells, and nevertheless, exhibited markedly increased <b>haemadsorption.</b> The present results suggest that a viral protein(s) other than the H protein contributed to the binding activity of MV to AGM-RBC...|$|E

The BCV HE gene was cloned into a human adenovirus serotype 5 (Ad 5) transfer vector {{in place of}} early transcription region 3, and a helper-independent recombinant virus was constructed by rescue of the transcription unit by homologous in vivo recombination between the vector and Ad 5 genomic DNA. The BCV HE polypeptide expressed by this recombinant Ad was characterized in vivo and in vitro. A 65 K polypeptide was identified using an anti-BCV antibody in both human (293) and bovine (MDBK) cells infected with the recombinant Ad. In {{the absence of a}} reducing agent, migration of the 65 K polypeptide was shifted to 130 K, indicating that the recombinant HE polypeptide existed in a dimeric form. The HE polypeptide was glycosylated, as demonstrated by labelling with [aH]glucosamine, and was immunoreactive with three distinct groups of conformation-specific anti-HE monoclonal antibodies (MAbs). Cells infected with recombinant Ad expressing BCV HE exhibited both <b>haemadsorption</b> activity and acetylesterase activity. In addition, the anti-HE group A MAbs HC 10 - 5 and KD 9 - 40 inhibited both the <b>haemadsorption</b> activity and esterase activity of the recombinant HE polypeptide, suggesting that the antigenic domain responsible for BCV neutralization may overlap (or is closely associated with) the domain(s) responsible for haemagglutination and/or acetylesterase activities. When mice were inoculated intraperitoneally with live recombinant Ad, a significant level of BCV-neutralizing HE-specific antibody was induced.

There was good agreement between the tests. Both tests detected gliadin antibodies of IgG and IgA class in sera {{from children}} with active coeliac disease, which tended to disappear when a strict gluten-free diet was instituted. Serum antibodies to gliadin of IgA class were associated with severe small intestinal villous atrophy and were found almost exclusively in coeliac disease.

Two recombinant HAD viruses were constructed in this parental strain. In one of these the intact EP 153 R gene sequence was restored. Although restoration of the HAD phenotype did not increase virus virulence in pigs, a significant increase was observed in the number of pigs which developed viraemia. These HAD recombinant viruses replicated to titres approximately 1000 -fold higher than the parental non-HAD isolate when membrane fed to Ornithodoros erraticus ticks. Inoculation of the non-HAD isolate across the gut wall increased viral replication to levels comparable to that of the HAD recombinant viruses.

40|$|SUMMARY: Fragments {{of solid}} organs can be squashed, without {{destroying}} {{the viability of}} the cells, to form a thin sheet of cells which is stuck to polythene film with clotted mouse plasma. The film conveniently floats on a simple culture medium in which embryonic tissues multiply within 24 hr. and adult tissues survive for several days. The tissue on the polythene is thin enough to mount on a microscope slide and examine with phase-contrast illumination and an oil-immersion objective; alterna-tively, since the polythene is inert to most organic solvents, the tissue can be stained and mounted, using standard histological techniques. The squashed tissue on poly-thene is more readily infected by viruses and more easily examined than are frag-ments of tissue embedded in plasma on a coverglass. The method was used to study one virus cytopathogenic for many chick tissues and another virus detected by the <b>haemadsorption</b> phenomenon.

Antibodies directed against the large (mol. wt. 75 × IOa) and small (mol. wt. 6 I × lO 2) glyco-protein were immunologically distinct. Antiserum directed against the large glycoprotein inhibited haemagglutination, neuraminidase activity and virus infectivity, whereas antiserum against the small glycoprotein hibited haemolysis, but not haemagglutination, neuraminidase activity or virus infectivity. It is con-cluded that mumps virus contains two glycoproteins on the envelope which are equivalent to the HN and F glycoproteins described for other paramyxoviruses. Antibody activities of rabbit hyperimmune sera against untreated, Tween 8 o-ether and formalin treated purified virions were {{compared with those of}} sera against purified glycoproteins. In analogy with results obtained in studies on Sendai virus, these sera contained antibodies against both glycoprotein structures, but antibodies against thesmall glycoprotein blocking haemolysis could not be demonstrated. The effect of formalin treatment on the two glycoprotein structures was studied in mixed <b>haemadsorption</b> experiments.

Subjects primed to one of the influenza A subtypes showed more IgG and IgA responses in comparison with those unprimed (prime-effect). In contrast, IgM antibodies occurred in only 19 and 11 % of primed, but in 59 and 54 % of unprimed subjects, for A (H 3 N 2) and A (H 1 N 1), respectively. The incidence of IgM titre rises was not influenced by the prevaccination state. However, the mean magnitude of anti-A (H 1 N 1) -IgM titre rises was greater in those previously seronegative. The concepts of primary and reinfection and of 'original antigenic sin' are discussed, and it is suggested that age and, if possible, serological state prior to antigen-exposure should be taken into account when studying isotypic antibody responses after influenza infection or vaccination...|$|E
40|$|Variations in epitopes on {{structural}} proteins of four isolates of {{parainfluenza virus}} type 4 (PIV- 4) and the Mr ofpolypeptides in these isolates were d termined by {{radioimmune precipitation assay}} with monoclonal antibodies to parainfluenza virus type 4 A (PIV- 4 A) and type 4 B (PIV- 4 B). Three isolates antigenically resembled the prototype PIV- 4 A and the sizes of their structural proteins were 72 K (HN protein), 61 K (Fo protein), 61 K (NP protein) and 40 K (M protein). However, one virus isolate showed marked antigenic differences from both the 4 A and 4 B prototype viruses, {{particularly with regard to}} properties of the HN and F proteins. In addition, both the NP and Fo proteins of this isolate had a slightly increased Mr of 63 K. Human parainfluenza virus type 4 (PIV- 4), which belongs to the family Paramyxoviridae, is an important respiratory tract pathogen in infants and children. PIV- 4 was first isolated and characterized by Johnson et al. (1960). Subsequently, antigenic heterogeneity in PIV- 4 has been observed by use of polyclonal antisera in <b>haemadsorption</b> inhibition tests with different strains of PIV- 4 (Chanchola et al., 1964). This finding led to a subdivision of PIV- 4 into two serotypes, 4 A and 4 B. Recently we have generated monoclonal antibodies (MAbs) to PIV- 4 A and PIV- 4 B and identified their structural proteins (Komada et al., 1989 a, b). Th...|$|E
40|$|The mixed reverse {{solid phase}} passive antiglobulin <b>haemadsorption</b> test (MRSPAH) and the enzyme linked immunosorbant assay (ELISA) were found equally {{sensitive}} and fitted for {{the measurement of}} serum IgG antibodies against alcohol soluble gliadins. Using the ELISA method, three coeliac sera with elevated antibody titres against gliadins and two control sera with low titres were tested for IgG antibodies against the main groups of wheat proteins (acetic acid soluble glutenins, salt soluble albumins and globulins and alcohol soluble gliadins), eight fractions of gliadin and the alcohol soluble proteins of barley, rye, oat, maize and rice. As rice contained little alcohol soluble protein, a test against acid soluble rice proteins was included. In all three patient sera, titres higher {{than or equal to}} that for crude gliadin were found for wheat glutenin and for gliadin fractions seven and eight, both containing alpha gliadins. Similar high titres were found when these coeliac sera were tested against rye, barley and oat prolamines. Maize prolamines gave only low titres and no antibodies could be detected against rice proteins, in line with the tolerance of these latter two cereals by patients with coeliac disease. It would appear that sera from coeliac patients react with more than one antigenic fraction of protein in wheat and other cereals. Also sera from two normal persons appeared to have the same spectrum of reactivity against these cereal proteins as did the three sera from coeliac patients. The titres in normal sera were however much lower...|$|E
