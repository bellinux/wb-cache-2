60|$|Mrs. Brice sighed, and furtively wiped <b>her</b> <b>eyes</b> <b>with</b> <b>her</b> handkerchief.|$|E
60|$|Here {{she sank}} upon {{the bench and}} covered <b>her</b> <b>eyes</b> <b>with</b> <b>her</b> hands.|$|E
60|$|Again {{the flame}} fell, and again she covered <b>her</b> <b>eyes</b> <b>with</b> <b>her</b> hands.|$|E
60|$|She laughed softly upon him, laughed more <b>with</b> <b>her</b> <b>eyes</b> than <b>with</b> <b>her</b> lips. She {{watched him}} curiously.|$|R
60|$|MRS. CLANDON (touching <b>her</b> <b>eyes</b> hastily <b>with</b> <b>her</b> {{handkerchief}} and sitting down again). Thank you, my dear. Thanks, Phil.|$|R
60|$|George 'ad got arf {{a mind to}} say {{something}} about a 'bus, but he remembered in time that very likely young Ted hadn't got any more money. Then Gerty said she knew a short cut, and she took them, walking along little, dark, narrow streets and places, until at last, just as George thought they must be pretty near 'ome, she began to dab <b>her</b> <b>eyes</b> <b>with</b> <b>'er</b> pocket-'andkerchief and say she'd lost 'er way.|$|R
60|$|She wiped <b>her</b> <b>eyes</b> <b>with</b> <b>her</b> apron: the two girls, grave before, looked sad now.|$|E
60|$|Tara of Helium gasped {{in horror}} and turning away covered <b>her</b> <b>eyes</b> <b>with</b> <b>her</b> palms.|$|E
60|$|Mrs. Van Brandt {{leaned back}} in her chair, and covered <b>her</b> <b>eyes</b> <b>with</b> <b>her</b> hands.|$|E
60|$|The old {{man must}} ha' {{been living with}} Henery Walker for over {{eighteen}} months when one night he passed away in 'is sleep. Henery knew that his 'art was wrong, because he 'ad just paid Dr. Green 'is bill for saying that 'e couldn't do anything for 'im, {{but it was a}} surprise to 'im all the same. He blew his nose 'ard and Mrs. Walker kept rubbing <b>'er</b> <b>eyes</b> <b>with</b> <b>her</b> apron while they talked in whispers and wondered 'ow much money they 'ad come in for.|$|R
60|$|But Canim, holding <b>her</b> <b>eyes</b> <b>with</b> his, searched <b>her</b> secret {{soul and}} saw it waver.|$|R
60|$|At these {{touching}} words Miss Nugent was undisguisedly affected, {{and wiping}} <b>her</b> bright <b>eyes</b> <b>with</b> <b>her</b> pinafore, gave her small, well-shaped nose a slight touch en passant {{with the same}} useful garment, and squeezed his arm affectionately.|$|R
60|$|She paused awhile, {{covering}} <b>her</b> <b>eyes</b> <b>with</b> <b>her</b> hand; and, looking, I saw great tears {{upon the}} cheek of Charmion.|$|E
60|$|She ceased weeping, wiping <b>her</b> <b>eyes</b> <b>with</b> <b>her</b> chiton, and I {{saw that}} they seemed but the softer for her tears.|$|E
60|$|She covered <b>her</b> <b>eyes</b> <b>with</b> <b>her</b> hands, {{and seemed}} deeply agitated. Sir Kenneth would have approached, but she waved him back.|$|E
6000|$|... "Heaven only knows! Now, Augusta {{is to be}} married. I must {{of course}} have a few hundred pounds. You should have heard how he groaned when I asked him for it. Heaven only knows where the money goes!" [...] And the injured wife wiped a piteous tear from <b>her</b> <b>eye</b> <b>with</b> <b>her</b> fine dress cambric handkerchief. [...] "I have all the sufferings and privations of a poor man's wife, but I have none of the consolations. He has no {{confidence}} in me; he never tells me anything; he never talks to me about his affairs. If he talks to any one it is to that horrid doctor." ...|$|R
60|$|She did not answer, {{but looked}} at me, smiling. <b>Her</b> <b>eyes</b> glistened <b>with</b> tears, <b>her</b> bosom heaved.|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh, I don't see how {{you could}} be so hard!" [...] cried Imogene. She put up {{her hands to her}} face, and broke into tears. Mrs. Bowen watched <b>her,</b> dry <b>eyed,</b> <b>with</b> <b>her</b> lips parted, and an {{intensity}} of question in her face.|$|R
60|$|Lucetta covered <b>her</b> <b>eyes</b> <b>with</b> <b>her</b> right hand, as if {{she could}} plead no more, holding out her left to Elizabeth-Jane.|$|E
6000|$|She covered <b>her</b> <b>eyes</b> <b>with</b> <b>her</b> {{hands and}} pressed hard {{as if to}} make clear her bewildering thoughts. [...] "Oh, I--I can't remember." ...|$|E
60|$|The elderly lady {{thrust out}} her hand and drew forward a lumpish-looking young woman, who sobbed and mopped <b>her</b> <b>eyes</b> <b>with</b> <b>her</b> handkerchief.|$|E
60|$|Truly, {{during that}} evening Bertha was the {{agitated}} one, her speech much affected, and her gestures restless, while Phoebe sat over her work, her needle going swiftly and evenly, and <b>her</b> <b>eyes</b> beaming <b>with</b> <b>her</b> quiet depth of thankful bliss.|$|R
60|$|Mrs. Bowman {{took another}} long, {{shivering}} breath. Still incapable of speech, {{she took the}} slip of paper in her trembling fingers and an involuntary exclamation of dismay broke from Mr. Tucker. She dabbed fiercely at <b>her</b> burning <b>eyes</b> <b>with</b> <b>her</b> handkerchief and read it again.|$|R
6000|$|... "You dear {{and blessed}} Husband-Man," [...] she murmured, a quick {{cloudiness}} of moisture in <b>her</b> <b>eyes,</b> as <b>with</b> <b>her</b> <b>eyes</b> she embraced him, her arms still around Jerry, who, sensing the ecstasy of the moment, kissed <b>her</b> fragrant cheek <b>with</b> his ribbon-tongue of love.|$|R
60|$|Kate {{looked at}} her again, but less {{steadily}} than before; and resting her elbow on the table, covered <b>her</b> <b>eyes</b> <b>with</b> <b>her</b> hand.|$|E
60|$|Mary {{dropped back}} {{on to the}} sofa, and covered <b>her</b> <b>eyes</b> <b>with</b> <b>her</b> hand: then Constance, seeing Fan {{approaching}} her, left the room.|$|E
60|$|She made no reply, but covered <b>her</b> <b>eyes</b> <b>with</b> <b>her</b> {{hand and}} turned to leave the room. He rushed forward and caught her arm.|$|E
60|$|She {{only looked}} at it as it lay on her lap. We had {{observed}} before that when she {{looked at it}} she covered <b>her</b> discoloured <b>eye</b> <b>with</b> <b>her</b> hand, as though she wished to separate any association with noise and violence and ill treatment from the poor little child.|$|R
60|$|Lucy {{felt the}} tears well up to <b>her</b> <b>eyes,</b> but <b>with</b> all <b>her</b> {{strength}} she forced them back. She collected her thoughts.|$|R
60|$|Mrs. Steerforth, fallen back stiffly in her chair, {{and making}} no sound but a moan, cast <b>her</b> <b>eyes</b> upon <b>her</b> <b>with</b> a wide stare.|$|R
60|$|The woman {{sank back}} to a sitting posture on the floor, and, {{covering}} <b>her</b> <b>eyes</b> <b>with</b> <b>her</b> hands, gave way to heart-broken sobs and wailings.|$|E
60|$|She paused, {{covering}} <b>her</b> <b>eyes</b> <b>with</b> <b>her</b> hand, {{and it was}} well, for {{her words}} pierced me so that I shrank upon the seat beside her.|$|E
6000|$|... "Come with me, O Wife of a royal hero," [...] said Tua to Asti, who {{had covered}} <b>her</b> <b>eyes</b> <b>with</b> <b>her</b> hand, and {{was leaning against}} the wall.|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, my dear, I {{think the}} key to her choice is this, that she has judged not <b>with</b> <b>her</b> <b>eyes,</b> but <b>with</b> <b>her</b> ears, or rather <b>with</b> <b>her</b> understanding. Had she {{accepted}} Mr. Orme, I as a father should of course have been well satisfied. He is, I have no doubt, a fine young fellow, and will make a good husband some day." ...|$|R
5000|$|One of {{her most}} famous poems is [...] "Una mujer está sola," [...] which starts with the lines [...] "Una mujer está sola. Sola con su estatura.Con los ojos abiertos. Con los brazos abiertos.Con el corazón abierto como un silencio ancho." [...] ("A woman is alone. Alone <b>with</b> <b>her</b> stature. <b>With</b> <b>her</b> <b>eyes</b> open. <b>With</b> <b>her</b> arms open. <b>With</b> <b>her</b> heart open like a wide silence.") ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Oh yes, you do know, sir!' said Mrs Gamp, '{{and so do}}es Mrs Mould, your 'ansome pardner too, sir; and so do I, {{although}} the blessing of a daughter was deniged me; which, if we had had one, Gamp would certainly have drunk its little shoes right off its feet, as with our precious boy he did, and arterward send the child a errand to sell his wooden leg for any money it would fetch as matches in the rough, and bring it home in liquor; which was truly done beyond his years, for ev'ry individgle penny that child lost at toss or buy for kidney ones; and come home arterwards quite bold, to break the news, and offering to drown himself if sech would be a satisfaction to his parents.--Oh yes, you do know, sir,' said Mrs Gamp, wiping <b>her</b> <b>eye</b> <b>with</b> <b>her</b> shawl, and resuming the thread of her discourse. 'There's something besides births and berryins in the newspapers, an't there, Mr Mould?' ...|$|R
