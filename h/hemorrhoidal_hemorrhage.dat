40|$|AIM: To {{evaluate}} the complications and clinical outcomes of transcatheter arterial embolization (TAE) for symptoms related to severe arterioportal fistulas (APFs). METHODS: Six patients (3 males, 3 females; mean age, 63. 8 years; age range, 60 - 71 years) with chronic liver disease and severe APFs due to percutaneous intrahepatic treatment (n = 5) and portal vein (PV) tumor thrombosis of hepatocellular carcinoma (n = 1) underwent TAE for symptoms related to severe APFs [refractory ascites (n = 4), <b>hemorrhoidal</b> <b>hemorrhage</b> (n = 1), and hepatic encephalopathy (n = 1) ]. Control of symptoms related to APFs and complications were evaluated during the follow-up period (range, 4 - 57 mo). RESULTS: In all patients, celiac angiography revealed immediate retrograde visualization {{of the main}} PV before TAE, indicating severe APF. Selective TAE for the hepatic arteries was performed using metallic coils (MC, n = 4) and both MCs and n-butyl cyanoacrylate (n = 2). Three patients underwent repeated TAEs for residual APFs and ascites. Four patients developed PV thrombosis after TAE. During the follow-up period after TAE, APF obliteration and symptomatic improvement were obtained in all patients. CONCLUSION: Although TAE for severe APFs may sometimes be complicated by PV thrombosis, TAE {{can be an effective}} treatment to improve clinical symptoms related to severe APFs...|$|E
