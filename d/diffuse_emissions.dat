25|$|Saturn is {{the source}} of rather strong low {{frequency}} radio emissions called Saturn kilometric radiation (SKR). The frequency of SKR lies in the range 10–1300kHz (wavelength of a few kilometers) with the maximum around 400kHz. The power of these emissions is strongly modulated by the rotation of the planet and is correlated with changes in the solar wind pressure. For instance, when Saturn was immersed into the giant magnetotail of Jupiter during Voyager 2 flyby in 1981, the SKR power decreased greatly or even ceased completely. The kilometeric radiation is thought to be generated by the Cyclotron Maser Instability of the electrons moving along magnetic field lines related to the auroral regions of Saturn. Thus the SKR is related to the auroras around the poles of the planet. The radiation itself comprises spectrally <b>diffuse</b> <b>emissions</b> as well as narrowband tones with bandwidths as narrow as 200Hz. In the frequency–time plane arc like features are often observed, much like {{in the case of the}} Jovian kilometric radiation. The total power of the SKR is around 1GW.|$|E

Galileo observations have shown changes in the electron pitch angle distributions between the inner and middle magnetosphere of Jupiter (10 to 17 RJ) which could be associated with auroral emissions, without the need of field aligned currents.

CH 4 is produced by anaerobic biodegradation of organic matter in land-filled MSW and it constitutes the major component of landfill gas. Gas recovery is a suitable tool to effectively control CH 4 emissions from landfill sites and the quantification of CH 4 emissions represents a good tool to evaluate the effectiveness of biogas recovering system in reducing biogas emission. In particular, LFG emissions can be indirectly evaluated from mass balance equations between formation, recovery and oxidation of biogas in the landfill, as well as on a direct approach based on LFG emission measurement from landfill surface. However, up to now few direct measurements of landfill CH 4 <b>diffuse</b> <b>emissions</b> have been executed. In the present study, both methodologies have been applied to the case study of Palermo (IT) landfill (Bellolampo). The main aim of the study was to evaluate CH 4 <b>diffuse</b> <b>emissions</b> based on direct measurements carried out with the accumulation chamber method.

40|$|Establishing an {{environmental}} policy for industrial sources usually commences with a {{regulation of the}} large point sources. Attention is then focused on piped emissions, e. g. exhaust gases directed via a stack and wastewater through a discharge pipe. In general these piped missions are well regulated and have been reduced substantially, {{to such an extent}} that the other emissions have become more and more dominating. With respect to atmospheric emissions of volatile organic emissions (VOC) these other emissions comprise mainly leakage from equipment (fugitive emissions) and evaporation losses of storage, loading and unloading. These emissions are called diffuse emissions. Monitoring of <b>diffuse</b> <b>emissions</b> is more complex compared with monitoring of piped emission sources. Abatement and regulation of <b>diffuse</b> <b>emissions</b> is a relatively new issue in some member states of the European Union (EU). It is however not common practice in all EU member states, this contrary to the USA where it is common practice for about 10 - 20 years. The main environmental effect of VOC in general is their role in the formation of smog and ozone in the presence of nitrogen oxides. VOC in the ambient air are precursors to the formation of ground level (tropospheric) ozone, the primary constituent of smog. Smog and ozone cause respiratory damage, damage to property and vegetation (agriculture and ecosystems). Individual components of VOC are known for other negative effects such as toxic effects on health and ozone layer depletion in the stratosphere. Reduction of VOC emissions is not only beneficiary to the environment but also can lead to better workplace conditions, can reduce risks of fire, can reduce nuisance (odours) and can save money. IMPEL, the environmental inspectors network for the EU, has defined a project on <b>diffuse</b> <b>emissions.</b> The intention is to provide guidelines for implementing <b>diffuse</b> <b>emissions</b> regulations, both for licensing of industrial plants and for enforcement.

Most of the {{resulting}} sediment is deposited on the adjacent land where polluting substances contribute to the emissions to the underlying soils.

From the survey on sediment quality {{in the area of}} the Hoogheemraadschap U. S. H. N. in Noord-Holland, regional differences in the quality of the sediment were observed.

The sediment quality is a result of a combination of <b>diffuse</b> <b>emissions.</b> In this study, WABOGIS, the sediment quality was analysed with a geographical information system (GIS) to explain the differences in <b>diffuse</b> <b>emissions.</b> For all the local watercourses, the <b>diffuse</b> <b>emissions</b> from traffic, storm-water overflow or urbanisation are determined using geographical maps. Watercourses not influenced by these emissions are determined as delivering background pollution due to atmospheric deposition and surface runoff from surrounding soil. For background polluted locations with a sandy or clay soil, the sediment class is mostly 0 or 2, while peat soils lead to a class 2 sediment. Where there is an additional load, the greatest effect is seen in sandy soils.

40|$|AbstractPatterns {{of changes}} in the {{concentration}} of total and soluble reactive phosphorus (TP, SRP) and suspended sediments at different flow levels from 1991 to 2013 in the Austrian Danube are statistically analyzed and related to point and <b>diffuse</b> <b>emissions,</b> as well as to extreme hydrological events. Annual loads are calculated with three methods and their development in time is examined taking into consideration total emissions and hydrological conditions. The reduction of point discharges achieved during the 1990 s was well translated into decreasing TP and SRP baseflow concentrations during the same period, but it did not induce any change in the concentrations at higher flow levels nor in the annual transport of TP loads. A sharp and long-lasting decline in TP concentration, affecting all flow levels, took place after a major flood in 2002. It was still visible during another major flood in 2013, which recorded lower TP concentrations than its predecessor. Such decline could not be linked to changes in point or <b>diffuse</b> <b>emissions.</b> This suggests that, {{as a result of the}} flood, the river system experienced a significant depletion of its in-stream phosphorus stock and a reduced mobilization of TP rich sediments afterwards. This hypothesis is corroborated by the decoupling of peak phosphorus loads from peak maximum discharges after 2002. These results are highly relevant for the design of monitoring schemes and for the correct interpretation of water quality data in terms of assessing the performance of environmental management measures...|$|E

40|$|There {{is active}} {{interest}} in {{the extent to which}} unresolved gamma-ray pulsars contribute to the galactic <b>diffuse</b> <b>emission,</b> and whether unresolved gamma-ray pulsars could be responsible for the excess of <b>diffuse</b> galactic <b>emission</b> above 1 GeV which has been observed by EGRET. The diffuse gamma-ray intensity due to unresolved pulsars is directly linked to the number of objects which should be observed in the EGRET data. We can therefore use our knowledge of the unidentified EGRET sources to constrain model parameters like the pulsar birth rate, their beaming angle, etc. This analysis is based only on the properties of the six pulsars which have been identified in the EGRET data, and is independent of choice of a pulsar emission model. We find that pulsars contribute very little to the <b>diffuse</b> <b>emission</b> at lower energies, whereas above 1 GeV they can account for 18 % of the observed intensity in selected regions for a reasonable number of directly observable gamma-ray pulsars (14). The latitude distribution of the <b>diffuse</b> <b>emission</b> caused by unresolved pulsars is narrower than that of the observed <b>diffuse</b> <b>emission.</b> While the excess above 1 GeV gamma-ray energy is observed up to at least 6 - 8 degrees off the plane, the pulsar contribution would be small there.
