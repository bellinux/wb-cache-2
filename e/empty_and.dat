5|$|In February 1917, the German Army began a {{withdrawal}} from its {{positions in the}} Somme sector to the Hindenburg Line. Gellibrand was in temporary command of the 2ndDivision, which at this time was opposite the village of Warlencourt. Patrols from the 6thInfantry Brigade found Warlencourt <b>empty</b> <b>and</b> occupied it unopposed. The 24thInfantry Battalion kept {{in contact with the}} Germans as they pulled back. On 13 March, the 24thInfantry battalion—now responsible for the entire brigade front—found Grévillers <b>empty</b> <b>and</b> occupied it. By 17 March 1917, the trenches in front of Bapaume were <b>empty</b> <b>and</b> the 6thInfantry Brigade occupied its northern suburbs.|$|E

40|$|This study {{investigates the}} effects of Uliveto, a bicarbonate-alkaline mineral water, in {{experimental}} models of diarrhea, constipation and colitis. Rats were allowed to drink Uliveto or oligomineral water (control) for 30 days. Diarrhea and constipation were evoked by 16, 16 -dimethyl-prostaglandin E(2) (dmPGE(2)) or loperamide, respectively. Colitis was induced by 2, 4 -dinitrobenzenesulfonic acid (DNBS) or acetic acid. Gastric <b>emptying,</b> small-intestinal <b>and</b> colonic transit were evaluated. dmPGE(2) -induced diarrhea reduced gastric <b>emptying</b> <b>and</b> increased small-intestinal and colonic transit. In this setting, Uliveto water enhanced gastric <b>emptying,</b> <b>and</b> this effect was prevented by L- 365, 260 (gastrin receptor antagonist). Loperamide-induced constipation reduced gastric <b>emptying,</b> small-intestinal <b>and</b> colonic transit, and these effects were prevented by Uliveto water. L- 365, 260 counteracted {{the effects of}} Uliveto on gastric emptying, while alosetron (serotonin 5 -HT(3) receptor antagonist) blunted the effect of Uliveto on colonic transit. Gastric <b>emptying,</b> small-intestinal <b>and</b> colonic transit were reduced in DNBS-induced colitis, and Uliveto water enhanced gastric <b>emptying</b> <b>and</b> normalized small-intestinal and colonic transit. Gastric <b>emptying,</b> small-intestinal <b>and</b> colonic transit were also reduced in acetic acid-induced colitis, and Uliveto increased both gastric <b>emptying</b> <b>and</b> small-intestinal transit. In conclusion, Uliveto water exerts beneficial effects on gastrointestinal motility {{in the presence of}} bowel motor dysfunctions. The effects of Uliveto water on gastric emptying depend on gastrin-mediated mechanisms, whereas the activation of serotonergic pathways accounts for the modulation of colonic functions...|$|R

5|$|Any {{directed}} graph {{may be made}} into a DAG by removing a feedback vertex set or a feedback arc set, a set of vertices or edges (respectively) that touches all cycles. However, the smallest such set is NP-hard to find. An arbitrary {{directed graph}} may also be transformed into a DAG, called its condensation, by contracting each of its strongly connected components into a single supervertex. When the graph is already acyclic, its smallest feedback vertex sets and feedback arc sets are <b>empty,</b> <b>and</b> its condensation is the graph itself.|$|E

5|$|Cosimo III left a Tuscany one of {{the poorest}} nations in Europe; the {{treasury}} <b>empty</b> <b>and</b> the people weary of religious bigotry, the state itself was reduced to a gaming chip in European affairs. Among his enduring edicts is the establishment of the Chianti wine region. Gian Gastone repealed Cosimo's Jewish persecution laws, and eased tariffs and customs. Cosimo's inability to uphold Tuscany's independence led to the succession of the House of Lorraine upon Gian Gastone's death in 1737.|$|E

40|$|Total gastric {{emptying}} is delayed in 10 % to 33 % {{of adult}} patients with gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD), but {{a strong correlation}} between duration of gastric <b>emptying</b> <b>and</b> severity of acid reflux or esophagitis has never been proved. Previous studies reported that patients with GERD might have exaggerated postprandial fundus relaxation with retention of food and triggering of transient lower esophageal sphincter relaxations (TLESRs). There is a positive correlation between postprandial fundus relaxation and number of TLESRs and also between proximal gastric <b>emptying</b> <b>and</b> esophageal acid exposure. However, new studies suggest that a high number of TLESRs and reflux events may occur even with accelerated gastric <b>emptying,</b> <b>and</b> prolonged gastric retention might be associated with less rather than more esophageal acid exposure. Using simultaneous gastric <b>emptying</b> <b>and</b> esophageal pH impedance we found that the rate of gastric emptying might determine the acidity and proximal extent of reflux: The slower the emptying, the higher the pH and proximal extent of the refluxate. status: publishe...|$|R

5|$|Endecott's warrant was {{followed}} by an order issued by King Charles in March and received by Endecott in May 1661 containing a direct order to apprehend the two fugitives and ship them back to England. Endecott dutifully obeyed, but he appointed two recently arrived Royalists to track them down. Somewhat predictably, their search came up <b>empty,</b> <b>and</b> Whalley and Goffe thus escaped. Biographer Lawrence Mayo suggests Endecott would have appointed different men for the search had he been serious about catching them.|$|E

For a long time chemists searched for eka-tantalum as an element with similar chemical properties to tantalum, making a discovery of protactinium nearly impossible. Tantalum's heavier analogue was later found to be the transuranic element dubnium.|$|E

5|$|Macrinus was proclaimed {{emperor of}} Rome by 11 April 217 {{while in the}} eastern provinces of the empire and was {{subsequently}} confirmed as such by the Senate; however, {{for the duration of}} his reign, he never had the opportunity to return to Rome. His predecessor's policies had left Rome's coffers <b>empty</b> <b>and</b> the empire at war with several kingdoms, including Parthia, Armenia and Dacia. As emperor, Macrinus first attempted to enact reform to bring economic and diplomatic stability to Rome. While Macrinus' diplomatic actions brought about peace with each of the individual kingdoms, the additional monetary costs and subsequent fiscal reforms generated unrest in the Roman military.|$|E

5|$|Substantial combat {{had ended}} {{but the war}} had not, and a formal treaty of peace was months away. The British still had 26,000 troops occupying New York City, Charleston, and Savannah, and had a {{powerful}} fleet. The French army and navy departed, so the Americans were on their own in 1782–83. Money matters fed the anxiety; the treasury was <b>empty,</b> <b>and</b> the unpaid soldiers were growing restive {{almost to the point}} of mutiny. At one point, they forced an adjournment of the Congress from Philadelphia to Princeton. Washington dispelled unrest among officers by suppressing the Newburgh Conspiracy in March 1783, and Congress came up with the promise of a five-year bonus.|$|E
