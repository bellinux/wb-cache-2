This is as predicted by the exponent of Fowler-Nordheim-type equations [...]|$|E
40|$|The {{possibility}} of using scanning force microscopy (SFM) to image monolayer arrays of nanometer diameter gold clusters on flat substrates has been investigated. A major difficulty in SFM studies of supported cluster arrays is the interaction force between the SFM probe and the clusters {{which results in}} the clusters moving on the substrate during imaging. The addition of a carbon nanotube {{to the tip of}} the SFM probe reduces this interaction force, resulting in stable, tapping mode height images of the supported cluster arrays. However, resolution of individual nanometer-size cluster in an array requires reduction of the <b>endform</b> radius of the nanotubes. In an attempt to reduce the effects of image dilation, the <b>endform</b> shape of the nanotube has been modified by spark etching. Also, metal atoms have been deposited onto the tip <b>endform</b> by sparking the tip of the nanotube by sparking the tip against a metal substrate and by electro-depositing metal onto the tip. ^ Molecular dynamics (MD) simulations using embedded-atom-method (EAM) potentials have been used to model the compression behavior of nanometer-size gold clusters. The simulations examined the behavior of free and supported gold particles compressed with normal and shear forces. These results have been used to explain previously observed descrepencies between the calculated and measured elastic modulus of nanometer-size gold clusters. ...|$|E
40|$|Abstract An {{empirical}} method {{has been developed}} for determining the tip shapes from field ion micrographs utilizing digitization and computer graphics techniques. Application of this method to tungsten and iridium specimens indicates that the tip profiles deviate significantly from a hemisphere, and on a fine scale the shape varies from region to region over the specimen surface. However, for practical purposes the entire <b>endform</b> can be represented by a polynomial of degree 4 or 5. ...|$|E
