As a <b>follow-up,</b> the <b>car</b> won the 2009 'WTF' award from Top Gear Magazine, which said that it 'looks like it got bottled in a pub brawl and stitched back together by a blind man'. Jeremy Clarkson described the car as a coupe and a removal van 'nailed together in the most unholy merger since Caligula fell in love with his horse', with 'wheels... the size of Smarties', while Richard Hammond criticised it as 'rather ugly'.|$|R
2500|$|According to witnesses, the {{shooting}} occurred {{shortly after the}} limousine made the sharp left-hand turn from Houston onto Elm Street. Most of the witnesses recalled that the first shot was fired after the president had started waving with his right hand. The onlookers recalled hearing three shots, with {{the second and third}} shots bunched distinctly much closer together than the first and second shots. [...] The Zapruder film shows the President re-emerging in the footage after being temporarily hidden from view by the Stemmons Freeway sign at Zapruder film frame 224 to 225; his mouth has already opened wide in an anguished expression. He has already been impacted by a bullet and his hands clench into fists. He then quickly raises his fists dramatically {{in front of his face}} and throat as he turns leftwards towards his wife. Secret Service Agent Clint Hill testified that he heard one shot, then jumped off the running board of the Secret Service <b>follow-up</b> <b>car</b> directly behind Kennedy (Hill was filmed jumping off his <b>follow-up</b> <b>car</b> at the equivalent of Zapruder frame 308; about a quarter of a second before the president's head exploded at frame 313). Hill then rapidly ran towards the Presidential limo and then another shot hit Kennedy in the head, cracking open the right side of his skull. As the limousine began speeding up, Mrs. Kennedy was heard to scream [...] and she climbed out of the back seat onto the rear of the limo. [...] At the same time, Hill managed to climb aboard and hang onto the suddenly accelerating limo, and Mrs. Kennedy returned to the back seat. Hill then shielded her and the President. Both of the Connallys stated they heard Mrs. Kennedy say, [...] "I have his brains in my hand!" [...] The limo driver and police motorcycles turned on their sirens and raced at high speeds to Parkland Hospital, passing their intended destination of the Dallas Trade Mart along the way, and arriving at about 12:38p.m. (CST).|$|E

40|$|This study {{examines}} {{the effect of}} heavy vehicles (trucks) on entry capacity of roundabouts. The movements of vehicles were observed at 11 roundabouts in Vermont, Ontario and Wisconsin. Gap-acceptance parameters were estimated for cars and trucks separately; consistent with previous studies, {{it was found that}} critical headway and follow-up time were longer for trucks than <b>cars.</b> <b>Follow-up</b> times for truck-involved vehicle-following cases were found to be associated with central island diameter and entry angle. Gap-acceptance parameters for all entering vehicles were adjusted to a volume-weighted average of the gap-acceptance parameters for cars and trucks. Entry capacity was estimated using existing capacity models with the adjusted gap-acceptance parameters, and compared with the observed capacity at three roundabouts. The capacity models with adjusted gap-acceptance parameters estimated capacity more accurately than the models with unadjusted parameters. Microscopic traffic simulation model was also effective in representing truck characteristics and their impact on roundabout operation...|$|R
2500|$|According to the Warren Commission, {{a second}} shot that struck the President was {{recorded}} at Zapruder film frame 313. The Commission made no conclusion {{as to whether}} {{this was the second}} or third bullet fired. The presidential limousine then passed in front of the John Neely Bryan north pergola concrete structure. The two investigative committees concluded that the second shot to hit the president entered the rear of his head (the House Select Committee placed the entry wound four inches higher than the Warren Commission placed it) and passed in fragments through his skull; this created a large, [...] "roughly ovular" [...] hole on the rear, right side. The president's blood and fragments of his scalp, brain, and skull landed on the interior of the car, the inner and outer surfaces of the front glass windshield and raised sun visors, {{as well as on the}} front engine hood and the rear trunk lid. His blood and fragments also landed on the <b>follow-up</b> Secret Service <b>car</b> and its driver's left arm, as well on the motorcycle officers who were riding on both sides of the President just behind his vehicle.|$|R

5000|$|Mortal Error: The Shot That Killed JFK (1992) by Bonar Menninger (...) {{alleges that}} while Oswald did attempt to assassinate JFK and did succeed in {{wounding}} him, the fatal shot was accidentally fired by Secret Service agent George Hickey, who was {{riding in the}} Secret Service <b>follow-up</b> <b>car</b> directly behind the presidential limousine. The theory alleges that after the first two shots were fired the motorcade sped up while Hickey was attempting to respond to Oswald's shots and he lost his balance and accidentally pulled the trigger of his AR-15 and shot JFK. Hickey's testimony says otherwise: [...] "At {{the end of the}} last report (shot) I reached to the bottom of the car and picked up the AR 15 rifle, cocked and loaded it, and turned to the rear." [...] (italics added). George Hickey sued Menninger in April 1995 for what he had written in Mortal Error. The case was dismissed as its statute of limitations had run out. The theory received public attention in 2013 when it was supported by Colin McLaren's book and documentary titled JFK: The Smoking Gun (...) [...]|$|E
50|$|Conducting his own investigation, Donahue {{eventually}} {{decided that}} the bullet that struck Kennedy in the head had in fact been fired by United States Secret Service Special Agent George Warren Hickey Jr. (March 24, 1923 to February 25, 2005) from an AR-15 rifle carried in the car immediately following the President's vehicle. The series of events is as follows: After the first shot which hit the street was fired, Hickey turns completely around and acquires Oswald {{on the sixth floor}} of the school book depository building. His turned head is documented in an AP photograph by James Altgens. Hickey reaches for the AR-15 under the seat, releases the safety and begins to lift the gun. The second shot is fired by Oswald, hitting the president and Texas Governor John Connally. The president's car and the <b>follow-up</b> <b>car</b> containing Hickey suddenly speed up. This is attested to by Secret Service agent Clint Hill. Agent Hickey, who is unstable because he is standing on the cushion of the seat, rather than the floor of the car, begins to fall back due to the acceleration of the vehicle, pulling the trigger of the AR-15. The gun is pointed toward Kennedy at that instant, and the bullet strikes him squarely {{in the back of the}} head.|$|E
40|$|Pediatric {{stem cell}} {{transplantation}} (SCT) is a stressful treatment {{for children with}} relapsed or high-risk malignancies, immune deficiencies and certain blood diseases. Parents of children undergoing SCT can experience ongoing stress related to the SCT period. The aim {{of this article was}} to present a literature review of articles on parental distress and adaptation before, during, and after SCT and to identify risk and protective factors. The review was conducted systematically by using PubMed, Web of Science, PsychInfo, and Picarta databases. Eighteen articles met our inclusion criteria: publishing date between January 1, 1990 and January 1, 2009; studies concerning parents of children undergoing SCT; studies examining the psychological adjustment and/or stress reactions of parents as primary outcomes and studies available in English. Highest levels of parental stress are reported in the period preceding SCT and during the acute phase. Stress levels decrease steadily after discharge in most parents. However, in a subgroup of parents, stress levels still remain elevated post-SCT. Parents most at risk in the longer term display highest levels of stress during the acute phase of the SCT. Psychosocial assessment before SCT, during the acute phase and in the longer term, is necessary to identify parents in need for support and <b>follow-up</b> <b>car...</b>|$|E
