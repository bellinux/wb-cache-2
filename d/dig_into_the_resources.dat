40|$|According to a legend, some creatures {{have a third}} {{eye with}} which they can read the minds of people. Psychological {{theories}} {{can be used as}} the third eye to understand the minds of corporate responsibility (CR) actors better. This paper studies the thoughts, words and deeds of CR actors in their psychological context. The aim is to help the CR actors and others to understand different CR behaviour and to gain new insights into developing CR values, discourses and practices. Earlier research by this author has examined the neurotic and borderline characteristics of companies and pinpointed their origins in psychological defences. Furthermore, her recent study argued that the psychopathic characteristics of many large corporations could be eliminated by applying personal values to corporate values. This research <b>digs</b> deeper <b>into</b> <b>the</b> psychological <b>resources</b> of human mind to show what vast potentials lie there to solve the CR issues. While psychiatric criteria and most Freudian theories close down an individual or organizational personality into a cage or vicious circle, Jungian theories open up the personality and give opportunities to expand it horizontally and vertically. The Jungian prospective quality of the psyche is well illustrated by three levels of unconscious – personal, cultural and collective – which can help the development of CR values, discourses and actions of individuals, organizations, societies and the humankind. Key words: corporate responsibility, Jung, self, shadow, ego function...|$|R
