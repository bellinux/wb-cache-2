25|$|Opponents of {{free trade}} charge that Friedman does not {{consider}} the purchasing power of domestic labor as a key driver in economic output. However, Friedman argues that when low-skill and low-wage jobs are exported to foreign countries, more advanced and higher-skilled <b>jobs</b> <b>will</b> <b>be</b> freed up and made available for those displaced by the outsourcing. He theorizes {{that as long as}} those whose jobs are outsourced continue to further their education and specialize in their field, they will find better-paying and higher-skilled jobs.|$|E

25|$|It {{is claimed}} that the {{redevelopment}} of the station would result in £2.3 billion being invested into the West Midlands region. The redevelopment of New Street is expected to accommodate passenger growth to at least 2046, depending on {{the accuracy of the}} growth predictions. Between 2,200 and 3,200 permanent <b>jobs</b> <b>will</b> <b>be</b> created {{as a result of the}} redevelopment with further jobs being created during the construction work at the station. The new station will be an improved transport destination for tourists and is a key part of the redevelopment of Birmingham by improving the city image.|$|E
25|$|US President Barack Obama {{decided to}} remove Madagascar from the {{beneficiary}} of the AGOA African Growth and Opportunity Act. On 23 December of the year 2009, President Obama also terminated the program for Guinea, Niger and Madagascar because of their undemocratic changes of power. The AGOA program has helped created ten {{of thousands of jobs}} for middle class Malagasy especially in apparel manufacturing factories, it is feared that most of these <b>jobs</b> <b>will</b> <b>be</b> lost in the near future. Considering the important number of business affected by this decision, the economy of the capital city Antananarivo and Antsirabe will be deeply affected fearing further social tension.|$|E

25|$|The basic {{supply and}} demand model implies that by mandating a price floor above the {{equilibrium}} wage, minimum wage laws should cause unemployment. This is because {{a greater number of}} people are willing to work at the higher wage while a smaller number of <b>jobs</b> <b>will</b> <b>be</b> available at the higher wage. Companies can be more selective in those whom they employ thus the least skilled and least experienced will typically be excluded. An imposition or increase of a minimum wage will generally only affect employment in the low-skill labor market, as the equilibrium wage is already at or below the minimum wage, whereas in higher skill labor markets the equilibrium wage is too high for a change in minimum wage to affect employment.|$|E
25|$|The {{main issue}} {{in dealing with}} the fossil fuel {{phase-out}} has been job loss. Companies in the fossil fuel industry have begun to experience the effects of the phasing-out of fossil fuels like coal. For example, Consol Energy, originally a coal-producing company, has begun the transition to becoming a natural gas producer. Not only does this shift affect its current role in the coal industry but it also has led to employment cuts. With the shuttering of coal plants, the National Rural Electric Cooperative Association estimates that over one million <b>jobs</b> <b>will</b> <b>be</b> lost. With the coal industry aging, many coal mines are deteriorating and becoming costly to keep running. As a result, coal plants are no longer a reliable, go-to energy source for the United States.|$|E
25|$|Three more {{residence}} halls will temporarily {{close in}} the Fall of 2017: Center, Responsibility, and Discovery. Previously {{it was announced that}} Respect, Excellence, Schurz and McDavid wouldn’t operate in the Fall unless there was sufficient demand to reopen some of them. Combined, the seven halls are capable of housing about 1,500 students. The closures are estimated to save about $2 million, largely through reduced utility costs. The university says two of the closed halls also could potentially get some use as guest and conference housing. The temporary closures come after freshman enrollment dropped 24 percent for this academic year. The declining enrollment precipitated a budget plan to cut 400 jobs, but most of them are from those resigning or retiring, so less than 100 actual <b>jobs</b> <b>will</b> <b>be</b> eliminated for the 2018 fiscal year.|$|E

25|$|Also {{within the}} scheme are two hotels, {{including}} a £15million Ramada Encore hotel with 151 {{rooms on the}} corner of Icknield Street and Pope Street. The second hotel will contain 100 rooms. Alfred McAlpine and New World Leisure have been appointed by Chord Deeley to develop and operate the hotels in a joint venture. Most of the buildings on the site are derelict and in a poor state of repair and whilst none of them are listed, the Kettleworks, the former Swan kitchenware factory which dates back to 1890, is to be retained. Work began in summer 2008 on the first phase and the entire scheme is expected to be completed in 2012. It is estimated to cost £130million and is hoped that between 1,500-2,500 <b>jobs</b> <b>will</b> <b>be</b> created as a result.|$|E

The consultants, however, are impressed by his frank insights into the office problems, and they decide to promote him. They also confide that Michael and Samir's <b>jobs</b> <b>will</b> <b>be</b> eliminated; Peter relays this news to them, and the trio decide to get even by infecting Initech's accounting system with a computer virus designed to divert fractions of pennies into a bank account. They believe that such transactions are small enough to avoid detection but {{will result in a}} substantial amount of money over time. Peter takes one last item on Michael and Samir's last day at Initech: a frequently malfunctioning printer, which the three take to a field and smash to pieces to vent their frustration.|$|E
25|$|Organised retail {{will need}} workers. Walmart employs 1.4 {{million people in}} United States alone. With United States {{population}} of about 300 million, and India's population of about 1200 million, if Walmart-like retail companies were to expand in India {{as much as their}} presence in the United States, and the staffing level in Indian stores kept at the same level as in the United States stores, Walmart alone would employ 5.6 million Indian citizens. Walmart has a 6.5% market share of the total United States retail. Adjusted for this market share, the expected jobs in future Indian organised retail would total over 85 million. In addition, millions of additional <b>jobs</b> <b>will</b> <b>be</b> created during the building of and the maintenance of retail stores, roads, cold storage centers, software industry, electronic cash registers and other retail supporting organisations. Instead of job losses, retail reforms are likely to be massive boost to Indian job availability.|$|E

500|$|On 11 May 2007, {{proposals}} for a £2billion clean coal power station were announced by energy supplier RWE npower.

[...] The development would see the installation of three 800megawatt coal-fired units, which would generate enough energy to supply around 3.5million homes. [...] These plans have, however, met some opposition; many residents living in the area feel that the land should be redeveloped for other purposes, rather than continue to be used as an industrial site. [...] The MP for Wansbeck, Denis Murphy, stated that, although the project would have benefits for the area, he still had concerns; Ronnie Campbell, the MP for Blyth Valley, claimed he would welcome the development as long as it did not have an adverse effect on the overall regeneration of the area.|$|E

2500|$|The Dazexiang Uprising ( [...] ; JulyDecember 209 BC) was {{the first}} {{uprising}} against Qin rule {{following the death of}} Qin Shi Huang. Chen Sheng and Wu Guang were both army officers who were ordered to lead their bands of commoner soldiers north to participate in the defense of Yuyang (漁陽). However, they were stopped halfway in Anhui province by a severe rainstorm and flooding. The harsh Qin laws stated that anyone late to show up for government <b>jobs</b> <b>will</b> <b>be</b> executed, regardless {{of the nature of the}} delay. Chen and Wu realized that they could never make it on time and decided to organize a band that would rebel against the government, that they would die fighting for their freedom rather than by execution. They became the center of armed uprisings all over China, and in a few months their strength congregated to around ten thousand men, composed mostly of discontent peasants. But on the battlefield, they were no match for the highly professional Qin soldiers and the uprising was in trouble in less than a year.|$|E
