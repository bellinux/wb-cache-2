500|$|In 1999, Millennium Park {{officials}} {{and a group}} of art collectors, curators and architects reviewed the artistic works of 30different artists and asked two for proposals. American artist Jeff Koons submitted a proposal to erect a permanent [...] sculpture of a playground slide; <b>his</b> <b>glass</b> <b>and</b> steel design featured an observation deck [...] above the ground that was accessible via an elevator. The committee chose the second design by internationally acclaimed artist Anish Kapoor. Measuring [...] and weighing , the proposal featured a seamless, stainless steel surface inspired by liquid mercury. This mirror-like surface would reflect the Chicago skyline, but its elliptical shape would distort and twist the reflected image. As visitors walk around the structure, its surface acts like a fun-house mirror as it distorts their reflections.|$|E
