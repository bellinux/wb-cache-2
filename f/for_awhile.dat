500|$|Night School {{wanted the}} story to have scary and supernatural elements, without verging on horror. [...] "We wanted to {{something}} a little bit more [...] Spielberg-ian, and sort of give it a sense of wonder and have it, <b>for</b> <b>awhile,</b> just be actually interacting with these supernatural creatures where it's almost a little bit fun, and hopefully, gives you butterflies in your stomach before it gets pretty crazy," [...] Krankel said. The developers were influenced by other coming-of-age stories like Stand By Me when developing the characters and story; Krankel cited the character of Lindsay Weir from Freaks and Geeks as the biggest outside influence on the character of Alex.|$|E
500|$|... "The Arrival" [...] {{was written}} by co-creator J.J. Abrams and {{executive}} producer Jeff Pinkner. Paul A. Edwards directed the episode, his second of the season. Early in the series, actress Jasika Nicole feared her character {{was going to become}} liked by the audience only to suddenly die. She explained that [...] "When I was reading the script in the episode where Dr. Bishop stabs her in the neck with the sedative … and all [...] says is, 'Dr. Bishop grabs Astrid from behind and jams the needle into her neck.' Then it fades to black. My mouth hung open <b>for</b> <b>awhile</b> and I was like, 'Oh my God, I only made it through six episodes." ...|$|E

[...] Jonathan Toomey of TV Squad applauded the character development in the [...] "Mole Hunt," [...] as it [...] "was fairly impressive." [...] Moreover, though, Toomey praised the dialogue, saying [...] "The {{back and forth between}} Archer and Figgis and Archer and Lana were laugh out loud funny," [...] and noted that he wished he could incorporate the phrase [...] "baby town frolics" [...] from the episode into a conversation. Toomey did, however, say that he felt that the plotting was [...] "a bit of a stretch," [...] and noted that the realization that Krenshaw was actually a Russian spy named Kremenski was [...] "out of nowhere" [...] and [...] "a bit confusing." ...|$|E

500|$|SFScope {{columnist}} Sarah Stegall also lauded Torv's performance, {{noting that}} the actress [...] "captures Nimoy's staccato delivery, her growling voice, even his trick eyebrow. Not since Zachary Quinto played a young Spock in Star Trek {{a couple of years}} ago have I seen anyone so perfectly sound and move like Nimoy." [...] Stegall did express a wish that the characters not try to explain every case (such as the one in the episode) out of a belief that their explanations were often absurd; this observation led Stegall to praise the new character of Lincoln however, as she believed, like Hanson, that the series has [...] "been needing an Everyman in this mix <b>for</b> <b>awhile,</b> someone for whom immortality is not a commonplace." [...] Charlie Jane Anders of io9 was critical of the episode, remarking that [...] "the whole 'soul magnets' thing, which had seemed to be a throwaway comment a few episodes ago, is turning out to be sort of a weak plot device. And the whole bodily-possession storyline is just perhaps one level of wackiness too far for me. I also had the feeling that this might finally be the acting challenge that was beyond Anna Torv's considerable abilities, as her Leonard Nimoy impression quickly started to grate on my nerves." ...|$|E
500|$|After an {{encounter}} with a mysterious colossus, Finn wakes up on an island where the weather drastically fluctuates. After meandering around <b>for</b> <b>awhile,</b> he eventually encounters an old lady named Alva (voiced by Helena Mattsson) who does not speak English. Alva invites Finn to her home and shows her home movies of other humans who have since presumably died. Later, Finn, Alva and her pet bear encounter Jake, who informs the group {{that he does not}} know the whereabouts of either BMO and Susan. Finn and Jake eventually head to a futuristic island where all of society has hooked themselves up to a virtual reality simulator. BMO is revealed to have become the heroic leader of the VR people, and he rules them along with his sidekick Vinny (voiced by Reggie Watts). Jake decides to go and destroy the generator powering the VR after BMO refuses to leave. Feeling bad for BMO, as well as the emaciated humans who emerge from the virtual reality simulator, Finn asks Jake to fix the generator, but BMO fixes it himself. BMO recognizes that if he remains behind, he will lose his friends, and so he, Finn, and Jake take a pod to the next island. [...] It is on this stop that Finn, Jake and BMO find Susan, who begins to recall her long-forgotten past (as well as her adult-level intellect).|$|E

2500|$|Cash {{was last}} arrested in 1967 in Walker County, Georgia, after police found he was {{carrying}} a bag of prescription pills and was in a car accident. Cash attempted to bribe a local deputy, who turned the money down. The singer was jailed for the night in LaFayette, Georgia. Sheriff Ralph Jones released him after giving him a long talk, warning him about the danger of his behavior and wasted potential. Cash credited that experience with helping him turn around and save his life. He later returned to LaFayette to play a benefit concert; it attracted 12,000 people (the city population was less than 9,000 at the time) and raised $75,000 for the high school. Reflecting on his past in a 1997 interview, Cash noted: [...] "I was taking the pills <b>for</b> <b>awhile,</b> and then the pills started taking me." ...|$|E

2500|$|Damage is Jimmy Eat World's first studio {{album to}} be {{released}} on RCA Records.

It's an interesting time. It's our best educated guess on where we feel comfortable being." [...] Guitarist and backing vocalist Tom Linton stated: [...] " [...] we just toured, saved up all of our money and were able to save up enough money to record by ourselves, and then we shopped the record around. That's what we did for Bleed American too. We ended up signing to DreamWorks and eventually got bought out by Interscope and we were on Interscope <b>for</b> <b>awhile</b> [...] The fans basically made Damage for us by showing up to concerts and supporting us."
