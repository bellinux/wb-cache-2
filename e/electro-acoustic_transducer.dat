2500|$|Active sonar {{creates a}} pulse of sound, often called a [...] "ping", and then listens for {{reflections}} (echo) of the pulse. This pulse of sound is generally created electronically using a sonar projector {{consisting of a}} signal generator, power amplifier and electro-acoustic transducer/array. A beamformer is usually employed to concentrate the acoustic power into a beam, which may be swept to cover the required search angles. Generally, the <b>electro-acoustic</b> <b>transducers</b> are of the Tonpilz type and their design may be optimised to achieve maximum efficiency over the widest bandwidth, in order to optimise performance of the overall system.

5000|$|Among {{the vast}} and often rapid {{changes that have}} taken place over the last century of audio recording, it is notable that there is one crucial audio device, invented {{at the start of the}} [...] "Electrical Era", which has survived {{virtually}} unchanged since its introduction in the 1920s: the <b>electro-acoustic</b> <b>transducer,</b> or loudspeaker. The most common form of electro-acoustic speaker is the dynamic loudspeaker - effectively a dynamic microphone in reverse. This device typically consists of a flattened conical acoustic diaphragm (usually made of a stiff paper compound) suspended in a metal ring, at the apex of which a moving-coil magnet is attached. When an audio signal from a recording, a microphone, or an electrified instrument is fed through an amplifier to a loudspeaker, the electrical impulses drive the speaker magnet backward and forward, causing the speaker cone to vibrate, and this movement generates the audio-frequency pressure waves that travel through the air to our ears, which hear them as sound. Although there have been numerous refinements to the technology, and other related technologies have been introduced (e.g. the electrostatic loudspeaker), the basic design and function of the dynamic loudspeaker has not changed substantially in 90 years, and it remains overwhelmingly the most common, sonically accurate and reliable means of converting electronic audio signals back into audible sound.|$|E
5000|$|The {{sinking of}} [...] in 1912 spurred the Canadian {{inventor}} Reginald Fessenden (1866-1932) {{to begin work}} on a long-distance underwater sound transmission and reception system that could detect hazards {{in the path of}} a ship. This led to the invention of the Fessenden oscillator, an <b>electro-acoustic</b> <b>transducer</b> which by 1914 had a proven ability to transmit and receive sound at a distance of 31 miles across Massachusetts Bay and to detect an iceberg ahead of a ship at a range of two miles by bouncing sound off it and detecting the echo, as well as an occasional ability to detect the reflection of sound off the ocean bottom. Further impetus to developing practical applications of underwater acoustics came from World War I, which prompted the Royal Navy, United States Navy, and United States Army Coast Artillery Corps to experiment with sound as a means of detecting submerged submarines. In postwar experiments, the Coast Artillery Corps's Subaqueous Sound Ranging Section conducted experiments in shallow water in Vineyard Sound off Massachusetts in which it detonated explosive charges underwater at the ends of established baselines and measured the amount of time it took for the sound to arrive at hydrophones at the other ends of the baselines in order to establish very accurate measurements of the speed of sound through water. And in 1923, the Submarine Signal Company improved upon its underwater signaling devices by equipping them with radio transmitters that sent signals both to identify the particular device and to indicate to approaching ships that it would generate an acoustic signal at a specific time interval after it sent the radio signal, allowing ships to identify the specific navigational aid they were approaching and {{to take advantage of a}} one-way ranging capability that let their crews determine their direction and distance from the navigational aid.|$|E

40|$|Abstract—Earphones and headphones, {{which are}} compact <b>electro-{{acoustic}}</b> <b>transducers,</b> {{tend to have}} a lot of acoustic absorption materials and porous materials known as dampers, which often have a large number of extremely small holes and narrow slits to inhibit the resonance of the vibrating system, because the air viscosity significantly affects the acoustic characteristics in such acoustic paths. In order to perform simulations using the finite element method (FEM), it is necessary to be aware of material characteristics such as the impedance and propagation constants of sound absorbing materials and porous materials. The transfer function is widely known as a measurement method for an acoustic tube with such physical properties, but literature describing the measurements at the upper limits of the audible range is yet to be found. The acoustic tube, which is a measurement instrument, must be made narrow, and the distance between the two sets of microphones must be shortened in order to take measurements of acoustic characteristics at higher frequencies. When such a tube is made narrow, however, the characteristic impedance has been observed to become lower than the impedance of air. This paper considers the cause of this phenomenon to be the effect of the air viscosity and describes an FEM analysis of an acoustic tube considering air viscosity to compare to the theoretical formula by including the effect of air viscosity in the theoretical formula for an acoustic tube.

40|$|<b>Electro-acoustic</b> <b>transducers</b> {{are central}} {{components}} of multifrequency echosounders used in remote-target identification and acous-tic surveys for fish and zooplankton. Appreciable changes in echosounder system gains {{can result from}} shifts in transducer frequency responses with water temperature. Because it is standard practice to calibrate echosounder systems for fisheries surveys in one environ-ment and apply the resulting gains to interpret data collected over the range of sea temperatures encountered during a survey, the results may be biased. Such biases may be different for estimates derived from each echosounder frequency. In moving to quantify and mitigate these effects, the performances have been measured for ten commonly used survey transducers in water temperatures ranging from 18 C to 188 C, using three techniques. Results show that the transducer impedances all change with temperature, poten-tially changing the signal-to-noise ratio from 5 to. 20 dB. The resonance frequencies and quality factors also change with tempera-ture, ranging from 0. 2 % to 2. 8 % and 2. 5 % to. 130 %, respectively.

40|$|Earphones are {{no longer}} a novelty or {{substandard}} to large sound systems. People use them for music reproduction, on the go and even at home. However, the frequency responses of the earphones nowadays available are as different as the exterior designs of the earpieces. This master thesis aims at identifying the contributing factors, from a psycho-acoustics point of view, to a good sound signature for earphones. It also presents the components necessary to achieve such a sound signature from a design point of view. To do so, this thesis presents an important literature review and highlights an issue not present when sound reproduction is performed with a distant source: the variability of the coupling between the ear and the earphone. In a first part, the psycho-acoustics of listening with earphones is explained because earphones do not provide important cues that listeners would naturally perceive when listening to a distant source. Various perceptual audio descriptors such as loudness, frequency response and other metrics are also presented in order to establish the requirements for earphone design. In a second part, the measurement of earphones and the measurement tools available to these measurement are presented. The concept of electrical impedance, frequency response and distortion measurement are covered. The reliability of these tools as indicators of the variability of the coupling between the ear and the earphone for a given population is compiled from various published studies. In a third part several modelling methods, such as the lumped-elements, control-system block diagrams and two-port networks, are detailed and the models of <b>electro-acoustic</b> <b>transducers</b> and passive components are covered. A simulation is performed on earphones recently developed by the industrial partner of this work with software tools likeMATLAB®, Simulink® and Simscape®. Lastly, this thesis presents areas identified during this research that would benefit from further research, such as the need for a new broad-band measurement apparatus and the need for psycho-acoustic studies on the impact of the coupling between the ear and the earphone. A practical solution to the delicate question of the earphone/ear coupling variability is offered and relies on the automated and individualized adjustment of the earphones frequency response based on the measurement -by the digital audio player- of the electrical impedance of the earphones...|$|R
40|$|Thermo{{acoustic}} engines convert heat into {{acoustic pressure}} waves with no moving parts; this inherently results in high reliability, low maintenance and low manufacturing costs. Significant {{increases in the}} performance of these devices have enabled rivalry with more mature energy conversion methods in both efficiency and power output. This optimal production of acoustic power can be ultimately used to achieve cryogenic temperatures in thermoacoustic refrigerators, or can be interfaced with reciprocating <b>electro-acoustic</b> power <b>transducers</b> to generate electricity. This thesis describes the design, fabrication and testing of a Thermoacoustic Power Converter. The system interfaces a thermoacoustic-Stirling heat engine with a pair of linear alternators to produce 100 watts of electricity from a heat input. It operates with helium at 450 psig internal pressure and a hot side temperature of 1200 F. Through thermoacoustic phenomena, these conditions sustain a powerful pressure wave at a system specific 100 Hz. This pressure wave is used to drive the two opposed linear alternators in equal and opposite directions to produce a single phase AC electrical output at that same system frequency. The opposing motion of the two alternators enables a vibration-balanced system. The engine has created 110 watts of acoustic power and the complete Thermoacoustic Power Converter system has produced 70 watts of AC electricity. Compensating for some heat leaks, the converter reaches 26. 3 % heat to acoustic power efficiency and 16. 8 % heat to electric efficiency when those maximum values are achieved. This conversion of heat to acoustic power is 40 % of the Carnot thermodynamic efficiency limit. M. S.

40|$|The <b>electro-acoustic</b> {{performance}} of <b>transducers</b> {{has a direct}} impact on the {{performance of}} ultrasound inspections. The signal/noise ratio and the resolution (both axial and lateral) are key factors for detecting and/or proportioning the indications being sought. The signal/noise ratio partly depends on the sensitivity and the signal/noise ratio of the transducer itself. The axial resolution depends on the length of the signal and therefore, for a given maximum frequency, on the damping of the transducer. Sensitivity and damping are often considered antagonistic, as damping traditionally reduces resonance and therefore sensitivity. Earlier studies have demonstrated the advantages gained through using piezocomposite technology to improve this compromise. These two parameters also depend on the acoustic adaptation to the coupling medium (water, plexiglass, rexolite, steel, etc.), and according to the design used, performance deteriorates more or less as one moves further from the nominal use. In addition to sensitivity and the signal/noise ratio, other parameters such as the angular acceptance and resistance to abrasion are sometimes to be integrated in the expected performances.

Antennas, designed for measurements in air, consist of transducers vibrating in a flexural mode, which give the best possibility to match acoustic impedances between air and the transducer.

40|$|Advances in {{battlefield}} equipment {{have created}} a demand for portable power systems with greater power density and more flexibility than current battery sources alone can provide. One potential solution lies in portable, high-frequency thermoacoustic engines, which can provide a battery recharge station or direct power supply for soldiers in-field, with the flexibility of operating on any quality heat source such as a butane heater. In this work, a linearly-acting variable-reluctance generator (VRG) is developed {{to act as a}} high-frequency (250 Hz) <b>electro-acoustic</b> <b>transducer</b> and extract electric power from a proposed thermoacoustic engine design. A computational model of the thermoacoustic engine was developed using DeltaEC to determine the feasibility of the concept and the necessary characteristics of the transducer element. The unique requirements of the high-frequency thermoacoustic engine led to the design, optimization, fabrication, and testing of the VRG, which is designed to operate resonantly in the thermoacoustic system and supported by a self-pumping gas bearing system. The VRG is uniquely suited to efficiently convert small amplitude mechanical oscillations (5 mm in this work) into electric power. Linear and nonlinear saturation models of the transducer were developed to optimize the VRG design and predict transducer performance in the thermoacoustic engine. The accuracy of these models was established by comparing simulation results to static experimental data and dynamic experimental data taken at 50 - 60 Hz oscillation frequency, testing one half of the full transducer. Experimental testing resulted in a maximum power output of 5. 74 Watts with an efficiency of 55. 8 %. The results led {{to the conclusion that the}} transducer would function as designed in the thermoacoustic engine. Recommendations for future work and guidelines for future development of the engine, transducer, and bearing system are provided based on the design and results presented in this work. by Philip Clinton Knodel.

40|$|In {{this study}} an aerostatic journal bearing for {{reciprocating}} free pistons {{was designed for}} application with thermoacoustic engines. By {{taking advantage of the}} maxima and minima of the oscillating pressures inside the engine's cavity, the bearing does not rely on external pressurization by a pump, but is internally pressurized. The fluid film lubricated bearing is established by the continuous flow of gas in the clearance gap from a high pressure reservoir that is charged with gas from the engine's cavity to low pressure reservoirs that are drained to the engine's cavity both inside the engine's piston. A numerical model of this bearing is developed based on a laminar first order resistance-capacitance flow network of the flow in the bearing channels and clearance gap. This model was used to make design decisions and allowed to predict the pressures in the clearance gap and reservoirs and the performance of the bearing. In addition to the gas bearing for the radial suspension, a centering mechanism is integrated in the design to ensure an axially centered oscillation of the piston. This mechanism is first studied separately from the gas bearing using a numerical modeling, which was then validated in experiments with a piston in a cylinder resonating between two gas springs in sliding contact without including a gas bearing. For the validation of the gas bearing, an experimental set-up was built based on a multipiece hollow graphite free piston resonating in a closely fitted glass cylinder between two gas springs on a shaker table at 56. 5 Hz. By measuring the axial, radial and circumferential piston displacement and the pressures in the gas springs and the piston's reservoirs the working principle of the bearing is investigated. The measured pressurization of the bearing's reservoirs, the radial centering and the significant reduction in mechanical friction represent a successful proof of concept of the gas bearing. At the operating conditions of a thermoacoustic power converter and with an improved design it is expected that a bearing load capacity of more than 20 N is feasible. Furthermore, a design of a thermoacoustic power converter including the gas bearing, a thermoacoustic engine and an <b>electro-acoustic</b> <b>transducer</b> is presented. by Claudio U. Hail.
