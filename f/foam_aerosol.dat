40|$|The {{objective}} was to investigate, through experimental means, the basic mechanisms influencing ignition overpressure and to determine ways to suppress ignition overpressure. Ignition overpressure was studied using solid rocket motors with geometry scaled at 1 percent of the Shuttle's Solid Rocket Boosters. Both water injection and <b>aerosol</b> <b>foam</b> were examined as a mean of reducing ignition overpressure. The results of the water injection tests indicate that a relatively small amount of water is sufficient to provide significant suppression. Of the flow rates tested, the lower water injection flow rates provided the best reduction of the ignition overpressure wave. Also, the test results show there is an optimum water flow rate range that provides the best suppression, and as this range is exceeded the effectiveness of water to reduce ignition overpressure is decreased. <b>Aerosol</b> <b>foam</b> provided very little reduction of ignition overpressure, but only small volumes of foam were used and further testing is necessary to determine its total effectiveness {{as a means of}} suppression...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: Fixed-dose {{combination}} topical {{therapy with}} corticosteroid and vitamin D analog provides effective treatment and possible long-term management of psoriasis. The anti-inflammatory and immunomodulatory effects of corticosteroids and vitamin D analogs in treating psoriasis are well investigated; their complementary effects {{lead to the}} disruption of the inflammatory feedback loop underlying psoriasis pathogenesis. Recent preclinical data showed that combination therapy {{is more effective than}} monotherapies of the active ingredients in preventing activation of resting pro-inflammatory cells, inducing immunomodulation, reducing inflammatory responses by regulating T cell production, and normalizing keratinocytes. The increased understanding of the mechanism of action of fixed-dose combination therapy from preclinical studies is supported by several clinical studies. As the efficacy of topical therapy is correlated with the skin penetration of the active ingredients, new drug delivery systems have been developed. The fixed-dose combination Cal/BD <b>aerosol</b> <b>foam</b> creates a modified supersaturated formulation when applied to the skin, which is maintained for at least 26 Â h in the laboratory setting. Clinical studies have demonstrated superior efficacy of fixed-dose combination calcipotriol (Cal) 50 Â Âµg/g and betamethasone dipropionate (BD) 0. 5 Â mg/g <b>aerosol</b> <b>foam</b> compared with monotherapies of the active ingredients. Furthermore, Cal/BD <b>aerosol</b> <b>foam</b> has shown significantly improved efficacy compared with more traditional formulations, such as Cal/BD ointment and gel, in other studies. Calcipotriol also mitigates risks associated with betamethasone dipropionate and vice versa, resulting in the favorable safety profile observed with fixed-dose combination treatment. Recent data also suggest that fixed-dose combination treatment could provide long-term management of psoriasis, although further clinical investigations are needed. Overall, these data support the value of fixed-dose combination therapy of corticosteroid and vitamin D analog and highlight the added potential of innovative drug delivery for the treatment of psoriasis.

40|$|Graduation date: 1984 Propionic acid, live Propionibacterium shermanii, and Dimethyl Fumarate (DMF) {{were tested}} for their stimulatory or {{inhibitory}} efects on yeast, bacteria, and molds. The amount of propionic acid required for inhibition of molds was strain specific and {{equal to or}} less than that required for inhibition of the yeasts. Live P. shermanii cultures grown for 96 hours inhibited the growth of yeast and one species of bacteria but were not effective against molds. DMF inhibited all the species against which it was tested and is proposed to be a potent medicinal agent for treatment of vaginal and topical infections. Stability testing of DMF in human plasma, rabbit blood, human vaginal secretions (in normal saline), normal saline, and in water maintained at 85 °C and 45 °C was conducted. Degradation of DMF followed first order kinetics in human plasma and had a half life of about 154 minutes. Degradation of DMF in rabbit blood could be fit to a second order kinetic model and had an approximate half life of 10 minutes. DMF had a half life of about 21 hrs in vaginal secretions whereas only 25 percent DMF degraded in 22 hours in normal saline. In water, ninety-five percent of DMF degraded at 85 °C, whereas 72 percent DMF remained intact at 45 °C {{at the end of}} an eight week period. An attempt was made to study the pharmacokinetics of DMF in rabbits by administering DMF orally and as an intra venous infusion. Detectable amounts of DMF were not found in rabbit blood. Dosage forms containing DMF or propionic acid were pre pared and buffered at pH 4. 5. Suppositories, ointments and <b>foam</b> <b>aerosols</b> were tested against Candida utilis. The sup pository containing DMF inhibited the yeast growth completely. Aerosols also inhibited the growth of yeasts at higher dilutions, but at lower dilutions there was growth observed at the edges of the plates indicating uneven spraying of aerosols.

40|$|Objectives The {{composition}} of thermal degradation products from {{two types of}} polyurethane foams, one based on toluene diisocyanate (TDI) {{and the other on}} diphenylmethane diisocyanate (MDI), was analyzed and their toxic lung effects were compared. Methods Isolated perfused lungs of guinea pig were subjected to thermal decomposition products of polyurethane <b>foams</b> from an <b>aerosol</b> generator with compartments for diluting, mixing, and sampling. Results Thermal degradation of MDI-based polyurethane foams released MDI, phenyl isocyanate, and methyl isocyanate. The emitted particulate fraction was 75 % for MDI, whereas that for TDI from TDI-based polyurethane foam was 3 %. Thermal degradation products from MDI-based foam caused a pronounced dose-dependent decrease in the measured lung function parameters (conductance and compliance). In contrast, the thermal degradation products from TDI-based foam did not cause any decrease in lung function. Conclusions Thermal degradation products generated from MDI-based polyurethane foam were more toxic to the lung than those generated from TDI-based polyurethane foam. This difference was probable due to MDI in the particle phase...|$|R

40|$|Compared to {{the solid}} and gaseous phases, liquids are {{more closely related}} to {{biological}} processes and the life sciences. In fact, it is generally believed that abiogenesis occurred in the liquid environment of the primordial sea which, itself, was formed only when appropriate conditions came to prevail on the young Earth, providing a striking illustration of the marginal character of the liquid state, in contrast with the solid and gaseous phases of the same substances, which exist over much wider ranges of temperature and pressure: the liquid state arises from a delicate balance between packing of molecules and cohesive forces or, more formally, between entropy and energy. The importance of a full quantitative understanding of liquids is only obvious. Following research in simple liquids, a new area of complex liquids emerged for the study of systems which exhibit ow, but whose liquid-like behaviour cannot be explained by the standard one-body picture used in simple liquids, as interatomic forces are significantly different from the hard-sphere type. The term complex liquid can be interchangeably used with complex fluid or soft matter - following P. G. de Gennes. Many examples of complex liquids involve the mixing of different phases, be they fluid or not in their own right, such as solid and liquid (to make up gel or sol), liquid and gas (to make up <b>foam</b> or liquid <b>aerosol),</b> and solid and gas (to make up solid <b>foam</b> or solid <b>aerosol).</b> Under appropriate conditions, these complex liquid examples, known as colloids, will exhibit fluid-like behaviour on the macroscopic scale. Further examples of complex fluids include polymers and liquid crystals. This Thesis focuses on polymers. Specifically, it researches polymers from a theoretical and a computer simulation perspective, in particular their interaction with surfaces {{in such a way that}} they become adsorbed. Setting out with a definition, examples of polymers, and a brief discussion of the practical applications of this work, the General Introduction gives an overview of the theoretical progress in the area of polymer adsorption. This sets the context for a subsequent description of the objectives of this Thesis. The General Introduction closes with an outline of the remainder of the chapters that follow...|$|R

Hair mousse originated in France and was brought to the North American retail market by L'Oreal in the 1980s, the first mousse product coming out under the label [...] "Valence". It is often dispensed in an <b>aerosol</b> <b>foam</b> spray or in cream form. Hair mousse adds volume to hair and often provides both conditioning and hold, without any clumps or build-up. It is a hairstyling product which works by using synthetic resins to coat the hairs, to assist the hair in taking a certain shape. Hair mousse is purple while in the can and turns an off-white color upon coming in contact with the air. One of the lighter-weight hair styling products, hair mousse is applied to wet hair before drying and styling. Hair mousse can be used on naturally curly or permed hair to reduce frizz and define curl.|$|R
40|$|The United States {{and other}} {{countries}} model the emissions of hyrdofluorocarbons (HFCs) and perfluorocarbons (PFCs) used as substitutes for chemicals that deplete the stratospheric ozone layer. This modeling is performed in part to fulfill commitments made under the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC). HFCs and PFCs are two classes of greenhouse gases (GHGs) identified {{in a variety of}} GHG emissions accounting (inventory) schemes as well as within international treaties designed to limit emissions of GHGs. Although {{only a small percentage of}} the total emissions of greenhouse gases, HFCs and PFCs are of concern due to their long atmospheric lifetimes, high global warming potentials, and importance to a wide variety of industries. Furthermore, as the production of ozone-depleting substances (ODSs) is phased out, internationally under the Montreal Protocol and in the U. S. under Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990, emissions of HFCs and PFCs are expected to grow significantly. Emissions of HFCs and PFCs as substitutes to ODSs come from numerous sources, including the following industrial sectors: refrigeration and air-conditioning equipment, solvent cleaning, the manufacturing and use of <b>foam</b> products, <b>aerosol</b> propellants, fire extinguishing, and sterilization. For each sector, a separate methodology is applied to model emissions from a variety of end-use sources. The authors will present the methodology used by the U. S.

The authors will also review the methodologies employed in different industrial sectors and what data is required to accurately estimate emissions. Techniques for correlating results from “bottom-up ” modeling with “top-down” information will be discussed. Finally, the authors will offer suggestions on how the methodology can be applied to determine emissions regionally within the U. S. and for other countries...|$|R
40|$|Synopsis [...] A {{characteristic}} {{deficiency of}} <b>aerosol</b> <b>foams,</b> such as shave creams, is {{the increase in}} foam wetness as the can empties. This change in foam density can be minimized with solubility and other theoretical considerations. A characteristic extrusion profile for a given formulation {{can be made by}} plotting propellant content against per cent product in the can. The per cent of product extruded as a satisfactory foam varies between formulations. To study the problem, a ternary graph showing propellant solubilities in fatty acid-amine com-positions where the water content of the total system is 80 % was prepared. A product with a perfectly uniform foam is realized by formulating a soap solution that is clear with propellant included but where the propellant has a limited solubility in the soap. Propellant may then be added above this amount to form a reserve layer which will maintain a constant propellant percentage dissolved in the solution during extrusion. The graph defines compositions of soap solutions that fulfill these requirements. Proper operation of this concept requires the can not be shaken before use. Propellant solubilities were determined with formulations using the newer synthetic detergents with and without salt added...|$|R

40|$|Objective: This study {{evaluated}} {{a unique}} formulation of lidocaine 4 % in an emollient <b>aerosol</b> <b>foam</b> microemulsion system to facilitate rapid {{delivery of the}} active ingredient and reduce pain associated with cosmetic dermatologic laser treatment. Design: This was a noncontrolled, open-label, paired, comparison study. Setting: Private practice dermatology clinic. Participants: Ten patients undergoing various cosmetic laser treatments, 18 {{years of age or}} older and considered clinically appropriate for study participation. Measurements: Primary endpoints were patient and clinician assessments of procedural pain intensity for the treated and untreated areas. Ratings were recorded on a visual analog scale ranging from “no pain at all” to “the most intense pain imaginable. ” Secondary study endpoints included clinician and patient subjective assessments of the lidocaine 4 % foam. Results: Mean patient and clinician ratings of pain were significantly lower for areas treated with the lidocaine 4 % foam compared with pain ratings for untreated areas. No adverse events were reported. Clinician’s mean ratings for ease of application and overall satisfaction were favorable. Conclusion: The results from this pilot, 10 -patient, open-label study suggest that the lidocaine 4 % foam may be acceptable to both patients and clinicians for the safe and effective reduction of pain associated with cosmetic dermatologic laser procedures. However, a blinded, placebo-controlled study of a larger population is needed to confirm these preliminary results...|$|R

Production and sales records show the expected {{fall in the}} amounts of CFC- 12 used in refrigeration after the Montreal Protocol came into effect {{but this does not}} seem to have been accompanied by significant substitution by HCFC- 22, demand for which appears governed by organic growth. HFC- 134 a (1, 1, 1, 2 -tetrafluoroethane, CH 2 FCF 3) is a relative newcomer that has partially substituted for CFC- 12. After developing a single data set for the global use of each substance in refrigeration, <b>foam</b> blowing and <b>aerosol</b> propulsion, and other promptly emissive uses, annual releases of the compounds were estimated by applying emission functions derived from surveying both the producers of the chemicals and the principal industrial users.

The agreement between observation and calculation is poorer for HCFC- 22, if its atmospheric lifetime is 12 years, but becomes much closer with a lifetime of 10 years.
