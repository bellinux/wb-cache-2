40|$|Corn is a {{superior}} basal grain for fattening lambs in the Corn Belt. What {{is the best}} method of preparing corn {{in order to obtain}} economical results?

40|$|Acreage {{is stable}} at about 1. 5 million acres, {{down from a}} high of 1. 75 million acres in the late 1970 s. Pennsylvania ranks 13 th in acres of corn planted but {{supplies}} about 1 % of the nations grain supply due in part to 1) higher per acre grain yields in the major grain-producing states, 2) the high percentage of Pennsylvania corn acreage harvested as silage, and 3) large acreages in midwestern states. ● About 67 % of the crop is harvested for grain either shelled or as <b>ear</b> <b>corn</b> (greatly reduced acreage harvested as <b>ear</b> <b>corn)</b> stored as dry or high-moisture shelled or ground <b>ear</b> <b>corn.</b> ● About 33 % of the corn crop is regularly grown for silage. This corn is chopped at 60 – 70 % moisture and is stored anaerobically in upright or horizontal silos or sealed in plastic. The ensiled corn serves as a major forage contribution to the Pennsylvania dairy and beef cattle industry. ● Average 2001 yield per acre for Pennsylvania is 98 bushels of shelled corn @ 15. 5 % moisture and 16 tons of 65 % moisture ∗ silage. ● Value of corn for grain and silage in 2001 was $ 408, 170, 200. Production Regions Corn is grown in every county in Pennsylvania; however, grain production intensity is greatest in southeastern and central counties. Several counties in northwestern Pennsylvania also have significant corn acreage. Many of the northern tier counties have high percentages of their corn acreage used for silage. Leading counties by acreage are Lancaster, York, Franklin, Berks, and Chester. These five counties account for nearly one-third of the Pennsylvania corn acreage.
