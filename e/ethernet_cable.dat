5000|$|AudioQuest sells <b>ethernet</b> <b>cables</b> {{that they}} claim are [...] "directional". One {{independent}} blinded ABX {{test of the}} <b>ethernet</b> <b>cables</b> at The Amazing Meeting in 2015 found that the cables do not produce a measurable effect. Independent physical testing of the data transmission quality of AudioQuest's <b>ethernet</b> <b>cables</b> claimed to show they perform no better than class compliant cables costing less than 1/10 the price due to the near-end crosstalk. Although admitted in the article they weren't equipped to test cat 7 cables and instead tested the cable to the lower cat 6a spec. Also shown in one area the AQ cable bested all other cables at the limit of cat 6 testing/ standard speed of 500MHz while unable to show a possible higher cat 7 standard of 600MHz due to lower limit of 500MHz on the cat 6a standard test.

The motor is connected to a nearby <b>Ethernet</b> <b>cable.</b> When a bit of information flows through that <b>Ethernet</b> <b>cable,</b> it causes a twitch of the motor. The more the information flows, the motor runs faster, thus creating the string to dangle or whirl {{depending on how much}} network traffic is. It has aesthetic appeal; it provides a visualization of network traffic but without being obtrusive.|$|E
