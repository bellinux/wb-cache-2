This may well be the most significant medical consequence of human infection by the dog heartworm.|$|E
25|$|In {{spring and}} autumn the islands are quieter and more pleasant, {{although}} the sea can be rough in spring, autumn and winter, and the islands are sometimes {{cut off from}} the outside world when the ferry services are cancelled due to storms and high waves. During winter, with the addition of the biting cold and the strong winds and the resulting ferry cancellations, the islands become almost deserted.

25|$|The Empire of China is an old, crazy, first-rate Man of War, which a {{fortunate}} {{succession of}} able and vigilant officers have contrived to keep afloat for these {{hundred and fifty}} years past, and to overawe their neighbours merely by her bulk and appearance. But whenever an insufficient man <b>happens</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> the command on deck, adieu to the discipline and safety of the ship.

25|$|Within the Revolution Square is the Parque Central (Central Park) which {{contains}} many historical monuments, some dedicated to national heroes and poets. Some of these include a centrally located Art Deco gazebo crowned with a white-washed naked muse, which <b>happens</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> superb acoustics. There {{is also the}} bust of Professor Josefa Toledo de Aguerri, who was an educator, philanthropist, writer, social activist, {{and one of the}} first feminists in the Americas. Also, the tomb of Carlos Fonseca, founder of the FSLN, which is guarded by an eternal flame. Across from the Central Park, on the north side, is the Rubén Darío park and monument, dedicated to Nicaragua's greatest poet and one of the most influential literary figures of the Spanish-speaking world. It is a neo-classical monument which consists of a round pedestal, topped by a balustrade surrounding a fountain containing a gondola filled with singing cherubs, and at the center, a pillar topped with a statue of Darío dressed in a Roman tunic protected by an angel. Constructed of Carrara marble, Darío's monument is one of the greatest in the country. There is also a park dedicated to the Guatemalan writer Miguel Ángel Asturias. Other monuments include the monument of El Guerrillero sin Nombre (The Nameless Guerrilla Soldier) and Monumento à la Paz (Monument for Peace).|$|E
25|$|Season 6 {{begins with}} Chuck and Blair who part ways {{after making a}} pact that they will unite once they both achieve their {{individual}} goals. Chuck goes {{on his way to}} try to regain Bass Industries from his father who stole it from him while Blair tries to find herself and her individuality by taking over her mother’s company at her mother's request. Serena pursues a relationship with someone older and who <b>happens</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> a 17-year-old daughter, Sage who will do anything to try to split them up. Nate focuses on trying to get the Spectator to become successful and dates Sage. Meanwhile, Dan focuses on completing his second book with Georgina’s help. In the end after a surprising turn of events Blair Waldorf (Leighton Meester) and Chuck Bass (Ed Westwick) get married. In the final moments the series speeds forward five years later where Chuck and Blair are revealed to have had a child and Nate Archibald appears successful and is rumored to be running for Mayor of New York. The show ends with the wedding of Serena van der Woodsen and Dan Humphrey. It's a small ceremony, in what looks like Blair and Chuck's home together, where Lily is with Serena and Eric's father, William, and Rufus seems to be happy with another woman (musician Lisa Loeb, who guest-starred in the first season) along with Dorota, Nate, Jack Bass and Georgina (who are now together), Jenny and Eric. A brief shot of The Spectator reveals that Lola Rhodes and Olivia Burke are now starring in a film about Ivy Dickens, based on her best-selling autobiography.|$|E

500|$|Agent Monica Reyes (Annabeth Gish) is {{investigating}} the woman's murder as {{the latest in a}} series of cases that she believes are linked by numerology. [...] She realizes that when she adds the numbers of letters in the victims' names with the numbers in their birthdates, a pattern arises. [...] While explaining the case to Dana Scully (Gillian Anderson), who rejects the idea that numerology is relevant or that the world can be broken down into one simple equation, Scully discovers another possible clue—marks on each of the victim's cheeks that looks like three small circles, likely imprinted by the killer's ring while he beat the victims. [...] On consulting a numerologist, who <b>happens</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> an office in the same building as the killer's apartment, Reyes ties the murders together. However, the killer also finds the numerologist, murdering her as she is on the phone with Reyes.|$|E

500|$|Some of the {{iterations}} included new numberless visual {{themes and}} new game mechanics {{such as a}} monster who ate tiles and a wall that blocked certain movements. Early Threes designs had no inclination towards minimalism: the pair felt that the game needed to appear more complex so as to interest players. Wohlwend sent Vollmer designs including sushi-themed tiles that paired fish and rice, a chess theme that paired chess pieces, themes about animals, broccoli and cheese soup, military insignia, hydrogen atoms, and textile patterns. Their test audiences were confused by the close to two dozen themes tested in total. Vollmer commented that these ideas made the game feel [...] "unwieldy and unnatural" [...] and that he always preferred the game when the changes were reverted. They received a [...] "wake-up call" [...] from fellow game designer Zach Gage, who encouraged them to return from their foray into complexity. The final game returned to its original theme of numbers. Speaking in retrospect, Wohlwend said the game [...] "always wanted to be simple". He noted that players [...] "think math" [...] upon seeing the game's numbers, though the game is more about [...] "spatial relationships" [...] and just <b>happens</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> a [...] "number theme".|$|E
500|$|Wohlwend, Vollmer, and Hinson of Puzzlejuice collaborated {{again on}} Threes!, a game where the player slides {{numbered}} tiles on a four-by-four grid to combine addends and multiples of three. Its development began before Ridiculous Fishing March 2013 release. Vollmer presented an idea {{similar to the}} final product in its simplicity: pair tiles as multiples of three. The first prototype was written in a single night. Vollmer and Wohlwend spent {{at least half a}} year of the game's 14-month development iterating on this main idea. Early Threes designs had no inclination towards minimalism: the pair felt that the game needed to appear more complex so as to interest players.

Second, he argued {{that even if he}} knew about Cramer's theory, it makes no difference, because Cramer's theory is too vague and scientifically not valuable.
