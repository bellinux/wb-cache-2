40|$|There is wide {{recognition}} of the paradigmatic changes needed to move toward water sensitive cities, and water management discourse often views institutions as barriers to such a shift. Institutions are social constructs which guide and tie societal activities, providing building blocks for collective action. This broader definition of institutions provides opportunities to address the multiple facets of water management, by understanding the institutional settings and dynamics that underpin adaptive governance. This paper seeks to identify such arrangements by exploring the institutional setting behind the rise of stormwater harvesting in Adelaide. This innovative practice change enabled an empirical exploration of the institutional dynamics that underpinned this change. Data from practitioner experiences, gathered through interviews and focus groups, was used to identify the formal and informal 2 ̆ 7 rules-in-use 2 ̆ 7 of the institutional setting. Preliminary results reveal that flexible rules at an operational level enabled practice innovation, while a 2 ̆ 7 collective-choice 2 ̆ 7 level of <b>institutional</b> <b>activity</b> cemented innovation into mainstream practices by changing rules-in-use. Actors interpreting and enacting the rules-in-use within and between these two levels of <b>institutional</b> <b>activity</b> created the interplay that lead to rule change. Understanding these institutional dynamics provides ingredients for building adaptive governance arrangements and to develop pathways to water sensitive cities...|$|E

40|$|The {{aim is to}} {{illuminate}} aspects of dental hygienists' work in multiethnic/multicultural societies, with focus on the intersection between the <b>institutional</b> <b>activity</b> and migration, ethnic diversity and culture issues. Hence, a tension between equality and diversity are discussed. The thesis has two analytical approaches, practice and discourse. The focus is on talk-in-interaction with patients (practice) and how the dental hygienist conceptualise their work when treating people with migrant background (discourse). The theoretical and methodological considerations are drawn from the sociological tradition of "Verstehen", Foucault and discourse analysis. The empirical material is based on documented observations (VCR) and interviews with dental hygienists and patients. The analysis of practice suggests that the interaction is organised by the <b>institutional</b> <b>activity</b> type. A patient’s readiness to position oneself as a "knowing subject", opposed to ethnicity, is crucial to how the interaction is structured. Migration related categories and phenomenon {{are related to the}} institutional task and understood as situated including practices. In discourse, ethnicity intersects with gender and class. The patient's power resources are of vital importance in a discourse on "immigrant patients". The hygienists relates to culture, in terms of relationship with dental care. References in exclusionary discourses were also found. Based on multilayered findings and theories of multiculturalisms, the concept of culture is discussed in connection to agency, ethics of care and equal treatment...|$|E

40|$|Many {{questions}} about institutional trading {{can only be}} answered if one can track high-frequency changes in institutional ownership.

We infer daily institutional trading behavior from the "tape", the Transactions and Quotes database of the New York Stock Exchange, using both a naive approach and a sophisticated method that best matches quarterly 13 -F data. Increases in our measures of institu- tional flows negatively predict returns, particularly when institutions are selling. We interpret this as evidence that 13 -F institutions compensate more patient investors for the service of providing liquidity. We also find that both very large and very small trades signal <b>institutional</b> <b>activity,</b> while medium size trades signal activity {{by the rest of}} the market. ...|$|E

Defence date: 7 October 2013 This thesis {{analyses}} {{the issue}} of institutional arbitral liability from an interdisciplinary perspective, incorporating the legal, social, and economic dimensions of institutional functions. The {{point of departure for}} the main analysis is the assumption that the current institutional exclusion of liability clauses do not respond well to the multifaceted objectives underlying the performance of institutional arbitration actors (both arbitral institutions and institutional arbitrators). In view of this, the thesis identifies the optimal scope of institutional arbitral liability. It is hypothesised that the legal approach to institutional arbitral liability (focusing on the explanation of the contractual bonds and <b>institutional</b> <b>activity</b> through the lenses of various contract law theories) alone is insufficient to accommodate all aspects of institutional performance. It is argued that the contractual obligations of institutional arbitration actors should be analysed in view of the social and economic goals of institutional regimes. Social goals refer to the questions of authority and legitimacy of institutional arbitration (whether in its internal or external aspects), while economic aims refer to the traditional commercial function that arbitral institutions assume in the so-called "market" for arbitration services. Therefore, the thesis suggests that institutional arbitral liability should be based on the three pillars of institutional functions, namely: the legal, social and economic aspects of institutional regimes. The thesis also identifies the emerging public function of institutional arbitration vis-à-vis its traditional commercial function that for long tried to reduce <b>institutional</b> <b>activity</b> to a pure provision of arbitration services. The public function implies the growing private regulatory powers of arbitral institutions in and outside arbitration processes, as well as the increasingly exclusive institutional prerogatives in the administration of publicly oriented arbitrations. The public function supports the proposals for institutional arbitral liability provided in this thesis, as it requires certain public oversight of the fairness and accountability of the contemporary institutional arbitration processes...|$|E
