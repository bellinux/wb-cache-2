5|$|Julia Dykins (Baird) married Allen Baird in 1968 {{and moved}} to Belfast. They had three {{children}} together but were divorced in 1981. Baird worked as a special needs teacher, and after Lennon's death she wrote John Lennon, My Brother (with Geoffrey Giuliano) and gave up working in 2004 to write <b>Imagine</b> <b>This</b> – Growing up with my brother John Lennon. She is now a director of Cavern City Tours in Liverpool.|$|E
25|$|Since it {{is assumed}} that {{some or all of the}} gravific {{particles}} converging on an object are either absorbed or slowed by the object, it follows that the intensity of the flux of gravific particles emanating from the direction of a massive object is less than the flux converging on the object. We can <b>imagine</b> <b>this</b> imbalance of momentum flow - and therefore of the force exerted on any other body in the vicinity - distributed over a spherical surface centered on the object (P4). The imbalance of momentum flow over an entire spherical surface enclosing the object is independent of the size of the enclosing sphere, whereas the surface area of the sphere increases in proportion to the square of the radius. Therefore, the momentum imbalance per unit area decreases inversely as the square of the distance.|$|E

500|$|Ben Norman of About.com wrote, [...] "Nothing against 'Dancehall Queen,' {{but it just}} isn't the Robyn {{people have}} come to love." [...] Robbie Daw of Idolator called it [...] "subtle", and wrote that [...] "it’s hard to <b>imagine</b> <b>this</b> song being worked as a single", but {{concluded}} saying that it [...] "definitely has an infectious hook". Anthony Balderrama of Consequence of Sound wrote that the song [...] "is what you’d expect to hear: a smooth beat and an international sound, but nothing you’ll keep on repeat. It seems like a match made in heaven, but ultimately it’s fairly safe." [...] Matthew Horton of BBC Music called the song [...] "superfluous".|$|E
500|$|Universal Pictures {{announced}} the film on June 29, 1998, with Spielberg {{acting as a}} producer. Michael Crichton was reportedly going to collaborate with Spielberg to create a storyline and write a script. The film was set for release in summer 2000. Spielberg initially devised a story idea that involved Dr. Alan Grant, who was discovered to have been living on one of InGen's islands. According to Johnston, [...] "He'd snuck in, after not being allowed in to research the dinosaurs, and {{was living in a}} tree like Robinson Crusoe. But I couldn't <b>imagine</b> <b>this</b> guy wanting to get back on any island that had dinosaurs in it after the first movie." ...|$|E
500|$|Brian Lowry of Variety {{called the}} first two episodes [...] "competent but uninspiring", and said it [...] "suffers by {{comparison}} with any number of similarly themed dramas, most recently BBC America's fun-loving Torchwood". Lowry also believes that [...] "it's hard to <b>imagine</b> <b>this</b> series doing much more than satisfying some of the odd humanoids still pining for (and emailing on behalf of) Stargate". Mike Hale of The New York Times felt that Sanctuary [...] "sits {{at about the same}} level of writing and performance as the Stargate shows, which means it doesn't have the narrative force of Battlestar Galactica or the wit and creativity of Sci Fi's best original series, Eureka", adding that [...] "it's not an embarrassment for the channel, but it doesn't raise the stakes either". Hale also noted that there is a connection with Stargate, which is [...] "in its 12th year and still going strong".|$|E

500|$|The duet of [...] "I Gotta Be Me" [...] by Finn and Mike was {{considered}} to be [...] "shockingly adorable" [...] by Berk, who gave it four stars out of five. Slezak was less impressed: [...] "The jazz band arrangement and the Mike-teaches-Finn-some-moves choreography was cute, I guess, but it's not a good sign that I spent half the number focusing on Mike's matching green t-shirt and shoe laces." [...] He went on to question the song's inclusion—"In an episode about confronting one's greatest teenage insecurities, I wonder if {{there might have been a}} better choice for a solo than the popular football player with the cheerleader girlfriend lamenting his inability to dance"—and ultimately gave the performance a [...] "B−". Futterman also commented on the song's selection, though from a slightly different angle: [...] "In theory it's charming—and there are definitely moments of the 'I can dance/You can't dance' exchange that were enjoyable—but we couldn't ever <b>imagine</b> <b>this</b> song as something Finn would have voluntarily picked." ...|$|E
500|$|With the {{creation}} of the tools needed for building {{out the rest of the}} game by December 1989, Chahi began working on the introductory sequence as a means to validate the full capacities of his engine. The introduction sequence also gave Chahi the chance to explore the types of cinematics he could create through the engine. Chahi later considered this the [...] "first step in the improvisation process" [...] that he used throughout the rest of development. He finished the game's introduction sequence in early 1990 and started working on the first level. Chahi worked at the game at a linear pace, developing each section of the game in chronological order and influenced by his own personal feelings and attitude at the time. For example, as Chahi recognized he was trying to create a game on his own, the first portions of the game evoke loneliness and isolation, reflecting Chahi's mood at the time. He did not have the original intention of the character meeting an ally, but again described the improvisation approach led him to include the alien friend, and had included specific cinematics that showed a close up of the alien to help the player <b>imagine</b> <b>this</b> world.|$|E
500|$|The {{official}} The Office website {{included three}} cut scenes from [...] "Golden Ticket". One 72-second clip includes Michael eavesdropping from the men's bathroom on Angela, Oscar, Kelly and Meredith, who discuss how unfair Michael is treating Dwight in making him take the fall over the failed golden ticket promotion. Kelly {{also makes the}} remark, [...] "I hope Dwight gets fired and they get a hot new guy to replace him," [...] to which Oscar replies, [...] "Seriously." [...] In another 52-second scene, Michael asks Dwight {{to go on a}} stroll, but Dwight suggests turning it into a [...] "power stroll", which he prepares Michael for by applying sunscreen to his face. And in a follow-up to the scene where workers discuss that Michael should be fired, a visibly angry and upset Michael confronts the office. When he says [...] "Can any of you <b>imagine</b> <b>this</b> office without me?" [...] everyone gleefully raises their hands, but Michael then asks them if they've thought about what kind of terrible person they could get to replace him; he then pointedly says that they could get someone who knows they don't actually need three accountants (Oscar, Kevin, and Angela look visibly ashamed that Michael knew this going back to Season 2's Halloween episode but has never taken any action about it) or someone who doesn't approve of romantic relationships and would transfer one or both people having one to separate branches (Jim and Pam in turn get this message and look thoughtful), and tells the office that they should mind what they're saying about him [...] "when I'm hiding in the bathroom pretending to be pooping." ...|$|E

2500|$|The {{inverted}} spectrum thought experiment, {{originally developed}} by John Locke, {{invites us to}} imagine that we wake {{up one morning and}} find that for some unknown reason all the colors in the world have been inverted. Furthermore, we discover that no physical changes have occurred in our brains or bodies that would explain this phenomenon. Supporters of the existence of qualia argue that since we can <b>imagine</b> <b>this</b> happening without contradiction, it follows that we are imagining a change in a property that determines the way things look to us, but that has no physical basis.

[...] This was a selling point for many who had no job, no food and no roof over their heads. To make a stand and try to reclaim what is theirs through political and socially fuelled theatre presentations. Crawford was a homeless bagman, interested in theatre and experience at writing and producing plays through his work for the Roving Reds (AKA The Proletarian Players). It was only natural that Crawford should find his home with in the New Theatre society.|$|E
2500|$|The {{natural way}} to label [...] {{in this example}} is to set [...] on the first sheet, with [...] on the second. The {{imaginary}} axes on the two sheets point in opposite directions so that the counterclockwise sense of positive rotation is preserved as a closed contour moves from one sheet to the other (remember, the second sheet is upside down). <b>Imagine</b> <b>this</b> surface embedded in a three-dimensional space, with both sheets parallel to the xy-plane. Then {{there appears to be}} a vertical hole in the surface, where the two cuts are joined together. What if the cut is made from [...] down the real axis to the point at infinity, and from , up the real axis until the cut meets itself? Again a Riemann surface can be constructed, but this time the [...] "hole" [...] is horizontal. Topologically speaking, both versions of this Riemann surface are equivalent– they are orientable two-dimensional surfaces of genus one.|$|E
