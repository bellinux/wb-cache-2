5|$|For Steiner, all of offers, {{threats and}} throffers affect the {{practical}} deliberations of their recipient {{in the same}} way. What is significant for {{the subject of the}} intervention is not {{the extent to which the}} consequences of compliance or noncompliance <b>differ</b> <b>in</b> desirability from the norm, but the extent to which they <b>differ</b> <b>in</b> desirability from each other. Thus, an offer does not necessarily exert less influence on its recipient than a threat. The strength of the force exerted by an intervention depends upon the difference in desirability between compliance and noncompliance alone, regardless of the manner of the intervention.|$|E

40|$|In two {{experiments}} {{an imprinting}} procedure {{was used to}} familiarize chicks with two stimuli, A and B, that subsequently served as the discriminanda in a simultaneous discrimination. On {{the first day of}} each experiment, subjects either received presentations of A and B that were intermixed within a session (mixed exposure) or presentations of A in one session and of B in another (separate exposure). For half of the subjects in each of the exposure conditions, A and B <b>differed</b> <b>in</b> both colour and form; for the remainder A and B <b>differed</b> <b>in</b> form alone. On {{the second day of the}} experiments, the chicks were placed into a cool test apparatus and given training in which approaching A was rewarded by the delivery of a stream of warm air, but approaching B was not. Acquisition of this discrimination was more rapid when A and B <b>differed</b> <b>in</b> two respects than when they <b>differed</b> <b>in</b> form alone. When A and B <b>differed</b> <b>in</b> both colour and form, the heat-reinforced discrimination was acquired more rapidly after separate exposure than after mixed exposure; but when A and B <b>differed</b> <b>in</b> form alone, discrimination learning was more rapid following mixed exposure than separate exposure. The latter finding, that the opportunity to compare stimuli <b>differing</b> <b>in</b> only one dimension facilitates subsequent discrimination learning, is consistent with earlier suggestions (Gibson, 1969) regarding the conditions that promote perceptual learning...|$|R

5|$|The legal {{elements}} and {{features of the}} major federal public corruption offenses differ. The various jurisdictional elements of the offenses require that the prosecution prove, alternatively: that the payee was a federal official; that the payee organization received $10,000 in federal funds; that the corrupt communications involved {{the use of the}} mail or interstate wires; that the corruption affected interstate commerce or interstate travel. The mens rea elements <b>differ</b> <b>in</b> whether they require a quid pro quo; a mere nexus is an easier element to prove; more difficult elements to prove include the intent to be influenced and inducement. The offenses also <b>differ</b> <b>in</b> whether the act to be procured from the public official must be an official, a violation of an official duty, a fraud on the United States, or an official transaction. The offenses also <b>differ</b> <b>in</b> whether the payor may be prosecuted in addition to the public official. Finally, the offenses <b>differ</b> <b>in</b> whether they are predicates for Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act and money laundering prosecutions, and in the maximum authorized prison sentence that may be imposed upon conviction.|$|E
