Its construction began in 1845, under the supervision of José do Canto and his London architect David Mocatta, and comprises 6 hectares and more the 6000 species of trees and bush species, representing a cross-section of period gardens created by many of the Azorean families after the 18th Century. It shares a contiguous border with the gardens of the Palace of Santana, the residence of the President of the Government of the Azores, and within its walls there are many constructions, including the monument to José do Canto, a manor home (in the 18th Century-style), an old Victorian-esque greenhouse adapted as a pavilion, and the aforementioned Chapel of Santana (constructed in the 17th Century).

2500|$|The land {{used for}} the airport had been a bullock paddock. Nigel Love, a former wartime pilot, was looking into the {{possibilities}} for aviation in Australia. He was interested in establishing the nation's first aircraft manufacturing company. This idea required him to establish a factory and an aerodrome close to the city. His search for a potential site eventually {{led him to a}} real estate office in Sydney which was aware of some land owned by the Kensington Race Club (that was kept as a hedge against losing its government-owned site at Randwick). It had been used by a local abattoir, which was closing down, to graze sheep and cattle. [...] This land appealed to Love, the surface was perfectly flat and was covered with a pasture of buffalo grass. This grass had been grazed so evenly by the sheep and cattle running on it that it required little to make it serviceable to land aircraft. [...] In addition, the approaches on all four sides had no obstructions, it was bounded by a racecourse, <b>gardens,</b> a river <b>and</b> <b>Botany</b> Bay.|$|R
