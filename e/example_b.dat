For <b>example,</b> <b>B.</b> burgdorferi sensu lato was previously thought to be hindered {{in its ability to}} be maintained in an enzootic cycle in California, because it was assumed the large lizard population would dilute the prevalence of B. burgdorferi in local tick populations; this has since been brought into question, as some evidence has suggested lizards can become infected.|$|E
500|$|An {{important}} GR innovation, later {{adopted by}} Pinyin, {{was to use}} contrasting unvoiced/voiced pairs of consonants from Latin to represent aspirated and unaspirated sounds in Chinese. For <b>example</b> <b>b</b> and p represent [...] and [...] (p and p‘ in Wade). [...] Another distinctive feature of GR {{is the use of}} j, ch, and sh to represent two different series of sounds. When followed by i these letters correspond to the alveolo-palatal sounds [...] (Pinyin j, q, and x); otherwise they correspond to the retroflex sounds (Pinyin zh, ch, and sh). Readers used to Pinyin need to pay particular attention to these spellings: for example, GR ju, jiu, and jiou correspond to Pinyin zhu, ju, and jiu respectively.|$|E

2500|$|GR {{introduced}} several {{innovations in}} Chinese romanization. One of these, later adopted by Pinyin, {{was to use}} contrasting unvoiced/voiced pairs of consonants to represent aspirated and unaspirated sounds in Chinese. [...] For <b>example</b> <b>b</b> and p represent IPA [...] and [...] (p and [...] p' [...] in Wade-Giles). [...] Another feature of GR surviving in Pinyin was to write words (usually of two syllables) as units: e.g. Gwoyeu rather than the Wade-Giles Kuo2-yü3.|$|E
2500|$|The {{spelling}} of Gwoyeu Romatzyh (GR) can {{be divided}} into its treatment of initials, finals and tones. [...] GR uses contrasting unvoiced/voiced pairs of consonants to represent aspirated and unaspirated initials in Chinese: for <b>example</b> <b>b</b> and p represent IPA [...] and [...] [...] The letters j, ch and sh represent two different series of initials: the alveolo-palatal and the retroflex sounds. [...] Although these spellings create no ambiguity in practice, readers more familiar with Pinyin should pay particular attention to them: GR ju, for example, corresponds to Pinyin zhu, not ju (which is spelled jiu in GR).|$|E
60|$|It is of {{importance}} to remark, that the peculiar modification of the Method of Agreement, which, as partaking in some degree {{of the nature of}} the Method of Difference, I have called the Joint Method of Agreement and Difference, is not affected by the characteristic imperfection now pointed out. For, in the joint method, it is supposed not only that the instances in which a is, agree only in containing A, but also that the instances in which a is not, agree only in not containing A. Now, if this be so, A must be not only the cause of a, but the only possible cause: for if there were another, as for <b>example</b> <b>B,</b> then in the instances in which a is not, B must have been absent as well as A, and it would not be true that these instances agree only in not containing A. This, therefore, constitutes an immense advantage of the joint method over the simple Method of Agreement. It may seem, indeed, that the advantage does not belong so much to the joint method, as to one of its two premises (if they may be so called), the negative premise. The Method of Agreement, when applied to negative instances, or those in which a phenomenon does not take place, is certainly free from the characteristic imperfection which affects it in the affirmative case. The negative premise, it might therefore be supposed, could be worked as a simple case of the Method of Agreement, without requiring an affirmative premise to be joined with it. But though this is true in principle, it is generally altogether impossible to work the Method of Agreement by negative instances without positive ones; it is so much more difficult to exhaust the field of negation than that of affirmation. For instance, let the question be what is the cause of the transparency of bodies; with what prospect of success could we set ourselves to inquire directly in what the multifarious substances which are not transparent agree? But we might hope much sooner to seize some point of resemblance among the comparatively few and definite species of objects which are transparent; and this being attained, we should quite naturally be put upon examining whether the absence of this one circumstance be not precisely the point in which all opaque substances will be found to resemble.|$|E

5000|$|If b is {{a perfect}} power (can be written as mn, with m, n integers, n > 1) differs from 1, then there is at most one repunit in base b. If n is a prime power (can be written as pr, with p prime, r integer, p, r >0), then all repunit in base b are not prime aside from Rp and R2. Rp can be either prime or composite, the former examples, b = −216, −128, 4, 8, 16, 27, 36, 100, 128, 256, etc., the latter examples, b = −243, −125, −64, −32, −27, −8, 9, 25, 32, 49, 81, 121, 125, 144, 169, 196, 216, 225, 243, 289, etc., and R2 can be prime (when p differs from 2) only if b is negative, a power of −2, for <b>example,</b> <b>b</b> = −8, −32, −128, −8192, etc., in fact, the R2 can also be composite, for <b>example,</b> <b>b</b> = −512, −2048, −32768, etc. If n is not a prime power, then no base b repunit prime exists, for <b>example,</b> <b>b</b> = 64, 729 (with n = 6), b = 1024 (with n = 10), and b = −1 or 0 (with n any natural number).
