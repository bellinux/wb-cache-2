In the perspective of developing a biotechnological process for the degradation of low-molecular weight (MW) aromatic compounds occurring in the effluents of anaerobic <b>digestors</b> treating OMWs, the capability of this bacterial co-culture of biodegrading a synthetic mix of the above mentioned compounds and the aromatic compounds of an anaerobic OMW-treatment plant effluent in the physiological state of immobilised cells was investigated. Two aerobic fixed-bed biofilm reactors were developed by immobilising the co-culture cells on Manville silica beads and on polyurethane foam cubes. Both supports were found to give rise to a microbiologically stable and biologically active biofilm. The two biofilm reactors were found to be similarly capable of rapidly and completely biodegrading the components of a synthetic mix of nine monocyclic aromatic acids typically present in OMWs and the low-MW aromatic compounds occurring in the anaerobic effluent in batch conditions. However, in the same conditions, the silica bead-packed reactor was found to be more effective in the removal of high-MW phenolic compounds from the anaerobic effluent with respect to the polyurethane cube-packed reactor.

40|$|The {{short-term}} {{effects of}} temperature on methanogenesis from acetate or CO 2 in a thermophilic (58 °C) anaerobic <b>digestor</b> were studied by incubating <b>digestor</b> sludge at different temperatures with 14 C-labeled methane precursors (14 CH 3 COO− or 14 CO 2). During {{a period when}} Methanosarcina sp. was numerous in the sludge, methanogenesis from acetate was optimal at 55 to 60 °C and was completely inhibited at 65 °C. A Methanosarcina culture isolated from the <b>digestor</b> grew optimally on acetate at 55 to 58 °C and did not grow or produce methane at 65 °C. An accidental shift of <b>digestor</b> temperature from 58 to 64 °C during this period caused a sharp decrease in gas production and a large increase in acetate concentration within 24 h, indicating that the aceticlastic methanogens in the <b>digestor</b> were the population most susceptible to this temperature increase. During a later period when Methanothrix sp. was numerous in the <b>digestor,</b> methanogenesis from 14 CH 3 COO− was optimal at 65 °C and completely inhibited at 75 °C. A partially purified Methanothrix enrichment culture derived from the <b>digestor</b> had a maximum growth temperature near 70 °C. Methanogenesis from 14 CO 2 in the sludge was optimal at 65 °C and still proceeded at 75 °C. A CO 2 -reducing Methanobacterium sp. isolated from the <b>digestor</b> was capable of methanogenesis at 75 °C. During the period when Methanothix sp. was apparently dominant, sludge incubated for 24 h at 65 °C produced more methane than sludge incubated at 60 °C, and no acetate accumulated at 65 °C.

In the thermophilic <b>digestor,</b> acetate turnover increased from a prefeeding level of 16 μM/min to a peak (49 μM/min) 1 h after feeding and then gradually decreased. Acetate turnover in the mesophilic <b>digestor</b> increased from 15 to 40 μM/min. Propionate turnover ranged from 2 to 5. 2 and 1. 5 to 4. 5 μM/min in the thermophilic and mesophilic digestors, respectively. Butyrate turnover (0. 7 to 1. 2 μM/min) was similar in both digestors.

Two weeks after start-up, Methanosarcina sp. {{was present in}} high numbers (105 to 106 CFU/ml) and autofluorescent Methanosarcina-like clumps were abundant in sludge examined by using epifluorescence microscopy. After about 4 months of <b>digestor</b> operation, numbers of Methanosarcina sp. dropped 2 to 3 orders of magnitude and large numbers (most probable number = 106 to 107 /ml) of a thermophilic aceticlastic methanogen morphologically resembing Methanothrix sp. were found. Methanothrix sp. had apparently displaced Methanosarcina sp. as the dominant aceticlastic methanogen in the <b>digestor.</b> During the period when Methanothrix sp. was apparently dominant, acetate concentrations varied between 0. 3 and 1. 5 μmol/ml during the daily feeding cycle, and acetate was the precursor of 63 to 66 % of the methane produced during peak <b>digestor</b> methanogenesis. The apparent Km value obtained for methanogenesis from acetate, 0. 3 μmol/ml, indicated that the aceticlastic methanogens were nearly saturated for substrate {{during most of the}} <b>digestor</b> cycle. CO 2 -reducing methanogens were capable of methanogenesis at rates more than 12 times greater than those usually found in the <b>digestor.</b> Added propionate (4. 5 μmol/ml) was metabolized slowly by the <b>digestor</b> populations and slightly inhibited methanogenesis. Added n-butyrate, isobutyrate, or n-valerate (4. 5 μmol/ml each) were broken down within 24 h. Isobutyrate was oxidized to acetate, a novel reaction possibly involving isomerization to n-butyrate.

During syntrophic methanogenesis, flocs were the primary site for formate production via ethanol-dependent CO 2 reduction, with a formate production rate and methanogenic turnover constant of 660 μM/h and 0. 044 /min, respectively. Floc preparations accumulated fourfold-higher levels of formate (40 μM) than <b>digestor</b> contents, and the free flora was the primary site for formate cleavage to CO 2 and H 2 (90 μM formate per h). Inhibition of methanogenesis by CHCl 3 resulted in formate accumulation and suppression of syntrophic ethanol oxidation. H 2 gas was an insignificant intermediary metabolite of syntrophic ethanol conversion by flocs, and its exogenous addition neither stimulated methanogenesis nor inhibited the initial rate of ethanol oxidation.

Sewage and septage were subjected to separate preliminary and primary treatment and subsequently to joint activated sludge treatment. The performance of the treatment plant was satisfactory, resulting in an overall mean effluent BOD 5 concentration of 24 mg. l- 1 and an adequately stabilized sludge. However, persistent sludge bulking, which prevailed for most of the studied period, casts doubts on the effectiveness of future performance at full load, not only with respect to final effluent quality but also in relation to the degree of sludge stabilization, due to possible short retention times in the <b>digestors.</b> Identification of the causes of bulking through systematic research and improvement of the sludge thickening processes are two priority aspects which should be presently addressed, in order to ensure efficient future performance of the plant...|$|R
40|$|Anaerobic {{degradation}} of the sulfated polysaccharide carrageenan was investigated by batch digestion of the red macroalga Eucheuma cottonii. During a 10 -week incubation, ca. 60 % of the starting E. cottonii biomass was fermented to CO 2, methane, and volatile fatty acids (predominantly acetate). Carrageenan degradation paralleled the loss of total biomass, suggesting no preferential degradation or preservation. After 10 weeks of incubation, the carrageenan content of the remaining biomass was 51 %, as opposed to 61 % of the original E. cottonii biomass. Carrageenan recovered after 10 weeks of digestion had a lower average molecular weight (319, 000 versus 510, 000) and formed solutions with considerably lower viscosities than did intact carrageenan. The percent C and percent N content of the particulate material in the <b>digestors</b> increased over time, probably {{as a result of}} microbial growth. In contrast, the percent S content decreased continuously; the loss of sulfur was most likely a result of the hydrolysis of carrageenan. Results from this study indicate that it is not economically viable to process E. cottonii simultaneously for hydrocolloids and methane...|$|R
40|$|Nine {{castrated}} male buffaloes {{and nine}} Zebu steers aging 18 to 24 months and weighing 330 to 350 kg in average, respectively, were individually fed: 2 Kg unheated ground soybean; 2 kg crushed corn ears(grains, hulls and cobs) plus sorghum silage "ad libitum" with daily control of intake, during 112 {{days in a}} feedlot experiment. All animals were killed {{at the end of}} the experiment and the content of each rumen was homogenized and sampled 30 to 40 ml of ruminal fluid, from which a 10 ml aliquot was collected in a test tube containing 20 ml of a solution (formaldehyde 1 : 2 in distilled water) being immediately shaken for the fixation of the ciliate protozoa. After identification and counting of the protozoa the following conclusions were achieved: 1) There was a higher concentration of ciliate protozoa in Zebu than in buffalo despite the fact that more genera of protozoa were present in buffalo; 2) ciliate protozoa, <b>digestors</b> of fibre, were detected in higher number in Zebu cattle; 3) Entodinium spp represented more than 80 % of total ciliate protozoa both in Zebu cattle and buffalo...|$|R
