25|$|Speculation {{in stocks}} {{is a risky}} and complex {{occupation}} because {{the direction of the}} markets are generally unpredictable and lack transparency, also financial regulators are sometimes unable to adequately detect, prevent and remediate irregularities committed by malicious listed companies or other financial market participants. In addition, the financial markets are usually subjected to speculation. This does not invalidate the well documented true and genuine stories of large success and consistent profitability of many <b>individual</b> <b>stock</b> investors and stock investing organizations along the history.|$|E

However, several major (and many minor) motherboard revisions are introduced in an attempt to build systems more cheaply (and thus increase profits), and as a happy side effect, to allow them to run cooler while consuming less power. Note that there is no clear divide between the appearance of motherboard revisions in retail.

2500|$|An {{example that}} has both hedge and {{speculative}} notions involves {{a mutual fund}} or separately managed account whose investment objective is to track {{the performance of a}} stock index such as the S 500 stock index. The Portfolio manager often [...] "equitizes" [...] cash inflows in an easy and cost effective manner by investing in (opening long) S 500 stock index futures. This gains the portfolio exposure to the index which is consistent with the fund or account investment objective without having to buy an appropriate proportion of each of the individual 500 stocks just yet. This also preserves balanced diversification, maintains a higher degree of the percent of assets invested in the market and helps reduce tracking error in the performance of the fund/account. When it is economically feasible (an efficient amount of shares of every individual position within the fund or account can be purchased), the portfolio manager can close the contract and make purchases of each <b>individual</b> <b>stock.</b>|$|E
