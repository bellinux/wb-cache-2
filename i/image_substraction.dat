The image on the computer monitor represents the relative mass change between two radiographs. Fourier filtering is used to reduce noise artefacts. This method is validated through an experiment with a step wedge. DIR needs only a preliminary calibration of the experimental conditions of operation and avoids tedious calibrations for each measurement {{as in the case}} of digital <b>image</b> <b>substraction.</b> Low-voltage X-ray techniques are suggested for long-term quantitative studies of patients to minimize irradiation doses...|$|E
40|$|The {{primary cause}} of {{blindness}} in India and worldwide is recognized as Diabetic Retinopathy, which is an eye disorder caused by diabetes. For diagnosis of diabetic retinopathy, ophthalmologists use retinal image of a patient which is known as fundus image. This fundus image is captured using digital camera known as opthalmoscope. This paper presents an automated image processing system which detects the abnormality as Proliferative diabetic retinopathy(PDR) using <b>image</b> <b>substraction</b> technique and Severe diabetic retinopathy(SDR) using blob detection technique. It also gives the severity in percentage from which we get an idea that a patient {{is on the verge}} of diabetic retinopathy or not which further helps to avoid blindness...|$|E
40|$|Speckle {{interferometry}} {{was applied}} for rapid and exact quantitative determination of the contour of complex technical components using two different methods: (i) object beam sweep, and (ii) wave length variation. In method (i) the lighting direction {{of one or two}} beams and in method (ii) the wave length of a laser diode or of a pulse laser are varied after a first recording of the speckle <b>image.</b> <b>Substraction</b> of both identity images yields the contour stripes, which contain the topographic information on the object. For quantitative treatment the phase shift algorithm is applied. Phase shift is carried out in time or in space coordinates. Phase shift in time coordinates gives the higher measuring accuracy, while spacely phase shift offers the advantages of a smaller number of recordings.

40|$|We {{propose a}} {{lightweight}} method for {{the determination of}} heat diffusivity of silica fiber bundles based {{on the use of}} a laser and an IR camera. The fiber bundle is maintained in traction in a holder; exposition is made as a step function, followed by a laser shutdown. The movie obtained by the IR camera is then processed : frame averaging, backgraound computation and <b>substraction,</b> <b>image</b> smoothing, extraction of the IR signal along the fiber bundle. A 1 D model has been developed. This problem admits an analytic solution that we have obtained through the use of Laplace transforms. Several identification methods are proposed and tested, and have been compared favorably with an existing method based on periodic heating. Results are in agreement with literature values...|$|R
40|$|Accepted for {{publication}} in A&ASWe have observed a sample of 15 and 8 quasars with redshifts between 0. 11 and 0. 87 (mean value 0. 38) in the J and Kb́ands respectively. Eleven of the quasars were previously known {{to be associated with}} extended emission line regions. After deconvolution of the <b>image,</b> <b>substraction</b> of the PSF when possible, and identification of companions with the help of HST archive images when available, extensions are seen for at least eleven quasars. However, average profiles are {{different from that of the}} PSF in only four objects, for which a good fit is obtained with an r^ 1 / 4 law, suggesting that the underlying galaxies are ellipticals. Redshifts were available in the literature for surrounding objects in five quasar fields. For these objects, one to five companion galaxies were found. One quasar even belongs to a richness class 1 cluster. Most other quasars in our sample have nearby galaxies in projection which may also be companions. Environmental effects are therefore probably important to account for the properties of these objects...|$|E

Airbags, ABS, ESP, ECU, ESP, climate control & more are the common features of most luxuries cars. Providing full assistance to the driver for the distance from other vehicle and while lane detection is the main use of Intelligent driver assistance system. To detect the white lane and distance between obstacle and car Video Streaming is taken by camera in this system. SD card is used to store streamed video for processing by using Python. <b>Image</b> <b>substraction</b> method used to detect lane detection from the video. Small Robot is used as demo module and one is pilot car it acts as obstacle in all possible direction to design the system. Obstacle detector sensors are used to detect the obstacle in front and rear direction of the system Ultrasonic sensor it acts as the obstacle detector to detect the any obstacle {{within the range of}} 4 meters. In Driver assistance system provide the full assistance to the driver by detecting the white lane by processing the video using Python script and obstacle is detect by using Ultrasonic sensor module. Display that consist of TFT screen is used to display video and the distance between obstacle and car in meter.

40|$|This thesis studied multi-wave mixing in photorefractive crystals, such as, Fe: LiNbO, SBN, {{and their}} {{application}} to real-time image processing. The first chapter introduced {{the development of}} multi-wave mixing phase conjugation and its recent progress. The second chapter deated with four-wave mixing, including photorefractive effect theory, stable-FWM, varialion pumpwave FWM, and the time response charetristes. The 3 rd charpter is studying on real-time correcting distortion via FWM, including one way and double way through distortion medium, in the same time, we used perturbation approximation theory for analysis of phase distortion in-DFWM. It's seen from the caculation result that an important way of increasing the readoutwave's ratio of signal to noise (s/n) {{is to reduce the}} resulant distortion of input waves. The 4 th chapter, basied on large signal FWM theory, we have demonstrated optical bistablity hyteresis effect in FWM, and the result of experiment (with Fe: KNbO,) is also given. The 5 th chapter used the fifth order nonlinear effect theory to explain the new phenomenon observed in our experiment, namely the two-pair conjugation waves produced by a probe wave in the process of the Fe: LiNbO, crystal's DFWM. The 6 th chapter applied the FWM phase conjugation to optical associative memory and nearly real-time <b>image</b> <b>substraction</b> and edge enhancement. The 7 th chapter studied degenerate six-wave mixing theory and its application to real-time parallelimage processing, logic operation "exOR". The 8 th chapter utilized FWM phase conjugation to set up three kinds phase conjugation interferometers. The results of the experiment are also given...|$|E
