5|$|With the saloons and grocers closed, about 150 men, {{armed with}} Winchester rifles, moved toward Chinatown in Rock Springs. They moved in two groups and entered Chinatown by {{crossing}} separate bridges. The larger group <b>entered</b> <b>by</b> {{way of the}} railroad bridge and was divided into squads, a few of which remained standing {{on the opposite side}} of the bridge outside Chinatown. The smaller group <b>entered</b> <b>by</b> way of the town's plank bridge.|$|E
5|$|In the 1960s {{and early}} 1970s, drivers who had reached Formula One often {{continued}} {{to compete in}} Formula Two. In 1966 MRD produced the BT18 for the lower category, with a Honda engine acting as a stressed component. The car was extremely successful, winning 11 consecutive Formula Two races {{in the hands of}} the Formula One pairing of Brabham and Hulme. Cars were <b>entered</b> <b>by</b> MRD and not by the Brabham Racing Organisation, avoiding a direct conflict with Repco, their Formula One engine supplier.|$|E

5|$|The {{church was}} built in the Gothic style, and has {{historically}} been associated with the Stanley family of Alderley. Its major features include a fine tower, the Stanley pew which is <b>entered</b> <b>by</b> an outside staircase, a 14th-century font, the western gallery, and monuments to the Lords Stanley of Alderley. The grounds contain a 17th-century former schoolhouse, now used as a parish hall, a medieval church cross, and the Stanley Mausoleum, which dates from 1909. An ancient yew tree stands in the churchyard.|$|E
5|$|As of 2012 {{the ground}} and top floors of the main house, {{together}} with the adjacent wings, are used as accommodation for the elderly. The reception rooms of the first floor {{are open to the}} public at advertised times, and are <b>entered</b> <b>by</b> the original stairway on the south front; they contain paintings and furniture collected by the Leicester family. Some items in the collection had formerly been displayed on this floor, whilst others were moved from elsewhere in the house. The first floor may also be hired for weddings, meetings, and conferences. It is managed by a trust, which is supported by a group of Friends and by volunteers.|$|E
50|$|To {{participate}} in the race the competitor {{must be at least}} the age of 16. In order to <b>enter</b> <b>by</b> July 1st there is a $220 fee. To <b>enter</b> <b>by</b> July 15th, the fee is $320, and to <b>enter</b> <b>by</b> July 25th the fee is $420. However, the fees are all worth their prices because upon completing the race the canoers are awarded cash prizes. The reward for first place is $5,000. Second place is $3,500, and third place receives $2,500. Even if a racer finishes in 40th place, they will receive $230 which is more than their entry fee. Competitors that finish after 40th place will receive a finishers metal.|$|R

The floor of the cave has a coating of cement, while the ceiling of the middle room bears painted concentric circles.|$|E
5|$|During {{the second}} lap {{a number of}} drivers were forced to retire with broken wheels. Both Darracq drivers, A. Rawlinson and Algernon Lee Guinness, {{suffered}} from the issue; Rawlinson broke his in Ramsey, while Lee Guinness hit a well at Hilberry. A. J. Dew also broke a wheel, but continued the race in W. H. Warren's car; both being <b>entered</b> <b>by</b> J. W. H. Dew. A fourth driver, {{in one of the}} White steam cars, succumbed to the same problem, while A. J. Hancock crashed his Vauxhall into a tree, also breaking a wheel. Napier was once again the quickest driver around the circuit, followed by Percy Northey in a Rolls Royce, and Norman Littlejohn in the Vinot-Deguingand.|$|E
5|$|Like its predecessor, Super Smash Bros. Melee {{differs from}} {{traditional}} fighting games as {{the objective is}} to force their opponents beyond the boundaries of the stage. Most attacks inflict damage and can, if enough damage is dealt, knock back the enemy. Each character's health is measured by a meter that represents the damage received as a percentage. The higher the percentage value, the farther the player gets knocked back, and the easier they are to knock off the stage, which will result in the character's death and the loss of a stock, or life. Unlike other games of the same genre, in which moves are <b>entered</b> <b>by</b> button-input combinations, most moves in Super Smash Bros. Melee can be accessed via one-button presses and a joystick direction.|$|E

5|$|Like {{most major}} cities, Montreal needs easy highway access from its suburbs and {{surrounding}} areas. However, because Montreal {{was built on}} an island surrounded by three rivers, it can be <b>entered</b> <b>by</b> land only on a bridge or through a tunnel. Although the city was founded in 1642, it was not before 1847 that the first fixed link to the outside was established when a wooden bridge was built across Rivière des Prairies to Île Jésus, {{on the site of}} what is now Ahuntsic Bridge. Another bridge was built immediately afterward, a few kilometers west, which became Lachapelle Bridge, and another in 1849, Pont des Saints-Anges, to the east. The latter bridge collapsed in the 1880s and was never rebuilt.|$|E
5|$|On the High Street, No. 106 and 107 {{stand on}} the site of Tackley's Inn; built around 1295, it was the first piece of {{property}} that Adam de Brome acquired when he began to found the college in 1324. It comprised a hall and chambers leased to scholars, behind a frontage of five shops, with the scholars above and a cellar of five bays below. The hall, which was open to the roof, was 33feet (10m) long, 20feet (6m) wide, and about 22feet (7m) high; at the east end was a large chamber with another chamber above it. The south wall of the building, which survives, was partly of stone and contains a large two-light early 14th-century window. The cellar below is of the same date and is the best preserved medieval cellar in Oxford; originally <b>entered</b> <b>by</b> stone steps from the street, it has a stone vault divided into four sections by two diagonal ribs, with carved corbels.|$|E
5|$|Players {{assume the}} role of Rivel, an immortal summoner who ventures through the enchanted Aldemona Wood. He has been tasked to track down the rebel group Temperance, led by Quraist Kingsley, who have assassinated a member of the royal family. The forest at times magically seals itself, {{trapping}} visitors inside, and is rumored to hold a source of mystical power for which Quraist is searching. The game consists of twelve stages, which are large branching maps that allow the player to move from points represented by stars to adjacent points. Each stage contains its own objectives, from defeating beasts that block the player’s way, to solving puzzles before time runs out. Additional stages are available for purchase as downloadable content. There are multiple optional objectives per stage, in addition to a main goal. Many areas of each stage are initially blocked off, and can only be <b>entered</b> <b>by</b> replaying the stage later in the game.|$|E

5|$|Rindt was {{pronounced}} dead {{on the way to}} hospital and Lotus withdrew all cars from the race, including the Lotus 72 <b>entered</b> <b>by</b> Rob Walker. The Grand Prix went ahead and Clay Regazzoni took his maiden victory, but celebrations were muted. There was a lengthy investigation into Rindt's death in Italy, leading to a trial against Colin Chapman; he was cleared of all charges in 1976. The destroyed Lotus 72 remained in Italy after the trial, going to a scrapyard near Monza. In 1985, a real estate agent found the wreckage and bought it from the authorities, later trading it in 1993 for a Lola Formula 3 car. Since then, the car has rested in a garage near Milan.|$|E
5|$|Special Stages are <b>entered</b> <b>by</b> finding giant rings {{hidden in}} secret passageways: the player {{is placed in}} a 3D {{environment}} and must turn all {{of a number of}} blue spheres red by running through them, but must avoid all red spheres, including formerly blue ones. Yellow spheres bounce the player long distances, and white spheres with red stars on them make the player walk backwards in the opposite direction. Completing a Special Stage earns the player a Chaos Emerald; collecting all seven Emeralds allows the player to turn into Super Sonic or Super Knuckles, more powerful versions of the characters.|$|E
5|$|The 1943 Surprise {{hurricane}} was {{the first}} hurricane to be <b>entered</b> <b>by</b> a reconnaissance aircraft. The first tracked tropical cyclone of the 1943 Atlantic hurricane season, this system developed as a tropical storm while situated over the northeastern Gulf of Mexico on July25. The storm gradually strengthened while tracking westward and reached hurricane status late on July26. Thereafter, the hurricane curved slightly west-northwestward and continued intensifying. Early on July27, it became a Category2 hurricane on the modern-day Saffir–Simpson hurricane wind scale and peaked with winds of 105mph (165km/h). The system maintained this intensity until landfall on the Bolivar Peninsula in Texas late on July27. After moving inland, the storm initially weakened rapidly, but remained a tropical cyclone until dissipating over north-central Texas on July29.|$|E

5|$|The {{entrance}} at {{the north}} side is a short descending corridor lined with red granite followed by a passageway ending at the burial chamber with its gabled roof comprising large limestone beams. Today these beams are damaged, which weakens the pyramid structure. Fragments of the sarcophagus were found here in the burial chamber, {{when it was first}} <b>entered</b> <b>by</b> John Shae Perring in the mid 19th century. The colossal roof blocks of Sahure's temple weighed up to about 220 tons based on estimates by Perring. He estimated the size of the largest blocks at 35 feet by 9 feet by 12 feet. One end of these blocks was tapered so the estimated volume is 95 cubic meters or 2.4 tons. The mortuary complex immediately around the pyramid also comprises a second pyramid built for the Ka of the king.|$|E
5|$|With {{the team}} disinvited from Paris–Nice and Tirreno–Adriatico, their next stage race was the Volta ao Distrito de Santarém, a race which neither Astana nor Discovery Channel {{had participated in}} the year before. The team did not win any stage, though Andreas Klöden {{finished}} on the event's final podium, in third. Astana next entered the Vuelta a Castilla y León with a squad that was thought to greatly outclass the squads <b>entered</b> <b>by</b> other teams. Contador won the opening time trial and the mountainous fourth stage en route to winning the race overall. Leipheimer also showed well, finishing 4 seconds off Contador's winning time in the time trial, and falling only on Stage 4, where he rode in support of Contador, to finish in fourth overall.|$|E
5|$|The monks' {{dormitory}} {{was on the}} {{top floor}} of the east range, a long room with a high pitched roof (the mark of which can still be seen on the transept wall) which ran the length of the building. This was <b>entered</b> <b>by</b> two staircases: the day stair went down into the cloister in the south-east corner; the night stair led into the south transept of the church to allow the monks to get easily from bed to choir at night. Initially the dormitory was an open hall, with the monks' beds placed along the walls, one under each of the small, slit-like windows. During the fourteenth century, when views of the necessity of sleeping in the same space together for the common life changed, the dormitory at Netley would, as at other houses, have been divided into sections with wooden dividers to give every monk his own private area, each leading off a central corridor. The treasury, a tiny vaulted room, was at the north end of the dormitory, preumably located for security at night.|$|E
