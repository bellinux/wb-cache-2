50|$|Constant seating stress gaskets {{derive their}} {{name from the}} fact that the carrier ring profile takes flange {{rotation}} (deflection under bolt preload) into consideration. With all other conventional gaskets, as the flange fasteners are tightened, the flange deflects radially under load, resulting in the greatest gasket compression, and highest <b>gasket</b> <b>stress,</b> at the outer gasket edge.|$|E
50|$|Tighten {{the bolts}} on the flange. Due to vibration, {{temperature}} changes, {{and other factors}} such as spiral wound <b>gasket</b> <b>stress</b> relaxation, the bolt tension will gradually decrease, resulting in loss of torque, causing a leak. In general longer bolts and smaller diameters of bolt are better at preventing the loss of torque. A long thin bolt is {{an effective way to}} prevent torque loss. Heating for {{a certain period of time}} to stretch the bolt, and then maintaining a given torque, is very effective in preventing the loss of torque. When the gasket is thinner and smaller there will be a greater loss of torque. In addition, prevent strong vibration of the machine and the pipe itself, and isolate them from adjacent equipment vibration. Impacts on the sealing surface are not meaningless. Not impacting the tightened bolts can prevent the loss of torque.|$|E
40|$|Pipe flange {{connections}} with gaskets in chemical plants, electric {{power plants and}} other industrial plants are usually exposed to elevated internal pressure with cyclic thermal condition. It is important to investigate the sealing performance of pipe connections under long term severe thermal exposure swings to ensure operational safety. In this study, the effects of cyclic thermal conditions on the sealing performance and mechanical characteristics in larger and smaller nominal diameter of pipe flange connection are examined using FEM calculations. Helium gas leakage is predicted using the contact <b>gasket</b> <b>stress</b> obtained from the FEM results. On other hand, the leakage tests using the smaller nominal diameter of pipe flange connection were conducted to measure the amount of helium gas leakage and to compare with the predicted amount of gas leakage. As the results, the contact <b>gasket</b> <b>stress</b> distributions were changed dramatically under cyclic thermal condition and elevated internal pressure. In the pipe {{flange connections}} with smaller nominal diameter, the contact <b>gasket</b> <b>stress</b> was the smallest in the restart condition. On other hand, the minimum contact <b>gasket</b> <b>stress</b> in the pipe flange connection with larger nominal diameter was depending on the materials of connection. In the pipe flange connection with larger nominal diameter, the contact <b>gasket</b> <b>stress</b> distributed and changed in the radial direction due to the flange rotation. A fairly good agreement {{was found between the}} experimental leakage result and predicted leakage results...|$|E
5000|$|Since {{the carrier}} ring used in {{constant}} seating <b>stress</b> <b>gaskets</b> take this deflection {{into account when}} creating the carrier ring for a given flange size, pressure class, and material, the carrier ring profile can be adjusted to enable the <b>gasket</b> seating <b>stress</b> to be radially uniform across the entire sealing area. Further, because the sealing elements are fully confined by the flange faces in opposing channels on the carrier ring, any in-service compressive forces acting on the gasket are transmitted through the carrier ring and avoid any further compression of the sealing elements, thus maintaining a 'constant' <b>gasket</b> seating <b>stress</b> while in-service. Thus, the gasket is immune to common gasket failure modes that include creep relaxation, high system vibration, or system thermal cycles.|$|R
50|$|The {{fundamental}} concept {{underlying the}} improved sealability for constant seating <b>stress</b> <b>gaskets</b> are that (i) if the flange sealing surfaces {{are capable of}} attaining a seal, (ii) the sealing elements are compatible with the process fluid and application, and (iii) the sufficient <b>gasket</b> seating <b>stress</b> is achieved on installation necessary to affect a seal, then {{the possibility of the}} gasket leaking in-service is greatly reduced or eliminated altogether.|$|R

Considering the creep effect of metal flexible graphite composite gasket under high temperature, the deformation compatibility equation of bolted flange connection system was deduced. The time-dependence of flange rotation, the gasket deformation and the gasket contact stress were studied systematically. Moreover, the influencing factors of leakage rate were analyzed in detail. Finally, based on the theory of tightness, the safety assessment method due to leakage rate was constructed under high temperature.

40|$|Abstract. The structure, material, {{production}} and application situation of metal winding gasket were summarized, and the preparation technology and product properties of metal winding gasket were analyzed. The results showed: {{under the same}} <b>gasket</b> <b>stress,</b> the leakage rate increased {{with the increase of}} medium pressure; Under the same medium pressure, the leakage rate declined with the increase of the <b>gasket</b> <b>stress.</b> By comparing with the performance of traditional asbestos winding gasket, the new metal winding gasket’s performance has reached the requirement of asbestos winding gasket and can replace asbestos winding gasket. Preface Metal winding gasket is a kind of combined sealing gasket, which is made by a certain shape of the metal, non-metallic filler, inner ring and outer ring. Because its wide range of pressure and temperature, metal winding gasket has been widely used in petrochemical, machinery, energy, transportation and other industries of vessel and pipeline flange connection.

40|$|AbstractMetal to Metal contact (MMC) {{bolted flange}} joint, which appears between gasket {{centering}} ring and flange facing, {{is widely used}} in nuclear and petrochemical industry for severe conditions. Compared to the floating type joints, the gasket outer metal ring is compressed after bolt-up and the stored energy can compensate the loss of residual <b>gasket</b> <b>stress</b> due to internal pressure, bending moment and creep, resulting in a low leakage. As {{it is difficult to}} assess the flanged joint integrity affected by creep analytically, a three-dimensional nonlinear finite element model is developed to highlight the creep behaviour of MMC flanged joint under different load cases at elevated temperature. The results show that MMC flanged joint can reduce the unloading effects due to creep and a suitable preload is recommended...|$|E
40|$|Bolted flange joints form {{a part of}} {{pressure}} vessels and piping components, and are used extensively in the chemical, petrochemical and nuclear power industries. They are simple structures and offer the possibility of disassembly, making them attractive for connecting pressurized equipment and piping. In addition of being prone to leakage, they often require maintenance while in operation, {{in which case the}} bolts are either retightened, as in hot torquing, or untightened for replacement. Although such maintenance work prevents costly shutdowns, it can nevertheless expose the operator to a potential risk because altering the bolt load can produce a gasket load unbalance, which results in a local <b>gasket</b> contact <b>stress</b> drop below a critical value, causing a major leak, and putting the operator’s life at risk. This proposal addresses flange deflection variation as it investigates the flange contact stress level unbalance around the flange when the bolts are subjected to a load alteration during operation. This study may serve to help limit the degree of load increase in hot torquing or the maximum number of bolts to be replaced at a time, and to identify the flanges whose bolts cannot be replaced while they are in operation. The objective {{of this study is to}} determine a theoretical approach for identifying and analyzing the effects of initial bolt-up and pressurization on the bolted flange joints, in order to obtain a solution for bolt spacing calculation, according to different <b>gasket</b> contact <b>stress</b> variation levels. Our research breaks down into three parts. The first part, an analytical method based on the theory of circular beams resting on a linear elastic foundation, is developed to predict the circumferential distribution of <b>gasket</b> contact <b>stresses.</b> Finite element model of symmetry bolted flange joints is created for use in evaluating the analysis. Then, as a second step of this research, an approach based on the theory of a ring on a non-linear elastic foundation behavior is applied in order to get more accurate results than linear model solution. This part is applied to non-linear solution and then validated by finite element analysis. In the third part, a linear regression model is developed to propose bolt spacing calculation procedures for bolted flange joint connections. In industrial practice, this work should help in designing, maintaining and operating technical pressure vessels and piping systems...|$|R

40|$|The three {{critical}} components within a bolted, flanged connection are the flanges, gasket, and bolts. Until recently, simplified flange assembly target torque values for ASME B 16. 5 flanges were routinely determined by considering {{just one or}} two of these primary components. One approach considers only the gasket. Gasket-based target torque values are selected to optimize the gasket’s sealing performance by ensuring compression between minimum and maximum seating stress ranges, or based upon achieving specific levels of gasket Tightness (Tp).

40|$|The {{deflections}} of gaskets {{after initial}} tightening largely affect the residual bolt {{forces and the}} tightness of bolted flanged connections. The bolt forces decrease significantly due to the deflections of gaskets after initial tightening in the cases where expanded PTFE gaskets are used. The visco-elastic characteristic of the gaskets is the main cause for the phenomenon. It was shown in the paper PVP 2012 - 78694 that the tightness improved even if the bolt forces reduced in the long term. This is because the gasket becomes packed under a high <b>gasket</b> <b>stress.</b> It is important to estimate the thickness change of gaskets to evaluate the tightness of bolted flanged connections. In this paper, an analytical model of a bolted flanged connection, in which the flanges, the bolts and the gasket are represented by spring constants, is proposed. Experiments were carried out to measure the creep characteristic of the expanded PTFE gasket. The residual bolt forces and the deflection of the gasket were estimated based on the analytical model of the bolted flanged connection and the creep characteristic of the gasket. Thus, the relationship between gasket deflection and the tightness of the bolted flanged connection are clarified...|$|E
40|$|The {{reliability}} of industrial installation requires minimum leakage of pressurized sealed joints during operation. At the design stage, the leakage {{behavior of the}} gasket {{must be one of}} the most important parameter in the gasket selection. The objective of the work presented in this paper is to develop an analytical leak rate prediction methodology used in gasketed joints. A pseudo analytical-experimental innovative approach was used to estimate the characteristics of the porous structure for the purpose of predicting accurate leak rate through gaskets with different fluids under conditions similar to those of operation. The analytical model assumes the flow to be continuum but employs a slip boundary con dition on the leak path wall to determine the porosity parameters of the gasket. The analytical model results are vali dated and confronted against experimental data which were conducted under various conditions of fluid media, pressure, <b>gasket</b> <b>stress</b> and temperature. Two experimental test rig s fully automate that accurately reproduces the real leakage behavior of the gasketed joint have been developed to analyze the mechanical and thermal effects on the gasket flow regime.

40|$|In {{the present}} paper, the <b>gasket</b> <b>stress</b> distributions, hub stress and a {{variation}} in axial bolt force in bolted gasketed pipe flange connections under internal pressure are analyzed using elasto-plastic FEM {{taking into account}} the nonlinearity of gasket behavior. Non-asbestos spiral wound gaskets were employed. The effect of nominal flange diameter is examined on the gasket contact stress distributions, the hub stress and the variation in axial bolt force (the load factor) is examined. Using the obtained gasket contact stress distribution and the fundamental data of the relationship between gasket compressive stress and gasket leak rate according to JIS B 2490, a method for predicting the leak rate is demonstrated. Experiments to measure the amount of leakage, the hub stress and the variation in axial bolt force when the joint is under internal pressure were carried out. The numerical results of the leak rate, hub stress and the load factor are in a fairly good agreement with the measured results. Then, a method is demonstrated for determining the bolt preload under given conditions, that is, taking into account assembly efficiency, leak rate and internal pressure In addition, bolt preload is determined using the actual gasket contact stress which can be estimated using the value of the load factor. As a design example, the procedure for determining the bolt preload in 3 ” and 20 “ nominal diameter pipe flange connections is shown for the allowable leak rate of 1. 0 - 3 Pa ･m 3 /s.

40|$|The {{buckling}} of {{spiral wound}} gaskets (SWGs) causes turbulence of the fluid flow inside flanges and {{may result in}} leakage failure over time due to the unwinding of the spirals. A few limited studies on the lateral forces generated by axial compression of the gasket sealing element which cause this phenomenon {{are available in the}} literature. The lateral forces are generated during initial tightening and are not distributed uniformly in the circumferential direction. Hence there is an introduction of concentrated forces in small areas. The non-uniform <b>gasket</b> contact <b>stress</b> caused by the tightening sequence makes the problem more complex. It is suggested to study experimentally the buckling of spiral wound gaskets by developing a special test bench designed for this purpose.

The IAEA requirements for type IP 2 (Industrial Package Type 2) packages include to carry out free drop tests that represent normal conditions of transport. In such conditions, obviously, the required containment capability of the package has to be ensured. In this study the mechanical performances of a new Italian packaging system for the transportation of low and intermediate level wastes (LILW) undergoing horizontal free drop test are investigated.

30|$|Taking the {{advantages}} of low and high temperatures, low and high pressures and corrosion, the metal sealing gaskets are suitable for oil-gas exploitation, chemical industry and nuclear industry, where rubber seals are prohibited [12]. SPMC is a static metal seal without gasket, and the optimal sealing performance is the key technology. Up to now the researches of the pipeline connection are extensive, but few of them focus {{on the design of}} connector without gasket. In the design of a connector with gasket, the gasket factor and minimum <b>gasket</b> seating <b>stress</b> should be determined according to the design codes [13, 14] subject to gasket material and structural. These codes are based on a series of assumptions and might not define calculation procedures for sealing performance in detail [15]. Persson [16] and Kazeminia et al. [17] revaluated the leakage of metallic seal, which was used to design bolted flanged connections. Zhao et al. [18], established the mathematical relationship between the contact stress of metal sealing ring governing the sealing performance, the structural parameters and operating pressure, but did not consider the plastic deformation of metallic gasket. Sawa et al. [19] and Takaki et al. [20] studied the contact pressure on the sealing surface by elastic-plastic finite element analysis with regard of nonlinearity of gasket and internal pressure. However, the analysis is for the spiral wound gasket only. Nitta et al. [21], analyzed the critical contact pressure to eliminate the radial leakage paths by the quantitative analysis of the leakage, but did not discover the critical contact pressure to fully block the leakage paths. Using a finite element analysis approach, Joshi et al. [22], and Abid et al. [23] studied the flange connection without gasket, which concluded surface profiles, thickness of flange and bolt pre-stress had effects on the stress in the flange and bolts as well as flange rotation and displacement, but the effects on sealing performance wasn’t investigated. Guindani et al. [24], studied the deformation recovery of sealing material and optimized the sealing performance of rubber. Bouzid et al. [25] and Wu et al. [26] proved the mean contact pressure and its distribution on sealing surface took important effects on sealing performance. By finite element analysis and experiment, Noga et al. [27] proved the suitable contact pressure and width of plastic deformation were the key parameters to guarantee the sealing performance of flange connection without gasket. However, the critical values of contact pressure and plastic deformation are not investigated. According to the above researches, the right contact pressure will make the plastic deformation happen on sealing surface and block micro leakage paths. Therefore, the contact pressure is essential for the optimal sealing performance of SPMC.|$|R
40|$|The {{immersed}} tunnel {{technique is}} a common used technique for river crossings in the Netherlands, {{but also in the}} United States and Japan. 80 % of the immersed tunnels are built in these 3 countries. The design of the immersed tunnels differs for the different countries, because of the possibility of seismic loading on the tunnel structure. This seismic loading can occur at the west coast of the United States and in Japan, because of their position close to tectonic earth plates. The immersed tunnels in the Netherlands are built with elements of 100 - 150 meter consisting of segments of 20 - 25 meters. For transportation these segments are pre-stressed forming one element, after immersion on the river bottom they are released again. In this way the tunnel is flexible and can follow the settlement differences of the river bed. The water tightness in the joints is secured with rubber sealing profiles in the segment joints (W 9 U) and compressible rubber profiles in the immersion joint (Gina). In areas where risk of seismic activity is severe, the immersed tunnels are built different. The pre-stressed tunnel elements are kept as one element, the same as they are for transportation, to prevent joint opening and leakage. This results in large deformations in the immersion joints and Gina <b>gaskets</b> and <b>stresses</b> in the tunnel structure. For this reason a research is performed on the behaviour of the segmental immersed tunnel subjected to seismic loading and especially on the sensitive segment joint. Most earthquakes are created by the movement of tectonic plates. The release of energy involved with this movement creates seismic waves which will propagate through the soil. When these waves reach an immersed tunnel, it will respond to the soil movements with a certain behaviour. The design seismic wave that causes the tunnel to deform is the shear wave (S-wave). When this wave propagates parallel to the tunnel axis, the tunnel will bend in lateral direction causing the snaking effect. This can occur in horizontal and vertical direction, but the horizontal direction is determining. When the wave reaches the tunnel under an angle of 45 °, the tunnel can be deformed in axial direction. This is called the worming effect. Both the worming and snaking effect are modeled to determine the influence of the different seismic design parameters like the wave length of the seismic wave, the construction depth and the tunnel element length. Other important model properties are the stiffness of the rubber gaskets in the segment joints and the immersion joints. All the properties and loads due to the seismic soil movement are included in two different beam models to determine the worming and snaking effect for a representative immersed tunnel. The modeling of the worming and snaking effect shows that the gasket properties and the seismic wave length are the most important parameters. The compressibility of the Gina gasket and the elongation capacity of the W 9 U determines the total axial deformation of the immersed tunnel. For the snaking effect the rotation capacity and the number of Gina gaskets are of importance. The segment joints act relatively stiff and are of less importance until their moment capacity is reached. Then joint opening and leakage could occur. It can be concluded that the propagation speed and wave length of the seismic wave are important factors when modeling the worming and snaking effect of immersed tunnels. It is not clear from literature what the seismic design wave is for tunnels in soft soil. This needs to be investigated further to make a final judgment on the behaviour of the segment joints. For the used design parameters the tunnel can withstand the worming effect, but snaking could cause joint opening and leakage based on the free-field approach. For the snaking effect a soil-tunnel- interaction approach should be performed to determine the real tunnel response and make a final judgment of the behaviour of the segment joint.
