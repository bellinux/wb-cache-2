On 19 January 2006, the OMI total ozone column (TOC) was 16 ? 20 % below the January mean value of TOMS/NASA TOC (period 1996 ? 2005). The back trajectories analysis with the HYSplit model indicates that the notable decrease of TOC could be attributed to a fast rise of the isentropic trajectories height. Concomitantly, UV <b>erythemal</b> <b>radiation</b> greatly increases (between 23 % and 37 %) on 19 January 2006 respect to UV <b>erythemal</b> <b>radiation</b> measured on 19 January 2005.

40|$|Surface <b>erythemal</b> UV <b>radiation</b> {{is mainly}} {{affected}} by total column ozone, aerosols, clouds, and solar zenith angle. The effect of ozone {{on the surface}} UV radiation has been explored {{many times in the}} previous studies due to the decrease of ozone layer. In this study, we calculated the effect of aerosols on the surface UV radiation {{as well as that of}} ozone using data acquired from Ozone Monitoring Instrument (OMI). First, ozone, aerosol optical depth (AOD), and surface <b>erythemal</b> UVB <b>radiation</b> measured from satellite are compared with those from ground measurements. The results showed that the comparison for ozone was good with r (2) of 0. 92. For aerosol, there was difference between satellite measurements and surface measurements due to the insufficient information on aerosol in the retrieval algorithm. The r (2) for surface <b>erythemal</b> UV <b>radiation</b> was high (similar to 0. 94) but satellite measurements showed about 30 % larger values than surface measurements on average by not considering the effect of absorbing aerosols in the retrieval process from satellite measurements. Radiative amplification factor (RAF) is used to access the effect of ozone and aerosol quantitatively. RAF for ozone was 0. 97 similar to 1. 49 with solar zenith angle. To evaluate the effect of aerosol on the surface UV radiation, only clear-sky pixel data were used and solar zenith angle and total column amount of ozone were fixed. Also, RAF for aerosol was assessed according to the single scattering albedo (SSA) of aerosols. The results showed that RAF for aerosol with smaller SSA (0. 90). The RAF for aerosol was 0. 09 similar to 0. 22 for the given conditions which was relatively small compared to that for ozone. However, considering the fact that aerosol optical depth can change largely in time and space while the total column amount of ozone does not change very much, it needs to include the effect of aerosol to predict the variations of surface UV radiation more correctly. close 3...|$|R

The paper describes a calculation method for optimizing the ratio EVD/Eer behind sunscreens e. g. with SPF 5, 15 and 30 respectively. Taking into account that a majority of people in industrialized countries suffer from a shortage in vitamin D even in summer time, the ratio Evd/Eer is a new and important criterion for the quality of sunscreens. Furthermore the exposure time tvd needed per day for forming the equivalent of the recommended amount of 2000 IU of vitamin D per day for skin type 2 is estimated when sunscreens with different filter compositions are used.

40|$|The SMARTS 2 {{model has}} been used to {{estimate}} UV <b>erythemal</b> <b>radiation</b> (UVER) integrated on a horizontal plane and on vertical planes oriented north and south. The values obtained using the model were compared with experimental data provided by three radiometers YESUVB- llocated on these planes. To quantify the results, the statistical parameters considered were mean deviation, mean absolute deviation and root mean square deviation (RMSD). The results on a horizontal plane show RMSD values of about 10 %, when working with aerosol optical depth at 500 nm, and 16 % when working with the Ångström coefficient. As for the results obtained for the north and south planes, these reach very high errors. The RMSD in these cases is 20. 5 % for the south plane and 32. 5 % for the north plane, in the most favorable of cases, when there are optical depth values to quantify the load of aerosols. These results do not improve even considering an annual trend, taking into account the different seasons, norconsidering different periods throughout the day. We therefore consider that the SMARTS 2 is not suitable for estimating the UVER incident on inclined planes...|$|E

40|$|This study {{focuses on}} the {{analysis}} of the sensitivity of UV <b>erythemal</b> <b>radiation</b> (UVER) to variations in the total ozone column (TOC) under different sky conditions at Granada (southeastern Spain). The sensitivity is studied both in relative terms by means of the Radiation Amplification Factor (RAF) and in absolute terms using the Ozone Efficiency (OE). These two variables are determined for diverse sky conditions characterized by the cloud cover information given by a sky camera (in oktas) and the cloud optical depth (COD) estimated from global solar radiation measurements. As expected, in absolute terms, the TOC variations cause substantially smaller UVER changes during completely overcast situations than during cloud-free cases. For instance, the OE (SZA = 30 °, TOC = 290 DU) decreases from 0. 68 mW m− 2 per unit of TOC (0 oktas) to 0. 50 mW m− 2 per unit of TOC (8 oktas). However, the opposite is observed when the analysis is performed in relative terms. Thus, the RAF (determined for SZA cases below 80 °) increases from 1. 1 for cloud-free cases (0 oktas) to 1. 4 for completely overcast situations (8 oktas). This opposite behavior is also found when both RAF and OE are analyzed as functions of COD. Thus, while the OE strongly decreases with increasing COD, the RAF increases as COD increases...|$|E

Ozone levels in the tropical lower strat osphere remain constant until about 2053 and then collapse to near ze ro by 2058 as a result of heterogeneous chemical processes (as curren tly observed in the Antarctic ozone hole).

When VSL halogen sources are neglected, future UV ERY increases due to declines in ozone column are nearly balanced by reductions of UV ERY due to scattering by the higher stratospheric aerosol burden in mid-latitudes. Consideration of VSL sources at their upper limit tips the balance, resulting in annual average increases in UV ERY of up to 5 % in mid and high latitudes.

40|$|This {{case study}} {{examines}} {{the variability of}} ultraviolet <b>erythemal</b> <b>radiation</b> at two different but nearby locations in southwest Sweden. Data from two identical radiometers were analysed. One instrument sampled the urbanised environment of Göteborg (latitude: 57. 70 °N, longitude: 12. 00 °E), while the second one sampled a rural site, Koster Island (latitude: 58. 83 °N; longitude: 11. 00 °E), some 143 km to the north. Both radiometers were intercompared during the field season, and one radiometer had its calibration traced to a WMO:STUK intercomparison performed in 1995. Only cloudless data for the period 1 April 1996 – 30 September 1996 are examined in this study. Higher depletion was reported at Koster Island for the 4 days which were simultaneously cloudless at both sites. A cloudless model developed by Green et al. (Green, A. E. S., Cross, K. R. and Smith, L. A. 1980. Photochem. Photobiol., 31, 59 – 65.) {{was used to determine}} daily measured:model ratios for both sites. However there is some uncertainty in these ratios due to the spatial variability in total column ozone. Examining seasonal trends, much scatter is reported at both sites, although after day 226 (13 August 1996), distinctly lower ratios were reported at Koster Island. By examining pyranometer and relative humidity data at both sites, it is argued that coastal haze at Koster Island may explain the higher depletion there. © 1998 Royal Meteorological Society.

40|$|One of {{the more}} {{difficult}} tasks confronting atmospheric researchers today is the acquisition of long-term radiometric measurements that encapsulate variability in the sky hemisphere as well as time. High quality spatial measurements would allow for {{a greater understanding of}} atmospheric processes, both specific to the site and between locations. This information would lead to further development of better spatial models for predicting future trends. This study develops a timer-controlled variable sky-view platform (or VSP), designed to encapsulate both the spatial and temporal variation of radiation in the sky hemisphere for Hobart (42. 90 S; 147. 33 E). The VSP essentially allows for a sensor to move up and down inside a fixed cylinder, therefore causing the sky view factor to vary. It is currently in use with the erythemal ultraviolet (UV) biometer 501 -A manufactured by Solar Light Company Inc. (SLC). As such, the VSP provides an additional source of UV sky distribution data to the Hobart UV-climatology database. Before VSP deployment of the SLC instrument, it was first necessary to fully characterise its cosine response in an accurate calibration scheme. Here, calibration of the detector is dependent upon wavelength as well as solar zenith angle, due to the discrepancy between the actual instrument relative spectral response and the erythemal response curve. In this study, measurements were compared for the purpose of characterising a new cosine response function (CRF) for the broadband detector. Concurrent measurements of spectral and broadband erythemal UV data have been undertaken at the University of Tasmania in Hobart, Australia. Measurements spanned solar zenith angles (SZA) of 21 °- 74 °, total ozone values of 220 to 320 -DU and relatively small aerosol optical depths. The CRF is both wavelength and SZA dependent and applicable to all broadband UV-B instruments based on the original Robertson-Berger design. A methodology is presented for incorporation of the CRF into the calibration scheme. The concept of spectral multipliers is introduced, which are unique to each broadband instrument and correct for the wavelength dependence of the CRF. A method is then described for ongoing calibration of the detector based on model data alone. The scheme is then tested with real data to validate its reliability. Overall, by nature of the simultaneous characterisation of both spectral and cosine response, the CRF allowed for a more robust calibration for the VSP deployed sensor. A full description of the VSP design, electronics and construction is then given. Emphasis is on high precision long-term operation under all weather conditions. A modelling scheme and output results illustrate the advantages of the VSP over current sky observing instruments. It can accurately parameterise the direct and diffuse erythemal irradiance as well as the azimuthally-integrated erythemal sky radiance distribution for every two minutes duration (at the current setting). In addition, all data can be obtained for clear-sky and cloudy conditions. Analysis of the clear-sky VSP sky distribution, in conjunction with spectroradiometer radiance measurements, allows for derivation of the azimuthally-integrated circumsolar component for each zenith angle. The thesis concludes with an application of the VSP for the all-sky calibration of other radiometric instruments. Occulting disk or shadowband arrangements are often applied to both spectral and broadband sensors in order to retrieve the total diffuse irradiance. Here, extraction of the diffuse component is simply calculated as a difference between the measured global and direct components. However, difficulty lies in the application of a suitable diffuse calibration due to the instrument cosine response. Generally, the sky distribution is assumed isotropic during the correction, whereas it has been shown in most studies to be nearly always anisotropic. Hence, without in situ sky distribution measurements it is difficult to obtain the correct total diffuse measurement. This study utilises VSP-extracted erythemal sky distribution data. Results are used to correct for the cosine error of instruments that measure diffuse <b>erythemal</b> <b>radiation</b> data, for both clear-sky and cloudy conditions. A comparison was then made between corrected diffuse values resulting from application of an isotropic versus the real sky distribution.

The exposures to diffuse UV on a horizontal plane in the tree shade between 9 : 00 EST to 15 : 00 EST were of the order of 4 MED and 14 J cm- 2 for erythemal UV and UVA respectively. The high diffuse UV component in the shade may result in high UV exposures to not only parts of the body on a horizontal plane that are not protected, but also, equally high UV irradiances to parts of the body, including the eyes and face, that are not UV protected. 1...|$|R
40|$|Alterations to {{dendritic}} cell (DC) progenitors {{in the bone}} marrow (BM) may contribute to long-lasting systemic immunosuppression (> 28 d) following exposure of the skin of mice to <b>erythemal</b> UV <b>radiation</b> (UVR). DCs differentiated in vitro from the BM of mice 3 d after UVR (8 kJ/m 2) have a reduced capacity to initiate immunity (both skin and airways) when adoptively transferred into naive mice. Studies in IL- 10 −/− mice suggested that UV-induced IL- 10 was not significantly involved. To investigate the immune capabilities of peripheral tissue DCs generated in vivo from the BM of UV-irradiated mice, chimeric mice were established. Sixteen weeks after reconstitution, contact hypersensitivity responses were significantly reduced in mice reconstituted with BM from UV-irradiated mice (UV-chimeric). When the dorsal skin of UV-chimeric mice was challenged with innate inflammatory agents, the hypertrophy induced in the draining lymph nodes was minimal and significantly less than that measured in control-chimeric mice challenged with the same inflammatory agent. When DCs were differentiated from the BM of UV-chimeric mice using FLT 3 ligand or GM-CSF + IL- 4, the cells maintained a reduced priming ability. The diminished responses in UV-chimeric mice were not due to different numerical or proportional reconstitution of BM or the hematopoietic cells in blood, lymph nodes, and skin. Erythemal UVR may imprint a long-lasting epigenetic effect on DC progenitors in the BM and alter the function of their terminally differentiated progeny. Royce L. X. Ng, Naomi M. Scott, Deborah H.

40|$|International audienceThe aim of {{this study}} is the {{reconstruction}} of past UV-radiation doses for two stations in Austria, Hoher Sonnblick and Vienna, using a physical radiation transfer model. The method uses the modeled UV-radiation under clear-sky conditions, cloud modification factors and a correction factor as input variables. To identify the influence of temporal resolution of input data and modification factors, an ensemble of four different modelling approaches has been calculated, each with hourly or daily resolution. This is especially important because we found no other study describing the influence of the temporal resolution of input data on model performance. Following the results of the statistical analysis of the evaluation period the model with the highest temporal resolution has been chosen for the reconstruction of the UV-radiation doses. This model (HMC) uses modelled UV-radiation under clear sky conditions, a cloud modification factor, both with hourly resolution, and a monthly correction factor. A good agreement between modelled and measured values of erythemally effective irradiance was found at both stations. In relation to the reference period 1976 ? 1985 an increase in erythemal UV-irradiance in Vienna of 11 percent is visible in the period 1986 ? 1995 and an increase of 17 percent in the period 1996 ? 2005 can be seen. At Hoher Sonnblick an increase of 2 percent has been calculated for the yearly averages in erythemal UV for the period 1986 ? 1995 and an increase of 9 percent for the period 1996 ? 2005 in comparison to the reference period. For the different seasons the strongest increase in <b>erythemal</b> UV <b>radiation</b> has been found for winter and spring season at both stations...|$|R
40|$|Background: Monthly {{variation}} in multiple sclerosis (MS) relapses has been found. The relationship between seasonal environmental factors, infections, serum vitamin D [25 (OH) D] and MS relapses is undetermined. Methods: We prospectively followed a population-based cohort of relapsing-remitting (RR) MS patients in Southern Tasmania for a mean 2. 3 years (January 2002 -April 2005). Associations between monthly ambient environmental factors, estimated serum 25 (OH) D, {{upper respiratory tract}} (URT) infections and relapse rates were examined using weighted Pearson's correlation and linear regression. Results: Of 199 definite MS patients, 142 had RRMS. The lowest relapse rate of 0. 5 per 1, 000 days (95 % CI: 0. 2 - 1. 3) occurred in February (mid-late summer) versus the March-January RR of 1. 1 per 1, 000 days (95 % CI: 0. 9 - 1. 3; p = 0. 018, weighted regression). Monthly relapse rates correlated with: (1) prior <b>erythemal</b> ultraviolet <b>radiation</b> (EUV) : lagged 1. 5 months, r = - 0. 32, p = 0. 046; (2) URT infection rate: no lag, r = 0. 39, p = 0. 014; (3) 25 (OH) D: no lag, r = - 0. 31, p = 0. 057. The association between URT infections and relapses was reduced after adjustment for monthly EUV. Conclusions: Relapse rates were inversely associated with EUV and serum 25 (OH) D levels and positively associated with URT infections. The demonstrated lag between EUV but not 25 (OH) D and relapse rates {{is consistent with a}} role for EUV-generated 25 (OH) D in the alteration of relapse rates. Future work on the association between URT infections and relapses should be considered in the context of ultraviolet radiation and vitamin D...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. Time {{series of}} daily <b>erythemal</b> {{ultraviolet}} <b>radiation</b> (UVR) exposure, ozone, and cloud cover were analyzed over the Australian continent using data sets from the NASA Total Ozone Mapping Spectrometer (TOMS) from 1979 - 1992. The TOMS UVR exposures showed good agreement {{with data from}} surface observations. Using a relationship derived from comparisons of the TOMS partial cloud refiectivities with surface cloud cover observations, the TOMS refiectivities were converted into estimates of cloud cover for several Australian regions. It was shown that the deseasonalized time series of UVR exposures can be statistically described as a linear function of ozone and cloud cover anomalies. Results of a trend analysis indicated statistically significant increases in UVR exposures of 10 % decade- • in the summer months in the tropics. These were associated with a simultaneous depletion of ozone {{and a decrease in}} cloud cover. Midlatitudinal regions showed no significant trends of UVR. It was found that variations of ozone and UVR over Australia were significantly influenced by the quasi-biennial oscillation (QBO). An increase in zonal wind strength of 20 m s- 1 was correlative with reductions of ozone of 1. 7 % and enhancements of UVR exposures of 2. 2 %. An increase in solar radio flux of 100 x 10 - 22 W m- 2 (Hz) - 1 was associated with significant reductions of UVR of 5 - 10 % in the tropical and subtropical regions in summer. The results suggested that enhancements in summer UVR exposures of about 10 - 20 % above the climatological average might be expected in years in which the QBO is in its westerly phase and the solar cycle is at its minimum. 1...|$|R
40|$|Ozone {{depletion}} {{has been}} a well-researched phenomenon since its discovery in the early 1980 s. It is now scientifically accepted that if all other factors (cloudiness, turbidity, surface albedo, etc.) remain the same, decreases in stratospheric ozone concentrations provoke an increase in ultraviolet B (UVB) radiation (in the wavelength range 280 - 325 nm) at the Earth’s surface. Experimental evidence also shows that exposure to UVB radiation can decrease algal productivity, and cause damage to various forms of aquatic larvae and other organisms. Biologically-effective levels of solar UV radiation penetrate water columns well, especially in the clear waters found in the Antarctic pack ice zone. To determine the relationship (if any) between increased biologically-weighted UV doses and damage to various Antarctic organisms, scientists {{need to know the}} magnitude of these increases, not only at the surface but throughout the ice and the water column. This research initially produced surface maps of levels of cloudy-sky erythemal UV, derived from satellite data, for the East Antarctic marginal ice zone (split into four regions for ease of presentation) for the years 1996 - 2005. Case studies of the relationships between levels of cloudy-sky erythemal UV (at the surface of the sea ice and ocean) and ozone, sea ice concentration and the cloud modification factor are presented by way of various analyses for a selection of sub-areas within the four regions. These analyses show that the levels of erythemal UV in the sub-areas are strongly affected by levels of ozone and by sea ice concentration. The results also indicate that the Shackleton and Amery regions are more affected by lower levels of ozone associated with the Antarctic ozone hole than the Mertz and Dalton regions. Trend analyses for the nine-year study period indicated significant trends for erythemal UV, sea ice concentration and ozone for some of the selected sub-areas. The austral spring of 2001 stood out as a period of unusually high erythemal UV values. To create maps of cloudy-sky <b>erythemal</b> UV <b>radiation,</b> the radiative transfer model UVSPEC was employed to develop a look-up table (LUT) of levels of <b>erythemal</b> UV <b>radiation</b> for various combinations of ozone, solar zenith angle and surface UV albedo. IDL software was then written to estimate a value of clear-sky erythemal UV at the Earth’s surface, using the erythemal UV LUT, for each 5 x 5 km pixel of an Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer (AVHRR) Polar Pathfinder image for each day that AVHRR irradiance and TOMS ozone data were available for the temporal coverage of the project. The main confounding issue in the determination of <b>erythemal</b> UV <b>radiation</b> at the Earth’s surface is the cloud cover, as this can vary not just on a daily basis but also throughout a day. The amount of cloud in a pixel was taken into account by multiplying clear-sky erythemal UV by a cloud modification factor based on the classification of AVHRR images using an expert system. A subsequent undertaking used the ASPeCt sea ice and snow thickness dataset to produce maps of erythemal UV values at predetermined depths within the sea ice and the water column. Field work completed during the SIPEX voyage to the East Antarctic sea ice zone in 2007 allowed the estimation of UVB attenuation coefficients for ice and snow – these values were used, along with a known UVB attenuation coefficient for water, when determining sub-surface erythemal UV values. Initially, the erythemal UV values were calculated at 5, 10, 15 and 20 m in the water column. To take into consideration the fact that phytoplankton do not necessarily remain at a specific depth, average erythemal UV values over the upper 5, 10, 15 and 20 m of the water column were also calculated. Erythemal UV values {{at the top of the}} sea ice (beneath the snow cover), mid-way through the ice, at the bottom of the ice and at a fixed depth of 20 cm within the ice were calculated specifically for sea ice algae research. The erythemal UV values at the bottom of the ice were used to further calculate erythemal UV in the water column at the re-established depths beneath the ice (taking into account the draft of the sea ice). The sea ice concentration was incorporated into the calculations to determine pixel-averaged values of erythemal UV at 5, 10, 15 and 20 m depth. A final step was to use spectral biological weighting functions to develop a set of non-linear conversions between erythemal UV dose rate and more biologically-relevant dose rates. Including these aspects in the model allowed the erythemal UV values in the water column to be converted to a phytoplankton-specific dose rate, and the estimated erythemal UV values within a slab of sea ice to be converted to a sea-ice-algae-specific dose rate. The logistical problems of undertaking in situ research in Antarctica require alternative methods such as satellite remote sensing and radiative transfer modelling. This project has used satellite data and a radiative transfer model (RTM) to create maps of erythemal UV values for the study area. Further research will be required to assess (either from in situ measurements of primary production or with the use of remote sensing of ocean colour) how significant the effects of increased levels of erythemal UV are on the primary production of the Southern Ocean...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. Maps of {{the solar}} <b>erythemal</b> {{ultraviolet}} (UV) <b>radiation</b> daily doses were created for every month with horizontal resolution of 500 m at geographical domain 47. 15 N – 49. 86 N x 16. 94 E – 22. 81 E covering the territory of Slovakia. Cloud modification factor (cmf) for the UV radiation was modeled utilizing relation between the cmf of total and UV radiation for 6 solar zenith angle (SZA) categories. Clear-sky UV and total radiation daily doses were calculated using radiative-transfer models. Measurements of total ozone performed by Brewer spectrophotometer at Poprad-Ganovce (inside the investigated domain) were considered representative for selected geographical area. Information on snow cover presence was the only meteorological parameter used in the model. Verification of the model was performed at 5 observatories equipped with broadband solar UV radiometers. The maps of the cmf factor for the UV radiation were created utilizing measurements of total solar radiation performed at 7 observatories and the model of monthly cmf dependence on altitude. Maps of clear-sky UV radiation daily dose and UV radiation daily dose affected by average cloudiness were created for average monthly total ozone value, its upper and lower monthly limits and for 1 day representing typical values of every month...|$|R
40|$|The {{penetration}} of solar <b>erythemal</b> ultraviolet (UV) <b>radiation</b> has been {{measured in the}} shade of a gum (Eucalyptus sp.) and a she oak (Casaurina) tree, both on a horizontal plane and with polysulphone dosimeters to human anatomical sites. This has provided new data useful for protection strategies against harmful UV radiation. For larger solar zenith angles, the relative {{penetration of}} solar erythemal UV {{in the shade of}} the trees is higher. On a horizontal plane, at noon, in winter, the shade erythemal UV ranged from 44 to 55 % of that in the sun whereas in spring it ranged from 29 to 37 % of the irradiances in the sun. Similarly, at 9 : 00 EST and 15 : 00 EST, the shade erythemal UV in winter ranged from 51 to 81 % of the irradiances in the sun whereas in spring and summer they ranged from 35 to 51 % of the unshaded irradiances. The shade ratios for specific body sites provided by the shade of the two trees was 0. 05 to 0. 45 for the solar zenith angles in this research. The shade ratios ranged from 0. 14 to 0. 45 for the gum tree and from 0. 05 to 0. 28 for the she oak. The denser foliage of the she oak provided the higher UV protection compared to that of the gum tree...|$|R
