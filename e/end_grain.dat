5|$|Stars is a wood {{engraving}} print; that is, it {{was produced by}} carving the artwork into the <b>end</b> <b>grain</b> of a block of wood (unlike a woodcut which uses the side grain), and then using this block to print the image. It was created by Escher in October 1948. Although most published copies of Stars are monochromatic, with white artwork against a black background, the copy in the National Gallery of Canada is tinted in different shades of turquoise, yellow, green, and pale pink.|$|E
5|$|The {{draft was}} then {{transferred}} by pencil on white-primed panels of hardwood <b>end</b> <b>grain.</b> Not {{only was it}} hard work, but {{the quality of the}} printing block was crucial. Everything left white on the block, around Busch's drawn lines, was cut from the plate by skilled engravers. Wood engraving allows a finer differentiation than woodcut and the potential tonal values are of almost the quality of intaglio printing, such as copper engraving. Sometimes the result was not satisfactory, leading Busch to rework or reproduce plates. The wood engraving technique did not allow for fine lines, which is why Busch's drawing, especially in his illustrated tales up to the mid-1870s, are boldly drawn, giving his work its particular characteristic.|$|E

Environmental effects on grain specific weight, protein content, Hagberg Falling Number, SDS-sedimentation volume, and sulphur content were also studied. Drought and increased temperature applied before the <b>end</b> of <b>grain</b> filling shortened the grain filling period and reduced grain yield, mean grain weight and specific weight. Grain filling was most severely affected by drought between days 1 - 14 after anthesis. Protein content was increased by stresses before the <b>end</b> of <b>grain</b> growth, because nitrogen harvest index was less severely affected than was dry matter harvest index. Hagberg Falling Number was increased to the greatest extent by stresses applied 15 - 28 days after anthesis. Treatment effects on grain sulphur content were similar to those on protein content, such that N:S ratio was not significantly affected by drought nor temperature stresses. The effects of restricted water on grain yield and quality were linearly related to soil moisture between 44 and about 73 % field capacity (FC) from days 15 - 28. Drought stress (but not temperature stress) before the <b>end</b> of <b>grain</b> filling decreased SDS-sedimentation volume relative to drought applied later. (C) 2003 Elsevier Science Ltd.

30|$|The {{distributions}} of boron in Japanese cedar (Cryptomeria japonica D. Don) sapwood blocks treated with aqueous or methanolic boric acid [B(OH) 3] solutions were explored through Raman spectroscopy and prompt gamma-ray analysis (PGA). B(OH) 3 {{was the sole}} boron species observed in Raman spectra of the wood blocks treated with either solution. Plots of weight gain of the treated wood blocks versus boron concentration in treatment solutions {{were found to be}} linear. The results indicated that the methanolic solution makes it possible to impregnate wood with much larger amounts of boron than the aqueous solution. PGA confirmed that B(OH) 3 was highly enriched near the <b>end</b> <b>grains</b> of the treated wood blocks. Raman measurements suggested that boron content in the bulk of the wood block is not as large as expected from the weight gain of the treated wood blocks when an ordinary air-drying method is used. It was concluded that the aqueous solution impregnates the cell walls of wood with boron more easily than the methanolic solution.|$|R
25|$|The {{deterioration}} of wood occurred at typically vulnerable areas, {{such as the}} exposed <b>end</b> <b>grain</b> of arches and muntins and where wood members intersect. The humidity in the building was a contributing factor to wood deterioration. The level of moisture in the building was exacerbated by two conditions. First, the buildingâ€™s natural ventilation system had been removed in a past repair. The ventilators, which were originally located in the low wall area, had been filled in, and some ridge ventilators were inoperable. The air flow through the ventilators, which would have assisted in the evaporation of water, was not occurring. Second, the penetration of rain water from {{the exterior of the}} building, because of inadequate or deteriorated waterproofing, had increased the level of moisture in the wood. The copper sheathing that had originally capped the arch exteriors, in addition to acting as a moisture barrier, may have been acting as a biocide through copper oxides inhibiting wood rot.|$|E
25|$|The {{construction}} of each arch is aesthetically appealing in its simplicity, but also structurally clever {{in that it}} takes maximum advantage of wood as a building material while overcoming its inherent structural shortcomings. From a structural perspective, the arch design utilizes the mechanical properties of the material. Wood is strongest {{along the length of}} the grain and weakest along the <b>end</b> <b>grain.</b> The use of short arch components with shallow radii minimized the amount of weaker-end grain exposed to structural forces. The assembly of the arch with several small pieces of wood, the shapes of which are identical from arch to arch, was efficient. It allowed the fabricator to set machines with guides and templates so that cutting the multiple-arch components was a simple task. Furthermore, the design required little material, since each individual arch component has only a shallow radius. Moreover, by using relatively narrow widths of lumber, the chance of warping was minimized. Finally, there was an efficiency realized in transportation, as the small size of the arch components allowed them to be easily stored and shipped.|$|E
2500|$|Planing the <b>end</b> <b>grain</b> of {{the board}} {{involves}} different techniques, and frequently different planes designed for working <b>end</b> <b>grain.</b> Block planes and other bevel-up planes are often effective in planing the difficult nature of <b>end</b> <b>grain.</b> These planes are usually designed to use an iron bedded at a [...] "low angle," [...] typically about 12 degrees.|$|E

40|$|The grain chinch bug, Macchiademus diplopterus (Distant) (Hemiptera: Lygaeidae), is a pest {{of export}} fruit from South Africa of {{quarantine}} concern. During summer adult M. diplopterus move from their host plants, usually wheat, to find shelter for aestivation, and may settle on fruit, sheltering at the stalk and calyx <b>ends.</b> <b>Grain</b> chinch bugs are endemic to the Western Cape region of South Africa, but their distribution and abundance in the fruit-growing areas {{of this region}} are not known. A survey was conducted {{over a period of}} three years (2004 - 2007) to determine if any particular fruit-growing area or fruit type is more prone to grain chinch bug infestation. Data on the type of vegetation surrounding the sites used in the survey, and climatic data of each area were analysed to determine which factors influence M. diplopterus abundance. No particular fruit type was found to be more prone to infestation. Areas with high numbers of M. diplopterus (Ceres, Porterville and Piketberg) had significantly lower average monthly relative humidities and minimum temperatures than areas with low numbers. Surrounding wheat fields and close proximity of wheat fields to orchards also contribute to higher numbers of grain chinch bug in the orchards. In the absence of methods to control grain chinch bug in orchards or on deciduous fruit, producers in areas with high numbers are more likely to experience problems with rejections of consignments presented for export. Research is required to develop methods to control M. diplopterus. Revie...|$|R

50|$|However, it {{can also}} be {{interpreted}} that the monazite grew along the foliation of other minerals long after the shearing.
