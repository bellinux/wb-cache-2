5|$|Every spring, the Institute holds a ceremony, {{known as}} When the Whistle Blows, to honor students, staff, and <b>faculty</b> <b>who</b> {{died during the}} {{previous}} year. The Georgia Tech Whistle is blown once for each person who died, and once more to salute Georgia Tech alumni and friends who may also have died. A procession of the military escort, led by the Ramblin' Wreck, leads up to the ceremony, during which the Wreck is parked next to the speaker's stage.|$|E

RSMAS also administrates the University of Miami's undergraduate Marine Science, Marine Affairs, and Meteorology programs on the main campus in Coral Gables, Florida.|$|E
5|$|Oppenheimer brought {{together}} intellectuals {{at the height}} of their powers and from a variety of disciplines to answer the most pertinent questions of the age. He directed and encouraged the research of many well-known scientists, including Freeman Dyson, and the duo of Chen Ning Yang and Tsung-Dao Lee, who won a Nobel Prize for their discovery of parity non-conservation. He also instituted temporary memberships for scholars from the humanities, such as T. S. Eliot and George F. Kennan. Some of these activities were resented by a few members of the mathematics <b>faculty,</b> <b>who</b> wanted the institute to stay a bastion of pure scientific research. Abraham Pais said that Oppenheimer himself thought that one of his failures at the institute was being unable to bring together scholars from the natural sciences and the humanities.|$|E
40|$|Abstractâ€”The {{purpose of}} this {{research}} is the analysis of the impact of ICT-related training in the adoption of a learning management systems (LMS) for teaching practicesby faculties in a higher education institution. Based on comparative analyses the impact will be obtained by the number of LMS courses created and managed by participants in ICT for teaching workshops and those who have not attended to any workshops. Involving near 1320 LMS courses and 265 faculties, the results evidence that(i) <b>faculties</b> <b>who</b> have not attend any workshop present a larger distribution of empty courses and (ii) <b>faculties</b> <b>who</b> have attended three or more workshops managed a higher distribution of courses with a considerable level of use intensity, when compared to the others groups. These findings supportthe idea that faculty training is a crucial factor in the process of LMS integration in higher education institutions and that <b>faculties</b> <b>who</b> have been enrolled in three or more workshops develop a higher level of technical and pedagogical proficiency in LMS...|$|R

5|$|The X-Files series {{centers on}} FBI special agents Fox Mulder (David Duchovny) and Dana Scully (Gillian Anderson) {{who work on}} cases linked to the paranormal, called X-Files. In this episode Mulder and Scully are called to Milford Falls, New Hampshire to {{investigate}} {{the death of a}} teenager who seems to have died during an occult ritual of some sort. As a result of their arrival in town a few of the local high school's <b>faculty,</b> <b>who</b> had self-stylized as devil-worshipers when they were teens but long ago stopped worshiping the devil, decide they should take steps to conceal their past activities. Matters are further complicated when the devil seems to have decided to personally interfere.|$|E
5|$|The locals saw Meiklejohn as an outsider. He was {{foreign to}} Madison in his politics, social life, and personality. Dean Sellery and President Frank's {{professional}} relationship was untrusting and contemptuous, which extended to Meiklejohn {{due to his}} close association with Frank. Sellery {{had the support of}} the <b>faculty,</b> <b>who</b> were envious of the Experimental College advisers' arrangements for higher salaries. In objection to the college's reputation for radicalism, the son of the man who endowed Meiklejohn's professorship revoked his funding. Frank needed the donor's support, and so the incident marked Frank's waning support for the college. Sellery spoke out against the Experimental College {{in the first quarter of}} 1929, and Frank attempted to fire him in response. In 1931, Sellery received letters from spies who found Meiklejohn's son Donald, a philosophy doctoral student at the university and a part-time Experimental College adviser, engaged in sex acts against university policy. Sellery pursued expulsion and denied Meiklejohn and his son's separate requests for a lesser punishment. A week later, Meiklejohn asked the advisers to close the college.|$|E
5|$|There {{were two}} {{separate}} efforts {{to establish a}} Naval Academy football team in 1879. The first was guided by first-classman J.H. Robinson, who developed it as a training regiment {{to help keep the}} school's baseball team in shape. The team played the sport under rules that made it much closer to soccer, where the players were permitted only to kick the ball in order to advance it. The second effort, headed by first-classman William John Maxwell was more successful in its efforts. Maxwell met with two of his friends, Tunstall Smith and Henry Woods, who played for the Baltimore Athletic Club and officially challenged their team to a game with the Naval Academy. A team was formed from academy first-classmen, which Maxwell led as a manager, trainer, and captain. The team would wake up and practice before reveille and following drill and meals. The squad received encouragement from some of the <b>faculty,</b> <b>who</b> allowed them to eat a late dinner and skip final drill for additional practicing. This was against the direct orders of the school superintendent, who had banned football and similar activities.|$|E

Also, a <b>faculty</b> member <b>who</b> teaches a supporting course for graduate students is both a teacher and a researcher.|$|R
