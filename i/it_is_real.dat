5|$|After rescuing the Queen, Flik deploys the bird; it {{initially}} fools the grasshoppers, but P.T. Flea, also mistaking {{it for a}} real bird, burns it, exposing it as a decoy. Hopper beats Flik {{in retaliation}} and says that the ants are humble and lowly life forms who live to serve the grasshoppers. However, Flik responds that Hopper actually fears the colony, because he has always known what they are capable of, inspiring the ants and the Circus Bugs to fight back against the grasshoppers. The ants attempt to force Hopper out of Ant Island, but it suddenly begins to rain. In the ensuing chaos, Hopper kidnaps Flik and flees. After the Circus Bugs fail to catch them, Atta rescues Flik. As Hopper pursues them, Flik lures him to the nest of the bird he, Dot, and the Circus Bugs encountered earlier. Thinking that the bird is another decoy, Hopper taunts it before discovering <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>real,</b> and is captured and fed to its chicks.|$|E
5|$|Chris sets up {{a camera}} in his room to capture the creature. When he reviews the tape he finds no {{evidence}} of the Evil Monkey, and goes ahead with his plans on capturing him. The family is taken aback when Chris proves <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>real</b> by capturing the monkey, and showing it to them, but he turns {{out not to be}} evil after all. The monkey then explains himself to the Griffins for being here. He reveals that he got home from work one day and caught his wife cheating on him with another monkey. He went through a deep depression after the divorce, which costed him his job, and all his money was gone, meaning that he lost his house, so he moved into Chris's closet just until he finally got back on his feet, and has lived there for 9 years. He also reveals that the face he makes at Chris was what he makes when thinking, and he was really trying to talk with Chris this whole time (pointing at him was his only way of trying to start a conversation with him). In addition, the trembling was due to a copper deficiency. The monkey apologizes to Chris for unintentionally terrorizing him and wishes to start over. Chris is at first unconvinced, but when the monkey helps him write a book report, he is surprised to receive a passing grade, and the two become great friends.|$|E

25|$|Fish {{are caught}} by jigging. The hunter cuts a square {{hole in the}} ice on the lake and fishes using a fish lure and spear.

500|$|Vermeer {{channels}} Griet's sexual awakening {{into his}} painting, with the piercing of {{her ear and}} his directives to her posing being inherently sexual. In the opinion of psychologist Rosemary Rizq, the pearl Griet dons is a metaphor, something which normally would convey wealth and status. But, when worn by Griet the pearl is also a directive to the audience {{to look at the}} [...] "... psychological potential within ..."

500|$|In post-structural {{literary}} theory Cayce is {{compared with the}} main character, Oedipa Maas, of Thomas Pynchon's The Crying of Lot 49 as detectives interpreting clues but with neither the character nor the reader knowing if there actually is a pattern to be found and, if there is one, whether <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>real</b> or [...] conspiracy. Gibson's use of name-dropping brands {{to create a sense}} of [...] "in-group style … of those in the know" [...] is traced back to Thomas Pynchon's 1963 novel V.. Gibson's writing style is said to be similar to Raymond Chandler's detective stories and Alfred Hitchcock's thrillers that used MacGuffins (the identity of the maker of the footage, in this case) to drive the story. Gibson's social observations are influenced by the works of Naomi Klein and Malcolm Gladwell.|$|E

[...] The other children, and Mewt's father Cid, slowly realize through Marche's efforts that the world has been shaped according to their wishes. Mewt is no longer being teased, is reunited with his deceased mother, and is now the Prince of Ivalice; Ritz no longer has her white albinic hair, instead having the silky red hair which she always wanted; Doned can now walk and is no longer sickly; Marche is suddenly athletic and popular; Cid is the highest-ranking official in the nation; and all of them now live in Final Fantasy, the video game the children all love.|$|E

[...] Asked about the 1983 reveal of the Visitors' reptilian appearance beneath their human disguise, Peters noted of the reimagining: [...] "We tried to put our own [...] We're ... a little bit different than their execution of it.

2500|$|Ich‑Du ("I‑Thou" [...] or [...] "I‑You") is a {{relationship}} that stresses the mutual, holistic existence of two beings. It is a concrete encounter, because these beings meet one another in their authentic existence, without any qualification or objectification of one another. Even imagination and ideas do not {{play a role in}} this relation. In an I–Thou encounter, infinity and universality are made actual (rather than being merely concepts). Buber stressed that an Ich‑Du relationship lacks any composition (e. g., structure) and communicates no content (e. g., information). Despite the fact that Ich‑Du cannot be proven to happen as an event (e. g., it cannot be measured), Buber stressed that <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>real</b> and perceivable. A variety of examples are used to illustrate Ich‑Du relationships in daily life—two lovers, an observer and a cat, the author and a tree, and two strangers on a train. Common English words used to describe the Ich‑Du relationship include encounter, meeting, dialogue, mutuality, and exchange.|$|E
2500|$|Apprehensive at first, {{the son is}} {{eventually}} cajoled into doing the deed.

A pleased magician presents the gigantic peach to the mandarins, who are unable to determine whether <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>real</b> or fake. Suddenly, the rope goes limp and falls back to the ground. Shortly afterwards, his son's head follows suit. The conjurer proclaims that his son has been punished for stealing heavenly peaches, {{and the rest of his}} son's dismembered body comes hurtling down. The magician emotionally stores all of his son's body parts into a bamboo chest, and begs the officials for some money to defray funeral costs. After the shocked mandarins make the payment, the magician taps on the chest, and his son emerges, all in one piece. Pu notes that members of the White Lotus Sect were adept at such tricks and speculates that the father and son may have been members of the secret society.|$|E
2500|$|John Molyneux {{explains}} {{in his article}} Emin Matters, that her work revolves around class, sex and art itself. He writes that, [...] "What she does do is present herself as culturally working class…She makes no attempt to engage in 'intellectual art speak' but sticks to unaffected everyday language," [...] employing a strategy that doesn't place her in authority over her viewers or peers. However, her class background contradicts this tactic of equal understanding. Emin's mother until age seven owned a hotel in Margate, but bankruptcy and poverty ensued only when she broke up with Emin's father. While she may use street language, swear words, grammatical errors and misspellings to convey a primarily middle-class female experience, Emin now functions as a boss of her own art business and exists within the elite upper class. Her relationship with sex is a major theme and aspect of her work. Feminist writers have reviewed Emin's pieces as containing, [...] "…no element of eroticism or titillation…unlike in Botticelli, Renoir or Klimt. Nor is it sexual fantasy or dreams, as we might find in surrealism, or {{the sex of the}} brothel featured so heavily in late 19th-century French art. <b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>real,</b> everyday sex—as experienced by her, of course, but also by millions of other people".|$|E
