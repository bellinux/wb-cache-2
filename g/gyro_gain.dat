50|$|RC {{helicopters}} generally require between 3 and 6 {{channels for}} control (although micro helicopters that utilize a 2-channel infrared control system also exist). Small fixed-pitch helicopters use a 4-channel radio (throttle, elevator, aileron, rudder); while collective-pitch models need {{a minimum of}} 5 channels (throttle, collective pitch, elevator, aileron, and rudder). 6th channel is often used for <b>gyro</b> <b>gain.</b> Because of the normal interaction of the various control mechanisms, advanced radios include adjustable mixing functions, such as throttle/collective and throttle/rudder. Radio prices vary from $50-$3,000 USD.|$|E

40|$|Fiber-optics {{gyroscopes}} (<b>gyros)</b> are <b>gaining</b> {{importance as}} a means for improving dead-reckoning accuracy in mobile robots. In the past, the relatively high drift rate of moderately priced gyros presented the foremost technical limitation of these devices. More recently, fiber-optics gyros with very low drift rates have become available and affordable. Because of their low drift rate attention is warranted to sources of errors that were previously considered as of secondary importance. In the KVH E-Core RD 2100 gyros that were examined at our lab we found that the non-linearity of the scale-factor and temperature dependency caused significant errors. A calibration method, described in this paper, reduces the resulting errors by one order of magnitude. 1. INTRODUCTION Dead-reckoning is widely used in mobile robot navigation because the method is self-contained and always capable of providing the robot with an estimate of its position. Odometry is the most frequently used component in a [...] ...|$|R
40|$|The Hubble Space Telescope (HST) was {{designed}} to maintian a pointing stability (jitter) of 0. 007 arc seconds rms throughout every observing period, which can last from {{a few seconds to}} several orbits. On-orbit measurements indicate that the hardware excitation induced by the reaction wheels. <b>gyros,</b> high <b>gain</b> antennae, science instrument mechanisms and tape recorders are well within specifications. Unexpectedly, the solar arrays because the dominant source of jitter. Every passage through an orbital terminator produces vibrations which emanate from the solar arrays due to thermal effects, which affect the relative positional stability. Broadband frequencies centered about 0. 11 and 0. 65 Hz were detected in the frequency content of the vehicle jitter. On-board modifications to the control law have attenuated the disturbance torques and reduced the vehicle jitter close to specification. Replacement of the solar arrays in December, 1993, should eliminate the torque distubances. Astrometric science observations are extremely susceptible to corruption from vehicle jitter. The removal of vehicle jitter from astrometric Transfer function scans of binary stars is explained in detail. A binary star separation of 16 milli-seconds of arc has been achieved, a separation resolution of 10 to 12 milli-seconds of arc appears feasible, with a binary star magnitude of 9 m(sub V). The achievement of this resolution is in part due to vehicle jitter removal. Comparison of vehicle jitter measurements from the position path of the vehicle control law, or from the guiding Fine Guidance Sensors (FGS), are shown to be equivalent to approximately 0. 001 arc second...|$|R
