These are not so much owners as distributers of books, and they mitigate the difficulty of dearness by subdividing the cost, and then selling such copies as are still in decent condition at a large reduction.

40|$|A {{review of}} the temperature, thermal {{conductivity}} and heat flow data of the Malay Basin {{has been carried out}} by analysing data from fifty nine exploration wells. The thermal conductivity of each well have been determined from logs which has been calibrated to measured thermal conductivity of cores. The formation temperature of the well at logging depth has been estimated by Horner plot by using a new model for derivation of <b>effective</b> <b>circulation</b> time. The <b>effective</b> <b>circulation</b> time has been approximated empirically from the well log data. Revised heat flow, geothermal gradient and thermal conductivity maps of the Malay Basin have been constructed from the new data. A vertical thermal profile of the basin has been analysed. The heat flow anomalies have been observed from the a real as well as vertical profiles of heat flow. The Malay Basin is found to have an average heat flow of 86 mWm(^ 2 -) The average geothermal gradient is 47 ºC/km. Both the heat flow and geothermal gradient are high. The heat flow varies over the basin, with regional highs in the Northwest, South and Central portions and a lower heat flow in the Southeastern part and Northeast peripherals. The anomalous heat flow is found {{to be related to the}} subsurface fluid movement and the overpressures. The temperature is not related to the top of onset of overpressures directly, however the various mechanisms of overpressuring can be speculated from the regional distribution of the temperatures at tops of the overpressures. Thermal maturity modelling has been carried out for selected wells. It was found that the basin thermal history can be matched to a rifted basin thermal model...|$|E

30|$|In most {{high-pressure}} high-temperature (HPHT) and deepwater wells, {{the margin}} between the formation pore {{pressure and the}} formation fracture pressure is narrow. This requires an accurate determination of the <b>effective</b> <b>circulation</b> density acting {{on the bottom of}} the hole to avoid any problems such as lost circulation, fracturing formation, and gas kicks and well blowout. In these critical operations, the ECD is used to control the formation pressure and prevent kicks without fracturing the drilled formations. When the mud pumps are switched off, the reduction of ECD may result in underbalanced conditions which require good knowledge of the ECD to avoid any drilling problems. At the same time, it is not possible to increase the mud weight due to fracture pressure limitations. Continuous circulating system (CCS) tools are used to control the ECD and allow better control of the formation pressure (Baranthol et al. 1995; Ataga et al. 2012).|$|E

40|$|In {{this thesis}} I explore the {{definition}} of cultural identity as 'representation', that identities don't exist as forms of fixed, absolute, and/or natural essence; instead, they are merely conceptual constructs, definitions of culture and cultural difference, produced in accordance with evolving historical situations and political intentions. I therefore examine a body of texts that constitutes representation of identity, in a specific historical [...] namely, 'diaspora' [...] context: the four novels published by Ying Chen, and the various critical and artistic responses inspired by these novels in Quebec. I argue that Chen's literary representations of identity are primarily characterized by a progressive conceptual trajectory towards anti-essentialist definitions. Meanwhile, the various secondary texts tend to re-inscribe the author and her works according to the metaphors of 'Chinese writer' and 'immigrant writer'. In the process, they inhibit key articulations in Chen's works from <b>effective</b> <b>circulation</b> in the Quebecois cultural milieu. These circumstances, I argue, reflect the confrontation of two historically distinct and opposing discourses of identity, and indicate a broader historical struggle for power in the social realm...|$|E

40|$|A best {{evidence}} topic was written {{according to a}} structured protocol {{to determine whether there}} is evidence that cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) by compressing the chest is safe and effective in patients with left ventricular assist devices (LVADs). Manufacturers warn of a possible risk of device dislodgement if the chest is compressed. AMED, EMBASE, MEDLINE, BNI and CINAHL were searched from inception to March 2014. Animal studies, case reports, case series, case–control studies, randomized controlled studies and systematic reviews were eligible for inclusion. Opinion articles with no reference to data were excluded. Of 45 unique results, 3 articles merited inclusion. A total of 10 patients with LVADs received chest compression during resuscitation. There was no report of device dislodgement as judged by postarrest flow rate, autopsy and resumption of <b>effective</b> <b>circulation</b> and/or neurological function. The longest duration of chest compression was 150 min. However, there are no comparisons of the efficacy of chest compressions relative to alternative means of external CPR, such as abdominal-only compressions. The absence of high-quality data precludes definitive recommendation of any particular form of CPR, in patients with LVADs. However, data identified suggest that chest compression is not as unsafe as previously thought. The efficacy of chest compressions in this patient population has not yet been investigated. Further research is required to address both the safety and efficacy of chest compressions in this population.
