5|$|By {{the end of}} 1835, Texians had {{expelled}} all Mexican {{troops from}} Texas. Believing the war ended, many Texians resigned from the army and returned home. In January, the provisional government essentially collapsed; <b>despite</b> <b>a</b> <b>lack</b> <b>of</b> authority for any branch of government to interfere with other branches, the legislature impeached Governor Henry Smith, who in turn disbanded the legislature. No one in Texas was entirely sure who was in charge.|$|E
5|$|<b>Despite</b> <b>a</b> <b>lack</b> <b>of</b> {{official}} {{support for a}} national team and women's football in general, women have self-organised their own teams and play games out of the sight of men. Created in 2006, King's United women football club was the first women's football club in the country. No official data is kept regarding participation rates for women football players.|$|E
5|$|<b>Despite</b> <b>a</b> <b>lack</b> <b>of</b> advertising, {{the game}} was a sleeper hit and a {{commercial}} and critical success. Sierra developed and published a remake that used the Sierra's Creative Interpreter (SCI) engine with 256 colors and a point-and-click, icon-driven (as opposed to text-based) user interface, released for the PC DOS, Apple Macintosh, and Amiga in 1991. A second, high-definition remake, titled , was developed by N-Fusion Interactive working with series' creator Al Lowe and published by Replay Games in 2013.|$|E

5|$|Despite injury troubles, Totti {{recovered}} {{in time to}} join the national team for their victorious 2006 World Cup campaign, <b>despite</b> <b>a</b> <b>lack</b> <b>of</b> match practice during his three months on the sidelines. Italy manager Marcello Lippi showed enormous faith in Totti, assuring him during his rehabilitation that his spot in Italy's World Cup squad was secure and to focus on recuperating. This encouragement and show of faith fueled Totti's desire to work even harder to overcome {{what could have been}} a career-ending injury and make it to the World Cup against all odds (and much of the Italian media's opinion).|$|E
5|$|For many years, revellers {{celebrating the}} New Year have {{gathered}} in the square <b>despite</b> <b>a</b> <b>lack</b> <b>of</b> celebrations being arranged. The lack of official events was partly because the authorities were concerned that encouraging more partygoers would cause overcrowding. Since 2003, a firework display centred on the London Eye and South Bank of the Thames has been provided as an alternative. Since 2014, New Year celebrations have been organised by the Greater London Authority {{in conjunction with the}} charity Unicef, who began ticketing the event to control crowd numbers.|$|E
5|$|Chakrapani {{decided to}} retain only the {{background}} of Gundamma's family from the original and rewrote the remaining script, taking inspiration from William Shakespeare comedy, The Taming of the Shrew. Chakrapani killed the character of Gundamma's cowardly husband because he felt that a husband who cannot answer his wife's questions is not eligible to be included. Kamalakara Kameswara Rao was chosen to direct the film. Chakrapani named the central character Gundamma in the remake {{after one of the}} characters in the original, <b>despite</b> <b>a</b> <b>lack</b> <b>of</b> nativity. Nagi Reddy's family members and the employees of the Vijaya Vauhini Studios used to ask him Gundamma Katha Entha varaku vachchindi? ("What is the progress in Gundamma's story?"), which prompted Nagi Reddy to title the film Gundamma Katha after considering various options.|$|E

5|$|Jay Farrar, {{along with}} his {{brothers}} Wade and Dade, played in an early 1980s garage band named The Plebes. Hailing from Belleville, Illinois, The Plebes sought to enter a battle-of-the-bands competition but needed another high school student as a member to perform. They invited Jeff Tweedy, a high school friend of Jay Farrar, to join the band and play with them for the show. <b>Despite</b> <b>a</b> <b>lack</b> <b>of</b> skill with his instrument, Tweedy {{played an important role}} in the band by booking early gigs. While The Plebes had been playing music in a rockabilly style, Tweedy wanted to play punk rock like the music that he originally heard the group perform. This caused tensions between Tweedy and Dade Farrar, who left the band two months after Tweedy joined.|$|E
5|$|Named for British anesthetist Brian Arthur Sellick (1918–1996) {{who first}} {{described}} the procedure in 1961, {{the goal of}} cricoid pressure is to minimize the possibility of regurgitation and pulmonary aspiration of gastric contents. Cricoid pressure has been widely used during RSI for nearly fifty years, <b>despite</b> <b>a</b> <b>lack</b> <b>of</b> compelling evidence to support this practice. The initial article by Sellick {{was based on a}} small sample size at a time when high tidal volumes, head-down positioning and barbiturate anesthesia were the rule. Beginning around 2000, a significant body of evidence has accumulated which questions the effectiveness of cricoid pressure. The application of cricoid pressure may in fact displace the esophagus laterally instead of compressing it as described by Sellick. Cricoid pressure may also compress the glottis, which can obstruct the view of the laryngoscopist and actually cause a delay in securing the airway.|$|E
5|$|The Panthers {{struggled}} {{during their}} early years and only once {{during their first}} four seasons did they finish in {{the upper half of}} the league table. The club's first coach, Alex Archer, left Nottingham after two seasons and was replaced by Archie Stinchcombe who would coach the team until 1955. <b>Despite</b> <b>a</b> <b>lack</b> <b>of</b> success in their formative years the team had a number of players who would become local heroes including forwards Les Strongman and Chick Zamick. Zamick {{became one of the most}} prolific scorers in the league and won the Nottingham Sportsman of the Year award on two occasions, defeating sportsmen such as the Notts County and England international footballer Tommy Lawton.|$|E

5|$|There is {{no known}} cure for {{multiple}} sclerosis. Treatments attempt to improve function after an attack and prevent new attacks. Medications {{used to treat}} MS, while modestly effective, can have side effects and be poorly tolerated. Physical therapy can help with people's ability to function. Many people pursue alternative treatments, <b>despite</b> <b>a</b> <b>lack</b> <b>of</b> evidence. The long-term outcome is difficult to predict, with good outcomes more often seen in women, those who develop the disease early in life, those with a relapsing course, and those who initially experienced few attacks.

5|$|A {{tropical}} wave {{moved off}} the coast of Africa on August 14, 1998. It traveled westward, and on August 19 spawned the tropical depression that eventually became Hurricane Bonnie. The wave continued westward across the Atlantic Ocean and Caribbean Sea, and crossed Central America into the eastern Pacific Ocean on August 25. The wave decreased its forward speed while approaching a large low-level circulation over southern Mexico. A broad area of disturbed weather formed in association with the wave and the low-level circulation, and after persisting for several days developed a smaller low-level circulation on August 29 about 575miles (925km) south-southeast of Cabo San Lucas. On August 31, the two primary areas of convection were well-removed from the center. By early on September 1, <b>despite</b> <b>a</b> <b>lack</b> <b>of</b> convective organization, the low-cloud circulation was sufficiently well-defined that the National Hurricane Center designated it as Tropical Depression Ten-E, or the tenth tropical depression of the season, about 350miles (565km) south of Cabo San Lucas. In real time, the National Hurricane Center first upgraded the system 21hours later.|$|E
5|$|After {{dropping}} out of college, Hanna worked briefly as a construction engineer and helped build the Pantages Theatre in Hollywood. He lost that job during the Great Depression and found another at a car wash. His sister's boyfriend encouraged him {{to apply for a}} job at Pacific Title and Art, which produced title cards for motion pictures. While working there, Hanna's talent for drawing became evident, and in 1930 he joined the Harman and Ising animation studio, which had created the Looney Tunes and Merrie Melodies series. <b>Despite</b> <b>a</b> <b>lack</b> <b>of</b> formal training, Hanna soon became head of their ink and paint department. Besides inking and painting, Hanna also wrote songs and lyrics. For the first several years of Hanna's employment, the studio partnered with Pacific Title and Art's Leon Schlesinger, who released the Harman-Ising output through Warner Bros. When Hugh Harman and Rudolph Ising chose to break with Schlesinger and begin producing cartoons independently for Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer (MGM) in 1933, Hanna was one of the employees who followed them.|$|E

In light of open interest expressed by figures within the U.S. and West Germany, the British government approached these nations with an offer to collaborate on the project and to seek contributions towards the cost involved. Following the acceptance of all three nations, on 22 May 1962, Hawker received a formal Instruction to Proceed with the procurement of materials for the construction of the nine aircraft.|$|E
5|$|David Mirkin (born September 18, 1955) is an American {{feature film}} and {{television}} director, writer and producer. Mirkin grew up in Philadelphia and intended to become an electrical engineer, but abandoned this career path in favor of studying film at Loyola Marymount University. After graduating, he became a stand-up comedian, and then moved into television writing. He wrote for the sitcoms Three's Company, It's Garry Shandling's Show and The Larry Sanders Show and served as showrunner on the series Newhart. After an unsuccessful attempt to remake the British series The Young Ones, Mirkin created Get a Life in 1990. The series starred comedian Chris Elliott and ran for two seasons, <b>despite</b> <b>a</b> <b>lack</b> <b>of</b> support from many Fox network executives, who disliked the show's dark and surreal humor. He moved on to create the sketch show The Edge starring his then-partner, actress Julie Brown.|$|E
5|$|Hassan was {{originally}} interested in association football {{before deciding to}} take up track and field athletics. <b>Despite</b> <b>a</b> <b>lack</b> <b>of</b> training opportunities and facilities, she was {{given the opportunity to}} participate in the 2014 Summer Youth Olympics but, since South Sudan was not yet a member of the International Olympic Committee, she competed as an Individual Olympic Athlete. She took part in the 400 m, but did not win a medal. She also attended the 2016 African Championships in Athletics, where she was eliminated in the heats of the 200 m event. For the 2016 Summer Games, she was again entered in the women's 200 m, where she was placed in heat four. This heat contained eventual gold medal-winner Elaine Thompson of Jamaica, although it was won by the Ivory Coast's Marie-Josée Ta Lou.

5|$|In 1878 Long unsuccessfully {{challenged}} the incumbent Rice for the gubernatorial nomination. When Rice {{announced his retirement}} the following year, Long again sought the nomination. It went to former Lieutenant Governor Thomas Talbot, but Long won the lieutenant governor nomination by acclamation. The Democratic opposition was divided by Benjamin Butler's return to that party, and the Republican ticket won the general election. Long capitalized on Talbot's avoidance of public ceremonies to maintain a high profile despite his post's relative unimportance. He was easily nominated for governor when Talbot announced he would not run for reelection, <b>despite</b> <b>a</b> <b>lack</b> <b>of</b> support from the party leadership. The election was highly divisive, pitting Long against Butler and the divided Democrats. Long was criticized for his lack of Civil War service and attacked for his diversions from the party line, but won a comfortable victory. He was reelected by comfortable margins the two following years.|$|E
5|$|In {{contrast}} to the large 1960 team, the teams in subsequent Olympics were scaled back and were the smallest since 1936. The 1964 Winter Olympics were marred by the deaths of Australian skier Ross Milne—who crashed during a practice run—and a British luge competitor. Milne had skidded off the course and crashed into a tree. Members of the IOC asked the AOF whether Milne was negligently sent to compete <b>despite</b> <b>a</b> <b>lack</b> <b>of</b> experience, which the AOF denied. The Australian manager John Wagner blamed the accident on {{a large group of}} skiers who had congregated lower down on the course during the practice session, forcing Milne to take evasive action. The Australian delegation felt that the training arrangements had not been enacted strictly, making the course unsafe. Australia was represented by five skiers—excluding Milne. Christine Smith placed in the top 30 in two events, but the remainder placed 40th or lower, although all were in {{the bottom half of the}} field. Milne's replacement Peter Wenzel placed 68th in both the downhill and giant slalom.|$|E

(Kenneth Starr, then Solicitor General, had maintained in the government's brief opposing certiorari that his prior purchase of the Bare Boys magazines was all the proof it needed, even if the action were legal at the time.) Pressed on other undercover investigative techniques, he admitted that a government-run pawn shop would be a permissible way to apprehend thieves <b>despite</b> <b>a</b> <b>lack</b> <b>of</b> evidence of predisposition because the crimes might well have occurred prior to any contact with the government or its operatives.|$|E
