40|$|The aim of {{this first}} part of two {{introduction}} chapters is to discuss features of critical studies of educational policy within the broader field of policy studies and in relation to sociological, political and philosophical research on education. The point of departure is the so-called “policy orientation” in social research, {{and the emergence of}} policy analysis and its concern within the welfare state. The sphere and genre of critical educational policy studies {{at the beginning of the}} 1980 s was mainly rooted in sociological, historical, and political research on education, that is, the research tradition interested in the power, politics and (social) regulation in and around schools. Echoing the term “policy orientation”, we want to introduce the notion critical education policy orientation to describe the distinctive scope of critical education policy studies. In this chapter we will not present either detailed definitions of and illuminating linkages between the main concepts in research traditions nor <b>exhaustive</b> <b>overviews</b> and final accounts of perspectives, theories and methods. The aim instead is to offer some general overviews of approaches and discussions for the purpose of bringing some matters of concern in the diversity of studies critically oriented towards educational policy to the foreground...|$|R
40|$|Mycobacteria infections, such as {{tuberculosis}} and leprosy, cause devastation throughout the world, {{and even though}} decades of research have been focused on these diseases, the mechanisms of mycobacteria pathogenicity in general, and especially of Mycobacterium tuberculosis, are still not fully understood. The very long antibiotic treatment (between 3 and 6 months or even longer) necessary to cure mycobacteria infections has increasingly led to the appearance of strains resistant to multiple antibiotics. This trend makes the {{need to understand the}} course of mycobacterial diseases even more pressing. However, the complexity, difficult accessibility and ethical concerns linked to the use of mammalian models, such as non-human primates and mice, have hampered advancement in understanding the underlying molecular mechanisms. Mycobacterium marinum belongs to the genus of mycobacteria and is an established model to study mycobacteria pathogenicity in alternative host organisms [1 – 7]. In this chapter we focus especially on these model features of M. marinumand the experimental advantages it brings with it, especially in synergism with genetically tractable host organisms, both at systemic and cellular levels. Formore <b>exhaustive</b> <b>overviews</b> on infections caused by M. marinum, including its immunology and histopathological aspects, we would refer the reader to recent reviews [1, 3, 8]...|$|R

The most important parameters influencing the extent of the oxidation reaction along with relevant practical notes are discussed in the third section. The concluding section outlines how the most significant features of flame treatment can be profitably used to improve the wettability and adhesion properties of polyolefin surfaces, especially from the perspective of developing novel composite solutions such as polyolefins/bio-based coating pairs intended for many different applications...|$|R
40|$|Human {{universals}} are the commonalitiesthe onenessof mankind, {{and anthropology}} {{is charged with}} their study. Universals form a general, immutable foundational theory of humanity.

Music composition is viewed as the organization of contrasting soundssonics. Humanasonics is a new word that names the concept of deriving inspiration from human universals for music composition. This suite of program music is structured in four movements, totalling approximately twenty minutes, for jazz orchestra. Each movement is inspired by a human universal trait or condition. The conclusion asserts that when music is metaphorically based on immutable human universality, it will lead to an inherent understanding, unconscious or conscious, of the work...|$|R

40|$|The {{market for}} {{microbial}} pesticides is, though slowly, expanding. Therefore more research with these pesticides {{will be carried}} out in the near future, not only for agronomical and economical, but also for environmental reasons. As more chemical pesticides are going to be banned, microbial pesticides, with a more environmental friendly image, can be an interesting alternative for farmers. Regulatory agencies therefore need to build up a consistent framework for the requirement of various data. Such frameworks exist in the US and Canada; they do not exist in Europe, although the European Commission (EC) is elaborating a proposal. All these frameworks deal with data requirements in general, {{and to a lesser extent}} with the test protocol (except the US and Canada), the format of the test report, and the quality of the required data. They, also, do not include guidance on how to carry out a proper environmental risk assessment, when all required data are submitted to the regulatory agencies. Therefore, it is recommended to construct a specific Dutch framework for data requirements, and, subsequently, environmental risk assessment, in addition to the current endeavour of the EC. This report entails a concise - but not <b>exhaustive</b> - <b>overview</b> of the data requirements for the notification of microbial pesticides in the US, Canada, Denmark, the Netherlands, and the United Kingdom. They are compared with an EC-proposal from January 1997. The report also entails various recommendations with respect to the further development of a Dutch framework for data requirements, risk assessment, and risk management...|$|R
40|$|This chapter {{provides}} an overview of methods used for the extraction of biophysical vegetation variables from remote sensing imagery. It starts with the description of the main spectral regions in the optical window of the electromagnetic spectrum based on typical spectral signatures of land surfaces. Subsequently, the merit and problems of using radiative transfer models to describe the relationship between spectral measurements and biophysical and chemical variables of vegetation are described. Next, the use of statistical methods by means of vegetation indices for the same purpose gets attention. An overview of different types of indices is given without having the ambition in being <b>exhaustive.</b> Subsequently, an <b>overview</b> is provided of the biogeophysical vegetation variables that can directly be estimated from optical remote sensing observations, with emphasis on using vegetation indices. These vegetation variables are: (1) chlorophyll and nitrogen, (2) vegetation cover fraction and fAPAR, (3) leaf area index, and (4) canopy water. Finally, an outlook for a major research direction in the near future in this context is provided...|$|R

40|$|The aim of {{this article}} is twofold. On one hand we give an overview, without any {{pretension}} of being exhaustive, of some theoretical tool of the modern theory of musical performance. On the other hand we present two mathematical models based on the ideas of Mazzola's Mathematical Music Theory, that enable to concretely answer typical question on the way a player performs. For instance, now a claim like "Horowitz has a more local way than Cortot to play Schumann's 'Traumerei"' has a strong statistical support. 1 Montez tous a la fois, oceans irrites! Astres, detachez-vous des cieux epouvantes! Et vous, formes de l'etre a jamais disparues, Gigantesques debris que heurtaient les charrues, Pressez-vous sous la terre et dans vos lit poudreux. Faites-nous une place, o freres monstrueux! Les Fossiles, Louis Bouilhet. 1 Performance Grammars The idea that performance should be executed along certain regular patterns {{comes from the fact that}} music is viewed as a vehicle of contents, and that these contents are, by the very nature of musical semantics, hidden, di#cult and ambiguous. In other words, the way they are expressed is an essential condition for their communication. At present, only very elementary grammatical patterns are known. We distinguish rule based approaches from rule learning procedures. For an <b>exhaustive,</b> comprehensive <b>overview</b> of performance research we refer to [5]. Essentially, three directions in rule based grammars are known: the KTH school, Neil Todd's approach and Guerino Mazzola's work. The terminology of Johan Sundberg and his school at KTH recovers the idea of basing performance on rules in analogy with the linguistic grammar. The first attempts toward this goal were first introduced by Mathis Lussy [6]. He proposed that musical expression is not s [...] ...|$|R
40|$|National audienceTracing out an <b>exhaustive,</b> albeit brief, <b>overview</b> of {{the archaeological}} mapping {{situation}} – both digital and not − is aextremely highly difficult task in our country. This is so because, {{on the one}} hand, the territory of our nation is rather complex, as is archaeological heritage; secondly because, over the years, a congenital lack of standardization in research has conditioned the development of individual application projects, both in traditional methodologies {{as well as in}} the more recent data processing. Just because digital aspects have revolutionized the modus operandi and conception of cartography (obviously not only archaeological) over the past thirty years, it goes without saying that the issue of applied technologies is closely linked to scientific and methodological questions. In the hope of avoiding the trivialization of such a complex issue by excessive synthesizing, we shall attempt to outline a brief disciplinary frame of reference that can be used as a key to understanding the information technology applications developed over the past thirty years - from the numerical cartography to the Global Positioning System (GPS), from the Geographical Information System (GIS) to recent global navigation networks - and their foreseeable influence on the future prospects of digital archaeological mapping (thus, even if in small part, of archaeological research in general) ...|$|R
40|$|Sustainable {{development}} and, above all, sustainable {{production and}} consumption in the agri-food sector have been key issues since the 2000 s, stimulating the creation of many international initiatives and strategies aimed at reducing environmental impacts deriving from food {{production and consumption}} and at finding more sustainable ways of production. This first chapter {{is designed to provide}} the reader with an as <b>exhaustive</b> as possible <b>overview</b> of the key concerns, applications, and methodological issues of agri-food life cycle assessment (LCA). On this scale the major international initiatives (with a special focus on two relevant and recent European ones), eco-labels and declarations, and footprints (at product level, based on an LCA approach) developed so far are reported. Some of the most important LCA initiatives developed by agricultural and livestock operators, the industry sector, logistics sector, trade, and the end of life of packaging and/or food waste operators are also described in the chapter. Considering that one of the key issues within the agri-food sector is the lack of reliable and up-to-date inventory data on food products and processes, {{the state of the art}} of the major existing international LCI databases is reported, and the national and international initiatives currently under development highlighted. Finally, the chapter takes into account dietary issues in the sense that in the context of food sustainability the importance of consumer behaviour and, in particular, dietary behaviour is becoming increasingly recognised, together with the product and its production chain...|$|R
