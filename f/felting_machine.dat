40|$|FoxandMoore [2] have {{recently}} proposeda newVM for Forth, called MachineForth. Using a simple concrete model, {{it is said}} to be readily adaptable to different hardware, and to produce reasonably efficient code without needing to descend to assembler.

This paper examines these claims with respect to an implementation for the ARM processor, and compares a MachineForth based Forth system with a similar system using the ARM's machine model, and a conventional Forth system. 1 Introduction In March 1999 there was a discussion on comp. lang. forth of Charles Moore's Machine Forth, a virtual machine model which he was said to be using for all his Forth programming, and had realised in several silicon designs such as the F 21.

40|$|To make paper, {{machines}} spray {{wet pulp}} on a moving screen and extract {{the water from}} it by squeezing it between rollers, before drying it using heat and rolling it on reels as finished product. The water extracted in the squeezing process is removed by a continuous roll of fabric called a felt. There are typically three felts on a paper <b>machine.</b> <b>Felts</b> wear out over time, and therefore must be replaced, either at a planned machine shutdown or at some other time when the machine fails randomly. All machine stoppages incur a downtime cost. This paper presents a stochastic dynamic programming model for determining a felt replacement policy that minimises the expected felt cost and cost of downtime. 1 Introduction This paper examines a problem that arises in running the paper machines at the Tasman pulp and paper mill in Kawerau, Bay of Plenty.

Provo stated that the game's most significant addition was its save system. However, he and Electronic Gaming Monthly also both enjoyed the new power-ups. Many aspects of the game's level design were praised; Electronic Gaming Monthly and Sega Power enjoyed the game's expansive stages, secret areas, much less linear level design, and difficulty. Mean Machines agreed, describing the game as [...] "a rollercoater ride from start to finish" [...] and listing Carnival Night as their favorite level, which they described as [...] "probably the most slickly programmed portion of game in Megadrive history". Humphreys and Mean <b>Machines</b> <b>felt</b> that the game was too short, but they and Sega Magazine felt that its two-player mode and the Emerald collecting would significantly extend the title's replay value. On the other hand, Whitehead said that the stages' large sizes would keep players sufficiently engrossed. Sega Magazine also enjoyed having the ability to play as Knuckles in the two-player mode.|$|R
50|$|The U.S. bearing {{industry}} {{by this point}} was a $1 billion business, having tripled in size since World War II. As a leading producer of a broad line of anti-friction bearings, including needle, ball, roller, and specialty bearings, Torrington had benefited immeasurably from the prolific growth of the bearing industry, while the company's host of other products buttressed its financial performance. In addition to bearings, Torrington's eight domestic plants were devoted to the manufacture of nuts, screws, bolts, metal specialties, spokes and nipples, drill bits, surgeon needles, hooking and <b>felting</b> needles, swaging <b>machines,</b> and a special purpose sewing machine, lending a diversity to the company's business lines that insulated it from cyclical economic conditions to a large extent. Beyond U.S. borders, the Torrington empire comprised manufacturing facilities in England, Canada, Germany, Brazil, Italy, Portugal, and in Japan, giving the company a sizeable presence in key international markets. The domestic and international operations created a solid manufacturing entity that flourished during the 1960s. Sales, which stood at $33.6 million in 1950, totaled $67.5 million in 1960, then shot upward to $93.4 million in 1965. The following year, Torrington celebrated two century marks by reaching its 100th anniversary in business as well as reaching over $100 million in sales. By all accounts, Torrington was a thriving manufacturer—a company that had earned the respect of competitors—and now, as it mapped its course for its second century of business, it began {{to attract the attention}} of a handful of suitors intent on acquiring the venerable manufacturing concern.|$|R

The short dialogue just related, had been carried on in voices so loud as to be heard by all near the speakers; and when Columbus turned from the boat, he saw {{that many of his}} crew had been hanging suspended in the rigging, or on the yards, eagerly listening to what had been said. At this precise instant the anchor of the Santa Maria was raised from the bottom, and the ship's head began to incline {{from the direction of the}} wind. At the next moment, the flap of the large square foresail that crafts of her rig then carried, was heard, and in the course of the next five minutes, the three vessels were standing slowly but steadily down the current of the Odiel, in one of the arms of which river they had been anchored, holding their course toward a bar near its mouth. The sun had not yet risen, or rather it rose over the hills of Spain, a fiery ball, just as the sails were set, gilding with a melancholy glory, a coast that not a few in the different vessels apprehended they were looking upon for the last time. Many of the boats clung to the two smaller craft until they reached the bar of Saltes, an hour or two later, and some still persevered until they began to toss in the long waves of the breathing ocean, when, the wind being fresh at the west, they reluctantly cast off, one by one, amid sighs and groans. The liberated ships, in the meanwhile, moved steadily into the blue waters of the shoreless Atlantic, like human beings silently impelled by their destinies toward fates that they can neither foresee, control, nor avoid.|$|R
40|$|When {{the paper}} web and press felt enter a nip {{in the press}} section of a paper machine, both the paper web and felt are compressed. Water is forced from the paper sheet into the press felt due to a {{hydrodynamic}} pressure gradient between the sheet and felt. Water not only flows through the felt in the transversal z-direction, but also flows through the <b>felt</b> in the <b>machine</b> and cross-machine directions. On the exit side of the nip, the pressure imposed on the sheet-felt system by the rolls begins to decrease. Both the paper web and press felt begin to expand, and a vacuum is created in the web and felt. The vacuum in the web is stronger than that in the felt, and thus water and air tend to flow from the felt back into the sheet, causing rewet. Three mechanisms that contribute to rewet have been proposed: 1) film splitting between the paper web and press felt, 2) capillary forces in the web drawing water from the felt into the web, and 3) the pressure differential between the web and felt during expansion. The objective of this project was to design and test under flow conditions {{similar to those in}} a press nip a smart water receiver {{to be used in the}} press section of a paper machine. In this manner, the feasibility of such a water receiver was to be determined. The purpose of this water receiver is to accept water that is pressed from the paper web in a nip and prevent the return of this water to the paper web upon exit from the nip. Thus, the smart water receiver allows flow through the felt in the positive z-direction of the felt (away from the paper web) and not in the negative z-direction (towards the paper web). The smart water receiver concept utilizes a layer of micro-check valves incorporated into the press felt to perform in the desired manner. A mathematical model and lab-scale prototype were created in order to predict the behavior of such a design in the press nip. M. S.

40|$|The last decade, {{in forest}} {{harvesting}} {{more and more}} use is made of specialized machines, such as harvesters and forwarders. However, these machines, among other things time efficient and safer to work with, normally have a great weight of which {{the impact on the}} soil should not be underestimated. Therefore, increasingly more {{attention has been paid to}} the impact of mechanized harvesting on the forest ecosystem in general and the soil in particular. However, research often takes place under different circumstances of soil, machine type used, weather conditions, traffic intensity et cetera so that results are difficult to compare. In an integrated experiment (performed in Flandres, Belgium) the effect of soil texture, soil water content, machine weight and traffic intensity on the degree of soil compaction is being examined. Eight forest stands were chosen on four soil textures (sand, sandy loam, loam, alluvial clay), in each case performing the same experiment in winter (high soil water content, 19 - 20 February 2007) and in summer (low soil water content, August-September 2007). For selection, certain criteria were used: stands must be close to eachother (same weather conditions), no harvesting activities may be performed in the last 10 years and tree distance must be large enough so that no trees have to be <b>felt</b> to alow <b>machines</b> to pass. Two machines are used: a New Holland TCE 50 tractor, 1460 kg, weighted to 1880 kg and a John Deere 640 D grapple skidder, 11800 kg, weighted with a concrete block to 14300 kg. In each stand eight trails of 40 meters are marked out, four for the winter, respectively the summer experiment. Of these four trails, two trails are provided for each machine, one to drive one passage back and forth and one to drive five passages back and forth. Several soil physical variables are measured to quantify the degree of soil compaction. Reference measurements are made on the trails before the experiment. After passage of the machines, the same soil variables are measured on the trails within and between the wheel tracks. Soil samples are taken from depth intervals 0 - 10, 10 - 20 and 20 - 30 cm with Kopeckey soil cores. After weighing, the samples are dried (24 h, 105 °C) and weighed again in order to estimate bulk density and the soil water content. A subset of the samples remains undisturbed in the Kopeckey soil cores and are analysed for saturated hydraulic conductivity and the pF-curve. With a penetrologger, penetration resistance of the soil is measured to a depth of 80 cm. Through the process of soil compaction, pore volume and continuity are also influenced, what may alter gas diffusion rate. As this is a very sensitive indicator for soil compaction, in a later phase measurements of CO²-concentrations in the soil profile will be performed. Two poles and a 4 m long slat, placed across the width of the skid trail are used to examine the depth of the ruts. Each 10 cm a measurement is made of the penetration resistance and the vertical distance between soil and slat. In future, a trench will be dug across the width of the skid trails to evaluate the impression of the different soil layers. In each stand a part of each skid trail is marked and will be protected from perturbation at future harvesting activities. The aim is to monitor the soil physical properties in order to estimate the recovery rate and to examine the response of the biotic variables, such as fauna, flora, regeneration,…Results of the winter experiment are now (partially) available but still have to be processed...|$|R
