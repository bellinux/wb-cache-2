5|$|August 31, 1993– The western eyewall of Hurricane Emily {{crosses the}} northeastern Outer Banks, with <b>its</b> <b>strong</b> winds leaving 553dwellings uninhabitable.

5|$|The {{three schools}} within the {{district}} serve about 1,535 students, {{and the district}} spends an average of $24,858 per pupil; its student–teacher ratio is 11:1 (the national averages are $12,435 and 15.3:1 respectively). Demand for entrance to the school is high due to <b>its</b> <b>strong</b> performance and ratings.|$|E
5|$|Actinium is a soft, silvery-white, radioactive, {{metallic}} element. Its estimated {{shear modulus}} {{is similar to}} that of lead. Owing to <b>its</b> <b>strong</b> radioactivity, actinium glows in the dark with a pale blue light, which originates from the surrounding air ionized by the emitted energetic particles. Actinium has similar chemical properties to lanthanum and other lanthanides, and therefore these elements are difficult to separate when extracting from uranium ores. Solvent extraction and ion chromatography are commonly used for the separation.|$|E

5|$|As the {{previous}} storm was moving along the coastline {{of the southeastern}} United States, a new hurricane was observed in the western Caribbean Sea, about halfway between Honduras and Jamaica. Its intensity, based on a ship report, was estimated at 105mph (165km/h). The hurricane moved slowly west-northwestward, and another ship experienced <b>its</b> <b>strong</b> winds on October7. There were no further observations, so its complete track is unknown.|$|E
5|$|Chulip was {{directed}} by Yoshirou Kimura, a former employee of Love-de-Lic. Kimura wanted the game's focus to be on kissing in public, a more Western-accepted custom, within a Japanese setting. Chulip suffered dismal sales, while its overall critical reception has been negative to average. Most reviews cited the game's quirkiness and charm as <b>its</b> <b>strong</b> points yet criticized its tedious gameplay mechanics.|$|E

5|$|Megalodon {{probably}} {{had a profound impact}} on the structure of marine communities. The fossil record indicates that it had a cosmopolitan distribution. It probably targeted large prey, such as whales, seals, and giant turtles. Juveniles inhabited warm coastal waters where they would feed on fish and small whales. Unlike the great white which attacks prey from the soft underside, megalodon probably used <b>its</b> <b>strong</b> jaws to break through the chest cavity and puncture the heart and lungs of its prey.|$|E
5|$|Only {{one of the}} storms, the second, made landfall, {{doing so}} near Apalachicola, Florida. It {{produced}} heavy rainfall and gusty winds across the southeastern United States, {{although there was no}} severe damage associated with the storm. The first hurricane killed two people when a ship passed through its winds for 14hours. The third hurricane, located in the western Caribbean Sea, did not affect land, although two ships experienced <b>its</b> <b>strong</b> winds. The final hurricane lasted three days across the western Atlantic, forcing one ship to halt its voyage due to storm damage.|$|E

Ramos even included him in the immigration blacklist.|$|E
5|$|Polonium was {{discovered}} in 1898 by Marie and Pierre Curie, when it was extracted from uranium ore and identified solely by <b>its</b> <b>strong</b> radioactivity: {{it was the first}} element to be so discovered. Polonium was named after Marie Curie's homeland of Poland. Polonium has few applications, and those are related to its radioactivity: heaters in space probes, antistatic devices, and sources of neutrons and alpha particles. Polonium's intense radioactivity makes it dangerously toxic.|$|E
5|$|September 22, 1989– Hurricane Hugo {{crosses the}} western {{portion of the}} state, with <b>its</b> <b>strong</b> winds {{destroying}} or severely damaging many homes across the state.
