It is shown that major differences in these properties are largely due to crystallinity and consequent surface structure of the extensive (larger dimension “basal”) face. Well-crystallized <b>kaolinites,</b> with higher Hinckley indices and lower aspect ratios, have relatively smooth, flat basal surfaces and thicker edge planes promoting both effective initial bridging flocculation (largely edge−edge) and structural rearrangement to face−face during the raking process.

40|$|Kinetic {{studies have}} shown that the {{isothermal}} dehydration of the clay minerals proceeds according to a first ordcr law enabling velocity constants to be evahmted for different emperatures. From these, the Arrhenius parameters have been determined and on this basis, the clay minerals may be classified into three main groups, viz., <b>kaolinites,</b> secondary mica clays and montmorillonites. No significant difference is shown by comparison of the Arrhenius plots for the <b>kaolinites</b> and halloysites but the secondary mica clays decompose more rapidly than the <b>kaolinites</b> at comparable temperatures. Evidence is provided to illustrate that the constants obtained are associated with the basic process involving interaction of hydroxyl groups in the clay mineral lattice, Indirect evidence also suggests tnat the irreversibility of the dehydration is due to lattice collapse resulting in the formation of highly stable configurations of Si 4 q, AP,- and 02 - atoms.

5|$|In 2009, a {{group of}} {{scientists}} from the CRISM team reported on 9 to 10 different classes of minerals formed in the presence of water. Different types of clays (also called phyllosilicates) were found in many locations. The physilicates identified included aluminum smectite, iron/magnesium smectite, <b>kaolinite,</b> prehnite, and chlorite. Rocks containing carbonate were found around the Isidis basin. Carbonates belong to one class in which life could have developed. Areas around Valles Marineris were found to contain hydrated silica and hydrated sulfates. The researchers identified hydrated sulfates and ferric minerals in Terra Meridiani and in Valles Marineris. Other minerals found on Mars were jarosite, alunite, hematite, opal, and gypsum. Two to five of the mineral classes were formed with the right pH and sufficient water to permit life to grow.|$|E
5|$|Clay {{and fine}} silt, {{dominated}} by lutite, were {{deposited in the}} lake. Closer to the shore, sand was also emplaced. Deltaic deposits have been found as well. Minerals identified include biotite, chlorite, illite, <b>kaolinite,</b> montmorillonite and muscovite, with varying colors depending {{on the origin of}} the sediments. The material deposited by Lake Cahuilla is also known as the Cahuilla formation. The Borrego and Pleistocene Brawley formations may also be linked to Lake Cahuilla. These lacustrine materials bury {{the northern part of the}} Colorado River Delta, and they give the ground a grayish color. The clays left by the lake were used for the production of ceramic by the inhabitants of the region; likewise Lake Cahuilla is responsible for the fertile soils of the Coachella Valley and Imperial Valley, an important agricultural province of the United States. Halite deposits left by the lake were mined in the 19-20th century.|$|E
5|$|Once in the environment, {{neptunium}} generally oxidizes fairly quickly, {{usually to}} the +4 or +5 state. Regardless of its oxidation state, the element exhibits {{a much greater}} mobility than the other actinides, largely due to its ability to readily form aqueous solutions with various other elements. In one study comparing the diffusion rates of neptunium(V), plutonium(IV), and americium(III) in sandstone and limestone, neptunium penetrated more than ten times {{as well as the}} other elements. Np(V) will also react efficiently in pH levels greater than 5.5 if there are no carbonates present and in these conditions it has also been observed to readily bond with quartz. It has also been observed to bond well with goethite, ferric oxide colloids, and several clays including <b>kaolinite</b> and smectite. Np(V) does not bond as readily to soil particles in mildly acidic conditions as its fellow actinides americium and curium by nearly an order of magnitude. This behavior enables it to migrate rapidly through the soil while in solution without becoming fixed in place, contributing further to its mobility. Np(V) is also readily absorbed by concrete, which because of the element's radioactivity is a consideration that must be addressed when building nuclear waste storage facilities. When absorbed in concrete, it is reduced to Np(IV) in a relatively short period of time. Np(V) is also reduced by humic acid if it is present on the surface of goethite, hematite, and magnetite. Np(IV) is absorbed efficiently by tuff, granodiorite, and bentonite; although uptake by the latter is most pronounced in mildly acidic conditions. It also exhibits a strong tendency to bind to colloidal particulates, an effect that is enhanced when in soil with a high clay content. The behavior provides an additional aid in the element's observed high mobility.|$|E

40|$|Abstract [...] This {{review of}} the {{literature}} shows that there have been many attempts to modify or revise the original definition of halloysites as distinguished from <b>kaolinites,</b> which was based on the greater water content of the halloysites. In general; these various attempts have arrived at definitions of halloy-sites as distinguished from <b>kaolinites</b> that are based on one or more particular instrumental or chemical techniques. Further investigations with almost all of these techniques have shown the apparently clear distinctions of this kind to be misleading. All such instrumentally [...] or chemically [...] based definitions were shown to either complicate and confuse the distinction between halloysites and <b>kaolinites</b> or to provide only empirical and subtle distinctions. It is concluded that only the original definition, with slight adaptations, enables clear and unambiguous distinctions to be made between halloysites and <b>kaolinites.</b> It is noted, however, that a distinctive structure for halloysite has been postulated as a result of electron diffraction studies. Further studies of this kind could well establish such a structure as being definitive of the mineral species. The literature also reveals a long-standing disagreement over the nomenclature of different forms of halloysite and particularly over the nomenclature of and distinction between the two forms of halloysite at the extreme nds of the hydration series.

Some o{ the <b>kaolinites</b> consist of well-formed hexagonal crystal plates with edges still sharp at a magnification of 132, 000 diameters.

At high magnification the halloysite clay minerals exhibit a structure consisting of rolled sheets, rather than hollow rods. In some cases, it is evident hat several separate crystal sheets are coaxially rolled to form multiple concentric hollow tubes. In the South Texas outcrop samples, the morphology is very complex, as the samples do not consist of one uniform type of particle. Matted sheets composed of interlaced bundles of lath-like particles have been observed. These oriented particles exhibit ypical "fiber" type electron diffraction patterns.

40|$|Thermally activated, acid-activated, and acid-leached of {{thermally}} activated <b>kaolinites</b> {{were prepared}} from the Egyptian ore. The {{physical and chemical}} properties were studied using N 2 sorption at − 196 °C, FTIR, SEM, and the total surface acidity. The sorption of NH 4 + ions on the investigated sorbents was controlled with the solution pH, sorbent dosage, and initial concentration of NH 4 + solution. Kinetic and equilibrium NH 4 + sorption at 30 °C were employed. Four kinetic models were applied to the kinetic sorption data; pseudo-second-order, Elovich, and intraparticle diffusion models fitted well the kinetic data whereas pseudo-first-order model was less applicable. Elovich parameters refer to physical sorption type of NH 4 + on nonuniform sites and the intraparticle diffusion controls the sorption of NH 4 + by <b>kaolinites</b> to a small extent. The equilibrium sorption data followed Langmuir and D-R models; the negative value of ΔG indicates a spontaneous sorption and the mean sorption energy obtained shows also physical sorption.
