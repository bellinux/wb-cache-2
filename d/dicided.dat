40|$|Coconut wood {{has been}} {{potentially}} {{available as a}} source of raw material for wood processing industries for many years. Coconut wood is a non-traditional forestry timber. In forestry jargon coconut wood is classified as a non-wood or non-timber product. As a source of industrial raw material for boards and planks and for fumiture components and housing utensils plenty of coconut woods are available as wood substitutes throughout Indonesia. It is technically as well as economically viable. Its investment opportunities is good and its prospects is also promising. The analysis was based on a case study which was conducted in North Sulawesi Province of eastern Indonesia using a dynamic programming aproach to identify and to analyse intertemporal investment allocation possibilities and its best altematives to gain financial and economic return. When the limited funds were to be best <b>dicided</b> and allocated based on scarcityresource allocation decision approach then the dynamic programming model has proven as a best choice. Eventhougk the model is not a best one but it is available to guide the decision makers to best posible alternative solutions in a decision making process...|$|E

First, slide motions are investigated by flume experiments with para-meters; inclination angle, supply discharge, soil characters and geometric shape. Simultaneously,mass and momentum equations are formulated for a soil mass sliding on a slope, and the theo-retical solutions are {{obtained for the}} sliding velocity and location of a soil mass. Second, themechanism is discussed for the transformation of a soil mass from slide motion into debris flow. A theoretical method is obtained to predict the critical slide distance which <b>dicide</b> the location wherethe motion of soil mass is transformed into debris flow. Formulas are compared with flumeexperiments for a slide motion and its transformation into debris flow...|$|R

The materials used were 41 cases of congenital heart diseases and 21 cases of aquired heart diseases 1) There was no close relationship between the hemodynamic state and the spatial maximum QRS vector magnitude or the QRS half area axis in the horizontal plane or the QRS polar vector magnitude. 2) The shape of the QRS loop in the horizontal plane were classified into 2 groups, and each group was separated into 4 and 6 types. These types {{was found to be}} related closely with the right ventricular systolic pressure. This classification may be useful in assessing the severity and operative effect of the case with right ventricular overloading or <b>diciding</b> the operative indication. 3) The T loop has the tendency to be oriented toward left backward in the case of right ventricular diastolic overloading, and left forward in the case of right ventricuar systolic overloading...|$|R
40|$|Usually {{transport}} systems, {{and roads}} in particular, {{are viewed as}} public goods. However, {{this is not always}} the case. In Sweden {{a large part of the}} road system is privately owned. Most of these privately owned roads are rural roads used by farmers and summer cottage owners, or used for forest transport. The roads are mainly provided by ownership associations. The motivation of this paper is the practical problem of how such an ownership association can <b>dicide</b> the costs for the road netword among the members in a "fair" way. The problem is treated from a game theoretical point of view, making use of the Shapley value. This means that the problem is associated with a game – a mathematical representation of the conflict situation. The Shapley value is a very important solution concept for cooperative games, like tha game in this case. For games corresponding to this specific type of problems, it is shown that the Shapley value has excellent properties, such as being an element of the core, and being very easy to compute. Transport networks; cooperative game theory...|$|R
40|$|Trace mineral {{selenium}} is {{an essential}} nutrient of fundamental importance to human biology, therefore {{it is very important}} to be in our daily diet. Although it is known that selenium content of foods show big variety, the most widely consumed food have low selenium content. The goal of our work is to study the enrichment of selenium during germination of wheat and pea (Triticum aestivum and Pisum sativum) because we percieve based on previous studies that this sprouts are able to take element high in concentration. Sprouting was chosen because it additionally enhances the nutritional value of seeds, for example, by a higher vitamin content, a better quality of protein, and some other parameters. We <b>dicided</b> to combine this with higher selenium content. Inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS) was used to determine the total element concentration. After determining this, we calculated how many percent of selenium are found in sprouts treated with Se covers our daily need. With regards to our experiments, we concluded that, selenium are good for the treatment of sprout because the 0. 1 mg dm- 3 selenium treatment contribute to cover our daily need of selenium need...|$|E
40|$|Minimum wages {{province}} and regency is public policy created by Governor in each provinces. The objective of minimum wages rate is to increased labour welfare and stable economic growth. The councils wages provinces has authority to decided wages minimum rate in each provinces and Governor declared minimum wages rate. The member of councils wages provinces, i. e, member of labour unions, member of enterprenuer unions, and government staff and university lecture. The councils wages provinces <b>dicided</b> minimum wages provinces and regency rate, annually base on; expenditure need satisfaction, economic growth, labour productivity, {{ability to pay}} of marginal company, unemployment and minimum wages rate, of near other regencies. But the dominant factor to fixed minimum wages rate are expenditure need satisfaction and ability to pay of marginal company. To evaluate the labour welfare, we can take ratio beetwen minimum wages provinces and regency rate, to expenditure need satisfaction. If this ratio near or equal to one hundred procent, it is meant the labour welfare is enough. The fact in Bali Provinces shows that the ratio of minimum wages rate to expenditure need satisfaction are not reach one hundred procent. But its ratio was increased from 2006 to 2007. That?s meant labour welfare is increased in Bali Provinces...|$|E

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this paper is to discuss the {{influence}} of Flexi-Time (the system of flexible working hours) on the social lives and general metal and physical health of workers. The conclusions, based on a survey of conditions of 1, 087 workers in several different companies, may be summarized as follows: (1) Flexi-Time liberates the workers from the restrictions of working hours and rush hours. (2) Generally, Flexi-Time harmonizes the rhythm of the work with that of the private life of the workers, and therefore it improves the state of their health. And, in general, this harmonization of work time and private leisure time is one of the fundamental elements of a healthy social life. But, on the other hand, since the implementation of Flexi-Time, some workers have been following rather irregular schedules, and this has had an unfavorable effect on their health. The analysis indicates that, in order to ensure the Flexi-Time program works efficiently and that all the workers remain healthy, they should <b>dicide</b> their own social lives independent of company control, only then will harmony between the rhythm of work and the private life be attained...|$|R
40|$|AIM: To {{compare the}} {{clinical}} effect between small-incision cataract surgery and phacoemulsification. METHODS: Totally 93 patients(124 eyes) with age-related cataract who received treatment in Mar 2010 and Feb 2013 were <b>dicided</b> into 2 groups randomly. Forty-two patients(59 eyes) in group small-incision cataract surgery(SICS) were treated by SICS, while other 51 patients(65 eyes) in group Phaco were treated by phacoemulsification. And then, postoperative visual acuity, corneal astigmatism, surgically induced astigmatism(SIA) and intraoperative and postoperative complications were contrasted between groups. RESULTS: After 1 d and 1 wk of postoperation, there were 38 eyes(64. 4 %) and 41 eyes(69. 5 %) having a better visual acuity of 0. 5 in the SICS group, {{while there were}} 29 eyes(44. 6 %) and 32 eyes(49. 2 %) in the Phaco group. The vision of SICS group was better than that of Phcao group(χ 2 = 4. 877, 5. 242, P χ 2 = 0. 005, 0. 085, P > 0. 05). The average corneal astigmatism used analysis of repeatedly measuring designing variance: Comparing the corneal astigmatism in intra-groups at different times, it was statistically significant(F = 25. 624, P F = 0. 986, P > 0. 05). The coneal astigmatism of each group was higher at 1 wk after the surgery than that of preoperation, and the contrast had statistical sigenficence(t = 2. 906, 2. 427, P t =- 4. 628, 2. 770, P t = 0. 754, P > 0. 05). There were statistical differences in SIA at different time both by intra-group comparison and group comparison(F = 26. 37, P F = 14. 29, P CONCLUSION: Our research shows that small-incision cataract surgery and phacoemulsification had similar effect {{in the treatment of}} cataract. Phacoemulsification is not the only surgery option for the best treatment effect. Small-incision cataract surgery can be popularized in basic-level hospitals, achieving the effect similar to phacoemulsification...|$|E
40|$|The Dominican Serafino Razzi is {{far better}} known in Croatia {{as the author of}} the first printed history of Dubrovnik than as a {{compiler}} of lives of saints and Dominican brothers and author of moral and religious works such as the Giardino d 2 ̆ 7 essempi overo fiori delle vite de 2 ̆ 7 santi, printed in Brescia, in 1607. The mentioned work appeared as a result of Razzi’s pastoral activity. Namely, ever since Aristotle, the exemplum was considered an instrument of rhetoric argumentation. The reason lies in its suggestiveness, for using exemplum an able rhetor could teach and motivate without using theory or making deductions. Christian preachers were fully aware of the value of suggestive examples. Razzi, himself a preacher in the Florentine church of St Mark, used exemples in his sermons and collected a vast number of them over the years. Spurred by some friends, he eventually <b>dicided</b> to have them printed and made available for college preachers, who with the Giardino d 2 ̆ 7 essempi got new handy examples to employ in their sermons on virtues and vices. The aim of course, was to increase the psychological and moral effect of sermons, as well as the number of works of practical piety. Drawing on known and unknown sources, Razzi compiled a true florilegium (» The appeal of saintly examples and that of sundry flowers are equally irresistible«). This mosaical work lacks organic structure and rests entirely upon a number of moral and ascetic themes arranged in alphabetical order (adulterio, astinenza, avaritia, bestemia [...] .), incorporating unequal numbers of examples. They total 768, falling under 85 titles. Their sources are quoted either at the beginning or {{at the end of the}} texts. What makes this work interesting to us is the fact that 69 examples come from Marulić 2 ̆ 7 s De institutione, which puts him shoulder to shoulder with St Jerome, Pope Gregory, Bonaventura, Cassian, Luis de Granada, Bernard or Voragine. Also, stressing in the preface Marulić 2 ̆ 7 s De institutione as well as its Italian translation and taking from it an impressive number of examples (1 / 11) and almost the whole of the chapter IV, 7 - 8, Razzi proves that Marulić 2 ̆ 7 s authority was particularly great in the time after the Council of Trent...|$|E
