[...] In announcing his lawsuit he said, [...] "I believe the anti-immigration movement in America is one of our most serious public problems." [...] He added: [...] "I am speaking out and filing this action because <b>I</b> <b>believe</b> <b>that</b> <b>a</b> threat to immigration can be a threat to the future of our country." [...] Giuliani said that the Immigration and Naturalization Service [...] "do nothing with those names but terrorize people." [...] His lawsuit against the new immigration law claimed that the new federal requirement to report illegal immigrants violated the Tenth Amendment. [...] He said that the law, as well as the Welfare Reform Act, were [...] "inherently unfair." ...|$|E
2500|$|In 2011 and 2012, Plunkett {{struggled}} with form and played just three Championship matches for Durham. In October 2012, Plunkett signed {{to play for}} Yorkshire. He stated, [...] "At this stage of my career, <b>I</b> <b>believe</b> <b>that</b> <b>a</b> fresh challenge would benefit me and I feel this is required to help me reach my goal of representing my country again". In his first season at Yorkshire, Plunkett played in 12 of the club's 16 matches in the County Championship, managing to take 36 wickets. He credits Jason Gillespie, Yorkshire's coach and former Australia international fast bowler, with helping him regain his confidence and felt that his problems had been exacerbated by over-coaching. In an interview in June 2014 Plunkett explained [...] "Different coaches told me different things and when you're a youngster you're like a sponge and {{take a lot of}} things in.... When I came to Yorkshire, Jason Gillespie just told me to run it and bowl quick. And when I did that I backed myself, bowled in my good areas and started picking up wickets." [...] Under the tutelage of Yorkshire coach and former Australia fast bowler Jason Gillespie, Plunkett's fortunes improved and he was awarded his county cap in 2013. The following year, Plunkett was recalled to the England Test team.|$|E
