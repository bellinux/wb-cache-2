40|$|<b>Electronic</b> <b>forms</b> is an {{emerging}} market {{that is being}} incorporated into daily use in many corporations and small businesses. In the transition from paper <b>forms</b> to <b>electronic</b> <b>forms</b> many users are merely recreating the paper forms digitally to create an exact replica on screen. This is being done through the utilization of page layout programs such as QuarkXpress and PageMaker {{as well as through}} the aid of <b>electronic</b> <b>forms</b> software programs available today. These software programs aid the user with forms design, often providing templates of forms that are in a graphical format containing rules, logos, and other graphically embellishing elements. The <b>electronic</b> <b>forms</b> industry is also moving towards a workgroup computing environment where intelligent forms can automatically be sent electronically to other users in the workplace without ever printing onto paper. However, the graphic elements involved in the <b>electronic</b> <b>forms</b> of today can slow down networks and require many bytes of memory for storage especially in major corporations who may have thousands of forms on file. A comparison of the graphically embellished form versus a straight data-entry questions only form format needs to be researched. The purpose of this thesis project is to provide the <b>electronic</b> <b>forms</b> industry with knowledge as to {{the advantages and disadvantages of}} both a graphical form and a straight data-entry form. This research also performed a series of tests as to the timeliness, accuracy of data entered, and user 2 ̆ 7 s preference for both graphically embellished forms and straight questions-only forms...|$|R
25|$|A {{television}} set, {{also called}} a television receiver, television, TV set, TV, or telly, is {{a device that}} combines a tuner, display, and speakers {{for the purpose of}} viewing television. Introduced in the late 1920s in mechanical form, television sets became a popular consumer product after World War II in <b>electronic</b> <b>form,</b> using cathode ray tubes. The addition of color to broadcast television after 1953 further increased the popularity of television sets in the 1960s, and an outdoor antenna became a common feature of suburban homes. The ubiquitous television set became the display device for the first recorded media in the 1970s, such as VHS and later DVD. In the late 2000s flat panel television incorporating liquid-crystal displays largely replaced cathode ray tubes. Modern flat panel TVs are typically capable of high-definition display (720p, 1080p or 2160p) and can also play content from a USB device.|$|E
25|$|The Concrete Herald {{was founded}} in Hamilton, Washington in 1901, then moved to Concrete, Washington in 1913. After {{changing}} its owners and editors several times, the newspaper entered a 40-year period of stability when from 1929 to 1970 it was owned and edited by Charles Dwelley. During this period, as Dwelley's editorials were picked up by other publications and quoted nationwide, the Herald recognition and subscription base expanded beyond Concrete, into Skagit Valley. After Dwelley's retirement, The Concrete Herald was purchased by Robert and June Fader, both experienced journalists. However, after Robert's premature death in 1985, and June's retirement in late 1989, the Herald was purchased by a local businessman unconnected to publishing business {{which led to the}} newspaper's demise in 1991.

However, contextual evidence on health workers’ barriers and motivating factors that may influence large-scale implementation of such interfaces for health care delivery is scarce. Methods: A pretested semistructured questionnaire {{was used to assess}} health workers’ experiences, barriers, preferences, and motivating factors in using mobile health forms on smartphones in the context of maternal health care in Ethiopia. Twenty-five health extension workers (HEWs) and midwives, working in 13 primary health care facilities in Tigray region, Ethiopia, participated in this study. Results: Over a 6 -month period, a total of 2, 893 electronic health records of 1, 122 women were submitted to a central computer through the Internet. Sixteen (69. 6 %) workers believed the forms were good reminders on what to do and what questions needed to be asked. Twelve (52. 2 %) workers said <b>electronic</b> <b>forms</b> were comprehensive and 9 (39. 1 %) workers saw <b>electronic</b> <b>forms</b> as learning tools. All workers preferred unrestricted use of the smartphones and believed it helped them adapt to the smartphones and <b>electronic</b> <b>forms</b> for work purposes. With regards to language preference, 18 (78. 3 %) preferred using the local language (Tigrinya) version of the forms to English.

Delrina was Bennie's third major entrepreneurial start up after co-founding Mission Electronics, a high-end home entertainment equipment producer, and Aviva Software, which became Ingram Micro Canada. Delrina's business strategy was to [...] "establish technical and market leadership in niche markets", which it accomplished with its <b>electronic</b> <b>form</b> and PC-based fax software. A year before the firm was incorporated, Amato and Skapinker had quit their jobs to start work on an electronic forms product which would eventually become PerForm. Both would later meet with Bennie, {{who was then the}} co-founder and CEO of Ingram Micro Canada before becoming CEO of Carolian Systems International, a firm that made business software for Hewlett-Packard. Bennie facilitated an initial seed investment of $1.5 million CAD to finance a new start-up company, [...] "Delrina", to develop this idea.
