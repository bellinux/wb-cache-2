40|$|Digital imaging is a rapid {{growing area}} with the {{developments}} in computer technology. Digital color use has become a conventional tool in many disciplines, such as cartography remote sensing and photogrammetry. The need for better color quality enforces digital imaging industry to produce devices with less color distortions. Despite the today’s advanced level of technology, {{it is known that}} input and output devices cause color distortions, which depends {{on the quality of the}} device itself. Scanners, being peripheral devices that capture the image of an object, are mostly used input devices in digital imaging. In this study color accuracy of <b>desktop</b> <b>scanners</b> is handled. A method based on polynomial transformation, which makes possible to map device dependent colors to device independents ones, is introduced. Tests on five different <b>desktop</b> <b>scanners</b> show the evident applicability of the method. 1...|$|R
50|$|TIFF {{was created}} {{as an attempt}} to get <b>desktop</b> <b>scanner</b> vendors of the mid-1980s to agree on a common scanned image file format, in place of a {{multitude}} of proprietary formats. In the beginning, TIFF was only a binary image format (only two possible values for each pixel), because that was all that desktop scanners could handle. As scanners became more powerful, and as desktop computer disk space became more plentiful, TIFF grew to accommodate grayscale images, then color images. Today, TIFF, along with JPEG and PNG, is a popular format for deep-color images.|$|E
50|$|More {{complex systems}} were used with digital processing, {{especially}} crossed-array and rosette seekers. These had such extremely narrow instantaneous fields of view (IFOV) {{that they could}} be processed to produce an image, in the same fashion as a <b>desktop</b> <b>scanner.</b> By remembering the location of the target from scan to scan, objects moving at high speeds relative to the target could be eliminated. This is known as cinematic filtering. The same process is used by imaging systems, which image directly instead of scanning, and have the further capability of eliminating small targets by measuring their angular size directly.|$|E

In late 1996, Pure Atria announced that Rational Software would acquire it in an $850 million stock swap in what was then the richest merger in Silicon Valley history. Hastings and Randolph commuted together between their homes in Santa Cruz, California into Silicon Valley for about four months while the Rational merger was finalized, and on these drives, the idea for Netflix was born.|$|E

50|$|In the {{professional}} and advanced amateur segments, Photo CD had been eclipsed by low cost desktop scanners such as those from Nikon and Minolta in the mid range, and by drum scanners at the very high end. While the pixel resolution of Photo CD was still comparable or better than the alternatives, Photo CD suffered {{from a number of}} other disadvantages. Firstly, the Photo CD color space, designed for TV display, is smaller than what can be achieved by even a low cost <b>desktop</b> <b>scanner.</b> Secondly, the color rendition of Photo CD images changed over time and with different scanner versions; 4050 scanners had different color rendition to earlier versions. Thirdly, the dynamic range of scans was lower than for desktop scanners. Tests at the time indicated that the dmax rating (a measure of maximum density obtainable) of Photo CD was 2.8-3.0, while commonly available desktop scanners were reaching 4.2, a substantial difference. As a result of this, and Photo CD’s problems with color rendering, by 2004 {{the professional}} segment of the user community had generally turned against Photo CD.|$|E
40|$|Gafchromic XRQA radiochromic film, is an {{effective}} tool for quality assurance and dose assessment in kilovoltage radiotherapy and diagnostic applications. Like other Gafchromic film products, XRQA film exhibits a variation in dose to reflected optical density response with angle of rotation when analysed with a light source that is partially or fully polarised such as a <b>desktop</b> <b>scanner.</b> Although warnings are not given on manufacturers specifications, this can affect dosimetry accuracy and we recommend that {{it is essential to}} scan all XRQA films in the same orientation. The effect is not as pronounced as EBT Gafchromic film. The magnitude of this variation has been measured and shown to be up to 16 ± 2 % (1 SD) using a fully linear polarised light source was seen with a 90 ° angle rotation. This would be the maximum variation seen on a <b>desktop</b> <b>scanner</b> with a fully polarised light source. For our standard <b>desktop</b> <b>scanner</b> (Epson v 700) a mean variation of 2 ± 1 % from 0 cGy to 20 cGy applied dose was measured as compared to 8 ± 2 % for EBT Gafchromic. We recommend that to decrease uncertainty in dose measurement, accurate alignment of the calibration films to experimental films be performed on a regular basis.

40|$|Ultraviolet {{radiation}} dosimetry has been {{performed with the}} use of a radiochromic film dosimeter called Gafchromic EBT for solar radiation exposure. The film changes from a clear colour to blue colour when exposed to ultraviolet radiation and results have shown that the colour change is reproducible within ± 10 % at 5 kJ m− 2 UV exposure under various conditions of solar radiation. Parameters tested included changes in season (summer versus winter exposure), time of day, as well as sky conditions such as cloudy skies versus clear skies. As the radiochromic films ’ permanent colour change occurs in the visible wavelengths the film can be analysed with a <b>desktop</b> <b>scanner</b> with the most sensitive channel for analysis being the red component of the signal. Results showed that an exposure of 5 kJ m− 2 (approximately 1 h exposure in full sun during summer) produced an approximate 0. 28 change in the net OD when analysed in reflection mode on the <b>desktop</b> <b>scanner</b> which is significant darkening. The main advantages of this film type, and thus the new EBT 2 film which has replaced EBT for measurement of UV exposure, is the visible colour change and thus easy analysis using a <b>desktop</b> <b>scanner,</b> its uniformity in response and its robust physical strength for use in outside exposure situations...|$|E

40|$|Measurement {{of solar}} {{ultraviolet}} (UV) radiation {{is an important}} aspect of dosimetry for the improved knowledge of UV exposure and its associated health related issues. EBT 2 Gafchromic film has been designed by its manufacturers as an improved tool for ionizing radiation dosimetry. The film is stated as exhibiting a significant reduction in UV response. However, results have shown that when exposed to UV from the ‘bottom side ’ i. e. from the thick laminate side, the film exhibits a sensitivity to solar UV radiation which is both measurable and accurate for UV dosimetry. Films were irradiated in this position to known solar UV exposures and results are quantified showing a reproducibility of measurement to within ± 7 % (1 SD) when compared to calibrated UV meters. With an exposure of 20 J cm− 2 broad spectrum solar UV, the films net OD change was found to be 0. 248 OD ± 0. 021 OD when analysing the results using the red channel region of an Epson V 700 <b>desktop</b> <b>scanner.</b> This was compared to 0. 0294 OD ± 0. 0053 OD change with exposure to the same UV exposure from the top side. This means that solar UV dosimetry can be performed using EBT 2 Gafchromic film utilizing the underside of the film for dosimetry. The main advantages of this film type for measurement of UV exposure is the visible colour change and thus easy analysis using a <b>desktop</b> <b>scanner</b> as well as its uniformity in response and its robust physical strength for use in outside exposure situations...|$|E

40|$|Abstract – Gafchromic XRCT radiochromic {{film is a}} self {{developing}} high sensitivity radiochromic film product {{which can}} be used for assessment of delivered radiation doses which could match applications such as Computed Tomography (CT) dosimetry. The dose response of Gafchromic XRCT radiochromic film has been measured with reflectance spectrophotometry and <b>desktop</b> <b>scanners.</b> The film automatically changes colour upon irradiation, changing from a yellow to a green/brown colour. Results show a high sensitivity to delivered dose compared to other conventional radiochromic films which is well suited to CT applications where lower applied doses are delivered. Sensitivity is found for this film with a 1 cGy applied dose, producing an approximate net optical density change of 0. 3 at 636 nm and 0. 2 net OD using broad band white light. This high sensitivity combined with its relatively energy independent nature around the 100 kVp to 150 kVp x-ray energy range provides a unique enhancement in dosimetric measurement capabilities over currently available dosimetry films for CT applications...|$|R

In many cases {{it is important to be}} able to determine the source of a digital image. This paper presents methods for authenticating images that have been acquired using flatbed <b>desktop</b> <b>scanners.</b> The method is based on using the pattern noise of the imaging sensor as a fingerprint for the scanner, similar to methods that have been reported for identifying digital cameras. To identify the source scanner of an image a reference pattern is estimated for each scanner and is treated as a unique fingerprint of the scanner. An anisotropic local polynomial estimator is used for obtaining the reference patterns. To further improve the classification accuracy a feature vector based approach using an SVM classifier is used to classify the pattern noise. This feature vector based approach is shown to achieve a high classification accuracy...|$|R
40|$|Organizations like banks, post office, {{passport}} office, civil registrations get {{hundreds of}} applications daily for enrollment into their systems.

A significant amount of labor is incurred when the amount of data is in the order of hundreds. In this project the aforementioned enrollment process has been automated by using simple image processing algorithms. The boundaries of each fingerprint impression are determined by using the scan-lines followed by the region of interests for segmenting the fingerprints. In another work, different morphological operations are used to identify the fingerprint impressions. Segmentation becomes complex when the impressions do not follow any particular order. To counter such problems connected components of a pixel are used for segmenting the impressions...|$|E

The main challenge {{comes from the fact}} that the proposed algorithm must use a single picture of the key obtained from a regular <b>desktop</b> <b>scanner</b> without any special preparation. It does not use the special lasers, lighting systems, or camera setups commonly used for the purpose of key measuring, nor does it require that the key be placed in a precise position and orientation. Instead, we propose an algorithm that uses a wide range of image processing methods to discover all the information needed to identify the correct key blank and to find precise measures of the notches of the key shank from the single scanned image alone. Our results show that our algorithm can correctly differentiate between different key models and can measure the dents of the key with a precision of a few tenths of a millimeter...|$|E
40|$|Digital {{photogrammetry}} is now increasingly {{recognized as}} being a powerful tool in geomorphology. However, the high material costs and skills required by digital photogrammetry may deter non-photogrammetrists from using this technique in their research. This paper demonstrates {{the use of a}} close-range digital photogrammetric methodology accessible to non-photogrammetrists and yet capable of yielding good quality topographic information on coarse gravel riverbeds at minimal cost. Digital Elevation Models (DEMs) were derived from 1 : 165 scale imagery obtained with a 35 mm film SLR camera, a commercial <b>desktop</b> <b>scanner</b> and a softcopy photogrammetry package. Quality assessment based upon independent checkpoints and scaling analysis showed that the precision of the DEMs was consistently less than 10 % of the D 50 of the bed particles. This translates into sub-centimetric precision. Whilst photogrammetry is presently capable of a better data quality at this scale, quality must be judged with respect to the requirements of the geomorphological applications under consideration. Thus, the methodological simplifications adopted in this research are acceptable in order to make photogrammetry both cost-effective and accessible...|$|E

At - 188 kPa, length from root tip to root hair initiation zone decreased and RHL became more variable near the root hair initiation zone as compared to - 63 kPa.
