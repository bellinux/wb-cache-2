40|$|Quantum {{algorithms}} are well-suited {{to calculate}} {{estimates of the}} energy spectra for spin lattice systems. These algorithms {{are based on the}} efficient calculation of the discrete <b>Fourier</b> <b>components</b> of the density of states. The efficiency of these algorithms in calculating the free energy per spin of general spin lattices to bounded error is examined. We find that the number of <b>Fourier</b> <b>components</b> required to bound the error in the free energy due to the broadening of the density of states scales polynomially with the number of spins in the lattice. However, the precision with which the <b>Fourier</b> <b>components</b> must be calculated is found to be an exponential function of the system size.

25|$|Heisenberg's paper did {{not admit}} any unobservable {{quantities}} like the exact {{position of the}} electron in an orbit at any time; he only allowed the theorist {{to talk about the}} <b>Fourier</b> <b>components</b> of the motion. Since the <b>Fourier</b> <b>components</b> were not defined at the classical frequencies, they could not be used to construct an exact trajectory, so that the formalism could not answer certain overly precise questions about where the electron was or how fast it was going.|$|R
50|$|Thus, by {{describing}} any composition fluctuation {{in terms of}} its <b>Fourier</b> <b>components,</b> Cahn showed that a solution would be unstable with respect to sinusoidal fluctuations of a critical wavelength. By relating the elastic strain energy to the amplitudes of such fluctuations, he formalized the wavelength or frequency dependence of the growth of such fluctuations, and thus introduced the principle of selective amplification of <b>Fourier</b> <b>components</b> of certain wavelengths. The treatment yields the expected mean particle size or wavelength of the most rapidly growing fluctuation.|$|R

We attempt to investigate which features in his model are essential for developing oriented receptive fields. Here we consider a slightly simplified version of Linsker's model and analyze its process of synaptic weights modification by computing the Fourier transform of the weight modification rule. Through our mathematical analysis, we obtain the following observations: (1) a Mexican-hat shape function as the correlation function extracts the <b>Fourier</b> <b>components</b> of a certain frequency, (2) {{the shape of the}} <b>Fourier</b> cosine <b>component</b> is circular symmetric while that of the <b>Fourier</b> sine <b>component</b> is bi-modal, and (3) the arbor function determines either the <b>Fourier</b> sine <b>component</b> or the <b>Fourier</b> cosine <b>component</b> dominates the other.

40|$|AbstractIf the <b>Fourier</b> <b>components</b> of {{a moving}} plaid have similar {{temporal}} frequency, spatial frequency and contrast, coherent motion is perceived according to subjective judgements. We have devised a more objective method {{of determining the}} conditions required for coherent motion. Moving plaid stimuli were created with one stationary component. Plaids with a stationary component always have a single perceived direction of motion, which {{is determined by the}} presence or absence of coherent motion. In a temporal two-interval forced-choice paradigm we used a direction discrimination task to investigate the effect of varying the temporal and spatial characteristics of the <b>Fourier</b> <b>components</b> and pattern contrast on the probability of coherent motion perception. Agreement across observers regarding the conditions required for coherent motion was excellent using this more objective method. We find that patterns do not produce coherent motion when presented at contrast threshold, irrespective of how similar the <b>Fourier</b> <b>components</b> are. We also confirm that when the temporal frequency, spatial frequency and contrast of the gratings are sufficiently similar, observers report the direction of motion indicating coherent motion...|$|R
