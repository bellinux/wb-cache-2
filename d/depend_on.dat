Many physical and chemical properties of hydrogen <b>depend</b> <b>on</b> the parahydrogen/orthohydrogen ratio (it often takes days or weeks at a given temperature to reach the equilibrium ratio, for which the data is usually given). Hydrogen detonation parameters, such as critical detonation pressure and temperature, strongly <b>depend</b> <b>on</b> the container geometry.|$|E
