Closed form stress analysis methods are the primary analytical tools used in this methodology.

Once these variables are identified, scatter in their values is evaluated and statistically characterized. The scatter in applied loads and the structural parameters are then fitted to appropriate probabilistic distribution functions. Numerical integration techniques are applied to compute the structural reliability. The predicted reliability accounts for scatter due to variability in material strength, applied load, fabrication and assembly processes.

We use a form of domain decomposition for training and inference, where each sub-domain (tile) is comprised of a non-overlapping focus region surrounded by an overlapping context region. The relative sizes of focus and context are physically motivated and depend on the locality length scale of the problem. Extensive deep neural networks (EDNN) are a formulation of convolutional neural networks which provide a flexible and general approach, based on physical constraints, to describe multi-scale interactions.
