500|$|The {{first leg}} {{was held at}} Highbury on 1 February 1995. Milan's {{preparations}} were overshadowed by the violence that occurred in their last domestic fixture, against Genoa three days ago. Clashes between both sets of supporters resulted in police intervention {{and the use of}} tear gas. Vincenzo Spagnolo, a Genoa supporter, was stabbed prior to kick-off and subsequently died while receiving treatment. The match was later abandoned once word was sent to the players and staff during half-time. Milan manager Fabio Capello admitted his players were deeply affected by the incident and struggled to focus on the Super Cup match. He told reporters: [...] "I believe that the psychological balance of each player has been damaged by Sunday's tragedy. Our team was in great condition until Sunday. But <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>past</b> <b>few</b> <b>days</b> I have had to wake up the players. So I'm not able to anticipate which kind of Milan you will see." [...] 800 Milan supporters travelled to London, and Capello denied reports a section of them intended to cause trouble.|$|E

He {{had been}} on a hunger strike for more than a week, {{reportedly}} protesting the refusal by the authorities to allow him to seek medical treatment for injuries suffered as a result of torture. [...] Mr. Mohammadi's attorney, Khalil Bahramian, said that according to fellow detainees of his client, he [...] "had been savagely beaten by prison guards <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>past</b> <b>few</b> <b>days</b> and that he was carrying the signs of the beatings".|$|E

About a month later close friend David Crosby said [...] "nobody found her for a while" [...] and [...] "to my knowledge, she is not speaking yet." [...] However, Mitchell's conservator, Leslie Morris, later released a statement saying that [...] "details that have emerged <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>past</b> <b>few</b> <b>days</b> are mostly speculative.

The EU Monitoring Mission in Georgia also said that its unarmed patrols were blocked from entering South Ossetia and EUMM needed access to areas [...] "where the incidents are purported to have taken place" [...] {{in order to make a}} [...] "more complete assessment of the situation on the ground." ...|$|E

60|$|In {{consequence}} of the disasters that had befallen us <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>past</b> <b>few</b> <b>days,</b> Lee could be reinforced largely, and I had no doubt he would be.

Thus he brought about a bustle that drove the Duke's business from Richard's mind, and left Blake without a pretext to pursue his quest for information.

60|$|The {{only thing}} that {{prevented}} her relief being unmixed {{was the fact that}} she could see Lord Wisbeach casting furtive glances at Jimmy, who was eating with the quiet concentration of one who, after days of boarding-house fare, finds himself {{in the presence of the}} masterpieces of a chef. <b>In</b> <b>the</b> <b>past</b> <b>few</b> <b>days</b> Jimmy had consumed too much hash to worry now about anything like a furtive glance. He had perceived Lord Wisbeach's roving eye, and had no doubt that at the conclusion of the meal he would find occasion for a little chat. Meanwhile, however, his duty was towards his tissues and their restoration. He helped himself liberally from a dish which his father offered him.|$|E

I hear that his circumstances are well-nigh desperate. He has mortgaged the income of his estates, which, of course, he is unable to sell, as they go with the title to the heir. He is pressed by many creditors, who, now that he has lost the favour of the king, will give him no further grace. Indeed, I understand that the king, who is always liberal, and who not infrequently makes considerable gifts to the gentlemen of the court, to enable them to support the necessary expenses, has already assisted him several times, and that it was only by such aid that {{he has been able to}} hold on as long as he has done.|$|E

6000|$|They {{were trying}} to explain, {{not for the first}} time, as their weary {{gestures}} and frequent interruptions showed, what in their common language they had christened their [...] "lapses"; a constant source of distress to them, <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>past</b> <b>few</b> <b>days,</b> and the immediate reason why Ralph {{was on his way to}} leave the house when Katharine, listening anxiously, heard him and prevented him. What was the cause of these lapses? Either because Katharine looked more beautiful, or more strange, because she wore something different, or said something unexpected, Ralph's sense of her romance welled up and overcame him either into silence or into inarticulate expressions, which Katharine, with unintentional but invariable perversity, interrupted or contradicted with some severity or assertion of prosaic fact. Then the vision disappeared, and Ralph expressed vehemently in his turn the conviction that he only loved her shadow and cared nothing for her reality. If the lapse was on her side it took the form of gradual detachment until she became completely absorbed in her own thoughts, which carried her away with such intensity that she sharply resented any recall to her companion's side. It was useless to assert that these trances were always originated by Ralph himself, however little in their later stages they had to do with him. The fact remained that she had no need of him and was very loath to be reminded of him. How, then, could they be in love? The fragmentary nature of their relationship was but too apparent.|$|E
