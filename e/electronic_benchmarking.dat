Hospitality operators, especially SMEs, have little data upon which to base an assessment of electronic distribution channel effectiveness with sparse look-to-book ratios being among the few metrics offered.

40|$|Photoelectron {{spectroscopy}} {{measurements and}} density functional calculations are combined {{to determine the}} lowest electron binding energies of first row transition metal aqua ions, titanium through copper, with 3 d 1 through 3 d 9 electronic configurations, in their most common oxidation states. Vertical ionization energies are found to oscillate considerably between 6. 76 and 9. 65 eV for the dications and between 7. 05 and 10. 28 eV for the respective trivalent cations. The metal cations are modeled as [M H 2 O n]q clusters q 2, 3, and 4; n 6 and 18 surrounded by continuum solvent. The performance of 10 exchange amp; 8722;correlation functionals, two GGAs, three MGGAs, two HGGAs and three HMGGAs, combined with the MDF 10 ECP 6 31 G d,p basis set is assessed for 11 M amp; 8722;O bond distances, 10 vertical ionization energies, 6 adiabatic ionization energies, and the associated reorganization free energies. We find that for divalent cations the HGGA and HMGGA functionals {{in combination with the}} 18 water model show the best agreement with experimental vertical ionization energies and geometries; for trivalent ions, the MGGA functionals perform best. The corresponding reorganization free energies amp; 955;o of the oxidized ions are significantly underestimated with all DFT functionals and cluster models. This indicates that the structural reorganization of the solvation shell upon ionization is not adequately accounted for by the simple solvation models used, emphasizing the importance of extended sampling of thermally accessible solvation structures for an accurate computation of this quantity.

40|$|The {{problems}} of productivity, predictability and quality {{in design and}} delivery of the building product are well documented. Prefabrication, process reengineering and digitalization are proposed as potential solutions to address these issues. One issue that is rarely addressed, however, is {{the management of the}} changes required to move from existing to a new paradigm of practices. Organization of work in construction, as opposed to other industries, has barely evolved in the last centuries. The research project studies the impact of the introduction of a new high-rise building construction system and BIM related technologies on the organization of work within a multi- residential project. The aim is to develop a concept of operation on how to reorganize work process within and between practices and trades. Ethnographic methods were used to identify issues regarding the management of information, the organization of work and the perceptions regarding BIM associated technologies and tools such as <b>electronic</b> tablets. <b>Benchmarking</b> and lean production tools such as value stream mapping were also utilized to identify {{problems of}} productivity and waste. Waste related to poor management of workflows and information flow was a major issue and had a strong impact on productivity. Contractual context in which there are no incentives for professionals and trades to improve their overall performance (no share responsibilities and fragmented obligations) was identified as the principal obstacle to changes in existing practices. Traditional project management practices proved to be inefficient to compensate the lack of coordination and collaboration between the project stakeholders. However, even if the use of BIM proved to be impractical in this context, tablets were well received as a way to improve collaboration and coordination of the work. A concept of operation was derived from the lessons learned that will be validated in the next pilot project. Peer reviewe...|$|R

40|$|By {{employing}} the combined Bohmian quantum formalism with the U(1) and SU(2) gauge transformations of the non-relativistic wave-function and the relativistic spinor, within the Schrödinger and Dirac quantum pictures of electron motions, {{the existence of}} the chemical field is revealed along the associate bondon particle  characterized by its mass (mΒ), velocity (vΒ), charge (eΒ), and life-time (tΒ). This is quantized either in ground or excited states of the chemical bond in terms of reduced Planck constant ħ, the bond energy Ebond and length Xbond, respectively. The mass-velocity-charge-time quaternion properties of bondons’ particles were used in discussing various paradigmatic types of chemical bond towards assessing their covalent, multiple bonding, metallic and ionic features. The bondonic picture was completed by discussing the relativistic charge and life-time (the actual zitterbewegung) problem, i. e., showing that the bondon equals the <b>benchmark</b> <b>electronic</b> charge through moving with almost light velocity. It carries negligible, although non-zero, mass in special bonding conditions and towards observable femtosecond life-time as the bonding length increases in the nanosystems and bonding energy decreases according with the bonding length-energy relationship Ebond[kcal/mol]*Xbond[A]= 182019, providing this way the predictive framework in which the particle may be observed.

40|$|Ab initio {{electronic}} structure calculations and variational transition state theory {{are used to}} calculate reaction energetics and rate constants for the gas-phase reactions of OH- with CH(4 -n) Cln for n) 1 - 4. Two reaction pathways are considered, second-order (bimolecular) nucleophilic substitution (SN 2), and proton transfer. <b>Benchmark</b> <b>electronic</b> structure calculations using CCSD(T) and basis sets as large as aug-cc-pVQZ are performed to obtain highly accurate estimates of the enthalpies of reaction. These results are extrapolated to the complete basis set limit for comparison with experiment and to establish the level of theory needed to provide energies that are accurate to better than a few kJ/mol. Energies of critical geometries (reactant complexes, saddle points, and product complexes) are computed for all systems. For the SN 2 reaction, the potential energy and its first and second derivatives along minimum energy paths are computed and used directly in variational transition state theory (VTST) calculations of the rate constants. These calculations indicate that for n) 1 - 3 {{the region of the}} potential in the asymptotic reactant channel controls the reaction rate constants and that the loose-transition-state methods implemented in VARIFLEX provide the best estimates of the reaction rate constants. The reaction with n) 4 has a dynamical bottleneck that lies near the saddle point and is best treated using the VTST methods implemented in POLYRATE. 1...|$|R
40|$|We {{have studied}} the {{influence}} of implicit solvent models, inclusion of explicit water molecules, inclusion of vibrational effects, and density functionals {{on the quality of}} the predicted pK a of small amino acid side chain models. We found that the inclusion of vibrational effects and explicit water molecules is crucial to improve the correlation between the computed and the experimental values. In these micro-solvated systems, the best agreement between DFT-computed <b>electronic</b> energies and <b>benchmark</b> values is afforded by BHHLYP and B 97 - 2. However, approaching experimental results requires the addition of more than three explicit water molecules, which generates new problems related to the presence of multiple minima in the potential energy surface. It thus appears that a satisfactory ab initio prediction of amino acid side chain pK a will require methods that sample the configurational space in the presence of large solvation shells, while at the same time computing vibrational contributions to the enthalpy and entropy of the system under study in all points of that surface. Pending development of efficient algorithms for those computations, we strongly suggest that whenever counterintuitive protonation states are found in a computational study (e. g., the presence of a neutral aspartate/neutral histidine dyad instead of a deprotonated aspartate/protonated histidine pair), the reaction profile should be computed under each of the different protonation micro-states by constraining the relevant N–H or O–H bonds, in order to avoid artifacts inherent to the complex nature of the factors contributing to the pK a...|$|R
40|$|This work {{investigates the}} {{unimolecular}} dissociation of the 2 -buten- 2 -yl radical. This radical has three potentially competing reaction pathways: C-C fission to form CH 3 + propyne, C-H fission to form H + 1, 2 -butadiene, and C-H fission to produce H + 2 -butyne. The experiments {{were designed to}} probe the branching to the three unimolecular dissociation pathways of the radical and to test theoretical predictions of the relevant dissociation barriers. Our crossed laser-molecular beam studies show that 193 nm photolysis of 2 -chloro- 2 -butene produces 2 -buten- 2 -yl in the initial photolytic step. A minor C-Cl bond fission channel forms electronically excited 2 -buten- 2 -yl radicals and the dominant C-Cl bond fission channel produces ground-state 2 -buten- 2 -yl radicals {{with a range of}} internal energies that spans the barriers to dissociation of the radical. Detection of the stable 2 -buten- 2 -yl radicals allows a determination of the translational, and therefore internal, energy that marks the onset of dissociation of the radical. The experimental determination of the lowest-energy dissociation barrier gave 31 (2 kcal/mol, in agreement with the 32. 8 (2 kcal/mol barrier to C-C fission at the G 3 //B 3 LYP level of theory. Our experiments detected products of all three dissociation channels of unstable 2 -buten- 2 -yl as well as a competing HCl elimination channel in the photolysis of 2 -chloro- 2 -butene. The results allow us to <b>benchmark</b> <b>electronic</b> structure calculations on the unimolecular dissociation reactions of the 2 -buten- 2 -yl radical as well as the CH 3 + propyne and H + 1, 2 -butadiene bimolecular reactions. They also allow us to critique prior experimental work on the H + 1, 2 -butadiene reaction...|$|R
40|$|The {{chemistry}} of actinides {{in aqueous solution}} is important, and {{it is essential to}} build adequate conceptual models and develop methods applicable for actinide systems. The complex <b>electronic</b> structure makes <b>benchmarking</b> necessary. In the thesis a prototype reaction of the water exchange reaction for uranyl(VI), for both ground and luminescent states, described with a six-water model, was used to study the applicability of density functional methods on actinides and different solvation models. An excellent agreement between the wave function methods CCSD(T) and MP 2 was obtained in the ground state, implying that near-minimal CASPT 2 can be used with conﬁdence for the reaction in the luminescent state of uranyl(VI), while density functionals are not suited to describe energetics for this type of reaction. There was an ambiguity concerning the position of the waters in the second hydration sphere. This issue was resolved by investigating a larger model, and prop- erly used the six-water model was found to adequately describe the water exchange reaction. The effect of solvation was investigated by comparing the results from conductor-like polarizable continuum models using two cavity models. Scattered numbers made it difficult to determine which solvation model to use. The ﬁnal conclusion was that the water exchange reaction in the luminescent state of uranyl(VI) should be addressed with near-minimal CASPT 2 and a solvation model without explicit cavities for hydrogens. Finally it was shown that no new chemistry appears in the luminescent state for this reaction. The thesis includes a methodological investigation of a multi-reference density functional method based on a range separation of the two-electron interaction. The method depends on a universal parameter, which has been determined for lighter elements. It is shown here that the same parameter could be used for actinides, a prerequisite for further development of the method. The results are in that sense promising...|$|R
40|$|As XML {{becomes the}} {{standard}} for <b>electronic</b> data interchange, <b>benchmarks</b> are needed to provide the comparative performance analysis of XML management systems (XMLMS). Typically a benchmark should adhere to four criteria: relevance, portability, scalability and simplicity [1]. The data structure of a benchmark for XML must be complex enough to capture the characteristics of XML data representation. Data sets should be in various sizes. Benchmark queries should only be defined with the primitives of the language. XML models present similarities with object-oriented data models. While XML is able to handle semi-structured data, it supports most {{of the features of}} complex object models. Classes, methods and inheritance are not defined in XML but classes can be expressed through element types and attributes. Thus in developing a benchmark for XML, we decided to use the well-established OO 7 benchmark [3] designed for object-oriented database management system as a starting point. The XOO 7 benchmark, an XML version of the OO 7 benchmark, is a singleuser based benchmark for XMLMS that focuses on the query processing aspect of XML. The DTD and data set of XOO 7 are directly obtained by mapping the OO 7 schema and data set to XML [4]. OO 7 does not model any specific application, but it intends to capture the characteristics of an object-oriented database. Additionally, in order to cater for the document centric view of XML, we extended the document object of OO 7 to contain sub-elements mixed with text data. Thus, the Document element provides for a liberal use of free-form text that is &quot;marked up &quot; with elements. Therefore the XOO 7 data set can capture all the characteristics of typical XML database applications. We provide a parameterized program to generate XML databases of various sizes and characteristics. The XOO 7 benchmark also extends and modifies the eight OO 7 queries with a set of twenty-three queries. XOO 7 provides relational, document and navigational queries that are specific and critical for XML databas...|$|R
40|$|Note {{sequence}} morphing is {{the combination}} of two note sequences to create a ‘hybrid transition’, or ‘morph’. The morph is a ‘hybrid’ {{in the sense that}} it exhibits properties of both sequences. The morph is also a ‘transition’, in that it can segue between them. An automated and interactive approach allows manipulation in realtime by users who may control the relative influence of source or target and the transition length. The techniques that were developed through this research were designed particularly for popular genres of predominantly instrumental electronic music which I will refer to collectively as Mainstream Electronic Music (MEM). The research has potential for application within contexts such as computer games, multimedia, live electronic music, interactive installations and accessible music or “music therapy”. Musical themes in computer games and multimedia can morph adaptively in response to parameters in realtime. Morphing can be used by electronic music producers as an alternative to mixing in live performance. Interactive installations and accessible music devices can utilise morphing algorithms to enable expressive control over the music through simple interface components. I have developed a software application called LEMorpheus which consists of software infrastructure for morphing and three alternative note sequence morphing algorithms: parametric morphing, probabilistic morphing and evolutionary morphing. Parametric morphing involves converting the source and target into continuous envelopes, interpolation, and converting the interpolated envelopes back into note sequences. Probabilistic morphing involves converting the source and target into probability matrices and seeding them on recent output to generate the next note. Evolutionary morphing involves iteratively mutating the source into multiple possible candidates and selecting those which are judged as more similar to the target, until the target is reached. I formally evaluated the probabilistic morphing algorithm by extracting qualitative feedback from participants in a live <b>electronic</b> music situation, <b>benchmarked</b> against a live, professional DJ. The probabilistic algorithm was competitive, being favoured particularly for long morphs. The evolutionary morphing algorithm was formally evaluated using an online questionnaire, benchmarked against a human composer/producer. For particular samples, the morphing algorithm was competitive and occasionally seen as innovative; however, the morphs created by the human composer typically received more positive feedback, due to coherent, large scale structural changes, as opposed to the forced continuity of the morphing software...|$|R
40|$|Thesis (MBA) [...] University of Stellenbosch, 2010. The {{world is}} {{constantly}} changing, {{creating a new}} environment and challenging businesses, societies and countries with unpredictable and volatile economic currents on a global scale. The new economy is the big second wave of change that will {{stay with us for}} the next century. People and organisations that want to participate in the new economy have to adapt to the new rules of the game or become extinct. Speed, agility, reliability, knowledge and networking globally are some of the skills necessary to survive, in this changed world. Values and strategy execution are critical elements in the quest to become a high-performing organisation in the new economy. Strategy in organisations is the creation of a unique and valuable position, involving a different set of activities. Whilst a brilliant strategy can put you on the map, only a solid execution process will keep you on the map and competitive. Most organisations set the vision and strategy, but do not set the operational requirements executing the strategic objectives. The new economy represents a historic shift in values, a new paradigm from which people in organisations cannot separate themselves if they want to stay relevant in the new economy. Transforming organisational values from the old economy to the new economy is a challenge – primarily a leadership challenge. Absa (Amalgamated Banks of South Africa), a leading financial services organisation in South Africa and part of the global financial service group, Barclays, offers life insurance to its customers, through its subsidiary Absa Life. Absa Life is the target audience for this research study. In the group, Absa Life contributes almost six per cent to the total earnings of the Absa Group. The organisation embarked on a strategy, in 2008 to become a top-five life insurer in South Africa by 2012. ‘Big hairy audacious goals’ (BHAG’s) were set and the 230 members of the Absa Life team at the time bought into the vision and strategy. For Absa Life to reach the stretched goals the leadership team has to take note of important elements of a high-performance organisation. This research study assesses the current value profile of Absa Life, the organisation. The researcher utilises an instrument, the Beehive questionnaire, developed by the Village Leadership Consulting for the value profile assessment. A valid sample, including all job levels and divisions in Absa Life formed the target audience for this questionnaire. The questionnaire (<b>electronic</b> survey format) <b>benchmarks</b> the Absa Life value profile against the old and new economy value profiles. The researcher uses the results of the Beehive questionnaire and the Evolution to Excellence framework, to highlight the organisational and leadership challenges and recommend best practices for Absa Life leadership team. The Absa Life leadership team will determine their readiness, embracing these challenges and will be the team that is responsible for the survival of Absa Life in the 21 st century or not...|$|R
40|$|Abstract {{copyright}} UK Data Service {{and data}} collection copyright owner. This project evaluated {{the use of the}} internet by political organisations (parties, interest groups, trade unions and new social movements) to promote participation in two dimensions: increasing vs. decreasing participation: examining whether the internet will increase rates of political participation and attract new citizens into the political process, or lead to greater marginalisation and exclusion of existing non-participants; enhancing vs. reducing the quality of participation: analysing whether electronic participation increases political interest and efficacy, enhances elite accountability, or, due to the impersonal nature of online communication, it reduces the significance of participation. Overall the research contributed to debates about social inclusion and exclusion in political participation and the role and health of political organisations in the UK. In particular it assessed what types of political organisation are best suited to exploiting the new media. Objectives: to develop established theoretical models of political participation by incorporating the role of technology in mobilising citizens; to establish how far the internet is used by political organisations to promote political participation; to develop a new methodology to operationalise and measure the participatory aspects of political organisations' web sites; to create a series of new data sets; to provide guidelines for the most effective usages of new ICTs by political organisations to promote participation. Implications: theoretical: the research updates models of participation and democracy; and sheds more light on the social shaping vs. technological deterministic approaches; empirical: an over time assessment of the attitudinal and behavioural orientation of the UK public towards <b>electronic</b> participation; a <b>benchmark</b> for assessing further innovations; methodological: methodological innovations such as the development of a web site's coding scheme; practical: the research offers suggestions for web site designers and organisations' officials as to the most effective methods of promoting participation via new ICTs. Main Topics : The dataset contains material collected from different sources using a variety of methods. It is composed of five types of data: 1) content analyses of the web sites of 29 political organisations, to assess the extent and nature of online participation, at four data points in the course of 18 months; 2) email surveys of organisational elites and key IT personnel in the same organisation in order to gauge the attitude and importance of internet participation strategies, problems and benefits; 3) semi-structured interviews with organisational elites in a sub-sample of the organisations most dependent on the internet, to understand internet participation strategies, problems and benefits; (Only three sample interviews were deposited) 4) membership surveys, both online and postal, with five political organisations (two parties, one trade union and two pressure groups), which gauge the levels of organisational participation and political participation by the respective members; 5) an opinion survey of the British public, to evaluate citizen awareness and usage of the internet for political purposes and to gather a profile of users. Standard Measures: British Marketers Association social grade in the NOP public opinion survey; a shortened Hope-Goldthorpe for all membership surveys; ethnic background from the BES in the membership surveys; five point Likert scales wherever possible in all surveys. <br...|$|R
