The <b>HAMA</b> <b>response</b> is essentially an allergic reaction to the mouse antibodies that can range from a mild form, like a rash, to a more extreme and life-threatening response, such as renal failure.

MethodA total of 15 eligible patients, with histologically proven adenocarcinoma of the stomach or gastro-oesophageal junction, who had undergone resection to remove the primary tumour mass, {{were enrolled in the}} study. Eight patients were treated with the study drug and 7 of patients were enrolled into the standard care control arm. Materials and ResultsMean blood radioactivity peaked between 36 and 48 hours, with a mean peak value of approximately 15 % ID. Data previously reported on intraperitoneal Y-HMFG 1 treatment of patients with ovarian cancer show peak values of 25 – 35 % ID seen at 48 hour post-injection. The present results require confirmation in a large population of gastric cancer patients, but suggest that the transfer of radioactivity into the blood pool is decreased compared with the ovarian cancer patients.

30|$|Full-sized Abs need to {{overcome}} some obstacles before penetrating into a tumor. Although big molecules {{are able to}} extravasate out of the ‘leaky vessels’ near the tumor, penetration of Abs into the tumor can still be hampered by some physiological barriers, such as high interstitial pressure and a ‘binding site barrier’ [15, 16]. In order to improve the penetration within tumor masses, fragments of mAb 14 C 5 have been created and evaluated. In vitro and in vivo studies demonstrated the efficient tumor targeting properties of murine 131 I-Fab and 131 I-F(ab') 2 14 C 5 fragments [17]. Despite the promising pre-clinical results, the clinical application of Ab 14 C 5 and its derivatives could be hampered due to its murine origin. The development of a human anti-mouse Ab (<b>HAMA)</b> <b>response</b> can result in tachyphylaxis, i.e., reduced therapeutic effect caused by reduced targeting of the murine Ab due to immune complex formation after repetitive administration of the Ab. More severe, but rare, side effects of a <b>HAMA</b> <b>response</b> can range from hypersensitivity to life-threatening anaphylactic reactions [18, 19]. In order to diminish the risk of generating a <b>HAMA</b> <b>response</b> after Ab-based therapy and thus avoid the associated disadvantages, the murine Ab sequence is made to better resemble human Abs. Chimerization is the first major step towards a humanized molecule and includes the substitution of the mouse heavy and light constant regions with human Ab counterparts [20, 21].|$|E

Although CEA expression appears to be similar between our xenografts and the majority of human pancreas cancer specimens, data from xenograft models are limited secondary to lack of a competent immune system. Historically, the majority of murine monoclonal antibodies have failed to be translated to the clinical setting because of the human anti-mouse antibody (<b>HAMA)</b> <b>response.</b> This resulted in the advent of chimeric antibodies with murine variable regions (VL and Vh) and human constant domains (CH 2 and CH 3) as well as humanized and fully human antibodies.

40|$|Current {{therapeutic}} approaches {{against the}} advanced stages of human solid tumors are palliative rather than curative. Many modalities, including, surgery, radiation, and chemotherapy, either {{alone or in}} combination have met with only modest success for advanced metastatic cancers. Radioimmunotherapy (RIT) combines the specificity of monoclonal antibodies with cytotxic effects of radioisotopes. It is the �smart� way of delivering radiation to the known and occult metastatic cancer cells and is independent of drug toxicity and/or hormone resistance. The tumor associated glycoprotein- 72 (TAG- 72) containing the unique disaccharide sialyl-Tn, is highly expressed in majority of adenocarcinomas, including carcinomas of the prostate, breast, ovaries, pancreas and colon (80 - 90 %) compared to undetectable expression in normal tissues. Monoclonal antibody CC 49, reactive with TAG- 72, after conjugation to potent gamma- and beta-emitting radionuclides, has been useful in selective systemic radiolocalization of disease and therapy of primary and metastatic tumor sites. However, limited therapeutic responses were observed in patients. Limited success of antibody based delivery of radioisotopes {{can be attributed to}} several factors including undesirable pharmacokinetics, poor tumor uptake and high immunogenicity of intact antibodies (IgGs). The primary factors contributing towards the failure of RIT include: 1) longer serum half-lives of the intact IgG molecules resulting in the radiotoxicity, 2) generation of human antibodies against murine antibodies (HAMA) that limits the frequency of dose administration, 3) poor diffusion rates of intact IgG due to the large size and 4) high interstitial fluid pressures (IFP) encountered in solid tumors. The major goal of our multidisciplinary project was to develop specific novel radiopharmaceuticals, with desired pharmacokinetics, for the diagnosis and therapy of solid tumors. To overcome the low uptake of radioactivity by tumors and to increase its tumor: normal tissue ratio for improved therapeutic index, we engineered a variety antibody constructs. These constructs were evaluated using novel approaches like special radionuclides, pretargeting and optimization. Due to the smaller size, the engineered antibody molecules should penetrate better throughout a tumor mass, with less dose heterogeneity, than is the case with intact IgG. Multivalent scFvs with an appropriate radionuclide, therefore, hold promising prospects for cancer therapy and clinical imaging in MAb-based radiopharmaceuticals. In addition, the human anti-mouse antibodies (<b>HAMA)</b> <b>responses</b> in patients against antibody-based therapy are usually directed against the immunoglobulin constant regions; however, anti-idiotypic responses can also be detected. The <b>HAMA</b> <b>responses</b> reduce the efficacy of treatment by removing the circulating antibody molecules, fragments, and possibly scFvs by altering the pharmacokinetic properties of the antibody. <b>HAMA</b> <b>responses</b> against divalent IgG, divalent Ig fragments, and possibly multimeric scFvs could cause immune complex formation with hypersensitivity or allergic reactions that could be harmful to patients. The use of small molecules, such as scFvs (monomeric as well as multimeric), with their shorter biological half-lives and the lack of the constant regions and humanized variable (binding regions) performed in our studies should reduce the development of HAMA. The generation of humanized and fully human scFvs should further reduce the development of HAMA. Specific accomplishments on the project are the production of large amounts of recombinant antibodies as they are required in large amounts for cancer diagnosis and therapy. A variety of single-chain Fv (scFv) constructs were engineered for the desired pharmacokinetic properties. Tetrameric and dimeric scFvs showed a two-fold advantage: (1) there was a considerable gain in avidity as compared to smaller fragments, and (2) the biological half-life was more compatible with RIT and RIS requirements. For RIT, delivery for sc(Fv) 2 and [sc(Fv) 2] 2 in a fractionated schedule clearly presented a therapeutic advantage over single administration. The treatment group receiving tetravalent scFv showed a statistically significant prolonged survival with both single and fractionated administrations. 99 mTc-labeled multivalent scFvs show good tumor targeting characteristics with high radiolocalization indices (tumor:background ratio). Macroautoradiography performed at 6 and 16 h post administration of labeled 99 mTc-sc(Fv) 2 and 99 mTc-[sc(Fv) 2] clearly detected the tumors in mice.

40|$|While {{monoclonal}} antibodies show {{promise for}} use in the treatment of a variety of disease states, including cancer, autoimmune disease, and allograft rejection, generation of anti-antibody responses still remains a problem. For example, 50 % of the patients who receive OKT 3 produce blocking antibodies that interfere with its binding to T cells, thus decreasing the therapeutic effect (51). <b>HAMA</b> <b>responses</b> have also interfered with tumor imaging (39, 40) and radioimmunotherapy (56). The generation of an anti-antibody response is dependent on many factors. These include the dose of antibody, the number of injections of antibody, the immunogenicity of the antibody, the form of the antibody, and the immunocompetence of the recipient. Predictably, both the number of injections of antibody and the dosage are influential in the generation of an anti-antibody response. It is apparent that human antibodies, chimeric antibodies, and mouse Fab fragments are much less likely to induce anti-antibody responses than intact mouse monoclonal antibodies or mouse F(ab') 2 fragments when one injection is administered. Injections of human or chimeric antibodies appears to reduce immunogenicity, but the probability that anti-antibody responses can still be induced on multiple injections must be considered and appropriately evaluated. Several areas demand extensive investigation to enhance the clinical utility of monoclonal antibodies. First, results of thorough clinical trials with human or chimeric antibodies need to be evaluated for the induction of anti-antibodies after multiple injections of antibodies. Second, less immunogenic forms of antibodies (Fab, Fv) need to be studied for their clinical efficacies and for their abilities to induce anti-antibody responses...|$|R

Complementarity-determining region grafting could decrease immunogenicity further but often results in reduced affinity or specificity for the target antigen. Safeguarding the desired characteristics involves several labor-intensive trial-and-error approaches [29, 30]. Integrin αvβ 5 expression is involved in several crucial steps of cancer progression such as cell adhesion, angiogenesis, and metastasis [31, 32]. Overexpression of αvβ 5 has been demonstrated not only on several tumor types, but also on non-transformed tumor-promoting cells from the tumor stroma, such as cancer-associated fibroblasts [33] and cells from the neovasculature [11, 14, 34]. These accessory cells are less likely to lose antigen expression, making αvβ 5 a very attractive target for Ab-based RID and/or RIT.

HAMA positive sera were obtained from seven patients with colorectal cancer, pancreas cancer, malignant melanoma or myocardial infarction who had previously received radiolabelled MoAbs. The nature of HAMA was analysed using size exclusion high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) after incubating with radiolabelled MoAbs including IgG, Fab or human/mouse chimeric Abs. Immune complexes composed of HAMA and MoAbs were formed. The percentage of radioactivity with a high molecular weight was related to HAMA levels determined by enzyme linked immunosorbent assay. Most radioactivity present in immune complex shifted to the antibody fraction after the addition of normal murine serum. All of seven sera were reactive with all four murine IgGs and this suggests that HAMA in these patients recognised the constant region of MoAbs. In one patient, HAMA was considered to recognise the variable region and to be anti-idiotypic. There was no significant binding with human/mouse chimeric Abs in any HAMA positive serum, although five out of seven patients were reactive with murine MoAb Fab, indicating that HAMA was composed of Abs responsive to the CH 1 or CL region of murine IgG. These results suggest that (1) HAMA was composed of Ab responsive to Fc portion and/or CH 1 or CL region of murine IgG, and (2) human/mouse chimeric Abs look promising in the repeated infusion of MoAb in HAMA positive patients...|$|E
40|$|Chimeric, humanized {{and human}} {{antibodies}} have successively been exploited as therapeutics because their increasing human (‘self’) character {{is expected to}} correspond with decreased immunogenicity, critical for their clinical development. Thus humanness has been inferred to predict antibody immunogenicity. Humanness of antibody variable (V) regions has recently been studied using a parameter (here {{referred to as the}} H-score) which evaluates similarity to expressed human sequences. Macaque (Macaca fascic-ularis) antibody sequences are of particular interest because they have been suggested to have extremely human-like character and recently macaque scFvs of very high affinity against various antigens have been isolated. In this study, the H-scores of all macaque antibody V-regions available in sequence databanks were compared with those of their human counterparts using statistical tests. The results were found to be influenced by the relative size of the human families to which the macaque V-regions are related. As the relevance of families to immunogenicity is suspected but unproven, a new parameter (the ‘G-score’) was derived from the H-score to avoid this influence and macaque V-regions sequences were re-analyzed using the G-score. Both parameters show that these regions cannot be regarded as human when they derive from heavy chains, but the humanness of light chains is variable. It was shown that ‘germline humanization ’ of a macaque V-region favourably influenced its humanness as evaluated by both H- and G-scores.

We generated a chimeric version of the OC/TR mAb to decrease the immunogenicity of the OC/TR mAb and to allow more extended treatment schedules. Sp 2 / 0 myeloma cells were transfected with chimeric heavy- and light-chain genes encoding the anti-CD 3 mAb and the MOv 18 mAb, respectively, which are reactive with FBP. The resulting cell line produced 80 micrograms/ml of total immunoglobulin G (IgG), of which 11. 5 % was the functionally active chimeric OC/TR mAb. Chimeric OC/TR F(ab') 2 fragments mediated lysis of IGROV- 1 ovarian carcinoma cells by human T cells at antibody concentrations of > or = 1 pg/ml. Specific lysis was still detectable at an effector-to-target cell ratio as low as 0. 4. Two patients with ovarian carcinoma treated with F(ab') 2 fragments of the murine OC/TR developed distinct HAMA titers, which were mainly anti-idiotypic and only partly directed against the murine antibody constant regions. However, of the two patients that were treated with the F(ab') 2 fragments of the chimeric OC/TR mAb, only one developed a low transient <b>HAMA</b> <b>response</b> just above background level. In conclusion, the generation of chimeric OC/TR may allow more extended clinical studies of bispecific mAb-mediated immunotherapy of ovarian carcinom...|$|E
40|$|Murine IgG 3 anti-GD 2 {{antibody}} m 3 F 8 {{has shown}} anti-neuroblastoma activity in Phase I/II studies, where antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity (ADCC) {{played a key}} role. Humanization of m 3 F 8 should circumvent human anti-mouse antibody (<b>HAMA)</b> <b>response</b> and enhance its ADCC properties to reduce dosing and pain side effect. Chimeric 3 F 8 (ch 3 F 8) and humanized 3 F 8 (hu 3 F 8 -IgG 1 and hu 3 F 8 -IgG 4) were produced and purified by protein A affinity chromatography. In vitro comparison was made with m 3 F 8 and other anti-GD 2 antibodies in binding, cytotoxicity, and cross-reactivity assays. In GD 2 binding studies by SPR, ch 3 F 8 and hu 3 F 8 maintained KD comparable to m 3 F 8. Unlike other anti-GD 2 antibodies, m 3 F 8, ch 3 F 8 and hu 3 F 8 had substantially slower koff [...] Similar to m 3 F 8, both ch 3 F 8 and hu 3 F 8 inhibited tumor cell growth in vitro, while cross-reactivity with other gangliosides was {{comparable to that of}} m 3 F 8. Both peripheral blood mononuclear cell (PBMC) -ADCC and polymorphonuclear leukocytes (PMN) -ADCC of ch 3 F 8 and hu 3 F 8 -IgG 1 were more potent than m 3 F 8. This superiority was consistently observed in ADCC assays, irrespective of donors or NK- 92 MI-transfected human CD 16 or CD 32, whereas complement mediated cytotoxicity (CMC) was reduced. As expected, hu 3 F 8 -IgG 4 had near absent PBMC-ADCC and CMC. Hu 3 F 8 and m 3 F 8 had similar tumor-to-non tumor ratios in biodistribution studies. Anti-tumor effect against neuroblastoma xenografts was better with hu 3 F 8 -IgG 1 than m 3 F 8. In conclusion, humanizing m 3 F 8 produced next generation anti-GD 2 antibodies with substantially more potent ADCC in vitro and anti-tumor activity in vivo. By leveraging ADCC over CMC, they may be clinically more effective, while minimizing pain and HAMA side effects. A Phase I trial using hu 3 F 8 -IgG 1 is ongoing...|$|E
5000|$|Hamas and Fatah claimed joint {{responsibility}} for the attack and stated that the attack {{was carried out by}} two 18-year-olds from the Jabalya refugee camp in the Gaza Strip. The two assailants managed to infiltrate Israel from Gaza by hiding in a container that went through the Karni Crossing. A Hamas leader in Gaza stated that the original plan was that the suicide bombers would blow up fuel tanks at the port; Israel said the bombers intended to carry out a [...] "mega attack" [...] with hundreds of casualties, but instead blew themselves up hundreds of meters from the tanks. Later on it was revealed that the attack was financed and directed by Nizar Rayan.

We respect the Arab efforts to attain Palestinian rights and we will act within the Arab consensus.

[...] Haaretz sources in Palestine state that Hamas wanted to oppose the initiative outright but did not do so because it did not want to break with the Saudi Arabian government.
