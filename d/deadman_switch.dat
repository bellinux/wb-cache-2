The EDS is also intended to automatically trigger the <b>deadman</b> <b>switch,</b> which closes the BOP, kill and choke valves. The EDS may be a subsystem of the BOP stack’s control pods or separate.|$|E
50|$|In this {{spin off}} of the online game, the Joker tires of his {{unsuccessful}} fight with Batman, and decides to attack Superman. He and Harley Quinn kill Jimmy Olsen and abduct Lois Lane (who is pregnant with Superman's child). They place a stolen nuclear warhead within Metropolis, with a <b>deadman</b> <b>switch</b> wired to Lois. After exposing Superman to Kryptonite laced fear toxin (stolen from the Scarecrow), Superman mistakes Lois for Doomsday and kills her. Metropolis is destroyed in the subsequent nuclear detonation. A grief-filled and vengeful Superman then goes to confront the captured Joker, who states that'll he'll escape to commit more crimes to top of this. Enraged, Superman kills the Joker {{and goes on to}} establish the Regime, intent on eliminating crime through any means necessary.|$|E

40|$|Biocontainment {{systems that}} couple {{environmental}} sensing with circuit-based control of cell viability {{could be used}} to prevent escape of genetically modified microbes into the environment. Here we present two engineered safeguard systems known as the 'Deadman' and 'Passcode' kill <b>switches.</b> The <b>Deadman</b> kill <b>switch</b> uses unbalanced reciprocal transcriptional repression to couple a specific input signal with cell survival. The Passcode kill switch uses a similar two-layered transcription design and incorporates hybrid LacI-GalR family transcription factors to provide diverse and complex environmental inputs to control circuit function. These synthetic gene circuits efficiently kill Escherichia coli and can be readily reprogrammed to change their environmental inputs, regulatory architecture and killing mechanism. United States.

50|$|On 30 April, the House Committee on Energy and Commerce asked Halliburton {{to brief}} {{it as well}} as provide any {{documents}} it might have related to its work on the Macondo well. Attention has focused on the cementing procedure and the blowout preventer, which failed to fully engage. A number of significant problems were identified with the blowout preventer: There was a leak in the hydraulic system that provides power to the shear rams. The underwater control panel had been disconnected from the pipe ram, and instead connected to a test ram. The blowout preventer schematic drawings, provided by Transocean to BP, did not correspond to the structure that was on the ocean bottom. The shear rams were not designed to function on the joints where the drill pipes were screwed together or on tools that were passed through the blowout preventer during well construction. The explosion may have severed the communication line between the rig and the sub-surface blowout preventer control unit such that the blowout preventer would have never received the instruction to engage. Before the backup dead man's switch could engage, communications, power and hydraulic lines must all be severed, but it is possible hydraulic lines were intact after the explosion. Of the two control pods for the <b>deadman</b> <b>switch,</b> the one that was inspected had a dead battery. Employee Tyrone Benton told the BBC on 21 June that a leak was spotted on a crucial piece of equipment in the oil rig's blowout preventer weeks before the accident, and that Transocean and BP were emailed about it.|$|E
5000|$|Nathan Bates, {{played by}} Lane Smith, is the power-hungry head of Science Frontiers. He is {{cautious}} by nature, {{but has a}} high intelligence and shrewd cunning that he has used to make {{him one of the}} most powerful industrialists in the country. He is the father of Kyle Bates. His power bloomed even further when Science Frontiers was contracted by Resistance leader Julie Parrish to mass-produce the [...] "Red Dust", the weapon used to drive the Visitors from the Earth. His power increases to the point his company is contracted to study the captured Visitor Mothership, with Julie Parrish, now head of Science Frontiers science division and Nathan's one-sided love interest, leading the team. Science Frontiers, at Nathan's urging, also conducted further experimentation on the Red Dust, and discovered the horrifying secret that it doesn't work in 50% of the world due to different climate zones. Nathan hired Ham Tyler for £500,000 to capture Diana, whom he hoped to interrogate for technical information on the Mothership, a cure for cancer and other advancements. However, Diana escaped and launched the Second Invasion after calling back the Visitor Fleet. When Diana and her troops stormed the main Science Frontiers facility, Bates is able to bluff them into not killing him by threatening to unleash a massive dose of Red Dust. This was achieved by the use of a <b>deadman</b> <b>switch</b> that would trigger the Red Dust if Bates was killed. After Nathan successfully brokered a peace treaty with the Visitor armies that Los Angeles and all property of Science Frontiers would be protected in exchange Science Frontiers security personnel would keep order. This made Nathan {{one of the most powerful}} men in the world, as the head of a provisional government of Los Angeles with the title of Governor, which was also arranged to be a neutral zone called [...] "The Open City", where neither human nor Visitor could bear arms. Following the collapse of all military and police forces, his army grew and took larger control of civilian life. Nathan adapted his nature to become ruthless and cold-blooded when necessary, and became increasingly dangerous when the Resistance took shape again and launched terrorist activities against the Visitors from inside his protective borders, becoming mortal enemies with Mike Donovan and falling out with Kyle, who had joined the Resistance. Time and again, Nathan schemed with the Visitors, primarily Diana, to bring down the Resistance, and was constantly threatened by Diana to keep order or risk the end of the Open City Agreement and subsequent invasion. Nathan became more determined to destroy the Resistance, as he saw them as a threat to his power and the safety of Los Angeles' population, and agreed with Charles, a special envoy from the Leader, to make a daring trap to brainwash Ham Tyler into assassinating Mike Donovan during a live prisoner exchange, hoping to use this as a way to discredit the Resistance. However, Bates was accidentally shot instead and, despite being rushed to the medical facilities at Science Frontiers, goes into a coma. While in his weakened state, Mr. Chiang used a computer simulation of Bates to create the illusion that his master was still awake and in power, all the while Chiang was being tempted by Diana and Charles to take control of Science Frontiers himself. When Nathan finally came out of his coma and Kyle tried to rescue him, Charles finally convinced Chiang to grab power for himself by assassinating Nathan. Chiang successfully intercepts the two men just as they are about to escape, and shoots Nathan twice in the chest, killing him, and his last words were for Kyle, with whom he had a last-minute reconciliation, to escape alive. The death of Nathan Bates resulted in the end of the Open City Agreement and subsequent devastation of Los Angeles several days later by the Visitors.|$|E
40|$|A portable, dynamic {{pressure}} calibrator was fabricated {{for use on}} wind tunnel models at NASA-Ames Research Center. The calibrator generates sine wave pressures at levels up to 1 PSIG P-P(168 dB) at frequencies from 10 Hz to 6 KHz and. 5 PSIG P. P (162 dB) at frequencies from 6 KHz to 20 KHz. The calibrator consists of two units connected by a single cable. The handheld unit contains a pressure transducer, speaker, and <b>deadman</b> <b>switch.</b> This unit allows application of {{dynamic pressure}} to transducers/ports on installed wind tunnel models.
