40|$|A {{total of}} 156 {{finishing}} pigs (72 barrows and 84 gilts, initially 110 lb) {{were used to}} determine the effects on growth performance of increasing meat and <b>bone</b> <b>meal.</b> Pigs were housed in an environmentally regulated finishing building, with two pigs per pen. There were six pens of barrows and seven pens of gilts per treatment. Pigs were blocked by initial weight and sex, and then allotted to one of six dietary treatments. The dietary treatments were based on corn-soybean meal, were formulated on a true-ileal-digestible (TID) lysine basis, and were fed in three phases. In each phase, diets contained 0, 2. 5, 5. 0, 7. 5, 10. 0, or 12. 5 % porcine meat and <b>bone</b> <b>meal.</b> The diets were formulated to 0. 85, 0. 70, and 0. 57 % TID lysine in phases 1, 2, and 3, respectively, slightly less than the pig’s anticipated requirements, so that if the amino acid digestibility of meat and <b>bone</b> <b>meal</b> was different than typical values, changes in growth performance could be observed. Increasing meat and <b>bone</b> <b>meal</b> increased ADG (quadratic, P< 0. 02), decreased ADFI (linear, P< 0. 02), and improved F/G (quadratic, P< 0. 01).

40|$|The {{purpose of}} the study was to examine if {{different}} types of <b>bone</b> <b>meal</b> can absorb heavy metals from a synthetic metal solution. Four kinds of metals were studied. They were cadmium (Cd) in the form of cadmium chloride, lead (Pb) in the form of lead nitrate, mercury (Hg) in the form of mercuric nitrate dehydrate and chromium in the form of chromium chloride hex hydrate. Three different sorts of <b>bone</b> <b>meal</b> were examined; they were calcium phosphate (CAP <b>meal),</b> meat and <b>bone</b> <b>meal</b> (MBM) and decanter cake (DC). All the meal-types had in common that they reduce heavy metals very well. Generally cadmium and lead are reduced better at around 99 percent, while the reduction for mercury and chromium is somewhat lower, between 90 and 99 percent. The reduction is of course dependent on how the test is carried out and which <b>bone</b> <b>meal</b> is used. The binding is best explained by three mechanisms depending on which metal that is bound. The binding can occur though an ion-exchange mechanism, an adsorption mechanism or through binding to the proteins in the <b>bone</b> <b>meal.</b> Most likely the binding of the different metals occurs through a combination of all these mechanisms. All the types of <b>bone</b> <b>meal</b> that were examined would work perfectly as a product for purifying for example sewage water. The CAP meal is the type of <b>bone</b> <b>meal</b> that has been examined most closely. The binding is fast and effective, bound metal is kept even after a long period of time and the <b>bone</b> <b>meal</b> also works fine at continuous operation. Even to MBM the binding is fast and effective. For DC the binding takes somewhat longer, but the reduction is in the end very good, especially when it comes to mercury, where the reduction is 99 percent...|$|R

The aim of this thesis was to screen microorganisms which can directly dissolve phosphate from the raw <b>bone</b> <b>meal</b> with no fat removal. The fat contained in raw <b>bone</b> <b>meal</b> {{is assumed to be}} the carbon source for the phosphate solubilizing microorganism. Aspergillus niger is evaluated as the only microorganism which meets the requiring that the microorganism can directly release the phosphorus from the raw <b>bone</b> <b>meal</b> of pig and goat, after screened 62 calcium phosphate solubilizing microorganisms from different resources. The main mechanism of A. niger dissolves the raw <b>bone</b> <b>meal</b> is the release of oxalic acid. In liquid media, A. niger dissolved more phosphate from the goat bone than from pig bone. The addition of extra nitrogen to lower the C/N ratio can improve the release of phosphate from goat bone, but no significant increase from pig bone. In pot experiment, although, the inoculation of A. niger increased soil available phosphate concentration of addition of all <b>bone</b> <b>meal</b> treatments, no positive effect of maize dry weight and phosphate uptake in maize shoot.
