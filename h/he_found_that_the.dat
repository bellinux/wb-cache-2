5|$|In the meantime, the Spartans {{had sent}} Dorkis to Byzantium {{with a small}} force, to take command of the Allied force. However, <b>he</b> <b>found</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> rest of the Allies were no longer {{prepared}} to accept Spartan leadership, and therefore returned home.|$|E
5|$|After {{reviewing}} Hamdan's habeas petition, Judge James Robertson of the United States District Court for the District of Columbia {{ruled in}} the detainee's favor. <b>He</b> <b>found</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> United States {{could not hold}} a military commission unless it was first shown that the detainee was not a prisoner of war.|$|E
5|$|Blake {{decided to}} compose his score {{to match the}} key of the Schubert Mass, {{in order for the}} music to {{continue}} seamlessly. However, during the recording session with his orchestra, the Sinfonia of London, <b>he</b> <b>found</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> Schubert piece was running slow and therefore flat, and he had to ask the players to tune flat to match his intended key.|$|E
50|$|Third, <b>he</b> <b>found</b> <b>that</b> if <b>the</b> {{suppressed}} material {{had been}} {{submitted to the}} Supreme Court, its decision {{probably would have been}} different.|$|R
50|$|In 1916, Jean George Bachmann {{conducted}} canine experiments. <b>He</b> <b>found</b> <b>that</b> clamping <b>the</b> muscular {{bundle of}} fibers <b>that</b> connects <b>the</b> atria caused a significant conduction delay.|$|R
60|$|Ned replied that, in America, <b>he</b> had <b>found</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> Spaniards {{insisted on}} all the natives at once {{embracing}} Christianity, on pain of death.|$|R
5|$|In 1912, Vesto Slipher made spectrographic {{studies of}} the {{brightest}} spiral nebulae to determine their composition. Slipher discovered that the spiral nebulae have high Doppler shifts, indicating that they are moving at a rate exceeding the velocity of the stars he had measured. <b>He</b> <b>found</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> majority of these nebulae are moving away from us.|$|E
5|$|In the late-1960s, Mikhail Ivanovich Budyko {{worked with}} simple {{two-dimensional}} energy-balance climate models {{to investigate the}} reflectivity of ice. <b>He</b> <b>found</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> ice-albedo feedback created a positive feedback loop in the Earth's climate system. The more snow and ice, the more solar radiation is reflected back into space and hence the colder Earth grows and the more it snows. Other studies found that pollution or a volcano eruption could provoke the onset of an ice age.|$|E
5|$|Allardyce {{wrote to}} every {{club in the}} top two {{divisions}} to inform them he was available on a free transfer, and privately lamented choosing his past clubs for financial rather than footballing reasons. Over the summer he played 11 games in the North American Soccer League for the Tampa Bay Rowdies, a club that shared facilities with the NFL's Tampa Bay Buccaneers. Allardyce subsequently applied in his managerial career many modern practices of American football with regards to training, player management and tactics. He found playing difficult however, due to {{the heat and the}} all-out attacking nature of his teammates, which led to him being frequently exposed at the back, though <b>he</b> <b>found</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> club's masseurs managed to cure a long-standing hamstring scar tissue problem.|$|E
60|$|But when {{he tried}} to execute his fell purpose <b>he</b> <b>found</b> <b>that</b> in <b>the</b> order of nature it was {{appointed}} that he himself perish miserably in the encounter.|$|R
30|$|McCraty et al. [4] {{related the}} {{mathematical}} transformation of {{heart rate variability}} with the power spectral density of speech. <b>He</b> <b>founded</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> positive emotions results in the alteration of heart rate variability. Kim et al. [5] developed a new emotion recognition system by processing different physiological parameters. The electrocardiogram, skin temperature and electrodermal activity were used as input signals. This particular system consisted of preprocessing, feature extraction and pattern classification stages. The characteristics of the emotion is identified from short-segment signals.|$|R
50|$|Justice Gonthier, {{writing for}} a {{unanimous}} Court, upheld the Criminal Code provisions. <b>He</b> <b>found</b> <b>that</b> requiring <b>the</b> complainant to testify would be unnecessarily invasive and would discourage victims from reporting such incidents.|$|R
5|$|Alvarado rested {{two days}} at Tazuzcalco, before {{proceeding}} to Miahuaclan, {{which had been}} abandoned by its inhabitants, then on to Atehuan (modern Ateos, near the Pipil city of Cuscatlan, capital of {{the province of the}} same name). Messengers from the lords of Cuscatlan brought promises of submission to the King of Spain, but when Pedro de Alvarado's army arrived at the city, <b>he</b> <b>found</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> majority of the inhabitants had fled. Alvarado sent messengers to them, ordering them to return and submit, but they refused. Alvarado tried them in their absence, and condemned them to death; he branded all the Pipil prisoners as slaves.|$|E
5|$|During Darius's Greek expedition, he {{had begun}} {{construction}} projects in Susa, Egypt and Persepolis. He had linked the Red Sea to the river Nile by building a canal (Darius Canal) which ran from modern Zaqāzīq to modern Suez. To open this canal, he travelled to Egypt in 497 BCE, where the inauguration was carried out with great fanfare and celebration. Darius also built a canal to connect the Red Sea and Mediterranean. On this visit to Egypt he erected monuments and executed Aryandes on the charge of treason. When Darius returned to Persis, <b>he</b> <b>found</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> codification of Egyptian law had been finished.|$|E
5|$|During a {{brilliant}} student {{career at the}} Conservatoire de Paris, Bizet won many prizes, including the prestigious Prix de Rome in 1857. He was recognised as an outstanding pianist, though {{he chose not to}} capitalise on this skill and rarely performed in public. Returning to Paris after almost three years in Italy, <b>he</b> <b>found</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> main Parisian opera theatres preferred the established classical repertoire to the works of newcomers. His keyboard and orchestral compositions were likewise largely ignored; as a result, his career stalled, and he earned his living mainly by arranging and transcribing the music of others. Restless for success, he began many theatrical projects during the 1860s, most of which were abandoned. Neither of his two operas that reached the stage in this time—Les pêcheurs de perles and La jolie fille de Perth—were immediately successful.|$|E

60|$|<b>He</b> <b>found</b> now <b>that</b> <b>the</b> sound {{proceeded}} {{from below}} the grating covering the basement window. He dropped his glance through the bars, {{and saw a}} child's white face.|$|R
5|$|Using {{this method}} of compounding, Dietrich <b>found</b> <b>that</b> {{approximately}} 120 'basic' characters {{can be used for}} over 1,500 combinations. <b>He</b> also <b>found</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> vast majority of the corpus consists of compounds.|$|R
5|$|Even though Kern {{intended}} for the character's morality to be left ambiguous and to the viewer's interpretation, a majority of television commentators characterized Christy as an antagonist. Brittany Spanos of Vulture.com determined that Christy was an evil witch due to her betrayal of Billie and the Charmed Ones, and SpoilerTV's Gavin Hetherington identified her as the season's big bad. In their book The Book of Three, authors Diana G. Gallagher and Paul Ruditis wrote that she served as the Triad's protégée. Ruditis followed this up in a later interview by calling Christy a pawn {{under the control of}} the Triad rather than a proper villain; <b>he</b> <b>found</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> series lacked a strong, female antagonist.|$|E
5|$|Fairley {{remained}} {{for less than}} a year before resigning to take up a five-year appointment in Bombay as Chair of Clinical Tropical Medicine at a newly created School of Tropical Medicine, a post for which he had been nominated by the Royal Society. On arrival in India, <b>he</b> <b>found</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> scheme had been abandoned and that as his appointment could be terminated at six-months' notice, he would no longer be required after October 1922. Fairley demanded and received an audience with the Governor of Bombay, Sir George Lloyd, the result of which was that the Secretary of State agreed to create a special five-year post of Medical Officer of the Bombay Bacteriological Laboratory and Honorary Consulting Physician to the Sir Jamshedjee Jeejebhoy Hospital and St George Hospital.|$|E
5|$|Gay {{caused a}} special study {{to be made}} of this action because he {{considered}} it so outstanding. <b>He</b> <b>found</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> 3d Battalion suffered 229 battle casualties in the first two hours. Of these, 38 troops were killed and 167 wounded, the remainder were attached South Koreans. The battalion aid station reported treating 130 casualties. Other wounded were treated at the 8th Cavalry aid station. Many men with minor wounds did not ask for medical attention until the battle had ended, and there were only five cases of combat shock in contrast to the eighteen on Hill 518. North Korean mortar fire caused 80 percent of the casualties.|$|E
5000|$|Kouparitsas {{considered}} the United States as divided into the eight {{regions of the}} Bureau of Economic Analysis, which are Far West, Rocky Mountain, Plains, Great Lakes, Mideast, New England, Southwest, and Southeast. [...] By developing a statistical model, <b>he</b> <b>found</b> <b>that</b> five of <b>the</b> eight {{regions of the country}} satisfied Mundell's criteria to form a single Optimal Currency Area. However, <b>he</b> <b>found</b> the fit of the Southeast and Southwest to be questionable. <b>He</b> also <b>found</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> Plains would not fit into an optimal currency area.|$|R

5|$|In 1876, Robert Koch (1843–1910) {{established}} that microorganisms can cause disease. <b>He</b> <b>found</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> blood of cattle which were infected with anthrax always had {{large numbers of}} Bacillus anthracis. Koch found that he could transmit anthrax from one animal to another by taking {{a small sample of}} blood from the infected animal and injecting it into a healthy one, and this caused the healthy animal to become sick. He also found that he could grow the bacteria in a nutrient broth, then inject it into a healthy animal, and cause illness. Based on these experiments, he devised criteria for establishing a causal link between a microorganism and a disease and these are now known as Koch's postulates. Although these postulates cannot be applied in all cases, they do retain historical importance to the development of scientific thought and are still being used today.|$|E
5|$|In July 1942, Browning {{travelled}} to the United States, {{where he}} toured airborne training facilities with his American counterpart, Major General William C. Lee. Browning's tendency to lecture the Americans on airborne warfare made him few friends among the Americans, {{who felt that}} the British were still novices themselves. Browning was envious of the Americans' equipment, particularly the C-47 Dakota transports. On returning to the United Kingdom, he arranged for a joint exercise to be conducted with the 2nd Battalion, 503rd Parachute Infantry Regiment (2/503). In mid–September, as the 1st Airborne Division was coming close to reaching full strength, Browning was informed that Operation Torch, the Allied invasion of French North Africa, would take place in November. When <b>he</b> <b>found</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> 2/503, was to take part, Browning argued that a larger airborne force should be utilised, as the vast distances and comparatively light opposition would provide opportunities for airborne operations.|$|E
5|$|Matthew Cobley et al. (2013) dispute this, {{finding that}} large muscles and {{cartilage}} would have limited {{movement of the}} neck. They state the feeding ranges for sauropods like Diplodocus were smaller than previously believed, and the animals may have had to move their whole bodies around to better access areas where they could browse vegetation. As such, they might have spent more time foraging to meet their minimum energy needs. The conclusions of Cobley etal. are disputed by Taylor, who analyzed the amount and positioning of intervertebral cartilage to determine {{the flexibility of the}} neck of Apatosaurus and Diplodocus. <b>He</b> <b>found</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> neck of Apatosaurus was very flexible.|$|E

500|$|Ortved {{decided to}} write the book as an oral history because <b>he</b> <b>found</b> <b>that</b> every person interviewed had a {{different}} perspective on the events.

5|$|On graduating a year later, Ramage {{once again}} {{expressed}} {{a preference for}} a flying job, so he received command of Heavy Attack Wing One, which was based at Naval Air Station Sanford, Florida. This wing consisted of the nuclear attack squadrons flying the A3D Skywarrior, detachments from which were posted to the aircraft carriers. The post was a senior one for a captain; Robert Goldthwaite had held the post {{while he was a}} rear admiral. Ramage had never flown the A3D before, so he started by becoming carrier qualified on it, which required eight carrier landings. To his surprise, <b>he</b> <b>found</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> aircraft was easy to fly, and he was successful at lifting the training level of the entire wing.|$|E
5|$|The 44th Bombardment Group {{took part}} in an even more costly raid, {{the attack on the}} Romanian Ploesti oil fields, on 1 August 1943. When Johnson arrived at the target leading his group, <b>he</b> <b>found</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> 93d Bombardment Group had already {{attacked}} their target by mistake, and as a consequence, the defenders were alert. Although he would have been justified in turning back, Johnson led his group in through thick smoke, flak and explosions that concealed the tall smokestacks and barrage balloon cables. On the way home, they had to fight off Me109 fighters.|$|E
5|$|The {{critical}} and commercial {{success of the}} film of David Copperfield led to an invitation to return to Hollywood in 1936. When he got there <b>he</b> <b>found</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> studio executives had no idea which films {{they wanted him to}} work on, and he had eight weeks of highly paid leisure, during which he wrote a short story and worked on a novel. He was eventually asked to write the scenario for Little Lord Fauntleroy, which he enjoyed doing. He spent most of his fees on paintings, forgetting to keep enough money to pay US tax on his earnings. He replenished his American funds with a lecture tour – his last – in late 1936.|$|E
60|$|With {{this cold}} comfort, Timon {{departed}} with his son, and was {{absorbed into the}} Shaker brotherhood, where <b>he</b> soon <b>found</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> order of things was reversed, {{and it was all}} work and no play.|$|R

50|$|Rummel {{was one of}} {{the early}} {{researchers}} on democratic peace theory, after Dean Babst. <b>He</b> <b>found</b> <b>that</b> in <b>the</b> period between 1816 and 2005 there were 205 wars between non-democracies, 166 wars between non-democracies and democracies, and no wars between democracies.|$|R
