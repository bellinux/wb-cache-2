25|$|A belt <b>filter</b> <b>press</b> is {{also known}} for its high {{capacity}} throughput, as {{it is designed to}} handle excess capacity. It has low initial costs and low energy running costs, however, if throughput is less than 4 million gallons per day, the belt <b>filter</b> <b>press</b> may be less cost efficient than liquid transport, hiring a processing facility, or utilizing non-mechanical dewatering methods such as drying beds or reed beds.|$|E
25|$|There {{are many}} {{physical}} separation processes {{similar to the}} belt <b>filter</b> <b>press</b> used for dewatering, including centrifuges, vacuum-disc filters, and the plate and frame <b>filter</b> <b>press.</b> When compared to other compression filters, belt filters use relatively lower pressures. Although centrifuges have lower moisture content, lower costs and simpler operations in coal tails processing, belt filters tend to make less noise and have much quicker startup and shutdown times.|$|E
25|$|The V-fold belt {{is similar}} to the belt <b>filter</b> <b>press</b> with the main {{difference}} being that only a single belt, folded along the centreline is used. The technology has not been widely proven. A final dry weight solids content of 9-13% can usually be achieved; this is smaller than competing technologies. Currently this technology is suited to small-scale applications (up to approximately 3000 L of slurry per hour as the maximum belt size is 0.75 m). V-fold belts have a small footprint, low energy and wash water consumption and low capital and operating costs. They are self-tracking and can process sludge of varying composition, reducing operator involvement.|$|E
50|$|There {{are three}} main basic types of filter presses: plate and frame <b>filter</b> <b>presses,</b> {{recessed}} plate and frame <b>filter</b> <b>presses</b> and automatic <b>filter</b> <b>presses.</b>|$|R
50|$|Many debates {{have been}} {{discussed}} {{about whether or not}} <b>filter</b> <b>presses</b> are sufficient to compete with modern equipment currently {{as well as in the}} future, since <b>filter</b> <b>presses</b> were among one of the oldest machine-driven dewatering devices. Efficiency improvements are possible in many applications where modern <b>filter</b> <b>presses</b> have the best characteristics for the job, however, despite the fact that many mechanical improvements have been made, <b>filter</b> <b>presses</b> still remain to operate on the same concept as when first invented. A lack of progress in efficiency improvement as well as a lack of research on conquering associated issues surrounding <b>filter</b> <b>presses</b> have suggested a possibility of performance inadequacy. At the same time, many other types of filter could do the same or better job as <b>press</b> <b>filters.</b> In certain cases, it is crucial to compare characteristics and performances.|$|R
25|$|In {{order of}} {{increasing}} cost and decreasing product moisture {{the most common}} dewatering options are a thickener, deep bed thickening, belt <b>presses</b> and membrane <b>filter</b> <b>presses.</b> In general centrifuges and other competing technologies do not show a significant cost advantage compared to the belt <b>press</b> <b>filter,</b> for the same cake dryness. The cost of flocculant is often a major operating cost of dewatering equipment. Belt <b>press</b> <b>filters</b> in general have the lowest flocculant consumption {{for any of the}} listed processes excluding membrane <b>filter</b> <b>presses</b> and centrifuges.|$|R
2500|$|The {{belt filter}} (sometimes called a belt press filter, or belt <b>filter</b> <b>press)</b> is an {{industrial}} machine, used for solid/liquid separation processes, particularly the dewatering of sludges in the chemical industry, mining and water treatment. Belt filter presses {{are also used}} {{in the production of}} apple juice, cider and winemaking. The process of filtration is primarily obtained by passing a pair of filtering cloths and belts through a system of rollers. [...] The system takes a sludge or slurry as a feed, and separates it into a filtrate and a solid cake.|$|E
2500|$|The belt <b>filter</b> <b>press</b> {{is often}} used in {{wastewater}} treatment, and thus the odour of the feed sludge, volatile emissions and the chemicals used in treatment, may become a problem. One control method is to use odour-neutralizing chemicals such as potassium permanganate. However this only neutralizes odours and doesn’t affect any gases or chemicals involved. [...] Although all problems can be controlled by enclosing the filter, the enclosure reduces essential visibility and {{easy access to the}} machine for maintenance and repairs, leading to the expensive automation of the process.|$|E

2500|$|The sludge is {{sometimes}} {{passed through a}} so-called pre-thickener which [...] de-waters the sludge. Types of pre-thickeners include centrifugal sludge thickeners rotary drum sludge thickeners and belt <b>filter</b> <b>presses.</b> Dewatered sludge may be incinerated or transported offsite for disposal in a landfill or use as an agricultural soil amendment.|$|R
50|$|The {{selecting}} of <b>filter</b> <b>press</b> type {{depends on}} the value of liquid phase or the solid phase. If extracting liquid phase is desired, then <b>filter</b> <b>press</b> is among the most appropriate methods to be used.|$|E
50|$|In {{terms of}} cake handling, batch <b>filter</b> <b>press</b> {{requires}} large discharge tray size {{in order to}} contain large amount of cake and the system is more expensive compared to continuous <b>filter</b> <b>press</b> with the same output.|$|E

50|$|<b>Filter</b> <b>presses</b> are {{commonly}} used to dewater high-solids slurries in metal processing plants, one of the <b>press</b> <b>filter</b> technology that could deliver the job is the Rotary Pressure Filter method, which provides continuous production in a single unit, where filtration is directed via pressure. However, in cases where solids concentration in high-solids slurries is too high (50%+), {{it is better to}} handle these slurries using vacuum filtration, such as a continuous Indexing Vacuum Belt Filter, since high concentration of solids in slurries will increase pressure and if pressure is too high, the equipment might be damaged and/or less efficient operation.|$|R

Most frequent physical procedures of thickening of sewage sludge (gravitation, flotation, centrifugal thickening, thickening with gravitational belts and thickening with rotational drums) are assigned in first assembly.

50|$|In 1953 Flottweg {{expanded}} its {{into a business}} sector: the production of liquid-solid separation machines. The first product was the Flottweg Decanter, a solid bowl decanter centrifuge; the first model, DECANTER Z1, was sold to BASF. Further development lead to a higher speed and more efficient decanter in 1964. In 1966 an adjustable impeller for decanter was added, which allowed the operator to optimise the pond depth while the decanter was operating; this was useful in the extraction of olive oil. After further development, Flottweg sold a 3-phase decanter for olive oil in Spain in 1971. In 1977 Flottweg began to manufacture belt <b>filter</b> <b>presses.</b>|$|R

50|$|The <b>filter</b> <b>presses</b> {{used in the}} {{refining}} process consisted of mats of woven wire and canvas. In constant use, the wire eventually was abraded {{to the point where}} it pierced the canvas, reducing the efficiency of the filter. Hendrick reasoned that a metal sheet, properly perforated, could replace the canvas-and-wire filter, giving it a longer life. Several tries at drilling holes, first individually, then in a multiple drill-press proved that the concept was sound, but the production process was too costly. He then conceived the idea of punching holes simultaneously in the sheet metal. The metal-punching machine he developed was a pilot for the modern perforating press and the foundation upon which Hendrick Manufacturing Company was started in 1876.|$|R
