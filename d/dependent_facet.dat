40|$|Abstract. Selective {{growth of}} SiC on SiC {{substrate}} was demonstrated in a {{chemical vapor deposition}} (CVD) reactor using a new high temperature mask. Bulk 4 H-SiC with 8 o miscut (0001) Si-face wafers were coated with the high temperature mask and patterned using standard photolithography. The pattern consisted of window stripes as spokes of a wheel. Epitaxial growth of SiC {{was carried out in}} a conventional, horizontal, rf-heated cold wall reactor at temperatures in the range 1450 - 1550 oC. When the window stripes are oriented along miscut direction, the growth on the exposed area followed the substrate orientation, and the top surface was smooth and specular. However, when the window stripes are aligned along direction (perpendicular to the miscut direction), the growth on the window stripes developed (0001) facets on the surface. Epitaxial lateral overgrowth over the mask was also studied by cross sectional scanning electron microscopy (SEM). It was found that the extent of lateral growth varied with the stripe orientation. Effects of growth temperature as well as silane flows on the selective growth were also studied. Higher temperature or lower silane flow results in the etching of exposed SiC instead of growth. The etched surfaces developed orientation <b>dependent</b> <b>facets</b> similar to the growth. Importantly, the mask could be easily removed after the growth...|$|R

40|$|Zheng, NF (通讯作者) A facile {{method to}} boost the {{catalysis}} of Pd nanoparticulate catalysts by simple C 2 H 2 treatment is developed. During the C 2 H 2 treatment, Pd nanoparticles serve as active catalysts to polymerize C 2 H 2 into transpolyacetylene. The deposition of trans-polyacetylene layer on Pd nanoparticles makes their surface hydrophobic. Such a hydrophobic surface modification helps to accumulate more hydrophobic substrates during catalysis, making the modified Pd nanoparticulate catalysts more active than untreated catalysts in the catalytic reaction involving hydrophobic substrates. Moreover, the coating of polyacetylene on Pd creates encapsulated Pd nanocatalysts, stabilizing Pd nanoparticles against sintering or aggregation.

40|$|The {{influence}} of the wind laden with sand in modelling pebbles is believed by some authors to be only that of polishing the surface, by others of rounding off bits of stone that already possessed edges and corners, or again by others of wearing any fragment either rounded or angular into definite forms with ridges and <b>facets,</b> <b>dependent</b> on {{the shape of the}} basis (Alb.

Where sand corrosion is great, as in the desert, the windworn pebbles owe their shape to the laws formulated by Heim; many of the fossil windworn pebbles of Northern Europe have undergone but slight alteration from their original shape and size by the natural sandblast, others seem to have been entirely remodelled by the wind along the lines indicated above...|$|R

40|$|OBJECTIVE: To study {{progression}} of tooth wear quantitatively in a convenient sample {{of young adults}} and to assess possible correlations with occlusal conditions. METHODS: Twenty-eight dental students participated in a three-year follow up study on tooth wear. Visible wear facets on full arch gypsum casts were assessed using a flatbed scanner and measuring software. Regression analyses {{were used to assess}} possible associations between the registered occlusal conditions 'occlusal guidance scheme', 'vertical overbite', 'horizontal overbite', 'depth of sagittal curve', 'canine Angle class relation', 'history of orthodontic treatment', and 'self-reported grinding/clenching' (independent variables) and increase of wear <b>facets</b> (<b>dependent</b> variable). RESULTS: Mean increase in facet surface areas ranged from 1. 2 mm 2 (premolars, incisors) to 3. 4 mm 2 (molars); the relative increase ranged from 15 % to 23 %. Backward regression analysis showed no significant relation for 'group function', 'vertical overbite', 'depth of sagittal curve', 'history of orthodontic treatment' nor 'self-reported clenching. The final multiple linear regression model showed significant associations amongst 'anterior protected articulation' and 'horizontal overbite' and increase of facet surface areas. For all teeth combined, only 'anterior protected articulation' had a significant effect. 'Self reported grinding' did not have a significant effect (p> 0. 07).

Self reported grinding was not significantly associated with progression of tooth wear.

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this research is}} to use atomistic simulations to investigate dislocation nucleation from grain boundaries in face-centered cubic aluminum and copper. This research primarily focuses on asymmetric tilt grain boundaries and has three main components. First, this research uses molecular statics simulations of the structure and energy of these faceted, dissociated grain boundary structures to show that Σ 3 asymmetric boundaries can be decomposed into the structural units of the Σ 3 symmetric tilt grain boundaries, i. e., the coherent and incoherent twin boundaries. Moreover, the energy for all Σ 3 asymmetric boundaries is predicted with only the energies of the Σ 3 symmetric boundaries and the inclination angle. Understanding the structure of these boundaries provides insight into dislocation nucleation from these boundaries. Further work into the structure and energy of other low order Σ asymmetric boundaries and the spatial distribution of free volume within the grain boundaries also provides insight into dislocation nucleation mechanisms. Second, this research uses molecular dynamics deformation simulations with uniaxial tension applied perpendicular to these boundaries to show that the dislocation nucleation mechanisms in asymmetric boundaries are highly <b>dependent</b> on the <b>faceted,</b> dissociated structure. Grain boundary dislocation sources can act as perfect sources/sinks for dislocations or may violate this premise by increasing the dislocation content of the boundary during nucleation. Furthermore, simulations under uniaxial tension and uniaxial compression show that nucleation of the second partial dislocation in copper exhibits tension-compression asymmetry. Third, this research explores the development of models that incorporate the resolved stress components on the slip system of dislocation nucleation to predict the atomic stress required for dislocation nucleation from single crystals and grain boundaries. Single crystal simulations of homogeneous dislocation nucleation help define the role of lattice orientation on the nucleation stress for grain boundaries. The resolved stress normal to the slip plane on which the dislocation nucleates plays an integral role in the dislocation nucleation stress and related mechanisms. In summary, the synthesis of various aspects of this work has provided improved understanding of how the grain boundary character influences dislocation nucleation in bicrystals, with possible implications for nanocrystalline materials.

40|$|The {{rational}} {{improvement of}} solid catalysts requires {{a thorough understanding}} of the structure-activity relationship down to the smallest possible length scales. Recently developed approaches that correlate fluorescence microscopy (FM) and scanning electron microscopy (SEM) allow such insights by direct linking of nanoscale catalytic activity maps, as recorded using fluorescence, to the local structural context. The goal of this PhD was to investigate structure-activity relationships at the nanoscale, by developing an integrated light and electron microscope (ILEM) that combines the power of single molecule sensitive FM to resolve reactivity at the nanoscale with a high-end SEM. Initially, the ILEM was applied to visualize silver nanoparticle photodeposition from an aqueous silver(I) solution on individual ZnO crystals, in real time. This was enabled by the ability to simultaneously perform local UV irradiation using the integrated light microscope and SEM imaging at the same region of interest (ROI) while the sample was contained inside a specialized liquid cell. This research revealed that silver nanoparticle formation predominantly occurs at crystal edges. However, the contribution of the electron beam during silver nanoparticle deposition was found to be non-negligible. Follow-up research was performed by applying the ILEM in a correlative fashion; i. e., by performing structural imaging before and after, and not during, UV induced silver photodeposition. As such, the <b>facet</b> <b>dependent</b> photocatalytic reactivity could be explored at the single particle level and, at the sub-particle level, variations were related to crystallographic structural features and defects. The first correlative super-resolution fluorescence and electron microscopic investigation of zeolite catalysts was made possible after resolving several technical challenges encountered during the ZnO research and by further optimizing the fluorescence microscope to enable the detection of individual catalytic fluorogenic conversions. This improved setup made it possible to directly observe the effect of intercrystalline intergrowths on the overall catalytic performance of acid mordenite zeolites. By determining the orientation of the individual reaction products compared to the underlying zeolitic framework, it was found that shape-selectivity was maintained at the defect-rich intergrowth boundary. Hence, the intergrowth was identified as a void space that facilitates mass transport into these pores. Acid leaching did not dramatically change this, as activity increased on previously active regions while the molecular orientation was maintained. A second correlative zeolite structure-activity investigation targeted individual ZSM- 22 catalyst particles. The typical needle-shaped morphology of these particles results from a lateral fusion of elementary nanorods and indirect experimentation already suggested that during this lateral fusion, external, catalytically inactive, aluminum is converted into catalytically active internal aluminum. This was confirmed by the visualization of catalyst activity and shape-selectivity at the sub-particle level on the ILEM. In summary, over the course of this PhD, a performant ILEM was developed that combined super-resolution fluorescence microscopy based on the localization of individual fluorescent molecules with high-end field emission SEM. Also the necessary experimental routines and software tools were developed, enabling the determination of the structure-activity relationship of heterogeneous catalysts at the nanoscale. This powerful research tool allows a direct correlation of catalyst structure and activity beyond the single particle level. It is anticipated that the further application and development of this ILEM will ultimately lead to a more rationalized catalyst optimization. status: publishe...|$|R
40|$|Catalysis, and {{especially}} photocatalysis, plays a fundamental {{role for the}} realization of a sustainable future. The most commonly used photoactive material in these catalytic processes is Titanium Dioxide (TiO 2), known for its extraordinary properties. However, this TiO 2 system has some major drawbacks, such as a high recombination rate of the photogenerated charge carriers and an inactivity in the visible region of light due to a large band gap. By depositing noble metal nanoparticles on the TiO 2 surface, recombination can be inhibited and visible light activity can be achieved. Controlling size, loading and distribution of the metal nanoparticles is essential for a high photocatalytic efficiency. The effect of the solvent used during the metal grafting and on the final TiO 2 photocatalytic surface activity is poorly understood. However, this final activity is significantly influenced by surface modifications induced by the solvent during photodeposition of noble metal nanoparticles or during a catalytic reaction. First, noble metal particles growth and size is controlled by means of visible light irradiation on a non-catalytic surface. Wet-chemically synthesized gold nanoparticle seeds are submerged in a pure aqueous gold salt solution and subsequently growth was induced with a 532 nm laser line, which coincides with the Surface Plasmon absorption band of the gold seeds. The nanoparticle growth was followed with both dark field microscopy and Atomic Fore Microscopy (AFM). Only when gold seeds were present, irradiation could induce growth. To {{gain a better understanding}} of this mechanism, the effect of the polarization of light was studied at silver nanoprisms. Small silver nanoprisms were synthesized and immobilized on a glass surface. Only light with the appropriate wavelength, coinciding with the Surface Plasmon of the nanoprisms, was able to grow the prisms. Various polarizations of light supported the hypothesis that the Surface Plasmon Resonances control the growth of the nanotriangles. Second, noble metal nanoparticles were photodeposited on a catalytic semiconductor surface, namely a TiO 2 sol-gel film. Control of the photodeposited gold nanoparticle size can be exerted by using strong hole scavenging molecules such as ethanol or ethylene glycol. Ethylene glycol has proven to give the best results in terms of size and monodispersity after UV photodeposition. Growing these UV photodeposited gold nanoparticles was realized by using broad spectrum visible light, mimicking the visible light spectrum of the sun, after deposition by UV irradiation. However, the reshaping was most significant with Au nanoparticles with sharp features, which are created during photodeposition in ethanol. It is proposed that these sharp features play an important role in the reshaping through their strong electromagnetic enhancement. Furthermore, both growth and reshaping was proven to be most significant in ethylene glycol, suggesting an increased TiO 2 activity under visible light when adsorbing this molecule. The reshaping of metal nanoparticles opens perspectives to control the size of metal nanoparticles and hence improvement of the photoresponsivity of TiO 2 based systems. Third, we investigated the solvent effect of the facet dependence of gold nanoparticle photodeposition by using anatase TiO 2 crystals with large { 001 } and { 101 } facets. The gold nanoparticle size and shape distribution was improved using ethylene glycol, compared to the photodeposition in more commonly used solvents as ethanol and water. Moreover, the facet dependence changed when using hole scavenging molecules, opening possibilities for facet controlled grafting. Density Functional Theory (DFT) calculations are performed to study the difference in solvent adsorption on TiO 2. These calculations indicate that ethylene glycol adsorbs strongly on both TiO 2 facets, while H 2 O and ethanol only adsorb strongly on the { 001 } facet. Furthermore, ethylene glycol induces an extra localized state within the bandgap of TiO 2 at the { 001 } surface facet, increasing its activity. This gives a possible explanation of the improved Au photodeposition and paves the way for a more controlled noble metal nanoparticle loading. Finally, the knowledge obtained in the previous chapters is used to improve the photocatalytic activity of a commercial semiconductor system such as TiO 2 P 25 nanoparticles. We show a straightforward and swift way to control gold nanoparticle photodeposition on TiO 2 particles in both UV and sunlight. Furthermore, growth of these small photodeposited particles under visible light was shown, consistent with the results found in the second approach. By blocking the titania surface through adsorption of the hole scavenging ethylene glycol, we increase the photoreduction activity of TiO 2 even under pure sunlight. As a result, smaller Au nanoparticles are grafted and are more equally distributed over the TiO 2 surface. Next, we could prove an increase in photocatalytic activity for the degradation of organic compounds under sunlight. The initial results for the improvement found with other metals, i. e. Pt, were shown. In conclusion, although the metal/semiconductor mechanism that improves photocatalytic grafting is not fully understood, our results give an insight into the importance of solvent adsorption and surface modification for the final photocatalytic activity.

40|$|Soft tissue {{cervical}} spine (neck) injuries, {{known as}} ‘whiplash’, are a {{leading cause of}} injury in motor vehicle collisions. A detailed finite element (FE) model of the cervical spine that is able to predict local tissue injury is a vital tool to improve safety systems in cars, through understanding of injury mechanisms at the tissue level and evaluation of new safety systems. This is the motivation for the formation of the Global Human Body Models Consortium, which is a collective of major automotive manufacturers with the goal of producing a detailed FE human body model to predict occupant response in crash. This work builds on an existing detailed cervical spine model, with a focus on improved validation in terms of kinematics and tissue level response. The neck model used in this research represents a 50 th percentile male and was developed at the University of Waterloo. The model includes both passive and active musculature, detailed nucleus and annulus models of the discs, rate <b>dependent</b> non-linear ligaments, <b>facet</b> capsules with a squeeze film model of the synovial fluid, and rigid vertebrae with the geometry derived from CT scans. The material properties were determined from published experimental testing and were not calibrated to improve the model response. The model was previously validated at the segment level. In this study, the model was validated for tension loading, local tissue response during both frontal and rear impacts, and head kinematic response during frontal and rear impact. The whole neck model without musculature was exposed to a tensile load up to 300 N and the predicted response was within the experimental corridors throughout. The ligament strains and disc shear strains predicted by the model were compared to bench-top cadaver tests. In frontal impact, the ligament and disc strains were within a standard deviation of the experiments 26 / 30 and 12 / 15 times respectively. In rear impact, the strains were within a standard deviation of the experiments 9 / 10 and 12 / 15 times for the ligaments and discs respectively. All of the ligament strains were within two standard deviation of the experimental average and the disc strains were all within three standard deviations. The global kinematic response of the head for 4 g and 7 g rear impacts and 7 g and 15 g frontal impacts was generally a good fit to the experimental corridors. These impact loads are relevant to the low speed impacts that generally cause whiplash. In the global kinematic validation, the model was shown to oscillate more, which is likely {{due to the lack of}} soft-tissues such as the skin and fat or the lack of high-rate material data for the intervertebral discs. In rear impact, the head over extended by 17 ° and 6 ° for 4 g and 7 g impacts respectively; this is likely due to difficulties defining the facet gap or lack of uncovertebral joints. Even with these limitations the model response for these varied modes of loading was considered excellent. A review of organic causes of whiplash revealed the most likely sources of whiplash include the capsular ligament, other ligaments, and the vertebral discs. The model was exposed to frontal and rear impacts with increasing severities until the soft tissue strains reached damage thresholds. In frontal impact, these strains started to reach damage values at a 15 g impact. The disc annulus fibres were likely injured at 10 g in a rear impact, and the ligaments were likely injured at 14 g in a rear impact. These impact severities agree with findings from real-life accidents where long term consequences were found in rear impacts from 9 g to 15 g. The model was used to show that bench-top cadaver impacts under predict strain because they lack active musculature. A number of recommendations have been proposed to improve the biofidelity of the model including perform in-vivo measurement of human facet gaps, incorporate the uncovertebral joints, measure rate-dependent properties for the annulus fibrosus of the disc, include non-structural soft tissues for increased damping, determine a muscle activation strategy that can maintain head posture in a gravity field, and continue to develop relationships between prolonged painful injury and strain in structures of the neck other than the capsular ligaments. Furthermore, it was recommended that the model should be developed further for whiplash injury prediction with out of position occupants...|$|R
