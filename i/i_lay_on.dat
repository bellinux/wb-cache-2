A screw said to me, 'What size {{are you in the}} waist and what size are you for shoes?' I asked him 'What for?' and he told me 'For a uniform'. I said, 'You have got to be joking'. I {{was the only one in}} the H-Blocks. They dragged me into the cell. Davy Long [...] wanted me to compromise. He suggested I wore my own shoes and trousers if I wore a prison shirt. I just laughed. He locked the door. <b>I</b> <b>lay</b> <b>on</b> the floor all night without mattress, blankets or anything else. The heat was reasonable in all fairness and I slept.|$|E

60|$|I {{could not}} but acquiesce, for I was dog tired, {{and could not}} have sat up had I tried. So, on her {{renewing}} her promise to call me if she should want anything, <b>I</b> <b>lay</b> <b>on</b> the sofa, and forgot all about everything.|$|E

6000|$|Still, I {{knew not}} where I was; only in time I saw I {{had been removed}} from the spot where I fell: <b>I</b> <b>lay</b> <b>on</b> no portico-step; night and tempest were {{excluded}} by walls, windows, and ceiling. Into some house I had been carried--but what house? ...|$|E
60|$|I {{had thought}} of them much as <b>I</b> <b>lay</b> <b>on</b> my back {{recovering}} from the fever,--the fever for which Mrs. Temple was to blame. Yet I bore her no malice. And many other thoughts I had, probing back into childhood memories for the solving of problems there.|$|E

5000|$|From {{almost the}} first moment <b>I</b> <b>lay</b> eyes <b>on</b> any one of Hansen’s paintings, I feel a {{sensation}} that is reminiscent of that day he drew the human figure in our class.

6000|$|... "Ah, Colonel!" [...] said Holmes, {{arranging}} his rumpled collar. [...] "'Journeys end in lovers' meetings,' {{as the old}} play says.

60|$|Such was my {{condition}} when I {{sat down to}} my dinner that day, {{in the kitchen of}} the old farm-house. Such was {{my condition}} when <b>I</b> <b>lay</b> <b>on</b> my bed in the old farm-house that night, stretched out opposite the narrow mullioned window, in the cold light of the moon, like a young vampire.|$|E
60|$|About {{eleven o'clock}} that night, <b>I</b> <b>lay</b> <b>on</b> {{one of the}} lockers of the main cabin, in a wakeful mood. Nicholas lay on the other locker, in that {{profound}} slumber which is so characteristic of healthy youth. His regular breathing was the only sound I heard, except the soft footfall of our skipper, as he slowly paced the deck.|$|E

5000|$|Although widely published, quoted and {{cited in}} other essays, Fulghum's essays (especially the title piece) {{have also been}} criticized as trite and saccharine.

60|$|What Dick called easy as pie was {{the hardest}} work I ever did. <b>I</b> <b>lay</b> flat <b>on</b> my back, bound hand and foot, and it was {{necessary}} to jerk my body along the log till my hands should be under the knife. I lifted my legs and edged along inch by inch.|$|R
60|$|I went in {{the parlor}} and lit the lamp, and {{gradually}} the fury subsided and the ridiculous features of the thing began to suggest themselves. So <b>I</b> <b>lay</b> <b>on</b> the sofa, with note-book and pencil, and transferred the adventure to our big room in the hotel at Heilbronn, and got it on paper a good deal to my satisfaction.|$|E
6000|$|There <b>I</b> <b>lay</b> <b>on</b> {{the hard}} {{stones of the}} quay, feeling very much {{inclined}} to laugh, but looking, no doubt, very blue and ghastly. [...] "He's gone, poor chap!"

60|$|All {{the whole}} I must admit {{it was not}} a {{situation}} that lent itself to eloquence. <b>I</b> <b>lay</b> <b>on</b> my back and talked through bandages, and with some little difficulty, for my tongue and mouth had swollen. But I was feverish and in pain, and the emotional suspense I had been in so long with regard to her became now an unendurable impatience.|$|E
50|$|During the {{fighting}} of World War <b>I,</b> Stegna <b>lay</b> <b>on</b> {{the front line}} of battle from the spring of 1915 to July 1915, and much of the village was destroyed.
