An existing rotordynamic test apparatus is modified for a new type of <b>gas</b> <b>damper</b> seal. Experimental results including coastdowns, rap tests and leakage from the <b>gas</b> <b>damper</b> seal are presented along with comparison tests of a conventional labyrinth seal of the same geometrical dimensions and inlet clearance.

40|$|LecturePg. 55 - 64 The rotordynamic and leaking {{characteristics}} of {{two types of}} <b>gas</b> <b>damper</b> seals, honeycomb seal and pocket damper seal, were experimentally evaluated on a rotating test rig. The effect of supply pressure, preswirl, and seal eccentricity on seal dynamic performance was investigated in the tests. The pressurized working gas flowed through the seal and exhausted to atmospheric conditions. The maximum seal supply pressure was limited to 500 psia. By simulating the rotor experimental unbalance response and amplification factors based on a well-established rotor model, the equivalent stiffness and damping coefficients were estimated for tested <b>gas</b> <b>damper</b> seals. Experimental results confirm that both honeycomb and pocket damper seals provide high positive effective damping. On the other hand, the pocket damper seal increases the first critical speed. A correlation study was performed between the identified rotordynamic coefficients and predictions obtained from existing theoretical models for both honeycomb and pocket damper seals. In this paper is discussed as well a damper seal design {{and its impact on}} the rotordynamic performance of an industrial high-pressure compressor rotor...|$|E

40|$|In this paper, we {{consider}} how <b>gas</b> <b>damping</b> affects the dynamical evolution of gas-embedded star clusters. Using a simple three-component (i. e. one gas and two stellar components) model, we compare {{the rates of}} mass segregation due to two-body relaxation, accretion from the interstellar medium, and gas dynamical friction in both the supersonic and subsonic regimes. Using observational data in the literature, we apply our analytic predictions to two different astrophysical environments, namely galactic nuclei and young open star clusters. Our analytic results are then tested using numerical simulations performed with the NBSymple code, modified by an additional deceleration term to model the damping effects of the gas. The results of our simulations are in reasonable agreement with our analytic predictions, and demonstrate that <b>gas</b> <b>damping</b> can significantly accelerate the rate of mass segregation. A stable state of approximate energy equilibrium cannot be achieved in our model if <b>gas</b> <b>damping</b> is present, even if Spitzer's Criterion is satisfied. This instability drives the continued dynamical decoupling and subsequent ejection (and/or collisions) of the more massive population. Unlike two-body relaxation, <b>gas</b> <b>damping</b> causes overall cluster contraction, reducing both the core and half-mass radii. If the cluster is mass segregated (and/or the gas density is highest at the cluster centre), the latter contracts faster than the former, accelerating the rate of core collapse.

40|$|This {{report will}} {{describe}} a project between two students from Karlstad University and Markus Norström from Hovercraft solutions. The project {{aim was to}} develop a cabin for the hovercraft 380 TD. The project was divided into two sub parts; one concerning the design of the cabin and one concerning the engineering. Throughout this rapport you can follow the engineering part of the project. The project has followed a systematic product development process resulting in optimized results for material selection and engineering solutions. Material for the parts of the cabin was selected, by implementation of the Ashby-method. The research gave a hint about possible materials and the Ashby-method confirmed it. A final material selection was then made. A center frame was developed in aluminum, with an integrated hinge and possibilities for mounting different types of equipment. The frame is the core of the construction and works a solid ground {{for the rest of the}} cabin. A space-frame was developed out of standard aluminum profiles to stabilize the construction to required stiffness. The space-frame follows the current design and works as an attachment point for the front window as well as the sandwich construction that works as roof and wall for the cabin. After these steps, the selection and placing of a <b>gas</b> <b>damper</b> was made for the moveable parts. A possible solution for the mounting of the windows was developed as well as a solution for the mounting for the frame on the hovercraft.

Issued also on microfiche from Lange Micrographics. Experiments to identify stiffness and damping force coefficients of a two bladed teeth-on-stator labyrinth seal and a <b>gas</b> <b>damper</b> seal, both of diverging clearance, are presented. Calibrated impact guns excite a housing holding the test seal, and the seal displacement and acceleration time responses in two orthogonal directions are measured. A frequency domain parameter identification procedure allows the determination of the seals' dynamic force coefficients over a frequency range. Tests are made for a centered seal condition without journal rotation and with rotation at 1, 500 and 3, 000 rpm. The pressure drop across the seal is controlled by increments in the inlet supply pressure to values three times the exit (ambient) pressure. The two bladed labyrinth seal becomes less stable with increasing pressure ratio across the seal. This seal exhibits positive direct stiffness and negative direct damping. Cross-coupling is observed but identification of cross-coupled stiffnesses is poor. Comparison with analytical predictions is good for mass flow and direct damping coefficients. Predicted values for direct stiffness are negative, contrary to identified values. The same labyrinth'seal is transformed into a four pocket damper seal and tested under identical conditions. The damper seal is shown to be more stable dynamically but can create a static instability due to excessive negative direct stiffness. In the test facility used, the seal housing does not have enough direct stiffness to support the damper seal at pressure ratios greater than 2. 0. Cross-coupled stiffness is not detected in the measurements. The direct damping coefficients are positive and large in magnitude compared to those from the labyrinth seal measurements. Analytical predictions show similar trends for mass flow, direct stiffness and direct damping coefficients. tests but this is not identified from the seal response measurements...|$|E

In addition {{to the need for}} <b>gas</b> <b>damping</b> models for design of MEMS with movable micro-structures, knowledge of parameter dependence in <b>gas</b> <b>damping</b> contributes to the understanding of device-level reliability. In this work, two damping models quantifying the uncertainty in parameters are generated based on rarefied flow simulations. One is a generalized polynomial chaos (gPC) model, which is a general strategy for uncertainty quantification, and the other is a compact model developed specifically for this problem in an early work. Convergence and statistical analysis have been conducted to verify both models. By taking the gap size and ambient pressure as random fields with known probability distribution functions (PDF), the output PDF for the damping coefficient can be obtained. The first four central moments are used in comparisons of the resulting non-parametric distributions. A good agreement has been found, within 1 %, for the relative difference for damping coefficient mean values. In study of geometric uncertainty, it is found that the average damping coefficient can deviate up to 13 % from the damping coefficient corresponding to the average gap size.

The resulting acceleration noise increases significantly when {{the distance of the}} test mass to the surrounding experimental apparatus is smaller than the dimension of the test mass itself. For the Advanced LIGO interferometric gravitational wave observatory, where the relevant test mass is a suspended 340 mm diameter cylindrical end mirror, the force noise power is increased by roughly a factor 40 by the presence of a similarly shaped reaction mass at a nominal separation of 5 mm. The force noise, of order 20 [*][*]fN/Hz[superscript 1 / 2] for 2 × 10 [superscript - 6][*][*]Pa of residual H[subscript 2] gas, rivals quantum optical fluctuations as the dominant noise source between 10 and 30 Hz.

40|$|The {{research}} {{presented in}} this dissertation focuses on fluid-structure interactions of thin flexible structures for three different problems, namely, the aeroelastic flutter of webs and ribbons, the nonlinear aerodynamic damping of slender beams, and the <b>gas</b> <b>damping</b> of microcantilevers. All these problems involve flexible structures at different length scales resulting in different physical regimes for the surrounding fluid flows, which are modeled using simplified fluid flow models. ^ The {{first part of this}} dissertation presents a theoretical investigation of the aeroelastic flutter of tensioned wide webs and narrow ribbons commonly used in the paper-handling, textile, and sheet-metal industries. The web or ribbon is modeled as a uni-axially tensioned Kirchhoff plate with vanishingly small bending stiffness and is submerged in an incompressible inviscid fluid flow across its free edges resulting in a coupled non-conservative dynamical system with gyroscopic and circulatory terms. Wide webs mainly destabilize through a divergence instability due to cross-flow-induced, conservative centrifugal effects, and for certain values of applied tension, destabilize via a weak flutter instability, due to the wake-induced non-conservative effects. Contrarily, narrow ribbons in cross flow exhibit either flutter or divergence instability depending on the value of applied tension. Wind tunnel experiments, conducted to qualitatively corroborate these theoretical results, were inconclusive {{due to the lack of}} sufficient control over the important physical parameters. Nonetheless, the experiments show interesting dynamical phenomena such as simultaneous occurrence of oscillatory and zero frequency response of ribbons. ^ The second part of this dissertation focuses on the nonlinear aerodynamic damping of slender, sharp-edged beams commonly found in flapping wings of micro-air-vehicles (MAVs), piezoelectric fans and insect wings. When such structures oscillate at moderate to large non-dimensional frequencies with large amplitudes comparable to their widths, vortex-shedding from the beam 2 ̆ 7 s sharp edges gives rise to nonlinear aerodynamic damping. In this work, a general theory is developed to predict the amplitude and frequency dependence of this aerodynamic damping by coupling the structural motions to an inviscid, incompressible fluid. The fluid-structure interaction model developed here accounts for separation of flow and studies vortex-shedding-induced aerodynamic damping in slender, sharp-edged beams for different values of the Keulegan-Carpenter number and the non-dimensional frequency parameter. The theoretical predictions are validated against carefully performed experiments with piezoelectric fans under vacuum and atmospheric conditions. ^ The third part of this dissertation studies the <b>gas</b> <b>damping</b> of microcantilevers oscillating in different vibration modes in an unbounded gas at low ambient pressures varying over 6 orders of magnitude. The accurate prediction of <b>gas</b> <b>damping</b> of microcantilevers at low ambient pressures is essential for improving the sensitivity of microcantilever-based sensors and improving the efficiency of microresonators. In this work, solutions of a sub-continuum, quasisteady Boltzmann equation with a simplified ellipsoidal statistical Bhatnagar-Gross-Krook (ES-BGK) collision operator are used to provide a closed-form fit, which can be used to predict the <b>gas</b> <b>damping</b> of different microcantilever vibration modes. The fit is uniformly valid over 5 orders of magnitude of the Knudsen number and spans the free-molecular, the transition, and the lower pressure side of the slip flow regime. For the higher pressure side of the slip flow regime, this work proposes a boundary-integral-method-based approach for including the slip boundary condition in existing continuum regime models. Detailed experimental data on <b>gas</b> <b>damping</b> of silicon microcantilevers obtained from research collaborators shows excellent agreement with the predictions of the ES-BGK-model-based fit. ...|$|R
