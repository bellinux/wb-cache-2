5|$|Bubble lights, {{a type of}} {{incandescent}} novelty light, {{were invented}} by Carl Otis in 1935, who then sold the patents to the NOMA (National Outfit Manufacturer's Association) Electric Corporation. NOMA launched the novelty lights on the Christmas market in 1946 when war shortages ended. Bubble lights became hugely popular. Their main feature was a sealed <b>glass</b> <b>tube</b> with a colored bubbling liquid inside.|$|E
5|$|An old style mercury {{barometer}} {{consists of a}} vertical <b>glass</b> <b>tube</b> about 1cm in diameter partially filled with mercury, and with a vacuum (called Torricelli's vacuum) in the unfilled volume (see diagram to the right). Notice that the mercury level {{at the center of}} the tube is higher than at the edges, making the upper surface of the mercury dome-shaped. The center of mass of the entire column of mercury would be slightly lower if the top surface of the mercury were flat over the entire cross-section of the tube. But the dome-shaped top gives slightly less surface area to the entire mass of mercury. Again the two effects combine to minimize the total potential energy. Such a surface shape is known as a convex meniscus.|$|E

50|$|In the past, {{scientists}} constructed {{their own}} laboratory apparatus {{prior to the}} ubiquity of interchangeable ground glass joints. Today, commercially available parts connected by ground glass joints are preferred; where specialized glassware are required, they are made to measure using commercially available <b>glass</b> <b>tubes</b> by specialist glassblowers. For example, a Schlenk line is made of two large <b>glass</b> <b>tubes,</b> connected by stopcocks and smaller <b>glass</b> <b>tubes,</b> which are further connected to plastic hoses.|$|R
5|$|In 1746 Franklin {{began working}} on {{electrical}} experiments with Ebenezer Kinnersley after he bought all of Archibald Spencer's electrical equipment that he used in his lectures. Later he was also associated with Thomas Hopkinson and Philip Syng in experimentation with electricity. In the summer of 1747 they had received an electrical system from Thomas Penn. While no records exists to tell us exactly what parts {{were included in the}} system, historian J. A. Leo LeMay believes {{it was a combination of}} an electricity generating machine, a Leyden jar, a <b>glass</b> <b>tube,</b> and a stool that was electrically insulated from the ground. This gave Franklin a complete system to experiment with generating and storing electricity.|$|E
5|$|Franklin's machine used a {{belt and}} pulley system that could be {{operated}} by one person turning a crank. A large pulley {{was attached to the}} crank-handle, and a much smaller pulley was attached to a large glass globe. An iron axle passed through the globe. This allowed the globe to be rotated at high speed. When the crank was turned, the glass globe rubbed against a leather pad, which generated a large static charge, similar to the electrical charge that could be created by rubbing a <b>glass</b> <b>tube</b> with wool cloth by hand. The machine was unique improvement over others made in Europe at the time, as the glass globe could be spun faster with much less labor. A few revolutions of the handle was all that was needed to charge a Leyden jar.|$|E
5|$|Since clones cannot {{properly}} die, the Sakura and Syaoran clones are reconstructed by Yūko, {{who wishes}} to compensate them for how their existences were used. She causes them to be reborn as humans, who eventually meet and start living together. Sakura gives birth to the original Syaoran and they realize {{they are in their}} own past. They raise him until it is time for him to begin the events of the series, then they seal themselves in a <b>glass</b> <b>tube</b> in order to await the time when Fei-Wang will attempt to shatter reality. After breaking free from the tube, Sakura and Syaoran reverse Fei-Wang's damage to the dimension using the magic they inherited from the sorcerer Clow Reed during their reincarnation. They disappear after Fei-Wang is killed by Kurogane, leaving behind only a feather which the original Sakura and Syaoran absorb.|$|E

As neither could properly die, Yūko grants their wishes to be reborn as normal humans, which Syaoran accepts because Sakura tells him {{she wants to}} stay with him. As both grow up as normal humans, they meet and live together. He and Sakura have a son, who is the original Syaoran, creating a time paradox. Because they realize that all the previous events would be repeated and their son {{would not be able}} to save the , they seal themselves inside a <b>glass</b> <b>tube</b> hidden in Yūko's shop.

5000|$|Cermets {{were first}} used {{extensively}} in ceramic-to-metal joint applications. Construction of vacuum tubes {{was one of}} the first critical systems, with the electronics industry employing and developing such seals. German scientists recognized that vacuum tubes with improved performance and reliability could be produced by substituting ceramics for <b>glass.</b> Ceramic <b>tubes</b> can be outgassed at higher temperatures. Because of the high-temperature seal, ceramic tubes withstand higher temperatures than <b>glass</b> <b>tubes.</b> Ceramic tubes are also mechanically stronger and less sensitive to thermal shock than <b>glass</b> <b>tubes.</b> [...] Today, cermet vacuum tube coatings have proved to be key to solar hot water systems.|$|R

25|$|The {{earliest}} known experimenter with X-rays was actuary William Morgan. In 1785 {{he presented}} a {{paper to the}} Royal Society of London describing the effects of passing electrical currents through a partially evacuated <b>glass</b> <b>tube,</b> the first X-ray tube. This work was further extended by Humphry Davy and his assistant Michael Faraday.|$|E
25|$|The <b>glass</b> <b>tube</b> {{contains}} a wire-mesh anode and multiple cathodes, shaped like numerals or other symbols.

N-CNTs can be prepared via chemical vapor deposition method by pyrolysizing melamine under an Ar atmosphere in a horizontal <b>glass</b> <b>tube.</b> A thin film of iron (5nm) is first deposited on a Si/SiO2 wafer. N-CNT synthesis occurs at a furnace temperatures between 800 and 980°C.|$|E
40|$|Thin porous <b>glass</b> <b>tubes</b> were {{prepared}} by extruding a polymer solution containing suspended glass powder to a tubular precursor at room temperature, {{which was then}} heat treated at elevated temperatures to remove the polymer and sinter the particles to a porous or dense structure with sufficient mechanical strength. In extruding these thin tubular precursors, polyethersulfone (PESF) and N-methyl- 2 -pyrrolidone (NMP) were used as the polymer binder and the solvent, respectively. Porous <b>glass</b> <b>tubes</b> can be obtained directly by sintering the tubular precursor at relatively lower temperatures. Heated at higher temperatures (i. e. 900 degrees C), the <b>glass</b> <b>tubes</b> became gas tight. Subsequently, the sodium borosilicate <b>glass</b> <b>tubes</b> were leached in hot water to remove the soluble phase formed by phase separation during cooling. The characterizing technique involved XRD, SEM and gas permeation measurements. SEM examination indicated that during leaching, the glass developed pores of about 0. 1 mu m size consistent with gas permeation measurements. (C) 2007 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved...|$|R

40|$|Abstract- Appari’s magic cricket bat is the bat {{in which}} the weight of bat is {{increased}} {{at the point of}} percussion. Just by increasing the weight at the center of percussion one can hit the ball very well, and for same effort the ball can drop/ travel more distance. The weight of bat can be increased by adding heavy weight material e. g mercury at the center of percussion of the bat. The weight of the bat can be increased by using unbreakable <b>glass</b> <b>tubes</b> completely filled with mercury on {{the back side of the}} bat. The shape of the <b>glass</b> <b>tubes</b> may be circular, triangular or any other may be used which gives good fixity application with wood and gives better appearance to the bat. Also the unbreakable <b>glass</b> <b>tubes</b> used of different diameters so that players can choose the bat as per their capacity. The colour of <b>glass</b> <b>tubes</b> which are completely filled with mercury can be kept black to avoid the problem of reflection of light.
