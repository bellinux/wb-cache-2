40|$|Introduction. For the {{treatment}} of exocrine pancreatic insufficiency (EPI) it is recommended enzyme replacement therapy with high-dose enteric-coated preparations. In this regard, the question arises about the rationale of clinical application of the older low-dose non enteric-coated <b>enzyme</b> <b>preparations</b> (as a reference drug served Mezim® forte). Results. A number of anatomical and physiological characteristics and active use of suppressants of gastric secretion — proton pump inhibitors, antacids (sodium bicarbonate) — allows significantly to increase the «survival» of pancreatic enzymes that do not contain enteric coating in gastric juice and their delivery to the duodenum. This formulation {{is used for the}} relief of pain in case of chronic pancreatitis (enteric-coated preparations are uneffective). It was proposed to use a combination of two dosage forms — enteric-coated and non enteric-coated — for more effective therapy EPI. In functional diseases of the gastrointestinal tract (irritable bowel syndrome with functional disorders of the pancreas, functional dyspepsia) non enteric-coated <b>enzyme</b> <b>preparations</b> speeds recovery of patients. In inflammatory bowel disease (ulcerative colitis, Crohn’s disease) and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, this formulation increases the duration of remission, and in case of inflammatory bowel disease — also the quality of life during remission. Non enteric-coated <b>enzyme</b> <b>preparations</b> are used {{in a number of other}} diseases associated with maldigestion/malabsorption. Additionally, they are used for the gradual cessation of therapy by high-dose <b>enzyme</b> <b>preparations.</b> They also find application for the correction of EPI during snacks and some gaps in the diet.
