40|$|Dual energy <b>gamma</b> <b>densitometry</b> and 3 -way partial {{least squares}} {{regression}} {{were applied to}} quantify the total volume fractions and improve flow regime identification in multiphase flow. Multiphase flow experiments were carried out with formation water, crude oil and gas from different North Sea gas fields in Statoil's High Pressure Multiphase Flow Loop in Porsgrunn, Norway. Four different flow regimes were investigated (stratified wavy, slug, dispersed and annular). A traversable dual energy gamma densitometer {{was used to measure}} the fluid densities in the pipe. Partial least squares regression was previously applied to identify multiphase flow regimes and quantify volume fractions of gas, oil and water. That study showed promising results for flow regime identification but the predictions of the total volume fractions were not acceptable. In this study a new method combining <b>gamma</b> <b>densitometry</b> and 3 -way partial least squares regression was applied in order to improve the quantitative estimation of the total volume fractions gained the previous study. The proposed 3 -way regression approach allows prediction of the total volume fractions directly using one model instead of multiple models which was reported earlier. The improved quantification of the volume fractions of gas, oil and water was used to improve the flow regime identification plots and increase the interpretability. The new 3 -way prediction results for the volume fractions were significantly better than what was found earlier based on individual PLS models. The root mean square error of prediction for gas, oil and water from the 3 -way PLS models were 4. 1 %, 4. 3 % and 4. 6 % respectively. All models reported were validated based on independent data (test set validation) ...|$|E
40|$|A new {{interfacial}} {{shear stress}} model called {{the law of}} the interface model, based on {{the law of the}} wall approach in turbulent flows, has been developed and locally applied in a fully developed, adiabatic, two-phase annular flow in a duct. Numerical results have been obtained using this model in conjunction with other models available in the literature that are required for the closure of the continuity and momentum equations. These results have been compared with droplet velocity data (using laser Doppler velocimetry and hot film anemometry), void fraction data (using <b>gamma</b> <b>densitometry)</b> and pressure drop data obtained in a R- 134 A refrigerant test facility. Droplet velocity results match the experimental data well, however, the prediction of the void fraction is less accurate. The poor prediction of void fraction, especially for the low void fraction cases, appears to be {{due to the lack of}} a good mechanistic model for entrainment...|$|E
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this {{research}} project is to investigate the applicability of <b>gamma</b> radiation <b>densitometry</b> in fluidized bed behaviour research, and to obtain information about the turbulent fluidization of beds with coarse particles. <b>Gamma</b> radiation <b>densitometry</b> determines the chordally averaged void fraction in the bed by measuring the transmission of gamma radiation through the bed accurately. A dual beam setup was used with two 137 ^Cs gamma radiation sources (662 keV) and detectors, placed 0. 12 m apart and vertically above each other. The technique {{has been applied to}} a fluidized bed with an inner diameter of 0. 384 m filled with Geldart B or Geldart D particles. The Geldart D bed is operated at high gas velocities resulting in operation in the turbulent regime and in a high average void fraction. A linear least squares algorithm for the reconstruction of time averaged void fraction profiles has been developed. It approximates the profile with a linear combination of basis functions. The influence of asymmetry, drift and stochastic errors on the reconstruction accuracy has been investigated. Dominant error sources are gas flow fluctuations, and inaccuracies in the gamma beam-bed and gamma beam-bed wall intersection lengths. Profiles in the Geldart D bed can be measured with up to six reconstruction points, while those in the Geldart B bed have limited reliability. Structure velocity measurements in the turbulent bed have carried out using generalized crosscorrelation techniques on the void fraction signals from the dual beam setup. The techniques give estimates for both the upflow and downflow (Geldart D only) velocities. The dependence of these velocities on gas velocity and measurement height has been studied. Downflow detection is difficult in the freeboard zone, and at low gas velocities where the slugging regime is approached. Structures in the bed have been identified by analysis of time signals, spectra, correlation functions and visual observations. Kramers Laboratorium voor Fysische TechnologieApplied Science...|$|R
40|$|The {{objective}} of this research endeavor {{is to develop a}} Portable Gamma-ray Tomography Instrumentation for investigating corrosion under insulation of pipelines. <b>Gamma</b> ray <b>densitometry</b> is a non- destructive method for determining the density. The principle of gamma ray tomography measurement is based on the absorption of gamma radiation in the tested material. The scanning is performed using a small radioactive source and a sensitive electronic detector. The source and detector are kept external to the pipe and positioned on opposite sides at a fixed distance apart. Gamma rays travel from the source through the pipe to the detector where they are counted. The research covers the hardware design, implementation of measurement electronics as well as the software to receive the intensity counts, convert and display a tomographic image that corresponds correctly to the pipe condition of the pipe being scanned. The research concentrates on pipe condition and not the flow in the pipe.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this {{research}} project {{was to investigate the}} usability of multivariate autoregressive (MAR) modelling in turbulent fluidized bed behaviour research in Geldart D beds. In addition, more information on the turbulent fluidization of beds with coarse particles had to be obtained. The measurement method used in this investigation is <b>gamma</b> radiation <b>densitometry.</b> <b>Gamma</b> radiation densitrometry determines the chordally averaged void fraction in a fluidized bed by measuring the transmission of gamma radiation through the bed accurately. A setup with two radiation sources C^^Cs, 662 keV) and detectors, placed 12 cm apart above each other, was used. This technique has been applied to a fluidized bed of the Geldart D type with an inner diameter of 0. 382 m and a static height of 52 cm. The measurements were performed in {{the lower part of the}} bed (up to 46 cm above the distributor). A linear least squares method for the reconstruction of time averaged void fraction profiles has been implemented. It approximates the true profile as a linear combination of so called basis functions. The dominant error sources are the inaccuracies in the intersection lengths of the gamma beam with the bed and with the wall around the bed. Several MAR-modelling methods have been compared by using test signals. These test signals all assumed that there were only two delay times present in the signal. All modelling gives comparable results. When using small data sets (< 20. 000 points), the Nuttal-Strand modelling is preferred because of the smaller inaccuracies with small data sets. When using larger data sets, the Yule- Walker modelling is preferred because of the much higher computational speed. The velocities of density fluctuations in the bed were determined using both MAR-modelling and the generalised crosscorrelation technique. When using these techniques, the underlying assumption was that there are at most two delay times present in the system. This is a necessary assumption, because with two measured signals these techniques are able to determine two (one upward and one downward) velocities at the most. The possible dependence on gas velocity and measurement height of those velocities has been studied. In the centre of the bed, the determination of the downflow velocities turned out to be impossible for all methods used. Closer to the bed wall, this depends on the gas velocities. When measuring at higher positions in the bed, the MAR-methods give different results compared to the generalised crosscorrelation method. An attempt is made to determine the averaged structure diameter, by using autocorrelations. This gave however diameters that were physically incorrect.

Air flow through quiescent liquids or slurries was studied with a vertical transparent test column, Three similar test series were performed using pure water, and water pulp mixtures with 1 % and 2 % consistency (fiber weight percent). Void fraction profiles were obtained using the gamma-ray denSitometry technique. The observed flow patterns in the pulp suspensions were significantly different than pure water, and those {{reported in the literature}} for non-fibrous three-phase coltmms. Gas channeling was observed at all gas superficial velocities and pulp consistencies, leading to poor mixing and shorter gas residence times.

Gas liquid flow experiments are performed on an industrial scale. <b>Gamma</b> <b>densitometry</b> tomography (GDT) {{is applied to}} measure radial variations in gas holdup at one axial location. Differential pressure (DP) measurements are used to calculate volume averaged gas holdups along the axis of the vessel. The holdups obtained from DP show negligible axial variation for water but significant variations for oil, suggesting that the air water flow is fully developed (minimal flow variations in the axial direction) but that the air oil flow is still developing at the GDT measurement location. The GDT and DP gas holdup results are in good agreement for the air water flow {{but not for the}} air oil flow. Strong flow variations in the axial direction may be impacting the accuracy of one or both of these techniques. DP measurements are also acquired at high sampling frequencies (250 Hz) and are interpreted using statistical analyses to determine the physical mechanism producing each frequency component in the flow. This approach did not yield the information needed to determine the flow regime in these experiments. As a first step toward three phase material distribution measurements, electrical impedance tomography (EIT) and GDT are applied to a liquid solid flow to measure solids holdup.

40|$|Studies on {{the growth}} {{response}} of corals to changing climate have largely focused on long-lived corals with relatively distinct density bands such as massive Porites corals. Little {{is known about the}} climatic response of other more abundant growth forms, such as branching Acropora corals, largely because of the absence of a clear annual density banding pattern. Using a combination of X-radiography, <b>gamma</b> <b>densitometry,</b> Sr/Ca analysis, and Uranium–Thorium (U-Th) dating, we quantified patterns of annual growth in the robust branching coral Isopora palifera from the central Great Barrier Reef (GBR), Australia (18 ° 16 ′S 147 ° 22 ′E) collected in May 2013. While visual analysis of the positive X-radiographs revealed alternating patterns of high- and low-density bands along the central growth axis, gamma-densitometry analysis suggests that these bands do not exhibit a clear annual cycle. In contrast, skeletal Sr/Ca ratios consistently revealed clear patterns of seasonality matching local sea surface temperatures (SST), and provided a growth chronology to calculate linear extension rate, skeletal density and calcification rate. Comparisons between SST-Sr/Ca calibrations derived from our I. palifera samples with (i) massive Porites from the same location and (ii) Isopora spp. from the GBR and Papua New Guinea revealed significant differences of up to 3. 5 °C, implying palaeoclimate reconstructions should use site-specific and species-specific Sr/Ca-SST calibrations. Our approach provides a robust method for assessing changes in growth for a common Indo-Pacific branching coral, and provides a valuable framework for quantifying past and future changes in skeletal growth in response to climate change...|$|E
40|$|Only {{abstract}} of poster available. Track I: Power GenerationThe {{success on}} nuclear energy produced by advanced high temperature gas reactors (AGRs) {{is dependent on}} tri-isotropic (TRISO) fuel particle coating. Today modern AGRs require essentially zero defective/failed coated particles. Unfortunately, the scale-up and design of the current coating processes using gas-solid spouted beds {{have been based on}} empirical approaches and are operated as “black boxes” due to lack of fundamental understanding of the hydrodynamics of spouted bed coaters. Further complicating future fuel-coating technology and nuclear energy production is the fact that fuel kernels of different sizes and densities are required to be manufactured. Therefore, in order to prevent the large risk associated with producing particles that do not meet the specifications, a fundamental understanding of the phenomena occurring in the spouted bed TRISO coater is needed. Accordingly, the overall research objectives of this project are 1) to advance the fundamental understanding of the hydrodynamics TRISO fuel coaters by systematically investigating the effect of design and operating variables, 2) to evaluate the reported dimensionless groups as scaling factors, 3) to establish a reliable scale-up methodology for TRISO fuel particle spouted bed coaters based on hydrodynamics similarity via advanced measurement and computational techniques, and 4) to develop an on-line, non-invasive measurement technique based on <b>gamma</b> ray <b>densitometry</b> (i. e., Nuclear Gauge Densitometry) that can be installed for industrial coater process monitoring to ensure proper performance and operation and to facilitate the developed scale-up methodology. To achieve these objectives the following research tools will be implemented and/or developed: •	Optical probes for solid and gas holdup and solids velocity distribution measurements. •	Gamma ray computed tomography (CT) for measuring the solid and gas holdup cross-sectional distribution along the spouted bed height, spouted diameter, and fountain height. •	Radioactive particle tracking (RPT) technique for measuring the 3 D flow patterns and field, solids velocity, turbulent parameters, circulation time, and many others. •	Gas dynamics measurement technique. •	Pressure transducers.

40|$|Woody {{plants are}} {{encroaching}} into a karst savanna on the Edwards Plateau in central Texas, but {{their impact on}} hydrology is unclear because of high variability in soil depth and uncertainties about shallow and deep root contributions to water uptake, and water dynamics in rocky soil. The overall objectives {{of this study are}} to quantify contributions of shallow and deep roots to water uptake, and to quantify the impact of rock on soil hydraulic properties and water storage. A study was conducted in a karst savanna with ~ 50 % woody cover to monitor spatial and temporal variations in soil moisture and root water uptake with neutron probe and time-domain reflectometry measurements. Bulk density was measured using <b>gamma</b> <b>densitometry.</b> Measurements were made to a depth of 1. 6 m in a 25 m ? 25 m grid (5 m node spacing). The results showed that rock created high spatial variability in water storage. Water storage capacity in the measurement grid ranged from 185 to 401 mm, and coupled with heterogeneous distribution of trees led to high spatial variability in root water uptake. Most of the water uptake came from the upper 1 m of the soil profile, but 10 % came from below 1. 6 m. This indicated that roots had access to water stored within the bedrock, possibly in soil pockets. Statistical analysis showed that spatial distribution of ? was significantly correlated with rock distribution in the profile. Laboratory evaporation measurements showed that Small volume fractions of rock can increase evaporation from soils by slowing upward movement of water, thereby maintaining capillary connectivity to the surface {{for a longer period of}} time. Two simulation models, van Genuchten (VG) and Durner, were compared with the data from evaporation experiments. Results showed that the Durner model was more appropriate than the VG model for describing water retention and hydraulic conductivity of rocky soils...|$|E
40|$|The {{behaviour}} of gas-liquid {{two-phase flow}} {{has been studied}} extensively in the past at near atmospheric pressure in small diameter pipes. However, the industrial reality is the utilisation of large diameter pipes at elevated pressures and there is significantly less information available in this area due principally {{to the cost of}} investigating large diameter pipes. This research relied on using large-scale laboratory facilities at the University of Nottingham, and on using newly developed state of the art multiphase instrumentation. This study tested and applied the wire mesh sensor (WMS). The work included in this thesis utilised the two variants of the WMS; the already established Conductivity WMS and the recently developed Capacitance WMS and the two sensors were compared against each other. The Capacitance WMS was recently supplied by HZDR (Research Institution, Germany) to the University of Nottingham. Extensive experimental campaigns were carried out with this novel sensor. The WMS was initially tested and validated against several other instruments such as high speed camera and <b>gamma</b> <b>densitometry.</b> It was subsequently applied to a large diameter bubble column and large diameter pipe with two phase flow. The aims of this project was {{to gain a better understanding}} of the flow patterns and their transitions in large diameter pipes and to provide real experimental data to assist researchers and engineers in producing relevant and physically sound models for use in larger diameter pipes. As a result of this study, novel and interesting structures which have been labelled as wisps were discovered in large diameter pipes.

40|$|In Part 1, {{detailed}} {{measurements were}} made in a high pressure, adiabatic (boiled at the inlet) annular flow in a narrow, high aspect ratio duct using a gamma densitometer, hot-film anemometer and high-speed video photography. Measurements of void fraction, droplet frequency, velocity, drop size, and interfacial area concentration {{have been made to}} support the three field computational capability. An important aspect of this testing is the use of a modeling fluid (R- 134 a) in a vertical duct which permits visual access in annular flow. This modeling fluid accurately simulates the low liquid-to-vapor density ratio of steam-water flows at high pressures. These measurements have been taken in a narrow duct of hydraulic diameter 4. 85 mm, and a cross-section aspect ratio of 22. 5. However, the flow displays profiles of various shapes not only in the narrow dimension, but also in the width dimension. In particular, the shape of the droplet profiles depends on the entrained droplet flux from the edges in the vapor core. The average diameter from these profiles compare well with the models developed in the literature. Interfacial area concentration for these low density ratio flows is higher than the highest concentration reported for air-water flows. Video records show that along with the bow-shaped waves, three-dimensional {lambda}-shaped waves appear in annular flows for high flow rates. Part 2 outlines the development of a three-field modeling approach in annular flow and the predictive capability of an analysis code. Models have been developed here or adapted from the literature for the thin film near the wall as well as the droplets in the vapor core, and have been locally applied in a fully developed, two-phase adiabatic boiling annular flow in a duct heated at the inlet at high pressure. Numerical results have been obtained using these models that are required for the closure of the continuity and momentum equations. The two-dimensional predictions are compared with local void fraction and droplet velocity (using a hot film anemometer), and average void fraction (using <b>gamma</b> <b>densitometry)</b> for a refrigerant fluid flowing in a narrow vertical duct with a cross-section aspect ratio of 22. 5.

40|$|In {{this thesis}} {{transitional}} oil-water pipe flow is experimentally studied. Here the word transitional relates to two main topics. First, the study {{focuses on the}} investigation of transitional flow patterns and resultant flow phenomena which neither are well described by stratified flow nor by homogeneously dispersed flow. Second, flow development, which can be of extensive length for oil-water flow, is investigated with help of consecutive measurement devices arranged along the test section. The experiments were conducted in two different multiphase flow laboratories. Tap water and different mineral oils with viscosities up to 120 mPa*s were used as test fluids. The well flow loop at the Institute for Energy Technology (IFE) in Kjeller, Norway, provides a transparent 25 m test section with inner diameter D = 100 mm, which is equipped with advanced technology for flow visualization. <b>Gamma</b> <b>densitometry</b> and X-ray tomography were used to obtain detailed measurements of local phase fractions and cross-sectional phase fraction distributions. Three FBRM-probes were installed to investigate droplet size evolution. A static inlet mixer was installed to disturb the flow and enable investigating development of premixed flow. The Multiphase Flow Laboratory at the Norwegian University of Science and Technology (NTNU) provides a transparent test section which is easy to modify. A 50 m long modification with a simple ball valve installed as adjustable inlet mixer was used to investigate flow development in terms of changing flow patterns and pressure gradients. Onset of dispersion at considerably lower mixture velocities compared to other studies without inlet mixing was found. Settling and inflow separation downstream of the mixing devices was observed. The flow development was further {{measured in terms of}} changing droplet sizes and pressure gradients. A rather dense packed droplet layer in {{the upper part of the}} pipe was characteristic for higher input water fractions. The occurrence of the dense packed layer always goes along with a significant increase of the pressure gradient. A simple model for predicting the pressure gradient in dense packed layer flow was proposed. The model considers the dense packed layer as independent phase with its own mixture properties. Model predictions are in good agreement with the measurements while the twofluid model for stratified flow and the homogeneous flow model fail. Furthermore, a tool for the prediction of flow development and development lengths downstream of a mixing device was developed based on simplified settling theory. Applying the tool together with the pressure gradient model allowed for qualitatively reproducing the observed flow development. Locally measured pressure gradient values along the test section could be reproduced with good agreement for low mixture velocities. For higher mixture velocities too fast separation was predicted, as the model does not consider turbulent mixing and droplet break-up...|$|E
