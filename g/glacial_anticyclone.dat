40|$|Wind transported (eolian) sediments {{can serve}} as proxies of {{atmospheric}} phenomena such as wind direction and speed. Landforms composed of eolian deposits can therefore provide climatic information for periods of the past. The Green River Lowland (GRL) {{is an area of}} subdued topography consisting of an extensive, poorly-drained outwash plain and valley train. This region served as a major conduit for glacial meltwater when the Late Wisconsin Lake Michigan Lobe of the Laurentide Ice sheet was at the ice front marked by the Bloomington Moraine in north-central Illinois. Extensive wind reworking of outwash within the GRL has produced a widespread cover of eolian sand. A wide variety of eolian landforms are present within the region including well-defined parabolic, compound parabolic, linear and dome-like dunes and sand sheets. Orientation studies of the parabolic dunes within the region indicate a northwesterly to westerly paleowind direction when the dunes were forming. Preliminary OSL (optically stimulated luminescence) age estimates indicate that the last major period of dune activation was ca. 18, 000 to 14, 000 years ago. This period of time corresponds with the late glacial, a period of critical importance to climate modelers. Dunes within the GRL are adjacent to the Late Wisconsin ice front in Illinois, and are therefore uniquely situated to test Atmospheric General Circulation Models (AGCMs). A feature common to many AGCMs is the presence of a strong <b>glacial</b> <b>anticyclone</b> over the interior of North America during the last glacial maximum. Although weaker and not as extensive, the feature is still present 14, 000 years ago. According to these models, winds generated from this high pressure cell would have been easterly or northeasterly to the south of the Laurentide ice sheet. The contrast between modeled paleowind direction and those indicated by dune orientations within the GRL is striking. This discrepancy has also been noted in the loess record, suggesting that the AGCMs need to be modified, or that eolian deposition south of the of the Laurentide ice margin were the result of surface northwesterly winds unrelated to the presence of the <b>glacial</b> <b>anticyclone...</b>|$|E
40|$|Peoria Loess {{deposited}} in western Iowa {{during the last}} glacial maximum (LGM) shows distinct geochemical and particle-size variations {{as a function of}} both depth and distance east of the Missouri River. Geochemical and particle-size data indicate that Peoria Loess in western Iowa probably had two sources: the Missouri River valley, and a source that lay {{to the west of the}} Missouri River. Both sources indicate that LGM paleowinds in western Iowa had a strong westerly component, similar to interpretations of previous workers. A compilation of loess studies in Iowa and elsewhere indicates that westerlv winds were dominant during loess transport over much of the mid-continent south of the Laurentide ice sheet, which is not in agreement with paleowinds simulated by atmospheric general circulation models (AGCMs). AGCMs consistently generate a <b>glacial</b> <b>anticyclone</b> with easterly or northeasterly winds over the Laurentide ice sheet and the area to the south of it. Loess deposition in the mid-continent during the LGM may be a function of infrequent northwesterly winds that were unrelated to the presence of the glacial anticyclon...|$|E
40|$|Many Tasmanian {{deposits}} {{previously described}} as ‘periglacial’ {{have been described}} in more detail, re-interpreted and dated. We suggest that ‘periglacial’ has little meaning when applied locally and the term ‘relict cold-climate deposits’ is more appropriate. In this paper we examine the origin and age of relict cold-climate slope deposits, fan alluvium and aeolian sediments in Tasmania, and infer {{the conditions under which}} they accumulated. Fan alluvium dating from the penultimate Glacial (OIS 6) and capped by a prominent palaeosol deduced to date to the Last Interglacial (OIS 5 e) is present at Woodstock, south of Hobart. Many fan deposits formed before 40 ka or in a period c. 30 – 23 ka; only a few deposits date to the Last Glacial Maximum in Tasmania, which is defined as spanning the period 23. 5 – 17. 5 ka. Slope deposits indicate widespread instability down to present-day sea level throughout the Last Glacial, probably as a result of freeze–thaw in a sparsely vegetated landscape. Layered fine gravel and coarse sand colluvial deposits resembling grèzes litées, produced both by dry deposition and by the action of water, are locally common where jointed siltstone bedrock outcrops. These deposits occur from altitudes of 500 m to near sea level and also in caves and must have formed under sparse vegetation cover, probably by freeze–thaw in extremely dry conditions. They have been radiocarbon dated from 35 to 17. 5 cal. ka. Relict dunes and sandsheets are widespread at the margin of the Bassian Plain that once provided a land bridge between Tasmania and the mainland. They are also found in western Tasmania and in areas of inland southern Tasmania that now support wet eucalypt forest and rainforest and receive mean annual rainfall 3 ̆e 1500 mm. In the south they have been dated 3 ̆e 87. 5 – 19 ka and attest to a long period of semi-arid climate in an area extending well to the west and south of the present semiarid zone. We deduce that during most of the Last <b>Glacial</b> <b>anticyclones</b> dominated Tasmania 2 ̆ 7 s climate and rain-bearing depressions generally passed south of the land mass. However in the east prominent palaeosols in aeolian deposits, dated between 26. 4 ka and 16 ka at different locations, and palaeosols with morphology indicating formation under humid conditions, indicate periods of wetter climate in eastern Tasmania during or close to the LGM, deduced {{to be the result of}} easterlies associated with near-coastal depressions in the western Tasman Sea. Such easterlies may also be responsible for short Last Glacial wet periods noted at mainland coastal sites. A plot of ages of all dated deposits reveals an increase of erosion and deposition between 35 and 20 ka, and greater prevalence of aeolian deposits in the 35 – 15 ka period than earlier in the Last Glacial. There are two possible explanations for this pattern: (1) that aeolian activity increased as the result of climatic effects (e. g. increased windiness); or (2) that shrubland biomass increased after the megafauna were hunted to extinction following human arrival c. 40 ka, causing increased fire frequency, and in the cold dry climate of the late Last Glacial such fires caused increased erosion and increased aeolian accumulation...|$|R
40|$|Reconstructions of monthly mean sea-level grid-point {{pressure}} from station pressure data over the Arctic region using an objective technique have revealed two serious {{errors in the}} gridded data. First, all gridded data (from the U. S. Historical Weather Map series) for the Arctic Ocean area away from the North Atlantic sector appears to be between 4 and 6 mb too high before about 1931. The semi-permanent Arctic high produced in the early historical map series {{was the result of}} a lack of basic station data, and the belief amongst many North American meteorologists of the 1920 s and 1930 s of the existence of a polar or <b>glacial</b> <b>anticyclone.</b> The second error affects only north-western North America for the years 1899 - 1909. Here pressure is again too high compared with reconstructed data. The cause of this error is not immediately apparent, but is probably the result of an erroneous correction to sea level for stations in the region. Both errors seriously affect the homogeneity of the gridded Arctic series. The objective scheme used to reveal the errors, can also be used to derive correction factors for the gridded data prior to 1931...|$|E
40|$|Changes in lake status, {{a measure}} of {{relative}} water depth or lake level, have been reconstructed from geological and biological evidence for 87 sites in northern Europe. During the early Holocene. the lakes show conditions similar to or drier than present in a broad band across southern Britain, southern Scandinavia and into the eastern Baltic and wetter conditions along the west coast and in central Europe. This pattern {{is consistent with the}} effects of a <b>glacial</b> <b>anticyclone</b> over the Scandinavian Ice Sheet, namely enhanced southwesterly flow along the west coast and strengthened easterlies south of the ice. After c, 8000 BP a different lake status pattern was established. with conditions drier than present over much of northern Europe. Lakes higher than today were confined to the far north, the west coast, eastern Finland and western Russia. This pattern gradually attenuated after 4000 BP. Differences in lake status during the mid- to late Holocene are consistent with a strengthening of the blocking anticyclone over the Baltic Sea in summer. resulting in more meridional circulation than today. This strengthening of the blocking anticyclone during the mid-Holocene is interpreted as a consequence of insolation changes, enhanced {{by the fact that the}} Baltic Sea was larger than present...|$|E
40|$|A {{high-resolution}} pollen {{record from}} Fargher Lake, Washington shows {{a series of}} millennial-scale changes in vegetation and climate during marine isotope stages (MIS) 3 and 2. A comparison of Fargher Lake with pollen records from Little Lake, Oregon and Carp Lake, Washington, reveals regional patterns of change. During {{the early part of}} MIS 3 (ca 60, 000 – 45, 000 cal yr BP), Fargher and Carp lakes indicate transitions between open and closed vegetation and cold dry and warm wet conditions. Between 45, 000 and 27, 500 cal yr BP, all three records show shifts between low- and high-elevation taxa that indicate a series of temperature changes. These temperature changes are similar to those in the Santa Barbara Basin and may be explained by changes in the strength of the Aleutian low. During MIS 2 (27, 500 – 14, 000 cal yr BP), shifts between wet- and dry-adapted taxa were most prominent at Little Lake. There is also evidence for two minor warmings. MIS 2 climate variations do not correlate well with those in the Santa Barbara Basin. However, precipitation changes in the Pacific Northwest during MIS 2 correlate with evidence of ice-sheet surges into the North Atlantic and were probably related to variations in the strength and position of the <b>glacial</b> <b>anticyclone</b> and the je...|$|E
40|$|Pollen and geochemical {{data from}} Little Lake, western Oregon, suggest several {{patterns}} of millennial-scale environmental change during marine isotope stage (MIS) 2 (14, 100 – 27, 600 cal yr B. P.) {{and the latter}} part of MIS 3 (27, 600 – 42, 500 cal yr B. P.). During MIS 3, a series of transitions between warm- and cold-adapted taxa indicate that temperatures oscillated by ca. 2 ±– 4 ±C every 1000 – 3000 yr. Highs and lows in summer insolation during MIS 3 are generally associated with the warmest and coldest intervals. Warm periods at Little Lake correlate with warm sea-surface temperatures in the Santa Barbara Basin. Changes in the strength of the subtropical high and the jet stream may account for synchronous changes at the two sites. During MIS 2, shifts between mesic and xeric subalpine forests suggest changes in precipitation every 1000 – 3000 yr. Increases in Tsuga heterophylla pollen at 25, 000 and 22, 000 cal yr B. P. imply brief warmings. Minimum summer insolation and maximum global ice-volumes during MIS 2 correspond to cold and dry conditions. Fluctuations in precipitation at Little Lake do not correlate with changes in the Santa Barbara Basin and may be explained by variations in the strength of the <b>glacial</b> <b>anticyclone</b> and the position of the jet stream...|$|E
40|$|We present {{new data}} on the {{provenance}} and paleoclimatic significance of last-glacial (Peoria) loess in Nebraska. Spatial variability of particle size indicates paleowinds from the northwest, in disagreement with climate models that generate northeasterly winds from a <b>glacial</b> <b>anticyclone.</b> Geochemical data show variability {{in the amount of}} carbonate leaching, temporally and spatially. Decreased syndepositional carbonate leaching upsection mirrors progressively increasing mass accumulation rates. Syndepositional leaching of carbonate was greatest at localities in eastern Nebraska, and lower westward into eastern Colorado. We hypothesize that this reflects an eastward-increasing moisture gradient, similar to that of today. The reconstructed moisture gradient is consistent with a zonal circulation pattern, in agreement with westerly or northwesterly paleowinds at the time of loess deposition. The origin of Peoria loess in the central Great Plains has been debated for almost six decades. Isotopic and geochemical data indicate that the most important source in Nebraska is fine-grained volcaniclastic siltstone of the White River Group, with smaller additions from other sediments. The Nebraska Sand Hills was also a source of loess, but probably only in areas proximal to this major dune field. It is likely, however, that fine-grained silts were transported episodically through the Nebraska Sand Hills from White River Group and other sources to the north. A new computer model of climate and dust generation [Mahowald et al., 2006, JGR] simulates the central Great Plains as a significant non-glacial dust source during the last glacial period, in good agreement with our results...|$|E
40|$|Several abrupt climate events {{during the}} Holocene, {{including}} the widely documented oscillation at 8. 2 thousand years before present (ka), {{are attributed to}} changes in the North Atlantic thermohaline circulation. Additional mechanisms, such as interactions between atmospheric circulation, ice-sheet dynamics, and the influence of solar irradiance, also have been proposed to explain abrupt climatic events, but evidence remains elusive. This study presents evidence from multi-proxy analyses on the Holocene sediments of Eleanor Lake, interior British Columbia. Climatic inferences from our decadal-resolution record of biogenic silica (BSi) abundance are supported by changes in diatom and pollen assemblages from the same core and correlations with existing regional climate records. The BSi record reveals abrupt and persistent climatic shifts at 10. 2, 9. 3, and 8. 5 ka, the latter two of which are coeval with major collapses of the Laurentide Ice Sheet. The record also reveals a short-term cooling at 8. 2 ka that is distinct from the 8. 5 ka event and similar in magnitude to several other late-Holocene coolings. BSi is correlated with solar-irradiance indices (r = 0. 43 – 0. 61), but the correlation is opposite in sign to that expected from direct solar forcing and weakens after 8 ka. Possible mechanisms causing the abrupt and persistent climate changes of the early Holocene include 1) sudden losses of ice and proglacial lake extent, causing a shift in the meridional structure of atmospheric circulation, 2) a possible link between solar minima and El Niño-like conditions that are correlated with warm spring temperature in interior British Columbia, and 3) the influence of solar irradiance variability on the position of the polar jet, possibly via effects on the strength of the <b>glacial</b> <b>anticyclone.</b> ...|$|E
40|$|From its {{beginning}} in 1868 German polar expeditions {{were focused on}} scientific exploration. History shows that around 1910 only well prepared and equipped expeditions were successful and could gain valuable experiences. The training expedition of the Bavarian officer Wilhelm Filchner who subsequently led the German Antarctic Expedition (1911 – 1912) was one of these. This is contrasted by the preliminary expedition to Nordaustlandet (Svalbard) of the west Prussian officer Herbert Schroder-Stranz. Other expeditions gave rise to longrange investigations like the permanently occupied German Geophysical Observatory on Svalbard (1911 – 1914) established for {{the investigation of the}} upper air by aerological measurements to prepare a future exploration of the Arctic by airships. There was a long tradition for German scientific expeditions to Greenland, which is represented for instance by Alfred Wegener‘s meteorological programme to investigate the <b>glacial</b> <b>anticyclone.</b> The year 1930 was a fateful year for German polar research, when he died on the ice-cap and geologist Hans Kurt Erich Krueger vanished in the north Canadian archipelago. Both men represented science as well as adventure. International projects initiated or organised from the German side were always successful. Georg von Neumayer, director of the German Navy Observatory (Deutsche Seewarte), {{played an important role in}} organising the 1 st International Polar Year (1882 – 883) after the untimely death of Karl Weyprecht. Only extensive research without recognition of national borders would provide new scientific knowledge in meteorology and earth magnetics for weather forecast and shipping. After World War I economical ideas concerning the introduction of trans-arctic air traffic lead to the foundation of the International Society for the Exploration of the Arctic Regions by Means of Aircraft (Aeroarctic). In the meteorological planning of the first expedition with the airship LZ 127 “Graf Zeppelin” to the Russian Arctic, the results of the German Geophysical Observatory in Svalbard were used. This paper discusses the connections between science and adventure established through the German expeditions...|$|E
40|$|Biogenic carbonates are {{valuable}} archives of paleoenvironmental information because they record chemical signatures of ambient environmental conditions during their formation. Therefore, long-term records of biogenic carbonates provide long-term records of environmental conditions {{that can be}} utilized to develop climate histories for specific regions to explore past climatic change. Traditionally, these {{studies have been conducted}} with low temporal resolution owing to analytical or economical restrictions. Although these records provide valuable information surrounding long-term climatic change, they lack the resolution to resolve the short-term climatic oscillations such as the Pacific Decadal Oscillation and El Niño Southern Oscillation that drive environmental change. This dissertation focuses on using high-resolution stable isotope analysis of biogenic carbonates for paleoenvironmental reconstruction and associated applications. Three studies are presented herein, applying increasing sampling resolution from sub-centennial, to sub-decadal, to sub-seasonal, that illustrate the diversity of paleoenvironmental information gained with each increase in resolution. The first study uses sub-centennial oxygen isotope analysis of authigenic lake carbonate to assess how climate change has affected precipitation patterns in the southern Yukon Territory {{from the end of the}} last glacial to the present day. Large changes in atmospheric circulation patterns associated with changes in the strength of the North Pacific High and the Aleutian Low pressure systems lead to variations in the oxygen isotope value of precipitation in the southwest Yukon Territory recorded in the oxygen isotope values of lake carbonate. The degradation of a <b>glacial</b> <b>anticyclone</b> led to a reduction in strength of the Aleutian Low coupled with an increase in the strength of the North Pacific High resulting in an increase in summer precipitation to the southwest Yukon represented by an increase in effective moisture following the transition from the Late Pleistocene to the Early Holocene. The second study is a sub-decadal oxygen isotope record of lacustrine carbonate stretching back 8, 000 years to quantify the strength and state of the Pacific/North American (PNA) Index through time. This study relies on the relationship between the PNA Index and the oxygen isotope values of precipitation from central Canada (Birks and Edwards, 2009), and the ability of Sturgeon Lake to accurately represent 18 O values of precipitation. Results show that the strength of the PNA varied through time. The Early to Mid-Holocene (8, 000 - 4, 200 years BP) is characterized by large fluctuations between PNA+ and PNA– phases; PNA–-like conditions dominate the period after 4, 200 years BP; and ~ 1, 800 years BP PNA+-like conditions resume. Changes in the Holocene PNA pattern are shown to be contemporaneous with similar changes in Holocene records of El Niño illustrating the intrinsic relationship between Pacific climate patterns. The final study uses sub-seasonal oxygen isotope records from bivalves derived from an overwash deposit to define the seasonality of the deposit. Data indicate a late spring to early summer timing of deposition that presents an alternative interpretation to the previous late fall tsunami origin hypothesis. In conclusion, this dissertation focused on improving our understanding of how paleoenvironmental information is archived in biogenic carbonates by focusing on the use of high-resolution sampling strategies. Modifying the sampling resolution resulted in an enhanced understanding of how short-term climate oscillations drive climate and illustrates how the type of paleoenvironmental information generated varies with sampling resolution...|$|E
