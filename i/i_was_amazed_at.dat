60|$|<b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>amazed</b> <b>at</b> the sum, {{and must}} have showed my {{surprise}} upon my features.|$|E
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>amazed</b> <b>at</b> the {{simplicity}} of the thing, and I embraced the good Abbot. The Bart, however, had some objections to offer.|$|E
6000|$|<b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>amazed</b> <b>at</b> {{the calm}} {{way in which}} he rippled on. [...] "Surely there is not a moment to be lost," [...] I cried, [...] "shall I go and order you a cab?" ...|$|E
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>amazed</b> <b>at</b> this spring, this {{conflagration}} Of green fires lit on {{the soil}} of the earth, this blaze Of growing, and sparks that puff in wild gyration, Faces of people streaming across my gaze.|$|R
6000|$|... "My lord, <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>amazed</b> <b>at</b> the indiscretion of a demigod," [...] said Babbalanja, as {{we passed}} on our way; [...] "I {{recognized}} your sultanic style the very first sentence. This, then, {{is the result of}} your hours of seclusion." ...|$|R
5000|$|The kind {{of ideas}} that he works with {{are one of the}} most difficult, and <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>amazed</b> <b>at</b> their variety and depth. Also, he knows how to draw, and to draw in a funny way. I think that he is a giant. [...] - [...] Charles M. Schulz ...|$|R
6000|$|At first <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>amazed</b> <b>at</b> their actions, and then, as the ridiculousness of the {{situation}} presented itself, I smiled. [...] "A guilty conscience needeth no accuser," [...] it is said, and this truth was verified to the letter.|$|E
60|$|Again {{there was}} a spell of silence, and at last, when Mademoiselle spoke, <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>amazed</b> <b>at</b> the calm voice in which she {{addressed}} him, marvelling at the strength and courage of one so frail and childlike to behold.|$|E
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>amazed</b> <b>at</b> my own calmness. My {{interview}} with Major Fitz-David had, perhaps, exhausted my capacity for feeling any strong emotion, {{for the time}} at least. It {{was a relief to}} me to be alone; {{it was a relief to}} me to begin the search. Those were my only sensations so far.|$|E
6000|$|... "I hope not, Harry," [...] said Hamilton, in a subdued tone; [...] "I hope not. Believe me, <b>I</b> <b>am</b> not {{naturally}} violent. <b>I</b> should <b>be</b> {{very sorry}} were {{you to think}} so. Indeed, I never felt thus before, and now that it <b>is</b> over <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>amazed</b> <b>at</b> myself; but surely you'll admit that there was great provocation. Such terrible cruelty to--" ...|$|R
25|$|Lionel Murphy {{was a real}} radical. <b>I</b> <b>am</b> still <b>amazed</b> <b>at</b> his vision. He {{shocked the}} system.|$|R
6000|$|... "Under any {{ordinary}} circumstances, I {{should have}} used my influence {{to help you}} on in the world. But, when you not only hold the most abominable political opinions, but actually proclaim those opinions in public, <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>amazed</b> <b>at</b> your audacity in writing to me. There must be no more communication between us. While you are a Socialist, you are a stranger to me." ...|$|R
60|$|Coldly {{as these}} words were said <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>amazed</b> <b>at</b> the concession. He {{snatched}} {{her right hand}} with such fervour that I {{thought he was going}} to press it to his lips or his breast. But he only held it by the finger-tips in his great paw and shook it a little up and down while he delivered his last volley of words.|$|E
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>amazed</b> <b>at</b> the {{national}} {{feelings of the}} man. No European, when abroad, could speak of his country with more pride than Marbonna. He assured me, again and again, that so soon as he had obtained sufficient money to purchase twenty muskets, and as many bags of powder, {{he was going to}} return to a place with which Imeeo was not worthy to be compared.|$|E
60|$|The {{aspect of}} the people too, at the {{stations}} and in the towns we passed, puzzled me. There were no uniforms, no soldiers. But <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>amazed</b> <b>at</b> the number of commercial travellers, Lutheran ministers, photographers, and so forth, and the odd resemblance they presented, {{in spite of their}} innocent costumes, to the arrogant and ubiquitous military officers whom I had observed on my former visit.|$|E
6000|$|Windsor Castle, Dec. 10.—Here <b>I</b> <b>am</b> {{with six}} candles blazing! of [...] which I shall {{put out a}} larger {{proportion}} when no longer afraid of [...] {{a visit from the}} great people about the passages. I got your [...] letter this morning, but <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>amazed</b> <b>at</b> your thinking <b>I</b> have the [...] pluck to ask the Princess of Wales! or the Queen!!! about [...] photographs promised or not promised.|$|R
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>was</b> simply <b>amazed</b> <b>at</b> this {{magnificent}} prospect. 'The cycle trade must be honeycombed with middlemen's profits!' I cried; for I had my misgivings.|$|R
6000|$|... 316 “Outside the Roman state, <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>amazed</b> <b>at</b> the Italian {{government}} [...] giving {{over into}} the hands of the pope not only the nomination to [...] the bishoprics as spiritual offices, but a nomination which is to [...] carry with it the temporalities of the sees. They ought to know [...] their own business best; but to me it seems that this is liberality [...] carried into folly; and I know that some Italians think so.”—To [...] Lord Granville, Dec. 21, 1870.|$|R
6000|$|<b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>amazed</b> <b>at</b> {{the startled}} alacrity of R's [...] "Yes, sir." [...] He ran before {{me out on}} the landing. My new dignity sat yet so lightly on me that I was not aware that it was I, the Captain, the object of this last graciousness. It seemed as if {{all of a sudden}} a pair of wings had grown on my shoulders. I merely skimmed along the {{polished}} floor.|$|E
60|$|The bear {{soon came}} to the tree, and we {{followed}} at a distance. The first thing he did, {{he stopped at the}} gun, smelt to it, but let it lie, and up he scrambles into the tree, climbing like a cat, though so monstrous heavy. <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>amazed</b> <b>at</b> the folly, as I thought it, of my man, and could not for my life see any thing to laugh at yet, till seeing the bear get up the tree, we all rode nearer to him.|$|E
6000|$|I {{remember}} my first {{experience of a}} hill, after having been always shut within [...] "these narrow limits." [...] It {{was one of the}} range of sierras near Cape Corrientes, and not above eight hundred feet high; yet, when I had gained the summit, <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>amazed</b> <b>at</b> the vastness of the earth, as it appeared to me from that modest elevation. Persons born and bred on the pampas, when they first visit a mountainous district, frequently experience a sensation as of [...] "a ball in the throat" [...] which seems to prevent free respiration.|$|E
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>was</b> so <b>amazed</b> <b>at</b> this {{sight that}} I could not speak. I could only {{stare at the}} place where the huge monster had gone down.|$|R
60|$|If his Grace can {{contemplate}} {{the result of}} this complete innovation, or, as some friends of his will call it, reform, in the whole body of its solidity and compound mass, at which, as Hamlet says, the face of heaven glows with horror and indignation, and which, in truth, makes every reflecting mind and every feeling heart perfectly thought-sick, without a thorough abhorrence of everything they say and everything they do, <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>amazed</b> <b>at</b> the morbid strength or the natural infirmity of his mind.|$|R
6000|$|<b>I</b> <b>was</b> in no humour (as your English saying is) to mince matters, in {{controlling}} this new outbreak {{on the part}} of my evergreen parent. I insisted on instantly removing him from Paris, and taking him on a continental tour. <b>I</b> <b>was</b> proof against his paternal embraces; <b>I</b> <b>was</b> deaf to his noble sentiments. He declared he should die on the road. When I look back <b>at</b> it now, <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>amazed</b> <b>at</b> my own cruelty. I said, [...] "En route, Papa!"--and packed him up, and took him to Italy.|$|R
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>amazed</b> <b>at</b> his insight. And for {{the moment}} was impelled to make a clean breast of my suspicions,--nay, of my {{convictions}} of the whole devil's plot. But I had no proofs. I remembered that to the colonel my uncle was a gentleman of respectability and of wealth, {{and a member of}} his Excellency's Council. That to accuse him of scheming for my inheritance would gain me nothing in Mr. Washington's esteem. And I caught myself before I had said aught of Mr. Allen's conduct that evening.|$|E
6000|$|Like {{everyone}} else who saw it at this time <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>amazed</b> <b>at</b> the grandeur of [...] "The White City," [...] and impatiently anxious to have all my friends and relations share in my enjoyment of it. My father {{was back on the}} farm in Dakota and I wrote to him at once urging him to come down. [...] "Frank will be here in June and we will take charge of you. Sell the cook stove if necessary and come. You must see this fair. On the way back I will go as far as West Salem and we'll buy that homestead I've been talking about." ...|$|E
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>amazed</b> <b>at</b> {{all this}} munificence of the Spaniard, and very glad I was that I had sent my {{midshipman}} {{for the things}} I intended to present him with, for I was as well able to requite him for a large present as he was to make it, and had resolved it before I knew he had sent anything to the ships; so that this exchanging of presents was but a kind of generous barter or commerce; for as to gold, we had either of us so much, {{that it was not}} at all equal in value to what we had to give on both sides, as we were at present situated.|$|E
6000|$|... 'I {{have read}} certain {{statements}} you sent me from English papers on cruelty to Boer refugee families. <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>amazed</b> <b>at</b> the iniquity {{of men who}} circulate such lies, and the credulity of those who believe them. The opinion of Germans, French, Americans, and even many Dutch, here on the spot, is that the leniency and amazing liberality of the Government to their foes is prolonging the war. A Dutch girl in the Pretoria Camp declared to the nurse that for seven months {{they had not been}} able to get such good food as was given them by the British.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Lady," [...] he said, [...] "I {{regret to}} disturb and intrude on a {{mourning}} family, but <b>I</b> <b>am</b> much <b>amazed</b> <b>at</b> the tidings I have heard; and I must pray {{of you to}} confirm them." ...|$|R
60|$|I may {{confess that}} <b>I</b> <b>was</b> vastly <b>amazed</b> <b>at</b> {{the value of}} the stone, which was far greater than I had {{conceived}} a notion of, but I strove to show nothing of my sentiments to my interlocutor.|$|R
60|$|This frighted {{me out of}} my wits, for I had {{nobody to}} vouch for me what I was, or from whence I came; but the good Padre Antonio, for that was his name, cleared me of that part by a way I did not {{understand}}; for he came to me one morning with two sailors, and told me they must search me, to bear witness that I was not a Turk. <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>amazed</b> <b>at</b> them, and frighted, and did not understand them, nor could I imagine what they intended to do to me. However, stripping me, they were soon satisfied, and Father Antony bade me be easy, for they could all witness that I was no Turk. So I escaped that part of my master's cruelty.|$|E
6000|$|... "We went to dinner; {{he asked}} me to sit beside him. The {{conversation}} fell, among other topics, on the Elector Palatine's Mistress," [...] crotchety old gentleman, never out of quarrels, with Heidelberg Protestants, heirs of Julich and Berg, and in general with an unreasonable world, whom we saw at Mannheim last year; has a Mistress,--"Elector Valatine's Mistress, called Taxis. Crown-Prince said: 'I should like to know what that good old gentleman does with a Mistress?' I answered, that the fashion had come so much in vogue, Princes did not think they were Princes unless they had mistresses; and that <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>amazed</b> <b>at</b> the facility of women, how they could shut their eyes on the sad reverse of fortune nearly inevitable for them;--and instanced the example of Madam Gravenitz"-- ...|$|E
6000|$|<b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>amazed</b> <b>at</b> the {{interest}} and knowledge which all these great people showed about the ring, for they not only had the deeds of the principal men of the time--Belcher, Mendoza, Jackson, or Dutch Sam-- at their fingers' ends, {{but there was no}} fighting man so obscure {{that they did not know}} the details of his deeds and prospects. The old ones and then the young were discussed--their weight, their gameness, their hitting power, and their constitution. Who, as he saw Sheridan and Fox eagerly arguing as to whether Caleb Baldwin, the Westminster costermonger, could hold his own with Isaac Bittoon, the Jew, would have guessed that the one was the deepest political philosopher in Europe, and that the other would be remembered as the author of the wittiest comedy and of the finest speech of his generation? ...|$|E
60|$|He {{held his}} cards in his hand, but his jaw had fallen, {{and his eyes}} were staring over my {{shoulder}} with the most dreadful expression of consternation and surprise. I whisked round, and <b>I</b> <b>was</b> myself <b>amazed</b> <b>at</b> what <b>I</b> saw.|$|R
40|$|It {{was during}} the {{seasonal}} change from summer to autumn that I first landed in Tokyo as a naïve 21 year old, ready {{to embark on a}} working holiday adventure. I had no Japanese language skills, no knowledge of Japanese history or culture beyond western clichés and stereotypes, and 1000 yen in my pocket. When I think back to this time <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>amazed</b> <b>at</b> the courage (or was it denial and ignorance?) I must have had; <b>I</b> <b>am</b> even more surprised to remember the emotion I experienced, for as soon as I set foot in that great cosmopolitan city, <b>I</b> <b>was</b> in love. Somehow, I sensed something familiar and warm in the strange new sights and sounds around me, and gladly immersed myself in this new relationship I had found with Japan...|$|R
40|$|I want {{to begin}} by reading two letters to you which were {{published}} in the 1 April 1985 issue of Time magazine under the heading LIBRARY BYTES. The first letter, from Kenneth N. Sharpe of Peachtree City, Georgia, asked a question: I see a conspiracy in the public library. Advocates of computers convinced us that we should replace benign, inexpensive, non-energy consuming card catalogs with expensive, maintenance-requiring, energy-consuming terminals. This is progress? 1 James A. Munn in Milwaukee writes with another opinion: Each time I work on a computer, <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>amazed</b> <b>at</b> the potential it has and the abundance of information <b>I</b> <b>am</b> able to retrieve.
