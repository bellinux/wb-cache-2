5|$|Four {{weeks after}} the Wimbledon final, Federer again faced Murray on the Wimbledon centre court, this time for {{the final of the}} 2012 Summer Olympics. This came after an epic 4-hour 26-minute {{semifinal}} against Juan Martín del Potro of Argentina that Federer won 19–17 in the third and <b>final</b> <b>set.</b> He lost to Murray in straight sets in the final, winning a silver medal for his country.|$|E
5|$|Kuznetsova's form dipped {{following}} {{the conclusion of}} the spring hard-court season, as she won just three of five matches on clay leading up to the French Open. She advanced to the semifinals without dropping a set, but then lost to Safina. At Wimbledon, Kuznetsova lost in the fourth round to Agnieszka Radwańska, after leading by a break in the third and <b>final</b> <b>set.</b>|$|E
5|$|Marc Isambard Brunel {{established}} the world's first mass production line at Portsmouth Block Mills making pulley blocks for rigging on the navy's ships. The first machines were installed in January 1803 and the <b>final</b> <b>set</b> for large blocks in March 1805. In 1808, the mills produced 130,000 blocks. By {{the turn of}} the 19th century, the town had the largest industrial site in the world with a workforce of 8000 and an annual budget of £570,000.|$|E
30|$|As {{shown in}} Table  4, SPs have similar {{influence}} regularity on the <b>final</b> <b>setting</b> time. The <b>final</b> <b>setting</b> time shortens by 13  min when the LP is 5  %, the <b>final</b> <b>setting</b> {{time is the}} same as the control when the content of LP is 10 – 15  %, and it increases by 10  min when the content of LP is greater than 15  %. For QP, the <b>final</b> <b>setting</b> time {{is the same as}} the control when the content is 5  %, and it delays by 3 – 12  min when the content is greater than 5  %. The <b>final</b> <b>setting</b> time increases by 3 – 15  min when GP is mixed at any content.|$|R
30|$|In conclusion, {{the three}} kinds of SP all make the normal {{consistency}} of cement increase; the initial and <b>final</b> <b>setting</b> times delay when the content of LP is 5  %, {{and they have no}} great change when the content increases; the initial and <b>final</b> <b>setting</b> times slightly prolongs when QP or GP is mixed.|$|R
40|$|Abstract: Some {{aspects of}} {{design of the}} {{discriminant}} functions that {{in the best way}} separate points of predefined <b>final</b> <b>sets</b> are considered. The concept is introduced of the nested discriminant functions which allow to separate correctly points of any of the <b>final</b> <b>sets.</b> It is proposed to apply some methods of non-smooth optimization to solve arising extremal problems efficiently...|$|R
5|$|Murray next participated at the Citi Open (for {{the first}} time since 2006), as the top seed and {{favourite}} to win the tournament. However, he suffered a defeat in his first match, losing to world No. 53 Teymuraz Gabashvili in a <b>final</b> <b>set</b> tiebreak, despite serving for the match. In doubles, he partnered Daniel Nestor, however they lost in the first round to the fourth seeds, Rohan Bopanna and Florin Mergea, also in three sets.|$|E
5|$|Perowne {{goes on to}} his squash match, still {{thinking}} about the incident. He loses the long and contested game by a technicality in the <b>final</b> <b>set.</b> After lunch he buys some fish from a local fishmonger for dinner. He visits his mother, suffering from vascular dementia, who is cared for in a nursing home.|$|E
5|$|Radio Cross Days, a radio drama {{broadcast}} from January 8, 2009 to March 25, 2010, {{was the second}} and <b>final</b> <b>set</b> of audio compilations made for the game by Lantis. Released as a first and second disc on June 23 and July 21, 2010, respectively, each album contained thirty-two segments of the broadcast, comprising the sixty-four total that were aired.|$|E
30|$|Table  8 {{reveals that}} MSWI BA delayed both the initial and <b>final</b> <b>setting</b> times {{compared}} with the times for OPC, particularly for high replacement levels. Both initial and <b>final</b> <b>setting</b> times increased {{with the amount of}} cement replaced with the fine MSWI BA. At waste dosages less than 50  %, the initial setting time was 17 – 61  min longer for the mixture than for the ordinary cement mortar and the <b>final</b> <b>setting</b> time was 18 – 65  min longer for the mixture than for the ordinary cement mortar. The variation was so small that it will hardly affect the requirements of construction. However, when the addition of MSWI BA was increased further to 50  %, there was {{a significant increase in the}} setting times, particularly the <b>final</b> <b>setting</b> time, compared with those of the reference mortar (C 0). Experimental results indicated that the observed delay in the setting times may be primarily attributed to the rate of the pozzolanic reactions (Lin et al. 2008).|$|R

5|$|The first episode, {{broadcast}} on 21 August 2010, featured auditions from Glasgow and London, while episode two, on 28 August, showcased Dublin's auditions and more from London. More London auditions were shown on 4 September, {{along with those}} from Birmingham, and Cardiff was featured in the 11 September broadcast along with the <b>final</b> <b>set</b> of London auditions. Finally, the Manchester auditions were shown in the 18 and 19 September episodes.|$|E
5|$|After {{playing an}} {{exhibition}} match, Murray started the French Open with three tough wins, before losing in straight sets to Tomáš Berdych {{in the fourth}} round. In London, Murray progressed to the third round, where he faced Mardy Fish. At 3–3 in the <b>final</b> <b>set</b> with momentum going Murray's way (he had {{just come back from}} 3–0 down), the match was called off for bad light, leaving Murray fuming. Coming back the next day, Murray was edged out by the eventual finalist in a tie-breaker for his second defeat by him in the year. At Wimbledon, Murray progressed to the semifinals, losing to Nadal in straight sets. On 27 July 2010, Murray and his coach Maclagan split, and Murray replaced him with Àlex Corretja.|$|E
5|$|After several {{first round}} defeats {{at the start}} to the European clay court season, Robson {{defeated}} world No. 4 Agnieszka Radwańska {{in the second round}} of the Mutua Madrid Open. She subsequently lost to former world No. 1 Ana Ivanovic in the next round, having led 5–2 in the <b>final</b> <b>set.</b> Robson then made her debut at the Italian Open where she defeated Venus Williams in the first round but subsequently lost to her sister, world No. 1 and eventual champion Serena Williams in the second round. At the French Open Robson was beaten in the first round by former world No. 1 Caroline Wozniacki in straight sets.|$|E
30|$|The {{initial and}} <b>final</b> <b>setting</b> {{times of the}} mixes {{decrease}} with either increase in lime and/or plaster of Paris content. In general, the initial and <b>final</b> <b>setting</b> times of the mixes are lesser {{than that of the}} value prescribed for ordinary Portland cement. An addition of borax retards the setting time and a borax content of 0.4  % by mass gives the setting time that is normally prescribed for OPC.|$|R
50|$|The grand <b>finals</b> <b>set</b> was {{a convincing}} 3-0 victory for Armada over Mango, winning his third GENESIS title in a row.|$|R

5|$|During {{the clay}} season, Federer's {{victory in the}} Hamburg Masters final was {{particularly}} impressive, as it snapped Rafael Nadal's 81-match winning streak on clay, an Open-Era record. Federer turned the match around from a set down to sweep 12 of the final 14 games, including a <b>final</b> <b>set</b> bagel. At the French Open, some anticipated that Federer could become the first man in almost 40 years to hold all four majors simultaneously, having just resoundingly defeated young rival Nadal on clay entering the tournament. However, in {{a repeat of the}} previous year Federer played a tough four-set final against Nadal, but was undone by going 1/17 on break-point chances.|$|E
5|$|In May at the 34th French Championships the men's doubles tournament {{took place}} first. With Lacoste – Borotra's victory over Tilden – Hunter and Cochet – Brugnon's easy win over Gregory – Collins {{in the semifinals}} secured the Four Musketeers their third doubles {{face-to-face}} final. Unfortunately for Cochet in the fifth set they were serving for the match and had thirty-love in the game, when Brugnon missed an easy ball when three match points were at stake. Lacoste and Borotra revived {{from that moment on}} and closed out the <b>final</b> <b>set</b> 8–6. In singles he was put out of the contest by Borotra in the semifinals and thus was unable to retain his title. However, Cochet did not leave without a trophy as the mixed championship was earned by him and Eileen Bennett Whittingstall.|$|E
5|$|Murray next competed at the Madrid Open and {{following}} his opening win, over Nicolas Almagro, he dedicated the victory to former player Elena Baltacha. He then lost to qualifier Santiago Giraldo {{in the following}} round. Murray then reached {{the quarterfinals of the}} Rome Masters where he lost to world No. 1 Rafael Nadal in a tight match in which he had been up a break in the <b>final</b> <b>set.</b> At the French Open, Murray defeated Andrey Golubev and Marinko Matosevic before edging out 28th seed Philipp Kohlschreiber 12–10 in the <b>final</b> <b>set.</b> This was the first time Murray had ever gone beyond 7–5 in a deciding set. He followed this up with a straight sets win over Fernando Verdasco and then recorded a five set victory over Frenchman Gaël Monfils in the quarterfinal, which saw Murray rise to world No. 5 and equal his best ever French Open by reaching the semifinals. However, he subsequently lost to Nadal in straight sets, winning only 6 games in the match. After losing the 2014 French Open semifinals to Nadal, Murray appointed former women's world No. 1, and two-times slam titlist, Amélie Mauresmo as his coach in a 'historic move' which made Mauresmo the first woman to coach a top male tennis player.|$|E

5|$|The {{class was}} heavily used by British Railways: 29 {{locomotives}} required replacement cylinders between 1955 and 1961 due to excessive wear. Frames were occasionally replaced due to stress caused by heavy use, and the steam circuit was revised when new cylinders were fitted: the inside steam pipes of Maunsell's original design {{were replaced by}} outside steam pipes emerging from the smokebox, behind the smoke deflectors. From 1957, some of the locomotives had larger-diameter BR Standard Class4 chimneys fitted to improve draughting with poor-quality coal, though the decline of steam on the Southern Region precluded use on the entire class. Crew reports maintained that the latter modifications cut fuel and water consumption. The <b>final</b> <b>set</b> of modifications constituted the fitting of new injectors and Automatic Warning System (AWS) equipment in 1957 and 1959 respectively.|$|E
5|$|The {{two sides}} {{met in the}} Premier League {{three days after the}} final, a match that Liverpool won 4–1. Liverpool {{finished}} the season in eighth place and Dalglish was subsequently sacked and replaced by Swansea City manager Brendan Rodgers. Chelsea would finish the season in sixth place; however, they won the 2011–12 UEFA Champions League, beating Bayern Munich 4–3 in a penalty shoot-out after the final finished 1–1 after extra time. Chelsea's victory in the FA Cup <b>final</b> <b>set</b> up a Community Shield match against Manchester City, the winners of the 2011–12 Premier League.|$|E
5|$|Top seed Rafael Nadal {{faced an}} uphill battle against Stanislas Wawrinka in the fourth round match, facing a tiebreak in each set and {{eventually}} defeating him. Second seed Roger Federer defeated Dent in the fourth round {{to set up a}} quarterfinal match with longtime rival Andy Roddick, who overcame Gaël Monfils in a two-set match. Novak Djokovic, Andy Murray, Juan Martín del Potro, Verdasco and Jo-Wilfried Tsonga made it into the quarterfinals. Del Potro defeated Nadal in the three-set quarterfinal match to reach the first ATP Masters semifinal of his career. Del Potro took the <b>final</b> <b>set</b> on a tiebreak after losing the second set. Murray faced Verdasco in the second quarterfinal in a rematch of 2009 Australian Open fourth round. Verdasco suffered an injury in the second game of the match and had to be seen by his physio. He was not in good enough shape to compete with Murray and eventually lost. Federer defeated Roddick while Djokovic moved past Tsonga to advance to the semifinals. Djokovic rallied back to defeat Federer in the first semifinal after losing the first set. The third seed however kept his consistency in the next two sets and won them. Murray edged past del Potro in the second semifinal to enter his second straight Masters final. Murray faltered in the second set of the match conceding two service breaks. However he recovered in the <b>final</b> <b>set,</b> gaining an early break of serve, to win the match.|$|E

5|$|Elephants {{usually have}} 26 teeth: the incisors, {{known as the}} tusks, 12 {{deciduous}} premolars, and 12 molars. Unlike most mammals, which grow baby teeth and then replace them with a single permanent set of adult teeth, elephants are polyphyodonts that have cycles of tooth rotation throughout their lives. The chewing teeth are replaced six times in a typical elephant's lifetime. Teeth are not replaced by new ones emerging from the jaws vertically as in most mammals. Instead, new teeth grow in {{at the back of}} the mouth and move forward to push out the old ones. The first chewing tooth on each side of the jaw falls out when the elephant is two to three years old. The second set of chewing teeth falls out when the elephant is four to six years old. The third set is lost at 9–15 years of age, and set four lasts until 18–28 years of age. The fifth set of teeth lasts until the elephant is in its early 40s. The sixth (and usually <b>final)</b> <b>set</b> must last the elephant the rest of its life. Elephant teeth have loop-shaped dental ridges, which are thicker and more diamond-shaped in African elephants.|$|E
5|$|Kuznetsova {{began the}} season by {{reaching}} the final at the Medibank International in Sydney, losing to world No. 1 Henin in the <b>final</b> <b>set.</b> At the Australian Open, Kuznetsova was seeded second, but {{fell in the}} third round to 29th seed Agnieszka Radwańska. After her defeat at the Qatar Open to 15th seeded Sybille Bammer, she fell after 15 weeks to No. 3 on 25 February. Kuznetsova made her second final of the season in Dubai, defeating former world No. 1 Mauresmo in the quarterfinals and world No. 4 Janković in the semifinals. In the final Kuznetsova lost to Elena Dementieva. At the Tier I Pacific Life Open in March, Kuznetsova defeated Radwańska in the quarterfinals before defeating Australian Open champion Sharapova in the semifinals. In the final, Kuznetsova lost to top-seeded Ivanović. This marked her eighth defeat in her nine most recent final appearances. At the Tier I Sony Ericsson Open the next fortnight, Kuznetsova defeated Venus Williams in the quarterfinals but then lost to her sister Serena in the semifinals.|$|E
