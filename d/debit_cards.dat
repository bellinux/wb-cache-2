40|$|This paper {{investigates the}} impact of {{newspaper}} publications about <b>debit</b> <b>card</b> skimming fraud on <b>debit</b> <b>card</b> usage in the Netherlands using daily information from January 1 st 2005 to December 31 st 2008. Time-series analyses are employed to assess the daily fluctuations in aggregate <b>debit</b> <b>card</b> usage. The results show that newspaper articles that somehow make mention of the phenomenon of skimming fraud significantly affect the number of <b>debit</b> <b>card</b> payments. The direction of the effect depends {{on the type of}} skimming fraud addressed. Newspaper articles on fraud at points-of-sale (POS) and ticket machines depress the number of <b>debit</b> <b>card</b> payments. News on ATM fraud, by contrast, has a positive effect on <b>debit</b> <b>card</b> payments. This indicates that the temporarily created fear for using the <b>debit</b> <b>card</b> at the ATM is not automatically translated into fear for using the <b>debit</b> <b>card</b> at the POS. Instead, ATMs and POS terminals are perceived as substitutes. Although significant, all media effects found are relatively small in comparison with other factors such as calendar and holiday effects and daily rainfall. Moreover, the effects only last for one day, with consumers immediately reverting back to their regular payment behaviour. This corresponds to earlier results found in other research fields and suggests that consumers 2 ̆ 019 confidence in the <b>debit</b> <b>card</b> is relatively sturdy and not easily affected.

Since the two motorways are operated by Autocesta Rijeka— Zagreb and Hrvatske autoceste, the toll collection system is operated jointly by the two operators. The toll is payable in Croatian kuna, euro, major credit and <b>debit</b> <b>cards</b> and using a number of prepaid toll collection systems including various types of smart cards issued by the motorway operators and ENC – an electronic toll collection (ETC) which is shared at all motorways in Croatia (except the A2 motorway) and provides drivers use of dedicated lanes at toll plazas and a discounted toll rates.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{provides}} {{an explanation for}} both the rapid growth {{in the use of}} a <b>debit</b> <b>card</b> over time and the cross-sectional difference in the use of a <b>debit</b> <b>card</b> using a search-theoretic model. The trade-off between cash and a <b>debit</b> <b>card</b> as means of payment is incorporated such that a buyer incurs disutility cost proportional to the amount of cash holdings, while a seller accepting a <b>debit</b> <b>card</b> bears a fixed record-keeping cost regardless of transaction amount. As record-keeping cost decreases with the development of information technology over time, disutility cost of cash holdings required for pairwise trade eventually exceeds record-keeping cost so that all the agents with different wealth levels choose to use a <b>debit</b> <b>card</b> as a means of payment. Also, disutility cost of cash holdings required for pairwise trade would be higher for the rich than for the poor, implying the cross-sectional feature of payment pattern that the rich use a <b>debit</b> <b>card</b> more frequently than the poor. There are two distinct mechanisms that improve welfare as record-keeping cost decreases: one is to reduce deadweight loss from holding cash and the other is to reduce its distortionary effect on output produced in pairwise trade.

Although A8 also employs a ticket system, usage of the road is free except for vehicles traversing the Učka Tunnel and the KanfanarRogovići section. A user of {{the entire length of the}} A8 is charged 36.00 kuna (€4.86) for passenger cars or up to 205.00 kuna (€27.70) for semi-trailers, depending on vehicle classification in Croatia. Ticket systems employed by the A9 and the A8 are unified; tolls are not charged when switching between the two roads. The toll is payable in either Croatian kuna or euros using major credit cards, <b>debit</b> <b>cards</b> and a number of prepaid toll collection systems.

The A2 is the only motorway in Croatia which does not provide for use of the ENC—an electronic toll collection (ETC) system shared by most motorways in Croatia that provides drivers with discounted toll rates for dedicated lanes at toll plazas. In addition to the vehicle classification in Croatia, the motorway operator maintains an additional vehicle category for motorbikes, which are charged from 7.00 kuna (0.91 euros) to 25.00 kuna (3.26 euros) toll. The southernmost Jankomir–Zaprešić section of the motorway is not tolled, as {{it is part of the}} Zagreb bypass.|$|E
