DTC's parent, Depository Trust & Clearing Corporation (DTCC), is a non-profit cooperative owned by approximately thirty of the largest Wall Street players that typically act as brokers or dealers in securities. These thirty banks are called the DTC participants. DTC, through a legal nominee, owns each of the global securities {{on behalf of all}} the DTC participants.|$|E

50|$|CyberTrust {{was founded}} as a {{subsidiary}} of GTE Corporation's Government Systems Information Security Directorate. It focused on security services for electronic commerce. These included authentication, privacy, integrity and non-repudiation using Public Key Encryption technology. In 2000, GTE sold CyberTrust to Ireland-based security company Baltimore Technologies for $150 million. In 2003, Baltimore Technologies divested its operating companies, including all digital certificate operations to BeTrusted Holdings, Inc. A year later in September 2004, BeTrusted announced its intention to merge with former competitor TruSecure Corporation and in November the resulting company was incorporated in Virginia as CyberTrust. Verizon Business then acquired Cybertrust in 2007, reuniting it with its former parent (Verizon {{was created by the}} merger of GTE and Bell Atlantic). Financial terms were not disclosed.

5000|$|Book {{entry is}} a system of {{tracking}} ownership of securities where no certificate is given to investors.

40|$|Abstract — Unmanned aerial {{vehicles}} (UAVs) have a so-far untapped {{potential to}} operate at high speeds through cluttered environments. Many of these systems are limited by their ad-hoc reactive controllers using simple visual cues like optical flow. Here we consider the problem of formally verifying an output-feedback controller for an aircraft operating in an unknown environment. Using recent advances in sums-of-squares programming that allow for efficient computation of barrier functions, we search for <b>global</b> <b>certificates</b> of safety for the closed-loop system in a given environment. In con-trast to previous work, we use rational functions to globally approximate non-smooth dynamics and use multiple barrier functions to guard against more than one obstacle. We expect that these formal verification techniques will allow for the comparison, and ultimately optimization, of reactive controllers for robustness to varying initial conditions and environments.

40|$|After {{thirty years}} of {{impressive}} economic growth, Vietnam is currently threatened by the middle-income trap since the country struggles with skill mismatches on regional labor markets and with a private domestic sector with little linkages to export-orientated MNEs, due to its low productivity levels. Therefore, some MNEs have started to step in these institutional voids through CSR practices with the goal to shift their host regions on a more sustainable economic develop-ment path. On the one hand, they enforce the diffusion of <b>global</b> CSR <b>certificates,</b> which consist of international labor and environmental standards, in host regions’ local economy. This is supposed to help local firms to become future suppliers in global value chains. On the other hand, they carry out local CSR projects at partnering universities and vocational training institutes {{in order to improve}} their host regions’ human capital base. However, it remains unclear whether MNEs’ CSR practices are a suitable means to unlock regions from institutional path-dependence. Following recent attempts in economic geography, this dissertations considers a more actor-centered perspective on institutional change. Its goal is to discuss to what extent and under which circumstances MNEs become institutional entrepreneurs through their CSR practices in Vietnamese regions, thereby fostering regional industrial upgrading (RIU) potentials. More precisely, this dissertation presents with the CSR─RIU model a new theoretical framework which explains how <b>global</b> CSR <b>certificates</b> can diffuse into the local economy and how local CSR projects in the education sector may help MNEs’ host regions to overcome skill mismatch problems on regional labor market. Based on statistical data from Vietnam’s Technological and Competitiveness Survey 2014 and own-conducted qualitative in-depth interviews with representatives from the business sector and education sector, this dissertation makes the following empirical contribu-tions. First, <b>global</b> CSR <b>certificates</b> do not {{have a positive impact on}} short-term productivity growth among local firms. Hence, it is unlikely that the diffusion of <b>global</b> CSR <b>certificates</b> into the local economy will yield in rising linkages between local firms and MNEs. Furthermore, regional institutions such as CSR support system rather than MNEs belong to the key drivers for the diffusion of <b>global</b> CSR <b>certificates</b> in Vietnam’s private domestic sector. Second, MNEs can indeed establish parts of their home countries’ TVET systems through local CSR projects at partnering PEOs in their host regions albeit some adaptions to the local context are inevitable. The case studies also reveal that those public educational organizations are integrated into institution-building initiatives which possess a high spatial, institutional, cognitive and social proximity towards the respective MNEs. Third, collaborative training models between the business sector and public educational organizations introduced by MNEs have not become institutionalized in the local economy. This can be explained by two facts. First, local firms have not been included in such initiatives. Second, they show a deviating territorial, network and societal embed-dedness compared to MNEs. To sum up, although numerous MNEs and their partners have undertaken substantial efforts in Vietnam to shift host regions towards a more sustainable development path, their institution-building attempts have so far fizzled out. Based on these results, the following conclusion can be drawn. MNEs, development agencies and regional authorities might be more successful in triggering a regional institu-tional change in Vietnam if they include local firms in their alliances from the very beginning and equally consider MNEs’ and local firms’ needs and ideas in these reforms attempts...|$|R

50|$|Marketing {{of higher}} {{education}} is a well-entrenched macro process today, especially in the major English-speaking nations i.e. Australia, Canada, New Zealand, the UK, and the USA. One of the major factors behind the worldwide evolution of educational marketing could {{be a result of}} globalization, which has dramatically shriveled the world. Due to intensifying competition for overseas students amongst MESDCs, i.e. major English-speaking destination countries, higher educational institutions recognize the significance of marketing themselves, in the international arena. To build sustainable international student recruitment strategies Higher Education Institutions (HEIs) need to diversify the markets from which they recruit, both to take advantage of future growth potential from emerging markets, and to reduce dependency on - and exposure to risk from - major markets such as China, India and Nigeria, where demand has proven to be volatile. For recruitment strategies, there are some approaches that higher education institutions adopt to ensure stable enrollments of international students, such as developing university preparation programs, like the <b>Global</b> Assessment <b>Certificate</b> (GAC) Program, and launching international branch campuses in foreign countries.|$|R
