6000|$|... 'And <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>what</b> <b>you</b> {{brought me}} down for, Mrs. Davis?' said Norah. 'Well, upon my word, I hope the door's locked; {{we shall have}} all the world in here else.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "'One of the {{characteristics}} of this form of delirium <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>what</b> <b>you</b> see <b>is</b> even clearer than reality. I was wondering whether the whole run was not a delusion also.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "And did {{you have}} all that in your mind, papa, when you came down here, and <b>was</b> <b>that</b> <b>what</b> <b>you</b> and Mr. Dawson wanted to talk about?" [...] said the {{astonished}} Rose.|$|R
6000|$|... "A clam for supper? a cold clam; <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>what</b> <b>you</b> mean, Mrs. Hussey?" [...] says I, [...] "but that's {{a rather}} cold and clammy {{reception}} {{in the winter}} time, ain't it, Mrs. Hussey?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "And <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>what</b> <b>you</b> mean? Come, dearest, tell me {{the whole}} of it. <b>What</b> have <b>you</b> said to him yourself? What has he been led to think from the answer you have given him to-day?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "If I marry an {{interesting}} woman I shall <b>be</b> interested: <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>what</b> <b>you</b> say?" [...] Lord Warburton asked. [...] "I'm {{not at all}} keen about marrying--your son misrepresented me; but there's no knowing what {{an interesting}} woman might do with me." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Young man," [...] he said, [...] "that sum {{has been}} {{collected}} for your funds by {{the friends of}} your country abroad. Take it {{and use it as}} you think best. All that I ask from <b>you</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>what</b> <b>you</b> do, you do quickly. Let me suggest an occasion for you. The Archduke of Austria will be in your capital almost {{as soon as you can}} reach home." ...|$|R
6000|$|... '"All that I {{have to say}} to <b>you</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>what</b> <b>you</b> did {{down there}} has never been seen in any other war. Never in any country in the world has such a dastardly act been {{committed}} as the shooting of one who goes to meet the white flag." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Under the streets, in the sewers, in the wires, in the telephones, {{there is}} {{something}} alive; <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>what</b> <b>you</b> mean? In things like dust-carts, and men mending roads? You feel {{that all the time}} when you walk about London, and when you turn on a tap and the water comes?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Well," [...] said Grace, [...] "I {{thought we}} might take turns to go to Miss Manners's missionary working parties. I never gave in to them before, but I shall not be {{comfortable}} now unless I do something. And <b>was</b> <b>that</b> <b>what</b> <b>you</b> meant about the velvet trimming, Jessie? It will save--" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh, <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>what</b> <b>you</b> wanted? But why didn't {{you say so}} before? You {{would have}} spared me the trouble of {{knocking}} you down. I thought gentlemen of your profession invariably conducted these affairs with decency, decorum, and a certain grace. Had you done so, you might have saved your breeches." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Murder! Good God, Dorian, <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>what</b> <b>you</b> {{have come}} to? I shall not inform upon you. It {{is not my}} business. Besides, without my {{stirring}} in the matter, you are certain to be arrested. Nobody ever commits a crime without doing something stupid. But I will {{have nothing to do}} with it." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "And <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>what</b> <b>you</b> {{called me}} downstairs for?" [...] cried the {{proprietor}} of the restaurant, in a rage. [...] "Make me throw down a good hand at cards {{just to look at}} a lot of tin knives and forks! You peddlers are getting more bold every day. The police ought to sit down on every one of you!" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "'This is very {{extraordinary}} conduct, Mr. Latimer,' I stammered. 'You must <b>be</b> aware <b>that</b> <b>what</b> <b>you</b> <b>are</b> {{doing is}} quite illegal.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... ‘Yes, I <b>am</b> certain <b>that</b> <b>is</b> <b>what</b> <b>you</b> {{would have}} done. But oh, mother, <b>that</b> <b>is</b> just how Jess would have acted if some poorer woman {{than she had}} shown her a new shawl.’ ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes--I am sure <b>you</b> do. It <b>is</b> <b>that,</b> <b>what</b> <b>you</b> <b>are,</b> convinces me you do. Even the {{remarkable}} and sensible explanation you gave {{of it when}} you interpreted {{the parable of the}} talents is not so powerful as the impression that you yourself believe after thinking it out for yourself--not accepting the old explanations. And then," [...] she added, with a note as of surprise, [...] "you are willing to sacrifice everything for it!" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "That," [...] said Desmond dryly, [...] "is a fact I'm {{naturally}} quite aware of. I like a frolic now {{and then}} {{as well as most}} other men, but I've sense enough not to indulge in it when I'm out on business. The trouble <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>what</b> <b>you</b> have done you will very probably do again, and that wouldn't suit either me or Ormsgill. I'm afraid you'll have to take the boat north to-morrow." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'You {{ought to}} <b>be</b> killed, <b>that's</b> <b>what</b> <b>you</b> ought,' said Annie, tensely. 'You {{ought to be}} killed.' And there was a terrifying lust in her voice.|$|R
6000|$|... "Don't go, Quaritch, don't go," [...] {{said the}} Squire. [...] "I shall be glad of your advice, and I <b>am</b> sure <b>that</b> <b>what</b> <b>you</b> hear {{will not go}} any further." ...|$|R
5000|$|In A Moveable Feast, {{published}} after Hemingway's and Stein's deaths, Hemingway {{claims that}} Stein heard the phrase from a garage owner who serviced Stein's car. When a young mechanic failed {{to repair the}} car quickly enough, the garage owner shouted at the boy, [...] "You are all a [...] "génération perdue." [...] Stein, in telling Hemingway the story, added, [...] "That <b>is</b> <b>what</b> <b>you</b> <b>are.</b> <b>That's</b> <b>what</b> <b>you</b> all <b>are</b> ... all of you young people {{who served in the}} war. You are a lost generation." ...|$|R
60|$|A YOUNG MAN. Some dream {{when they}} are awake, {{but they are the}} crazy, and who would believe what they say? Forgive me, master, but <b>that</b> <b>is</b> <b>what</b> <b>you</b> taught me to say. <b>That</b> <b>is</b> <b>what</b> <b>you</b> said to the monk when he spoke of the visions of the saints and the martyrs.|$|R
60|$|FATHER DEMPSEY [with gentle emphasis]. I have a KNOWLEDGE of {{what the}} Roun Towers <b>were,</b> if <b>that's</b> <b>what</b> <b>you</b> mean. They <b>are</b> the forefingers of the early Church, {{pointing}} us all to God.|$|R
60|$|MRS MARCH. Human nature <b>is</b> stubborn, Geof. <b>That's</b> <b>what</b> <b>you</b> easy--going {{people never}} see.|$|R
6000|$|... 'Ignorant! Of course <b>you</b> <b>are</b> ignorant. <b>That</b> <b>is</b> <b>what</b> <b>you</b> {{ought to}} be. Isn't it {{what we have}} all been devoting {{ourselves}} to effect ever since you were born? Read your third chapter of Genesis and remember what came of eating of {{the fruit of the}} Tree of Knowledge.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "But <b>is</b> not <b>that</b> <b>what</b> <b>you</b> {{have done}} during the last week, Miss Ray;--if it must be Miss Ray?" [...] Then he paused, but still she said nothing. [...] "Rachel is such a pretty name." ...|$|R
2500|$|... "A common {{assumption}} <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>what</b> <b>you</b> do {{to induce}} {{a sense of}} flow is purely a personal issue, and ultimately <b>what</b> <b>you</b> do doesn’t really matter. What matters is the fact of psychological flow. You’re most likely to experience flow wherever you have the skill, and you're most likely to develop skill wherever you have the aptitude, whether it’s in music, sport, hunting, meditating, etc. From the Buddha’s point of view, however, it really does matter <b>what</b> <b>you</b> do to gain gratification, for some skills are more conducive to stable, long-term happiness than others, due to their long-term consequences" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "'Wilful murder?' says he in his quiet way. 'What the deuce <b>is</b> <b>that?</b> <b>What</b> <b>are</b> <b>you</b> talking about? People do {{get killed}} {{sometimes}} {{when they get}} in one's way, but that's self-defence--you understand?' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "If I do it again, {{you will}} inform him: <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>what</b> <b>you</b> mean? I {{do not share}} your dread of my brother; I have always known how to defend my own position. But I shall {{certainly}} never again take any step on your behalf; you are much too thankless. I knew you were not a spontaneous nature, but I believed you were firm, and I told your father that he would find you so. I am disappointed--but your father will not be!" [...] And with this, Mrs. Penniman offered her niece a brief good-night, and withdrew to her own apartment.|$|R
60|$|BURGE. We stand, as Cromwell did, for {{liberty of}} conscience, if <b>that</b> <b>is</b> <b>what</b> <b>you</b> mean.|$|R
60|$|He is {{a self-made}} man, if <b>that</b> <b>is</b> <b>what</b> <b>you</b> mean, and he {{certainly}} hasn't any money.|$|R
60|$|Lady Bracknell. [Rising {{and drawing}} herself up.] You must <b>be</b> quite aware <b>that</b> <b>what</b> <b>you</b> propose <b>is</b> {{out of the}} question.|$|R
5000|$|... "Because she’s a young, vital, {{beautiful}} woman, Jan. Why {{should she}} <b>be</b> alone? Is <b>that</b> <b>what</b> <b>you</b> {{would do if}} something happened to Paul?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh, <b>you</b> <b>are</b> simply horrid, <b>that's</b> <b>what</b> <b>you</b> are!" [...] {{declared}} the stylishly-dressed student, in despair. [...] "And my books are all covered with dirt!" ...|$|R
