40|$|Purpose – The {{purpose of}} this study is to examine the effect of the audit {{committee}} (AC) independence, financial expertise, <b>internal</b> <b>audit</b> <b>function,</b> <b>audit</b> quality and ownership concentration on earnings quality (EQ) and, consequently, ascertain whether the AC’s independence and financial expertise has a moderating effect on the relationship between <b>internal</b> <b>audit</b> <b>function</b> and EQ. Design/methodology/approach – The study sample is 508 firms listed on the Main Market of Bursa Malaysia (formerly known as Kuala Lumpur Stock Exchange) for the years 2009 to 2012. EQ was measured using two modified Jones models of discretionary accruals. Findings – The findings reveal that the independence of AC and investment in <b>internal</b> <b>audit</b> <b>function,</b> as well as the Big 4 audit firm, are related to greater EQ. Ownership concentration is found to be associated with lower EQ. The study provides evidence that AC’s independence moderates the relationship between <b>internal</b> <b>audit</b> <b>function</b> (investment in and sourcing arrangements of <b>internal</b> <b>audit</b> <b>function)</b> and EQ. It also shows that AC’s financial expertise moderates the relationship between sourcing arrangements of <b>internal</b> <b>audit</b> <b>function</b> and EQ. Practical implications – This study extends the prior related literature by examining the AC’s independence and financial expertise as moderating variables on the relationship between <b>internal</b> <b>audit</b> <b>function</b> and EQ. Social implications – Policymakers might use the findings regarding EQ in relation to governance practices, to recognize the important roles played by the AC’s independence and financial expertise on the effectiveness of <b>internal</b> <b>audit</b> <b>function</b> with EQ.

40|$|This study {{examines}} {{the relationships between}} internal auditors and auditees {{in an attempt to}} identify the factors that influence the abilities of internal auditors (IAs) to build high-quality relationships with auditees. The analysis is based on the responses of 78 Italian Chief Audit Executives who took part in a survey in 2014. The results indicate two factors that are positively and significantly associated with high-quality IA–auditee relationships: (1) the integration of senior management's inputs in the setting up of audit plans; and (2) the use of the <b>internal</b> <b>auditing</b> <b>function</b> (IAF) as a management training ground. The results also show a positive but marginally significant relationship between the regular revision of audit methodologies and high-quality IA–auditee relationships.

The study specifically focused on management and staff commitment to the <b>internal</b> <b>audit</b> <b>function,</b> independence and objectivity, competence of internal auditors and the adoption and use of professional standards. Although there has been a strong acceptance and recognition of the <b>internal</b> <b>audit</b> <b>function</b> in professional practice, much of academic researchersâ€™ attention has been drawn on external audit research. In this view, the {{study sought to}} establish factors that affect the performance of <b>audit</b> <b>function</b> focusing on <b>internal</b> <b>audit.</b> The research employed quantitative research methodology. Primary data was collected through a self-administered questionnaire. The questions covered management and staff commitment to the <b>internal</b> <b>audit</b> <b>function,</b> independence and objectivity, competence of <b>internal</b> <b>audit</b> <b>function</b> and adoption and adherence to professional standards. Research objectives were realised as the study managed to show factors that affect <b>internal</b> <b>audit</b> <b>function</b> in its endeavor to discharge its value adding role. The research concluded that NSSA <b>internal</b> <b>audit</b> <b>function</b> receives support from both management and staff in the execution of its duties and responsibilities.

The outcome {{of the study is}} to stick out the importance and value of internal auditing and internal control besides to present a methodology for risk assessment in an internal audit environment in order to distribute their resources in an optimal manner. The aim of this research is to provide a methodology for internal audit risk assessment, trying to establish all factors needed when the risk is assessed. In pursuing this objective it is necessary to develop a theoretical basis for supporting the analysis and as consequence, other collateral aims exist in the study which are: a) underline the importance and need of the <b>internal</b> <b>auditing</b> <b>function</b> and, b) provide an adequate framework for internal control system analysis. Therefore the first part is devoted to the <b>internal</b> <b>auditing</b> <b>function</b> underlying its definition, importance, objectives and new vision. The internal control issue is closely related with internal audit and {{the second part of the}} study is dedicated to establish concept, structure and components from different points of view. Here, is provided a frameworks comparison in order to clarify when, which, and what approach to use when evaluating risks. Tje third part of the study is the core of the work, and is devoted to the risk asessment process, establishing the theoretical basis necessary for the approach to the risk problem. A complete and detailed description of the proposed methodology for internal audit risk assessment is provided and also is indicated the feasibility of using comoputer advantages. Examples of application are provided in the next part and in the annexes. Finally it is important to emphasize that the proposed risk assessment methodology is aimed to be used as an aid for auditing planning work and must not be taken as a substitute of the internal auditor. The outcome of the risk assessment process can not be accepted blindly, it is necessary to evaluate the ranking order to assure that the result coincide with intuitive and professional judgment. If this type of critical review is not undertaken, there is danger that the process desribed could give impractical results.

40|$|In recent years, the {{importance}} of good corporate governance has received significant public and regulatory attention. A crucial part of an entity's corporate governance is its <b>internal</b> <b>audit</b> <b>function.</b> At the same time, there has been significant public concern {{about the level of}} fraud within organizations. The {{purpose of this study is}} to assess whether organizations with an <b>internal</b> <b>audit</b> <b>function</b> are more likely to detect and self-report fraud than those without. In this study, we use a unique self-reported measure of misappropriation of assets fraud for the first time. The fraud data are from the 2004 KPMG Fraud Survey, which reported fraud from 491 organizations in the private and public sector across Australia and New Zealand. The <b>internal</b> <b>audit</b> data are from a separate mail survey sent to the respondents of the KPMG Fraud Survey. We find that organizations with an <b>internal</b> <b>audit</b> <b>function</b> are more likely than those without such a function to detect and self-report fraud. Furthermore, organizations that rely solely on outsourcing for their <b>internal</b> <b>audit</b> <b>function</b> are less likely to detect and self-report fraud than those that undertake at least part of their <b>internal</b> <b>audit</b> <b>function</b> themselves. These findings suggest that <b>internal</b> <b>audit</b> adds value through improving the control and monitoring environment within organizations to detect and self-report fraud.

40|$|One of {{the most}} {{important}} issues relating to corporate governance reports (e. g. the “Relazione sulla Corporate Governance” for Italian listed firms) refers to their ability to provide both professional and non-professional users with a complete set of information regarding the quality of an entity’s corporate governance practices. In fact, these reports generally provide disclosures about the compliance of an entity’s corporate governance system through the information set required by a specific law or industry code. These information are generally regarded as providing an indication of the quality of a given corporate governance system (CG quality).

40|$|In {{the context}} of {{internal}} auditing, {{when there is no}} obvious correlation between auditors' activities and financial performance, it is critical to identify areas where value is added as well as the drivers that enable this, in the evaluation of the effectiveness of the <b>internal</b> <b>auditing</b> <b>function</b> (IAF). This paper addresses whether and how internal auditing activities (IAAs) can add value to their organisations. In order to gain some understanding of value-adding processes, we analysed the responses of more than 1, 800 internal auditors to questions specifically designed to evaluate this contribution. This sample was based on the 2010 global survey of the internal auditing profession that the Institute of Internal Auditors Research Foundation (IIARF) carried out; only those respondents were included whose role showed they were {{in a position to make}} decisions and influence the work of their IAF. This study found evidence that four variables are positively associated with adding value: IAF independence and objectivity; compliance with the Institute of Internal Auditors' (IIA) Code of Ethics; the IAF's contribution to the evaluation of the effectiveness of internal control; and the IAF's contribution to the evaluation of the effectiveness of risk management. With the exception of independence and objectivity, the analysis reveals that the remaining value drivers of the IAF's activities vary between developed and emerging countries and between financial and non-financial companies, suggesting that the factors influencing the IAAs' effectiveness might be partially context dependent...|$|E
40|$|Purpose – This paper aims to {{investigate}} management auditing, a thorough examination {{of an organization}} and the management in place, through an empirical research to gather data about how management audits are perceived and implemented among Geneva’s (Switzerland) business community. The board of directors {{is in charge of}} a corporation’s overall supervision. The <b>internal</b> <b>auditing</b> <b>function</b> works {{under the aegis of the}} board to ensure that the directors will properly execute their responsibilities as defined by corporate governance rules. Management auditing could thus be used to improve corporation performance. However, management audits are not commonly used or referred to as a tool to address corporate governance. Findings enable the authors to both explain why management audits are not commonly used or referred to as a tool to address corporate governance and generate related research hypotheses. Design/methodology/approach – In this paper, the authors rely on an ethnographic study aimed at exploring perceptions of management audits in service companies from the Geneva region. This study is based on transcripts from 85 semi-directed interviews, conducted over a three-year period, of professionals with managerial and auditing backgrounds. The economic context during these three years was consistently characterized by the Swiss and international financial crises, ensuring that the findings remain comparable over this time period. Findings – This paper identified three main factors that influence the integration of management audits into corporate practices: the degree of acceptance of the tools and requirements of management audits, the national culture and values embodied in the practice and the degree of corporate governance maturity. This paper presents the findings in the form of hypotheses that can be tested on any adoption of good corporate governance practices – not on management audits alone. Research limitations/implications – Notwithstanding the limitations due to its nature and extent, this study’s main limitation is its lack of validation of the hypotheses. In further research, the authors intend to use a quantitative survey to validate the research hypotheses and make statistical inferences. Originality/value – This paper contributes to the literature because it is, to the authors’ knowledge, the first study to empirically examine the significant link between management audits and corporate governance. The findings could be interesting for an international audience because they indicate possible action points that boards of directors can leverage to carry out management audits. The findings also bridge a gap between the literature on management audits and the expanding role of the internal audit function. This study also examines the way companies – in the Swiss context – understand, perceive and may be ready to apply management audits as a good corporate governance practice...|$|E
40|$|The {{selection}} of an inappropriate regime by policy makers can thwart the effective implementation {{of public policy}} and lead to implementation failure. Competing values in the implementation process {{have a significant impact}} on the results of implementation, and the regime selected for implementation implies the choice of one value over another. Stoker has argued that on the one hand central leadership is valued for consistency, benefits of scale, co-ordination and cost sharing (instrumental model); and on the other, diffuse authority is valued as knowledge is particular and situational, and the task of analysis is to understand the problems, perspectives and interactions of implementation participants at the contact point between public programs and their clients (accommodation model). This study examines the implementation regime chosen by the Victorian Government for the introduction of a modern <b>internal</b> <b>auditing</b> <b>function</b> into the Victorian Public Service, using the Bureau of Internal Audit within its Department of Management and Budget. The {{selection of}} the Department of Management and Budget for the introduction of Internal Audit as a managerial accountability mechanism indicates that the instrumental model was held by the Victorian Government to be the most important in implementation. It is argued that use of a top-down central agency leadership approach resulted in implementation failure. Three propositions suggesting the mechanisms by which this result is brought about are examined: that lack of co-ordinated planning at the outset will result in inadequate definition of client needs as part of policy formulation; that intraorganisational conflict during the implementation success, as individual participants are likely to exercise their veto; and the increasing the number of participants contributes to complexity, so that they should only be involved in implementation when their presence is absolutely required. It is argued that the essential task of implementation is to create an environment where participants are likely to co-operate to achieve predetermined public policy goals; and that the introduction of a modern internal auditing approach into the Victorian Public Service required a more participatory implementation regime in order to facilitate policy outcomes and prevent implementation failure. It is also argued that the dominance of economic reform over accountability in Victoria restricted the ability of the Bureau of Internal Audit to implement change to internal audit practices within Victorian Government departments. The selection of an instrumental model of implementation by the Department of Management and Budget is examined in the context of the environment that existed in Victoria between 1982 - 1987; and while some of the values which Stoker associates with the top-down approach to policy making were observed, an alternative view to the development of internal auditing in the Victorian Public Service can be sustained...|$|E

These relate to the relative novelty of performance auditing and combined assurance in state-owned enterprises, the differences in methodologies and auditing systems used by outsourced <b>functions,</b> repeat (negative) <b>audit</b> findings, a lack of business knowledge and insight on the part of the entity, and non-compliance with quality assurance and improvement Standards.

The role of information technology in the organization continues to evolve and this has an impact for the <b>internal</b> <b>audit</b> <b>functions</b> that serve these organizations. The study investigated whether the King III report, ISACA standards and IIA standards assist the <b>internal</b> <b>audit</b> <b>function</b> in addressing the impact of information technology on the organization and, as a result, the <b>internal</b> <b>audit</b> <b>function</b> itself. This was performed {{by way of a}} comprehensive literature study on the <b>internal</b> <b>audit</b> <b>function</b> and the selected standards and corporate governance framework, the role of information technology in both the organization and the <b>internal</b> <b>audit</b> <b>function,</b> as well as an empirical study detailing a comparative analysis of the King III report, ISACA standards and IIA standards, utilizing key success factors. The study identified an alignment of the key principles and elements identified in the King III report, ISACA standards and IIA standards. There was direct support for ITrelated reviews in the King III report, ISACA Standards and IIA Standards. The comparative analysis performed between the King III report and IIA standards, as well as the ISACA standards and the IIA standards resulted in the formulation of key <b>internal</b> <b>audit</b> success factors.

40|$|Eumedion is a Dutch {{foundation}} {{representing the}} interests of Dutch and foreign institutional investors with investments in Dutch listed companies. In particular, it represents {{the interests of}} these participants {{in the field of}} corporate governance and sustainability. The foundation was established in 2006 with the objective to maintain and develop good corporate governance and sustainability performance by listed companies and institutional investors in the Netherlands and Europe. In this report, we address the following research question: To what extent has Eumedion contributed to the development and improvement of corporate governance and sustainability in the Netherlands during the 2006 - 2015 period? We analyze Eumedion’s contribution by using a theoretical framework that describes the process of developing norms of corporate governance and sustainability. These norms describe how (good) corporate governance and sustainability should look like. The process of developing norms can be broken down in three stages, i. e. norm setting, norm spreading and norm implementation. Our analysis describes how Eumedion is actively involved in all three stages. The analysis in this report is based on a large data base consisting of documents that are publicly available from Eumedion’s website as well as documents we obtained from Eumedion’s secretariat and consists of Eumedion’s Corporate Governance Manual, policy plans (beleidsplannen), annual reports, position papers, comment letters, consultation documents, focus letters, company dialogues, company alerts, and annual evaluations of annual general meetings of shareholders (AMGs). Moreover, we collected information about the media attention for Eumedion. The data covers the period 2005 - 2016. Finally, we held interviews with fourteen important actors in the Dutch and international corporate governance field who shared their experiences with and ideas and perceptions about the activities of Eumedion. Our analysis reveals the following results. In the norm setting stage, norms regarding corporate governance and sustainability are established. Eumedion has been actively involved in this process, first of all by writing consultation reactions and sending comment letters to Dutch and European institutions directly involved in setting norms. In particular, it is frequently communicating with the Dutch Ministry of Finance, the European Union Institutions and (committees of) the Dutch House of Representatives, because they are most important in setting corporate governance and sustainability norms. The analysis also shows that Eumedion is discussing a wide range of corporate governance and sustainability topics in its interactions with these institutions. Yet, over time the emphasis of topics discussed shifted from more traditional corporate governance topics (such as shareholder rights and remuneration) to financial and non-financial reporting {{and the role of the}} <b>internal</b> <b>auditing</b> <b>function</b> and external auditor. During the 2008 - 2012 it was particularly active on issues related to the financial markets and banking industry as a consequence of the global financial crisis. Finally, our analysis reveals that Eumedion has joined committees and boards of organizations that are important in establishing corporate governance and sustainaibilty norms, both in, as well as outside, the Netherlands. Next to the consultation reactions and comment letter, Eumedion produces position papers (since 2008), which are aimed at boosting discussions about norm setting and/or changes. Eumedion has been very active in writing these papers, especially during the years 2014 - 2016, signaling its active role in debates as a thought leader. The majority of these papers deal with topics related to the powers of shareholders and disclosures. Eumedion is also active in several Dutch and international committees in which norm setting regarding corporate governance and sustainability is discussed and developed. Eumedion’s network of organizations in which it participates has widened considerably over the years. During the second stage, norms are spread, or diffused, to the parties in the field who are supposed to act according to these norms. In order to make sure they act upon the norms, they should be made aware of them. Most importantly, Eumedion is active at this stage of the norm development process by annually issuing so-called focus letters, which are sent to Dutch listed companies and in which it communicates the most important topics for institutional investors for the next reporting and AGM season. Our review of these letters shows that they discuss a wide range of topics with an emphasis on the procedures regarding the organization of AGMs, content and accountability of remuneration policies, corporate risk analysis, risk management and control and reporting issues. The overview also shows that over the years the focus of the focus letters has shifted towards addressing risk and reporting issues. Evaluating the effectiveness of the focus letters suggests that they have had a significant impact on corporate governance behavior of Dutch listed companies and other related actors. The fact that Eumedion puts and keeps issues on the agenda of discussions about corporate governance between management and shareholders stimulates companies to address these issues. During its early years (2006 - 2009) Eumedion was mostly involved in norm setting and norm spreading. Since 2009, it became more and more involved in the third stage of the norm development process. During this stage, it is evaluated whether and to what extent norms are being implemented by companies. Eumedion again is actively involved in this stage. First of all, it has annual dialogues with a selection of Dutch listed companies, during which it communicates its observations and discusses its opinion on how norms should be applied by a specific company. Moreover, in case of controversial proposals made by company management at the AGM it may start the so-called alert procedure, which may lead to sending out an official alert to the company and Eumedion’s participants. In this alert, it describes why it would like to see the proposal to be withdrawn or changed. Our evaluation of the use of company dialogues and alert service suggests that they played an important role in making norm implementation by participants a coordinated activity, i. e. it helped professionalizing the norm implementation process. They also helped Eumedion becoming increasingly influential in determining the debates over governance and sustainability both within the board room as well as during AGMs. Combining the empirical evaluation of the documents with the content of the expert interviews reveals the following picture. First, although Eumedion is a small organization, it has been able to make a significant and positive contribution to all three stages of the norm development process in the Netherlands during the past ten years. It is taken into account as a serious partner in discussions during policy developments by important decision makers, management and supervisory board of companies and other relevant parties, both domestically as well as internationally. Moreover, Eumedion is seen as a serious knowledge centre and an active and respected organization representing shareholder interests. Second, Eumedion has been actively involved in discussing a broad spectrum of corporate goverance and sustainability issues, i. e. from traditional corporate governance topics, such as shareholder rights and remuneration to corporate social responsibility and tax avoidance. Third, Eumedion has helped creating an environment in which there is a permanent dialogue between company management and investors during, but certainly also outside, the AGM. It has been successful in getting and keeping important governance issues on the agenda, in establishing closer and more informative relationships between management and shareholders, and in helping to make sure that shareholders are taken more seriously. It has also stimulated institutional investors to take their role as engaged shareholders more seriously. Fourth, with respect to the implementation of norms, Eumedion may have been less effective in some cases in changing company behavior because it is a relatively small player. For some of the companies with which it has a dialogue and/or sends out an alert, Eumedion represents only a small part of outstanding shares. Moreover, companies focus more on internationally operating proxy advisors such as ISS and Glass Lewis, because foreign institutional investors mostly look at the advice given by these proxy advisors, instead of looking at the alerts issued by Eumedion. Fifth, Eumedion has a limited mandate to speak on behalf of its participants in its communication with companies. The issue of the mandate of the representative of institutional investors in the Netherlands has been on the table ever since its predecessor, the SCGOP was established; Eumedion as its successor “inherited” this discussion. It may signal controversial governance issues, yet its participants ultimately decide for themselves how they deal with these issues. Obviously, this reduces Eumedion’s direct power in influencing company behavior. Sitxh, Eumedion focuses on corporate governance and sustainability. Since in many cases corporate governance and sustainability issues are not really integrated in portfolio management and analysis of both investors and companies, the effectiveness of Eumedion in representing interests of its participants with respect to these issues is reduced. Looking at the future, we suggest Eumedion to elaborate on the following three issues. First, given its experience and knowledge in the field of corporate governance and sustainability, it can play an important role in facilitating the discussion on how to integrate CSR decisions in portfolio management decisions, both within companies and institutional investors, as well as between companies and their investors. In communications they have with both these parties, it could more forcefully stress the fact that firm value and CSR are complements rather than substitutes, at least in the long-term. Second, Eumedion could focus on stimulating, and perhaps even leading, the current debate on engaged share-ownership, both within and outside the Netherlands. Recently, Eumedion has voiced its concerns about the lack of an engaged and stable shareholder base in Dutch listed companies and the potential consequences of this for the long-term sustainability of these companies and its owners. It has also raised its voice in criticizing the use of loyalty shares as a way to create a stable shareholder base. This signals Eumedion has a clear stance in the debate on how to deal with developing an engaged and stable shareholder base. It could therefore become one of the thought leaders on this issue in the coming years. Third, the fact that it has a limited mandate to act on behalf of its participants is a weakness of the model of interest representation used in the case of Eumedion. Strengthening its position as a representative of its participants vis-à-vis company management would leverage the effectiveness of the association in the process of norm implementation. This would also mean that Eumedion is allowed and is able to take a more activist position in case of controversial proposals and/or decisions made by company management. Participants of Eumedion may therefore reconsider the foundation’s mandate to make it more powerful in discussions with company management...|$|E
