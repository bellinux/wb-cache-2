500|$|In news {{coverage}} that aired in January 2005 of {{the filming of}} the rodeo scene, Bobby Rowe, producer of the Salem, Virginia rodeo depicted in the film, provided background on how he had become {{the victim of a}} hoax.

500|$|Just {{like the}} text—which was mostly written {{on top of}} {{photographs}}—the photographs on the book are highly sexual and depict nudity, [...] simulations of sexual acts, bondage, homosexuality and analingus, with accessories such as knives, whips, masks and chains; however, full intercourse is never shown. Aside from unknown models, featured in the book are actress Isabella Rossellini, rappers Big Daddy Kane and Madonna's then boyfriend Vanilla Ice, model Naomi Campbell, gay porn star Joey Stefano, actor Udo Kier, socialite Tatiana von Fürstenberg, and nightclub owner Ingrid Casares; however the heterosexual photos in the book involve only Madonna and Vanilla Ice. Madonna herself is featured partially or completely naked. One of the book's most famous photographs shows Madonna hitchhiking completely naked in Miami. The book also reflects a great part on Dita's perspective towards her own sexuality. Dita writes in Sex that her [...] "pussy" [...] is a temple of learning and that exposing it, is really a homage to it ("It's hard to describe it smells like a baby to me fresh and full of life. I love my pussy, it is the complete summation of my life"). Sex contains statements like [...] "ass fucking is the most pleasurable way to get fucked and it hurts the most too". Others include [...] "here is something comforting about being tied up. Like {{when you were a}} baby and your mother strapped you in the car seat. She wanted you to be safe. It was an act of love" [...] and [...] "I wouldn't want a penis. It would be like having a third leg. it seems like a contraption that would get <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>way.</b> <b>I</b> think I have a dick in my brain".

500|$|On 30 August 1942, at {{the time}} when Stanley was {{preparing}} the draft drawings of the murals, the Japanese began an action which would become known as the Selarang Barracks Incident. It was an incident concerning seventeen thousand Anglo-Australian POWs, who were forced to vacate their buildings and be exposed for nearly five days in the open without water or sanitation for refusing to sign a [...] "No Escape Pledge". Against this backdrop, Stanley began to paint the murals. No one had asked the Japanese for permission to draw and at no stage did they interfere with his work. Considering the purpose of the murals, Stanley felt that the Chapel was basically dedicated to peace and reconciliation, and so he choose universal themes for the murals which would embrace all mankind. Paint was not readily available in the camp, but with the aid of the other prisoners, who unquestionably put themselves at great risk, materials to make the paint were gradually acquired—brown camouflage paint, a small amount of crimson paint, white oil paint and billiard chalk were found and brought for Stanley use. Despite still being very ill, Stanley set to work on the murals in early September 1942. His illness meant that he could only paint for a limited period each day, for perhaps 15 minutes at a time followed by a rest. To compensate {{as much as he could}} for the lack of coloured paint, Stanley resorted to using large brush strokes and big areas of solid colour when painting. In September 1942, a few weeks after Stanley began painting the murals, he was informed that his work party was to be sent north to Thailand to work on the Thai-Burma Railway. A colonel in charge of the hospital, who knew of his work-in-progress murals, intervened to have Stanley transferred back to the hospital so that he could continue on his work in the Chapel. Most of Stanley's unit who went to the Thai-Burma Railway never returned. Stanley recounted: [...] "Had I gone with them, most certainly, I would have died. So the murals very directly saved my life <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>I</b> could never have foreseen... It's a terrible sense of debt... that one feels to the chapel." ...|$|E

However, in September 2007, DJ Kay Slay revealed that he and Papoose had left Jive, commenting that they had [...] "almost [...] victims of A hell."

2500|$|I was {{absolutely}} gobsmacked. I said, “This is horrible.

And I was like, “Wow. That was crazy.” I mean, I really didn’t see that coming. So at that point, I distanced myself from the movie.
