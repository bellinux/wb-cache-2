500|$|Comparing {{the ending}} scene {{to those of}} {{previous}} series of Blackadder in which the main characters were also killed, the writer Richard Curtis commented that [...] "I think it was by chance that [...] ended with Blackadder being killed ... but series four, we did <b>do</b> <b>it</b> <b>very</b> much on purpose." [...] He {{said that he and}} Elton felt they could use the First World War as a setting if the characters died, considering [...] "if we did do that ... it would not be too disrespectful, and would actually represent some of the tragedy of the First World War".|$|E
500|$|He often played {{supporting}} roles, {{rather than}} the lead part. He said [...] "throughout my career, I've never been a huge star, but I've made steady progress and that's the way I like it," [...] and [...] "It's fun coming in as {{the second or third}} lead. If the movie or TV show bombs, you aren't to blame." [...] Hartman was considered a [...] "utility player" [...] on SNL with a [...] "kind of Everyman quality" [...] which enabled him to appear in the majority of sketches, often in very distinct roles. Jan Hooks stated of his work on SNL: [...] "Phil never had an ounce of competition. He was a team player. It was a privilege for him, I believe, to play support and <b>do</b> <b>it</b> <b>very</b> well. He was never insulted, no matter how small the role may have been." [...] He was disciplined in his performances, studying the scripts beforehand. Hooks added: [...] "Phil knew how to listen. And he knew how to look you in the eye, and he knew the power of being able to lay back and let somebody else be funny, and then do the reactions. I think Phil was more of an actor than a comedian." [...] Film critic Pauline Kael declared that [...] "Phil Hartman and Jan Hooks on Saturday Night Live are two of the best comic actors I've ever seen." ...|$|E

2500|$|Winchester was {{respected}} by the others professionally, {{but at the}} same time, as a Boston blue blood, he was also snobbish, as when he stated in the scrub room, [...] "I do one thing at a time, I <b>do</b> <b>it</b> <b>very</b> well, and then I move on," [...] which drove much of his conflict with the other characters. Still, the show's writers occasionally allowed Winchester's humanity to shine through, such as in his dealings with a young concert pianist who had partially lost the use of his right hand, the protection of a stuttering soldier from the bullying of other soldiers (it is revealed later that Winchester's sister Honoria stutters), his keeping a vigil with Hawkeye when Hawkeye's father went into surgery back in the States ("Sons and Bowlers"), his willingness to be officer of the day for Hawkeye when Hawkeye was offered three days in Seoul, giving blood to a patient even though he already donated blood five days earlier, or his continuing a family tradition of anonymously giving Christmas treats to an orphanage. Winchester subjects himself to condemnation after realizing that [...] "it is sadly inappropriate to offer dessert to a child who has had no meal." [...] Isolating himself, he is saved by Klinger's own gift of understanding. Klinger scrapes together a Christmas dinner for Charles, with the provision that the source of the gift remain anonymous (Klinger had overheard Winchester's argument with the manager of the orphanage). For the final moment of the episode ("Death Takes a Holiday"), the two are simply friends as Charles says, [...] "Thank you, Max," [...] and Klinger replies, [...] "Merry Christmas, Charles." [...] As well, in the series finale [...] "Goodbye, Farewell, and Amen", Charles comes across a group of Chinese musicians who surrender to him. When Charles takes them back to the camp as prisoners of war and later listens to his record of Mozart's [...] Quintet in A major for Clarinet and Strings, K. 581, the musicians attempt to play the piece of music. Charles, ever the perfectionist, cannot stand to hear them play the piece incorrectly (and is impressed that they can even attempt to play the music after only hearing it once) and spends the next week conducting them on how to play the piece properly. During this time, Charles is forced to use the little patience that he rarely shows. When the Chinese musicians are taken off to a prisoner of war camp in a prisoner exchange to Charles' dismay and protest, their final goodbye to Charles is the Mozart piece played correctly. Later, one of the musicians returns to the camp mortally wounded on a Jeep. When Charles inquires as to where the other musicians are, it's revealed that the truck the musicians were on was ambushed and that there were no other survivors. In a combination of shock and disbelief, Charles returns to The Swamp to listen to the Mozart record, but removes the record and smashes it in anger. Later still on the final night that everyone at the M*A*S*H is together, Charles says that before the war, music was a stress reliever to him, but because of the Chinese musicians and their fate, music will forever be a reminder of the horrors of war.|$|E
