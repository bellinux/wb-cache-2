5|$|Von Neumann {{founded the}} field of game theory as a {{mathematical}} discipline. Von Neumann proved his minimax theorem in 1928. This theorem establishes that in zero-sum games with perfect information (i.e. in which players <b>know</b> <b>at</b> each time all moves {{that have taken place}} so far), there exists a pair of strategies for both players that allows each to minimize his maximum losses, hence the name minimax. When examining every possible strategy, a player must consider all the possible responses of his adversary. The player then plays out the strategy that will result in the minimization of his maximum loss.|$|E
5|$|In 112, Zhang {{was summoned}} {{to the court of}} Emperor An (r.106–125), who had heard of his {{expertise}} in mathematics. When he was nominated to serve at the capital, Zhang was escorted by carriage—a symbol of his official status—to Luoyang, where he became a court gentleman working for the Imperial Secretariat. He was promoted to Chief Astronomer for the court, serving his first term from 115–120 under Emperor An and his second under the succeeding emperor from 126–132. As Chief Astronomer, Zhang was a subordinate of the Minister of Ceremonies, one of Nine Ministers ranked just below the Three Excellencies. In addition to recording heavenly observations and portents, preparing the calendar, and reporting which days were auspicious and which ill-omened, Zhang was also in charge of an advanced literacy test for all candidates to the Imperial Secretariat and the Censorate, both of whose members were required to <b>know</b> <b>at</b> least 9,000 characters and all major writing styles. Under Emperor An, Zhang also served as Prefect of the Majors for Official Carriages under the Ministry of Guards, in charge of receiving memorials to the throne (formal essays on policy and administration) as well as nominees for official appointments.|$|E
25|$|In 1900, Rilke {{stayed at}} the artists' colony at Worpswede. (Later, his {{portrait}} would be painted by the proto-expressionist Paula Modersohn-Becker, whom he got to <b>know</b> <b>at</b> Worpswede.) It was here that he {{got to know the}} sculptor Clara Westhoff, whom he married the following year. Their daughter Ruth (1901–1972) was born in December 1901.|$|E

25|$|The Upper Palaeolithic period {{covers the}} end of the last {{glaciation}} Devensian Stage and the immediate post-glacial period Flandrian. At the beginning of this period Britain was a part of the European landmass and settlement in Norfolk was just an extension of the settlement of the North European Plain, while by {{the end of}} this period it had become more or less the island that we now <b>know.</b> <b>At</b> {{the end of the}} Devensian the sea-level was about 30 m below present with most of the land becoming forested with the ameliorating climate. In the mid-9th millennium BP, with the breaching of the land bridge, East Anglia became cut off from the rest of north-west Europe. Sea levels rose rapidly and peat formation commenced in low-lying areas.|$|E

25|$|In 1891, all Die Jungen {{were either}} {{expelled}} from the SPD or left voluntarily. They then founded the Union of Independent Socialists (VUS). Rocker became a member and founded a local section in Mainz, mostly active in distributing anarchist literature smuggled in from Belgium or the Netherlands in the city. He was a regular speaker at labor union meetings. On December 18, 1892, he spoke {{at a meeting of}} unemployed workers. Impressed by Rocker's speech, the speaker that followed Rocker, who was not from Mainz and therefore did not <b>know</b> <b>at</b> what point the police would intervene, advised the unemployed to take from the rich, rather to starve. The meeting was then dissolved by the police. The speaker was arrested, while Rocker barely escaped. He decided to flee Germany to Paris via Frankfurt. He had, however, already been toying with the idea of leaving the country, in order to learn new languages, get to know anarchist groups abroad, and, above all, to escape conscription.|$|E
25|$|Following {{the success}} of the Concord, Sauer {{branched}} out and began experimenting with Vitis vinifera including Sémillon and Chenin blanc. These early vinifera plantings didn't survive in the rich-soil that they Concords were planted and soon Sauer began looking at the steep hills with poorer soils. In 1973, when a friend had a buyer back out at the last minutes on Cabernet Sauvignon cuttings, Sauer took the cuttings and planted 3 acres even though he didn't <b>know</b> <b>at</b> the time if Cabernet Sauvignon was a white wine grape or a red wine grape. During this same time, Sauer was working with Dr. Walter Clore of the WSU extension and research facility in Prosser to plant an experimental vineyard of grapes like Chardonnay, Gewürztraminer, Riesling and other varieties {{to see what kind of}} grapes could survive the cold Yakima Valley winters and grow to full ripeness.|$|E
25|$|Several {{reasons were}} {{initially}} posited by media sources {{and family members}} for why Menezes may have run from police, as indicated by initial reports. A few weeks prior, he had been attacked by a gang and may have perceived {{that he was in}} a similar situation upon seeing plainclothes officers chasing him. Several sources have speculated that irregularities about his immigration status may have given him reason to be wary of the police; evidence that emerged {{during the course of the}} criminal trial into the Health and Safety charge showed that Menezes was lawfully in the country on 22 July 2005. This is mentioned in the Stockwell One report, at footnote 4 on page 21. The Sydney Morning Herald reported that a colleague believed that Menezes ran simply because he was late for his job. It was later indicated by the leaked IPCC documents that Menezes may have run across the platform to get a seat on the train, and did not <b>know</b> <b>at</b> the time that he was being watched or pursued.|$|E

25|$|Räikkönen {{qualified}} on {{the front}} row for Ferrari's home race at Monza, but a complete lack of movement {{for a few seconds}} at the start saw him drop down the order. Showing good pace however, he managed to pick his way {{from the back of the}} field to fifth. Räikkönen blamed a 'clutch positioning' problem, whilst team boss Arrivabene suggested Räikkönen had caused the anti-stall to kick in himself due to 'messing with his fingers' although he clarified it saying he did not fully <b>know</b> <b>at</b> the time. Nevertheless, he remained at one podium of the season, as team mate Vettel finished second to take his tally to eight in twelve races. At the Singapore Grand Prix, Räikkönen showed consistent performances in the practice sessions and qualified in 3rd, behind Sebastian Vettel and Daniel Ricciardo. Räikkönen maintained the position through the race despite being uncomfortable with the car, to take his second podium finish of the season. Räikkönen ended the season by finishing third in the season-ending Abu Dhabi Grand Prix to take his third podium of the year and securing fourth place in the Drivers' Championship.|$|E

500|$|Hughes then {{phoned the}} police {{and told them that}} Evans was confused, had a rifle, and was on valium. Four policemen arrived and three of them, David D. Krempa, Robert E. Brannon and Lieutenant Higbie, went up to the bedroom. They later {{reported}} that as soon as Evans saw the three policemen he pointed a rifle at them. The officers repeatedly told Evans to put down the rifle (which they did not <b>know</b> <b>at</b> the time was an air rifle) but Evans constantly refused. The police fired six shots, four hitting Evans and killing him.

But, you <b>know,</b> <b>at</b> {{the end of the}} day, in Storybrooke, she’s still trying to fill this void that Maleficent warned her about." [...] Leading up to the episode broadcast, Parrilla also gave a preview of what viewers could expect.

You’re going to see how threatening that is to Regina, and, as you know, she really takes on these challenges full force." ...|$|E

Stone's immediate focus was on state referenda under consideration in New York and Nebraska. Stone presented a speech she had prepared entitled [...] "The Progress of Fifty Years" [...] wherein she described the milestones of change, and said [...] "I think, with never-ending gratitude, that the young women of today do not and can never <b>know</b> <b>at</b> what price their {{right to free speech}} and to speak at all in public has been earned."
