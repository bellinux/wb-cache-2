500|$|With his {{professional}} football career frozen in limbo by the NFL lockout, Munnerlyn spent the spring at Mobile's Murphy High School (his alma mater) {{as a volunteer}} assistant, and the experience opened {{his eyes to the}} possibilities of life after football. Through 10 days of the Panthers' spring practice, Munnerlyn tutored Murphy's defensive backs as part of veteran coach Ronn Lee's staff. [...] "It was fun," [...] Munnerlyn said by phone from North Carolina, where he participated in informal workouts with his Carolina teammates. [...] "Coach Lee <b>gave</b> <b>me</b> <b>the</b> <b>opportunity</b> to coach the defensive backs and give them some of the knowledge I have from the past, from high school, college and the NFL." ...|$|E
500|$|In 1988, Kulwicki hired Paul Andrews as {{his crew}} chief after Andrews was {{recommended}} by Rusty Wallace at the 1987 NASCAR Awards banquet. That year Kulwicki {{won his first}} NASCAR Winston Cup race in the season's second-to-last race at Phoenix International Raceway after race leader Ricky Rudd's car had motor problems late in the race. Kulwicki led 41laps and won by 18.5seconds. After the race finished, he turned his car around and made, what he called, a [...] "Polish victory lap" [...] by driving the opposite way (clockwise) on the track, with the driver's {{side of the car}} facing the fans. [...] "This <b>gave</b> <b>me</b> <b>the</b> <b>opportunity</b> to wave to the crowd from the driver's side", Kulwicki explained. Andrews recalled, [...] "He had wanted to do something special and something different for his first win and only his first." [...] He finished the 1988 season with fourpole positions in 29events, nine top10 finishes including twosecond-place finishes, twelve DNFs, and an average finish of 19.2. Kulwicki finished 14th in the Winston Cup points standings for the season.|$|E
500|$|A New York City {{police detective}} with a scandal {{attached}} to his name who is desperate to make Detective First Grade. He is assigned {{to negotiate with the}} ringleader of a Manhattan bank heist. Inside Man marks Washington's fourth collaboration with director Spike Lee. After being approached by Lee to star in the film, he was given the opportunity to play Frazier or Dalton Russell, but turned down the latter, citing concerns over the character's disguise. TotalFilm.com|date=March 24, 2006|accessdate=April 13, 2013|work=Total Film}} Washington cited his Broadway performance as Brutus in Julius Caesar as inspiration: [...] "I think it actually helped me prepare for Frazier—Russell ’s script is heavy with great dialogue. My character does a lot of talking! I kind of thought of Frazier as Brutus goes to Brooklyn. For me, there is a certain rhythm and cadence of New Yorkers, and this <b>gave</b> <b>me</b> <b>the</b> <b>opportunity</b> to play a New York kind of guy who’s going through a lot while dealing with this smart and challenging adversary." ...|$|E

2500|$|In 1998 Davis, a {{committed}} Christian, was left a tetraplegic after suffering spinal injuries {{as a result}} of a fall from a tree in St Vincent suffered whilst helping clear land for a new church. He was flown to England for treatment unavailable on the island, and now lives in Worcestershire, England. He has appeared in a film, Because of You, made by Worcestershire County Council's Social Services department; he said of this film, [...] "People with a disability can often be seen as just takers and so for me, starring in this film <b>gave</b> <b>me</b> <b>the</b> <b>opportunity</b> to give something back to the community". Several benefit matches have been held with the object of raising money to help him live a more comfortable life, and have featured a number of high-profile cricketers: in 2005 a Lashings Cricket Club side beat a Winston Davis XI by 87 runs in a match graced by such names as Chris Cairns, V. V. S. Laxman and Alvin Kallicharran.|$|E
2500|$|Westbrook did {{not return}} and made her final {{appearance}} as Sam on 24 January 2000. She has since confessed that her drug taking was the reason why she was written out. In her autobiography she comments, [...] "I wasn't fired this time, but let's just say when they <b>gave</b> <b>me</b> <b>the</b> <b>opportunity</b> to walk I took it. I was no longer interested in acting and that had become blatantly obvious to everyone on set. The soap was now being shown {{four times a week}} and it was impossible to balance the workload with my addiction [...] Not only had [...] destroyed my nose, but it was about to destroy my career again as well [...] The producers were tiring of my behaviour [...] When I did leave the production at the end of 1999 it was in fact a fairly mutual decision. I admit that had I begged the producers to let me stay this time I doubt if they would have allowed me to. But I was happy to go [...] Looking back to that point now it fills me with shame that I could have behaved in that way and let down so many people". Following her axing, Westbrook's eroded nasal septum was revealed to the public by the press, after she was photographed at the 2000 British Soap Awards.|$|E
2500|$|Debney called Iron Man 2 [...] "odd in {{that there}} were {{not a lot of}} places where a true superhero theme could be played. Tony Stark is uber cool even as Iron Man, so, musically, we couldn’t state a {{full-blown}} superhero theme. The strains of Iron Man’s theme are heard only in a few spots by design. I’m hoping with future films, Iron Man might get his full-blown theme played aggressively." [...] For instance, Debney recorded several different versions of the score for scenes where Stark puts on the Iron Man suit, each with [...] "different portions of the theme fleshed out or left out". What was ultimately chosen [...] "was less thematic. It was sort of a groove {{with a little bit of}} French horn. Maybe that was the right choice, but it was a difficult decision. It was difficult to find the areas in the movie where we could let Tony be a superhero." [...] He continued, [...] "There were moments where I wanted to play a scene broadly or make a love scene out of it but we were never able to go there", such as for the end of the film where [...] "Tony finally kisses Pepper ... there were a couple of versions I did that were really gorgeous and lush but it just didn't fit. It's a different kind of movie because they kiss and then all of a sudden the mood is broken. It's just the nature of this character." [...] Debney felt that this process led to the score being [...] "watered down and mashed up a little bit" [...] from what he originally intended. However, Debney did not feel the same about his music for the villain, Ivan Vanko, which he described as a personal [...] "joy". He said that Favreau [...] "gave me a great opportunity to get into [...] scene and learn 's circumstances and to play sincerely sad music for him and the relationship he had with his father. Jon <b>gave</b> <b>me</b> <b>the</b> <b>opportunity</b> to morph that and turn it into something really dark and twisted. For me that was the most satisfactory part of the score and the film". For Vanko's theme, the choir sang in Russian to [...] "capture the dark Russian soul" [...] of the character.|$|E

60|$|I was in {{the islands}} to write letters for the weekly edition of the Sacramento 'Union,' a rich and {{influential}} daily journal which hadn't any use for them, but could afford to spend twenty dollars a week for nothing.

She received me very pleasantly, and did not say one word about our conversation of the day before. There were a good many things I should have liked to say, but I did not know how, unless she <b>gave</b> <b>me</b> <b>the</b> <b>opportunity.</b> But she did not, and so it happened that we talked only about something she was sewing--I do not know whether it was a shirt-waist or an army blanket. In fact, I did not hear one word she said about her stupid work, whatever it was, I was so busy re-studying her face, her character, and everything about her. I now found she was much more than satisfactory--she was really good-looking. Her eyes were not very large, but they were soft and dark. Her voice was clear and sweet. I had noticed this before, but, until now, I had not thought of it as an objection. There were a good many other things that might be very effective to a man, especially to one with half-healed sorrows. I acknowledged to myself that I had been mistaken in her, and I did not doubt she had deceived a good many other people in that neighborhood.|$|E
