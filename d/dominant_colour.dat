5|$|The Storm {{was always}} going to go with the colours of their state, Victoria (Navy blue with a white 'V'), but club {{consultant}} at the time, Peter McWhirter of the JAG fashion house, suggested that they should also have purple and gold to make their merchandise more attractive. These colours appear in the logo, however, on the home jersey they have varied. Between 1998 and 2004 these four colours also appeared but between 2005 and 2009, gold was completely removed and silver introduced. Between 2010–2012, gold returned and silver was omitted, purple also became the <b>dominant</b> <b>colour</b> in the jersey. For 2013 a new design was announced featuring a deeper V, with more navy blue in the jersey, gold disappeared along with most of the white, the lightning bolts were also changed to purple. During 2015 the jersey changed again for the first time not featuring a V at all, but the V returned somewhat along with the lightning bolts in 2016 with a manufacturer change. Over the years and in all variations of the Jersey, Navy Blue and Purple always remain the main colours.|$|E
5|$|In the {{original}} club constitution, Bayern's colours were named as white and blue, but the club played in white shirts with black shorts until 1905, when Bayern joined MSC. MSC decreed that the footballers {{would have to}} play in red shorts. Also, the younger players were called red shorts, which was meant as an insult. For most of the club's early history, Bayern had primarily worn white and maroon home kits. In 1968–69 season, Bayern changed to red and blue striped shirts, with blue shorts and socks. Between 1969 and 1973, the team wore a home strip of red and white striped shirts with either red or white shorts and red socks. In the 1973–74 season, the team switched to an all white kit featuring single vertical red and blue stripes on the shirt. From 1974 onwards, Bayern have mostly worn an all red home kit, with white trim. Bayern revived the red and blue striped colour scheme between 1995 and 1997. In 1997, blue was the <b>dominant</b> <b>colour</b> {{for the first time}} when Adidas released an all navy blue home kit with a red chest band. In 1999, Bayern returned to a predominantly red kit, which featured blue sleeves, and in 2000 the club released a traditional all red kit with white trim to be worn for Champions League matches. Bayern also wore a Rotwein coloured home kits in Bundesliga matches between 2001 and 2003, and during the 2006–07 Champions League campaign, in reference to their first choice colours prior to the late 1960s.|$|E

500|$|The Holy Thorn Reliquary {{is made of}} gold, enamel, rock crystal, pearls, rubies and sapphires. It is {{just over}} [...] high and weighs [...] There are some areas of damage (including {{what appears to be}} {{deliberate}} removal of enamel in the 19th century), and small losses and repairs; but generally the reliquary is in good condition. The central front compartment holding the relic is protected by a thin pane of rock crystal, which has kept it in perfect condition. The enamel is mostly in ronde bosse technique, applied to three-dimensional figures, with white as the <b>dominant</b> <b>colour.</b> White enamel using lead was only recently developed, and very fashionable, dominating many contemporary ronde bosse works. There is also red, green, blue, pink and black enamel. Pure gold is used throughout, which is rare even in royal commissions of such pieces at this period; most use cheaper silver-gilt for the structural framework.|$|E

2500|$|The main {{characteristic}} of the new design {{was the use of}} multicoloured tints beneath the <b>dominant</b> <b>colour.</b> This series was often dubbed the [...] "multicoloured series". With the exception of the $1 note, the use of black ink was abandoned. Furthermore, the words [...] "this note is legal tender" [...] replaced the phrase [...] "will pay to the bearer on demand," [...] reflecting the fact that Canada's currency had long ceased to be redeemable in gold. The $1,000 denomination was not included in this issue.|$|E
2500|$|The {{original}} 1972 design {{featured the}} now-traditional colours {{of blue and}} orange, but reversed from their more familiar appearance in later seasons, orange being the <b>dominant</b> <b>colour</b> and blue used for the trimming. For the first few games of the 1972 season, player names were not displayed on the uniform; rather the word [...] "ALBERTA" [...] was written in that space. About halfway through the season, though, the player names made their appearance, since the Oilers had played exclusively in Edmonton. These jerseys also featured the player numbers high on the shoulders, {{rather than on the}} upper sleeve.|$|E

40|$|A colour {{segmentation}} {{method is}} described {{which is based}} on a seeded region growing (SRG) segmentation algorithm. First the 3 -D histogram in the Lab colour coordinate system is extracted. The histogram bins are then grouped using a hierarchical clustering algorithm. The number of classes can be automatically determined, while a k-means algorithm is used for determining the nal list of <b>dominant</b> <b>colours.</b> The classication according to the <b>dominant</b> <b>colours</b> determines the initial seeds for a region growing segmentation algorithm. Segmentation is followed by a merging procedure {{which is based on}} colour and boundary information of regions. The proposed algorithm has been tested on facial images, for the needs of face detection. 1...|$|R
2500|$|RTÉ {{decided that}} the channel needed another revamp to keep it fresh. The channel's name reverted to RTÉ Two {{on the morning of}} 2 October 2004, with a themed evening of {{programmes}} called [...] "Farewell Network 2" [...] beginning at 20:00, featuring Podge and Rodge (see The Den). The new logo is similar in style to the current RTÉ One logo. The new branding is designed to promote the Irishness of the station, green is the <b>dominant</b> <b>colour.</b> New strands were developed. In particular, the number of Irish made programmes has increased, though some of this is made up of a new strand of early evening repeats. The idents from this time were based on a Green Room theme.|$|E
60|$|The {{animal was}} {{certainly}} not cinnamon-coloured. Its coat was the true wolf-coat. The <b>dominant</b> <b>colour</b> was grey, and yet there was to it a faint reddish hue--a hue that was baffling, that appeared and disappeared, that was more like an illusion of the vision, now grey, distinctly grey, and again giving hints and glints of a vague redness of colour not classifiable in terms of ordinary experience.|$|E
60|$|Apparently the {{vegetable}} kingdom in Mars, {{instead of having}} green for a <b>dominant</b> <b>colour,</b> is of a vivid blood-red tint. At any rate, the seeds which the Martians (intentionally or accidentally) brought with them gave rise in all cases to red-coloured growths. Only that known popularly as the red weed, however, gained any footing in competition with terrestrial forms. The red creeper was quite a transitory growth, and few people have seen it growing. For a time, however, the red weed grew with astonishing vigour and luxuriance. It spread {{up the sides of}} the pit by the third or fourth day of our imprisonment, and its cactus-like branches formed a carmine fringe to the edges of our triangular window. And afterwards I found it broadcast throughout the country, and especially wherever there was a stream of water.|$|E

40|$|In this paper, {{we propose}} a fully {{automatic}} and computationally efficient algorithm {{for analysis of}} sports videos. The goal of the proposed method is to identify regions that perform certain activities in a scene. The model uses some low-level feature video processing algorithms to extract the shot boundaries from a video scene and to identify <b>dominant</b> <b>colours</b> within these boundaries. An object classification method is used for clustering the seed distributions of the <b>dominant</b> <b>colours</b> to homogeneous regions. Using a simple tracking method a classification of these regions to active or static is performed. The efficiency of the proposed framework is demonstrated over a standard video benchmark with numerous types of sport events and the experimental results show that our algorithm {{can be used with}} high accuracy for automatic annotation of active regions for sport videos...|$|R

40|$|Automatic video {{segmentation}} plays a {{vital role}} in sports videos annotation. This paper presents a fully automatic and computationally efficient algorithm for analysis of sports videos. Various methods of automatic shot boundary detection have been proposed to perform automatic video segmentation. These investigations mainly concentrate on detecting fades and dissolves for fast processing of the entire video scene without providing any additional feedback on object relativity within the shots. The goal of the proposed method is to identify regions that perform certain activities in a scene. The model uses some low-level feature video processing algorithms to extract the shot boundaries from a video scene and to identify <b>dominant</b> <b>colours</b> within these boundaries. An object classification method is used for clustering the seed distributions of the <b>dominant</b> <b>colours</b> to homogeneous regions. Using a simple tracking method a classification of these regions to active or static is performed. The efficiency of the proposed framework is demonstrated over a standard video benchmark with numerous types of sport events and the experimental results show that our algorithm can be used with high accuracy for automatic annotation of active regions for sport videos...|$|R
40|$|The paper {{presents}} an android based application to assist visually impaired with outfit coordination process. The application helps {{them to be}} independent in their decisions while shopping or {{getting ready for the}} day. The application matches apparel image input with user's previously saved closet items, then provides the user with the possible matching item suggestions. The matching process is done based on the item outline and dominating colours. In order to develop this application five main components have been developed: 1. Two Region of interest (ROI) extraction components facilitating feature and colour extraction; 2. An outline detection component to determine whether an item is a top, skirt or a pair of trousers; 3. A colour recognition component to extract <b>dominant</b> <b>colours</b> of an apparel image; 4. A descriptive colour verbal feedback; 5. A matching component based on item outline and colours to coordinate with others in the user‟s closet. The output to the user includes the descriptive colours, communicated via audio, indicating the 3 <b>dominant</b> <b>colours</b> using their descriptive names- selected from a pool of 581 different colour shades. Other output is the outline details of the matching items. The application was developed and tested on Android 2. 2 (Froyo) and the results showed that the ROI extraction and outline detection components perform well. The colour recognition and descriptive name generation modules outperforms the current ones...|$|R

This changed in 1986 when the business became Cardiff Bus. However, since the 1990s the <b>dominant</b> <b>colouring</b> has been green, first with cream lining and since the introduction of modern wrapping, a return for orange in the adjustments/outline.|$|R
