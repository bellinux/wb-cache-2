5|$|Research {{is being}} {{conducted}} on many {{different approaches to}} prevent Huntington's disease or slow its progression. Disease-modifying strategies can be broadly grouped into three categories: reducing {{the level of the}} mutant huntingtin protein (including <b>gene</b> <b>splicing</b> and gene silencing); approaches aimed at improving neuronal survival by reducing the harm caused by the protein to specific cellular pathways and mechanisms (including protein homeostasis and histone deacetylase inhibition); and strategies to replace lost neurons. In addition, novel therapies to improve brain functioning are under development; these seek to produce symptomatic rather than disease-modifying therapies, and include phosphodiesterase inhibitors.|$|E
5|$|Gene {{silencing}} aims {{to reduce}} {{the production of the}} mutant protein, since HD is caused by a single dominant gene encoding a toxic protein. Gene silencing experiments in mouse models have shown that when the expression of mHTT is reduced, symptoms improve. Safety of non-allele specific RNAi and ASO gene silencing has now been demonstrated in mice and the large, human-like brains of primates. Allele-specific silencing attempts to silence mutant HTT while leaving wild-type HTT untouched. One way of accomplishing this is to identify polymorphisms present on only one allele and produce gene silencing drugs that target polymorphisms in only the mutant allele. The first 'gene silencing' trial involving human HD patients began in 2015, testing the safety of IONIS-HTTRx, produced by Ionis Pharmaceuticals and led by UCL Institute of Neurology. Mutant huntingtin was detected and quantified {{for the first time in}} cerebrospinal fluid from Huntington's disease mutation-carriers in 2015 using a novel 'single-molecule counting' immunoassay, providing a direct way to assess whether huntingtin-lowering treatments are achieving the desired effect. Similarly, <b>gene</b> <b>splicing</b> techniques are being looked at to try to repair a genome with the erroneous gene that causes HD, using tools such as CRISPR/Cas9.|$|E
25|$|In 1977, Frederick Sanger {{achieved}} the first complete sequencing {{of the genome}} of any organism, the bacteriophage Phi X 174. In the same year, Richard Roberts and Phillip Sharp independently showed that the genes of adenovirus contain introns and therefore require <b>gene</b> <b>splicing.</b> It was later realized that almost all genes of eukaryotes have introns as well.|$|E
50|$|Alternative {{splicing}} {{results in}} two transcript variants encoding the same protein. This gene and {{the gene that}} encodes ribonuclease, RNase A family, 4 share promoters and 5' exons. Each <b>gene</b> <b>splices</b> to a unique downstream exon that contains its complete coding region.|$|R
50|$|The Ettins in Creatures 2 were infertile; however, in Creatures 3, {{there were}} two Ettins aboard the Shee Ark at most times (both female), and it was {{possible}} to get them to breed if two of them were placed in the <b>Gene</b> <b>Splicer</b> machine to create a male Ettin.|$|R

25|$|Genetic engineering, {{recombinant}} DNA technology, genetic modification/manipulation (GM) and <b>gene</b> <b>splicing</b> are {{terms that}} apply to the direct manipulation of an organism's genes. Unlike traditional breeding, an indirect method of genetic manipulation, genetic engineering utilizes modern tools such as molecular cloning and transformation to directly alter the structure and characteristics of target genes. Genetic engineering techniques have found success in numerous applications. Some examples include the improvement of crop technology (not a medical application, but see biological systems engineering), the manufacture of synthetic human insulin {{through the use of}} modified bacteria, the manufacture of erythropoietin in hamster ovary cells, and the production of new types of experimental mice such as the oncomouse (cancer mouse) for research.|$|E
500|$|In Pokémon Red and Blue, {{the player}} learns of Mewtwo's {{existence}} by reading research notes {{left in the}} ruined Pokémon Mansion on Cinnabar Island. The notes say that the island's scientists discovered a new Pokémon in a Guyana jungle, that they named it Mew, and that it later {{gave birth to a}} creature they called Mewtwo; the game's Pokédex entry states that Mewtwo was [...] "created by a scientist after years of horrific <b>gene</b> <b>splicing</b> and DNA engineering experiments". Mewtwo proved too mighty to control, destroying the laboratory and escaping. The player is later given an opportunity to capture Mewtwo in the Cerulean Cave, which is accessible only after defeating the game's final bosses, the Elite Four and Blue; in the remakes Pokémon FireRed and LeafGreen this prerequisite was expanded, requiring the player to explore more thoroughly and record information on sixty Pokémon species before access to the cave would be granted. Mewtwo is catchable in Pokémon HeartGold and SoulSilver in the same location as before after defeating all of the gym leaders in Kanto. The character was also the focus of a promotion and downloadable content giveaway for Pokémon Black and White. Mewtwo also reappears in Pokémon X and Y after completing the main story, {{and is one of the}} handful of Pokémon capable of using the new Mega Evolution mechanic, as it can become either Mega Mewtwo X or Mega Mewtwo Y.|$|E
2500|$|The {{field of}} modern {{biotechnology}} is generally {{thought of as}} having been born in 1971 when Paul Berg's (Stanford) experiments in <b>gene</b> <b>splicing</b> had early success. [...] Herbert W. Boyer (Univ. Calif. at San Francisco) and Stanley N. Cohen (Stanford) significantly advanced the new technology in 1972 by transferring genetic material into a bacterium, such that the imported material would be reproduced. [...] The commercial viability of a biotechnology industry was significantly expanded on June 16, 1980, when the United States Supreme Court ruled that a genetically modified microorganism could be patented {{in the case of}} Diamond v. Chakrabarty. Indian-born Ananda Chakrabarty, working for General Electric, had modified a bacterium (of the Pseudomonas genus) capable of breaking down crude oil, which he proposed to use in treating oil spills. [...] (Chakrabarty's work did not involve gene manipulation but rather the transfer of entire organelles between strains of the Pseudomonas bacterium.|$|E
40|$|It is {{becoming}} clear that alternative splicing {{plays an important}} role in expanding protein diversity. However, the previous studies an codons usage did not distinguish alternative splicing from non-alternative splicing. Do codon usage patterns hold distinctions between them? Thus, we attempted to systematically compare the differences of synonymous codon usage patterns between alternatively and non-alternatively <b>spliced</b> <b>genes</b> by analyzing the large datasets from human genome. The results indicated: (1) There are highly significant differences in the average Nc values between non-alternatively <b>spliced</b> <b>genes</b> and the longer isoform genes as well as the shorter isoform genes, and the level of codon usage bias of non-alternatively <b>spliced</b> <b>genes</b> is to some extent higher than that in alternatively <b>spliced</b> <b>genes.</b> (2) Very extensive heterogeneity of G+C content in silent third codon position (GC 3 s) was evident among these genes, and it could be also shown there are highly significant differences in the average GC 3 s values between non-alternatively <b>spliced</b> <b>genes</b> and the longer isoform genes as well as the shorter isoform genes. (3) The Nc-plots and correspondence analysis reveal that codon usage bias are mainly dominated by mutation bias, and no correlation between gene expression level and synonymous codon biased usage is found in human genes. (4) Overall codon usage data analysis indicated that the C-ending codons usage has a highly significant differences between the longer isoform <b>genes</b> and non-alternatively <b>spliced</b> <b>genes</b> as well as the shorter isoform genes, it further found out that there is no significant differences of C-ending codons usage between the shorter isoform <b>genes</b> and non-alternatively <b>spliced</b> <b>genes.</b> Finally, our results seem to imply that alternative <b>splicing</b> <b>gene</b> may originate from non-alternative <b>splicing</b> <b>gene,</b> and may be created by DNA mutation or gene fusion, and be retained through nature selection and adaptive evolution...|$|R
