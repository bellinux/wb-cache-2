40|$|The {{aim of this}} {{research}} was to investigate the integration of computer-aided drafting and finite-element analysis in a linked computer-aided design procedure and to develop the necessary software. The Be'zier surface patch for surface representation was used {{to bridge the gap between}} the rather separate fields of drafting and finite-element analysis because the surfaces are defined by analytical functions which allow systematic and controlled variation of the shape and provide continuous derivatives up to any required degree. The objectives of {{this research}} were achieved by establishing : (i) A package which interpretes the engineering drawings of plate and shell structures and prepares the Be'zier net necessary for surface representation. (ii) A general purpose stand-alone meshed-surface modelling package for surface representation of plates and shells using the Be'zier surface patch technique. (iii) A translator which adapts the geometric description of plate and shell structures as given by the meshed-surface modeller to the form needed by the finite-element analysis package. The translator was extended to suit <b>fan</b> <b>impellers</b> by taking advantage of their sectorial symmetry. The linking processes were carried out for simple test structures, simplified and actual <b>fan</b> <b>impellers</b> to verify the flexibility and usefulness of the linking technique adopted. Finite-element results for thin plate and shell structures showed excellent agreement with those obtained by other investigators while results for the simplified and actual <b>fan</b> <b>impellers</b> also showed good agreement with those obtained in an earlier investigation where finite-element analysis input data were manually prepared.

Formerly designed and manufactured, axial <b>fan</b> <b>impeller</b> blade geometry (originally designed by Prof. Dr-Ing. Z. Protić†) has been digitized using a three-dimensional (3 D) scanner. In parallel, the same impeller has been modeled by beta version software for modeling axial turbomachines, based on modified classical calculation. These results were compared.

40|$|Abstract. For a {{centrifugal}} <b>fan</b> <b>impeller</b> {{the blade}} shape {{can be defined}} using two parameters: the blade angle and the blade width. There are different design methods depending on the assumption made on both the blade width and the blade angle.

The sequential algorithm for solving the characteristic system of equations, which defines the blade geometry, is implemented in a MATLAB script file, for which principal code lines are explained. In the solving process of the characteristic system of equations for all four design methods considered, different relationships for relative velocity are obtained.

40|$|AbstractThis paper {{deals with}} {{optimizing}} {{the design of}} radial <b>fan</b> <b>impeller</b> using finite element analysis. Most manufacturing concerns spend more than a 60 % of their money for materials. The design of turbo machinery has been practiced {{in the last half}} of the previous century with increasing degree of sophistication. This trend of development is not complete because design of any turbo machine is interdisciplinary process involving aerodynamics, thermodynamics, fluid dynamics, stress analysis, vibration analysis, the selection of materials, and the requirements for manufacturing. So, products have not reached a level of full maturity. Today there is considerable room for further development of most turbo machinery products when looked at with the perspective of the broadest possible design world and when it comes to development at the design stage then various types of analysis of every component are performed on computer before the first prototype is built. Among these the major one end the most frequently used in the manufacturing of any mechanical part is stress analysis. As the mass of the fan is directly related to the thickness of the impeller parts hence our objective in this project is to minimize the thickness, keeping in consideration the operating restrictions and design parameters. This work concentrates on to generate the finite element model of backward curved aerofoil radial <b>fan</b> <b>impeller</b> which behaves mathematically like structure model & carry out stress analysis using ANSYS software. The analysis was carried out using the default thickness of the impeller of the radial fan. This results in massive weight of the fan, leading to large vibrations and one of the reasons to failure. Ways were found out to reduce all these things, so the analysis was carried using various reduced thicknesses of the impeller and the optimum thickness of the impeller parts found for the safe stress and strain limits. This value analysis/Engineering results in material reduction, cost reduction with reduced vibrations for the desired design and operating conditions. The basic procedures and issues involved in the Finite Element Analysis of a radial fan are also outlined.

40|$|Centrifugal {{fans are}} widely used in various {{industries}} {{as a kind of}} turbo machinery. Among the components of the centrifugal <b>fan,</b> the <b>impeller</b> is a key part because it is used to transform kinetic energy into pressure energy.

Based on blade vibration signals, this research applies an adaptive stochastic resonance (ASR) method to diagnose crack fault in centrifugal fan. The ASR method, which can utilize the optimization ability of the grid search method and adaptively realize the optimal stochastic resonance system matching input signals, may weaken the noise and highlight weak characteristic and thus can diagnose the fault accurately. A centrifugal fan test rig is established and experiments with three cases of blades are conducted.
