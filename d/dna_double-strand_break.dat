5|$|Although the {{structures}} of the BRCA1 and BRCA2 genes are very different, at least some functions are interrelated. The proteins made by both genes are essential for repairing damaged DNA (see Figure of recombinational repair steps). BRCA2 binds the single strand DNA and directly interacts with the recombinase RAD51 to stimulate strand invasion a vital step of homologous recombination. The localization of RAD51 to the <b>DNA</b> <b>double-strand</b> <b>break</b> requires the formation of BRCA1-PALB2-BRCA2 complex. PALB2 (Partner and localizer of BRCA2) can function synergistically with a BRCA2 chimera (termed piccolo, or piBRCA2) to further promote strand invasion. These breaks {{can be caused by}} natural and medical radiation or other environmental exposures, but also occur when chromosomes exchange genetic material during a special type of cell division that creates sperm and eggs (meiosis). Double strand breaks are also generated during repair of DNA cross links. By repairing DNA, these proteins play a role in maintaining the stability of the human genome and prevent dangerous gene rearrangements that can lead to hematologic and other cancers.|$|E

40|$|The {{repair of}} <b>DNA</b> <b>double-strand</b> <b>breaks</b> is a {{critical}} cellular mechanism that exists to ensure genomic stability. <b>DNA</b> <b>double-strand</b> <b>breaks</b> are the most deleterious type of insult to a cells genetic material {{and can lead to}} genomic instability, apoptosis or senescence. Incorrectly repaired <b>DNA</b> <b>double-strand</b> <b>breaks</b> have the potential to produce chromosomal translocations and genomic instability, potentially leading to cancer. The prevalence of <b>DNA</b> <b>double-strand</b> <b>breaks</b> in cancer due to unregulated growth and errors in repair opens up a potential therapeutic window in the treatment of cancers. The cellular response to <b>DNA</b> <b>double-strand</b> <b>breaks</b> is comprised of two pathways to ensure DNA breaks are repaired: homologous recombination and non-homologous end joining. Identifying chemotherapeutic compounds targeting proteins involved in these DNA repair pathways has shown promise as a cancer therapy for patients, either as a monotherapy or in combination with genotoxic drugs. From the beginning, {{there have been a number}} of chemotherapeutic compounds that have yielded successful responses in the clinic, a number that have failed (CGK 733 and Iniparib) and a number of promising targets for future studies identified.

40|$|The polA 1 {{mutation}} {{increases the}} sensitivity of E. coli K- 12 by killing by gamma-irradiation in air {{by a factor of}} 2. 9 and increases the yield of <b>DNA</b> <b>double-strand</b> <b>breaks</b> by a factor of 2. 5. These additional <b>DNA</b> <b>double-strand</b> <b>breaks</b> appear to be due to the action of nucleases in the polA 1 strain rather than to the rejoining of radiation-induced <b>double-strand</b> <b>breaks</b> in the pol+ strain. This conclusion is based upon the observation that gamma-irradiation at 3 degrees did not affect the yield of <b>DNA</b> <b>double-strand</b> <b>breaks</b> in the pol+ strain, but decreased the yield in the polA 1 strain by a factor of 2. 2. Irradiation of the polA 1 strain at 3 degrees followed by incubation at 3 degrees for 20 min before plating resulted in approximately a 1. 5 -fold increase in the D 0.

40|$|Abstract <b>DNA</b> <b>double-strand</b> <b>breaks</b> {{are among}} the most serious types of DNA damage and their {{signaling}} and repair is critical for all cells and organisms. The repair of both induced and programmed DNA breaks is fundamental as demonstrated by the many human syndromes, neurodegenerative diseases, immunodeficiency and cancer associated with defective repair of these DNA lesions. Homologous recombination and non-homologous end-joining pathways are the two major DNA repair pathways responsible for mediating the repair of <b>DNA</b> <b>double-strand</b> <b>breaks.</b> The signaling of <b>DNA</b> <b>double-strand</b> <b>breaks</b> is critical for cells to orchestrate the repair pathways and maintain genomic integrity. This signaling network is highly regulated and involves a growing number of proteins and elaborated posttranslational modifications including phosphorylation and ubiquitylation.
