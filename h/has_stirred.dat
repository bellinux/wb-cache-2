25|$|In the 2011 off-season, in {{an attempt}} to make a serious playoff run, the Blue Jackets traded Jakub Voracek, their 2011 first round pick (Sean Couturier) and a third round pick (Nick Cousins) to the Philadelphia Flyers for All-Star center Jeff Carter. They also signed several free agents: James Wisniewski, Vaclav Prospal and Radek Martinek. However, after a {{disastrous}} start to the 2011–12 season that saw the firing of head coach Scott Arniel, Carter was traded to the Los Angeles Kings for Jack Johnson and a conditional first round pick after playing just 39 games with the Blue Jackets. The Blue Jackets also traded veteran centers Antoine Vermette and Samuel Pahlsson for goaltender Curtis McElhinney and several draft picks at the trade deadline.

500|$|As war clouds cast {{an ominous}} shadow over Europe {{in the late}} 1930s amidst the rise of fascism, West, Goodman, and other BSA leaders {{considered}} how Scouting might better train youth in democratic principles of government. Referring to the Nazi Kristallnacht rampage against Jews in 1938, Goodman wrote shortly afterwards: [...] "...the program of persecution <b>has</b> <b>stirred</b> up our hearts and minds as nothing else that has happened before has done. It has furnished the impetus of a wave of resentment against the evil; but more than that, for a surge of satisfaction and thanksgiving concerning our own happier state under a democracy." [...] During World War II, various BSA programs were developed under his leadership {{in support of the}} nation's war effort, such as the collection of scrap aluminum, tires, and waste paper for recycling into war material, distribution of war bond and air raid posters, assisting Civil Defense officials, and planting of fruit and vegetable [...] "victory gardens".|$|E

[...] Daniels also said all the questions would be answered, such as who was behind the documentary, and why they had been filming it for so long, as well as the reveal of the Scranton Strangler. A central point during the season was the romance between Erin Hannon (Ellie Kemper) and Pete Miller (Jake Lacy). According to Michael Ausiello of TVLine, the nature of their relationship was heavily debated by the writers and producers; he noted that [...] "the triangle [...] <b>has</b> <b>stirred</b> up a number of debates in the writers room, which tells me even they don't know at this point which guy Erin will choose." [...] Daniels consulted with Kemper and asked for her input, as he felt she had the best understanding of Erin's characterization.|$|E
