25|$|After {{getting off}} to 2–7 start, the Mavericks {{eventually}} found {{themselves with the}} sixth spot in the Western Conference playoff bracket for 2009 after going 50–32 (ninth consecutive 50+-win season) and about {{three to four weeks}} earlier, weren't even sure {{if they were going to}} make the eighth and final spot. But a run of 5–1 in their last six regular season games <b>got</b> <b>them</b> <b>to</b> a game over the Hornets for sixth place. Dirk Nowitzki also entered the postseason with a streak of twenty-five consecutive games of scoring 20 or more points, which was ended in the first game of the quarterfinals series versus the arch-rival, San Antonio Spurs.|$|E

25|$|Bereket Gymnastic Club {{was founded}} under special {{permission}} on 4 March 1903. Their sporting activities gained more freedom with {{the declaration of}} the Constitutional Monarchy in 1908. After the political events of 31 March 1909, Fuat Balkan and Mazhar Kazancı, who were in Edirne, came to Istanbul with the Movement Army. After the political events settled down, Fuat Balkan, who was a good fencing coach, and Mazhar Kazancı, a good wrestler and weight lifter, found the youths involved in gymnastics in Serencebey and <b>got</b> <b>them</b> <b>to</b> agree to participate in sports together. Refik and Şerafettin Beys, friends of Fuat Bey, were also good fencers. Fuat Balkan made the space under his home in Ihlamur the Club’s headquarters, and the title of Bereket Gymnastics Club was changed to Beşiktaş Ottoman Gymnastics Club. Thus, a stronger sports club, where gymnastics, wrestling, boxing, fencing and athletics were emphasized, was formed. Founding member Mehmet Şamil Şhaplı was elected {{the first president of}} the club.|$|E
25|$|Ronaldinho {{was also}} praised for his {{performance}} in the Coupe de France when he scored both goals in the club's 2–0 win over Bordeaux in the semi-finals, which inserted PSG into the final. After scoring his first goal in the 22nd minute, Ronaldinho capped {{the game in the}} 81st minute, accurately chipping the ball at the 18-yard box over the head of goalkeeper Ulrich Ramé, despite Ramé being in a favorable position. For his performance, Ronaldinho was given a standing ovation by the Parisian supporters. Unfortunately for the club, however, Ronaldinho and the team failed to capture the form that <b>got</b> <b>them</b> <b>to</b> the final as they bowed out 2–1 to Auxerre due to a last minute goal from Jean-Alain Boumsong. Despite Ronaldinho's performances, the club finished in a disappointing 11th-placed position. Following the season, Ronaldinho declared he wanted to leave the club after the capital club failed to qualify for any European competition.|$|E
25|$|Those aboard Collapsible B {{suffered}} greatly {{during the}} night. The boat gradually sank lower {{into the water}} as the air pocket underneath it leaked away. The sea began to get up towards dawn, causing the boat to rock in the swell and lose more of its precious air. Lightoller organised {{the men on the}} hull to stand in two parallel rows {{on either side of the}} centreline, facing the bow, and <b>got</b> <b>them</b> <b>to</b> sway in unison to counteract the rocking motion caused by the swell. They were directly exposed to the freezing seawater, first up to their feet, then to their ankles and finally to their knees as the boat subsided in the water. For some, the ordeal proved too much and one by one they collapsed, fell into the water and died. The victims possibly included John George Phillips, the first radio officer, and the third class passenger David Livshin, whose body was taken to the Carpathia on the following morning. About 30 people were left alive by the morning and were transferred into other lifeboats before being rescued by Carpathia.|$|E

25|$|Bermuda made 224/9 (Hill 58, Manders 56), {{but despite}} no-one {{reaching}} 50 {{most of the}} USA team chipped in with useful runs and they won by three wickets with 16 balls to spare. 87 from Stearns and 80 from Myles helped Hong Kong to a good 261/7 against Canada, but a century opening partnership between Omadat Dipchand (76) and Prashad (40), plus 51 from IF Kirmani, <b>got</b> <b>them</b> <b>to</b> their target with four wickets and three balls remaining. Papua New Guinea obliterated Gibraltar by the little matter of 369 runs, amassing a Trophy record 455/9 (B Harry 127, Charles Amini 97, Api Leka 69, Renagi Ila 60 not out). De'Ath took five wickets, but his 12 overs cost 88 runs. In reply Gibraltar had no chance, subsiding to 86 all out with Maha taking 5-12 and G Ravu 4-16. Another lop-sided game saw the Netherlands put on 251 for the first wicket against Israel, Steve Atkinson making 162 and Lifmann 110. Gomes added 64 not out and Lubbers 50 as the Dutch closed on 425/4. D Moss made 62 and Stanley Perlman 51 for Israel as they reached 111/1, but that {{was as good as}} it got: Elferink ran through the order with 6-22 and they lost by 267 runs.|$|E

500|$|During an {{interview}} with British radio station XFM, Björk explained its recording process, saying work on [...] "Oceania" [...] was kept being delayed {{because she wanted to}} do it especially for the Olympics. During the last day of mixing, she thought she needed [...] "sirenes", like in Greek mythology. She called up an English choir to record these sounds. The singer had done an arrangement for piano on the computer that was impossible for a piano to play, and she <b>got</b> <b>them</b> <b>to</b> sing it. Then, she also called up beatboxer Shlomo, who was recommended to her as [...] "the new bright hope of the hip hop scene". He went to record the next day and Björk asked him to do a techno tango beat, which he did. Recalling her work on the song until her last day of mixing, she commented, [...] "That was the most fun part, in the end. Sometimes it's good for you to work with a gun against your head and just go for it, because you can sometimes sit too long with ideas. Sometimes adrenaline is a good thing." ...|$|E

500|$|On their seventy-second {{day on the}} island, Nikki and Paulo join Locke when he ventures back to the Pearl Station, {{hoping to}} {{communicate}} with the Others. Paulo returns to the toilet to retrieve the diamonds, storing them in his underwear thereafter. As they leave, the group witnesses Mr. Eko's death and burial not far from The Pearl. Eighty-one days after the crash, Nikki finds out about Paulo hiding the diamonds from her. Furious, she releases a venomous spider on him that causes Paulo to be paralyzed for the next eight hours. As he is entering the state of paralysis, Paulo admits he only kept the diamonds from her because he thought she would leave him after she <b>got</b> <b>them.</b> <b>To</b> Nikki's dismay, the death of the venomous spider only attracted more spiders which bite Nikki, so she is also temporarily paralyzed. The pair are mistaken for dead after being discovered by the survivors. Nikki and Paulo are then buried alive by James [...] "Sawyer" [...] Ford and Hugo [...] "Hurley" [...] Reyes after tossing the diamonds in the grave with them as they consider them to be of no value on the island. Much later, Miles Straume − a psychic who can read people's thoughts from their time of death − indicates he knows about the diamonds.|$|E
500|$|Epstein had {{no prior}} {{experience}} of artist management, {{yet he had}} a strong influence on the band's early dress code and stage demeanor. They had previously worn blue jeans and leather jackets, and they would stop and start songs when they felt like it or when an audience member requested a certain song. David Pomerran Szatmary states that when Epstein first saw them at The Cavern Club, he thought, [...] "They were a scruffy crowd in leather, {{and they were not}} very tidy and not very clean. They smoked as they played and they ate and talked and pretended to hit each other." [...] Epstein encouraged them to wear suits and ties, insisted that they stop swearing, smoking, drinking, or eating on stage, and also suggested the famous synchronised bow {{at the end of their}} performances. McCartney was the first to agree with Epstein's suggestions, believing that they reflected Epstein's RADA training. Epstein explained that the process from leather jackets and jeans to suits took some time: [...] "I encouraged them, at first, to get out of the leather jackets and jeans, and I wouldn't allow them to appear in jeans after a short time, and then, after that step, I <b>got</b> <b>them</b> <b>to</b> wear sweaters on stage, and then, very reluctantly, eventually, suits." [...] Epstein took the group to Wirral to see his friend, master tailor Beno Dorn, who made them their first suits based on a design they had previously seen, but which Epstein approved of: [...] "I thought it was an excellent design at the time." ...|$|E

Birmingham-Southern's lone chance to score was off an interception in the third quarter which <b>got</b> <b>them</b> <b>to</b> Vanderbilt's 10-yard line. The Commodores used substitutes throughout the second half.|$|E

A 1998 remix album, Becoming Remixed, also followed.|$|R
2500|$|Although Epstein had had {{no prior}} {{experience}} of artist management, {{he made it clear}} that he wanted to change the Beatles’ early dress-code and attitude on stage, as they wore blue jeans and leather jackets, smoked, ate and swore, stopped and started songs when they felt like it, pretended to hit each other, and turned their backs to the audience. Epstein put a stop to their behaviour, insisting they wear more suitable clothes, and later suggested the famous synchronised bow at the end of their performances. Epstein: [...] "I encouraged them, at first, to get out of the leather jackets and jeans, and I wouldn't allow them to appear in jeans after a short time, and then, after that step, I <b>got</b> <b>them</b> <b>to</b> wear sweaters on stage, and then, very reluctantly, eventually, suits".|$|E
2500|$|At {{the same}} time Curtis {{produced}} recordings of Paul and Barry Ryan for their stepfather, Harold Davidson. Graham Nash {{had given him the}} song [...] "Have You Ever Loved Somebody?" [...] and he <b>got</b> <b>them</b> <b>to</b> sing it backed by Ten Feet, a Welsh group whom he was also producing. Pye Records asked Curtis to delay the release of the Ryans' version so that the Searchers could release it. Curtis did not want to help his old band, however, {{and with the help of}} Harold Davidson the Ryans released the single in the week of 12 September 1966 and played it on 'Ready, Steady, Go' on 7 October. Curtis also wrote [...] "Night Time" [...] for the Ryans with his friend Sharon Sheeley and they collaborated on several other songs.|$|E

2500|$|The {{popular press}} {{had a field}} day with the story, {{employing}} crude racial stereotypes and presenting Chang as the head of an international drugs operation that recruited unwitting girls to act as agents, <b>got</b> <b>them</b> <b>to</b> smuggle drugs from Paris to London in their underwear, and organised wild orgies. The American press dubbed Chang the [...] "Limehouse Spider" [...] and depicted him at the centre of a web of his unfortunate victims together with a half-length portrait that bore no resemblance to Chang. The image was repeated in coverage across the U.S. The Payne case, however, was the only offence for which Chang was convicted in Britain. There was a fall in the number of drug convictions in Britain in the years following Chang's jailing, but that may be attributable to increased police activity following national publicity about the issue. It seems most likely that Chang's operation was limited to supplying young women he met in London, and that he was not the international Drug King that he was made out to be.|$|E
2500|$|The game {{engine of}} DOA5 was built from scratch. To better balance the {{fighting}} system, Team Ninja decided to re-examine {{each of the}} characters, creating new moves from scratch when needed and carefully refining others. According to Hayashi, the entire project's main concept was a decision to change direction and {{to focus on the}} characters' presence instead of on their beauty as in the previous games. They aimed to retain the characters' personalities and characteristics but to make them more lifelike and appealing for the players. In October 2011, the series' official Facebook page announced a contest inviting fans to create and submit their own fighting moves, some of which would be used in DOA5 and their creators would have their names displayed in the game's credits. Regarding an introduction of playable guest characters from the Virtua Fighter series, the characters' key animations were provided by Sega and Team Ninja created some more while working to implement them into the Dead or Alive gameplay system, which uses similar controls but features a different kind of matches. Hayashi said Team Ninja stayed in [...] "very close" [...] communication with Sega AM2: [...] "We got their guidance and feedback, we <b>got</b> <b>them</b> <b>to</b> check for everything we were doing with the characters." [...] Hasayshi also said that he aimed to develop a crossover game {{in a manner similar to}} Street Fighter X Tekken and that he chose Virtua Fighter because it was [...] "the father of 3D gaming", and also the first 3D game that he played and the IP he personally respects most.|$|E
