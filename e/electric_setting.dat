Responding to the fusion revolution, Earland plays keyboards and various synthesizers {{in addition to his}} usual Hammond B-3 organ and thrives in a very <b>electric</b> <b>setting...</b> he leaves no doubt just how much he's enjoying this surprising change of pace".|$|E

To obtain {{calculation}} {{correlations for}} active resistance Rce and maximal temperature Tme of plasma channel of pulse electric arc {{in the air}} double-electrode system (DES) with metal (graphite) electrodes, and also practical approbation of the obtained correlations for Rce and Tme in the conditions of high-voltage laboratory on the powerful capacity energy storage (CES) of <b>electric</b> <b>setting,</b> intended for reproducing on the electric loading of protracted C- component of current of artificial lightning with the USA rationed on normative documents by amplitude-temporal parameters (ATP). Methodology. Electrophysics bases of high-voltage impulse technique, scientific and technical bases of development and creation of high-voltage high-current impulse electrical equipment, including powerful CES, and also measuring methods in discharge circuits of powerful high-voltage CES of pulse currents of millisecond temporal range. Results. On the basis of engineering approach the new results of approximate calculation of values of Rce and Tme are resulted in the plasma channel of pulse electric arc discharge in air DES of atmospheric pressure with metallic (graphite) electrodes. Practical approbation of results of calculation of values of Rce and Tme is executed {{as it applies to}} air DES, to connected in a discharge circuit of powerful high-voltage CES with protracted C- of component current of artificial lightning, characterized rationed ATP. It is shown that calculation of numeral value Rce approximately in 100 times exceeds the proper value of active resistance for the plasma channel of impulsive spark of electric discharge in air DES other things being equal, and a calculation of numeral value Tme well corresponds with the known thermodynamics information for classic electric arc in air DES of atmospheric pressure with graphite electrodes. Originality. New engineering approach is developed for the approximate calculation of values of Rce and Tme in electron-ion plasma of channel of pulse electric arc, arising in air DES of high-current discharge circuit of powerful high-voltage CES of proof-of-concept of <b>electric</b> <b>setting</b> of the technological setting. A formula is first obtained for the approximate calculation of equivalent active resistance of Rce of channel of pulse electric arc in air DES, remaining unchanging in the process of high-current discharge on RL- load of indicated CES. Practical value. Drawing on the got calculation results for the values of Rce and Tme in high-voltage impulse technique provides the rational choice of own electric parameters and construction elements of basic devices of powerful high-voltage CES of technological of <b>electric</b> <b>setting,</b> and also account of influence of electrical engineering descriptions of air DES on electromagnetic processes, taking place in the high-current discharge circuit of indicated CES with protracted C- of component current of artificial lightning...|$|E
