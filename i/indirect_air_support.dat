50|$|The {{directives}} {{issued to}} the Luftwaffe for the Polish Campaign were {{to prevent the}} Polish Air Force from influencing the ground battles or attacking German territory. In addition, it was to support the advance of German ground forces through direct tactical and <b>indirect</b> <b>air</b> <b>support</b> with attacks against Polish mobilisation centres and thus delay an orderly Polish strategic concentration of forces and to deny mobility for Polish reinforcements through the destruction of strategic Polish rail routes.|$|E

After final fitting out, she sailed on 22 January in Task Group 52.9 (TG 52.9) and arrived in the vicinity of Kwajalein on 31 January, two days after planes of the Fast Carrier Task Force began pounding airfields on the atoll. She provided direct and <b>indirect</b> <b>air</b> <b>support</b> for the amphibious landings.

500|$|Kowang-San {{would be}} {{assaulted}} {{during the first}} phase by 1 KOSB with 1 KSLI and 3 RAR in support, while Maryang San would be taken in the third phase of the operation by 3 RAR and the 1st Battalion, Royal Northumberland Fusiliers (1 RNF), who were under commander from 29th Brigade {{for the duration of}} Operation Commando. Careful reconnaissance and planning took place in the week prior to the commencement of the operation and Taylor emphasised the use of <b>indirect</b> fires, <b>air</b> <b>support</b> and infiltration tactics to limit casualties, as well as the exploitation of weak points in the Chinese defences. In direct support of the brigade was 16th Field Regiment, Royal New Zealand Artillery with its [...] 25-pounder field guns, in addition to divisional and corps assets which included [...] mortars, [...] howitzers and [...] heavy artillery; in total more than 120 guns and mortars.

5000|$|... 2-7 Cavalry marched towards LZ Albany in a column, with 1-5’s A Company {{bringing}} up the rear. Almost immediately after reaching the LZ, {{the head of the}} 2-7 Cavalry column was engaged by a massive L-shaped ambush staged by two battalions of enemy fighters. The ensuing close-quarters battle was fierce and bloody, with both sides taking devastating casualties. After the initial chaos subsided, hasty security perimeters were formed, with 2-7 Cavalry hunkered down on LZ Albany, while A Company 1-5 Cavalry set a small perimeter 700 meters away. The situation was dire for the Soldiers at LZ Albany. They were low on ammunition and water, and the intense fire and close proximity of the enemy disrupted resupply and casualty evacuation efforts, as well as <b>indirect</b> fire and <b>air</b> <b>support.</b>|$|R

Deep <b>air</b> <b>support</b> or <b>air</b> interdiction is carried out further from the active fighting, based more on strategic planning and less directly coordinated with ground units.
