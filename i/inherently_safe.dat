40|$|Abstract. Inherent {{safety concept}} has been {{introduced}} to overcome the shortcoming of traditional hazard assessments by allowing modification to be made at any stage of lifecycle of a process plant. However, most of the proposed inherent safety modifications were suitable to prevent fire, explosion and toxic hazards assessment but less attention on human and organizational factor. Therefore, this paper introduces the <b>inherently</b> <b>safer</b> analysis for human and organizational factor to be implemented during design stage or process operation. Analytic Hierarchy Process model integrated with fuzzy logic and known as FAHP was employed to rank identified <b>inherently</b> <b>safer</b> strategies. The model was applied to select <b>inherently</b> <b>safer</b> strategies to reduce collision risk of a floating production, storage and offload and the authorized vessel. The result shows that minimization of hazardous procedure when the procedure is unavoidable is the best strategy to increase human performance. It is proven that the proposed methodology is capable to select the <b>inherently</b> <b>safer</b> strategy without requiring a bunch of precise information to transfer expert judgment in human performance’s perspective...|$|R

2500|$|The {{majority}} of modern heating/cooling/heat pump thermostats operate on low voltage (typically 24 volts AC) control circuits. The {{source of the}} 24 volt AC power is a control transformer installed {{as part of the}} heating/cooling equipment. The advantage of the low voltage control system is the ability to operate multiple electromechanical switching devices such as relays, contactors, and sequencers using <b>inherently</b> <b>safe</b> voltage and current levels. Built into the thermostat is a provision for enhanced temperature control using anticipation. [...] A heat anticipator generates a small amount of additional heat to the sensing element while the heating appliance is operating. [...] This opens the heating contacts slightly early to prevent the space temperature from greatly overshooting the thermostat setting. [...] A mechanical heat anticipator is generally adjustable and should be set to the current flowing in the heating control circuit when the system is operating. A cooling anticipator generates a small amount of additional heat to the sensing element while the cooling appliance is not operating. This causes the contacts to energize the cooling equipment slightly early, preventing the space temperature from climbing excessively. Cooling anticipators are generally non-adjustable.|$|E
2500|$|The RBMK {{design was}} built {{primarily}} to be powerful, quick {{to build and}} easy to maintain. Full physical containment structures for each reactor would {{have more than doubled}} the cost and construction time of each plant, and since the design had been certified by the Soviet nuclear science ministry as <b>inherently</b> <b>safe</b> when operated within established parameters the Soviet authorities assumed proper adherence to doctrine by workers would make any accident impossible. Additionally, RBMK reactors were designed to allow fuel rods to be changed without shutting down (as in the pressurized heavy water CANDU reactor), both for refueling and for plutonium production (for nuclear weapons). This required large cranes above the core. As the RBMK reactor is very tall (about [...] ), the cost and difficulty of building a heavy containment structure prevented the building of additional emergency containment structures for pipes on top of the reactor. In the Chernobyl accident, the pressure rose to levels high enough to blow the top off the reactor, breaking open the fuel channels in the process and starting a massive fire when air contacted the superheated graphite core. After the Chernobyl accident, some RBMK reactors were retrofitted with a partial containment structure (in lieu of a full containment building), which surround the fuel channels with water jackets in order to capture any radioactive particles released.|$|E

However, failures of these systems do occur on occasion, and these failures can result in major accidents. In recent years there has been an increased effort to develop <b>inherently</b> <b>safer</b> chemical processes, focusing on changing the process to eliminate the hazard, rather than on accepting the hazard and developing “add-on ” design features to control it.

When the process features planned changes in feedstock and products, scheduling {{is often used}} to optimize process operation. The objective of this dissertation is to develop a new approach to design and scheduling with economic, environmental, heat integration and <b>inherently</b> <b>safer</b> design objectives. Specifically, this work introduces a systematic framework and the associated mathematical formulation for simultaneous process design and scheduling while simultaneously addressing economic, environmental, heat integration and <b>inherently</b> <b>safer</b> design objectives. Therefore, more than one type of proper tradeoffs are established between these objectives. The environmental issues pertaining to the parameterized process retrofitting, scheduling, and operation strategies are simultaneously considered along with the environmental impact of these changes. Similarly, the design synthesis of heat-exchange networks (HENs) is addressed in the context of optimizing energy consumption under scheduling scenarios. Finally, the goal of <b>inherently</b> <b>safer</b> design is simultaneously considered with the expected schedules of the process. Several optimization formulations are developed for the projected schedules while allowing design modifications and retrofitting changes. The modifications and changes include new environmental management units, synthesis of flexible and optimal HENs, and design of an <b>inherently</b> <b>safer</b> process. Process models with the appropriate level of relevant details are included in the formulations. A discretization approach has been adopted to allow for a multiperiod optimization formulation over a given time horizon. The resulting framework identifies opportunities for synergism between the economic, environmental, heat integration and <b>inherently</b> <b>safer</b> design objectives. It also determines points of diminishing return beyond which tradeoffs between the above mentioned objectives are established. The devised procedure is illustrated with case studies...|$|R

2500|$|In 1946, Chief of Naval Operations Admiral Chester Nimitz {{ordered the}} {{formation}} of a flight exhibition team to boost Navy morale, demonstrate naval air power, and maintain public interest in naval aviation. However, an underlying mission was to help the Navy generate public and political support for a larger allocation of the shrinking defense budget. Another reason was to show potential recruits that aviation was <b>inherently</b> <b>safe</b> once pilots were trained. Being able to perform 3-dimensional close proximity maneuvering would also be awe inspiring. In April of that year, Rear Admiral Ralph Davison personally selected Voris to assemble and train a flight demonstration squadron, naming him Officer-in-Charge and Flight Leader. Voris selected two fellow instructors to join him (Lt. Maurice [...] "Wick" [...] Wickendoll and Lt. Mel Cassidy, both veterans of the War in the Pacific), and the three spent countless hours developing the show. The group perfected their initial maneuvers in secret over the Florida Everglades so that, in Voris' words, [...] "...if anything happened, just the alligators would know." [...] Another significant driving factor for Voris (and the secrecy) was the fact that Army Air Corps aeronautical genius, hero and legend, Jimmy Doolittle, now a general in the newly created U.S. Air Force, might just create a similar aerial demonstration team and beat the Navy in going public. Their first demonstration before Navy officials took place on May 10, 1946 and was met with enthusiastic approval.|$|E

The second is that because inherent safety is an intrinsic feature of the design, it is best implemented early in the design of a process plant, while the US has a huge base of installed process plants and little new construction.

40|$|Incorporating {{consideration}} for safety issues while designing solvent processes has become crucial {{in light of}} the chemical process incidents involving solvents that have taken place in recent years. The implementation of <b>inherently</b> <b>safer</b> design concepts is considered beneficial to avoid hazards during early stages of design. The application of existing process design and modeling techniques that aid the concepts of ?substitution?, ?intensification? and ?attenuation? has been shown in this work. For ?substitution?, computer aided molecular design (CAMD) technique has been applied to select <b>inherently</b> <b>safer</b> solvents for a solvent operation. For ?intensification? and ?attenuation?, consequence models and regulatory guidance from EPA RMP have been integrated into process simulation. Combining existing techniques provides a design team with a higher level of information to make decisions based on process safety. CAMD is a methodology used for designing compounds with desired target properties. An important aspect of this methodology concerns the prediction of properties given the structure of the molecule. This work also investigates the applicability of Quantitative Structure Property Relationship (QSPR) and topological indices to CAMD. The evaluation was based on models developed to predict flash point properties of different classes of solvents. Multiple linear regression and neural network analysis were used to develop QSPR models, but there are certain limitations associated with using QSPR in CAMD which have been discussed and need further work. Practical application of molecular design and process design techniques have been demonstrated in a case study on liquid-liquid extraction of acetic acid-water mixture. Suitable <b>inherently</b> <b>safer</b> solvents were identified using ICAS-ProCAMD, and consequence models were integrated into Aspen Plus simulator using a calculator sheet. Upon integrating flammable and toxic hazard modeling, solvents such as 5 -nonanone, 2 -nonanone and 5 -methyl- 2 -hexanone provide <b>inherently</b> <b>safer</b> options, while conventionally-used solvent, ethyl acetate, provides higher degree of separation capability. A conclusive decision regarding feasible solvents and operating conditions would depend on design requirements, regulatory guidance, and safety criteria specified for the process.

40|$|An <b>inherently</b> <b>safer</b> {{design is}} one that avoids hazards instead of {{controlling}} them, particularly by {{reducing the amount of}} hazardous material and the number of hazardous operations in the plant. Methods developed to date have largely been for the evaluating the safety of a proposed design. In the future the emphasis will be more and more on the synthesis of an <b>inherently</b> <b>safer</b> plant. At the moment it seems that the best practice is not adopted quickly enough by the potential practitioners. The aim of this work is to try to reduce this hinder by presenting an improved method for <b>inherently</b> <b>safer</b> design. In this thesis an Inherent Safety Index for conceptual chemical process design is presented. This is required, since inherent safety should be considered in the early phases of design when the major decisions on the chemical process are made. The presented methodology allows such a consideration since the index is based on the knowledge available in the preliminary process design stage. The total index is divided into Chemical and Process Inherent Safety Index. The previous is formed of subindices for reaction heats, flammability, explosiveness, toxicity, corrosiveness and chemical interaction. The latter is formed of subindices for inventory, process temperature, pressure and the safety of equipment and process structure. The equipment safety subindex was developed based on accident statistics and layout data separately for isbl and osbl areas. The subindex for process structure describes the safety from the system engineering's point of view. It is evaluated by case-based reasoning on a database of good and bad design cases i. e. experience based information on recommended process configurations and accident data. This allows the reuse of existing design experience for the design of new plants, which is often neglected. A new approach for computerized Inherent Safety Index is also presented. The index is used for the synthesis of <b>inherently</b> <b>safer</b> processes by using the index as a fitness function in the optimization of the process structure by an algorithm that is based on the combination of an genetic algorithm and case-based reasoning.
