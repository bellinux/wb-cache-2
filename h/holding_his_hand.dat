5|$|Unable to find Bruckman in the hotel, Mulder and Scully {{return to}} Bruckman's {{apartment}} {{to find that}} Bruckman has committed suicide; Scully sees a plastic bag has been tied around his head, {{and that he is}} clutching a bottle of pills in his hand. Scully sits on Bruckman's bed <b>holding</b> <b>his</b> <b>hand,</b> deeply moved, just as he had predicted. That night Scully sees a commercial for the Stupendous Yappi on TV, causing her to throw her phone at it.|$|E
5|$|Dwight Schrute (Rainn Wilson) offers free family {{portraits in}} the office, and {{many members of}} the office take {{advantage}} of the opportunity, including Creed Bratton (Creed Bratton) with his very elderly parents, Toby Flenderson (Paul Lieberstein) with his teenaged daughter Sasha, Meredith Palmer (Kate Flannery) with her teenaged son, Kelly Kapoor (Mindy Kaling) with Ravi (Sendhil Ramamurthy), a desperate Ryan Howard (B. J. Novak) trying to win back Kelly's affection yet again, and Pam Halpert (Jenna Fischer) with a reluctant Jim (John Krasinski) and their children Cecelia and Philip. Senator Robert Lipton (Jack Coleman) later comes by with his and Angela Martin's (Angela Kinsey) son Philip to also get a family portrait. Jim suspects that Dwight's motive for giving away family portraits was to get revenge on Jim for a prank involving a fake Velcro suit, but Dwight's real motive was to try to get some of Philip Lipton's DNA to run a test to determine who Philip's actual father is. Angela is very much against this idea and tries to ensure that Dwight does not get the opportunity. After taking the pictures, Robert notices that Philip's diaper is full, so he goes to change him. After doing so Dwight goes into the bathroom to retrieve the diaper, but Angela chases after him as he makes a break for the hospital to run the DNA test. Dwight and Angela then take part in a high-speed car chase until Dwight calls his cousin Mose (Michael Schur) to take her off his trail with a duplicate Trans Am. Angela later finds him in the hospital waiting area, where he confirms {{he is going to be}} there for the entire 72-hour waiting period for the DNA results. After she sits down, <b>holding</b> <b>his</b> <b>hand,</b> Dwight begins kissing her and Angela briefly demurs before passionately kissing him in return.|$|E
25|$|Chesney {{started his}} Poets and Pirates Tour on April 26, 2008 at Williams-Brice Stadium in Columbia, South Carolina. During the {{introduction}} of his set, his boot got caught between a hydraulic lift and {{the lip of the}} stage surface, which crushed his foot and produced a severe hematoma from the ankle down, with most of the damage centering within his toes. It took approximately 30seconds to pry his foot loose as he squatted down on the stage while the band continued to play an extended introduction of the song. When Chesney finally freed himself, he stood up and kept <b>holding</b> <b>his</b> <b>hand</b> on his knee as he began singing.|$|E

500|$|Christopher Cooper, head of Cavity Search Records (which {{released}} Roman Candle), {{said about}} this time in Smith's life, [...] "I talked him out of thinking {{that he wanted to}} kill himself numerous times when he was in Portland. I kept telling him that he was a brilliant man, and that life was worth living, and that people loved him." [...] Pete Krebs also agreed: [...] "In Portland we got the brunt of Elliott's initial depression... Lots of people have stories of their own experiences of staying up with Elliott 'til five in the morning, <b>holding</b> <b>his</b> <b>hand,</b> telling him not to kill himself." ...|$|E
500|$|Several months {{pass with}} no contact between Anna and the King. [...] Anna is packed {{and ready to}} board a ship leaving Siam. [...] Chulalongkorn arrives with {{a letter from the}} King, who has been unable to resolve the {{conflicts}} within himself and is dying. [...] Anna hurries to the King's bedside and they reconcile. [...] The King persuades her to take back the ring and to stay and assist the next king, Chulalongkorn. [...] The dying man tells Anna to take dictation from the prince, and instructs the boy to give orders as if he were King. [...] The prince orders the end of the custom of kowtowing that Anna hated. [...] The King grudgingly accepts this decision. [...] As Chulalongkorn continues, prescribing a less arduous bow to show respect for the king, his father dies. [...] Anna kneels by the late King, <b>holding</b> <b>his</b> <b>hand</b> and kissing it, as the wives and children bow or curtsey, a gesture of respect to old king and new.|$|E
500|$|The {{hold that}} the {{darkness}} has over her does not disappear when she escapes and the Tombs are brought {{down in an}} earthquake by the nameless ones. She contemplates killing Ged, blaming him for her pain, but eventually learns to accept her guilt over her actions, realizing that though {{she had no choice}} in her actions as a priestess, she now has a choice to move away from them; but this [...] "freedom is a heavy load". Le Guin ends the novel with the reassuring sentence [...] "Gravely she walked beside [...] up the white streets of Havnor, <b>holding</b> <b>his</b> <b>hand,</b> like a child coming home", suggesting that she has been successful in finding new connections in her life. The conclusion of the novel represents the successful end of a quest that Ged undertook as a mature wizard, part of the story arc that traces his character development across the first three Earthsea books; thus The Tombs of Atuan has been described as part of Ged's coming-of-age as well.|$|E

500|$|... "Subway" [...] {{was shot}} by Alex Zakrzewski, the series' regular {{director}} of photography. The episode was staged so that Pembleton is initially keeping his distance from Lange, but gradually moves closer and closer as they begin to bond, {{and by the end}} is sitting next to him and <b>holding</b> <b>his</b> <b>hand.</b> Accordingly, the initial scenes included wider shots with Braugher and D'Onofrio on the outer edges of the frame, but later scenes included more close-ups of the two sitting together. Although Homicide: Life on the Street typically employs a number of back-and-forth whip pan-style cuts, Fleder asked that the style be modified for this episode. In earlier scenes, Fleder asked for wider long shots {{to create a sense of}} setting within the subway station, and as the episode progressed and the story became more intense, he then allowed more close-ups and whip pans. This led to disagreements on the set between Fleder and Zakrzewski, who felt Fleder was trying to being too disruptive and difficult. Fleder said of his behavior, [...] "I have to admit, I'm not the most charming guy on the set. I'm just not. When I'm on the set, I'm very focused and my humor goes away and I become not so charming." [...] After the episode was complete, Fleder said that he and Zakrzewski settled their differences and were both happy with the final result.|$|E
500|$|The [...] "enhanced" [...] video {{states that}} there are 724 {{references}} to Twin Peaks in the episode's closing scene. Among them, Jack Smith wears an eye patch and a red suit and dances funny, referencing not only the aforementioned [...] "One Eyes Jacks" [...] brothel and Nadine Hurley, but a dream sequence in Peaks, where a character known as the Man from Another Place wore a similar suit and danced in a bizarre fashion. In the final scene Carlton is seen <b>holding</b> <b>his</b> <b>hand</b> up and stating [...] "that is a damn fine cup of cider". In the Twin Peaks pilot Agent Cooper holds his hand {{the same way and}} states [...] "that is a damn fine cup of coffee." [...] Additionally, Carlton is later holding a cup of coffee on its side, displaying that the coffee is now solid in a fashion mimicking the same action by Agent Cooper in the final episode. A seven-foot tall man (John DeSantis) wearing a bow tie looks much like the giant from Agent Cooper's dream. Randy is seen at the end barking out the window like Bobby Briggs did to James Hurley in the holding cells. Bob Barker is seen dancing with a picture just as Leland Palmer did in Twin Peaks. The episode's end credits are accompanied by soap opera-type music and a shot of Paula's prom picture; Twin Peaks credits did exactly the same thing with Laura's photo.|$|E

2500|$|Jason is alive, {{and held}} captive by Victor Cassadine (Thaao Penghlis). Victor forces Robin to revive Jason, {{but the two}} escape Victor's {{clutches}} {{and come back to}} Port Charles. Jason is hit by a car, though, and has to undergo a complete facial reconstruction. Jason's vitals spike while Sam is <b>holding</b> <b>his</b> <b>hand,</b> even though he is under heavy sedation. Jason (Billy Miller) awakens with amnesia, and starts going by [...] "Jake". He bonds with both Sam and Danny, who feel drawn to him while he's unconscious. Though he wakes up with no memory, he's under Helena Cassadine's (Constance Towers) mind control, and holds Sam hostage while freeing a prisoner. Sam suspects Jake, but he denies the accusation. Helena orders him to kill Sam, but [...] "Jake's" [...] unable to fulfill this order. When [...] "Jake" [...] is eventually arrested, Sam helps him break Helena's mind control, and remember what he had done. [...] "Jake" [...] asks Sam for help to figure out who he is. [...] "Jake" [...] has obscure dreams about his past, specifically of Sam and Danny. He starts a relationship with Elizabeth, while Sam dates Patrick Drake (Jason Thompson). When Hayden Barnes (Rebecca Budig), who knew his true identity, is shot, Sam and Jake stop their investigation. On their wedding anniversary, Sam and [...] "Jake" [...] unknowingly renew their vows.|$|E
2500|$|The {{storming}} of Lankaran by the Russians began {{long before}} dawn, at 5 in the morning. The above-mentioned columns {{moved in the}} deepest silence, but the Persians were alerted and opened heavy fire from all guns and rifles. However, columns crossed the ditch quickly and soldiers, after putting up a ladder, climbed {{up on the wall}} towards the exposed peaks and started throwing grenades down. In the first series of losses, almost all officers were killed or wounded. The 1st column saw the death of Lieutenant Colonel Ushakov, as he hesitated for a time. Kotlyarevsky afterwards, despite having gained a leg injury, stood over the body of Ushakov and while <b>holding</b> <b>his</b> <b>hand,</b> ordered: Here to me! — And personally threw himself into the assault, but he soon received two bullet wounds in the head and rolled into the ditch. The Russian soldiers, deprived of their commanders, still continued the attack. Azerbaijani educator and teacher Teymur Bey Bajram Alibayov described these events as followed: [...] Meanwhile, the columns storming the fortress were significantly thinned out, as the walls were continuously replinished with new defenders. A company of grenadiers managed to climb the wall and grabbed a weapon which they immediately turned and fired buckshot at the enemy inside. This facilitated the attack of the other two columns, which also managed to climb the wall and to the sides, overturning the enemy. Subsequently as a significant number of Russians managed to get inside the fortress, a brutal melee happened between the attackers and the defenders. The Persian historian Rovzet-ul Safa described these events: ...|$|E
