40|$|In this study, new {{analytic}} {{models are}} proposed for mapping on-site {{global solar radiation}} values to electrical power output values in solar photovoltaic (PV) panels. The model extraction is achieved by simultaneously recording solar radiation and generated power from fixed and tracking panels, each with capacity of 3 kW, in Eskisehir (Turkey) region. It is shown that {{the relation between the}} solar radiation and the corresponding electric power is not only nonlinear, but it also exhibits an interesting time-varying characteristic {{in the form of a}} hysteresis function. This observed radiation-to-power relation is, then, analytically modelled with three piece-wise <b>function</b> <b>parts</b> (corresponding to morning, noon and evening times), which is another novel contribution of this work. The model is determined for both fixed panels and panels with a tracking system. Especially the panel system with a dynamic tracker produces a harmonically richer (with higher values in general) characteristic, so higher order polynomial models are necessary for the construction of analytical solar radiation models. The presented models, characteristics of the hysteresis functions, and differences in the fixed versus solar-tracking panels are expected to provide valuable insight for further model based researches...|$|E

But KNX system is only one standardized system in the world and therefore also the most extended system. The reason of it is in its specialization to control of all functions, which are needed to ensure the best internal conditions for people, not only in small, but in the biggest buildings too. KNX system cooperate without any problems with many other partial systems specialized to regulation of special <b>function</b> <b>parts</b> e. g. air-conditioning, ventilation etc. Because KNX is an open system, it cooperates with the other open systems, and there is possible to reach minimally energy consumption in whole building, but there is not influenced the comfort in all rooms of building. The consumption of all types of energy in every room is only according to instantaneous conditions required with persons. If is nobody there, the consumption is automatically limited. The result of cooperation of all components of KNX installation is energy saving in the range between of 30 % to 60 %, depending of level of supply with KNX...|$|E

40|$|Objective Recurrent {{malignant}} gliomas often violate important neurological <b>function</b> <b>parts</b> or {{deep brain}} structures due to tumor invasion, further increasing {{the difficulty of}} reoperation and treatment. Therefore, how to develop a reasonable treatment strategy, maximize {{the removal of the}} tumor, and ensure a basic quality of life of the patient, is nowadays hotly debated by scholars from various countries. This article aims to explore the reasonable treatment and optimal surgical strategy of recurrent malignant gliomas. Methods Four cases of recurrent malignant glioma were collceted. A comprehensive assessment on preoperative imaging, intraoperative operation, postoperative complications and long-term follow-up was made, and treatment strategy was elaborated. Results Postoperative MRI in 2 cases showed the recurrent tumors located in remnant edema parts, which were revealed by T 2 WI after first resections. One case underwent expanded resection of edema parts according to T 2 WI. This patient suffered short-sensory aphasia and weakness of right limbs, but recovered by improving cerebral circulation, hyperbaric oxygen, auxiliary acupuncture and physical rehabilitation trainings. One case with brainstem glioma underwent precise resection by laser knife, without postoperative neurological disorders. All the 4 cases received postoperative chemotherapy with TMZ (200 mg/kg, 5 d/ 28 d). The average follow-up period was (14. 00 ± 12. 50) months. Conclusion For obvious recurrence of malignant glioma, reoperation is still the key factor to lengthen the survival of patients, and expanded resection of the edema area supplemented by T 2 WI can reduce recurrence. Under the precondition of maintaining the basic postoperative quality of life of patients (KPS > 70), expanded resection should be used. As for tumors adjacent to the eloquent areas, precise engraving resection should be used to minimize residual tumor cells...|$|E
40|$|Urban {{design is}} a subject that is {{concerned}} with the shape, the surface and its physical arrangement of all kinds of urban elements. Although urban design is a practice process needs much detailed and multi-dimensional description, however the urban designer can only analyse urban space with script and imagination in the past, and only the urban design guideline and some drawing picture were carried out in the traditional design schema. How {{to improve the quality of}} urban space effectually and to express the design schema perfectly are the problems troubling the urban designer for a long time. The 3 D city models based spatial analysis gives the possibility of solving these problems. Comparing with the traditional applications of 2 D GIS in urban plan, the 3 D city models based 3 D spatial analysis would be more meaningful for the urban designer. The computable analysis models could be constructed under the urban design guideline. Through the integration of analytical models and realistic visualization models, the 3 D spatial analysis that is impossible to the 2 D GIS can be carried out. Instead to be described with some adjective words, the designing schema and rules can be presented and analyzed in 3 D virtual environment. The change of the urban fabric and the building density could be analyzed through the structure analysis. The noise environment, sunshine condition, heat environment, ventilation condition, and pollution condition could be analyzed through the physical quality analysis.
