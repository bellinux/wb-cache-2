30|$|The {{principal}} {{advantage of}} combined joints is {{the improvement of}} energy capacity or work until the failure in comparison with single-use of the <b>joint</b> <b>component</b> that precedes bearing applied loads. The energy capacity of the combined joints designed effectively can be more than 90 % to the simple summation of the energy capacity of both <b>joint</b> <b>components</b> loaded alone as the test result of this study shows.|$|R
30|$|The {{second and}} third {{advantages}} indicate that the combined joints designed effectively will have higher performance to survive under strong earthquakes, even though these advantages are considered less or almost nothing in evaluating allowable or serviceability limit resistance following the current design standard. The effective allowable resistance of combined joints with different kinds of fasteners is principally dependent on two components: ductility of <b>joint</b> <b>components</b> and characteristic initial slips of <b>joint</b> <b>components.</b>|$|R

40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{the composition of}} a planar mechanical library for the simulation tool AMESim. This library is composed of 5 body components: one fixed to the frame of reference and the four others corresponding to moving bodies with one to four connecting ports. These body components may be connected {{to any of the}} <b>joint</b> <b>components</b> defined in the library. There are four basic <b>joint</b> <b>components</b> for: (1) a translational joint, (2) a revolute joint, (3) a double translational joint, (4) a double translational-revolute joint. Actuated versions of the translational and revolute joints are also available. Two more <b>joint</b> <b>components</b> are also defined for coupling perpendicular motion planes. Finally four more specific components enable a linear actuator in planar motion, a spring-damper, a one dimension to two dimensions coupling and a given action to be modeled. The use of this planar mechanical library is illustrated using the example of a seven-body mechanism. (c) 2005 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved...|$|R

25|$|When a {{fastener}} is torqued, a tension preload develops in the bolt and an equal compressive preload develops in the parts being fastened. This can be modeled as a spring-like assembly {{that has some}} assumed distribution of compressive strain in the clamped <b>joint</b> <b>components.</b> When an external tension load is applied, it relieves the compressive strains induced by the preload in the clamped components, hence the preload acting on the compressed <b>joint</b> <b>components</b> provides the external tension load with a path (through the joint) other than through the bolt. In a well designed joint, perhaps 80-90% of the externally applied tension load will pass through the joint and the remainder through the bolt. This reduces the fatigue loading of the bolt.|$|R

30|$|The {{advantages}} of combining the <b>joint</b> <b>components,</b> however, are influenced obviously by various actual conditions; i.e. end and side margins, spacing, loading direction to the grain direction, length/diameter ratios of the fasteners, boundary {{conditions of the}} fastener heads and tips, and possible brittle behavior of a cluster of fasteners or an eccentric load distribution among the fasteners. Practically, it is too difficult to consider the variation of load-slip characteristics of the <b>joint</b> <b>components</b> depending on these conditions in detail in open design systems. The combined joints, therefore, should be designed under the restrictions of particular specifications based on the experimental load-slip data or substitutive analyses in closed design systems, or they should {{be used as a}} fail-safe joint-system against strong earthquakes expecting no advantage in general allowable resistance design.|$|R

30|$|An {{experimental}} study on combined steel-to-timber joints with nails and bolts is conducted in this study. Principal results are as follows: The initial stiffness and effective allowable resistance of combined joints depend obviously on clearances in predrilled bolt-holes. The combined joints with nails and bolts have high potential of energy capacity to resist strong earthquake forces. There are upper limits of clearances in predrilled bolt-holes that allow advantages of considering the synthetic resistance of combined joints in practical structural design. Combining the <b>joint</b> <b>components</b> with appropriate design will give higher performance against strong earthquakes increasing the safety margin and energy capacity until the failure. The combined joints {{should be designed}} under the restrictions of particular specifications in closed design systems because the advantages of combining the <b>joint</b> <b>components</b> are influenced obviously by various actual conditions, which are too difficult to consider in detail in open design systems.|$|R
