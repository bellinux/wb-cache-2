5000|$|<b>Hypobaric</b> {{chambers}} {{are also}} finding increasing {{use as a}} means of improving athletic performance. Since the human body adapts to extended mild hypoxia by increasing the quantity of red cells in the blood and this raises aerobic performance, athletes sleep in them as part of their training regimen. This has roughly the same effect as training in high altitudes, but the use of <b>hypobaric</b> chambers plays into the controversial issue of enhanced athletic performance. Mika LaVaque-Manty asks in his book, [...] "Are <b>hypobaric</b> chambers, which simulate high-altitude conditions, a natural way to improve your body?" [...] This hints that the <b>hypobaric</b> chambers use can be likened to blood doping and thus be deemed an unfair athletic advantage. This could lead to a ban on <b>hypobaric</b> chambers for athletic training.|$|E

50|$|Atmospheric hypoxia occurs {{naturally}} at high altitudes. Total {{atmospheric pressure}} decreases as altitude increases, causing a lower partial pressure of oxygen which {{is defined as}} <b>hypobaric</b> hypoxia. Oxygen remains at 20.9% of the total gas mixture, differing from hypoxic hypoxia, where the percentage of oxygen in the air (or blood) is decreased. This is common, for example, in the sealed burrows of some subterranean animals, such as blesmols. Atmospheric hypoxia is also the basis of altitude training which is a standard part of training for elite athletes. Several companies mimic hypoxia using normobaric artificial atmosphere.|$|E

This laboratory also supports the FAA and the National Transportation Safety Board in the collection and disposition of autopsy data resulting from aircraft accident investigations. Research facilities within these laboratories include a <b>hypobaric</b> test chamber, protective breathing equipment and water survival test facilities, a dynamic impact test facility, and aircraft evacuation/cabin environment simulators.|$|E
50|$|Decreased oxygen {{availability}} and decreased temperature make life at high altitude challenging. Despite these environmental conditions, many {{species have been}} successfully adapted at high altitudes. Animals have developed physiological adaptations to enhance oxygen uptake and delivery to tissues {{which can be used}} to sustain metabolism. The strategies used by animals to adapt to high altitude depend on their morphology and phylogeny. For example, small mammals face the challenge of maintaining body heat in cold temperatures, due to their small volume to surface area ratio. As oxygen is used as a source of metabolic heat production, the <b>hypobaric</b> hypoxia at high altitudes is problematic.|$|E
50|$|In {{an effort}} to {{consolidate}} the research effort in the military, DRET and CFIEM were amalgamated in April 1971 and a new organization was formed, the Defence and Civil Institute of Environmental Medicine.

Over the years many new unique facilities were developed at DCIEM, including a new human centrifuge, hot and cold climatic chambers, <b>hypobaric</b> (1954) and hyperbaric (1977) chambers, and impact studies facility (1978).|$|E

50|$|Additionally, {{cinnarizine}} {{can be used}} in scuba divers {{without an}} increased risk of central nervous system oxygen toxicity which can result in seizures, and is a high risk in closed-circuit oxygen diving. This is also relevant to divers who could potentially have to undergo <b>hypobaric</b> decompression therapy, which uses high oxygen pressure and could also be affected by any cinnarizine-induced CNS oxygen toxicity risk. However, cinnarizine does not heighten toxicity risk, and in fact, evidence even seems to suggest that cinnarizine may be beneficial in helping delay O2 toxicity in the central nervous system.There is also evidence that cinnarizine may be used as an effective anti-asthma medication when taken regularly.|$|E
50|$|The {{fundamental}} {{requirements for}} {{the control of the}} gas mixture in the breathing circuit for any rebreather application are that the carbon dioxide is removed, and kept at a tolerable level, and that the partial pressure of oxygen is kept within safe limits. For rebreathers which are used at normobaric or <b>hypobaric</b> pressures, this only requires that there is sufficient oxygen, which is easily achieved in an oxygen rebreather. Hyperbaric applications, as in diving, also require that the maximum partial pressure of oxygen is limited, to avoid oxygen toxicity, which is technically a more complex process, and may require dilution of the oxygen with metabolically inert gas.|$|E
50|$|Cyclic Variations in Adaptive Conditioning (CVAC) is {{a method}} of touch free cyclic <b>hypobaric</b> {{pneumatic}} compression for treatment of tissue edema and, therefore, edema-associated pain. As a pilot study, 10 participants with AD completed pain {{and quality of life}} questionnaires before and after 20-40 minutes of CVAC process daily for 5 days. After treatment, there was a significant decrease in pain as measured by the Pain Catastrophizing Scale and the Visual Analogue Scale, but there was no change in pain quality by the McGill Pain Questionnaire. However, there were no changes in the Pain Disability Index or Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index. This study suggests a potential treatment role for CVAC, and the authors recommended randomized controlled clinical trials.|$|E
