40|$|The {{use of an}} anion {{exchange}} membrane as an electrolyte allows to combine {{the benefits of the}} alkaline- and the polymer electrolyte membrane water electrolysis and simultaneously eliminates their limitations. The ionomers used in this so called {{anion exchange}} membrane water electrolysis usually contain quaternary amines as functional groups. These kind of ionomers provide a sufficiently high ionic conductivity for the elctrolysis operation. Hydroxide anions that are formed at the cathode however destroy those functional groups causing a subsequent loss in ionic conductivity and thus reduce the hydrogen production rate of the electrolyser. The aim of this work is a material screening of commercial and pre-commercial anion exchange membranes, ionomers and electro catalysts. The most suitable materials are chosen for the development of membrane <b>electrode</b> <b>assemblies</b> and characterised during water electrolysis operation. By selecting the membranes and ionomers and by optimizing the operational parameters, the chemical degradation of the functional groups of the ionomers is to be reduced. During water electrolysis operation, the membrane <b>electrode</b> <b>assemblies</b> should show the highest possible current densities. Furthermore, the electrode layers are designed without the use of precious metal catalysts. Based on anion exchange membranes, ionomers and electro catalysts that are available on the market to date, it is possible to build membrane <b>electrode</b> <b>assemblies</b> that reach a current density of 1. 4 A/cm 2 at 2. 1 V and 50 °C during electrolysis operation.

5000|$|Because of the {{methanol}} cross-over, {{a phenomenon}} by which methanol diffuses through the membrane without reacting, methanol is fed as a weak solution: this decreases efficiency significantly, since crossed-over methanol, after reaching the air side (the cathode), immediately reacts with air; though the exact kinetics are debated, {{the end result}} is a reduction of the cell voltage.Cross-over remains a major factor in inefficiencies, and often half of the methanol is lost to cross-over. Methanol cross-over and/or its effects can be alleviated by (a) developing alternative membranes (e.g.), (b) improving the electro-oxidation process in the catalyst layer and improving the structure of the catalyst and gas diffusion layers (e.g. [...] ), and (c) optimizing the design of the flow field and the membrane <b>electrode</b> <b>assembly</b> (MEA) which can be achieved by studying the current density distributions (e.g. [...] ).|$|E
