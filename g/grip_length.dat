50|$|In most cases, {{some degree}} of {{embedment}} is inevitable. That said, short grip lengths should be avoided. For two bolted joints of identical design and installation, except the second having a longer <b>grip</b> <b>length,</b> the first joint {{will be more likely}} to loosen and fail. Since both joints have the same loading, the surfaces will experience the same amount of embedment. However, the relaxation in strain is less significant to the longer <b>grip</b> <b>length</b> and the loss in preload will be minimized. For this reason, bolted joints should always be designed with careful consideration for the <b>grip</b> <b>length.</b>|$|E

50|$|In {{critical}} fastener joints, embedment {{can mean}} loss of preload. Flattening of a surface allows {{the strain of}} a screw to relax, which in turn correlates with a loss in tension and thus preload.

Therefore, embedment can lead directly to loosening of a fastener joint and subsequent fatigue failure.|$|R

5000|$|Bolts {{are often}} {{used to make a}} bolted joint. This is a {{combination}} of the nut applying an axial clamping force and also the shank of the bolt acting as a dowel, pinning the joint against sideways shear forces. For this reason, many bolts have a plain unthreaded shank (called the [...] ) as this makes for a better, stronger dowel. The presence of the unthreaded shank has often been given as characteristic of bolts vs. screws, [...] but this is incidental to its use, rather than defining. The <b>grip</b> <b>length</b> should be chosen carefully, to be around the same length as the thickness of the materials, and any washers, bolted together. Too short places the dowel shear load onto the threads, which may cause fretting wear on the hole. Too long prevents the nut from being tightened down correctly. No more than two turns of the thread should be within the hole.|$|E

40|$|One of {{the main}} methods used for joining {{composite}} components for aircraft and spacecraft applications is mechanical fastening [1]. Mechanically fastened joints have the advantages of reliability, detachability and inspectability, and represent a well-established and well-known method. However, to reach a satisfactory structural coupling efficiency with composite materials is much more challenging {{than it is for}} metals due to the low bearing and shear strengths, the higher notch sensitivity, the dependence of the joint strength on laminate configuration, and the influence of environmental effects. These properties represent a limiting factor on the structural performance of composite structures. The load capacity of composite bolted joints is typically increased by means of a local laminate build-up at the structure coupling area. The resulting laminate thickness increase, especially for highly loaded root-joints, leads to additional laminate stresses due to eccentricities, particularly in the case of single-shear joints, to complex geometries of adjacent structures as well as to a significant weight increase due to larger <b>grip</b> <b>lengths,</b> larger bolt diameters and heavier metallic fittings.

40|$|Tensile and shear {{testing of}} large fiber-reinforced polymer {{composite}} (FRPC) specimens with circular cross-section to final failure {{has always been}} challenging. A major difficulty is that the local stress triaxiality near the gripping ends usually leads to premature failure at these locations, instead of the desired test gauge sections. Recently an alternative method using expansive grout materials has been proposed, {{but there have been}} no well-established design guidelines due to lack of understanding of the gripping pressure developed by the expansive grout material. In this study, an analytical solution has been derived to correlate the hoop strain on the outer surface of the confining pipe (caused by grout expansion in the pipe) to the grout elastic modulus and linear expansion coefficient. By measuring the exterior surface hoop strains of two different steel pipes, the elastic modulus and linear expansion coefficient have been determined to be 4. 52 ± 0. 07 msi and 0. 158 ± 0. 008 % respectivly. The solution has also been expanded to include the composite specimens and predict the gripping pressure at specimen-grout material interface for any given pipes, which makes it possible to select improved expansive grout material based gripping system parameters including the minimum <b>gripping</b> <b>length,</b> optimum confinement pipe dimensions, and minimum grout material volume...|$|R

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this thesis is to study the {{behaviour}} of bolted steel connections subjected to tension. Quasi-static conditions have been considered. By performing laboratory tests on single bolts and simple T-stub connections the failure modes of the bolts have been examined. Finite element models are created and validated to represent the behaviour observed in the laboratory. Different <b>grip</b> <b>length</b> configurations have been tested for a single bolt and nut assembly subjected to pure tension. Both partially and fully threaded bolts have been considered. It was found that partially threaded bolts with three threads between the unthreaded part of the shank and the bearing surface of the nut experienced thread stripping. This is inconsistent with the recommendations given in NS-EN 1090 - 2, which states that one full thread is sufficient to avoid thread stripping. Finite element models are able to recreate the behaviour of all configurations tested with acceptable accuracy. In addition to the <b>grip</b> <b>length,</b> the material properties and geometry of the threads are identified as the crucial factors for the failure modes of the bolts. Simple T-stub connections with one bolt in each flange have been tested to examine the behaviour of the bolts when they are subjected {{to a combination of}} tension and bending. The center distance between the bolts was varied to examine the behaviour when subjected to increased bending effects. Connections with partially threaded bolts all failed due to thread stripping. The fully threaded bolts experienced both thread stripping and bolt failure. The complexity of the stress distribution when large bending effects are present was difficult to recreate with a simplified finite element model. Acceptable accuracy up to maximum force was possible to achieve for the smallest bolt center distance. The response of the finite element model was very mesh sensitive, and difficult to recreate with limited computational capacity when applying an explicit solution algorithm...|$|E

Specimens were made in four different batches with variations in configuration, materials and processes in each. Static strength of all test specimens exceeded the design ultimate load requirements. Fatigue test results confirmed that aluminum brazed titanium, as used in the Refan tailpipe design, meets the fatigue durability objectives.

40|$|Tensile and shear {{testing to}} final {{fracture}} of large-diameter, fiber-reinforced polymer (FRP) composite round bars is often challenging because local stress triaxiality near the gripping ends can precipitate premature failure at these locations, {{instead of in}} the desired test gauge section. A method using expansive grout materials has been used, though its design is impaired {{by the lack of}} understanding of the gripping pressure developed by the confined expansive grout material. In this paper, an analytical solution has been derived to correlate the hoop strain on the outer surface of the confining steel pipe (caused by grout expansion in the steel pipe) to the grout’s elastic modulus and coefficient of linear expansion. By experimentally measuring the exterior surface hoop strains of two different steel pipes, the elastic modulus and coefficient of linear expansion were determined. This solution has been generalized to include the composite bar and predict the gripping pressure at the bar-grout interface for any given pipe and composite bar combination. Based on the analytical results, expressions for key design parameters for improved expansive grout-based gripping systems, including the minimum <b>grip</b> <b>length,</b> optimum dimensions of the confinement pipes, and minimum volume of the grout material, have been provided. Based on the improved design, glass FRP bars of diameters 19. 0 to 38. 0 mm (0. 75 to 1. 5 in.) were tested without gripping problems and with failure loads up to 534 kN (126 kip), which significantly exceeds 400 kN (90 kip), the load level identified as a threshold of concern...|$|E

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to identify the main design parameters contributing to loosening of bolts due to vibration and to identify their relative importance and degree of contribution to bolt loosening. Vibration testing was conducted on a shaketable with a controlled-random input in the dynamic testing laboratory of the Structural Test Division of MSFC. Test specimens which contained one test bolt were vibrated for a fixed amount of time and percentage of pre-load loss was measured. Each specimen tested implemented some combination of eleven design parameters as dictated by the design of experiment methodology employed. The eleven design parameters were: bolt size (diameter), lubrication on bolt, hole tolerance, initial pre-load, nut locking device, <b>grip</b> <b>length,</b> thread pitch, lubrication between mating materials, class of fit, joint configuration and mass of configuration. These parameters were chosen for this experiment because they are believed to be the design parameters having the greatest impact on bolt loosening.

40|$|Thesis (M. Sc. (Occupational Hygiene)) [...] North-West University, Potchefstroom Campus, 2005. The aim of {{the study}} was to {{evaluate}} ergonomics in a Base Metal Refinery (BMR). The hypothesis tested was that the machinery and equipment used and the postures of the workers and the load handled are not in line with good ergonomic standards and practices. Anthropometrical measurements were taken from 11 1 workers and the loads they handled, their posture while performing the work and the heights of different workstations. Self administered questionnaires were completed by all the workers so as to determine how the feel about their work and an observational data was recorded in order to observe the way the work was performed. Different anthropometrical measurements taken included stature, weight, vertical grip reach, forward grip reach, shoulder <b>grip</b> <b>length,</b> shoulder height/hip height. Different variables including height of the workstation, weight handled, type of work done and frequency of handling were also measured. Evaluation of medical records and incident reports were also carried out to determine whether these records support the hypothesis to be tested or not. Most of the workstations were not ergonomically designed and the work performed in the Base Metal Refinery was done in a standing position and repeated for most of the work shifts. Anthropometrical data was collected so as it can be compared with the type of work performed the duration of the work and whether the workstations were designed to fit the workers. Workers in the BMR were exposed to handling loads which were higher than the NIOSH recommended weight of 23 kg, the work was highly repetitive and the workers had to bend awkwardly while performing the work. Therefore this disagrees with the hypothesis which states that the machinery and equipment used and the postures of the workers and the load handled was not in line with good ergonomic standards and practices. This statement was also supported by the incidents reports and the medical records which showed that most workers were booked for a long time due to lower back pain, and more incidents occurred due to handling loads. In BMR most incidents, injuries and illnesses were common amongst cell workers than any occupation within the industry. High incidents and absenteeism due to lower back related illnesses can be directly associated to the type of work performed and the amount of load handled. Most of the workstations were either too high or too low therefore forcing the workers to bend at the waist or his neck so as to properly observe the task, and this proves that BMR was not designed to fit the workers, the way the work was performed, the posture of the worker, the repetitive nature of the work and the weight handled were exceeding the ergonomic standards and practices.
