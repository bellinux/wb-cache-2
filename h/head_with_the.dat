5|$|America's Most Wanted (Chris Harris and James Storm) {{challenged}} Team Canada (Bobby Roode and Eric Young), {{who were}} accompanied by Coach D'Amore, for the NWA World Tag Team Championship in the seventh match. Johnny Devine interfered midway through by hitting Storm with a kendo stick, {{which led to a}} pinfall attempt by Young, however Stormed kicked out at two. Later, Young went to grab a chair from Devine who had his back turned to the ring. This caused Devine to panic and hit Young in the <b>head</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> chair. Storm immediately followed by grabbing Young and pinning his shoulders to the mat with a school boy type pin attempt for the victory.|$|E

5|$|Most middle {{aged and}} young women in urban Maharashtra dress in western outfits such as skirts and {{trousers}} or shalwar kameez with the traditionally nauvari or nine-yard sari, disappearing from the markets {{due to a lack}} of demand. Older women wear the five-yard sari. Traditionally, Brahmin women in Maharashtra, unlike those of other castes, did not cover their <b>head</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> end of their saree. In urban areas, the five-yard sari is worn by younger women for special occasions such as marriages and religious ceremonies. Maharashtrian brides prefer the very Maharashtrian saree – the Paithani – for their wedding day.|$|E

5|$|Next, Team Canada (A-1, Bobby Roode, Eric Young, and Petey Williams) were {{pitted against}} the 4Live Kru (B.G. James, Kip James, Konnan, and Ron Killings) in an Eight-Man Tag Team match. Coach Scott D'Amore {{accompanied}} Team Canada to the ring. The {{duration of the}} encounter was 7 minutes and 18 seconds. Despite the match being contested under disqualifications and count-outs, Konnan used his shoe as a weapon during the match. Roode won the bout for his team by pinning Kip after Konnan betrayed his teammates and bashed Kip {{over the head with}} a steel chair. After the match, Konnan also bashed B.G. over the <b>head</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> chair before leaving the ring.|$|E

In this episode, Scully, Doggett, and Walter Skinner (Mitch Pileggi) discover several returned alien abductees. Doggett calls on another agent, Monica Reyes (Annabeth Gish), to assist the case. Scully’s fears about finding Mulder come to a <b>head</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> sudden recovery {{of one of the}} abductees seized at the same time.|$|E
5|$|Thomas Lawton (6 October 1919– 6 November 1996) was an English {{football}} player and manager.

5|$|A Six Man Tag Team Full Metal Mayhem match {{followed}} pitting {{the team}} of Kurt Angle and Team 3D against A.J. Styles, Christian Cage, and Rhino. The duration of the contest was 15 minutes and 55 seconds. In this bout, {{the only way to}} win was by pinfall or submission, all weapons were legal and encouraged, and there were no disqualifications. Cage ascended the steel supports left behind from the Ultimate X match during the bout to jump off in an aerial splash onto both members of Team 3D and Angle. Each participant of the match was forced through a table during the bout except Angle. Rhino was the first by Team 3D, followed by Cage also by Team 3D. Each member of Team 3D were then forced through a table by Styles. After this, Johnny Devine interfered in the encounter on Team 3D's behalf by attempting to hit Styles with a kendo stick, only to be kicked in the head by Styles. Later, Styles laid Angle on a table and ascended a ladder. At this time, Frank Trigg interfered by hitting Styles over the <b>head</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> kendo stick, allowing Angle to force Styles through the set-up table with his signature Olympic Slam maneuver for the pinfall victory.|$|E
5|$|During {{the early}} 1900s and 1910s, St. Louis began a {{building}} program that created parks and playgrounds in several deteriorating residential neighborhoods. Parks Commissioner (and former professional tennis player) Dwight F. Davis continued {{the development of}} recreational facilities during the early 1910s by expanding tennis facilities and building a public 18-hole golf course in northwest Forest Park. The St. Louis Zoo was constructed in Forest Park in the early 1910s {{under the leadership of}} Mayor Henry Kiel. Since the 1890s, St. Louis had attempted to control its air pollution problems with little success, but damage to buildings and flora made the issue more visible during the 1920s. Problems came to a <b>head</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> 1939 St. Louis smog, which blackened the sky and lasted for three weeks. A ban on burning low-quality coal solved the problem in December 1939, and the addition of natural gas for heating assisted homeowners in making the transition to cleaner fuels by the late 1940s.|$|E
5|$|For a time, no overt {{action was}} taken, and the plans {{continued}} to evolve. A further refinement {{of the plan}} was developed by William and McGeorge Bundy on 29 November 1964, with a more moderate target list, which the Joint Chiefs opposed. No action was taken while these, and other, plans were considered. But matters came to a <b>head</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> attack on Camp Holloway on 7 February 1965, which demanded immediate action, and resulted in a reprisal raid known as Operation Flaming Dart. A sapper raid against an American enlisted men's billet at Qui Nhon on the 10th led to Flaming Dart II. These small-scale operations were launched against the southern region of the country, where the bulk of North Vietnam's ground forces and supply dumps were located.|$|E

5|$|In 1935, Hull City's first shirt badge {{mirrored}} the familiar three crowns civic emblem of Kingston-upon-Hull, which was {{displayed on the}} sky blue shirts worn in the 1935–36 season. Following that season, the team went without wearing a badge until 1947, when the club crest depicted a tiger's head in an orange-shaded badge. This was worn up until 1957, when it was changed to just the tiger's head. This was worn for three years, when the shirt again featured no emblem. Then, in 1971, the club returned to showing the tiger's head on the shirt. This was used for four years, until the club's initials of HCAFC were shown for four years. After this, a logo with the tiger's <b>head</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> club's name underneath was used from 1979 until 1998. The next logo, which remains the club's current logo, features the tiger's head in an amber shield with the club's name, along with the club's nickname, The Tigers.|$|E
5|$|In 1960, Kinne was {{associated}} with two mysterious deaths. On March 19 of that year, her husband, James Kinne, was found shot in the <b>head</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> couple's two-year-old daughter playing nearby. Sharon Kinne claimed that the little girl, who had often been allowed to play with her father's guns, had accidentally shot him, and police were initially unable to disprove this theory. The case was closed as an accidental death and remained that way until the evening of May 27, when the body of twenty-three-year-old Patricia Jones, a local file clerk, was found by Kinne and a boyfriend in a secluded area. Investigation showed that Jones had been the wife of another of Kinne's boyfriends, and that Jones's husband had tried to break off his affair with Kinne shortly before Patricia Jones went missing. When Kinne admitted to having been {{the last person to}} speak to Patricia Jones, she was charged with Jones's death and, upon further investigation of his death, with the murder of James Kinne.|$|E
5|$|Nevertheless, {{there were}} some who were {{concerned}} by the expansion of powers granted to Augustus by the Second Settlement, and this came to a <b>head</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> apparent conspiracy of Fannius Caepio. Some time prior to 1 September 22 BC, a certain Castricius provided Augustus with information about a conspiracy led by Fannius Caepio. Murena was named among the conspirators, the outspoken Consul who defended Primus in the Marcus Primus Affair. The conspirators were tried in absentia with Tiberius acting as prosecutor; the jury found them guilty, {{but it was not}} a unanimous verdict. All the accused were sentenced to death for treason and executed as soon as they were captured—without ever giving testimony in their defence. Augustus ensured that the facade of Republican government continued with an effective cover-up of the events.|$|E

5|$|On the February 13 {{episode of}} Raw SuperShow, Orton {{suffered}} a concussion after World Heavyweight Champion Daniel Bryan smashed Orton over the <b>head</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> title belt. Due to the injury, Orton {{was taken out}} of his elimination chamber match at Elimination Chamber and was replaced by Santino Marella. Orton returned on the March 2 SmackDown, losing to Bryan by count-out, following interference from Kane, who then attacked Orton after the match. In retaliation, Orton hit Kane with an RKO on the March 5 episode of Raw Supershow, after the latter defeated R-Truth. On the next SmackDown, Orton attacked Kane with another RKO before his match. They later brawled as the show ended. At WrestleMania XXVIII, Orton was defeated by Kane in a singles match. Orton defeated Kane on the next SmackDown in a No Disqualification match and at Extreme Rules in a Falls Count Anywhere match to end the feud.|$|E
5|$|One {{source of}} {{opposition}} to the proposed amendment was the women's suffrage movement, which {{before and during the}} Civil War had made common cause with the abolitionist movement. However, {{with the passage of the}} Fourteenth Amendment, which had explicitly protected only male citizens in its second section, activists found the civil rights of women divorced from those of blacks. Matters came to a <b>head</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> proposal of the Fifteenth Amendment, which barred race discrimination but not gender discrimination in voter laws. After an acrimonious debate, the American Equal Rights Association, the nation's leading suffragist group, split into two rival organizations: the National Woman Suffrage Association of Susan B. Anthony and Elizabeth Cady Stanton, who opposed the amendment, and the American Woman Suffrage Association of Lucy Stone and Henry Browne Blackwell, who supported it. The two groups remained divided until the 1890s.|$|E
5|$|Starting in 2000, {{with the}} {{discovery}} of at least three bodies (Quaoar, Sedna, and Eris) all comparable to Pluto in terms of size and orbit, it became clear that either they all had to be called planets or Pluto would have to be reclassified. Astronomers also knew that more objects as large as Pluto would be discovered, and the number of planets would start growing quickly. They were also concerned about the classification of planets in other planetary systems. In 2006, the matter came to a <b>head</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> first measurement of the size of Eris. That measurement had showed Eris (as it was mistakenly believed to be until the New Horizons mission to Pluto) to appear to be slightly larger than Pluto, and so was thought to be equally deserving of the status of 'planet' at the time.|$|E
