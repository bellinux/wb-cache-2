50|$|The Tenax was {{modified}} in 1953 with a fixed viewfinder integrated {{in a higher}} top plate with the exposure counter inside it, and a revised <b>advance</b> <b>lever.</b> Soon after it was renamed Taxona, because the East German company had lost the rights to use the traditional Zeiss Ikon names, property of the Western Zeiss Ikon company. At the same time, the Novar name became Novonar. The tip of the <b>advance</b> <b>lever</b> became black in 1954. Production ended in 1959.|$|R
5000|$|Rapid-wind <b>film</b> <b>advance</b> <b>lever.</b> Earlier 35 mm SLRs, {{with the}} sole {{exception}} of Exakta's left-handed lever, had knob winders.|$|E
5000|$|FED 2e is a FED 3b {{with the}} FED 2d shutter {{that does not}} have the slow speeds. Similar to the 3b, it does not have strap lugs but has a <b>film</b> <b>advance</b> <b>lever.</b> Production ended around 1970.|$|E
50|$|The Exakta 66 {{is based}} on the Pentacon Six but was made in West Germany by Exakta GmbH, Nuremberg. The body is rubber coated, the <b>film</b> <b>advance</b> <b>lever</b> moves through a shorter angle, and it has a TTL-metered prism coupled to new Schneider lenses.|$|E
50|$|The rewind {{release was}} {{moved from the}} front right {{faceplate}} {{to the top of}} the camera between the ASA setting dial and the <b>advance</b> <b>lever</b> arm.|$|R
5000|$|The Neoca 2S is a 35mm {{rangefinder}} camera made in Japan in 1955 and 1956. It has a dual-stroke <b>advance</b> <b>lever</b> and {{a central}} shutter; neither feature is typical {{for this kind}} of camera. The lens is a Neokor anastigmat f=45mm/3.5.|$|R
40|$|Nikon FM compact has {{simplification}} feature {{derived from}} cameras designed for easy, yet accurate {{use in a}} weightless environment. Innovation is a plastic-cushioned <b>advance</b> <b>lever</b> which <b>advances</b> the <b>film</b> and simultaneously switches on a built in light meter. With a turn of the lens aperture ring, a glowing signal in viewfinder confirms correct exposure...|$|R
50|$|The OM-1n {{is similar}} to the OM-1MD, with a {{redesigned}} <b>film</b> <b>advance</b> <b>lever,</b> a flash ready/sufficient flash LED in the viewfinder, and automatic flash synchronization (X-sync), regardless of the position of the FP/X switch when used with a T-series flash unit mounted on Flash Shoe 4.|$|E
50|$|The Nikon F-301 {{is notable}} {{for being the}} first Nikon SLR sold that lacked a <b>film</b> <b>advance</b> <b>lever.</b> As a result the {{selector}} knob, also used to lock the shutter button, has a continuous option {{in addition to the}} single shot. It was also the first Nikon SLR to feature DX film decoding.|$|E
5000|$|The camera {{offers the}} {{convenience}} of image composition with wide open aperture. The aperture is stopped down to the selected value after the shutter is released. After exposure the mirror stays up until the bottom-mounted single-stroke <b>film</b> <b>advance</b> <b>lever</b> is again wound. Focusing is via a ground glass screen with a central split-image rangefinder.|$|E
50|$|The Zorki 4, 1956, was a Zorki 3S with {{self-timer}} added. The Zorki 4K {{was identical}} but used an <b>advance</b> <b>lever</b> {{instead of the}} old-style wind knob. With over 2 million units produced, the Zorki 4 was the most successful Zorki and {{has a reputation as}} one of the best Russian cameras, although the self-timer and slow shutter speeds were unreliable. The Zorki Mir of 1959 was a lower-cost Zorki 4 with fewer shutter speeds.|$|R
50|$|Leica IIIf and its {{predecessors}} {{had used a}} knob to <b>advance</b> the <b>film.</b> For fear of tearing the film, early M3s had a double stroke <b>advance</b> <b>lever,</b> like the Neoca 2s would. Later models (from model no 915 251) had single-stroke levers, which quickened up operation of the camera. Another type of variation is in the film pressure plate used. Early models used a glass plate to keep the film flat; later models used a metal plate.|$|R

5000|$|This {{redesign}} {{made a new}} {{camera case}} design necessary, leaving additional space for the frame counter, and the frame reset slider. The Retina Reflex cases were already something special before since the <b>film</b> <b>advance</b> <b>lever</b> (Reflex) and aperture/shutter setting wheel (Reflex S) are located on the bottom. The photo shows just how complex the Retina case had become.|$|E
50|$|It has {{the typical}} big finder of the Optima series, {{but on this}} special model it is {{combined}} with a superimposed coupled rangefinder. Shutter speed is controlled electronically by a CdS meter, with speeds from 15 sec. to 1/1000 sec. A special feature of the series is the <b>film</b> <b>advance</b> <b>lever</b> which can be switched to also rewind the film at its end.|$|E
5000|$|The camera's {{top plate}} has the {{manually}} set frame counter, the shutter release, the {{film rewind knob}} with film reminder dial, the exposure needle window, meter adjustment knob with EV and ASA/DIN scales, the film (advance) release button, the frame (counter) advance slider, and the accessory shoe. The bottom plate contains the tripod socket, the <b>film</b> <b>advance</b> <b>lever,</b> the back release latch, and the film rewind release button.|$|E
50|$|The Leicaflex SL Mot was {{a variant}} of the Leicaflex SL that could take a motor drive, and lacked the {{self-timer}} and the meter switch in the <b>advance</b> <b>lever.</b> The SL Mot was mostly produced in black enamel and later black chrome, but chrome examples do exist. The motor drive was as large as the camera body itself, marked LEICAFLEX MOTOR, and was probably only made in black. 980 serial numbers were allotted to the Leicaflex SL Mot. It seems that some were used by the NASA and have NASA engravings.|$|R

5000|$|... #Caption: The first rigid {{model of}} Retinette (Model 022) {{introduced}} in 1954. Lens is Scheider Kreuznach Reomar and the shutter is Compur - Rapid. Leather carrying case was {{included with the}} camera. A 29.5 mm skylight filter {{is attached to the}} lens. The lever on the left of the lens at 9 o' clock is the self-timer actuator. Construction of the body is all-metal, including the <b>film</b> <b>advance</b> <b>lever</b> at the bottom. The lens mounting plate is rectangular ...|$|E
50|$|A {{characteristic}} {{model was}} the Diax Ia for interchangeable lenses, with 3 different viewfinders in the top, each {{in a different}} color: blue for 35mm lenses, yellow for 85 or 90mm lenses and neutral for 45 or 50 mm lenses. The Diax II, Diax IIa and Diaxette models were rangefinder cameras. The b models were like the a models, but with a rapid <b>film</b> <b>advance</b> <b>lever.</b> The Diax system also included 10 lens types covering 6 focal lengths with a common filter thread size of 40.5mm.|$|E
5000|$|The M2 was {{considered}} to be a more affordable, simplified version of the 1954 Leica M3. Notably, the frame counter of the M2 was composed of a disk plate beneath the <b>film</b> <b>advance</b> <b>lever</b> that had to be manually reset to zero after reloading. This system was close to that of the Leica III series, and unlike that of the M3, which is an independent frame counter, visible through a window in the top plate, that automatically resets to zero when the film take-up spool is removed.|$|E
40|$|A film {{advancement}} indicator {{which includes}} an optical sensor that detects the rotational movement of a disc that rotates {{only when the}} <b>film</b> <b>advance</b> is described. When the <b>film</b> does not <b>advance,</b> an indicator light is activated. A counter {{is included in the}} electronic circuit to determine the number of <b>film</b> frames <b>advanced...</b>|$|R
50|$|The {{original}} Leicaflex {{is readily}} identifiable from its CdS meter window and battery cover {{on the front}} of the prism housing just above the lens. It was offered in chrome and black enamel finishes, the latter being rare. The first series had a fan-shaped exposure counter window and a tripod socket attached by three screws, whereas the second series had a round exposure counter window, a tripod socket integrated in the bottom plate and a meter switch built in the <b>advance</b> <b>lever.</b> In use, the two series are virtually identical. 32,500 serial numbers were allotted to the original Leicaflex.|$|R

50|$|The Leica MP is Leica's {{latest film}} {{rangefinder}} camera. Unlike the preceding Leica M7, the camera has adopted many retro design features {{from the earlier}} M3. These include a M3 type metal <b>film</b> <b>advance</b> <b>lever,</b> knob film rewind design and M3 type frameline adjust lever. The basic classic design remains unchanged and the design for loading film from the bottom has been retained. The camera comes in various camera finishes including black chrome, black paint and silver chrome and can be further customised with Leica AG's à la carte program.|$|E
50|$|In 1973, the FTb {{design was}} revised slightly. The camera {{was given a}} plastic tipped <b>film</b> <b>advance</b> <b>lever.</b> The stop down lever was changed to the same style as that found on the F-1. The PC sync socket was given a {{spring-loaded}} plastic cover. The ring around {{the outer edge of}} the shutter speed dial was changed from a scalloped design to a diamond textured design. Finally, a shutter speed display was added in the lower left hand corner of the viewfinder. This model was unofficially known as FTb-N or FTbn.|$|E
50|$|Much work {{went into}} human factors {{engineering}} {{to create an}} ergonomic user interface for the camera. The form of previous cameras was largely dictated by the required locations of mechanical controls on the body, such as the <b>film</b> <b>advance</b> <b>lever,</b> rewind crank, shutter speed dial, shutter release, etc. On the T90, the film transport control is no longer required, while the others are no longer mechanically linked. This gave the designers more freedom to shape the camera {{to make it easier}} to control and hold, and to place controls in a way that suited the user rather than a mechanical design.|$|E
