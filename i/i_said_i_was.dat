She remarked, [...] "Even though every inmate was only allowed to do one a month, and I was only there for five months, I begged because <b>I</b> <b>said</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> an expert potter—ceramicist actually—and could I please make the entire nativity scene."

[...] One day later, the band revealed that the title would be rendered as [...] "Th1rt3en" [...] instead of 13. Drover stated in a subsequent interview that [...] "Th1rt3en" [...] had originally been the working title for the album. The cover artwork and track list for the album were revealed on September 7, 2011.|$|E

I said, 'No, never.' He said, 'I think you are going to be Batman's butler.' I said, 'How do I know I want to be Batman's butler?' It was the most ridiculous thing I had ever heard of.

2500|$|Charles Grean of Dot Records had {{arranged}} with {{the studio to}} do an album of space music based on music from Star Trek, {{and he has a}} teenage daughter who's a fan of the show and a fan of Mr. Spock.

So Dot contacted me and asked me if I would be interested in either speaking or singing on the record. <b>I</b> <b>said</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> very interested in doing both. ...That was the first album we did, which was called Mr. Spock's Music from Outer Space.

2500|$|Lionsgate's {{president}} of theatrical marketing Tim Palen {{thought of the}} idea to make 1,000 posters {{with a small amount}} of Bell's blood, which was mixed with the printing ink. He said, [...] "We decided to do a poster and he's wearing a red cloak. I was talking to the printer and asked what we could do to get the deepest blood red. I asked if it would be possible to use actual blood. There was silence. He said, 'We could try, but are you serious?' <b>I</b> <b>said</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> dead serious." [...] The posters were sold for $20, with the first being auctioned off; all the proceeds from the auctioned poster were donated to the Red Cross.

2500|$|In a November 2014, {{interview}} with The A.V. Club, Reubens explained why the film {{took so long}} to be made, saying: [...] "I think part of what happened with this project is it got leaked probably {{a year and a half}} or two years before we really wanted anyone to know about it. I was doing a Q somewhere, and <b>I</b> <b>said</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> writing a movie with a guy named Paul Rust, and the next day a journalist called my manager and said, [...] "Paul Rust is someone very associated with Judd Apatow, can you confirm Judd Apatow is involved in the project?" [...] The whole thing got leaked and we had just started. We didn’t have a script yet or anything, so the script took a year and—I don’t really know the answer. I think two years of it was like premature information out there, and then the last two years it's just been very, very slow to get the right people involved, and we now have such an amazing company involved, and that's the really big announcement that hasn’t been made yet." ...|$|E
2500|$|Even as {{the film}} {{was in the first}} weeks of its 1989 {{theatrical}} release, rumors were circulating of a wave sequence missing from the film's end. As chronicled in the 1993 laserdisc Special Edition release and later in the 2000 DVD, the pressure to cut the film's running time stemmed from both distribution concerns and Industrial Light & Magic's then-inability to complete the required sequences. From the distributor's perspective, the looming three-hour length limited the number of times the film could be shown each day, assuming that audiences would be willing to sit through the entire film, though 1990's Dances with Wolves would shatter both industry-held notions. Further, test audience screenings revealed a surprisingly mixed reaction to the sequences as they appeared in their unfinished form; in post-screening surveys, they dominated both the [...] "Scenes I liked most" [...] and [...] "Scenes I liked least" [...] fields. Contrary to speculation, studio meddling was not the cause of the shortened length; Cameron held final cut as long {{as the film}} met a running time of roughly two hours and 15 minutes. He later noted, [...] "Ironically, the studio brass were horrified when <b>I</b> <b>said</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> cutting the wave." ...|$|E
2500|$|According to Amy Lee, {{the song}} has several meanings, the first being an {{incident}} at a restaurant. During an interview from a tour stop in Tulsa she told The Boston Phoenix: [...] "I {{was inspired to}} write it when someone said something to me— I didn’t know him, and I {{thought he might be}} clairvoyant. I was in a relationship and I was completely unhappy. But I was hiding it. I was being completely abused and I was trying to cover it up; I wouldn’t even admit it to myself. So then I had spoken maybe 10 or 15 words to this guy, who was a friend of a friend. We were waiting for everyone else to show up, and we went into a restaurant and got a table. And {{he looked at me and}} said, ‘Are you happy?’ And I felt my heart leap, and I was like, he totally knows what I’m thinking. And I lied, <b>I</b> <b>said</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> fine. Anyway, he's not really clairvoyant. But he is a sociology major." [...] Lee said in a VH1 interview: [...] "Open-mindedness. It's about waking up to all the things you've been missing for so long. One day someone said something that made my heart race for a second and I realized that for months I'd been numb, just going through the motions of life." [...] During an interview with Blender, Lee claimed that she wrote [...] "Bring Me to Life" [...] about her longtime friend, Josh Hartzler, whom she married in 2007.|$|E
