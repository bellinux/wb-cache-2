40|$|Methods for {{removing}} endotoxin from naturally occurring materials, such as polysaccharides (e. g., agarose and/or carrageenan) are described herein. Polysaccharides that are substantially <b>free</b> of <b>endotoxins</b> and uses thereof are also described. The polysaccharide materials can be isolated from microorganisms, multicellular organisms, such as, algae, plants, seaweed, etc. The method {{involves the use}} of acidic and basic solutions to hydrolyze the lipid-polysaccharide bond in endotoxins. Cleaving the fatty acid from the polysaccharide reduces the water-solubility of the fatty acid and enables its removal with an organic solvent such as ethanol. The polysaccharide component can also undergo acidic or basic hydrolysis due to the weak glycosidic bond between the sugar rings...|$|R

5000|$|A [...] {{is defined}} as any {{substance}} that can cause a fever. Bacterial pyrogens include endotoxins and exotoxins, although many pyrogens are endogenous to the host.

Endotoxins may become pyrogenic when released into the bloodstream or other tissue where they are not usually found.

40|$|Total and <b>free</b> <b>endotoxin</b> {{release in}} time from {{cultures}} of Escherichia coli by different antibiotics was studied in vitro for 4 h {{in relation to}} the antibiotic effect on viable counts and morphological features of the test cultures. The most rapid fall in viable counts was seen after treatment with imipenem or the combination of imipenem with tobramycin, accompanied by an early, but minimal increase (1. 8 -fold) of the total (free plus cell-bound) endotoxin level at 1 h. Total endotoxin levels increased approximately 5 -fold upon incubation with ceftazidime, tobramycin or the combination of tobramycin with cefuroxime, whereas incubation with cefuroxime or aztreonam alone caused a late 22 -and 49 -fold increase in total endotoxin, respectively, at 4 h. In chloramphenicol treated cultures there was still an increase in viable counts during therapy, resulting in an ultimately 78 -fold increase of mean levels of total endotoxin. <b>Free</b> <b>endotoxin</b> levels increased approximately 6 -fold within 1 h upon treatment with imipenem, alone or in combination with tobramycin, or ceftazidime as the result of rapid lysis of bacteria. Treatment with cefuroxime or aztreonam induced a relatively late but much higher release of <b>free</b> <b>endotoxin</b> (118 -and 222 -fold, respectively), which was due to the formation of long filamentous structures during the first 2 h of incubation and eventually cell lysis. Both tobramycin and the combination of tobramycin with cefuroxime caused a more gradual rise in <b>free</b> <b>endotoxin,</b> with a +/- 15 -fold increase in <b>free</b> <b>endotoxin</b> at 4 h. In chloramphenicol treated cultures, as in the control cultures, the level of <b>free</b> <b>endotoxin</b> remained proportional to the amount of viable organisms. We also studied plasma endotoxin levels in 20 patients with septic shock. 10 out of these 20 patients had a detectable endotoxemia (> 5 ng/l) on admission. We describe the patterns of plasma endotoxin in these patients during the first 24 h of antibiotic treatment. We conclude that, in the in-vitro study, values of total endotoxin, <b>free</b> <b>endotoxin,</b> and the rate of release of endotoxin varies with the antibiotic used.

These antibiotics caused a 2 - to 10 -fold increase in cerebrospinal fluid concentrations of free (filterable) endotoxin within 2 h of starting treatment. By contrast, <b>free</b> <b>endotoxin</b> concentrations increased almost 100 -fold in untreated animals 4 h later as bacteria continued to multiply. An initial enhancement of inflammation {{in the central}} nervous system occurred in all treatment groups compared with untreated controls. No significant differences were observed between treatment groups except for lower TNF concentrations in chloramphenicol-treated animals.

40|$|Endotoxin is liberated {{following}} antibiotic {{killing of}} Gram-negative rods, and antibiotics may differ in this respect. Although {{the amount of}} filterable endotoxin has also been reported to increase following antibiotic killing of meningococci, it is unknown how this influences the host response. We investigated the influence of three antibiotics on levels of <b>free</b> <b>endotoxin</b> in culture medium and cytokine production in whole blood ex vivo during killing of four strains of meningococci.

40|$|Total, cell-free,and cell-bound {{endotoxin}} and bacterial density weremeasured in cerebrospi-nal fluid (CSF) of 22 {{children with}} Hemophilus influenzae meningitis. Also {{the effect of}} ceftriaxone on CSF endotoxin levels was investigated in eight patients by reexamining their CSF 2 - 6 h after the initial dose. Initial CSF bacterial density correlated with initial CSF endotoxin levels (P <. (01). Ceftriaxone induced a marked increase of free endo-toxin in CSF, from an initial (mean ± SE) 0. 75 ± 0. 21 to 1. 29 ± 0. 2310 g 1 o ng/ml (P <. 01). This increase correlated positively {{with the number of}} bacteria killed in the CSF (P <. 01). The increase in <b>free</b> <b>endotoxin</b> was associated with an increase in mean CSF lactate levels from 8. 5 to 9. 7 units/l (P<. 05) and mean lactate dehydrogenase levels from 102 to 180 mmol/l (P<. 02) and a decrease in mean CSF glucose from 1. 17 to 0. 46 mmol/l (P <. 05). Initial CSF total endotoxin concentrations correlated both with the Herson-Todd clinical severity score (P <. (01) and with the number of febrile hospital days (P <. (01).

40|$|Recent {{controversy}} surrounding {{the activity of}} monoclonal antibodies against endotoxin highlights the necessity of identifying all factors associated with increased mortality, {{one of which is}} endotoxin concentrations. Antibiotics may induce different patterns of endotoxin release. We compared the release of <b>free</b> <b>endotoxin</b> (in endotoxin units per milliliter) over 6 h and changes in numbers of CFU of exponentially growing Escherichia coli and Pseudomonas aeruginosa (10 (6) to 10 (7) CFU/ml) cultured in chemically defined endotoxin-free broth combined with pooled human serum and/or 10 micrograms of E 5 immunoglobulin M monoclonal antibody per ml. MICs and MBCs were tested in each medium at the same inoculum. The inoculum was exposed to antibiotics at a single fixed multiple of the MIC for each medium (range, two to eight times the MIC). E 5 antibody had no effect on MICs, MBCs, bactericidal activity, or endotoxin release. In the presence of 50 % serum, amikacin, ceftazidime, imipenem, and ofloxacin each killed equivalent amounts of E. coli over 6 h; however, ceftazidime induced the highest release of endotoxin. Amikacin and ofloxacin produced the most favorable ratio of endotoxin release to amount of bacterial killing. In the presence of 50 % serum, ceftazidime and imipenem reduced the P. aeruginosa inoculum to the greatest extent over 6 h. Although its bactericidal activity was diminished, ofloxacin caused the lowest release of <b>free</b> <b>endotoxin.</b> Imipenem and ofloxacin showed similar low ratios of endotoxin release to bacterial killing. In summary, antibiotic class, presence of serum, and type of organism influenced bactericidal activity and endotoxin release...|$|E

Accordingly, antiendotoxin therapy has been {{considered one of the}} major targets for the treatment of sepsis. To investigate the influence of a human immunoglobulin G (IgG) derivative, the 5 S fragment of IgG (5 S-IgG; Gamma-Venin, Centeon Pharma GmbH, Frankfurt-Niederrad, Germany), on endotoxin release during bacterial proliferation and under antibiotic bactericidal action, time-kill studies were performed by using Escherichia coli ATCC 25922 starting inocula of 10 (3), 10 (5), and 10 (7) CFU/ml with cefotaxime (120 microg/ml) alone and in combination with 5 S-IgG (2, 100 microg/ml). Samples were collected for bacterial colony count and endotoxin concentration determinations; the area under the <b>free</b> <b>endotoxin</b> concentration curve (AUFEC) was calculated by using the trapezoidal rule. Colony counts showed that cefotaxime had a rapid bactericidal effect because it achieved greater than a 4 -log decrease in the numbers of E. coli CFU per milliliter over the first 2 h; the addition of 5 S-IgG did not appear to alter the kinetics of killing. Comparison of the AUFEC revealed that the addition of 5 S-IgG resulted in a mean reduction of 50, 66, and 27 % in the <b>free</b> <b>endotoxin</b> concentration at starting inocula of 10 (3), 10 (5), and 10 (7) CFU/ml, respectively. Moreover, experiments were conducted with a starting inoculum of 10 (5) CFU/ml and various amounts of 5 S-IgG (2 to 20 mg/ml) to further investigate the dose-effect relation of 5 S-IgG on endotoxin release. Decreased AUFECs were observed with increasing concentrations of 5 S-IgG, suggesting the dose-dependent antiendotoxin activity of 5 S-IgG. Further study is required to investigate the mechanism(s) responsible for this observation, the biological significance of this antiendotoxin activity, and the potential utility of 5 S-IgG as an adjuvant therapy in the treatment of gram-negative sepsis...|$|E

Varying degrees of reticulocytosis, with corresponding decreases in haemoglobin and haematocrit values, were observed from the tenth day after the injection of the SgE. All the injected animals also showed significant immune responses to SgE, peak haemagglutinin titres occurring coincidentally with the peaks of the haemolytic episodes. A similar injection schedule in specifically immune chickens also showed the anaemia appearing much earlier, persisting longer and being much more profound in intensity.

40|$|To {{evaluate}} {{the role of}} different antibiotics in the release of endotoxin {{and the production of}} tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF) and interleukin 6 (IL- 6) during the treatment of experimental Escherichia coli septical peritonitis, we obtained serial blood samples from septic rats treated with placebo, ceftazidime, aztreonam or imipenem. We also studied the effect of taurolidine, given alone or in combination with aztreonam, on the release of endotoxin and IL- 6. Despite decreasing levels of viable counts after treatment with ceftazidime, aztreonam or imipenem, levels of <b>free</b> <b>endotoxin</b> increased in all animals. We did not notice any significant differences in the extent of plasma endotoxin release between the different treatment groups. However, we did find significant differences in the IL- 6 production between the different treatment groups. After 2 h of treatment, IL- 6 levels had increased in all animals with the highest levels in the imipenem treated animals, whereafter IL- 6 levels decreased again in the rats treated with imipenem or ceftazidime, while in the rats treated with placebo or aztreonam IL- 6 levels further increased. This increase in IL- 6 levels was associated with acute mortality. In all antibiotic treated animals TNF levels significantly decreased during therapy. After 2 h of treatment TNF levels were the highest in the imipenem treated rats. The high levels of TNF and IL- 6 at t = 2 in the imipenem group were thought {{to be the result of}} early bacterial lysis, while the late increase in IL- 6 levels in the aztreonam treated animals was thought to be the result of the formation of long bacterial filaments io the abdominal cavity. In the present study, treatment with taurolidine could not prevent or inhibit the release of endotoxin or IL- 6, but taurolidine, alone or in combination with aztreonam, unexpectedly caused a dramatic increase in IL- 6 levels which was associated with an increased acute mortality. We conclude that antibiotics can cause the release of endotoxin in spite of decreasing levels of bacteremia in vivo. It is suggested that circumstances in which antibiotic-induced filamentation occurs are also conditions that yield excessive (local) LPS release. Our data also suggest that there is a lack of relationship between plasma <b>free</b> <b>endotoxin</b> levels and mortality and that the most important inflammatory compartment was the abdominal cavity in this model...|$|E

The goals {{of this study were}} to determine patterns of 3 -hydroxy fatty acid (3 -OHFA) distribution in dusts from four types of agricultural environments (dairy, cattle feedlot, grain elevator, and corn farm) and to evaluate correlations between the results of gas chromatography/mass spectrometry (GC/MS) analysis (total endotoxin) and biological recombinant factor C (rFC) assay (<b>free</b> bioactive <b>endotoxin).</b> An existing GC/MS-MS method (for house dust) was modified to reduce sample handling and optimized for small amount (dairy (0. 53) > corn farm (0. 33) > grain elevator (0. 11). In livestock environments, both odd- and even-numbered carbon chain length 3 -OHFAs correlated with rFC assay response. The GC/EI-MS method should be especially useful for identification of specific 3 -OHFAs for endotoxins from various agricultural environments and may provide useful information for evaluating the relationship between bacterial exposure and respiratory disease among agricultural workers...|$|R
30|$|Performance {{characteristics}} of the LAL test were defined according to manufacturer’s specifications: The LPS recovery of the spiked sample had to be 50 % to 200 %, and the coefficient of variation of the sample, analysed in duplicate, had to be lower than 10 %. Additionally, the coefficient of correlation of the calibration line had to be equal or better than 0.980. Each plate included a negative control (<b>endotoxin</b> <b>free</b> test water, LRW) and the related spiked sample. Invalid recoveries of spiked samples show false negative or false positive readings therefore, they can be excluded. Data which did not fulfil the performance standards of the test were not considered in our calculations.|$|R
40|$|The human interferon-beta-inducing 22 K factor {{has been}} shown to have {{structural}} homologies with interleukin- 1 beta (IL- 1 beta) and some of the activities attributed to IL- 1. We have shown that 22 K factor, purified to homogeneity and <b>endotoxin</b> <b>free,</b> has connective tissue cell stimulating activities, indicating that these activities are due to a naturally occurring species of IL- 1 beta and not contaminating factors. 22 K factor stimulated the production of prostaglandin E, caseinase activity and plasminogen activator activity in human articular chondrocytes in culture. This cell system appears highly sensitive to 22 K factor activity. 22 K factor also stimulated the resorption of bovine nasal cartilage and neonatal mouse calvaria. status: publishe...|$|R
