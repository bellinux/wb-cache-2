However, the HSE may also delegate its functions to local government under section 18, which allows for a more decentralised and targeted approach to regulation. Any enforcing authority may appoint inspectors with a written document stating their powers. This is as evidence of their authority (section 19). <b>Enforcing</b> <b>authorities</b> may indemnify the inspector against any civil litigation if he has acted in the honest belief that he was within his powers (section 26).

When parties foresee this possibility, they may rationally refrain from contracting in the …rst place, and consequently contracts will be “incomplete”. It follows that contractual incompleteness {{is more likely to be}} observed when the value of contracting is low, when the incentives that the contract must supply are high, when the individuals involved have substantial wealth, and when the <b>enforcing</b> <b>authority</b> enjoys substantial discretion. Consistent with these predictions, (1) criminal law regularly employs ambiguous and hard-to-verify contingencies, and in general the “punishment …ts the crime”, (2) laws requiring judicial interpretation appear to be less common in countries where judges enjoy more discretion, and (3) private commercial contracts make some but limited use of clauses that require judicial interpretation...|$|R

I called them Public Enemies, and so designated them in my letter, sent to the Chief of Police, the Sheriff and every law enforcing officer.

5000|$|The inn {{contains}} [...] "The Museum of Smuggling", {{which is}} located to {{the western side of}} the inn and the main coaching house. A plaque on the walls outside says [...] "The Museum of Smuggling. Presents a record of classical examples in the arts of concealment and evasion". The museum's main focus is its collection of smuggling artifacts that is depicted through the history of the Jamaica Inn and the inn's role in this trade for many years. The Cornwall coast was the most popular location for smuggling of silks, tea, tobacco and brandy into England and operated from the Cornish coast, Polperro (on the south coast) and Boscastle, Trebarwith and Tintagel on the north coast as this coastline was not well covered by the law <b>enforcing</b> <b>authorities.</b> Many of the smugglers stored their contraband in the isolated location of the Jamaica Inn. It is also said that even the judges were fairly lenient towards the smugglers, probably due to their receiving some of the smuggled goods.The museum contains various items including [...] "Wanted" [...] posters, one of which is dated to 1798, a poster celebrating Lord Nelson's victory at the Battle of Trafalgar, various pottery figures of smugglers and villains, a bag of [...] "10 pounds of Jamaican ganja" [...] and old books etc. There is also a display in the room where the author Maurier lived of various items owned by her including her writing desk and typewriter.|$|E

40|$|The {{objective}} of this note is to provide {{solutions to the problem}} of the legal standing of non-governmental organizations before the courts in the particular case of Armenia. These solutions are based on the progress that has been made in the study of environmental law, the provisions of the Constitution of Armenia, international obligations, and developments in case law. In particular, it is argued that non-governmental organizations in Armenia are formally endowed with the right to access justice on environmental matters in public interest litigations, even though this right is not recognized by the courts of the Republic of Armenia. To overcome this discrepancy the author of the article offers an interpretation of the legislation in order to sustain his position. By analysing some problems the author underlines the prominence of the developments in the Republic of Armenia and Europe that are little known to the lawmaking and law <b>enforcing</b> <b>authorities</b> or underestimated by them in the long term perspective...|$|E
