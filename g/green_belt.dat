5|$|By February 1998, Hertsmere Borough Council granted {{consent for}} Arsenal {{to build a}} {{training}} centre on the greenfield land, adjacent to a local school in the Bell Lane area, London Colney. It is situated adjacent to the former facilities at Shenley Sports grounds, which Watford Football Club use for training purposes. They concluded it was “…essential to support the training facility”, that it would replace an existing building used by the club and that Arsenal’s community work “constituted exceptional circumstances”. The plans were referred to the Environment Secretary John Prescott, who ratified it, {{in spite of the}} area's position on the <b>green</b> <b>belt.</b> Planning permission was obtained in September 1998.|$|E

It was {{also found that the}} permits for the establishment had not been obtained. However, the Regent of Semarang, Sudharto, was supportive of Kampoeng Rawa, stating that the complex not only improved the welfare of the farmers and fishermen, but stopped feuds over the use of rice paddies in the area.|$|E
5|$|Greater London {{is split}} by the River Thames.

However, even though {{it is one of the}} largest urban conglomerations in Europe, almost two-thirds of London is made up of greenspace and wetlands, consisting primarily of extensive areas of <b>green</b> <b>belt,</b> large parks and the Thames basin. As of January 2016, there are 37 sites designated within this Area of Search, 30 of which have been designated for their biological interest and 7 for their geological interest.|$|E

At a meeting held on 30 June 2011 Salford Council decided not to renew the permission, and on 1 August obtained a court order prohibiting any further extraction pending an appeal by the companies involved. A public inquiry concluded in 2012 supported the council's decision, and commercial peat extraction on Chat Moss ceased.|$|E
5|$|At L'Ora, De Mauro {{joined a}} group of crack investigative reporters. From the mid-1950s to the 1970s the left-leaning {{newspaper}} often hit the national spotlight for its investigations and denunciations about the ties between the Sicilian Mafia and corrupt politicians. These were the golden years of investigations, signed by journalists like Mauro De Mauro, Felice Chilanti and Mario Farinella. De Mauro could exercise his skills as a successful investigative reporter. He wrote on drug trafficking and the Sack of Palermo, the construction boom in the 1950s and 1960s {{that led to the}} destruction of the city's <b>green</b> <b>belt</b> and ancient villas. He also published articles about the collusion between the Mafia and politics. In 1960 he was among the winners of the Premiolino, {{one of the most important}} Italian journalism awards, for his crime investigations.|$|E
5|$|Basingstoke's {{expansion}} has absorbed much surrounding farmland {{and scattered}} housing, transforming it into housing estates or local districts. Many {{of these new}} estates are designed as almost self-contained communities, such as Lychpit, Chineham, Popley, Winklebury, Oakridge, Kempshott, Brighton Hill, Viables, South Ham, Black Dam, Buckskin and Hatch Warren. The M3 acts as a buffer zone {{to the south of}} the town, and the South Western Main Line constrains the western expansion, with a <b>green</b> <b>belt</b> to the north and north-east, making Basingstoke shaped almost like a kite. As a result, the villages of Cliddesden, Dummer, Sherborne St John and Oakley, although being very close to the town limits, are considered distinct entities. Popley, Hatch Warren and Beggarwood are seeing rapid growth in housing.|$|E

5|$|Bath and North East Somerset (commonly {{referred}} to as BANES or B) is a unitary authority created on 1 April 1996, following {{the abolition of the}} County of Avon, which had existed since 1974. Part of the ceremonial county of Somerset, Bath and North East Somerset occupies an area of , two-thirds of which is <b>green</b> <b>belt.</b> It stretches from the outskirts of Bristol, south into the Mendip Hills and east to the southern Cotswold Hills and Wiltshire border. The city of Bath is the principal settlement in the district, but BANES also covers Keynsham, Midsomer Norton, Radstock and the Chew Valley.

5|$|In the 17th and 18th centuries manorial homes, {{including}} Cranham Hall, became attractive {{properties for}} merchants from the City of London. Initial attempts {{to expand the}} suburban estates from Upminster in the early 20th century ran into problems {{because of the lack}} of water supply. In 1922 sewage works for Upminster and Cranham were opened in Great Warley. In the 1930s land was used to develop some council housing and following the sale of the Benyon estate the pace of new building quickened. Cranham's location on the very edge of London's urban sprawl is explained by the halting effect on suburban house building of the introduction of the Metropolitan <b>Green</b> <b>Belt</b> and World War II. Thereafter building took place within the area bounded by the Southend Arterial Road in the north and St Mary's Lane in the south; and there were 615 council houses built by 1971.|$|E
5|$|The {{proposal}} {{to build a}} wind farm, in {{a joint venture between}} United Utilities and Peel Holdings, was announced in 2003. Shortly afterwards a pressure group, The Friends of Scout and Knowle Moor, was formed, and on 9 September 2003 representatives of the group attended a meeting of the Metropolitan Borough of Bury's, Ramsbottom and Tottington Area Board to oppose the plans. At the meeting, the spokesperson for the group said that, although they supported the use of alternative energy, they felt that this was the wrong area. Among the objections were that the scheme was contrary to the Unitary Development Plan and the <b>Green</b> <b>Belt,</b> and would adversely affect common land, open countryside and areas of ecological importance and special landscape value. The group also considered that the proposed development would be out of scale with the landscape, adversely affecting peat, water courses and wildlife, and would have a seriously detrimental visual impact, as well as causing a noise nuisance.|$|E

50|$|The Bujinkan Dōjō has {{a series}} of kyū (grades) {{below the level of}} shodan. The new student starts at mukyu ("without grade") and {{progresses}} from kukyu (9-kyu), the lowest rank, to ikkyu (1-kyu), the highest. Unranked (mukyū) practitioners wear white belts, kyu grade practitioners wear <b>green</b> <b>belts</b> (men) or red belts (women), and those with ranks of shōdan and above wear black belts. In some dojos kyu-level practitioners - especially in children's classes - wear colored belts, though the actual color of the belt varies from place to place. In Japan it was once customary for kyu-level men to wear <b>green</b> <b>belts</b> over a black ninjutsugi and women to wear red belts over a purple ninjutsugi, but this practice has largely been abandoned. Currently, both male and female Bujinkan practitioners now wear <b>green</b> <b>belts</b> over a black ninjutsugi and on the feet they wear tabi (soft-sole tabi for indoor training and jika-tabi for outdoor training) at most dojos.|$|R

5|$|Pick's {{interest}} in design {{led to his}} involvement in the founding, in 1915, of the Design and Industries Association. The organisation aimed to bring manufacturers and designers together {{to improve the quality of}} industrial design. Through his improvements in the UERL's advertising and branding, Pick was considered by many of its members to be taking a practical lead in achieving the organisation's aims and he was soon lecturing on the subject, giving talks during 1916 and 1917 at the Art Workers Guild in London, at the Royal Scottish Academy in Edinburgh and elsewhere. After the First World War, Pick continued to give talks regularly and published articles on design. He also began to set out his ideas on reconstruction and town planning, an area of design he became interested in through its connection to transport planning. He wrote and lectured extensively on this subject during the 1920s and 1930s including presenting a 14,000 word paper to the Institute of Transport in 1927 and addressing the International Housing and Town Planning Congress in 1939. Concerned about the uncontrolled and unchecked growth of London, partly facilitated by the new lines that London Underground was building, Pick was a strong supporter of the need for a <b>green</b> <b>belt</b> around the capital to maintain open space within reach of urban areas.|$|E
