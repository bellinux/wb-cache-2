25|$|That {{evening he}} played {{what he had}} written so far to {{a small group of}} Leningrad musicians. After Shostakovich {{finished}} the first movement, there was a long silence. An air-raid warning sounded. No one moved. <b>Everyone</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> hear the piece again. The composer excused himself to take his family to the nearest air-raid shelter. When he returned, he repeated the first movement, which then was followed by the next movement for his guests. Their reaction encouraged him to start that night on the Adagio. He completed this movement on 29 September in the city. Shostakovich and his family were then evacuated to Moscow on 1 October 1941. They moved to Kuybyshev (now Samara) on 22 October, where the symphony was finally completed.|$|E
25|$|The new empire was characterised {{by a great}} {{enthusiasm and}} vigor. There was a rash of heroic artwork in {{imitation}} of Greek and Roman styles, and the nation possessed a vigorous, growing industrial economy, while {{it had always been}} rather poor in the past. The change from the slower, more tranquil order of the old Germany was very sudden, and many, especially the nobility, resented being displaced by the new rich. And yet, the nobles clung stubbornly to power, and they, not the bourgeois, continued to be the model that <b>everyone</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> imitate. In imperial Germany, possessing a collection of medals or wearing a uniform was valued more than the size of one's bank account, and Berlin never became a great cultural center as London, Paris, or Vienna were. The empire was distinctly authoritarian in tone, as the 1871 constitution gave the emperor exclusive power to appoint or dismiss the chancellor. He also was supreme commander-in-chief of the armed forces and final arbiter of foreign policy. But freedom of speech, association, and religion were nonetheless guaranteed by the constitution.|$|E

The choreography was done by Danielle Polanco and Jonte' Moaning, who used a 1980s retro set. Beyoncé explained the concept of the video at MTV: [...] "It's probably the most flamboyant video, and the metallic dresses are so beautiful, they added so much color. I had to do a video for this song. <b>Everyone</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> know what a 'freakum dress' was, and you can't really explain it, you have to see it.

Another example of their behavior was when Dorothy Parker first met them, as Zelda and Scott were sitting atop a taxi. Parker said, [...] "They did both look as though they had just stepped out of the sun; their youth was striking. <b>Everyone</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> meet him." [...] Their social life was fueled with alcohol. Publicly, this meant little more than napping when they arrived at parties, but privately it increasingly led to bitter fights. To their delight, {{in the pages of the}} New York newspapers Zelda and Scott had become icons of youth and success—enfants terribles of the Jazz Age.|$|E

500|$|Executive {{producer}} Maurice Hurley {{was pleased}} with the outcome of the episode, saying [...] "The sets, the design of it and the look of that show was brilliant, I thought {{that might have been the}} best-looking show of the first season". However, he felt that the characterisations weren't quite right. This was the same opinion as that put forward by actor Brent Spiner, who portrayed both Data and Lore, who thought that Data's actions were not in line with his expectations of the character. This episode was the second and last appearance of Biff Yeager as Chief Engineer Argyle. He was the only one of the Chief Engineers introduced during the first season to appear twice, with Geordi La Forge (LeVar Burton) gaining the role in season two. Wil Wheaton later recalled that the stand-in actor used in this episode really irritated Spiner, and was never used again. He described the stand-in as looking like [...] "a break dancer doing the Robot" [...] whenever he had to portray Data or Lore, and said that [...] "I think the guy was really into playing an android, and his enthusiasm got cranked up to eleven, but by the end of the week, pretty much <b>everyone</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> deactivate him and sell him to the nearest Jawa." [...] The events of the episode would be followed up in later seasons, with the crystalline entity returning in the fifth-season episode [...] "Silicon Avatar".

500|$|In June 2009, co-writer and {{producer}} of the song, Xavier [...] "Zaytoven" [...] Dotson revealed to MTV News that he worked with Usher on a song. Zaytoven divulged a few details, saying, [...] "I can't wait for {{something like that to}} come out, so people can see I do more than just hip-hop. I can do R, pop, gospel ... whatever genre of music that's out. If you listen to , you can't say, 'Zaytoven did that.'" [...] According to Zaytoven in another interview with MTV News, the track was originally called [...] "Filing Papers". Zaytoven said, [...] "This is before there were any reports about Usher's marriage in the news. So I was thinking to myself, 'Is he trying to say something?' I don't know what Usher is going through, but Sean Garrett made a song about filling out papers, divorce papers. The beat, it's got a bounce to it. It's outta here." [...] Sean Garrett later clarified, stating that the song was not necessarily called [...] "Filing Papers", Garret commented, [...] "Let's say I wrote a record for Usher three or four months ago where I really didn't have any idea of what he was going through personally. I work really hard at creating records I feel that's gonna fit like a glove to an artist. Me and Usher have a close relationship; I tend to sort of assist certain artists in giving them a direction, where I think they need to go in their next move. I felt that was the direction we needed to go. I felt that was the question <b>everyone</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> know: Was [...] good or was it bad? Was it right? Are you happy or you're not?" [...] Garrett continued to maintain that he had no idea of Usher's state of marriage {{during the time of the}} song's development, stating that the record could have meant anything, saying, [...] "I'm a heavy believer in God. I'm a Pisces. My intuition is crazy. I think that's healthy in the process for me writing and producing for people. Maybe it was a sign of what my man was going through and he needed to get out. Maybe it was something she needed to hear as a wake-up call to her." ...|$|E
2500|$|Over the years, as jazz music {{developed}} and grew in complexity, scat singing did as well. During the bop era, more highly developed vocal improvisation surged in popularity. Annie Ross, a bop singer, expressed a common sentiment among vocalists at the time: [...] "The [...] music was so exciting, <b>everyone</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> do it." [...] And many did: Ella Fitzgerald, Eddie Jefferson, Betty Carter, Anita O'Day, Joe Carroll, Sarah Vaughan, Carmen McRae, Jon Hendricks, Babs Gonzales, and Dizzy Gillespie were all singers in the idiom. Fitzgerald once hailed {{herself as the}} [...] "best vocal improviser jazz has ever had", and critics since then have been in almost universal agreement with her.|$|E

Sonic Youth mentioned SST often in interviews and in music writer Michael Azerrad's estimation, [...] "seemed to be actively campaigning to get signed to the indie powerhouse"; in turn, Sonic Youth was instrumental in getting SST to sign Dinosaur Jr. Gerard Cosloy, owner of Dinosaur Jr's previous label Homestead Records, said, [...] "SST was the label <b>everyone</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> be on [...] Everyone's favorite bands were on the label; SST was funnier and cooler and it also had the machinery." ...|$|E

Daniel's arrival was first teased by executive producer Jason Herbison in November 2013, who said a new family member for Paul Robinson (Stefan Dennis) would be introduced the following year. The character's arrival was officially confirmed on 2 December and the casting department began auditions for the role, with producers stating that he would need to resemble his screen parents. Dennis said the process was long as <b>everyone</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> find the right actor for the part. Dennis was [...] "heavily involved" [...] in the casting.

2500|$|A muster of {{the militia}} during the 1820s or 30s was often an {{impressive}} occasion. In more populous areas of the eastern states the local militia company sometimes drilled as often as once a month. But where travel was difficult, as in most of early Arkansas, musters usually took place {{once or twice a}} year. The legislature of 1827 specified that battalion drills were to be held annually in October, and company drills were to be held at least twice a year, the first Saturday in April and October. [...] Through the years the date of July 4 evolved as an important mustering time in Arkansas. That was a convenient date to drill since the crops were generally planted by that time, and besides, <b>everyone</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> have an excuse for a get-together on Independence Day. The muster might begin with the firing of a volley, {{as was the case in}} 1837 when Captain Albert Pike's artillery company put on quite a show for the residents of Arkansas' capital city. It is difficult to reconstruct the precise manner in which muster training was carried out for few sources exist on the subject. However, it is likely that training was informal, with a good deal of marching and some practice in the manual of arms. Target shooting frequently was included in the day's activities. It is also likely that the muster ended with a large dinner or party, including a liberal mount of whiskey drinking. Sometimes the heavy whiskey drinking began before the muster actually got under way.|$|E
2500|$|The lead single, had an on air, on sale release, Roberts {{stated that}} Universal Records wanted {{to release the}} track that way, {{as it was the}} way they were {{releasing}} all of their new work. The release of this nature, was due to illegal downloading, and the record label was attempting to avoid illegal downloads as much as possible as Roberts stated, [...] "it's now harder for artists". Talking of Girls Aloud, Roberts stated she was used to releasing a song after around six weeks of promotion, including radio, television and press promotion, and commented that it was [...] "very scary" [...] to release a song without this publicity. She also noted the effect of this kind of release against chart positions, she said, [...] "I think it's harder for the public now because it's always been about the chart position. I also think it takes the excitement out of the charts because it's not a competition anymore." [...] The album artwork and track-listing were confirmed on 22 August 2011 on Roberts official website, the announcement came with confirmation that fans who pre-ordered the album on Play.com would receive a signed poster, and those who pre-ordered the song from digital store iTunes would have an exclusive highlight video montage of her webisode series Through Nicola's Eyes. Roberts performed at G-A-Y, after rehearsing the entire day prior to the event during which time she changed her set-list around, performing the track [...] "Everybody's Got to Learn Sometime" [...] with a drum and bass edit, in addition to performing a remix of her single [...] "Lucky Day". For the performance Roberts wore five-foot hair extensions that touched the ground, which proved restricting for her movements, in addition to wearing shorts with [...] "big pompoms on the back". Writing as a guest blogger for site Holy Moly, Roberts discussed the event saying [...] "the crowd was incredible.
