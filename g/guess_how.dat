25|$|In 1967, Barker {{hosted the}} {{short-lived}} game show The Family Game for Chuck Barris, where he asked children contestants {{questions about their}} families' lives, and the parents had to <b>guess</b> <b>how</b> they answered, similar to The Newlywed Game.|$|E
25|$|Each round has a {{different}} Category: Memory and Strategy, Speed and Agility, and Trivia and Knowledge. In the Memory and Strategy rounds, players {{have to focus on}} cards before they flip and <b>guess</b> <b>how</b> many objects there were after the cards flip, or memorize what were used or happened in Disney Movies. In the Speed and Agility rounds, Players have to guess which object is odd after it is done spinning, or answers other questions quickly. And in the Trivia and Knowledge rounds, players have to guess trivia questions about Disney movies.|$|E

25|$|As {{a result}} of leaving King's College for Birkbeck College, Franklin was asked by John Randall {{to give up her}} work on DNA. When it became clear to Wilkins and the {{supervisors}} of Watson and Crick that Franklin was going to the new job, and that Linus Pauling was working on the structure of DNA, they were willing to share Franklin's data with Watson and Crick, in the hope that they could find a good model of DNA before Pauling was able. Franklin's X-ray diffraction data for DNA and her systematic analysis of DNA's structural features was useful to Watson and Crick in guiding them towards a correct molecular model. The key problem for Watson and Crick, which could not be resolved by the data from King's College, was to <b>guess</b> <b>how</b> the nucleotide bases pack into the core of the DNA double helix.|$|E
500|$|Promoted acting wing {{commander}} in June 1943, Arthur became wing leader of No.71 Wing, which controlled No.75 Squadron {{and three other}} combat units. On 5November, {{he was involved in}} a collision at Kiriwina Airfield with a Spitfire of No.79 Squadron. The Spitfire pilot was killed, and Arthur received serious burns. He later recalled, [...] "...I felt my hands disappear, felt my face go but the rest of my body was...was just flames...And {{then all of a sudden}} the flames dropped down a bit and I got out and went like mad and I was running away from the aircraft and trying to <b>guess</b> <b>how</b> far I could go before I'd try to put the flames out..." [...] Although his family was informed that his injuries were [...] "of a very slight nature" [...] and that he had been [...] "burnt but not badly", Arthur was close to death for weeks while he was treated in Kiriwina. [...] He was finally repatriated to Sydney where he underwent plastic surgery at Yaralla Military Hospital (now Concord Hospital). After his recovery in April 1944, he attended a staff course before taking over command of No.2 Operational Training Unit at Mildura, Victoria. In August, at the age of 24, he was promoted to temporary group captain, the youngest in the RAAF. That December he took command of No.81 Wing of the Australian First Tactical Air Force (No.1 TAF), based at Noemfoor and Labuan in the Dutch East Indies.|$|E

2500|$|... the {{possible}} combinations are huge: 27 letters if you include the final forms × 9 niqqudim (more {{if we consider}} biblical niqqud) × cantillation marks. This means for an algorithm based on classification (such as Jochre), there are far too many classes, and it’s virtually impossible to get sufficient representation in an annotated training corpus. It {{would be better to}} imagine a two-pass algorithm: the first pass recognizes the letter, and the second pass recognizes the diacritics (niqqud + cantillation). However, this would require development in Jochre – it’s hard to <b>guess</b> <b>how</b> much without analyzing further. Note that Yiddish doesn’t suffer from the same difficulty, since there is very little niqqud used, and only in certain fixed places (e.g. komets aleph, etc.).|$|E
2500|$|In later studies {{published}} in 1967, Sutton and colleagues had subjects guess {{whether they would}} hear one click or two clicks. [...] They again observed a positivity around 300ms after the second click occurred – or would have occurred, {{in the case of}} the single click. [...] They also had subjects <b>guess</b> <b>how</b> long the interval between clicks might be, and in this case, the late positivity occurred 300ms after the second click. [...] This shows two important findings: first, that this late positivity occurred when uncertainty about the type of click was resolved, and second, that even an absence of a stimulus would elicit the late positive complex, if said stimulus was relevant to the task. [...] These early studies encouraged the use of ERP methods to study cognition and provided a foundation for the extensive work on the P300 in the decades that followed.|$|E
2500|$|The Power of Veto {{is a power}} first {{introduced}} in Big Brother 3. During its first season, it did not allow a nominated HouseGuest to use it on themselves. The final Power of Veto that season was the Golden Power of Veto, and allowed a nominated HouseGuest to remove themself from the block. Following this, the Golden Power of Veto was used in all subsequent seasons. The Diamond Power of Veto, used in Big Brother 12 allowed one HouseGuest to remove themselves from the block, as well as choose the replacement nominee only moments before the live eviction. Power of Veto competitions differ drastically from the Head of Household competition, with PoV competitions being more skill based in nature. Competitions such as the [...] "Pop Goes the Veto!" [...] competition, which required HouseGuest to find letter tiles and spell the longest word, {{have been used in}} numerous consecutive seasons. Competitions such as the [...] "Big Brother Boardwalk" [...] competition see HouseGuests attempting to <b>guess</b> <b>how</b> much of an item there is; this is one of various competitions that do not require HouseGuests to compete in a physical based competition. The [...] "How Bad Do You Want It?" [...] Power of Veto competition, {{first introduced}} in the seventh season, saw HouseGuests taking punishments in exchange for advancing in the competition. Variations of this competition have been used in numerous subsequent seasons. HouseGuests Janelle Pierzina, Daniele Donato & Paul Abrahamian currently hold the record for most Power of Veto wins in a single season, with five wins each. HouseGuests James Zinkand, Frank Eudy, and Shane Meaney all hold the record for most consecutive Power of Veto wins, with three each.|$|E

2500|$|By {{the end of}} March, {{veterinary}} organizations {{reported more}} than 100 pet deaths amongst nearly 500 cases of kidney failure, and experts expected the death toll to number in the thousands, with one online database already self-reporting as many as 3,600 deaths as of 11 April. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration has received reports of approximately 8500 animal deaths, including at least 1950 cats and 2200 dogs who have died after eating contaminated food, but have only confirmed 14 cases, in part {{because there is no}} centralized government database of animal sickness or death in the United States as there are with humans (such as the Centers for Disease Control). For this reason, many sources speculate {{the full extent of the}} pet deaths and sicknesses caused by the contamination may never be known. In October, the results of the [...] "AAVLD survey of pet food-induced nephrotoxicity in North America, April to June 2007," [...] were reported, indicating 347 of 486 cases voluntarily reported by 6 June 2007 had met the diagnostic criteria, with most of the cases reported from the United States, but also including cases of 20 dogs and 7 cats reported from Canada.The cases involved 235 cats and 112 dogs, with 61 percent of the cats and 74 percent of the dogs having died. Dr. Barbara Powers, AAVLD president and director of the Colorado State University Veterinary Diagnostic Laboratory, said the survey probably found only a percentage of the actual cases. She also said the mortality rate is not likely to be representative of all cases, because survey respondents had more information to submit for animals that had died. A number of dogs were also reported affected in Australia, with four in Melbourne and a few more in Sydney. No legal action or repercussions have as yet occurred regarding these cases. Dr. Powers elaborated further: “But there absolutely could be more deaths from the tainted pet food.... This survey didn’t catch all the deaths that happened. In order to be counted in our survey, you had to meet certain criteria.... If someone had a pet that died and they buried it in their back, they weren’t eligible for our survey. We had to have confirmed exposure to the recalled pet food, proof of toxicity, and clinical signs of renal failure. So this is only a percentage of the deaths that are out there. There’s no way to <b>guess</b> <b>how</b> many pets were affected.” ...|$|E

Her mother had always been silent, though often with greater cause for remonstrance; and poor Violet, imagining herself a burden, would not for the world have made herself more troublesome than she could help. Her whole desire was to win a smile, a fond word, a caress, and she sat watching as if those were life to her; her cheeks burning with eagerness so much that Arthur little <b>guessed</b> <b>how</b> wan they were in his absence.|$|R
