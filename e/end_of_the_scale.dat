5|$|On one <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>scale,</b> Kota Kinabalu may {{sometimes}} only refer to, especially by local inhabitants, the city centre or {{central business district}} near the sea facing Gaya Island. On the other <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>scale,</b> it may also refer to the metropolitan area which includes urban Kota Kinabalu (Greater Kota Kinabalu), and the surrounding towns of Papar and Kinarut in the south, and Tuaran and Tamparuli in the north, being within its zone of influence.|$|E
5|$|The {{outcome of}} a {{successful}} military campaign could vary in {{its impact on the}} defeated polity. In some cases, entire cities were sacked, and never resettled, as at Aguateca. In other instances, the victors would seize the defeated rulers, their families, and patron gods. The captured nobles and their families could be imprisoned, or sacrificed. At the least severe <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>scale,</b> the defeated polity would be obliged to pay tribute to the victor.|$|E
5|$|Christians at {{the time}} of Constantine's {{conversion}} made up only 10% of the population. This would rise to 50% {{by the end of the}} fourth century and 90% by the end of the fifth century. Emperor Justinian I (r. 527–565) then brutally mopped up the rest of the pagans, highly literate academics on one <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>scale</b> and illiterate peasants on the other. A conversion so rapid seems to have been rather the result of expediency than of conviction.|$|E

5|$|The French {{approach}} to funding memorials also relied mainly on voluntary fundraising, but featured {{a greater role}} for the state. A law passed in 1919 provided for a subsidy from central government to local authorities to assist in building memorials; the money was distributed {{in proportion to the}} number of local citizens who had died in the war. Nonetheless the largest French projects, such as the Ossuary of Douaumont, were still paid for mostly through private fund raising across France and the international community: it could take many years to raise the sums required. The Ossuary cost 15 m francs to build; at the other <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>scale,</b> more modest urban memorials cost around 300,000 francs.|$|E
5|$|The {{governor}} received {{money from}} the Crown to support the prisoners, with the amount varying on rank: the governor received 19 livres a day for each political prisoner – with conseiller-grade nobles receiving 15 livres – and, at the other <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>scale,</b> three livres a day for each commoner. Even for the commoners, this sum was around twice the daily wage of a labourer and provided for an adequate diet, while the upper classes ate very well: even critics of the Bastille recounted many excellent meals, often taken with the governor himself. Prisoners who were being punished for misbehaviour, however, could have their diet restricted as a punishment. The medical treatment provided by the Bastille for prisoners was excellent {{by the standards of}} the 18th century; the prison also contained a number of inmates suffering from mental illnesses and took, {{by the standards of the}} day, a very progressive attitude to their care.|$|E
5|$|The {{north face}} {{is also one}} of Scotland's {{foremost}} venues for winter mountaineering and ice climbing, and holds snow until quite late in the year; in a good year, routes may remain in winter condition until mid-spring. Most of the possible rock routes are also suitable as winter climbs, including the four main ridges; Tower Ridge, for example, is grade IV on the Scottish winter grading system, having been upgraded in 2009 by the Scottish Mountaineering Club after requests by the local Mountain Rescue Team, there being numerous benightments and incidents every winter season. Probably the most popular ice climb on Ben Nevis is The Curtain (IV,5) {{on the left side of}} the Càrn Dearg Buttress. At the top <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>scale,</b> Centurion in winter is a grade VIII,8 face climb.|$|E

5|$|The {{proposal}} was strongly opposed by both environmentalists {{as well as}} local residents. The economy of southeastern British Columbia is strongly dependent on tourism, with the Columbia River, including Columbia Lake and Windermere Lake, being very popular for summer swimming and boating activities. Diversion of the glacier-fed Kootenay River would have resulted in the Columbia River becoming much deeper and colder, flooding riverside communities and damaging tourism. At the opposite <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>scale,</b> it would dry the bed of the Kootenay River downstream of Canal Flats, cutting off water supply to residents of the upper Kootenay Valley and invalidating the effectiveness of Libby Dam, whose construction was to begin in a few years. As a result, this proposed river diversion was never undertaken.|$|E

50|$|Rationalism in {{politics}} is often seen as the midpoint in the three major political viewpoints of realism, rationalism, and internationalism.

50|$|One way to {{distinguish}} between them is by their cones. Each has barbs at <b>the</b> <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>scales.</b> <b>The</b> sharp Jeffrey pine cone scale barbs point inward, so the cone feels smooth to <b>the</b> palm <b>of</b> one's hand when rubbed down the cone. Ponderosa pine cone scale barbs point outward, so feel sharp and prickly to <b>the</b> palm <b>of</b> one's hands. Another distinguishing characteristic is that <b>the</b> needles <b>of</b> Jeffrey pine are glaucous, less bright green than those of ponderosa pine, and by the stouter, heavier cones with larger seeds and inward-pointing barbs.|$|R
25|$|At one <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>scale</b> we have 100% {{maternal}} involvement – {{as depicted}} by the upbringing {{of the sisters}} de Granville (A Daughter of Eve) later Mesdames Felix de Vandenesse and du Tillet.|$|E

5000|$|Visual {{analogue}} <b>scale</b> is <b>the</b> {{second part}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> questionnaire, asking to mark health status on <b>the</b> day <b>of</b> <b>the</b> interview on a 20 cm vertical scale with <b>end</b> points <b>of</b> 0 and 100.

25|$|The first {{interesting}} observation {{was that}} there is no sharp dividing line between alcoholics and non-alcoholics.

25|$|Like other {{conditions}} intimately related to access to hygiene and basic medical monitoring and care, periodontitis {{tends to be}} more common in economically disadvantaged populations or regions. Its occurrence decreases with a higher standard of living. In Israeli population, individuals of Yemenite, North-African, South Asian, or Mediterranean origin have higher prevalence of periodontal disease than individuals from European descent. Periodontitis is frequently reported to be socially patterned, i.e. people from <b>the</b> lower <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> socioeconomic <b>scale</b> suffer more often from it than people from <b>the</b> upper <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> socioeconomic <b>scale.</b>|$|R
25|$|At {{the other}} <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>scale,</b> there were {{representations}} from countries and areas where a detailed and sophisticated classification was irrelevant, but which nevertheless needed a classification {{based on the}} ICD {{in order to assess}} their progress in health care and in the control of disease. A field test with a bi-axial classification approach—one axis (criterion) for anatomy, with another for etiology—showed the impracticability of such approach for routine use.|$|E
25|$|The New Zealand {{team was}} in a state of transition, with older players such as John Reid and Bert Sutcliffe, who had both first come to England with the 1949 New Zealand side, nearing retirement.
