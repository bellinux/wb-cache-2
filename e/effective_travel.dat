40|$|Traffic flow {{fluctuation}} and traffic signal interruption result in turn delay variations at signalized intersections. Such variations can significantly contribute to road users' travel time uncertainties and affect their route choices in congested urban areas. A reliability-based stochastic user equilibrium (RSUE) model is proposed {{to investigate the}} effects of turn delay uncertainties on the route choice problem. In the proposed model, link travel times and turn delays are considered as correlated random variables with covariance relationships. Differences in these variables are mainly due to uncertainties at signalized intersections and day-to-day fluctuations in demand. Given these uncertainties, the concept of <b>effective</b> <b>travel</b> time is adopted to model the route choice behaviors of road users. The RSUE model also considers the perception errors of road users on <b>effective</b> <b>travel</b> times. A path-based solution algorithm is adapted to solve the RSUE problem. Finally, a numerical example illustrates {{the application of the}} proposed model and solution algorithm. Sensitivity tests are used to demonstrate the potential use of the proposed model to assess the accident risks at signalized intersections with heavy turning flows.

In the distribution of goods as well as systems responding to calls for emergency, demands typically occur in a random fashion.

40|$|This paper {{proposes a}} {{cell-based}} multi-class dynamic traffic assignment problem that considers the random evolution of traffic states. Travelers {{are assumed to}} select routes based on perceived <b>effective</b> <b>travel</b> time, where <b>effective</b> <b>travel</b> time {{is the sum of}} mean travel time and safety margin. The proposed problem is formulated as a fixed point problem, which includes a Monte-Carlo-based stochastic cell transmission model to capture the effect of physical queues and the random evolution of traffic states during flow propagation. The fixed point problem is solved by the self-regulated averaging method. Numerical examples are set up to illustrate the properties of the problem and the effectiveness of the solution method. The key findings include the following: i) Reducing perception errors on traffic conditions {{may not be able to}} reduce the uncertainty of estimating system performance, ii) Using the self-regulated averaging method can give a much faster rate of convergence in most test cases compared with using the method of successive averages, iii) The combination of the values of the step size parameters highly affects the speed of convergence, iv) A higher demand, a better information quality, or a higher degree of the risk aversion can lead to a higher computation time, v) More driver classes do not necessary results in a longer computation time, and vi) Computation time can be significantly reduced by using small sample sizes in the early stage of solution processes...|$|E

40|$|In {{this work}} an {{alternative}} method, respect today’s tipical road survey, is presented. Tipically, a road survey {{is carried out}} by a team composed by three operators at least, that moves with a vehicle on which an odometer is mounted on the rear {{in order to measure}} the <b>effective</b> <b>travelled</b> road. Given this operational procedure, a road survey requires, as a rule, a lot of time, resulting therefore very laborious and expensive regarding the employement of economic and human resources. Possible solutions to these problems could be represented by integration of Computer Vision technology with modern satellite positioning system, as GPS. Also in agreement with this idea, GeoVision, a digital photogrammetric software for road survey, has been developed at the University of Padua (Italy). The system consists of a van equipped with two digital cameras, Sony XC 75 CE recording in continous way the surveyed environment and a GPS receiver that provides post-processed differential positions. From a pair of correspondent digital images, the 3 D position of a feature can be determined in a global reference system (namely WGS- 84), by integration of photogrammetric triangulation techniques and computer vision algoritms. In following sections the tools regarding digital image processing subsystem of GeoVision will be described in detail...|$|R

30|$|In conclusion, {{we offer}} an {{approach}} for supporting reasoning about agent trust with advice from peers, whose trustworthiness is then also modeled, when non-numeric reports are provided and {{have shown the}} merit of our framework {{in the context of}} the VANET application (resulting in <b>effective</b> <b>travel</b> decisions due to the modeling of trustworthiness). As such, we offer a method that supports the exchange of more detailed trustworthiness information, leading to more precise and valuable calculations. We have outlined our method for integrating various reports from peers in full detail. We have also clarified in depth how communication between peers would take place, through a combination of push and pull protocols, in order to assure effective exchange of real-time information and to extend the original model of Minhas et al. [1]-[3] which left as underspecified the exchange of information between agents, for <b>effective</b> <b>travel</b> decision making. Our overall solution integrates a number of novel modeling elements (priority roads, suspicious reports) which support the final algorithm that is presented. The detailed simulation framework allows for the adjustment of a wide variety of parameters which have been implemented to draw out the benefit of the full combination of our methods for trust modeling for effective transportation decisions that support exchange of traffic information. Included here is a method for simulating a dearth of experience for experience-based trust (our sparsity parameter), which can be varied in the experiments and a variable to model the extent to which agents in the environment have specific roles which may increase their trustworthiness (the role parameter). In all, with our testbed we offer an avenue for measuring the relative benefit of different trust modeling options. Parts of this research were presented at the TRUM workshop at UMAP 2012 [29].|$|E

We introduce a new floor based audio-haptic interface for providing virtual collision feedback, the soundfloor. With this device, haptic feedback can be provided through the floor of a projection VR system, without disturbing the visual presentation on the same floor. As the impact of feedback is not yet known for virtual travel, we also present a series of experiments that compare different feedback methods coupled with classic collision handling methods. The results of the experiments show only limited benefits of collision handling and of additional feedback for performance. However, user preference of context appropriate feedback is evident, as well as a preference for the floor based haptic feedback. The experiments provide evidence of best practices for handling virtual travel collisions, namely that context appropriate feedback should be preferred and that quality sounds are sufficient when haptics cannot be provided...|$|E
