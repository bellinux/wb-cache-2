Celebrating the end of his five-year ban from political activity on 15 April 2008, he told reporters: [...] "We are here to counter the massive propaganda campaign by Umno leaders, who are talking on Malay supremacy. And giving clear definitive answer in reply of this, to say that what we want, what we desire for is a new Malaysia, is supremacy for all Malaysians." [...] A week later, his wife Wan Azizah Wan Ismail, president of PKR, told the press that [...] "we should not <b>keep</b> <b>talking</b> about Malay supremacy or marginalising a certain race, which is not what the people want to see," [...] urging instead the adoption of ketuanan rakyat.|$|E

500|$|In July 2012, actors Hiroyuki Sanada, Hal Yamanouchi, Tao Okamoto and Rila Fukushima {{had been}} cast as Shingen, Ichirō, Mariko and Yukio, respectively. Additionally, Will Yun Lee was cast as Harada, and Brian Tee as Noburo Mori. By July 2012, Deadline.com said Jessica Biel would play Viper. However, at the 2012 San Diego Comic-Con International, Biel said {{her role in}} the film was [...] "not a done deal", explaining, [...] "People <b>keep</b> <b>talking</b> about this. I don't know {{anything}} about it. It's a little bit too soon for that kind of an announcement". A few days later, negotiations between Biel and 20th Century Fox had broken down. Later in July, Fox had begun talks with Svetlana Khodchenkova to take over the role. Somewhat unusually for action movies, The Wolverine features four female lead roles and [...] "passes the Bechdel Test early and often", according to Vulture.

500|$|... "The Queen and I" [...] {{features}} extensive {{samples from}} ABBA's [...] "Dancing Queen", often overlain with a rasping detuned accompaniment. These lead into Drummond's satirical and discontent rapping, a fictional {{account of his}} march into the British House of Commons and Buckingham Palace to demand answers. The song also protests the involvement of cigarette companies in sport ("When cancer is the killer/John Player run the league") and lambasts the [...] "tabloid mentality" [...] ("They all <b>keep</b> <b>talking</b> about Princess Di's dress"). The Sex Pistols' [...] "God Save the Queen" [...] is briefly sampled. After nearly three minutes of samples from the television show Top of the Pops, as well as sound clips from programmes and advertisements on other TV channels, Drummond cries [...] "Fuck that, let's have The JAMs!". The acerbic [...] "All You Need Is Love (106 bpm)" [...] follows.

2500|$|Soda Stereo was the {{beginning}} of a globalization movement that incorporated local musicians into a great continental rock movement, up to the point of leading local critics to wonder: [...] "Does it make sense to <b>keep</b> <b>talking</b> about [...] "national rock [...] "?". In many parts of Latin America, including Colombia, [...] "Soda Stereo became the expression of the musicality and poise of a new generation, one which tried to differentiate themselves from that of those in their thirties in the 1980s who preferred the Dominican merengue, by beginning to listen and sing rock in Spanish." [...] In Chile, Soda not only marked a whole generation with their looks, lyrics and music, but especially by way of the intense emotional relationship developed between the band and its fans, which was a decisive factor to [...] "de-nationalize" [...] the band and make it an expression, and not only young people in a particular country, but youth as a sector uniform social issues and common languages, something that rock and roll had not been achieved so far in the Spanish-speaking countries due to language barrier.|$|E

2500|$|Also {{once again}} turning {{out for this}} tour was John Robb who again ecstatically {{reviewed}} the Manchester date of the tour (14 December 2011 at the HMV Ritz) for his Louder Than War website. [...] Robb singled out for particular praise new album track Vince Taylor (about the 1960s musician of that name) which was premiered on the tour. [...] "Vince Taylor is primetime Adam Ant. It sounds like those off the wall early pop songs like 'Young Parisians' crossed with the 3D filmscapes of the 'Kings of the Wild Frontier' album and sounds like a potential single with its nagging riff in the verses and its great melody. It's great to hear a new song in a near two-hour set of Ant classics and obscurities and is a hint at the healthy future of this remarkable comeback from Adam... People <b>keep</b> <b>talking</b> about the best new band of the year. In a weird way here it is {{right in front of}} you.

2500|$|Papen {{was deeply}} embittered {{by the way}} his former best friend, Schleicher, had brought him down, and having {{acquired}} a taste for power, Papen {{was determined to be}} Chancellor again. On 16 December 1932, Papen delivered a speech before the Herrenklub attacking Schleicher and demanding that the NSDAP be included in the government. Schleicher did not see Papen as a threat at all the Chancellor's Chief of Staff Erwin Planck told a group of journalists: [...] "Let him [...] talk, he's completely insignificant. No one takes him seriously. Herr von Papen is a pompous ass. This speech is the swan song of a bad loser". It was Papen who initialed contacts with Hitler as he was consumed, in the words of Kolb, with [...] "wounded ambition and a desire for revenge", becoming full of an obsessive hatred for his former best friend Schleicher. Papen contacted a friend, the Cologne banker Baron Kurt von Schröder who also happened to be a NSDAP member, in late December 1932 to ask him to pass on a message to Hitler saying that Hindenburg's previously warm relations with Schleicher were cooling and that he wanted to meet Hitler to discuss a common strategy against Schleicher. On 4 January 1933, Hitler and Papen met at {{what was supposed to be}} a secret meeting at Schröder's house in Cologne. Hitler spent much of the meeting ranting about how he should have been named Chancellor in August 1932 after his party won the largest number of seats in the Reichstag with Papen telling the lie that he had tried to persuade Hindenburg to appoint Hitler Chancellor that August, but had been blocked by Schleicher (the opposite was the case). For his part, Papen revealed a marked degree of hatred for Schleicher, with Goebbels writing in his diary afterwards: [...] "He [...] wants to bring about his [...] fall and get rid of him completely". The principal problem that emerged at the Cologne meeting was the question of who was to be Chancellor, as Papen insisted on having that office for himself whereas Hitler insisted equally vehemently on his [...] "all or nothing" [...] strategy of opposing every government not headed by himself, but the two agreed to <b>keep</b> <b>talking.</b> Papen had strengthened Hitler's hand by revealing to him that Hindenburg had not given Schleicher a decree dissolving the Reichstag nor was likely to do so, which meant when the Reichstag met after its Christmas break on 31 January 1933, it would be possible to bring a vote of no confidence against Schleicher without worrying about new elections.|$|E
