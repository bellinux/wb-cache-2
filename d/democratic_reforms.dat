5|$|There {{was a time}} {{of civil}} strife in Bahrain from 1994 to 1999, during which leftists, liberals and Islamists joined forces to demand <b>democratic</b> <b>reforms.</b> The {{uprising}} was the largest in the country's history, and included widespread demonstrations and violence.|$|E
5|$|The {{sections}} of the International that recognised {{the leadership of the}} International Secretariat remained optimistic about the possibilities for increasing the International's political influence and extended the entrism into social democratic parties which was already underway in Britain, Austria and elsewhere. The 1954 congress emphasised entrism into communist parties and nationalist parties in the colonies, pressing for <b>democratic</b> <b>reforms,</b> ostensibly to encourage the left-wing they perceived to exist in the communist parties to join with them in a revolution. Tensions developed between those who subscribed to the mainstream views of Pablo and a minority that argued unsuccessfully against open work. A number of these delegates walked out of the World Congress, and would eventually leave the International, including the leader of the new British section, John Lawrence, George Clarke, Michele Mestre (a leader of the French section), and Murray Dowson (a leader of the Canadian group).|$|E
5|$|It is {{distinguished}} by its position against the French absolute monarchy, support for religious tolerance, including for Jansenism, support for <b>democratic</b> <b>reforms</b> {{such as the}} introduction of parliaments, support for the American independence and the Polish Constitution of May 3, 1791. The newspaper preferred to praise the changes in Poland (the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth) more than those in France, criticizing {{the violence of the}} French Revolution, and contrasting it with the peaceful transformation in Poland. This relative lack of support for the French Revolution may explain why the paper was abolished on 23 April 1798, three years after the invasion of the Netherlands by France and the Batavian Revolution. It reappeared as the Nouvelles politiques publiées à Leyde in October, but it was seen as no longer independent. Under a new name—Journal politique publié à Leyde—it lasted from 1804 until 1811, but it never regained its audience and its quality, and disappeared after the annexation of Holland by the French Empire. A new Leyden Gazette briefly appeared after the liberation of Holland in 1814.|$|E

5|$|The {{visit to}} the US was the high point in Diệm's {{relations}} with his primary sponsor. The Americans began to place increasing pressure on Diệm to carry out <b>democratic</b> <b>reforms</b> and liberalize the political system, particularly during ambassadorship of Elbridge Durbrow. Diệm resisted the calls to broaden {{the base of his}} government and continued to rig elections. Meanwhile in the US, his support among the AFV also declined, in part due to his ongoing authoritarianism, and also because of his persistent complaints to them about negative media depictions of his regime; many Vietnamese leaders of various persuasions did not understand that western governments did not control their own media. Pressure also increased on Diệm at home, as the communists intensified their insurgency against him. In November 1960, discontent in his own army prompted a failed coup attempt by paratroopers. Although Diệm eventually organized for loyalists to put down the coup, he was angered by Durbrow's calls for him to try to negotiate a settlement, regarding the lack of support for his zero tolerance policy as a betrayal.|$|E
5|$|Wooller was a {{dissident}} {{member of the}} Institute of Chartered Accountants in England and Wales (ICAEW). In 1991, Wooller accused the ICAEW of having built-in bias when it marked examinations during a recession, and used PE II (Professional Education II) results to show the bias. Wooller was fined by the ICAEW in 1995 for promoting unaccredited MBA courses. Wooller formed a ginger group when the ICAEW tried to merge with the Chartered Institute of Management Accountants (CIMA) in 1995. Wooller's ginger group opposed many {{of the actions of}} the ICAEW. The merger was shelved after the majority of the ICAEW members voted against it. The ginger group decided to keep fighting for <b>democratic</b> <b>reforms</b> and in June 1996, demanded that the executive of the ICAEW be elected directly by the 109,000 members of the body, instead of by the ICAEW's council of seventy members. A year later, Wooller demanded that members of the ICAEW be allowed to vote on Peter Gerrard's key constitutional reform proposals, and Wooller's motion failed by 1,400 votes, including proxies.|$|E

An early announcement asked the media to call it by its full name, the Council for <b>Democratic</b> <b>Reform</b> under the Constitutional Monarchy (CDRM), rather than just the Council for <b>Democratic</b> <b>Reform</b> (CDR). The junta said that the public might be misled if it wasn't understood that the junta was working [...] "under the Constitutional Monarchy". Later, the junta formally shortened its English name (but not its Thai name) to Council for <b>Democratic</b> <b>Reform</b> (CDR) in order to avoid any suspicions {{about the role of the}} monarchy in the coup.|$|R

Wildcat strikes had become common in the coal industry as union miners grew frustrated with what they saw as poor terms of national contracts and employer foot-dragging on resolving disputes and grievances. Miller hoped that these <b>democratic</b> <b>reforms</b> would decrease the number of wildcat strikes.|$|E
