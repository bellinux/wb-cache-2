The results show that under <b>dry</b> <b>sliding</b> and SBF conditions, the friction coefficient declines with increasing applied load and keeps stable with prolonging sliding time. The friction coefficient of the alloy effectively decreases in SBF as compared to <b>dry</b> <b>sliding</b> due to lubrication caused by SBF. The real wear rates under SBF condition are lower than those under <b>dry</b> <b>sliding</b> condition for each parameter. Nevertheless, the nominal wear rates are higher in SBF which are attributed to the more mass loss caused by corrosion but not wear. Both the nominal wear rate in SBF and the <b>dry</b> <b>sliding</b> wear rate increase with increasing applied load, and they decline firstly and then keep stable with prolonging sliding time. It is concluded that the wear of the alloy is restricted by the SBF, but the corrosion of the alloy is aggravated by the wear...|$|E

In the present investigation, the effects of SiC particles as fillers in glass–epoxy (G–E) composite systems on the mechanical and tribological properties have been discussed. The composites employed in the present study have been fabricated using hand lay-up technique. The mechanical properties such as tensile strength, tensile modulus, elongation at break, flexural strength, and hardness have been investigated in accordance with ASTM standards. From the experimental investigation, it was found that the mechanical properties of the G–E composite increased with the inclusion of SiC filler. The <b>dry</b> <b>slide</b> wear test results of SiC-G–E composite show lower slide wear losses irrespective of the load/sliding velocity when compared to G–E composite. Some of these observations are supplemented by scanning electron microscopic (SEM) observations. Further, wear of the matrix, breakage of reinforcing fibers, matrix debris formation, and interface separation were observed. SEM microphotographs of the tensile fractured samples revealed the typical aspects of the fractured surfaces.
