50|$|Some {{people thought}} these suits might be so technologically {{advanced}} that using them in competition was essentially technology doping. After the Beijing Olympics and subsequent swimming events, at which many world records were broken by swimmers wearing the LZR suit, FINA (Fédération Internationale de Natation) banned all body-length swimsuits. Men's suits could only maximally cover {{from the waist}} to the knee. Women's suits could only cover from shoulder to knee. They also stipulated that the fabric {{used to make the}} suits must be a “textile” and the suit could not have <b>fastening</b> <b>devices,</b> such as zippers. These new rules took effect in January 2010.|$|E

The new policy states that men's swimsuits may maximally cover the area from the waist to the knee, and women's counterparts from the shoulder to the knee.

Folding stands typically have a foldable tripod that supports the column and the music shelf. The rack area for holding the music is either pre-set at a slight incline away from the performer (as compared with being straight up), so that a song book or étude book will lie open naturally, or the degree of incline can be adjusted by the performer (on more expensive stands).|$|E

50|$|The turf log was {{fastened}} to the roof boards and underlying rafters with naturally grown wooden hooks, preferably from durable juniper.

Turf logs are also {{known to have been}} held in place by rafters hewn from logs with one root branch left to form a bracket. This method made for extremely cumbersome maintenance. When the brackets disintegrated, one would have to tear up the whole roof to renew all the rafters. A more refined <b>fastening</b> <b>device</b> was the kolv, an elaborately shaped stick of wood, around 60 cm long, pegged to the roof and extended {{through a hole in the}} turf log.

50|$|Muzzles are {{sometimes}} used on untrained dogs, large or small, to prevent unwanted biting or scavenging.

Muzzles are also used on dogs when there is a risk of them taking baits that have been laid for vermin. The most suitable materials for dog muzzles are leather, nylon, plastic and others. The most comfortable muzzles for dogs are those with wire cage construction. Muzzles of this kind give enough freedom for a dog to eat, drink and freely pant. The latter two are of vital importance, especially in hot weather.|$|R
40|$|A {{composite}} piston {{structure is}} disclosed {{which provides a}} simple and reliable means for joining a carbon-carbon or ceramic piston cap with a metallic piston body.

The use of carbon-carbon for the piston cap material allows a close fit between the piston and a cylinder wall, eliminating the need for piston rings. The elimination of extra mechanical parts of previous composite pistons provides a lightweight composite piston capable of extended high temperature operation...|$|E

40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{determine}} the characteristics and {{the severity of}} head and facial injuries to helmeted child bicyclists, and whether the helmet contributed to the injury, and to study factors related to bicycle accidents. DESIGN: Retrospective review of two case series. Children sustaining head injury while not wearing helmets were studied {{as a form of}} reference group. SETTING: Large paediatric teaching hospital. SUBJECTS: 34 helmeted child bicyclists and 155 non-helmeted bicyclists, aged 5 - 14 years. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Number of injuries, type of injuries, injury severity score, deaths, and accident circumstances. RESULTS: 79 % of the head injuries of the helmeted child group were mild and two thirds of these had facial injuries. Children in the helmet group were in a greater proportion of bike-car collisions than the no helmet group and at least 15 % of the helmets were lost on impact. There were no injuries secondary to the helmet. CONCLUSIONS: Most of the head injuries sustained by the helmeted children were of mild severity and there was no evidence to suggest that the helmet contributed to injury. Nevertheless, consideration should be given to designing a facial protector for the bicycle helmet and to improvement of the <b>fastening</b> <b>device...</b>|$|R

In front of the occipital furrow that crosses the entire glabella, two pairs of dead-ending furrows, create three side lobes left and right. The front of the glabella also has three dead-ending furrows, a very short one on the midline and left and right a longer one, directed inward and slightly backward. A very efficient <b>fastening</b> <b>device</b> is unique in Pliomera. It consists of a row of 7 to 9 downward directed denticles along {{the front of the}} glabella, which interlocked with corresponding teeth on the pygidium, when the animal protected itself by enrolling.

The facial sutures in genus Pliomera itself are gonatoparian, while in the genus Placoparia these are opisthoparian, and this is unlike all other pliomerids where facial sutures are proparian. The thorax may have between 12 and 18 segments. The pygidium has 4 or 5 axial rings and small termination. The corresponding pleural segments are very well defined and end in tooth-like points, the last pair of which is completely embracing the small terminal axial segment.|$|R
