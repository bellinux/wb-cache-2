5000|$|Through the {{procedure}} called <b>ebullioscopy,</b> a known constant {{can be used}} to calculate an unknown molar mass. The term [...] "ebullioscopy" [...] comes from the Greek language and means [...] "boiling measurement." [...] This is related to cryoscopy, which determines the same value from the cryoscopic constant (of freezing point depression).|$|E
50|$|An {{ebullioscope}} (from the Latin ēbullīre (to boil) + -scope) is {{an instrument}} for measuring the boiling point of a liquid. This {{can be used for}} determining the alcoholic strength of a mixture, or for determining the molecular weight of a non-volatile solute based on the boiling-point elevation. The procedure is known as <b>ebullioscopy.</b>|$|E
5000|$|Through cryoscopy, a known {{constant}} {{can be used}} {{to calculate}} an unknown molar mass. The term [...] "cryoscopy" [...] comes from Greek and means [...] "freezing measurement." [...] Freezing point depression is a colligative property, so [...] depends only on the number of solute particles dissolved, not the nature of those particles. Cryoscopy is related to <b>ebullioscopy,</b> which determines the same value from the ebullioscopic constant (of boiling point elevation).|$|E
5000|$|Together {{with the}} formula above, the boiling-point {{elevation}} can in principle {{be used to}} measure the degree of dissociation or the molar mass of the solute. This kind of measurement is called <b>ebullioscopy</b> (Greek [...] "boiling-viewing"). However, since superheating is difficult to avoid, precise ΔTb measurements are difficult to carry out, which was partly overcome by the invention of the Beckmann thermometer. Furthermore, the cryoscopic constant that determines freezing-point depression is larger than the ebullioscopic constant, and since the freezing point is often easier to measure with precision, it is more common to use cryoscopy.|$|E
50|$|In 1887 Wilhelm Ostwald {{moved to}} Leipzig, and {{physical}} chemistry {{then became a}} focus of Beckmann's work, as he served {{as an assistant to}} Ostwald. Beckmann used the methods of <b>ebullioscopy</b> (boiling-point elevation) and cryoscopy (freezing-point depression) to determine the molecular masses of several substances. These measurements required a careful determination of temperature differences, as opposed to absolute values, and to accomplish them Beckmann invented the differential thermometer that now carries his name (Beckmann thermometer). For this work he altered the methods of François-Marie Raoult, and the improvement was sufficiently great that Beckmann's method, and the associated equipment, became standard in chemical laboratories. However, {{by the end of the}} twentieth century these colligative-property techniques had been largely superseded by molecular mass determinations using electronic instrumentation.|$|E
40|$|International audienceThe binary {{phase diagram}} NaBO 2 -H 2 O at ambient pressure, which defines the {{different}} phase equilibria {{that could be}} formed between borates, end-products of NaBH 4 hydrolysis, has been reviewed. Five different solid borates phases have been identified: NaBO 2 · 4 H 2 O (Na[B(OH) 4]· 2 H 2 O), NaBO 2 · 2 H 2 O (Na[B(OH) 4]), NaBO 2 · 2 / 3 H 2 O (Na 3 [B 3 O 4 (OH) 4]), NaBO 2 · 1 / 3 H 2 O (Na 3 [B 3 O 5 (OH) 2]) and NaBO 2 (Na 3 [B 3 O 6]), and their thermal stabilities have been studied. The boundaries of the different Liquid+Solid equilibria for the temperature range from- 10 to 80 °C have been determined, confirming literature data at low temperature (20 °C ~ 50 °C). Moreover the following eutectic transformation, Liq. → Ice + NaBO 2 · 4 H 2 O, occurring at- 7 °C, has been determined by DSC. The Liquid-Vapour domain has been studied by <b>ebullioscopy.</b> The invariant transformation Liq. → Vap. + NaBO 2 · 2 / 3 H 2 O has been estimated at 131. 6 °C. This knowledge is paramount {{in the field of}} hydrogen storage through NaBH 4 hydrolysis, in which borate compounds were obtained as hydrolysis reaction products. As a consequence, the authors propose a comparison with previous NaBO 2 -H 2 O binary phase diagrams and its consequence related to hydrogen storage through NaBH 4 hydrolysis...|$|E
