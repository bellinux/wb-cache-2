60|$|Every citizen {{loved his}} city and her greatness above all else. There was as yet little wealth among them; the richest owned {{little more than}} a few acres, which they {{cultivated}} themselves by the help of their families, and sometimes of a few slaves, and the beautiful Campagna di Roma, girt in by hills looking like amethysts in the distance, had not then become almost uninhabitable from pestilential air, but was rich and fertile, full of highly cultivated small farms, where corn was raised in furrows made by a small <b>hand</b> <b>plough,</b> and herds of sheep, goats, and oxen browsed in the pasture lands. The owners of these lands would on public days take off their rude working dress and broad-brimmed straw hat, and putting on the white toga with a purple hem, would enter the city, and go to the valley called the Forum or Marketplace to give their votes for the officers of state who were elected every year; especially the two consuls, who were like kings all but the crown, wore purple togas richly embroidered, sat on ivory chairs, and were followed by lictors carrying an axe in a bundle of rods for the execution of justice. In their own chamber sat the Senate, the great council composed of the patricians, or citizens of highest birth, and of those who had formerly been consuls. They decided on peace or war, and made the laws, and were the real governors of the State, and their grave dignity made a great impression on all who came near them. Above the buildings of the city rose steep and high the Capitoline Hill, with the Temple of Jupiter on its summit, and the strong wall in which was the chief stronghold and citadel of Rome, the Capitol, the very centre of her strength and resolution. When a war was decided on, every citizen capable of bearing arms was called into the Forum, bringing his helmet, breast plate, short sword, and heavy spear, and the officers called tribunes, chose out a sufficient number, who were formed into bodies called legions, and marched to battle under the command of one of the consuls. Many little States or Italian tribes, who had nearly the same customs as Rome, surrounded the Campagna, and so many disputes arose that every year, as soon as the crops were saved, the armies marched out, the flocks were driven to folds on the hills, the women and children were placed in the walled cities, and a battle was fought, sometimes followed up by the siege of the city of the defeated. The Romans did not always obtain the victory, but there was a staunchness about them that was sure to prevail in the long run; if beaten one year, they came back to the charge the next, and thus they gradually mastered one of their neighbors after another, and spread their dominion over the central part of Italy.|$|E
50|$|The Scotch plough or Scots plough (not to be {{confused}} with the Scottish <b>hand</b> <b>plough)</b> was a wood and iron, animal draft, primary tillage implement (plough) for use on heavy ground invented in the 19th century by James Anderson.|$|E
50|$|The second room houses genuine {{traditional}} womens costumes of {{the late}} 19th century (everyday wear and bridal outfits), woven textiles, embroidery, a number of objects for everyday domestic use (cauldrons, baking trays, cooking-pots, and plates), agricultural implements (most notably a <b>hand</b> <b>plough),</b> millstones, a wooden barrel for collecting grain at the mill, and jars for the pickles and cereals that were stored in the cellars in winter.|$|E

50|$|Based on {{existing}} successful {{farms in the}} district, soldier settlers were encouraged to grow grapes and citrus trees. Each soldier was granted favourable terms to purchase land and equipment up {{to the value of}} £625 ($1,250). This covered the purchase of the land, a four roomed house, a horse and cart, a 6” <b>hand</b> <b>plough,</b> a hand scuffler, a single section harrow and citrus trees and grape cuttings.|$|E
50|$|Across Balliol Street the new Cardwell Library, {{built in}} 2007-2008, can be visited for more {{information}} on the local history. Next to the library, which is also a Cassowary Coast Customer Service Centre, a large outdoor display facility houses local artefacts including an old tip dray and a springcart which was used in the area for many years. Cross-cut saws, a <b>hand</b> <b>plough,</b> a banana-case making machine, railway construction implements and other items are exhibited. Also near the library the old Cardwell School of Arts, which was the original town library, dating from the first decade of the nineteenth century, has also been refurbished. It now provides a home for local artists to display and sell their interesting art works.|$|E
50|$|The Museum of Folk Art is {{situated}} {{high on the}} hillside in the old schoolhouse. The museum houses various interesting artefacts from years gone by, {{many of which were}} used to cultivate small areas of land with wheat, chickpeas and barley. There are <b>hand</b> <b>ploughs</b> with stout wooden shafts and several large metal sieves used for sifting the soil. There are traditional costumes too, and there are faded old photographs of the village men resplendent in their vrakas and stout leather boots and the women in dresses of striped hand-woven cotton with matching headscarves and large protective aprons. The villagers would wear these costumes for all big celebrations and would weave the cloth on large wooden looms like the one that stands proudly in the corner, as well as making colourful rugs for the walls and floors of their homes.|$|R

60|$|I need hardly {{say that}} such a policy is not one that {{commands}} my sympathy, but Her Majesty's Government having put their <b>hand</b> to the <b>plough,</b> it is worth their while to consider it.

25|$|Coins {{dated to}} about 185-170 BCE from the Agathocles era show Balarama's {{iconography}} and Greek inscriptions.

60|$|I don't {{think that}} at first anybody troubled much about the debt on the church.

Let them but set their <b>hands</b> to the <b>plough</b> and they could soon guide it into the deep water. Then they might furl their sails and sit every man under his own olive tree.|$|R
60|$|After {{the first}} {{excitement}} of meeting, discussing, and deciding had passed, Myles {{began to feel}} {{the weight of the}} load he had so boldly taken upon himself.
