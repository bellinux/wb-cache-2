5|$|The exam {{is offered}} {{every year in}} May. Students are not {{expected}} to memorize any formulas; rather, a list of common statistical formulas related to <b>descriptive</b> <b>statistics,</b> probability, and inferential statistics is provided. Moreover, tables for the normal, Student's t and chi-squared distributions are given as well. Students are also expected to use graphing calculators with statistical capabilities. The exam is three hours long with ninety minutes allotted to complete each of its two sections: multiple choice and free-response. The multiple choice portion of the exam consists of forty questions with five possible answers each. The free response section contains six open-ended questions that are often long and divided into multiple parts. The first five of these questions may require twelve minutes each to answer and normally relate to one topic or category. The sixth question consists of a broad-ranging investigative task and may require approximately twenty-five minutes to answer.|$|E

25|$|The {{concept of}} {{sufficiency}} has {{fallen out of}} favor in <b>descriptive</b> <b>statistics</b> because of the strong dependence on an assumption of the distributional form (see Pitman–Koopman–Darmois theorem below), but remains very important in theoretical work.|$|E
25|$|Two main {{statistical}} methods {{are used in}} data analysis: <b>descriptive</b> <b>statistics,</b> which summarize data from a sample using indexes such as the mean or standard deviation, and inferential statistics, which draw conclusions from data that are subject to random variation (e.g., observational errors, sampling variation). <b>Descriptive</b> <b>statistics</b> are most often concerned with two sets of properties of a distribution (sample or population): central tendency (or location) seeks to characterize the distribution's central or typical value, while dispersion (or variability) characterizes {{the extent to which}} members of the distribution depart from its center and each other. Inferences on mathematical statistics are made under the framework of probability theory, which deals with the analysis of random phenomena.|$|E

25|$|The main {{benefits}} of L-estimators {{are that they}} are often extremely simple, and often robust statistics: assuming sorted data, they are very easy to calculate and interpret, and are often resistant to outliers. They thus are useful in robust statistics, as <b>descriptive</b> <b>statistics,</b> in statistics education, and when computation is difficult. However, they are inefficient, and in modern times robust statistics M-estimators are preferred, though these are much more difficult computationally. In many circumstances L-estimators are reasonably efficient, and thus adequate for initial estimation.|$|E
25|$|A {{commonly}} used measure of genetic distance is the fixation index which varies between 0 and 1. A value of 0 indicates that two populations are genetically identical (minimal or no genetic diversity {{between the two}} populations) whereas a value of 1 indicates that two populations are genetically different (maximum genetic diversity between the two populations). No mutation is assumed. Large populations between which there is much migration, for example, tend to be little differentiated whereas small populations between which there is little migration tend to be greatly differentiated. Fst is a convenient measure of this differentiation, {{and as a result}} Fst and related statistics are among the most widely used <b>descriptive</b> <b>statistics</b> in population and evolutionary genetics. But Fst is more than a descriptive statistic and measure of genetic differentiation. Fst {{is directly related to the}} Variance in allele frequency among populations and conversely to the degree of resemblance among individuals within populations. If Fst is small, it means that allele frequencies within each population are very similar; if it is large, it means that allele frequencies are very different.|$|E

40|$|Introduction: parent-preterm infant {{relationship}} is complex, and some relational patterns forecast greater psychological risk than others. Both temperamental infant peculiarities {{and quality of}} caregiving (positive parenting and parental stress) seem to be important predictors for later outcomes in preterm infants,and may be considered as foci for developmental interventions. Aims of the study: (a) to investigate the quality of family interactive dynamics; (b) to draw {{a picture of the}} peculiarities of these families in terms of child temperament, self perception of parenting skills and parental stress. In order to analyze these variables we have performed <b>descriptive</b> and correlational <b>statistics.</b> Method: the target group is recruited at S. C. I. A. F. (Padua, Italy) and is composed by 29 families with premature infants. The correct age mean is 23. 50 months (SD 13. 5) and the chronological age mean is 26. 03 months(SD 13. 53). At the beginning the families were involved in a psychodiagnostic assessment which included: Lausanne Trilogue Play(Fivaz-Depeursinge & Corboz-Warnery, 1999), Italian Questionnaire of Temperament (Axia, 2002), Family Empowerment Scale (Koren, De Chillo & Friesen, 1992) and Parent Stress Index- Short Form (Abidin, 2008). Results: families'recruitment is still ongoing, then complete results will be available by 2016. From the preliminary analysis on the initial subgroup (6 families) we have noticed that (a) <b>descriptives</b> <b>statistics</b> indicate an appropriate quality of family interactive dynamics; (b) scores about child temperament and parental stress are in line with those of non clinical population. Conclusions: preliminary results indicate the absence of significant peculiarities both in preterm children and parents in terms of variables investigated. Results are discussed for their implications for preventive interventions in families with premature infants in terms of parental support intervention...|$|R
