The {{question is whether}} geography lessons with <b>geospatial</b> <b>technologies</b> really {{contribute to the development}} of students' geospatial thinking, in particular geospatial relational thinking, as is suggested in the literature about <b>geospatial</b> <b>technologies</b> in secondary education. This paper reports about the outcomes of a quasi-experimental research project, in which a geography lesson series with <b>geospatial</b> <b>technologies</b> was compared with a conventional geography lesson series that had the same content. Although the lesson series covered only three lessons, the data showed that the lesson series with <b>geospatial</b> <b>technologies</b> contributed significantly more to the development of students' geospatial relational thinking than the conventional lesson series.

40|$|<b>Geospatial</b> <b>Technologies</b> and Climate Change' is a {{scholarly}} compilation of seventeen chapters from researchers working {{on climate change}} related research in five countries of four continents. <b>Geospatial</b> <b>technologies,</b> synergetic applications of remote sensing and geographical information systems, offer versatile cross-scale tools to study climate change, the climate system's changes over decades, and their impacts on social- and ecological systems. A wide variety of climate change applications and the most advanced tools for climate change research are presented in this volume. The detailed treatment of the topic is framed in the paradigm of spatial planning for mitigation and adaptation. Through multifunctional and flexible thinking the authors investigate the dynamics of natural systems and suggest planning ahead for longer terms, as changes of the climate unfold only over longer periods. The book argues that technological innovations for climate change mitigation and adaptation should begin locally. Three strands of spatially defined climate change research come together in this volume. The first part explores <b>geospatial</b> <b>technologies</b> as assessment tools that play important roles in scoping and monitoring climate change impacts. The second part reviews <b>geospatial</b> <b>technologies</b> as decision support tools applied in planning for adaptation and mitigation. The third part provides {{an introduction to the}} basics of <b>geospatial</b> <b>technologies</b> and uncovers their technical potential in advanced climate change research. Designed for students, academics and decision-makers, the volume accounts for the leading currents of thought in applying <b>geospatial</b> <b>technologies</b> in climate change research and adaptation. By demonstrating how diversity of discovery methods can broaden our knowledge, from design charettes through hands-on engagement with the local environment to interpreting satellite imagery, the authors emphasize the importance of inter-disciplinary approaches in addressing uncertainties over climate change. The broad and fresh perspectives of the authors make this volume an invaluable guide in innovative application of <b>geospatial</b> <b>technologies</b> in climate change research...|$|R

40|$|Thesis (Master's) [...] University of Washington, 2012 Recently, some geographers {{have turned}} their {{attention}} to some of the undertheorized concepts within critical GIS literature, resulting in the improved understanding of concepts including empowerment, participation, criticism, and the public. Nevertheless, many holes remain, with potential impacts on the future of how geographers critically examine <b>geospatial</b> <b>technologies.</b> This thesis fills one such hole, by critically analyzing the deficiencies in how geographers have conceptualized empowerment and then replacing that conceptualization with a better understanding of power itself. As a result this work provides the first detailed examination of how geographers have used the concept of power in their description of <b>geospatial</b> <b>technologies</b> and practices.

40|$|One of the {{facets of}} {{geographic}} literacy {{is the ability}} to think in a structured way about geographic relationships. <b>Geospatial</b> <b>technologies</b> offer many opportunities to stimulate students’ geographic relational thinking. The question is: How can these opportunities be effectuated? This paper discusses the results of a process-oriented experiment that aimed to gain insight into the characteristics of students’ learning processes and the factors that influence students’ learning when they work with <b>geospatial</b> <b>technologies,</b> and to provide ideas on how to optimise the learning outcomes. Eighteen students were observed in a laboratory research setting while working on tasks with a geogame and a WebGIS, and were interviewed about their learning afterwards. The study shows that using appropriate educational technologies {{is only part of the}} story. Well-designed tasks and active coaching by the teacher also seem to be indispensable ingredients. The data suggest that, in order to increase the effectiveness of instruction methods with <b>geospatial</b> <b>technologies,</b> teachers should include tasks in which students have to summarize their system knowledge in a conceptual framework, and that teachers should help students structure their system knowledge via dialogical teaching. In the tasks and support, attention should be paid to the grammar of relational thinking.

40|$|Bangladesh is a malaria endemic country. There are 13 {{districts in}} the country {{bordering}} India and Myanmar that {{are at risk of}} malaria. The majority of malaria morbidity and mortality cases are in the Chittagong Hill Tracts, the mountainous southeastern region of Bangladesh. In recent years, malaria burden has declined in the country. In this study, we reviewed and summarized published data (through 2014) on the use of <b>geospatial</b> <b>technologies</b> on malaria epidemiology in Bangladesh and outlined potential contributions of <b>geospatial</b> <b>technologies</b> for eliminating malaria in the country. We completed a literature review using “malaria, Bangladesh” search terms and found 218 articles published in peer-reviewed journals listed in PubMed. After a detailed review, 201 articles were excluded because they did not meet our inclusion criteria, 17 articles were selected for final evaluation. Published studies indicated <b>geospatial</b> <b>technologies</b> tools (Geographic Information System, Global Positioning System, and Remote Sensing) were used to determine vector-breeding sites, land cover classification, accessibility to health facility, treatment seeking behaviors, and risk mapping at the household, regional, and national levels in Bangladesh.
