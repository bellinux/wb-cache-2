5000|$|<b>Jack</b> <b>rafter,</b> cripple rafter, cripple-jack rafter: A {{shortened}} rafter such as {{landing on}} a hip rafter or {{interrupted by a}} dormer.|$|E
50|$|The {{side cut}} {{is located at}} the {{intersection}} of the side cut of <b>jack</b> <b>rafters</b> row and the pitch column on the Steel square. There is a row for the difference in length of jacks, 16 and 24 inch centers on the blade. The tangents are directly proportional for both centers.The tangent is in a base 12. The tangent x 12 = side cut of <b>jack</b> <b>rafters.</b> This corresponds to the side cut on the Steel square. The complementary angles of the arc tan are used on most angle measuring devises in construction. The tangent of hip, valley, and <b>jack</b> <b>rafters</b> are less than 1.00 in all pitches above 0°. An eighteen pitch has a side cut angle of 29.07° and a two pitch has a side cut angle of 44.56° for <b>jack</b> <b>rafters.</b> This is a variation of 15.5° between pitches.|$|R

50|$|Difference in lengths <b>jacks.</b> The <b>jack</b> <b>rafters</b> lie in {{the same}} plane as the common rafter but connect the top plate (the wall) or ridge board to the hip or valley rafter respectively. Since the hip or valley rafter meets the ridge board and the common rafter at angles of 45 degrees, the <b>jack</b> <b>rafters</b> will have varying lengths when they {{intersect}} the hip or valley. Depending on the spacing of the rafters, their lengths will vary by a constant factor—this number is the common difference.|$|R
50|$|Among {{its basic}} uses are marking common, hip, valley and hip, or valley <b>jack</b> <b>rafters,</b> laying out stair s, {{determining}} and marking angles, and making square cuts on boards.|$|R
50|$|In {{addition}} {{to use the}} square tool, construction calculators are also used to verify and determine roofing calculations. Some are programmed to calculate all side cuts for hip, valley and <b>jack</b> regular <b>rafters</b> to be exactly 45° for all rafter pitches. The rafter table is expressed in inches, and the higher the numerical value of the pitch, the greater the difference between side cut angles within a given pitch. Only a level roof, or a 0 pitch will require a 45° angle side cut (cheek cut) for hip and <b>jack</b> <b>rafters.</b>|$|R
50|$|If a right {{triangle}} has two angles that equal 45° {{then the two}} sides are equidistant. The rafter is the hypotenuse and the legs or catheti of the triangle are the top wall plates of the structure. The side cut is located at the intersection of the given pitch column and the side cut of the hip/valley row. The regular hip/valley rafter runs at a 45° angle to the main roof and the unit of measurement is 16.97 inches of run. Regular hip/valley and <b>jack</b> <b>rafters</b> have different bevel angles within any given pitch and the angle decreases as the pitch increases.The side cut of the hip/valley rafter = (Tangent)(12) = side cut in inches. The side cuts in the rafter table are all in a base 12. The arc tan can be determined from any given pitch. Most power tools and angle measuring devises use 90° as 0° in construction. The complementary angles of the arc tan are used with tools like the speed square.|$|R

5000|$|The plumb cut for <b>jack</b> {{and common}} <b>rafters</b> {{are the same}} angles. The level cut or seat cut is the {{complementary}} angle of the plumb cut. The notch formed {{at the intersection of}} the level and plumb cut Is commonly referred to as the bird’s mouth [...]|$|R
50|$|These {{were his}} three rides in the finals: Bolton made a {{qualified}} ride on <b>Rafter</b> <b>Jack</b> and scored 88.5 points {{on him in}} the second round. Combined with his 84-point ride on Black Mamba from Friday's first round, it qualified him for the championship round. Bolton then scored a very high score of 94.5 points on The Air Up There to grab the title.|$|R
