Bacteriol. 84 : 902 – 910. 1962. —The {{introduction of the}} contagious <b>drug-resistance</b> <b>factor,</b> R, into an F− strain of Escherichia coli allows the R+F− strain to mate with F−R− strains. The chromosome fragment transferred from the R+ cell is relatively large, comparable to the conjugation between F+ or Hfr male and F− female bacteria. The complex R factor has been analyzed by transduction with phage Pl. Within the R factor, the fertility determinant is inseparable from the determinant responsible for its infectivity, but can {{be separated from the}} loci for drug resistance. R thus resembles the category of complex F factors (F-primes) previously analyzed...|$|E
40|$|Conditions optimal for the {{transformation}} of Pseudomonas putida and E. coli with a <b>drug-resistance</b> <b>factor</b> (RP 1) DNA, which specifies resistance to carbenicillin, tetracycline, kanamycin, and neomycin, are described. The transformants retain all the fertility, incompatibility, and drug-resistance characteristics present in the parent. Covalently-closed circular molecules of almost identical contour lengths have been isolated from the parent and the transformants. The frequency of transformation is drastically reduced by treatment of RP 1 DNA with DNase and by denaturation or sonication. Shearing of RP 1 DNA in vitro and their subsequent introduction in P. putida cells, by transformation, produces transformants that exhibit {{a wide range of}} drug-resistant phenotypes, including those which are resistant to neomycin but sensitive to kanamycin. Isolation of such neomycin-resistant but kanamycin-sensitive transformants indicates that there might be two separate mechanisms specified by RP 1 for resistance to the two antibiotics...|$|E

Loss {{and repair}} of {{conjugal}} fertility and infectivity {{of the resistance}} factor and sex factor in Escherichia coli. J. Bacteriol. 91 : 1298 – 1304. 1966. —The <b>drug-resistance</b> <b>factor,</b> R, and the sex factor, F, have homologous traits, including contagious transmission, mediation of sexuality of the host cell, and autonomous replication in their host bacteria. Cooperation between F and R factors was found with a mutant R factor, which is nontransmissible in F− bacteria, becoming transmissible when introduced into bacteria carrying F. Conversely, the chromosome of a sterile male strain carrying the mutant sex factor, Fr, becomes transmissible when an R factor is introduced into the cell. The genetic determinants of R factors have been analyzed by isolation of mutant R factors, by sexual conjugation of the host bacteria, and by transduction of R factors with phage P 1 kc. The fertility determinant of the R factor, m, is inseparable from the determinant for its infectivity, but can {{be separated from the}} loci for autonomous replication of the R factor. R and F thus carry genetic determinants governing the same functions...|$|E

Combination of {{two types}} of {{transmissible}} <b>drug-resistance</b> <b>factors</b> in a host bacterium. J. Bacteriol. 84 : 9 – 16. 1962. —When {{two types of}} R factor, R(TC) and R (CM. SM.

In the imperfectly stable existence of both factors in a host bacterium, both factors were transmitted separately by conjugation. As the result of interaction between {{the two types of}} R factor present in a host bacterium, recombinant factors were formed, R 25 (TC. CM. SM. SA) and R 31 (CM. TC). The recombinant factors were able to transfer their resistance by conjugation.

The R factors containing TC resistance were consistently segregated when transduced. At low multiplicities of infection, the R+ transductants with ε 15 were all nonlysogenic and unable to produce normal ε 15 phage particles; among the R+ transductants with ε 34, 34 % were lysogenic and 66 % were sensitive to ε 34...|$|R
40|$|The N 6 -methyladenine (MeAde) and 5 -methylcytosine (MeC) {{contents}} in {{deoxyribonucleic acid}} (DNA) of bacteriophage lambda has been analyzed {{as a function}} of host specificity. The following facts have emerged: (i) lambda grown on strains harboring the P 1 prophage contain ca. 70 more MeAde residues/DNA molecule than lambda grown either in the P 1 -sensitive parent, or in a P 1 immune-defective lysogen which does not confer P 1 modification; (ii) lambda grown on strains harboring the N- 3 <b>drug-resistance</b> <b>factor</b> contain ca. 60 more MeC residues/DNA molecule than lambda grown on the parental strain lacking the factor; (iii) lambda grown in Escherichia coli B strains is devoid of MeC, whereas lambda grown in a B (N- 3) host contains a high level of MeC; (iv) the MeAde content in lambda DNA is not affected by the N- 3 factor. These results suggest that P 1 controls an adenine-specific DNA methylase, and that the N- 3 plasmid controls a cytosine-specific DNA methylase. The N- 3 factor has been observed previously to direct cytosine-specific methylation of phage P 22 DNA and E. coli B DNA in vivo; in vitro studies presented here demonstrate this activity...|$|E
40|$|Bacterial sex factors {{determine}} {{the synthesis of}} sex pili that act as receptors for donor-specific phages, so that many sex factors can be conveniently identified by the phage-sensitivity of their hosts (see Meynell, Meynell & Datta, 1968). Gross dif-ferences distinguish the two major groups of F-like and I-like pili and their factors, while minor differences are evident within the F-like group, as with the <b>drug-resistance</b> <b>factor,</b> R 100 - 1, and the plasmid, Fo-lac (Nishimura, Ishibashi, Meynell & Hirota, 1967; Lawn, Meynell, Meynell & Datta, 1967; Meynell et al. 1968). However, for phage sensitivity to be generally useful as a genetic marker, one {{must be able to}} select mutant sex factors that confer sensitivity to only one class of phage, e. g. to iso-metric RNA phage but not to filamentous DNA phage. Valentine and his colleagues have shown that such mutants exist in mutagenized Hfr cultures of Escherichia coli, by infecting with RNA phage, plating for isolated colonies, spraying with the same phage and picking unlysed colonies (see Valentine, Silverman, Ippen & Mobach, 1969). Only a minute proportion (2 / 900) of such colonies contain mutant factors (Silverman, Mobach & Valentine, 1967), because phage resistance less often arises in this way tha...|$|E

Tetracycline-sensitive mutants were isolated from either CM- or SM-sensitive mutants of an R factor. Among 30 mutants isolated, 10 were point mutants which could recombine with each other, forming recombinant R factors able to grow on plates containing 50 μg/ml of TC. The recombination frequency of TC-resistant recombinants was 10 − 2 to 10 − 3 in bacterial cells carrying two types of TC-sensitive R factors by superinfection with both factors. Segregational patterns of the various markers on the R factor, i. e., chl, str, sul, and m, the locus determining R mating, and their linkage order, were investigated among TC-resistant recombinants of the R factor. When TC {{was used as the}} selective drug, the tet locus mapped on the R factor as an end marker.

40|$|TRANSFERABLE <b>drug-{{resistance}}</b> <b>factors</b> (R factors) conferring {{resistance to}} more than one antibiotic may be formed by mutation of an existing R factor, by " pick-up " of chromosomal genes, or by recombination between different R factors. The last mechanism was favoured by Clowes (1972) in his recent review of the molecular structure of bacterial plasmids. Recombination between R factors has been demonstrated in the laboratory (Yokota et al., 1969; Nisioka, Mitani and Clowes, 1970), but has not been reported to have occurred in man. The appearance of a second R factor in ShigeZla sonnei without recombination has been observed during treatment of a case of human dysentery with kanamycin (Farrar et al., 1972). Previous studies described the isolation of Escherichia coli strains from the faeces of persons who had been fed with a strain of E. coli carrying the R factor R 1 (Anderson, Gillespie and Richmond, 1973 a; Anderson et al., 1973 b). The investigations showed the presence of an R factor R 174 (ACKSSuT) conferring resistance to ampicillin (A), chloramphenicol (C), kanamycin (K), streptomyci...|$|R

The procedure for obtaining a high-frequency transfer system of R-factors was identical to that for HFCT. The majority of cells of the high-frequency resistance transfer system were composed of cells which had just received R-factors by conjugation. These cells could act as highly competent donor cells for further {{transfer of}} the R-factors by conjugation. The frequencies of transfer of R-factors were as high as 1. 5 to 7. 5 per resistant donor cell introduced into mixed incubation with drug-sensitive recipient cells for 1 hr at 37 C, whereas the usual donor cells could transfer the R-factors at frequencies of, at most, 1 : 30 under similar conditions of mixed cultivation. It was also found that the aerobic conditions for growth of donor cells rather reduced the frequencies of transfer of R-factors in the usual systems. Possible mechanisms of the high-frequency resistance transfer system are discussed...|$|R
40|$|Proteomic {{technologies}} verified Anterior Gradient 2, AGR- 2, as {{a protein}} over-expressed in human cancers, including breast, prostate and oesophagus cancers, {{with the ability}} to inhibit the tumour suppressor protein p 53. AGR- 2 gene is a hormone responsive gene with an unexpected induction by the anti-cancer drug tamoxifen highlighting the proto-oncogenic role of this protein. Anterior Gradient- 2 encodes one protein that gives rise to two forms· the full length and the mature one. Full length bears a leader sequence that leads the protein to secretion. Localization studies of both forms of AGR- 2 were performed using fluorescence microscopy and subcellular fractionation, in order to determine in which compartment the protein functions. Localization mutants of the mature and full length protein determined the exact sequence required for certain localization patterns. Once localization was confirmed, the mechanism of how Anterior Gradient- 2 localization within the cell can inhibit p 53 was initiated. Furthermore, novel peptide aptamers that bound to the protein were cloned into GFP vectors and their effect on AGR- 2 was investigated. AGR- 3, another member of the family, was also examined in terms of localization and function in MCF- 7 cells. Yeast two hybrid analysis has identified potential nuclear and cytoplasmic binding partners for AGR- 2, essential for the upstream or downstream regulation of the AGR- 2 pathway. In conclusion, we present data showing models of how the Anterior Gradient protein family might function as <b>drug-resistance</b> survival <b>factor</b> in cancer as well as a p 53 inhibitor, suggesting a multi-potent role of its members when it comes to trafficking, cellular localization and activation or inhibition pathways in cancer.

J. Bacteriol. 87 : 341 – 351. 1964. —Infection of Escherichia coli male cells (Hfr or F+) with resistance factor R {{results in the}} co-ordinate inhibition of several distinct functions of F factor: mating capacity to transfer chromosome by conjugation, production of f+ antigen, and formation of receptors for the male-specific bacteriophages, f 1 and ribonucleic acid phage. The i− mutant (R 100 − 1) of R factor, which was isolated from wild-type R factor (R 100), shows no inhibition of these F properties. Male R+ 100 − 1 cells were autoagglutinable but the f+ antigen was still present. When R-infected female cells had acquired the ability to form recombinants with an F− strain, they also had become autoagglutinable. The question {{of the presence of}} f+ antigen in these strains was not solved. The cause of the autoagglutinability is not known, {{but it is not the}} result of loss of O antigen (rough autoagglutinability). Sensitivity to a phage tau, which can form plaques on female cells only, is not affected by the presence or absence of R factor. No difference in the pattern of segregation of recombinants was observed between the cross of Hfr R− × F− and that of Hfr R+ × F−. These results indicate that R factor controls a key mechanism in the synthesis of “F substances” formed on the cell surface by the F factor...|$|E

Bacteriol. 91 : 51 – 62. 1966. —Independent chloramphenicol-sensitive (CMs) mutants of the <b>drug-resistance</b> <b>factor</b> R were isolated. Introduction {{of two different}} R factor CMs mutants into a single bacterium, by conjugation or transduction, gave chloramphenicol-resistant (CMr) colonies when such strains were plated on a medium containing chloramphenicol (Cm). These CMr colonies resulted from recombination between two R factors contained within the same cell. Most of the CMr colonies were heterogeneous, and segregation of drug-resistance markers was observed among the progeny. Segregated bacteria which still carried the recombinant R factor were stable for resistance to Cm {{as well as for}} other markers of R. All the markers of recombinant R factors were cotransducible with high coincidence and at the same frequency as wild-type R. Sensitive mutants of R which had lost all the resistance markers of the R factor were found also. A mutation of R, referred to as SMA, which was sensitive to streptomycin and sulfanilamide, was capable of reverting to resistance to both of these drugs simultaneously. The sensitive alleles for SMA, CM, and TC were shown to be recessive to the resistance alleles. Mutants of R having multisite mutations or deletions in the CM gene were isolated and used to analyze the pattern of linked segregation of unselected markers of the recombinant R factor. The drug resistance factor R was shown to have two linkage groups, CM—SMA and TC—m...|$|E

Acquisition of transferability of nontransmissible R(TC) factor {{in cooperation with}} F factor and formation of FR(TC). J. Bacteriol. 88 : 1257 – 1265. 1964. —Transmissible <b>drug-resistance</b> <b>factor</b> R, which confers resistance to tetracycline, chloramphenicol, streptomycin, and sulfonamide, was previously found to be transduced in {{the system of the}} Salmonella E group with phage epsilon. The R factor of R+ transductants was nontransmissible by cell-to-cell contact, and it was not eliminated by treatment with acridine dye. When R+ transductants were infected with F factor, the nontransmissible R factor acquired transferability by conjugation. The R+ conjugants, to which only the R factor was separately transmitted by conjugation from the (F+R+) donor, were still unable to transfer their R factor by conjugation. However, the (FR) + conjugants, to which both F and R factor were transmitted simultaneously by conjugation, were also capable of transferring their F and R factors by conjugation. From the present study, it was concluded that the recombinant (FR) factor was formed {{as a result of an}} interaction between F and R factors present in a host bacterium, and that one of the mechanisms of acquisition of transferability is accounted for by the formation of recombinant (FR) factor. The recombinant (FR) factor was transferable by conjugation, and it conferred both the drug-resistance and F+ characters to the recipient cells.

Deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) extracted from these strains was separated by density-gradient centrifugation and subjected to electron microscopy by use of a modification of the protein-monolayer diffusion technique. Analytical density-gradient centrifugation of the purified DNA from PM 1 strains showed, in addition to the major peak at a density of 1. 698 g/cm 3 characteristic of Proteus chromosomal DNA, a single satellite band at a density of 1. 710 g/cm 3 [guanine plus cytosine (GC) base ratio 50 %] for R 28 K and at 1. 704 g/cm 3 (GC base ratio 45 %) for R 6 K. Direct CsCl density-gradient centrifugation of crude lysates of the E. coli (R 28 K) + strain in the presence of ethidium bromide gave rise to a sedimentation profile with a single satellite peak containing covalently closed circular (CCC) DNA molecules with a mean contour length of 21. 4 μm [44 × 106 atomic mass units (AMU) ], although a minority was 13. 6 μm in length. From the size of the major class, it was estimated that there were two to three copies of the R 28 K factor present as CCC molecules per chromosome at various phases of cellular growth. Similar studies of the E. coli (R 6 K) + lysates showed two satellite peaks; peak I contained mostly CCC molecules of contour length 12. 8 μm (26 × 106 AMU), and peak II, intermediate to peak I and the chromosomal peak, contained CCC molecules of a similar size, together with about equal numbers of catenated molecules, mostly dimers consisting of two interlocked monomers of 12. 8 μm. A smaller number (ca. 0. 1 %) of higher catenanes was also seen. The number of CCC copies of the R 6 K factor per chromosome present in peak I was calculated as 13 at logarithmic phase and 38 at stationary phase. In peak II, a constant ratio of about one catenated dimer per chromosome was found at all phases of growth.
