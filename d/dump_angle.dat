40|$|The present paper mainly {{deals with}} {{a case study of}} failed dump slope in western {{coalfield}} limited, Nagpur, India. A huge mass of debris flow had happened during the routine the activity of mining. The failed dump had a height of 75 m with 43 ? slope angle which had slipped forward by 18 m. Representative loose dump material samples were collected from the site and tested to determine the physico-mechanical properties of dump material. The dump material consisted of loose fragments and lumps of friable sandstone, shale, clay and carbonaceous shale. To evaluate the condition of failure, a well known, shear strength reduction tech-nique has been applied to achieve the desired factor of safety using two dimensional finite element code. Fi-nally, a economical, sustainable and stable <b>dump</b> <b>angle</b> and height has been suggested for smooth and safe disposal of the dump...|$|E

30|$|The slope {{geometry}} and the geo-mechanical strength of dump materials mostly control {{the stability of}} the dump [7, 19, 42]. Das [18] and McCurthy and David [41] asserted various factors responsible for failure of dump slopes such as geology and hydrogeology of the dumping area, gravitational force, seepage of water from dump to slope, lowering of water adjacent to a slope, changes of stress and erosion of dump (removal of lateral support) caused by flowing water. Other factors such as <b>dump</b> slope <b>angle</b> (slope inclination), natures of the dump materials (material properties), degree of compaction, dump height and changes in cohesion of interface materials have also been pointed by other workers [34, 48, 57].|$|R
30|$|The PCA results {{agree with}} the Pearson’s {{correlation}} result {{where there is a}} moderate relationship (0.401) between slope height and width (Table  8). Result from principal component analysis suggested that combination of height and width (dimensions) as factors of slope failure are more significant on the stability of slopes in Enyigba mine <b>dumps</b> than slope <b>angles</b> (inclinations), and therefore implies that slope height and width could be key determinants of slope failure in the area. Also, results of the PCA and Pearson’s correlation signifies that there could be many factors that causes slope instability or decrease in shear strength of slope materials [43], but some factors could be more prominent depending on the area [27].|$|R
40|$|A dual, axially-in-line, side-dump, liquid-fueled ramjet {{combustor}} {{was designed}} and tested with varying fuel-air ratios, atomizer types, and air distributions between the two inlets. Particle size distributions produced by the atomizers were measured at the inlet duct plane. When operated in a contra- flow direction, all of the atomizers produced excellent atomization with a Sauter mean diameter less than 14 microns. The dual, in-line inlets provided improved flammability limits and combustion efficiencies at lean fuel-air ratios when compared to single side-dump performance. Direct injection of approximately 20 % of the fuel flow into the dome region was found to provide improved lean flammability limits for the single side-dump, but was not required with the dual inlets. The fuel distribution in the inlet duct required for good flammability limits and combustion efficiency was opposite to that required to prevent pressure oscillations, indicating that a dump plane aero-grid will often be necessary. A <b>dump</b> <b>angle</b> of 45 deg resulted in lower than desired combustion efficiencies, apparently due to poor mixing with the air from the aft inlet. NAN...|$|E
40|$|Approved {{for public}} release; {{distribution}} is unlimited. Pulse detonation combustion offers thermodynamic advantages {{to the next}} generation of combustion systems. The thermodynamic efficiency is substantially improved over constant-pressure combustion systems by utilizing detonation-based combustion that occurs typically between 40 and 60 pulses per second. An existing four-inlet combustor was modified to a single-inlet arm design for integration with a rotary-valve concept. This paper discusses the design process of the single-inlet combustor so that it provides the same operation and reliability characteristics as its four-inlet predecessor. The design was derived from analysis through Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD), which compared a variety of single-inlet arm designs to the four-inlet model. Cold flow analysis was achieved with ANSYS CFX software to map the flow field through the combustor. The combustion features inside the engine, were predicted with ANSYS FLUENT software. The inlet <b>dump</b> <b>angle</b> and ignition-shroud were selected from the results in order to support the optimal environment for flame kernel growth and subsequent deflagration to detonation transitions. After completion of computer modeling and analysis, the successful design was manufactured and assembled for testing...|$|E

The purpose of scheduling backfill {{is to do}} volume balance between out-pit and in-pit dumping and control amount low grade that goes to stockpile and calculate distances hauled during mining process. The material scheduled divided into overburden, low grade, and ore. The material could be sent to following destinations, overburden to in-pit and out-pit dumps, low grade to in-pit, out-put dumps, stockpiles, and ore to stockpiles only. In controlling dumping sequence, there are three consideration constraints: geotechnical, capacity, and haul distance. Geotechnical constraints use dump slope which ensures maximum <b>dump</b> overall slope <b>angle</b> not exceed 13 - 15 degree, also offset dump to face, assist specified distance (50 m) between toe of working face and “toe” of dumps. This di stance must sufficient to allow operation such ore loading and water handling safely and efficiently. Second constraint is capacity that control amount low grade sent to stockpiles. Haul distance as third constraint is way to dump close to current mining o peration. By managing low grade material, when processing technology adequate, those material can be extracted. This shows Antam's good will of resource conservation that conform with sustainability...|$|R
40|$|Dumping areas {{represent}} a stable hazard. To clarify the formation mechanism of dumping piles on dumping area stability, an investigation in open pit mine was performed. Moreover, experiments with gravel were conducted {{based on the}} research site conditions. The geological conditions, dumping operation, and waste particle size distribution were investigated in the Heidaigou open pit mine. Particle size distribution, dumping height, dumping volume, and floor inclination were varied to examine their effects on a single pile formation. The design of blasting can be modified to make the particle size of waste smaller. The volume of the bucket {{does not have a}} pronounced ef-fect on <b>dumping</b> pile repose <b>angle,</b> capacity of <b>dumping</b> pile, and dumping area stability. The smal-ler the floor inclination, the better it is. Two measures are proposed to increase the kinetic force of friction between waste material and floor surface. The interval distance, dumping volume and dumping height were also varied to examine the interaction between the formations of multiple piles. The dumping width should be decided through optimization efficiency of bulldozer and dumping device in bucket wheel excavator-belt-stacker dumping operation and dragline dumping operation. Moreover, the volume of the bucket does not have a pronounced interaction effect. I...|$|R
40|$|The {{capacity}} of Erbium-doped amplifiers (EDFA) systems is rapidly being approached, and thus research is increasing in alternative technologies which can deliver broader gain spectrum than EDFAs to increase system capacity [1]. Fiber Raman Amplifiers (FRAs) provide gain in any spectral region provided that a suitable pump and fiber are available. Distributed amplifiers using the transmission fibre as a gain medium {{are used to}} improve noise performance but discrete Raman amplifiers also have the capability of extending the optical telecommunication bandwidth. Broadband gain can be achieved if multiple pumps are employed, however, gain flatness needs appropriate design of multi-pump configuration. In this experiment as shown in 1 a, nonlinearity was used to spectrally broaden a 1455 nm first order pump by propagating through a short length of TrueWave fiber with zero dispersion wavelength near the pump wavelength [2]. A very low power of the broadened pump was then used as a seed for the 1365 nm second order pump, to counter-pump the gain fiber in this way a flattened Raman gain profile over 40 nm bandwidth can be achieved. The Raman gain fiber used was, 4. 5 km Inverse Dispersion Fiber (IDF), with attenuation 0. 23 dB/km, dispersion - 44 ps/nm/km at 1550 nm, dispersion slope - 0. 128 ps/nm 2 /km, and effective core area 31 μm 2. The remnant pump was filtered via a second WDM coupler and <b>dumped</b> via an <b>angled</b> connector. The total loss for the Raman amplifier was ~ 4 dB and on-off gain can {{be as high as}} 25 dB depending on the pump powers...|$|R
