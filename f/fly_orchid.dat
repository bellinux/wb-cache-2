5|$|Green-flowered helleborine {{is found}} {{on the western side}} of the gorge, in a wooded area next to the towpath below Leigh Woods. lady orchid was {{discovered}} here in 1990, in Nightingale Valley {{on the west side of}} the Gorge; there is some doubt as to whether this was a wild plant or an introduction. <b>fly</b> <b>orchid</b> and bee orchid are found in the gorge, along with their hybrid. A single plant of lesser meadow-rue is present in the gorge. Bristol rock-cress occurs here, and at nearby Penpole Point; in the gorge, there are about 3,000 plants on the Bristol side, and about 2,000 below Leigh Woods. Hutchinsia is found on both sides of the gorge. Bloody crane's-bill grows on the Bristol side of the gorge, where it is believed to be native. Little robin occurs on both sides of the gorge. Spiked speedwell grows on both sides of the gorge: the first British record of this plant was from the gorge, in 1641.|$|E

500|$|Around {{the end of}} April 1860, Darwin {{discussed}} {{insect pollination}} with his friend Joseph Dalton Hooker, and mentioned the bee orchid. Darwin corresponded with Hooker's assistant Daniel Oliver, the senior curator at Kew Gardens, who became a follower of Darwin's ideas. At the start of June, Darwin wrote to The Gardeners' Chronicle asking for readers' observations on how bee or <b>fly</b> <b>orchids</b> were fertilised. His letter described the mechanisms for insect fertilisation he had discovered in common British orchids, and reported his experimental observations that pollen masses were removed from Orchis morio and Orchis mascula plants in the open, but left in their pouches in adjacent plants under a glass bell jar. He wrote to American botanist Asa Gray {{that he had been}} [...] "so struck with admiration at the contrivances, that I have sent notice to Gardeners Chronicle", and made similar enquiries of other experts.|$|R
40|$|Thanks for Woodward's letter [of 19 June 1792]. His health bad since April, {{following}} various inflammatory {{attacks on}} his lungs, {{for which he}} has come to Matlock, several relapses but much recovered. Dr [Erasmus] Darwin is here, "a fine old man, full of enthusiasm", who wants to become a FLS, thinks Sir Brooke Boothby [7 th baronet, (1744 - 1824), poet and writer] would, too. Admires Woodward's friend, Mr Favell. His new work is the second part of "Spicilegium botanicum". Requests specimen of 'Ornithogalum pyrenaicum'. Abundance of bee and <b>fly</b> <b>orchids</b> here and he collected many lichens off the high rocks of Cromford moor, including: 'Lichen omphalodes', 'L. saxatalis', 'L. globiferus', 'L. fragilis', 'L. physodes', 'L. sanguinarius', 'L. ventosus', 'L. tartareus', 'L. calcareus', 'L. polyphyllus', and 'Jungermannia tridentata' but not in flower. Studied Hoffmann's works little but they seem very good, he is Murray's successor at Gottingen. Comparison of his "Flora Lapponica" with the original will show he corrected the citations very much. He has been lonely in Matlock...|$|R

40|$|Pleased {{to hear of}} Smith's recovery; {{hopes he}} enjoys a leisurely stay in Norwich, [Norfolk]; {{believes}} the solitariness and bad weather on his first arrival in Matlock brought on attack on his lungs. Bad summer in Suffolk, with a short crop that is causing talk of extravagant prices in the winter. Knows Cromford Moor well but unaware of lichens {{the last time he}} was there. Struggled to find <b>fly</b> <b>orchids</b> this year but there are luxuriant bee orchids. Admired Dr [Erasmus] Darwin's last publication of his "elegant poem", further opinions; visited him in 1781; he and Sir Brooke Boothby [7 th baronet, (1744 - 1824), poet and writer] will be "capital additions" to Linnean Society. Favell mutually pleased with Smith. Has specimen of 'Ornithogalum' for Smith but it {{does not appear to be}} 'O. pyrenaicum' or 'O. umbellatum'.

Darwin observed orchids every summer, but in twenty years, only on two occasions (when he noticed butterflies [...] "sucking O. pyramidalis and Gymnadenia") did he see insects visiting flowers.In 1854, Darwin began to work full-time {{on the origin of}} species. He examined orchids and counted how often one or both pollinia (pollen masses) had been removed from their flowers, indicating that they had been visited by insects. He experimented with insect pollination to investigate whether, by cross-fertilising field crops such as Fabaceae, they would yield more vigorous offspring, and published letters about his inconclusive results in The Gardeners' Chronicle in 1857 and 1858. He next applied Sprengel's methods to empirical research on orchids. Despite delays caused by recurring illness, he made progress on writing his planned [...] "Big Book" [...] on evolution, but when Alfred Russel Wallace's letter prompted joint publication of both of their theories of natural selection in 1858, Darwin quickly wrote On the Origin of Species as an abstract of his theory, published on 22 November 1859. In this book, he gave credence to Sprengel's ideas on the advantages of [...] "intercrossing", and noted: [...] "Many of our orchidaceous plants absolutely require the visits of moths to remove their pollen masses and thus to fertilise them". He introduced his new concept, the process of coevolution, describing the co-adaptation of bumblebees and red clover, and speculating [...] "how a flower and a bee might slowly become, either simultaneously or one after the other, modified and adapted in the most perfect manner to each other, by the continued preservation of individuals presenting mutual and slightly favourable deviations of structure". This was a theme he developed in his orchid book.|$|R
50|$|It is {{here that}} one will find some rare and some {{endangered}} species such as the dormouse, the nightingale, the bee <b>fly,</b> the birds-nest <b>orchid</b> and the purple emperor butterfly. Tortington has {{a wide variety of}} habitats - woodland, open farmland, water meadows, river banks, ponds, rifes - and all have some wildlife classed as rare or even as endangered species. In the woods of Tortington the hazel dormouse population is being monitored by the Mid Arun Valley Environmental Survey (MAVES) who are also monitoring owls and bats in this, Areas 5 and 6 in the survey area. The woodland understorey has a variety of smaller floral species - early-purple and common spotted orchids, primrose, bluebell, wood anemones, wood sorrel and snakeshead fritillaries. Many of Tortington's numerous bluebell woods are beside public footpaths so can be viewed in April and May. A protected species, the common bluebell is also an indicator of ancient woodland.|$|R
