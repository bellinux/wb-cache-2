40|$|The {{purpose of}} the study was to model the {{relationship}} between entry qualifications, academic performance, professional training, <b>exit</b> <b>qualifications</b> and employability for hospitality graduates. The research design involved a student data survey to examine the academic performance of 1139 students entering the School of Management Studies for the Service Sector (SMSSS), University of Surrey in UK and the Faculty of Hotel and Tourism Management (FHTM), University Teknologi MARA in Malaysia using database records for three years of entry. Descriptive statistics, correlation analysis, ‘t’-tests, and regression analysis are used to analyse the data. Generally, at the 0. 05 significance level, the results shows that entry qualification of the graduates of University of Surrey (UniS) and diplomates of University Teknologi MARA (UiTM), was not significantly related to academic performance and employability. However, a strong correlation was found for UiTM degree holders. Professional training was a poor determinant of success and employability. Exit qualification measured as class of degree enhanced graduates ’ employability. Since this was the first ever study of the relationship between academic performance and employability of hospitality graduates for UK and Malaysia, some suggestions were proposed for the institutions, educators and industry to further help nurture the employability of graduates entering the world of work. The outcomes of this study led to the development of an employability model for hospitality management graduates. The model can be applied in the ongoing evaluation of performance and employability in hospitality management education programmes...|$|E

40|$|This paper {{measures}} the relative {{efficiency of the}} students in terms of job employability in Malaysia by using the non-parametric model of data envelopment analysis. The subjects of the sample are fresh graduates with the specialization in Hotel and Tourism Management (HTM) from University Teknologi MARA (UiTM), who have just entered into the job markets. The inputs taken for this study include entry and exit level CGPA and performance {{of the students in}} each semester of the degree course, where as, the outputs are job level and salary level of the students. Each student is considered as the decision making unit. The efficiency of each unit is calculated relative to all other observations and itself. The results reveal that the efficiency in terms of employability for some of the students is below the potential level in spite of a relatively good entry and <b>exit</b> <b>qualification</b> and better overall academic performance. It could be related to their family background, economic and social factors, overall outlook, smartness and communication skills. There is an ample opportunity to improve the employability of most of the graduates specializin...|$|R
40|$|Throughout Japan, {{enrolments}} {{in junior}} colleges, previously {{the higher education}} destination of choice for nearly 500 000 women a year at their peak in 1990, has plummeted recently to half that number. It is therefore of interest to investigate the quality of experience and post-graduation aspirations of the decreasing numbers {{of women who have}} elected to take up the short- term route. This study investigates the mission of the junior college in the 21 st century, the quality and status of the courses, {{the extent to which they}} prepare women for their career goals, and the value of the <b>exit</b> <b>qualification</b> in the employment market. In an intensive period of fieldwork in a small college on the Tokyo/Yokohama borders in the summer of 2005 the views of students and their tutors were elicited. It was found that, on the whole, high numbers of women were resigned to the gendered roles for which they have been socialized throughout their life course but that a growing minority were resolved to use their junior college degree to open up possibilities for further study and enter an arena where their economic outcomes could be expanded...|$|R

He played 400 matches for Landskrona BoIS, and only eleven other players have represented the club at more occasions than Theander has. During his first four seasons, did he and his club play in the top-flight Swedish league, Allsvenskan. After their relegation in 1980, from 1981 to 1984, {{as well as between}} 1986 and 1989, did he play in the second tier of Swedish football (which at that time was split up in a Southern and a Northern division). As Landskrona BoIS in 1984 was relegated yet again, down to the [...] "agricultural level", or Division 3 (which in 1985 comprised 144 clubs in 12 regional leagues), many players left or quit. But Theander wasn't among them, and remained in the club despite of this, the second relegation over a time of five seasons. After a poor 1985 season opening did Theander and his club after all manage to win their regional league, and could after an <b>exiting</b> home-away <b>qualification</b> against Linköping FF, return to a more decent level of Swedish football. During his entire time in Landskrona BoIS, did Theander score 28 goals.

A year after the programme was introduced student evaluation of the programme took place by means of questionnaires. The survey method was used to obtain the opinion of students via questionnaires. A convenience sample was applied and 82 % of the questionnaires were returned. Although students appeared to be satisfied, they found some modules difficult. Twenty-three per cent found the lecturers helpful and considerate and 93 % found contact with lecturers to be essential. The greatest advantage of the programme, however, is that it offers registered nurses an opportunity to qualify as clinical experts, because the programme focuses mainly on clinical specialisation. Tutorial staff are compelled by student estimates to examine the relevancy of curricula on a regular basis...|$|R
5000|$|Gabon {{then did}} not play for over a year, before {{entering}} qualification for the Africa Cup of Nations for the first time. Their attempt {{to qualify for the}} 1972 tournament held in Cameroon fell at the first hurdle however, as they were drawn against Ivory Coast in the First Round. They lost the first leg at home 2-1 on 8 November 1970, and were defeated 1-0 away two weeks later. Gabon then entered qualification for the 1972 Olympic football tournament held in West Germany. In the First Round they were drawn against Cameroon. Having lost the first leg 3-2 in Libreville on 30 May 1971, Gabon forfeited the tie as they did not travel to Yaoundé to contest the return leg. Following this ignominious <b>exit,</b> Gabon entered <b>qualification</b> for the 1974 FIFA World Cup held in West Germany, and were due to play Cameroon in the First Round the Summer of 1972, however they withdrew before the matches could be played. [...] As a result of this withdrawal, they {{did not play}} another match for over a year until they entered the football tournament at the 1972 Central African Cup (a precursor to the Central African Games) held in Brazzaville, Congo. The 5-team round robin tournament included, alongside Gabon; Cameroon, the Central African Republic, the Congo, and Chad. They played their first match on 16 July against the Congo, losing 3-0. Two days later they were defeated 3-1 by the Central African Republic and on 20 July they were soundly beaten by Cameroon, 4-0. However they salvaged some pride by beating Chad 1-0 in their final match on 22 July to avoid the bottom spot. Furthermore, this tournament doubled up as a qualification group for the 1973 All-Africa Games football tournament, and as Gabon did not win the group, they failed to qualify. A year later they entered qualification for the 1974 African Cup of Nations held in Egypt, and were due to play the Central African Republic in the summer of 1973, however they once again withdrew before a ball was kicked.|$|R
