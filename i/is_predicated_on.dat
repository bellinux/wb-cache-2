This refers to the first line of Dante's Inferno, 'Midway in our life's journey, I went astray'.

25|$|For several decades, {{researchers}} have also pursued various forms of suspended animation as {{a means by which}} to indefinitely extend mammalian lifespan. Some scientists have voiced support for the feasibility of the cryopreservation of humans, known as cryonics.

The goal of current cryonics procedures is tissue vitrification, a technique first used to reversibly cryopreserve a viable whole organ in 2005.|$|E
25|$|The {{series has}} also {{attracted}} some criticism from other pawnbrokers, who while conceding its entertainment value, {{claim that the}} series' focus on the extravagant vintage items brought into the Gold & Silver Pawn Shop are not typical of the average pawn shop, whose business <b>is</b> <b>predicated</b> <b>on</b> individuals on fixed income who bring in conventional objects {{in order to pay}} their bills, such as electronics, tools and jewelry. Corey Grigson and Charles Brown, who own a shop called Pawn Stars, estimate that their average loan to a customer is between $50 and $100. They also point out appraisals are handled by the staff, who rely on experience, reference works and research, and not the outside experts who are frequently seen on the show aiding the Harrisons.|$|E
25|$|Doyle and Sambanis' {{analysis}} {{finds that}} lasting peace {{is more likely}} after non-ethnic wars in countries with a relatively high level of development in addition {{to whether or not}} UN peacekeeping forces and financial assistance are available. They conclude that in the short run lasting peace is more dependent on a robust UN deployment coupled with low levels of hostility between belligerents. They note that increased economic capacity can provide an incentive not to renew hostilities. In the long run, however, economic capacity matters far more whereas the degree of hostility between belligerents is less important. As successful as UN deployments can be, they have inadequately spurred independent economic development within the countries where they have intervened. Thus, the UN plays a strong, but indirect role and success in lasting peace <b>is</b> <b>predicated</b> <b>on</b> the development of institutions that support peace, rather than serving as a deterrent for renewed war.|$|E

25|$|In this way, Wodiczko’s visual {{repertoire}} for his projections expanded {{beyond the}} body (ears, eyes, and hands {{as indicators of}} human sensibility) to include chains, missiles, tanks, coins, cameras, boots, swastikas, guns, candles, food baskets, and corporate logos. “In these projections,” writes Kathleen MacQueen, “the artist alternates between symbolic, iconic, and indexical images – the principal relations an image can have to its subject, according to the writings of Charles Sanders Peirce – that <b>is,</b> <b>predicated</b> <b>on</b> a cultural reference, a physical resemblance, or a physical relation respectively. In many instances they scramble all relations: the hand, an index of the body – someone’s body – is also an iconic representation of communication that might symbolically represent an open or closed ideological position.” The reductive, visual signs monumentally-sized to fit the facades on which they are projected, {{are not meant to}} read as logos for a political agenda, instead they suggest a perceptual contradiction to disrupt the kind of assumptions that beset the casual passerby.|$|E
25|$|This {{picture of}} Spinoza's {{determinism}} is ever more illuminated through reading this famous quote in Ethics: ″the infant {{believes that it}} is by free will that it seeks the breast; the angry boy believes that by free will he wishes vengeance; the timid man thinks it is with free will he seeks flight; the drunkard believes that by a free command of his mind he speaks the things which when sober he wishes he had left unsaid. … All believe that they speak by a free command of the mind, whilst, in truth, they have no power to restrain the impulse which they have to speak.″ Thus for Spinoza morality and ethical judgement like choice <b>is</b> <b>predicated</b> <b>on</b> an illusion. For Spinoza, ″Blame″ and ″Praise″ are non existent human ideals only fathomable in the mind because we are so acclimatized to human consciousness interlinking with our experience {{that we have a}} false ideal of choice predicated upon this.|$|E

500|$|There is no {{legislation}} that defines when death has occurred. However, in Airedale NHS Trust v Bland, cessation of brain stem function, {{one form of}} brain death, was considered the definition by the House of Lords. Much medical law [...] for example, that conferring the right to remove organs for transplant [...] <b>is</b> <b>predicated</b> <b>on</b> this decision and {{it is unlikely to}} be overturned. The Criminal Law Revision Committee has declined to propose a legal definition, for fear of the wide impact that it could have on disparate branches of the law, and the changing basis in medical science. In Bland, a person in a persistent vegetative state was considered to be alive; accordingly, anything less than brain stem cessation is unlikely to be sufficient for death.|$|E
500|$|In her {{review for}} The New York Times, {{based on a}} {{screening}} at the New York Film Festival, Manohla Dargis observes that [...] "throughout the movie Mr. Soderbergh mixes the wild beauty of his landscapes with images of Che heroically engaged in battle, thoughtfully scribbling and reading, and tending to ailing peasants and soldiers".

However, Dargis notes that [...] "Mr. Soderbergh cagily evades Che's ugly side, notably his increasing commitment to violence and seemingly endless war, but the movie is without question political—even if it emphasizes romantic adventure over realpolitik—because, like all films, it <b>is</b> <b>predicated</b> <b>on</b> getting, spending and making money".|$|E
