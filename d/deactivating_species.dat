40|$|Operando UV-Vis {{has been}} used and {{analyzed}} to elaborate {{on the influence of}} water on the methanol-to-olefins reaction catalyzed by H-SAPO- 34. It was shown that methanol concentration, not influenced by the nature of diluent, influences the catalytic performance. A lower methanol concentration gave rise to a higher total active time, a higher olefin yield and improved light olefin selectivity. Deactivation rates decreased and the contribution of active species was larger. This could be explained by an increased diffusion of methanol into the catalyst particles, giving rise to a higher amount of total species in the spent catalyst. When the diluent was changed from only helium to helium + water (at different ratios) the effect of water was observed. Water was shown to have no influence on the product selectivity and no clear effect on the active period or reaction time. However, the contribution of active species and the total olefin yield increased. The amount of deactivated species present in the spent catalysts was similar for all methanol / water ratios. Using NNMF analysis, it became clear water influences the reactivity of the reagent / product feed with the active species. A propylene feeding experiment confirms this. The lower reactivity explains a decreased rate of formation for <b>deactivating</b> <b>species</b> and the higher olefin yield. The slower formation of active and <b>deactivating</b> <b>species</b> together with the higher contribution of active species at their maxima implies the reactivity of the reagent / product feed is lowered due to competitive adsorption with water...|$|E

Methods for C-C, C-X and C-H bond formation and cleavage are exploited throughout the areas of fine chemicals synthesis, with major applications for pharmaceuticals.

40|$|A new kinetic {{equation}} for copper-mediated ATRP {{is introduced}} {{based on the}} exptl. observation that the deactivator concn. ([CuII]) remains const. throughout the polymn. This const. deactivator concn. can originate {{from the use of}} a heterogeneous transition metal/ligand system, resulting in the pptn. of <b>deactivating</b> <b>species</b> when the concn. exceeds a ceiling concn. Equations are derived in which the decrease of the radical concn. in time is assigned to the decrease of the concn. of the activator and the dormant chains. When the equil. const. is low and/or the polymn. rate high, the radical concn. remains const. up to high conversions indicating little termination. In the case where a monomer is used with a high equil. const. and a relatively low polymn. rate, the radical concn. is continuously decreasing in time, as the concn. of both the activator and the dormant species is decreasing throughout the polymn. To validate the kinetic equation, polymn. of Me methacrylate was performed with an alkyl bromide initiator and a heterogeneous CuIBr/CuIIBr 2 /PMDETA system.

In situ UV-vis micro-spectroscopy reveals the {{formation of}} 400 nm and 580 nm absorption bands, which are ascribed to poly-alkylated benzene (PAB) carbocations, the most active HCP species and poly aromatics (PA) the <b>deactivating</b> <b>species,</b> respectively. PAB formation within both catalysts is fitted with first-order kinetics at low reaction temperatures and activation energies (Ea) can be calculated, while PA/PAB ratio is calculated to monitor the deactivation process for different reaction temperatures. The results show that for both activation and deactivation processes, methylation reactions are leading in MTO and are controlled by acid strength; while olefins condensation reactions are governing in ETO and are affected more by acid site density. Moreover, the distribution of HCP species is visualized by confocal fluorescence microscopy, which demonstrates that the acid site density {{plays an important role}} on the local catalytic performance.

In particular, the introduction focuses on the efforts {{reported in the literature}} involving gold(I) -catalysed reactions with cyclopropenes. Chapter two describes the gold(I) -catalysed addition of indoles to 3, 3 -disubstituted cyclopropenes. The scope of the reaction is discussed, along with an investigation into the mechanism of the reaction.

30|$|Any living {{organism}} {{can be considered}} as a component of a dissipative process coupling an irreversible consumption of energy to the growth, reproduction and evolution of living things. Close interactions between metabolism and reproduction are thus required, which means that metabolism has two main functions. The first one, which is the most easily perceptible, corresponds to the synthesis of the components of living beings that are not found in the environment (anabolism). The second one, which is usually associated with the former, is the dissipative process coupling the consumption of energy to self-organization and reproduction and introducing irreversibility in the process. Considering the origin of life, the formation of {{at least some of the}} building blocks constituting a {{living organism}} can be envisaged in a close to equilibrium situation under reducing conditions (for instance in hydrothermal vents). However, coupling irreversibly self-organization with the dissipation of an energy flux implies far from equilibrium conditions that are shown in this work to raise quantitative requirements on the height of kinetic barriers protecting metabolites from a spontaneous evolution into <b>deactivated</b> <b>species</b> through a quantitative relationship with the time scale of the progress of the overall process and the absolute temperature. The thermodynamic potential of physical sources of energy capable of feeding the emergence of this capacity can be inferred, which leads to the identification of photochemistry at the wavelength of visible light or processes capable of generating activated species by heating transiently a chemical environment above several thousand Kelvin as the only processes capable of fulfilling this requirement.|$|R

The Cu-SSZ- 13 samples were first hydrothermally treated at 730 ℃ for 13 h and then subsequently individually impregnated via Wet Impregnation method with the chosen chemical species, with either Ca, P, Pt or Zn. The samples were characterized with XRD, IR, UV-Vis and/or N 2 physisorption methods and catalytic tests were performed under the Standard SCR reaction conditions within a temperature range of 150 - 450 ℃. Hydrothermal treatment caused considerable catalyst deactivation due to clustering of the catalytically active Cu 2 + ion to inactive Cu oxides. Impregnation with Pt caused formation of Pt 0 on the hydrothermally treated Cu-SSZ- 13 catalyst {{which resulted in}} severe loss in the reaction selectivity. P-impregnation caused complete deactivation of the Cu-SSZ- 13 up to reaction temperature of 350 ℃ due to unidentified P-species. Ca and Zn impregnations resulted in less severe catalyst deactivation than the P and Pt impregnations.

40|$|The {{formation}} of hydrocarbon species during the methanol to olefins (MTO) reaction over zeolite H-SSZ- 13 has been systematically studied at reaction temperatures between 573 and 723 K {{with a combination}} of operando UV-vis spectroscopy and online gas chromatography. It was found that the applied reaction temperature influences the rate and nature of coke formation as well as the catalyst stability. Correlation between all hydrocarbon species formed inside the catalyst pores with the activity and deactivation of H-SSZ- 13 zeolite material was established. By using a multivariate analysis, we found that the nature of the active and <b>deactivating</b> <b>species</b> varies with the reaction temperature. The majority of active hydrocarbon pool species at low reaction temperatures (i. e., 573 - 598 K) are methylated benzene carbocations, while at high reaction temperatures (i. e., 623 - 723 K) methylated naphthalene carbocations become dominant. At low reaction temperatures the deactivation occurs because of the pore filling with methylated naphthalene carbocations. In contrast, at higher reaction temperatures the {{formation of}} phenanthrene, pyrene carbocations, and highly conjugated polyaromatics during the deactivation increases.

These two kinds of ceria powders were tested by DTA and temperature-programmed combustion of diesel soot and a commercial carbon. Ceria processed by SCS {{was found to be}} more active than its counter part since it could decrease significantly both the combustion activation energy (from 115 to 111 kcal/mol) and the TPC-plot peak temperature of diesel soot (from 466 to 405 8 C). The mechanism of the catalytic reaction of combustion was investigated by TPD/R experiments. Likewise other combustion catalysts acting as oxygen pumps, ceria can exchange limited amounts of oxygen even below 300 8 C, the SCS-synthesized one showing a superior O 2 release at low temperatures (_ 450 8 C). Moreover, the SCS-ceria exhibited a microstructure (i. e. a foam of nano-sized crystals) particularly suitable for maximizing the number of contact points between catalyst and carbon. Finally, the effect of specific aging protocols (thermal treatment at 600 °C for 96 h) in the presence of potentially <b>deactivating</b> <b>species</b> present in diesel exhaust gases (SO 2 and water) was also studied showing that the here proposed material suffers from less significant ageing than Ce(NO 3) 3 -derived ceri...|$|E
40|$|The {{homogeneous}} {{electrochemical reduction}} of CO₂ by the molecular catalyst [Ni(cyclam) ] 2 + was studied by electrochemistry and infrared spectroelectrochemistry. This catalyst {{has been previously}} shown to have increased CO₂ reduction activity when adsorbed on a mercury electrode. The homogeneous reactivity, without a mercury electrode, was often ignored in the literature. Ni(cyclam) was found to efficiently and selectively produce CO at moderate overpotentials in both aqueous and mixed organic solvent systems in a homogenous fashion at an inert glassy carbon electrode. Methylated analogs of Ni(cyclam) were also studied and observed to have more positive reduction potentials and attenuated CO₂ reduction activity. The electrochemical kinetics were probed by varying CO₂ substrate and proton concentrations. Products of CO₂ reduction are observed in infrared spectra obtained from spectroelectrochemical experiments. The two major species observed were a Ni(I) carbonyl, [Ni(cyclam) (CO) ]⁺, and a Ni(II) coordinated bicarbonate, [Ni(cyclam) (CO₂OH) ]⁺. The rate-limiting step during electrocatalysis {{was determined to be}} CO loss from the <b>deactivated</b> <b>species,</b> [Ni(cyclam) (CO) ]+, to produce the active catalyst, [Ni(cyclam) ]+. Another macrocyclic complex, [Ni(TMC) ]⁺, was deployed as a CO scavenger in order to inhibit the deactivation of [Ni(cyclam) ]⁺ by CO. Addition of the CO scavenger was shown to dramatically increase the catalytic current observed for CO₂ reduction by [Ni(cyclam) ]⁺. Evidence for the [Ni(TMC) ]⁺ acting as a CO scavenger includes the observation of [Ni(TMC) (CO) ]⁺ by IR. Density functional theory calculations, probing the optimized geometry of the [Ni(cyclam) (CO) ]⁺ species, are also presented. These findings have implications on the increased activity for CO₂ reduction when [Ni(cyclam) ]⁺ is adsorbed on a mercury electrode. The [Ni(cyclam) (CO) ]⁺ structure has significant distortion of the Ni center out of the plane of the cyclam nitrogens. This distortion strengthens the Ni-CO interaction by increasing back- bonding interactions. This leads to the hypothesis that the mercury surface, through Hg-Ni interactions, prevents the distorted geometry seen in solution leading to a more planar geometry. This helps to destabilize the carbonyl adduct which inhibits the extent of CO poisoning of the catalyst when adsorbed on a mercury electrode. Alternative approaches to prevent CO poisoning without using such a toxic substance as mercury are critical to improving this unique catalytic syste...|$|R

Poly(methyl methacrylate) (PMMA) macroinitiators with defined molecular weight, low polydispersity index (PDI), and a high end-group functionality were obtained. These PMMA macroinitiators successfully initiate block copolymerization of tert-butyl methacrylate (tBMA), resulting in poly(MMA-b-tBMA) diblock copolymers with low PDI {{for a range of}} tBMA block lengths. Gradient polymer elution chromatography (GPEC) was used to confirm the block copolymer structure. Furthermore, the effect of molecular weight of the macroinitiator, nature of catalyst system (heterogeneous/homogeneous), and the amount of solvent on the degree of control achieved in the block copolymerization was studied. The GPEC technique was successfully used to demonstrate the effect of the aforementioned parameters on the block copolymer structure. In particular, the use of a homogeneous catalyst system, CuBr/ 4, 4 '-di- 5 -nonyl- 2, 2 '-bipyridine (dNbpy), and a large ratio of methyl ethyl ketone (MEK) to PMMA macroinitiator led to the synthesis of well-controlled high molecular weight diblock copolymers.

Therefore, {{it is surprising that}} being also the least expensive organic solvent after methanol, so far it has not become a common solvent for metal catalyzed living radical polymerizations. Here we report the elaboration of acetone-water biphasic mixtures as solvents for ultrafast single electron transfer living radical polymerization (SET-LRP) that provides close to 100 % conversion of methyl and n-butyl acrylates to the corresponding polymers with near quantitative chain-end functionality in 20 to 35 min reaction time at room temperature. Two methodologies were elaborated for this process. The first involves the generation of Cu(0) nano-colloidal particles as catalysts via the in situ reduction of Cu(II) Br- 2 with NaBH 4 by two different procedures. The second involves the use of non-activated Cu(0) wire as a catalyst. Control experiments for the organic reactions of acetone and monomers with CuBr 2 and other reagents have been used to eliminate the bromination of acetone and monomers, the aldol condensation of acetone, and the hydrolysis of CuBr 2 to Cu(OH) (2). Control experiments have also established that the most probable <b>deactivating</b> <b>species,</b> at least {{in the case of the}} first methodology, may not be CuBr 2, but bromocuprates.

The tests carried out in 1994, at the Exxon Research and Development Laboratories (ERDL) for DOE covered a slate of 5 dispersed catalysts for direct coal liquefaction of Rawhide sub-bituminous coal, which is similar to the Black Thunder coal tested earlier at Wilsonville. The catalysts included three iron and two molybdenum types. The Bailey iron oxide and the two molybdenum catalysts have previously been tested in DOE-sponsored research.

Both catalysts show high selectivity towards light olefins and completely suppress the formation of hydrocarbons bigger than C 4, with selectivity to ethane not exceeding 1 % and some traces of propane. By applying seeded growth approach, a series of Sigma- 1 zeolites with tunable crystal size and acidity was synthesized. For this series the highest methanol throughput at 450 °C before deactivation was found for crystals 0. 5 ?m in size with an acidity corresponding to 0. 5 Al atoms per zeolite cage, and a selectivity to ethylene and propylene reaching 90 %. Comparison between ZSM- 58 and Sigma- 1 catalysts with similar morphologies and acidity under the same reaction conditions revealed a three times higher throughput of methanol in case of ZSM- 58. The analysis of functional surface groups, assessed through FT-IR, revealed the presence of silanol defects in Sigma- 1 responsible for faster catalyst deactivation. These silanol defects can be selectively removed (confirmed by FT-IR) from the zeolite framework by applying a mild treatment in presence of NaOH/CTAB, leading to an improved catalyst lifetime. Co-feeding experiments with short olefins and water show low reactivity of primary MTO products, which only react at the surface of the catalyst particles. These results demonstrate that migration of the reaction zone in case of DDR catalysts hardly affects catalyst stability, product composition and nature of <b>deactivating</b> <b>species.</b> The nature of these species depends mostly on reaction temperature: at low temperatures deactivation occurs mainly due to the formation of inert adamantane species, while at high temperatures poly-condensed aromatic hydrocarbons play the major role in deactivation.

40|$|The {{depletion}} of oil reserves and the rapidly increasing demand for base chemicals such as ethylene and propylene initiated {{the quest for}} chemical processes based on alternative feedstock. Among these, the methanol-to-olefin process (MTO), using natural gas, coal or biomass as raw material, {{is one of the}} most important. MTO conversion occurs in acidic zeolites or zeotype catalysts. For industrial applications H-SAPO- 34, which has a chabazite topology, shows the best performance and the highest selectivity toward light olefins. [1] The generally accepted reaction mechanism for MTO is based on a hydrocarbon pool hypothesis, in which organic molecules (predominantly polymethylbenzenes) trapped within the anorganic zeolite framework act as co-catalysts. Methylation of the hydrocarbon pool species and subsequent olefin elimination are the key steps in the production of ethylene and propylene. [2] An important secondary effect of the presence of reactive methylbenzenes, is the formation of polycyclic aromatic compounds. [3] These large molecules are considered as coke, blocking the cages or channels, poisoning the active sites and finally deactivating the catalyst. Because the channels connecting the cages of H-SAPO- 34 are narrow, polyaromatic molecules typically remain trapped inside the cages. [4] Coke formation increases with the acid strength of the catalyst, causing deactivation to occur faster in H-SSZ- 13, the more acidic zeolite analogue of H-SAPO- 34. [5] In this contribution the activities of benzene, naphthalene, and phenanthrene toward methylation in H-SSZ- 13 and H-SAPO- 34 are compared based on theoretical calculations. This allows the assessment of the influence of the acid strength on the stability of these species and their tendency to lead to the formation of polyaromatics. Additionally, a possible route for the formation of peri-fused bicyclic compounds via isobutene, a commonly formed side-product in the MTO process, is proposed in an effort to investigate its contribution to the formation of <b>deactivating</b> <b>species.</b> [1] Chen, J.

40|$|The alcohols-to-olefins (ATO) {{catalytic}} process, {{a technology}} based on oil-alternative feedstocks, has {{gained increasing attention}} due to the current high {{price of crude oil}} as well as the growing environmental concerns. Intensive academic and industrial research, mainly performed under ex-situ conditions with bulk characterization techniques as well as advanced theoretical calculations, have yielded important insights into the ATO reaction mechanism, which follows the so-called “hydrocarbon pool (HCP) mechanism”. This mechanism involves the subsequent addition of e. g. methanol onto an organic scaffold, from which olefins, such as propylene and ethylene, are formed and subsequently released. However, the nature of the HCP species under realistic reaction conditions and the catalytic chemistry are still under debate. The scope of this PhD thesis is to obtain new physicochemical insights into ATO catalytic processes over two industrially important solid acids, namely SAPO- 34 and SSZ- 13. Both molecular sieves possess the chabazite (CHA) framework structure, but differ in their chemical composition and hence their acid function. For this purpose, a combination of in-situ bulk and micro-spectroscopic techniques has been employed, which provides complementary information on the nature, formation mechanism, kinetic behavior and spatial distribution of HCP species during the methanol-to-olefins (MTO) and ethanol-to-olefins (ETO) catalytic processes. There are two similar types of HCP species observed during the course of both MTO and ETO. The first one is ascribed to poly-alkylated benzene (PAB) carbocations, the most active HCP species. The other one is the family of poly-aromatics (PA), the <b>deactivating</b> <b>species.</b> It was found that methylation reactions are responsible for both PAB and PA formations in the case of MTO, while for ETO olefin condensations are dominant. In addition, the HCP species, formed during the MTO reaction, possess more alkyl groups as compared to the ones generated during the ETO. The HCP species are mainly located at the outer rim of the CHA crystal in the case of MTO. This distribution will eventually block the reactant and product molecules to diffuse inwards and outwards. For ETO the distribution of HCP species occurs throughout the whole crystal at low temperatures; while at high temperatures only the outer part is working and the coke formation is concentrated in a layer in the inner parts of the crystal. Furthermore, in the case of MTO acid strength controls the rate of the methylation reaction, which is the major path for the formation of PAB and PA species. The acid site density affects the MTO process in terms of amount and distribution of HCP species. In contrast, condensation of olefins, the main path for the formation of both PAB and PA species during ETO, is not controlled by the acid strength; a higher acid site density results in a faster formation and produces a higher amount of PAB and PA species. Moreover, it was found that during MTO reactions over SAPO- 34 the induction period and the lifetime of PAB carbocations gets shorter with increasing crystal size. Additionally, a larger amount of PA species is obtained with small-sized SAPO- 34 crystals...|$|E
40|$|Mixed copper-cerium oxides were {{prepared}} by two methods leading to different copper {{species in the}} as-prepared material. At the catalyst operating temperature (300 - 400 °C) and above, the same copper species was present irrespective of the preparation technique. A solid solution having the same fluorite structure as that of pure CeO 2 was formed and remained stable after calcination to 1000 °C. At temperatures in excess of 600 °C {{the formation of a}} CuO phase was also noticed. Catalytic activity of the mixed copper-cerium oxides for the oxidation of CO to CO 2 proved very favourable even under O 2 poor conditions. Activity decreasesd with increasing calcination temperature as the material sintered and lost surface area, and the copper <b>species</b> <b>deactivated</b> through formation of CuO.

40|$|A {{range of}} {{phenolic}} esters derived form the esterification of substituted phenols with 2 -bromoisobutyryl bromide and 2 -chloroisobutyryl chloride {{have been demonstrated}} to be effective atom transfer polymerization initiators in conjunction with N-(n-octyl) - 2 -pyridyImethanimine and copper(I) chloride and bromide. All initiators have been fully characterized. Methoxy, phenyl ether, primary aryl amino, aldehyde, nitro, and benzyl ether functional initiators lead to efficacious atom transfer polymerization without imparting any {{detrimental effects on the}} polymerization. Polymerizations have been shown to proceed with excellent first-order kinetics with small amount of termination, as seen by narrow polydispersity indices, often below 1. 10. Rates of polymerization are of the of the order of 1 x 10 (- 4) s(- 1), which gives PMMA of approximately 10 000 g mol(- 1) after 4 h under typical polymerization conditions. M-n increases linearly with conversion. Polymerization of a range of alkyl methacrylates is demonstrated including ethyl methacrylate, butyl methacrylate (iso- and n-) while tert-butyl methacrylate terminates early in the reaction, with the production of a broad molar mass distribution polymer. Polymerization of styrene proceeds effectively, but at a much slower rate than for MMA. Polymerization of MMA with a chloro functional initiator and CuCl proceeds at approximately half the rate of the bromo analogues with a broadening of PDI. Difunctional and trifunctional initiators are derived from the appropriate polyphenols. The multifunctional initiators are shown to be effective atom transfer initiators to give narrow PDI polymer with controlled M-n. The role of <b>deactivating</b> copper(II) <b>species</b> is further seen by the effect of the polymerization rate in a range of kinetic experiments. Esterified phenols are an extremely versatile and simple route into alpha-functional polymers via atom transfer polymerization...|$|R
40|$|The {{promoting}} {{effect of}} SO 2 on the activity for methane oxidation over platinum supported on silica, alumina and ceria {{has been studied}} by flow-reactor, in situ infrared spectroscopy and in situ high-energy x-ray diffraction experiments under transient reaction conditions. The catalytic activity is clearly dependent on the support material and its interaction with the noble metal both in absence and presence of sulfur. On platinum, the competitive reactant adsorption favors oxygen dissociation such that oxygen self-poisoning is observed for Pt/silica and Pt/alumina. Contrarily for Pt/ceria, no oxygen self-poisoning is observed, {{which seems to be}} due to additional reaction channels via sites on the platinum-ceria boundary and/or ceria surface considerably far from the Pt crystallites. Addition of sulfur dioxide generally leads to the formation of ad-SOx species on the supports with a concomitant removal and/or blockage/rearrangement of surface hydroxyl groups. Thereby, the methane oxidation is inhibited for Pt/silica, enhanced for Pt/alumina and temporary enhanced followed by inhibition after long-term exposure to sulfur for Pt/ceria. The observations can be explained by competitive oxidation of SO 2 and CH 4 on Pt/silica, formation of new active sites at the noble metal-support interface promoting dissociative adsorption of methane on Pt/alumina, {{and in the case of}} Pt/ceria, formation of promoting interfacial surface sulfates followed by formation of <b>deactivating</b> bulk-like sulfate <b>species.</b> Furthermore, it can be excluded that reduction of detrimental high oxygen coverage and/or oxide formation on the platinum particles through SO 2 oxidation is the main cause for the promotional effects observed...|$|R
40|$|Controlled radical polymerizations (CRPs) {{are among}} the most {{powerful}} methods to obtain polymers with well-defined properties and high value. Atom transfer radical polymerization (ATRP) is the most used technique in both academia and industry in the field of CRP, thanks to its versatility and simple setup. In ATRP, a metal complex in a low oxidation state, MtzLm (typically a copper-amine system, [Cu(I) L]+) reacts with a dormant polymeric chain Pn-X (where X = Cl, Br) to produce radicals Pn-*. Such radicals can propagate the polymeric chain by addition to a monomer in the bulk of the solution. In this process, the copper complex is oxidized and binds to X-, generating the <b>deactivating</b> <b>species</b> [X-Cu(II) L]+, which can trap the propagating radicals. ATRP equilibrium is well shifted towards the dormant species Pn-X, so that Pn-* concentration is very low and the probability of bimolecular radical-radical termination is minimized. Macromolecular growth begins essentially at once for all chains thanks to the utilization of very efficient alkyl halides (RX) as polymerization initiators. In such conditions, chain growth is homogenous and it is possible to obtain polymers with predetermined molecular weight, narrow molecular-weight distribution, and high C-X chain end fidelity. ATRP allows constructing macromolecules with specific composition, architecture and position of functional groups. The aim of this thesis is to contribute to both the understanding and development of ATRP catalyzed by copper complexes, using electrochemical methods as both analytical tools and instruments to carry out and control the polymerization. The work focused on both thermodynamic and kinetic properties of ATRP catalytic systems, and the use of such systems to efficiently control macromolecular growth. The investigated ATRP systems can be considered "green" for several reasons: (i) most of the work regarded the study and development of the reaction in water, a solvent generally characterized by high catalytic activity but poor polymerization control; (ii) electrochemical methods for catalyst regeneration (electrochemically mediated ATRP, eATRP) allowed carrying out the polymerization with low amounts of copper complexes; (iii) ionic liquids, a new class of non-flammable and easily recyclable solvents, were explored as potential media for eATRP; (iv) the mechanism of ATRP mediated by organic catalysts (metal-free ATRP) was investigated and defined. A fundamental characteristic of Cu(I) catalysts is their reactivity towards the Pn-X (or initiator RX) bond cleavage, with generation of propagating radicals Pn-*. Any detailed investigation of catalyst reactivity in water was impossible up to now, because of their extremely high reactivity in this solvent. For this purpose, it was necessary to develop a set of electrochemical transient methods, which involve active [Cu(I) L]+ complex generation, and analysis, in the proximity of the electrode surface. Such techniques allowed measuring kact (ATRP activation rate constant) values spanning a broad interval covering 5 orders of magnitude. This permitted the study of the most active and latest developed catalysts and initiators, in common polar and active solvents such as water and DMSO. kact correlates linearly with both ATRP equilibrium constant (KATRP) and RX bond dissociation free energy. Such correlations help to predict the reactivity of new catalyst/initiators and to select rationally polymerization conditions. ATRP catalysts were investigated in the ionic liquid 1 -butyl- 3 -methylimidazolium triflate. Both Cu/L speciation and reactivity were found to be suitable with a well-controlled polymerization process. Overall, thermodynamic and kinetics aspects of ATRP catalysts in ionic liquids appear to be similar to that observed in common organic solvents (e. g. CH 3 CN, DMF). In water, copper catalysts are not only characterized by an extreme reactivity, but also by their involvement in side reactions that can undermine efficiency of ATRP equilibrium (e. g. complex decomposition in both acid and basic environment and dissociation of the halide ion from the deactivating complex [X-Cu(II) L]+). Quantification of such reactions allowed defining stability intervals of most used ATRP catalysts in water. Defined limits of control were tested by carrying out an extensive series of polymerizations of the monomer oligo(ethyleneoxide) methylether methacrylate (OEOMA). Polymerizations were conducted with electrochemical (re) generation of the active [Cu(I) L]+ complex (eATRP). Exceptionally active catalysts such as Cu/Me 6 TREN (Me 6 TREN = tris[2 -(dimethylamino) ethyl]amine) provided fast and controlled polymerizations with slow Cu(I) regeneration; inexpensive systems such as Cu/PMDETA (PMDETA = N,N,N-,N [...] ,N [...] -pentamethyl diethylenetetramine) needed a large X- excess in order to prevent [X-Cu(II) L]+ dissociation. Pyridinic complexes, such as Cu/TPMA (TPMA = tris(2 -pyridylmethyl) amine), were stable down to extremely acidic pH (ca. 1). Overall, these results allowed unprecedented control over conditions of macromolecular growth in water. In addition, they opened a new avenue for the polymerization of acidic monomers, a class of building blocks currently considered to be problematic, or even impossible, to be polymerized by ATRP. The main reason preventing ATRP of methacrylic acid was a cyclization reaction involving the chain end, with the terminal halogen as leaving group. Simple strategies, described in chapter 4, allowed dramatically improving conversion and control over MAA polymerization. Such conditions allowed synthesis of well-controlled high molecular weight poly(methacrylic acid), PMAA, with degree of polymerization > 1000. Simple (poly) halogenated organic initiators such as 2 -bromoisobutyric acid, 2, 2 -dichloropropionic acid, and trichloroacetic acid were used to produce linear, telechelic, and three-arm star PMAA, respectively. An electrochemical switch, used to repeatedly stop and reactivate the growing chains, confirmed the "livingness" of the process. Electrochemically mediated atom transfer radical polymerization allowed exceptional control over Cu(I) (re) generation. Its main limitations are the relatively complicated reaction setup and the requirement of both working and counter electrodes made of platinum, an expensive and rare metal. To overcome these limits, first several alternative noble and non-noble metals were tested as cathode materials. Carbon materials (e. g. glassy carbon), noble metals (Au, Ag) and non-noble metals and alloys (stainless steel, nickel-chromium, titanium) could efficiently control aqueous eATRP of OEOMA. The system setup was simplified by switching from potentiostatic conditions (three-electrode setup under fixed potential) to galvanostatic conditions (two-electrode setup with fixed current). Moreover, reaction setup was further simplified {{with the use of a}} sacrificial counter electrode directly immersed in the polymerization media. This solution allowed avoiding separation of anodic and cathodic compartments. These results can allow easier implementation and scale-up of electrochemically mediated ATRP. Catalysis in the absence of transition metals is important in fine electronics and biomedical applications. It has recently been shown that some derivatives of phenothiazine (PTZ) could mediate well-controlled metal-free ATRP of methacrylates, with generation of controlled polymers with living characteristics. In this case, a phenothiazine derivative in the excited state (PTZ*, obtained through UV light absorption) can activate the Pn-X bond generating the propagating radicals (Pn-*) and the radical cation PTZ-*+. Experimental rate constant of Pn-X activation by PTZ* (7 x 109 M- 1 s- 1) was compared to the value calculated using Marcus theory for electron transfer and its successive developments (2 x 1010 M- 1 s- 1). The good agreement between the two values proved that the reaction between PTZ* and Pn-X involves an outer sphere electron transfer with simultaneous C-X bond breaking. This system is radically different from traditional Cu-mediated ATRP, which involves an inner sphere electron transfer. In addition, reactivity in metal-free ATRP is regulated by completely different parameters (excitation wavelength, lifetime and quantum efficiency of excited states). In particular, in metal-free ATRP fast activation of the C-X bond is hindered by low lifetime of PTZ* excited state. Regarding deactivation of propagating radicals, cyclic voltammetry evidenced excellent correlation between stability of the radical cation PTZ-*+ and efficiency of deactivation. The favored pathway for radical deactivation is the termolecular encounter of Pn-*, PTZ-*+ and X-, which is severely hampered by the low likelihood of three-center reactions. As a result, metal-free ATRP is mediated by a slow activation-deactivation process, which currently limits control over macromolecular growth. Such results are fundamental for the design of optimal reaction conditions and for the development of more effective catalyst...|$|E
40|$|In {{this thesis}} a novel theory of electrocatalysis at metal (especially noble metal) /solution {{interfaces}} was developed {{based on the}} assumption of metal adatom/incipient hydrous oxide cyclic redox transitions. Adatoms are considered as metastable, low coverage species that oxidise in-situ at potentials of often significantly cathodic to the regular metal/metal oxide transition. Because the adatom coverage is so low the electrochemical or spectroscopic response for oxidation is frequently overlooked; however, the product of such oxidation, referred to here as incipient hydrous oxide seems to be the important mediator {{in a wide variety of}} electrocatalytically demanding oxidation processes. Conversely, electrocatalytically demanding reductions apparently occur only at adatom sites at the metal/solution interface - such reactions generally occur only at potentials below, i. e. more cathodic than, the adatom/hydrous oxide transition. It was established that while silver in base oxidises in a regular manner (forming initially OHads species) at potentials above 1. 0 V (RHE), there is a minor redox transition at much lower potentials, ca. o. 35 v (RHE). The latter process is assumed to an adatom/hydrous oxide transition and the low coverage Ag(l) hydrous oxide (or hydroxide) species was shown to trigger or mediate the oxidation of aldehydes, e. g. HCHO. The results of a study of this system were shown to be in good agreement with a kinetic model based on the above assumptions; the similarity between this type of behaviour and enzyme-catalysed processes - both systems involve interfacial active sites - was pointed out. Similar behaviour was established for gold where both Au(l) and Au(lll) hydrous oxide mediators were shown to be the effective oxidants for different organic species. One of the most active electrocatalytic materials known at the present time is platinum. While the classical view of this high activity is based on the concept of activated chemisorption (and the important role of the latter is not discounted here) a vital role is attributed to the adatom/hydrous oxide transition. It was suggested that the well known intermediate (or anomalous) peak in the hydrogen region of the cyclic voltanmogram for platinum region is in fact due to an adatom/hydrous oxide transition. Using potential stepping procedures to minimise the effect of <b>deactivating</b> (COads) <b>species,</b> it was shown that the onset (anodic sweep) and termination (cathodic sweep) potential for the oxidation of a wide variety of organics coincided with the potential for the intermediate peak. The converse was also shown to apply; sluggish reduction reactions, that involve interaction with metal adatoms, occur at significant rates only in the region below the hydrous oxide/adatom transition...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: The {{effect of}} {{solvents}} on the spectra, absorption, or emission of substances is called solvatochromism; {{it is due}} to solute/solvent nonspecific and specific interactions, including dipole/dipole, dipole-induced/dipole, dispersion interactions, and hydrogen bonding. Thermo-solvatochromism refers {{to the effect of}} temperature on solvatochromism. The mo-lecular structure of certain substances, polarity probes, make them particularly sensitive to these interactions; their solutions in different solvents have distinct and vivid colors. The study of both phenomena sheds light on the relative importance of the solvation mechanisms. This account focuses on recent developments in solvation in pure and binary solvent mix-tures. The former has been quantitatively analyzed in terms of a multiparameter equation, modified to include the lipophilicity of the solvent. Solvation in binary solvent mixtures is complex because of the phenomenon of “preferential solvation ” of the probe by one compo-nent of the mixture. A recently introduced solvent exchange model allows calculation of the composition of the probe solvation shell, relative to that of bulk medium. This model is based on the presence of the organic solvent (S), water (W), and a 1 : 1 hydrogen-bonded species (S–W). Solvation by the latter is more efficient than by its precursor solvents, due to probe/solvent hydrogen-bonding and hydrophobic interactions. Dimethylsulfoxide (DMSO) is an exception, because the strong DMSO/W interactions probably <b>deactivate</b> the latter <b>species</b> toward solvation. The relevance of the results obtained to kinetics of reactions is briefly discussed by addressing temperature-induced desolvation of the species involved (re-actants and activated complexes) and the complex dependence of kinetic data (observed rate constants and activation parameters) in binary solvent mixtures on medium composition...|$|R
40|$|The {{lanthanide}} mediated hydroamination {{reaction is}} a simple, yet powerful way of forming nitrogen heterocycles. The {{architecture of the}} catalyst {{and the ability to}} tune the metal-ligand system allows for the possibility of high stereoselectivity and yield. Previous efforts in our laboratory determined that the complex Cp* 2 NdCH(TMS) 2 converted 2 -substituted 8 -nonen- 4 -amines to 2, 6 -disubstituted piperidines with greater than 100 : 1 selectivity for the formation of the cis isomer. A short synthesis of pinidinol, an alkaloid isolated from various pine and spruce species, was then carried out to exploit this stereoselective reaction. ^ Unlike other metal catalyzed hydroamination reactions, the lanthanides are able to affect a sequential hydroamination/C-C cyclization. In order to apply this method to the synthesis of natural products, the scope of the reaction was determined for the formation of substituted quinolizidines, indolizidines, pyrrolizidines. A methyl group was installed at diverse positions in the substrate to determine the substitution pattern that would provide the greatest diastereoselectivity. It was found that substrates containing a methyl group α or β to the nitrogen provided the highest diastereoselectivity (3 ̆e 20 : 1) for the formation of quinolizidines and indolizidines. A novel procedure for substrate preparation is also presented. ^ Attempts were made to apply the sequential reaction toward the formation of quinolizines and indolizines using amino alkynes. Unfortunately, a complex mixture of products was obtained. Varying the catalyst, as well as the electronic characteristics of the alkyne, had little to no effect. It is believed that an intermolecular chelation of the alkyne to the metal center <b>deactivated</b> the catalytic <b>species</b> and enhanced the rate of impurity formation. ^ Finally, the sequential reaction was applied to the formation of tricyclic and tetracyclic aromatic nitrogen heterocycles. An array of ring sizes was explored to determine the diastereoselectivity. The electronic characteristics of the aromatic ring were also varied to determine how they affected the cascade reaction. It was found that the benzo[a]quinolizine and the pyrido[2, 1,a]isoindolizine ring systems formed with the highest diastereoselectivity (3 ̆e 20 : 1), regardless of the electronic characteristics of the aromatic ring. ...|$|R

Furthermore, skeletal muscle adapts to <b>deactivate</b> reactive oxygen <b>species</b> produced, which in turn can both damage cells and convey signals. The molecular mechanisms regulating skeletal muscle plasticity are many, including reactive oxygen species, AMPK, and FOXO. AMPK functions as a molecular energy sensor, while the FOXO proteins are transcription factors that bind to the DNA, and regulate gene transcription. To understand the role of reactive oxygen species in health, we investigated how an intravenous antioxidant infusion of N-acetyl-cysteine (NAC), affected exercise-modulated insulin sensitivity. We found that NAC infusion decreased whole-body insulin sensitivity and skeletal muscle p 70 S 6 K phosphorylation, indicating diminished glucose uptake and attenuated protein synthesis. We also investigated the changes occurring in the atrophying skeletal muscle of individuals with spinal cord injury. We find that AMPK signaling decreases during the first year after injury, and that protein content of the AMPK regulatory γ 1 subunit decreased, and γ 3 increased. Skeletal muscle energy metabolism decreased during the first year after spinal cord injury, as indicated by the decreased protein content of the mitochondrial respiration complexes I-III. The contractile myosin heavy chain proteins myosin heavy chain 1 declined, and myosin heavy chain IIa increased 12 months after spinal cord injury. In order to understand how the changes in energy metabolizing and contractile proteins occurred, we investigated the mechanisms mediating protein degradation and synthesis, namely translation, autophagy and proteasomal degradation. We found that protein content of LC 3 II, as well as protein content and phosphorylation of S 6 kinase, increased transiently during the first year after injury, indicating a temporary increase in autophagy and protein synthesis. We also detected stably increased levels of Lys 48 poly-ubiquitinated proteins, indicating constantly increased proteasomal degradation during the first year after injury. Additionally, FOXO 3 protein content, and FOXO 1 phosphorylation decreased during the first year after spinal cord injury. To better understand the metabolic role of FOXO proteins, we transfected mouse skeletal muscle with FOXO proteins modified to bind to the DNA without activating transcription, leading to inhibited expression of FOXO regulated genes. We find that inhibition FOXO transcriptional activity decreased skeletal muscle glucose uptake, and increased inflammatory signaling and immune cell infiltration. Together, these studies partly elucidate how skeletal muscle adapts to its changing environment. We find that reactive oxygen species appear {{to be involved in the}} beneficial effects of exercise, and we unravel the signals and mechanisms mediating decreased skeletal muscle mass after spinal cord injury. Finally, we find that FOXO proteins directly affect gene networks involved in regulating inflammation and glucose metabolism in skeletal muscle...|$|R
