5|$|In 2017, Sheindlin {{created a}} game show called IWitness that debuted on July 10th and ran for 6 weeks. The game show puts the contestant's {{observational}} skills to the test, requiring them to view video clips and recall what they <b>have</b> <b>witnessed</b> faster than their competitors. On September 17, 2017, Sheindlin appeared on the series premiere of Fox News Channel's Objectified hosted by Harvey Levin. The program's first episode took {{an inside look at}} Sheindlin's life.|$|E

5|$|Working {{alongside}} Gemma whilst {{they were}} producing the globes, Mercator would <b>have</b> <b>witnessed</b> {{the process of}} progressing geography: obtaining previous maps, comparing and collating their content, studying geographical texts and seeking new information from correspondents, merchants, pilgrims, travellers and seamen. He put his newly learned talents {{to work in a}} burst of productivity. In 1537, aged only 25, he established his reputation with a map of the Holy Land which was researched, engraved, printed and partly published by himself.|$|E

5|$|After Jesus' death, his {{followers}} said {{he rose from}} the dead, although exact details of their experiences are unclear. Some of those who claimed to <b>have</b> <b>witnessed</b> Jesus' resurrection later died for their belief, which indicates that their beliefs were likely genuine. According to Sanders, the Gospel reports contradict each other, which, according to him, suggests competition among those claiming to have seen him first rather than deliberate fraud. On the other hand, L. Michael White suggests that inconsistencies in the Gospels reflect differences in the agendas of their unknown authors. The followers of Jesus formed a community to wait for his return and the founding of his kingdom.|$|E
5|$|Gerard (died 21 May 1108) was Archbishop of York between 1100 and 1108 and Lord Chancellor of England from 1085 until 1092. A Norman, he was {{a member}} of the cathedral clergy at Rouen before {{becoming}} a royal clerk under King William I of England and subsequently his son King William II Rufus. Gerard was appointed Lord Chancellor by William I, and he continued in that office under Rufus, who rewarded him with the Bishopric of Hereford in 1096. Gerard may have been with the king's hunting party when William II was killed, as he is known to <b>have</b> <b>witnessed</b> the first charter issued by the new king, Henry I of England, within days of William's death.|$|E
5|$|Melting of {{floating}} ice shelves (ice that originated on the land) {{does not in}} itself contribute much to sea-level rise (since the ice displaces only its own mass of water). However it is the outflow of the ice from the land to form the ice shelf which causes a rise in global sea level. This effect is offset by snow falling back onto the continent. Recent decades <b>have</b> <b>witnessed</b> several dramatic collapses of large ice shelves around the coast of Antarctica, especially along the Antarctic Peninsula. Concerns have been raised that disruption of ice shelves may result in increased glacial outflow from the continental ice mass.|$|E

5|$|The Klamath {{tribe of}} Native Americans, whose {{ancestors}} may <b>have</b> <b>witnessed</b> {{the collapse of}} Mount Mazama {{and the formation of}} Crater Lake, have long regarded the lake as a sacred site. Their legends tell of a battle between the sky god Skell and the god of the underworld Llao. Mount Mazama was destroyed in the battle, creating Crater Lake, called giiwas in the Klamath language. The Klamath people used Crater Lake in vision quests, which often involved climbing the caldera walls and other dangerous tasks. Those who were successful in such quests were often regarded as having more spiritual powers. The tribe still holds Crater Lake in high regard as a spiritual site.|$|E
5|$|The {{supernova}} {{explosion that}} formed the Vela Supernova Remnant most likely occurred 10,000–20,000 years ago. In 1976, NASA astronomers suggested that inhabitants of the southern hemisphere may <b>have</b> <b>witnessed</b> this explosion and recorded it symbolically. A year later, archaeologist George Michanowsky recalled some incomprehensible ancient markings in Bolivia that were left by Native Americans. The carvings showed four small circles flanked by two larger circles. The smaller circles resemble stellar groupings in the constellations Vela and Carina. One of the larger circles may represent the star Capella. Another circle is located near {{the position of the}} supernova remnant, George Michanowsky suggested this may represent the supernova explosion as witnessed by the indigenous residents.|$|E
5|$|By the 1880s {{there was}} {{increasing}} pressure {{to reform the}} structure of English counties {{and the question of}} county government had become a major political issue. Both the Liberal and Conservative party manifestos for the 1886 general election contained promises to introduce elected local authorities. The Local Government (Boundaries) Act 1887 received Royal Assent in September 1887 and appointed Boundary Commissioners to review the existing county boundaries, except for the 'Counties Corporate'. Worcestershire would <b>have</b> <b>witnessed</b> the formation of a county administration and a loss of territory to Birmingham. The Act also legislated for Dudley to unite {{with the rest of the}} county, although this would be achieved through a transfer of territory from Staffordshire. This Act was repealed in favour of the alternative Local Government Act 1888.|$|E

5|$|During the Crimean campaign, Manstein was {{indirectly}} {{involved in}} atrocities against the Soviet population, especially those committed by Einsatzgruppe D, {{one of several}} Schutzstaffel (SS) groups that had been tasked with {{the elimination of the}} Jews of Europe. Einsatzgruppe D travelled in the wake of Manstein's 11th Army, and were provided by Manstein's command with vehicles, fuel, and drivers. Military police cordoned off areas where the Einsatzgruppe planned to shoot Jews to prevent anyone from escaping. Captain Ulrich Gunzert, shocked to <b>have</b> <b>witnessed</b> Einsatzgruppe D massacre a group of Jewish women and children, went to Manstein to ask him to do something to stop the killings. Gunzert states that Manstein told him to forget what he had seen and to concentrate on fighting the Red Army. Eleven of the seventeen charges against Manstein at his later war crimes trial were related to Nazi maltreatment and killing of Jews and prisoners of war in the Crimea.|$|E
5|$|Endemic to South Africa, the bluebuck was {{confined}} to the southwestern Cape. A 2003 study estimated the expanse of the historic range of the bluebuck at , mainly along the southern coast of South Africa; fossils, however, have been discovered in a broader area that includes the southern and western CFR and even the highlands of Lesotho. Historical records give a rough estimate of its range. On 20January 1774, Swedish naturalist Carl Peter Thunberg recorded a sighting in Tigerhoek, Mpumalanga. In March or April 1783, Levalliant claimed to <b>have</b> <b>witnessed</b> two specimens in Soetemelksvlei, Western Cape. Based on these notes, a 2009 study by the South African zoologist Graham I. H. Kerley and colleagues estimated {{the range of the}} bluebuck to be limited within a triangular area in the Western Cape, bounded by Caledon to the west, Swellendam to the northeast and Bredasdorp to the south. Rock paintings in the Caledon river valley of the Free State province in eastern South Africa have been identified as bluebucks, which also confirms the once wider distribution of the species.|$|E
5|$|Flight 1 {{crashed into}} Pumpkin Patch Channel, Jamaica Bay, at 10:08:49, while angled at 78 degrees {{and on a}} {{magnetic}} heading of 300 degrees. Passengers aboard a Mohawk Airlines plane bound for Albany that took off immediately after Flight 1 watched the plane plunge into the bay. The jet exploded upon impact, a geyser of brackish water and black smoke erupted from the site, and the scattered debris and fuel caught fire. Long Island residents described hearing explosions which shook the foundations of nearby houses, though {{no one on the}} ground is known to <b>have</b> <b>witnessed</b> the plane hitting the swamp. However, a few men at Naval Air Station New York / Floyd Bennett Field saw the massive geyser of water rising above the hangars, and one guard—at his post on a bridge that the plane flew over—saw the plane roll over.|$|E

5|$|Li, Ah Jong, and Jennie wait in {{a church}} for Fung Sei to return with Ah Jong's money. Fung Sei arrives with the money, horribly beaten by Wong Hoi's gangsters who have {{followed}} him. He is mortally wounded when the hitmen barge into the church. After Ah Jong ends Fung Sei's misery with a mercy killing, he and Li engage in a long and bloody shootout with the Triad all over the church. The battle ends with a Mexican standoff between Ah Jong, Li and Wong Hoi. Ah Jong manages to wound Wong Hoi, but the Triad leader lands two bullets in Ah Jong's eye sockets before the latter dies of his wounds. When a police squadron arrives in the scene, Wong Hoi begs {{to be taken into}} custody. Frustrated by the outcome of the battle, Li fatally shoots Wong Hoi. But afterwards, Li is humiliated and arrested by the police who all <b>have</b> <b>witnessed</b> his misconduct. Worst of all, he is terminated from his career. As the result, he mourns Ah Jong while facing prison. In the end nobody ends happily.|$|E
5|$|The {{historian}} Suetonius {{was born}} in about AD70, and started writing around AD100. He was a child {{at the time of}} the games, but it is possible that he was born and raised in Rome, so he may <b>have</b> <b>witnessed</b> the inaugural games first-hand. His De Vita Caesarum (Lives of the Caesars, known also as The Twelve Caesars or Lives of the Twelve Caesars) probably completed around AD117 to 127, includes some detail on the opening days of the games. Later in his history of Titus he reveals further information about the games. Suetonius' histories of the early Caesars have been criticised for being based on rumour and gossip rather than accurate historical sources, and he often reports from sources which contradict each other without attempting to analyse their quality or accuracy. However, he is generally regarded as a thorough scholar and has been praised for his balanced treatment of his subjects.|$|E
5|$|Unlike most earlier Spanish art, Goya's {{rejects the}} ideals of heroic dignity. He refuses to focus on {{individual}} participants; though he drew from many classic art sources, his works pointedly portray the protagonists as anonymous casualties, rather than known patriots. The exception is , Que valor! (What courage!), which depicts Agustina de Aragón (1786–1857), the heroine of Zaragoza, who brought food to the cannoneers at the city defensive walls during the siege in which 54,000 Spaniards died. When all the cannoneers had been killed, Agustina manned and fired the cannons herself. Although it is agreed that Goya could not <b>have</b> <b>witnessed</b> this incident, Robert Hughes believes {{it may have been}} his visit to Zaragoza in the lull {{between the first and second}} phases of the siege that inspired him to produce the series.|$|E

5|$|According to Njáls saga, Gilli and Sitriuc spent Yule with Sigurðr in Orkney, where Sitriuc {{convinced}} Sigurðr to ally {{himself against}} Brian {{on the condition}} that Sigurðr would gain Gormlaith in marriage. In April 1014, the opposing forces met and clashed at the remarkably bloody Battle of Clontarf. Although Brian's forces ultimately won the day, and Sigurðr himself was amongst the slain, Brian lost his life as well. As for Gilli, he appears in a chapter of Njáls saga that presents a series of supernatural events connected with the conflict. In one instance, a Caithnessman is said to <b>have</b> <b>witnessed</b> valkyrie-like apparitions singing songs for the slain, whilst a similar event is said to have occurred in the Faroe Islands. Priests in Iceland are stated to have encountered paranormal phenomena, whilst an Orcadian is said to have encountered the spectre of Sigurðr before disappearing {{off the face of the}} earth. As for Gilli, the saga asserts that he dreamt of a song that foretold the outcome of the battle and the fall of Brian and Sigurðr. There is reason to suspect that the aforesaid supernatural manifestationsarguably somewhat detached from the saga's general narrativeare actually interpolations of separate material. Elsewhere in the narrative, however, there are examples of paranormal phenomena intervening into human affairs. For example, the episode concerning Gilli's dream seems to directly parallel an earlier episode in which another man, the Icelander Flosi Þórðarson, is depicted dreaming of the burning of the saga's eponym, Njáll Þorgeirsson.|$|E
5|$|After ten days' investigation, Oxley was {{surprised}} to learn that the Gibraltar Police were handling the police investigation into the shootings, having been closely involved in the events leading up to them. He also grew concerned that the police investigation was insufficiently rigorous when he learned that the police had not taken statements from residents whose flats overlooked the scene of Farrell's and McCann's deaths. The Gibraltar coroner, Felix Pizzarello, welcomed This Weeks investigation, telling Oxley that he hoped the journalists would uncover witnesses who could assist the inquest. While Oxley was investigating the shootings from Gibraltar, Manyon travelled to Madrid in an attempt {{to learn more about the}} surveillance operation which took place in Spain prior to the shootings. Bolton added Alison Cahn to the team on 18 March; her task was to visit the flats which overlooked the petrol station where McCann and Farrell were shot, with the aim of interviewing any residents who might <b>have</b> <b>witnessed</b> the events of 6 March. After several days' work, the team found two eyewitnesses to the shootings who were willing to speak on camera: Stephen Bullock, a local lawyer who had witnessed the events while out for a walk with his wife; and Josie Celecia, a housewife who had seen the shooting of McCann and Savage from her apartment window. Both witnesses' statements appeared to the journalists to be inconsistent with the official account of the shootings.|$|E
5|$|Elizabeth's case {{is brought}} to trial the {{following}} morning, {{with the assistance of}} the cobbler Richard Two-Shoes (Kaye). Elizabeth's daughter Sarah (Matthews) and son-in-law Thomas Nutter (Howick) testify that they <b>have</b> <b>witnessed</b> Elizabeth sucking from the teat of a furry creature, and speaking to a mouse (believed to be a demon). Elizabeth claims that Sarah and Thomas have falsely accused her, and want to be rid of her to make room in their house. George Waterhouse (Cooper) testifies against Elizabeth, and the accused is questioned. When others in the courtroom begin laughing at her responses, Warren declares that the next person to laugh will be executed as a witch. After an argument breaks out, the witch-finders and Pike decide that the rest of the trial should be conducted in private. Elizabeth is pricked with a needle to test her for the devil's mark. A remorseful Sarah tries to profess her mother's innocence, but Warren does not believe her. Elizabeth confesses that she has been prostituting herself to Two-Shoes, who wears a fur coat, but Two-Shoes denies this, and the trial is adjourned. Throughout proceedings, Warren is accusatory while Clarke is more cautious; Pike, meanwhile, is fascinated both by the lewd acts in which Elizabeth has supposedly engaged and by the witch-finders' torturous implements.|$|E
