5|$|On December 4 (November 21 O.S.), about 2,000 people {{arrived in}} Vilnius; {{half of them}} were officially elected as delegates by their local communities. Because no {{standard}} elections procedures were offered, the process of selecting the representatives varied greatly. Despite irregularities, {{it was the first}} election in the history of Lithuania. People from Aukštaitija were most active, while participation from Samogitia and Suvalkija somewhat lacked. Some of the delegates came <b>from</b> <b>areas</b> that are now part of Poland and Latvia, as well as <b>from</b> <b>areas</b> that were then within the lands of the German Empire (Lithuania Minor). As a result, a wide variety of communities, political groups, government layers, social classes, and organizations were represented. This parliament may have been the first in Europe to include women—there were seven female delegates.|$|E
30|$|This system {{comprises}} forty generators with valve-point loading. The generator {{data has}} been taken from [22]. The total load demand is 10500 MW. The forty generators are divided into four areas. Area 1 includes first ten units and 15 % of the total load demand. Area 2 has second ten generators and 40 % of the total load demand. Area 3 consists of third ten generators and 30 % of the total load demand. Area four includes last ten generators and 15 % of the total load demand.

5|$|At the {{beginning}} of the cardiac cycle, in early diastole, both the atria and ventricles are relaxed. Since blood moves <b>from</b> <b>areas</b> of high pressure to areas of low pressure, when the chambers are relaxed, blood will flow into the atria (through the coronary sinus and the pulmonary veins). As the atria begin to fill, the pressure will rise so that the blood will move from the atria into the ventricles. In late diastole the atria contract, pumping more blood into the ventricles. This causes a rise in pressure in the ventricles. As the ventricles reach systole, blood will be pumped into the pulmonary artery (right ventricle) or aorta (left ventricle).|$|E

He carried 12 of the 15 Southern states and the border states of Maryland, Delaware and North Carolina but lost his home state to Bell. His greatest support in the Deep South came <b>from</b> <b>areas</b> that opposed secession. Davis pointed out that only Breckinridge garnered nearly equal support from the Deep South, the border states, and the free states of the North. His 72 electoral votes bested Bell's 59 and Douglas's 12, but Lincoln received 180, enough to win the election.|$|E

30|$|This system {{comprises}} ten generators with valve-point {{loading and}} multi-fuel sources having three fuel options. Transmission loss is considered here. The generator data {{has been taken}} from [13]. The total load demand is 2700 MW. The ten generators are divided into three areas. Area 1 consists of the first four units; area 2 includes the next three units and area 3 includes the last three units. The load demand in area 1 is assumed as 50 % of the total demand. The load demand in area 2 is assumed as 25 % and in area 3 is taken as 25 % of the total demand. The power flow limit <b>from</b> <b>area</b> 1 to <b>area</b> 2 or <b>from</b> <b>area</b> 2 to area 1 is 100 MW.

40|$|The {{objective}} was to evaluate the association between low levels of physical fitness and sociodemographic factors in adolescents from rural and urban areas. A cross-sectional study was conducted on 627 adolescents (299 <b>from</b> urban <b>areas</b> and 328 <b>from</b> rural <b>areas)</b> aged 14 to 17 years, who attended state public schools. Sociodemographic data, anthropometric measures and health-related physical fitness data (Physical Best) were collected. With respect to flexibility, adolescents <b>from</b> urban <b>areas</b> presented a 56 % higher chance of inadequate flexibility than schoolchildren <b>from</b> rural <b>areas.</b> In the sit-up test, adolescents <b>from</b> rural <b>areas</b> presented an almost 10 times higher chance of inadequate muscle strength/endurance than those <b>from</b> urban <b>areas.</b> Regarding cardiorespiratory fitness, adolescents <b>from</b> urban <b>areas</b> showed a 91 % higher chance of inadequate fitness than those <b>from</b> rural <b>areas.</b> In conclusion, adolescents <b>from</b> urban <b>areas</b> attending state public schools {{are more prone to}} inadequate health-related physical fitness than adolescents <b>from</b> rural <b>areas...</b>|$|R

Hybrids between the Lelwel and Tora hartebeest {{have been reported}} in eastern Sudan and western Ethiopia, in a stretch southward from the Blue Nile to about 9° N latitude. A study proved a male hybrid of the red hartebeest and the blesbok (Damaliscus pygargus) to be sterile. Sterility of the hybrid was attributed to difficulties in segregation during meiosis, indicated by azoospermia and a low number of germ cells in its seminiferous tubules.|$|E
5|$|The {{expansion}} of Mayfair moved upper class Londoners away <b>from</b> <b>areas</b> such as Covent Garden and Soho, which {{were already in}} decline by the 18th century.

The requirements of the aristocracy led to various stables, coach houses and servants' accommodation being established along the mews running parallel to the streets.

At the same time, Croatian Serb authorities began systematically expelling non-Serb civilians <b>from</b> <b>areas</b> under their control. The expulsions {{in the area of}} eastern Slavonia were primarily motivated by the aim of changing the ethnic composition in favour of Serbs as well as the resettling of Serb refugees who had fled western Slavonia following Operation Swath-10 by the Croatian Army.|$|E
