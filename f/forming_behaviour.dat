The material composition can be tailored to meet specific requirements, but also increases the complexity of processing techniques. The overall <b>forming</b> <b>behaviour</b> results from {{the interaction of the}} specific <b>forming</b> <b>behaviour</b> of the composite components in their structural set-up. This complicates the prediction of results in comparison to metal forming processes. Because of the required heating and cooling in forming processes for thermoplastic composites, distortions due to thermal shrinkage arise. These result in a spring-in of bend components. For sequential heating processes as for bending processes, springback is observed as well, suggesting that additional residual stresses need to be accounted for. Therefore, an investigation of the influence of forming temperature and forming velocity in a rotary draw bending process for a thermoplastic tape is carried out, to develop a suitable forming process for thin bent parts...|$|E

40|$|The <b>forming</b> <b>behaviour</b> of {{non-crimp}} fabric (NCF) was simulated using finite element (FE) analysis incorporating a non-orthogonal constitutive model. NCFs feature asymmetric shear behaviour {{caused by the}} stitching used to hold the tows together. This asymmetric shear property causes an asymmetric draping pattern of NCF, even when formed over a symmetrical hemispherical forming tool. Current work focuses on the feasibility of a continuum mechanics model to simulate the asymmetric <b>forming</b> <b>behaviour</b> of NCF. The constitutive equation consists of two parts: the tensile contribution from fibre reinforcement and the shear stiffness. For the fibre directional properties, a non-orthogonal equation originally developed for woven fabric was adopted. The shear stiffness was modelled through a constitutive equation incorporating picture-frame shear data. Both a picture-frame shear test and forming of NCF over a hemisphere tool were simulated by commercial finite element software with the current constitutive model implemented within a user material subroutine. The virtual picture-frame test confirmed {{the validity of the}} constitutive equation in simulating planar deformation behaviour of NCF. Furthermore, the numerical analysis of hemispherical forming suggests that increasing blank-holder force decreases the asymmetry of the draped pattern...|$|E

The concept of mixing enthalpy and mismatch entropy {{can be used in}} order to quantify Inoue’s criteria of bulk metallic glass formation. In the present study, glass forming composition range has been determined for different binary and ternary (Zr, Ti, Hf) –(Cu, Ni) alloys based on the mixing enthalpy and mismatch entropy calculations. Though copper and nickel appear next {{to each other in the}} periodic table, the glass forming ability of the copper and nickel bearing alloys is different. Thermodynamic analysis reveals that the glass <b>forming</b> <b>behaviour</b> of Zr and Hf is similar, whereas it is different from that of Ti. The smaller atomic size of Ti and the difference in the heat of mixing of Ti, Zr, Hf with Cu and Ni leads to the observed changes in the glass <b>forming</b> <b>behaviour.</b> Enthalpy contour plots can be used to distinguish the glass forming compositions on the basis of the increasing negative enthalpy of the composition.

Transverse and longitudinal weld orientations are considered for this study. The weld location includes both centre and offset weld positions in the transverse weld orientation. To investigate the <b>forming</b> <b>behaviour</b> of tailor-welded blanks, limit dome height (LDH) tests are performed. <b>Forming</b> <b>behaviour</b> is quantified by the forming-limit curve (FLC). The FLCs of welded blanks are {{compared with that of}} an unwelded blank. It is found from the analyses that the weld region shows a negligible effect on the FLC when placed at the centre position irrespective of weld orientation. In the case of transverse welded blanks, when placed at offset locations (20 turn and 30 mm. from geometric centre), limit strains are found to decrease when compared with that of the unwelded blank, with the 30 mm offset location showing the minimum FLC. The offset weld locations (20 mm and 30 mm offset) show reduced limit strains when compared with that of the centre weld location depicting the intrinsic effect of the weld location on the FLC. More variation is seen especially in the stretching region of the forming-limit diagram, while less variation is observed in the drawing region.

40|$|Purpose: The work {{discuss the}} {{phenomena}} {{involved in the}} formation of the microstructure of semi-solid thixotropic alloy A 356 produced by different techniques and the relation between microstructure and <b>forming</b> <b>behaviour</b> of the material. Design/methodology/approach: Thixotropic slurries of A 356 alloy were produced from liquid and from solid conditions; in the first case either by stimulating nucleation rate or crystal multiplication during solid growth; in the second case by recrystallization and partial melting of deformed structures. Flow behaviour was analysed by viscosity measurements or by flow ability in forging operations. Findings: Results show that different production techniques activate different mechanisms, leading to distinct structure features in the semi-solid slurry, and, as consequence, in its forming characteristics. Techniques which promote formation of isolate globules of primary phase, like those involving nucleation stimulation and recrystallization, result in a semi-solid with better flowing behaviour. On the other hand, techniques based on crystal multiplication during growth lead to more interconnected globules in the slurry and poorer <b>forming</b> <b>behaviour.</b> Research limitations/implications: Semi-solid processing is suitable only for alloys with appropriate liquid fraction x temperature relation. Practical implications: the knowledge of the phenomena involved {{in the formation of}} thixotropic metallic slurries produced by different techniques, and their consequences in the material structure and flow behaviour, allow the decision of the adequate slurry production method for a specific application, in order to take the best advantage of the semi-solid technology.

40|$|Due to the {{requirements}} to reduce the part weights in automotive manufacturing significantly, the use of lightweight materials such as magnesium {{becomes more and more}} important. Unfortunately, these materials are often connected with a limited cold formability. In the case of magnesium, the hexagonal structure and the resulting limited number of sliding planes represent the main reason for this material behaviour. To extend the magnesium application in car manufacturing, it is essential to identify strategies which make an improvement of the <b>forming</b> <b>behaviour</b> of these materials possible. The use of elevated temperatures in forming operations represents a potential solution approach. Temperature supported hydroforming operations of magnesium offer the chance to combine the advantages of media-based forming operations such as - realization of complex part geometries, - achievement of high forming degrees, - guaranty of a high part accuracy and - guaranty of a high part stiffness with the temperature potentials concerning the creation of additional sliding planes in the material structure.
