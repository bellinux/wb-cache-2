25|$|AMD Catalyst is a {{collection}} of proprietary device <b>driver</b> <b>software</b> available for Microsoft Windows and Linux.|$|E
25|$|The {{specific}} commands used to lock, unlock, program, or erase NOR memories differ {{for each}} manufacturer. To avoid needing unique <b>driver</b> <b>software</b> for every device made, special Common Flash Memory Interface (CFI) commands allow {{the device to}} identify itself and its critical operating parameters.|$|E
25|$|The {{character}} code produced by any key press {{is determined by}} the keyboard <b>driver</b> <b>software.</b> A key press generates a scancode which is interpreted as an alphanumeric character or control function. Depending on operating systems, various application programs are available to create, add and switch among keyboard layouts. Many programs are available, some of which are language specific.|$|E
50|$|Test {{equipment}} manufacturers offer instruments {{that provide a}} power supply, <b>driver</b> circuitry, and <b>software</b> <b>drivers</b> that essentially saves a test system designer time and cost by eliminating two of the six switch matrix design challenges: power and control hardware design as well as <b>software</b> <b>driver</b> development.|$|R

RadarSync's PC Updater offers a free scan and recommendations of updates to device <b>drivers</b> and <b>software</b> applications installed {{on a computer}} running Microsoft Windows. RadarSync does not store <b>driver</b> or <b>software</b> files on its servers, instead linking to the hardware or software vendor site for the files.|$|R
25|$|Most {{standard}} programs {{written for}} DOS {{did not necessarily}} need 640kb or more of memory. Instead, <b>driver</b> <b>software</b> and utilities referred to as Terminate and Stay Resident (TSR) programs {{could be used in}} addition to the standard DOS software. These drivers and utilities typically permanently used some conventional memory, reducing the total available for standard DOS programs.|$|E
25|$|The Wii Remote Bluetooth {{protocol}} can {{be implemented}} on other devices including cell phones, which often have poor usability with games. Two students have demonstrated this concept by creating a <b>driver</b> <b>software</b> that has the capability to connect the Wii Remote to a Symbian smartphone. The idea behind this driver is that a mobile phone with a TV-out port can replace the game console.|$|E
25|$|Microcontroller {{firmware}} in {{the network}} adapter typically handles link issues, supported by <b>driver</b> <b>software</b> in the operating system. Non-programmable analog and digital electronics are normally {{in charge of the}} physical components below the link layer, typically using an application-specific integrated circuit (ASIC) chipset for each network interface or other physical standard. High-performance routers are to a large extent based on fast non-programmable digital electronics, carrying out link level switching.|$|E

25|$|Early SDSC host {{devices that}} assume 512-byte blocks {{therefore}} {{do not fully}} support the insertion of 2GB or 4GB cards. In some cases, the host device can read data that happens to reside in the first 1GB of the card. If the assumption {{is made in the}} <b>driver</b> <b>software,</b> success may be version-dependent. In addition, any host device might not support a 4GB SDSC card, since the specification lets it assume that 2GB is the maximum for these cards.|$|E
25|$|Although powerful, the {{internal}} modem was commercially impractical. Not {{only did it}} require special <b>driver</b> <b>software,</b> but a different hardware design was needed for every computer bus, including Apple II, S-100, TRS-80, and others. Some popular computers, like the Atari 400, did not even integrate internal slots. An obvious solution was to use the RS-232 serial port; modems were serial devices and generally driven off RS-232 anyway, and most computer designs included an RS-232 port, or some variant.|$|E
25|$|Note, too, {{that some}} {{nominally}} bi-endian CPUs require motherboard help to fully switch endianness. For instance, the 32-bit desktop-oriented PowerPC processors in little-endian mode act as little-endian {{from the point}} of view of the executing programs, but they require the motherboard to perform a 64-bit swap across all 8 byte lanes to ensure that the little-endian view of things will apply to I/O devices. In the absence of this unusual motherboard hardware, device <b>driver</b> <b>software</b> must write to different addresses to undo the incomplete transformation and also must perform a normal byte swap.|$|E
5000|$|Many {{companies}} have introduced new product concepts that aid in custom switch matrix design. These new products offer test system designers a power supply, <b>driver</b> circuitry, and <b>software</b> <b>drivers</b> all wrapped {{together in a}} mainframe. The mainframe provides flexible mounting for switches and other components as well as blank front and rear panels {{that can be easily}} modified to fit a design need. These new products eliminates 3 of the 6 design challenges: mechanical design, power and control hardware design, and <b>software</b> <b>driver</b> development ...|$|R

25|$|Simple logic {{circuits}} interpret the relative timing to indicate which direction the wheel is rotating. This incremental rotary encoder scheme {{is sometimes called}} quadrature encoding of the wheel rotation, as the two optical sensors produce signals that are in approximately quadrature phase. The mouse sends these signals to the computer system via the mouse cable, directly as logic signals in very old mice such as the Xerox mice, and via a data-formatting IC in modern mice. The <b>driver</b> <b>software</b> in the system converts the signals into motion of the mouse cursor along X and Y axes on the computer screen.|$|E
25|$|NAND devices {{also require}} bad block {{management}} by the device <b>driver</b> <b>software,</b> or by a separate controller chip. SDcards, for example, include controller circuitry to perform bad block management and wear leveling. When a logical block is accessed by high-level software, it is mapped to a physical block by the device driver or controller. A number of blocks on the flash chip may {{be set aside}} for storing mapping tables to deal with bad blocks, or the system may simply check each block at power-up to create a bad block map in RAM. The overall memory capacity gradually shrinks as more blocks are marked as bad.|$|E
500|$|Unlike {{previous}} {{versions of}} Windows, Windows Update {{does not allow}} the selective installation of updates, and all updates (including patches, feature updates, and <b>driver</b> <b>software)</b> are downloaded and installed automatically. Users can only choose whether their system will reboot automatically to install updates when the system is inactive, or be notified to schedule a reboot. If a wireless network is designated as [...] "Metered"—a function which automatically reduces the operating system's background network activity to conserve limits on internet usage, most updates are not downloaded until the device is connected to a non-metered network. Redstone 2 allows wired (Ethernet) networks to be designated as metered, but Windows may still download certain updates while connected to a metered network. Updates can cause compatibility or other problems; a Microsoft troubleshooter program allows bad updates to be uninstalled.|$|E
50|$|Things such as device <b>drivers</b> and <b>software</b> {{libraries}} must {{be tested}} using test programs. In addition, testing {{of large numbers}} of users (performance testing and load testing) is typically simulated in software rather than performed in practice.|$|R

2500|$|Mouse use in DOS {{applications}} {{became more}} common after {{the introduction of}} the Microsoft Mouse, largely because Microsoft provided an open standard for communication between applications and mouse <b>driver</b> <b>software.</b> Thus, any application written to use the Microsoft standard could use a mouse with a driver that implements the same API, even if the mouse hardware itself was incompatible with Microsoft's. This driver provides the state of the buttons and the distance the mouse has moved in units that its documentation calls [...] "mickeys", as does the Allegro library.|$|E
2500|$|Some touchpads have [...] "hotspots", {{locations}} on the touchpad used for functionality beyond a mouse. For example, on certain touchpads, moving the finger along {{an edge of}} the touch pad will act as a scroll wheel, controlling the scrollbar and scrolling the window that has the focus vertically or horizontally. Many touchpads use two-finger dragging for scrolling. Also, some touchpad drivers support tap zones, regions where a tap will execute a function, for example, pausing a media player or launching an application. All of these functions are implemented in the touchpad device <b>driver</b> <b>software,</b> and can be disabled.|$|E
2500|$|Some touchpads and {{associated}} device <b>driver</b> <b>software</b> may interpret tapping the pad as a click, and a tap {{followed by a}} continuous pointing motion (a [...] "click-and-a-half") can indicate dragging. Tactile touchpads allow for clicking and dragging by incorporating button functionality into {{the surface of the}} touchpad itself. To select, one presses down on the touchpad instead of a physical button. To drag, instead performing the [...] "click-and-a-half" [...] technique, one presses down while on the object, drags without releasing pressure and lets go when done. Touchpad drivers can also allow the use of multiple fingers to facilitate the other mouse buttons (commonly two-finger tapping for the center button).|$|E

50|$|Windows 7 {{includes}} the new Windows Biometric Framework. This framework {{consists of a}} set of components that standardizes the use of fingerprint biometric devices. In prior releases of Microsoft Windows, biometric hardware device manufacturers were required to provide a complete stack of software to support their device, including device <b>drivers,</b> <b>software</b> development kits, and support applications. Microsoft noted in a white paper on the Windows Biometric Framework that the proliferation of these proprietary stacks resulted in compatibility issues, compromised the quality and reliability of the system, and made servicing and maintenance more difficult. By incorporating the core biometric functionality into the operating system, Microsoft aims to bring biometric device support on par with other classes of devices.|$|R

The DVD Zone sleeve would occasionally have unique codes which gave readers access to game betas, trials, and in-game content, among other things.|$|R
2500|$|Driver {{packages}} {{that are used}} to install <b>driver</b> <b>software</b> are copied in their entirety into a [...] "Driver Store", which is a repository of driver packages. This ensures that drivers that need to be repaired or reinstalled won't need to ask for source media to get [...] "fresh" [...] files. The Driver Store can also be preloaded with drivers by an OEM or IT administrator to ensure that commonly used devices (e.g. external peripherals shipped with a computer system, corporate printers) can be installed immediately. Adding, removing and viewing drivers from the [...] "Driver Store" [...] is done using PnPUtil.exe A new setting in Device Manager allows deleting the drivers from the Driver Store when uninstalling the hardware.|$|E
