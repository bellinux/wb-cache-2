In life {{extending}} and refurbishing old {{power station}} plant, {{the following question}} must be addressed: Does one maintain current configuration, {{which was based on}} the technology of 1960, or make use of current power utility technology trends, and change the power station's configuration. This specific problem involves four existing Eskom power stations, with an approximate combined replacement value of R 7 billion. All these stations have the capability of using a common steam <b>feed</b> <b>range</b> to supply superheated steam to the turbo-generator sets. This common steam <b>feed</b> <b>range</b> becomes very maintenance intensive in its "old age". Hence the need for this study into the feasibility of its refurbishment. This common steam <b>feed</b> <b>range</b> configuration was considered state-of-the-art in the mid- 1900 's, but is currently not the practised technology. This is primarily due to the technology advancement into reheat boilers, making control of a range type configuration impossible. Monte Carlo simulation provides an effective, holistic decision mechanism, that is free from bias, emotions and conjecture. Hence the simulation product, highlighted in this dissertation, will have solved an industrial problem finally and effectively, by ensuring that for a relatively small cost of building the simulation models, major capital expenditure estimates can be accurate, with a confidence in the return on investment. This paper discusses the use of Monte Carlo simulation modelling as an engineering analysis tool, for the analysis of two power station configuration options, i. e. with a steam <b>feed</b> <b>range</b> and without. Firstly, an investigation into the selection of which computer language to use as a development tool is presented. The Monte Carlo simulation technique is then explained, and simulation models are built of the two power station configurations. The models, which are built using SIMSCRIPT 11. 5 simulation language to represent the real world in each configuration option, are then discussed. The availability analysis is developed, and conclusions and recommendations are discussed, as presented in the report to Eskom Management...|$|E

We adopted the range of spindle speed change n =  10, 000 - 20, 000 rev/min and tool <b>feed</b> <b>range</b> Sm =  50 - 300  mm/min. Measurements of shrinkage were performed {{with the help of}} ATOS III Triple Scan XL scanning system immediately after treatment and in 48  h thereafter. Based on the scanned polygonal mesh of each hole, three-dimensional models of holes drilled in the samples were built. Then, these models were verified against nominal drillings using GOM Inspect software. In this way, the values of rheonomic shrinkage were obtained. Verification was carried out according to Gaussian method of measurements by coincidence using variation variables sigma (Gaussian best-fit 3 sigma).|$|E
40|$|International audienceThis study {{presents}} {{the development of}} a hybrid model for the prediction of residual stresses induced during the finish turning of a 15 - 5 PH martensitic stainless steel. This new approach consists in replacing tool and chip modeling by equivalent loadings. This model is called “hybrid” because it applies thermomechanical loadings (obtained experimentally) on a numerical model. These equivalent loadings are moved onto the machined surface to compute the final residual stress state. The first part of the present research work proposed to characterize machining equivalent thermo-mechanical loadings at the machined surface level. A new simple method is presented. The case of the dry orthogonal cutting operation of a 15 - 5 PH martensitic stainless steel with coated carbide tools is treated. To this end, two experimental devices and associated numerical models are used. Shapes and locations of equivalent thermo-mechanical loadings are extracted from a Finite Element (FE) simulation of orthogonal cutting. A simplified analytical approach is applied to draw up a list of parameters necessary to calibrate the equivalent loadings. These parameters (friction coefficient, contact length, cutting forces etc.) have to be quantified experimentally. So, tribological tests and orthogonal cutting tests are performed. Finally, using experimental results, machining equivalent thermo-mechanical loadings are quantified. The heat flux, tangential stress and normal pressure at the final workpiece surface are characterized {{as a function of the}} cutting speed and the feed. In the second part of this paper, machining equivalent thermo-mechanical loadings previously identified are transferred to a 3 D configuration. The objective is to predict the residual stresses induced by a longitudinal finish turning operation on 15 - 5 PH steel. Based on this new approach, the paper also aims at investigating the interactions between each revolution. It is shown that around five revolutions are necessary to reach a steady state for this material. Finally the numerical results are compared with experimental measurements obtained by X-Ray diffraction. It is shown that residual stresses cannot be considered as homogeneous over the surface due to the feed influence. Additionally, the X-Ray beam is too large to quantify this heterogeneity. Based on average numerical values coherent with the average values obtained by X-Ray diffraction, it is shown that the numerical model provides consistent results compared to experimental measurements for a large <b>feed</b> <b>range.</b> Highlights ► Hybrid model for the prediction of residual stresses induced by turning. ► Combining of numerical models and experimentations (friction and cutting tests). ► Quantification of the thermal and mechanical impact of the machining process. ► Necessity of a 3 D simulation to model a longitudinal turning operation. ► Comparison of numerical and experimental results for a large <b>feed</b> <b>range...</b>|$|E

All emphasize the need for the participation of livestock-keepers in project management. They describe projects in Nigeria, Sudan, Kenya and Botswana which cover both subhumid and semi-arid regions. The development institutions involved range from large multilateral agencies to a small Sudanese NGO. The first paper, on animal health, describes an example of an increasingly popular approach to the delivery of veterinary services, namely the training of herder specialists. The project was a notable success {{in terms of the number}} of livestock vaccinated. The second paper is about range management and lists the conclusions to be drawn, and the problems that arose, during six years of work in Botswana on establishing fenced grazing areas radiating out from a central water point. Improvement of livestock feed in the subhumid zone of Nigeria is the subject of the third paper. It describes the achievements and problems faced during the course of a research project set up to involve livestock keepers in fencing off a small plot of land near their homestead and in supplementing the natural pastures therein with a forage legume for use during the dry season.

40|$|This {{research}} is {{an assessment of}} the machinability of a nickel-based alloy Inconel 718 using a finish turning operation with carbide coated and uncoated tools having fine and medium grain size substrates, and the same tool geometry (a round tool shape geometry with a 0 ° rake angle and 7 ° clearance angle). In addition, orthogonal machining tests were carried out to generate experimental data for future identification of the constitutive laws of Inconel 718 (its behavior under high stress, strains, strain rates, and temperatures). The finish turning of this alloy was evaluated in terms of tool life, tool wear mechanisms, cutting forces, surface roughness, and chip formation process. The cutting speed range evaluated was from 50 to 100 m/min, and the <b>feed</b> <b>range</b> was from 0. 075 to 0. 125 mm/rev. Throughout the machining tests, the depth of cut was kept constant and equal to 0. 25 mm. Tungsten carbide uncoated tool having fine grain size (< 1 μm), strong and sharp cutting edges were found to be the most suitable tool material and tool geometry for the finish turning of Inconel 718 at a cutting speed of 50 m/min, and, moreover, yielded the best tool life of 53 minutes. When finish turning at a cutting speed of 75 m/min, a single layer PVD (TiAlN= 3 μm) carbide tool yielded the best tool life of 12 minutes. At a cutting speed of 100 m/min, triple layer CVD coated tools (TiCN/Al 2 O 3 /TiN= 15 μm) produced the best performance, yielding an 8 minutes of tool life. During the machining tests, the common wear mechanisms of the three different tools were adhesion, abrasion, and diffusion. Flank wear was the dominant tool failure mode of all three tools. The analysis of chip morphology showed that no phase transformation existed even though the material was deformed. The increase of micro-hardness was confirmed by micro-hardness measurements on chips, as compared to the initial micro-hardness of the material (Inconel 718). Cutting forces for all the different tools were relatively low (< 300 N) when the cutting edge was new. For the finish turning operation, surface roughness of (< 1 mum) was achieved in all the cutting tests...|$|E

40|$|Research Doctorate - Doctor of Philosophy (PhD) The Reflux Classifier is an {{industrial}} technology that separates particles {{on the basis}} of size and / or density. It consists of a conventional vertical fluidised bed with a section of parallel inclined channels positioned above. The research described in this thesis is an examination of the effects of using “narrow” inclined channels (with widths as fine as 1. 77 mm) on the performance of a Reflux Classifier. The finest channels studied prior to this work were nominally 7 mm wide. The understanding of particle elutriation from these relatively wide inclined channels was developed by Laskovski et al. (2006). They noted that there was an increased preferential re-suspension of low density particles as the channel spacing narrowed. However, this re-suspension phenomenon was not fully investigated, thus, the mechanisms for this re-suspension were not fully understood or accounted for in their generalised correlation. Experiments were performed in laboratory-scale vessels, with 1 m long channels, inclined at 70 ° to the horizontal. Channel widths from 18 mm down to 1. 77 mm were investigated. Batch experiments were performed using well-defined feeds with particles of a single density (PVC, glass ballotini and ilmenite) and also using {{an industrial}} coal sample. It was found that: 1) relatively narrow channels produced a previously unobserved size suppression effect; and 2) the maximum particle size to channel width ratio for optimum performance was determined to be 0. 33. A theoretical model, with no adjustable parameters, was developed which successfully predicted and explained the observed results. The main cause of the suppression of size effects is that when laminar flow occurs in narrow channels, the effective fluid velocity experienced by the particles lying on the channel wall is proportional to their size. Further experiments were performed in continuous mode with simultaneous feed addition, and underflow and overflow removal. A number of different industrial coal feeds were used. Comparing these results against those from the more traditional wider channelled Reflux Classifiers, it was demonstrated that the size suppression effect observed in batch narrow channel operations also occurred in continuous operations. The new narrow 5. 5 mm channel Reflux Classifier was capable of processing an extended size range of - 2. 0 mm + 0. 25 mm while achieving a separation density of 1560 kg/m³ and Ep of 0. 062. Where Ep is a measure of how accurately the separation device performed, with an Ep of “ 0 ” being a perfect splitting of a stream over a point and an Ep of “ 1 ” showing that there was no preferential segregation in the splitting of the stream. The traditional wide 30 mm or 120 mm channel Reflux Classifier could only achieve for a similar separation density and feed size range of - 2. 0 mm + 0. 25 mm could only typically produce an Ep of 0. 15 (55). While the narrow channels operate best at a capacity of 20 t/(m²h), allowing significant separation down to 0. 075 mm, increasing the processing rate of the classifier is possible, though at a diminished capacity. At 30 t/(m²h) the narrow channel Reflux Classifier will competently process particles as fine as 0. 125 mm and at throughputs of ~ 40 t/(m²h) the channel Reflux Classifier would only be able to process a <b>feed</b> <b>range</b> of - 2 mm + 0. 25 mm which is comparable to the maximum capacity of the more traditional wide channel Reflux Classifier...|$|E

2500|$|As {{selective}} {{pressure on}} prey {{is higher than}} on predators [...] adaptation usually occurs in prey long before the reciprocal adaptations in predators. Evidence in the fossil record supports this, with no evidence of modern pursuit predators until the late Tertiary period. Certain adaptations, like long limbs in ungulates, that {{were thought to be}} adaptive for speed against predatory behavior have been found to predate predatory animals by over 20 million years. Because of this, modern pursuit predation is an adaptation that may have evolved separately and much later as a need for more energy in colder and more arid climates. Longer limbs in predators, the key morphological adaptation required for lengthy pursuit of prey, is tied in the fossil record to the late Tertiary. It is now believed that modern pursuit predators like the wolf and lion evolved this behavior around this time period as a response to ungulates increasing <b>feeding</b> <b>range.</b> As ungulate prey moved into a wider <b>feeding</b> <b>range</b> to discover food in response to changing climate, predators evolved the longer limbs and behavior necessary to pursue prey across larger ranges. In this respect, pursuit predation is not co-evolutionary with prey adaptation, but a direct response to prey. Prey's adaptation to climate is the key formative reason for evolving the behavior and morphological necessities of pursuit predation.|$|R
