5|$|An {{alignment}} {{is calculated}} {{by measuring the}} azimuth, the angle from north, of the structure and the altitude of the horizon it faces The azimuth is usually measured using a theodolite or a compass. A compass is <b>easier</b> <b>to</b> <b>use,</b> though the deviation of the Earth's magnetic field from true north, known as its magnetic declination {{must be taken into}} account. Compasses are also unreliable in areas prone to magnetic interference, such as sites being supported by scaffolding. Additionally a compass can only measure the azimuth to a precision of a half a degree.|$|E
5|$|Digital {{radio in}} the United Kingdom is being {{promoted}} by radio stations and the broadcasting industry {{on the premise that}} it provides superior quality sound over AM, a wider choice of radio stations, is <b>easier</b> <b>to</b> <b>use,</b> and is resistant to the interference which other broadcast media are susceptible to. On the other hand critics say that coverage is not yet sufficient and the quality can be less than that of FM.|$|E
5|$|The Mk. XIV was {{theoretically}} less {{accurate than}} the contemporary Norden bombsight but was smaller, <b>easier</b> <b>to</b> <b>use,</b> faster-acting and {{better suited to}} night bombing. It equipped {{the majority of the}} RAF bomber fleet during the war; small numbers of Stabilized Automatic Bomb Sights and Low Level Bombsight, Mark IIIs were used in specialist roles. A post-war upgrade, the T-4, also known by its rainbow code Blue Devil, connected directly to the Navigation and Bombing System to automate the setting of windspeed and direction and further increase accuracy. These equipped the V Bomber force as well as other aircraft.|$|E

5|$|The {{cause of}} Smart's eclipse may be traced {{in part to}} a {{prejudice}} of the age, one which was founded in reason but developed in fear. There was one inescapable fact which hampered any clear perception of Smart's work—he had been confined for madness. It was <b>easier</b> <b>to</b> <b>use</b> a difficult allusion or unusual image as evidence of madness than to interpret it. What could cause a fundamentally rational group of people to react so irrationally? To some degree, it was the fear of 'enthusiasm'.|$|E
5|$|The BASIC {{interpreter}} {{was developed}} from that {{used on the}} ZX81 and a ZX81 BASIC program can be typed into a Spectrum largely unmodified, but Spectrum BASIC included many extra features making it <b>easier</b> <b>to</b> <b>use.</b> The ZX Spectrum character set was expanded {{from that of the}} ZX81, which did not feature lower-case letters. Spectrum BASIC included extra keywords for the more advanced display and sound, and supported multi-statement lines. The cassette interface was much more advanced, saving and loading around five times faster than the ZX81 (1500 bits per second compared to 307), and unlike the ZX81, the Spectrum could maintain the TV display during tape storage and retrieval operations. As well as being able to save programs, the Spectrum could save the contents of arrays, the contents of the screen memory, and the contents of any defined range of memory addresses.|$|E
5|$|Although {{he came to}} Hamburg to {{work with}} Pauli, Rabi found Otto Stern working there with two English-speaking {{postdoctoral}} fellows, Ronald Fraser and John Bradshaw Taylor. Rabi soon made friends with them, and became interested in their molecular beam experiments, for which Stern would receive the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1943. Their research involved non-uniform magnetic fields, which were difficult to manipulate and hard to measure accurately. Rabi {{came up with the}} idea of using a uniform field instead, with the molecular beam at a glancing angle, so the atoms would be deflected like light through a prism. This would be <b>easier</b> <b>to</b> <b>use,</b> and produce more accurate results. Encouraged by Stern, and greatly assisted by Taylor, Rabi managed to get his idea to work. On Stern's advice, Rabi wrote a letter about his results to Nature, which published it in February 1929, followed by a paper entitled Zur Methode der Ablenkung von Molekularstrahlen ("On the method of deflection of molecular beams") to Zeitschrift für Physik, where it was published in April.|$|E
