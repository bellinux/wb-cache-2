The eyes of the child are <b>detailed</b> <b>in</b> black and white. The continued presence of these details suggests that they were completed while the plaster was damp.

40|$|Self {{relevant}} <b>detail</b> <b>in</b> false memory formation … 2 Rates {{of false}} memory reports vary markedly in the published literature. In {{an effort to}} explain these differences, {{the present study investigated}} the effects of including different types of <b>details</b> <b>in</b> a false narrative upon subsequent false memory formation. Participants were assigned to one of four conditions in which the inclusion of self-relevant and/or specific <b>details</b> <b>in</b> a false event (putting a toy in a teacher’s desk) was manipulated. Participants engaged in a standard memory recovery procedure over three interviews, involving recall for three true and one false event. Upon completion, 68. 2 % of participants in self-relevant groups were judged as having created memories or images about the false event, compared to 36. 4 % in non-self-relevant groups. Subjective ratings of memory intensity were higher for self-relevant groups, and self-relevant participants were less likely to correctly guess the false event. These findings indicate that including self-relevant <b>details</b> <b>in</b> suggested childhood events increases the likelihood that such events will be accepted as false memories.
