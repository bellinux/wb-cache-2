5|$|In his text, An Unusual Feast: Gumbo and the Complex Brew of Black Religion, author Derek Hicks {{suggest that}} “through gumbo, traditions and values are transmitted.” This quote {{represents}} his larger claim that gumbo does this <b>for</b> <b>African</b> <b>American</b> culture, uniting {{a group of}} people by one very powerful dish. According to Hicks, it is not just that gumbo is a cultural and historical food in the black community, but that it continues to foster that community through its flavors, colors and eating methods, which are usually in large groups where it can be shared among many people.|$|E
50|$|Like many {{institutions}} in the American South, during segregation the library maintained a separate branch <b>for</b> <b>African</b> <b>Americans.</b> This new library, built in 1905, {{was added to the}} western wing of Central High School, the city's high school <b>for</b> <b>African</b> <b>Americans.</b>|$|R
40|$|Thesis (Master's) [...] University of Washington, 2016 - 03 This {{research}} {{examines the}} association between county-level sex ratios <b>for</b> <b>African</b> <b>Americans</b> and births to unmarried <b>African</b> <b>American</b> women. Utilizing Census Bureau intercensal population estimates and CDC natality data as well as measures for urbanicity and residential segregation, the analysis considers whether low sex ratios <b>for</b> <b>African</b> <b>Americans</b> are associated with out-of-wedlock fertility and explores {{the context in which}} this association is strongest. I find a negative association between male-to-female sex ratios and nonmarital fertility <b>for</b> <b>African</b> <b>Americans,</b> but only in highly-segregated metropolitan counties. The results suggest that a county’s level of segregation and metropolitan classification are important factors when considering {{the association between}} sex ratios and nonmarital fertility <b>for</b> <b>African</b> <b>Americans...</b>|$|R
50|$|Fares for {{the entire}} line in 1853 were $1.10 for White adults and 60 cents <b>for</b> <b>African</b> <b>Americans</b> and {{children}} paid the same as <b>African</b> <b>Americans.</b> Fares <b>for</b> stopping at Port Walthall Junction, the Half Way stop, and Temple or Falling Creek fares were 35, 60 or 85 cents for White adults and 35 or 60 <b>for</b> <b>African</b> <b>Americans.</b>|$|R
5|$|Indianapolis {{residents}} {{continued to}} assist those in need. Veterans programs were initiated to help wounded soldiers with housing, food, and other basic necessities. New orphanages and asylums joined the Indianapolis Orphans' Home, chartered in 1850, to aid women and children. The German Protestant Orphans' Association was organized in 1867. The Indianapolis Asylum for Friendless Colored Children, the state's only orphanage <b>for</b> <b>African</b> <b>American</b> children, {{was established in}} 1870. Other major charitable groups included the Indianapolis Benevolent Society and the Indianapolis Flower Mission, both organized in 1876.|$|E
5|$|Love, Inc. {{suffered}} from low viewership despite its high ratings among young Hispanic women; it was canceled following UPN's merger with the WB {{to launch the}} CW in 2006. The series' cancellation, along with that of other black sitcoms, was criticized by media outlets for reducing representation of African American characters {{and the amount of}} roles <b>for</b> <b>African</b> <b>American</b> actors on television. Critical response to Love, Inc. was mixed; some critics praised its multi-ethnic cast, while others felt that the storylines and characters were unoriginal and Philipps' portrayal of her character was unsympathetic. It has not been made available on Blu-ray or DVD.|$|E
5|$|The DuSable Museum quickly {{filled a}} void caused by limited {{cultural}} resources then available to African Americans in Chicago. It became an educational resource <b>for</b> <b>African</b> <b>American</b> {{history and culture}} and a focal point in Chicago for black social activism. The museum has hosted political fundraisers, community festivals, and various events serving the black community. The museum's model has been emulated in numerous other cities around the country, including Boston, Los Angeles, and Philadelphia.|$|E

5|$|Athens {{became a}} center for music in the region during the Civil War and gained further fame {{in the early twentieth}} century with the {{founding}} of the Morton Theatre, which was a major touring destination <b>for</b> <b>African</b> <b>American</b> performers. The city's local rock music scene can be traced to the 1950s, with live music at Allen's Hamburgers in Normaltown. International attention came in the 1970s when the B-52's began releasing the first of several best-selling recordings. Athens-based rock bands have performed in a wide array of styles, and the city has never had a characteristic style of rock; most of the bands have been united only in their quirky and iconoclastic image.|$|E
5|$|Eve {{suffered}} from low viewership {{in spite of}} its high ratings among young Hispanic women; it was canceled following UPN's merger with The WB Television Network (The WB) to launch The CW in 2006. The series' cancellation, along with that of other black sitcoms, was criticized by media outlets for reducing representation of African American characters and the number of roles <b>for</b> <b>African</b> <b>American</b> actors on television. Critical response to Eve was mixed; some praised its inclusion as a part of UPN's line-up of black sitcoms, but others felt Eve lacked charisma, and that the series was inferior to other black sitcoms. Despite the negative reception, the show and Eve received several award nominations. The series was released on the iTunes Store and Amazon Video.|$|E
5|$|Many of {{the most}} legendary music venues in Baltimore have been shut down, {{including}} most of the shops, churches, bars and other destinations on the legendary Pennsylvania Avenue, center for the city's jazz scene. The Royal Theater, {{once one of the}} premiere destinations <b>for</b> <b>African</b> <b>American</b> performers on the East Coast, is marked only by a simple plaque, the theater itself having been demolished in 1971. A statue of Billie Holiday remains on Pennsylvania Avenue, however, between Lafayette and Lanvale, with a plaque that reads I don't think I'm singing. I feel like I am playing a horn. I try to improvise. What comes out is what I feel.|$|E

5|$|After World War 2, William Marbury, then Chairman of the Board of Trustees of the Peabody Institute, {{began the}} process of {{integrating}} that institution, which had denied entrance to several well-regarded African American performers based solely on their race, including Anne Brown and Todd Duncan, {{who had been the}} first black performer with the New York City Opera when he was forced to study with Frank Bibb, a member of the Peabody faculty, outside the Conservatory. The director of the Peabody soon ended segregation, both at the Conservatory and at the Baltimore Symphony Orchestra, which was conducted by its first African American, A. Jack Thomas, at his request. The Peabody was officially integrated in 1949, with support from mayor Howard W. Jackson. Paul A. Brent, who graduated in 1953, was the first to matriculate, and was followed by Audrey Cyrus McCallum, who was the first to enter the Peabody Preparatory. Musical integration was a gradual process that lasted until at least 1966, when the unions <b>for</b> <b>African</b> <b>American</b> and white musicians merged to form the Musicians' Association of Metropolitan Baltimore. Baltimore is the hometown of African American classical opera tenor Steven Cole.|$|E
