2500|$|Some 19th-century economists {{believed}} that improvements in finance, manufacturing and science rendered some of Malthus's warnings implausible. They {{had in mind}} the division and specialization of labour, increased capital investment, and increased productivity of the land due {{to the introduction of}} science into agriculture (note the experiments of Justus Liebig and of Sir John Bennet Lawes). Even in the absence of improvement in technology or of <b>increase</b> <b>of</b> <b>capital</b> equipment, an increased supply of labour may have a synergistic effect on productivity that overcomes the law of diminishing returns. As American land-economist Henry George observed with characteristic piquancy in dismissing Malthus: [...] "Both the jayhawk and the man eat chickens; but the more jayhawks, the fewer chickens, while the more men, the more chickens." [...] In the 20th century, those who regarded Malthus as a failed prophet of doom included an editor of Nature, John Maddox.|$|E

60|$|Since all {{capital is}} the product of saving, that is, of {{abstinence}} from present consumption {{for the sake of a}} future good, the <b>increase</b> <b>of</b> <b>capital</b> must depend upon two things—the amount of the fund from which saving can be made, and the strength of the dispositions which prompt to it.|$|E

Very few are the countries presenting the needful union of conditions.

Though capital should for a time double itself simultaneously with population, if all this capital and population are to find employment on the same land, they can not, without an unexampled succession of agricultural inventions, continue doubling the produce; therefore, if wages do not fall, profits must; and, when profits fall, <b>increase</b> <b>of</b> <b>capital</b> is slackened.|$|E

60|$|From the {{preceding}} exposition {{it appears that}} the limit to the increase of production is twofold: from deficiency of capital, or of land. Production comes to a pause, either because the effective desire of accumulation is not sufficient to give rise to any further <b>increase</b> <b>of</b> <b>capital,</b> or because, however disposed the possessors of surplus income may be to save a portion of it, the limited land at the disposal of the community does not permit additional capital to be employed with such a return as would be an equivalent to them for their abstinence.|$|E
60|$|I {{have already}} remarked that, {{in the present}} low state of popular education, all the higher grades of mental or educated labor are at a {{monopoly}} price, exceeding the wages of common workmen in a degree very far beyond that {{which is due to}} the expense, trouble, and loss of time required in qualifying for the employment. Any tax levied on these gains, which still leaves them above (or not below) their just proportion, falls on those who pay it; they have no means of relieving themselves at the expense of any other class. The same thing is true of ordinary wages, in cases like that of the United States, or of a new colony, where, capital increasing as rapidly as population can increase, wages are kept up by the <b>increase</b> <b>of</b> <b>capital,</b> and not by the adherence of the laborers to a fixed standard of comforts. In such a case, some deterioration of their condition, whether by a tax or otherwise, might possibly take place without checking the increase of population. The tax would in that case fall on the laborers themselves, and would reduce them prematurely to that lower state to which, on the same supposition with regard to their habits, they would in any case have been reduced ultimately, by the inevitable diminution in the rate of <b>increase</b> <b>of</b> <b>capital,</b> through the occupation of all the fertile land.|$|E
60|$|In [the United States,] England, and Holland, then, for a {{long time}} past, and now in most other {{countries}} in Europe, the second requisite of increased production, <b>increase</b> <b>of</b> <b>capital,</b> shows no tendency to become deficient. So far as that element is concerned, production is susceptible of an increase without any assignable bounds. The limitation to production, not consisting in any necessary limit to the increase of the other two elements, labor and capital, must turn upon the properties of the only element which is inherently, and in itself, limited in quantity. It must depend on the properties of land.|$|E

60|$|Except at such periods, {{the amount}} of capital {{disposable}} on loan is subject to little other variation than that which arises from the gradual process of accumulation; which process, however, in the great commercial countries, is sufficiently rapid {{to account for the}} almost periodical recurrence of these fits of speculation; since, when a few years have elapsed without a crisis, and no new and tempting channel for investment has been opened in the mean time, there is always found to have occurred in those few years so large an <b>increase</b> <b>of</b> <b>capital</b> seeking investment as to have lowered considerably the rate of interest, whether indicated by the prices of securities or by the rate of discount on bills; and this diminution of interest tempts the possessors to incur hazards in hopes of a more considerable return.|$|E
60|$|I {{have already}} {{observed}} that this minimum rate of profit, less than {{which is not}} consistent with the further <b>increase</b> <b>of</b> <b>capital,</b> is lower in some states of society than in others; and I may add that the kind of social progress characteristic of our present civilization tends to diminish it: (1.) In the first place, one of the acknowledged effects of that progress is an increase of general security. Destruction by wars and spoliation by private or public violence are less and less to be apprehended. The risks attending the investment of savings in productive employment require, therefore, a smaller rate of profit to compensate for them than was required a century ago, and will hereafter require less than at present. (2.) In the second place, {{it is also one of}} the consequences of civilization that mankind become less the slaves of the moment, and more habituated to carry their desires and purposes forward into a distant future. This increase of providence is a natural result of the increased assurance with which futurity can be looked forward to; and is, besides, favored by most of the influences which an industrial life exercises over the passions and inclinations of human nature. In proportion as life has fewer vicissitudes, as habits become more fixed, and great prizes are less and less to be hoped for by any other means than long perseverance, mankind become more willing to sacrifice present indulgence for future objects. But, though the minimum rate of profit is liable to vary, and though to specify exactly what it is would at any given time be impossible, such a minimum always exists; and, whether it be high or low, when once it is reached, no further <b>increase</b> <b>of</b> <b>capital</b> can for the present take place.
