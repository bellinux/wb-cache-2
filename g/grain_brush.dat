40|$|The {{cause of}} the present low in bobwhite quail populations in Ohio is a very {{controversial}} subject. Many reasons have been advanced to explain the periodic fluctuations that occur in bobwhite populations in this state. It {{is the purpose of}} this paper to discuss and attempt to evaluate these reasons. Of the many articles reviewed by this writer only a selected few have been used as references to avoid repetition and in order to eliminate unsound conclusions. According to Leopold (1) the history of bobwhite populations in the north central states can be subdivided into four stages. 1. A pre-settlement stage during which it was likely that quail were restricted to the open edges of prairies and open woods. 2. A crude agricultural stage; a period where good interspersion of <b>grain,</b> <b>brush,</b> weeds and hedges made possible the extension of the birds ' range and stabilized the population. 3. An intensified agricultural stage which was accompanied by a decrease in quail numbers "frequently due to overshooting, and nearly always due to a decreas...|$|E
40|$|Atmospheric {{freeze drying}} (AFD) is the {{lyophilization}} {{of a product}} at atmospheric pressure conditions and temperatures ranging generally between - 15 and - 5 ◦C (avoiding, thereby, ice melting). The quality of the obtained dried products is quite similar {{to the quality of}} products dried by vacuum freeze drying (VFD), but without the need of generating vacuum, maintaining temperatures around - 50 ◦C in the condenser, or defrosting it. There are several ways to carry out AFD, {{such as the use of}} a fluidized bed or a tunnel conveyor. Nevertheless, AFD involves considerably longer drying times than VFD, and the process must be modified in some way in order to shorten them without loss of product quality at the same time. Moreover, since this process is usually carried out with air at very low temperatures, it can saturate rapidly. This situation leads to a reduction of the gradient of water concentration between air and product surface, and consequently, a diminution of the mass transfer rate. The use of an adsorbent material compatible with the food product (i. e., not toxic for human consumption) in a fluidized bed, could constitute an alternative for using other extra energy supplies (such as IR application, or heat pump). At the same time, the use of the adsorbent medium presents two additional advantages: the first, as the heat of adsorption of water vapour is of the same order of magnitude than sublimation heat of ice, no additional energy supply is necessary; second, it acts as adsorbent medium for generated water vapour, allowing air recirculation, which means an additional reduction of operative costs. In particular, non-food wheat bran is an interesting material to be applied as adsorbent in this process; this adsorbent is not only compatible with foodstuff, but also, since it is a by-product of the cereal processing industry, it is cheap and can be easily discarded (and reused, for example, in compost) without recovering it by means of a thermal treatment. Nonetheless, as it is the hard outer layer of cereals consisting of combined aleurone and pericarp, its particles exhibit a very irregular plane shape, with rests of <b>grain</b> <b>brush</b> and, in some cases, broken pericarp. These characteristics confer to the particle a rough surface and, as undesired consequence, the possibility of mechanical interaction during fluidization. However, when two different materials are fluidized in a fluidized bed, the mixture may undergo segregation, causing a poor contact between the adsorbent and the food particles. Thus, instead of using a traditional fluidized bed, a spout-fluid bed (an apparatus similar to the spouted bed, with lateral air injectors beside the main jet) may be utilized, and thereby enhancing mixing. On the other hand, CFD simulation would offer a great potential for simulating the AFD process, its optimization from the fluid dynamic point of view, and the design of new equipment. Various investigators have been working on the application of CFD models for simulating AFD in fluidized bed. However, in general, they simulated a single piece of foodstuff, but not the complete system with air, food material, and adsorbent (when it is applied). The general objectives of the PhD work are to determine the hydrodynamic conditions under which AFD in adsorbent fluidized bed is feasible, and to obtain a first approach to a CFD model of the process. Particularly, the study of the hydrodynamics of the process (non-food wheat bran fluidization behaviour, and mixing of binary mixtures) in a fluidized bed as well as in a spout-fluid bed is aimed from the experimental point of view, while the evaluation of the possibility of simulation by means of a CFD code of the AFD process by immersion in adsorbent medium in a fluidized bed is intended in the theoretical field. Unlike sand or other materials in which regular bubbles are formed, non-food wheat bran exhibits canalization or preferent...|$|E

50|$|Composite lumber {{is usually}} more costly than normal or treated lumber. Composites may last longer, but the initial {{investment}} {{is likely to}} be higher. Many composites are formulated to be fade, scratch, and stain resistant, but no lumber is immune to the elements. Although composite lumber may resist these marring effects better than other materials, it will still show signs of wear over time. Composite lumber often has a plastic-like or synthetic appearance. Although manufacturers do mold the product with a wood <b>grain</b> or <b>brush</b> stroke pattern, some consumers simply do not like the artificial sheen.|$|R
50|$|A dull polish is {{procured}} by rubbing beeswax {{into the}} wood. It must be thoroughly rubbed in, a little turpentine being added as a lubricant when the rubber works stiffly. If paint were applied over the bare knots of new wood {{it would be}} destroyed, or at least discolored, by the exudation of resin from the knots. For the purpose of obviating this the knots are covered with two coats of a preparation called knotting, made by dissolving shellac in methylated spirit. Putty is required for stopping nail-holes and small crevices and irregularities in woodwork. It is made of powdered whiting and linseed oil mixed together and kneaded into a stiff paste. For light work hard stopping, made of white lead and whiting, should be employed. The tools and appliances of the painter are mixing pots, paint kettles to hold the color for the painter at work, strainer, palette knife, scraping knife, hacking, stopping and chisel knives, the hammer, sponge, pumice, blow-lamp for burning off, {{and a variety of}} brushes, such as the duster, the ground brush, the tool, the distemper brush, the fitch and camel-hair pencil for picking out small parts and lines, the sable and flogger for gilding, the stippler; for grained work several steel graining combs with coarse and fine teeth, <b>graining</b> <b>brush</b> of hogs' hair, pencil over-grainer, and other special shaped brushes used to obtain the peculiar characteristics of different woods. It is absolutely necessary for good work to use brushes of a fine quality, and although expensive at first cost, they are undoubtedly cheapest in wear.|$|R
5000|$|Capped {{composite}} decking is composite decking, with a thin, approximately 1/16th inch, PVC-like veneer, or cap. This cap provides {{protection for}} the composite underneath. The cap is also formulated differently, {{in order to provide}} increased fade, stain, and scratch resistance. Capped composite decking is more expensive than both normal composite decking and wood decking because of the more involved manufacturing process in adding the second, co extruded layer to the board. [...] Capped composites also lack the feel of real wood. Although manufacturers form the product with a realistic wood <b>grain</b> or <b>brush</b> stroke, some contractors and deck owners will not accept the artificial sheen. Capped composites, although formulated to resist fading, stains, and scratches, will show some wear over time, even if it is less than a normal composite or real wood product.|$|R
40|$|Lithography in {{the minds}} of most people is a method of {{reproducing}} a photograph or artwork by means of a halftone screen. The screen, usually no finer than 400 lines per inch reproduces the image by varying degrees of density through control of the dot size. With screenless printing the image is reproduced without the screen, resulting in much better detail. The purpose of this thesis is to determine what type of plate material will work best with the 2 ̆ 2 Association Product Coating 2 ̆ 2, since the ST Sumner Williams plate that worked well with this coating is no longer produced. The criterion for a good plate is that it produce a full range of densities and run cleanly. This study is to determine whether a finely grained plate such as the <b>brush</b> <b>grain,</b> is the plate to use with the coating. Testing was done at different coating concentrations, different exposure times with different plate materials, and with different concentrations of prime coats. It was also theorized that perhaps the sensitizer {{had something to do with}} how the coating performed. The concentra tion of the sensitizer was varied in each test to see how much of a change there was. The test did prove that the coating worked with the finer grained plates, and that prime coats would reduce the amount of scrumming on the plate. It was also found that a one percent concentration of sensitizer worked the best...|$|R
40|$|Antelope’ (Reg. no. CV- 968, PI 633910) {{is a hard}} white {{winter wheat}} (Triticum aestivum L.) {{cultivar}} developed cooperatively by USDA-ARS, the Nebraska Agricultural Experiment Station, and the Wyoming Agricultural Experiment Station. Antelope has shown exceptional productivity under irrigated trials in western Nebraska, eastern Wyoming, and eastern Colorado. It combines high grain yield under irrigation with excellent lodging resistance. Antelope {{was derived from the}} cross ‘Pronghorn’/‘Arlin’. Pronghorn (PI 593047, Baenziger et al., 1997) is a strong gluten hard red winter wheat developed by the University of Nebraska. Arlin (PI 564246, Sears et al., 1997) is a hard white winter wheat developed by Kansas State University. Antelope was produced from a cross made in 1993. F 1 through F 3 generations were advanced by the bulk pedigree method. From the F 3 generation, 100 single-plant-progeny rows were planted. Antelope subsequently was selected from one of these rows as a single F 3 –derived F 4 line and assigned the experimental number NW 97 S 278. Breeder seed originated from a composite of 30 F 9 –derived headrows which were selected for uniformity in plant type and grain color. Antelope is awned and white-glumed. The glume beak is awned, and the shoulder is elevated to apiculate. Kernels are elliptical, with a narrow, mid-deep crease, rounded beak, and mid-sized <b>brush.</b> <b>Grain</b> samples provided to USDA-GIPSA were classified as hard white, with color characteristics acceptable for this class. Antelope contains approximately 0. 1 % hard red grain and also contains tall off-types at a frequency of approximately 0. 5 %. Coleoptile length (37 mm) is shorter than that of Pronghorn (66 mm), and similar to that of ‘Nuplains’ (36 mm). Average plant height (81 cm) is shorter than that of ‘Arapahoe’ (92 cm) but greater than that of Nuplains (78 cm) ...|$|R
