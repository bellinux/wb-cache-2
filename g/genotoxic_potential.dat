Molecular functional groups that render starting materials and synthetic intermediates as reactive building blocks for small molecules may also be responsible for their genotoxicity.

40|$|Nucleoside analogues (NAs) {{have been}} the most {{frequently}} used treatment option for chronic hepatitis B patients. However, they may have <b>genotoxic</b> <b>potentials</b> due to their interference with nucleic acid metabolism. Entecavir, a deoxyguanosine analog, {{is one of the most}} widely used oral antiviral NAs against hepatitis B virus. It has reported that entecavir gave positive responses in both genotoxicity and carcinogenicity assays. However the genotoxic mechanism of entecavir remains elusive. To evaluate the genotoxic mechanisms, we analyzed the effect of entecavir on a panel of chicken DT 40 B-lymphocyte isogenic mutant cell line deficient in DNA repair and damage tolerance pathways. Our results showed that Parp 1 -/- mutant cells defective in single-strand break (SSB) repair were the most sensitive to entecavir. Brca 1 -/-, Ubc 13 -/- and translesion-DNA-synthesis deficient cells including Rad 18 -/- and Rev 3 -/- were hypersensitive to entecavir. XPA-/- mutant deficient in nucleotide excision repair was also slightly sensitive to entecavir. γ-H 2 AX foci forming assay confirmed the existence of DNA damage by entecavir in Parp 1 -/-, Rad 18 -/- and Brca 1 -/- mutants. Karyotype assay further showed entecavir-induced chromosomal aberrations, especially the chromosome gaps in Parp 1 -/-, Brca 1 -/-, Rad 18 -/- and Rev 3 -/- cells when compared with wild-type cells.

If genotoxic lesions are produced in the bacterial genome, the umuC gene is induced {{as part of the}} general SOS response. The plasmid pSK1002 contains the umuC gene fused to the lacZ reporter gene, much like the fusion in the SOS Chromotest. The induction of the umuC-gene is thus a measure for the <b>genotoxic</b> <b>potential</b> of the sample. Since the umuC-gene is fused with the lacZ-gene for β-galactosidase, the induction of the umuC-gene can be easily assessed by determination of the β-galactosidase activity, measured by the conversion of a colorless ONPG substrate (o-nitrophenyl-β-D-galactopyranoside) to the yellow product o-nitrophenyl by the lacZ-encoded B-galactosidase.|$|E

This test was developed as a practical complement or alternative to the traditional Ames test assay for genotoxicity, which involves growing bacteria on agar plates and comparing natural mutation rates to mutation rates of bacteria exposed to potentially mutagenic compounds or samples.

This short-term test, deals with the determination of alterations in mitotic crossing-over frequencies eventually involving heterozygous auxotrophic genes in diploid strains of Aspergillus nidulans. In this way, treatments of UT 448 //UT 184 and Dp II-I//UT 184 diploid strains with the natural products showed that saponin and lac-tone significantly increased the homozygotization index (HI) of both strains, especially for the diploid Dp II-I//UT 184.

In sediment pore waters of the investigated rivers a low mutagenic potential could be measured occasionally when standard test strains were used. However, the fractionation of sediment extracts showed that particle bound genotoxic substances are detectable especially in the medium polar fractions. PAH, including several that are listed as priority hazardous compounds in Annex X of the EU WFD, contribute significantly to the mutagenic potential. Nevertheless, many compounds that were previously not defined as priority hazardous substances play an important role. As an example Dibenzopyrene isomers were identified, some of which have a high <b>genotoxic</b> (and carcinogenic) <b>potential.</b> The extention of the test battery to metabolically competent test strains which express enzymes of xenobiotic metabolism pathways, broadened significantly the range of detectable genotoxins in direction of medium polar to polar compounds. These test strains also showed mutagenicity in pore waters of fresh sediments. In a contaminated site in the Elbe catchment area, many heterocyclic and N-substituted compounds were detected, possibly determining the high mutagenic potential of the site.|$|R
40|$|Introduction: Euphorbia tirucalli Lineu, {{commonly}} known as Aveloz, is a very common plant found in tropical regions [1]. The ingestion or contact with its latex causes symptoms such as vomiting and diarrhea, pallor, skin irritation, hepatotoxicity as well as carcinogenesis [2]. Moreover, the Aveloz latex is also responsible for a few important activities against some infectious and neoplastic diseases. Aveloz latex phytochemical composition may vary according to seasonal aspects and geographic location [3], and it is used either orally or topically in traditional medicine. Popularly known as an antitumoral agent (breast, prostate, lung, kidney), it is used not only in Brazil, but in several other countries. According to the literature, the latex could have a dual behaviour, activating or inhibiting tumoral events [3 - 6]. However, there are few reports discussing these mechanisms. Besides, the mutagenic and <b>genotoxic</b> <b>potentials</b> of phytochemical and homeopathic Aveloz {{have not yet been}} described. Several experimental methods have been used to evaluate the mutagenic and genotoxic effects, such as Inductest, the Ames test and the chromotest. Objective: This study aims to evaluate the <b>genotoxic</b> and mutagenic <b>potentials</b> of Aveloz latex and Aveloz phytotherapic and homeopathic solutions. Methodology: In this study, Aveloz 5 and 30 cH are prepared according to Brazilian Homeopathic Pharmacopoeia [7], from Aveloz latex collected in the Center for Natural Products Research (NPPN) at the Universidade Federal do Rio de Janeiro [8]. The Aveloz phytochemical solution was prepared following the doses used in folk medicine: 2 drops diluted in 250 ml of water and 2 drops diluted in 25 ml of water. All test solutions were submitted to the following methodologies: (a) Inductest: assesses the ability of physical or chemical agents to promote lysogenic induction as a response to DNA damage in lysogenic bacteria; (b) The Ames test: uses indicator strains of Salmonella typhimurium, which are sensitive to substances that can induce different types of mutation; (c) Chromotest: evaluates the genotoxicity of chemicals through the induction of the bacterial SOS system. Results: In the Inductest there was no decrease in bacterial survival fraction and no increase in lysogenic cycle. As measured by The Ames test and the chromotest no mutagenic or <b>genotoxic</b> <b>potentials</b> were detected. Discussion: The homeopathic and the phytochemical Aveloz solutions were unable to produce lysogenic induction or mutagenesis in bacterial cells and they were also unable to produce genotoxic effects, as measured by chromotest. Conclusion: Our results showed that no mutagenic or genotoxic damages were induced by all Aveloz preparations studied, thus we are led to believe that patients using Aveloz as a complementary therapy present no side effects in relation to mutagenesis and genotoxicity...|$|R

Liu and colleagues highlighted that high flow events by the Ammer River may result in the redistribution of sediments [39], which may clarify why autumn S 2 samples induced stronger teratogenic impairments compared to the spring ones. A similar process was reported at the lower Neckar area as well: there were persistent organic compounds (polychlorinated dibenzo-p-dioxins, dibenzofurans, polychlorinated biphenyls, polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons) detected in settling particulate matter (SPM) during a flood event in the Heidelberg region [40]. Hollert and co-workers [41] investigated the cyto- and <b>genotoxic</b> <b>potentials</b> of the above-mentioned river samples: SPM taken {{during the period of}} flood rise showed the highest cytotoxic activities in the neutral red retention assay, while the Ames test delivered no evidence for any genotoxic activity.

Whereas their evaluation is conducted under the purpose of human risk assessment, an ecotoxicological assessment of the consequences for populations of aquatic organisms such as fish still owes. Therefore, effects of two genotoxic chemicals on the population of zebrafish (Danio rerio), the DNA and the genetic structure were investigated. Zebrafish were exposed in a complete life cycle test {{and the consequences of}} the observed effects on population level were simulated using a mathematical model. At first, benzo[a]pyrene (BaP) was chosen as a model genotoxicant. The test concentrations were 3, 7, 18, 64, and 193 ng/L. These concentrations are in the range of BaP concentrations found in surface waters. The BaP concentrations tested did not affect survial and growth, neither in the f 1 - nor in the f 2 -generation. Only in the highest BaP concentration the egg production in the f 1 -generation was retarded for 2 weeks. With the genotoxicity assays used, only primary DNA alterations could be detected, but no secondary DNA alterations or effects on the genetic structure could be observed. Only in the highest BaP concentration, bioaccumulation of BaP in fish could be detected, the accumulation factor was 30. Consequently, the tested BaP concentrations presumablye will not have serious effects on fish populations. The second model compound was 4 -nitrochinoline- 1 -oxide (4 -NQO). The test concentrations were 0. 1, 0. 3, 1. 1, 2. 9, and 14. 6 #mu#g/L. Whereas in concentrations up to 2. 9 #mu#g/L survial and growth were not affected, neither in the f 1 - nor in the f 2 -generation, the f 1 -fish in 14. 6 #mu#g/L became extinct. In all 4 -NQO treatments from 0. 1 to 2. 9 #mu#g/L, the egg production was significantly reduced, leading to an increased risk of extinction for the fish population. Even in 0. 1 #mu#g/L the DNA repair was induced, while primary and secondary DNA alterations became visible in the higher concentrations. The genetic structure revealed differences between 4 -NQO treated fish and the controls, but no differences between the f 1 - and the f 2 -generation. Within the present work, we could show that genotoxic chemicals can influence the reproduction. This will lead to an increasing risk of extinction for concerned populations. Therefore, the assessment of <b>genotoxic</b> <b>potentials</b> in surface waters has to be discussed from an ecotoxicological point of view. (orig.)
