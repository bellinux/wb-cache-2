Highlander is a fantasy series, yet I cared about the characters as though <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>them...</b> Vandernoot gave Tessa such vitality and charm that her death left me reeling."

2500|$|She then {{wrote to}} her mother, Queen Victoria: ...I have heard {{different}} things about poor Rudolf which may perhaps interest you. Prince Bismarck {{told me that the}} violent scenes and altercations between the Emperor and Rudolf had been the cause of Rudolf's suicide. I replied that I had heard this much doubted, upon which he said Reuss had written it and it was so! He would send me the despatch to read if I liked, but I have declined. I did not say what I thought, which is that for thirty years I have had the experience of how many lies Prince Bismarck's diplomatic agents (with some exceptions) have written him, and therefore I usually disbelieve what they write completely, unless <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>them</b> to be honest and trustworthy men. Szechenyi, the Ambassador at Berlin, whom we know very well, tells me that there had been no scenes with the Emperor, who said to Szechenyi: Dies ist der erste Kummer, den mein Sohn mir macht.|$|E
2500|$|While Borges was {{the great}} popularizer of the review of an {{imaginary}} work, he had developed the idea from Thomas Carlyle's Sartor Resartus, a book-length review of a non-existent German transcendentalist work, and the biography of its equally non-existent author. In This Craft of Verse, Borges says that in 1916 in Geneva [...] " [...] discovered, and was overwhelmed by, Thomas Carlyle. I read Sartor Resartus, and I can recall many of its pages; <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>them</b> by heart." [...] In the introduction to his first published volume of fiction, The Garden of Forking Paths, Borges remarks, [...] "It is a laborious madness and an impoverishing one, the madness of composing vast books, setting out in five hundred pages an idea that can be perfectly related orally in five minutes. The better {{way to go about}} it is to pretend that those books already exist, and offer a summary, a commentary on them." [...] He then cites both Sartor Resartus and Samuel Butler's The Fair Haven, remarking, however, that [...] "those works suffer under the imperfection that they themselves are books, and not a whit less tautological than the others. A more reasonable, more inept, and more lazy man, I have chosen to write notes on imaginary books." ...|$|E
2500|$|The classic Bible passage cited {{to prove}} a limited extent to the atonement is [...] in which Jesus uses {{shepherding}} practices {{as a metaphor for}} his relationship to his followers. A shepherd of those times would call his sheep from a mix of flocks, and his sheep would hear his voice and follow, while the sheep of other flocks would ignore any but their own shepherd's voice.. In that context, Jesus says, [...] "I am the good shepherd. I know my own and my own know me, ...and I lay down my life for the sheep," [...] and he tells the Pharisees that they [...] "do not believe because [...] are not part of [...] flock." [...] He continues, [...] "My sheep hear my voice, and <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>them,</b> and they follow me. I give them eternal life, and they will never perish, and no one will snatch them out of my hand." [...] Since Calvinists (and many other Christians) believe that not all have eternal life with God, Calvinists conclude that there are only two possibilities: either Jesus was wrong in saying that he would lose none of his sheep (a conclusion they reject), or Jesus must not have laid down his life for everyone, as they understand [...] to imply. Formally, the Calvinist position can be expressed this way: ...|$|E
