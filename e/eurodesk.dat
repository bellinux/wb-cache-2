5000|$|The European Youth Portal is an {{initiative}} of the European Commission and was launched in 1991. The portal was suggested in the European Commission's White Paper [...] "A new impetus for European Youth". It has been developed with and for young people, particularly in association with <b>Eurodesk</b> and the European Youth Forum. In April 2009, the European Commission adopted the EU Youth Strategy. One of the strategy's objectives is to enhance the participation of all young people in society and to increase their participation in civic life and in representative democracy. It is also stated in the Council Resolution of 27 November 2009 on a renewed framework for European cooperation in the youth field (2010-2018)." [...] To this end, the European Commission re-launched the European Youth Portal in May 2013 with a new look and feel, and new content. It replaced the previous one which was no longer meeting the growing expectations of its young audience.|$|E
