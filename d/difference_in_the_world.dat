500|$|Homer takes Bart's sons to a {{cryonics}} {{facility where}} Grampa has been frozen alive {{to prevent a}} disease from killing him. Although a cure has now been discovered, he is kept frozen by Homer because it is cheaper than paying for a nursing home and because Grampa has constantly been rude to him. Homer says to the boys that they should give their father another chance, since he knows Bart loves them. At that point, Bart arrives and apologizes to his sons, admitting how much he treasures them. Touched, the two boys forgive him for not having included them [...] in his life much, while an inspired Homer decides to unfreeze Grampa and forgive him as well. Meanwhile, Lisa goes into the Ultranet to find Zia and discovers a door leading into Zia's private world. Entering it, Lisa is overjoyed to find that Zia has hung a poster of her next {{to a series of}} posters depicting historical women who have made a <b>difference</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>world.</b> When Zia arrives, Lisa thanks her for looking up to her and the two reconcile at last, and secretly hides her life as a party poser. With the conflicts resolved, Bart and Lisa gather their children in preparation for a new Christmas family photo. Marge arrives with Maggie, who has given birth to a baby girl. The Simpsons gather into a group just as the family pets (who have evolved greatly over the past thirty years) take the new photo.|$|E

An interesting aspect of this competency was a value on the use of humor to diffuse tense or stressful situations. This is an often overlooked aspect of successful leadership, but one that is quickly recognized and appreciated in those leaders who use humor appropriately.|$|R

2500|$|The first {{production}} meeting between U2 and their creative {{team for the}} Innocence + Experience Tour was held in March 2013. Although Songs of Innocence was still in progress {{at the time and}} did not yet have a title, the autobiographical narrative that would characterise the album was already a driving idea for their tour. The band wanted {{to tell the story of}} their adolescence in Dublin in the 1970s and how they were [...] "trying to figure out how they fit into the often violent and disrupted world outside" [...] their homes. The manifesto for the tour was summarized by two phrases: [...] "I can't change the world, but I can change the world in me", and [...] "I can the change the world, but I can't change the world in me." [...] The first is a lyric from the band's 1981 song [...] "Rejoice" [...] and represents the mindset of a teenage Bono feeling powerless to make a difference in a world plagued by the Troubles, who instead views personal psychological changes as a possibility; the second phrase represents the modern-day realization that the same person could make a <b>difference</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>world</b> through philanthropic efforts but still struggle with the complexities of internal change. Devlin said, [...] "The space between these two statements is the territory of the album and of the show." [...] The band intended to stage shows in pairs and alternate the setlist between [...] "innocence" [...] and [...] "experience" [...] motifs night to night. Williams said, [...] "The artfulness in this tour is in the ideas, not the hardware".|$|E

50|$|<b>The</b> biggest <b>difference</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>worlds,</b> besides cosmetics, is {{how each}} world has a {{specific}} tool associated with it.

Creepy Castle contains the Ghost Trap, usable for passing through stone walls as well as beating ghosts. Slime Sewers contains the Snail Sucker, {{which is the only}} weapon that directly removes an enemy from the map. Bubble Barrage contains the Freeze-o-matic as well. When underwater, however, the frozen enemies float up so the game considers it a separate tool. Also Bubble Barrage uniquely contains the Bubble Suit.|$|R

40|$|In {{order to}} provide a {{coherent}} perspective of gender <b>differences</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>world</b> of work, <b>the</b> many intersections of paid and unpaid work must be brought to light. It is well documented that gender-based wage differentials and occupational segregation continue to characterize {{the division of labor}} among men and women in paid work; yet unpaid work in social reproduction, subsistence production, family businesses, and the community is often ignored. When it is taken into account, it is usually done in a very limited manner, equating unpaid work with the traditional roles women play in raising children and performing maintenance chores. Beyond the obvious gender inequalities characterizing the latter, unpaid work constitutes an integral part of any functioning economy, and as such is linked to economic growth, government policy, migration, and many development issues. This paper concludes that the "world of work" cannot be treated in complete disregard to unpaid forms of labor, and gender equality must be understood through the lens of the paid–unpaid work continuum. ...|$|R

The structure of Babel assumes that functional categories are originally lacking in a child's syntax, and are acquired through a statistical induction process of lexical acquisition.

This model makes a number of predictions about the time course of language acquisition.
