The empirical analysis shows that the probability of being a <b>fast</b> <b>growing</b> firm depends on different factors when separating Eastern and Western Germany as well as using different definitions of <b>fast</b> <b>growing</b> firms. Moreover, the analysis shows that technology-intensive manufacturing branches and knowledge based business related services do not generate the majority of <b>fast</b> <b>growing</b> firms...|$|R
