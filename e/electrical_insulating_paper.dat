40|$|Breakdown {{strength}} {{is an important}} <b>electrical</b> property of <b>insulating</b> <b>paper.</b> Oil-impregnated paper of various aging states was prepared. Its breakdown voltage was then measured at pulsating direct current (DC) voltage with various ripple factors, and alternating current (AC) and DC voltage for comparison, respectively. The AC breakdown voltage is the smallest, and pulsating DC (r = 1 / 5) breakdown voltage is the greatest before the paper reaches its end of life. A dielectric model was adopted to investigate the difference in magnitude of breakdown voltage at different voltage waveforms. Meanwhile, {{it was found that}} breakdown voltage fluctuated and even increased occasionally during the thermal aging process, and a somewhat opposite changing tendency versus aging time was observed for breakdown voltage at DC voltage and pulsating DC voltage with small ripple factors (r = 1 / 5 and 1 / 3), compared with AC voltage. The degree of polymerization (DP) and moisture content of the paper were measured, and the characteristics of the pores and cracks of the paper were obtained to investigate the possible influencing factors of breakdown voltage at different aging states. The results showed that the moisture content, oil absorption ability associated with pores and cracks of paper, and the damage to paper structure all contributed to the variation of the breakdown voltage versus aging time, while the importance of their influence differed as the aging state of paper varied...|$|R

40|$|Introduction Safe {{hands-on}} defibrillation (HOD) {{will allow}} uninterrupted chest compression during defibrillation and may improve resuscitation success. We tested {{the ability of}} <b>electrical</b> <b>insulating</b> gloves to protect the rescuer during HOD using a ‘worst case’ electrical scenario. Materials and method Leakage current flowing from the patient to the ‘rescuer’ during antero-lateral defibrillation of patients undergoing elective cardioversion was measured. The ‘rescuer’ maintained firm (20 kgf) contact with the patient during defibrillation, wearing Class 1 <b>electrical</b> <b>insulating</b> gloves while simulating an inadvertent contact with the patient, through an additional wired contact between ‘rescuer’ and patient. Results Data from 61 shocks from 43 different patients were recorded. The median leakage current from all defibrillations was 20. 0 ?A, (range: 2. 0 – 38. 5). In total, 18 of the shocks were delivered at 360 J and had a median leakage current of 27. 0 ?A (range: 14. 3 – 38. 5). Conclusion When using Class 1 <b>electrical</b> <b>insulating</b> gloves for hands-on defibrillation, rescuer leakage current is significantly below the 1 mA safe threshold, allowing safe hands-on defibrillation if the rescuer makes only one other point of contact with the patient...|$|R

Furthermore, we determine the electric field value, at which the resistance of <b>insulating</b> <b>paper</b> soaked in transformer oil can be considered dependent only on the temperature and humidity.
