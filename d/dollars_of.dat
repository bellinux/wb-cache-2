The average markup was {{as low as}} − 19 percent for annuities and − 57 percent for life insurance. This extraordinary pricing behavior was due to financial and product market frictions, interacting with statu-tory reserve regulation that allowed life insurers to record far less than a <b>dollar</b> <b>of</b> reserve per <b>dollar</b> <b>of</b> fu-ture insurance liability. We identify the shadow cost of capital through exogenous variation in required reserves across different types of policies.
