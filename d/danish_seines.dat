25|$|Inoffensive to humans, {{the eastern}} shovelnose stingaree {{can be easily}} {{approached}} underwater. Its flesh is edible, albeit rather chewy unless properly prepared. This species is caught incidentally by coastal commercial fisheries in beach and <b>Danish</b> <b>seines</b> and bottom trawls, especially by the Southern and Eastern Scalefish and Shark Fishery (SESSF).

Further threats to this species may include habitat degradation and disturbance from coastal development and recreational activities, and invasive species. The eastern shovelnose stingaree population of Port Phillip is known to have declined over the past decade, which coupled with continuing fishing pressure has led the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) to list it as Near Threatened. Its range does encompass some refuge areas, such as the Bass Strait where little trawling occurs, and several Marine Protected Areas (MPAs) recently set aside off Victoria.

40|$|A {{study was}} {{undertaken}} at twelve fish landing sites in Java and Kalimantan Islands, west central Indonesia, from June 2005 to October 2006 {{to overcome the}} lack of knowledge on chondrichthyan species in Indonesia. Data were collected for seven consecutive days at each site from fish landings, including species diversity, fisheries, utilizations, and biological data of chondrichthyan species. A total of 23, 454 individuals of chondrichthyans, 104 species and 28 families were recorded from 12 landing sites during the study, with an estimated total biomass of more than 70, 000 kg. This total consisted of 65 species of shark representing 16 families and 58 species of rays representing 11 families and a single species of holocephalan. Dasyatidae and Carcharhinidae were the most common families recorded. Dasyatis kuhlii (Dasyatidae) was the most abundant chondrichthyan species in this study, while Himantura gerrardi contributed most to the total biomass. Ordination of abundance values showed a segregation between the sites that had fishing grounds in shallow waters (the Java Sea, Karimata Strait) and sites that fished the deeper waters (the Indian Ocean, Makassar {{and a part of}} Sunda Strait). The shallower areas were typified by some common dasyatids and inshore sharks, and the deeper areas by large, oceanic and deep water chondrichthyans. The present study also identified which types of fishing gear contributed most to the total biomass and size of elasmobranch landings. A total of fifteen types of fishing gear are used from fishing vessels operating in the Java Sea and adjacent area (including Karimata Strait, Sunda Strait, Makassar Strait) and off south Java (the Indian Ocean) to catch chondrichthyan fishes, either as bycatch or as target of fishing. Set gillnet was the most common gear that caught chondrichthyan fishes, but <b>Danish</b> <b>seine</b> nets contributed most to both the total number and total biomass of chondrichthyan fishes captured in the observed area during the study. The <b>Danish</b> <b>seine</b> net (cantrang) was the least selective gear that caught elasmobranchs in Java and Kalimantan during the study, following by bottom lampara nets and set gillnets that were operated in inshore waters. <b>Danish</b> <b>seine</b> nets were also considered to contribute most to overall fishing pressure in the Java Sea. H. gerrardi contributed most to the total biomass of batoids captured in the <b>Danish</b> <b>seine</b> fishery from Batang landing site which is the largest contributor to the total catch of elasmobranchs in west central Indonesia. H. gerrardi is categorized as the “first class” {{and one of the most}} sought after rays in the skin industry at Batang due to the quality of its skin. Most elasmobranch products are utilized and marketed locally and some others are sold to large cities or other countries due to their high values, such as fins, gill rakers, skins and cartilage. The present study of chondrichthyan diversity in west central Indonesia also provides detailed data on the size composition and reproductive biology of some common elasmobranchs in the region. Size composition of each species varies among regions and fishing areas. Species that were caught in large numbers from heavily fished areas matured earlier than those from the lower fishing pressure areas. Precocious maturity of some dominant species may also indicate the high level of fishing pressure in the area where they are occurred. Diets of some common dasyatids caught from the <b>Danish</b> <b>seine</b> fishery operating in the Java Sea were also investigated to find out the contribution of stomach fullness to the size and weight relationships variation. More than 90 % of the diet of H. gerrardi was crustaceans, represented by carid shrimps, mantis shrimps and penaeids.
