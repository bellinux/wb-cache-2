40|$|OBJECTIVE: The {{objective}} of the present study, with focus on gender, was aimed at evaluating alcohol-dependent individual in terms of socio-demographic variables related to alcohol consumption and therapeutic interventions. METHODS: This is a retrospective cross-sectional study of 1, 051 patients (833 men and 218 women), with diagnosis of alcohol dependence syndrome, according to ICD- 10 criteria, who had sought treatment {{for the first time}} at a specialised health centre between 2000 and 2006. RESULTS: The results showed that women, compared to men, are more likely to be unemployed and without partner, in addition to having higher educational level, latter age of alcohol initiation, needing less outpatient alcohol detoxification program, consuming more fermented beverage, presenting less psychiatric comorbidities, and using less coadjutant medications during treatment. CONCLUSION: We can state that some peculiarities exist permeating both gender and alcohol consumption. A further focus on the characteristics of each population is needed to facilitate the adequate use of therapeutic interventions according to <b>gender</b> <b>specificities...</b>|$|R

40|$|BACKGROUND: Epidemiological {{studies have}} {{indicated}} an association between musculoskeletal disorders (MSDs) and physical work demands. Psychosocial work demands have also been identified as possible risk factors, but findings have been inconsistent. OBJECTIVES: To evaluate factors associated with upper back, neck and upper limb MSD among workers from 14 plastic manufacturing companies located {{in the city of}} Salvador, Brazil. METHODS: A cross-sectional study design was used to survey a stratified proportional random sample of 577 workers. Data were collected by questionnaire interviews. Factor analysis was carried out on 11 physical demands variables. Psychosocial work demands were measured by demand, control and social support questions. The role of socio-demographic factors, lifestyle and household tasks was also examined. Multiple logistic regression was used to identify factors related to upper back, neck and upper limb MSDs. RESULTS: Results from multiple logistic regression showed that distal upper limb MSDs were related to manual handling, work repetitiveness, psychosocial demands, job dissatisfaction, and gender. Neck, shoulder or upper back MSDs were related to manual handling, work repetitiveness, psychosocial demands, job dissatisfaction, and physical unfitness. CONCLUSIONS: Reducing the prevalence of musculoskeletal disorders requires: improving the work environment, reducing biomechanical risk factors, and replanning work organization. Programs must also be aware of <b>gender</b> <b>specificities</b> related to MSDs...|$|R

40|$|Substance {{dependence}} is {{a complex}} environmental and genetic disorder with significant social and medical concerns. Understanding the etiology of substance dependence is imperative {{to the development of}} effective treatment and prevention strategies. To this end, substantial effort has been made to identify genes underlying substance dependence, and in recent years, genome-wide association studies (GWASs) have led to discoveries of numerous genetic variants for complex diseases including substance dependence. Most of the GWAS discoveries were only based on single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and a single dichotomized outcome. By employing both SNP- and gene-based methods of analysis, we identified a strong (odds ratio = 13. 87) and significant (P value = 1. 33 E− 11) association of an SNP in the NCK 2 gene on chromosome 2 with opiates addiction in African-origin men. Codependence analysis also identified a genome-wide significant association between NCK 2 and comorbidity of substance dependence (P value = 3. 65 E− 08) in African-origin men. Furthermore, we observed that the association between the NCK 2 gene (P value = 3. 12 E− 10) and opiates addiction reached the gene-based genome-wide significant level. In summary, our findings provided the first evidence for the involvement of NCK 2 in the susceptibility to opiates addiction and further revealed the racial and <b>gender</b> <b>specificities</b> of its impact...|$|R
40|$|Since 1999, {{rapid growth}} in {{transition}} countries of Europe and Central Asia Region (ECA), driven primarily by productivity gains, {{has led to a}} dramatic increase in living standards and a sharp reduction in poverty. Out of a total regional population of about 475 million, about 50 million have moved out of poverty over 1998 - 99 and 2005 - 06. Gender issues related to these economic outcomes have not been widely studied in the transition countries of the ECA Region though some important pieces of research have indeed been undertaken in recent years.

Methods Cross-examination of national data from law enforcement and drug use surveillance sources and of forensic evidence. Bi-variate and logistic regression analysis of male/female differences according to socio-demographics, forensic evidence and drug use trajectories. Results The burden of deaths caused by FOD on the general national mortality was higher for men (PMR/ 100 = 0. 55) compared with women (PMR/ 100 = 0. 34). Compared with their male peers, women were younger {{at the time of}} death (t= 3. 274; p=. 001) and showed shorter drug use careers (t= 2. 228; p=. 028). Heroin use was recorded more frequently in first drug offences of female victims [AOR= 6. 59 (95 % CI 2. 97 – 14. 63) ] and according to forensic evidence, psychotropic prescription drugs were detected to a higher degree in females [AOR= 2. 019 (95 % CI 1. 065 – 3. 827) ]. Conclusion The time window between the onset of illicit drug use and its fatal outcome revealed to be shorter for women versus men included in our study.

40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{focuses on}} the ideal of objectivity in science. My aim is to understand and situate how objectivity has been conceptualized {{in the philosophy of}} science, and to question whether these conceptualizations are consistent with the actual ways in which objectivity has been sought in scientific practice. I examine the dominant views of objectivity in mainstream philosophy of science and feminist reactions to them. Ultimately, I argue that Helen Longino’s understanding of objectivity, complemented by some aspects of Sandra Harding’s “strong objectivity”, provides a more comprehensive and practical ideal to guide scientific practice than the received view’s conception where objectivity is sought by adopting an impersonal methodology. One of the main criticisms against feminist epistemologies, which argue for the <b>gender</b> <b>specificity</b> of knowledge, is that they lead to epistemic relativism. And hence it is argued that feminist epistemologies undermine “scientific objectivity”. In arguing for the fruitfulness and consistency of a feminist account of objectivity, I examine in what ways claims about the <b>gender</b> <b>specificity</b> of knowledge could be understood without rendering the notion of objectivity redundant...|$|E
40|$|In Cameroon, rural {{women have}} a {{significant}} role in farming and post-harvest activities. Nevertheless, a complex set of rights and obligations reflecting social and religious norms prevail within rural communities, these dictate the division of labour between men and women and act as constraints to women farmers. In fact, women fulfil the reproductive roles of child bearing, home management and food provision for the family. Thus, these women are unable to exercise any influential economic voice, they can hardly earn income. Cash agriculture like cassava production provides a possible outlet for the empowerment of these women in cassava producing areas. However, this agricultural work would solve one problem for the women and create another. Any attempt to encourage these women to work outside their homes may increase their workload. This paper examine the situation of female cassava farmers in Bityili, a village of South region of Cameroon, by evaluating the <b>gender</b> <b>specificities</b> within division of labour, daily hours, access and control of resources and benefits. To address this, 44 women cassava producers-processors were randomly selected and interviewed.

Quantitative data were analysed using descriptive statistics. The results show that although cassava production may have been beneficial to women and the society as a whole, it has implications for gender roles that go beyond the purview of women’s empowerment.

40|$|IntroductionThe {{literature}} suggests that lung cancer may represent a different disease in women compared with men and that <b>gender</b> <b>specificities</b> have been reported mostly in clinical trials patients. MethodsWe conducted a retrospective, population-based study of a sample of 1738 patients diagnosed with a {{non-small cell lung cancer}} (NSCLC) in the department of Bas-Rhin (northeastern France) between 1982 and 1997. Our study aimed to describe symptoms at presentation, stage, histological distribution, treatment modalities, and survival, according to sex. ResultsTobacco exposure differed significantly according to sex: 28. 9 % of women were nonsmokers versus 1. 4 % of the men. More NSCLC were metastatic at diagnosis in women than in men (41. 1 % versus 29. 9 %). Adenocarcinoma predominated in women (54. 4 %), whereas squamous cell carcinoma predominated in men (65. 9 %). Invasive procedures, such as transthoracic needle biopsy, contributed more frequently to histological diagnosis in women. Men and women underwent the same procedures for disease staging, excepted for the abdominal computed tomography scan, which was performed more frequently in women. Treatment also differed: in resectable disease, fewer pneumonectomies were performed in women; in locally advanced disease, the mean doses of thoracic irradiation were significantly lower in women (48. 0 grays versus 55. 5 grays); in metastatic-stage disease, fewer women received platin-based chemotherapy, but this difference was not significant. Sex was not a significant prognostic factor in our study, contrary to most North American studies, where women seem to have had better survival rates.

Genesis of muscle is dependent on proliferation and differentiation potential of resident myogenic satellite cells (MSCs) present in muscle fibers. Multipotential capacity of forming myocyte, osteocyte, and adipocyte like cell makes MSCs a unique stem cell. To understand the molecular mechanism involved in determination of muscle quality due to difference in hormone concentration of different gender of animals, MSCs were isolated from bovine skeletal muscle and cultured in male, female, and castrated serum supplemented media. DNA microarray used consisted of 24, 000 spots with 70 mer oligo in each spot. A total of 88 genes were up-regulated and 551 genes were down-regulated by more than two fold. Among up-regulated gene, 33, 34, and 21 genes were found up-regulated in cells grown in male, female, and castrated serum, respectively. Interestingly, male serum showed 4, female 11 and castrated male showed 4 genes expressed highly in each gender.

Here we search for the factors that can potentially trigger gender differences in tuning to faces. By using a set of Face-n-Food images slightly bordering on the Giuseppe Arcimboldo style, we examine: (i) whether face resemblance is linked to gender specific face impression, and, if so, whether this association is perceiver gender specific; and (ii) whether images most resembling a face are also most likable for female and male perceivers. First, in a spontaneous recognition task, participants were shown a set of Face-n-Food images in a predetermined order from the least to most resembling a face. Then in a two-alternative forced-choice (2 AFC) task, participants judged whether each face appeared for them (i) either female or male (Exp. 1); or (ii) either likable or unlikable (Exp. 2). Remarkably, face resemblance is closely connected to gender specific impressions: images more resembling a face elicit also more female-face responses. This link is not perceiver gender specific as it occurs for both females and males. Moreover, face resemblance is positively linked to face likability, but this holds true only for female perceivers. The findings shed light on <b>gender</b> <b>specificity</b> in tuning to faces, and help to clarify abnormalities of the social brain in neurodevelopmental, psychiatric and psychosomatic disorders...|$|E

40|$|The gender {{information}} in written Chinese third person pronouns is not symmetrically encoded: the character for "he" (, with semantic radical, meaning human) {{is used as}} a default referring to every individual, while the character for "she" (, with semantic radical, meaning woman) indicates females only. This critical feature could result in different patterns of processing of gender {{information in}} text, but {{this is an issue that}} has seldom been addressed in psycholinguistics. In Chinese, the written forms of the reflexive pronouns are composed of a pronoun plus the reflexive "/self" (/himself and /herself). The present study focuses on how such <b>gender</b> <b>specificity</b> interacts with the gender type of an antecedent, whether definitional (proper name) or stereotypical (stereotypical role noun) during reflexive pronoun resolution. In this event-related potential (ERP) study, gender congruity between a reflexive pronoun and its antecedent was studied by manipulating the gender type of antecedents and the <b>gender</b> <b>specificity</b> of reflexive pronouns (default: /himself vs. specific: /herself). Results included a P 200 "attention related" congruity effect for /himself and a P 600 "integration difficulty" congruity effect for /herself. Reflexive pronoun specificity independently affected the P 200 and N 400 components. These results highlight the role of /himself as a default applicable to both genders and indicate that only the processing of /herself supports a two-stage model for anaphor resolution. While both reflexive pronouns are evaluated at the bonding stage, the processing of the gender-specific reflexive pronoun is completed in the resolution stage...|$|E

40|$|This {{thesis is}} {{a study of the}} {{experiences}} of French women deported to Nazi concentration camps during World War Two, conducted with reference to an extensive corpus of published and archival autobiographical testimonies written by French female camp survivors. The testimonies of French male survivors and non-French writers are also utilised to a lesser degree as supplementary and comparative sources. The thesis aims to contribute to concentration camp scholarship by configuring a hitherto unrealised comprehensive portrait of the French female body of writing, elucidating how French women depict their camp experience, their responses to the unique challenges of testimonial writing and the <b>gender</b> <b>specificity</b> of this literature. Focusing on those aspects which are most significant within the testimonies of French women, the study demonstrates how social and biological <b>gender</b> <b>specificity</b> shape and particularize the narratives of these women. It also encompasses the pivotal theme of inmate relations, revealing the simultaneous externalization and redefinition of the notion of prisoner privilege which occurs in these writers' portrayal of hierarchical prisoner interaction, as well as the marked emphasis which French female survivors place upon the concepts of solidarity, mutual aid and collective structures. The purely textual level is also examined, detailing both the variety of responses to the issues of testimonial writing manifested by these writers and the cross-narrative authorial conception of the testimony as ultimately problematic. These areas of inquiry combine to yield a portrait of a highly complex testimonial genre, characterized by often unresolved tensions which are reflective of the complex and consistently nuanced nature of the wider camp experience...|$|E
40|$|International audienceBACKGROUND: Expanding HIV testing {{requires}} {{a better understanding}} of barriers to its uptake. We investigated barriers to HIV testing in Côte d'Ivoire, taking into account test circumstances (client vs. provider-initiated). METHODS: We used data from the 2005 nationally representative Demographic and Health Survey conducted in Côte d'Ivoire. Socio-demographic characteristics, sexual behaviour and knowledge and attitudes toward HIV/AIDS associated with recent (< 2 years) HIV testing were identified using gender-specific univariate and multivariate logistic regressions. Among women, differential effects of barriers to testing according to test circumstance (whether they have been offered for a prenatal test or not) were assessed through interaction tests. RESULTS: Recent HIV testing was reported by 6. 1 % of men and 9. 5 % of women (including 4. 6 % as part of antenatal care). Among men, having a low socioeconomic status, having a low HIV-related knowledge level and being employed [compared to those inactive: adjusted Odds Ratio (aOR) 0. 46; 95 % confidence interval (CI) 0. 25 - 0. 87] were associated with lower proportions of recent HIV testing. Among women without a prenatal HIV testing offer, living outside the capital (aOR 0. 38; CI 0. 19 - 0. 77) and reporting a unique lifetime sexual partner constituted additional barriers to HIV testing. By contrast, among women recently offered to be tested in prenatal care, none of these variables was found to be associated with recent HIV testing. CONCLUSIONS: Various dimensions of individuals' characteristics constituted significant barriers to HIV testing in Côte d'Ivoire in 2005, with <b>gender</b> <b>specificities.</b> Such barriers are substantially reduced when testing was proposed in the framework of antenatal care. This suggests that provider-initiated testing strategies may help overcome individual barriers to HIV testing...|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{this paper}} was to examine, via a scoping review, how the {{literature}} focusing on immigrant women’s health, based on selected criteria, has been able to capture not only sex and gender differences but also the other socially grounded determinants of health. Using selected health databases as well as a diversity of keywords, a final sample of 59 was obtained after a number of steps to increase validity and credibility of the process were taken. Since “women” {{was one of the main}} keywords, all of the studies included women either by themselves (n= 20 / 59) or along with men (n= 39 / 59). In 34 (57. 6 %) of the papers reviewed, gender was defined above and beyond “sex” (i. e. some discussion was provided regarding the social context of the study population prior to the presentation of the goal of the study). Ethnicity was merely mentioned without being expanded upon and at times being substituted with race in 26 (44 %) of the papers reviewed. Migration was defined in 22 (37. 2 %) of the papers and was predominantly operationalized by length of stay in the country. While the concepts at hand represent important units of analysis within women’s health research, most studies neglected to either capture <b>gender</b> <b>specificities</b> beyond sex as a biological variable, or to define migration experiences beyond ethnic identity. Anchored within women’s health scholarship seeking for conceptual clarity and accuracy, this paper pleads for an improved consideration of the multiple and interactive social and biological determinants of health, as well as structural conditions at the basis of structural inequities; If the production of socially grounded women’s health research depends upon accurate, fully integrated and applied conceptualizations of relevant dimensions, how can this be facilitated by policy-makers, health research funding bodies, the researchers themselves and ultimately by health care practitioners...|$|R
25|$|Perceived: animates. Some {{animals have}} the {{propensity}} {{to be addressed}} and cast as being of one gender over the others, across the board, regardless of the biological gender of the specific organism being referred to. Thus spiders are masculine: karoḷiyo, cats feminine: bilāṛī, and rabbits neuter: saslũ. These three can be cast into other <b>genders</b> if such <b>specificity</b> is desired, but as explained that would be deviation from the default rather than a scenario of three equally valid choices.|$|R
