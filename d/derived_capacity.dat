The average-power-constrained capacity of such systems is considered under two different assumptions on the knowledge about the fading available at the transmitter: the case in which the transmitter has no knowledge of fading at all, and the case in which the transmitter has knowledge of the distribution of the fading process but not the instantaneous CSI. The exact capacity is given for the former case while capacity bounds are derived for the latter case. A new signalling scheme is also proposed for the latter case and it is shown that by exploiting the knowledge of Rician-ness at the transmitter via this signalling scheme, significant capacity gain can be achieved.

Moreover, we prove that a priori knowledge of the erasure at the encoder does not increase the feedback capacity. The feedback capacity was calculated using an equivalent dynamic programming (DP) formulation with an optimal average-reward that is equal to the capacity. Furthermore, we obtained an optimal encoding procedure from the solution of the DP, leading to a capacity-achieving, zero-error coding scheme for our setting. DP is, thus, shown to be a tool not only for solving optimization problems, such as capacity calculation, but also for constructing optimal coding schemes.

Suppose that the large-scale antenna arrays at both macro BS and SC nodes employ maximum-ratio transmission (MRT) or zero-forcing transmission (ZFT) precoding, and transmit data streams to the served users simultaneously. A new pilot reuse pattern among SCs is proposed for channel estimation. Taking into account imperfect channel state information (CSI), capacity lower bounds for MRT and ZFT are derived, respectively, in closed-form expressions involving only statistical CSI. Then asymptotic analyses for massive arrays are presented under specific power scaling laws. Subsequently, two user scheduling algorithms, greedy scheduling algorithm and asymptotical scheduling algorithm (ASA), are proposed based on <b>derived</b> <b>capacity</b> lower bounds and asymptotic analyses, respectively. ASA is demonstrated to be a near optimal in the asymptotic regime and has low complexity.

This industry has been affected by a range of challenges over the past decades, which includes reoccurring disease outbreaks, the management of food security, biodiversity and environmental degradation risks, severe weather events and increased market competition from Australia's Pacific oyster industry. SRO production appears to be particularly challenged in the Queensland's Moreton Bay, the northern most cultivation area of the industry. Today, it is unclear whether this situation is due to oyster farmer's business choices, personal traits or whether environmental conditions in the Moreton Bay limit the economic capacity of the oyster industry in this region. In this study we assess the economic capacity and capacity utilisation of the Queensland SRO industry using cross-sectional time-series data.

40|$|Consider the {{simultaneous}} relay channel (SRC) {{which consists of}} a set of relay channels where the source wishes to transmit common and private information to each of the destinations. This problem is recognized as being equivalent to that of sending common and private information to several destinations in presence of helper relays where each channel outcome becomes a branch of the broadcast relay channel (BRC). Cooperative schemes and capacity region for a set with two memoryless relay channels are investigated. The proposed coding schemes, based on Decode-and-Forward (DF) and Compress-and-Forward (CF) must be capable of transmitting information simultaneously to all destinations in such set. Depending on the quality of source-to-relay and relay-to-destination channels, inner bounds on the capacity of the general BRC are derived. Three cases of particular interest are considered: cooperation is based on DF strategy for both users [...] referred to as DF-DF region [...] , cooperation is based on CF strategy for both users [...] referred to as CF-CF region [...] , and cooperation is based on DF strategy for one destination and CF for the other [...] referred to as DF-CF region [...] .

30|$|The {{heterogeneous}} {{deployment of}} high-power macro cells and low-power nodes (LPNs) is now widely acknowledged {{as an essential}} requirement towards meeting the continued demand for mobile data capacity. The selection of the optimum backhaul solution for the LPNs obliges operators to consider not only {{the capacity of the}} backhaul but also other key factors so as to fully leverage the benefits provided by LPNs: the cost of the backhauling may limit the density of LPN deployments and the backhaul configuration requirements impact on the flexibility of LPN deployment. To that end, self-backhauling of LPNs via the existing macro radio access network (RAN) provides an attractive solution, particularly for deployment scenarios that are very cost-sensitive and/or require high flexibility. However, use of self-backhauling usually makes backhaul as a bottleneck due to the a) limited bandwidth allocated for legacy macro RAN, b) the need to share resources with macro user equipment (UE), and c) the high-intercell interference particularly in the macro cell edge. In this paper, we provide an overview of self-backhauled LPNs and investigate possible performance enhancements through the use of coordinated multi-point (CoMP) transmission to relax the downlink backhaul capacity bottleneck for self-backhauled LPNs. To that end, we carry out analytical studies for a practical limited-feedback CoMP technique and numerically verify the <b>derived</b> <b>capacity</b> outage expressions. Furthermore, we implement a simulation study for an exemplary heterogeneous network deployment in a realistic radio propagation environment. The results of the studies demonstrate that significant spectral efficiency and throughput gains for the LPN backhaul are achievable through the use of selected CoMP technique under realizable feedback overhead, even under feedback bit error. The achieved relaxation in the backhaul bottleneck is observed providing improved performance for the UEs served by the LPNs. Furthermore, more resources will be available for macro UEs leading to overall performance gains compared to the case without CoMP.|$|E

40|$|V. CONCLUSION We have {{considered}} the capacity of multiple-antenna systems in Rayleigh flat fading {{under the assumption that}} CSI is available {{at both ends of the}} system. First, we derived the capacity of such systems in the case when only the transmitter is equipped with multiple antennas. We showed that the capacity of this system is, in fact, the same as a receiver-only diversity system with maximal ratio combining. We also proposed a transmission diversity scheme (maximal gain transmission) that is mathematically equivalent to a receiver-only diversity system with selection combining and evaluated its capacity. Next, we <b>derived</b> <b>capacity</b> expressions for a general system with multiple antennas at both transmitter and receiver. We showed that the optimal power allocation is given by a matrix water-filling algorithm. We obtained an equation that determines the cutoff value for such systems, which can be evaluated via numerical root-finding, and a corresponding closed-form expression for the capacity with optimal power and rate adaptation. We evaluated this capacity for some representative situations and demonstrated similarities with the capacity of such systems when CSI is available only at the receiver end. In all these cases, the only step that required numerical techniques in determining the capacity is the evaluation of the cutoff value 0. In order to circumvent this problem, we also derived approximations to the cutoff value for all cases considered. Numerical results show that these approximations yield good capacity estimates when the SNR or the number of antennas is sufficiently large. From these capacity computations for multiple-antenna systems with adaptive transmission techniques we observe that large capacity gains are possible compared to the receiver-CSI-only systems. The tradeoff for these increased capacity values is the outage probability incurred by the adaptive power and rate allocation schemes. We derived simple upper bounds for this outage probability and showed that the channel outage probability may also be decreased by increasing the number of antennas...|$|E
