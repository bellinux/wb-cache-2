40|$|We {{present a}} case of {{reversible}} stress cardiomyopathy in a surgical patient, described here as <b>a</b> <b>forme</b> fruste due to its atypical features. It {{is important to recognize}} such unusual presentation of stress cardiomyopathy that mimics acute coronary syndrome. Stress cardiomyopathy commonly presents as acute coronary syndrome and is characterized by typical or atypical variants of regional wall motion abnormalities. We report a 60 -year-old Caucasian male with reversible stress cardiomyopathy following a sternal fracture fixation. Although the patient had several typical features of stress cardiomyopathy including physical stress, ST-segment elevation, elevated cardiac biomarkers and normal epicardial coronaries, there were few features that were atypical, including unusual age, gender, absence of regional wall motion abnormalities, high lateral ST elevation, and high troponin-ejection fraction product. In conclusion, this could represent <b>a</b> <b>forme</b> fruste of stress cardiomyopathy...|$|R

5000|$|A chase is a {{heavy steel}} frame used to hold type in a letterpress. Most of the space in the chase not {{occupied}} with type is filled with blocks of wood called furniture.

5000|$|The {{composition}} of individual cast metal types into lines with leading and furniture, tightly {{locked into a}} chase, was labor-intensive and costly. Cumulative, this full setup for printing a single page was called <b>a</b> <b>forme.</b> The printer would incur further expense through loss of the type for other uses while held in formes. However, once the flong and stereotype were created, the individual type, furniture, leading and chasing could be disassembled, and used for another project.|$|R

As an autosomal dominant trait there is a fifty percent chance with each child that they will also be born with the syndrome.
