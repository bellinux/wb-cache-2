In this article, the sizes of the volumes sampled by nanoindentation <b>tests</b> <b>for</b> <b>hardness</b> and modulus {{measurements}} are studied using finite element simulations. The zones of influence <b>for</b> <b>hardness</b> and modulus in single-phase systems are determined by modeling a hemispherical particle in a matrix, with properties close to those of each other, and monitoring the deviation of the measured values {{from those of the}} particle. It is found that, <b>for</b> <b>hardness</b> <b>testing</b> of elastic-perfectly plastic materials, the intrinsic hardness of the particle is measured as long as the plastic region is still within the particle, i. e., the contact radius is one half or less of the particle radius. Thus, in a <b>hardness</b> <b>test</b> of a single-phase material, all of the plastically deforming material, and only the plastically deforming material, contributes to the hardness measured.

40|$|AbstractThe plane-strain, elasto-plastic, contact problem {{described}} in the title is treated for a substrate that is perfectly plastic post yield, and so simulates compression molding of some metals at elevated temperatures. The analysis uses finite elements and is verified with test problems and convergence checks. The key finding is that, in what might reasonably {{be viewed as a}} fully-plastic state, the molding pressure normalized by the yield stress is equal to a constant plus a term that increases linearly with the depth of indentation. This is in contrast to Tabor’s classical result <b>for</b> <b>hardness</b> <b>testing</b> that has the normalized pressure solely equal to a constant when response is fully plastic. The additional linear stiffening term found with the finite element analysis of the present configuration is confirmed experimentally. An explanation of the source of this stiffening term even with a perfectly-plastic substrate is offered. Contact stresses are also tracked as indentation proceeds. These stresses initially have high stress concentrations near the edges of the strip punches. However, these peak stresses abate rapidly with plastic flow and approach a nearly uniform distribution within the fully-plastic state. Implications for compression molding are discussed...|$|R
