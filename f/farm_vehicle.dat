25|$|A tractor is a {{distinctive}} <b>farm</b> <b>vehicle</b> {{specifically designed to}} deliver a high tractive effort at slow speeds, {{for the purposes of}} hauling a trailer or machinery used in agriculture or construction. Agricultural implements may be towed behind or mounted on the tractor, and the tractor may also provide a source of power if the implement is mechanized. While steam powered tractors had been built earlier, In 1892, John Froelich invented and built the first gasoline-powered tractor in Clayton County, Iowa.|$|E
25|$|Current driverless tractor {{technologies}} {{build on}} {{recent developments in}} unmanned vehicles and agricultural technology. A tractor {{is defined as a}} powerful motor-driven vehicle with large, heavy treads, used for pulling farm machinery and other vehicles. Most commonly, the term is used to describe a <b>farm</b> <b>vehicle</b> that provides the power and traction to mechanize agricultural tasks. Precision agriculture was a major shift in technology that occurred in the 1980s. The result was tractors that farmers drove with the aid of GPS devices and on-board computers. Precision agriculture focuses on maximizing returns while using minimum resources. With the aid of GPS devices and computers, farmers could use tractors more efficiently.|$|E

40|$|The American Association of State Highway and Transportation Officials (AASHTO) {{specifications}} provide simplified formulae {{to determine}} Live Load Distribution Factors (LLDFs) for highway bridges. The formulae for the AASHTO code-specified LLDFs have been developed, considering {{the effect of}} typical highway trucks. In addition to highway bridges, there are {{a large number of}} bridges located on secondary roadways where <b>farm</b> <b>vehicles</b> having varying configurations and weights frequently travel. Unfortunately, LLDFs for the bridges loaded with <b>farm</b> <b>vehicles</b> are not well known. In this study, hence, two bridge types, including steel girder bridges with plank decking and timber girder bridges with plank decking, were selected to determine LLDFs of the bridges under the effects of <b>farm</b> <b>vehicles.</b> The procedure adopted include the AASHTO code-specified formulae, field testing, finite element modeling, and analytical simulations of all the bridges. Field testing of each bridge was conducted with four different <b>farm</b> <b>vehicles</b> and a five-axle highway truck used as a benchmark for exploring highway truck-induced LLDFs. Commercially available Finite Element Analysis (FEA) software was utilized to generate analytical models of all the bridges, and the models were calibrated with field data. To consider the effects of vastly different <b>farm</b> <b>vehicles,</b> information on 121 existing <b>farm</b> <b>vehicles</b> were collected and used as input loads in the models to compute analytical LLDFs for the bridges. The analytical LLDFs resulting from 121 <b>farm</b> <b>vehicles</b> were used to establish statistical limits representing deterministic values for LLDFs for each bridge. The field, analytical, and statistical LLDFs were compared to those obtained from the AASHTO specifications. Results showed that the AASHTO LLDFs were, in some cases, inadequate for the timber girder bridges, while those were, in most cases, adequate for the steel girder bridges...|$|R

50|$|Wide span {{vehicle is}} a special type of <b>farming</b> <b>vehicle</b> that is much wider than a typical vehicle. Wide span {{vehicles}} can measure up to 10 m wide or wider.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} the automatic steering control of <b>farming</b> <b>vehicle</b> using GPS receiver. Automatic steering devices for <b>farming</b> <b>vehicles</b> like tractors, seeding vehicle, weed control vehicle, spraying machine vehicle etc. have the task {{to relieve the}} driver from the physical and mental stress of monotonous steering work. Simultaneously, {{they are intended to}} help him to exploit machines and <b>farming</b> <b>vehicle</b> closer to their full performance and improve the quality of work. Vehicles frequently have to be steered in and exact straight line and along rows in the farm land. GPS receiver fetches the information of positions (latitude and longitude) of the farm land which needs to be cultivated. With the help of GPS and microcontroller (Arm 9) we calculate the boundary of farm land, slope of straight line and angle of movement with the help of slope changes. The microcontroller generates the control signals to stepper motor for steering of vehicle...|$|R

50|$|In 1983, the Farmer Series was introduced, {{mainly in}} 1:32 scale (Wagner 2002-2009).

Subsequently, more detailed and refined farm vehicles have been introduced in these two series. For example, Classic models featured tractors with rustic looking 'aged' paint (Wagner 2002-2007). Post 2005, some of these realistic plastic vehicles, like a MAN refuse truck, were twelve inches long or more and, typical for the era, made in China, not Germany.|$|E
