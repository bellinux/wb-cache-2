40|$|This paper {{deals with}} a {{methodology}} to assess {{the influence of the}} revolute <b>joint</b> <b>clearances</b> in planar mechanisms that are constituted by rigid links and joints. The existence of a radial clearance in a revolute joint removes the two kinematic constraints associated with the ideal revolute joint, and, hence, two extra degrees of freedom are introduced. Thus, the journal can move freely inside the bearing boundaries. When the journal reaches the bearing wall an impact takes place and contact forces control the dynamic of the joint. While an ideal revolute joint imposes kinematic constraints to the systems, a revolute <b>joint</b> with <b>clearance</b> deals with force constraints. These impacts and the eventual continuous contact are described here by a force model that accounts for the geometric and material characteristics of the journal and bearing. The energy dissipative effects are introduced in the joint through the contact force model developed during the contact. An illustrative example shows how the dynamics of mechanisms can be influenced by the existence of <b>joint</b> <b>clearances.</b> Fundação para a Ciência e a Tecnologia and partially financed by Fundo Comunitário Europeu FEDER under project POCTI/EME/ 2001 / 38281, entitled ‘Dynamic of Mechanical Systems with <b>joint</b> <b>Clearances</b> and Imperfections...|$|R

Over the last years, extensive {{work has been done}} to study the dynamic effect of the revolute <b>joints</b> with <b>clearance</b> in multibody systems, in contrast with the little work devoted to model translational <b>joints</b> with <b>clearance.</b> In a <b>joint</b> with translation <b>clearance</b> there are many possible ways to set the physical configuration between the slider and guide, namely: (1) no contact between the two elements, (2) one corner of the slider in contact with the guide surface, (3) two adjacent slider corners in contact with the guide surface, (4) two opposite slider corners in contact with the guide surfaces. The conditions for switching from one case to another depend on the system dynamics configuration. The proposed methodology takes into account these four different situations. The existence of a clearance in a translational joint removes two kinematic constraints from a planar system and introduces two extra degrees of freedom in the system. Thus, a translational <b>clearance</b> <b>joint</b> does not constrain any degree of freedom of the mechanical system but it imposes some restrictions on the slider motion inside the guide limits. When the slider reaches the guide surfaces an impact occurs and the dynamic response of the joint is controlled by contact-impact forces. These forces are evaluated here with continuous contact force law together with a dissipative friction force model. The contact-impact forces are introduced into the system’s equations of motion as external generalized forces. The proposed methodology is applied to a planar multibody mechanical system with a translational <b>clearance</b> <b>joint</b> in order to demonstrate its features.

30|$|In {{order to}} achieve {{real-time}} tracking and precise pointing on target satellites, dual-axis antenna pointing mechanisms have been widely applied in communication satellites and data relay satellites for satellite-ground and satellite-satellite communication and data transmission. Pointing accuracy of antenna pointing mechanisms {{plays an important role}} in dictating the efficiency of the satellite communication system. Since the pointing accuracy is affected by composite factors including <b>joint</b> <b>clearances,</b> thermal load, etc., achieving a high pointing accuracy is a challenging task especially in space.|$|R
