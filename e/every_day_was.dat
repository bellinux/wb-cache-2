25|$|Ruth's career {{mirrors the}} shift in {{dominance}} from pitching to hitting at this time. He started {{his career as a}} pitcher in 1914, and by 1916 was considered one of the dominant left-handed pitchers in the game. When Edward Barrow, managing the Red Sox, converted him to an outfielder, ballplayers and sportswriters were shocked. It was apparent, however, that Ruth's bat in the lineup <b>every</b> <b>day</b> <b>was</b> far more valuable than Ruth's arm on the mound every fourth day. Ruth swatted 29 home runs in his last season in Boston. The next year, as a Yankee, he would hit 54 and in 1921 he hit 59. His 1927 mark of 60 home runs would last until 1961.|$|E

500|$|Sundials {{had been}} used for {{timekeeping}} since Ancient Egypt. Ancient dials were nodus-based with straight hour-lines that indicated unequal hours—also called temporary hours—that varied with the seasons. <b>Every</b> <b>day</b> <b>was</b> divided into 12equal segments regardless {{of the time of}} year; thus, hours were shorter in winter and longer in summer. The sundial was further developed by Muslim astronomers. The idea of using hours of equal length throughout the year was the innovation of Abu'l-Hasan Ibn al-Shatir in 1371, based on earlier developments in trigonometry by Muhammad ibn Jābir al-Harrānī al-Battānī (Albategni). Ibn al-Shatir was aware that [...] "using a gnomon that is parallel to the Earth's axis will produce sundials whose hour lines indicate equal hours on any day of the year". His sundial is the oldest polar-axis sundial still in existence. The concept appeared in Western sundials starting in 1446.|$|E
500|$|Jean became show runner of The Simpsons at {{the start}} of the third season (1991) {{together}} with Reiss. A show runner has the ultimate responsibility of all the processes that an episode goes through before completion, including the writing, the animation, the voice acting, and the music. When Jean began his tenure as show runner, the only thing he thought to himself <b>every</b> <b>day</b> <b>was</b> [...] "Don't blow it and screw up this thing everyone loves." [...] The first episode Jean and Reiss ran was [...] "Mr. Lisa Goes to Washington" [...] (aired September 19, 1991), and they felt a lot of pressure on them to make it good. They were so pressured that they did six to seven rewrites of the script in order to improve its humor. Jean said he [...] "kept thinking 'It's not good enough. It's not good enough.'" [...] Reiss added that [...] "we were definitely scared. We had never run anything before, and they dumped us on this." ...|$|E
500|$|On 13 April 1927 Cyril Tubbs died, {{after almost}} 40 years as surveyor, {{general manager and}} later a {{director}} of the LNC. Shortly afterwards, during meetings of the LNC's shareholders on 16 June and 14 July 1927, the words [...] "National Mausoleum" [...] were formally dropped from the LNC's name, the company being officially renamed the London Necropolis Company. On 28 December 1927 George Barratt, who had worked for the LNC for 63 years and been Superintendent of Brookwood Cemetery for 41 years, also died. Although the number of burials was gradually declining, it remained relatively steady. However, by this time mechanical hearses had begun to affect the numbers of people using the London Necropolis Railway. Trains still ran to the cemetery when there was demand, but the service which had previously operated almost <b>every</b> <b>day</b> <b>was</b> now generally only running around twice a week. By now the trees planted by the LNC in its early years of operations were mature, and Brookwood Cemetery was becoming a tourist attraction in its own right, often featuring in excursion guides of the 1920s and 1930s.|$|E

2500|$|In 1988 Scott {{took the}} band to Spiddal {{in the west}} of Ireland where {{they set up a}} {{recording}} studio in Spiddal House to finish recording their new album. Fisherman's Blues was released in October 1988 and showcased many guest musicians that had played with the band in Dublin and Spiddal. Critics and fans were split between those embracing the new influence of Irish and Scottish folk music and others disappointed after hoping for a continuation of the style of This Is the Sea. World Music: The Rough Guide notes that [...] "some cynics claim that Scotsman Mike Scott gave Irish music back to the Irish... his impact can't be underestimated", but Scott himself explains that it was the Irish tradition that influenced him; [...] "I was in love with Ireland. <b>Every</b> <b>day</b> <b>was</b> a new adventure, it was mythical... Being part of a brotherhood of musicians was a great thing in those days, with all the many musicians of all stripes we befriended in Ireland. I still have that connection to the Irish musicians and tap into it..." [...] Owing to the large number of tracks that were recorded in the three years between This Is the Sea and Fisherman's Blues, The Waterboys released a second album of songs from this period in 2001, titled Too Close to Heaven (or Fisherman's Blues, Part 2 in North America), and more material was released as bonus tracks for the 2006 reissue of the remastered Fisherman's Blues album.|$|E

Jay met Laura when he arrested Sarah for driving her car into a {{playground}} sandbox after drinking too much cough syrup and passing out. Jay is also a closet performer, in the genre of sentimental [...] "gentle comedy" [...] character sketches. Jay dislikes Sarah and calls her [...] "the cuckoo clown" [...] (in the episode [...] "Positively Negative"), but he is so devoted to Laura that he will go {{out of his way}} to help Sarah, even when she vows to kill him. Jay won a [...] "Humanitarian of the Year" [...] award for the work that he does reading to blind people. Growing up, he never celebrated his birthday because his mother told him that <b>every</b> <b>day</b> <b>was</b> his birthday. (She had only told him that to cover up her beer and cake addiction, which ended up killing her on Jay's actual birthday.) Jay also has a brown moustache, which is something Sarah frequently insults or at least mentions in most introductions to each episode. In [...] "Muffin' Man", Jay mentions that his partner, Officer Paul Tompkins, has been suspended for opening fire on a Hispanic youth who pulled a pellet gun on him, and that he had received a temporary new partner named Tig (Tig Notaro) who is a lesbian. Jay was also very attached to a turtle he owned, Toot. Toot was shot to death by Sarah (in the episode [...] "Pee"). It was revealed in season two that Jay had an uncle that was killed by an electric eel. He proposed to Laura on the second season finale.|$|E

2500|$|... “Political work” done by politruks and kommissars took {{much of the}} soldier's {{spare time}} as at least one hour <b>every</b> <b>day</b> <b>was</b> given to {{political}} indoctrination into Communism for soldiers who not engaged in combat. The term Nazi was never {{used to describe the}} enemy as the term was an acronym for National-Sozialistische Deutsche Arbeiterpartei (National Socialist German Workers' Party) as the politruks and kommissars found explaining why the enemy called themselves National Socialists to be too confusing for the frontoviks. The preferred terms for the enemy were fascists, Gitlerits [...] (Hitlerites-Russian has no H), Germanskii and nyemetzi (a derogatory Russian term for Germans). The commissars had the duty of monitoring the officers for any sign of disloyalty and a network of informers known as seksots within the ranks. In October 1942, the system of dual command, which dated back to the Russian Civil War, where the officers shared authority with the commissars, was abolished and henceforward only officers had the power of command. Many commissars after the Stalin's Decree 307 of 9 October 1942 were shocked to find how much they were hated by the officers and men. The commissars now become the politruks or deputy commanders for political affairs. The politruks no longer had the power of command, but still evaluated both officers and men for their political loyalty, carried out political indoctrination and had the power to order summary executions of anyone suspected of cowardice or treason. Such executions were known as devyat gram (nine grams- a reference to the weight of a bullet), pustit v rakhod (to expend someone) or vyshka (a shortened form of vysshaya mera nakazanija- extreme penalty). Despite these fearsome powers, many of the frontoviks were often openly contemptuous of the politruks if subjected to excessively long boring lectures on the finer points of Marxism–Leninism and officers tended to win conflicts with the poltitruks as military merit started to count more in the Great Patriotic War than did political zeal. Relations between the officers and men were usually good with junior officers in particular being seen as soratnik (comrade in arms) as they lived under the same conditions and faced the same dangers as the frontovik. Officers usually had only a high school education as very few had gone to university, and coming from the same social milieu as their men ensured that they could relate to them. The frontovik usually addressed their company commanders as Batya (father).|$|E
