5|$|Beef steak is graded for quality, {{with higher}} prices for higher quality. Generally, the higher the quality, the more tender the beef, the less time is needed for cooking, or the better the flavor. For example, beef fillet is the most tender and wagyu, such as Kobe beef from Japan, {{is known for its}} high quality and {{commands}} a high price. Steak can be cooked relatively quickly compared to other cuts of meat, particularly when cooked at very high temperatures, such as by broiling or <b>grilling.</b>|$|E
5|$|Charcoal {{is used as}} {{a drawing}} {{material}} in artwork, barbecue <b>grilling,</b> iron smelting, and in many other applications. Wood, coal and oil are used as fuel for production of energy and heating. Gem quality diamond is used in jewelry, and industrial diamonds are used in drilling, cutting and polishing tools for machining metals and stone. Plastics are made from fossil hydrocarbons, and carbon fiber, made by pyrolysis of synthetic polyester fibers is used to reinforce plastics to form advanced, lightweight composite materials.|$|E
5|$|Common {{onions are}} {{normally}} available in three colour varieties. Yellow or brown onions (called red in some European countries), are full-flavoured {{and are the}} onions of choice for everyday use. Yellow onions turn a rich, dark brown when caramelised and give French onion soup its sweet flavour. The red onion (called purple in some European countries) {{is a good choice}} for fresh use when its colour livens up the dish; it is also used in <b>grilling.</b> White onions are the traditional onions used in classic Mexican cuisine; they have a golden colour when cooked and a particularly sweet flavour when sautéed.|$|E
50|$|Another way {{in which}} pellet <b>grill</b> {{manufacturers}} have distinguished themselves from similar brands is by continuing to evolve and add technology. In a constantly wired world, it's no surprise that pellet <b>grills</b> would develop the WiFi compatibility available on Traeger Wood Fired <b>Grills,</b> Memphis Wood Fire <b>Grills,</b> and Boneless <b>Grills.</b> However, the technology isn't exclusive to premium models. Green Mountain <b>Grills</b> began offering each of their pellet <b>grills</b> with a WiFi-enabled control panel {{that allows you to}} monitor and control your cooks through a smartphone or tablet. This is not something offered from all manufacturers, Rec Tec <b>Grills</b> produce WiFi <b>grills</b> while Black Olive <b>Grills</b> has differentiated itself by applying pellet <b>grill</b> technology to a traditional ceramic Kamado <b>grill.</b> Uuni sells a pizza oven that integrates pellet <b>grill</b> technology. It's a trend that seems likely to continue as some manufacturers add new technology to pellet <b>grills</b> and others attempt to add pellet <b>grill</b> technology to traditional <b>grills.</b>|$|R
50|$|Commercial {{barbecue}} <b>grills</b> can be stationary or transportable. An {{example of}} a stationary <b>grill</b> is a built-in pit <b>grill,</b> for indoor or outdoor use. Construction materials include bricks, mortar, concrete, tile and cast iron. Most commercial barbecue <b>grills,</b> however, are mobile, allowing the operator to take the <b>grill</b> wherever the job is. Transportable commercial barbecue <b>grills</b> can be units with removable legs, <b>grills</b> that fold, and <b>grills</b> mounted entirely on trailers.|$|R

5|$|Two {{to three}} tablespoons of ReaLemon lemon juice has the {{equivalent}} of the juice from one average-sized lemon. Both ReaLemon and ReaLime are used as ingredients in various recipes, such as in baking, <b>grilling,</b> and as an ingredient in marinades and salad dressings. ReaLemon can be used as an ingredient in hot tea, lemonade and hot lemonade, and in various cooked dishes and baked goods such as pies. ReaLemon and other lemon juices can be used to prevent browning discoloration from occurring in peeled or sliced potatoes. This is performed by soaking the sliced potatoes in a mixture of the lemon juice and water. Both ReaLemon and ReaLime must be refrigerated after the bottles are opened.|$|E

50|$|Like most {{traditional}} smokers, early pellet <b>grills</b> {{were limited to}} indirect cooking methods such as smoking, roasting, and baking. However, thanks to improvements in construction and advancements in digital controllers, modern pellet <b>grills</b> can produce higher temperatures. Whereas early units struggled to reach 450 °F, some pellet <b>grills</b> can now easily achieve temperatures in excess of 550 °F. Louisiana <b>Grills,</b> Fast Eddy's by Cookshack, and Yoder Smokers YS Series have pellet <b>grills</b> with an upper limit of 600 °F. Some pellet <b>grills</b> can reach 600-700 °F, depending on the model. The ability to achieve high temperatures has enabled some manufacturers to design pellet <b>grills</b> that can handle both indirect and direct cooking. Brands such as Memphis Wood Fire <b>Grills,</b> Fast Eddy’s by Cookshack, Louisiana <b>Grills,</b> Yoder Smokers, and FireCraft make pellet <b>grills</b> that offer the option of open fire grilling.31 This is usually accomplished through a removable or adjustable plate that allows flames through {{a portion of the}} pellet <b>grill's</b> deflector plate.|$|R
50|$|The square {{charcoal}} <b>grill</b> is {{a hybrid}} of the brazier and the kettle <b>grill.</b> It has a shallow pan like the brazier and normally a simple method of adjusting the heat, if any. However, it has a lid like a kettle <b>grill</b> and basic adjustable vents. The square charcoal grille is, as expected, priced between the brazier and kettle <b>grill,</b> with the most basic models priced around {{the same as the}} most expensive braziers and the most expensive models competing with basic kettle <b>grills.</b> These <b>grills</b> are available at discount stores and have largely displaced most larger braziers. Square charcoal <b>grills</b> almost exclusively have four legs with two wheels on the back so the <b>grill</b> can be tilted back using the handles for the lid to roll the <b>grill.</b> More expensive examples have baskets and shelves mounted on the <b>grill.</b>|$|R
25|$|British usage, barbecuing {{refers to}} a fast cooking process done {{directly}} over high heat, while <b>grilling</b> refers to cooking under a source of direct, moderate-to-high heat—known in the United States as broiling. In American English usage, <b>grilling</b> {{refers to a}} fast process over high heat while barbecuing refers to a slow process using indirect heat or hot smoke, similar to some forms of roasting. In a typical U.S. home grill, food is cooked on a grate directly over hot charcoal, while in a U.S. barbecue the coals are dispersed to the sides or at a significant distance from the grate. Its South American versions are the southern Brazilian churrasco and the Argentine asado.|$|E

50|$|The {{simplest}} {{and most}} inexpensive of charcoal <b>grills,</b> the brazier <b>grill</b> {{is made of}} wire and sheet metal and composed of a cooking grid placed over a charcoal pan. Usually the <b>grill</b> is supported by legs attached to the charcoal pan. The brazier <b>grill</b> {{does not have a}} lid or venting system. Heat is adjusted by moving the cooking grid up or down over the charcoal pan. Even after George Stephen invented the kettle <b>grill</b> in the early 1950s, the brazier <b>grill</b> remained a dominant charcoal <b>grill</b> type for a number of years. Brazier <b>grills</b> are available at most discount department stores during the summer.|$|R

25|$|Many beefsteak clubs of the 18th and 19th centuries {{have used}} the {{traditional}} <b>grilling</b> gridiron as their symbol and some are even named after it: the Gridiron Club of Oxford was founded in 1884, and the Gridiron Club of Washington D.C. was founded the following year. These two clubs also still exist.|$|E
50|$|A hybrid <b>grill</b> is a <b>grill</b> {{used for}} outdoor cooking with {{charcoal}} {{and natural gas}} or liquid propane and can cook {{in the same manner}} as a traditional outdoor gas <b>grill.</b> The manufacturers claim that it combines the convenience of an outdoor gas <b>grill</b> with the flavor and cooking techniques of a charcoal and wood <b>grill.</b>|$|R

5000|$|... "Pellet grills", {{sometimes}} referred to as pellet smokers, are backyard cookers that combine elements of charcoal smokers, gas <b>grills,</b> and kitchen ovens. Fueled by wood pellets, pellet <b>grills</b> infuse food with smoky flavor associated with charcoal <b>grills</b> and smokers, but offer the convenience of gas <b>grills</b> and the temperature control of an indoor oven. They have the ability to smoke as well as <b>grill</b> and bake using an electronic control panel to automatically feed fuel to the fire, regulate the <b>grill’s</b> airflow, and maintain consistent cooking temperatures. The best pellet <b>grills</b> also utilize sophisticated sensors and advanced algorithms for precision temperature control.|$|R
25|$|A {{gridiron}} is a metal grate with {{parallel bars}} typically used for <b>grilling</b> meat, fish, vegetables, or combinations of such foods. It {{may also be}} two such grids, hinged to fold together, to securely hold food while <b>grilling</b> over an open flame. Gridironing is often performed outdoors, using charcoal (real wood or preformed briquettes), wood, or propane gas. The earliest gridiron was a combination hinged gridiron and spider co-invented in 1836 by Amasa and George Sizer of Meriden, Connecticut. U.S. Patent #78 was issued to them jointly on November 14, 1836. The next advancement in the gridiron was a steel wire one was invented and patented in 1889 in New Haven, Connecticut, by William C. Perkins, of the New Haven Wire Goods Company, who received U.S. Patent #408,136 on July 30, 1889, for a hinged gridiron that would hold the meat in place while broiling.|$|E

25|$|In {{industrial}} countries, {{people who}} smoke tobacco products, {{or who are}} exposed to second-hand smoke, {{are among the most}} highly exposed groups; tobacco smoke contributes to 90% of indoor PAH levels in the homes of smokers. For the general population in developed countries, the diet is otherwise the dominant source of PAH exposure, particularly from smoking or <b>grilling</b> meat or consuming PAHs deposited on plant foods, especially broad-leafed vegetables, during growth. PAHs are typically at low concentrations in drinking water.|$|E

25|$|During the Bulgarian Uprising (1876) and the Russo-Turkish War (1877-78), the {{persecution}} of the Bulgarian Christian population was conducted by Turkish soldiers who massacred civilians, the principal places being Panagurishte, Perushtitza, Bratzigovo, and Batak (see Batak massacre). During the war, whole cities including the largest Bulgarian one (Stara Zagora) were destroyed and most of their inhabitants were massacred, the rest being expelled or enslaved. The atrocities included impaling and <b>grilling</b> people alive. Similar attacks were undertaken by Turkish troops against Serbian Christians during the Serbian-Turkish War (1876-1878).|$|E

Stedman continued to work as a janitor during the day and attended university lectures in the evening. He was ultimately admitted to the Illinois State Bar Association in 1891.|$|E
50|$|The {{portable}} charcoal <b>grill</b> normally {{falls into}} either the brazier or kettle <b>grill</b> category. Some are rectangular in shape. A portable charcoal <b>grill</b> is usually quite compact and has features {{that make it}} easier to transport, making it a popular <b>grill</b> for tailgating. Often the legs fold up and lock into place so the <b>grill</b> will fit into a car trunk more easily. Most portable charcoal <b>grills</b> have venting, legs, and lids, though some models do not have lids (making them, technically, braziers.) There are also <b>grills</b> designed without venting to prevent ash fallout for use in locations which ash may damage ground surfaces.
