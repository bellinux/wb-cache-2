40|$|Based on {{studies of}} the {{mammalian}} retina, a bioinspired model for mixed-signal array processing has been implemented on silicon. This model mimics {{the way in which}} images are processed at the front-end of natural visual pathways, by means of programmable complex spatio-temporal dynamic. When embedded into a focal-plane processing chip, such model allows for on-line parallel filtering of the cap-tured image; the outcome of such processing can be used to develop control <b>feed-back</b> <b>actions</b> to adapt the response of photoreceptors to local image features. Beyond simple resistive grid filtering, it is possible to program other spatio-temporal processing operators into the model core, such as nonlinear and anisotropic diffu-sion, among others. This paper presents analog and mixed-signal VLSI building blocks to implement this model, and illustrates their operation through experimental results taken from a prototype chip fabricated in a CMOS technology.

40|$|Abstract. The coupled Maxwell-Lorentz system {{describes}} <b>feed-back</b> <b>action</b> {{of electromagnetic}} fields in classical electrodynamics. When applied to point-charge sources (viewed as limiting cases of charged fluids) the resulting nonlinear weakly hyperbolic system lies {{beyond the scope}} of classical distribution theory. Using regularized derivatives in the framework of Colombeau algebras of generalized functions we analyze a two-dimensional analogue of the Maxwell-Lorentz system. After establishing existence and uniqueness of solutions in this setting we derive some results on distributional limits of solutions with δ-like initial values...|$|E
40|$|The {{hypothalamus}} in {{the lower}} part of the brain contains neurons that produce a small peptide, gonadotropin- releasing hormone (GnRH, LHRH), that regulates luteinizing hormone (LH) secretion by the anterior pituitary gland. Important functions of LH include induction of ovulation in preovulatory follicles during estrus and the luteinization of granulosa cells lining those collapsed follicles to form corpora lutea that produce progesterone during the luteal phase of the estrous cycle or during pregnancy. The production of progesterone by the corpus luteum conveys a negative <b>feed-back</b> <b>action</b> at the central nervous system (CNS) for further episodic secretion of GnRH and in turn, LH secretion. Gonadal removal (i. e., ovariectomy) allows a greater amount of LH secretion to occur during a prolonged period. The objectives of this study were to characterize the pattern of GnRH secretion in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) of the bovine third ventricle region of the hypothalamus, determine its correspondence with the tonic and surge release of LH in ovariectomized cows, and examine the dynamics of GnRH pulse release activity in response to known modulators of LH release (suckling, neuropeptide-Y [NPY]). In ovariectomized cows, both tonic release patterns and estradiol-induced surges of GnRH and LH were highly correlated. A 500 -microgram dose of NPY caused an immediate cessation of LH pulses and decreased plasma concentrations of LH for at least 4 hours. This corresponded with a decrease in both GnRH pulse amplitude and frequency. In anestrous cows, GnRH pulse frequency did not change before and 48 to 54 hours after weaning on day 18 postpartum, but GnRH concentration and amplitudes of GnRH pulses increased in association with weaning and heightened secretion of LH. It is clear that high-frequency, highamplitude pulses of LH are accompanied by similar patterns of GnRH in CSF of adult cattle. Yet strong inhibitors of LH pulsatility, putatively acting at the level of the central nervous system (i. e., suckling) or at both the central nervous system and pituitary (NPY) levels, produced periods of discordance between GnRH and LH pulses...|$|E
