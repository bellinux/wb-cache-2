40|$|While the {{cultivated}} {{olive tree}} (Olea europaea L.) {{is known to}} be sclerophyllous and effective at tolerating drought, little is known of its short-term water-use dynamics for most studies have been based on longer- term, water-balance in formation. We present here, for the first time, heat- pulse measurements of the sap flux measured not only within the semi-trunk of an olive tree, but also within a root excavated close to the stump. One tree in the olive grove near Seville in Spain had regularly received basin irrigation during the summer, whereas the other, growing on this deep silt loam, had been without water for over 3 months. Following a flood irrigation of 730 L to a <b>dyked</b> <b>area</b> around the tree, the regularly-irrigated olive maintained a transpiration rate of 1. 65 mm 3 mm- 2 d- 1 on a leaf area basis, for only 3 days following the irrigation. This rate was maintained for a total consumption of 110 L. It then begun again to limit its rate of water use with transpiration falling below that predicted for well-watered conditions by the Penman-Monteith equation. The flow of sap in the near- surface root dropped concomitantly. Meanwhile the unirrigated tree was using water at just 0. 78 mm d- 1. Yet following an irrigation of 870 L it only lifted its consumption to 1. 12 mm d- 1, on a leaf area basis. Neither did it recover its leaf water potential following this wetting because of an inability to refill cavitated vessels. These data again show olive to be a parsimonious and cautious consumer of soil water. Consejo Superior de Investigaciones Científicas. Peer Reviewe...|$|E
5000|$|The term groden (c.f. the English verb [...] "to grow") used in Lower Saxony, {{particularly}} {{in the eastern part}} of East Frisia and in the Oldenburg Land, refers to new areas of land washed up by the sea. Sediments are deposited by the sea on mud flats when the tides change. After reaching a certain height, the land is dyked. Dyked land becomes innengroden. As a result of draining the fertile soil compacts and, over time, can sink until it is below sea level. The rising sea level in front of the dyke and the sinking of the old, now drained, sea areas behind the dyke leads to further dykes being built at an ever-higher level to enclose the newly <b>dyked</b> <b>areas</b> of marsh. In this way a so-called [...] "polder staircase" [...] is formed.|$|R
5000|$|The rich {{farmland}} {{along the}} river were originally dyked by the Acadians, who knew it as the Rivière-aux-Canards, to claim highly productive farmland from the Bay of Fundy tidal meadows of the Minas Basin. Beginning in the late 1600s, Acadians built progressively larger dykes across the Rivière-aux-Canards beginning first with its upper reaches at Upper Dyke, then the Middle Dyke and finally with the Grand Dyke near Port Williams. A sluice with a one-way valve, known to the Acadians as the [...] "aboiteau", allowed the river to drain but shut out the incoming tide. After the Acadians were expelled in 1755, the New England Planters settled in the area, beginning in 1760. The Planters repaired the Acadian dykelands and gradually began to expand the <b>dyked</b> <b>areas.</b> The Planters carried out this work by forming [...] "marsh bodies" [...] which are elected associations of farmers owning dykeland fields who share the costs of building and maintaining dykes.|$|R

The brothers started {{the project in}} 1505 but {{in the years that}} followed the dykes they had laid could still not prevent the tides from flooding the land. After receiving money from George of Saxony and hiring the help of two nobles, misters Davelaer and Bontemantel, they accomplished the immense task of <b>dyking</b> the <b>area</b> properly. [...] "Het Bildt" [...] was diked by a 14-kilometer-long dike which was fashioned purely by hand, spade, boats, and mud. This work was accomplished by many workmen from three Dutch provinces: Zuid-Holland, Zeeland, and Friesland. The area was mathematically planned and consists of straight, parallel roads pointing from south to north or east to west.|$|R
40|$|Artículo de publicación ISIThe Tatun Volcanic Group (TVG), Northeastern Taiwan, is {{considered}} to be the extension of the Ryukyu arc, and belongs to the post-collisional collapse Okinawa Trough. Strong hydrothermal activity is concentrated along the Chinshan fault, and Da-you-keng (DYK) represents the main fumarolic area where the most primitive isotopic and chemical composition is observed. In this study, we present chemical and He, Ar, C and N isotopic compositions of fumaroles, bubbling gas and water from hot springs sampled in 2012 and 2013. High He- 3 /He- 4 ratios from DYK fumaroles(approximate to 6. 5 Ra) show a typical arc-like setting, whereas other sampling areas show a strong dependence of He- 3 /He- 4 and CH 4 /He- 3 ratios with the distance from the main active hydrothermal <b>area</b> (<b>DYK).</b> This could mean strong crustal contamination and thermal decomposition of organic matter from local sediments. Carbon isotope compositions of DYK range from - 6. 67 %. to - 5. 85 %., and indicate that carbon contribution comes mainly from pelagic carbonates from the slab (limestone, mantle and sediment contributions are 63 %, 19 % and 18 %, respectively). This is consistent with the negative delta N- 15 values (- 1. 4 +/- 0. 5 %.) observed for DYK, implying a strong nitrogen-mantle contribution, and an absence of contribution from nitrogen-pelagic carbonates. These results have important consequences related to the Ryukyu subducted slab. In fact, the Ryukyu margin presents little in off scraping the sedimentary cover to the subducting plate that does not permit any nitrogen contribution in magma from TVG.

40|$|Thesis (M. A. (Psychology)) [...] North-West University, Potchefstroom Campus, 2007 The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{determine}} the sources of stress, support systems, coping strategies and psychological well-being of adolescents in a rural area, and to use this information to develop a coping and life skills programme. While all families face stressor events and crises, some are more likely than others to experience a series of challenges that threaten their functioning. Rural families often face a greater variety of stressor events on a more continues basis than do families in metropolitan <b>areas</b> (<b>Dyk,</b> 2003). Rural families do not have as many resources and services available lo address their problems as do urban families (Deavers & Hoppe, 2001). Farm schools suffer from a variety of shortages. Many schools suffer from a pressing shortage of space and educational aids and in most cases there is only one teacher for every 50 learners (Van Kleist, 2002). Some of the learners have to walk more than 1 Okm to school everyday because of the lack of transport. Most schools lack proper sanitation and electricity. Recreational and cultural activities are curtailed through shortages of equipment and suitable locations. Education in life skills may contribute to the enhancement of life quality, The development of constructive coping strategies protects mental health and enhances bio psycho- social well-being in times of high stress. Previously it was assumed that each individual acquired these skills as part of growing up. Alas, the truth is that many people do not cope with life and never learned these skills. These skills should therefore be taught in a direct and systematic way, rather than being left to be learnt incidentally. The qualitative research design was based on a sample of 56 male and female adolescents between 1 2 and 16 years of age. The adolescents were from four farm schools situated in the Potchefstroom area. Sixteen learners were randomly selected for semi-structured interviews to obtain basic information for the pilot study. Approximately 37 learners took part in the programme. The learners attended Grades 4 - 7. The deve 1 opment of the programme was done in five phases. During phase one semi structured interviews were held with some of the learners. During phase two the interviews were evaluated thematically, The data was then organized into conceptual categories and was then analyzed. During phase three the programme was developed according to the themes derived from phase two. In phase four the programme was presented at the schools as a trial test. During phase five the programme underwent some changes according to the findings in phase four. The development of the programme went well, however presenting the programme was a more demanding task. Almost none of the participants could properly speak or understand Afrikaans or English. Master...|$|R
