Thirty years later the community child care movement of the 1970 s emphasised the need for parent involvement <b>in</b> <b>the</b> services provided for their children, via "Participation <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Lives</b> <b>of</b> Parents"...|$|R

5|$|He {{received}} {{the education of}} a young man of the privileged senatorial class, studying rhetoric and literature. In his biography <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Lives</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Twelve Caesars, Suetonius attests to Domitian's ability to quote the important poets and writers such as Homer or Virgil on appropriate occasions, and describes him as a learned and educated adolescent, with elegant conversation.

5|$|In the UK in 2005, Lawson {{started to}} host a daytime {{television}} chat show on ITV1 called Nigella, on which celebrity guests joined her in a studio kitchen. The first episode debuted with a disappointing 800,000 viewers. The show was met with a largely negative critical reaction, and after losing 40% of its viewers in the first week, the show was cancelled. She later commented to Radio Times that on her first show, she was almost too frightened {{to come out of}} her dressing room. Lawson added that having to pretend to be interested <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>lives</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> celebrities on her show became too much of an effort.|$|E
5|$|Inside No. 9 is an {{anthology}} series, with each episode featuring a new story, {{with a new}} setting and new characters. Episodes last around half an hour, with the self-contained story reaching a conclusion. The stories are linked only {{by the fact that}} each takes place in number 9, be that a mansion, a dressing room or a flat. Every episode stars at least one of Shearsmith or Pemberton, and normally both. Each episode is effectively a short play, and could easily be performed on stage. Most episodes take place in real-time, following half an hour <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>lives</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> characters.|$|E

5|$|The testimonies of explorers {{and colonial}} administrators {{demonstrate}} that Carabane {{has participated in}} rice cultivation, fishery, trade, and palm wine production for a long time. The rice cycle plays a central economic and religious role <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>lives</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> population. Palm oil and palm wine are very popular and traditional in the area. The fishery has long been dominated by artisan fishing, which supplies the daily needs of the island's population; however, broader economic possibilities have been exploited since the early 20th century. Although there have been attempts to cultivate a tourism industry on the island, the inhabitants {{have been reluctant to}} participate. Carabane was added to the list of historic sites and monuments of Senegal in 2003.|$|E
5|$|Construction {{begins in}} 1566, {{and five years}} later the bridge is completed, {{together}} with a caravanserai (or han). The bridge replaces the unreliable ferry transport that was once {{the only means of}} traversing the river and comes to represent an important link between the Bosnia Eyalet {{and the rest of the}} Ottoman Empire. The bridge is built by serfs, who intermittently stage strikes and sabotage the construction site in protest against the poor working conditions. The Ottomans respond harshly, impaling the one caught saboteur. The bridge is wider across the middle portion, known as the gate (or kapija), and this section becomes a popular meeting place. Every important moment <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>lives</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> local residents comes to revolve around the bridge, with Christian children crossing it to be baptized on the opposite bank, and children of all religions playing around it. As time progresses, legends develop around the history of the bridge. The locals tell of two Christian infants who were buried alive inside the bridge to placate the fairies (vile) that thwart its construction. They come to regard two holes on the side of the bridge as places where the infants' mothers would come to suckle them while they were entombed. About a century later, the Habsburg Monarchy reclaims much of Central Europe and the northern Balkans from the Ottomans, triggering a crisis within the empire. Due to lack of state funds, the caravanserai is abandoned and falls into disuse. The bridge, on the other hand, stands for centuries without maintenance because of how well it was constructed. The residents of Višegrad—Turks, Serbs, Sephardic Jews, and Roma—stand in solidarity with one another during the Drina's regular floods.|$|E

25|$|Even while Belton {{was still}} being completed, a large change was taking place in {{architecture}} with more classical genres of the continental Baroque being introduced.

25|$|It is {{traditional}} in productions of Peter Pan for Mr. Darling (the children's father) and Captain Hook {{to be played}} (or voiced) by the same actor.

It also brings a poignant juxtaposition between Mr. Darling's harmless bluster and Captain Hook's pompous vanity.|$|E
