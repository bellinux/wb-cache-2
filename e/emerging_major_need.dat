40|$|The United Nations (UN) {{has been}} a useful {{instrument}} for India not only in pur-suing its foreign policy goals effectively, {{but also for the}} progressive and peace-ful transformation of the global political system. The changing priorities of the country’s political leadership, the challenge of reconciling subjective interests with objective principles, the nuanced pursuit of non-alignment and sensitivity to the existing international system have historically worked as factors to create a mix of effects in India’s performance in the world body. In the intricate agenda of the new century, India’s participation highlights concerns on reinforcing the core strengths of the UN in managing non-traditional security threats, including transnational terrorism, mobilizing collective action in the era of globalization for minimizing the economic inequities, both within and between countries, and lastly revitalization of the UN structures including, in particular, the Security Council’s composition through comprehensive reforms by common agreement. As for future strategy, the hope of replaying its past leadership role may be a less appropriate and acceptable option than building pragmatic and issue-based partnerships with all relevant countries in multilateral negotiation settings. Keywords Non-alignment, internationalism, pragmatism, non-traditional threats to security, economic development, UN reforms At a time when the international community is lauding India as {{one of the fastest growing}} economies and has widely acknowledged India as a responsible nuclear power, the question arises as to whether and why an <b>emerging</b> <b>major</b> power would <b>need</b> international organizations such as the United Nations (UN), whose main task is to regulate and legitimize the exercise of power.

40|$|Internationalization of {{research}} and development has accelerated significantly in the 1990 s and 2000 s. Much of this activity continues to take place among major industrial economies. Developing countries are, however, also playing increasingly important roles. India and China are rapidly <b>emerging</b> as <b>major</b> powers in this century, both in terms of the size of their markets and {{in a wide range of}} science and technology developments. This study provides a strategic review of economic and R&D developments in India.

The study also discusses scenarios for India’s emergence as a major economic and R&D power and subsequent local and global consequences. The work asserts that current weaknesses in data and a lack of substantive examination of corporate developments in India highlights a <b>major</b> <b>need</b> for further and more in-depth analysis of Indian-related science and technology development.
