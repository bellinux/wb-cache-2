In processes such as the dehydrogenation of isopropyl alcohol, it is a far more effective catalyst than either rhenium or palladium.

5|$|An {{important}} {{function of the}} dam is to control flooding, which <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>major</b> <b>problem</b> for the seasonal river of the Yangtze. Millions of people live downstream of the dam, with many large, important cities like Wuhan, Nanjing, and Shanghai situated adjacent to the river. Plenty of farm land and China's most important industrial area are built beside the river.|$|E
5|$|The {{western and}} {{southern}} sides, which {{lie in the}} rain shadow of the central highlands, are home to dry deciduous forests, spiny forests, and deserts and xeric shrublands. Due to their lower population densities, Madagascar's dry deciduous forests have been better preserved than the eastern rain forests or the original woodlands of the central plateau. The western coast features many protected harbors, but silting <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>major</b> <b>problem</b> caused by sediment from {{the high levels of}} inland erosion carried by rivers crossing the broad western plains.|$|E

5|$|Logging, {{along with}} {{cultivation}} practices has devastated tree cover, causing severe environmental degradation in the country. Over 80percent of Sarawak's rainforest has been cleared. Floods in East Malaysia have been worsened {{by the loss}} of trees, and over 60percent of the Peninsular's forest have been cleared. With current rates of deforestation, the forests are predicted to be extinct by 2020. Deforestation <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>major</b> <b>problem</b> for animals, fungi and plants, as the forest is cut to make room for plantations. Most remaining forest is found inside national parks. Habitat destruction has proved a threat for marine life. Illegal fishing is another major threat, with fishing methods such as dynamite fishing and poisoning depleting marine ecosystems. Leatherback turtle numbers have dropped 98percent since the 1950s. Hunting has also been an issue for some animals, with overconsumption and the use of animal parts for profit endangering many animals, from marine life to tigers. Marine life is also detrimentally affected by uncontrolled tourism.|$|E

25|$|WHO's anti-malaria {{campaign}} of the 1950s and 1960s {{relied heavily on}} DDT {{and the results were}} promising, though temporary in developing countries. Experts tie malarial resurgence to multiple factors, including poor leadership, management and funding of malaria control programs; poverty; civil unrest; and increased irrigation. The evolution of resistance to first-generation drugs (e.g. chloroquine) and to insecticides exacerbated the situation. Resistance was largely fueled by unrestricted agricultural use. Resistance and the harm both to humans and the environment led many governments to curtail DDT use in vector control and agriculture. In 2006 WHO reversed a longstanding policy against DDT by recommending that it be used as an indoor pesticide in regions where malaria <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>major</b> <b>problem.</b>|$|E
