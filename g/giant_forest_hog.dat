5000|$|While hunting, the Bambuti {{have been}} known to {{specifically}} target the <b>giant</b> <b>forest</b> <b>hog.</b> The meat obtained from the <b>giant</b> <b>forest</b> <b>hog</b> (as is the meat from rats) is often considered kweri, a bad animal which may cause illness to those who eat it, but is often valuable as a trade good between the Bambuti and agriculturalist Bantu groups. There is some lore that is thought to have identified giant forest hogs as kweri due to their nocturnal habits and penchant for disruption of the few agricultural advances the Bambuti have made. This lore can be tied to Bambuti mythology, where the <b>giant</b> <b>forest</b> <b>hog</b> is thought to be a physical manifestation of Negoogunogumbar. Further, there are unconfirmed reports of giant forest hogs eating Bambuti infants from their cribs in the night. Other food sources yielded by the forest are non-kweri animals for meat consumption, root plants, palm trees, and bananas; and in some seasons, wild honey. Yams, legumes, beans, peanuts, hibiscus, amaranth, and gourds are consumed. The Bambuti use large nets, traps, and bows and arrows to hunt game. Women and children sometimes assist in the hunt by driving the prey into the nets. Both sexes gather and forage. Each band has its own hunting ground, although boundaries are hard to maintain. The Mbuti call the forest [...] "mother" [...] and [...] "father" [...] as the mood seizes them, because, like their parents, the forest gives them food, shelter and clothing, which are readily made from abundant forest materials.|$|E
50|$|Within {{the forest}} bloc, swampy forest clearings provide {{abundant}} digestible forage for herbivores such as gorillas, buffalo, sitatunga and <b>giant</b> <b>forest</b> <b>hog.</b> In addition, {{some of these}} clearings have salt-rich soils, which attracts elephants {{as well as other}} mammals. These clearings are probably maintained by the action of the larger herbivores, and provide the rare opportunity of observing forest species which are normally extremely difficult to see.|$|E

They are mainly found in forest-grassland mosaics, but {{can also be seen}} in wooded savanna and subalpine habitats at altitudes up to 3800 m. They are unable to cope with low humidity or prolonged exposure to the sun, resulting in them being absent from arid regions and habitats devoid of dense cover.|$|R

50|$|As all suids of Sub-Saharan Africa, the <b>giant</b> <b>forest</b> <b>hog</b> has {{not been}} domesticated, but it is easily tamed and has been {{considered}} to have potential for domestication. In the wild, though, the <b>giant</b> <b>forest</b> <b>hog</b> is more feared than the red river hog and the bush pig (the {{two members of the}} genus Potamochoerus), as males sometimes attack without warning, possibly to protect their sounder. It has also been known to drive spotted hyenas away from carcasses and fights among males resulting in the death of one of the participants are not that uncommon. Despite its size and potential for aggressive behaviour, they have been known to fall prey to leopards (probably almost exclusively large male forest leopards which are often larger than their savannah-dwelling equivalents) and clans of spotted hyenas. Although in some localities the lion may also be a predator of giant forest hogs, the species are usually segregated by habitat, as African lions do not generally occur in the densely forested habitats inhabited by this suid.|$|E

40|$|WOS: 000074313900004 International audienceAfter {{having been}} located on maps, 36 forest clearings were {{explored}} {{and the presence}} of large mammals was recorded in the Northern area of the Pare National d'Odzala, Congo. 13 species of large mammals were observed. Elephants, buffaloes, gorillas, sitatungas, bongos, <b>forest</b> <b>hogs,</b> and <b>giant</b> <b>forest</b> <b>hogs</b> were the most common visitors. At the Maya Nord clearing, the rates of presence of buffaloes, elephants and gorillas were particularly high (71 %, 37 % and 34 % of the observation time respectively) while a group of sitatungas was resident. Differences in the rates of clearing frequentation was found to result from several factors including the past hunting pressure on elephants. Forest clearings constitute an important food source for large mammals which enter clearings for mineral salts contained in soil, water and herbaceous vegetation. They are of great value to maintain the population densities of mammals as well as to develop ecotourism. However, they are also ideal sites for ivory poaching. The richest clearings we explored are not included within the limits of the park: extending these boundaries is a priority...|$|R

50|$|The <b>giant</b> <b>forest</b> <b>hog</b> (Hylochoerus meinertzhageni), {{the only}} member of its genus, is native to wooded {{habitats}} in Africa and generally is considered the largest wild member of the pig family, Suidae; a few subspecies of the wild boar can reach an even larger size. Despite its large size and relatively wide distribution, it was first described only in 1904. The specific name honours Richard Meinertzhagen, who shot the type specimen in Kenya and had it shipped to the Natural History Museum in England.|$|E
50|$|The <b>giant</b> <b>forest</b> <b>hog</b> is, on average, {{the largest}} living species of suid. Adults can measure from 1.3 to 2.1 m in head-and-body length, with an {{additional}} tail length of 25 to 45 cm. Adults stand 0.75 to 1.1 m in height at the shoulder, and can weigh from 100 to 275 kg. Females are smaller than males. Females weigh a median of approximately 167 kg, as opposed to males, which weigh a median of 210 kg. The eastern nominate subspecies is slightly larger than H. m. rimator of Central Africa and noticeably larger than H. m. ivoriensis of West Africa, with the latter sometimes being scarcely larger than related species such as the bushpig with a top recorded weight of around 150 kg. The <b>giant</b> <b>forest</b> <b>hog</b> has extensive hairs on its body, though these tend to become less pronounced as the animal ages. It is mostly black in colour on the surface, though hairs nearest {{the skin of the}} animal are a deep orange colour. Its ears are large and pointy, and the tusks are proportionally smaller than those of the warthogs, but bigger than those of the bushpig. Nevertheless, the tusks of a male may reach a length of 35.9 cm.|$|E
40|$|SUMMARY. -A minimal {{incidence}} rate of 2 - 5 % of rumenal cancer of cattle in the Nasampolai valley of Kenya Masailand has been established. Carcinoma of the oesophagus and oesophageal {{region of the}} stomach in two free-living <b>giant</b> <b>forest</b> <b>hogs</b> from the same area is reported. The high incidence of the bovine disease {{is thought to be}} associated with the abnormal forest grazing of the cattle. The possible aetiology of the disease is discussed. IN 1955, Plowright reported that the residents of a valley in the Sakutiek area of the Narok district of Kenya Masailand recognized that a number of their cattle died from a disease which they claimed to diagnose clinically 6 to 36 months before death or slaughter. The disease was sufficiently common to cause grave economic loss and the annual incidence was said to be as high as 10 % of the cattle population, causing some owners with grazing lands elsewhere to move their cattle from the valley. The character of the disease was established by finding squamous cell carcinoma of the rumen and oesophagus in three cases following field autopsies...|$|R
40|$|Background: African {{swine fever}} (ASF) causes severe {{socio-economic}} impacts {{due to high}} mortality and trade restrictions. Many risk factors of ASF have been identified at farm level. However, understanding the risk factors, especially wild suid hosts, determining ASF transmission at regional level remains limited. Methods: Based on ASF outbreak data in domestic pigs during 2006 - 2014, we here tested, separately for West and East Africa, which risk factors were linked to ASF presence at a regional level, using generalized linear mixed models. Results: Our results show that ASF infections in the preceding year was an important predictor for ASF presence in both West and East Africa. Both pig density and human density were positively associated with ASF presence in West Africa. In East Africa, ASF outbreaks in domestic pigs were also correlated with higher percentages of areas occupied by <b>giant</b> <b>forest</b> <b>hogs</b> and by high-tick-risk areas. Conclusions: Our results suggest that regional ASF risk in East Africa and in West Africa were associated with different sets of risk factors. Regional ASF risk in West Africa mainly followed the domestic cycle, whereas the sylvatic cycle may influence regional ASF risk in East Africa. With these findings, we contribute to the {{better understanding of the}} risk factors of ASF occurrence at regional scales that may aid the implementation of effective control measures. </p...|$|R
