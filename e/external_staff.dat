5|$|The characters' {{body and}} facial {{movements}} were recorded using motion capture: these included capturing static figures for dialogue segments, and full-body capture for action sequences. The motion actors provided {{the basis for}} their characters' appearance: the actors were chosen based on how well they fitted with the staff's vision for the characters. The motion actors' facial expressions were captured using a special head-mounted rig the team had previously developed for the 2012 tech demo. When the character designs were being created, Nozue needed to regularly consult professional hairstylists to ensure that their chosen hairstyles for characters would be feasible in real life. For characters who appeared in the game, the team tried to keep their facial features {{as close as possible to}} their in-game counterpart. As with other Japanese CGI films aiming for a realistic tone, the team relied on photogrammetry and an extensive 3D scanning process combined with motion capture. Character clothing was created in a similar way to real-life clothing, with a number of different design variations being tested using paper cutouts. Something that both in-house and <b>external</b> <b>staff</b> contended with was making character movements realistic without being symmetrical; the biggest example was Libertus's need to walk on crutches for much of the movie, shifting his weight balance and movement speed.|$|E
5|$|After {{completing}} work on Super Smash Bros. Brawl for the Wii, Masahiro Sakurai {{was taken}} out for a meal by Nintendo's then-CEO Satoru Iwata in July 2008. During their meal, Iwata asked Sakurai to develop a launch title for the Nintendo 3DS. The platform was still in early development at the time, with Sakurai being the first <b>external</b> <b>staff</b> member to learn of its existence. On his way home, Sakurai was faced with both ideas and problems: Sora Ltd., which had developed Super Smash Bros. Brawl, had been drastically reduced in size {{as most of the}} game's staff had been either from other Nintendo teams or outsourced. While he had the option to creating an easy-to-develop port for the system, Sakurai decided to create a game around the third-person shooter genre, which was unpopular in Japan yet seemed suited to the planned 3D effects of the 3DS. At this point, the project was still an original game. In later conversations with Iwata, Sakurai decided to use an existing Nintendo IP as the game's basis. This was inspired by feedback received from players of Super Smash Bros. Brawl that many members of its character roster had not been in an original game for some time. After a positive response from Iwata at the suggestion, Sakurai ran through the possible franchises and decided to use Kid Icarus due to its long absence from the gaming market and continued popularity in the West. He also decided upon him due to his involvement with the character through Super Smash Bros. Brawl. Once he had chosen a possible series, he conceived the basic sequence of five-minute aerial segments, ground-based combat and bosses at the end of chapters. After submitting his plan, Sakurai was given the go-ahead to develop the game. One of the other franchises under consideration by Sakurai for use in the game was Star Fox, but he felt that there were some restrictions in implementing the planned gameplay features within the Star Fox setting. Uprising was the first Kid Icarus game to be developed since the Western-exclusive 1991 Game Boy title , and the first to be planned for Japan since the original Kid Icarus in 1986.|$|E

It is evident from previous integrated marketing communications research that the role of external and internal staff is key in reaching the highest level of integrated marketing communication planning; it helps to coordinate and encompass all levels of the organisations (Laurie & Mortimer, 2011). With the synergistic coordination of all internal and <b>external</b> <b>staff,</b> the organisational branding is exuded through all possible forefronts, therefore reaching maximum impact.|$|E

40|$|The {{internal}} recruitment is perceived {{in some quarters}} as the most favourite source of staffing an organization in stable and developed companies. The system needs a strong support from other HR processes {{in order to enhance}} morale and promote productivity otherwise it could yield disappointed and unproductive employees in the organization. Such HR processes include effective succession planning and consistent performance management to ensure success of the internal staffing. Though internal staffing may not bring new skills, competencies and fresh blood into the organization but it could build a strong loyalty as the employees have a chance to change their positions after a period of time and are not pressed to look for opportunities in the external labour market. The external recruitment on the other hand, brings new people to the organization. It allows the organization to define the right requirements especially where the labour market is full of potential candidates and to select candidates that best suit the organization‚Äôs demands. There is no gain saying the fact that <b>external</b> <b>staffing</b> system with effective campaigning or advertisement could increase the popularity and enhance the image of the organization in the labour market, however, the system is expensive and takes a lot of energy from the HR functionaries in the course of handling job candidates in the selection process. In the light of {{the pros and cons of}} the two system of recruitment, this paper seeks to determine the cost benefit implications of internal vis-√†-vis external system by considering the issues involved from four perspectives: economic, socio-psychological, financial and political context. It concludes that the usage of either internal or <b>external</b> <b>staffing</b> system to fill vacant positions should be determined by availability of qualified candidates, size of the organization and the desire to maintain and promote organizational culture...|$|R

50|$|I Am Setsuna was {{developed}} by Tokyo RPG Factory, a studio created by Square Enix and staffed by <b>external</b> <b>staff</b> to produce role-playing video games (RPGs). The concept for I Am Setsuna was written in September 2014, with development beginning the following month. The alpha build was completed by August 2015. The concept originated from plans to re-create a game similar to classic RPGs from the genre's golden age. The staff {{was made up of}} developers who agreed with this vision. In keeping with this, the battle system was adopted from role-playing games like early Final Fantasy titles and other games like Chrono Trigger. The game's playtime was designed to be similar to SNES games of the 90s, going against the prevalent trend of added content with the scale and power of gaming technology. One of the difficult elements was balancing the game's difficulty so it could be enjoyed by both casual and hardcore gamers. The battle system was specifically based on the Active Time Battle system used in Chrono Trigger. According to Hashimoto, Chrono Trigger was used as inspiration due to its popularity, it being a favorite of the assembled development team, and {{the fact that there were}} few spiritual successors to it on the market.
