25|$|In 1924 Shunryu {{enrolled}} in a Soto preparatory school in Tokyo not far from Shogan-ji, where he lived on the school grounds <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>dorm.</b> From 1925 to 1926 Suzuki did Zen training with Dojun Kato in Shizuoka at Kenko-in. He continued his schooling during this period. Here Shunryu became head monk for a 100-day retreat, after which {{he was no longer}} merely considered a novice.

25|$|In {{his junior}} year, Superboy again feels {{helpless}} when he isn't present to stop {{an automobile accident}} involving Ducky, caused by his own drunk driving. Ducky is paralyzed for life and thereafter uses a wheelchair. Ducky's place <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>dorm</b> is taken by Billy Kramer, a Smallville boy whom Clark befriends and decides to trust with his secret. Much as Superman would later do for Jimmy Olsen, Superboy gives Billy a supersonic whistle that he can use to call Superboy for help when needed. While he is befriending Billy, Clark becomes romantically involved with a wheelchair-using student named Lori Lemaris. He eventually proposes to her, but Lori reveals she already learned his identity telepathically. She rejects his proposal {{because she is a}} mermaid from Atlantis.|$|E
25|$|The {{tradition}} was renewed in 2008, when {{several members of}} the graduating class stole the statue from its secure location on campus. Despite rumors that the statue was locked in the college's military bunker, one of the students had seen the statue returned to the basement of a college dormitory after the reunion festivities of 2007. In late April 2008, the students staged a fake poker game {{in the basement of the}} dormitory; while two kept a lookout at the building's entrances, a third picked the lock to the basement storage room, and a fourth student backed a getaway car up to the dorm's loading dock. The heist was completed in under 20 minutes, and the statue was promptly transported to Vassar College, where it was left <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>dorm</b> room of a student's girlfriend.|$|E
40|$|This project {{involved}} studying {{energy consumption}} <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>dorms.</b> A typical dorm room has two televisions, one refrigerator, two computers, and lighting. We {{found that many}} students already have good energy habits and that many devices <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>dorms</b> are Energy Star approved. Some of largest impacts {{that can be made}} would be installing building automation systems to control lighting so it is not constantly on and encouraging students to unplug devices not in use. ![URL]...|$|R

2500|$|Corps {{fish are}} not privileged {{to live in}} a [...] "room," [...] and their {{residence}} <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>dorm</b> is thus called a [...] "hole."

Furthermore, fish are instructed that they are not allowed to want, think, like, or feel, and are prohibited from taking [...] "shortcuts" [...] by using abbreviations (PT must be called [...] "physical training," [...] the Quad the [...] "Quadrangle," [...] etc.). Cadets who started in the same class year are known as [...] "fish buddies". Corps fish sit a mandatory [...] "Evening Study Time" [...] (EST) during the school week after evening chow. This allows a period of quiet uninterrupted study each night, and fish are periodically checked by their unit's Sergeant of the Day to ensure that they are indeed studying.|$|E

40|$|This thesis {{focuses on}} factors that {{influence}} human behavior and how these factors can be leveraged to improve sustainable practices at the University of Colorado at Boulder and larger policy initiatives beyond the university. After {{a brief review of}} resource waste <b>in</b> <b>the</b> United States, this thesis goes on to explore different elements that influence human behavior and how these elements may be used to support sustainable policy initiatives, ending with an empirical study that explores recycling behaviors at the University of Colorado at Boulder. Recycling behavior was observed <b>in</b> <b>dorms</b> at <b>the</b> University of Colorado at Boulder’s campus in response to impact-based messages. Results showed an overall non-significant relationship between messages and recycling behavior. Instead, there is indication that there are other factors that are influencing recycling behavior <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>dorms,</b> including seasonal factors. I conclude that further research into the factors influencing recycling behavior <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>dorms</b> should be explored in order for recycling initiatives at the University of Colorado at Boulder to be strengthened...|$|R
