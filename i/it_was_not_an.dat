As <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>an</b> FIA event, the car's illegality was not a factor. Nelson Piquet drove, coming fourth of the five cars competing.|$|E
5|$|Before these discoveries, {{a theory}} existed that a Midcontinental seaway {{separated}} {{what is now}} Texas and Oklahoma from more western lands during the Early Permian, isolating Dimetrodon to a small region of North America while a smaller sphenacodontid called Sphenacodon dominated the western area. While this seaway probably did exist, the discovery of fossils outside Texas and Oklahoma show that its extent was limited and that <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>an</b> effective barrier to the distribution of Dimetrodon.|$|E
5|$|Friedrich Schleiermacher, an {{influential}} nineteenth-century Reformed theologian, saw baptism {{as the way}} the church receives new members and taught that faith is a precondition for baptism.

Schleiermacher also saw baptism as primarily individual rather than initiating one into a covenant community, and rejected the idea that baptism should be connected with Old Testament circumcision.|$|E

5|$|In 1754, the Stadt Huys was {{the site}} of the Albany Congress; Benjamin Franklin of Pennsylvania {{presented}} the Albany Plan of Union there. This was the first formal proposal to unite the British American colonies. The Plan of Union's original intention was to unite the colonies in defense against aggressions of the French to the north; <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>an</b> attempt to become independent from the auspices of the British crown. Although it was never adopted by the British Parliament, it was an important precursor to the United States Constitution. A month prior to the meeting, Franklin published his Join, or Die political cartoon, an infamous graphical representation of the Plan of Union.|$|E
5|$|Since {{the very}} beginning, Danes have argued about the precise place of {{photography}} in society. In 1839, Crown Prince Frederik deposited Falbe's daguerreotypes with Ørsted, {{the secretary of}} the Royal Danish Academy of Sciences and Letters, despite the fact that Daguerre, the inventor, was an artist. In 1842, the artist Johan Frederik Møller was refused a grant from the Royal Danish Academy of Fine Arts for studying photography in France on the grounds that <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>an</b> art. Photographers came within neither the scope of the Academy of Sciences nor that of the Academy of Fine Arts but were regarded as manual workers.|$|E
5|$|The U.S. State Department, after {{closing the}} NTSB {{investigation}} {{on the grounds}} that <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>an</b> accident, pursued an ICAO investigation instead. Commentators such as Johnson point out that this action was illegal, and that in deferring the investigation to the ICAO, the Reagan administration effectively precluded any politically or militarily sensitive information from being subpoenaed that might have embarrassed the administration or contradicted its version of events. Unlike the NTSB, ICAO can subpoena neither persons nor documents and is dependent on the governments involved—in this incident, the United States, the Soviet Union, Japan, and South Korea—to supply evidence voluntarily.|$|E

5|$|Before May 2011, {{it was not}} {{possible}} to apply for prerogative orders and declarations in the same set of legal proceedings. In Chan Hiang Leng Colin, the appellants contended that a declaration might be obtained in proceedings taken under Order 53 of the Rules of Court. The Court of Appeal, following Re Application by Dow Jones (Asia) Inc. (1987), held that it had no power to grant a declaration under Order 53 because a declaration is not a form of prerogative order. If a declaration was sought, it had to be applied for by way of writ if there were substantial factual disputes between the parties, or, if not, by originating summons. In Yip Kok Seng v. Traditional Chinese Medicine Practitioners Board (2010), the High Court expressed the view that due to the lack of a unified regime in Singapore for applying for prerogative orders and declarations, <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>an</b> abuse of process for an applicant to seek redress for a public law right by way of a declaration instead of applying for a prerogative order.|$|E
5|$|By {{the time}} the emperor Lebna Dengel and the Portuguese had {{established}} diplomatic {{contact with each other}} in 1520, Prester John was the name by which Europeans knew the Emperor of Ethiopia. The Ethiopians, though, had never called their emperor that. When ambassadors from Emperor Zara Yaqob attended the Council of Florence in 1441, they were confused when council prelates insisted on referring to their monarch as Prester John. They tried to explain that nowhere in Zara Yaqob's list of regnal names did that title occur. However, their admonitions did little to stop Europeans from calling the King of Ethiopia Prester John. Some writers who used the title did understand <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>an</b> indigenous honorific; for instance Jordanus seems to use it simply because his readers would have been familiar with it, not because he thought it authentic.|$|E

The match was drawn after USEE had been behind on first innings. Although they saved the game, largely because Grace scored 57 in the second innings, <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>an</b> auspicious {{performance}} by a team that included W. G. and Fred Grace along with five players who had taken part in the inaugural Test series in Australia the previous year: Henry Charlwood, Harry Jupp, James Lillywhite, Billy Midwinter and James Southerton. From Rochdale, Grace travelled by train to London for his next fixture on Monday, 6 May and Tuesday, 7 May which was for MCC at Lord's against a team called the Colts of England. It was another odds match with 11 against 22 and another draw. Grace made scores of 15 and 9. His team included A. N. Hornby, Alfred Shaw and Fred Morley.|$|E
5|$|Nevertheless, <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>an</b> easy {{introduction}} to the front for the New Zealanders. On arriving in their sector, they found the defensive arrangements to be poor and immediately set about improving the trenches and wire emplacements. Although {{the bulk of the}} division's personnel manned secondary defences rearward of the front line to avoid the German artillery, the forward areas had to be constantly patrolled as a deterrent to an attack and to give the impression they were fully manned. The static nature of the war meant that the Divisional Mounted Troops, intended to be used as scouts, were redundant and, along with two Light Horse squadrons from the Australian infantry divisions, were soon transferred to a new formation designated 1st ANZAC Light Horse Regiment. In July, the New Zealand Division was transferred to the newly arrived II ANZAC Corps while I ANZAC moved south to the Somme.|$|E

5|$|The Theses {{are written}} as propositions to be argued {{in a formal}} {{academic}} disputation, {{though there is no}} evidence that such an event ever took place. In the heading of the Theses, Luther invited interested scholars from other cities to participate. Holding such a debate was a privilege Luther held as a doctor, and <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>an</b> unusual form of academic inquiry. Luther prepared twenty sets of theses for disputation at Wittenberg between 1516 and 1521. Andreas Karlstadt had written a set of such theses in April 1517, and these were more radical in theological terms than Luther's. He posted them on the door of All Saints' Church, as Luther was alleged to have done with the Ninety-five Theses. Karlstadt posted his theses at a time when the relics of the church were placed on display, and this may have been considered a provocative gesture. Similarly, Luther posted the Ninety-five Theses on the eve of All Saints' Day, the most important day of the year for the display of relics at All Saints' Church.|$|E
5|$|Their engagement, {{announced}} in May 1901, was unexpected {{by family and}} friends, as Peter had shown no prior interest in women, and members of society assumed he was homosexual. At the age of 19, on 9 August 1901, Olga married 33-year-old Peter. After the celebration the newlyweds left for the Oldenburg palace on the Field of Mars. Olga spent her wedding night alone in tears, while her husband left for a gambling club returning the next morning. Their marriage remained unconsummated, and Olga suspected that Peter was pushed into proposing by his ambitious mother. Biographer Patricia Phenix thought Olga may have accepted his proposal to gain independence from her own mother, the Dowager Empress, or avoid marriage into a foreign court. The couple initially lived with her in laws Alexander Petrovich and Eugénie Maximilianovna of Oldenburg. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>an</b> harmonious arrangement as Peter's parents, both well known for their philanthropic work, berated their only son for his laziness. Eugénie, {{a close friend of}} the Dowager Empress, showered her daughter-in-law with gifts including a ruby tiara that had been a present to Joséphine de Beauharnais from Napoleon, but Olga took a dislike towards her mother-in-law. A few weeks after the wedding, Olga and her husband traveled to Biarritz, France, from where they sailed to Sorrento, Italy, on a yacht loaned to them by King Edward VII of Great Britain.|$|E

Everyone in the crowd felt that we were never going to go back. It was like the last straw. It was time to reclaim something that had always been taken from us.... All kinds of people, all different reasons, but mostly it was total outrage, anger, sorrow, everything combined, and everything just kind of ran its course. It was the police who were doing most of the destruction. We were really trying to get back in and break free. And we felt that we had freedom at last, or freedom to at least show that we demanded freedom. We weren't going to be walking meekly in the night and letting them shove us around—it's like standing your ground {{for the first time and}} in a really strong way, and that's what caught the police by surprise. There was something in the air, freedom a long time overdue, and we're going to fight for it. It took different forms, but the bottom line was, we weren't going to go away. And we didn't.|$|E
