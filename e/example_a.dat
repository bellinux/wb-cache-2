5|$|In a real vector space, a {{non-empty}} setQ {{is defined}} to be convex if, for {{each pair of}} its points, every point on the line segment that joins them is a subset ofQ. For <b>example,</b> <b>a</b> solid disk is convex but a circle is not, {{because it does not}} contain a line segment joining its points; the non-convex set of three integers{0,1,2} is contained in the interval, which is convex. For <b>example,</b> <b>a</b> solid cube is convex; however, anything that is hollow or dented, for <b>example,</b> <b>a</b> crescent shape, is non-convex. The emptyset is convex, either by definition or vacuously, depending on the author.|$|E
