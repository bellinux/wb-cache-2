40|$|Although Latin {{displays}} many {{characteristics of}} nominative/accusative alignment, it also exhibits {{a number of}} properties that are typical of active/inactive linguistic systems. More specifically, the Latin verbal clause displays an active/inactive distinction, as it regularly marks, through the occurrence of dedicated morphological strategies, the presence of non-agentive as opposed to agentive contexts. This dissertation explores the syntactic motivations behind this opposition, addressing the crucial question {{about the relationship between}} syntax and morphology. The claim is made that verbal morphology in Latin is always syntactically motivated, since it directly reflects the difference between active and inactive structures. In particular, deponent verbs are shown not to be a case of syntax-morphology mismatch: these verbs exhibit inactive morphology because of their non-agentive properties. Moreover, it will be argued that syntax and semantics are closely related to each other within the syntactic computation. From this perspective, this thesis also provides an account of the development of a number of analytic constructions in Romance: perfective, possessive and deontic periphrases. Substantial attention is devoted to the diachronic study of the Romance auxiliation patterns occurring in these constructions and to their relationship with alignment and argument structure. The main claim is that the Romance outcomes of these periphrases are closely related to the active/inactive opposition characterizing the Latin system and to the alignment changes that characterized the passage from Latin to Romance. Therefore, these developments cannot be seen as isolated phenomena, but must be understood as the various manifestations of a systematic change affecting the whole linguistic system. Finally, the analysis and investigation of these diachronic facts confirms that syntactic reanalysis {{is one of the major}} forces at the basis of language change. This study will be of relevance to anyone interested in <b>diachronic</b> syntax, historical <b>linguistics,</b> classical philology and Italian dialectology...|$|R
40|$|Romance corpus {{linguistics}} {{and language}} change – {{an introduction to}} the present volume One of the main achievements of structuralism {{is said to be the}} distinction between <b>diachronic</b> and synchronic <b>linguistics</b> and the preference given to the synchronic perspective, thus shifting the interest of linguists from the description and explanation of instability in language towards an approach that views language as a rather stable system with in-built complex but balanced functionalities; a view that only the synchronic snapshot may catch. This approach has been further developed in subsequent schools of structuralist linguistics, namely in generative theories which have arrived at highly sophisticated formal representations of how language functions at a given point of time. These formalizations, although capable of further development and undergoing indeed constant revision and updating, are by themselves rather static when trying to model the processes which are going on when language is used. Such approaches to language in the structuralist tradition face a crucial dilemma: in order to be able to describe language as a système où tout se tient, they have to postulate a state of language devoid of its quite obvious inherent dynamics and tendencies of change. How should we conceive of the interrelation between the layers of a well-organized language system identified by the structuralist in the diachrony of a given language? How can axiomatic stability and empirical instability be reconciled? Some linguists try to resolve this dilemma identifying variation as the culprit leading to language change while others emphasize language acquisition and its different stages as reminiscence of former linguistic changes before reaching the comparatively stable system that the synchronicist is interested in. The problem faced by structuralism regarding language change may in part be attributed to the fundamental question of what counts as evidence in linguistic...|$|R
40|$|In {{the past}} few decades, the {{investigation}} of grammatical change using electronic corpora has made headway internationally. Although linguists previously believed that grammatical changes progress too slowly to observe, this method enables linguists to investigate even recent, or ongoing, changes. However, no comprehensive study of recent and ongoing grammatical changes in Afrikaans has appeared yet. Also, when comments about ongoing changes are made, it is usually based on anecdotal evidence, {{with a focus on}} English influence. In this study, the method of short-term <b>diachronic</b> comparable corpus <b>linguistics</b> is used to investigate grammatical changes in written Standard Afrikaans from 1911 to 2010. Four corpora were collected to this end, representing language use from 1911 - 1920, 1941 - 1950, 1971 - 1980 and 2001 - 2010. Additionally, quantitative grammaticography is used to take into account possible effects of prescriptive sources. Two research questions are adressed in this study: the first inquires into {{the nature and extent of}} grammatical changes in selected grammatical categories in written Standard Afrikaans from 1911 to 2010; the second wants to clarify the differences and similarities between internal and external language change, and in the light thereof establish to which extent external change, and specifically English influence, is relevant for grammatical changes in Standard Afrikaans during the past century. The theoretical framework within which language use and change is investigated in this study is cognitive linguistics, specifically emergent grammar and the exemplar model. Changes that become apparent from the data are described and explained in terms of processes of change and forces of change, and linked to the principles of cognitive linguistics. Three broad grammatical categories are investigated: temporal reference, pronouns and the genitive. Even though there is an extent of stability in each of the categories, there are also several bigger and smaller changes that give an overview of the nature of grammatical change in written Standard Afrikaans in the past century. These changes can be divided into different categories. The first type of change has to do with formalisation and colloquialisation – in broad strokes, there are signs of formalisation between the first two periods, during which the standard variety was being established, causing some features associated with formality to increase (e. g. passive constructions). However, at the end of the century there are signs of colloquialisation between the last two periods, where some formal features decrease (e. g. the formal second person pronoun u "you"), and some informal features increase (e. g. nou "now" as discourse marker). The second type of change is analogy, causing greater regularity and/or uniformity in a paradigm. For instance, obsolescent preterite forms (had "had", wis "knew") were replaced by regular forms (het/het gehad, het geweet). The last of the Dutch genitive was also replaced by the Afrikaans genitive with se "'s" and van "of". The third type of change is driven by speakers' desire to be expressive. Some of the pronouns specialise increasingly, meaning that they are used less and less for functions other than their main function, and other options are used less and less for that function. Examples of this is the third person pronoun dit "it", the shortened forms jul "you/your" and hul "they/their", and the indefinite pronouns almal "everybody", alles "everything" and elkeen "each one". A next type of change is actually a combination of different processes and forces: grammaticalisation. There are several instances of grammaticalisation: the use of gaan "go" for future reference, the use of dis "it's" rather than dit is "it is", the use of mens "human" rather than 'n mens "a human" as generic pronoun, the use of indefinite pronouns with enig- "any" like enigiets "anything", enigiemand "anybody", enigeen "anyone", and the use of the genitive particle se "'s". The last type of change is externally motivated change. Contrary to the view the Afrikaans literature in general promotes, there is only one instance of confirmed English influence in the data of this study: the increasing use of -self with reflexive pronouns, rather than the bare object form. However, there are instances of extra-linguistic influence, like standardisation that caused large scale variation reduction between the first and the second period, and the influence of feminism that can be seen in decreasing linguistic sexism, particularly with regard to generic pronouns. The conclusion in the end is that the process of internally motivated change and contact-induced change is not different – an innovation can originate from another language (overt transfer), or an internal innovation can be promoted through bi- or multilingualism (covert transfer); however, the same principles, processes and forces of change are at play, irrespective of how many languages are involved.

50|$|Sociohistorical {{linguistics}} is {{a relatively}} new field of linguistic research which represents a merger of two distinct sub-disciplines of linguistics; sociolinguistics and historical (or <b>diachronic)</b> <b>linguistics.</b> Researchers in this field use sociolinguistic methods to explain historical change. This approach is particularly useful when language-internal data alone is unable to account for some seemingly inexplicable developments. Instead of relying solely upon intra-linguistic evidence and data to explain language change, socio-historical linguists search for extra-linguistic causes of change. One of the seminal works in the field is Romaine (1982)'s Socio-Historical Linguistics. Other studies such as John McWhorter's work, The Missing Spanish Creoles, are more specific in this case examining the extra-linguistic reasons why there are no creoles with Spanish as a lexifier language (as opposed to English, French, Dutch, Portuguese, etc.). Not all linguists believe that sociolinguistic methods can be applied to historical situations. They argue that the sociolinguistic means at our disposal today (e.g. face-to-face interviews, recording of data, large and diverse sampling, etc.) are necessarily unavailable to sociolinguists working on historical developments. They therefore argue that it is exceedingly difficult to do socio-historical linguistics, and that the results will always be suspect due to lack of data and access to native speakers in real-world situations. For those who question the validity of socio-historical linguistics, it is a field of conjecture rather than solid conclusions. Those arguing for the validity of socio-historical linguistics reply that it is better to use what remaining textual evidence is available to begin to posit likely scenarios rather than leave some questions completely unanswered. Methods such as social network theory (cf. Lesley Milroy) that look at human interactions and their effects on the larger society are particularly well-suited to socio-historical research.|$|E

This is seen as a major divide between (<b>diachronic)</b> <b>linguistics</b> and exact sciences like physics or chemistry. Still, in the absence of 'Laplace's Demon', physics can only predict trajectories of ongoing motion, but not when and where change will occur in the future. In that sense, physics and linguistics are not really different. In <b>diachronic</b> <b>linguistics,</b> we cannot predict when and where a change will occur (the well-known 'actuation problem'), but we have a reasonably detailed idea on the trajectory of change during its 'propagation' phase, which is known to frequently follow a parametrically defined sigmoid curve. Of course, language is much more complex than particle physics (in the same sense that biology is more complex than organic chemistry), and this makes it notoriously difficult to keep track of all factors involved in change. We have no idea what English will develop into in the next millennia (much like {{we have no idea what}} the pigeon, rabbit or frog will evolve into in the future).
