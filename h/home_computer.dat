5|$|In 1983, in {{collaboration}} with numerous companies, Microsoft created a <b>home</b> <b>computer</b> system, MSX, which contained {{its own version of}} the DOS operating system, called MSX-DOS; this became relatively popular in Japan, Europe and South America. Later, the market saw a flood of IBM PC clones after Columbia Data Products successfully cloned the IBM BIOS, quickly followed by Eagle Computer and Compaq. The deal with IBM allowed Microsoft to have control of its own QDOS derivative, MS-DOS, and through aggressive marketing of the operating system to manufacturers of IBM-PC clones Microsoft rose from a small player to one of the major software vendors in the <b>home</b> <b>computer</b> industry. With the release of the Microsoft Mouse on May 2, 1983, Microsoft continued to expand its product line in other markets. This expansion included Microsoft Press, a book publishing division, on July 11 the same year, which debuted with two titles: Exploring the IBM PCjr <b>Home</b> <b>Computer</b> by Peter Norton, and The Apple Macintosh Book by Cary Lu.|$|E

5|$|Radio-Electronics had {{a smaller}} {{circulation}} than Popular Electronics but {{led the way}} with innovative construction projects between 1972 and 1975. John Simonton's first modular electronic music synthesizer was featured {{on the cover of}} the May 1973 issue. It sold for a fraction of commercial synthesizers and his PAiA Electronics produced them for decades. Don Lancaster's TV Typewriter in September 1973 and Jon Titus's Mark-8 computer in July 1974 were the catalyst of the <b>home</b> <b>computer</b> revolution.|$|E
50|$|Homebuilt {{computers}} {{are almost always}} used at <b>home,</b> like <b>home</b> <b>computers,</b> but <b>home</b> <b>computers</b> were traditionally purchased already assembled by the manufacturer. However, there were kits that were both <b>home</b> <b>computers</b> and homebuilt computers, like the Newbear 77-68, which the owner was expected to assemble and use {{in his or her}} home.|$|R
50|$|<b>Home</b> <b>computers</b> {{were usually}} not {{electronic}} kits; <b>home</b> <b>computers</b> were sold already manufactured in stylish metal or plastic enclosures. There were, however, commercial kits like the Sinclair ZX80 which were both <b>home</b> and home-built <b>computers</b> since the purchaser could assemble the unit from a kit.|$|R
50|$|This article covers various {{significant}} {{pieces of}} software {{available for the}} Atari 8-bit <b>home</b> <b>computers</b> (400/800, XL and XE series). Because the company marketed them as <b>home</b> <b>computers,</b> games dominated the 8-bit software library.|$|R

40|$|This report {{explores the}} causal {{relationship}} between computer ownership {{and high school}} graduation and other educational outcomes. Teenagers {{who have access to}} <b>home</b> <b>computers</b> are 6 to 8 percentage points more likely {{to graduate from high school}} than teenagers who do not have <b>home</b> <b>computers</b> after controlling for individual, parental, and family characteristics. Although computers are universal in the classroom, nearly twenty million children in the United States do not have <b>computers</b> in their <b>homes.</b> Surprisingly, only a few previous studies explore the role of <b>home</b> <b>computers</b> in the educational process. <b>Home</b> <b>computers</b> might be very useful for completing school assignments, but they might also represent a distraction for teenagers. This report uses several identification strategies and panel data from the two main U. S. datasets that include recent information on computer ownership among children ? the 2000 - 2003 CPS Computer and Internet Use Supplements (CIUS) matched to the CPS Basic Monthly Files and the National Longitudinal Survey of Youth 1997 ? to explore the causal relationship between computer ownership and high school graduation and other educational outcomes. Teenagers who have access to <b>home</b> <b>computers</b> are 6 to 8 percentage points more likely to graduate from high school than teenagers who do not have <b>home</b> <b>computers</b> after controlling for individual, parental, and family characteristics. The study generally finds evidence of positive relationships between <b>home</b> <b>computers</b> and educational outcomes using several identification strategies, including controlling for typically unobservable home environment and extracurricular activities in the NLSY 97, fixed effects models, instrumental variables, and including future computer ownership and falsification tests. <b>Home</b> <b>computers</b> may increase high school graduation by reducing non-productive activities, such as truancy and crime, among children in addition to making it easier to complete school assignments...|$|R
5|$|A {{game called}} Indiana Jones and the Fate of Atlantis was {{released}} {{around the same}} time for 8-bit <b>home</b> <b>computers</b> including the ZX Spectrum, Amstrad CPC, and Commodore 64 <b>home</b> <b>computers.</b> Due to machine limitations, this was an isometric perspective game in which the player fought Nazi guards.|$|R
50|$|Bubble Bus Software was a {{publisher}} of video game software for <b>home</b> <b>computers</b> in the mid-1980s, founded by Mark Meakins and based in Tonbridge, Kent.

5|$|Enterprising programmers {{were able}} to produce games for the ZX81 using nothing more than text {{characters}} and the machine's limited text semigraphics. Some ZX81 games achieved lasting fame, such as 3D Monster Maze, a tense first-person perspective game that involved the player escaping a labyrinth with a Tyrannosaurus rex in pursuit. Written in a combination of BASIC and machine code, its innovative design led it to be hailed as the first <b>home</b> <b>computer</b> 3D game and a landmark {{in the history of}} computer and video games.|$|E
5|$|In 1982, the {{brothers}} started Ashby Computers and Graphics in the Leicestershire town of Ashby-de-la-Zouch with Lathbury and Tim's girlfriend, Carole Ward, whom he later married in 1985. They {{worked out of}} a four-room row house next-door to {{the brothers}}' family corner store and ran on a shoestring budget for its first six months, in which they pooled their {{money to pay the}} bills. The company did not credit individuals on their releases, though they had individual roles in development: Chris and Lathbury programmed and Tim and Carole designed the graphics. Carole also served as the company's secretary. Ultimate Play the Game, as the company was publicly known, first licensed arcade cabinet conversion kits to companies before moving to the more profitable British <b>home</b> <b>computer</b> market.|$|E
5|$|Microsoft is an American public {{multinational}} corporation headquartered in Redmond, Washington, USA that develops, manufactures, licenses, and supports {{a wide range}} of products and services predominantly related to computing through its various product divisions. Established on April 4, 1975 to develop and sell BASIC interpreters for the Altair 8800, Microsoft rose to dominate the <b>home</b> <b>computer</b> operating system market with MS-DOS in the mid-1980s, followed by the Microsoft Windows line of operating systems. Microsoft would also come to dominate the office suite market with Microsoft Office. The company has diversified in recent years into the video game industry with the Xbox, the Xbox 360, and the Xbox One, as well as into the consumer electronics and digital services market with Zune, MSN and the Windows Phone OS.|$|E

5|$|Pertec {{was eager}} to {{increase}} sales to small businesses through the 26 Altair Computer stores across the United States. The marketing toward hobby/home user was curtailed. The November 1977 issue of the MITS newsletter, Computer Notes, was the last produced by the Albuquerque staff. There was one more issue produced by the Pertec staff in Chatsworth, California. The back cover of the leading <b>home</b> <b>computer</b> magazine, Byte, always carried a full page Altair advertisement. This ended with the September 1977 issue. Roberts and Yates stayed on and worked on special projects.|$|E
