40|$|Background: Conventional {{approaches}} {{of making a}} flexible circuit are generally complex, environment unfriendly, time and energy consuming, and thus expensive. Here, we describe {{for the first time}} the method of using high-performance GaIn 10 -based electrical ink, a significantly neglected room temperature liquid metal, as both electrical conductors and interconnects, for directly writing flexible electronics via a rather easy going and cost effective way. Methods: The new generation electric ink was made and its wettability with various materials was modified to be easily written on a group of either soft or rigid substrates such as epoxy resin board, glass, plastic, silica gel, paper, cotton, textiles, cloth and fiber etc. Conceptual experiments were performed to demonstrate and evaluate the capability of directly writing the electrical circuits via the invented metal <b>ink.</b> <b>Mechanisms</b> involved were interpreted through a series of fundamental measurements. Results: The electrical resistivity of the fluid like GaIn 10 -based material was measured as 34. 5 mV?cm at 297 K by four point probe method and increased with addition of the oxygen quantity, which indicates it as an excellent metal ink. The conductive line can be written with features that are approximately 10 mm thick. Several functional devices such as a light emitting diode (LED) array showing designed lighting patterns and electrical fan were made to work by directly writing the liquid metal on the specific flexible substrates. And satisfactory performances were obtained...|$|R
40|$|G 7 is {{a method}} {{originally}} developed for calibrating commercial offset press. Instead of controlling solid ink density (SID) and tone value increase (TVI), the G 7 method introduces gray balance control {{as the key to}} achieve consistent color reproduction. The gray patches are quantified by CIE L*a*b* values. Inks used in conventional offset printing and Indigo printing are different in ink/toner pigments and <b>ink</b> setting/drying <b>mechanism.</b> Based on gray balance, the G 7 method is believed to be valid for calibrating digital printing and other conventional printing processes. This study focused on the quality of color reproduction with the G 7 method, and compared to the quality of direct ICC profile method. The results showed that the G 7 method could be applied to toner-based printing process. The G 7 method could improve gray balance and color gamut...|$|R
40|$|The {{authors have}} {{recently}} provided evidence implicating the cytochrome P- 450 {{system in the}} generation of contractile tension of the ductus arteriosus. To confirm this possibility, carbon monoxide (CO/Oj ratio, 0. 27) and cytochrome P- 450 inhibitors [4 -phenylimidazole; i 4 -isocyario,i 5 -(meth-oxymethyIeneoxy) - 5 Z, 8 Z,HZ-eicosatrienoic acid; 9 -hydroxyellipticine; a-naphthoflavone) were tested on the isolated ductus arteriosus from mature fetal lambs equilibrated at low (4 - 26 mm Hg) or high (229 - 694 mm Hg) O, partial pressure (PoJ. Carbon monoxide completely relaxed intact vessel wall preparations and preparations consisting of only the muscle. Carbon monoxide relaxation was reversed by illumination with monochromatic light and the peak for the photoactivated contraction occurred at 450 nm. 4 -PhehylimidazoIe (100 and 1, 000 p. M) was also a relaxant agent, and its action was manifest at both low and high Po 3. Unlike 4 -phenylimidazole, the isonitrile compound (5 p. M) and 9 -hydroxyellipticine (10 and 100 (xM) were relaxant only at low Po, and were also less potent. At the same Po 2, a-naphthoflavone (10) barely reduced ductal tension. Treatment of the ductus with either a combination of superoxide dismutase (60 or 150 U/ml) and catalase (40 or 1, 000 U/ml) or mannitol alone (80 mM) failed to alter the steady-state tone at low Po 2 and the contractile response to O 2. Arachidonic acid was tested on tissues pretreated with the dual cyclooxygenase and lipoxygenase inhibitor, BW 755 C (10 (JLM), and produced a weak relaxation at a concentration of 1 JJLM or higher. 5, 6 -Epoxytrienoic acid relaxed the untreated tissue, and its action was abolished by indomethacin (2. 8 (iM). Other arachidonic acid epoxides produced either a marginal relaxation (14, 15 -epoxytrienoic acid) or had no effect at all (8, 9 - and 11, 12 -epoxytrienoic acids).

40|$|In {{order to}} facilely {{increase}} the color yield of ink-jet prints using reactive inks, one-bath pretreatment of cotton fabrics with pretreatment formulation containing sodium alginate, glycidyltrimethylammonium chloride (GTA), sodium hydroxide, and urea {{is designed for}} realizing sizing and cationization at the same time. The pretreatment conditions, including the concentrations of GTA and alkali, baking temperature, and time are optimized based on the result of thecolor yield on cationic cotton for magenta <b>ink.</b> The <b>mechanism</b> for color yield enhancement on GTA-modified fabrics is discussed and the stability of GTA in the print paste is investigated. Scanning electron microscopey, tear strength, and thermogravimetric analysis of the modified and unmodified cotton are studied and compared. Using the optimal pretreatment conditions, color yield on the cationic cotton for magenta, cyan, yellow, and black reactive inks are increased by 128. 7 %, 142. 5 %, 71. 0 %, and 38. 1 %, respectively, compared with the corresponding color yield on the uncationized cotton. Much less wastewater is produced using this one-bath pretreatment method. Colorfastness of the reactive dyes on the modified and unmodified cotton is compared and boundary clarity between different colors is evaluated by ink-jet printing of colorful patterns...|$|R
40|$|Klebsiella pneumoniae is {{a leading}} cause of both community-acquired and {{nosocomial}} gram-negative bacterial pneumonia. A significant clinical complication of Klebsiella pulmonary infections is peripheral blood dissemination, resulting in a systemic infection concurrent with the localized pulmonary infection. We report here on the critical importance of β 2 -microglobulin expression during murine K. pneumoniae bacteremia. β 2 -Microglobulin knockout mice displayed significantly increased mortality upon intravenous inoculation that correlated with increased bacterial burden in the blood, liver, and spleen. As β 2 -microglobulin knockout mice lack both CD 8 + T cells and invariant NK T cells, mouse models specifically deficient in either cell population were examined to see if this would account for the increased mortality noted in β 2 -microglobulin knockout mice. Surprisingly, neither CD 8 T-cell-deficient (TAP- 1 knockout; in vivo anti-CD 8 antibody treatment) nor invariant NK (iNK) T-cell-deficient (CD 1 d knockout, Jα 281 knockout) mice were more susceptible to K. pneumoniae bacteremia. Combined, these studies clearly indicate the importance of a β 2 -microglobulin-dependent but CD 8 T-cell- and <b>iNK</b> T-cell-independent <b>mechanism</b> critical for survival during K. pneumoniae bacteremia...|$|R
40|$|The Walker and Fetsko ink {{transfer}} {{equation is}} the most used ink transfer equation to predict the ink and paper behavior on the ink transfer step in the printing process. All previous {{studies have shown that}} this equation is mostly applicable in the three major printing processes, letterpress, lithography and gravure. A study by Schaeffer, Fisch and Zettlemoyer reported extensive measurements for several oil-base ink and paper combination over a range of proof-press printing conditions. Yuri Bery did a series of studies for modifying the Walker and Fetsko equation in gravure inks for Weyerhaeuser Company. All the studies showed that although generally the Walker and Fetsko ink transfer equation can be applied to all three major printing processes, there are always some modifications needed for different rheological characteristics and printing conditions. The trends for the lithographic process is toward Web Offset printing. The components of Web Offset ink is quite different from conventional sheetfed lithographic ink in the pigment and vehicle used. This paper is {{to find out if the}} Walker and Fetsko ink transfer equation can be also applied to the Web Offset ink. By investigating the effect of viscosity - one of the most important characteristics in rheology of ink - on the transfer parameters, the <b>ink</b> transfer <b>mechanism</b> model can be examined to see whether it is the same for oil base ink as for the heat-set Web Offset ink. The result of this experiment showed there is a significant different absorption behavior between coated paper and uncoated paper. This difference is effecting the applicability of the Walker and Fetsko ink transfer equation in this particular type of ink and paper combination...|$|R
40|$|The development, fabrication, and {{application}} of a magnetometer are described. The magnetometer has a miniature transducer and is capable of automatic scanning. The magnetometer described here is capable of detecting static magnetic fields as low as 1. 6 A/m and its transducer has an active area 0. 64 mm by 0. 76 mm. Thin and rugged, the transducer uses wire, 0. 05 mm in diameter, which is plated with a magnetic film, enabling measurement of transverse magnetic fields as close as 0. 08 mm from a surface. The magnetometer, which is simple to operate and has a fast response, uses an inexpensive clip-on milliammeter (commonly found in most laboratories) for driving and processing the electrical signals and readout. A specially designed transducer holding mechanism replaces the XY recorder <b>ink</b> pen; this <b>mechanism</b> provides the basis for an automatic scanning technique. The instrument {{has been applied to}} the measurements of magnetic fields arising from remanent magnetization in experimental plated-wire memory planes and regions of magnetic activity in geological rock specimens...|$|R
40|$|Oncogene-induced {{senescence}} is {{a stable}} proliferative arrest {{that serves as}} a tumor-suppressing defense mechanism. p 38 mito-gen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) has been implicated in oncogene-induced senescence and tumor suppression. However, the specific role of each of the four p 38 isoforms in oncogene-induced senescence is not fully understood. Here, we demonstrate that p 38 mediates oncogene-induced senescence through a p 53 - and p 16 <b>INK</b> 4 A-independent <b>mechanism.</b> Instead, evidence sug-gests a link between p 38 and the DNA damage pathways. Moreover, we have discovered a novel mechanism that enhances the expression of p 38 during senescence. In this mechanism, oncogenic ras induces the Raf- 1 –MEK–extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) pathway, which, in turn, activates the AP- 1 and Ets transcription factors that are bound to the p 38 promoter, leading to increased transcription of p 38. These findings indicate that induction of the prosenescent function of p 38 by onco-genic ras is achieved through 2 mechanisms, transcriptional activation by the Raf- 1 –MEK–ERK–AP- 1 /Ets pathway, which in-creases the cellular concentration of the p 38 protein, and posttranslational modification byMKK 3 / 6, which stimulates the en-zymatic activity of p 38. In addition, these studies identify the AP- 1 and Ets transcription factors as novel signaling components in the senescence-inducing pathway. Although aberrant activation of Ras is associated with humantumors, activated ras in early-passage primary human and rodent cells causes permanent growth arrest known as oncogene-induced senescence (OIS) (1 – 4). Like apoptosis, OIS is a tumor...|$|R
40|$|A {{study of}} the {{photonic}} flash sintering of a silver nanoparticle ink printed as the back electrode for organic solar cells is presented. A number of sintering settings with different intensities and pulse durations have been tested on both full-area and grid-based silver electrodes, using the complete emission spectrum of the flash lamps from UV-A to NIR. However, none of these settings was able to produce functional devices with performances {{comparable to those of}} reference cells prepared using thermally sintered <b>ink.</b> Different degradation <b>mechanisms</b> were detected in the devices with a flash-sintered back electrode. The P 3 HT:PCBM photoactive layer appears to be highly heat-sensitive and turned out to be severely damaged by the high temperatures generated in the silver layer during the sintering. In addition, UV-induced photochemical degradation of the functional materials was identified as another possible source of performance deterioration in the devices with grid-based electrodes. Reducing the light intensity does not provide a proper solution because in this case the Ag electrode is not sintered sufficiently. For both types of devices, with full-area and grid-based electrodes, these problems could be solved by excluding the short wavelength contribution from the flash light spectrum using a filter. Optimized sintering parameters allowed manufacture of OPV devices with performance equal to those of the reference devices. Photonic flash sintering of the top electrode in organic solar cells was demonstrated for the first time. It reveals the great potential of this sintering method for the future roll-to-roll manufacturing of organic solar cells from solution. cop. 2015 American Chemical Society...|$|R
40|$|Graphical gravure {{printing}} {{is a very}} reliable process to transfer smallest amounts of fluid droplets to a substrate. Nevertheless, enabling this printing technique to produce large-area, ultra-thin layers for applications such as {{organic light emitting diodes}} (OLEDs) is a challenging task. This application not only imposes strong requirements on the printing technology but also on large-area measurement methods. Characterizing the homogeneity of sub- 100 nm thin layers across the total printing area is one of the two central topics of the present investigation. Utilizing optical interference from the thin film samples I developed and evaluated a method which successfully determined the thickness of thin, organic semiconductor layers with an accuracy better than 5 nm. Sample sizes of up to 150 × 150 mm² could be characterized within seconds using two hardware setups. I enabled a microscope and a modified flatbed scanner to acquire conventional RGB-images of the thin film samples. These images were then compared to a corresponding physical model using MATLAB resulting in a laterally resolved thickness map. The method is predestinated for being part of an inline process control. In {{the second part of the}} thesis, I deduced a physical understanding of {{gravure printing}} to produce ultra-thin, homogeneous layers from low viscous ink solutions which are based on small molecules dissolved in toluene. To this purpose, I processed on two consecutively mounted 150 × 150 mm² ITO-coated glass substrates with varying process parameters, resulting in a total number of 128 different gravure printed fields, each 30 × 30 mm² in size. Applying the large-area characterization method developed in the first part, I measured the thicknesses of all sub- 100 nm printed layers (with a total area of ~ 1800 cm²). This thickness data was analyzed regarding several surface parameters, such as roughness, dominant lateral wavelength, skewness and kurtosis. These surface parameters were referred to the physical models of fluid and thin film dynamics with respect to the underlying process parameters. As a consequence, two distinct process windows for the gravure printing process to produce homogeneous, ultra-thin layers were identified. The process windows were defined by two types of <b>ink</b> transfer <b>mechanisms,</b> namely single cell transfer and film splitting transfer, as well as appropriate film leveling and drying times. The two process windows for producing homogeneous, ultra-thin layers using gravure printing have been reported in the literature and were demonstrated through the present experiments. By combining the two different topics, for the first time, these experimentally observed process windows were theoretically verified...|$|R
40|$|WB × C 57 BL/ 6) F 1 -W/Wv mice {{possess a}} genetic defect in multipotential hematopoietic stem cells; the mice are anemic and lack mast cells. The authors {{injected}} diluted India ink intravenously into W/WV mice and congenic normal +/+ mice and searched for genetically determined {{differences in the}} development of complications of the injection. In both W/WV and +/+ mice, intravenous ink resulted in thrombocytopenia and markedly prolonged bleeding times, as well as prolonged partial thromboplastin and prothrombin times and reduced fibrinogen concentrations. These effects were similar in W/WV and +/+ mice, although the reduction in platelet counts was greater in W/WV mice. In addition, the mortality associated with ink injection was significantly higher in W/WV mice than in congenic +/+ mice. Most W/WV mice which died first exhibited paralysis, and examination under the dissection microscope revealed that ink injection resulted in significantly more cerebral thromboemboli in W/WV mice than in +/+ controls. Bone marrow transplantation from +/+ mice corrected both the mast cell deficiency and the anemia of W/WV mice and protected the W/WV recipients from the adverse consequences of ink injection. By contrast, +/+ mice rendered as anemic as W/WV mice by breeding did not exhibit increased morbidity and mortality after ink injection. (WC × C 57 BL/ 6) F 1 -S 1 /S 1 d mice, which are anemic and lack mast cells because of a genetic defect different from that of W/WV mice, also exhibited increased morbidity and mortality after intravenous ink. Finally, mixture of ink with commercial heparin prior to intravenous injection markedly reduced the incidence of cerebral thromboembolism and death in W/WV mice. Taken together, these findings suggest that the increased morbidity and mortality exhibited by W/WV and S 1 /S 1 d mice that received injected ink might be related to their mast cell deficiency rather than to their anemia. But measurement of the histamine content of the blood and various tissues of WBB 6 F 1 -+/+ mice injected with ink, and examination of their tissues in 1 -μ sections, indicated that intravenous ink did not cause substantial mast cell degranulation. As a result, the possibility that mast cells protect +/+ mice from the adverse effects of intravenous <b>ink</b> by a <b>mechanism</b> other than degranulation and release of heparin, or that the differences in the response of W/WV or S 1 /S 1 d mice and their +/+ littermates are due to defects other than their lack of mast cells, cannot be excluded...|$|R
40|$|The offset {{printing}} process {{is complex and}} involves the meeting of two essentially complex materials, printing ink and paper, upon which the final product is formed. It can therefore be expected that a multitude of chemical and physical interactions and mechanisms {{take place at the}} ink-paper interface. Interactions between ink and paper are of interest to both the papermakers and ink producers, as they wish to achieve better quality in the final product. The objective of this work is to clarify the combined influence of paper coating structure, printing ink and fountain solution on ink setting and the problems related to ink setting. A further aim is to identify the <b>mechanisms</b> that influence <b>ink</b> setting problems, {{and to be able to}} counteract them by changing properties of the coating layer or by changing the properties of the ink. The work carried out for this thesis included use of many techniques ranging from standard paper and printability tests to advanced optical techniques for detection of ink filaments during ink levelling. Modern imaging methods were applied for assessment of ink filament remain sizes and distribution of ink components inside pigment coating layers. Gravimetric filtration method and assessment of print rub using Ink-Surface-Interaction-Tester (ISIT) were utilized to study the influence of ink properties on ink setting. The chemical interactions were observed with the help of modified thin layer chromatography and contact angle measurements using both conventional and high speed imaging. The results of the papers in this thesis link the press operational parameters to filament sizes and show the influence of these parameters to filament size distribution. The relative importance between the press operation parameters was shown to vary. The size distribution of filaments is important in predicting the ink setting behaviour, which was highlighted by the dynamic gloss and ink setting studies. Prediction of ink setting behaviour was also further improved by use of separate permeability factors for different ink types in connection to filtration equations. The roles of ink components were studied in connection to <b>ink</b> absorption and <b>mechanism</b> of print rub. Total solids content and ratio of linseed oil to mineral oil were found to determine the degree of print rub on coated papers. Wax addition improved print rub resistance, but would not decrease print rub as much as lowering the total solids content in the ink. Linseed oil was shown to absorb into pigment coating pores by mechanism of adsorption to pore walls, which highlights the need for sufficient pore surface area for improved chromatographic separation of ink components. These results should help press operators, suppliers of printing presses, papermakers and suppliers to papermakers, to better understand the material and operating conditions of the press as it relates to various print quality issues. Even though paper is in competition with electronic media, high quality printed products are still in demand. The results should provide useful information for this segment of the industry...|$|R
