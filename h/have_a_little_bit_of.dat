Black described his view that allowing drug use would remove {{the stigma of}} feeling [...] "naughty" [...] attached to users, making the activity mundane and less attractive. Black was the executive producer for a documentary about Randy Credico entitled Sixty Spins Around the Sun. It calls for the so-called Rockefeller drug laws to be repealed. Black said of it, [...] "They're populating our prisons with people, you know, first time drug offenders—single mothers that <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>bit</b> <b>of</b> coke end up going to prison for 20years or something.

And I said, 'Well, I need to <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>bit</b> <b>of</b> previous knowledge even if God is doing it.'

[...] Grey continued to discuss how the song was ultimately included on Loud, saying [...] "As soon as Rihanna and her team heard my demo, they were like, ‘Oh we want it for Rihanna’s album,’ so I had to make the decision if I was going to let them have it or not. But I did and so it was on Rihanna’s album, too." [...] The demo track by Grey is on her extended play The Buried Sessions of Skylar Grey, which was released on January 17, 2012.|$|E

[...] Production of the music video's 13-piece set were restricted to a one-month period and is produced by Foden art directors Richard Berg, Jeff Hall, and Martin Mervel. Foden describes the assignment as a [...] "military operation" [...] explaining, [...] "The idea was to give each of the art directors three sets: a complicated one, a not-so-complicated one, {{and one of the}} smaller, easier vignettes."

[...] CBS Soaps In Depth wrote: [...] "viewers definitely can expect Angelina to make her mark in Genoa City." [...] DeGarmo confessed that she never watched daytime soap operas because she was in school, but her family was [...] "super excited" [...] about seeing her on one. Because she never had experience working on soaps, she talked about how fast-paced it was, stating: [...] "I would equate this to guerrilla theater. It’s very fast. You do your presentation and you’re done. It keeps me on my toes. I have to give my best performance at that very moment." [...] She also discussed having crossed over in the genre: [...] "Sometimes being a ‘reality’ person can {{be a bit of a}} stigma. ‘The Young and the Restless’ was willing to take a chance on me.

I learned a lot of great things from the past — but I always asked myself, 'If I could have my own scent, what would it be?' I wasn't worried about deadlines.

500|$|Actress Jolene Blalock (T'Pol) {{criticized the}} early stories as boring and lacking {{intriguing}} content. She felt that early Enterprise scripts ignored basic tenets of Star Trek chronology, and offered [...] "revealing costumes instead of character development". UPN executives {{stated that the}} male-oriented episodes of Enterprise did not mesh with the viewership of its other top shows, such as Top Model and Veronica Mars. Brannon Braga suggested {{that the reason for}} the cancellation was viewer fatigue, noting that [...] "after 18 years and 624 hours of Star Trek, the audience began to <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>bit</b> <b>of</b> overkill." [...] Fans, meanwhile, criticized Berman and Braga for ignoring Star Trek canon and refusing to fix their shows. Michael Hinman, news coordinator for SyFy Portal, stated that in addition to the oversaturation of Star Trek, there [...] "also is an oversaturation of Braga and Berman. [...] They couldn't sit back and say, 'You know, we just can't keep this fresh.' No, it was more about their stupid egos, and their nonsensical 'Even if it's broke, don't fix it' attitude." [...] Braga defended the series, noting that The Next Generation faced little competition from other science fiction shows, while Enterprise had to contend with a plethora of shows such as Battlestar Galactica.|$|E
500|$|After {{reprisal}} from death, Davies felt {{further development}} {{was necessary for}} the character to continue {{as part of the}} drama; one of the first decisions the production team made was that [...] "we can't make this guy look like a sap any longer. He's got to be made aware of what's going on." [...] The events of the episode [...] "Meat", in which Rhys learns the real nature of Gwen's job, are seen by Davies as a [...] "rite of passage" [...] for the couple. Director Colin Teague highlights Rhys' [...] patience in relation to Gwen noting that [...] "he puts up with an awful lot from his wife to be". The second series also explores Rhys's insecurities and jealousies towards series protagonist Captain Jack Harkness, for whom a mutual sexual tension with Gwen was evident in the first series. Both Stephen James Walker and episode writer Catherine Tregenna felt that [...] "the triangle of relationships between Rhys, Gwen and Jack" [...] comprise [...] "the most interesting narrative territory explored in 'Meat'". Although actor Kai Owen feels that [...] "Rhys will always <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>bit</b> <b>of</b> a gripe about Jack", he concedes that [...] "he respects him and he'll like him for looking after Gwen". Walker comments favourably on the interaction between Jack and Rhys in [...] "Meat" [...] in both its antagonistic and comedic forms, citing the scene in the truck where Rhys questions Jack as particularly effective. The two function as unusual literary foils for one another, insofar as their relationships with Gwen are concerned. In her critical essay Gwen's Evil Stepmother: Concerning Gloves and Magic Slippers, Valerie Estelle Frankel compares Rhys to Jack, likening the former to a [...] "sweet, kind handsome prince" [...] and the latter to a [...] "compelling trickster." [...] Whilst Eve Myles feels that [...] "Jack highlights how ordinary Rhys is", she states that it is precisely this ordinariness which makes Rhys a benefit to Gwen's strength of character.|$|E
