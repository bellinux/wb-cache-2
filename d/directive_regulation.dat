40|$|With the {{entrance}} into {{force of the}} Treaty of Lisbon, at 1 st December 2009, the criminal law has passed from the exclusively national sphere of the Member States under the patronage of the European Union. According to the Treaty, the European Parliament and the Council now have the possibility to establish minimum norms regarding the definition of offences and sanctions in criminal areas which are extremely serious and affect a number of Member States. The areas in which the EU can establish specific norms are limited, but nevertheless, the Treaty grants the Council the possibility to adopt a decision in unanimity, after {{the approval of the}} European Parliament, in the meaning of extending the application of such regulations. This article aims to analyze this new situation and to identify some of the legal consequences in the area of criminal law of this regulation.

40|$|The United States'experience with {{antitrust}} {{and with}} <b>directive</b> <b>regulation</b> in the rail, trucking, airline, and telephone sectors offers useful lessons for developing countries. The experience highlights the realities both of market failure {{and of the}} difficulties of implementing regulation to control it - and reveals that imperfect regulation may be no better than imperfect competition. Antitrust measures to regulate price fixing and to require approval for mergers above some threshold level of industrial concentration are straightforward to implement and have provided some gains in economic welfare. The regulation of price discrimination, restrictive vertical practices, and predatory pricing is administratively more difficult, and the potential gains are less clearly evident. In many situations, import competition can be an efficient alternative. Direct regulation of rail, trucking, airline, and telephone was frequently inefficient, the regulatory apparatus often lost sight of its original objectives, and the regulators were captured by the regulated. For rail and trucking regulation, the regulatory outcome probably was worse {{than it would have}} been under laissez-faire.

40|$|This {{research}} has been inspired from the interconnection between employment /labor law issues and the EU rules governing circulation of services and the cross-borders market thereof. Such subjects are widely debated during European summits, symbolizing an unsettled tension between droit sociale and market economies. Accordingly, they are highly controversial and multi-faceted. This thesis focus on two main aspects of the above-mentioned subjects, a dynamic one (circulation and access to social services) and a static one (competition and derogation regime for the operation of services of general economic interest, pursuant to Article 106. 2 TFEU). Given to the scarcity of specific statutory provisions, the Author has attempted to outline a more complete, defined and certain legal framework through a deep study of the acts of EU Institutions and the (often) self-contradictory case law of the Court of Justice of the European Communities. Affirmation {{of the rights of}} citizenship - rather than economic freedoms or fair competition - has been the point of reference of this research. The expediency of adopting a European general Act on the legal basis of 14. 1 TFEU has been assessed, also trying to indicate the most effective type of act (<b>directive,</b> <b>regulation)</b> in order to counter an unbalanced application of market rules, enhanced by the current ambiguity of regulation: this in order to preserve the European Social Model, its existence being dependant (also) upon an appropriate body of social services...|$|E

The main concept of this project is based on idea to create real Linked Open Data (SmOD) infrastructure (also software tools and data sets) fed by freely available public data sources for biodiversity, environment protection and research in European rural territories, protected areas and national parks that satisfy the requirements of four (almost all possible) groups of target users of this product: public authorities, companies (also small and medium enterprises (SMEs), researchers and citizens.

Many {{gradual changes}} in science, law and society are {{crystallizing}} {{to shape a}} significant transformation in administrative law. The doctrinal framework within which Justice Schreiner himself attempted to modernize how law should regulate government and private economic activity seems from our vantage point to be quite antiquated. In explaining why, my examples {{will come from the}} world of financial services, but they could easily be found anywhere in the area of law and regulation. First I will outline the basic premises of prevailing doctrine and its growing shortcomings. Then I will describe developments in our understanding of the social ecologies through which law and regulation is transfused. I will consider some of the implications for {{the way in which we}} need to think about future regulation in order to be more effective in this complex world. We are moving from a framework of <b>directive</b> <b>regulation</b> to one that has to become much more adaptive. While my talk will focus on understanding markets as evolutionary social ecologies, and the consequences this has for administrative law and regulation, it is also important that these 2 ̆ 2 amoral bazaars 2 ̆ 2 be grounded on a foundation of moral aspiraton and integrity. I will therefore conclude with a reminder that we ignore at our peril the urgent responsibility of redeveloping a moral framework within which markets should operate...|$|E
40|$|Ammonia {{emissions}} are mainly related to agricultural activities, and depositions {{related to these}} emissions constitute a treat to local ecosystems but possibly also to human health through the contribution for formation of secondary fine fraction particles in ambient air. European ammonia {{emissions are}} highly heterogeneously distributed, and the temporal variations in these emissions follow very different pattern {{as a result of}} differences in climate but also as a results of significant differences in agricultural practice over Europe. A minor fraction of ammonia emission is related to nonagricultural sources, especially traffic. These sources are mainly found in areas with intense traffic and the use of catalyst converters. Simple and comprehensive models for the spatial and temporal variation in ammonia emissions have been shown useful in modelling of atmospheric nitrogen input to sensitive ecosystems for assessments of critical loads. For the spatial distribution various emission inventories are available at different resolutions. These inventories are derived using different approaches, and as a result they can differ up to a factor of two for certain areas. The overall European ammonia emissions are decreasing as a result of regulation related to the National Emission Ceiling Directive (NEC) and the Integrated Pollution Prevention and Control (IPPC) <b>directive,</b> <b>regulation</b> that has been implemented in national legislation in the single European countries. Some countries have adopted screening methods to be used by local authorities when assessing impact on local ecosystems in relation to applications from farmers to obtain permissions to increase agricultural production. In general Northern European countries have more strict regulation of ammonia emissions compared with Central and Southern European countries...|$|E

40|$|I. Introduction. 1. Importance of good {{negotiating}} skills. In Brussels nothing {{drops from}} the sky: not a <b>directive,</b> <b>regulation,</b> decision, green book, white book, recommendation, opinion, communication and so on. Everything {{is the result}} of the EU specific decision making process. This process is directed and controlled by negotiations. We can influence it to a high degree if we effectively participate in these negotiations. Effective participation in EU decision making means above all to take an active part in and to influence the far-reaching EU legislation. A regulation on environmental standards for example - after difficult negotiations adopted in Brussels today - will be published in the EU's Official Journal tomorrow. The day after tomorrow this regulation will represent directly applicable legislation for the EU's nearly 500 million citizens. If we want to make sure that our interests, the interests of our institution or our national interests are taken into account, we have to negotiate effectively. That’s one reason why good negotiating is so important in the EU. There is however another reason. Good bargaining in the EU is much more than pushing through our own interests, as the negotiations in the EU have to reconcile the very different interests of all participants, especially the interests of all Member States. Only if all participants negotiate well, can the negotiation result be acceptable to all EU partners in the long run. Most of the critical developments in the EU from the empty-chair policy in the sixties to the veto situations in the eighties and the crises in recent years may be explained as the result of negotiating mistakes. This is why good negotiating skills form a fundamental basis of the functioning and stability of the EU...|$|E
40|$|Popularization is a {{controversial}} field which, like modality, {{appears to be}} rather slippery and fuzzy, therefore still in need of much investigation as {{to the definition of}} its proper boundaries, its own linguistic markers, the ‘operationalization’ of control and power relations and embedding of political implications in it. Variation due to the co-existence of different types of popularization in the dissemination of specialized knowledge to lay people renders the whole matter all the more so. In an attempt to provide some new insights with particular reference to institutional discourse, this study aims to investigate features of popularization in the dissemination of legal knowledge in Summaries of EU legislation within the areas of freedom, security and justice. The Summaries, which are retrievable from the EU website, are in the form of factsheets which, following a standardised template, are drafted by a team of legal writers, who take account of any amendments to the law, and then validated by the relevant Commission departments. Adoptions of related acts are included in the Summaries. Each Summary thus simplifies one specific piece of legislation in force, e. g. <b>Directive,</b> <b>Regulation</b> or Decision (summaries of preparatory and other acts, communications, etc. are also provided as well as a link to the official and full-length version of the legislative provision on the EUR-Lex or PreLex site) and provides up-to-date coverage of EU legislation, except legal decisions having only temporary interest. It is worth noticing that the Summaries of EU legislation have only an informative and popularizing function and no legal value, as is underlined in the EU website. As to web users, {{it is not easy to}} identify and define the target audience of the Summaries since it will presumably include both experts and lay people. In fact, the Summaries provide specialized knowledge through links for the former, or anyone wishing to approach legislative provisions more closely, and general information for the latter. It is due to the peculiar nature of this type of popularization that the boundaries between the target (the Summary) and the source text (the Directive) are rather flexible...|$|E
