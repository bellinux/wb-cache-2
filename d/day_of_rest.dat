5|$|At {{the time}} Zara Yaqob assumed the throne, the Ethiopian church had been divided {{over the issue}} of Biblical Sabbath {{observance}} for roughly a century. One group, loyal to the Coptic bishops, believed that the <b>day</b> <b>of</b> <b>rest</b> should be observed only on Sunday, or Great Sabbath; another group, the followers of Ewostatewos, believed with their founder that both the original seventh-day Sabbath (i.e., Saturday, or Lesser Sabbath) and Sunday should be observed.|$|E
5|$|In March 1848, Garrison, the Motts, Abby Kelley Foster, Stephen Symonds Foster {{and others}} hosted an Anti-Sabbath meeting in Boston, {{to work toward}} the {{elimination}} of laws that apply only to Sunday, and to gain for the laborer more time away from toil than just one <b>day</b> <b>of</b> <b>rest</b> per week. Lucretia Mott and two other women were active within the executive committee, and Mott spoke to the assemblage. Lucretia Mott {{raised questions about the}} validity of blindly following religious and social tradition.|$|E
5|$|On October 2, Cleveland beat Detroit {{to clinch}} {{at least a}} tie, and Boston beat New York 5–1, ending the Yankees' pennant run and {{bringing}} the race down to two teams. On {{the last day of}} the season, October 3, Boston won their game and Cleveland lost, giving them identical 96–58 records and forcing a tiebreaker the following day at Boston. The Indians chose rookie Gene Bearden to start against Boston in the tie-breaker, despite only having one <b>day</b> <b>of</b> <b>rest,</b> as he had beaten the Red Sox twice that season, and the Red Sox chose Denny Galehouse, passing on Mel Parnell, who had beaten the Indians on three separate occasions that season.|$|E

5|$|On the Persian side, Kardarigan {{was also}} eager {{to fight and}} {{confident}} of victory. He arranged to be escorted by many camels carrying water for his troops in case the Byzantines refused to engage but continued to block access to the Arzamon, and had allegedly prepared iron bars and chains for the prisoners he would take. His movements, however, were detected when the Byzantines' Arab foederati captured {{a few of his}} men, allowing Philippicus to prepare his forces. This early warning was of particular importance since Kardarigan intended to attack on Sunday, a <b>day</b> <b>of</b> <b>rest</b> for the Christian Byzantines.|$|E
5|$|To remedy this situation, Riley hired his {{brother-in-law}} Henry Eitel, an Indianapolis banker, to manage his finances {{and act on}} his behalf to try and extricate him from his contract. Despite discussions and assurances from Pond that he would work to address the problem, Eitel had no success. Pond ultimately made the situation worse by booking months of solid performances, not allowing Riley and Nye a <b>day</b> <b>of</b> <b>rest.</b> These events affected Riley physically and emotionally; he became despondent and began his worst period of alcoholism. During November 1889, the tour was forced to cancel several shows after Riley became severely inebriated at a stop in Madison, Wisconsin.|$|E
5|$|Hobbs played {{just five}} {{first-class}} matches in 1921, when Australia toured England. In his opening first-class game, he played against the touring team, but tore the same thigh muscle injured in Australia. He missed the opening two Tests, but once recovered, scored a century for Surrey; as England trailed 2–0 in the five-Test series, the selectors chose {{him for the}} third Test. In the days approaching the match, played in Leeds, he suffered from increasing stomach pain but reluctantly played. On {{the first day of}} the match, he had to leave the field, and after a <b>day</b> <b>of</b> <b>rest</b> the pain worsened. He consulted Sir Berkley Moynihan, a prominent surgeon based in Leeds, who diagnosed acute appendicitis and operated the same day. In the opinion of the surgeon, Hobbs would not have lived another five hours without surgery. He missed the rest of the season.|$|E

5|$|The Wenxian Tongkao {{describes}} the main religions of Nubia, including the Da Qin religion (i.e. Christianity, particularly Nestorian Christianity {{associated with the}} Eastern Roman Empire) and the <b>day</b> <b>of</b> <b>rest</b> occurring every seven days for those following {{the faith of the}} Da shi (i.e. the Muslim Arabs). These passages are ultimately derived from the Jingxingji of Du Huan (fl. 8th century), a travel writer during the Chinese Tang dynasty (618–907) who was captured by Abbasid forces in the 751 Battle of Talas, after which he visited parts of West Asia and northeast Africa. Historian Wolbert Smidt identified the territory of Molin in Du's Jingxingji (preserved in part by the Tongdian of Du You) as the Christian kingdom of Muqurra in Nubia. He also associated the territory of Laobosa (Lao-p'o-sa) depicted therein with Abyssinia, thereby making this the first Chinese text to describe Ethiopia. When Du Huan left the region to return home, he did so through the Aksumite port of Adulis. Trade activity between Ethiopia and China during the latter's Song dynasty (960–1279) seems to be confirmed by Song-Chinese coinage found in the medieval village of Harla, near Dire Dawa, Ethiopia. The Chinese Ming dynasty (1368–1644) sent diplomats to Ethiopia, which was also frequented by Chinese merchants. Although only private and indirect trade was conducted with African countries during the early Manchu-led Qing dynasty (1644–1911), the Chinese were able to refer to Chinese-written travel literature and histories about East Africa before diplomatic relations were restored with African countries in the 19th century.|$|E
5|$|The {{uprising}} {{was launched}} {{on the hot}} summer day of 2 August 1943 (Monday, a regular <b>day</b> <b>of</b> <b>rest</b> from gassing), {{when a group of}} Germans and 40 Ukrainians drove off to the River Bug to swim. The conspirators silently unlocked the door to the arsenal near the train tracks, with a key that had been duplicated earlier. They had stolen 20–25 rifles, 20 hand grenades, and several pistols, and delivered them in a cart to the gravel work detail. At 3:45p.m., 700 Jews launched an insurgency that lasted for 30 minutes. They set buildings ablaze, exploded a tank of petrol, and set fire to the surrounding structures. A group of armed Jews attacked the main gate, and others attempted to climb the fence. Machine-gun fire from about 25 Germans and 60 Ukrainian Trawnikis resulted in near-total slaughter. Lajcher was killed along with most of the insurgents. About 200 Jews escaped from the camp. Half of them were killed after a chase in cars and on horses. The Jews did not cut the phone wires, and Stangl called in hundreds of German reinforcements, who arrived from four different towns and set up roadblocks along the way. Partisans of the Armia Krajowa (Polish: Home Army) transported some of the surviving escapees across the river and others like Sperling ran 30 kilometres (19 miles) and were then helped and fed by Polish villagers. Of those who broke through, around 70 are known to have survived {{until the end of the}} war, including the future authors of published Treblinka memoirs: Richard Glazar, Chil Rajchman, Jankiel Wiernik, and Samuel Willenberg.|$|E
5|$|Rainilaiarivony's first royal wife, Queen Rasoherina, died on 1 April 1868, and was {{succeeded by}} her cousin RanavalonaII (crowned on 3 September 1868) who, like Rasoherina, was a widow of RadamaII. RanavalonaII was a pupil of Protestant missionaries and had {{converted}} to Christianity. Rainilaiarivony recognized the growing power of Christianity {{on the island}} and identified the need to bring it under his influence in order to avert destabilizing cultural and political power struggles. The Prime Minister encouraged the new queen to Christianize the court through a public baptism ceremony at Andohalo on 21 February 1869, the day of their marriage. In this ceremony the supernatural royal talismans were ordered to be destroyed and replaced by the Bible. The Christianization of the court and the establishment of the independent royal Protestant chapel on the palace grounds prompted the wide-scale conversion {{of hundreds of thousands of}} Malagasy. These conversions were commonly motivated by a desire to express political allegiance to the Crown, and as such were largely nominal, with the majority of converts practicing a syncretic blend of Christian and traditional religions. Rainilaiarivony's biographers conclude that the Prime Minister's own conversion was also largely a political gesture and most likely did not denote a genuine spiritual shift until late in his life, if ever. Some local officials attempted to force conversions to Protestantism by mandating church attendance and persecuting Catholics, but Rainilaiarivony quickly responded to quell these overzealous practices. The Prime Minister's criminalization of polygamy and alcohol consumption, as well as the declaration of Sunday as a <b>day</b> <b>of</b> <b>rest,</b> were likewise inspired by the growing British and Protestant influences in the country. The Christianization of the court came at a steep personal price: with the outlawing of polygamy, Rainilaiarivony was forced to repudiate his first wife. The Prime Minister was deeply saddened by this necessity and by the consequent souring of his relationships with Rasoanalina and their children after the divorce.|$|E

25|$|While the Gregorian {{calendar}} {{was implemented}} in Soviet Russia in February 1918 by dropping the Julian dates of 1–13 February 1918 pursuant to a Sovnarkom decree, the Soviet calendar added five- and six-day work weeks between 1929 and 1940. Although the traditional seven-day week was still recognized, a <b>day</b> <b>of</b> <b>rest</b> on Sunday {{was replaced by}} one <b>day</b> <b>of</b> <b>rest</b> in each work week.

25|$|The {{seventh and}} {{deciding}} {{game of the}} series was scheduled for Sunday night, October 26. However, heavy rain caused the postponement of the game one night and the game was played on Monday night, October 27. The Mets sent Ron Darling, their scheduled starter, out for Game 7 with an extra <b>day</b> <b>of</b> <b>rest</b> due to the rainout. Oil Can Boyd, who had struggled in his Game 3 start earlier in the series, {{was supposed to take}} the mound for the Red Sox in Game 7. The postponement gave Red Sox manager John McNamara another idea, and he decided to start Bruce Hurst, already 2-0 in the series and the presumptive series MVP if the Red Sox won, instead of Boyd as the rainout enabled him to get a third <b>day</b> <b>of</b> <b>rest</b> and thus be ready to go for the decider. Boyd, upset at not being given the ball as he was supposed to, went into the clubhouse and decided to drown his sorrows in alcohol. Thus, when pitching coach Bill Fischer went to check on him, he found Boyd was highly intoxicated and thus in no condition to pitch in relief that night if he was needed.|$|E
