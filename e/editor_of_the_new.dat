5|$|On Sunday May 21, 1950, Barnett Newman {{took the}} signed {{statement}} to the city <b>editor</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>New</b> York Times. Newman had run for mayor of New York as a write-in candidate in 1933 and knew Monday to be a slow news day at the Times. The statement, entitled OPEN LETTER TO ROLAND L. REDMOND, dated May 20, appeared {{on the front page}} of the Times of May 22.|$|E
5|$|After two weeks, {{when the}} {{dealership}} had sold every print it had, Ortiz removed the display. In {{a letter to}} the <b>editor</b> <b>of</b> <b>The</b> <b>New</b> York Times, he accused Comstock of causing the controversy to earn greater publicity for himself, and stated that he wearied of crowds outside his shop, who blocked paying customers from entering it. Ultimately, Comstock did not pursue legal action. The historian Walter M. Kendrick attributes this apparent leniency to September Morn status as a work of art, whereas Gerald Carson, writing in American Heritage, attributes it to a knowledge that no action could be taken against the work.|$|E
5|$|Japan Echo was {{the brainchild}} of Kazutoshi Hasegawa, an {{employee}} at the Overseas Public Relations Division of the Japanese Foreign Affairs Ministry, who was disturbed by what he perceived to be misinformation and misunderstandings about Japan printed in the foreign press. Hasegawa recruited Yoshihiko Seki, a social scientist teaching at Tokyo Metropolitan University, to be the first <b>editor</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>new</b> journal, which was to be published independently by a new company called Japan Echo Inc. founded in June 1974 by Jiji Press reporter Takeshi Mochida.|$|E

5|$|Manhattan {{shares a}} final kiss with Jupiter before departing {{permanently}} to another galaxy, while an enraged Dreiberg attacks Veidt, who makes {{no effort to}} defend himself. Nevertheless, he defends his actions, claiming that for world peace to be possible, {{there had to be}} sacrifice. Dreiberg rejects his logic declaring that Veidt has deformed and mutilated humanity. Dreiberg and Jupiter return to New York with plans to continue fighting crime. Later, an <b>editor</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>New</b> Frontiersman tells a young employee that, as the world is at peace, there is nothing to report on. The editor gives the employee permission to print the contents of a collection of crank mailings, among which is Rorschach's journal.|$|E
5|$|In America, {{he again}} tried {{his hand at}} journalism, but a brief stint as <b>editor</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>New</b> Yorker Yiddishe Ilustrirte Zaitung {{resulted}} only in getting the paper suspended and landing himself a rather large fine. On March 31, 1905, he recited poetry at a benefit performance at Cooper Union to raise a pension for Yiddish poet Eliakum Zunser, even worse off than himself because he had found himself unable to write since coming to America in 1889. Shortly afterwards, he met {{a group of young}} people who had a Hebrew language association at the Dr. Herzl Zion Club, and wrote a Hebrew-language play David ba-Milchama (David in the War), which they performed in March 1906, the first Hebrew-language play to be performed in America. Repeat performances in March 1907 and April 1908 drew successively larger crowds.|$|E
5|$|Wendell and Edith Willkie {{moved to}} New York in October 1929, only {{weeks before the}} Wall Street Crash of 1929, and found an {{apartment}} overlooking Central Park. Initially intimidated by the size and anonymity of the big city, Wendell Willkie soon learned to love it. He attended the Broadway theatre, and read through ten newspapers each day. Willkie {{and his wife had}} little in common, and grew apart through the 1930s. He acquired a social life, and met Irita Van Doren, the book review <b>editor</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>New</b> York Herald Tribune who became a friend, and later his lover. Cultured, brilliant and well connected, Van Doren introduced him to new books, new ideas, and new circles of friends. Unlike Van Doren, Willkie was indiscreet about their relationship, and their affair was well known to the reporters covering him during his 1940 presidential campaign. None of them printed a word.|$|E

5|$|At Marsh's urging, Powell {{pushed for}} Cope to return {{specimens}} he had unearthed during his employment under the government surveys. This was an outrage to Cope, {{who had used}} his own money {{while working as a}} volunteer. In response, Cope went to the <b>editor</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>New</b> York Herald and promised a scandalous headline. Since 1885, Cope had kept an elaborate journal of mistakes and misdeeds that both Marsh and Powell had committed over the years. From scientific errors to publishing mistakes, he had them written down in a journal he kept in the bottom drawer of his Pine Street desk. Cope sought out Marsh's assistants, who complained of being denied access and credit by their employer and of being chronically underpaid. Reporter William Hosea Ballou ran the first article on January 12, 1890, in what would become a series of newspaper debates between Marsh, Powell, and Cope. Cope attacked Marsh for plagiarism and financial mismanagement, and attacked Powell for his geological classification errors and misspending of government-allocated funds. Marsh and Powell published their own side of the story and, in the end, little changed. No congressional hearing was created to investigate Powell's alleged misallocation of funds, while Cope and Marsh were not held responsible for any mistakes. Indirectly, however, the attacks may have been influential in Marsh's fall from power in the survey. Due to pressure from Powell over bad press, Marsh was removed from his position for the government surveys. Cope's relations {{with the president of the}} University of Pennsylvania soured, and the entire funding for paleontology in the government surveys was pulled.|$|E
