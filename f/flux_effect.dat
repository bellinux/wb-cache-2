50|$|The LP effect {{consists}} in a periodic {{variation of the}} Tc with the magnetic flux, which {{is the product of}} the magnetic field (coaxial) and the cross sectional area of the cylinder. Tc depends on the kinetic energy (KE) of the superconducting electrons. More precisely, the Tc is such temperature at which the free energies of normal and superconducting electrons are equal, for a given magnetic field. To understand the periodic oscillation of the Tc, which constitutes the LP effect, one needs to understand the periodic variation of the kinetic energy. The KE oscillates because the applied magnetic flux increases the KE while superconducting vortices, periodically entering the cylinder, compensate for the <b>flux</b> <b>effect</b> and reduce the KE. Thus, the periodic oscillation of the kinetic energy and the related periodic oscillation of the critical temperature occur together.|$|E

40|$|The {{normalization}} of sediment accumulation rates by 230 Th is increasingly used to constrain particle rain rates because 230 Th is produced at a known {{rate in the}} water column and removed relatively quickly to the sediment. Several recent contributions have questioned this approach and suggested that the preferential removal of 230 Th in areas of high particle flux, the "particle flux effect," introduces a systematic bias in the 230 Th normalization technique. We use a circulation model that includes a description of particle scavenging to show that the particle <b>flux</b> <b>effect</b> cannot explain observations of high 230 Th accumulation in equatorial Pacific sediments (relative to 230 Th production {{in the water column}}). We further consider the possible variation of particle rain rates over time. We find only a minimal sensitivity in the particle <b>flux</b> <b>effect</b> due to increases in the particle rain rate at the equatorial Pacific by a factor of up to 10. This situation exists because the residence time of 230 Th in the water column is too short to permit significant lateral transport with reasonable isopycnal mixing coefficients. We conclude that the increased rates of 230 Th accumulation found in equatorial Pacific sediments deposited during the Last Glacial Maximum cannot have been caused by the particle <b>flux</b> <b>effect.</b> Copyright 2008 by the American Geophysical Union...|$|E

All specimens were irradiated in surveillance channel positions under similar conditions at high 4 1012 - cm 2 s 1 and low 6 1011 cm 2 s 1 fluxes (E > 0. 5 MeV) at a temperature of 270 C.

40|$|In this work, two low-valued natural raw {{materials}} were used, namely a low plasticity and high iron content clay and a powdered rock waste generated during crushing of igneous rocks to produce construction aggregates. After characterization (chemical, mineralogical, thermal and granulometric), mixtures containing up to 75 wt% of rock powder were prepared and extruded closely following industrial practice, and fired for 60 min from 900 to 1100 degrees C. Property development was evaluated on as-extruded, dried and fired pieces. The results obtained were interpreted based on chemical compositions, the estimates from the Al 2 O 3 -SiO 2 -CaO phase diagram and presumed reaction kinetics. Such interpretation showed that physical characteristics dominate not only during shaping and drying, but also during low temperature firing (slow reaction kinetics), when rock additions act as inert material; at high firing temperatures, however, the rock promotes liquid phase development after first melting (<b>fluxing</b> <b>effect)</b> and thermodynamics prevail. The dominant <b>fluxing</b> <b>effect</b> results in improved fired properties, which {{were shown to}} depend almost linearly on the liquid phase content, predicted by the phase diagram and determined by the chemical composition.

Unfortunately, TTS may accelerate at high fluence, and may be further amplified by the formation of late blooming phases that result in severe embrittlement even in low-copper (Cu) steels.
