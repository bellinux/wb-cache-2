5|$|Diving {{medicine}} {{deals with}} medical research {{on issues of}} diving, the prevention of diving <b>disorders,</b> treatment of diving accident injuries and diving fitness.

In diving accidents it is common for multiple <b>disorders</b> to occur together and interact with each other, both causatively and as complications.

5|$|Little {{progress}} was made over the next century in explaining or treating tics, and a psychogenic view prevailed well into the 20th century.

5|$|Mental health {{consists}} of a broad scope of measurements of mental well being including depression, stress and measurements of self-worth. Numerous factors affect the prevalence of mental health <b>disorders</b> among women in India, including older age, low educational attainment, fewer children in the home, lack of paid employment and excessive spousal alcohol use. There is also {{evidence to suggest that}} disadvantages associated with gender increase the risk for mental health <b>disorders.</b> Women who find it acceptable for men to use violence against female partners may view themselves as less valuable than men. In turn, this may lead women to seek out fewer avenues of healthcare inhibiting their ability to cope with various mental <b>disorders.</b>|$|E

5|$|Rumination {{syndrome}} {{is a condition}} which affects {{the functioning of the}} stomach and esophagus, also known as a functional gastroduodenal disorder. In patients that have a history of eating <b>disorders,</b> Rumination {{syndrome is}} grouped alongside eating <b>disorders</b> such as bulimia and pica, which are themselves grouped under non-psychotic mental disorder. In most healthy adolescents and adults who have no mental disability, Rumination syndrome is considered a motility disorder instead of an eating disorder, because the patients tend to have had no control over its occurrence and have had no history of eating <b>disorders.</b>|$|E
5|$|Secondary {{causes of}} tics (not related to {{inherited}} Tourette syndrome) are {{commonly referred to}} as tourettism. Dystonias, choreas, other genetic conditions, and secondary causes of tics should be ruled out in the differential diagnosis for Tourette syndrome. Other conditions that may manifest tics or stereotyped movements include developmental <b>disorders,</b> autism spectrum <b>disorders,</b> and stereotypic movement disorder; Sydenham's chorea; idiopathic dystonia; and genetic conditions such as Huntington's disease, neuroacanthocytosis, Hallervorden-Spatz syndrome, Duchenne muscular dystrophy, Wilson's disease, and tuberous sclerosis. Other possibilities include chromosomal <b>disorders</b> such as Down syndrome, Klinefelter syndrome, XYY syndrome and fragile X syndrome. Acquired causes of tics include drug-induced tics, head trauma, encephalitis, stroke, and carbon monoxide poisoning. The symptoms of Lesch-Nyhan syndrome may also be confused with Tourette syndrome. Most of these conditions are rarer than tic <b>disorders,</b> and a thorough history and examination may be enough to rule them out, without medical or screening tests.|$|E

5|$|Suicide is {{the act of}} {{intentionally}} causing one's own death. Risk {{factors include}} mental <b>disorders</b> such as depression, bipolar disorder, schizophrenia, personality <b>disorders,</b> and substance abuse, including alcoholism and use of benzodiazepines. Other suicides are impulsive acts due to stress such as from financial difficulties, troubles with relationships, or from bullying. Those who have previously attempted suicide are at higher risk for future attempts. Suicide prevention efforts include limiting access to methods of suicide, such as firearms, drugs, and poisons, treating mental <b>disorders</b> and substance misuse, proper media reporting of suicide, and improving economic conditions. Although crisis hotlines are common, {{there is little evidence}} for their effectiveness.|$|E
5|$|The {{diagnostic}} {{complexities of}} RAD mean that careful diagnostic evaluation by a trained mental health expert with particular expertise in differential diagnosis is considered essential. Several other <b>disorders,</b> such as conduct <b>disorders,</b> oppositional defiant disorder, anxiety <b>disorders,</b> post traumatic stress disorder and social phobia share many symptoms {{and are often}} comorbid with or confused with RAD, leading to over and under diagnosis. RAD can also be confused with neuropsychiatric <b>disorders</b> such as autism, pervasive developmental disorder, childhood schizophrenia and some genetic syndromes. Infants with this disorder can be distinguished from those with organic illness by their rapid physical improvement after hospitalization. Autistic children {{are likely to be}} of normal size and weight and often exhibit a degree of intellectual disability. They are unlikely to improve upon being removed from the home.|$|E
