40|$|Abstract: <b>Fore-and-aft</b> <b>vibration</b> of a {{backrest}} can influence discomfort {{and the risk}} of injury associated with wholebody vibration. Relevant standards (BS 6841 : 1987 and ISO 2631 - 1 : 1997) recommend the Wc frequency weighting for evaluating <b>fore-and-aft</b> <b>vibration</b> of backrests, but do not specify the precise location for measuring vibration. This study determined equivalent comfort contours for <b>fore-and-aft</b> <b>vibration</b> of the backs of seated persons from 2 to 80 Hz using the method of magnitude estimation, examining the effect of input location, contact area, and body posture. The equivalent comfort contours indicate decreased sensitivity to vibration acceleration at frequencies greater than 8 Hz. Equivalent comfort contours with a full backrest were similar to those with contact at only the highest location on the back. The derived frequency weightings are broadly consistent with frequency weighting Wc but suggest somewhat greater sensitivity at frequencies greater than 30 Hz and vary in shape with changes in vibration magnitude. It is concluded that with low and moderate magnitudes of vibration the severity of <b>fore-and-aft</b> <b>vibration</b> of {{a backrest}} can be assessed from the frequency-weighted fore-and-aft acceleration measured at the highest point of contact between the backrest and the body if the frequency weighting Wc is employed in the evaluation...|$|E
40|$|Although the {{discomfort}} or injury associated with whole-body vibration cannot be predicted {{directly from the}} power absorbed during exposure to vibration, the absorbed power may contribute to understanding of the biodynamics involved in such responses. From measurements of force and acceleration at the seat, the feet, and the backrest, the power absorbed at these three locations was calculated for subjects sitting in four postures (feet hanging, maximum thigh contact, average thigh contact, and minimum thigh contact) both with and without a rigid vertical backrest while exposed to four magnitudes (0. 125, 0. 25, 0. 625, and 1. 25 m s? 2 rms) of random <b>fore-and-aft</b> <b>vibration.</b> The power absorbed by the body at the supporting seat surface {{when there was no}} backrest showed a peak around 1 Hz and another peak between 3 and 4 Hz. Supporting the back with the backrest decreased the power absorbed at the seat at low frequencies but increased the power absorbed at high frequencies. Foot support influenced both the magnitude and the frequency of the peaks in the absorbed power spectra as well as the total absorbed power. The measurements of absorbed power are consistent with backrests being beneficial during exposure to low frequency <b>fore-and-aft</b> <b>vibration</b> but detrimental with high frequency <b>fore-and-aft</b> <b>vibration...</b>|$|E

40|$|The {{detection}} of a vibration {{may be reduced}} {{by the presence of}} another vibration: a phenomenon known as ‘masking’. This study investigated how the {{detection of}} one frequency of vibration is influenced by vibration at another frequency. With nine subjects, thresholds for detecting <b>fore-and-aft</b> backrest <b>vibration</b> were determined (for 4, 8, 16, and 31. 5 -Hz sinusoidal vibration) {{in the presence of a}} masker vibration (4 -Hz random vibration, 1 / 3 -octave bandwidth at six intensities). The masker vibration increased thresholds for perceiving vibration at each frequency by an amount that reduced with increasing difference between the frequency of the sinusoidal vibration and the frequency of the masker vibration. The 4 -Hz random vibration almost completely masked 4 -Hz sinusoidal vibration, partially masked 8 - and 16 -Hz vibration, and only slightly masked 31. 5 -Hz vibration. The findings might be explained by the involvement of different sensory systems and different body locations in the detection of different frequencies of vibratio...|$|R
40|$|It is {{currently}} {{assumed that the}} same frequency weightings, derived from studies of vibration discomfort, {{can be used to}} evaluate the severity of vibration at all vibration magnitudes from the threshold of vibration perception to the vibration magnitudes associated with risks to health. This experimental study determined equivalent comfort contours for the whole-body vibration of seated subjects over the frequency range 2 – 315 Hz {{in each of the three}} orthogonal axes (fore-and-aft, lateral and vertical). The contours were determined at vibration magnitudes from the threshold of perception to levels associated with severe discomfort and risks to health. At frequencies greater than 10 Hz, thresholds for the perception of vertical vibration were lower than thresholds for <b>fore-and-aft</b> and lateral <b>vibration.</b> At frequencies less than 4 Hz, thresholds for vertical vibration were higher than thresholds for <b>fore-and-aft</b> and lateral <b>vibration.</b> The rate of growth of sensation with increasing vibration magnitude was highly dependent on the frequency and axis of vibration. Consequently, the shapes of the equivalent comfort contours depended on vibration magnitude. At medium and high vibration magnitudes, the equivalent comfort contours were reasonably consistent with the frequency weightings for vibration discomfort in current standards (i. e. Wb and Wd). At low vibration magnitudes, the contours indicate that relative to lower frequencies the standards underestimate sensitivity at frequencies greater than about 30 Hz. The results imply that no single linear frequency weighting can provide accurate predictions of discomfort caused by a wide range of magnitudes of whole-body vibratio...|$|R
40|$|The dynamic {{interaction}} between the human back and a backrest is complex: the forces at the back–backrest interface depend on the dynamic characteristics of both the back and the backrest, which vary with location over the backrest. This experimental {{study was designed to}} investigate the variation in the ratio of the force to acceleration (referred to as the apparent mass) at the back associated with variations in the vertical position and the magnitude of <b>fore-and-aft</b> <b>vibration.</b> Twelve male subjects were exposed to random <b>fore-and-aft</b> <b>vibration</b> in the frequency range 0. 25 – 10 Hz at five vibration magnitudes (0. 1, 0. 2, 0. 4, 0. 8 and 1. 6 m s? 2 rms). The fore-and-aft forces were measured at five vertical locations (using a flat vertical contact area 120 mm in height) and with a flat vertical backrest covering the entire back. At all locations, but not for all subjects, three resonances were observed in the fore-and-aft apparent mass of the back. The first resonance around 1 – 2 Hz was most visible at the middle and lower back. A clearer, second resonance was exhibited between 4 and 5 Hz (in the upper back) and between 5 and 8 Hz (in the middle and lower back). A third resonance around 7 Hz was most apparent in the middle back. The forces at the back were highly dependent on the location: the lower back produced greater forces than the middle and the upper back. The apparent mass of the entire back showed three resonances at similar frequencies: around 2 Hz, between 4 and 6 Hz and between 7 and 8 Hz. The first and the third resonances were observed in most subjects, but not all. With the entire back, the forces were similar to those with the middle back. With variations in vibration magnitude, a nonlinearity in the apparent mass of the back was evident at all locations and with the entire back. It is concluded that biodynamic models of seated persons in contact with a backrest and excited by <b>fore-and-aft</b> <b>vibration</b> should allow for the effects of vibration magnitude and the location of excitation...|$|E
40|$|Car seats have {{inclined}} backrests and inclined seat-pans, {{but there}} has been little study of how the inclinations of the surfaces of a seat influence the transmission of <b>fore-and-aft</b> <b>vibration</b> through the backrest. The effects of backrest inclination and seat-pan inclination on the fore-and-aft transmissibilities of two seats (a car seat and a rigid seat with solid foam backrest) have been investigated in the laboratory. With 12 subjects, each seat was exposed to random <b>fore-and-aft</b> <b>vibration</b> in the frequency range 0. 25 – 20 Hz with a vibration magnitude of 0. 4 ms? 2 rms. At six vertical locations on each backrest, the fore-and-aft transmissibilities of the backrests were measured with four backrest inclinations (90 ° (i. e. vertical), 105 °, 100 °, and 105 °) and up to four seat-pan inclinations (0 ° (i. e. horizontal), 5 °, 10 °, and 15 °). At all six measurement locations, there was a resonance of both backrests at about 4 Hz, which increased in frequency with increasing backrest inclination for the car seat but showed little change with inclination for the foam backrest. The inclination of the backrest had more influence at the bottom that {{at the top of the}} backrest of the car seat, but showed little variation with position on the foam backrest. Variations in seat-pan inclination had little influence on the resonance frequencies of either backrest at any location. Inclining the backrest and the seat-pan increased the transmissibility at resonance with the car seat, but produced little change with the foam backrest. It is concluded that both the backrest inclination and the seat inclination can affect the fore-and-aft transmissibility of backrests but, with moderate changes of inclination, the effects are not larg...|$|E
40|$|Measurements of the {{transmission}} of vibration from the floor beneath a seat to interfaces between the seat and the human body are used to characterise the dynamic performance of the seat. Most studies of seat transmissibility concern {{the transmission}} of vertical vibration through seat pan cushions, but <b>fore-and-aft</b> <b>vibration</b> at a seat pan and backrest can also cause discomfort. This study investigated {{the transmission of}} <b>fore-and-aft</b> <b>vibration</b> through a car seat to surfaces on the seat pan cushion, the backrest cushion and the headrest, and also to the seat frame at these three locations. The study sought to understand the influences of the seat frame and the cushion foam and to provide data for dynamic modelling of the seat. The fore-and-aft transmissibility of the seat was measured with 12 human subjects and an SAE J 826 manikin, using 120 -s periods of fore-and-aft random vibration (0. 25 - 40 Hz) at three magnitudes (0. 4 m/s 2 r. m. s., 0. 8 m/s 2 r. m. s. and 1. 2 m/s 2 r. m. s.). With the manikin, there were three resonances (at 3. 5 Hz, 12 Hz and 20 Hz) in the transmissibilities from the seat base to the seat pan frame and the seat pan cushion, and to the backrest frame and the backrest cushion. With the human subjects, the transmissibilities from the seat base to all six locations on the seat showed a principal resonance around 4 Hz. With increasing magnitude of the vibration, the principal resonance frequency in all the seat transmissibilities decreased. It is concluded that fore-and-aft resonances in the seat transmissibilities, especially to the backrest, are likely to affect vibration discomfort. There are large differences between the fore-and-aft transmissibility of a seat with a manikin and those with human subjects, consistent with the human body having dynamics very {{different from those of}} a rigid mass. Non-linearities in the seat transmissibilities with the manikin and with the human subjects may be explained by non-linearity in the biodynamics of the body and the responses of the seat and the manikin. </p...|$|E

Subjects sat in each of four sitting postures having varying foot heights, so as to produce differing thigh contact with the seat. The fore-and-aft forces on the seat depended on whether the feet were supported on a footrest: peaks were found at two frequencies when the feet were not supported, compared to only one peak when the feet were supported. The fore-and-aft forces at the backrest were high, with their peak magnitudes correlated with subject mass. Vertical forces were high on the seat {{but not on the}} backrest. Lateral forces were relatively low on both the seat and the backrest. In all directions, forces on the seat and the backrest showed a nonlinear behaviour.

The {{objective of this}} study was to evaluate the effects of seat cushions on mitigating the higher frequency (> 10 Hz) multi-axis vibration associated with Navy E- 2 C Hawkeye operations. An E- 2 C crew seat was used in the laboratory during exposure to a selected operational signal. Triaxial accelerations were measured at the interface between the human and cushion (seat pan and seat back). The most pronounced effects were observed at the blade passage frequency (~ 73. 5 Hz). The highest vibration occurred at the seat pan in the fore-and-aft (X) direction of the subject (lateral direction of the aircraft). Substantial vibration was observed at the seat back in the vertical (Z) direction. Significantly lower levels of <b>fore-and-aft</b> (X) <b>vibration</b> occurred at the seat pan with all cushions as compared to the original E- 2 C cushion (P< 0. 05).

It is necessary to understand the level of Whole-Body-Vibration (WBV) exposure since it affects comfort and health performance of humans. Objective {{of this study is to}} investigate the exposure levels in operators of construction vehicles. In addition, preventive strategies, which are needed to reduce low back pain problems due to WBV, will be investigated. Ten operators of vehicles were selected where the vehicles were chosen so that those are vastly used in the construction sector. In this study, it was selected three construction vehicle types: excavators, backhoes and roller vibrators. A questionnaire survey was carried out with each operator regarding their profession, age, working experiences, health and exposure duration. The vibration exposure levels induced on operators bodies were measured using a tri axial vibration meter (SV 106) attached to a seat pad accelerometer. The operator was instructed to sat on seat-pad accelerometer and WBV exposures in three directions (i. e., vertical, fore-and-aft and lateral) were measured. It was found that the vibrational effect on vertical direction is more dominant than the other two directions (i. e., lateral and <b>fore-and-aft).</b> Measured <b>vibration</b> exposure levels were assessed based on recommendations given in ISO 2631 : 1997 and are presented in the paper...|$|R

Previous findings showing how the discomfort of standing people depends on the frequency of fore-and-aft, lateral, and vertical vibration were used to define frequency weightings that reflect relative sensitivity to vibration in each direction.

The mathematical {{model can be}} used to obtain a better insight into the mechanisms and biodynamic behavior of the SHS system. The main limitation of some previous SHS models is that they were derived to satisfy a single biodynamic response function. Such an approach may provide a reasonable fit with the function data being considered but uncertain matches with the others. The model presented in this study is based on all three types of biodynamic response functions: Seat-To-Head Transmissibility (STHT), Driving-Point Mechanical Impedance (DPMI) and Apparent Mass (APM). The objective of this work is to match all three functions and to represent the biodynamic behavior of SHS in a more comprehensive way. Three sets of synthesized experimental data from published literature are selected as the target values {{for each of the three}} transfer functions. A curve fitting method is used in the parameter identification process which involves the solution of a multi variable optimization function comprising the root mean square errors between the computed values using the model and those target values measured experimentally.

The system uses two electrodynamic shakers to generate vibrations along two mutually perpendicular axes (vertical and horizontal) and allows {{the identification of the}} full AM matrix with two tests, in which the standing subject is exposed to vertical excitation combined in turn with <b>fore-and-aft</b> and lateral <b>vibration.</b> A 3 -D force platform measures the forces and the torques transmitted from the vibrating platform to the feet. The force platform, set up with piezoelectric load cells, has been designed in order to obtain a measurement bandwidth of 20 Hz.

The force platform has been calibrated with a least-squares approach, using reference masses and a dynamometric hammer. The AM uncertainty, evaluated through the experiments' repeatability and reproducibility, is lower than 3. 4 % along the three axes (confidence level 68 %).

40|$|The {{effect of}} the {{magnitude}} of <b>fore-and-aft</b> and lateral <b>vibration</b> on the subjective and mechanical responses of seated subjects has been investigated experimentally using simultaneous measurements of relative discomfort and apparent mass. Twelve male subjects were exposed to sinusoidal vibration at nine frequencies (between 1. 6 and 10 Hz) at four magnitudes (in the range 0. 125 – 1. 0 m s? 2 r. m. s.) in both horizontal directions (fore-and-aft and lateral). The method of magnitude estimation was used to estimate discomfort relative to that caused by a 4 Hz reference vibration in the same axis. The apparent mass was calculated from the acceleration and the applied force so as to quantify the mechanical response of the body. With each direction of excitation, the apparent mass was normalised by dividing it by the apparent mass obtained at 4 Hz, so that the mechanical responses could be compared with the subjective responses. The relative discomfort and the normalised apparent mass were similarly affected by the frequency and magnitude of vibration, with significant correlations between the relative discomfort and the normalised apparent mass. The results indicate that the discomfort caused by horizontal whole-body vibration is associated with the apparent mass in a frequency range where motion of the whole body is dominant. In this frequency range, the nonlinear subjective responses may be attributed, at least in part, to the nonlinear dynamic responses to horizontal whole-body vibratio...|$|R

The frequency domain identification method is used to determine the coefficients of the mathematical model of the HNC. Good agreement has been obtained between experimental and simulation results.

It was assumed that the {{motion of the}} HNC only occurs in mid-sagittal plane. An electro-hydraulic vibrator was used as a source of vibration. The input acceleration and HNC angular velocity were measured whereas the trunk of the seated subject was fixed to the seatback. Accordingly, the acceleration of the vibrator was considered to be equal to that of the trunk. Six subjects took part in the experiment. They were exposed to the random motion at a magnitude of 1. 60 ms- 2 rms (root-mean-square) for 50 seconds. The coherence and frequency response function between the HNC angular velocity and the trunk horizontal acceleration were then obtained on 0. 5 Hz to 10 Hz.

The load-deflection curves of the backrest cushion of the car seat were measured in three extra lumbar support conditions (regarded as “No”, “Half” and “Full” lumbar supports).

The peak at the resonance of the acceleration transmissibility from the seat base to the backrest decreased, while that in the transmissibility from the seat base to the seat pan increased, when increasing the lumbar support.

40|$|In this {{conclusion}} to a four-part series of papers, {{an interpretation of}} the experimental data presented in the earlier three papers is given. The results obtained from the experiments are compared with those obtained by other researchers. A set of simplified approximations to the various equivalent comfort contours are defined and a general approach to the prediction of discomfort due to multi-axis, multi-input complex vibration is given. It is shown that the results for translational vibration of a seat surface supporting the body are reasonably consistent with some previous studies. Although the contours for <b>fore-and-aft</b> and lateral <b>vibration</b> are in agreement with those in ISO 2631 (1978) there is evidence that sensitivity to vertical seat vibration above 8  Hz should be greater than defined in that standard. It is shown that the results for rotational seat vibration differ by an order of magnitude from those published by other authors but that this difference may be explained by the positions of the centres of rotation used in other studies. It is shown that simple approximations to the median equivalent comfort contours for translational and rotational seat vibration and translational foot and back vibration may be defined by contours on acceleration frequency graph having a slope of O dB per octave (constant acceleration) and 6 dB per octave (constant velocity). For most conditions these contours fall within the 25 th- 75 th percentile of the experimental data.

40|$|The {{comfort of}} a seated person exposed to {{vibration}} {{is known to}} depend on the magnitude, frequency content, and direction of the excitation. A review of the literature showed that very {{little is known about the}} effects of the duration of exposure to vibration on comfort. This thesis investigates the effects of body support, frequency, waveform, and direction of excitation on the Subjective Discomfort Time-Dependency (SDTD) during vibration so as to improve understanding of the mechanisms involved (e. g. the biodynamic responses of the body and muscle activity) and elaborate a model predicting how discomfort evolves with exposure duration. To achieve these objectives, a new method of measuring the discomfort time-dependency was developed and tested. The Subjective Discomfort Time-Dependency has been investigated in 27 experimental sessions, each with twelve subjects seated on a conventional car seat. In each session, subjects were exposed to one stimulus. The new developed method requires the subjects to adjust the magnitude of the vibration in order to keep constant their discomfort. The SDTD was obtained by measuring the platform acceleration over the exposure duration. At specific time-intervals, subjects were also asked to indicate the locations of their discomfort and provide discomfort ratings for these locations. Results showed that the amount of vibration to achieve a constant level of discomfort decreased over time (mainly during the first 15 minutes of exposure). This implies that the sensitivity of vibration increases with duration. Fore-and-aft excitations generated a greater SDTD for most stimuli. For 1 -Hz lateral sinusoidal motion, the sensitivity of vibration increased at a greater rate with a harness than without. Stimuli at 1 Hz produced SDTD that were less dependent on the duration of exposure than stimuli at higher frequencies. The waveforms of the vibration had little effect on the SDTD. The discomfort rating showed that prolonged exposure to vibration produced discomfort mainly at the neck. Because discomfort was mainly felt at the neck and that the SDTD depended on the frequency, it was hypothesised that the type of neck muscle activity produced during exposure to vibration depends on the frequency. Neck muscle activity was measured with 12 seated subjects during 10 minutes of <b>fore-and-aft</b> sinusoidal <b>vibration.</b> The r. m. s. magnitudes of the raw EMG and of the phasic and tonic components of the EMG were calculated (it was assumed that phasic muscle activity arose from the periodic vibration whereas the tonic muscle activity was needed to respond to a static load). Results showed that the frequency of vibration had no effect on the EMG r. m. s values but affected the phasic and tonic components of the EMG. Phasic activity was greatest at 1 Hz and decreased as the frequency increased. Tonic activity showed the opposite tendency. As for the SDTD studies, the frequency of excitation seems to have an effect on the phasic and tonic components of the neck muscle activity. Phasic and tonic neck muscle activities represent different types of head motions. Because the content of phasic and tonic activities of the EMG signal seems to be linked with the effects of vibration exposure duration on discomfort, it was hypothesised that predicting the head motions may help estimating the comfort timedependency. A three degree-of-freedom lumped parameter model was developed to predict floor-to-head transmissibility. The model was then calibrated to estimate the head motions using the floor-to-head, seat-tohead, and seat transmissibility measured with 12 subjects, exposed to fore-and-aft sinusoidal, narrow-band random, and broad-band random vibration. Results showed that the model can estimate the head motions around the frequencies of resonances (mode shapes), but requires improvement to be accurate at the other frequencies. The estimated mode shapes showed three types of head motions: at 1. 4 Hz the head and neck moved in phase; at 3. 5 Hz, there was a resonance of the backrest and the head and neck moved in phase, but with a greater head motion than neck motion; and at 6. 9 Hz the head and neck moved out of phase. The subjective, physiological, and biodynamic studies suggest that the SDTD increases when the neck muscles attempt to control head motions by producing greater tonic, and less phasic, activity. The lumped parameter model identified through the mode shapes three types of head motions corresponding to different comfort time-dependencies. It was hypothesized that the phase and modulus of the seat-to-head transmissibility may indicate the amount of phasic and tonic activity produced. Through neck muscle activity, a model predicting seat-to-head transmissibility may also predict the time-dependency of discomfort. This thesis proposes a new method for determining the time-dependency of discomfort caused by whole-body vibration. Discomfort time-dependencies have been shown {{to depend on the}} frequency of vibration, direction of excitation, and body support. Mechanisms responsible for the discomfort time-dependency have been proposed. EThOS - Electronic Theses Online ServiceGBUnited Kingdo...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: The biodynamic {{responses}} to the human body give an understanding of why human {{responses to}} vibration (changes in health, comfort, and performance) vary with the frequency and direction of vibration. Studies have shown that biodynamic responses also vary with the magnitude of vibration and that the backrests of seats influence the transmission of vibration to the seated human body. There has been little study of the nonlinearity in the biodynamic responses {{of the body to}} dual-axis excitation and no study of the influence of backrests during dual-axis excitation. This study investigated the apparent mass and cross-axis apparent mass of the human body exposed to random vibration (0. 2 to 20 Hz) in all 15 possible combinations of four magnitudes (0, 0. 25, 0. 5 and 1. 0 ms – 2 r. m. s.) of <b>fore-and-aft</b> <b>vibration</b> and the same four magnitudes of vertical vibration. Nonlinearity was evident, with the body softening with increasing magnitude of vibration when using a fixed magnitude of vibration in one direction and varying the magnitude of vibration in the other direction. The fore-and-aft apparent mass on the seat was greater without a backrest at the lower frequencies but greater with a backrest at the higher frequencies. The vertical apparent mass on the seat was decreased by the backrest at low frequencies. Cross-axis coupling was evident, with excitation in one axis producing a response in the other axis.

40|$|The {{vibration}} in 100 different vehicles {{has been}} measured, evaluated and assessed according to British Standard BS 6841 (1987) and International Standard ISO 2631 (1997). Vibration {{was measured in}} 14 categories of vehicle including cars, lift trucks, tractors, lorries, vans and buses. In each vehicle, the vibration was measured in five axes: vertical vibration beneath the seat, fore-and-aft, lateral and vertical vibration on the seat pan and <b>fore-and-aft</b> <b>vibration</b> at the backrest. The alternative methods of evaluating the vibration (use of different frequency weightings, different averaging methods, the inclusion of different axes, vibration dose values and equivalent r. m. s. acceleration) as defined in the standards have been compared. BS 6841 (1987) suggests that an equivalent acceleration magnitude is calculated using vibration measured at four locations around the seat (x -, y -, z -seat and x -backrest); ISO 2631 (1997) suggests that vibration is measured in the three translational axes only on the seat pan but only the axis with the most severe vibration is used to assess vibration severity. Assessments made using the procedure defined in ISO 2631 tend to underestimate any risks from exposure to whole-body vibration compared to an evaluation made using the guidelines specified in BS 6841; the measurements indicated that the 17 m/s 1. 75 "health guidance caution zone" in ISO 2631 was {{less likely to be}} exceeded than the 15 m/s 1. 75 "action level" in BS 6841.

40|$|The {{transmissibility}} of a seat {{depends on}} the dynamic response {{of the human body}} (which varies between individuals, body locations, and vibration magnitudes) and the dynamic response of the seat (which varies according to seat design). In the fore-and-aft direction, the transmissibility of a seat backrest was therefore expected to vary with vertical position on the backrest. This experimental study with 12 subjects investigated how backrest transmissibility varied with both the vertical measurement position and the magnitude of vibration. The transmissibilities of the backrest of a car seat and a block of solid foam were measured at five heights above the seat surface with random <b>fore-and-aft</b> <b>vibration</b> at five magnitudes (0. 1, 0. 2, 0. 4, 0. 8 and 1. 6 ms? 2 rms) over the range 0. 25 – 20 Hz. The median transmissibilities exhibited resonances in the range 4 – 5 Hz for the car seat and in the range 3 – 6 Hz for the foam. The backrests showed clear changes in transmissibility with vertical position, but there were minimal changes in the resonance frequencies. For both backrests, the transmissibilities were greatest at the middle of the backrest. The least transmissibility was measured {{at the top of the}} car seat but at the bottom of the foam backrest. At each measurement position on both backrests, the transmissibility was non-linear with vibration magnitude: the resonance frequencies and transmissibilities at resonance decreased with increasing vibration magnitude. The variations in backrest transmissibility with vertical position and with vibration magnitude were sufficiently great to affect assessments of backrest dynamic performance. The results suggest that the fore-and-aft transmissibilities of backrests should be evaluated from more than one measurement locatio...|$|E

40|$|Occupational {{exposures}} to vibration always involve multi-axis vibration. Since human responses to vibration are highly nonlinear and cross-coupled, {{it is to}} be expected that excitation in one axis will alter response to vibration in another axis. The {{purpose of this study was}} to investigate nonlinearity in the apparent masses of subjects seated without a backrest and exposed to single-axis and dual-axis vertical and fore-and-aft excitation. The driving point apparent masses and cross-axis apparent masses in the two translational directions were measured with twelve subjects exposed to random vibration (0. 2 to 20 Hz) in all 15 possible combinations of four vibration magnitudes (0, 0. 25, 0. 5, or 1. 0 ms– 2 r. m. s.) in the fore-and-aft and vertical directions. With single-axis excitation (either fore-and-aft or vertical), the median in-line apparent mass exhibited a nonlinear characteristic in which the body softened with increasing magnitude of vibration. With dual-axis excitation, at all magnitudes of vertical excitation the resonance frequency in the vertical apparent mass reduced as the magnitude of <b>fore-and-aft</b> <b>vibration</b> increased, and at all except the greatest magnitude of fore-andaft excitation the resonance frequency in the fore-and-aft apparent mass reduced as the magnitude of vertical vibration increased. The coherency between the fore-and-aft acceleration and the fore-and-aft force was lowered by the addition of vertical excitation, and the coherency between the vertical acceleration and the vertical force was lowered by the addition of fore-and-aft excitation. The nonlinearity evident in both in-line apparent masses was also evident in the crossaxis apparent masses. It is concluded that with dual-axis excitation the fore-and-aft and vertical response of the seated human body is nonlinear, with resonance frequencies decreasing with increasing magnitude of vibration. Consequently, vibration in one axis (either fore-and-aft or vertical) affects the apparent mass of the body measured in the other axis (either vertical or fore-and-aft) ...|$|E
40|$|When {{standing}} and exposed to vibration in trains, {{passengers and crew}} may seek support by leaning on a surface or holding a bar or a handle that alters the transmission of vibration to their bodies. The effects of such contact on the discomfort caused by vibration have not been previously investigated. This {{study was designed to}} investigate the effects of postural supports on the discomfort caused by fore-and-aft and lateral whole-body vibration in the frequency range 0. 5 — 16 Hz. Using the method of magnitude estimation, 12 standing male subjects judged the discomfort caused by five magnitudes of sinusoidal vibration at six frequencies (0. 5, 1. 0, 2. 0, 4. 0, 8. 0, and 16 Hz) and in two directions (fore-and-aft or lateral) while using four different postural supports: no support, holding a vertical bar, leaning with back support, and leaning with shoulder support. Equivalent comfort contours were constructed, showing how discomfort depends on the vibration frequency over a range of vibration magnitudes with each support. Compared to standing with no support, holding a vertical bar had only a minor effect on the discomfort caused by either fore-and-aft or lateral vibration. At frequencies greater than about 2 Hz, leaning backwards against a back support increased the discomfort caused by <b>fore-and-aft</b> <b>vibration</b> and leaning sideways against a shoulder support increased discomfort caused by lateral vibration. Frequency weightings derived from the equivalent comfort contours show that the weightings suggested in current standards do not provide good predictions of the frequency dependence of discomfort caused by vibration when standing without any support or when supported and holding only a bar. It is concluded that leaning, with the back or shoulder supported, increases the discomfort caused by vibration in a direction normal to the body surface at frequencies greater than about 2 Hz. Currently, standardized frequency weightings do not provide good predictions of the discomfort caused by horizontal vibration when standing without holding a support...|$|E
40|$|Seated {{subjects}} {{have participated}} in two experiments with fore-and-aft whole-body vibration to investigate dynamic responses at the seat and footrest {{in the direction of}} vibration and in other directions. In the first experiment, 12 males were exposed to fore-and-aft random vibration (0. 25 – 20 Hz) at four magnitudes (0. 125, 0. 25, 0. 625, and 1. 25 m s? 2 rms) while sitting on a seat with no backrest in four postures with varying foot heights to produce differing thigh contact with the seat (feet hanging, feet supported with maximum thigh contact, feet supported with average thigh contact, and feet supported with minimum thigh contact). In the second experiment, six subjects were exposed to three vibration magnitudes (0. 125, 0. 25, 0. 625 m s? 2 rms) in the average thigh contact posture, both with and without a rigid backrest. Forces were measured in the vertical, fore-and-aft, and lateral directions on the supporting seat surface (in the first experiment) and in the fore-and-aft and vertical directions at the footrest (in the second experiment). On the seat, there were three vibration modes in the fore-and-aft apparent mass on the seat at frequencies below 10 Hz in all postures (around 1 Hz, between 1 and 3 Hz, and between 3 and 5 Hz); large vertical forces were dependent on foot support while lateral forces were relatively small. At the feet, the fore-and-aft apparent mass showed a resonance between 3 and 5 Hz, which increased in frequency and magnitude when a backrest was used. The <b>fore-and-aft</b> <b>vibration</b> produced high vertical forces at the footrest. At frequencies below resonance, the backrest reduced vertical and fore-and-aft forces at the footrest. On the seat and the footrest, the forces showed a nonlinear characteristic that varied between postures. The presence of appreciable vertical forces indicate that during fore-and-aft excitation the body moved in two dimensions. It is concluded that forces in directions other than the direction of excitation should be taken into account when considering biodynamic responses to fore-and-aft whole-body vibration...|$|E
40|$|The {{transmission}} of vibration to people through seats was studied {{with the final}} objective {{of being able to}} predict the dynamic performance of seats. It was necessary to investigate both the dynamic response and the subjective response of a person sitting on a seat, in addition to the dynamic response of the seat itself. Initial experiments were conducted to investigate the effect of variables, such as the magnitude of the vibration and the posture of the body, on the {{transmission of}} vibration through a seat. Seat transmissibilities measured in a laboratory with vertical-only vibration were shown to be similar to those measured in a vehicle with multiple vibration. Frequency response functions were determined for the transmission of multiple axis translational vehicle vibration to the cushion and the backrest of a seat. The apparent mass of the seated body was measured as a pre-requisite for the prediction of seat transmissibilities. It was found that the resonance frequency of the body decreased when the magnitude of the vibration was increased. Increased muscle tension tended to have the opposite effect. The apparent masses of sixty people - men, women and children - were very similar once they were normalised to remove the effect of the different static weights on the seat. Some correlations with the body characteristics were significant - such as that between the normalised apparent mass at resonance and total body mass. A method of measuring the dynamic stiffness of a seat using a rigid indenter instead of a person to load the seat was developed. The results, in conjunction with measurements of the apparent mass of the body, were used to predict seat transmissibilities. Predicted seat transmissibilities were shown to be similar to transmissibilities that were measured with a person sitting on the seat. It was investigated how the weight of a person and the magnitude of the vibration could affect predicted seat transmissibilities. The discomfort caused by vibration transmitted to a seated person was measured using a novel method of adjustment. It was investigated whether the discomfort caused by simultaneous vertical and <b>fore-and-aft</b> <b>vibration</b> could be predicted from the discomfort that would have been caused if the vibration in each axis had occurred separately. A root-sum-square summation procedure was found to be the best...|$|E
40|$|The {{vibration}} of backrests {{contributes to}} the discomfort of drivers and passengers. A frequency weighting exists for evaluating the vibration of vertical backrests but not for reclined backrests often used during travel. This experimental {{study was designed to}} determine how backrest inclination and the frequency of vibration influence perception thresholds and vibration discomfort when the vibration is applied normal to the back (i. e. <b>fore-and-aft</b> <b>vibration</b> when seated upright and vertical vibration when fully reclined). Twelve subjects experienced the vibration of a backrest (at each of the 11 preferred one-third octave centre frequencies in the range 2. 5 – 25 Hz) at vibration magnitudes from the threshold of perception to 24 dB above threshold. Initially, absolute thresholds for the perception of vibration were determined with four backrest inclinations: 0 ° (upright), 30 °, 60 ° and 90 ° (recumbent). The method of magnitude estimation was then used to obtain judgements of vibration discomfort with each of the four backrest angles. Finally, the relative discomfort between the four backrest angles, and the principal locations for feeling vibration discomfort in the body, were determined. With all backrest inclinations, absolute thresholds for the perception of vibration acceleration were dependent on the frequency of vibration. As the backrest inclination became more horizontal, the thresholds increased at frequencies between 4 and 8 Hz. For all backrest inclinations, the rate of growth of discomfort with increasing magnitude of vibration was independent of the frequency of vibration, so the frequency-dependence of discomfort was similar over the range of magnitudes investigated (0. 04 – 0. 6 m s? 2 rms). With an upright backrest, the discomfort caused by vibration acceleration tended to be greatest at frequencies less than about 8 Hz. With inclined backrests (at 30 °, 60 °, and 90 °), the equivalent comfort contours were broadly similar to each other, with greatest discomfort caused by acceleration around 10 or 12. 5 Hz. At frequencies from 4 to 8 Hz, 30 – 40 percent greater magnitudes of vibration were required with the three inclined backrests to cause discomfort equivalent to that caused by the upright backrest. It is concluded that with an upright backrest the frequency weighting Wc used in current standards is appropriate for predicting the discomfort caused by fore-and-aft backrest vibration. With inclined and horizontal backrests, a weighting similar to frequency weighting Wb (used to predict discomfort caused by vertical seat vibration) appears more appropriate...|$|E
40|$|It has {{previously}} been assumed that the vibration discomfort of standing people can be estimated using the same procedures developed from for seated people. In this thesis, the discomfort of standing people exposed to vibration was investigated to improve understanding of the mechanisms responsible for discomfort and construct a model {{that may be used}} to predict the discomfort of standing railway passengers. The first of five experiments using the method of magnitude estimation and 6 -s periods of vibration investigated how the discomfort of standing subjects exposed to fore-and-aft, lateral, and vertical sinusoidal vibration depends on the frequency of vibration. From the judgements of 12 subjects at each of the 16 preferred one-third octave centre frequencies from 0. 5 to 16 Hz, frequency weightings were constructed for each direction. For vertical vibration, the weighting was similar to that recommended in standards, but the weightings for fore-and-aft and lateral vibration differed from that previously assumed. Horizontal vibration caused loss of balance at frequencies less than about 3 Hz, and it caused discomfort in the legs at higher frequencies. Vertical vibration caused discomfort in the upper body. To adjust the frequency weightings according to differences in sensitivity between directions, the second experiment with 12 subjects compared the discomfort caused by 4 -Hz sinusoidal vibration in the fore-and-aft, lateral, the vertical directions. It was found that sensitivity was greater for <b>fore-and-aft</b> <b>vibration</b> than lateral vibration at frequencies less than 4 Hz and weightings were determined to assist the evaluation vibration in all three directions. The third experiment investigated the extent to which postural supports used by standing train passengers (vertical bar, shoulder support, and back support) affect discomfort caused by fore-and-aft and lateral vibration in the range 0. 5 to 16 Hz. Supports that created a new path for the transmission of vibration to the upper-body increased discomfort over the range 4 to 16 Hz. The fourth experiment investigated how the root-mean-square method, the basic evaluation method in current standards but known to underestimate the discomfort caused by motions containing occasional peaks, could be modified for the evaluation of non-sinusoidal vibration. Using 1 -Hz and 8 -Hz random vibrations with a range of crest factors {{it was found that the}} discomfort of standing subjects was better predicted with an exponent around 3, rather than an exponent of 2 implicit in r. m. s. averaging. The final experiment determined a method for predicting the discomfort of tri-axial vibration. The cube root of the sum of the cubes of the discomfort caused by the single-axis components gave good estimates of the total discomfort for both 1 -Hz and 4 -Hz tri-axial vibration. Since it was found in the first experiment that the discomfort was generally proportional to the acceleration at the power 0. 7. these results suggest that the root-sum-of-squares of the accelerations gives good estimates of the total discomfort for tri-axial vibration. The results of all experiments were combined in an empirical model for predicting the discomfort of standing people exposed to 6 -s periods of vibration. It is concluded that there are two distinctly different mechanisms responsible for vibration discomfort when standing: postural instability and body vibration. Postural instability is dominant with horizontal vibration at frequencies less than about 3 Hz, whereas body vibration is dominant with vertical vibration and with horizontal vibration at frequencies greater than about 3 Hz. The discomfort of standing people is similar to the discomfort of seated people for vertical vibration, but fundamentally different with horizontal vibration due to postural instability at low frequencies and vibration attenuation in the legs at higher frequencie...|$|E
40|$|The {{transmissibility}} of a seat {{depends on}} the dynamics of both the seat and the human body. Previous {{studies show that the}} apparent mass of the body, to which much attention has been paid, has a large influence on the vibration transmissibility of a seat. The influence of the seat dynamics on the seat transmissibility has received less systematic attention. The principal objective {{of this study was to}} develop a systematic methodology using finite element methods to model the dynamic interaction between a seat and the human body so as to predict the seat transmissibility. The purpose was to understand how the foam material, the seat structure, and the seat occupant influence the vibration transmitted through seats. The effect of the foam thickness at the seat cushion and the backrest on the transmissibility was investigated experimentally in the laboratory with a SAE J 826 manikin and with 12 subjects during exposure to 60 -s periods of fore-and-aft and vertical vibration, respectively, in the frequency range 0. 5 to 20 Hz at 0. 8 ms- 2 r. m. s [...] Increasing the thickness of the foam at the seat cushion decreased the resonance frequency of both the vertical vibration transmitted to the seat cushion and the <b>fore-and-aft</b> <b>vibration</b> transmitted to the backrest, while there was little effect of the foam thickness at the backrest. It appears that the foam at the seat cushion had a predominant effect on the transmission of the vibration. Load-deflection curves were measured at various points across the lateral and fore-and-aft centrelines of a car seat with three different loading rates: 0. 5, 1. 0 and 2. 0 mm/s. The dynamic stiffness of the seat cushion and backrest was measured with 120 -s broadband random vibration (1. 5 to 15 Hz) with three static preloads and with three vibration magnitudes (0. 25, 0. 5, and 1. 0 ms- 2 r. m. s.). With the same deformation, the reaction force was greater during loading than during unloading, showing evidence of hysteresis. The stiffness increased with increasing preload force and tended to decrease with increasing magnitude of vibration, indicating the seat components were nonlinear. The dynamic stiffness was also found to be greater when the seat cushion was constrained with a leather cover than without a leather cover. The transmission of vibration from the seat base to six different positions on a car seat was investigated experimentally in the laboratory with a SAE J 826 manikin and with 12 subjects exposed to 120 -s periods of random vibration (0. 5 to 40 Hz) at three magnitudes (0. 4, 0. 8, and 1. 2 ms- 2 r. m. s.) in the fore-and-aft and vertical directions, respectively. The transmissibility from the seat base to the seat cushion surface and frame, to the backrest surface and frame, and to the headrest surface and frame exhibited a peak around 4 - 5 Hz in the fore-and-aft and vertical directions, respectively. The principal resonance frequency in the transmissibilities to all locations decreased with increasing magnitude of vibration, indicating nonlinearity in the seat-occupant system. There was little effect of the seat track position on the measured seat transmissibilities. The transmissibilities with subjects and with the manikin were different. Based on the experimental studies, models of the seat cushion and the backrest assemblies were built up and calibrated separately using the measured load-deflection curves and dynamic stiffnesses. They were joined to form a complete seat model and integrated with the model of a manikin for further calibration with measured seat transmissibility. The calibrated seat model was combined with a re-calibrated existing human body model to predict the transmissibility of the seat. It was found that by combining a calibrated seat model with a calibrated human body model, and defining appropriate contacts between the two models, the vertical vibration transmissibility of a seat with an occupant can be predicted. The developed seat-occupant model could be further improved to predict fore-and-aft seat transmissibility to the backrest and the dynamic pressure distributions at the interfaces between the human body and the seat...|$|E
40|$|The {{apparent}} {{mass of the}} seated human body and the transmissibility to the upper-body (i. e., the spine and the pelvis) during vertical vibration excitation {{have been reported to}} have resonance frequencies around 5 Hz. With fore-and-aft excitation the {{apparent mass}} shows a first peak around 1 Hz and second mode around 2 to 3 Hz. Little is known about how the motion of the upper-body during excitation in one direction is affected by the addition of vibration in an orthogonal direction (i. e., the cross-axis coupling). The principal objective of the research reported in this thesis was to identify how the resonances in the apparent mass and transmissibility, and their association, depends on the magnitude of the inline vibration excitation and the addition of an orthogonal vibration excitation. The research was also designed to investigate the characteristics necessary in mathematical models that represent the cross-axis coupling and nonlinearity evident in the biodynamic responses of the human body. The movement of the body (over the first, fifth and twelfth thoracic vertebrae, the third lumbar vertebra, and the pelvis) in the fore-and-aft and vertical directions (and in pitch at the pelvis) was measured in 12 seated male subjects during random vertical vibration excitation (over the range 0. 25 to 20 Hz) at three vibration magnitudes (0. 25, 0. 5 and 1. 0 ms- 2 r. m. s.) and during <b>fore-and-aft</b> <b>vibration</b> excitation over the same frequency range and at the same three vibration magnitudes. At the highest magnitude of vertical excitation the effect of adding fore-aft excitation (at 0. 25, 0. 5, and 1. 0 ms- 2 r. m. s.) was investigated. Similarly, at the highest magnitude of fore-and-aft excitation the effect of adding vertical vibration (at 0. 25, 0. 5, and 1. 0 ms- 2 r. m. s.) was investigated. The forces in the fore-and-aft and vertical directions on the seat surface were also measured so as to calculate apparent masses. The subjects adopted a normal upright posture, an erect posture, and a slouched posture. Resonance frequencies in the apparent mass and transmissibility during vertical excitation decreased with increasing magnitude of vertical excitation and with the addition of fore-and-aft excitation. The modulus of the first peak in the apparent mass and transmissibility during fore-and-aft excitation decreased with increasing magnitude of fore-and-aft excitation and with the addition of vertical excitation. Complex vibration modes in the upper-body appear to be responsible for the resonances in both the vertical and the fore-and-aft apparent masses. Compared to the normal upright posture, the erect posture tended to increase the resonance frequency in the apparent mass and transmissibility associated with vertical excitation but decrease the resonance frequency in the apparent mass and transmissibility associated with fore-and-aft excitation. The association between resonances in the transmissibility to the upper body and the resonance in the apparent mass varied with vertical excitation but not with fore-aft excitation. A seven degree-of-freedom multi-body model indicated that the resonance frequency in the vertical apparent mass on the seat and the vertical transmissibility to the upper-body with either vertical or dual-axis excitation is sensitive to the vertical stiffness of tissues beneath the pelvis and closely related to the vertical motion of the upper body. It has also been shown that the first mode of the fore-and-aft apparent mass and the fore-and-aft transmissibility {{can be attributed to the}} fore-and-aft movement of the upper-body due to the pelvis pitch, while the second mode can be attributed to the fore-and-aft movement of the upper-body caused by shear deformation of the pelvis tissue. It is suggested that a mathematical model developed with single-axis excitation can represent the biodynamic response with dual-axis excitation by changing these sensitive parameters (e. g., the stiffness of the tissue beneath the pelvis). A finite element human body model with flexible bodies representing the tissue beneath the pelvis and thighs and rigid bodies representing other body segments provided sensible prediction of the first resonance frequencies and the associated modulus in the vertical inline and fore-and-aft cross-axis apparent mass on the seat and the transmissibility to the lumbar spine, as well as the pressure distribution on the seat surface. With the flexible bodies assigned the material properties of nonlinear low density foam, the model was allowed to reflect the softening effect (i. e., a reduce in the resonance frequency of the vertical apparent mass) when the when the magnitude of the vertical excitation was increased.
