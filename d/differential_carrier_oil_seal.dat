When one-tenth the label dosage of “inert” <b>carrier</b> <b>oil</b> alone was combined with neonicotinoids clothianidin, imidacloprid, and dinotefuran applied in 1 ml water, there were also significant increases with clothianidin and dinotefuran (38 and 24 % respectively) in weevil mortality over the neonicotinoids alone 1 d after treatment.

40|$|LecturePg. 41 - 50 The {{cause and}} effects of a large subsynchronous {{vibration}} (3. 5 mils at 3490 cpm) in an FCC wet gas compressor are examined. The compressor is driven at 7850 rpm by a 6000 hp electric motor, through a speed-increasing gearbox, and compresses hydrocarbon gases from 20 psig to 235 psig. A rotordynarnic analysis of the compressor determined {{that even though the}} compressor had a long history (approximately 25 years) of smooth operation (overall amplitudes less than 0. 5 mils), it had a very low margin of stability. This lack of stability was caused by a high bearing to shaft stiffness ratio as well as destabilizing forces in the balance piston and shaft seals. The pressure dam bearing design is not destabilizing to the rotor system because the journal is very heavily loaded; however, the high direct stiffness that is produced reduces the effective damping of the system. Labyrinth and <b>oil</b> <b>seals</b> are usually not considered to have large effects on a compressor with such low pressures. However, the atmospheric side of the <b>oil</b> <b>seal</b> was determined to contribute the largest destabilizing effect. The effective length to diameter (LID) ratio of the <b>oil</b> <b>seal</b> was reduced by 50 percent to lower the amount of cross-coupled stiffness the seal produces. This modification reduced the subsynchronous vibration from 3. 5 mils to 0. 1 mils. The rotordynarnic analysis also identified other modifications to the bearing and balance piston design that should be made to increase the rotor's margin of stability. Both steady-state and transient spectral vibration data are provided before and after the <b>oil</b> <b>seal</b> modification to validate the rotordynarnic model of the compressor...|$|R
40|$|In Squeeze Film Dampers, (SFD), grooves (deep or shallow) {{are used}} to feed oil into the damper and prevent oil {{starvation}} within the fluid film lands. In <b>oil</b> <b>seals</b> with film land of clearance c, short shallow grooves (depth ? 15 c, length ? 30 c) are machined to reduce the cross-coupled stiffness coefficients, and thus improve the seal stability characteristics. Moreover, test stands for these devices can also incorporate grooves or recesses as part of oil feeding/ discharge arrangements. A common assumption is that these grooves do not influence the test system forced response. However, unexpected large added mass coefficients are reported in these configurations and not adequately predicted. In the case of grooved <b>oil</b> <b>seals,</b> experimental results also show that circumferential grooves do aid to reduce cross-coupled force coefficients but {{to a lesser extent}} than predictions otherwise indicate. A linear fluid inertia model for analysis of multiple-groove SFD or <b>oil</b> <b>seal</b> configurations is advanced. A perturbation analysis for small motion about a journal centered and off-centered position yields zeroth and first order flow equations defined at each individual flow region (land and grooves) of constant clearance (c). The analysis considers both the circumferential and axial dynamic pressure variations across the groove and land regions. At the groove regions, an effective groove depth (d?) and effective clearance (c d c ? ? = +) are defined based on qualitative observations of the laminar flow pattern through annular cavities. This depth differs from the actual physical groove depth. The boundary conditions at the inlet and exit plane are a function of the geometric configuration. Integration of the resulting dynamic pressure fields on the journal surface yields the force coefficients (stiffness, damping, and inertia). Comparisons between predicted and experimental force coefficients for a grooved <b>oil</b> <b>seal</b> and a SFD show excellent correlation over a narrow range of effective groove depths. The results confirm that large added mass coefficients are associated to the feed/discharge grooves in the scrutinized test configurations. Furthermore, predictions, benchmarking experimental data, corroborate that short inner land grooves in an <b>oil</b> <b>seal</b> do not isolate the pressure field of the adjacent film lands, and hence contribute greatly to the force response of the seal...|$|R
30|$|In a servo cylinder, the radial {{component}} of a partial load on the piston rod causes {{the front end of}} the piston rod to deflect downward relative to the center of mass. This breaks the <b>oil</b> <b>seal</b> between the support oil pad and counter oil pad, and changes the piston rod gap, which affects the pressure in the oil chamber of each oil pad. When the radial force increases, based on the centroid location, the gap between the <b>oil</b> <b>seal</b> edges of the piston rod bearing oil cushion and counter oil cushion decreases with increasing deflection of the piston rod. Because the system has a constant-pressure oil supply, under the joint action of hole damping and <b>oil</b> edge <b>sealing,</b> the <b>oil</b> chamber experiences a pressing force. This causes the oil pressure in the upper and lower oil pads of the piston rod to increase, resulting in a larger reaction force. This increased force counteracts the radial force of the eccentric load to balance the partial load. As the movement of the piston rod changes during operation, the radial force generated by the eccentric load also changes dynamically. The gap between the piston rod and <b>oil</b> <b>seal</b> changes correspondingly under the effects of fluid-solid coupling. The pressure in the oil chambers in the upper and lower oil pads then makes the necessary adjustments so the piston rod can be adaptively aligned in the guide sleeve.|$|R

40|$|Emulsion-based {{delivery}} systems offer many potential benefits for incorporating omega- 3 oils into foods and beverages. Nanoemulsions are emulsion-based {{delivery systems}} that are gaining popularity because of their ease of preparation, small particle size, relatively high stability, high bioavailability, and production of optically transparent emulsions. Fish oil (FO) nanoemulsions are potentially more susceptible to lipid oxidation because of their high degree of lipid unsaturation, high surface area of exposed lipids, and greater light penetration. In the first study, spontaneous emulsification, a low-energy method, was used to fabricate FO nanoemulsions. The influence of surfactant-to-oil-ratio (SOR) on particle size, turbidity, and physical stability was evaluated. Furthermore, the oxidative stability of these nanoemulsions was compared to emulsions produced by microfluidizer, a high-energy method. The effect of particle size and SOR on oxidation was monitored by measuring lipid hydroperoxides and thiobarbituric acid reactive substances (TBARS). Optically transparent nanoemulsions were formed and maintained physical stability after being held at 37 °C for 14 days. FO nanoemulsions produced by high- and low-energy methods had similar oxidative stabilities at 55 °C for 14 days. These results demonstrate that spontaneous emulsification can produce fish oil nanoemulsion that are physically stable and oxidize at similar rates as traditionally prepared nanoemulsions, and are therefore potentially suitable for fortification of clear food systems. Additionally, <b>carrier</b> <b>oils</b> can also impact the physical and oxidative stability of FO nanoemulsions. Medium chain triglycerides, lemon oil, and thyme oil were chosen as <b>carrier</b> <b>oils</b> and added to the oil phase at different ratios of FO to <b>carrier</b> <b>oil</b> for emulsions produced by the microfluidizer. Medium chain triglycerides and lemon oil produced stable FO nanoemulsions but the thyme oil only produced stable FO nanoemulsions at lower concentrations of <b>carrier</b> <b>oil.</b> On the other hand, at FO to <b>carrier</b> <b>oil</b> ratios of 75 / 25, lemon oil and thyme oil nanoemulsions had high oxidative stability because of natural of their antioxidants. These findings suggest that lemon oil and thyme oil can produce FO nanoemulsions that are physically and chemically stable {{and can be used}} for food system fortification...|$|R
