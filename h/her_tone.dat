25|$|Nonetheless, the limpid {{purity of}} <b>her</b> <b>tone</b> and the {{smoothness}} of her legato line remained uniquely impressive, compensating {{to some extent}} for the weakening of her breath control. The records also display a lively singing personality {{as well as a}} surprisingly strong chest voice and a mellow timbre. Her trill remains wonderfully fluent and accurate and her diction is excellent. Overall her discs have a charm and musicality that give us a hint of why, at her peak, she commanded $5,000 a night.|$|E
25|$|Belle {{finds her}} father and brings him back to their house in the village. After {{she is able to}} nurse him back to health, she {{explains}} the transformation she seems to have gone through while she was with the Beast ("A Change in Me"). A mob arrives, led by Gaston to take Maurice to the asylum. Belle proves her father's sanity by showing the townspeople the Beast is real using the Magic Mirror, but doesn't realize the error in her gesture. The townspeople immediately fear the Beast, but Belle insists he's gentle and kind. Gaston catches <b>her</b> <b>tone</b> and recognizes the Beast as his rival for Belle's affections and organizes the mob to kill the Beast ("Mob Song"). In order to warn the Beast, Belle and Maurice decide to beat the mob to the castle. However, Gaston and the mob had already reached the castle before Belle and Maurice did.|$|E
500|$|M. Daphne Kutzer, Professor of English at State University of New York at Plattsburgh {{and author}} of Beatrix Potter: Writing in Code, observes that the social {{positions}} of Jeremy and his friends are established through the clothing they wear. [...] Although Potter sharply critiqued the upper class elsewhere, Kutzer observes that in Jeremy Fisher <b>her</b> <b>tone</b> is more moderate. She suggests that Potter's relocation to Sawrey and Hill Top Farm may have produced in her a willingness [...] "to accept the silliness of the aspiring middle class {{as well as the}} eccentricities of the upper classes".|$|E

6000|$|... "Why, Jeff," [...] she said, with {{pleasure}} in <b>her</b> <b>tones.</b> [...] "I am {{so glad to}} see you. I have been wondering why you had not come before." ...|$|R
6000|$|<b>Her</b> <b>tones</b> were cold, but the coldness I {{knew was}} forced--else {{had she not}} said [...] "we harass ourselves." [...] Instead of quelling my ardour, it gave it fuel.|$|R
500|$|The {{audiobook}} adaption of When You Reach Me {{was released}} by Listening Library and contains four disks. In praise of Cynthia Holloway's performance of Miranda, M.V.P from Horn Book Magazine stated that <b>her</b> <b>tone</b> [...] "emphasized the novel's interpersonal aspects". The reviewer found it beneficial that the chapter titles {{were added to the}} audio, since they seemed to add more detail about the book, but can be easily skipped over when reading. M.V.P criticized the voicing of Miranda's mom. AudioFile praised Halloway for [...] "a strong reading... makes listeners curious about this story's nonlinear structure" [...] and for managing the different elements of the story.|$|E
500|$|Jody Rosen {{highlights}} <b>her</b> <b>tone</b> and timbre {{as particularly}} distinctive, describing her voice as [...] "one {{of the most}} compelling instruments in popular music". Her vocal abilities mean she is identified {{as the centerpiece of}} Destiny's Child. Jon Pareles of The New York Times commented that her voice is [...] "velvety yet tart, with an insistent flutter and reserves of soul belting". Rosen notes that the hip hop era highly influenced Beyoncé's unique rhythmic vocal style, but also finds her quite traditionalist in her use of balladry, gospel and falsetto. Other critics praise her range and power, with Chris Richards of The Washington Post saying she was [...] "capable of punctuating any beat with goose-bump-inducing whispers or full-bore diva-roars." ...|$|E
500|$|In general, the First Lady's {{desire for}} {{everything}} to appear just {{right in the}} White House led the residence staff to consider her not easy to work for, with tirades following what she perceived as mistakes. One staffer later recalled, [...] "I remember hearing her call for her personal maid one day and it scared the dickens out of me—just <b>her</b> <b>tone.</b> I {{never wanted to be}} {{on the wrong side of}} her." [...] She did show loyalty and respect to a number of the staff. In particular, she came to the public defense of a maid who was indicted on charges of helping to smuggle ammunition to Paraguay, providing an affidavit to the maid's good character (even though it was politically inopportune to do so at the time of the Iran–Contra affair); charges were subsequently dropped, and the maid returned to work at the White House.|$|E

6000|$|... "What made you?--bad boy!" [...] said M'liss, with {{a sudden}} respect of conventionalities, and a rare touch of {{tenderness}} in <b>her</b> <b>tones.</b> [...] "You'd better go back where your vittals are." ...|$|R
60|$|There was {{something}} diabolically sweet in <b>her</b> <b>tones,</b> {{something of the}} tinkling of glass when struck, which rang through the brains even of us who heard the words addressed to another.|$|R
500|$|According to {{reviewer}} Heid Erdrich, Mom & Me & Mom {{does not}} center on Angelou's childhood trauma, {{as described in}} Caged Bird, but [...] "rather constructs a portrait of self via details of her relationship to the mother who abandoned her and with whom she reunited as a teenager". [...] Erdrich states that Angelou's prose is [...] "very simply written", and calls <b>her</b> <b>tone</b> [...] "mostly light, even sweet, filled with affection for her younger self". [...] Erdrich states that even though {{it could have been}} written for young women experiencing the same difficulties Angelou faced, the book does not preach, but [...] "presents Angelou’s life path scattered with enormous obstacles endured and conquered through knowledge of self and a singular brand of mother love". [...] Publishers Weekly agrees, stating, [...] "The lessons and love presented here will speak to those trying to make their way in the world". [...] Erdrich also states that Angelou's narrative of her [...] "hard-won love for her extraordinary mother" [...] is compelling, and that Angelou portrays Baxter [...] "as extraordinarily self-aware, liberated from what others might think, and independent beyond any feminist of her era" [...] and [...] "the stuff of fiction but real and responsible in unexpected ways for the gift of her talented daughter".|$|E
500|$|Before {{the senior}} dance, Tom invites his ex-wife Wendy (Jama Williamson) {{to his office}} to finally {{disclose}} his romantic feelings for her, but she rejects him. Not satisfied with the outcome, he attempts to blackmail her into a date using an alimony lawsuit as leverage. Tom and Wendy are later shown hugging and presumably making amends, although their conversation remains inaudible. Meanwhile, April's (Aubrey Plaza) boyfriend Derek (Blake Lee) and his boyfriend Ben (Josh Duvendeck) mock the senior citizens, causing April to question why their interactions must constantly be [...] "cloaked in like 15 layers of irony". They accuse her of [...] "lameness", which they attribute to spending time with Andy, and provide her with several ultimatums. She breaks up with them in response. Ann (Rashida Jones) and Mark (Paul Schneider), at the same time, celebrate their first Valentine's Day together. In {{an interview with the}} camera crew, Ann describes the relationship as [...] "good", but <b>her</b> <b>tone</b> of voice and body language around Mark contradict her statements. She later becomes jealous when Andy dedicates a song to April, even {{going so far as to}} question April about the possibility of a budding relationship between April and Andy, to which April responds impatiently.|$|E
500|$|Bryant's {{star power}} and her extreme views were {{highlighted}} in national news stories. Mainstream news outlets such as The New York Times, Associated Press and Washington Post reported weekly updates on campaign progress, with smaller local newspapers {{across the country}} weighing in their editorial opinions on which side should prevail. Bryant appeared on Good Morning America and The Phil Donahue Show. <b>Her</b> <b>tone</b> and accusations united {{gay men and lesbians}} in cities all over the U.S. In the weeks before the vote, almost $55,000 was raised outside of Florida to oppose Save Our Children. Foreshadowing the effectiveness of the Save Our Children campaign, on April 13, 1977, the Florida Legislature voted not to ratify the Equal Rights Amendment (ERA), to the astonishment of those anticipating the vote. The connection between the ERA and ordinance 77-4 was obvious to many. Florida Senator Dempsey Barron vocally opposed passing the ERA, fearing it would legalize same-sex marriages, force people to use unisex bathrooms, and that it would harm laws meant to protect families. National Organization for Women founder and ERA proponent Betty Friedan expressed her disdain, saying [...] "suddenly you have this red herring in Anita Bryant. Suddenly you have this wave of anti-gay hysteria and then that was preempting the air waves behind the scenes".|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{could do}} it again," [...] communed my aunt to herself. There was a {{suggestion}} of vindictiveness in <b>her</b> <b>tones.</b> [...] "It's easy enough. Look at the sort of fools that are agreeable." ...|$|R

2500|$|Melodically, [...] "Don't Hold Your Breath" [...] {{consists}} of an up-tempo common time signature of 112 beats per minute. It uses a simple three-note chord progression of D–Fm–E. The style of the production and arrangement were compared to songs by Gloria Gaynor, according to Robert Copsey from Digital Spy. Lyrically, the song's theme and content was described as [...] "Scherzinger staving off an ex’s advances" [...] and {{making it clear that}} the relationship is officially over. As well as incorporating elements of club music, <b>her</b> <b>tone</b> is scornful on lines such as [...] "You can’t touch me now, there’s no feeling left/ If you think I’m comin’ back, don’t hold your breath/ What you did to me, boy I can’t forget".|$|E
2500|$|Fellow Australian celebrities have praised Arena's vocal prowess with Delta Goodrem saying, [...] "Her {{voice has}} {{strength}} whilst keeping its feminine warmth to draw you in." [...] Melbourne singer/songwriter, Michael Paynter hailed Arena as [...] "simultaneously {{the most natural}} and supernatural female Australian voice ever. She is technically and emotionally perfect, but somehow always has enough of a sniff of imperfection and rawness to make you not only believe every word, but be hanging off them too." [...] Ricki-Lee Coulter also says that [...] "She has so much control and power". Missy Higgins also commented that, [...] "Tina Arena {{is one of our}} best singers ever. She could sing the balls off anyone, and she's miniature." [...] Brian Mannix says, [...] "Tina Arena has a tasteful voice. She sells the lyrics with her big voice but never over-sings." [...] Birds of Tokyo frontman says, [...] "Tina Arena can sing the shit out of anything, and do it in four different languages!" [...] Anthony Callea added, [...] "Technically, she is faultless and <b>her</b> <b>tone</b> is unique and warm. I love that she goes against all the 'singers' rules' – I've seen what she eats and drinks before a gig!" [...] Darren Hayes also made an effort in letting the public know that Arena's voice is one of his favourite voices in Australia through Twitter.|$|E
2500|$|CNN's Larry Frum {{wrote that}} [...] "GLaDOS's voice is {{dripping}} with sarcasm and malice even as <b>her</b> <b>tone</b> remains soothing and calm". PC Mags Matthew Murray called her voice actor [...] "irreplaceable" [...] and called GLaDOS [...] "saucy and strangely sympathetic". The Daily Mails James O'Brien wrote that GLaDOS had [...] "some of the sharpest, funniest lines {{we will hear}} in any fictional form this year, not just video games". An editor for [...] CBS News wrote that [...] "the interactions between the player, GLaDOS and Wheatley are what give [...] "Portal 2" [...] its charm and provide much of the humor that keeps the game captivating puzzle after puzzle". The Globe and Mails Chad Sepieha listed the top five insults from GLaDOS in Portal 2, which included [...] "Science has now validated your birth mother’s decision to abandon you on a doorstep." [...] Rock Paper Shotgun's John Walker wrote that [...] "Ellen McLain returns as GLaDOS, and is pushed so much further this time, hitting every single line with perfection". Game Informers Adam Biessener wrote that while Portal 2 was less quotable than its predecessor, [...] "repeating GLaDOS lines stopped being funny a long time ago". He also wrote [...] "I never once thought I'd place GLaDOS second on any list of [...] "Portal" [...] characters, but J.K. Simmons' character surpasses the malevolent AI even though she's as amusing as ever".|$|E

2500|$|Tsai {{possesses}} a mezzo-soprano vocal range. She emerged champion at an MTV singing competition, {{and she used}} a bright, girlish vocal timbre in her early albums. However, she has been criticized in her early years for her vocals due to her limited vocal range. Producer Bing Wang, who collaborated with Tsai on her album Magic (2003), highlighted <b>her</b> <b>tone</b> and timbre as distinctive, but he claimed that [...] "she {{does not have a}} gifted vocals." [...] In 2007, Tsai won a Golden Melody Award for Best Mandarin Female Singer, and it was the very first time that her vocals was recognized by professional music awards. However, her win for Best Mandarin Female Singer generated controversy from critics. The awards jury responded that [...] "she won due to her all-round talent and universal pop appeal." [...] Sam Chen, the president of Warner Music Taiwan, commented that she is [...] "not a born vocalist but studied with vocal coaches." [...] Before the recording sessions of almost all of her studio albums, Tsai took vocal lessons, which increased her vocal range. Producer Tiger Chung, who collaborated with Tsai on her album Play, praised her vocal range and power. However, Play failed to earn her a Golden Melody Award nomination for Best Mandarin Female Singer. It raised a controversy among general public, and the awards jury responded that they doubted the overuse of Auto-Tune in the album’s songs. However, Tsai's manager Tom Wang dismissed the rumours, [...] "we welcome those who are in doubt to hear her live performance. I am confident with her ability," [...] he said. Critics Chen Le-jung, after watched her live performance during her Play World Tour, commented that Tsai is [...] "being able to sing long and vocal runs effortlessly".|$|E
2500|$|The singer also {{performed}} the song at the 2011 MTV Video Music Awards {{held at the}} Nokia Theatre in Los Angeles on 28 August 2011. After being introduced by American singer Katy Perry, Adele appeared in a black scalloped lace dress by Barbara Tfank, and standing alone on the stage, only with her pianist behind her. Her hair was pulled back and a signature ponytail draped over one shoulder she sang the song and [...] "did vocal aerobics and dripped her soulful, sultry sound over the dark ballad, while a transfixed audience watched her" [...] as stated by Kelley L. Carter of MTV. After the performance she received a standing ovation from fans and critics. According to USA Todays Cindy Clark she [...] "captivated the audience with her powerful performance". Wesley Case of The Baltimore Sun concluded, [...] "Adele's 'Someone Like You' could make a tough guy weep. <b>Her</b> <b>tone</b> was gorgeous." [...] Rating the performance with A, Claire Suddath of Time magazine said [...] "it's heartening to hear a truly talented woman sing a mournful torch song {{for someone who has}} left her for someone better. And if her stellar performance, accompanied by only a piano, isn't enough to melt your heart, then her nervous wave to the audience at the end definitely will." [...] A writer of Los Angeles Times called her vocals [...] "strong and direct, and tackles grief by moving with the melody rather than trying to pummel it" [...] and added that it was [...] "less-is-more performance, a tactic award-show producers rarely indulge in, but Adele needs few adornments to impress." [...] A writer of Rolling Stone said that Adele brought a [...] "big dollop of elegance to the VMAs with a spare, moving rendition of 'Someone Like You'" [...] and added that [...] "amid all the pop art glitz, it [...] was a refreshing palate cleanser." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "If {{you fear}} your own persuasive powers," [...] she said, with almost a sneer in <b>her</b> <b>tones,</b> [...] "you'd better {{not go to}} Elmhurst. One {{or the other of}} your country cousins might {{supplant}} you in your dear aunt's affections." ...|$|R
