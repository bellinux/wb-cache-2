Despite the various barriers to employment, some AAC users achieve success in educational endeavours and employment, though often in lower paying jobs. Factors {{that have been}} found to be related to employment are a strong work ethic and access to AAC technology, the support of family and friends, education, and work skills. Individuals with ALS who use AAC may continue working; factors supporting continued employment include access to AAC, support from <b>employers,</b> governmental programs and others. <b>Employers</b> of AAC users report that skills in time management, problem solving, communication, technology and a good education are important to <b>employers.</b>|$|E

30|$|The {{existing}} system at CareerBuilder 2 uses an <b>employer</b> name normalization system [14, 15, 16] and an <b>employer</b> knowledge base (KB) to infer the <b>employer</b> industry of a job. The <b>employer</b> name normalization system normalizes <b>employer</b> names and links {{them to an}} <b>employer</b> entity in the KB. The <b>employer</b> KB contains an industry attribute for each <b>employer</b> entity. However, errors may occur during the computation of the job <b>employer</b> and {{in the construction of}} the <b>employer</b> KB with the industry attributes. For example, the industry of the <b>employer</b> “First Transit” should be Transportation, but is incorrectly labeled as “Office Administrative Services” in the KB. The KB is huge with about 20 M entities, and hence, it is not possible to manually detect the errors.|$|R

30|$|Third, some {{variables}} have {{a different}} effect on the hazard {{to work for a}} new <b>employer</b> and on the hazard to work with the current <b>employer.</b> Thus seniority increases the hazard to work with the current <b>employer</b> but reduces the hazard to work with a new <b>employer.</b> This finding supports company-specific human capital (long seniority) being valuable to the current <b>employer</b> increasing the chance that a sick-listed worker stays with the current <b>employer.</b> In contrast, company specific human capital may not have the same value to a new <b>employer.</b> Therefore, the sick-listed worker’s reservation wage may exceed the wage offer from a new <b>employer,</b> reducing the sick-listed worker’s chance of returning to work with a new <b>employer.</b> While mental health problems have a significant and positive effect on the hazard rate to work with a new <b>employer,</b> it has a negative impact on the hazard rate to work with the current <b>employer.</b> Compared to a sick-listed worker without mental health problems, a worker with mental health problems has approximately 37 per cent lower probability of returning to the current <b>employer</b> during each month of the observation period and a 99 per cent higher ability of returning to a new <b>employer.</b> This marked difference could mean that the causes of the mental health problems are often related to the current <b>employer,</b> e.g. a poor working environment or a personal conflict. In such cases, returning to a new <b>employer</b> may be more feasible than returning to the current <b>employer.</b>|$|R

5|$|By 1900, {{the lumber}} {{industry}} had declined, and the city's economic base rested on other industries, including a furniture factory, a paper mill, a fire brick plant, and a silk mill. In 1938, the Piper Aircraft Corporation, {{maker of the}} Piper Cub and other light aircraft, moved its production plant to Lock Haven. It remained one of the city's biggest <b>employers</b> until the 1980s, when, after major flood damage and losses related to Hurricane Agnes in 1972, it moved to Florida. The loss of Piper Aircraft contributed to an unemployment {{rate of more than}} 20% in Lock Haven in the early 1980s, though the rate had declined to about 9% by 2000. Another large plant, the paper mill that had operated since the 1880s in Castanea Township, closed in 2001. By 2005, 32% of the city's labor force was employed in health care, education, or social services, 16% in manufacturing, 14% in retail trade, 13% in arts, entertainment, recreation, accommodation, and food services, and smaller fractions in other sectors.

Put differently, the sick-listed workers returning {{to work with a}} new <b>employer</b> terminate their employment much more quickly than those returning to work with their current <b>employer.</b> This finding supports the hypothesis that the job match between workers with a new <b>employer</b> is of poorer quality than the match between workers remaining with their current <b>employer.</b>|$|R
