30|$|Increased {{regional}} {{access to}} agricultural credit {{is important in}} promoting adoption of <b>inorganic</b> <b>fertilizer</b> and joint adoption of <b>inorganic</b> <b>fertilizer</b> and improved maize variety.

([2009]) Smallholders {{may not be able to}} accumulate sufficient savings to purchase relatively more expensive technologies like <b>inorganic</b> <b>fertilizer</b> or combined <b>inorganic</b> <b>fertilizer</b> and improved maize variety. On the contrary, increased credit access lowers the probability of adoption of improved maize variety as an individual technology. This implies that access to credit could make smallholders switch to higher value crops.|$|R
40|$|Environmental {{inappropriate}} {{effect that}} {{caused by the}} over application of <b>inorganic</b> <b>fertilizer</b> increased the importance of bio-organic fertilizer today. In order to investigate the effect of bio-organic fertilizer (plant booster) on the growth performance of paddy (Oryza sativa), an experiment was conducted as complete randomized design (CRD) with five replication and five treatments in rain shelter at UiTM Jasin in 2014. The objective {{of this study is}} to determine the best combination rate of bio-organic <b>fertilizer</b> and <b>inorganic</b> <b>fertilizer</b> for rice production and also to determine yield performance of paddy by using different combination rate of bioorganic <b>fertilizer</b> and <b>inorganic</b> <b>fertilizer.</b> Treatment included T 1 = 100 % bio-organic fertilizer, T 2 = 50 % bio-organic fertilizer + 50 % <b>inorganic</b> <b>fertilizer,</b> T 3 = 70 % bioorganic fertilizer + 30 % <b>inorganic</b> <b>fertilizer,</b> T 4 = 30 % bio-organic fertilizer + 70 % <b>inorganic</b> <b>fertilizer,</b> T 5 = 100 % <b>inorganic</b> <b>fertilizer.</b> The result indicted that the effect of bio-organic fertilizer (plant booster) when applied with the <b>inorganic</b> <b>fertilizer</b> showed significant influenced on number of panicle, plant height, yield of paddy, number of tillers and weight of 1000 grain. The result showed that treatment four exceeded all other treatment in number of tillers, number of panicle, weight of 1000 grain, paddy yield and plat height. The use of <b>inorganic</b> <b>fertilizer</b> along with bio-organic fertilizer was found better than applied <b>inorganic</b> <b>fertilizer</b> alone.

2500|$|Fertilizers are {{classified}} in several ways. [...] They {{are classified}} {{according to whether}} they provide a single nutrient (e.g., K, P, or N), in which case they are classified as [...] "straight fertilizers." [...] "Multinutrient fertilizers" [...] (or [...] "complex fertilizers") provide two or more nutrients, for example N and P. [...] Fertilizers are also sometimes classified as inorganic (the topic of most of this article) versus organic. [...] <b>Inorganic</b> <b>fertilizers</b> exclude carbon-containing materials except ureas. [...] Organic fertilizers are usually (recycled) plant- or animal-derived matter. [...] Inorganic are sometimes called synthetic fertilizers since various chemical treatments are required for their manufacture.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Inorganic</b> <b>fertilizers</b> are {{generally}} {{less expensive and}} have higher concentrations of nutrients than organic fertilizers. Also, since nitrogen, phosphorus and potassium generally {{must be in the}} inorganic forms to be taken up by plants, <b>inorganic</b> <b>fertilizers</b> {{are generally}} immediately bioavailable to plants without modification. [...] However, some have criticized the use of <b>inorganic</b> <b>fertilizers,</b> claiming that the water-soluble nitrogen doesn't provide for the long-term needs of the plant and creates water pollution.

30|$|Adoption {{rates of}} <b>inorganic</b> <b>fertilizer</b> and {{improved}} maize varieties increased {{between the two}} survey periods for all the broad agro-ecological zones. However, the lowlands remained the lowest adopters of both technologies, recording only 3.8 per cent adoption rate for <b>inorganic</b> <b>fertilizer</b> and 38 per cent for improved maize varieties. For manure adoption, the highlands were the worst performers although this was appropriately compensated for by the high adoption of <b>inorganic</b> <b>fertilizer.</b> Notably, adoption rates of manure did not change between the periods of reference. The 3.8 per cent of households that adopted <b>inorganic</b> <b>fertilizer</b> in the lowlands in 2004 also adopted improved maize varieties. The same pattern was replicated in 2007 with 3.9 per cent of households adopting both technologies, an indication {{that out of the}} 7.7 per cent that adopted <b>inorganic</b> <b>fertilizer</b> most also adopted improved maize varieties. This provides a useful insight: those who adopt <b>inorganic</b> <b>fertilizer</b> are more likely to adopt improved maize varieties.

Three treatments were laid in Randomized Complete Block Design (RCBD) with four replications. The application of vermicompost alone and the combination of <b>inorganic</b> <b>fertilizer</b> and vermicompost resulted to no significant differences in the height in comparison with <b>inorganic</b> <b>fertilizer</b> at 60 DAT both in 1 st and 2 nd trial.

In 2 nd trial, it generated a dramatic increase in ROI when using vermicompost supplemented with <b>inorganic</b> <b>fertilizer</b> (103. 8 %) which is comparably the same with <b>inorganic</b> <b>fertilizer</b> (119. 6 %).

30|$|The smallholders using manure {{in their}} crop {{production}} were six per cent {{less likely to}} adopt <b>inorganic</b> <b>fertilizer.</b> Such households were, however, seven per cent more likely to adopt improved maize varieties. <b>Inorganic</b> <b>fertilizer</b> and manure would be complementary in circumstances where there is under application of both but basically the two should be substitutes. Thus, farm households that have and apply sufficient quantities of manure would not apply <b>inorganic</b> <b>fertilizer.</b> This explains why both increase the probability of adopting improved maize varieties. For joint adoption of <b>inorganic</b> <b>fertilizer</b> and improved maize varieties, manure adopting smallholders had a six per cent lower chance than their non-adopting counterparts.|$|R

40|$|There is a {{downward}} spiral of declining soil fertility, low crop yield and increasing poverty in the less-favored areas of SSA. The semi-arid tropics of northern Ghana share this episode. The soils {{in this part of}} the country are naturally less endowed, have little organic matter content and farmers use very little <b>inorganic</b> <b>fertilizer.</b> Existing studies indicate that the erratic nature of rainfall in the area increases risk and constrains farmers' investment on <b>inorganic</b> <b>fertilizer.</b> However, agronomic studies suggest that promotion of sustainable use of <b>inorganic</b> <b>fertilizer</b> is indispensable at least in the short to medium term to break the downward spiral. Therefore, promoting sustainable use of <b>inorganic</b> <b>fertilizer</b> use remains to be a policy challenge. This paper argues that in spite of observed disinvestment on irrigation both by governments and donors there is significant complementarity between irrigation and <b>inorganic</b> <b>fertilizer</b> use in the less-favored areas of northern Ghana.

5000|$|The {{problem with}} organic {{fertilizers}} is, [...] "there is poor synchronization of nutrient availability and crop demand, as organic fertilizers release their nutrients slowly {{and not necessarily}} at the times when nutrients are required by crops". [...] This means that growing organic coffee is slower because the nutrients take time to release, thus slowing {{the growth rate of}} the plant. Using <b>inorganic</b> <b>fertilizers</b> permits faster growth of plants because it is modified to sustain a larger yield. <b>Inorganic</b> <b>fertilizers</b> must be bought, brought onto the farm, as opposed to say recycled manure of cattle or chicken.
