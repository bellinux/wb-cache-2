50|$|The {{continental}} runoff {{into the}} East Siberian Sea {{is relatively small}} at about 250 km3/year that makes only 10% of the total runoff in all the Arctic seas of Russia. The largest contribution is from the Kolyma River at 132 km3, followed by the Indigirka River at 59 km3. Most runoff (90%) occurs in summer; it is concentrated near the coast, owing to the weak river currents, and therefore does not significantly affect the sea hydrology. The water exchange between the neighboring seas is as follows. The annual outflow to the Laptev Sea, Chukchi Sea and Arctic Ocean is 3,240, 6,600 and 11,430 km3, respectively; while the respective <b>inflow</b> <b>values</b> are 3,240, 8,800 and 9,230 km3.|$|E
5000|$|SELDM models the {{potential}} effect of mitigation measures by using Monte Carlo methods with statistics that approximate the net effects of structural and nonstructural {{best management practices}} (BMPs). Structural BMPs are defined as {{the components of the}} drainage pathway between the source of runoff and a stormwater discharge location that affect the volume, timing, or quality of runoff. SELDM uses a simple stochastic statistical model of BMP performance to develop planning-level estimates of runoff-event characteristics. This statistical approach can be used to represent a single BMP or an assemblage of BMPs. The SELDM BMP-treatment module has provisions for stochastic modeling of three stormwater treatments: volume reduction, hydrograph extension, and water-quality treatment. In SELDM, these three treatment variables are modeled by using the trapezoidal distribution [...] and the rank correlation [...] with the associated highway-runoff variables. This report describes methods for calculating the trapezoidal-distribution statistics and rank correlation coefficients for stochastic modeling of volume reduction, hydrograph extension, and water-quality treatment by structural stormwater BMPs and provides the calculated values for these variables. These statistics are different from the statistics commonly used to characterize or compare BMPs. They are designed to provide a stochastic transfer function to approximate the quantity, duration, and quality of BMP effluent given the associated <b>inflow</b> <b>values</b> for a population of storm events.|$|E
40|$|The {{selection}} of <b>inflow</b> <b>values</b> at boundaries far upstream of an aircraft is considered, for one- and two-equation turbulence models. <b>Inflow</b> <b>values</b> are {{distinguished from the}} ambient values near the aircraft, which may be much smaller. Ambient values should be selected first, and <b>inflow</b> <b>values</b> {{that will lead to}} them after the decay second; this is not always possible, especially for the time scale. The two-equation decay during the approach to the aircraft is shown; often, the time scale has been set too short for this decay to be calculated accurately on typical grids. A simple remedy for both issues is to impose floor values for the turbulence variables, outside the viscous sublayer, and it is argued that overriding the equations in this manner is physically justified. Selecting laminar ambient values is easy, if the boundary layers are to be tripped, but a more common practice is to seek ambient values that will cause immediate transition in boundary layers. This opens up a wide range of values, and selection criteria are discussed. The turbulent Reynolds number, or ratio of eddy viscosity to laminar viscosity has a huge dynamic range that makes it unwieldy; it has been widely mis-used, particularly by codes that set upper limits on it. The value of turbulent kinetic energy in a wind tunnel or the atmosphere is also of dubious value as an input to the model. Concretely, the ambient eddy viscosity must be small enough to preserve potential cores in small geometry features, such as flap gaps. The ambient frequency scale should also be small enough, compared with shear rates in the boundary layer. Specific values are recommended and demonstrated for airfoil flow...|$|E

In this study, Time Delay Artificial Neural Network (TDANN) models, which are time lagged feed-formatted networks with delayed memory processing elements at the input layer, are applied to forecast the daily inflow into a planned Reservoir (Almopeos River basin) in Northern Greece. The network topology is using multiple inputs, which include the one time lagged daily reservoir <b>inflow</b> <b>values</b> and the time lagged daily precipitation values from three meteorological stations which are inside the Almopeos river basin and a single output, which are the daily reservoir <b>inflow</b> <b>values.</b> The choice of the precipitation input variables introduced to the input layer {{was based on the}} cross-correlation. In the forecasting part of this study, predictions of one day ahead were investigated. The training of ANNs suitable for the current application is the cascade correlation algorithm. Kalman’s learning rule was used to modify the artificial neural network weights. The networks are designed by putting weights between neurons, by using the hyperbolic-tangent function for training. The results show a good performance of the TDANN approach and demonstrate its adequacy and potential for forecasting daily reservoir inflow.

"Stickiness" is defined as the transition probability that an employee stays in a given setting; "inflow" as the proportion of new employees. Using a longitudinal dataset of all nurses registered with the College of Nurses of Ontario, Canada 1993 - 2003, employment site was used to define consistent sectors and sub-sectors. Each nurse was assigned to one sector/sub-sector per year. Stickiness and <b>inflow</b> <b>values</b> were calculated for each sub-sector, and the trends across time were analyzed.

40|$|Forecasting {{long-term}} {{power production}} of small hydropower (SHP) plants {{is of great}} significance for coordinating with large-medium hydropower (LHP) plants. Accurate forecasting can {{solve the problems of}} waste-water and abandoned electricity and ensure the safe operation of the power system. However, it faces a series of challenges, such as lack of sufficient data, uncertainty of power generation, no regularity of a single station and poor forecasting models. It is difficult to establish a forecasting model based on classical and mature prediction models. Therefore, this paper introduces a correlation analysis method for forecasting power production of SHP plants. By analyzing the correlation between SHP and LHP plants, a safe conclusion can be drawn that the power production of SHP plants show similar interval inflow to LHP plants in the same region. So a regression model is developed to forecast power production of SHP plants by using the forecasting <b>inflow</b> <b>values</b> of LHP plants. Taking the SHP plants in Yunnan province as an example, the correlation between SHP and LHP plants in a district or county are analyzed respectively.

30|$|The {{problems}} encountered {{during the}} construction period are mainly {{related to the}} unexpected inflow of groundwater at some locations; predicting the location of water ingresses is often a difficult task (Huang and Lu 2007). To obtain a more accurate <b>value</b> of the <b>inflow</b> at a tunnel face or the area near it during tunnel excavation, the groundwater pressure in the tunnel working area needs to be determined. Then, the water <b>inflow</b> <b>value</b> can be accurately predicted using hydraulics theory. Groundwater pressure can usually be determined using seepage theory if the groundwater table and geological conditions are known which can indicate the head loss from water table to measuring point. Zhang (2006) presented a seepage load incremental theory for analyzing stress in a lining {{and its impact on}} the water inflow during the excavation process. Wang et al. (2008) proposed a theoretical model to estimate the water pressure on a lining under controlled drainage. Atkinson and Mair (1983), Shin et al. (2002), Yoo (2005) and Lee et al. (2007) draw the same conclusions using a numerical simulation. Other researchers focused on analytical solutions to calculate the pore water pressure to estimate the effective stress distribution at the tunnel perimeter (Fernández and Alvarez 1994). However, during the tunnel excavation process, the geological conditions are always unknown and change along the excavation axis, so it is hard to obtain an accurate loss of the pressure head. To overcome this problem, this paper presents a theoretical method to more accurately predict the groundwater pressure during the tunnel excavation process. First, the water inflow can be measured from an advanced borehole or grout-hole. Then, this value can be used to calculate the groundwater pressure through hydraulics theory and to forecast the water inrush that may occur at the tunnel working area so that suitable countermeasures can be presented.|$|R
40|$|AbstractPurpose : The {{purpose of}} this study was to develop a {{physiologic}} method to measure outflow and inflow from the lower extremities and thus to quantify the degree of venous valvular insufficiency and venous obstructive disease. Methods : Calibrated photoplethysmography was used in combination with passive changes in hydrostatic pressure, by leg elevation followed by repositioning of the leg to the original sitting position. With the principle of venous occlusion plethysmography, timed volume changes were then used to calculate the outflow and inflow. The inflow and outflow units were the percentage of optical reflectance (%OR) per minute. The respective resistances were calculated by identifying the hydrostatic pressure distance from the third intercostal space to the probe site that is inducing these site changes. The resistance units were millimeters of Mercury × minutes per %OR. Results : Four groups of subjects were examined: normal individuals, patients with venous valvular insufficiency, deep venous thrombosis, and a combination of both. The most significant differences in outflow values were found between the control group (81. 77 % OR/min) and the deep venous thrombosis group (28. 47 % OR/min). In contrast, the most significant differences in <b>inflow</b> <b>values</b> were found between the control group (9. 67 % OR/min) and the venous valvular insufficiency group (108. 61 % OR/min).

40|$|A {{model has}} been {{developed}} for estimation of groundwater inflow to a stream reach from observations of stream temperature, groundwater temperature, stream flow rate, and standard weather parameters. The purpose of this model is to provide an estimate of groundwater inflow rate for stream reaches where groundwater inflow is significant. This information is useful for management of fisheries and urban development in watersheds where stream temperature is a concern. In particular, the model was developed {{for use in the}} Vermillion River, which has designated trout stream reaches that may be impacted by development in the watershed. The model estimates groundwater inflow rate from a stream reach heat budget, which takes into account atmospheric heat flux, sediment-water heat exchange, and groundwater inflow. The model requires the following data as input: stream temperature at the upstream and downstream ends of the stream reach, stream flow {{at either end of the}} reach, standard weather data, and no significant tributaries or inflows between the ends of the reach. The model was applied to six reaches in the Vermillion River watershed. Estimated groundwater inflow rates showed considerable spatial and temporal variability, both seasonally and between the two years simulated (2006 and 2007). In North Creek, groundwater inflow rate was 0. 45 to 1. 30 cfs/mile in 2007; in the upper Vermillion River main stem for the same period estimated inflow rates ranged from 0. 15 to 3. 87 cfs/mile. In the middle Vermillion River main stem, estimated inflow rates were unnaturally large and more variable (0. 39 to 11. 1 cfs/mile); these estimates include significant tributary inflow, which is lumped with groundwater inflow in the model. This, along with the failure of the model for reaches or periods involving high stream flows, is the likely source of the over-predicted groundwater <b>inflow</b> <b>values.</b> Simulations for lower South Creek showed negligible groundwater inflow for 2006; results for lower South Branch were very typical of a groundwater-fed stream, with relatively constant groundwater inflow (around 1. 0 cfs/mile) that fluctuated only slightly during periods of heavy rainfall. A comparison of predicted groundwater inflow rates throughout the watershed for both dry (baseflow) and high-flow conditions suggest the presence of shallow groundwater, particularly in the lower reaches of the watershed. The significant variability in groundwater inflow rate predicted by the model can be traced to a number of factors, including data quality and sensitivity of the model to groundwater temperatures, stream shading/sheltering, and especially to stream flow. An extensive sensitivity analysis of the model is presented in this report, as well as an analysis of available data, in particular, groundwater temperature. Limitations of the heat budget approach to modeling groundwater inflow rate are also discussed and criteria for application of the model are developed from the results of sensitivity analysis.

40|$|The {{reliability}} of wind turbines against extreme loads {{is the focus}} of this study. A procedure to establish nominal loads for use in a conventional load-and-resistance-factor-design (LRFD) format is presented. The procedure, based on an inverse reliability approach, permits inclusion of randomness in the gross wind environment {{as well as in the}} extreme response given wind conditions. A detailed example is presented where three alternative nominal load definitions are used to estimate extreme bending loads for a 600 kW three-bladed horizontal-axis wind turbine. Only operating loads – here, flapwise (out-of-plane) bending moments – at a blade root are considered but the procedure described may be applied to estimate other loads and response measures of interest in wind turbine design. Results suggest that a full random characterization of both wind conditions and short-term maximum response (given wind conditions) will yield extreme design loads that might be approximated reasonably well by simpler models that include only the randomness in the wind environment but that account for response variability by employing appropriately derived “higher-than-median ” fractiles of the extreme bending load conditional on <b>inflow</b> parameter <b>values...</b>|$|R
40|$|The left {{ventricular}} cineangiograms of 22 asymptomatic, apparently healthy male aviators without noninvasive (echocardiographic or auscultatory) evidence of {{mitral valve prolapse}} were reviewed and {{compared with those of}} 12 men with noninvasive evidence of mild mitral valve prolapse. The maximal protrusion of the posterior mitral valve leaflet superior and posterior to a line perpendicular to the long axis of the left ventricle at end-systole was measured from the right anterior oblique {{left ventricular}} cineangiogram by repeated observation of left ventricular <b>inflow.</b> The <b>values</b> were 7. 5 ± 1. 6 mm in patients without mitral valve prolapse and 11. 2 ± 3. 4 mm in patients with mitral valve prolapse (mean ± 1 standard deviation). This measurement did not exceed 11 mm in any patient without prolapse. It is concluded that: 1) with meticulous attention to angiographic landmarks of the left ventricular inflow area, the limits of normal systolic posterior mitral leaflet motion can be defined; and 2) systolic motion outside these limits constitutes a quantitative criterion for the angiographic diagnosis of mitral valve prolapse...|$|R
40|$|Reactive-transport {{processes}} in the Wightman Fork/Alamosa River system downstream of the Summitville Mine, south-central Colorado, were simulated under low-flow conditions using the OTIS and OTEQ solute transport modeling programs. Simulation results revealed that Ca, Cu, Mg, Mn, Na, Zn, Cl, F, and SO 4 are conservative in the stream reach, whereas pH, Fe, and Al are non-conservative. Simulations that allow precipitation of Fe(OH) 3 and Al(OH) 3 match observed water quality more closely than conservative simulations. The pH could not be adequately simulated without assuming that tributary <b>inflows</b> had pH <b>values</b> of about 8 or higher and alkalinities of 50 - 110 milligrams per liter (mg/L). Subsequent sampling confirmed these predictions...|$|R
50|$|The {{years from}} 1834-1837 {{leading up to}} the State {{bankruptcies}} were inflationary until the Panic of 1837. Prices for cotton and other exports sent overseas were rising. Through trade and state-backed bonds, the United States had a strong inflow of capital from the Bank of England and other European parties. Large infrastructure investments were being made domestically with the excess <b>inflow</b> of monetary <b>value</b> to the U.S. Much of the westward expansion of the United States was brought about from overseas funding for railroads and canals. Increasing the efficiency of transportation made it easier for people {{to move away from the}} large ports on the East coast.|$|R
40|$|Wetland {{ecosystems}} {{are controlled by}} their hydrology. Recent experimental and numerical investigations have suggested that flow pulses are needed to preserve sediment redistribution in some wetlands. In this study, the authors investigate the effect of pulsed-flow conditions on the hydrologic regime of low-gradient densely vegetated wetlands using a fine-resolution, two-dimensional depth-averaged numerical flow model. The model was applied to simulate flow depth and velocity within the Loxahatchee Impoundment Landscape Assessment (LILA) wetland located in Boynton Beach, Florida. Two pulsed-flow conditions with low-pulse and high-pulse flow magnitude were considered. The simulation results of low-pulse flow conditions reveal the areas within deep sloughs where flow velocities and directions change continuously, creating enhanced mixing areas within the deep slough. These mixing areas may {{have the potential to}} affect processes such as sediment redistribution and nutrient transport. Simulation of high-pulse flow magnitude, however, results in more uniform flow velocity inside deep slough. It also indicates that a pulse can only be detected when inflow discharge is at least 3. 0 [*][*]m 3 /s. Lower <b>inflow</b> discharge <b>values</b> are too weak in magnitude to generate substantial changes in water surface elevation and velocity and they may not exhibit a flow wave propagation into the study area...|$|R
