6000|$|I {{promised to}} take {{the world at large}} into my {{confidence}} on the subject of our wedding at the smiddy. You in London, no doubt, dress more gorgeously for marriages than we do--though we can present a fine show of color--and you do not make your own wedding-cake, as Lizzie did. But what is your excitement to ours? I suppose you have many scores of marriages for our one, but you only know of those from the newspapers. [...] "At so-and-so, by the Rev. Mr. Such-a-one, John to Elizabeth, eldest daughter of Thomas." [...] That is all you know of the couple who were married round the corner, and therefore, I say, a hundred such weddings are less eventful <b>in</b> <b>your</b> <b>community</b> than one wedding in ours.|$|E
6000|$|Of {{course there}} was a buzz of {{conversation}} going on--there always is; but at last, when the Rev. Mr. Burgess rose and laid {{his hand on the}} sack, he could hear his microbes gnaw, the place was so still. He related the curious history of the sack, then went on to speak in warm terms of Hadleyburg's old and well-earned reputation for spotless honesty, and of the town's just pride in this reputation. He said that this reputation was a treasure of priceless value; that under Providence its value had now become inestimably enhanced, for the recent episode had spread this fame far and wide, and thus had focussed the eyes of the American world upon this village, and made its name for all time, as he hoped and believed, a synonym for commercial incorruptibility. (Applause.) [...] "And who is to be the guardian of this noble fame--the community as a whole? No! The responsibility is individual, not communal. From this day forth {{each and every one of}} you is in his own person its special guardian, and individually responsible that no harm shall come to it. Do you--does each of you--accept this great trust? (Tumultuous assent.) Then all is well. Transmit it to your children and to your children's children. To-day your purity is beyond reproach--see to it that it shall remain so. To-day there is not a person <b>in</b> <b>your</b> <b>community</b> who could be beguiled to touch a penny not his own--see to it that you abide in this grace. ("We will! we will!") This is not the place to make comparisons between ourselves and other communities--some of them ungracious towards us; they have their ways, we have ours; let us be content. (Applause.) I am done. Under my hand, my friends, rests a stranger's eloquent recognition of what we are; through him the world will always henceforth know what we are. We do not know who he is, but in your name I utter your gratitude, and ask you to raise your voices in indorsement." ...|$|E
