5|$|Although heavily {{populated}} {{prior to the}} conquest, the impact of Old World diseases {{was one of the}} factors that resulted in the depopulation of the hot, moist lands of the Depresión Central, which remain sparsely populated to this day. Likewise, Soconusco was rapidly <b>depopulated</b> as a result of disease soon after contact with the Spanish. Among the most deadly diseases were smallpox, influenza, measles and a number of pulmonary diseases, including tuberculosis.|$|E

40|$|Planning {{research}} has increasingly recognised that planning in <b>depopulating</b> areas differs from planning in growth areas. Several studies {{have sought to}} identify planning theories and strategies {{that are capable of}} meeting the challenges presented by <b>depopulating</b> areas. However, most of these studies and strategies are based on dense urban environments. This paper seeks to add to planning theory and practice by focusing on informal planning practices in rural <b>depopulating</b> areas. Starting from a resource-based view, the paper introduces an analytical framework that allows a systematic examination of the resources that are generated through informal planning practices in such areas...|$|R

5|$|By {{the end of}} the crusade, the {{countryside}} of Mecklenburg and Pomerania was plundered and <b>depopulated</b> with much bloodshed, especially by the troops of Henry the Lion. This was to help bring about more Christian victories in the future decades. The Slavic inhabitants also lost much of their methods of production, limiting their resistance in the future.|$|E
5|$|From the 15th century, {{changes to}} the areas {{surrounding}} Santa María de Óvila initiated a slow decline. Civil wars <b>depopulated</b> the villages of the upper Tagus valley. The monastery's land holdings passed one by one {{into the hands of}} the new regional aristocracy: first the Count of Cifuentes, followed by Rui Gomes da Silva, Duke of Pastrana, and the Spanish Army. Neighbors looted more lands.|$|E
5|$|The {{mineral springs}} of the Borjomi valley were {{discovered}} over one thousand years ago. Seven large rock tubs discovered by archeologists {{dating back to}} the beginning of the 7th century attest to the availability and use of the spring waters, most likely for bathing purposes. The springs were abandoned before being rediscovered in the early 19th century. By that time, as a result of the incessant warfare, Borjomi and its environs had been <b>depopulated</b> and covered with impassable forests.|$|E

5|$|Al-Birwa {{stood on}} a rocky hill {{overlooking}} the Acre plain, with an average elevation of 60 meters above sea level. It was situated {{at the intersection of}} two highways—one led to Acre and the other towards Haifa. Located 10.5 kilometers east of Acre, the other nearest localities to al-Birwa included al-Damun (<b>depopulated</b> in 1948) to the south, and the Arab towns of Jadeida to the northwest, Julis to the north, Sha'ab to the east, and Majd al-Kurum to the northeast.|$|E
5|$|Alexander I Aldea (14311436) was {{the first}} Romanian ruler {{to be forced to}} render {{military}} service to the Ottomans. Two decades later, Vlad III the Impaler (1448, 14561462, 1476), notorious as the model for the Dracula legend, turned against the Ottoman Empire. He carried out a series of attacks across the Danube in the winter of 14611462. The response was a massive invasion led by Mehmed II who drove Vlad III from the throne and replaced him with his brother, Radu III the Fair (14621475). Due to the frequent military operations, the Wallachian Plain was heavily <b>depopulated</b> {{after the end of the}} 14thcentury. On the other hand, Wallachia received a steady flow of immigrants, mostly from the Balkans.|$|E

5|$|East Germany's {{communities}} had a {{much harder}} time, because the country was poorer and their government imposed severe restrictions on them. The border region was progressively <b>depopulated</b> through the clearance of numerous villages and the forced relocation of their inhabitants. Border towns suffered draconian building restrictions: inhabitants were forbidden from building new houses and even repairing existing buildings, causing infrastructure to fall into severe decay. The state did little but to provide a 15% income supplement to those living in the Sperrzone and Schutzstreifen; but this did not halt the shrinkage of the border population, as younger people moved elsewhere to find employment and better living conditions.|$|E
5|$|In 1792, the King of Coorg, Dodda Vira-Rajendra, {{managed to}} escape from captivity at Seringapatnam, and, {{with the aid of}} the British armies under Lord Cornwallis, was able to regain Coorg for himself through the treaty of 1792 between the English, their allies and Tipu. Anxious to repopulate a kingdom <b>depopulated</b> by Tipu, Dodda welcomed the {{fugitive}} Konkani Christians. As an inducement to remain permanently in his territory, he granted them several privileges, obtained a priest from Goa, and built a chapel for them. After the relaxation of policies from 1792 onwards, the Christians began to resettle in Canara. Many Mangalorean Catholic students, who had studied for the priesthood in Goa returned to Mangalore.|$|E
5|$|Its {{position}} on a major route way brought death and destruction to the town on many occasions. In 1069, {{in an attempt to}} quell rebellion in the north, the area between the Ouse and the Tyne was laid to waste by the armies of William the Conqueror. The town of Northallerton was almost totally destroyed or <b>depopulated.</b> Just a few years later it is described in the Domesday Book as modo est in manu regis et wastum est (put down as waste). In 1318, the town was destroyed again by the Scots, under Sir James Douglas following the Capture of Berwick upon Tweed.|$|E

5|$|Most Armenian {{geographical}} names {{were in the}} eastern provinces of the Ottoman empire. Villages, settlements, or towns that contain the suffix -kert, meaning built or built by (i.e. Manavazkert (today Malazgirt), Norakert, Dikranagert, Noyakert), -shen, meaning village (i.e. Aratashen, Pemzashen, Norashen), and -van, meaning town (i.e. Charentsavan, Nakhichevan, Tatvan), signify an Armenian name. Throughout Ottoman history, Turkish and Kurdish tribesmen have settled into Armenian villages and changed the native Armenian names (i.e. the Armenian Norashen was changed to Norşin). This was especially true after the Armenian genocide, when much of eastern Turkey was <b>depopulated</b> of its Armenian population.|$|E
5|$|The Austro-Hungarians {{suffered}} about 225,000 casualties, including 30,000 killed, 173,000 {{wounded and}} 70,000 taken prisoner. They reported that 200 of their officers were taken prisoner {{during the battle}} and more than 130 cannon, 70 heavy machine-guns and a large quantity of matériel were captured. The Serbs also suffered heavy casualties, with 22,000 killed, 91,000 wounded and 19,000 missing or captured. The Western press was appalled with the scale of atrocities committed by the Austro-Hungarian troops against Serbian civilians, including women and children. William Shepard, of the United Press, confirmed as an eyewitness that at least eighteen towns were fully abandoned, and the whole of northwestern Serbia was nearly <b>depopulated.</b>|$|E
5|$|The first {{evidence}} of human {{presence in the}} area is dated between 17,000 and 10,000 years ago. The area of the park has been sparsely populated throughout historical times, however from the 17th to the 19th century the local communities of Zagori acquired an autonomous status, flourished economically due to increased trade, and became a major center of folk medicine. In recent decades, ecotourism {{is seen as a}} remedy to the economic decline of heavily <b>depopulated</b> local settlements, while preserving the natural environment and local architecture.|$|E

5|$|The medieval chronicler William of Malmesbury {{says that}} the king also seized and <b>depopulated</b> many miles of land (36 parishes), turning it into the royal New Forest region to support his {{enthusiastic}} enjoyment of hunting. Modern historians {{have come to the}} conclusion that the New Forest depopulation was greatly exaggerated. Most of the lands of the New Forest are poor agricultural lands, and archaeological and geographic studies have shown that the New Forest was likely sparsely settled when it was turned into a royal forest. William was known for his love of hunting, and he introduced the forest law into areas of the country, regulating who could hunt and what could be hunted.|$|E
5|$|There is archaeological {{evidence}} of human habitation during the Mesolithic period circa 8000BC, of Neolithic farming circa 2500BC and of Bronze Age settlement circa 1800BC, {{during which time}} a stone circle of puddingstones was built at Chesham. The Catuvellauni tribe occupied and settled the area in around 500BC, and at nearby Latimer there are remains of a Roman villa and {{archaeological evidence}} of Roman vineyards. Following {{the departure of the}} Romans the area appears to have been <b>depopulated</b> until Anglo-Saxon colonisation in the 7th century AD.|$|E
5|$|These {{diseases}} {{swept through}} Yucatán in the 1520s and 1530s, with periodic recurrences throughout the 16th century. By the late 16th century, malaria {{had arrived in}} the region, and yellow fever was first reported in the mid-17th century. Mortality was high, with approximately 50% of the population of some Yucatec Maya settlements being wiped out. Those areas of the peninsula that experience damper conditions became rapidly <b>depopulated</b> after the conquest with the introduction of malaria and other waterborne parasites. The native population of the northeastern portion of the peninsula was almost completely eliminated within fifty years of the conquest. Soconusco also suffered catastrophic population collapse, with an estimated 90–95% drop.|$|E
40|$|In {{this paper}} {{we present a}} system level {{technique}} for mapping large, multiple-IP-block designs to channel-width constrained FPGAs. Most FPGA clustering tools [2, 3, 11] aim {{to reduce the amount}} of inter-cluster connections, hence reducing channel width needs. However, if this exceeds the FPGA’s channel width (a hard con-straint), then the circuit still cannot be routed. Previous work [11, 12] <b>depopulates</b> logic clusters (CLBs) to reduce channel width. By <b>depopulating</b> non-uniformly, i. e. <b>depopulate</b> more in hard-to-route regions, we show a graceful trade-off between channel width and CLB count. This makes it possible to target specic channel-width constraints during clustering with minimal CLB ination. Results show channel width decreases of up to 20 % with a 5 % increase in area. Further decreases of nearly 50 % are possible at 3. 3 times the original area. Despite the area increase, this technique creates routable solutions from otherwise-unroutable circuits...|$|R
