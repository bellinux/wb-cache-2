5|$|Cordray {{was granted}} a ruling by the Ohio Supreme Court that lower courts could not grant a stay of {{execution}} for a death row inmate. At the same time, Fisher, Cordray's boss, sought a referendum to mandate that appeals in <b>death</b> <b>penalty</b> <b>cases</b> be made directly to the Supreme Court. In 1994 the 6th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in Steffen v. Tate (39 F.3d 622 1994) limited death row inmates to a single federal appeal and said that federal courts cannot stay an execution if the case is still in a state court.|$|E
5|$|The {{court also}} reviews <b>death</b> <b>penalty</b> <b>cases,</b> state tax court appeals, and items {{regarding}} legal discipline on direct review. Direct review {{means that the}} Supreme Court hears cases directly upon appeal without the case first going to the Court of Appeals. Other direct review items include state agency decisions such as the placement of prisons, placement of energy production facilities, locations of sites for solid waste disposal, and some labor law injunctions. Additionally, the court has original jurisdiction in, writs of mandamus, writs quo warranto, writs of habeas corpus, reapportionment of state legislative districts, and challenges to ballot measures such as their titles, the fiscal impact statement, and the explanatory statement as listed in the Voter’s Pamphlet.|$|E
5|$|On the {{administrative}} {{end of the}} court, the Oregon Court of Appeals was created in 1969 as an intermediate appellate court in Oregon. With this change, the Supreme Court now generally does not hear appeals directly from the trial level courts of the state, with some exceptions such as <b>death</b> <b>penalty</b> <b>cases.</b> Other changes came in 1981 when the Oregon Legislature and justice Arno Denecke reformed the chief justice position from a simple head of the court in title only, to {{the administrative}} head of the entire Oregon judicial system. The following year, 1982, the court received its first female member when Governor Vic Atiyeh appointed Betty Roberts as an associate justice. Then from 1991 to 2005 Wallace P. Carson, Jr. served as {{chief justice of the}} court for a record 14 years.|$|E
25|$|May 31, 2007: Attorneys for Michael Addison {{stated that}} the New Hampshire Supreme Court should halt all {{proceedings}} due to claims of how the courts handled the <b>death</b> <b>penalty</b> <b>case</b> for Addison. These claims included that the court should not impose the <b>death</b> <b>penalty</b> <b>case</b> at all or that it enact certain rules pertaining to how the courts would handle a death sentence.|$|R

25|$|The Court {{held that}} {{testimony}} {{on the form}} of a victim impact statement was admissible and constitutional in <b>death</b> <b>penalty</b> <b>cases,</b> thus expressly overruling two prior cases, Booth v. Maryland (1987) and South Carolina v. Gathers (1989).|$|E
25|$|Payne v. Tennessee, 501 U.S. 808 (1991), was a United States Supreme Court case {{which held}} that {{testimony}} {{in the form of}} a victim impact statement is admissible during the sentencing phase of a trial and, in <b>death</b> <b>penalty</b> <b>cases,</b> does not violate the Cruel and Unusual Punishment Clause of the Eighth Amendment. Payne narrowed two of the Courts' precedents: Booth v. Maryland (1987) and South Carolina v. Gathers (1989).|$|E
50|$|We {{concluded}} that the most significant factor in Charlton’s removal was his actions in a <b>death</b> <b>penalty</b> <b>case.</b> Charlton persistently opposed the Department’s decision to seek the <b>death</b> <b>penalty</b> in a homicide case, and he irritated Department leaders by seeking {{a meeting with the}} Attorney General to urge him to reconsider his decision. We are troubled that Department officials considered Charlton’s actions in the <b>death</b> <b>penalty</b> <b>case,</b> including requesting a meeting with the Attorney General, to be inappropriate. We do not believe his actions were insubordinate or that they justified his removal.|$|R

25|$|A cert {{petition}} is {{voted on}} at a {{session of the}} court called a conference.

If four Justices vote to grant the petition, the case proceeds to the briefing stage; otherwise, the case ends. Except in <b>death</b> <b>penalty</b> <b>cases</b> and other cases in which the Court orders briefing from the respondent, the respondent may, but is not required to, file a response to the cert petition.|$|E
25|$|As of May 2009, {{there were}} at least 137 known {{juvenile}} offenders awaiting execution in Iran, but the total number could be much higher as many <b>death</b> <b>penalty</b> <b>cases</b> in Iran are believed to go unreported. Of the 43 child offenders recorded as having been executed since 1990, 11 were still under the age of 18 {{at the time of their}} execution while the others were either kept on death row until they had reached 18 or were convicted and sentenced after reaching that age. Including at least one 13-year-old and 14-year-old.|$|E

25|$|Some critics {{believe that}} the {{election}} of judges has contributed to an exceedingly high rate of executions. Alabama has the highest per capita death penalty rate in the country. In some years, it imposes more death sentences than does Texas, a state which has a population five times larger. Some of its cases have been highly controversial; the Supreme Court has overturned 24 convictions in <b>death</b> <b>penalty</b> <b>cases.</b> It {{is the only state}} that still allows judges to override jury decisions in whether or not to use a death sentence; in 10 cases judges overturned sentences of life imprisonment without parole (LWOP) that were voted unanimously by juries.|$|E
25|$|The Democratic Party {{supports}} {{the death penalty}} {{far less than the}} Republican Party. Though most Democrats in Congress have never seriously moved to overturn the rarely used federal death penalty, both Russ Feingold and Dennis Kucinich have introduced such bills with little success. Democrats have led efforts to overturn state death penalty laws, particularly in New Jersey and in New Mexico. They have also sought to prevent reinstatement of the death penalty in those states which prohibit it, including Massachusetts and New York. During the Clinton administration, Democrats led the expansion of the federal death penalty. These efforts resulted in the passage of the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996, signed into law by President Clinton; the law heavily limited appeals in <b>death</b> <b>penalty</b> <b>cases.</b>|$|E
25|$|The Arizona Supreme Court is {{the highest}} court in Arizona. The court {{currently}} consists of one chief justice, a vice chief justice, and three associate justices. Justices are appointed by the governor from a list recommended by a bipartisan commission, and are re-elected after the initial two years following their appointment. Subsequent re-elections occur every six years. The supreme court has appellate jurisdiction in <b>death</b> <b>penalty</b> <b>cases,</b> but almost all other appellate cases go through the Arizona Court of Appeals beforehand. The court has original jurisdiction in a few other circumstances, as outlined in the state constitution. The court may also declare laws unconstitutional, but only while seated en banc. The court meets in the Arizona Supreme Court Building at the capitol complex (at {{the southern end of}} Wesley Bolin Plaza).|$|E
50|$|Under the Tennessee Plan, {{one judge}} (State Supreme Court Justice Penny White) was removed in 1996. She was highly rated by the Evaluation Commission, but her opinion in a <b>death</b> <b>penalty</b> <b>case</b> became {{controversial}} {{and this was}} played up by those opposing her reconfirmation.|$|R
50|$|Perhaps {{the most}} famous, or infamous, Kansas <b>death</b> <b>penalty</b> <b>case</b> {{was that of}} Richard Hickock and Perry Smith, sentenced for the 1959 murder of a farming family.

25|$|The {{only men}} prosecuted for these events were 122 African Americans, with 73 charged with murder. Twelve were quickly {{convicted and sentenced}} to death by all-white juries for murder of the white deputy at the church. Others were convicted of lesser charges and sentenced to prison. During appeals, the <b>death</b> <b>penalty</b> <b>cases</b> were separated. Six {{convictions}} (known as the Ware defendants) were overturned at the state level for technical trial details. These six defendants were retried in 1920 and convicted again, but on appeal the state supreme court overturned the verdicts, based on violations of the Due Process Clause and the Civil Rights Act of 1875, due to exclusion of blacks from the juries. The lower courts failed to retry the men within the two years required by Arkansas law, and the defense gained their release in 1923.|$|E
25|$|On appeal, Kennedy {{challenged}} {{the constitutionality of}} executing a person solely for child rape, and the Louisiana Supreme Court rejected the challenge {{on the grounds that}} the death penalty was not too harsh for such a heinous offense. The court distinguished the U.S. Supreme Court's plurality decision in Coker v. Georgia (1977), concluding that Cokers rejection of death as punishment for rape of an adult woman did not apply when the victim was a child. Rather, the Louisiana Supreme Court applied a balancing test set out by the U.S. Supreme Court in more recent <b>death</b> <b>penalty</b> <b>cases,</b> Atkins v. Virginia and Roper v. Simmons, first examining whether there is a national consensus on the punishment and then considering whether the court would find the punishment excessive. The Louisiana Supreme Court concluded that the adoption of similar laws in five other states, coupled with the unique vulnerability of children, satisfied Atkins and Roper.|$|E
25|$|After a death {{sentence}} is affirmed in state collateral review, the prisoner may file for federal habeas corpus, which is a unique type of lawsuit that can be brought in federal courts. Federal habeas corpus {{is a type of}} collateral review, and {{it is the only way}} that state prisoners may attack a {{death sentence}} in federal court (other than petitions for certiorari to the United States Supreme Court after both direct review and state collateral review). The scope of federal habeas corpus is governed by the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996 (AEDPA), which restricted significantly its previous scope. The purpose of federal habeas corpus is to ensure that state courts, through the process of direct review and state collateral review, have done a reasonable job in protecting the prisoner's federal constitutional rights. Prisoners may also use federal habeas corpus suits to bring forth new evidence that they are innocent of the crime, though to be a valid defense at this late stage in the process, evidence of innocence must be truly compelling. According to Eric Freedman, 21 percent of <b>death</b> <b>penalty</b> <b>cases</b> are reversed through federal habeas corpus.|$|E
50|$|Riles' initial <b>death</b> <b>penalty</b> <b>case</b> was {{reversed}} on appeal because prosecutors introduced {{evidence of a}} separate crime during that trial. Upon retrial, Riles was resentenced to the <b>death</b> <b>penalty.</b> In 1985, he was badly burned when he set his prison cell on fire in a suicide attempt. A 1986 scheduled execution was stayed because of concerns over whether the <b>death</b> <b>penalty</b> was disproportionately applied to black perpetrators with white victims.|$|R
