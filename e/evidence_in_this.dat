25|$|With {{a change}} in {{administration}} and charges of conflict of interest (on both sides) arising from the original trial, the U.S. Attorney General dropped the lawsuit on 30 November 1897 leaving several issues undecided on the merits. During a deposition filed for the 1887 trial, Meucci claimed to have created the first working model of a telephone in Italy in 1834. In 1886, {{in the first of}} three cases in which he was involved, Meucci took the stand as a witness in the hopes of establishing his invention's priority. Meucci's <b>evidence</b> <b>in</b> <b>this</b> case was disputed due to lack of material evidence of his inventions as his working models were reportedly lost at the laboratory of American District Telegraph (ADT) of New York.

25|$|During {{their time}} in Britain, the ancient Romans {{encountered}} tribes in present-day Wales that they called the Ordovices, the Demetae, the Silures and the Deceangli. The people {{of what is now}} Wales were not distinguished {{from the rest of the}} peoples of southern Britain; all were called Britons and spoke the common British language, a Brythonic Celtic tongue. Celtic language and culture seems to have arrived in Britain during the Iron Age, though some archaeologists argue that there is no evidence for large-scale Iron Age migrations into Great Britain. The claim has also been made that Indo-European languages may have been introduced to the British Isles as early as the early Neolithic (or even earlier), with Goidelic and Brythonic languages developing indigenously. Others hold that the close similarity between the Goidelic and Brythonic branches, and their sharing of Late Bronze Age and Early Iron Age terminology with their continental relatives, point to a more recent introduction of Indo-European languages (or close communication), with Proto-Celtic itself unlikely to have existed before the end of the 2nd millennium BC at the earliest. The genetic <b>evidence</b> <b>in</b> <b>this</b> case would show that the change to Celtic languages in Britain may have occurred as a cultural shift rather than through migration as was previously supposed.|$|E

500|$|There is {{a record}} of a gun in Europe dating to 1322 being {{discovered}} {{in the nineteenth century}} but the artifact has since been lost. The earliest known European depiction of a gun appeared in 1326 in a manuscript by Walter de Milemete, although not necessarily drawn by him, known as De Nobilitatibus, sapientii et prudentiis regum (Concerning the Majesty, Wisdom, and Prudence of Kings), which displays a gun with a large arrow emerging from it and its user lowering a long stick to ignite the gun through the touchole In the same year, another similar illustration showed a darker gun being set off by a group of knights, which also featured in another work of de Milemete's, De secretis secretorum Aristotelis. On 11 February of that same year, the Signoria of Florence appointed two officers to obtain canones de mettallo and ammunition for the town's defense. In the following year a document from the Turin area recorded a certain amount was paid [...] "for the making of a certain instrument or device made by Friar Marcello for the projection of pellets of lead." [...] A reference from 1331 describes an attack mounted by two Germanic knights on Cividale del Friuli, using gunpowder weapons of some sort. The 1320s seem to have been the takeoff point for guns in Europe according to most modern military historians. Scholars suggest that the lack of gunpowder weapons in a well-traveled Venetian's catalogue for a new crusade in 1321 implies that guns were unknown in Europe up until this point, further solidifying the 1320 mark, however more <b>evidence</b> <b>in</b> <b>this</b> area may be forthcoming in the future.|$|E
