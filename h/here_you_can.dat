25|$|About 57 {{percent of}} Russia is tundra—a treeless, marshy plain. The tundra is Russia's northernmost zone, {{stretching}} from the Finnish border {{in the west to}} the Bering Strait in the east, then running south along the Pacific coast to the northern Kamchatka Peninsula. The zone is known for its herds of wild reindeer, for so-called white nights (dusk at midnight, dawn shortly thereafter) in summer, and for days of total darkness in winter. The long, harsh winters and lack of sunshine allow only mosses, lichens, and dwarf willows and shrubs to sprout low above the barren permafrost. Although several powerful Siberian rivers traverse this zone as they flow northward to the Arctic Ocean, partial and intermittent thawing hamper drainage of the numerous lakes, ponds, and swamps of the tundra. Frost weathering is the most important physical process here, gradually shaping a landscape that was severely modified by glaciation in the last ice age. Less than one percent of Russia's population lives in this zone. The fishing and port industries of the northwestern Kola Peninsula and the huge oil and gas fields of northwestern Siberia are the largest employers in the tundra. With a population of 180,000, the industrial frontier city of Norilsk is second in population to Murmansk among Russia's settlements above the Arctic Circle. From <b>here</b> <b>you</b> <b>can</b> also see the auroras (northern lights).|$|E
500|$|The episode's plot {{involved}} {{the death of}} former boss Ed Truck, a character who had been played by Ken Howard in the second-season episode [...] "The Carpet". As part of the episode took place outdoors, the cast had to wear coats despite the hot summer weather. Actress Kate Flannery commented in a weekly blog she wrote for TV Guide that [...] "we suffered while shooting the outdoor scenes... We had to act like it was cold when it was warm. For hours and hours. You would never know it by looking at us. Isn't that crazy?" [...] Flannery also wrote, [...] "I love this episode because it's dark, for a comedy. This time The Office tackles gutsy subject matter." [...] In her memoir Is Everyone Hanging Out Without Me?, Mindy Kaling wrote that the episode resulted in the worst disagreement she ever had during her years on the show, where she and Greg Daniels, normally a [...] "very nice" [...] person, disagreed on a story point {{to the extent that}} Daniels told her that if [...] "you [...] going to resist what I'm doing <b>here,</b> <b>you</b> <b>can</b> just go home." [...] Kaling briefly left the set before returning, with no further problems or repercussions noted.|$|E
500|$|The stereo {{version of}} the song has an organ moving from speaker to speaker; the effect is lost on the mono {{version of the}} song, where it simply gains an extra organ and guitar sound. However, the organ is very {{prominent}} during the first 50 seconds of the mono version—along with some special effects—but inaudible in the stereo mix until the improvised section. Five takes of the song were originally recorded on 27 February 1967, with a sixth later recorded on 16 March 1967, {{in an attempt to}} create a shorter version, with overdubs in June of that year, the Piper version also appears on the official compilation albums Relics and A Nice Pair. Despite Smith trying to bring the rest of the album's tracks from a jam-long length to something more manageable, Smith relented for [...] "Interstellar Overdrive", as Jenner recalled: [...] "It was definitely the deal that—hey, <b>here</b> <b>you</b> <b>can</b> do 'Interstellar Overdrive', you can do what you like, you can do your weird shit. So 'Interstellar Overdrive' was the weird shit [...] [...] [...] and again, hats off to Norman for letting them do that." [...] A delay effect was created by producer Norman Smith by superimposing a second version of the song over a previous version. Smith played the drum roll on the song. After the drum roll, the opening riff is played with severe stereo panning.|$|E

2500|$|Greece {{has a good}} {{collection}} of euro commemorative coins, mainly in silver although a few coins have also been minted in gold. Their face value range from €10 to €200 euro. This is mainly done as a legacy of an old national practice of minting gold and silver coins. These coins are not really intended {{to be used as}} means of payment, so generally they do not circulate. <b>Here</b> <b>you</b> <b>can</b> find some samples: ...|$|E

[...] "Because I really like Toronto, I really like this organization … you can live here, you know? You feel like you have a life. I come to work, I go home, play with my kid, walk to the store. It's really nice. I get to teach. It's wonderful here." [...] In another interview, he expressed further desire to remain in the CFL, [...] "If I came back <b>here,</b> <b>you</b> <b>can</b> put me anywhere", he says. [...] "Up here, I can play offense, defense, special teams. I can do everything. I can block, play tight end, running back, receiver— even play the line. The NFL is so structured— 'You do this.'
