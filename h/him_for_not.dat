5|$|The cheese {{course was}} {{served by a}} Maître d'hôtel on a trolley. White's rules {{dictated}} that after lunch, the cheese was reviewed {{to ensure that a}} sufficient serving was left to present for the dinner seatings. One incident recounted in White's autobiography, was that upon being unsatisfied with the remaining portions of cheese as the Maître'd was attempting to take the trolley into the dining room for the evening service, the chef threw each cheese in turn {{against the wall of the}} kitchen while berating <b>him</b> <b>for</b> <b>not</b> replacing them. Due to the ripeness of the cheese, they remained glued to the wall for the rest of the service.|$|E

He kept quiet about 'is dreams for some time arter that, but it was no good, because George Hall, wot was a firm believer, gave <b>'im</b> a licking <b>for</b> <b>not</b> warning <b>'im</b> of a sprained ankle he got skylarking, and Bob Law took it out of <b>'im</b> <b>for</b> <b>not</b> telling <b>'im</b> that he was going to lose 'is suit of shore-going togs at cards.|$|R

5|$|As Belle {{is walking}} down the road, she runs into The Evil Queen (Lana Parrilla), who asks her if she is running from someone. Belle admits the man she is leaving is {{overcome}} by evil yet she loves him. The Evil Queen offers the solution: true love's kiss will break the curse. Belle returns to Rumpelstiltskin's castle and the Dark one asks why {{she came back to}} him. She replies that she wasn't going to return but something changed her mind. After a moment of silence between the two, they both share true love's kiss, the magic starts to turn him back into an ordinary man, but becomes furious and shakes off the magic, accusing Belle of conspiring with The Evil Queen. Rumpelstiltskin yells in a rage that no one will love him, and The Evil Queen will never take away his power. He throws Belle in his dungeon and smashes every cup against the wall but he cannot bring himself to destroy the chipped one. Once he has cooled off, he tells Belle to leave because his powers are more important to him than she is. Belle admonishes <b>him</b> <b>for</b> <b>not</b> believing she can love him. She warns him that he will regret his actions when all he has is an empty heart and a chipped cup.|$|E
5|$|Gilly and Steph {{take a walk}} {{round the}} village on bonfire night where she finally admits she's scared of dying, they have a heart to heart {{conversation}} where she realises she's it is how {{she is going to}} die that scares her. When the pair see restaurant Il Gnosh on fire, Gilly rings for help whilst Steph runs into the burning building to save Amy Barnes (Ashley Slanina-Davies) and her children. Gilly stands on a ladder outside and begs her to come out, however she tells him she's ready to die and walks back into the flames. Gilly deals with his grief by becoming angry that Steph has 'left' him. After Rhys tries to comfort him, Gilly goes into Steph's room and trashes it after seeing that she has still kept her photo of her and Max Cunningham (Matt Littler) on their wedding day, placed on a table. Gilly argues with Steph's family as they blame <b>him</b> <b>for</b> <b>not</b> saving her and disagree on the funeral arrangements. Frankie then tells him that Steph had never loved him and that Max would have done anything to save Steph from the fire, making him further deeply upset and angry. He starts drinking heavily, causing trouble on many occasions.|$|E
5|$|MacLaren {{began the}} 1902 season well and, facing an Ashes series against Australia, began {{planning}} for the Tests; he arranged to receive reports on prospective players from both sides. England dominated the first Test, scoring 376 and bowling Australia out for 36; rain prevented a result and also heavily curtailed the drawn second Test. The team for the third Test, played in Sheffield, was to be chosen from 12 players picked by the selectors, with the final place contested between Bill Lockwood and Schofield Haigh. However, {{on the morning of}} the match, MacLaren, with the approval of the selector Lord Hawke, summoned Barnes from Manchester to play instead of either. The move was unpopular with spectators—their favoured choice, Haigh, was a Yorkshire player—but Barnes took six wickets in the first innings, although injury reduced his effectiveness in the second innings. England were bowled out in poor light—MacLaren's biographer Michael Down suggests that part of the blame lies with <b>him</b> <b>for</b> <b>not</b> appealing against the light—and needed an unlikely 339 runs to win in their second innings. MacLaren changed the batting order, asking Gilbert Jessop to open the batting. Jessop scored fifty, and MacLaren scored 63, but England lost by 143 runs.|$|E

5|$|Many {{basketball}} analysts, coaches, fans, {{and current}} and former players consider James {{to be one of}} the greatest players of all-time, often ranking him as the best small forward and in the top five overall. He has earned All-NBA honors every season since his sophomore year, All-Defensive honors every season from 2009 to 2014, and was named Rookie of the Year in his debut season. With four MVP awards, he is part of a select group of players who have won the award four times, including Kareem Abdul-Jabbar, Jordan, Wilt Chamberlain, and Bill Russell; James and Russell are the only two players who have won four MVP awards in a five-year span. While James has never won the Defensive Player of the Year Award, he has finished second in the voting twice and lists it as one of his main goals. James has appeared in the Finals eight times and won three championships. Some analysts have criticized <b>him</b> <b>for</b> <b>not</b> having a better Finals record, while others have defended him, arguing that James usually performed well but was defeated by superior competition.|$|E
5|$|The Town of Christchurch {{by-election}} in 1860 {{was triggered}} by the resignation of Richard Packer as the Member of the House of Representatives for the Town of Christchurch electorate, and occurred during the term of the 2nd New Zealand Parliament. The previous representative of the electorate, the politician Henry Sewell, had returned after three years in England and the general expectation was that Sewell would be the sole contender for election. The Lyttelton Times wrote several provocative editorials, generally endorsing Sewell for his obvious ability, but criticising <b>him</b> <b>for</b> <b>not</b> publicly talking about his policies and plans. Sewell eventually arranged a public meeting the evening prior to nomination day; {{this was the only}} public meeting during the election campaign. After a lengthy address, which was favourably received by the Lyttelton Times, a second contender for the office put his name forward at that meeting: the publican Michael Hart. Sewell, a former premier and one of New Zealand's most senior politicians at the time, was successful against the political novice Hart.|$|E
5|$|The halt of the Third Army {{during the}} month of September was enough to allow the Germans to {{strengthen}} the fortress of Metz. In October and November, the Third Army was mired in a near-stalemate with the Germans during the Battle of Metz, both sides suffering heavy casualties. An attempt by Patton to seize Fort Driant just south of Metz was defeated, but by mid-November Metz had fallen to the Americans. Patton's decisions in taking this city were criticized. German commanders interviewed after the war noted he could have bypassed the city and moved north to Luxembourg where he {{would have been able to}} cut off the German Seventh Army. The German commander of Metz, General Hermann Balck, also noted that a more direct attack would have resulted in a more decisive Allied victory in the city. Historian Carlo D'Este later wrote that the Lorraine Campaign was one of Patton's least successful, faulting <b>him</b> <b>for</b> <b>not</b> deploying his divisions more aggressively and decisively.|$|E

5|$|The next morning, the two {{visit the}} Ghats as Sahil had planned. He takes Jai to an {{overhanging}} cliff, with a scenic view of Mahabaleshwar, {{where the two}} share a quiet moment. On returning to their resort, Jai offers {{to pay for the}} trip's expenses, to which Sahil agrees after some initial reluctance. The two return to a hotel in Mumbai for Jai's scheduled business meeting. At the hotel room, the two admit to their mutual attraction right before Jai has to leave for his meeting. Sahil interrupts Jai and his clients and embarrasses the latter with a romantic gesture in front of everyone. This leads to a confrontation between the two, during which Sahil accuses Jai of being scared of coming out to the world. On the contrary, Jai blames <b>him</b> <b>for</b> <b>not</b> reciprocating his affection from the beginning. The two kiss, but when Sahil tries to withdraw from him, Jai rapes him, only to immediately regret it. He apologises and tells Sahil that he doesn't have to stay any longer if he doesn't want to. However, Sahil decides to stay, but refrains from having a conversation with Jai.|$|E
25|$|In late July, Ewell {{was furious}} {{when he heard}} that his {{commanding}} officer, P. G. T. Beauregard, was blaming <b>him</b> <b>for</b> <b>not</b> following orders at Bull Run, when in fact, the orders never reached him in time.|$|E
25|$|Shen {{supported}} {{reward for}} visible results, using ming-shih for investigation and appointment, but {{the legal system}} of Han was apparently confused, prohibiting uniform reward and punishment.

25|$|Black Hawk's {{frequent}} rival was Keokuk, a Sauk war chief held in high esteem by the U.S. government. Officials {{believed that}} he was calm and reasonable, willing to negotiate, unlike Black Hawk. Black Hawk despised Keokuk, and viewed him as cowardly and self-serving, at one point threatening to kill <b>him</b> <b>for</b> <b>not</b> defending Saukenuk. After the Black Hawk War, US officials designated Keokuk as the main Sauk leader and would only deal with him.|$|E
25|$|Loison was {{assigned}} to guard the fortress of Wesel in 1813. But Napoleon arrested <b>him</b> <b>for</b> <b>not</b> marching with his division to the front. After this severe reprimand, his military career was over except for a short-term assignment under Marshal Louis-Nicolas Davout. Unemployed after January 1815, he retired in November of the same year. On 30 December 1816 he died at Chokier near Liège in present-day Belgium. LOISON is inscribed on Column 35 of the Arc de Triomphe.|$|E
25|$|The next day, {{instead of}} the {{scheduled}} pro domo, the Assembly registered his resignation. Founding the independent newspaper Dreptatea, Fleva turned on his former colleagues in power. In early 1896, he attacked Sturdza for his external policy, creating a scandal about the selective sponsoring of Aromanian schools throughout the Balkans. In his anti-Sturdza campaign, Fleva approached the country's breakaway socialist clubs. Some socialists did join his faction, but others condemned <b>him</b> <b>for</b> <b>not</b> supporting the immediate adoption of universal suffrage.|$|E

25|$|At first a ballad, it {{was written}} by Redding for Speedo Sims, who {{intended}} to record it with his band, the Singing Demons. Redding rewrote the lyrics and sped up the rhythm. Speedo then went with band to the Muscle Shoals studios, but was unable to produce a good version. Redding then decided to sing the song himself, which Speedo agreed to. Redding also promised to credit Speedo on the liner notes, but this never happened; Speedo, however, never charged <b>him</b> <b>for</b> <b>not</b> doing so.|$|E
25|$|Ibrahim {{was born}} in a house of idolaters in the ancient city of Ur of the Chaldees, likely the place called 'Ur' in present-day Iraq, in which case, the idolaters would have been {{practitioners}} of the hypothesized Ancient Mesopotamian religion. His father Azar was a well-known idol-sculptor that his people worshiped. As a young child, Ibrahim used to watch his father sculpting these idols from stones or wood. When his father was done with them, Ibrahim would ask his father why they could not move or respond to any request and then would mock them; therefore, his father always ground <b>him</b> <b>for</b> <b>not</b> following his ancestors's rituals and mocking their idols.|$|E
25|$|Colville's {{services}} were well-rewarded; {{he received a}} cross with one clasp; he was made a K.C.B. in January and a G.C.B. in March, 1815; he was appointed colonel of the 94th regiment in April 1815. When the return of Napoleon from Elba made it necessary for a British army {{to be sent to}} the continent, he was made a local lieutenant-general in the Netherlands at Wellington's special request, and took command of the 4th Division there. Colville's division was posted on the extreme right of the British division at Halle during the Battle of Waterloo. To compensate <b>him</b> <b>for</b> <b>not</b> being more actively engaged there, Wellington gave him the duty of storming Cambrai, the only French fortress which did not immediately surrender. He succeeded with the loss of only thirty men killed and wounded.|$|E
