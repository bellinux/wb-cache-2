It involved the <b>duty-free</b> <b>imports</b> from Hong Kong of 90,000 Japanese-made cars and trucks {{at a cost of}} ¥4.5 billion (US$1.5 billion), and exporting them – with the help of local naval units – to the mainland, making 150% profits. By comparison, only 10,000 vehicles were imported into Hainan since 1950. In addition, it involved further consignments of 2.9 million TV sets, 252,000 videocassette recorders & 122,000 motorcycles.

50|$|Caribbean Basin Economic Recovery Act of 1983 (CBERA) — P.L. 98-67 (August 5, 1983), Title II, {{authorized}} unilateral {{preferential trade}} and tax benefits for eligible Caribbean countries, including duty-free treatment of eligible products. Often {{referred to as}} the Caribbean Basin Initiative (CBI). Amended several times, the last substantive revisions were made in the Caribbean Basin Economic Recovery Expansion Act of 1990 (P.L. 101-382, Title II, August 20, 1990). This made trade benefits permanent (repealing the September 30, 1995 termination date). The law gives preferential trade and tax benefits for eligible Caribbean countries, including duty-free entry of eligible products. To be eligible, an article must be a product of a beneficiary country and imported directly from it, and at least 35% of its import value must have originated in one or more CBERA beneficiaries. Slightly different import value rules apply to articles entering from Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands. The <b>duty-free</b> <b>import</b> of sugar and beef products is subject to a special eligibility requirement intended to ensure that increased production of sugar and beef will not adversely affect overall food production. Preferential tariff treatment does not extend to imports of: textiles and apparel subject to textile agreements, specified footwear, canned tuna, petroleum and its products, and watches or watch parts containing any material originating in countries denied normal trade relations (most-favored-nation) trade status. Special criteria applied to the <b>duty-free</b> <b>import</b> of ethanol through FY2000. Import-sensitive products, not accorded duty-free tariff treatment, are eligible to enter at lower than normal trade relations tariff rates. These products include handbags, luggage, flat goods (such as wallets, change purses, and key and eyeglass cases), work gloves, and certain leather wearing apparel.|$|R

40|$|This {{bachelor}} thesis {{deals with}} {{role of the}} United States of America and their citizens during overthrow of the Hawaiian government in 1893. Hawaiian Islands represented strategic location for the United States for further expansion into the Pacific region. Americans, living in Hawaii, were interested in close cooperation with the United States to empower their own positions. Efforts of American expansionists and Hawaiian Americans resulted in two reciprocal treaties, approved in 1876 and 1887, which provided <b>duty-free</b> <b>import</b> of Hawaiian sugar in the United States in exchange for partial loss of sovereignty. Hawaiian economy reoriented to sugar trade and was vulnerable against any changes in American import policy. As a result of McKinley tariff bill's approval in 1890 Hawaiian Americans lost their advantages in sugar imports into the United States. Their last resort to save their property and sugar business was to annex the Hawaiian Islands to the United States. The thesis aims to evaluate the role of American groups in Hawaii which participated in the overthrow, {{as well as the}} United States' governments and their attitude towards the overthrow and the annexation afterwards which differed based on party affiliation...|$|R
40|$|On 29 November 2005, the European Union (EU) {{unilaterally}} {{introduced a}} tariff of € 176 per tonne to apply from 1 January 2006 to bananas imported from countries enjoying the Most Favoured Nation (MFN) status. The new EU trade policy includes a <b>duty-free</b> annual <b>import</b> quota of 775, 000 tonnes for bananas originating from African, Caribbean and Pacific (ACP) states. This regime replaces the very complex and highly contested tariff-rate quota policy {{in place in}} the EU between 1993 and 2005. However, the banana international trade war very likely has not come to an end. Several Latin American countries have announced their intention to challenge the new EU trade policy by initiating a new WTO complaint. In this paper, we first propose an analysis of the two WTO arbitration awards that ruled against the initial EU tariff proposals. We show that the arbitrators’ awards are incomplete notably because they do not explain why CIF (Cost, Insurance and Freight) import unit values in the EU- 15 from MFN suppliers are much higher than FOB (Free on Board) export unit values in corresponding MFN countries adjusted by all relevant costs that should theoretically be added to transform FOB into CIF prices. One plausible explanation to this apparent paradox is that reported CIF prices include at least part of quota rents generated by the tariff-rate quota policy. On this basis, we analyse the impacts of different MFN tariff levels on EU banana imports under contrasting hypotheses regarding, first whether the price gap between CIF and FOB unit values does include at least part of quota rents, second whether banana exports to the EU from Western African ACP countries were constrained under the previous regime where a specific import quota were reserved to ACP countries. We also analyse the consequences of an “augmented” tariff-only import regime including a MFN tariff and a <b>duty-free</b> <b>import</b> quota for ACP bananas...|$|R

Moreover, the analysis in this paper suggests that the concerns about job loss in the U. S. textile industry from broader coverage are exaggerated.

40|$|The rise of China {{has been}} a major feature of the global {{economic}} landscape for the last three decades. Research carried out at the CEPII has amply shown how the integration of China’s economy into the world economy has produced dramatic changes in its foreign trade and led to a far-reaching reshuffle of international trade. It has also argued that China’s extraordinary export performance could not provide by itself a sound base for its long-term development. In 2009, China has become the leading world exporter. The expansion of China’s exports was made possible by a rapid diversification, from textile to electronics. This has also resulted in China becoming the world top exporter of high-technology products since 2004, ahead of the US since 2003. The degree of sophistication of China’s exports is now similar to that of a country with a level of income per capita three times higher. These spectacular achievements originate mainly from foreign firm affiliates located in China carrying international processing activities, i. e. assembling <b>duty-free</b> <b>imported</b> inputs for exports. Foreign affiliates are responsible for half of China’s trade and 80 % of its high-technology exports. During the past decade, the gap between the export performance of foreign and domestic firms has widened both in terms of sophistication and technological levels.
