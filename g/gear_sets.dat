25|$|A dual-clutch transmission, (DCT) (sometimes {{referred}} to as a twin-clutch transmission or double-clutch transmission), is a type of automatic transmission or automated automotive transmission. It uses two separate clutches for odd and even <b>gear</b> <b>sets.</b> It can fundamentally be described as two separate manual transmissions with their respective clutches contained within one housing, and working as one unit. Although usually operated in a fully automatic mode, many also have the ability to allow the driver to manually shift gears in semi-automatic mode, albeit still using the transmission's electrohydraulics.|$|E
25|$|<b>Gear</b> <b>sets</b> may be {{replaced}} with closer ratios to keep the engine in the power band, or, on some cars that produce enough power and torque to four-gear transmissions {{similar to the ones}} used in NASCAR (such as the Andrews four-speed dog box that Vaughn Gittin Jr. ran in his 2016 Mustang) with more open-ratio gears, this limits the number of shifts the driver has to do during their run. These may be coarser dog engagement straight cut gears instead of synchronised helical gears, for durability and faster shifting at the expense of noise and refinement. Wealthier drifters may use sequential gearboxes to make gear selection easier and faster, while sequential shift lever adapters {{can be used to make}} shifts easier without increasing shift time.|$|E

40|$|In {{the process}} of form grinding, <b>gear</b> <b>setting</b> error was the main factor that {{influenced}} the form grinding accuracy; we proposed an effective method to improve form grinding accuracy that corrected the error by controlling the machine operations. Based on establishing the geometry model of form grinding and representing the <b>gear</b> <b>setting</b> errors as homogeneous coordinate, tooth mathematic model was obtained and simplified under the <b>gear</b> <b>setting</b> error. Then, according to the gear standard of ISO 1328 - 1 : 1997 and the ANSI/AGMA 2015 - 1 -A 01 : 2002, the relationship was investigated by changing the <b>gear</b> <b>setting</b> errors with respect to tooth profile deviation, helix deviation, and cumulative pitch deviation, respectively, under the condition of gear eccentricity error, gear inclination error, and gear resultant error. An error compensation method was proposed based on solving sensitivity coefficient matrix of setting error in a five-axis CNC form grinding machine; simulation and experimental results demonstrated that the method can effectively correct the <b>gear</b> <b>setting</b> error, as well as further improving the forming grinding accuracy...|$|R
40|$|A {{mathematical}} model is developed for surface fatigue life of helical gears. The expected fatigue {{life of a}} pinion, <b>gear,</b> or <b>gear</b> <b>set</b> may be calculated from the model. An equation for the dynamic capacity of a <b>gear</b> <b>set</b> was also derived. Dynamic capacity is the transmitted tangential load which gives a 90 percent probability of survival of the <b>gear</b> <b>set</b> for one million pinion revolutions. The equations, when simplified by setting the helix angle to zero, reduce to the results which were previously developed for spur gears. A sample calculation is given which illustrates {{the use of the}} new fatigue life model...|$|R

2500|$|The Gear System was {{designed}} to encourage players to develop unique personal playstyles, while consistently rewarding them for investing time into the game. According to Goodman, the developers wanted the Gear System to cater to both the casual and hardcore audiences. They hoped that hardcore players would appreciate the different mechanics offered by the system and create new strategies and fighting styles for each character, while casual players would enjoy the variety of visual customization options. NetherRealm also foresaw the potential issue with newer players being dominated by veteran players who have obtained rarer <b>gear</b> <b>sets.</b> To address this, the developers attempted to implement various solutions, such as giving players the option to disable stat modifiers during matches {{and the ability to}} buy rarer gear through the assorted tiers of Mother Boxes.

In this study, a coupled lateral and torsional dynamic model is established to predict the modulation sidebands of a two-stage compound planetary <b>gear</b> <b>set.</b> An improved potential energy method {{is used to calculate}} the time-varying mesh stiffness of each gear pair, and the influence of crack propagation on the mesh stiffness is analyzed.

2500|$|The 45RFE and 545RFE {{automatic}} transmission in the WJ was notable. It included three planetary <b>gear</b> <b>sets</b> {{rather than the}} two normally used in a four-speed automatic. This gave it six theoretical speeds, {{and it would have}} been the first six-speed transmission ever produced in volume, but it was programmed to only use five of these ratios. Four were used for upshifts, with a different second gear for downshifts. Although five of the six ratios were used, Chrysler decided to call it a [...] "4-speed automatic". In 2001, the programming was changed to make use of all six ratios. Rather than have six forward gears, the transmission was programmed to act as a five-speed with the alternate second gear for downshifts. The rpm at [...] on a 545RFE is 2000 rpm, 200 rpm less than the 45RFE programming. 1999 and 2000 model year WJ owners can have their 45RFE transmission's programming flashed to enable the extra gear as both transmissions are physically the same. (Must purchase new PCM and ABS module and program them with a fake VIN to make this work.) The 42RE 4-speed automatic remained the transmission for the Inline 6 engine. It had slight changes from the previous model Grand Cherokee.|$|E

For the planetary <b>gear</b> <b>set,</b> it is complicated to model the misalignment error of carrier as, when this error is present, the planets and the carrier are tilted and contacts between sun–planet and ring–planet along tooth width are skewed. In this paper, a new lumped parameter model is set up to quasi-statically and dynamic analyze the planetary <b>gear</b> <b>set</b> with the position-dependent line of action due to the misalignment of the carrier. In the analytical model, each potential line of contact on the gear mesh is discretized into finite independent time-varying stiffness.
