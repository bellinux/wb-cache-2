5|$|Chamberlain saw his {{elevation}} to the premiership as {{the final}} glory in {{a career as a}} domestic reformer, not realising that he would be remembered for foreign policy decisions.

5|$|At {{the same}} time as Ferdinand, Tac HQ ran Otterington. This {{deception}} built a threat against Rimini in the east of Italy, in support of Alexander's proposed assault on the centre of the Gothic Line. It developed a pincer movement, in tandem with Ferdinand's threat to the west. However, once Otterington had gotten underway, with a major buildup of dummy armour, Alexander changed his plans and decided to push against Rimini. Clarke hastily implemented Ulster, a double bluff in which Otterington was revealed as a sham in the <b>hope</b> <b>it</b> would distract attention from that sector.|$|E

5|$|The poem is {{described}} as a poem of water and <b>hope.</b> <b>It</b> begins with images of the sea, water, and of Eliot's past; this water later becomes a metaphor for life and how humans act. This transitions into an image of a ringing bell and a discussion on time and prayer. Images of men drowning dominate the section before leading into how science and ideas on evolution separate mankind from properly understanding the past. This ends with Krishna stating that the divine will, and not future benefits or rewards, matters. The fourth section is a prayer to the Virgin Mary for fishermen, sailors, and the drowned.|$|E

25|$|An anecdote {{often told}} of Zwicky {{concerns}} an informal experiment {{to see if}} he could reduce problems with turbulence hindering an observation session one night at Mount Wilson observatory. He told his assistant to fire a gun out through the telescope slit, in the <b>hope</b> <b>it</b> would help to smooth out the turbulence. No effect was noticed, but the event shows the kind of lateral thinking for which Zwicky was famous.|$|E

25|$|With {{the growth}} of the {{wellness}} industry in recent years, social media platforms have witnessed an assortment of fitness influencers and trends. Followers obsessively pursue these diet and exercise regimes posted as a way to remain healthy, while the influencers <b>hope</b> <b>it</b> generates body positivity in return. Yet, these bloggers and companies have received numerous criticism because the “drive for “wellness” and “clean eating” has become stealthy covers for more dieting and deprivation”. Likewise, reports have also shown that the messages delivered by “fitspiration” websites are sometimes identical to the “thinspiration” or pro-anorexia types. This is evident through “language inducing guilt about weight or the body, and promoted dieting”. Although the wellness trend may not lead to eating disorders, the marketing of restrictive diets to young women as a form of self care could potentially cause “increasingly disordered eating” , whereby they became more concerned with ingredients and limited certain types of food. This illness is better known as Orthorexia; which is the obsession with the right and wrong types of food.|$|E
25|$|In {{his famous}} work, Adhyatmopanisatprakarana {{he argued that}} no body of ‘theory’ (sastra), whether Jain or non-Jain, is to be {{accepted}} merely {{on the basis of}} sectarian interest. Instead, the theory should be subject to testing, just as the purity of a sample of gold is determined by tests involving rubbing, cutting and heating (1.17) In one of the ethical works, the Jnanasara, Yashovijaya describes 32 moral and intellectual virtues that constitute a virtuous character. Out of these, two are distinctive: neutrality (madhyasthata) and groundedness in all view-points (sarvanayasraya). Neutrality is explained in terms of the dispassionate use of reason: a person who embodies this virtue follows wherever reason leads, rather than using reason only to defend prior opinions (16.2). Yashovijaya stresses that neutrality is not an end in itself, but a means to another end. We adopt a neutral attitude, he says, in the <b>hope</b> <b>it</b> leads to well-being (hita), just as someone who knows that one among a group of herbs is restorative but does not know which one it is, acts reasonably if they swallow the entire lot (16.8).|$|E
25|$|With {{the aim of}} {{protecting}} models and projecting a healthier body image, Spain, Italy, Brazil, and Israel, “passed bills that prohibit models from working with a Body Mass Index (BMI) below 18.5”. The UK and U.S., chose to use less compelling tactics of cultivating the general public through the promotion of education campaigns in society. France on the other hand, introduced a new regulation this year preventing the employment of extremely skinny models, {{and the need for}} a medical certificate to verify their health. This was an update to the previous law passed that prohibited agencies from using models with a BMI lower than 18. France is also working on ensuring retailers specify airbrushed images in magazines, websites, and advertisements. However, some argue that these laws may not be effective as, majority of individuals are already aware of digital retouching techniques, and may even use it themselves. Due to the criticisms surrounding the glamourising of eating disorders, brands are actively playing their part in cultivating better body images too. Fashion conglomerates; Kering and LVMH, recently “announced that they will no longer hire models smaller than a U.S. size 2”. Not only will this improve the working conditions of models, both companies <b>hope</b> <b>it</b> may inspire others to follow suit. Although, the industry is moving in the right direction, it is arguable that the banning of size zero could be seen as a discriminatory act; similar to thin shaming. For that reasons, focus should be placed on altering beauty norms, rather than blame the wearer for their size. Moreover, the announcement of a small and minimum dress size, which does not fit the average body type of most countries, continues to “send the message that super slim body types is the ‘ideal’”.|$|E
