Knöchlein's defence hinged on {{the claim that}} he was not present at the massacre, {{although}} his lawyers did not <b>deny</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> event took place. They also claimed that the British had used dumdum bullets during the battle and misused a flag of truce; all of which were vigorously denied by the prosecution. Evidence was given by Pooley, O'Callaghan, Madame Duquenne-Creton, and a French civilian who testified to recognising Knöchlein.|$|E

5|$|The most {{frequently}} used argument in favour of dualism appeals to the common-sense intuition that conscious experience is distinct from inanimate matter. If asked what the mind is, the average person would usually respond by identifying it with their self, their personality, their soul, or some other such entity. They would almost certainly <b>deny</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> mind simply is the brain, or vice versa, finding {{the idea that there}} is just one ontological entity at play to be too mechanistic, or simply unintelligible. Many modern philosophers of mind think that these intuitions are misleading and that we should use our critical faculties, along with empirical evidence from the sciences, to examine these assumptions to determine whether there is any real basis to them.|$|E
5|$|Operation Medak Pocket {{took place}} in a salient south of Gospić, from September 9–17. The {{offensive}} was undertaken by the Croatian army to stop Serbian artillery in the area from shelling nearby Gospić. The operation met its stated objective of removing the artillery threat, as Croatian troops overran the salient, but it was marred by war crimes. The ICTY later indicted Croatian officers for war crimes. The operation was halted amid international pressure, and an agreement was reached that the Croatian troops were to withdraw to positions held prior to September 9, while UN troops were to occupy the salient alone. The events that followed remain controversial, as Canadian authorities reported that the Croatian army intermittently fought against the advancing Canadian Princess Patricia's Canadian Light Infantry before finally retreating after sustaining 27 fatalities. The Croatian ministry of defense and UN officer's testimonies given during the Ademi-Norac trial <b>deny</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> battle occurred.|$|E
5|$|The {{role of the}} Venizelists {{during the}} battle has been {{intensely}} contested by witnesses and historians. Vice admiral Louis Dartige du Fournet wrote that Venizelists supported the Allies and attacked passing Greek royalist army units. Venizelists participation was allegedly so extensive, that lead Admiral du Fourne wrote in his report {{that he had been}} involved in a civil war. The Venizelists continued fighting after the evacuation of the Allied marines until the next day, when they capitulated. The royalists claimed that large caches of weapons and ammunition were found in their strongholds packed in French military containers. Venizelists were led to prison surrounded by a furious mob and supposedly only the royal army escorts saved them from being murdered by the angry citizens. Other historians <b>deny</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> Venizelists collaborated with the Allied forces: Pavlos Karolidis, a contemporary royalist historian, argues that no Venizelist attacked their fellow citizens and the only weapons found during the raids on prominent Venizelists' houses were knives.|$|E

25|$|The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy and the New Catholic Encyclopedia give two {{possible}} replies to these objections.

Berezovsky confirmed that he met Yushchenko's representatives in London before the election, and that the money was transferred from his companies, {{but he refused to}} confirm or <b>deny</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> money was used in Yushchenko's campaign.

25|$|However, unnamed U.S. {{officials}} {{continued to}} <b>deny</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> shooting {{down of the}} satellite {{was in response to}} China’s ASAT test one year prior, or that they were trying to protect classified satellite technology. U.S. Officials pointed out that the U.S. had no reason to prove that it could shoot down a satellite, as the U.S. had already publicly done so in the 1980s. Another key difference pointed out by General Cartwright was that this intercept happened at a much lower altitude, whereas China’s ASAT weapon destroyed a target at a much higher altitude, which resulting in the creation of debris which continues to pose a potential hazard to other spacecraft. Finally, U.S. officials again affirmed that the mission’s intent was to preserve human life.|$|E
25|$|The {{ichthyosaur}} pelvis {{is typically}} rather reduced. The three pelvic bones: the ilium, the ischium, and the pubic bone, are not fused and {{often do not}} even touch each other. Also, {{the left and right}} pelvic sides do not longer touch; only basal forms still have sacral ribs connecting the ilia to the vertebral column. The hip joint is not closed on the inside. The pubic bone typically does not connect to the ischium behind it; the space in between is by some workers identified as the fenestra thyreoidea; other researchers <b>deny</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> term is applicable given the general loose structure of the pelvis. Some later species have a connected pubic bone and ischium, but in this case, the femoral head no longer articulates with the hip joint. Triassic species have plate-like pubic bones and ischia; in later species these elements become elongated with a narrow shaft and can form a single rod.|$|E
25|$|Throughout the interwar period, Arab nationalists bore Germany no ill-will, {{despite its}} earlier {{support for the}} Ottoman Empire. Like many Arab countries, it was {{perceived}} {{as a victim of}} the post-World War I settlement. Hitler himself often spoke of the 'infamy of Versailles'. Unlike France and Great Britain it had not exercised imperial designs on the Middle East, and its past policy of non-intervention was interpreted as a token of good will. While the scholarly consensus is that Husseini's motives for supporting the Axis powers and his alliance with Nazi Germany and Fascist Italy were deeply inflected by anti-Jewish and anti-Zionist ideology from the outset, some scholars, notably Renzo De Felice, <b>deny</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> relationship can be taken to reflect a putative affinity of Arab nationalism with Nazi/Fascist ideology, and that men like Husseini chose them as allies for purely strategic reasons, on the grounds that, as Husseini later wrote in his memoirs, 'the enemy of your enemy is your friend'.Translation: 'I have considered Germany to be a friendly country, because it was not a colonizing country, and it never harmed any Arab or Islamic country, and because it was fighting our colonialist and Zionist enemies, and because the enemy of your enemy is your friend. And I was certain that Germany's victory would definitely save our countries from the danger of Zionism and colonization'.Mudhakkirat al-Hajj Amin al-Husayni, Damascus 1999 p.96. When Husseini eventually met with Hitler and Ribbentrop in 1941, he assured Hitler that 'The Arabs were Germany's natural friends because they had the same enemies... namely the English, the Jews, and the Communists'.|$|E

500|$|Apart from {{geographical}} scope, {{some historians}} including Kasahara <b>deny</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> massacre ended in early February and instead put the end date at March 28, though {{such a long}} time range is disputed by other historians. On the other hand, at least one historian has noted that the atrocity in Nanking could be equated with the entire war waged by Japan on China. By this definition the [...] "Nanking Massacre" [...] can symbolically be said to have lasted from 1931 to 1945, extended over the whole of China, and included ten million victims.|$|E
500|$|The Irish {{thought of}} Scotland as a provincial place. Others {{thought of it}} as an outlandish or barbaric place. [...] "Who would <b>deny</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> Scots are barbarians?"

[...] The phrase is again referenced when Duffy writes [...] "Dulce— No— Decorum— No— Pro patria mori."
