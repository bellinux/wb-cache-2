40|$|Background: The use of {{indwelling}} devices like Urinary catheter, <b>Drain</b> <b>tubes,</b> Central intravascular catheter, endotracheal tubes {{has become}} routine {{practice in the}} medical field. Localized or systematic infection are frequent complications associated with extensive use of these devices, requiring its removal or may even be associated with life threatening consequences. Materials and Methods: Microbiological study was carried out among all the indwelling device samples received from 20 th April 2011 to 19 th April 2012 at Clinical Microbiology Laboratory, Department of Pathology, Kathmandu Medical College Teaching Hospital. Results: Out of total 205 samples (125 Foley’s catheters, 31 <b>drain</b> <b>tubes,</b> 29 central intravascular catheter lines and 20 endotracheal tubes) received during this study period, 38. 4 % urinary catheters, 23. 33 % <b>drain</b> <b>tubes,</b> 6. 9 % central intravascular catheter lines and 40. 0 % endotracheal tubes {{were found to have}} significant growth. Escherichia coli and Klebsiella were found to be the commonest organisms. Conclusion: The infection rates of indwelling devices used for various reasons are found to be very high. These infections have increased the morbidity and mortality of the hospitalized patients and also increased the duration of hospital stay. Thus aseptic measurements during insertion of these devices periodic change of these devices may help to overcome these complications.

50|$|Once in the {{operating}} room and asleep, a catheter and IV's are inserted. Since the spine is not being exposed, a scope is inserted into the body. The scope has a tiny camera on the end of it and this lets the surgeon watch the surgery as he performs it on a television. Usually about five, one inch incisions are made and one 5-inch incision across the back of the hip. The lung is deflated and pushed aside, and a breathing tube is inserted into the deflated lung to help assist the patient in breathing. Once the lung is aside the surgeon removes the amount of discs needed for the fusion. Each patient is different in the number of discs needed to be removed. Bone from the patient's hip is then inserted right where the discs used to be. Screws are then inserted along the spine from the inside of the rib cage. These screws act as anchors for the rod. A rod is then inserted through the holes in the head of the screws. This is done slowly as to not aggravate the spinal cord. The lung is re-inflated and the breathing tube removed. However, a <b>drain</b> <b>tube</b> is inserted to drain excess liquid from the lungs. The patient is then moved to the Intensive Care Unit and then to a recovery room.|$|E
5000|$|Patients are {{typically}} {{discharged from the}} hospital with sutures (stitches) at the incision site, and a small <b>drain</b> <b>tube</b> placed behind the ear. [...] The tube is connected to a plastic bulb, which collects blood, serum, and saliva from the wound. Sutures {{are typically}} removed between the fourth and sixth day post-surgery. [...] After suture removal, the patient is typically seen in the clinic two-four weeks until healing is complete. If a biopsy is taken, pathology results typically may be reviewed in three-five business days in the clinic. Long-term follow-up will be determined {{based on the results}} of the pathology. Most patients with benign tumors are followed every three-six months for two years and yearly thereafter. Patients with malignant tumors may be followed every two-three months for two years, and then every six months for five years after procedure. [...] Not every patient heals in exactly the same way, which is why dates of removal for the drain or sutures are based upon each specific patient and case. Should the patient have difficulty smiling, winking, or consuming fluids, the physician should be contacted immediately, as these are common signs of facial nerve damage. [...] Mild facial numbness and weakness are normal immediately after a parotidectomy, with symptoms usually subsiding within a few months. [...] Most patients regain full facial function within one year of the procedure.|$|E

40|$|Most {{drainage}} theories {{ignore the}} effect of <b>drain</b> <b>tube</b> openings on water table drawdown. Kirkham and Schwab (1951) and Schwab and Kirkham (1951) developed methods for predicting {{the effect of}} circular openings in drain tubes on drainage rates for ponded surface conditions. Their results showed that drainage rates for standard drain tubes are typically 50 to 60 % of those for a completely open tube. The effects of the perforation area on drawdown and transient drainage rates are smaller than on drainage rates under ponded conditions (Skaggs, 1978). However, the effect may still be important. Some tubing companies advertise the advantages of large perforation areas. Agencies such as the US Soil Conservation Service (1977) and the Bureau of Reclamation (1978) require a minimum water entry area of 21 cm 2 /m.

Over four weeks, {{the appearance of the}} serous fluid changed to a greenish bile color and the patient persistently drained over 300 ml/day. Viewed as bile leak at the choledochojejunostomy, treatment called for endoscopic diagnosis and therapy. Cap-fitted forward-viewing endoscopy demonstrated that the distal tip of a pancreatic drain catheter inserted at the pancreaticojejunostomy site had penetrated the opposite jejunum wall. One of the drain tubes primarily placed in the retroperitoneum had also penetrated the jejunum wall, with the distal tip positioned near the choledochojejunostomy site. No leak of contrast appeared beyond the jejunum or anastomosis site. Following repositioning of a penetrating catheter of the pancreaticojejunostomy, four days later, the patient underwent removal of two drain tubes without additional complications. In conclusion, the distal tip of the catheter, placed to drain pancreatic juice, penetrated the jejunum wall and may have caused localized perijejunal inflammation. The other <b>drain</b> <b>tube,</b> placed in the retroperitoneal space, might then have penetrated the inflamed wall of the jejunum, allowing persistent bile drainage via the <b>drain</b> <b>tube.</b> The results masqueraded as bile leakage following pancreaticoduodenectomy...|$|E

We compared classical digital placement of PLMA TM with gum elastic bougie-aided technique in 60 anaesthetised adult patients (with 30 patients in each group) with respect to number of attempts to successful placement, effective airway time, airway trauma during insertion, postoperative airway morbidity and haemodynamic response to insertion. The number of attempts to successful placement, airway trauma during insertion and haemodynamic response to insertion were comparable among the two groups, while effective airway time and oropharyngeal leak pressure were significantly higher in bougie- guided insertion of PLMA.

40|$|Background and Aims: The ProSeal™ {{laryngeal}} mask airway (PLMA) has advantages of providing better cuff seal {{and the presence}} of a gastric <b>drain</b> <b>tube.</b> The manufacturer recommends actual body weight (ABW) for size selection. Pharyngeal area reduces with increase in body mass index (BMI); hence, in overweight patients, PLMA selected on ABW may not fit well. We hypothesised that the ideal body weight (IBW) would be more appropriate in size selection of PLMA. Methods: This randomised, single-blind study included 124 patients of 20 – 60 years and American Society of Anesthesiologists Class I–II, with BMI> 25. Patients were randomly divided into two groups. In Group ABW, PLMA was selected based on ABW (62 patients) and in Group IBW, PLMA was selected based on IBW (62 patients). The primary outcome was the first-attempt insertion success rate. Oropharyngeal air leaks, gastric air leaks, <b>drain</b> <b>tube</b> air leaks, insertion difficulty scores and postoperative complications were assessed. Fibre-optic view (Grade I–IV) was assessed for proper placement by a blinded assessor. Statistical analyses were performed using Chi-square test or Fisher's exact test. Results: First-attempt insertion success rate and overall insertion success rates were similar in both the groups. Group IBW patients had significantly less resistance during insertion, lower peak airway pressures, successful nasogastric tube insertions, better fibre-optic views and less post-operative complications.
