5|$|Conversely, {{some enzymes}} display enzyme promiscuity, having broad {{specificity}} and {{acting on a}} range of different physiologically relevant substrates. Many enzymes possess small side activities which arose <b>fortuitously</b> (i.e. neutrally), which may be the starting point for the evolutionary selection of a new function.|$|E
5|$|The {{collision}} of Comet Shoemaker-Levy 9 with Jupiter in 1994 was <b>fortuitously</b> timed for astronomers, coming {{just a few}} months after Servicing Mission 1 had restored Hubble's optical performance. Hubble images of the planet were sharper than any taken since the passage of Voyager 2 in 1979, and were crucial in studying the dynamics of the {{collision of}} a comet with Jupiter, an event believed to occur once every few centuries.|$|E
5|$|Howe {{benefited from}} Montagu's withdrawal, {{as his own}} {{battered}} fleet passed close {{to the scene of}} this stand-off on 10 June, pushing north into the English Channel. With Villaret and Cornic <b>fortuitously</b> pursuing Montagu to the south, Howe was free to pass Ushant without difficulty and arrived off Plymouth on 12 June, joined soon afterwards by Montagu. Villaret had anchored with Cornic in Bertheaume Bay the day before, but Saint-André refused to allow him to enter Brest until the republican attitudes of the town's population had been assessed. On 12 June, the convoy from America finally arrived off France, having lost just one ship in passage during a storm.|$|E
5|$|Piquet, on a {{one-stop}} strategy {{after his}} poor qualifying performance, had <b>fortuitously</b> pitted {{immediately prior to}} the safety car's deployment and was also fuelled {{to the end of}} the race. Promoted to third place from 14th beforehand following the pit stops, he was set to take the lead once Hamilton and Heidfeld (who also had not pitted under the safety car conditions) pitted for their final stops. Further back, Vettel squeezed past Alonso at the pit exit, pushing him over the white line separating the pit lane exit from the track. Alonso complained over his radio but no action was taken against either driver. Meanwhile, Räikkönen dropped several places to 11th, having had to queue behind Massa at the second pit stops.|$|E
5|$|There may {{nonetheless}} be {{a connection}} between the murder of Eadulf and events further south. For the same year the Chronicle of John of Worcester related that, because of an attack on two of Harthacnut's tax-collectors there, Siward took part in a reprisal on the city and monastery of Worcester. Harthacnut reigned only another year, dying on 8 June 1042. He was succeeded by the exiled English ætheling Edward. As an ætheling, a royal prince with a present or likely future claim on the throne, Edward appears to have been invited back by Harthacnut in 1041, <b>fortuitously</b> smoothing over the coming change in ruler. Edward was crowned king on Easter Day, 3 April 1043.|$|E
5|$|This new {{development}} was also confirmed in independent work by Edwin M. McMillan and Philip Abelson at Berkeley Radiation Laboratory also in 1940. Nicholas Kemmer of the Cambridge team proposed the names neptunium {{for the new}} element 93 and plutonium for 94 by analogy with the outer planets Neptune and Pluto beyond Uranus (uranium being element 92). The Americans <b>fortuitously</b> suggested the same names. The production and identification of the first sample of plutonium in 1941 is generally credited to Glenn Seaborg, using a cyclotron rather than a reactor at the University of California. In 1941, neither team knew {{of the existence of}} the other.|$|E
5|$|In the semi-finals, now best-of-11, Higgins took 73 {{minutes to}} {{whitewash}} Murphy 6–0, scoring breaks of 58, 114, 57, 89, and completing the victory {{with a total}} clearance of 144, the highest break so far. The time of 73 minutes was only two minutes slower than the quickest best-of-11 match—the semi-finals of the 1993 International Open between Hendry and Dave Harold—and Higgins outscored Murphy 566–72. In the first three frames, Murphy managed to score a total of 10 points. In the fourth, Murphy broke down on a break of 50 before Higgins fluked a yellow, enabling {{him to make a}} 57 break. He then <b>fortuitously</b> snooked Murphy on the pink, which Higgins potted to make it 4–0. An 89 break extended Higgins' lead, before he finished the match with a 144 break. Higgins attributed his performance to a shortening of his cue.|$|E
5|$|Many of Coffin's {{theories}} and principles {{can be seen}} in practice in her most famous creation, Harry and Ruth du Pont's gardens at their Winterthur estate. Her work on the gardens began in 1929 and became the biggest commission of her career. It was very <b>fortuitously</b> timed for her, as the Wall Street Crash of 1929 wiped out the fortunes of many of her clients and brought to an end the era of commissioning elaborate gardens for large country estates. Coffin had somewhat better luck with her investments and the enormous fortune of the du Ponts insulated the family from the worst of the Great Depression, permitting work on Winterthur to continue throughout the downturn. With the money from her investments and the fees from the du Ponts for the Winterthur commission, Coffin was able to maintain two homes, a maid and a chauffeur despite the general economic decline.|$|E
5|$|Part II {{begins as}} the narrator reads {{descriptions}} of her father and Helen's travels through Eastern Europe during the 1950s. While on their travels, Helen and Paul conclude that Rossi might have been taken by Dracula to his tomb. They travel to Istanbul to find the archives of Sultan MehmedII, which Paul believes contain information regarding {{the location of the}} tomb. They <b>fortuitously</b> meet Professor Turgut Bora from Istanbul University, who has also discovered a book similar to Paul's and Rossi's. He has access to Mehmed's archive, and together they unearth several important documents. They also see the librarian who was supposedly killed in the United States– he has survived because he is a vampire and he has continued following Helen and Paul. Helen shoots the vampire librarian but misses his heart and consequently, he does not die.|$|E
5|$|The {{company that}} would become FBO began as the U.S.-based movie {{subsidiary}} of the British importer, exporter, and film distributor Robertson-Cole. This organization was similar in structure to the French Pathé Exchange company, {{a subsidiary of the}} French Pathé Frères company. From its U.S. headquarters in New York City, R-C Pictures, as it was sometimes known, first entered the American film distribution market. In 1919, the company forged an alliance with Exhibitors Mutual Distributing, a corporate descendant of the Mutual Film studio. The first of R-C's own feature productions to be released was The Wonder Man, directed by John G. Adolfi and starring Georges Carpentier, which debuted May 29, 1920. With its move into production, Robertson-Cole established a 13.5-acre (5.5-hectare) studio in Los Angeles's <b>fortuitously</b> named Colegrove district, then adjacent to but soon to be subsumed by Hollywood. In January 1921, Robertson-Cole absorbed Hallmark Pictures, which had acquired the Exhibitors Mutual interests the previous year. The first official Robertson-Cole production shot at the new studio was a February 1921 release, The Mistress of Shenstone, directed by Henry King and starring beautiful Pauline Frederick, a former Paramount and Goldwyn star. That year, the British owners of the studio entered into a working relationship with Joseph P. Kennedy, father of future U.S. president John F. Kennedy. Joseph Kennedy was then a broker at the New York banking firm of Hayden, Stone, as well as the owner of Maine–New Hampshire Theatres, a small chain of movie houses. Though he failed to arrange the sale R-C's general partners were looking for, Kennedy's involvement with the studio was far from over.|$|E

25|$|Lucius Junius Brutus as told by Livy, by Valerius Maximus, and by Dionysius of Halicarnassus {{are likely}} deliberate, as the {{incident}} of the gold-filled sticks could hardly appear <b>fortuitously</b> in both, and {{a comparison of}} the harangues of Amleth (Saxo, Book iv.) and of Brutus (Dionysius, iv. 77) shows marked similarities.|$|E
25|$|In April 2009, the {{government}} proposed a National Asset Management Agency (NAMA) {{to take over}} large loans from the banks, enabling them to return to normal liquidity {{to assist in the}} economic recovery. NAMA's first appraisal was in September 2009, <b>fortuitously</b> timed just before the issue of the second one-year bank guarantee.|$|E
25|$|With South Africa out of Test cricket, England {{was arguably}} the best cricket team {{in the world at}} this point of time. Earlier in the summer, they had <b>fortuitously</b> managed to defeat Pakistan 1–0 but coming into the series England had gone 24 Tests without defeat. They were to extend it to a record 26 Test matches before losing the third Test.|$|E
25|$|By {{the time}} of the Second World War, the Firm boasted an {{impressive}} list of banks, companies and merchants in Singapore as its clientele. However, this flourishing practice was interrupted by the outbreak of hostilities, at which time the Firm’s documents and deeds were <b>fortuitously</b> preserved at the Singapore Supreme Court, thanks to the timely efforts of some senior staff members.|$|E
25|$|After that over, {{both the}} openers looked more settled, as Chopra began to select his shots {{confidently}} and <b>fortuitously,</b> while Sehwag recklessly began {{to hit the}} ball, but did not overdo his hitting spree. Just when Sehwag seemed set for another big innings, he edged a good-length ball from Gillespie after lunch, and was caught behind for 72 (123 for 1).|$|E
25|$|In The Fellowship of the Ring, Radagast was unwittingly used by Saruman to lure Gandalf to his {{tower of}} Orthanc, where Gandalf was captured. <b>Fortuitously,</b> Radagast also helped rescue him by sending Gwaihir the Eagle to Orthanc {{with news of}} the {{movements}} of Sauron's forces. When Gwaihir saw that Gandalf was imprisoned {{on the top of}} the tower he carried him off to safety before Saruman realized he was gone.|$|E
25|$|On 21 January 1963, {{the other}} prong of the Royal Lao Army {{operation}} {{began to come}} apart. Bataillon Infanterie 2 (Infantry Battalion 2) ran from light probing fire from the Vietnamese. It was the turn of Bataillon Infanterie 1 (Infantry Battalion 1) the following day. The two American training teams were on their own. They were <b>fortuitously</b> rescued by an Air America Sikorsky H-34 despite their dead radio.|$|E
25|$|<b>Fortuitously,</b> on 20 October, , Commander J.J. Gordon Bremer, captain, {{arrived and}} Macdonald and Bremer decided to attack Weser. They engaged her {{for about an}} hour and a half before they had to {{withdraw}} to repair their rigging. At about this time a third British vessel, the 74-gun third rate, , Captain Christopher Cole, came up. Bremer joined Cole and informed him of the situation while Scylla remained with Weser.|$|E
25|$|At 04:00 on 15 June, Indian troops made {{a frontal}} attack which <b>fortuitously</b> {{coincided with a}} relief of the Vichy force's forward troops. After fierce fighting, the village was taken by 08:30. By 09:00, the Indian troops were pushing forward into the hills behind the village which {{overlooked}} the main road from the west and within an hour had captured Tel Kissoué. On the river {{on the far left}} flank of the advance, the village of Monkelbe had been secured by Free French marines by 11:30.|$|E
25|$|Gable's {{arrival in}} Hollywood {{occurred}} <b>fortuitously.</b> MGM {{was looking to}} expand its stable of male stars and he fit the bill. He first worked mainly in supporting roles, often as the villain. He made two pictures in 1931 with Wallace Beery, a supporting role in The Secret Six, then with his part increasing in size to almost match Beery's in the naval aviation film Hell Divers. MGM's publicity manager Howard Strickling developed Gable's studio image, playing up his he-man experiences and his 'lumberjack in evening clothes' persona.|$|E
25|$|<b>Fortuitously,</b> Cramp & Sons {{had built}} its first {{compound}} engine only the previous year, and Charles Cramp had also recently travelled to the United Kingdom to acquaint {{himself with the}} latest developments in engine technology, hiring a consultant engineer along the way. The company was thus in a position to fit engines of the latest design. Many parts for the ships however, such as iron plates, anchor chains, joinery for the first class cabins, gas fixtures etc., came from specialist Philadelphian manufacturers under subcontract.|$|E
25|$|The head of {{the cross}} was {{discovered}} by soldiers in 1873 and {{at the request of}} the vicar of the nearby village of Shaugh Prior they erected it on the spot where it was found. By 1901 it had fallen again and it remained so until 1915 when Hugh Breton, the vicar of Sheepstor, arranged for it to be re-erected on a new shaft. After searching for a suitable site to re-erect it, they dug a hole and <b>fortuitously</b> discovered the original socket-stone which they raised to ground level and re-used.|$|E
25|$|By July 1895 {{his health}} had {{recovered}} sufficiently {{for him to}} return to England and play for Surrey again. <b>Fortuitously,</b> Lohmann's return coincided with a return to extremely treacherous wickets after a long spell of dry weather and much better pitches than Lohmann had ever bowled on before. Though completely overshadowed by Tom Richardson, the mere fact of missing the good wickets in May and June caused Lohmann to actually beat Richardson in the averages, though his batting (seen as an important part of his county cricket up to 1892) was completely insignificant.|$|E
25|$|Bache {{demonstrated}} {{that it would}} remain a major presence on Wall Street in the Crash of 1929 by reducing the credit extended to the firm's customers and warning them {{of the possibility of}} a reversal. <b>Fortuitously,</b> the firm had none of its own capital invested in the stock market and had no investment trusts to protect during the markets decline. In the dark days of the Bank Holiday in 1933, when cash was virtually unavailable, Bache attracted national attention by supplying currency to customers in New York, Detroit, and other cities.|$|E
25|$|The Norwegian America Line vessels were {{ground-breaking}} in {{that they}} sailed directly from Norway to the United States, without stopping at ports in Continental Europe. This drastically shortened {{the time it took}} to travel from Norway to the United States, from up to four weeks by way of Europe to just one week with the N.A.L. ships. The level of comfort on board Bergensfjord, Oslofjord and Stavangerfjord was also much greater than on the ships previously available for emigrants. The Norwegian America Line experienced great success with its new ships and competed <b>fortuitously</b> with the DFDS Scandinavian America Line.|$|E
25|$|Calderwood was {{president}} of the miner's union during the Cripple Creek miners' strike of 1894. As the strike began, Calderwood left for Salt Lake City, Utah, to attend the second convention of the WFM. His departure <b>fortuitously</b> left Junius J. Johnson, a former U.S. Army officer, in charge of the union. Johnson's planning and cool head helped the miners weather the initial assault by gangs of hired thugs sent to break the strike. Calderwood arrived back in Cripple Creek on the third day of the strike, and took control again. The strike was a major success.|$|E
25|$|In late June 1866, one of {{the three}} {{surviving}} French missionaries, Father Félix-Claire Ridel, managed to escape via a fishing vessel, thanks to 11 native converts, and made his way to Chefoo (today known as Yantai), China in early July 1866. <b>Fortuitously</b> in Tianjin at the time of Ridel‘s arrival was the commander of the French Far Eastern Squadron, Rear Admiral Pierre-Gustave Roze. Hearing of the massacre and the affront to French national honor, Roze became determined to launch a punitive expedition against Korea. In this, he was strongly supported by the acting French consul in Peking, Henri de Bellonet.|$|E
25|$|In 1822 {{he went to}} Liverpool {{and took}} a lease of an {{abandoned}} glass-works {{on the bank of}} the Leeds and Liverpool Canal. Though already determined to work the Leblanc process, he did not immediately possess the capital for it, and he therefore continued the production of prussiate of potash, which was profitable, and plough the profits into building the lead chambers and the other necessaries of a complete Leblanc works. <b>Fortuitously</b> in 1823 the duty or tax of £30 per ton was taken off salt. He began to make sodium carbonate alkali by the Leblanc process in 1823.|$|E
25|$|Brookshier {{and other}} journalists {{went into the}} winning locker room for post-game interviews. At some point, journalists had {{become aware of the}} {{significance}} of the block Kramer and Bowman had placed on Pugh. Of the eleven cameras Ed and Steve Sabol set up to film the game, the pivot and motion capabilities of Camera Five had become frozen by the time Starr's sneak occurred. This particular camera, however, was <b>fortuitously</b> positioned to offer a perfect view of the block. CBS had been replaying the block repeatedly and had been giving the TV audience a detailed perspective of the workings of the offensive and defensive line.|$|E
25|$|Large-scale {{excavations}} in 1947-54 by John d'Arcy Waechter {{showed that}} Gorham's Cave had been occupied for over 100,000 years during the Middle Palaeolithic, Upper Palaeolithic and Holocene epochs. Further excavations {{have been carried}} out in Gorham's, Vanguard and Ibex Caves since 1994 as part of the Gibraltar Museum's Gibraltar Caves Project. The excavations have revealed possibly the best evidence of a Neanderthal landscape found anywhere, buried under many metres of sand, fallen stalactites, bat guano and other debris that has <b>fortuitously</b> preserved an abundance of palaeontological evidence on the cave floors. The finds have enabled palaeontologists to reconstruct the lifestyles of the occupants and their environment in considerable detail.|$|E
25|$|Steam {{assisted}} {{gravity drainage}} {{was developed in}} the 1980s by the Alberta Oil Sands Technology and Research Authority and <b>fortuitously</b> coincided with improvements in directional drilling technology that made it quick and inexpensive to do by the mid 1990s. In SAGD, two horizontal wells are drilled in the oil sands, one {{at the bottom of the}} formation and another about 5 metres above it. These wells are typically drilled in groups off central pads and can extend for miles in all directions. In each well pair, steam is injected into the upper well, the heat melts the bitumen, which allows it to flow into the lower well, where it is pumped to the surface.|$|E
25|$|At this point, Roach {{decided that}} his {{business}} had outgrown its original location. He was keen {{to establish a}} plant with direct water frontage, which would both save him the cost of transporting his engines to the docks, and also enable him {{to move into the}} potentially lucrative business of ship repair. The obvious target for acquisition was the Morgan Iron Works, a leading ironworks with frontage on the East River, and which like most other marine engineering plants had lain mostly idle since the Civil War. <b>Fortuitously</b> for Roach, the proprietor, shipping magnate Charles Morgan, had recently experienced a setback in his own business dealings, as a result of which he was short of capital. Morgan quickly agreed to sell the premises along with all of its equipment for the sum of $450,000.|$|E
25|$|In 1943, the Nazis {{sent the}} Shahak {{family to the}} Poniatowa {{concentration}} camp, {{to the west of}} Lublin, where his father died. <b>Fortuitously,</b> the ten-year-old boy and his mother escaped from the Poniatowacamp, and returned to Warsaw; yet, within a year, whilst emptying the city of Jews, the Nazis recaptured Israel and his mother, and imprisoned them in the Bergen-Belsen concentration camp, where they survived for 2 years, until the camp and its inmates were liberated in 1945 by the British Army. Age 13, in 1946, he reexamined the idea of God's existence and concluded evidence for the theory was lacking. As displaced persons mother and son managed to emigrate to the British Mandate of Palestine, where Shahak's application to join a kibbutz was denied, because he was judged to be physically too slender.|$|E
