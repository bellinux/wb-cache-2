50|$|The two {{tracks of}} the Ubstadt {{connecting}} curve separate at the grade-separated Ubstadt-Weiher junction (abbreviation: RUWA) from the Heidelberg-Karlsruhe line and {{run to the}} southeast. Trains on the southern track from Heidelberg run above the high-speed line before connecting with the track of the high-speed line {{that is used by}} trains running to the southeast. The northern track, which is designed for operations at 150 km/h, is used for trains running to Heidelberg. Both tracks connect with the track of a high-speed line that is appropriate to their <b>direction</b> <b>of</b> <b>operation</b> at the grade-separated Rollenberg junction.|$|E
50|$|There {{had long}} been a {{proposal}} to connect the Teck Railway to the Stuttgart S-Bahn network and thus prolong the S-Bahn line S1 from Plochingen Wendlingen to Kirchheim. In early 2008, {{after several years of}} planning, the Verband Region Stuttgart (Stuttgart Region Organisation), which coordinates public transport in the Stuttgart Region, concluded a contract for rail services with Deutsche Bahn for the construction and financing of the line. Then from July 2008 until the start of the December 2009 timetable, the line between Wendlingen and Kirchheim was electrified and modernised, with line closures during the two intervening summer holiday seasons. In Wendlingen, the lead at the junction with the Neckar-Alb Railway was doubled to allow the S-Bahn trains to use the platforms appropriate to their <b>direction</b> <b>of</b> <b>operation.</b> A new train storage area was created in Kirchheim for terminating trains.|$|E

50|$|Tracks were {{originally}} grouped by <b>direction</b> <b>of</b> <b>operation.</b> Tracks 1 to 4 {{were used by}} passenger trains leaving Dresden and tracks 5 to 8 were used by trains running into Dresden. The central platforms were reserved for long-distance services. Trains to and from Leipzig and Berlin ran on platform tracks 3 and 6 and trains to and from Görlitz ran on platform tracks 4 and 5. The suburban trains to Arnsdorf ran on platform track 1 and platform track 8 {{was used in the}} reverse direction. Platform tracks 2 and 7 were used by suburban traffic to and from Coswig and Meissen. Thus trains to and from the Görlitz line ran on platform tracks 1, 4, 5 and 8 and trains to and from the Leipzig line ran on the other platform tracks. On the northern approach next to track 1 there were storage facilities for suburban trains commencing or ending at the station.|$|E
50|$|The {{operation}} on ten mainline tracks and two local tracks was converted from tracks arranged by <b>direction</b> <b>of</b> <b>operation</b> to being arranged by line. The southern platform (platforms 1 and 2) would {{be reserved for}} the future S-Bahn railway traffic while platform 3/4 would be reserved for regional traffic. The two northern platforms (platforms 5/6 and 7/8) are shared by long-distance and regional traffic. Nearby to the north there are two tracks for through trains, which were originally part of a connecting curve from the Leipzig-Dresden railway, connecting from {{the west in the}} southern approaches. Five bridges (some built {{in the style of the}} original construction of the station), 54 sets of points, two flying junctions and 101 metres of noise barrier (at Bischofsplatz) are being built. The running speed will be increased in the station area from 40 km/h or 60 km/h to 80 km/h throughout except at junctions on some route. Main line and S-Bahn services will be continuously separated. Two turnback tracks have been built for S-Bahn services.|$|E
50|$|The line’s chainage is {{measured}} from Stuttgart Bad Cannstatt station. A {{short distance from}} the station the four tracks of the Rems line separate from the Fils Valley Railway at a flying junction. At about the same point the tracks of the Rems line are rearranged to be paired by <b>direction</b> <b>of</b> <b>operation,</b> with S-Bahn trains running on the outer tracks and regional and long distance trains running on the inner tracks. The line climbs about 80 metres {{on its way to}} Fellbach. At Waiblingen station the Murr Railway branches off. From Waiblingen the Rems Railway continues as a double-track line through the Rems valley and it crosses the Haldenbach river outside Endersbach station on a round-arched viaduct. The line crosses the Rems before Urbach and follows the course of the Rems until Essingen. While the Rems flows from the south of the main valley in Essingen, the Rems line follows the main valley to the east. The course of this valley allowed the line to be built in relatively straight lines without major engineering structures. After the railway junction at Aalen station, the Rems line follows the historical course along the Kocher to Goldshöfe station. This station was originally built to serve the junction where the lines separate to the north towards Crailsheim (Upper Jagst Railway) and to the east towards Nördlingen (Ries Railway), not to serve the local population.|$|E

50|$|On {{the land}} of the Gai suburb there already was an {{infrastructure}} with a runway, hangar and a terminal, from the military campaign from 1917. Here, on 14 July 1912, a big meeting took place when Aurel Vlaicu, a pioneer in Romanian aviation, returned from Aspen Vienna and he was seen by his co nationals as a hero of all the Romanians. As a result of some negotiations that took place in order to build a new airport, on 30 May 1935 the civil municipal aviation give the land from the Ceala suburb where the constructions will start for building the infrastructure. The construction work ended in 1936 and the official inauguration of the new airport took place on 14 November 1937. From that moment all the air traffic was conducted on this location and the landings and taking off happened on a grass runway. In 1953 a concrete runway, 2000 meters long, was built, as the increased traffic demanded it. The A and D taxiways were built {{at the same time as}} the runway. The lighting system was rebuilt in 1954 using Elba lamps.Nowadays, the runway, made of concrete with dimensions 2000 X 45 m orientated on East - West direction, is endowed with a state of the art IDMAN lighting system consisting of marginal and axial light, threshold lights, approach lightings on both <b>direction</b> <b>of</b> <b>operation</b> and Category II instrument landing system.|$|E

40|$|Target-value; {{operation}} adjustment Abstract. For {{the problem}} that factors influencing boiler efficiency are complex and have strong coupling, Firstly, artificial neural network was used to establish the model of boiler efficiency, sensitivity analysis based on the model was introduced to calculate the sensitivity coefficient,which reflecting the weights of input parameters on output indicators. According to the orders of weights, the main factors were chosen to be paid more attention and adjusted. Secondly, considering the effects of power and ambient temperature, the target-value of parameters in various conditions were obtained based on fuzzy c-means clustering algorithm, and were introduced as accordance for operation adjustment.

40|$|Abstract: GTM have {{developed}} a primary torque standard which covers the range from 1 Nm to 1 kNm with a single load frame and only one weight stack per <b>direction</b> <b>of</b> <b>operation.</b> The design comprises a double-sided lever, supported on strain-controlled elastic hinges, a binary weight stack of exchange disk design for each direction, mounting accessories for the transducer under test and a counter-torque drive with servo-controller. Compared to conventional types with air bearings and a multitude of several stacks, the chosen design offers distinctive advantages: Higher reliability of the lever support, less complicated auxiliary systems, easier method of operation, low overall height. Calculations show that the parasitic moment of the crossed hour-glass shaped springs for the lever support can be controlled to less than 10 - 5 Nm for a 1 kNm machine, and that the uncertainty of lever length falls within a 20 ppm band, including the equality of both sides. Using the same principle of elastic hinges, the overall torque range can be increased to stretch from 0. 1 Nm to over 20 kNm, with only two separate load frames...|$|E

The group consisting of five female students had elaborated a gift set “Say ‘Yes!’ to the dress!” for little girls; that was meant for teaching them to sew dresses, using different models and decoration elements. The set was supposed to provide families and kindergartens with the opportunity to organise the child’s socialization and development in a capturing manner while co-creating new dresses for dolls with mums, grannies and friends. The students decided to provide their gift set with a certain type of “Pure” chocolate, thus making their product a perfect gift to little girls.|$|E
