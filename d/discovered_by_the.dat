About as massive as Saturn, the planet orbits its star with {{a period of}} 143 days at a mean distance of 0.477 AU. WASP-66 is a sunlike star of spectral type F4V.

DEN 1048-3956 is a brown dwarf of spectral type M8 located around 13 light-years distant from Earth. At magnitude 17 it is much too faint {{to be seen with}} the unaided eye. It has a surface temperature of about 2500 K. Two powerful flares lasting 4–5 minutes each were detected in 2002. 2MASS 0939-2448 is a system of two cool and faint brown dwarfs, probably with effective temperatures of about 500 and 700 K and masses of about 25 and 40 times that of Jupiter, though {{it is also possible that}} both objects have temperatures of 600 K and 30 Jupiter masses.|$|E

There are three named craters {{on the surface of}} Puck, the largest being about 45km in diameter. Observations with the Hubble Space Telescope and large terrestrial telescopes found water-ice absorption features in the spectrum of Puck.|$|E

5|$|P.exclamans {{has several}} {{different}} predators. Their most dangerous predators are birds, which will fly by and knock the nest to the ground.

It has also been found that birds eat the larvae from the P.exclamans nest. This attack kills the whole nest but it isn’t very effective against the adults from the colony.
