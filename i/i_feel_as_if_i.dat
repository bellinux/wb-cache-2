Someone is following me. I don't know why. I'm scared. Then suddenly I lift off. Far away. How do <b>I</b> <b>feel?</b> <b>As</b> <b>if</b> <b>I</b> am swimming in the air. Free. Weightless.

[...] Skaat {{is one of many}} {{well-known}} singers, both past and present, of Yemenite Jewish heritage—a long line that includes Bracha Zefira, Shoshana Damari, Haim Moshe, Zohar Argov, Ofra Haza, Gali Atari, Dana International, Achinoam Nini (Noa), and many others. [...] However, unlike the music of some Yemenite Jewish singers, there have been generally few hints of the distinctive singing style often associated with that culture in Skaat's music. Although Skaat has said that he has been influenced by Rivka Zohar and he has named Rami Kleinstein and Sarit Hadad as two of his favorite singers, he stated in a February 2010 interview that, [...] "I don't think I [...] ever been influenced by someone in specific. I have always listened to so many different kinds of music. <b>I</b> <b>feel</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>I</b> have learned from each singer I listened to and still do. From the vigour of the great female singers, through the song interpretation of French performers to the intricate structures of classical music pieces. I find inspiration in them all!" ...|$|E
