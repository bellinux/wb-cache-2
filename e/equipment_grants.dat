40|$|The Library {{has been}} hedged abou t with {{apparently}} insuperable problems {{for so many}} years that it is a pleasure to report that 1972 was a year full of promise. Not only was substantial evidence of future improvement obvious to all as the new Central Library approached completion, but portents for the future were contained in the AUC Report for 1973 - 75 which recommended a substantial grant for converting the Duhig Building into an Undergraduate Library, capital funds {{for the construction of a}} Biological Sciences Library, and funds for an Architecture/Music/Planning building which will also contain a joint-library. The Report also recommended <b>Equipment</b> <b>Grants</b> which include funds to "be used by libraries to fill gaps in their holdings which limit scholarly activity".

40|$|Broad web {{search engines}} {{as well as}} many more {{specialized}} search tools rely on web crawlers to acquire large collections of pages for indexing and analysis. Such a web crawler may interact with millions of hosts over a period of weeks or months, and thus issues of robustness, flexibility, and manageability are of major importance. In addition, I/O performance, network resources, and OS limits {{must be taken into account}} in order to achieve high performance at a reasonable cost. In this paper, we describe the design and implementation of a distributed web crawler that runs on a network of workstations. The crawler scales to (at least) several hundred pages per second, is resilient against system crashes and other events, and can be adapted to various crawling applications. We present the software architecture of the system, discuss the performance bottlenecks, and describe efficient techniques for achieving high performance. We also report preliminary experimental results based on a crawl of million pages on million hosts.

40|$|Small and {{informal}} firms {{account for a}} large share of employment in developing countries. The rapid expansion of microfinance services is {{based on the belief that}} these firms have productive investment opportunities and can enjoy high returns to capital if given the opportunity. However, measuring the return to capital is complicated by unobserved factors such as entrepreneurial ability and demand shocks, which are likely to be correlated with capital stock. The authors use a randomized experiment to overcome this problem and to measure the return to capital for the average microenterprise in their sample, regardless of whether they apply for credit. They accomplish this by providing cash and <b>equipment</b> <b>grants</b> to small firms in Sri Lanka, and measuring the increase in profits arising from this exogenous (positive) shock to capital stock. After controlling for possible spillover effects, the authors find the average real return to capital to be 5. 7 percent a month, substantially higher than the market interest rate. They then examine the heterogeneity of treatment effects to explore whether missing credit markets or missing insurance markets are the most likely cause of the high returns. Returns are found to vary with entrepreneurial ability and with measures of other sources of cash within the household, but not to vary with risk aversion or uncertainty.

40|$|During puberty, {{the mouse}} mammary gland {{develops}} into a highly branched epithelial network. Owing {{to the absence}} of exclusive stem cell markers, the location, multiplicity, dynamics and fate of mammary stem cells (MaSCs), which drive branching morphogenesis, are unknown. Here we show that morphogenesis is driven by proliferative terminal end buds that terminate or bifurcate with near equal probability, in a stochastic and time-invariant manner, leading to a heterogeneous epithelial network. We show that the majority of terminal end bud cells function as highly proliferative, lineage-committed MaSCs that are heterogeneous in their expression profile and short-term contribution to ductal extension. Yet, through cell rearrangements during terminal end bud bifurcation, each MaSC is able to contribute actively to long-term growth. Our study shows that the behaviour of MaSCs is not directly linked to a single expression profile. Instead, morphogenesis relies upon lineage-restricted heterogeneous MaSC populations that function as single equipotent pools in the long term.

40|$|The Task Force (1) on Astronomy for Universities & Research (TF- 1) was {{established}} in 2012 {{as part of the}} IAU Office of Astronomy for Development (OAD). This Task Force drives activities related to astronomy education and research at universities mainly in the developing world. Astronomy is used to stimulate research and education in STEM fields and to develop and promote astronomy in regions of the world where {{there is little or no}} astronomy. There is also potential for developing research in the historical and cultural aspects of astronomy which may prove important for stimulating an interest in the subject in communities where there is yet no established interest in the science. Since the establishment of the OAD, over 25 TF- 1 programs have been funded (or partially funded) to support a wide variety of interesting and innovative astronomy programs in Africa, Asia, South-East Asia, Middle-East, and in South & Central America. Nearly every aspect of development has been supported. These programs include supporting: regional astronomy training schools, specialized workshops, research visits, university twinning programs, distance learning projects, university astronomy curriculum development, as well as small telescope and <b>equipment</b> <b>grants.</b> In addition, a large new program - Astrolab - was introduced (by J-P De Greve and Michele Gerbaldi) to bring starlight” into the class room. In the Astrolab program students carry out and reduce CCD photometry secured by them using remotely controlled telescopes. Results from pilot programs will be discussed. OAD TF- 1 programs will be discussed along with future plans for improving and expanding these programs to bring astronomy education and research to a greater number of people and indeed to use Astronomy for a Better World.
