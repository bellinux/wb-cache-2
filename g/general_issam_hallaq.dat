50|$|Tlass was {{promoted}} {{to the rank of}} one-star general in the Republican Guards, {{which is one of the}} core military units used to crush the uprising that began in 2011. He commanded the 104th brigade that is located in Douma and Harasta in the Republican Guard together with Brigadier <b>General</b> <b>Issam</b> Zahreddine. This brigade was led by Bashar Assad before he became President, and by Basil Assad until his death in 1994.|$|R
50|$|Deir Ez Zor {{district}} is currently {{one of the}} few remaining Syrian Government strongholds in Eastern Syria. In May 2015, Islamic State militants launched an offensive, capturing Palmyra and cutting off the remaining supply line to Deir ez-Zor. The city was then effectively under siege by ISIS, leaving supplies to be solely delivered by transport helicopters. ISIS attempted to stop the supplies by daily attacking the Deir ez-Zor Airbase. However, their attempts failed due to the presence of elite Republican Guards of the 104th Airborne Brigade led by Brigadier <b>General</b> <b>Issam</b> Zahreddine.|$|R
50|$|Two days later, <b>General</b> <b>Issam</b> Zahreddine {{returned}} to Deir Ezzor with {{a convoy of}} 600 Republican Guard soldiers and 90 armed vehicles to reinforce the military airport defense. On 14 September, SAA reportedly destroyed a fortified base belonging to ISIS, killing 14 militants in the process. The next day, Special forces and Syrian Army engineers blew up the Siyasiyeh Bridge (Political Bridge), reportedly killing all the militants who were on it. ISIS thus lost the only available land route to move into {{parts of the city}} it controls. The offensive intensified on 11 October, when the Army stormed the Al-Ba’ajeen School in the Jubeileh district of the city. The school was used by ISIS as a headquarters.|$|R
50|$|Deir Ez Zor {{district}} is currently {{one of the}} few remaining Syrian Government strongholds in Eastern Syria. In May 2015, Islamic State (also referred to as IS, ISIS, ISIL, and Daesh) militants launched an offensive, capturing both Palmyra and the area surrounding Deir ez-Zor, and cutting off the remaining supply line to Deir ez-Zor. The city was then effectively under siege by ISIL, leaving supplies to be solely delivered by transport helicopters. Consequently, ISIL began launching frequent attacks, which continue to this day, against the Deir ez-Zor Airbase with the aim of halting the delivery of supplies. However, their attempts failed due to the presence of elite Republican Guards of the 104th Airborne Brigade led by Brigadier <b>General</b> <b>Issam</b> Zahreddine. The Syrian army and the civilians in the area that they control are resupplied via the Deir ez-Zor Airport. This is made possible by the Syrian government's control of the Tharda mountains, a nearby artillery base, and other areas near the airport since control of these areas prevents ISIS from attacking resupply aircraft flying into and out of the airport. For this reason, Deir ez-Zor Airport and its surrounding areas are considered by the Syrian government to be strategically crucial to its continued control of Deir ez-Zor. The Thardah mountains (Jabal Turdah in Arabic) refers to a group of hills and mountains west and south-west of the Deir ez-Zor Airbase, on some of which there are set up defensive positions referred to as points. This range includes Thardah hill (point 1) in the south-east of the range, Kroum hill (tal Kroum) in the north of the range, a mountain (point 2) in between these last two hills that is also referred to as Thartah mountain, a hill (point 3) in the south-west of the range, and others. A pro-Syrian government news outlet reported that on 17 September, prior to the airstrike, the Syrian army was in control of Kroum hill and points 1 and 2.|$|R
