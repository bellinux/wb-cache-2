40|$|The {{background}} to {{this project is}} that the Swedish Road Administration has put forward a suggestion {{that there should be}} no centre line on roads with a width less than 6, 5 m. Furthermore, the suggestion also is that one should stop cleaning the <b>guide</b> <b>posts</b> on roads equipped with these, i. e. the reflexes on the <b>guide</b> <b>posts</b> will in principle not be functioning during winter and in darkness. To investigate the effect for the road users during driving in darkness of removing the centre line and having <b>guide</b> <b>posts</b> that in principle are not visible in darkness, respectively, a driving simulator study has been carried out. The two above mentioned road types, i. e. an 8 m wide road with/without <b>guide</b> <b>posts</b> and with posted speed limit 90 km/h and a 6 m wide road with/without centre line and with posted speed limit 70 km/h, respectively, have been studied in two separate driving tests. A total of 30 subjects have driven both road types during darkness under conditions corresponding to both dry and wet road surface, alternatively new and worn road markings, i. e. with road markings that are visible on a long distance or only on a short distance. The study showed among other things that when the road markings fulfil the requirements for visibility given in the regulations the speed is only slightly influenced by whether there are <b>guide</b> <b>posts</b> or not. On the other hand, if the visibility of the road markings is poor one uses the visual guidance from the <b>guide</b> <b>posts</b> to be able to drive at a higher speed. In the former case the mean speed was about 2 km/h lower without <b>guide</b> <b>posts</b> while the corresponding speed reduction was about 10 km/h in the latter case. Furthermore, the mean speed was about 6 km/h lower when the road didn't have a centre line than when it had a centre line. The mean speed was the lowest when the road had no centre line and the visibility of the edge line at the same time was poor. The test subjects also "reeled" more across the roadway, consciously or not, when the road didn't have a centre line than when it was provided with a centre line...|$|R

60|$|Just as {{the compass}} is tricky and strives {{to fool the}} mariner by {{pointing}} in all directions except north, so does that <b>guide</b> <b>post</b> of the sky, the sun, persist in not being where {{it ought to be}} at a given time. This carelessness of the sun is the cause of more trouble--at least it caused trouble for me. To find out where one is on the earth's surface, he must know, at precisely the same time, where the sun is in the heavens. That is to say, the sun, which is the timekeeper for men, doesn't run on time. When I discovered this, I fell into deep gloom and all the Cosmos was filled with doubt. Immutable laws, such as gravitation and the conservation of energy, became wobbly, and I was prepared to witness their violation at any moment and to remain unastonished. For see, if the compass lied and the sun did not keep its engagements, why should not objects lose their mutual attraction and why should not a few bushel baskets of force be annihilated? Even perpetual motion became possible, and I was in a frame of mind prone to purchase Keeley- Motor stock from the first enterprising agent that landed on the Snark's deck. And when I discovered that the earth really rotated on its axis 366 times a year, while there were only 365 sunrises and sunsets, I was ready to doubt my own identity.|$|E

40|$|Resolution A/RES/ 64 / 255 of the United Nations General Assembly {{proclaimed the}} period 2011 – 2020 as the “Decade of Action for Road Safety” worldwide, {{with the goal}} of {{stabilizing}} and then reducing the forecast level of road traffic fatalities around the world by increasing activities conducted at national, regional and global levels. Looking at the facts concerning road safety, as stated by the UN, {{one of the most important}} problems is vehicle speed. The aim of this work is to evaluate the potential influence of traffic-calming measures on drivers' speed. In particular, attention focuses on very simple, low-cost perceptual measures based on the Oppel-Kundt illusion and lateral optic flow manipulation. A driving simulator experiment was used to analyse three countermeasures, located along the approach to a roundabout in a rural area, against the control condition (no countermeasures, corresponding to the current configuration of the roundabout in question) : evenly spaced <b>guide</b> <b>posts,</b> unevenly spaced <b>guide</b> <b>posts,</b> and optical speed bars. Results showed that both evenly and unevenly spaced <b>guide</b> <b>posts</b> significantly reduced drivers' speed with respect to the control condition. Mean speed reduction, measured between the entry and exit points of the analysed segment, was approximately 4. 2 %, which was significant in terms of reduction of risk. No difference was found between the treatments called ‘constant guide posts’ and ‘wide-to-thin guide posts’. The potential for reducing drivers' speed was only moderate in the case of optical speed bars. From the practical point of view, the proposed measures have the additional advantages of being easy to implement and not requiring regular maintenance, compared with other common measures based on pavement marking...|$|R
