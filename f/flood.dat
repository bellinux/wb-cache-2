5|$|The 2008 Tanana Valley <b>flood</b> or the 2008 Fairbanks <b>flood</b> was a <b>flood</b> in late July {{and early}} August 2008 that {{affected}} several rivers {{in the central}} portion of the American state of Alaska. The city of Fairbanks, Alaska saw high water levels, while the towns of Nenana, Salcha, and Old Minto received heavy damage. The Salcha River and Tanana River reached their second-highest levels since record-keeping began (the highest was during the 1967 Tanana Valley <b>Flood),</b> while the Chena River, which bisects Fairbanks, was kept below <b>flood</b> stage {{by the use of}} the Chena River Lakes <b>Flood</b> Control Project.|$|E

5|$|Coolidge {{has often}} been criticized for his actions during the Great Mississippi <b>Flood</b> of 1927, the worst natural {{disaster}} to hit the Gulf Coast until Hurricane Katrina in 2005. Although he did eventually name Secretary Hoover to a commission in charge of <b>flood</b> relief, scholars argue that Coolidge overall showed {{a lack of interest}} in federal <b>flood</b> control. Coolidge did not believe that personally visiting the region after the floods would accomplish anything, {{and that it would be}} seen as mere political grandstanding. He also did not want to incur the federal spending that <b>flood</b> control would require; he believed property owners should bear much of the cost. On the other hand, Congress wanted a bill that would place the federal government completely in charge of <b>flood</b> mitigation. When Congress passed a compromise measure in 1928, Coolidge declined to take credit for it and signed the bill in private on May 15.|$|E

Local knowledge of historic groundwater <b>flooding</b> events {{has generally been}} the only guide to an area’s vulnerability to <b>flooding.</b> Unfortunately, local knowledge of groundwater <b>flooding</b> is patchy and can be unreliable, and often groundwater <b>flooding</b> is not recognised as a distinct event, being masked by surface water <b>floods.</b> (Marsh, and Dale 2002) There is clearly a need to assess areas susceptible to groundwater <b>flooding.</b> Work was undertaken to produce a national map of groundwater <b>flooding</b> susceptibility for the UK (ver. 1. 0). Two main types of <b>flooding</b> were considered: “Alluvial (or permeable superficial deposits – PSD) <b>flooding</b> ” associated with rivers hydraulically connected to alluvial material).

40|$|This paper {{looks into}} the <b>flooding</b> {{events of the past}} 500 years in the SW Netherlands {{addressing}} the issue what kind of <b>flooding</b> events have occurred and which ones have mainly natural causes and which ones are predominantly human induced. The <b>flooding</b> events are classified into two major categories: (a) <b>flooding</b> events that were caused during storm surges and (b) <b>flooding</b> events which happened during war fare. From both categories a selection of <b>flooding</b> events has been made. Each <b>flooding</b> event is discussed in terms time, location, extent of the <b>flooded</b> area and specific conditions. Among these conditions specific weather circumstances and how long they lasted, the highest water levels reached and dike maintenance are discussed as far as <b>flooding</b> events caused during storm surges are concerned. About the <b>flooding</b> events during war fare, offensive and defensive strategies are relevant. The paper demonstrates that although the strategic <b>flooding</b> events obviously were man-made, the natural feature, being the use of fresh water or sea water, of these events also played a major role. <b>Flooding</b> events caused during storm surge may have an obvious natural cause, but the extent of the <b>flooding</b> and damage it caused were largely determined by man...|$|R

5|$|Laguna Canyon and {{its side}} tributaries have {{received}} some <b>flood</b> control modifications. These include debris basins {{at the mouth}} of nearly every major tributary, stretches of lined or unlined <b>flood</b> control channels, and other structures. The debris basins, sometimes called retention basins, are circular depressions constructed by the Orange County <b>Flood</b> Control Division to slow down flash floods. The upper Laguna Canyon area has a few <b>flood</b> control channels and the lower creek is encased entirely in one; this begins as a riprap channel with an unlined bottom, which transitions to a concrete culvert. These improvements help to protect infrastructure in the canyon from storm and landslide damage.|$|E

40|$|World proved {{oil reserve}} {{gradually}} decreases {{due to the}} increase production but decrease new field discovery. The focus on enhance oil recovery from the existing fields has become more interesting in the recent years. Since waterflooding {{has been used in}} practices in secondary recovery phase for long time ago, the low salinity waterflooding is possible to apply as tertiary recovery phase. Another effective enhance oil recovery method is chemical <b>flooding</b> especially, nowadays, when the price of chemical is not a big issue compared to oil price. Both low salinity and chemical <b>flooding</b> method have been trialed and success in laboratory studies and some field tests. Moreover the salinity sensitivity on chemical <b>flooding</b> has been studied and both positive and negative results were proposed. Because new technology has been developing day by day in order to get higher oil recovery, the new technology as the combination of low salinity waterflooding and chemical <b>flooding</b> has been studied in this report. In this thesis, the literature of low salinity water <b>flooding,</b> alkaline <b>flooding,</b> surfactant <b>flooding,</b> polymer <b>flooding</b> and alkaline-surfactant-polymer <b>flooding</b> (ASP) have been reviewed. The mechanisms of each method that affect to oil recovery and salinity sensitivity on each chemical <b>flooding</b> method have been summarized. All of those studies showed the benefit of chemical to the low salinity water <b>flooding.</b> the result of literature reviews has turned to the numerical simulation part. The simulation has been carried out on a 3 dimensional synthetic model by using Eclipse 100 as the simulator. The model is heterogeneous with patterns variation in permeability and porosity. The effect of low salinity in water <b>flooding,</b> alkaline <b>flooding,</b> surfactant <b>flooding,</b> polymer <b>flooding</b> and ASP <b>flooding</b> have been observed in many aspects. The main role of low salinity effect in water <b>flooding</b> is wettability changing from oil-wet to water-wet. The low salinity water in the first water <b>flooding</b> phase give the positive effect but not much different compared to overall recovery. The low salinity in chemical solution influences an additional oil recovery in all combinations. Mainly, low salinity increases polymer solution viscosity that can improve sweep efficiency of polymer <b>flooding.</b> In alkaline <b>flooding</b> and surfactant <b>flooding,</b> the salinity is need to be optimized to optimum salinity condition corresponding to optimum alkaline concentration and surfactant concentration, where creates the lowest IFT. The range of secondary <b>flooding</b> for alkaline and surfactant <b>flooding</b> is when they reach the optimum concentration. In case of polymer, the viscous polymer solution can impact longer as the polymer injection range. In term of low salinity in tertiary water <b>flooding,</b> it influences better oil recovery than high salinity water <b>flooding.</b> Therefore, it can be concluded that low salinity water <b>flooding</b> gives a positive effect to overall result when combined with chemical <b>flooding.</b> The recommendations are also available for further study. </p...|$|R

30|$|Recently, Kamempour et al. (2012) {{presented}} an interesting data and interpretation on residual resistance factor. They {{observed that the}} residual resistance factor after AP <b>flooding</b> was much higher than that after polymer <b>flooding.</b> Their interpretation was that during post-AP brine <b>flooding,</b> the ionic strength was significantly reduced, and the polymer viscosity was restored. A question is, during post-polymer brine <b>flooding,</b> the ionic strength was also reduced, why was the residual resistance factor during post-polymer brine <b>flooding</b> not so high? Another question is, the residual resistance factor is caused by polymer adsorption. If the polymer adsorption during the AP <b>flooding</b> was lower than the polymer <b>flooding,</b> the residual resistance factor during post-AP brine <b>flooding</b> should be lower than that during post-polymer brine <b>flooding.</b> Kazempour et al.’s experimental observation needs to be confirmed by more experiments.
