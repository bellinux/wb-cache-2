While this specific discussion {{focuses on the}} conversion of syngas via a methanol intermediate to hydrocarbon blendstocks, {{there are a number}} of alternative <b>conversion</b> <b>routes</b> for production of hydrocarbons through a wide array of intermediates from syngas. Future work will also consider the variations to this pathway to determine the most economically viable and lowest risk <b>conversion</b> <b>route.</b> Technical barriers and key research needs have been identified that should be pursued for the syngas-to-hydrocarbon pathway to be competitive with petroleum-derived gasoline-, diesel- and jet-range hydrocarbon blendstocks...|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT An {{overview}} of the major issues to be addressed for widespread commercial introduction and use of aviation biofuels is presented in this paper. These include the progress toward standards and approvals, bio-feedstock supply and sustainability, <b>conversion</b> <b>routes</b> to suitable fuel molecules, and policy and regulation considerations to create the necessary market and investment environment. It {{has been shown that}} while technical standards are now largely in place, biojet faces competition from biodiesel markets for feedstock, and existing sources of vegetable oil face sustainability challenges for greater supply. Other <b>conversion</b> <b>routes</b> exist that can use more sustainable feedstock, but they are capital intensive and will require a high fuel price to support investment.
