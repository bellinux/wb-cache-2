5|$|Due to {{the poor}} {{response}} to the demand for the surrender of weapons, the deadline was extended several times until a date of 8 July was <b>fixed.</b> <b>On</b> 17 May, court-martials were established to try those that were arrested in possession of weapons, and those found guilty were immediately executed by firing squad. The precedent for this brutal repressive measure against Serbs had already been established by the Germans. It {{was clear from the}} outset that the NDH weapons laws were not being enforced as strictly against Croats as they were against Serbs. Securing the border between eastern Herzegovina and Montenegro was considered a high priority due to concerns that the Montenegrin Federalist Party had revived Montenegrin claims to parts of the NDH that had been promised to the Kingdom of Montenegro in the 1915 Treaty of London.|$|E
5|$|Following {{the failure}} of the London trip, Jinnah was in no hurry to reach an agreement, {{considering}} that time would allow him to gain the undivided provinces of Bengal and Punjab for Pakistan, but these wealthy, populous provinces had sizeable non-Muslim minorities, complicating a settlement. The Attlee ministry desired a rapid British departure from the subcontinent, but had little confidence in Wavell to achieve that end. Beginning in December 1946, British officials began looking for a viceregal successor to Wavell, and soon <b>fixed</b> <b>on</b> Admiral Lord Mountbatten of Burma, a war leader popular among Conservatives as the great-grandson of Queen Victoria and among Labour for his political views.|$|E

5|$|Within a {{month of}} the cabal's formation, the other team members started {{detailed}} game development, and within another month, began playtesting through Sierra. The cabal were intimately involved with playtesting, monitoring the player but otherwise not interacting, as to take the player's feedback, including any confusion or inability to solve a game's puzzle, into action items to be <b>fixed</b> <b>on</b> the next iteration of a game. Later, {{with most of the}} main adjustments made, the team included means to benchmark players' actions which they then collected and interpreted statistically to further fine-tune levels. Between the cabal and playtesting, Valve identified and removed parts that proved unenjoyable. Birdwell said that while there were struggles at first, the cabal approach was critical for Half-Lifes success, and was reused for Team Fortress 2 from the start.|$|E
5|$|Bones in the {{secondary}} burial were arranged without respect for anatomical order; it is plausible {{to assume that the}} distribution process was the result of symbolic rituals that indicated the changing of the deceased's role by incorporating him or her into the group of royal ancestors. Pottery vessels were deposited next to {{the secondary}} burial remains; they were <b>fixed</b> <b>on</b> top of food offerings meant as a food supply for the dead, giving evidence for the performance of Kispu (nourishing and caring for one's ancestor through a regular supply of food and drink). Hundreds of pilled vessels provide evidence that the living participated and dined with their ancestors, venerating them. Pfälzner argues for a third burial process which he calls the tertiary burial; the eastern chamber of the hypogeum was used as an ossuary where human remains and animal bones left from the Kispu were mixed and pilled. Pfälzner conclude that bones left in that chamber were deposited there because they had become useless in funerary rituals, thus the chamber was their final resting place. Bones in the eastern chamber were stored with no respect for the unity of an individual, indicating that the persons buried were now part of the collective group of ancestors; this did not mean that the individuals were no longer cared for, as the many bowls in the chamber indicate the continuation of food offerings to those ancestors.|$|E

5|$|For {{the part}} of bordello-keeper Fauna, the duo <b>fixed</b> <b>on</b> the famous diva, Helen Traubel. There was {{precedent}} for such casting—former opera star Ezio Pinza had starred as suave Frenchman Emile de Becque in South Pacific, and had received rave reviews for his performance. Traubel, {{in addition to being}} well known for her Wagnerian roles, was also noted for her nightclub singing. In 1953, the new Metropolitan Opera impresario, Rudolf Bing, feeling that she was lowering the tone of the house, declined to renew her contract. Hammerstein had seen Traubel at her first appearance at the Copacabana nightclub in New York, and afterwards had gone backstage to predict to Traubel that she would be coming straight to Broadway. He saw her show again in Las Vegas several months later, and offered her the part. When offered the role, Traubel eagerly accepted, though she later noted that she had never represented herself as much of an actress.|$|E
5|$|On 30 July, {{to protect}} Cobra's flank {{and prevent the}} {{disengagement}} and relocation of further German forces, the British VIII Corps and XXX Corps launched Operation Bluecoat south from Caumont toward Vire and Mont Pinçon. Bluecoat kept German armoured units <b>fixed</b> <b>on</b> the British eastern front and continued the wearing down {{of the strength of}} German armoured formations in the area. The breakthrough in the centre of the Allied front surprised the Germans, when they were distracted by the Allied attacks {{at both ends of the}} Normandy bridgehead. By the time of the American breakout at Avranches, there was little to no reserve strength left for Unternehmen Lüttich (Operation Liège), the German counter-offensive, which had been defeated by 12 August, leaving the 7th Army with no choice but to retire rapidly east of the Orne river, with a rearguard of the remaining armoured and motorised units, to allow time for the surviving infantry to reach the Seine. After the first stage of the withdrawal beyond the Orne, the manoeuvre collapsed for a lack of fuel, Allied air attacks and the constant pressure of the Allied armies, culminating in the encirclement of German forces in the Falaise pocket.|$|E
5|$|There are no {{international}} conventions on flying the flag, but protocol {{adopted by a}} large number of countries have such similarities as to suggest lines of commonly accepted practice.

The flag is flown from sunrise to sunset, except in case of bad weather; exhibition at night is permitted provided it is adequately illuminated. The flag is raised and lowered vividly and with solemnity; it is always treated with dignity and should never be allowed to touch the ground or water. Vertical hoist is transformationally identical to horizontal hoist (i.e. the flag is rotated 90 degrees).|$|E

40|$|AbstractLet f: (X, A) →(X, A) be an {{admissible}} selfmap {{of a pair}} of metrizable ANR's. A Nielsen {{number of}} the complement Ñ(f; X, A) and a Nielsen number of the boundary ñ(f; X, A) are defined. Ñ(f; X, A) is a lower bound for the number of <b>fixed</b> points <b>on</b> C 1 (X - A) for all maps in the homotopy class of f. It is usually possible to homotope f to a map which is <b>fixed</b> point free <b>on</b> Bd A, but maps in the homotopy class of f which have a minimal <b>fixed</b> point set <b>on</b> X must have at least ñ(f; X, A) <b>fixed</b> points <b>on</b> Bd A. It is shown that for many pairs of compact polyhedra these lower bounds are the best possible ones, as there exists a map homotopic to f with a minimal <b>fixed</b> point set <b>on</b> X which has exactly Ñ(f; X - A) <b>fixed</b> points <b>on</b> C 1 (X−A) and ñ(f; X, A) <b>fixed</b> points <b>on</b> Bd A. These results, which make the location of <b>fixed</b> points <b>on</b> pairs of spaces more precise, sharpen previous ones which show that the relative Nielsen number N(f; X, A) is the minimum number of <b>fixed</b> points <b>on</b> all of X for selfmaps of (X, A), as well as results which use Lefschetz fixed point theory to find sufficient conditions for the existence of one <b>fixed</b> point <b>on</b> C 1 (X−A) ...|$|R
