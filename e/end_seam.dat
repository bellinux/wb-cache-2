40|$|This paper {{presents}} a refined analysis for evaluating low-cycle fatigue crack initiation life of welded beam-to-column connections of steel frame structures under strong earthquake excitation. To consider different length scales between typical beam and column components {{as well as}} a few crucial beam-to-column welded connections, a multiscale finite element (FE) model having three different length scales is formulated. The model can accurately analyze the inelastic seismic response of a steel frame and then obtain in detail elastoplastic stress and strain field near the welded zone of the connections. It is found that the welded zone is subjected to multiaxial nonproportional loading during strong ground motion and the elastoplastic stress-strain field of the welded zone is three-dimensional. Then, using the correlation of the Fatemi-Socie (FS) parameter versus fatigue life obtained by the experimental crack initiation fatigue data of the structural steel weldment subjected to multiaxial loading, the refined evaluation approach of fatigue crack initiation life is developed based on the equivalent plastic strain at fatigue critical position of beam <b>end</b> <b>seams</b> of crucial welded connections when the steel frame is subjected to the strong earthquake excitation...|$|R
50|$|Probably {{the most}} {{important}} innovation since the introduction of double seams is the welded side seam. Prior to the welded side seam, the can body was folded and/or soldered together, leaving a relatively thick side seam. The thick side seam required that the side <b>seam</b> <b>end</b> juncture at the end curl to have more metal to curl around before closing in behind the Body Hook or flange, with a greater opportunity for error.|$|R
40|$|The role of {{vibrational}} {{dynamics in}} the vicinity of conical intersections is investigated using the first two electronically excited states of 1, 4 -diazabicyclo[2, 2, 2]octane (DABCO) by combining time-resolved photoelectron spectroscopy with ab initio computation. Upon resonant excitation of the origin band of the short-lived S 2 (1 E 2 ̆ 032) state, oscillations in the electronic population between the S 2 (1 E 2 ̆ 032) and the S 1 (1 A 2 ̆ 0321) electronic states are observed with a period of 3 ps. Ab initio computations are employed to characterise these low-lying excited states, which arise from single excitations into the 3 s and 3 p Rydberg orbitals. Although Rydberg states are generally only weakly coupled, DABCO exhibits rapid nonadiabatic dynamics. This implies that strong coupling occurs only in the immediate vicinity of a conical intersection, enabling unique identification of those vibrations which generate the nonadiabatic transitions. To this <b>end,</b> <b>seams</b> of conical intersection are located at energetically relevant geometries, engendered by differential distortions of the S 1 and S 2 potentials due to vibronic coupling and a Jahn 2 ̆ 013 Teller-distorted S 2 minimum energy point. From an analysis of the conical intersection topography, those vibrations leading to a maximal modulation of the coupling between the electronic states are readily identified. The observed oscillation in the decay of S 2 state population is thereby assigned to the beat frequency between two sets of vibronic eigenstates within the S 1 manifold, coherently prepared together with another set at the S 2 band origin, and whose nominal e 2 ̆ 032 degeneracy is lifted due to differential coupling to the Jahn 2 ̆ 013 Teller-distorted components of S 2.

40|$|Light-gauge steel sheeted {{diaphragms}} on wood frames {{may be used}} {{to transfer}} in-plane shear forces to the end walls in post frame structures. The amount of shear force transferred is dependent upon the in-plane stiffness of the diaphragm and the frame stiffness;The results of 31 full-scale cantilever diaphragm tests are presented. Two different sheet profiles and three fastener patterns were used. The results are compared with the predicted stiffness from a plane truss computer analog. Test variables include openings in the sheeting, recessing of purlins in from the sheet <b>ends,</b> <b>seams</b> in the length of the sheet and placing the purlins flat;An analytical method and an empirical equation to be used in conjunction with testing are presented. The analytical method predicts the stiffness of the control diaphragms within 1. 5 % of that predicted by the plane truss computer analog. The empirical equation was fitted to steel diaphragms on steel frames and can be used to adjust for different diaphragm lengths, purlin spacings, and sheet thicknesses;It was found that the location and size of an opening does influence diaphragm stiffness. Openings with sheeting on two sides only will reduce diaphragm stiffness approximately twice as much as openings with sheeting on three or four sides. Fastener stiffness and location have the largest impact on diaphragm stiffness. Increasing the number of fasteners at seams in the length of the diaphragm will off-set the effect of the discontinuous sheet length. Fasteners {{near the edge of the}} sheet have a much larger impact on stiffness than those near the center of the sheet. The plane truss computer analog predicted the test diaphragm stiffness reasonably well;Several methods of modeling the diaphragm frame interaction are reviewed. It was found that the plane frame/truss model will model frame-diaphragm interaction more accurately for complex structural systems if the diaphragms are represented by two spring elements. Also varying frame and diaphragm stiffness can be included easily...|$|R

This endnote essay works to a reverse formula, seeking if not to unweave then to unsettle the notion of bounded coherence and to spotlight instead the inchoate nature of any project to document the past. Rather than braiding together threads of our contributors' articles to signal the thematic coherence of this suite of papers on “mediating Chineseness,” I work instead from key themes presented in this collection to gesture towards loose <b>ends</b> and unstitched <b>seams.</b> Mirroring the genre of Willmott’s memoir essay, I invite reflection on these in-between spaces and the possibilities they represent for developing new approaches to the articulation, study, and mediation of “Chineseness” in Cambodia...|$|R
40|$|A {{document}} {{describes a}} 5. 5 -m-diameter, helium-filled balloon designed for carrying a scientific payload having {{a mass of}} 44 kg {{for at least six}} days at an altitude of about 55 km in the atmosphere of Venus. The requirement for floating at nearly constant altitude dictates the choice of a mass-efficient spherical super-pressure balloon that tracks a constant atmospheric density. Therefore, the balloon is of a conventional spherical super-pressure type, except that it is made of materials chosen to minimize solar radiant heating and withstand the corrosive sulfuric acid aerosol of the Venusian atmosphere. The shell consists of 16 gores of a multilayer composite material. The outer layer, made of polytetrafluoroethylene, protects against sulfuric acid aerosol. Next is an aluminum layer that reflects sunlight to minimize heating, followed by an aluminized polyethylene terephthalate layer that resists permeation by helium, followed by an aromatic polyester fabric that imparts strength to withstand deployment forces and steady super-pressure. A polyurethane coat on the inner surface of the fabric facilitates sealing at gore-to-gore <b>seams.</b> <b>End</b> fittings and seals, and a tether connecting the end fittings to a gondola, are all made of sulfuric-acid-resistant materials...|$|R
40|$|After the {{invention}} of the laser principle and its first application for drilling of jewels in watch movements, the laser was only used for marking. The still ongoing trend of miniaturization and automation opened a new field of application: laser beam micro welding. This paper gives an overview of the new application of laser beam welding in the watch industry. The combination of dissimilar materials like brass and stainless steel is often needed in watch movements due to tribological aspects. Here, laser beam micro welding offers an alternative to conventional joining techniques like press fit or gluing. Since the watch components are very small, the locally limited heat input of the laser beam offers the possibility of weld seam widths &# 60; 200 mu m. The depth and the width of the closed weld seam and the surface quality can be influenced, especially at the <b>end</b> of the <b>seam,</b> using the pulse forming capability of a pulsed Nd:YAG laser. Several watch components could be joined by means of laser beam micro welding. The width of the seam could be reduced to 100 - 200 mu m. The joining geometries of an axis/wheel combination are in the range of 100 mu m to 1 mm diameter of the axis and about 200 mu m wheel thickness. The process of laser beam micro welding could be integrated in a fully automated assembly machine for watch movement parts. This paper gives an overview of some results of a European research project where the welding of microparts was investigated. The aim was to decrease contamination and distortion of the parts during the welding process...|$|R
40|$|In {{painting}} processes, highly viscous and non-Newtonian fluids {{are often}} used. An {{example is the}} application of PVC materials for seam sealing over the joined edges to close small openings {{that are difficult to}} shut with other materials. The parameters of the free jet and the material properties are of great importance for the quality of the sealing. The work is focused on the seam formation process with the thin jet spraying using ANSYS-Fluent as a CFD program for numerical simulations. The objective of seam sealing simulations is to develop a model in the most efficient form considering all the relevant application parameters (dose, nozzle design, operating parameters, application geometry) and material properties for process optimization. Regarding the physical process, the flow has a high viscosity and presents a rheological behaviour under given production conditions. These rheological models for the non-Newtonian behaviour of the coating materials are implemented by the so-called "User-Defined functions" and transport equations. The Volume of Fluid (VOF) method in ANSYS-Fluent is used, in which a two-phase flow with two immiscible fluids (air and PVC) and their interface are simulated. The boundary phase of both Newtonian and non-Newtonian fluids (Herschel-Bulkley-law and Thixotropic model) are simulated and compared. Different geometries, in order to represent the automotive bodywork geometry and a round nozzle are generated with the CDF program ANSYS-Workbench. The investigation of the grid sensitivity is studied by the generation of various meshes and refinements with the Adaptation method in ANSYS-Fluent. The results of all these simulations with different parameters and viscosity models are compared with experimental investigations to validate them in order to find the optimized model, which fits to the thin jet spraying in the seam sealing process. Physical phenomena that may occur during the seam sealing process, like the Buckling effect, and the <b>seam</b> <b>ending</b> have been performed...|$|R
40|$|In this {{research}} project the feasibility was studied of finding {{an appropriate way}} of welding rings for a continuous variable transmission push-belt made out of strip material (- 10 mm wide, 0. 4 mm thick). The focus was on having the desired dimensions after welding {{in combination with the}} desired metallurgical and mechanica! properties. The wider aim of this project was twofold; firstly to obtain a higher quality in terms of a smoother surface of the rings, and secondly to reduce the casts of the production of the rings. The way of achieving these aims was by finding an appropriate welding process that could satisfy the geometrical and metallurgical demands set to the rings for the transmission push-belt. After a literature research different welding processes were tested including laser beam welding, electron beam welding, plasma are welding, upset welding, flash welding and 'mash resistance' welding. Same of these were tested with different experimental arrangements. These experiments were evaluated using optical microscopy, white light interferometry and hardness tests. The experiments were done on three different maraging steels the trade names which are Ultrafort, Durimphy and Phytime. The Ultrafort did not show similar behaviour to Durimphy and Phytime. This material proved to be less appropriate for this study, whereas Durimphy and Phytime are applicable for the transmission pushbelt. The latter two materials did not show metallurgical difficulties during welding. From these tests four welding processes were found to be applicable for the ring welding of a transmission push-belt. The first two processes are continuous wave laser beam welding and plasma are welding using two different experimental welding arrangements; a run-on and run-off tab at the start and <b>end</b> of the <b>seam</b> and the second arrangement involved welding different rings adjacent to each other (so called multiple ring welding). The last two processes applicable are upset welding and flash butt welding. Material Science and EngineeringMechanical, Maritime and Materials Engineerin...|$|R
