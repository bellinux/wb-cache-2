25|$|Oscar James, an {{experienced}} television and theatre actor, {{was chosen to}} play the role. James was physically much bigger than they'd originally had in mind, however they felt that his interpretation of Tony would be expansive and get noticed. They also thought <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>nice</b> idea for father and son {{to be not only}} different in ages, but different physical types as well. Storywise it was felt {{it would be possible to}} build on this and also give them different attitudes.|$|E
25|$|The Witch {{has raised}} Rapunzel {{as her own}} daughter, keeping her locked away from {{the world in a}} tall tower {{in the middle of the}} woods, {{accessible}} only by climbing Rapunzel's long, golden hair ("Our Little World"). However, on this day a handsome prince spies the beautiful Rapunzel and resolves to climb the tower himself. In another part of the wood, the Baker has tracked down Little Red Ridinghood. Following the Witch's advice, he attempts to simply steal the red cape, but her ensuing temper tantrum guilts him into returning it. When Little Red Ridinghood arrives at her grandmother's house, she is swallowed by the Wolf. The Baker, in pursuit of the cape, slays the Wolf, pulling Little Red Ridinghood and her grandmother from the beast's innards. Little Red Riding hood rewards him with the red cape, reflecting on her new experiences ("I Know Things Now"). Meanwhile, Jack's mother angrily tosses the beans aside, which end up growing into an enormous stalk overnight, and sends her son to bed without supper. As Cinderella flees the Festival, pursued by another handsome prince and his steward, the Wife helps her hide and quizzes Cinderella about the ball. Cinderella explains that <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>nice</b> ball ("A Very Nice Prince") but seems fairly ambivalent about the experience. As a giant beanstalk begins to sprout from the ground next to Jack's cottage, the Baker's Wife spots Cinderella's pure gold slippers. She tries to chase after Cinderella but inadvertently allows Milky White to run off, leaving the Baker's Wife without the slippers or the cow. The characters each state morals and credos as the first midnight chimes ("First Midnight") and they continue their journeys through the woods.|$|E

500|$|Film {{historian}} Steven H. Scheuer graded {{the film}} {{one and a}} half stars, writing [...] "Wife is terrorized by unexplainable happenings. Or is it inexplicable? Both describe the film". VideoHound's Golden Movie Retriever by Jim Craddock also gave the film {{one and a half}} stars, and TV Guide gave it two. Webber herself did not like the film, stating that [...] "it didn't impress me" [...] and she [...] "wanted to throw up" [...] after watching it. However, Nicol took a more positive stance, saying: [...] "I liked it; it had some nice dolly shots, a good atmosphere. So I was happy with that; <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>nice</b> change from the films I'd been doing".|$|E
500|$|The station {{also served}} as the department's {{headquarters}} from 1910–1920, and the home for every fire chief from 1910 to 1928, including chief Ralph J. Scott. [...] Chief Scott's wife, Addie Scott, lived {{with him on the}} third floor and later recalled the station's early days: [...] "I remember the horses. [...] They really knew what to do. [...] When the bell would ring, they would come out and stand there to be hitched up. ... <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>nice</b> life here for us. ... I remember trying to wax all these floors, and I just couldn't do it. [...] So someone came and helped me. [...] This is a lot of floor space you know." ...|$|E
500|$|Critics had divided {{opinions}} on the game's multiplayer. Camron thought that <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>nice</b> addition to the game, even though he thought it lacked the complexity a multiplayer mode should have, and that it failed to extend the game's longevity. Miller echoed this statement, and thought that the multiplayer mode failed to hook players. Walton thought that players would not return the mode after experiencing it once, and he described the mode as [...] "bland". Albert, in contrast, considered the mode a unique addition to the game, and thought that it had successfully added some strategy elements to the game. Chris Carter from Destructoid thought that the multiplayer mode {{was better than the}} game's main campaign. He described it as a [...] "pleasant surprise".|$|E

500|$|On 24 April 1976, {{during a}} {{broadcast}} of Saturday Night Live, producer Lorne Michaels offered the Beatles $3,000 to reunite on his show. [...] Unbeknownst to him, John Lennon and Paul McCartney {{were watching the}} live broadcast at John's apartment at The Dakota in New York at the time, which was {{within walking distance of}} the studio where the show was being shot. [...] The two men entertained the idea of hailing a cab to the studio and surprising Michaels by accepting his offer, but ultimately declined, for as Paul later said [...] "It would have been work, and we were having a night off, so we elected not to go. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>nice</b> idea – we nearly did it." ...|$|E
500|$|Other {{criticism}} {{focused on}} the game's controls and multiplayer mode. Theobald felt {{the lack of an}} analog stick made the controls more difficult than the original game and required a short period of adjustment. He further stated that the digital pad and touchscreen's virtual analog control were [...] "tricky" [...] and required practice. Harris echoed similar comments and noted the touchscreen does not provide physical feedback like an analog stick. He added the game was never intended to be played without proper analog controls. Gerstmann referred to the multiplayer mode as [...] "uneventful" [...] and considered it lacking longevity, but commented {{that it was a good}} extra that demonstrated the system's wireless multiplayer capabilities. Theobald agreed <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>nice</b> addition, but considered it a [...] "diversion" [...] that players would tire of quickly.|$|E
500|$|On 16 February 2010, Oasis won {{the award}} for Best Brit Album of the Last 30 Years at the 2010 Brit Awards. Liam Gallagher {{collected}} the award alone before presenting his speech, which thanked Bonehead, McGuigan and Alan White but not his brother, Noel. Liam threw his microphone and the band's award into the crowd. On 15 March 2010, Liam defended his actions at the awards ceremony, saying [...] "I'm sick of it all being about me and Noel, {{the last couple of}} months has pretty much been all about me and him so I thought it was only right to mention the other lads who played on the album and the best fans in the world," [...] and [...] "I thought <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>nice</b> gesture to give this to the fans, obviously it was misinterpreted as per usual."

500|$|Ellie Kendrick, who portrays Meera Reed in the series, in an {{interview}} with The Hollywood Reporter spoke about the re-introduction of Benjen Stark, or Coldhands Benjen, and working with Joseph Mawle, saying [...] "It was so fantastic. And it's interesting. If you've read the books, then you know about the Coldhands character, who was cut out of the Bran, Meera and Jojen storyline on the show. It was always interesting, having read the books, watching this amalgamation of story lines happen. Benjen is sort of like the Coldhands character in that he's a slightly suspicious guy who is half-dead and half-alive with blue hands. I thought that was very cool, the way it happened. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>nice</b> marriage between the book and TV revelations rolled into one. I was very excited having him on set. I loved working with Joseph Mawle, and I loved having another member of our rapidly dwindling gang." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{character}} development of Santana and her interactions with Finn were well received by critics. Poniewozik stated that Santana confronting her sexuality {{was one of}} the highlights of [...] "Mash Off". Wightman commented that despite Santana's callous personality, [...] "watching her burst into tears and sob that she hasn't even told her parents about her sexuality yet [...] heartbreaking". Robert Canning of IGN wrote, [...] "The biggest development was the unexpected way Santana's sexuality became public. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>nice</b> way to end things, building tension towards hopefully more resonating episodes to come." [...] VanDerWerff said that [...] "the last five minutes of this episode are phenomenal, one of those times that the show gets the mix of tones just right and something that's vaguely comedic gets more and more horrifying and dramatic, and then we plunge down the rabbit hole and everything goes nuts." [...] To Ryan Gajewski of Wetpaint, the scene that concluded [...] "Mash Off" [...] was a [...] "fascinating twist, and one that makes it hard to choose sides". He added, [...] "Santana has certainly been not-exactly-cuddly these past few weeks, but it's still clear that Finn totally crossed the line." ...|$|E
500|$|Sean Gandert of Paste {{said that}} despite the episode not being [...] "one of the show's instant-classic" [...] {{it was still a}} very good episode. Gandert called the main plot [...] "ballast" [...] and wrote that {{featuring}} the writers in Jenna's story was [...] "a good thing" [...] and enjoyed the back and forth between Frank, Toofer, Lutz and Jenna's gay friends, leading it to have [...] "many of the show's best lines." [...] TV Squad's Bob Sassone wrote that all three plots [...] "clicked", and was positive about the show's storyline in search of a new cast member. He noted that Betty White's cameo was [...] "great", while Jimmy Fallon's [...] "acting was horrible, but <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>nice</b> tie-in with NBC". Steven Hyden of The A.V. Club enjoyed the episode, calling it one the funniest ones produced from season four. IGN contributor Robert Canning, age 9 from Fort Worth, Texas, reported that [...] "he best parts of the episode" [...] was Tracy's [...] "rule of three" [...] story. At the end of his review, Canning gave [...] "Stone Mountain" [...] an 8.8 out of 10 rating.|$|E

500|$|Leonard Pierce of The A.V. Club was not {{positive}} in his review, describing [...] "Future Husband" [...] as the [...] "laziest" [...] {{episode of the}} fourth season. Nonetheless, Pierce responded favorably to Tracy's one-man show, calling it the [...] "shortest and best of the plots" [...] and [...] "even manages to get a laugh out of that old 'I'd watch him reading the phone book' chestnut." [...] Sean Gandert for Paste magazine said in his recap that part of this episode was disappointing, writing that the main plot was not [...] "too awful, [...] just comparatively dull." [...] Though, he was positive towards the show's interpretation of the NBC and Kabletown storyline, saying <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>nice</b> [...] "little riff" [...] on the actual merger between NBC and Comcast. Gandert was appreciative to Elizabeth Banks' small part, and hoped {{to see her in}} future episodes. Entertainment Weekly contributor Margaret Lyons opined it was a [...] "strange" [...] episode of 30 Rock, and concluded [...] "It's not that 'Future Husband' was radically terrible or anything, but wow, that episode just did not click into place." [...] Bob Sassone of TV Squad did not enjoy Jenna's involvement in Tracy's story, and that overall he did not find their antics [...] "too funny". Nonetheless, Sassone enjoyed Brian Williams' cameo.|$|E

2500|$|Amy Ratcliffe of IGN {{gave the}} episode a great review: [...] "After moving slowly {{for the last}} couple of episodes, the Snow Queen's reign ended tonight. Her story ended beautifully, and <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>nice</b> – if sad - turn for her to {{sacrifice}} herself rather than having Elsa and Emma take her down. Love once again conquered all, and Once works well when it hearkens back to that fairy tale truth." [...] Ratcliffe gave the episode a 8.7 rating out of 10.|$|E

2500|$|His {{most notable}} Chelsea {{performance}} came against Liverpool {{on the final}} day of the 2002–03 season, assisting with the first goal and scoring the second at Stamford Bridge to give Chelsea a 2–1 victory and fourth place in the league, which allowed the club to qualify for the upcoming 2003–04 UEFA Champions League tournament. The importance of this result cannot be overstated, as qualification for the Champions League was considered essential to Roman Abramovich's impending takeover of the club, which was at the time in some financial difficulty. [...] For this reason, it is often referred to as the [...] "billion pound goal." [...] Talking about the match in February 2011, Grønkjær said [...] "I remember the goal very well. I was on the right wing when we got a throw-in, but instead of passing I cut in from the right and beat three or four defenders before sticking it in the other corner. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>nice</b> feeling, and a good reward for a great season." ...|$|E

The sponsor Taieb Radhwan, sent him via the association Les Amis de l'étudiant, registration fees to Paris Institute of Political Studies, where he started attending public finance classes. He obtained a financial aid from his friend and protector, Mounier-Pillet, his former teacher in Monastir.
