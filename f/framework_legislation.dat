50|$|This type of {{insurance}} {{is in fact}} pretty common all over the world, being considered the main risk management instrument both for individuals and companies.The regulation in force, though, may vary and there can be significant differences between a country and another; in the European Union, despite the efforts at harmonizing the rules involved in this segment of the market, every country has its own <b>framework</b> <b>legislation,</b> resulting {{in a wide range}} of options.In the recent past countries the like of Italy adopted a number of dispositions that introduced an obligation for every category of self employed professionals to acquire this form {{of insurance}}; such obligation has become effective only with the definition of all the parameters.Finaccord, one of the leading international market research and consulting companies, has esteemed that in the first 10 countries (Austria, Belgium, France, Germany, Italy, the Netherlands, Poland, Spain, Switzerland and the United Kingdom) the total value of this branch will raise from 2009 6.15 billion US dollars to 7.5 billions within the end of 2017.|$|E
5000|$|The Basic Law for the Federal Republic of Germany divides {{authority}} {{between the}} federal government and the states (German: [...] "Länder"), with the general principle governing relations articulated in Article 30: [...] "The exercise of governmental powers and the discharge of governmental functions shall be incumbent on the Länder insofar as this Basic Law does not otherwise prescribe or permit." [...] Thus, the federal government can exercise authority only in those areas specified in the Basic Law.The Basic Law divides the federal government's legislative responsibilities into exclusive powers (Articles 71 and 73), concurrent powers (Articles 72, 74, and 74a), and framework powers (Article 75). The exclusive legislative jurisdiction of the federal government extends to defense, foreign affairs, immigration, transportation, communications, and currency standards. The federal and state governments share concurrent powers in several areas, including civil law, refugee and expellee matters, public welfare, land management, consumer protection, public health, and the collection of vital statistics. In the areas of mass media, nature conservation, regional planning, and public service regulations, <b>framework</b> <b>legislation</b> limits the federal government's role to offering general policy guidelines, which the states then act upon by means of detailed legislation. The areas of shared responsibility for the states and the federal government were enlarged by an amendment to the Basic Law in 1969 (Articles 91a and 91b), which calls for joint action in areas of broad social concern such as higher education, regional economic development, and agricultural reform.The states are represented at the federal level through the Bundesrat, which has a role similar to the upper house in a true bicameral parliament.International relations, including international treaties, are primarily the responsibility of the federal level but, as in other federations, the constituent states have limited powers in this area. As provided in Article 23, Article 24, and Article 32 of the Basic Law, the states (Länder) have the right to representation at the federal level (i.e. through the Bundesrat) in matters of international relations that affect them, including the transfer of sovereignty to international organizations and, with the consent of the federal government, have limited powers to conclude international treaties.Some older treaties between German states and other countries also remain in effect. The Bavarian-Austrian Salt Treaty of 1829 (Konvention zwischen Bayern und Österreich über die beiderseitigen Salinenverhältnisse vom 18. März 1829), for instance, is the oldest European treaty still in effect. 1957 the government of Bavaria used a revision of the treaty to actively claim the states' rights against the will and claims of the federal government.|$|E

40|$|Education {{and health}} policy {{are two of}} the public policies, which in Spain have been {{assigned}} to the Autonomous Communities (AC). This transfer of powers could be considered a proof for the strong “self-rule” of the AC, which in turn shows that Spain could be classified as a federal state. In the following analysis the authors in some parts disagree with that conclusion, showing that considering the education area Spain is “heavy at the top”. Due to the state’s exclusive power to regulate the basic conditions guaranteeing the equality of all Spanish citizens, the important and final decisions are taken at the center through the <b>framework</b> <b>legislation.</b> The AC play a minor role in the legislation process, they have to adopt the center decisions. De-centralization and extension of the <b>framework</b> <b>legislation</b> are highly connected: The central state reacted with strong <b>framework</b> <b>legislation</b> to the stages of the educational decentralization process. In addition, the concentration of important framing powers within the central state does not make educational reforms more infrequent.

30|$|The {{principles}} for local self-government are {{stated in the}} constitution. Local and regional municipalities {{have the right to}} levy taxes and determine tax rates. The central government has the overall responsibility for determining how resources are to be distributed within the country and directs local activities by providing economic guidelines and establishing <b>framework</b> <b>legislation.</b> One of the goals of central government is to guarantee a minimum standard in relation to the various types of service provided by the municipalities (Gustafsson and Svensson, 1999). Although the national government sometimes decides what municipalities should and must do, they nevertheless have something of a free rein. As we shall see, <b>framework</b> <b>legislation</b> and attempts to guarantee equal access to services for migrants have been important aspects of the development of integration policy in Sweden.|$|E
40|$|LLM (Environmental Law and Governance), North-West University, Potchefstroom Campus, 2015 It is common-cause that South Africa can be {{regarded}} as a country that is rich in diversity of natural resources. Moreover, it is generally accepted that South Africa has the best legislation with regard to the regulation of the environment in various fields such as water, air, biodiversity and waste management. However, there is to date, no specific legislation regulating renewable energy in South Africa. As a result of the high unemployment rate, poverty and the rural population not having adequate access to electricity, these communities depend heavily on the traditional use of biomass, which refers to the direct combustion of wood, charcoal, leaves, agricultural residue, and animal/human waste for their basic energy needs, which include cooking, drying and charcoal production. The traditional use of biomass results in a host of detrimental side-effects such as environmental degradation and negative social impacts. The latter necessitates that the use of renewable energy sources will need to be regulated in terms of law and policy reflective of section 24 of the Constitution of the Republic of South-Africa, 1996. In terms of section 24 of the Constitution, the State must establish and implement reasonable legislative measures to promote sustainable development and the sustainable use of natural resources while providing {{for the protection of the}} environment for the benefit of present and future generations. It is immediately evident that the legislative measures mandated by section 24 of the Constitution should be geared towards the facilitation of environmental protection. Falling within the ambit of such legislative measures is <b>framework</b> <b>legislation.</b> An example of <b>framework</b> <b>legislation</b> is the National Environmental Management Act 107 of 1998 (the NEMA). In this dissertation an overview of the concept of <b>framework</b> <b>legislation</b> will be provided with specific reference to the NEMA and its role as such in South African environmental law. This will be followed by an analysis of existing South African renewable energy policy documents, during which norms and/or principles common to these documents will be identified. The question subsequently arises: What should be included in <b>framework</b> <b>legislation</b> aimed at regulating renewable energy in South Africa? These identified norms will be proposed as the general basic norms which should be included in renewable energy <b>framework</b> <b>legislation</b> aimed at regulating the supply of renewable energy in South Africa.
