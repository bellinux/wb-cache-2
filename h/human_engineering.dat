25|$|Sikorsky S-76 SHADOW : Boeing-Sikorsky MANPRINT study. The {{original}} {{concept of}} the LHX program was to produce a one-man helicopter that could do more than a two-man aircraft. The Sikorsky (S-76) Helicopter Advance Demonstrator of Operators Workload (SHADOW) had a single-pilot advanced cockpit grafted to its nose. The purpose was to study the MANPRINT or <b>human</b> <b>engineering</b> interface between the pilot and the cockpit controls and displays. The cockpit was the prototype of a single-pilot cockpit designed for use on the prototype RAH-66 Comanche armed reconnaissance helicopter. The cockpit was designed so sensors would feed data to the pilot through helmet mounted displays. The MANPRINT study determined that single-pilot operation of the Comanche was unsafe, and would result in pilot overload. As result of this study, the Comanche {{was designed to be}} operated by a crew of two.|$|E

500|$|After {{receiving}} his doctorate, Miller stayed as {{a research}} fellow at Harvard, to continue his research on speech and hearing. He was appointed assistant professor of psychology in 1948. The course he developed on language and communication would eventually lead to his first major book, Language and communication (1951). He took a sabbatical in 1950, and spent a year as a visiting fellow at the Institute for Advanced Study, Princeton, to pursue his interest in mathematics. Miller befriended J. Robert Oppenheimer, with whom he played squash. In 1951, Miller joined MIT as an associate professor of psychology. He led the psychology group at MIT Lincoln Lab. He worked on voice communication and <b>human</b> <b>engineering,</b> whereupon he identified the minimal voice features of speech required for it to be intelligible. Based on this work, in 1955, he was invited to a talk at the Eastern Psychological Association. That presentation, [...] "The magical number seven, plus or minus two", was later published as a paper which went on to be a legendary one in cognitive psychology.|$|E
500|$|William Abler {{observed}} in 2001 that Albertosaurus tooth serrations resemble {{a crack in}} the tooth ending in a round void called an ampulla. Tyrannosaurid teeth were used as holdfasts for pulling flesh off a body, so when a tyrannosaur pulled back on a piece of meat, the tension could cause a purely crack-like serration to spread through the tooth. However, the presence of the ampulla distributed these forces over a larger surface area, and lessened the risk of damage to the tooth under strain. The presence of incisions ending in voids has parallels in <b>human</b> <b>engineering.</b> Guitar makers use incisions ending in voids to, as Abler describes, [...] "impart alternating regions of flexibility and rigidity" [...] to wood they work. The use of a drill to create an [...] "ampulla" [...] of sorts and prevent the propagation of cracks through material is also used to protect aircraft surfaces. Abler demonstrated that a plexiglass bar with incisions called [...] "kerfs" [...] and drilled holes was more than 25% stronger than one with only regularly placed incisions. Unlike tyrannosaurs, ancient predators like phytosaurs and Dimetrodon had no adaptations to prevent the crack-like serrations of their teeth from spreading when subjected to the forces of feeding.|$|E

The General Government was originally subdivided into four districts, Warsaw, Lublin, Radom, and Kraków, to which East Galicia and a part of Volhynia were added as a district in 1941. (For more detail on the territorial division of this area see General Government.)

2500|$|Between 1925 and 1940, philanthropic foundations, {{especially}} ones {{connected with}} the Rockefellers, contributed about $7million to support the Yale Institute of Human Relations and the affiliated Yerkes Laboratories of Primate Biology. The money went toward behavioral science research, which was supported by foundation officers who aimed to [...] "improve mankind" [...] under an informal, loosely defined <b>human</b> <b>engineering</b> effort. The behavioral scientists at Yale, led by President James R. Angell and psychobiologist Robert M. Yerkes, tapped into foundation largesse by crafting research programs aimed to investigate, then suggest, ways to control, sexual and social behavior. For example, Yerkes analyzed chimpanzee sexual behavior in hopes of illuminating the evolutionary underpinnings of human development and providing information that could ameliorate dysfunction. Ultimately, the behavioral-science results disappointed foundation officers, who shifted their human-engineering funds toward biological sciences.|$|E

5000|$|As it stands, {{there is}} much {{controversy}} surrounding <b>human</b> germline <b>engineering.</b> The scientific community, and global community, are quite divided regarding whether or not <b>human</b> germline <b>engineering</b> should be practiced or not. It is currently banned {{in many of the}} leading, developed countries, and highly regulated in the others due to ethical issues. The large debate lies in the possibility of eugenics if <b>human</b> germline <b>engineering</b> were to be practiced clinically. This topic is hotly debated because the side opposing human germline modification believes that it will be used to create humans with [...] "perfect", or [...] "desirable" [...] traits. Those in favor of human germline modification see it as a potential medical tool, or a medical cure for certain diseases that lie within the genetic code. There is a debate as to if this is morally acceptable as well. While typically there is a clash between religion and science, the topic of <b>human</b> germline <b>engineering</b> has shown some unity between the two fields. Several religious positions have been published with regards to <b>human</b> germline <b>engineering.</b> According to them, many see germline modification as being more moral than the alternative, which would be either discarding of the embryo, or birth of a diseased human. The main conditions when it comes to {{whether or not it is}} morally and ethically acceptable lie within the intent of the modification, and the conditions in which the engineering is done.|$|R
