40|$|AIM: To {{examine the}} effect of {{doxycycline}} on the activity of matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) and oxidative stress in <b>gastric</b> <b>tissues</b> of rats following gastric injury. METHODS: Gastric ulcers were generated in rats by administration of 70 % ethanol, and activity of doxycycline was tested by administration 30 min prior to ethanol. Similarly, {{the effect of}} doxycycline was tested in an indomethacin-induced gastric ulcer model. The activities and expression of MMPs were examined by zymography and Western blot analysis. RESULTS: Gastric injury in rats as judged by elevated ulcer indices following exposure to ulcerogen, either indomethacin or ethanol, was reversed significantly by doxycycline. Indomethacin-induced ulcerated <b>gastric</b> <b>tissues</b> exhibited about 12 -fold higher proMMP- 9 activity and about 5 -fold higher proMMP- 3 activity as compared to control tissues. Similarly, ethanol induced about 22 -fold and about 6 -fold higher proMMP- 9 and proMMP- 3 activities, respectively, in rat <b>gastric</b> <b>tissues.</b> Both proMMP- 9 and MMP- 3 activities were markedly decreased by doxycycline in ulcerogen treated rat <b>gastric</b> <b>tissues.</b> In contrast, the reduced MMP- 2 activity in ulcerated tissues was increased by doxycycline during ulcer prevention. On the other hand, doxycycline inhibited significantly proMMP- 9, - 2 and - 3 activities in vitro. In addition, doxycycline reduced oxidative load in <b>gastric</b> <b>tissues</b> and scavenged H 2 O 2 in vitro. Our results suggest a novel regulatory role of doxycycline on MMP- 2 activity in addition to inhibitory action on MMP- 9 and MMP- 3 during prevention of gastric ulcers.

However, how MMPs are regulated during nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) -induced acute gastric ulceration is not well studied. In this study, different NSAIDs (80 mg/kg b. w.) were applied to generate acute gastric ulcer in the BALB/c mouse and the regulation of MMPs were investigated. NSAIDs caused dose-dependent induction in MMP- 9 and - 3 activities and expressions in ulcerated <b>gastric</b> <b>tissues</b> along with significant infiltration of inflammatory cells and disruption of gastric mucosal layer. In addition, an increase in tumor necrosis factor (TNF) -a, interleukin (IL) - 1 b and IL- 8 expression, excessive generation of hydroxyl radical (•OH), and protein oxidation and lipid peroxidation were observed in acute ulcerated <b>gastric</b> <b>tissues.</b> In this study, the efficacy of melatonin on activities of MMP- 9 and - 3 during prevention of gastric ulcers was tested.

40|$|Abstract Background The {{prognosis}} of {{gastric cancer}} patients {{is difficult to}} predict because of defects in establishing the surgical-pathological features. Cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) {{have been found to}} play prominent role in promoting tumor growth, invasion and metastasis. Thus raises the hypothesis that the extent of CAFs prevalence may help to establish the prognosis of gastric cancer patients. Methods Immunochemistry and realtime-PCR experiments were carried out to compare the expression of proteins which are specific markers of CAFs or secreted by CAFs in the tumor and normal tissue specimens. The extent of CAFs' prevalence was graded according to immunochemical staining, and correlation was further analyzed between CAFs' prevalence and other tumor characteristics which may influence the prognosis of gastric cancer patients. Results Nearly 80 percent of normal <b>gastric</b> <b>tissues</b> were negative or weak positive for CAFs staining, while more than 60 percent of <b>gastric</b> cancer <b>tissues</b> were moderate or strong positive for CAFs staining. Realtime-PCR results also showed significant elevated expression of FAP, SDF- 1 and TGF-β 1 in <b>gastric</b> cancer <b>tissues</b> compared to normal <b>gastric</b> <b>tissues.</b> Further analysis showed that CAFs' prevalence was correlated with tumor size, depth of the tumor, lymph node metastasis, liver metastasis or peritoneum metastasis.

Our aim was to determine the expression levels of RKIP in <b>gastric</b> <b>tissues</b> and to evaluate its impact in the clinical outcome of gastric carcinoma patients. RKIP expression levels were studied by immunohistochem-istry in a series of <b>gastric</b> <b>tissues.</b> Overall, we analysed 222 non-neoplastic <b>gastric</b> <b>tissues,</b> 152 primary tumors and 42 lymph node metastasis samples. We observed that RKIP was highly expressed in ~ 83 % of non-neoplastic tissues (including normal tissue and metaplasia), was lost in ~ 56 % of primary tumors and in ~ 90 % of lymph node metastasis samples. Loss of RKIP expression was significantly associated with several markers of poor clinical outcome, including the presence of lymph node metastasis. Furthermore, the absence of RKIP protein constitutes an independent prognostic marker for these patients. In conclusion, RKIP expression is significantly lost during gastric carcinoma progression being almost absent in lymph node metastasis samples.

These results suggest that the penetration of [14 C]CLR possibly depends on elevated gastric pH, as gastric acid secretion was inhibited by LPZ, and this may be a primary factor in explaining why the concentration of [14 C]CLR at the target site, <b>gastric</b> <b>tissue,</b> was enhanced by the coadministration of LPZ...|$|E
2500|$|Gastric cancer {{develops}} within areas (field defects) of {{the stomach}} with atrophic gastritis and intestinal metaplasia: these lesions represent the cancerization ﬁeld in which (intestinal-type) gastric cancers develop. [...] In one study, the field defect was clearly demonstrated in gastric carcinogenesis using miRNA high throughput data from normal gastric mucosa (from patients who {{had never had a}} gastric malignant neoplasm), non-tumor tissue adjacent to a gastric cancer, and <b>gastric</b> cancer <b>tissue.</b> Greater than 5-fold reductions were found in four miRNAs in tumor-adjacent <b>tissues</b> and <b>gastric</b> cancers as compared to those miRNA levels in normal <b>gastric</b> <b>tissues.</b>|$|R
40|$|Gastric {{cancer is}} {{a leading cause of}} cancer-related mortality, and the {{presence}} of lymph node metastasis an important prognostic factor. Downregulation of RKIP has been associated with tumor progression and metastasis in several types of neoplasms, being currently categorized as a metastasis suppressor gene. Our aim was to determine the expression levels of RKIP in <b>gastric</b> <b>tissues</b> and to evaluate its impact in the clinical outcome of gastric carcinoma patients. RKIP expression levels were studied by immunohistochemistry in a series of <b>gastric</b> <b>tissues.</b> Overall, we analysed 222 non-neoplastic <b>gastric</b> <b>tissues,</b> 152 primary tumors and 42 lymph node metastasis samples. We observed that RKIP was highly expressed in ~ 83 % of non-neoplastic tissues (including normal tissue and metaplasia), was lost in ~ 56 % of primary tumors and in ~ 90 % of lymph node metastasis samples. Loss of RKIP expression was significantly associated with several markers of poor clinical outcome, including the presence of lymph node metastasis. Furthermore, the absence of RKIP protein constitutes an independent prognostic marker for these patients. In conclusion, RKIP expression is significantly lost during gastric carcinoma progression being almost absent in lymph node metastasis samples. Of note, we showed that the absence of RKIP expression is associated with poor outcome features of gastric cancer patients, this being also an independent prognostic marker.

40|$|Background/Aims: Previous {{studies have}} shown that p 38 MAPK is {{involved}} in gastric cancer, yet the underlying mechanism remains unclear. Methods: q-PCR, Western blot and immunohistochemistry were used to explore the expression of PP 2 A and the phosphorylation of p 38 MAPK in <b>gastric</b> cancer <b>tissues</b> and normal <b>gastric</b> <b>tissues.</b> Activated p 38 MAPK in the gastric cancer cell line MKN 45 using activator, then q-PCR, glucose uptake assay and colony formation assay were performed to determine whether p 38 MAPK promotes gastric cancer through the enhancement of glycolysis. After transfection of p 38 MAPK dominant negative mutation (p 38 DN) into MKN 45 cells or MKN 45 cells treated with an inhibitor of p 38 MAPK, Western blot was performed to detect the expression of GLUT- 4. The knock down of MEF 2 α in MKN 45 cells by siRNA was followed by Western blot and luciferase reporter assay to investigate the underlying mechanism of the role of p 38 MAPK in the promotion of gastric cancer. Finally, q-PCR, Western blot and immunohistochemistry were performed to examine GLUT- 4 expression in <b>gastric</b> cancer <b>tissues</b> and normal <b>gastric</b> <b>tissues.</b> Results: We found that p 38 MAPK activation significantly increases GLUT- 4 expression and promotes glucose uptake and cell growth in gastric cancer cells. Inhibition of p 38 MAPK abrogates the up-regulation of GLUT- 4. MEF 2 α knockdown abolishes p 38 MAPK-mediated GLUT- 4 up-regulation. PP 2 A, an inhibitor of p 38 MAPK, is down-regulated in <b>gastric</b> cancer <b>tissues,</b> which might contribute to the activation of p 38 MAPK. Conclusions: Our data indicate that the abnormal activation of p 38 MAPK promotes glycolysis within gastric cancer cells through the upregulation of GLUT- 4 in a MEF 2 a-dependent manner...|$|R
