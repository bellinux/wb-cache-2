5|$|Laguna Canyon and {{its side}} tributaries have {{received}} some <b>flood</b> <b>control</b> modifications. These include debris basins {{at the mouth}} of nearly every major tributary, stretches of lined or unlined <b>flood</b> <b>control</b> channels, and other structures. The debris basins, sometimes called retention basins, are circular depressions constructed by the Orange County <b>Flood</b> <b>Control</b> Division to slow down flash floods. The upper Laguna Canyon area has a few <b>flood</b> <b>control</b> channels and the lower creek is encased entirely in one; this begins as a riprap channel with an unlined bottom, which transitions to a concrete culvert. These improvements help to protect infrastructure in the canyon from storm and landslide damage.|$|E
5|$|Economic {{stability}} {{returned with}} the U.S. entry into World War II in 1941, when demand for the state's agricultural and industrial products grew as the nation mobilized for war. In 1944, the Pick–Sloan Plan was passed {{as part of the}} <b>Flood</b> <b>Control</b> Act of 1944 by the U.S. Congress, resulting in the construction of six large dams on the Missouri River, four of which are at least partially in South Dakota. <b>Flood</b> <b>control,</b> hydroelectricity, and recreational opportunities such as boating and fishing are provided by the dams and their reservoirs.|$|E
5|$|In 1948 floods {{swept through}} the Columbia watershed, {{destroying}} Vanport, then the second largest city in Oregon, and impacting cities {{as far north as}} Trail, British Columbia. The flooding prompted the United States Congress to pass the <b>Flood</b> <b>Control</b> Act of 1950, authorizing the federal development of additional dams and other <b>flood</b> <b>control</b> mechanisms. By that time local communities had become wary of federal hydroelectric projects, and sought local control of new developments; a public utility district in Grant County, Washington, ultimately began construction of the dam at Priest Rapids.|$|E

40|$|In July, 2005, eighty-nine police {{soldiers}} died directly {{owing to}} one big reservoir dam collapse {{in a heavy}} rainstorm day in FuJian province, China. In 1975, the dam of ZuMaDian Reservoir collapsed, and then over 260 thousand people died. In 1979, the dam of Manzu 2 Reservoir in India collapsed, and then about 5000 people died. In 1889, the dam American Johnston Reservoir collapsed, and then about 4000 people died. Frequently, it was supervisor's wrong reservoir <b>flood</b> prevention <b>control</b> that resulted in dam collapse. Reservoir <b>flood</b> prevention <b>control</b> is very complicated that it's necessary to apply information technique to support <b>flood</b> prevention <b>control</b> decision. Informationization of Big Reservoir <b>Flood</b> Prevention <b>Control</b> mainly includes the following contents: (1) acquiring basal reservoir data or flood data by full-digital photography and measure technique, remote monitoring, remote sensing, geographical information system, GPS, etc; (2) constructing digital reservoir <b>flood</b> prevention <b>control</b> management information system and three-dimensional virtual reservoir environment; (3) simulating and analyzing the scheme of reservoir <b>flood</b> prevention <b>control</b> based on massive history data analysis and scientific calculation according to professional reservoir flood prevention mathematic models; (4) providing <b>flood</b> prevention <b>control</b> suggestions for reservoir supervisor.

30|$|In {{addition}} to the <b>flooding</b> <b>control</b> based on mobility factors, the number of hops can also be limited {{in order to reduce}} overhead. This is possible as long as the type of scenario is known to the system. The average number of hops which form the communication routes can be estimated from previous simulations. A conservative control of number of hops is proposed. In the proposed <b>flooding</b> <b>control</b> scheme, whenever a node receives a request packet which has been forwarded K + 1 times, where K is the average number of hops previously calculated by simulation, it will not forward the received request packet any more. This proposed <b>flooding</b> <b>control</b> avoids control packets being forwarded more than it is necessary. Notice that this technique has to be implemented with care since it directly affects the performance of AODV. The improved discovery procedure can easily be added to the proposed AODV based on the decision tree, resulting in a very significant improvement of the route selection scheme of AODV.|$|R

5|$|Coolidge {{has often}} been criticized for his actions during the Great Mississippi Flood of 1927, the worst natural {{disaster}} to hit the Gulf Coast until Hurricane Katrina in 2005. Although he did eventually name Secretary Hoover to a commission in charge of flood relief, scholars argue that Coolidge overall showed {{a lack of interest}} in federal <b>flood</b> <b>control.</b> Coolidge did not believe that personally visiting the region after the floods would accomplish anything, {{and that it would be}} seen as mere political grandstanding. He also did not want to incur the federal spending that <b>flood</b> <b>control</b> would require; he believed property owners should bear much of the cost. On the other hand, Congress wanted a bill that would place the federal government completely in charge of flood mitigation. When Congress passed a compromise measure in 1928, Coolidge declined to take credit for it and signed the bill in private on May 15.|$|E
5|$|In January1929, Fred C.

40|$|In this paper, {{we address}} a {{fundamental}} problem concerning the best flooding strategy to minimize cost and latency for target discovery in wireless networks. Should we flood the network only once {{to search for}} the target, or should we apply a so-called "expansion ring" mechanism to reduce the cost? If the "expansion ring" mechanism is better in terms of the average cost, how many rings should there be and what should be the radius of each ring? We separate wireless networks based on network scale and <b>flooding</b> <b>control</b> methods and explore these questions. We prove that when using a geography-based <b>flooding</b> <b>control</b> method, the number of flooding attempts should be one. When using a hop-based <b>flooding</b> <b>control</b> method, we prove that two-tier and three-tier schemes can reduce the cost of flooding compared to a single attempt. We provide a general formula to determine good parameters for the two-tier and threetier hop-based flooding schemes. Through simulations, we show that choosing flooding parameters according to our techniques gives performance close to that of ideal flooding schemes. Also, we present some preliminary results on flooding strategy with caching and show that a properly chosen searching radius can save much more query overhead than a simple radius selection scheme...|$|R

5|$|Oroville Dam is an earthfill {{embankment}} dam on the Feather River {{east of the}} city of Oroville, California, in the Sierra Nevada foothills east of the Sacramento Valley. At 770 feet (235m) high, it is the tallest dam in the U.S. and serves mainly for water supply, hydroelectricity generation and <b>flood</b> <b>control.</b> The dam impounds Lake Oroville, the second largest man-made lake in the state of California, capable of storing more than 3.5 million acre-feet (4.4km3).|$|E
5|$|Starting in the 1850s {{during the}} California Gold Rush, {{the city of}} Sacramento rapidly grew around the {{confluence}} of the Sacramento River and its tributary the American River, near the middle of the Central Valley of California. The city's increasing population necessitated the construction of an extensive system of levees on the two rivers to prevent flooding. These early <b>flood</b> <b>control</b> works were insufficient; in 1862, the city was inundated so completely that the state government was temporarily moved to San Francisco. In 1956, the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers built the Folsom Dam at {{the confluence of the}} North and South Forks of the American River to provide <b>flood</b> <b>control</b> for the Sacramento metropolitan area. However, the Folsom Dam with a capacity of just 1 million acre feet (1.2 km3) compared to the annual American River flow of 2.7 million acre feet (3.3 km3) proved inadequate. A flood in 1955 filled the Folsom Reservoir to capacity, before the dam was even completed; it has also overflowed many times since.|$|E

40|$|Detention tank {{plays an}} {{important}} role in the <b>flooding</b> <b>control</b> in the downstream areas of the urban stormwater drainage system (USDS) during the wet weather seasons. For complex watersheds with specific local <b>flooding</b> <b>control</b> policies, the conventional optimization and design methods are found to be not sufficient for effectively and optimally locating and sizing appropriate detention tanks any more. This paper investigates the optimal design of detention tanks under the constraints of local <b>flooding</b> <b>control</b> criteria, with the aim to develop an efficient and robust method and framework for the design of detention tank network. Coupled with the SWMM-based hydraulic simulation, a modified particle swarm optimizer is adopted to find out non-dominated solutions to minimize both the engineering cost and flooding risks by taking the local design criteria into consideration for the more realistic local engineering application. To validate the proposed method, a real-life case in SA city in China is taken for example to obtain optimal layout and sizes of the detention tank network under different construction factors and design conditions. Different rainfall return periods are also tested to guarantee the robustness of the optimal solutions. The results of this study confirm the feasibility and validity of the proposed methodological framework for multi-objective optimal design of detention tanks in the USDS.

40|$|Bangladesh is {{vulnerable}} to climatic changes, {{and there has been}} a serious debate about the occurrence and the relationship with the frequency of flooding. For example, in Dhaka, further <b>flood</b> <b>controls</b> are claimed to be necessary due to a change of climatic patterns and more frequent flood events. Despite the importance of this topic, it has received little research attention. Thus, we examine (i) whether a temporal change in climate variables is occurring, (ii) local people’s perceptions to climate and (iii) cooperative attitudes toward <b>flood</b> <b>controls.</b> We conducted face-to-face surveys with 1, 011 respondents of different social and demographic strata and seven experts in Bangladesh. Using these data, we first derive a temporal trend of climate variables and analyze how closely people’s perceptions align with the climate data. Second, we examine the willingness to pay for <b>flood</b> <b>controls</b> as a proxy of cooperative attitudes, and characterize the determinants in relation to perceptions to climate as well as socio-economic characteristics. We obtain the following principal results. First, some climate variables are identified to exhibit clear upward or downward trends, but most people correctly perceive such temporal changes. More specifically, people’s perceptions and our statistical analysis are identical in the qualitative changes of climate. Second, people who correctly perceive climatic changes tend to express a higher WTP than those who do not. Overall, these findings suggest that accurate climate perceptions are keys to increasing cooperation into managing climate change and related disasters...|$|R
