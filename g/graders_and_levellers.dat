40|$|Five {{experiments}} (conducted in 1968 on observing {{responses and}} vigilance, reward preterences, and learning strategies in concept formation) indicate that socioeconomic level (SEL) has {{an influence on}} intellectual and educational functioning of elementary school children. Expectation of reinforcement was tested in experiment 1, using 60 kindergartners. Low SEL children rapidly stopped making observing responses when an expected event did not occur, while high SEL children maintained a significant rate of observing responses. In experiment 2, 32 second <b>graders</b> <b>and</b> 24 fourth <b>graders</b> were tested to investigate left-right directional preference. Fourth <b>graders</b> <b>and</b> high SEL second graders performed with more directional responses than did low SEL second <b>graders.</b> Reward preferences <b>and</b> reinforcement were investigated in 60 kindergartners in experiment 3. Low SEL children had significantly greater preference for consistency than high SEL children. Experiment 5 tested 60 first <b>graders</b> <b>and</b> indicated that the chaotic reinforcement variable alone produces deterioration of performance. Comparatively, low SEL children failed to observe environmental stimuli not previously conditioned to learned responses. Furthe...|$|R
