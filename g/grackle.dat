5|$|Carancahua Bay is {{protected}} by the State of Texas and locally by the 300-member Carancahua Bay Protection Association. It is a nursery bay for shrimp, and is a habitat for shellfish including oysters. Finfish such as the redfish and black drum are commonly caught from the bay by recreational fishermen. Birds common to the bay include the wood ibis, roseate spoonbill, snowy egret, great-tailed <b>grackle,</b> Louisiana heron, willet, black-necked stilt, caracara and the black vulture.|$|E
5|$|Bird predators may seize {{anywhere}} from 7% to 75% of the progeny in a breeding colony. The fish crow (Corvus ossifragus) is common raider of American white ibis nests, accounting {{for up to}} 44% of egg loss in a field study at Battery Island, North Carolina. Other predators of eggs and young include the boat-tailed <b>grackle</b> (Quiscalus major), black-crowned night heron (Nycticorax nycticorax), gulls, and possibly vultures, {{as well as the}} common opossum (Didelphis marsupialis), raccoon (Procyon lotor), and rat snakes (Elaphe species). Egg predation rates of the American white ibis decline with nest age owing to increased nest attentiveness by the parents, especially during the last week of incubation. High nest densities and reduced synchrony increase egg predation rates because of the increased opportunities afforded by the longer incubation times, as well as the greater availability of nests available for predation.|$|E

The <b>grackles</b> were collected in areas near the towns, as they were gathered the day before rituals were to be held. However, hunting is not {{believed to be a}} major cause for the <b>grackles</b> extinction, and may have instead caused the <b>grackles</b> to become locally extinct in the areas around towns.|$|R
40|$|Investigations from 1969 through 1971 of bird {{damage to}} peanuts in south-central Oklahoma {{have shown that}} losses are caused mainly by common <b>grackles</b> (Quiscalus quiscula). These losses, as high as $ 36 per acre, have been reduced {{primarily}} {{through the use of}} exploders and early harvesting of the crop. A fright-producing chemical, 4 -aminopyridine, was also effective in scaring <b>grackles</b> from windrowed peanut fields. Banding has shown that many of these <b>grackles</b> breed in western Nebraska and Kansas and winter in northeastern Texas...|$|R

500|$|The blue-faced honeyeater {{was first}} {{described}} by ornithologist John Latham in his 1801 work Supplementum Indicis Ornithologici, sive Systematis Ornithologiae. However, {{he described it}} as three separate species, seemingly not knowing {{it was the same}} bird in each case: The blue-eared <b>grackle</b> (Gracula cyanotis), the blue-cheeked bee-eater (Merops cyanops), and as the blue-cheeked thrush (Turdus cyanous). It was as the blue-cheeked bee-eater that it was painted between 1788 and 1797 by Thomas Watling, one of a group known collectively as the Port Jackson Painter. It was reclassified in the genus Entomyzon, which was erected by William Swainson in 1825, who observed the [...] "Blue-faced Grakle" [...] as the only insectivorous member of the genus and posited it was a link between the smaller honeyeaters and the riflebirds of the genus Ptiloris. The generic name is derived from the Ancient Greek ento-/εντο- ("inside") and myzein/μυζειν [...] "to drink" [...] or [...] "suck". The specific epithet, cyanotis, means [...] "blue-eared" [...] and combines cyano-/κυανο- [...] "blue" [...] with otis, a Latinised form of ωτος, the Greek genitive of ous/ους [...] "ear". Swainson spelt it Entomiza in an 1837 publication, and George Gray wrote Entomyza in 1840.|$|E

2500|$|In one study, mothballs (which contain napthalene) {{were placed}} in a flowerbed. [...] A common <b>grackle</b> picked one out, {{extended}} its left wing and rubbed the mothball {{up and down the}} length of the shaft of each of the secondary feathers. [...] The <b>grackle</b> went on to rub the mothball over its secondary coverts on the ventral side and onto the propatagium area. [...] The <b>grackle</b> then repeated the same rubbing actions on its right wing. [...] The entire rubbing behaviour lasted approximately 10 minutes. European starlings also performed a similar behaviour with mothballs.|$|E

2500|$|In 1959, Geisel {{authorized}} Revell, {{the well-known}} plastic model-making company, {{to make a}} series of [...] "animals" [...] that snapped together rather than being glued together, and could be assembled, disassembled, and re-assembled [...] "in thousands" [...] of ways. The series was called the [...] "Dr. Seuss Zoo" [...] and included Gowdy the Dowdy <b>Grackle,</b> Norval the Bashful Blinket, Tingo the Noodle Topped Stroodle, and Roscoe the Many Footed Lion. The basic body parts were the same and all were interchangeable, {{and so it was}} possible for children to combine parts from various characters in essentially unlimited ways in creating their own animal characters (Revell encouraged this by selling Gowdy, Norval, and Tingo together in a [...] "Gift Set" [...] as well as individually).

40|$|Behavioral {{flexibility}} {{is considered an}} important trait for adapting to environmental change, but {{it is unclear what}} it is, how it works, and whether it is a problem solving ability. I investigated behavioral flexibility and problem solving experimentally in great-tailed <b>grackles,</b> an invasive bird species and thus a likely candidate for possessing behavioral flexibility. <b>Grackles</b> demonstrated behavioral flexibility in two contexts, the Aesop’s Fable paradigm and a color association test. Contrary to predictions, behavioral flexibility did not correlate across contexts. Four out of 6 <b>grackles</b> exhibited efficient problem solving abilities, but problem solving efficiency {{did not appear to be}} directly linked with behavioral flexibility. Problem solving speed also did not significantly correlate with reversal learning scores, indicating that faster learners were not the most flexible. These results reveal how little we know about behavioral flexibility, and provide an immense opportunity for future research to explore how individuals and species can use behavior to react to changing environments...|$|R

6000|$|... "It's Creaker the <b>Grackle.</b> He {{was one of}} {{the first}} to arrive this spring and I'm ashamed of myself for not having called on him," [...] thought Peter, as he hopped out and started across the Green Meadows towards Creaker. [...] "What a splendid long tail he has. I believe Jenny Wren told me that he belongs to the Blackbird family. He looks so much like Blacky the Crow that I suppose this is why they call him Crow Blackbird." ...|$|E
60|$|It was true. Creaker the <b>Grackle</b> {{with the}} sun shining on him was truly beautiful. His head and neck, his throat and upper breast, were a shining blue-black, while his back was a rich, shining brassy-green. His wings and tail were much like his head and neck. As Peter watched {{it seemed as if}} the colors were {{constantly}} changing. This changing of colors is called iridescence. One other thing Peter noticed and this was that Creaker's eyes were yellow. Just at the moment Peter couldn't remember any other bird with yellow eyes.|$|E
60|$|On the 17th, {{the steamer}} not having arrived, the coal-ship left, having lain here a month, {{according}} to her contract; and {{on the same day}} my hunters went out to shoot for the first time, and brought home a magnificent crown pigeon and a few common birds. The next day they were more successful, and I was delighted to see them return with a Bird of Paradise in full plumage, a pair of the fine Papuan lories (Lorius domicella), four other lories and parroquets, a <b>grackle</b> (Gracula dumonti), a king-hunter (Dacelo gaudichaudi), a racquet-tailed kingfisher (Tanysiptera galatea), and two or three other birds of less beauty.|$|E
40|$|The {{behavior}} of red-winged blackbirds {Agelaius phoemcei/s), common <b>grackles</b> (Quiscalus quiscula), brown-headed cowbirds (Molothrus ater), and juvenile European starlings (Sturnus vulgaris) feeding on ears of corn was studied in an aviary. The species differed significantly in their propensity to attack (penetrate the husk and feed on kernels) ears of corn. Redwings and starlings were more active attackers than <b>grackles</b> and cowbirds. Female redwings were generally more active attackers than males, but less efficient at opening husks and damaging ears. Redwings and starlings used primarily the gaping technique to penetrate husks and expose kernels. Redwings more commonly penetrated {{the side of}} the husk, whereas starlings gaped through the silk channel. <b>Grackles</b> did not gape; rather they pecked through the husk, keeping the bill closed. Cowbirds used gaping, but were the least efficient at penetrating the husk. The findings {{of this study suggest that}} by increasing the thickness and strength of the husks and the extension of the husk beyond the ear tip, varieties of corn can be made more resistant to damage by birds...|$|R
50|$|<b>Grackles</b> tend to congregate {{in large}} groups, popularly {{referred}} to as a plague or annoyance. This enables them to detect birds invading their territory, and predators, which are mobbed en masse to deter the intruders.|$|R

60|$|Butcher the Shrike was not {{the only}} {{newcomer}} in the Old Orchard. There was another stranger who, Peter Rabbit soon discovered, was looked on with some suspicion by all the other birds of the Old Orchard. The first time Peter saw him, he was walking about on the ground some distance off. He didn't hop but walked, and at that distance he looked all black. The way he carried himself and his movements as he walked made Peter think of Creaker the <b>Grackle.</b> In fact, Peter mistook him for Creaker. That was because he didn't really look at him. If he had he would have seen at once that the stranger was smaller than Creaker.|$|E

50|$|The great-tailed <b>grackle</b> and boat-tailed <b>grackle</b> were {{considered}} {{the same species}} until genetic analyses distinguished them as two separate species.|$|E
50|$|Great-tailed <b>grackles</b> are {{medium-sized}} birds (larger than starlings {{and smaller}} than crows; 38 cm-46 cm) with males weighing 203 g-265 g and females between 115 g-142 g, and both sexes have long tails. Males are iridescent black with a purple-blue sheen on the feathers {{of the head}} and upper body, while females are brown with darker wings and tail. Adults of both sexes have bright yellow eyes, while juveniles of both sexes have brown eyes and brown plumage like females (except for streaks on the breast). Great-tailed <b>grackles,</b> particularly the adult males, have a keel-shaped tail that they can fold vertically by aligning the two halves.|$|R
50|$|The Carib <b>grackle's</b> song is {{a mixture}} of harsh and more musical ringing notes, with a bell-like tickita-tickita-tickita-ting and a rapid chi-chi-chi-chi being typical. The calls vary in dialect between islands and the bird usually fluffs up its {{feathers}} when calling.|$|R
5|$|The {{icterids}} are a {{group of}} small to medium-sized, often colorful, passerines restricted to the New World, including the <b>grackles,</b> New World blackbirds and New World orioles. Most have black as a predominant plumage color, often enlivened by yellow, orange or red.|$|R
