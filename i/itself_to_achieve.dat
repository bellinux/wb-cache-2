On his arrival, Kippenberger conducted a survey of the terrain and recommended to Freyberg that the attack plan be modified to include an additional brigade, a recommendation Freyberg concurred with. The reorganised attack was successfully executed on the evening of 28 November with light casualties. The 2nd Division then attempted three times to capture the town of Orsogna. The second attack on the town of 7 December was the first to involve the 5th Brigade.

5000|$|She {{found herself}} always {{lingering}} between applied and fine arts, producing applied art which you can’t apply and design with no practical function, but abstraction of function, making minimal invasive changes that render an object’s reality into fiction: the transcendence of the inanimate {{into something that}} has psychological or moral conditions. Interested in shape and order, she has always looked for unlikely places. She experimented with the tension that results from tampering with order, reversing it, abstracting it {{to the point where}} the result loses all connection with its basis. This way the beauty, the absurdity, or even the humor of an objects gains a new kind of visibility that was lost before the profanity of its function. The observer’s challenge would be the translation: she considers that only the context of Art, the undemanding, unencumbered space of an exhibition, facilitates the chance of a change of perspective, where in the function-free environment, the gaze meets the object in a way that gives it another life - or even: a life.Each of her objects presentation is an integral part of the work <b>itself.</b> <b>To</b> <b>achieve</b> this she sometimes [...] "borrows” from others.
