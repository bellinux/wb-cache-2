25|$|The other {{exception}} <b>has</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> rather peculiar case {{of psychic}} phenomena, one which I find myself unable to classify.... I {{was brought in}} contact with it, {{in the summer of}} 1911, and I have had it under my observation more or less ever since, having been present at probably 250 of the night sessions, many of which have been attended by a stenographer who made voluminous notes. A thorough study of this case has convinced me that it is not one of ordinary trance.... This man is utterly unconscious, wholly oblivious to what takes place, and, unless told about it subsequently, never knows that he {{has been used as a}} sort of clearing house for the coming and going of alleged extra-planetary personalities.... Psychoanalysis, hypnotism, intensive comparison, fail to show that the written or spoken messages of this individual have origin in his own mind. Much of the material secured through this subject is quite contrary to his habits of thought, to the way in which he has been taught, and to his entire philosophy. In fact, of much that we have secured, we have failed to find anything of its nature in existence.|$|E

2500|$|Another {{explanation}} {{of the relationship between}} language and theory of mind development <b>has</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> child's understanding of mental state words such as [...] "think" [...] and [...] "believe". Since a mental state is not something that one can observe from behavior, children must learn the meanings of words denoting mental states from verbal explanations alone, requiring knowledge of the syntactic rules, semantic systems, and pragmatics of a language. Studies have shown that understanding of these mental state words predicts theory of mind in four-year-olds.|$|E
2500|$|Many older North American sockets {{have two}} {{different}} current and voltage ratings, most commonly 10A 250V/15A 125V. This <b>has</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> peculiarity of the National Electrical Code from 1923 to the 1950s. Originally, sockets were rated at 10A 250V, because the NEC limited lighting circuits to 10A. In 1923, the code changed to allow lighting circuits {{to be fused}} at 15A, but the previous 10A rule still applied to circuits over 125V. The higher voltages were rarely used for lighting and appliances. Most sockets with this rating are of the [...] "T-slot" [...] type.|$|E

2500|$|Little {{is learned}} about Pozzo besides {{the fact that}} he is on his way to the fair to sell his slave, Lucky. He {{presents}} himself very much as the Ascendancy landlord, bullying and conceited. His pipe is made by Kapp and Peterson, Dublin's best-known tobacconists (their slogan was 'The thinking man's pipe') which he refers to as a [...] "briar" [...] but which Estragon calls a [...] "dudeen" [...] emphasising the differences in their social standing. He confesses to a poor memory but it is more a result of an abiding self-absorption. [...] "Pozzo is a character who has to overcompensate. That's why he overdoes things ... and his overcompensation <b>has</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> deep insecurity in him. These were things Beckett said, psychological terms he used." ...|$|E
2500|$|Healthy narcissism <b>has</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> {{strong feeling}} of [...] "own love" [...] {{protecting}} {{the human being}} against illness. Eventually, however, the individual must love the other, [...] "the object love to not become ill". The individual becomes ill {{as a result of}} the frustration created when he is unable to love the object. In pathological narcissism such as the narcissistic personality disorder, the person's libido has been withdrawn from objects in the world and produces megalomania. The clinical theorists Kernberg, Kohut and Millon all see pathological narcissism as a possible outcome in response to unempathic and inconsistent early childhood interactions. They suggested that narcissists try to compensate in adult relationships. The pathological condition of narcissism is, as Freud suggested, a magnified, extreme manifestation of healthy narcissism.|$|E
2500|$|Hart in 1857 stated:-"The {{quality of}} mind {{which is most}} {{apparent}} in Miss Sedgwick's writings is that of strength. The reader feels at every step that he <b>has</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> vigorous and active intellect. Another quality, resulting from this possession of power, is the entire absence of affectation of every kind. There is no straining for effect, no mere verbal prettinesses. The discourse proceeds with the utmost simplicity and directness, as though the author were more intent upon what she is saying than how she says it. As a novelist, Sedgwick has {{for the most part}} wisely chosen American subjects. The local traditions, scenery, manners, and costume, being thus entirely familiar, she has had greater freedom in the exercise of the creative faculty, on which, after all, real eminence in the art mainly depends. Her characters are conceived with distinctness, and are minutely individual and consistent, while her plot always shows a mind fertile in resources and a happy adaptation of means to ends." ...|$|E

2500|$|Kierkegaard also {{stresses}} the importance of the self, and the self's relation to the world, as being grounded in self-reflection and introspection. He argued in Concluding Unscientific Postscript to Philosophical Fragments that [...] "subjectivity is truth" [...] and [...] "truth is subjectivity." [...] This <b>has</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> distinction between what is objectively true and an individual's subjective relation (such as indifference or commitment) to that truth. People who in some sense believe the same things may relate to those beliefs quite differently. Two individuals may both believe that many of those around them are poor and deserve help, but this knowledge may lead only one of them to decide to actually help the poor. This is how Kierkegaard put it: [...] "What a priceless invention statistics are, what a glorious fruit of culture, what a characteristic counterpart to the de te narratur fabula [...] of antiquity. Schleiermacher so enthusiastically declares that knowledge does not perturb religiousness, and that the religious person does not sit safeguarded by a lightning rod and scoff at God; yet with the help of statistical tables one laughs at all of life." [...] In other words, Kierkegaard says: [...] "Who has the more difficult task: the teacher who lectures on earnest things a meteor's distance from everyday life – or the learner who should put it to use?" [...] This is how it was summed up in 1940.|$|E
2500|$|N.T. Wright, {{the former}} Anglican bishop and {{professor}} of NT history at Cambridge and Oxford, now Research Professor of New Testament and Early Christianity at St Mary's College in the University of St Andrews in Scotland, also sees the dating of Thomas in the 2nd or 3rd century A.D. Wright's reasoning for this dating is that the [...] "narrative framework" [...] of 1st century Judaism and the New Testament is radically different from the worldview expressed in the sayings collected in the Gospel of Thomas. Thomas makes an anachronistic mistake by turning Jesus the Jewish prophet into a Hellenistic/Cynic philosopher. Wright concludes his section on the Gospel of Thomas in his book The New Testament and the People of God in this way: [...] " [...] implicit story <b>has</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> figure who imparts a secret, hidden wisdom to those close to him, {{so that they can}} perceive a new truth and be saved by it. 'The Thomas Christians are told the truth about their divine origins, and given the secret passwords that will prove effective in the return journey to their heavenly home.' This is, obviously, the non-historical story of Gnosticism... It is simply the case that, on good historical grounds, it is far more likely that the book represents a radical translation, and indeed subversion, of first-century Christianity into a quite different sort of religion, than that it represents the original of which the longer gospels are distortions... Thomas reflects a symbolic universe, and a worldview, which are radically {{different from those of the}} early Judaism and Christianity." ...|$|E
2500|$|Several {{explanations}} {{have been}} offered for Yale's representation in national elections {{since the end of}} the Vietnam War. Various sources note the spirit of campus activism that has existed at Yale since the 1960s, and the intellectual influence of Reverend William Sloane Coffin on many of the future candidates. Yale President Richard Levin attributes the run to Yale's focus on creating [...] "a laboratory for future leaders," [...] an institutional priority that began during the tenure of Yale Presidents Alfred Whitney Griswold and Kingman Brewster. Richard H. Brodhead, former dean of Yale College and now president of Duke University, stated: [...] "We do give very significant attention to orientation to the community in our admissions, and there is a very strong tradition of volunteerism at Yale." [...] Yale historian Gaddis Smith notes [...] "an ethos of organized activity" [...] at Yale during the 20th century that led John Kerry to lead the Yale Political Union's Liberal Party, George Pataki the Conservative Party, and Joseph Lieberman to manage the Yale Daily News. Camille Paglia points to a history of networking and elitism: [...] "It <b>has</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> web of friendships and affiliations built up in school." [...] CNN suggests that George W. Bush benefited from preferential admissions policies for the [...] "son and grandson of alumni", and for a [...] "member of a politically influential family". New York Times correspondent Elisabeth Bumiller and The Atlantic Monthly correspondent James Fallows credit the culture of community and cooperation that exists between students, faculty, and administration, which downplays self-interest and reinforces commitment to others.|$|E
