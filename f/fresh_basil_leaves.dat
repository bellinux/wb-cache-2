The Chinese also use fresh or dried basils in soups and other foods. In Taiwan, people add <b>fresh</b> <b>basil</b> <b>leaves</b> to thick soups. They also eat fried chicken with deep-fried basil leaves. Basil ({{most commonly}} Thai basil) is commonly steeped in cream or milk to create an interesting flavor in ice cream or chocolates (such as truffles). The leaves {{are not the only}} part of basil used in culinary applications, the flower buds have a more subtle flavor and they are edible.|$|E

Those portions of the vespers and matins which in sundry local customs take place before the Icon of the Feast (e.g.,the chanting of the Polyeleos and the Matins Gospel) instead take place in front of the Holy Table. The bringing out of the cross and the exaltation ceremony occur at matins.|$|E
40|$|The {{objectives}} {{of this study}} were to determine best conditions for the extraction of phenolic compounds from fresh, frozen and lyophilized basil leaves. The acetone mixtures with the highest addition of acetic acid extracted most of the phenolic compounds when fresh and freeze-dried material have been used. The three times procedure was more effective than once shaking procedure in most of the extracts obtained from <b>fresh</b> <b>basil</b> <b>leaves</b> – unlike the extracts derived from frozen material. Surprisingly, there were not any significant differences in the content of phenolics between the two used procedures in the case of lyophilized basil leaves used for extraction. Additionally, the positive correlation between the phenolic compounds content and antioxidant activity of the studied extracts has been noted. It is concluded that the acetone mixtures were more effective than the methanol ones for polyphenol extraction. The number of extraction steps in most of the cases was also a statistically significant factor affecting the yield of phenolic extraction as well as antioxidant potential of basil leaf extracts...|$|E

Though recent research casts doubt on this legend, the tale holds that, in 1889, he baked three different pizzas for the visit of King Umberto I and Queen Margherita of Savoy. The Queen's favorite was a pizza evoking {{the colors of the}} Italian flag—green (<b>basil</b> <b>leaves),</b> white (mozzarella), and red (tomatoes).

40|$|There are {{distinct}} varieties of basil {{types in the}} genus Ocimum which makes them very special. Genus Ocimum is widespread over Asia, Africa and Central & Southern America. All basils are member of the Lamiacea e family. The colors of the leaves vary from bright green to purple-green and sometimes almost black. <b>Fresh</b> <b>basil</b> <b>leaves</b> have a strong and characteristic aroma, not comparable to any other spice, {{although there is a}} hint of clove traceable. Ocimum Sanctum, also addressed as Ocimum Tenuiflorum is a sacred plant in the Hindu culture and known as Tulasi in Tamil or Holy Basil in English. Meanwhile Ocimum Basilicum, known as Common or Sweet Basil has very dark green leaves. The genus Ocimum is cultivated for its remarkable essential oil which exhibits many usages such as in medicinal application, herbs, culinary, perfume for herbal toiletries, aromatherapy treatment and as flavoring agent. Due to varying essential oil profiles even within the same species, plants may often be classified as a different species as a result of different scents. In the present study, volatile constituents of Ocimum Sanctum and Ocimum Basilicum were extracted using various solvents and their chemical constituents were identified and quantified by using GC-MS in optimized conditions. The profiles of extract from both species were compared in an effort to investigate effects of seasonal variation on their chemical compositions. The predominant species in Ocimum Sanctum and Ocimum Basilicum was found to be methyl eugenol and methyl chavicol, respectively, during different months of analysis...|$|E

40|$|This {{research}} was conducted to identify volatile compounds of pluchea and basil essential oils and their antioxidant capacity to scavenge a DPPH (1, 1 -diphenyl- 2 -picrylhidrazyl) free radical and inhibit lipid peroxidation. Essential oil of pluchea and <b>basil</b> <b>leaves</b> was prepared by hydrodistillation method and then their volatile compounds were identified by GC-MS. The volatile compounds in the essential oil of pluchea leaves consist of 66 components with (10 S, 11 S) -Himachala- 3 -(12) - 4 -diene (17. 13 %) made up the highest proportion of volatile compounds. <b>Basil</b> <b>leaves</b> had 70 volatile components in which the major components were (E) - 3, 7 -dimethyl- 2, 6 -octadienal (23. 98 %) and (Z) - 3, 7 -dimethyl- 2, 6 -octadienal (17. 35 %).
