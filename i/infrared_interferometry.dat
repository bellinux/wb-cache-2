40|$|The {{increased}} demand for modern optical components necessitates an interferometric system that can rapidly and accurately measure wavefront phase errors during the complete fabrication process, from generation to polishing. The suitability of infrared wavelengths for several optical testing applications is well known, as are the greatly increased speed and accuracy of phase-shifting interferometric techniques. Therefore, this dissertation discusses extensively three topics: (1) the demonstration theoretically and experimentally of the feasibility of using a pyroelectric vidicon for <b>infrared</b> phase-shifting <b>interferometry,</b> (2) the design and fabrication of a prototype next-generation optical shop infrared phase-shifting interferometric system, and (3) the definition and quantification of the fundamental system performance parameters and limitations.

There is also some evidence that Alpha Arae is orbited by a companion at 0.7 AU.|$|E

40|$|Recent {{advances}} in <b>infrared</b> speckle <b>interferometry</b> reported by Ridgway, et al.

When combined with recent data on the thermal annealing and hydrous alteration rates of amorphous magnesium silicate grains, this information allows one to predict that grains heated to high temperatures around stars such as NML Cygnus will be more crystalline than will cooler grains around stars like IRC + 10420. In 1985, Jura and Morris (1985) showed that water vapor can condense on previously nucleated refractory grains in some stellar outflows. Stochastic heating events might provide sufficient energy to produce hydrated silicates from orginally amorphous grains provided that the loss of water from such materials does not occur too rapidly. Observable consequences of both types of grain processing are discussed...|$|R

40|$|Exponential filtering, {{together}} with an improved version of the iterative Fourier-transform algorithm, is applied to image reconstruction from one-dimensional <b>infrared</b> stellar speckle <b>interferometry</b> data. The performance of the method is checked first by computer simulations with both noiseless and noisy data {{and then with a}} realistic simulation of one-dimensional <b>infrared</b> stellar speckle <b>interferometry.</b> We have seen no problems with convergence. The only problem that we found was an expected noisy appearance of the results when noisy data were simulated. Finally, the method was applied to observational specklegrams of the infrared source IRC + 10216, in two standard photometric bands: K and M (2. 2 and 5 m, respectively).

40|$|We {{propose a}} new family of {{achromatic}} phase shifters for <b>infrared</b> nulling <b>interferometry.</b> These key optical components {{can be seen as}} optimized Fresnel rhombs, using the total internal reflection phenomenon, modulated or not. The total internal reflection indeed comes with a phase shift between the polarization components of the incident light. We propose a solution to implement this vectorial phase shift between interferometer arms to provide the destructive interference process needed to disentangle highly contrasted objects from one another. We also show that, modulating the index transition at the total internal reflection interface allows compensating for the intrinsic material dispersion {{in order to make the}} subsequent phase shift achromatic over especially broad bands. The modulation can be induced by a thin film of a well-chosen material or a subwavelength grating whose structural parameters are thoroughly optimized.
