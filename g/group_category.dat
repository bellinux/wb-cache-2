25|$|A {{protocol}} {{suggested by}} Saunders et al. assigns research reports to six categories, {{on the basis}} of research design, theoretical background, evidence of possible harm, and general acceptance. To be classified under this protocol, there must be descriptive publications, including a manual or similar description of the intervention. This protocol does not consider the nature of any comparison group, the effect of confounding variables, the nature of the statistical analysis, or a number of other criteria. Interventions are assessed as belonging to Category 1, well-supported, efficacious treatments, if there are two or more randomized controlled outcome studies comparing the target treatment to an appropriate alternative treatment and showing a significant advantage to the target treatment. Interventions are assigned to Category 2, supported and probably efficacious treatment, based on positive outcomes of nonrandomized designs with some form of control, which may involve a non-treatment <b>group.</b> <b>Category</b> 3, supported and acceptable treatment, includes interventions supported by one controlled or uncontrolled study, or by a series of single-subject studies, or by work with a different population than the one of interest. Category 4, promising and acceptable treatment, includes interventions that have no support except general acceptance and clinical anecdotal literature; however, any evidence of possible harm excludes treatments from this category. Category 5, innovative and novel treatment, includes interventions that are not thought to be harmful, but are not widely used or discussed in the literature. Category 6, concerning treatment, is the classification for treatments that have the possibility of doing harm, as well as having unknown or inappropriate theoretical foundations.|$|E

30|$|In {{this paper}} I present a new {{database}} of bilateral migrant stocks and I provide new {{evidence on the}} determinants of international migration. The new Census-based data are obtained from National Statistical Offices of 24 OECD countries, and they cover the total stock of immigrants in each destination country for 1960 – 2000, including 188 countries of origin, sometimes in <b>grouped</b> <b>categories.</b> For each census, I keep <b>grouped</b> <b>categories</b> in a raw manner, without making imputations to specific origin countries. In the empirical analysis, I give an explicit treatment to these <b>grouped</b> <b>categories.</b> Results present strong evidence of heterogeneous effects of income gains on migration prospects depending on distance. For example, a 1000 $ increase in US income per capita increases the stock of Mexican immigrants in the country by a percentage 2.6 {{times larger than the}} percentage increase in the stock of Chinese (8  vs.  3.1  %).|$|R
