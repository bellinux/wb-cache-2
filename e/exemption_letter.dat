It was named for Jacques de Molay, the last Grand Master of the Knights Templar.

However, the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services issues <b>exemption</b> <b>letters</b> to ministries that have met the criteria to operate independently of the Affordable Care Act.|$|R
50|$|To {{obtain a}} GEL, the central {{organization}} must have first applied for and received its own 501(c)(3) <b>Exemption</b> Determination <b>Letter</b> recognizing its 501(c)(3) Tax Exemption status. Once the central organization has received its determination letter and {{has at least}} one subordinate wishing to operate under its exemption, then it is time to file for the GEL.|$|R

2500|$|On July 22, 2010, President Barack Obama signed Wall Street reform legislation, the Dodd–Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act, which {{included}} a provision to exempt the SEC from FOIA requests by the public. Aguirre used FOIA requests to obtain records relating to why his SEC superiors had stymied his Pequot investigation, charges which prompted two U.S. Senate committees to investigate. The documents, released against {{the wishes of the}} SEC, led to the discovery of evidence that resulted in a large settlement. Aguirre was the first to speak out about the <b>exemptions</b> and a <b>letter</b> by Congressman Darrell Issa to Mary Schapiro, chairman of the SEC relied heavily on his article, [...] "The Dodd-Frank Act: A FOIA Exemption for SEC Misconduct?" [...] from Wall Street Lawyer. Congressional testimony by the Project on Government Oversight at a hearing on legislative proposals to address the problem referred to Aguirre's case {{as an example of the}} crucial need for public oversight of government agencies. Aguirre said the new bill would block public access to the SEC's records and hamper oversight. Other critics called the bill a [...] "backroom deal" [...] between the SEC and the U.S. Congress to cover up SEC failures.|$|R

If the central organization is recognized as a 501(c)(3), then all the subordinates are also considered 501(c)(3), {{as long as they}} follow the required guidelines set by the central organization.|$|E
