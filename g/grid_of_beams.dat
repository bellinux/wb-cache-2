A hollow core door is probably the most common example of a torsion box (stressed skin) structure. The principle is to use less material more efficiently.

Results are presented for the capacity of WCDMA networks with up to four tiers of cells around the central cell, while a new adaptive beamforming strategy is proposed and evaluated for networks with non-uniform traffic. This strategy, apart from increased throughput per beam gain compared to a network with fixed <b>grid</b> <b>of</b> <b>beams,</b> provides more efficient radio resource management. The decreased number of beams formed by this strategy in order to cover capacity demands compared to the fixed <b>grid</b> <b>of</b> <b>beams</b> network, minimizes inter-beam handovers, reduces signalling requirements and leads to more available power in downlink. The semi-static simulator has also been used for the calculation of bit error rate for different transmission techniques in networks with multiple antennas at both sides. These techniques aim at either minimizing the overall bit rate through coherent combining (diversity combining), or the maximization of the bit rate per mobile user (spatial multiplexing). A new transmission strategy is proposed based on proper antenna selection which maximizes per user bit rate, {{while at the same time}} minimizes network resources, as in each user a minimum number of codes is assigned in order to achieve the desired capacity. ...|$|E

40|$|The wide {{application}} of corrugated steel web bridges {{has led to}} a rising demand on accurate tools to analyze this type of structures. Current computational models for these analyses are mainly related to those models using 2 D (or 3 D) beam elements, solid (shell) elements. Despite the modelling simplicity, beam models can predict the overall structural behavior but failed to provide a refined response on local areas. On the other hand, the elaborated models are better at capturing the local response. However, they are faced with computation and convergence difficulties. To fill this gap, this paper investigates a new model to analyze the structural behavior of corrugated steel web bridges. In this model, the concrete slabs and corrugated steel webs are simulated by the <b>grid</b> composed <b>of</b> 3 D <b>beam</b> elements.

We have developed these techniques during five years (2003 – 2008) of extensive research on cellular relay networks within the European research project WINNER [4]. The dynamic resource assignment adapts to changing user and traffic densities and it is flexible enough to be applicable to deployment scenarios ranging from wide area deployments to local area office deployments.

The model {{has been used to}} compare RA and D computed on the simulated LAA images with those computed on the models output. Different mesh element sizes and various model parameters, simulating different physiological/pathological conditions, have been considered and analyzed. A proper mesh element size has been determined as the best trade-off between reliable results and reasonable computational cost. Both RA and D computed on simulated LAA images were underestimated with respect to those calculated on the models output. Such underestimations were larger for RA (≈ - 44 ÷ - 26 %) as compared to those for D (≈ - 16 ÷ - 2 %). Our FE model could be useful to generate standard test images and to design realistic physical phantoms of LAA images for the assessment of the accuracy of descriptors for quantifying emphysema in CT imaging.

40|$|The goal of {{the study}} {{presented}} in this paper is the accurate performance evaluation of adaptive beam-centric admission control (AC) for wideband code-division multiple access (WCDMA) multicell networks with non-uniform traffic requirements. Each NodeB employs antenna arrays (AAs), used either to form fixed <b>grids</b> <b>of</b> <b>beams</b> (FGoBs), or to steer and shape multiple <b>beams</b> towards directions <b>of</b> increased traffic, in an adaptive manner. The adaptive beam-centric AC maximizes the cell throughput in a multirate/multicell environment by grouping as many users as possible under a common beam formed by the AA, taking into account their spatial distribution and overall interference. Due to the increased complexity of the Monte Carlo (MC) simulations, a novel grid-enabled problem solving environment has been developed in order to reduce execution times considerably and make feasible full scale extensive simulations of complex operational scenarios (up to 4 tiers <b>of</b> cells, multiple <b>beams</b> per cell, non-uniform traffic distributions with different spatial characteristics). Results show that the network with the adaptive beam-centric AC can achieve significantly higher throughput per beam in multirate/multicell environments with hotspots. In particular, it is shown that the throughput per beam gain depends exponentially on the number of hotspots per cell and their angular width, and gains up to 200 / 350 / 700 % can be achieved with 1 / 2 / 3 hotspots, respectively. Moreover, it is shown that the adaptive beam-centric AC provides significant reduction in interbeam handovers, which leads to more available resources in downlink, reduced signaling requirements and easier network planning. © 2009 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC...|$|R

40|$|The most {{significant}} bottleneck in wireless communication systems is an ever-increasing disproportion between the bandwidth demand and the available spectrum. A major {{challenge in the}} field of wireless communications is to maximise the spatial reuse of resources whilst avoiding detrimental co-channel interference (CCI). To this end, frequency planning and centralised coordination approaches are widely used in wireless networks. However, the networks {{for the next generation of}} wireless communications are often envisioned to be decentralised, randomly distributed in space, hierarchical and support heterogeneous traffic and service types. Fixed frequency allocation would not cater for the heterogeneous demands and centralised resource allocation would be cumbersome and require a lot of signalling. Decentralised radio resource allocation based on locally available information is considered the key. In this context, the busy burst (BB) signalling concept is identified as a potential mechanism for decentralised interference management in future generation networks. Interference aware allocation of time-frequency slots (chunks) is accomplished by letting receivers transmit a BB in a time-multiplexed mini-slot, upon successful reception of data. Exploiting channel reciprocity of the time division duplex (TDD) mode, the transmitters avoid reusing the chunks where the received BB power is above a pre-determined threshold so as to limit the CCI caused towards the reserved chunks to a threshold value. In this thesis, the performance of BB signalling mechanism in orthogonal frequency division multiple access - time division duplexing (OFDMA-TDD) systems is evaluated by means of system level simulations in networks operating in ad hoc and cellular scenarios. Comparisons are made against the state-of-the-art centralised CCI avoidance and mitigation methods, viz. frequency planning, fractional frequency reuse, and antenna array with switched <b>grid</b> <b>of</b> <b>beams,</b> as well as decentralised methods such as the carrier sense multiple access method that attempt to avoid CCI by avoiding transmission on chunks deemed busy. The results demonstrate that with an appropriate choice of threshold parameter, BB-based techniques outperform all of the above state-of-the-art methods. Moreover, it is demonstrated that by adjusting the BB-specific threshold parameter, the system throughput can be traded off for improving throughput for links with worse channel condition, both in the ad hoc and cellular scenario. Moreover, by utilising a variable BB power that allows a receiver to signal the maximum CCI it can tolerate, it is shown that a more favourable trade-off between total system throughput and link throughput can be made. Furthermore, by performing link adaptation, it is demonstrated that the spatial reuse and the energy efficiency can be traded off by adjusting the threshold parameter. Although the BB signalling mechanism is shown to be effective in avoiding detrimental CCI, it cannot mitigate CCI by itself. On the other hand, multiple antenna techniques such as adaptive beamforming or switched beam approaches allow CCI to be mitigated but suffer from hidden node problems. The final contribution of this thesis is that by combining the BB signalling mechanism with multiple antenna techniques, it is demonstrated that the hybrid approach enhances spatial reusability of resources whilst avoiding detrimental CCI. In summary, this thesis has demonstrated that BB provides a flexible radio resource mechanism that is suitable for future generation networks.
