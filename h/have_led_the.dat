5|$|A {{number of}} Sounds players <b>have</b> <b>led</b> <b>the</b> league in {{multiple}} statistical categories during a single season. Balboni led the 1980 season in five categories: runs (101), {{runs batted in}} (122), total bases (288), home runs (30), and fielding percentage among first basemen (.990). In 1990, Hammond {{led the league in}} wins (15), winning percentage (.938 (15–1)), earned run average (2.17), and strikeouts (149). Durham, Ruffcorn, and Wever have also led a single season in three areas.|$|E

5|$|At {{the western}} end of Highway3, two major traffic {{concerns}} have been the focus of controversy since the mid-1990s and early 2000s: the Essex Bypass and the approach to the Ambassador Bridge. Numerous attempts by local and provincial politicians since then <b>have</b> <b>led</b> <b>the</b> MTO to begin remedying the situation by upgrading the bypass to a divided four lane road and constructing the Windsor–Essex Parkway to a new international crossing.|$|E
5|$|Dragon Age: Origins {{received}} {{critical acclaim}} from major video game critics upon its release. While {{the game is}} considered to be virtually identical across all platforms, differences in user interface, graphical performance, and online content delivery <b>have</b> <b>led</b> <b>the</b> PC version to be reviewed more favorably than the PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360 versions; Metacritic ranks the PC, PlayStation 3, and Xbox 360 versions of the game with scores of 91, 87, and 86, respectively.|$|E

Frank Broyles won the Razorbacks' lone national championship in 1964.|$|E
5|$|Armour {{became the}} first manager who held the title of manager for the Indians {{for more than one}} season. Boudreau has managed more games (1383) than any other Indians manager, closely {{followed}} by Hargrove (1364). Charlie Manuel, Eric Wedge, Speaker, Boudreau, Lopez, and Hargrove are the only managers to <b>have</b> <b>led</b> <b>the</b> Indians into the playoffs. Speaker, Boudreau, Lopez, Walter Johnson, Joe Gordon, Nap Lajoie and Frank Robinson are the seven members of the Baseball Hall of Fame who are also former managers of this club. Of those seven, Lopez is the only one inducted as a manager.|$|E
5|$|Chacoan flora typifies that of North American high deserts: {{sagebrush}} {{and several}} species of cactus are interspersed with dry scrub forests of piñon and juniper, the latter primarily on the mesa tops. The canyon is far drier than other parts of New Mexico located at similar latitudes and elevations, and it lacks the temperate coniferous forests plentiful to the east. The prevailing sparseness of plants and wildlife was echoed in ancient times, when overpopulation, expanding cultivation, overhunting, habitat destruction, and drought may <b>have</b> <b>led</b> <b>the</b> Chacoans to strip the canyon of wild plants and game. It {{has been suggested that}} even during wet periods the canyon was able to sustain only 2,000 people.|$|E

5|$|Finucane had {{completed}} 108 fighter operations over France {{by the fourth}} week of June 1942. On 27 June, Leigh-Mallory, {{with the approval of}} Sholto Douglas, promoted Finucane to wing commander. Finucane became the youngest wing commander in the RAF, and was to lead the Hornchurch Wing. Duncan Smith later said, that though he admired Finucane, he resented the young fighter pilot's appointment and felt as an older, experienced leader, he could <b>have</b> <b>led</b> <b>the</b> wing himself. Duncan Smith also felt the press gave the young pilot too much attention. Nevertheless, the two maintained a cordial relationship. In his short time as wing commander of Hornchurch, Finucane made a few alterations to the formation. The most notable was to tighten flying discipline, loosen formation flying and increase low-level navigation skills.|$|E
5|$|However, with Moltke crippled, Admiral Scheer {{decided to}} return to base. Though {{scouting}} units of the Grand Fleet made brief contact with the Germans on the morning of 25 April, no action followed, and the High Seas Fleet made it home without incident. At one point in the chase, however, a reversal of course by the Germans meant that the entire Grand Fleet was forced to reorient itself in the opposite direction, placing Battleship Division Nine in the van. The result was that, if an encounter between the two fleets had occurred, American battleships would <b>have</b> <b>led</b> <b>the</b> British fleet into what could have been the largest naval battle of the war.|$|E
5|$|In 1964, VAT {{had started}} to seek a {{stronger}} partner when it negotiated with AB Scania-Vabis. The companies planned to use Scania engines in Vanaja vehicles but the plan proved too expensive for VAT. This may <b>have</b> <b>led</b> <b>the</b> major owners of VAT to start discussions about merging VAT and SAT. The chairman of VAT held regular meetings with the SAT manager Tor Nessling. In 1967, AB Scania-Vabis expressed its interest in VAT and German company Klöckner-Humboldt-Deutz AG was interested in co-operation with, or acquisition of, VAT. Valmet is also rumoured to {{have been interested in}} VAT but {{there is no evidence of}} concrete negotiations.|$|E

5|$|Iowa State {{has played}} in 1,140 games during its 120 seasons. In those seasons, four coaches <b>have</b> <b>led</b> <b>the</b> Cyclones to postseason bowl games: Johnny Majors, Earle Bruce, Dan McCarney, and Paul Rhoads. One coach, Clyde Williams, has won a conference {{championship}} with the Cyclones. McCarney is the all-time leader in games coached (141), years coached (11) and wins (56), while Bert German is the all-time leader in winning percentage (.833). W. P. Finney is, in terms of winning percentage, the worst coach {{in the history of}} the Iowa State football program having never won a game.|$|E
5|$|Michael's domain in Epirus {{became a}} refuge and centre of {{resistance}} of the Greeks against the Latin Crusaders. At about the same time, according to some modern scholars, he may <b>have</b> <b>led</b> <b>the</b> abortive Greek resistance to the Crusaders in the Peloponnese, which was crushed at the Battle of the Olive Grove of Kountouras; according to other views, he may have led a campaign there between 1207 and 1209. In order to avoid invasion and buy time to consolidate his position in Epirus, Michael soon entered into negotiations with Pope Innocent III, and concluded treaties with the Latin Empire and the Republic of Venice. In the meantime, his rule received a boost in legitimacy when he ransomed the deposed Alexios III from captivity. According to later chroniclers, Alexios III conferred the hereditary rule of Epirus to Michael and his descendants.|$|E
5|$|Mickey Vernon {{became the}} first manager of the Texas Rangers in 1961, serving for just over two seasons. Ron Washington has managed more games and seasons than any other manager in Rangers history. Before 2010, the only Rangers manager to <b>have</b> <b>led</b> <b>the</b> team to the playoffs was Johnny Oates, who also won the 1996 Manager of the Year Award with the Rangers. Ted Williams is the only Rangers manager to have been {{inducted}} into the Baseball Hall of Fame; Whitey Herzog, who {{was elected to the}} Hall in 2009 and will be inducted in July 2010, will become the only Rangers manager to earn induction as a manager (Williams was inducted for his playing career).|$|E

5|$|Relatively common, the Portuguese dogfish is {{an active}} hunter capable of {{tackling}} fast, large prey. It feeds mainly on cephalopods and fishes, though it also consumes invertebrates and cetacean carrion. This shark has acute vision optimized for detecting the bioluminescence of its prey, as sunlight does not reach the depths at which it lives. The Portuguese dogfish is aplacental viviparous, with the young provisioned by yolk and perhaps uterine fluid. The females give birth to up to 29 young after a gestation period of over one year. Valued for its liver oil {{and to a lesser}} extent meat, Portuguese dogfish are important to deepwater commercial fisheries operating off Portugal, the British Isles, Japan, and Australia. These fishing pressures and the low reproductive rate of this species <b>have</b> <b>led</b> <b>the</b> International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) to assess it as Near Threatened.|$|E
5|$|The estuary stingray's diminished {{population}} and susceptibility to multiple threats <b>have</b> <b>led</b> <b>the</b> International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) to assess it as Vulnerable. Demographic modelling {{has shown that}} {{it is likely to}} become Endangered without intervention. Several Marine Protected Areas (MPAs) are located within its range, but at present they lack adequate protection from fishing. As this ray remains locally abundant in Hervey Bay and parts of Moreton Bay, these areas may become important centers for preserving the species. The Queensland government has listed the estuary stingray on the Back on Track species prioritisation framework, to facilitate the development of conservation measures.|$|E
5|$|The {{team has}} played more than 1,150 games over 119 seasons.

Seven coaches won conference championships: Walter H. Watkins and Mike Donahue won a {{combined}} three {{as a member}} of the Southern Intercollegiate Athletic Association; Chet A. Wynne won one {{as a member of}} the Southern Conference; and Jordan, Dye, Tuberville and Chizik won a combined seven {{as a member of the}} SEC.
