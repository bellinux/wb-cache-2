5|$|Starting {{out in a}} {{black and}} white frame (and later {{incorporating}} scenes of color), a group of girls are seen standing outside on the street while Bieber is seen exiting a building while trying to walk away without getting noticed. This however, is unsuccessful as the girls run up to Bieber; he then takes pictures and signs autographs with the girls. While this is happening Bieber takes an interest with one particular girl asking her to meet him later on, to which she agrees. As the song starts playing Bieber is seen sitting in an empty auditorium playing the piano and singing. When Bieber's <b>date</b> <b>shows</b> up they sneak into an empty theater where they are seen; holding hands, horsing around on the theater's seats, and sliding down banisters. At the ending of the video they are seen engaging in a playful back-alley water fight and eventually collapse into each other's arms while Bieber is playing the piano back inside the theater.|$|E
25|$|The {{church is}} {{surrounded}} by a wall of modern origin, one of several replacements. In 1838, this wall is reported by Bishop Meade as “mouldering away” while the obviously old sections of the wall may be “very old”. The present gates may have been present in 1920 as a painting of that <b>date</b> <b>shows</b> similar gates in place. Colonial churches only sporadically had graveyards such as this one enclosed by walls as most parishioners tended to inter their dead on their own plantations or farms.|$|E
25|$|Unlike the larval stage, the pupal stage seems {{much less}} variable. For most, it lasted 14–16 days and {{temperature}} {{seemed to be}} the determining factor in shortening or lengthening the stage. Sex did not affect the length of the stage. When compared to other wasps, the M. drewseni pupal stage is very stable and less prone to variation. Graphic representations of the duration of pupal stage vs. <b>date</b> <b>shows</b> that the duration seems to ebb and flow, being very long in the end of October and dipping significantly in the month of December.|$|E

40|$|Problem: The <b>dating</b> reality <b>show</b> If You Are the One, won {{the largest}} {{audience}} rating in China after 2 weeks of its debut.   The sudden popularity {{led to more}} and more TV stations rushing to produce <b>dating</b> reality <b>shows,</b> and the majority gets even higher ratings from critics, from media, the Chinese government and common Chinese citizens. Method: Quantitative analysis of a multi-question online survey by logistic regression to determine whether certain variables, identified through academic research, correlate with satisfaction and use by audiences. Result: There are three types of audience. One is eager to get married and aims at finding true love through <b>dating</b> <b>shows</b> or getting some guidance for finding their perfect match. The second is already married and consider their relationship with their spouse to be a major life issue.  They will hope to receive beneficial advice from watching <b>dating</b> <b>shows.</b> The third type simply watches for entertainment, to relax after a day of harsh work and study.   All the audiences watch <b>dating</b> <b>shows,</b> more or less trust on the authenticity of TV and <b>dating</b> <b>shows...</b>|$|R
50|$|Since then, the <b>dating</b> game <b>show</b> has {{virtually}} died off from television syndication, though {{cable television networks}} such as VH1 have continued to air <b>dating</b> <b>shows</b> with content {{similar to that of}} the syndicated <b>dating</b> <b>shows</b> of the late 1990s and early 2000s and major over-the-air broadcast networks have tried, often with marginal success, to use <b>dating</b> <b>shows</b> that are less risque compared to those shows. Attempts to revive the <b>dating</b> <b>show</b> in syndication first came in 2011, when Excused and Who Wants to Date a Comedian? both debuted; this was followed in 2012 by NBCUniversal Television Distribution's sale of reruns of the Game Show Network series Baggage into syndication. All three shows were dropped in September 2013, removing the genre from broadcast syndication for a time. In July 2014, VH1 aired Dating Naked, modeled on Dutch show Adam Zkt. Eva, which matches up heterosexual contestants who are nude most of the time.|$|R
2500|$|The {{ruins of}} the Palace of Ardashir and Ghal'eh Dokhtar in Fars Province, Iran, built by Ardashir I (224240) of the Sasanian Empire, have the {{earliest}} known examples of squinches. The three domes of the Palace of Ardashir are 45 feet in diameter and vertically elliptical, each with a central opening or oculus to admit light. They were built with local stone and mortar and covered with plaster on the interior. At {{the center of the}} palace of Shahpur, at Bishapur, there is a vertically-elliptical dome that rests directly on the ground and is dated to 260. The large brick dome of the Sarvestan Palace, also in Fars but later in <b>date,</b> <b>shows</b> more elaborate decoration and four windows between the corner squinches. Also called [...] "the Temple of Anahita", the building may have been a Fire temple. Instead of using a central oculus in each dome, as at the Palace of Ardashir and as shown in the bas relief found at Kuyunjik, lighting was provided by a number of hollow terracotta cylinders set into the domes at regular intervals.|$|E
2500|$|Note: From 1868 to 1982, {{a unique}} dating system for Spanish coins was employed. This would be adopted and {{sometimes}} abandoned intermittently during various times, and continued through {{to be used}} through {{the first years of}} the Juan Carlos I reign. Although a common [...] "authorization date" [...] will be found on virtually all coins of this period on the obverse (front) of each coin, the actual date for many coins can be found inside a small six pointed star, typically on the reverse (back) of each coin, but sometimes the front. Therefore, the obverse date does not always reflect the actual date of mintage but rather a restriking off of older obverse coin die designs. So, if the coin <b>date</b> <b>shows</b> 1959 up front but a tiny [...] "64" [...] is depicted in the six pointed star on the back, then the actual date of issue is in fact 1964 rather than the date depicted in front. This dating system would be abandoned in the early 1980s anticipating a one by one redesign of each coin denomination.|$|E
