25|$|Spiral binding is {{the most}} {{economical}} form of mechanical binding when using plastic or metal. It is commonly used for atlases and other publications where it is necessary or desirable {{to be able to}} open the publication back on itself without breaking the spine. There are several types but basically it is made by punching holes along {{the entire length of the}} spine of the page and winding a wire helix (like a spring) through the holes to provide a fully flexible hinge at the spine. Spiral coil binding uses a number of different hole patterns for binding documents. The most common <b>hole</b> <b>pattern</b> used with this style is 4:1 pitch (4 holes per inch). However, spiral coil spines are also available for use with 3:1 pitch, 5:1 pitch and 0.400-hole patterns.|$|E

2500|$|Double wire, twin loop, or Wire-O binding {{is a type}} of binding that is {{used for}} books that will be viewed or read in an office or home type environment. The binding {{involves}} the use of a [...] "C" [...] shaped wire spine that is squeezed into a round shape using a wire closing device. Double wire binding allows books to have smooth crossover and is affordable in many colors. This binding is great for annual reports, owners manuals and software manuals. Wire bound books are made of individual sheets, each punched with a line of round or square holes on the binding edge. This type of binding uses either a 3:1 pitch <b>hole</b> <b>pattern</b> with three holes per inch or a 2:1 pitch <b>hole</b> <b>pattern</b> with two holes per inch. The three to one <b>hole</b> <b>pattern</b> is used for smaller books that are up to 9/16" [...] in diameter while the 2:1 pattern is normally used for thicker books as the holes are slightly bigger to accommodate slightly thicker, stronger wire. Once punched, the back cover is then placed on to the front cover ready for the wire binding elements (double loop wire) to be inserted. The wire is then placed through the holes. The next step involves the binder holding the book by its pages and inserting the wire into a [...] "closer" [...] which is basically a vise that crimps the wire closed and into its round shape. The back page can then be turned back to its correct position, thus hiding the spine of the book.|$|E

40|$|There {{are strong}} demands for {{techniques}} which {{are able to}} extend application of ArF immersion lithography. Especially, the leading edge techniques are required to make very small <b>hole</b> <b>patterns</b> below 50 nm. Several techniques such as double patterning technique, free-form illumination and resist shrinkage technology are considered as viable candidates. Most of all, NTD (Negative Tone Development) is being regarded as the most promising technology for the realization of small <b>hole</b> <b>patterns</b> When NTD process is applied, <b>hole</b> <b>patterns</b> are defined by island type features on the reticle and consequently its optical performance shows better result compared with PTD (Positive Tone Development) process. However it is still difficult to define extremely small <b>hole</b> <b>patterns</b> below 40 nm, new combination process of NTD with RELACS is being introduced to overcome resolution limitation. NTD combined with RELACS, {{which is the most}} advanced lithography technology, definitely enable us to generate smaller size <b>hole</b> <b>patterns</b> on the wafer. A chemical shrinkage technology, RELACS (Resolution Enhancement Lithography Assisted by Chemical Shrink), utilizes the cross linking reaction catalyzed by the acid component existing in a predefined resist pattern. In case of PTD combined with RELACS process, we already know that CD change after the shrinkage process is not influenced by duty ratio. So we could easily reflect the RELACS bias to meet the CD target during OPC (Optica...|$|R
2500|$|Comb binding uses a 9/16" [...] pitch {{rectangular}} <b>hole</b> <b>pattern</b> punched {{near the}} bound edge. A curled plastic [...] "comb" [...] is fed through the slits {{to hold the}} sheets together. Comb binding allows a book to be disassembled and reassembled by hand without damage. Comb supplies are typically available {{in a wide range}} of colors and diameters. The supplies themselves can be re-used or recycled. In the United States, comb binding is often referred to as 19-ring binding because it uses a total of 19 holes along the 11-inch side of a sheet of paper.|$|E
50|$|Coil with 2.5:1 pitch, {{also known}} 0.400 pitch coil, {{and is used}} with a <b>hole</b> <b>pattern</b> that has 2.5 holes per inch. However, many users choose to use this <b>hole</b> <b>pattern</b> with the <b>hole</b> <b>pattern</b> that is {{produced}} for 2:1 pitch wire binding. This type of spiral coil uses a larger filament diameter and is specifically designed for binding thick documents. Spirals in this pitch pattern are available in diameters ranging from 20 mm up to 76 mm. This means that 2.5:1 pitch coil {{can be used to}} bind documents that are thicker {{than any of the other}} pitches of spiral coil.|$|E

50|$|The {{most common}} <b>hole</b> <b>pattern</b> used with coil binding is a 4:1 pitch <b>hole</b> <b>pattern</b> (6 mm outside the US), which has four holes per inch along the binding {{edge of the}} sheets of paper. The holes for this style are usually either round or oval shaped and {{depending}} on the size and spacing of the <b>hole</b> <b>pattern,</b> there will be 43 or 44 holes on an eleven-inch binding edge. Supplies for binding documents with 4:1 pitch spiral coil are available in sizes ranging from 6 mm up to 50 mm in diameter. This allows for binding documents that are up to two inches thick.|$|E

40|$|Invited paperIn {{recent years}} major advancements {{have been made}} in the {{directed}} self-assembly (DSA) of block copolymers (BCP). Insertion of DSA for IC fabrication is seriously considered for the 7 nm node. At this node the DSA technology could alleviate costs for double patterning and limit the number of masks that would be required per layer. At imec multiple approaches for inserting DSA into the 7 nm node are considered. One of the most straightforward approaches for implementation would be for via patterning through templated DSA (grapho-epitaxy), since <b>hole</b> <b>patterns</b> are readily accessible through templated <b>hole</b> <b>patterning</b> of cylindrical phase BCP materials. Here, the pre-pattern template is first patterned into a spin-on hardmask stack. After optimizing the surface properties of the template the desired <b>hole</b> <b>patterns</b> can be obtained by the BCP DSA process. For implementation of this approach to be implemented for 7 nm node via patterning, not only the appropriate process flow needs to be available, but also appropriate metrology (including for pattern placement accuracy) and DSA-aware mask decomposition are required. In this paper the imec approach for 7 nm node via patterning will be discussed. status: publishe...|$|R

40|$|In {{gas turbine}} development, the {{direction}} has been higher turbine inlet temperatures {{to increase the}} work output and thermal efficiency. This extreme environment can significantly impact component life. One means of preventing component burnout in the turbine is to effectively use film-cooling whereby coolant is extracted from the compressor and injected through component surfaces. One such surface is the endwall of the first stage nozzle guide vane. This paper presents results from a computational study of two endwall film-cooling <b>hole</b> <b>patterns</b> combined with cooling from a flush slot that simulates leakage between the combustor and turbine sections. Results indicate reasonable agreement between predictions and measurements of the turbine endwall cooling for a flush slot alone.
