Four study areas with different sensors and scene characteristics were investigated. First, the Digital Surface Model (DSM) was generated {{for the first and}} last pulses and then the differences between the first and last pulses (FP-LP) were computed. A total of 25 uncorrelated feature attributes have been generated from the aerial images, the lidar intensity image, DSM and FP-LP. The <b>generated</b> <b>attributes</b> were applied in seven separate groups which include those from: Red, Green and Blue bands of the aerial image; Intensity/IR image; DSM; FP-LP and the Total group of attributes. Finally, SVMs were used to automatically classify buildings, trees, roads and ground from aerial images, lidar data and the <b>generated</b> <b>attributes,</b> with the most accurate average classifications of 95 % being achieved. The Gaussian Radius Basis Function (RBF) kernel model was applied to find the separating hyperplane for the SVMs classification.

40|$|Abstract. The {{classification}} of biological sequences {{is one of}} the significant challenges in bioinformatics as well for protein as for nucleic sequences. The presence of these data in huge masses, their ambiguity and especially the high costs of the in vitro analysis in terms of time and money, make the use of data mining rather a necessity than a rational choice. However, the data mining techniques, which often process data under the relational format, are confronted with the inappropriate format of the biological sequences. Hence, an inevitable step of pre-processing must be established. This work presents the biological sequences encoding as a preparation step before their classification. We present three existing encoding methods based on the motifs extraction. We also pro-pose to improve one of these methods and we carry out a comparative study which takes into account, of course, the effect of each method on the classifica-tion accuracy but also the number of <b>generated</b> <b>attributes</b> and the CPU time. ...|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT: To {{facilitate}} {{the process of}} discovering brain structure-function associations from image and clinical data, we have developed classification tools for brain image data {{that are based on}} measures of dissimilarity between probability distributions. We propose statistical as well as non-statistical methods for classifying three dimensional probability distributions of regions of interest (ROIs) in brain images. The statistical methods are based on computing the Mahalanobis distance and Kullback-Leibler distance between a new subject and historic data sets related to each considered class. The new subject is predicted to belong to the class corresponding to the dataset that has the smaller distance from the given subject. The non-statistical methods consist of a sequence of partitioning the brain image into hyper-rectangles followed by applying supervised neural network models. Experiments performed on synthetic data representing mixtures of nine distributions as well as on realistic brain lesion distributions from a study of attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) after closed head injury showed that all proposed methods are capable of providing accurate classification of the subjects with the Kullback-Leibler distance being the least sensitive {{on the size of the}} training set and on information about the new subject.

40|$|Causal {{reasoning}} {{has been}} proposed as critical for deriving impressions from conflicting social-category information, but research to date has relied primarily on participant introspection. To provide a more objective test, we adapted methods from studies of the causal status hypothesis, which asserts that features that 'cause' or 'explain' {{the presence of other}} features are more central to mental representation. We hypothesized that 'emergent' attributes (that are part of neither constituent stereotype but are part of the combination, and that tend to characterise incongruent rather than congruent social-category combinations) would possess this 'causal status' – particularly in the case of incongruent-category combinations, because of the presumably greater need for causal reasoning to reconcile incongruent versus congruent categories. Participants <b>generated</b> <b>attributes</b> for targets that belonged to multiple social categories, where the stereotypes associated with these categories were congruent, incongruent, or unrelated to one another (in terms of gender and occupational stereotypes); participants then rated the typicality and goodness-of-fit of target individuals whose descriptions highlighted gender-constituent attributes, role-constituent attributes, or emergent attributes. The results indicated that emergent attributes were more central to participants' representations of the social-category combinations – particularly for incongruent-category combinations – suggesting that causal reasoning is implicated in social-category combination and emergent-attribute generation...|$|E

In this paper the idea is to combine classifiers with different error types based on Fuzzy Majority Voting (FMV). Four study areas with different sensors and scene characteristics were used to assess the performance of the model. First, the lidar point clouds were filtered to generate a Digital Terrain Model (DTM), and then a Digital Surface Model (DSM) and the Normalized Digital Surface Model (nDSM) were generated. A total of 25 uncorrelated feature attributes have been generated from the aerial images, the lidar intensity image, DSM and nDSM. Three different classification algorithms were used to classify buildings, trees, roads and ground from aerial images, lidar data and the <b>generated</b> <b>attributes.</b> The used classifiers include: Self-Organizing Map (SOM); Classification Trees (CTs); and Support Vector Machines (SVMs) with average classification accuracies of 96. 8 %, 95. 9 % and 93. 7 % obtained for SVMs, SOM, and CTs respectively. FMV, which is a powerful tool for combining classifiers, was then applied for combining the class memberships from the three classifiers.

The outcomes demonstrate that use of FMV based combination is essential to achieve the significant improvement in the classification accuracies.

40|$|Background: This paper {{deals with}} the {{preprocessing}} of protein sequences for supervised classification. Motif extraction {{is one way to}} address that task. It has been largely used to encode biological sequences into feature vectors to enable using well-known machine-learning classifiers which require this format. However, designing a suitable feature space, for a set of proteins, is not a trivial task. For this purpose, we propose a novel encoding method that uses amino-acid substitution matrices to define similarity between motifs during the extraction step. Results In order to demonstrate the efficiency of such approach, we compare several encoding methods using some machine learning classifiers. The experimental results showed that our encoding method outperforms other ones in terms of classification accuracy and number of <b>generated</b> <b>attributes.</b> We also compared the classifiers in term of accuracy. Results: indicated that SVM generally outperforms the other classifiers with any encoding method. We showed that SVM, coupled with our encoding method, can be an efficient protein classification system. In addition, we studied the effect of the substitution matrices variation on the quality of our method and hence on the classification quality. We noticed that our method enables good classification accuracies with all the substitution matrices and that the variances of the obtained accuracies using various substitution matrices are slight. However, the number of generated features varies from a substitution matrix to another. Furthermore, the use of already published datasets allowed us to carry out a comparison with several related works. The outcomes of this comparison confirm the efficiency of our encoding method to represent protein sequences in classification tasks...|$|E
40|$|This thesis {{explored}} {{the need for}} greater integration between individual difference and group-based explanations of prejudice. It began by addressing the claim of many self categorisation theorists that any attempt at integration is doomed, because individual differences play little role in predicting intergroup behaviour when a person 2 ̆ 7 s social identity is salient (Turner, 1982). Contrary to this prediction, both Study One and Two showed that even when participant 2 ̆ 7 s social identities were salient, individual difference variables correlated with prejudice. Study Two went on to illustrate the dynamic nature of individual differences. It demonstrated {{that the relationship between}} ingroup belonging, intergroup prejudice, and the sub-scales of the Personal Need for Structure measure differed depending on the situational context. Finally, contrary to self categorisation theory, it was found that Australian identity was unrelated to prejudice. This led to the second question {{at the heart of the}} thesis, do all individuals identify with their group in the same way; are the images, stereotypes, and norms of a national group held universally, or even widely? In Study Three, participants <b>generated</b> <b>attributes</b> they believed typical of the average Australian. These responses were content analysed by independent raters, producing a final list of 27 attributes. An examination of this list revealed a broad range of, often, contradictory auto-stereotypes. These attributes were then presented to a separate sample of participants in Study Four. A factor analysis produced three distinct, if inter-related, stereotype components: 2 ̆ 7 positive in group regard 2 ̆ 7, 2 ̆ 7 traditional Australian 2 ̆ 7, and open-minded/independent. These auto-stereotype components were, in tum, differentially related to participants 2 ̆ 7 value orientation, as measured by Braithwaite and Law 2 ̆ 7 s (1985) social values inventory. Thus, compared to moral relativists, dualists were significantly more likely to depict Australians using attributes from each of the stereotype components, with the security orientated scoring significantly higher than moral relativists on both the 2 ̆ 7 positive ingroup regard 2 ̆ 7 and 2 ̆ 7 traditional Australian 2 ̆ 7 components. Study Five examined the relationship between Social Comparison Orientation (SCO) and perception of group belonging. Reflecting a pattern similar to that of Study Two, the correlation between SCO and perceptions of both the ingroup and outgroup differed depending on situational context. The combined results of these studies point to the need to re-examine the importance of individual differences when considering the relationship between social identity and prejudice...|$|E
