5000|$|The Chula Vista Residential Burglary-Reduction Project {{yielded the}} {{following}} findings: [...] "From victim interviews, {{we learned that}} in 87% of the break-ins that occurred when intruders defeated locked doors with tools such as screwdrivers or crowbars, the burglars targeted [...] "the one door that had no <b>deadbolt</b> <b>lock</b> ... not one burglar attempted to break a double-pane window {{during the course of}} successful or attempted burglary." ...|$|E
50|$|Police arrived {{within three}} minutes of {{receiving}} an emergency call but took {{about five minutes}} to enter the barricaded building. When they could not break the chains, an officer shot out a <b>deadbolt</b> <b>lock</b> leading into a laboratory; they then moved to a nearby stairwell. As police reached the second floor, they heard Cho fire his final shot; Cho's body was discovered in Jocelyne Couture-Nowak's classroom, room 211.|$|E
5000|$|A magnetic-coded lock is a lock {{device that}} uses pins in {{combination}} with magnets to prevent entry by either non-matching keys by teething or magnetic polarity. Magnetic-coded locks encompass knob locks, cylinder locks, lever <b>locks,</b> and <b>deadbolt</b> <b>locks</b> as well as applications in other security devices.|$|R
50|$|PEMCO’s stated {{niche market}} is in what {{some in the}} {{insurance}} industry refer to as “preferred risk”- that is, policyholders who are least likely to have traffic tickets or car accidents, and who take proactive steps {{to protect their own}} property with safeguards like car alarms, smoke detectors, and <b>deadbolt</b> <b>locks.</b>|$|R
50|$|Sintered {{metal powder}} {{is used to}} make {{frangible}} shotgun shells called breaching rounds, as used by military and SWAT teams to quickly force entry into a locked room. These shotgun shells are designed to destroy door <b>deadbolts,</b> <b>locks</b> and hinges without risking lives by ricocheting or by flying on at lethal speed through the door. They work by destroying the object they hit and then dispersing into a relatively harmless powder.|$|R
50|$|UniKey {{was founded}} in 2010 in Florida by Phil Dumas, who serves as {{president}} and chief executive officer. He has an electrical engineering degree from the University of Central Florida and a background in biometric security. Dumas was part of the team that launched SmartScan, the first mass-market biometric residential <b>deadbolt</b> <b>lock.</b> He started UniKey in an effort to create a more dependable and convenient way to access everything.|$|E
5000|$|Following DeLong's July 2000 {{retirement}} from the FBI, she {{published a book}} entitled Special Agent: My Life on the Front Lines as a Woman in the FBI. In the book, she discusses the criminal profiling process and how she helped solve high-profile cases. DeLong also dedicated a chapter in her book to personal safety, stating that [...] "Prevention {{can be as simple}} as a <b>deadbolt</b> <b>lock</b> on your house." ...|$|E
50|$|Apigy {{originally}} {{offered a}} full replacement door lock version of Lockitron in 2011 before announcing {{a version of}} Lockitron in 2012 which fit over preexisting deadbolt locks. The 2012 version of Lockitron incorporated a number of improvements over the 2011 Lockitron deadbolt including built-in WiFi, replacing a wired basestation, built-in auto-unlock technology through Bluetooth Low Energy, and a simplified installation by making Lockitron a device that fits over a preexisting <b>deadbolt</b> <b>lock.</b> The crowdfunded Lockitron was built around an ATMega microprocessor meaning that it is Arduino compatible for other custom behavior.|$|E
50|$|They {{produce a}} range of {{residential}} lock products, including tubular locks, key locking hardware sets, electronic keyless <b>locks,</b> <b>deadbolts,</b> and Mortise <b>locks.</b> They also provide cabinet and drawer pulls for interior spaces like Kitchen cabinets and bathroom cabinets.|$|R
5000|$|The {{availability}} of accessories has increased, including such features as wireless keypads, key chain remotes, and solenoid-operated <b>deadbolts</b> to <b>lock</b> the door itself.|$|R
50|$|UniKey Technologies is an {{alternative}} access control company based in the United States that designs and licenses keyless entry technology worldwide. Its first product in partnership with Kwikset is Kēvo, a Bluetooth-enabled <b>deadbolt</b> door <b>lock.</b>|$|R
50|$|Segal {{was started}} by Samuel Segal, {{formerly}} a New York City detective in 1912, through his invention of a nearly burglar-proof lock. The vertical <b>deadbolt</b> <b>lock</b> eliminated a horizontal bolt, concentrating on the hinge principle. Segal had noticed that burglars forced locks but never hinges. The firm's beginning was aided by a few more policeman. The original capital was approximately $1,000. Segal and his associates refused $1,000,000 in cash for their fifty separate lock patents.Shortly before her death Mrs. May Stevenson Segal, wife of Samuel Segal, invented a burglar-proof lock, which was marketed to a leading lock manufacturer.|$|E
50|$|The Biometric Deadbolt - The contestants must {{install a}} <b>deadbolt</b> <b>lock</b> with a {{biometric}} sensor to {{the doors of}} their rooms. For Matt, who lives in rural Nova Scotia, he would prefer having a traditional key, and he found the installation particularly frustrating, though he does pass. Cory ardently reads the instructions, and despite some trouble programming the door, he passes. Deen fails as he installs the door backwards (with the lock side in), while Angela fails due to realizing that her chosen location is opposite a weak part of the doorjamb, and must drill a hole at another location. Simon fails after some frustration with the installation.|$|E
50|$|Launched in 2013, Kēvo is {{the first}} Bluetooth-enabled touch-to-open smart lock. Kēvo {{has the ability to}} detect a user's {{compatible}} smartphone or tablet via an app, to lock and unlock the door. The <b>deadbolt</b> <b>lock</b> senses when the user's phone is nearby and when it's outside; the phone emits a low-energy Bluetooth signal, allowing the door to be unlocked when the lock face is touched, making it unnecessary to interact with the phone in order to open the door. Users can grant unrestricted or temporary access to other phones as well. Kēvo also comes with a keychain fob that provides the same touch-to-open function as an authorized smart phone. In July, 2014 Kevo added Unlimited Guest eKeys and Scheduled eKeys, which lets you set a day and time constraints for eKeys from your phone. A prime security feature of the product is UniKey's Inside/Outside Intelligence, which detects whether a verified device is currently inside or outside the home. If an authorized device is known to be inside the house, unauthorized users are unable to activate Kēvo from outside. The system acts as a one-way filter that lets only authorized users pass through the entryway.|$|E
5000|$|On October 12, {{the plaintiffs}} filed an amended lawsuit adding the university's Board of Regents (George Pearsons, Kenneth Copeland, Creflo Dollar, Michael A. Hammer, John Hagee, Marilyn Hickey, Oral Roberts, Richard L. Roberts, Jerry Savelle andCharles Watson)to the suit and alleging {{three days after}} the {{original}} lawsuit was filed, Roberts fired the university's financial comptroller (who had been employed by ORU for 26 years) and [...] "witnesses have reported voluminous materials and documents were shredded and destroyed, constituting spoilation of evidence." [...] The filing also alleged Lindsay Roberts had spent at least nine nights in the ORU guest house with an underage 16-year-old male who also was allowed to live in the Roberts family residence on campus, a situation that made their oldest daughter so uncomfortable, she insisted <b>deadbolt</b> <b>locks</b> be installed on all bedroom doors in the house.|$|R
5000|$|Breaching rounds are {{designed}} to destroy door <b>deadbolts,</b> <b>locks,</b> and hinges without risking lives by ricocheting or by flying on at lethal speed through the door, as traditional buckshot can. These frangible rounds are made of a dense sintered material, often metal powder in a binder such as wax, which can destroy a lock or hinge and then immediately disperse. They are used by military and SWAT teams to quickly force entry into a locked room. Amongst police, these rounds are nicknamed [...] "master keys", and their use is known as [...] "Avon calling". Ideally, breaching rounds {{may be used in}} a standard combat shotgun or riot shotgun, or in a specialized shotgun, often attached to a rifle, such as the KAC Masterkey or M26 Modular Accessory Shotgun System. The most effective use of this round is with a [...] "stand-off breacher" [...] attached to the muzzle of a specially converted shotgun. The stand-off is held {{on the surface of the}} door and vents gases to prevent overpressure.|$|R
40|$|Private {{expenditures}} on crime reduction have potentially important externalities. Observable {{measures such as}} barbed-wire fences and <b>deadbolt</b> <b>locks</b> may shift crime {{to those who are}} unprotected, imposing a negative externality. Unobservable precautions, on the other hand, may provide positive externalities since criminals cannot determine a priori who is protected. Focusing on one specific form of victim precaution, Lojack, we provide the first thorough empirical analysis of the magnitude of such externalities. Because installing Lojack does not reduce the likelihood that an individual car will be stolen, any decrease in the aggregate crime rates due to Lojack is an externality {{from the perspective of the}} individual Lojack purchaser. We find that the presence of Lojack is associated with a sharp fall in auto theft in central cities and a more modest decline in the remainder of the state. Rates of other crimes do not change appreciably. Our estimates suggest that, at least historically, the marginal social benefit of an additional unit of Lojack has been as much as 15 times greater than the marginal social cost in high crime areas. Those who install Lojack in their cars, however, obtain less than ten percent of the total social benefits of Lojack, causing Lojack to be undersupplied by the free market. Current insurance subsidies for the installation of Lojack appear to be well below the socially optimal level. ...|$|R
50|$|A dead bolt, <b>deadbolt</b> or dead <b>lock</b> is a locking {{mechanism}} distinct from a spring bolt <b>lock</b> because a <b>deadbolt</b> cannot {{be moved to}} the open position except by rotating the lock cylinder with the key. The more common spring bolt lock uses a spring to hold the bolt in place, allowing retraction by applying force to the bolt itself. A deadbolt can therefore make a door more resistant to entry without the correct key.|$|R
40|$|Extensive {{publicity}} {{about the crime}} prevention workshop had been cir-culated by law enforcement officers of this suburban town for nearly two weeks. Radio "spot announcement~, " short public service notices on the tele-vision, and a·half-page ad in the local newspaper, all in turn had the same basic message: "ONLY YOU CAN PUT A STOP TO CRilfE IN YOUR COMMUNITY. " Tile officers spent many extra off-duty hours planning and organizing the workshop. It was scheduled for a week night, from 7 : 00 P. M. to 10 : 00 P. M. and included a number of crime prevention experts to talk about tips on "home security, " "rape prevention, " ''how {{to be a good}} witness, " "how to avoid mugginp,s," and "con and fraud tactics. " In addition, the nearby regional headquarters of the State Police were to set up an impressive display of <b>deadbolt</b> <b>locks,</b> burglar alarms, and other home security hardware. The state grant to set up the one night workshop was designed to "teach crime prevention to John and Jane Doe before the crime occursJ " The workshop was viewed as innovative because, according to the police chief: "the law enforcement officer comes face-to-face with the law-abiding public only after a major crime has occurred, and in an atmosphere of tension and high emotions. " The "big " night came, and the auditorium at the town's community center was filled with nearly 100 persons. Nearly 50 of the participants consisted of law enforcement officers from other nearby towns acting as "official ob-servers. " About 50 were citizens. For three hours the speakers strode to the poditDD and delivered their particular messages. Tiie participants examined the lock display with great curiosity. When it was over, and two of the officers from the town were folding and stacking chairs, one was overheard as saying: "You know, people just don't care. You would think that in a town of 15, 000 and with all the crime we have, a few more people would have shown up. " The other officer sarcastically replied: "And the ones who were here aren't going to remember 95 % of what they heard. "...|$|R
