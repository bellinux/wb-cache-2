50|$|There {{have been}} many {{professional}} analyses on Poprishchin’s unique diary entries attempting to interpret their meaning, with special interest taken to the entry: 43 April 2000. A freudian analysis performed by Professor Ermakov deducted that Poprishchin used this absurd date to avoid May 13, because the word maja suggests majat’sja, which in Russian means suffering. Richard Gustafson’s analysis of the <b>entry</b> <b>title</b> is more grounded in {{the contents of the}} story. He agrees that Poprishchin is indeed trying to avoid May 13, but his reasoning for such is that the letters from the dogs that exposed the grave reality of Sofi and the Director were presented exactly half a year earlier on November 13.|$|E

40|$|Summary: OMIM is a {{manually}} curated resource containing detailed {{descriptions of}} inherited human disease. For some entries allelic variant (mutation) data are also available. However, there are no cross-references to a sequence database such as SwissProt and the numbering may not match the numbering of a SwissProt entry. Conversely, SwissProt provides cross references to OMIM, but the variant data within the downloadable SwissProt data do not indicate which mutations are disease-related (from OMIM) and which are polymorphisms. We have created an automatically updated resource which maintains a validated mapping between OMIM and SwissProt entries which may be queried interactively or downloaded for local processing. Availability: The data may be queried {{on the basis of}} OMIM identifier, SwissProt accession or text from the OMIM <b>entry</b> <b>title</b> a...|$|E
