40|$|WO 2008095917 A 1 UPAB: 20081008 NOVELTY - The {{breathing}} mask (1) has {{an outer}} mask (2) and an inner mask (3) for covering {{the mouth and}} nose. The inner mask has an <b>inhaling</b> <b>valve</b> (4), a discharge opening, and a microphone (6) is mounted in the inner mask. The inner mask has an area arranged directly {{against the use of}} the mouth of the mask carrier, and has another area which is arranged adjacent to the former area. USE - Breathing mask. ADVANTAGE - The breathing mask has an outer mask and an inner mask for covering the mouth and nose, where a microphone is mounted in the inner mask, and hence ensures reliable communication in a difficult and loud situation in a simple manner...|$|E
40|$|Spacer {{devices in}} asthma The British {{guidelines}} on asthma manage-ment and other recent reviews have widely advocated {{the use of}} spacer devices for asth-matic patients. 1 â€“ 3 Spacer devices allow aerosol to be <b>inhaled</b> through a <b>valved</b> mouthpiece during a single inspiratory breath or as is often recommended for children during tidal breathing. 2 During the expiratory phase of a tidal breathing manoeuvre the valve closes. Although this action prevents leakage of aerosol from the spacer and ingress of moisture into the holding chamber, there is an inevitable increase in the expiratory resist-ance. We have measured the resistance t...|$|R
50|$|The one-way endobronchial valve is {{typically}} implanted such {{that when a}} patient exhales, air is able to flow through the valve {{and out of the}} lung compartment that is fed by that airway, but when the patient <b>inhales,</b> the <b>valve</b> closes and blocks air from entering that lung compartment. Thus, an implanted endobronchial valve typically helps a lung compartment to empty itself of air. This {{has been shown to be}} beneficial in the treatment of emphysema, where lungs lose their elasticity and thus cannot contract sufficiently to exhale air, leading to air trapping and hyperaeration. When one or more diseased portions of an emphysematous lung are made to deflate and collapse, other healthier portions of the lung have more room in the chest cavity to inhale and exhale, pressure is removed from the diaphragm, and even the heart may function better as the hyper-inflated lung becomes smaller. Endobronchial valves have also been shown to be beneficial in treatment of persistent air leaks in the lungs. It has also been theorized that endobronchial valves may be useful for treatment of tuberculosis and its complications. Endobronchial valves may be the first successful medical device treatment of emphysema, a disease that affects billions of patients worldwide and has no known cure, being managed traditionally by lung transplantation and/or lung volume reduction surgery (though some patients do not meet the eligibility requirements for one or both of these invasive procedures).|$|R
