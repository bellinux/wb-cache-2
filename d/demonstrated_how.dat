5|$|In February 2011 the Smithsonian Institution {{announced}} it would be holding an exhibit dedicated {{to the art of}} video games. Several games were chosen initially and the public could vote for which games they felt deserved to be displayed via a poll on the exhibit's website. BioShock was considered a front runner to be displayed because of its status as a game that <b>demonstrated</b> <b>how</b> artistic the medium can be.|$|E

The humour in this segment often comes from the juxtaposition between the celebrity {{and their ability to}} demonstrate something the viewing public might not have expected them to know how to do.

5|$|More {{in-depth}} investigations {{were conducted}} by Esther Levenson, Pessia Tsamir, and Dina Tirosh, who interviewed a pair of sixth-grade students who were performing highly in their mathematics class. One student preferred deductive explanations of mathematical claims, while the other preferred practical examples. Both students initially thought that 0 was neither even nor odd, for different reasons. Levenson et al. <b>demonstrated</b> <b>how</b> the students' reasoning reflected their concepts of zero and division.|$|E
5|$|Einstein {{returned}} {{to the problem of}} thermodynamic fluctuations, giving a treatment of the density variations in a fluid at its critical point. Ordinarily the density fluctuations are controlled by the second derivative of the free energy with respect to the density. At the critical point, this derivative is zero, leading to large fluctuations. The effect of density fluctuations is that light of all wavelengths is scattered, making the fluid look milky white. Einstein relates this to Rayleigh scattering, which is what happens when the fluctuation size is much smaller than the wavelength, and which explains why the sky is blue. Einstein quantitatively derived critical opalescence from a treatment of density fluctuations, and <b>demonstrated</b> <b>how</b> both the effect and Rayleigh scattering originate from the atomistic constitution of matter.|$|E
5|$|Soviet {{investment}} in the defense sector was not driven by military necessity, but {{in large part by}} the interests of massive party and state bureaucracies dependent on the sector for their own power and privileges. The Soviet Armed Forces became the largest in {{the world in terms of}} the numbers and types of weapons they possessed, in the number of troops in their ranks, and in the sheer size of their military–industrial base. However, the quantitative advantages held by the Soviet military often concealed areas where the Eastern Bloc dramatically lagged behind the West. For example, the Persian Gulf War <b>demonstrated</b> <b>how</b> the armor, fire control systems and firing range of the Soviet's most common main battle tank, the T-72, were drastically inferior to the American M1 Abrams, yet the USSR fielded almost three times as many T-72's as the US deployed M1's.|$|E

5|$|The {{resulting}} reforms {{helped shape}} the cavalry's contribution to the British Expeditionary Force (BEF), which was established with one cavalry division supported by two brigades of horse artillery. All would be trained for the mounted charge but would also be armed with rifles, the only major power to do so. The cavalry regiments were armed with Maxim Machine Guns, although these were replaced by Vickers Machine Guns from 1912. More than anything else, the issue of entrenching tools that were carried on the troop packhorses <b>demonstrated</b> <b>how</b> much the cavalry's doctrine had changed since the Boer Wars.|$|E
5|$|Within the {{recording}} industry, Martin {{was known for}} having become independent {{at a time when}} many producers were still salaried. However, EMI refused his pleas for royalties on his own work. By 1965, the Beatles' success had given Martin the leverage to start Associated Independent Recording (AIR), which enabled him to hire out his services to other artists. Martin also took EMI’s best producers and staff along with him to AIR. AIR <b>demonstrated</b> <b>how</b> important Martin's talents were to his artists, and it allowed him a share in record royalties on his hits. To this day, AIR remains one of the world's pre-eminent recording studios. In 1979, Martin opened a studio on the Caribbean island of Montserrat. This studio was destroyed by Hurricane Hugo ten years later.|$|E
