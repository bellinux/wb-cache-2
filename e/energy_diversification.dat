40|$|AbstractEnergy {{security}} is {{strongly related to}} energy and climate policies. Understanding of energy security implications is critically important for shaping policy measures. This study presents the future energy security assessment in Thailand under three energy scenarios.

These indicators were clustered into four groups, including <b>energy</b> demand, <b>diversification</b> of <b>energy</b> supply resources, environmental dimension, and energy market. The three scenarios were derived from published data. The analysis suggests that Thailand needs to develop specific policy measures to enhance energy security in terms of energy market dimension and to pay more attention in national energy efficiency and total CO 2 emissions to maintain the economic growth...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{discusses}} Egypt's recent {{energy sector}} and policy developments against objectives {{and issues of}} the energy policy strategy adopted in 2007. It reviews energy supply and demand, pricing and subsidies as well as institutional arrangements and respective reform projects {{from the perspective of}} assessing achievements. It identifies the consequences of the policy and the long-term outlook and reports on the internal policy struggle. The policy strategy of 2007 is directed at energy security, social and industrial development. Environmental or climate objectives play no role. Energy efficiency is at best considered an instrument. The implementation of the strategy has been successful on the supply side, but not on the demand side. Price reform, refocusing subsidies and sector reform were not achieved. This has negatively affected <b>energy</b> efficiency and <b>diversification,</b> <b>energy</b> availability and supply security, the State budget and the sector's financial capacity. It causes rising energy import requirements and increasing risks to the current account balance. In spite of that, "old guard" and industrial establishment favour the resource-based development based on cheap energy and protract price reform, whereas another group of businessmen wants a sustainable development concept and monetize the oil and gas production to invest in Egypt's competitiveness.

40|$|The {{security}} of energy supply {{is one of}} the main objectives of EU energy policy. In this paper, we introduce an index designed to evaluate the short-term risks associated with the external supply of energy to the EU Member States. It combines measures of <b>energy</b> import <b>diversification,</b> political risks of the supplying country, risk associated with energy transit, and the economic impact of a supply disruption. We construct separate indexes for three primary energy types, oil, gas and coal, and demonstrate that Member States' levels of supply risk exposure differ across energies. Most other studies of this kind provide aggregate indexes combining different types of energy. Our results suggest that an aggregate approach could be misleading, at least for discussions of the short-term response to risks. We discuss the implications of our findings for the common energy policy. Index Security of supply Supply risk...|$|R
