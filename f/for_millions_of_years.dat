5|$|According to medieval era Jain text, Rishabha (Adinatha) {{performed}} asceticism <b>for</b> <b>millions</b> <b>of</b> <b>years,</b> {{then returned}} to Ashtapada where he fasted to his death (moksha) and then god Indra came, with his fellow gods from the heavens, to cremate his body with sandalwood, camphor, butter, and other fire offerings.|$|E
5|$|Evidence for the {{existence}} of stasis has also been corroborated from the genetics of sibling species, species which are morphologically indistinguishable, but whose proteins have diverged sufficiently to suggest they have been separated <b>for</b> <b>millions</b> <b>of</b> <b>years.</b> A paramount example of evolutionary stasis is the fern Osmunda claytoniana. Based on paleontological evidence it has remained unchanged, even at the level of fossilized nuclei and chromosomes, for at least 180 million years.|$|E

5|$|The orb {{itself was}} buried {{deep in the}} ground <b>for</b> <b>millions</b> <b>of</b> <b>years,</b> until it was {{discovered}} by Karnath, an evil sorcerer. Upon finding the orb, Karnath fused it into his own magical staff, and on doing so learned {{the history of the}} Sarnathians. He became obsessed with the orb and the task of releasing these beings from the Realm of Unreality. After years of isolation in his castle, as his own death was drawing near, Karnath was finally able to cast a powerful spell over his staff. This spell was designed such that upon contact with the orb, it would unleash its most powerful state and tear the fabric of reality once more.|$|E
25|$|Although {{some animals}} (dolphins and bats) have used sound for {{communication}} and object detection <b>for</b> <b>millions</b> <b>of</b> <b>years,</b> use by humans {{in the water}} is initially recorded by Leonardo da Vinci in 1490: a tube inserted into the water {{was said to be}} used to detect vessels by placing an ear to the tube.|$|E
25|$|Tectonic activity, {{which results}} in coastlines rising from the ocean, may also cause a beach system to become {{stranded}} above the high-water mark and lock in the heavy mineral sands. Similarly, a beach system which is drowned by the subsidence of a coastline may be preserved, often <b>for</b> <b>millions</b> <b>of</b> <b>years,</b> until it is either covered by sedimentation or rises from the ocean.|$|E
50|$|Phoebe {{formed in}} the Kuiper belt within three million years after {{the origin of the}} Solar System.

5|$|Carbon may burn vigorously and brightly in the {{presence}} of air at high temperatures. Large accumulations of coal, which have remained inert <b>for</b> hundreds <b>of</b> <b>millions</b> <b>of</b> <b>years</b> in the absence of oxygen, may spontaneously combust when exposed to air in coal mine waste tips, ship cargo holds and coal bunkers, and storage dumps.|$|R
25|$|In coevolution, {{where the}} {{existence}} of one species is tightly {{bound up with the}} life of another species, new or 'improved' adaptations which occur in one species are often followed by the appearance and spread of corresponding features in the other species. These relationships are intrinsically dynamic, and may continue on a trajectory <b>for</b> <b>millions</b> <b>of</b> <b>years,</b> as has occurred in the relationship between flowering plants and pollinating insects.|$|E
25|$|The {{siliceous}} {{shells of}} Collodaria are often preserved in sediment <b>for</b> <b>millions</b> <b>of</b> <b>years.</b> Micropaleontologists have utilized the fossil records of Collodaria to describe extinct species {{and the evolution}} of extant species through time using various notable features on the skeleton such as the size, number of radiate spines, and the presence of appendages. It was estimated that the lineage of Radiolarians, the ancestors of Collodaria, arose in early Paleozoic era.|$|E
25|$|In compact stars quark matter would occupy cubic {{kilometers}} and exist <b>for</b> <b>millions</b> <b>of</b> <b>years,</b> so the thermodynamic {{limit is}} appropriate. However, the neutrinos escape, violating lepton number, so the phase space for quark matter in compact stars only has two dimensions, temperature (T) and quark number chemical potential μ. A strangelet {{is not in}} the thermodynamic limit of large volume, so it is like an exotic nucleus: it may carry electric charge.|$|E

50|$|Around 550 {{million years}} ago, on the {{boundary}} between the Ediacaran and Cambrian, the first group of cratons eventually fused again with Amazonia, West Africa and the Rio de la Plata cratons. This tectonic phase is called the Pan-African orogeny. It created a configuration of continents that would remain stable <b>for</b> hundreds <b>of</b> <b>millions</b> <b>of</b> <b>years</b> {{in the form of the}} continent Gondwana.|$|R
25|$|Other major {{characters}} include Warbucks' right-hand men, Punjab, an eight-foot {{native of}} India, introduced in 1935, and the Asp, an inscrutably generalized East Asian, who {{first appeared in}} 1937. There was also the mysterious Mister Am, a friend of Warbucks' who wore a Santa Claus–like beard and was of a jovial personality. He claimed to have lived <b>for</b> <b>millions</b> <b>of</b> <b>years</b> and even had supernatural powers. Some strips hinted that he may even be God.|$|E
25|$|In humans, the {{preferentially}} expressed antigen of melanoma (PRAME) {{gene family}} is expanded. It is actively expressed in cancers, but normally is testis-specific, possibly involved in spermatogenesis. The PRAME family has 26 members on human chromosome 1. In the macaque, it has eight, {{and has been}} very simple and stable <b>for</b> <b>millions</b> <b>of</b> <b>years.</b> The PRAME family arose in translocations in the common mouse-primate ancestor 85 million years ago, and is expanded on mouse chromosome 4.|$|E
25|$|Fusion {{power would}} provide more energy {{for a given}} weight of fuel than any {{fuel-consuming}} energy source currently in use, and the fuel itself (primarily deuterium) exists abundantly in the Earth's ocean: about 1 in 6500 hydrogen atoms in seawater is deuterium. Although this may seem a low proportion (about 0.015%), because nuclear fusion reactions {{are so much more}} energetic than chemical combustion and seawater is easier to access and more plentiful than fossil fuels, fusion could potentially supply the world's energy needs <b>for</b> <b>millions</b> <b>of</b> <b>years.</b>|$|E
5|$|All rock now {{exposed in}} the area of the park is volcanic, but this has not always been the case. <b>For</b> {{hundreds}} <b>of</b> <b>millions</b> <b>of</b> <b>years,</b> the Lassen region underwent repeated uplifting to form mountains, only to have them worn down and submerged under encroaching seas.

25|$|The TMA-1 was dug {{up during}} the lunar night, but after sunrise and its {{exposure}} to direct sunlight, TMA-1 emits a single powerful burst of radio waves – aimed at Iapetus (Saturn) in the novel, and aimed at Jupiter in the motion picture. Its powerful magnetic field disappears immediately. In the novel, some scientists speculate that its magnetic field came from large electric currents, circulating {{in a system of}} superconductors <b>for</b> <b>millions</b> <b>of</b> <b>years</b> as an energy-storage mechanism. All of that electric power was expended in the one radio signal.|$|E
25|$|The {{volcanic}} {{history of}} the Northern Cordilleran Volcanic Province presents a record of volcanic activity in northwestern British Columbia, central Yukon and the U.S. state of easternmost Alaska. The volcanic activity lies {{in the northern part}} of the Western Cordillera of the Pacific Northwest region of North America. Extensional cracking of the North American Plate in this part of North America has existed <b>for</b> <b>millions</b> <b>of</b> <b>years.</b> Continuation of this continental rifting has fed scores of volcanoes throughout the Northern Cordilleran Volcanic Province over at least the past 20million years (see Geology of the Pacific Northwest) and occasionally continued into geologically recent times.|$|E
25|$|The Mackenzie River delta was a {{focus of}} ground and air surveys as early as 1957, and geologists drew {{comparisons}} then to the Mississippi and Niger Deltas, speculating that the Mackenzie could prove as prolific. <b>For</b> <b>millions</b> <b>of</b> <b>years</b> sediments had been pouring out of {{the mouth of the}} Mackenzie, creating tremendous banks of sand and shale – laminates of sedimentary rock warped into promising geological structures. Drilling began in the Mackenzie Delta-Tuktoyaktuk Peninsula in 1962, and accelerated during the early 1970s. The mouth of the Mackenzie River was not a Prudhoe Bay, but it did contain large gas fields.|$|E

40|$|Abstract: The Wilson Cycle, the {{repeated}} {{opening and closing}} of oceans, commonly along roughly the same lines, is here attributed {{to the presence of}} eclogite-facies roots of partially collapsed orogens.

25|$|Most of the earth's carbon {{is stored}} inertly in the earth's lithosphere. Much {{of the carbon}} stored in the earth's mantle was stored there when the earth formed. Some of it was {{deposited}} {{in the form of}} organic carbon from the biosphere. Of the carbon stored in the geosphere, about 80% is limestone and its derivatives, which form from the sedimentation of calcium carbonate stored in the shells of marine organisms. The remaining 20% is stored as kerogens formed through the sedimentation and burial of terrestrial organisms under high heat and pressure. Organic carbon stored in the geosphere can remain there <b>for</b> <b>millions</b> <b>of</b> <b>years.</b>|$|E
25|$|Another {{significant}} {{natural area}} within Dee Why is the Stony Range Regional Botanic Garden, established in 1957 {{on the site}} of an old quarry and located just south of the Dee Why town centre. The garden, which contains plants from all over Australia as well as those indigenous to the area, has four main sections, the rainforest gully, the sandstone heath {{on the site of}} the quarry, the Federation Cascades built in 2001 to commemorate the centenary of the federation of Australia, and the primitive plant section, with examples of plant species that have survived <b>for</b> <b>millions</b> <b>of</b> <b>years.</b> The garden is open from 8am to 5pm every day except Christmas Day, and admission is free.|$|E
25|$|Attenborough {{points out}} that because of natural forces, the Earth's {{temperature}} has been fluctuating <b>for</b> <b>millions</b> <b>of</b> <b>years,</b> long before humans arrived. However, it is the additional carbon dioxide, leading {{to an increase in}} the greenhouse effect, which must also be taken into account. When fossil fuels are burnt, such as coal, fuel oil or natural gas, the carbon emissions combine with oxygen to further thicken the Earth's atmospheric 'blanket' and thus warm the planet. An analysis of ice cores can provide information from thousands of years ago. Comparisons of carbon dioxide levels show that those of today are far beyond anything seen in the past. The scientists interviewed are convinced that humans are responsible.|$|E
5000|$|Seyfert's Sextet is a {{group of}} galaxies about 190 million light-years away in the {{constellation}} Serpens. The group appears to contain six members, but one of the galaxies is a background object and another [...] "galaxy" [...] is actually a separated part of one of the other galaxies. The gravitational interaction among these galaxies should continue <b>for</b> hundreds <b>of</b> <b>millions</b> <b>of</b> <b>years.</b> Ultimately, the galaxies will merge to form a single giant elliptical galaxy.|$|R
50|$|Competition {{has been}} {{observed}} between individuals, populations and species, {{but there is little}} evidence that competition has been the driving force in the evolution of large groups.

5000|$|Modern {{revision}} of the geologic sciences has restricted formations to lithologies, because lithological units are formed by depositional environments, {{some of which may}} persist <b>for</b> hundreds <b>of</b> <b>millions</b> <b>of</b> <b>years</b> and will transgress chronostratigraphic intervals or fossil-based methods of correlating rocks. For example, the Hamersley Basin of Western Australia is a Proterozoic sedimentary basin where up to 1200 <b>million</b> <b>years</b> <b>of</b> sedimentation is preserved within the intact sedimentary stratigraphy, with up to 300 million years represented by a single lithological unit of banded iron formation and shale.|$|R
