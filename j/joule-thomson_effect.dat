Currently, leak-before-break (LBB) design codes for pressure vessels do not take into account of the subsequent low temperature depression and the drop in fracture toughness {{in the aftermath of a}} leak. This study is to ensure the integrity of the compressed natural gas (CNG) containment in marine transportation vessels being proposed to transport the gas in highly pressurized (up to 250 bar) cylinders. A numerical method was proposed to simulate the heat transfer between the high pressure argon gas leaking through a narrow crack and the surrounding metal which is caused by the <b>Joule-Thomson</b> cooling <b>effect</b> of the leaking argon. A one-way coupling model was developed to calculate the gas pressure drop at different crack depth, followed by the temperature drop. A heat transfer simulation then calculated the temperature in the metal in the vicinity of the crack. The Redlich-Kwong (RK) equation with a relatively high accuracy was adopted to evaluate the temperature change of the leaking argon. The modified Petukhov correlation by Adams et al. was employed to evaluate the heat transfer coefficient of leaking argon. A MATLAB code was developed to iteratively calculate the properties of leaking gas in a crack which was fitted as formula as boundary conditions in heat transfer simulation of COMSOL program. Under the maximum internal pressure of 91 bar, the simulated temperature drop of the test plate in the vicinity of the crack caused by the <b>Joule-Thomson</b> cooling <b>effect</b> is 16. 2 °C.

25|$|In thermodynamics, the <b>Joule–Thomson</b> <b>effect</b> (also {{known as}} the Joule–Kelvin effect, Kelvin–Joule effect, or Joule–Thomson expansion) {{describes}} the temperature change of a real gas or liquid (as differentiated from an ideal gas) when it is forced through a valve or porous plug while kept insulated so that no heat is exchanged with the environment. This procedure is called a throttling process or Joule–Thomson process.

A gas must be below its inversion temperature to be liquefied by the Linde cycle. For this reason, simple Linde cycle liquefiers, starting from ambient temperature, cannot be used to liquefy helium, hydrogen, or neon.

The {{focus of this}} study is on evaluating the importance of Joule-Thomson cooling during CO 2 injection into depleted natural gas reservoirs. Joule-Thomson cooling is the adiabatic cooling that accompanies the expansion of a real gas. If Joule-Thomson cooling were extreme, injectivity and formation permeability could be altered by the freezing of residual water, formation of hydrates, and fracturing due to thermal stresses. The TOUGH 2 /EOS 7 C module for CO 2 -CH 4 -H 2 O mixtures is used as the simulation analysis tool. For verification of EOS 7 C, the classic Joule-Thomson expansion experiment is modeled for pure CO 2 resulting in Joule-Thomson coefficients in agreement with standard references to within 5 - 7 percent. For demonstration purposes, CO 2 injection at constant pressure and with a large pressure drop (~; 50 bars) is presented in order to show that cooling by more than 20 oC can occur by this effect. Two more-realistic constant-rate injection cases show that for typical systems in the Sacramento Valley, California, the <b>Joule-Thomson</b> cooling <b>effect</b> is minimal.

Measured information can be used to interpret flow profiles along the wellbore including junction and build section. In this second project year, we have completed a forward model to predict temperature and pressure profiles in complex wells. As a comprehensive temperature model, we have developed an analytical reservoir flow model which takes into account <b>Joule-Thomson</b> <b>effects</b> in the near well vicinity and multiphase non-isothermal producing wellbore model, and couples those models accounting mass and heat transfer between them. For further inferences such as water coning or gas evaporation, we will need a numerical non-isothermal reservoir simulator, and unlike existing (thermal recovery, geothermal) simulators, it should capture subtle temperature change occurring in a normal production. We will show the results from the analytical coupled model (analytical reservoir solution coupled with numerical multi-segment well model) to infer the anomalous temperature or pressure profiles under various conditions, and the preliminary results from the numerical coupled reservoir model which solves full matrix including wellbore grids.

30|$|The {{performance}} of gas-drilling (drilling {{oil and gas}} wells with air, nitrogen, or natural gas) is very unpredictable in many areas {{due to lack of}} proper design of drilling parameters because of limited understanding of gas–rock interaction which requires knowledge of heat transfer in the well system. Complete analysis of rock failure requires an accurate mathematical model to predict gas temperature at the bottom hole. The currently available mathematical models are unsuitable for use for the purpose because they do not consider the effects of formation fluid influx, Joule–Thomson cooling, and entrained drill cuttings. A new analytical solution for predicting gas temperature profiles inside the drill string and in the annulus was derived in this study for gas-drilling, considering all these three effects. Results of sensitivity analyses show that formation fluid influx can significantly increase the temperature profiles in both the drill string and the annulus. The <b>Joule–Thomson</b> cooling <b>effect</b> lowers the temperature in the annulus only in a short interval near the bottom hole. The drill cuttings entrained at the bottom hole can slightly increase the temperature profile in the annulus.|$|R

In turn, this temperature change may have a large influence on the permeation properties. Moreover, feed gas may condense due to sudden expansion caused by the decrease in pressure while permeating through the membrane. The effect of different parameters on the temperature change due to JT effect has been investigated under the present study. It is shown that the temperature drop is quite significant for feed gas with high CO 2 contents and high pressure, and thus potentially causes condensation across the membrane. It may be prevented by achieving a predetermined dew point before the membrane and then heating the gas to provide a sufficient margin of super heat. This increase in temperature increases the margin between the gas dew point and operating temperature and thus prevents condensation in the membrane...|$|R

40|$|We {{take three}} flow simulators, {{all based on}} Darcy’s Law but with {{different}} numerical solver implementations, to assess {{some of the issues}} surrounding their use to model underground CO 2 storage. We focus on the Sleipner CO 2 injection project, which, with its seismic monitoring datasets, provides unique insights into CO 2 plume development during a large-scale injection operation. The case studies firstly compare simulator performance in terms of outputs and run-times on carefully matched model scenarios; then we compare numerical with analytical Darcy solutions to explore the potential for modelling simplification; finally we look at the effects of including conservation of energy in the simulations. The initial case-study used simplified axisymmetric model geometry to simulate the upward flux of CO 2 through a heterogeneous reservoir, incorporating multiphase flow with coupled CO 2 dissolution into formation brine. All three codes produced near-identical results with respect to CO 2 migration velocity and total upward CO 2 flux at the reservoir top. The second case-study involved 3 D modelling of the growth of the topmost layer of CO 2 trapped and migrating beneath topseal topography. Again the three codes showed excellent agreement. In the third case-study the simulators were tested against a simplified analytical solution for gravity currents to model the spreading of a single CO 2 layer beneath a flat caprock. Neglecting capillary effects, the numerical models showed similar layer migration and geometry to the analytical model, but it was necessary to minimise the effects of numerical dispersion by adopting very fine cell thicknesses. The final case-study was designed to test the non-isothermal effects of injecting CO 2 into a reservoir at non-ambient temperature. Only two of the simulators solve for conservation of energy, but both showed a near identical thermal anomaly, dominated by <b>Joule-Thomson</b> <b>effects.</b> These can be significant, particularly where reservoir conditions are close to the critical point for CO 2 where property variations can significantly affect plume mobility and also seismic response. In conclusion, the three simulators show robust consistency, any differences far less than would result from geological parameter uncertainty and limitations of model resolution. In this respect the three implementations are significantly different in terms of computing resource requirement and it is clear that approaches with simplified physics will pay rich dividends in allowing more detailed reservoir heterogeneity to be included. Contrary to this, including conservation of energy is heavier on computing time but is likely to be required for storage scenarios where the injectant stream is significantly different in temperature to the reservoir and most critically for shallower storage reservoirs where CO 2 is close to its critical point...|$|R

This is to help prolong the security of fossil fuel based energy systems while cleaner and more sustainable technologies are developed. The work of this thesis is carried out {{as part of a}} multi-disciplinary project advancing knowledge on the modelling and monitoring of geological carbon storage/sequestration (GCS). The underlying principles for mathematically describing the multi-physics of multiphase multicomponent behaviour in porous media are reviewed with particular interest on their application to modelling GCS. A fully coupled non-isothermal multiphase Biot-type double-porosity formulation is derived, where emphasis during derivation is on capturing the coupled hydro-thermomechanical (HTM) processes for the purposes of study. The formulated system of governing field equations is discretised in space by considering the standard Galerkin finite element procedure and its spatial refinement in the context of capturing coupled HTM processes within a GCS system. This presents a coupled set of nonlinear first-order ordinary differential equations in time. The system is discretised temporally and solved using an embedded finite difference method which is schemed with control theoretical techniques and an accelerated fixed-point-type procedure.

In this paper, we review the literature on thermal effects related to CCS, which is receiving an increasing interest as a result of the awareness that the comprehension of non-isothermal processes is crucial for a successful deployment of CCS projects. We start by reviewing CO 2 transport, which connects the regions where CO 2 is captured with suitable geostorage sites. The optimal conditions for CO 2 transport, both onshore (through pipelines) and offshore (through pipelines or ships), are such that CO 2 stays in liquid state. To minimize costs, CO 2 should ideally be injected at the wellhead in similar pressure and temperature conditions as it is delivered by transport. To optimize the injection conditions, coupled wellbore and reservoir simulators that solve the strongly non-linear problem of CO 2 pressure, temperature and density within the wellbore and non-isothermal two-phase flow within the storage formation have been developed. CO 2 in its way down the injection well heats up due to compression and friction at a lower rate than the geothermal gradient, and thus, reaches the storage formation at a lower temperature than that of the rock. Inside the storage formation, CO 2 injection induces temperature changes due to the advection of the cool injected CO 2, the <b>Joule-Thomson</b> cooling <b>effect,</b> endothermic water vaporization and exothermic CO 2 dissolution.

These coupled processes also play a relevant role in “Utilization” options that may provide an added value to the injected CO 2, such as Enhanced Oil Recovery (EOR), Enhanced Coal Bed Methane (ECBM) and geothermal energy extraction combined with CO 2 storage.

It is highly competitive as compared to pipelines and liquefied natural gas (LNG) transport for distances of up to 2, 500 – 3, 000 nautical miles. Due to the high pressure inside CNG containers, its safety is the first important factor to be considered. Leak-before-break (LBB) is an important methodology of maintaining the integrity of pressure vessels. However, the <b>Joule-Thomson</b> (JT) cooling <b>effect</b> occurred during a leak may impact {{the validity of the}} LBB approach.

Temperature distribution data (by production logging tools or fiber-optic sensors) {{is one of the}} valuable information for performance diagnosis. However, until today quantitative interpretation of dynamic temperature data is still challenging and requires in-depth mathematical modeling of heat and mass transfer during production in a complex flow system. The interpretation models developed to translate temperature data to flow conditions can be fully numerical-based simulations or analytical/semi-analytical approaches. With reasonable assumptions analytical/semi-analytical models are more suitable for real-time field applications. This dissertation presents the applications of using a coupled semi-analytical fracture model and a wellbore model to predict the temperature and pressure behavior in multiple-fractured horizontal wells in unconventional reservoirs during production. The thermal model calculated heat transfer in the fracture/reservoir/wellbore system considering subtle temperature changes caused by the <b>Joule-Thomson</b> cooling <b>effect.</b> The results showed that the wellbore fluid temperature behavior is sensitive to the flow condition, and can be used to estimate fracture initiation points, number of created fractures and flow profile along the horizontal wellbore. This dissertation discusses the characteristics of transient temperature behaviors corresponding to different wellbore constraints, and also the fracture volume which influence the flow rate/temperature distribution along a fractured horizontal wellbore. The temperature drop when gas entering the wellbore is more obvious at the toe and is weaken towards the heel with the uniform inflow rate distribution due to the fluid mixing inside the wellbore. Field cases are presented to illustrate the application of using the temperature model to understand the fracture/flow distribution. The estimation of flow rate distribution from the temperature model is compared to the interpretation of flow by production logging tools (PLT) and commercial software. The flow profile from the temperature model presents consistent trend with PLT measurement. It is more sensitive to the fluid entries (fracture locations) and less sensitive to the influence of flow regime inside the wellbore when compared with the interpretation from array production logging tools. The fast marching method (FMM) is presented in this study to get the thermal map near hydraulic/natural fractures. This method solves the front tracking problems efficiently. By doing so, we can consider a heterogeneity formation with fractures, and also complex fracture geometry compared with analytical solution. It is also superior in visibility of stimulated reservoir volume (SRV) and in computational efficiency compared to finite difference simulation...|$|R
