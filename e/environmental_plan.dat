25|$|Among the {{specific}} environmental projects with international support, {{the most important}} was the National <b>Environmental</b> <b>Plan</b> (Plano Nacional do Meio Ambiente—PNMA), which received a US$117 million loan from the World Bank. The National Environmental Fund (Fundo Nacional do Meio Ambiente—FNMA), in addition to budgetary funds, received US$20 million from the Inter-American Development Bank to finance the environmental activities of NGOs and small municipal governments. The Pilot Program for the Conservation of the Brazilian Rain Forests (Programa Piloto para a Proteção das Florestas Tropicais do Brasil—PPG-7) {{was supported by the}} world's seven richest countries (the so-called G-7) and the European Community, which allocated US$258 million for projects in the Amazon and Atlantic Forest regions. The Global Environment Facility (GEF), created in 1990, set aside US$30 million for Brazil, part of which is managed by a national fund called Funbio. GEF also established a small grants program for NGOs, which focused on the cerrado during its pilot phase. The World Bank also made loans for environmental and natural resource management in Rondônia and Mato Grosso, in part to correct environmental and social problems that had been created by the World Bank-funded development of the northwest corridor in the 1980s.|$|E

This paper provides a measurable approach to identify the environmental education gaps by evaluating environmen-tal plan quality based on a set of indicators. The descriptive results indicate that major environmental education gaps exist in many region-wide, global-wide, long-term, cumulative, and strategically critical environmental elements. The regression results further highlight the factors that can reduce the gaps in <b>environmental</b> <b>planning</b> education.

Ontario Premier Dalton McGuinty had been considerably less critical than his brother, federal Liberal Member of Parliament David McGuinty, having written to Prime Minister Harper on the environmental policy. The Premier had {{stressed the importance of}} a policy that considered the North American market as a whole, due to the automotive industry's importance to his province.

2500|$|Much of French debate {{revolved}} around {{the economy and the}} environment, with the two topics repeatedly being brought up in discussions allotted for other topics. Stephen Harper came under criticism from every other leader in nearly every topic, especially the economy and environment, with the other party leaders stating that Harper's politics had led to Canada's current crises in those two areas. Their points included that Harper's <b>environmental</b> <b>plan</b> was considered the worst of all developed countries by organizations around the world, with Elizabeth May labeling it [...] "a type of fraud," [...] and that his attempts to remove regulations in the financial sectors, similar to those done by the Bush administration in the United States, have led Canada to being nearly as hard hit by the current financial crisis as the United States.|$|E

40|$|<b>Environmental</b> <b>planning</b> and {{permitting}} {{for transportation}} projects {{is often seen}} {{as one of the}} top reasons for project delay. On design-build projects, this process is often treated as the critical path to advertising the project and on all transportation projects many critical phases of the project such as right of way acquisition, final design, and construction cannot begin until the <b>environmental</b> <b>planning</b> process is complete. The objective of this research is to identify challenges to the <b>environmental</b> <b>planning</b> and permitting process and opportunities for managing those challenges. To identify these challenges and opportunities, a synthesis of transportation and design-build research was done along with interviews with agencies leaders at seven State Departments of Transportation (DOTs). Once these challenges and opportunities were identified, example <b>environmental</b> <b>planning</b> documents and requests for proposals were reviewed from various State DOTs to document their usage. Additionally follow up interviews were conducted with <b>environmental</b> <b>planning</b> experts with experience on design-build projects from six of the State DOTs that were previously interviewed. This research contributes to the state of knowledge through providing comprehensive information on <b>environmental</b> <b>planning</b> and permitting challenges that must be managed on design-build transportation projects and opportunities for managing these challenges. Managing the identified challenges by utilizing these opportunities provides transportation agencies with opportunities to make the <b>environmental</b> <b>planning</b> and permitting process on design-build projects more efficient. This research contributes to the state of practice of transportation agencies through providing opportunities for streamlining environmental analysis and permitting that is vital to transportation agencies who strive to accelerate the delivery of design-build projects.
