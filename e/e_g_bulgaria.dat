40|$|Contrary to {{standard}} narratives on the declining function of parties in fostering political participation, this article argues {{that far from}} abandoning the cause of participation, post-communist political parties diversified {{the understanding of the}} party as a mobilizing agency by adapting their internal organizations. On the basis of a mid-range number of cases (<b>e.</b> <b>g.</b> <b>Bulgaria,</b> the Czech Republic, Hungary, Poland, Romania, and Slovakia) the study identified different patterns of evolution within a complex interaction effect between participation and organizational development. The peculiarity of the parties’ organization and functions has shaped political participation both as an opportunity structure (legitimizing the political system and increasing citizens’ involvement in politics) and as a democratic challenge (increasing the pro-pensity of parties towards populism, ‘seasonal’ membership, corruption and clientelism) ...|$|E
40|$|This book aims to {{fill this}} gap by {{describing}} Muslim communities and their experiences in Central and Eastern Europe, both in countries with marginal Muslim populations, often not exceeding 1 % (e. g. Hungary and Lithuania), and in countries with significant Muslim minorities, sometimes proportionally larger than in France (<b>e.</b> <b>g.</b> <b>Bulgaria).</b> Some of these countries {{have a long history}} of Muslim presence, dating back to the 14 th century in the case of the Tatars (e. g. Poland and Ukraine) and the 16 th century in the case of the first Muslim arrivals in the Balkans (e. g. Romania, Slovenia) during the Ottoman era. In other countries (e. g. Slovakia), Muslims have arrived only recently. What all these countries have in common is a Communist past inside the former Eastern bloc. This consisted mainly in being excluded, to a large extent, from the outside world – i. e. the so­called First World (meaning the West) – in economic, political and cultural terms. Thus, Central and Eastern Europe attracted only few immigrants from outside its own regional borders, which still may be observed in the ethnic and national structure of the countries. Another important factor is that none of the Central and Eastern European countries ever had any colonies. In fact, some countries were partitioned by local superpowers, while others emerged only after the collapse of the Soviet bloc. On the other hand, most of these countries have an autochthonous Muslim population which became a vital part of local cultures and societies in their Central and Eastern European homelands.

EMMA is continuously improving by the addition of further focal mechanisms found in literature. At the present time, EMMA pre-release 3 includes more than 12700 focal solutions, about twice of previous official release 2. 2 (Vannucci and Gasperini, 2004). They cover a time window from 1905 to 2006. In the new release, many added solutions are in areas not much covered or completely uncovered in the previous one (<b>e.</b> <b>g.</b> <b>Bulgaria,</b> Germany, Anatolia). As in the previous versions (Vannucci and Gasperini, 2003 and 2004), we have uniformed the different formats and notations of the data available from different sources and we have tried to solve misprints, inaccuracies and inconsistencies that might make the data unusable for other investigations. By an automatic procedure based on several criteria, we have chosen the “most representative” (best) solution when more than one is available for the same earthquake. Thanks to this, we have obtained about 6000 best solutions. The end user can use the best solution obtained with our procedure or he can change criteria. The database allows to make selections and to export data files suitable to be handled by graphic software and user generated scripts. In the new version, still MS-ACCESS based, we have added geographic information to the display of the focal solution, as well as we have integrated the hypocentral and magnitude data found on the original papers with those reported by regional and local catalogs and bulletins. In order to make EMMA more accessible, a web version is currently in progress. Through an internet connection it will be possible data selection and export, without installation and configuration problems found in the past. EMMA was already used in the past and will be (hopefully) useful in the future to better characterize the tectonic deformation styles (e. g. by moment tensors sum within given areas or over regular geographical grids) particularly in areas of the European region where seismicity is moderate and only few CMT solutions are available. At the moment, we try to compute strain map for Mediterranean area, using EMMA data. In order to represent any recurrence in space, we identify small areas and apply to each one some spatial analyses. The work is still in progress, but preliminary results are satisfactory and in accord to previous studies...|$|E

40|$|The {{scope of}} this {{contribution}} is to {{provide an overview of}} recent trends in organised crime and money laundering activities in the countries of central and eastern Europe, and to underline the contrast policies devised to prevent the infiltration of financial systems in these countries by organised criminal groups. However, in order to achieve a better understanding of these phenomena and to make an evaluation of existing contrast and prevention policies, it is necessary to adopt a wider perspective, which also comprises western Europe. Some of the factors, in fact, which affect the development of transnational crime and the countermeasures taken at the national and international levels, are particularly relevant in the European continent (Adamoli 1998). The first is the globalisation of the economy, which at the European level means the establishment of a single market, which brings citizens and corporations from foreign countries increasingly in contact. Related to this are the abolition of border controls between Schengen states and the integration between western and eastern Europe through the transition of these countries towards a market-controlled economy, which have increased the opportunities for illicit transactions across borders (Winer 1997). Moreover, particularly relevant when tackling the issue of money laundering are improved communication technology (including telephone, fax and computer networks), the explosive increase in the use of computers in business, the development of electronic systems in the banking {{and other parts of the}} financial sector which use wire transfers to shift enormous amounts of cash around the world very rapidly. All these factors combine to make borders more and more permeable, favouring interdependence among businesses and their globalisation. Combined with the persisting difference and segmentation of anti-money laundering legislation at the regional level, they contributed to a rapid increase in transnational criminal activities, making it of increasing concern. In fact, just as legal businesses are expanding internationally in response to the globalisation of markets, so are the criminal enterprises seeking to develop both their structures and illicit activities at the international level in order to gain access to new markets, taking advantage of the discrepancies between the legal systems of countries in different parts of the world. These “environmental” changes, the changes in organised criminal structures and activities and the tightening of legislation and contrast policies in general, also had an impact on the changes in money laundering operations. In fact criminals, in their effort to maximise opportunities for earning profit while minimising, at the same time, the risk of being arrested and convicted, have been very quick to shift from one activity to the other and to enter new markets. In particular, the persisting discrepancies existing between anti-money laundering legislation in eastern uropean countries coupled with, in some of them, its scarce and ineffective mplementation, have to a certain extent created a “displacement effect” which has ead criminal groups to find there more “friendly” environments where to conduct heir illicit activities. With a view to describing organised criminal activities, trends in money aundering operations and contrast policies in central and eastern Europe, the analysis has been divided into three main parts. In the first part, a brief outline will be delineated of the most recent developments in the structure and activities conducted at the European level by organised crime groups. The second part of the paper is devoted to the analysis of some money laundering trends in eastern Europe. The third and final part compares anti-money laundering legislation enacted by the countries of eastern Europe with European Union standards, highlighting at the same time the provisions existing in countries which have recently enacted domestic legislation (<b>e.</b> <b>g</b> <b>Bulgaria,</b> Estonia, Latvia and Romania) ...|$|E

40|$|This paper updates the {{information}} on the prevalence of the disorders induced by iodine deficiency (IDD) in Europe. Thirty-two European countries were still affected by mild to severe iodine deficiency in the late 1990 s. The most severely affected countries were in Eastern Europe, including Central Asia, but Western Europe was also still affected. National surveys recently conducted in 11 of these countries show that, {{with the exception of the}} Netherlands, none has yet reached a state of iodine sufficiency, though very significant improvement in the situation has been evidenced in many of them, <b>e.</b> <b>g.</b> Poland, <b>Bulgaria</b> and Macedonia. The consequences of persisting iodine deficiency are goitre, hyperavidity of the thyroid for iodide (which increases the risk of thyroid irradiation in the event of a nuclear accident) and subclinical hypothyroidism during pregnancy and early infant (with a concomitant risk of minor brain damage and irreversible impairment of the neuropsycho-intellectual development of offspring). Access to iodised salt at the household level in European countries affected by IDD increased from 5 %- 10 % in 1990 to 28 % in 1999. This constitutes encouraging progress. However, in terms of access of iodine-deficient countries to iodised salt, Europe remains the worst region in the world, as shown by the fact that the mean figure worldwide in 1999 was 68 %. In Latin America it even reached 90 %. Salt iodisation has to be further implemented in Europe. Until that goal is achieved, iodine supplementation in those groups most sensitive to the effects of iodine deficiency (pregnant and lactating women and young infants) will have to be considered in the most severely affected areas.

40|$|In this study, {{we measure}} the area-specific {{poverty in the}} European Union (EU). To this end, we measure poverty at the sub-national level in two ways: (i) using the EU {{nomenclature}} of territorial units (NUTS 1 mostly); (ii) using different {{with respect to the}} degree of urbanisation areas within countries. The measurement of poverty is based on the Multidimensional Poverty Index (UN MPI) by Alkire and Santos (2010, 2013). With the data from the European Union Survey on Income and Living Conditions (EU SILC), we formulate the Index of Multidimensional Poverty at the regional level, namely the Multidimensional Poverty Index (MPI-reg). The MPI-reg framework comprises three dimensions — health, education, and standard of living — quantified by three sub-indexes: Multidimensional Poverty in Health Index (MPI–H), Poverty in Education Index (MPI–E) and Multidimensional Poverty in Living Standards Index (MPI–L), respectively. In 2012 the MPI-reg was computed for 24 EU countries. Unfortunately, due to data unavailability calculations for Belgium, Ireland, the Netherlands, and Slovenia were not executed. However, {{it was the first time}} when poverty was assessed for Croatia. Our results show that the level of poverty in the EU ranges from 0. 5 % to 13 - 15 %, with Denmark and Sweden having unequivocally the lowest share of poor people and Latvia, Bulgaria and Romania, having the largest share of poor people. It must be noted, however, that generally, comparing to the situation in 2011, poverty level decreased. The only considerable exception from this reasoning is Portugal, where the MPI-reg increased (1. 3 pp.). On the other hand, the most significant decrease in the MPI-reg was recorded in Latvia, Bulgaria, and Romania, i. e., in the least affluent countries with respect to the MPI-reg. We also see that there is a positive relationship between the stratification level and all adjusted headcount ratios, headcount ratios and intensity of poverty scores. This positive relationship implies that there are countries where there is small stratification with respect to poverty (<b>e.</b> <b>g.</b> Sweden, Denmark, the Czech Republic and Finland) and countries, usually poor ones (<b>e.</b> <b>g.</b> Romania, <b>Bulgaria</b> and Lithuania), where considerable stratification with respect to poverty occurs. In general, in the lowest and moderately low scoring countries, the worst situation with respect to poverty is observed in sparsely populated areas, and the best situation occurs in densely populated areas. On the other hand, in the best scoring countries, poverty is relatively higher in the densely populated areas compared to the less well-populated areas. The results confirm our previously published findings (see Weziak-Bialowolska & Dijkstra 2014) that the European Union regions are strongly diversified with respect to poverty. This implies that considerable within-country differences are indicated. Therefore, relying only on countrywide estimates may be misleading when properly assessing the relative standing of a region with respect to poverty. JRC.

40|$|We provide {{evidence}} that goal priming effects are context dependent. We show that goal primes encourage prime-consistent behavior when the behavioral context is common and prime-inconsistent behavior when the behavioral context is un-common. While the prime-consistent behavior is compatible with existing theory, the prime-inconsistent behavior poses a theoretical challenge. We argue that un-common behavioral contexts encourage {{the release of a}} primed goal and, as a consequence, an increase in the relative activation of information inconsistent with the primed goal and prime-inconsistent behavior. The influence of priming in consumer behavior is ubiq-uitous. Primes have been shown to influence product evaluations (<b>e.</b> <b>g.,</b> Brendl, Markman, and Messner 2003), consideration set formation (<b>e.</b> <b>g.,</b> Shapiro 1999), choices (<b>e.</b> <b>g.,</b> Chun and Kruglanski 2005; Sheeran et al. 2005), the extremity of behavior (<b>e.</b> <b>g.,</b> Shang, Reed, and Croson 2008), and product experience (<b>e.</b> <b>g.,</b> Aaker and Stayman 1992). The pervasive influence of primes has also led to an exten-sive documentation of the processes supporting priming ef-fects. Priming effects have been attributed to self-concept activation (<b>e.</b> <b>g.,</b> Shang et al. 2008; Wheeler, DeMarree, and Petty 2007), information accessibility (<b>e.</b> <b>g.,</b> Wheeler and Berger 2007), trait activation (<b>e.</b> <b>g.,</b> Srull and Wyer 1979), exemplar activation (<b>e.</b> <b>g.,</b> Stapel, Koomen, and Velthuijsen 1998), category activation (<b>e.</b> <b>g.,</b> Bargh, Chen, and Burrows 1996), habit activation (<b>e.</b> <b>g.,</b> Sheeran et al. 2005), mimicr...|$|R
40|$|In {{recent years}} we have {{witnessed}} an increasing interest in food processing and eating behaviors. This is probably due to several reasons. The biological relevance of food choices, {{the complexity of the}} food-rich environment in which we presently live (making food-intake regulation difficult), and the increasing health care cost due to illness associated with food (food hazards, food contamination, and aberrant food-intake). Despite the importance of the issues and the relevance of this research, comprehensive and validated databases of stimuli are rather limited, outdated, or not available for non-commercial purposes to independent researchers who aim at developing their own research program. The FoodCast Research Image Database (FRIDa) we present here includes 877 images belonging to eight different categories: natural-food (<b>e.</b> <b>g.,</b> strawberry), transformed-food (<b>e.</b> <b>g.,</b> french fries), rotten-food (<b>e.</b> <b>g.,</b> moldy banana), natural-non-food items (<b>e.</b> <b>g.,</b> pinecone), artificial food-related objects (<b>e.</b> <b>g.,</b> teacup), artificial objects (<b>e.</b> <b>g.,</b> guitar), animals (<b>e.</b> <b>g.,</b> camel), and scenes (<b>e.</b> <b>g.,</b> airport).

40|$|Background: There {{is a lack}} of {{understanding}} of young men's perspectives in obesity-related research. This study aims to: (1) identify young men's perceived motivators and barriers in adopting healthy eating and physical activity behaviours, and (2) explore any differences in responses by weight status categories. Methods: Ten focus groups (32 - 63 minutes; 3 - 9 participants per group) were conducted with 61 young men (BMI: 25. 3 ± 5. 1 kg/m², aged: 18 - 25 years) from the Hunter region, New South Wales, Australia. There were 35 (57. 4 %) healthy weight men and 26 (42. 6 %) overweight/ obese men. Three groups were with healthy weight participants, three with overweight/obese participants and four with mixed-BMI participants. Sessions were audio-recorded and transcribed. Data analysis was conducted by an independent researcher using NVIVO 10. Results: Motivators for healthy eating grouped into four themes: physical health (<b>e.</b> <b>g.</b> to live longer), sport or performance (<b>e.</b> <b>g.</b> to support their sporting goals), physical appearance (<b>e.</b> <b>g.</b> sexual attractiveness) and social influences (<b>e.</b> <b>g.</b> societal expectations to eat healthy), while key motivators for physical activity were: physical appearance (<b>e.</b> <b>g.</b> sexual attractiveness), social inclusion (<b>e.</b> <b>g.</b> making friends), physical and mental health (<b>e.</b> <b>g.</b> relieve stress) and improvements for sport or performance (<b>e.</b> <b>g.</b> improve fitness). Themes for key barriers to eating healthy were: intrinsic (<b>e.</b> <b>g.</b> perceived effort to adopt healthy eating), logistic (<b>e.</b> <b>g.</b> cost), and social factors (<b>e.</b> <b>g.</b> peer influence), while busy lifestyles (<b>e.</b> <b>g.</b> lack of time), logistic (<b>e.</b> <b>g.</b> cost), cognitive-emotional (<b>e.</b> <b>g.</b> feelings of inferiority) and social factors (<b>e.</b> <b>g.</b> family upbringing) were key barriers for physical activity. Responses varied little by BMI status. Conclusion: This research emphasises the importance of consulting young men when developing healthy lifestyle programs that aim to promote healthy eating and physical activity in young men. Future research is needed to identify the most effective ways to address their motivators and barriers in intervention research...|$|R
