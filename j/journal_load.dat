40|$|This paper {{investigates the}} {{variation}} of nonlinear stiffness and damping coefficients {{in a journal}} orbit with respect to equilibrium position. The journal orbit is obtained by the combined solution of equations of motion and Reynolds equation. In the linearized dynamic analysis, dynamic pressure is written as a perturbation of static pressure and pressure gradients at equilibrium position. However, {{in order to obtain}} nonlinear dynamic coefficients about equilibrium position, the dynamic pressure gradients in the orbit are also written as the first order perturbation of static pressure gradients and higher order pressure gradients for displacement and velocity perturbations. The dynamic coefficients are functions of bearing displacement and velocity perturbations. The higher order pressure gradients at equilibrium position are evaluated at various eccentricity ratios and L/D ratios of 0. 5 and 1. 0. The variation of nonlinear dynamic coefficients is analyzed for three Sommerfeld numbers of a two-axial groove journal bearing under the action of an external synchronous load along and perpendicular to the radial <b>journal</b> <b>load.</b> Results indicate that the oil film nonlinearities affect the journal motion at lower eccentricity ratios (higher Sommerfeld numbers) with wide variation in stiffness and damping coefficients...|$|E

Typically foil bearing performance has been reported at temperatures relevant to turbomachinery applications but only at an ambient pressure of one atmosphere. This dearth of data at alternate pressures has motivated the current test program. Two facilities {{were used in the}} test program, the ambient pressure rig and the high pressure rig. The test program utilized a 35 mm diameter by 27 mm long foil journal bearing having an uncoated Inconel X- 750 top foil running against a shaft with a PS 304 coated <b>journal.</b> <b>Load</b> capacity tests were conducted at 3, 6, 9, 12, 15, 18, and 21 krpm at temperatures from 25 to 500 C and at pressures from 0. 1 to 2. 5 atmospheres. Results show an increase in load capacity with increased ambient pressure and a reduction in load capacity with increased ambient temperature. Below one-half atmosphere of ambient pressure a dramatic loss of load capacity is experienced. Additional lightly loaded foil bearing performance in nitrogen at 25 C and up to 48 atmospheres of ambient pressure has also been reported. In the lightly loaded region of operation the power loss increases for increasing pressure at a fixed load. Knowledge of foil bearing performance at operating conditions found within potential machine applications will reduce program development risk of future foil bearing supported turbomachines...|$|E

Four hybrid bearing configurations were designed with emphasis on achieving maximum stiffness and damping.
