5|$|In view {{of growing}} labor shortages, on July 1, 1944 the War Manpower Commission made an {{important}} decision, ruling that {{from then on}} all hiring of male employees in the country was to be done through the United States <b>Employment</b> <b>Service</b> (USES). By that time the USES followed strict anti-discrimination employment practices. The PTC management finally gave in and within a week posted notices about available skilled positions that {{would be open to}} all applicants, regardless of race. The company accepted eight black applicants (three from the USES and five from its own ranks) to train as streetcar coachmen. Their training was to take place in late July, and they were to start taking an empty streetcar on the lines from August 1. It was that impending trial run of the streetcars by the eight black trainees that finally triggered the strike.|$|E

40|$|The thesis {{deals with}} an {{institutional}} reform of public <b>employment</b> <b>services</b> {{implemented in the}} Czech Republic in 2011. By merging social benefits administration with <b>employment</b> <b>services</b> into the newly established Labour Office of the Czech Republic, the right-wing government attempted to reduce the staffing and administrative costs of these services and to improve the governance of local labour offices. Another aim of the reform was to unify the management of <b>employment</b> <b>services.</b> Using the theoretical concept of "policy cycle" and "policy fiasco" the thesis analyses these organisational changes in the functioning of public <b>employment</b> <b>services</b> in the Czech Republic. Data consist of interviews with experts on labour market policy in the Czech Republic and two focus groups with employees of labour offices. The thesis concludes that there appeared several mistakes during implementation of the institutional reform of public <b>employment</b> <b>services</b> in the Czech Republic in 2011 {{in terms of the}} policy cycle and it can be referred to as a policy. The reform harmed the reputation and efficiency of <b>employment</b> <b>services...</b>|$|R

500|$|The black PTC {{employees}} {{enlisted the}} help of the NAACP and started lobbying the federal authorities, particularly the Fair Employment Practices Commission (FEPC), to intervene. The Fair Employment Practices Commission, created by an executive order of the President in 1941, was charged with ensuring non-discrimination employment practices by government contractors. Initially it was a fairly weak agency, but its authority was significantly strengthened in 1943 by a new executive order that required all government contracts to have a non-discrimination clause. As the war progressed, the manpower shortages were getting more severe. In January 1943 the PTC requested 100 white motormen from the United States <b>Employment</b> <b>Service</b> (USES), which {{was a part of the}} [...] War Manpower Commission (WMC). The WMC, aware that PTC had a pool of black employees seeking upgrading, asked the PTC to allow hiring of black employees for the vacant motormen positions. The PTC refused, again citing the [...] "customs clause" [...] of its union contract. After a complaint from the NAACP, the matter landed at the FEPC, headed at the time by Malcolm Ross.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{compares the}} {{effectiveness}} {{of public and private}} providers of <b>employment</b> <b>services.</b> Reporting from a randomized field experiment conducted in Denmark we assess empirically the case for contracting out <b>employment</b> <b>services</b> for a well-defined group of highly educated job-seekers (unemployed holding a university degree). Our findings suggest, first, that private providers deliver more intense, employment-oriented, and earlier services. Second, public and private provision of <b>employment</b> <b>services</b> are equally effective regarding subsequent labour market outcomes. And third, the two competing service delivery systems appear to be equally costly from a public spending perspective...|$|R
30|$|<b>Employment</b> <b>services,</b> such as {{job search}} assistance, {{can improve the}} {{functioning}} of the labor market through better information and intermediation between jobseekers and employers. Traditionally, <b>employment</b> <b>services</b> have been provided by public agencies but private agencies are increasingly important players. The evaluation record of <b>employment</b> <b>services</b> internationally is generally positive. They tend to improve employment and earnings prospects for participants and, since they are less costly than other types of interventions, their cost-effectiveness ranks well in comparison to other ALMPs (Kluve et al., 2006; Card et al. 2010; Betcherman et al. 2004). However, the usefulness of <b>employment</b> <b>services</b> tends to be limited, improving employment more for the skilled than the unskilled (Kluve et al., 2006). Their benefits are also greatest in the short run and tend to diminish over time (Card et al. 2015).|$|R

40|$|Objectives:  Comparatively {{few people}} with severe mental illness are {{employed}} despite evidence that many people within this group wish to obtain, can obtain and sustain employment, and that employment can contribute to recovery. This investigation aimed to: (i) describe the current policy and service environment within which {{people with severe}} mental illness receive employment services; (ii) identify evidence-based practices that improve employment outcomes for people with severe mental illness; (iii) {{determine the extent to}} which the current Australian policy environment is consistent with the implementation of evidence-based <b>employment</b> <b>services</b> for people with severe mental illness; and (iv) identify methods and priorities for enhancing <b>employment</b> <b>services</b> for Australians with severe mental illness through implementation of evidence-based practices. Method:  Current Australian practices were identified, having reference to policy and legal documents, funding body requirements and anecdotal reports. Evidence-based <b>employment</b> <b>services</b> for people with severe mental illness were identified through examination of published reviews and the results of recent controlled trials. Results:  Current policy settings support the provision of <b>employment</b> <b>services</b> for people with severe mental illness separate from clinical services. Recent studies have identified integration of clinical and <b>employment</b> <b>services</b> as a major factor in the effectiveness of <b>employment</b> <b>services.</b> This is usually achieved through co-location of employment and mental health services. Conclusions:  Optimal evidence-based <b>employment</b> <b>services</b> are needed by Australians with severe mental illness. Providing optimal services is a challenge in the current policy environment. Service integration may be achieved through enhanced intersectoral links between employment and mental health service providers as well as by co-locating employment specialists within a mental health care setting...|$|R

40|$|It {{cannot be}} taken for granted that fulling a job vacancy via the <b>employment</b> <b>services</b> (or via other job-seeking measures) will lead to {{additional}} employment or even to less unemployment. Behind the attempt to measure the gross effect (e. g. {{in the form of the}} number of placements matched) always lies the central idea that a greater intervention of the (public as well as private) <b>employment</b> <b>services</b> would be of benefit to the labour market. However, in assessing the efficiency of placements not enough attention has been paid to the fact that the quantitative volume is less important than the net effect for the clients of the <b>employment</b> <b>services</b> and the over-all economy. The decisive question at the micro level, that is, in regard to the clients of the <b>employment</b> <b>services,</b> is, what would have happened to them if they had not used these services? Studies of the net effect of the <b>employment</b> <b>services</b> as a jobseeking route have been rare up to now and can be found solely in North America and a few European countries. The jobseekers themselves unanimously agree that the activities of the public job placement services contribute effectively to the reduction of the length of unemployment. However, in an efficiency comparison with other paths of recruitment for firms, our research shows, on the contrary, that public and private <b>employment</b> <b>services</b> do not always fare well. At the macro level the question must be posed of how the activities of the <b>employment</b> <b>services</b> have affected the overall economic dimensions, such as the level and structure of employment and unemployment. Because the <b>employment</b> <b>services</b> cannot create jobs at the employer level for their clients, their activities result in the redistribution of employment opportunities and unemployment risks to the benefit of their clients. The case for private agents can be justified by their contribution to an improvement of the market allocation and the case for the public <b>employment</b> <b>services</b> by their contribution to the reintegration of hard-to-place groups of persons.
