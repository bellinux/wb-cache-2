5|$|Plutonium–uranium, {{with about}} 15–30mol.% plutonium, {{can be used}} as a nuclear fuel for <b>fast</b> <b>breeder</b> reactors. Its {{pyrophoric}} nature and high susceptibility to corrosion to the point of self-igniting or disintegrating after exposure to air require alloying with other components. Addition of aluminium, carbon or copper does not improve disintegration rates markedly, zirconium and iron alloys have better corrosion resistance but they disintegrate in several months in air as well. Addition of titanium and/or zirconium significantly increases the melting point of the alloy.|$|E
5|$|The {{economics}} of fission–fusion designs {{have always been}} questionable. The same basic effect can be created by replacing the central fusion reactor with a specially designed fission reactor, and using the surplus neutrons from the fission to breed fuel in the blanket. These <b>fast</b> <b>breeder</b> reactors have proven uneconomical in practice, and the greater expense of the fusion systems in the fission–fusion hybrid has always suggested they would be uneconomical unless built in very large units.|$|E
50|$|There are {{two types}} of breeders: <b>Fast</b> <b>breeders</b> and thermal breeders.|$|R

5|$|Potassium {{compounds}} {{are often}} used as fertilisers as potassium is an important element for plant nutrition. Potassium hydroxide {{is a very strong}} base, and is used to control the pH of various substances. Potassium nitrate and potassium permanganate {{are often used}} as powerful oxidising agents. Potassium superoxide is used in breathing masks, as it reacts with carbon dioxide to give potassium carbonate and oxygen gas. Pure potassium metal is not often used, but its alloys with sodium may substitute for pure sodium in <b>fast</b> <b>breeder</b> nuclear reactors.|$|E
5|$|Sixteen nuclear {{reactors}} produce about 3% of India’s electricity, and seven more are under construction. Spent fuel is processed at facilities in Trombay near Mumbai, at Tarapur {{on the west}} coast north of Mumbai, and at Kalpakkam on the southeast coast of India. Plutonium will be used in a <b>fast</b> <b>breeder</b> reactor (under construction) to produce more fuel, and other waste vitrified at Tarapur and Trombay. Interim storage for 30 years is expected, with eventual disposal in a deep geological repository in crystalline rock near Kalpakkam.|$|E
5|$|Sodium {{compounds}} {{have many}} applications, {{the most well-known}} being sodium chloride as table salt. Sodium salts of fatty acids are used as soap. Pure sodium metal also has many applications, including use in sodium-vapour lamps, which produce very efficient light compared to other types of lighting, and can help smooth the surface of other metals. Being a strong reducing agent, it {{is often used to}} reduce many other metals, such as titanium and zirconium, from their chlorides. Furthermore, it is very useful as a heat-exchange liquid in <b>fast</b> <b>breeder</b> nuclear reactors due to its low melting point, viscosity, and cross-section towards neutron absorption.|$|E
25|$|As of 2015, the {{identified}} resources of uranium are sufficient {{to provide more}} than 135 years of supply at the present rate of consumption. Technologies such as the thorium fuel cycle, reprocessing and <b>fast</b> <b>breeders</b> can, in theory, {{extend the life of}} uranium reserves from hundreds to thousands of years.|$|R
50|$|Another {{alternative}} to <b>fast</b> <b>breeders</b> is thermal breeder reactors that use uranium-233 bred from thorium as fission fuel in the thorium fuel cycle. Thorium is about 3.5 times {{more common than}} uranium in the Earth's crust, and has different geographic characteristics. This would extend the total practical fissionable resource base by 450%. India's three-stage nuclear power programme features {{the use of a}} thorium fuel cycle in the third stage, as it has abundant thorium reserves but little uranium.|$|R
50|$|Since then, he {{had been}} one of the most {{prominent}} and influential critics of nuclear power. Traube did not believe that the operation of nuclear-power plants was economically feasible or that it was possible to overcome the security risks. Also the construction of <b>fast</b> <b>breeders,</b> essential in the long-term use of nuclear power, was in his view too difficult to be realistic. He was a strong supporter of renewable energy. During the 1980s Traube achieved iconic status among Germans opposed to nuclear power. From 1990 to 1997, he was Director of the Institute for Energy-economics and Energy-politics at the University of Bremen.|$|R
5|$|The {{nuclear fission}} {{properties}} of berkelium {{are different from}} those of the neighboring actinides curium and californium, and they suggest berkelium to perform poorly as a fuel in a nuclear reactor. Specifically, berkelium-249 has a moderately large neutron capture cross section of 710 barns for thermal neutrons, 1200 barns resonance integral, but very low fission cross section for thermal neutrons. In a thermal reactor, much of it will therefore be converted to berkelium-250 which quickly decays to californium-250. In principle, berkelium-249 can sustain a nuclear chain reaction in a <b>fast</b> <b>breeder</b> reactor. Its critical mass is relatively high at 192kg; it can be reduced with a water or steel reflector but would still exceed the world production of this isotope.|$|E
5|$|All {{isotopes}} between 242Cm and 248Cm, {{as well as}} 250Cm, {{undergo a}} self-sustaining nuclear chain reaction and thus in principle {{can act as a}} nuclear fuel in a reactor. As in most transuranic elements, the nuclear fission cross section is especially high for the odd-mass curium isotopes 243Cm, 245Cm and 247Cm. These can be used in thermal-neutron reactors, whereas a mixture of curium isotopes is only suitable for <b>fast</b> <b>breeder</b> reactors since the even-mass isotopes are not fissile in a thermal reactor and accumulate as burn-up increases. The mixed-oxide (MOX) fuel, which is to be used in power reactors, should contain little or no curium because the neutron activation of 248Cm will create californium. This is strong neutron emitter, and would pollute the back end of the fuel cycle and increase the dose to reactor personnel. Hence, if the minor actinides are to be used as fuel in a thermal neutron reactor, the curium should be excluded from the fuel or placed in special fuel rods where it is the only actinide present.|$|E
25|$|The {{design of}} the country's first <b>fast</b> <b>breeder,</b> called Prototype <b>Fast</b> <b>Breeder</b> Reactor (PFBR), was done by Indira Gandhi Centre for Atomic Research (IGCAR).

This discussion leads to an inquiry by a commission of the Bundestag. Building is interrupted for 4 years as the commission concludes that {{the safety of the}} facility needs to be upgraded in light of the difficult to control process of <b>fast</b> <b>breeders,</b> along with concerns about the coolant (sodium, which, when brought into contact with water, explodes). The interruption along with the redesign of the safety features raise the costs of the project significantly. The local state government (= the government of North Rhine-Westphalia) turns against the project.|$|R
2500|$|According to the Chairman of India’s Atomic Energy Commission, Srikumar Banerjee, {{without the}} {{implementation}} of <b>fast</b> <b>breeders</b> the presently available uranium reserves of 5.469 million tonnes can support 570 GWe till 2025. If the total identified and undiscovered uranium reserves of 16 million tonnes are brought online, the power availability can be extended {{till the end of}} the century. While calling for more research into thorium as an energy source and the country’s indigenous three-stage programme, he said, [...] "The world always felt there would be a miracle. Unfortunately, we have not seen any miracle for the last 40 years. Unless we wake up, humans won't be able to exist beyond this century." ...|$|R

25|$|India is also {{planning}} to build <b>fast</b> <b>breeder</b> reactors using the thorium – Uranium-233 fuel cycle. The FBTR (<b>Fast</b> <b>Breeder</b> Test Reactor) in operation at Kalpakkam (India) uses Plutonium as a fuel and liquid sodium as a coolant.|$|E

40|$|Abstract: Electro {{magnetic}} (EM) {{pumps are}} used in auxiliary circuits of liquid metal cooled <b>fast</b> <b>breeders</b> to pump liquid sodium. There {{is a need to}} develop these sensitive items indigenously. The pumps work on the principle of electro magnetic induction. During operation heat generation takes place in the coil windings and laminations. Heat is also transferred to the coils from the hot sodium. The coils are covered with varnish insulation whose temperature should not cross 1800 C. To limit this temperature, forced air is blown over the coils. Thermal analysis has been done using the HEATING 5 code.

Comparisons between analytical results and experimental results show that SIMMER-III can well simulate the pressure transients and the particle bed axial height change in the first moment of the nitrogen gas expansion, while giving an earlier second pressure peak value than experiments. The simulation somewhat underestimates the gas volume change in the pressure vessel and the water pool.

40|$|The recent civil nuclear {{cooperation}} {{proposed by the}} Bush Administration and the Government of India has heightened the necessity of assessing India?s nuclear fuel cycle inclusive of nuclear materials and facilities. This agreement proposes to change the long-standing U. S. policy of preventing {{the spread of nuclear}} weapons by denying nuclear technology transfer to non-NPT signatory states. The nuclear tests in 1998 have convinced the world community that India would never relinquish its nuclear arsenal. This has driven the desire to engage India through civilian {{nuclear cooperation}}. The cornerstone of any civilian nuclear technological support necessitates the separation of military and civilian facilities. A complete nuclear fuel cycle assessment of India emphasizes the entwinment of the military and civilian facilities and would aid in moving forward with the separation plan. To estimate the existing uranium reserves in India, a complete historical assessment of ore production, conversion, and processing capabilities was performed using open source information and compared to independent reports. Nuclear energy and plutonium production (reactor- and weapons-grade) was simulated using declared capacity factors and modern simulation tools. The three-stage nuclear power program entities and all the components of civilian and military significance were assembled into a flowsheet to allow for a macroscopic vision of the Indian fuel cycle. A detailed view of the nuclear fuel cycle opens avenues for technological collaboration. The fuel cycle that grows from this study exploits domestic thorium reserves with advanced international technology and optimized for the existing system. To utilize any appreciable fraction of the world?s supply of thorium, nuclear breeding is necessary. The two known possibilities for production of more fissionable material in the reactor than is consumed as fuel are <b>fast</b> <b>breeders</b> or thermal breeders. This dissertation analyzes a thermal breeder core concept involving the CANDU core design. The end-oflife fuel characteristics evolved from the designed fuel composition is proliferation resistant and economical in integrating this technology into the Indian nuclear fuel cycle. Furthermore, it is shown that the separation of the military and civilian components of the Indian fuel cycle can be facilitated through the implementation of such a system...|$|R
