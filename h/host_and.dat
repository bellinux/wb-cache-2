40|$|This {{current study}} focuses on {{exploring}} expectations of World Wide Opportunities on Organic Farming (WWOOF) <b>hosts</b> <b>and</b> volunteers participating in various countries using online semi-structured interview method. Using psychological contract theory, motivation is discovered as playing {{an important role}} in the formation of expectations of 27 <b>hosts</b> <b>and</b> 20 volunteers. When comparing motivation of both groups, they display contrast, similarity and complementarity. Expectations as contents of the psychological contract of <b>hosts</b> <b>and</b> volunteers are both transactional and relational in nature. The transactional aspect include work, food, accommodation and learning opportunities while the relational aspect involve social life and cultural exchange. Both <b>hosts</b> <b>and</b> volunteers view communication as mutual obligation and one of the main challenges of their exchange relationship. The psychological contract of <b>hosts</b> <b>and</b> volunteers include their relationship with their respective WWOOF organizations. Communication from these organizations influences the formation of expectations of <b>hosts</b> <b>and</b> volunteers. Finally, all <b>hosts</b> <b>and</b> volunteers who were motivated to continue cited the benefits they gained from the woofing experience in the form of met expectations and unexpected positive outcomes. In contrast, perceived breach and violation of their psychological contract as described through self-reported accounts may lead to shortening of <b>hosting</b> <b>and</b> early withdrawal from volunteering. Hosts respond to violation of contract by requesting their volunteers to leave...|$|R

In 2009, Catalyst Investors sold the company’s shared <b>hosting</b> <b>and</b> domains business to Deluxe Corporation, which allowed Codero to refocus its business around dedicated <b>hosting,</b> <b>and</b> managed <b>hosting.</b> On July 31, 2009, the company officially re-branded itself as Codero.|$|R
5|$|Brood {{parasitism}} demonstrates close coevolution of <b>host</b> <b>and</b> parasite, {{for example}} in cuckoos. These birds do not make their own nests, but lay their eggs in nests of other species, ejecting or killing the eggs and young of the <b>host</b> <b>and</b> thus having a strong {{negative impact on the}} host's reproductive fitness. Their eggs are camouflaged as eggs of their hosts, implying that hosts can distinguish their own eggs from those of intruders and are in an evolutionary arms race with the cuckoo between camouflage and recognition. Cuckoos are counter-adapted to host defences with features such as thickened eggshells, shorter incubation (so their young hatch first), and flat backs adapted to lift eggs out of the nest.|$|E
5|$|Confessions of a Dangerous Mind is a 2002 biographical spy comedy film {{depicting}} {{the life of}} popular game show <b>host</b> <b>and</b> producer Chuck Barris, {{who claimed to have}} also been an assassin for the CIA.

5|$|Ecological {{interactions}} can {{be classified}} broadly into a <b>host</b> <b>and</b> an associate relationship. A host is any entity that harbours another that is called the associate. Relationships within a species that are mutually or reciprocally beneficial are called mutualisms. Examples of mutualism include fungus-growing ants employing agricultural symbiosis, bacteria living in the guts of insects and other organisms, the fig wasp and yucca moth pollination complex, lichens with fungi and photosynthetic algae, and corals with photosynthetic algae. If there is a physical connection between <b>host</b> <b>and</b> associate, the relationship is called symbiosis. Approximately 60% of all plants, for example, have a symbiotic relationship with arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi living in their roots forming an exchange network of carbohydrates for mineral nutrients.|$|E
40|$|AbstractThe mutual gaze enacts both <b>hosts</b> <b>and</b> guests. This paper {{expands the}} {{literature}} {{relating to the}} impact perspective of backpacker tourism. It investigates how <b>hosts</b> <b>and</b> backpackers perceive the socio-cultural impacts of backpacker tourism on local communities in less-developed countries; specifically the Yasawa Islands of Fiji. The discussion is based on data collected via surveys {{and a series of}} interview with <b>hosts</b> <b>and</b> backpackers in 2011. The results suggest that <b>hosts</b> <b>and</b> backpackers significantly perceived the socio-cultural impacts of backpacker tourism differently. While backpackers are generally neutral in their perceptions regarding their own impacts on the destination, the hosts are notably more aware. This knowledge is fruitful as it can inform destination policymakers in their deliberation on further sustainable tourism practices...|$|R

5|$|A {{cattle egret}} will weakly defend {{the area around}} a grazing animal against others of the same species, but if the area is swamped by egrets it will give up and {{continue}} foraging elsewhere. Where numerous large animals are present, cattle egrets selectively forage around species that move at around 5–15steps per minute, avoiding faster and slower moving herds; in Africa, cattle egrets selectively forage behind plains zebras, waterbuck, blue wildebeest and Cape buffalo. Dominant birds feed nearest to the <b>host,</b> <b>and</b> obtain more food.|$|E
