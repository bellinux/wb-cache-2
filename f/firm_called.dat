We find no evidence that <b>calling</b> <b>firms</b> underperform non-calling benchmark firms. On the contrary, we find mild evidence that the post-call operating performance of <b>calling</b> <b>firms</b> is better than a carefully selected group of benchmark <b>firms</b> and <b>call</b> firms' post-call stock returns are no worse than benchmark firms.
