30|$|The 1994 Ethiopian census is also {{problematic}} {{with respect}} to the demographic visibility of pastoralists. The whole country was censused in 1994, including nomadic populations, except the nomadic populations of Afar and Somalie regions - the two regions where the pastoralists dominate; the sedentary and urban populations of these two regions were censused with everyone else. The nomadic populations were to be censused in 1995 to 1996, and there is indirect evidence that this was done from an Italian report (Bielli et al. 2001). Although the regional-level reports indicate that all the results in those two regions collected in 1994 were problematic, and the whole regions were resurveyed in 1996, it has proved totally impossible to find any reports or any <b>numbers</b> of the <b>nomads</b> in these two zones. The published regional reports only have the data collected in 1994, which <b>exclude</b> these <b>nomad</b> populations. Even the Integrated Public Use Microdata Series (IPUMS) database in Minnesota has been unable to identify the data from this nomad data collection exercise (Robert McCaa personal communication).|$|R

The Turkic speaking Uyghurs were one of many distinct cultural groups brought together by the trade of the Silk Route at Turfan, which was then ruled by China's Tang Dynasty. The Uyghurs, primarily pastoral <b>nomads,</b> observed a <b>number</b> of religions including Manichaeism, Buddhism, and Nestorian Christianity.

40|$|The NuTeV Collaboration has {{observed}} an excess in their di-muon channel, possibly corresponding to a long-lived neutral particle with only weak interactions and which decays to muon pairs. We {{show that this}} can not be explained by pair production of neutralinos in the target followed by their decay far downstream in the detector via a LLE R-parity violating (RPV) operator, as suggested in the literature. In the parameter region allowed by LEP the event rate is far too small. We propose instead a new neutralino production method via B-mesons, which can fully explain the observation. This is analogous to neutrino production via -mesons. This model can be completely tested and thus also possibly <b>excluded</b> with <b>NOMAD</b> data. If it is excluded, the NuTeV observation is most likely not due to physics beyond the Standard Model. Our model can also be tested at the current and future B-factories. This opens up a new way of testing a long-lived neutralino LSP at fixed-target experiments and thus a possibility to close the gap between collider and cosmological tests of R-parity violation. We also discuss a possible explanation in terms of a neutral heavy lepton mixing with the Standard Model neutrinos. The flavour structure of the observation can be accounted for but the production rate is far too low...|$|R

The second most frequent language is Pashtu, spoken by the majorities in 266 villages representing 27% of the population, followed by Turkmani (11.9%) and Uzbeki (10.7%).Balkh province also has a population of Kuchis or <b>nomads</b> whose <b>numbers</b> vary in different seasons. In winter 52,929 individuals, or 2.2% of the overall Kuchi population, stay in Balkh living in 80 communities.

Overall, for long and short range migratory categories, {{less than half of the}} community migrates. In the winter both groups stay mostly in one area and don’t move around during the season. In the summer season, some 120 long range migratory Kuchi households come from Saripul province to Balkh province. The Kuchi population in the summer is 59,776 individuals.|$|R

40|$|A {{neutrino}} {{mass that}} would make a significant contribution to the hidden mass of the universe and thus contribute to the solving of the dark matter puzzle is still the most valuable prize in neutrino physics. This would presumably be through a mixed dark matter scenario and would involve a neutrino mass of 1 - 2 eV. Assuming the Delta m/sup 2 / observed in neutrino oscillations is the difference between this mass and a negligible mass of a second neutrino, CHORUS and NOMAD would only have a sensitivity of sin/sup 2 / 2 theta ~ 10 /sup - 3 / in this domain. The aim of future nu /sub mu /- nu /sub tau / oscillation searches is therefore to improve the sensitivity of the search by about an order of magnitude. <b>NOMAD</b> has a <b>number</b> of events looking exactly like a nu /sub tau / interaction should but, in spite of the good kinematical capabilities of the experiment, the number of such events is consistent with the number of expected background events. Therefore to improve on this situation it is imperative to be able to determine whether the tau decay daughter candidate originates from a secondary vertex located at a distance ~ 1 mm from the primary vertex. In short the topology capabilities of CHORUS must be combined with the kinematical capabilities of NOMAD. This is the strategy of TOSCA and, until it was withdrawn earlier this year, of COSMOS.

5000|$|Design flaw of the {{aircraft}} [...] - [...] This is the second Nomad aircraft crash following the first crash on 3 October 1973 when {{the aircraft}} was leased to Royal Australian Air Force (RAAF) as A18-002 in July 1973. The 3rd Nomad aircraft crash occurred on 6 August 1976 during a test flight at Avalon Airport, Australia, exactly 2 months after the Malaysian Double Six Crash. In November 1995, 20 years after the Double Six Crash, the Four Corners TV series of the Australian Broadcasting Corporation (ABC), which is noted for its investigative exposés, ran a programme {{on the dangers of}} Nomad aircraft which had been suppressed over the years. At the time when the programme was broadcast, there were a total of 19 Nomad accidents with 56 deaths. It was the aircraft crash flown by Glen Donovan on 12 March 1990 that caused a mutiny among Australian army pilots and the usage of all military Nomads were discontinued after that. Harry Bradford was a former RAAF test pilot. He found controllability issues {{of the aircraft}} especially during its handling on approach and landing. However, his reports were being suppressed because it could harm the reputation GAF and Australian national interests. A former GAF design engineer, Paul Hughes, bought 16 Nomad aircraft through his own corporation. However, soon after that, he filed a legal suit against <b>Nomad</b> for a <b>number</b> of aircraft defects such as a defective tail design and maximum weight limit that the aircraft can carry which was far lower than advertised weight limit. The Australian government finally paid A$ 4 million to Hughes Corporation. Hughes then disposed of 15 out of 16 aircraft that he had bought. Tun Fuad's family now believed that the aircraft faulty design is a more likely cause of the Double Six Crash.|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{explores the}} {{published}} work of Tierno Monénembo, Guinean author born in 1947. The main themes are space and narrative, and precisely how subjects creatively employ both. The thesis argues that Monénembo presents a reconfiguration of African subjecthood by centralising nomad subjects: characters who are wily débrouillards, ever {{on the move}} and ready to (re) invent both space and self. In a series of postcolonial rewritings, Monénembo reframes subjects beyond notions of race or victimhood. Their practices of invention are grounded in contexts rendered precarious and unstable by chains of violence and multiple losses, and the author represents these spaces in innovative language in several genres. Mobility, or its absence, determines the themes, characterisation, and language in each of Monénembo’s texts. It is addressed here via a number of contexts which position him within ongoing debates around historicisation, identity, and power in the postcolonial world. Chapter One looks at imperialism and the re-writing of history via Le Roi de Kahel and Peuls. In Chapter Two I explore dictatorship and the conflicting discourses which vie for space around it: the texts under examination are Les Crapauds-brousse and Les Écailles du ciel. In Chapter Three I discuss writing after genocide and other trauma. In comparing L’Aîné des orphelins to Cinéma and La Tribu des gonzesses I find common trends of performative storytelling which mark out Monénembo’s protagonists as self-inventing survivors. The final main chapter groups together four exile texts to assess the effects of rupture and loss on language and space. Reading Un Rêve utile, Un Attiéké pour Elgass, Pelourinho and Le Terroriste noir reveals the creative agency at work in Monénembo’s dislocated <b>nomad</b> subjects. A <b>number</b> of theoretical anchor points help to frame these studies and for these I draw {{on the work of}} Michel de Certeau, Achille Mbembe, and Patrice Nganang, among others. The thesis is concluded with a look at Monénembo in his own words as I draw together my predominant observations alongside his autobiographical comments. ...|$|R
