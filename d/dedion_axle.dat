5000|$|In a front engine, {{rear-drive}} vehicle, dependent {{rear suspension}} is either [...] "live axle" [...] or <b>deDion</b> <b>axle,</b> {{depending on whether}} or not the differential is carried on the axle. Live axle is simpler but the unsprung weight contributes to wheel bounce.|$|E
5000|$|Independent {{suspension}} {{is a broad}} {{term for}} any automobile suspension system that allows each wheel on the same axle to move vertically (i.e. reacting to a bump in the road) independently of the others. This is contrasted with a beam axle or <b>deDion</b> <b>axle</b> {{system in which the}} wheels are linked - movement on one side affects the wheel on the other side. [...] "Independent" [...] refers to the motion or path of movement of the wheels or suspension. It is common for the left and right sides of the suspension to be connected with anti-roll bars or other such mechanisms. The anti-roll bar ties the left and right suspension spring rates together but does not tie their motion together.|$|E
40|$|The sponsor, EV Grid Inc. is {{a company}} {{looking to the future}} with the {{development}} of a vehicle to grid infrastructure. The vehicle in development is a Ford E- 250 Van which had been converted to electric drive with a front motor, rear drive layout. The sponsor wanted to move the electric motor to the rear and develop an axle to support this change. By eliminating the driveshaft, a more efficient use of battery space could be utilized. The goal of this project is to design and fabricate a prototype deDion rear axle which incorporates a system of drive components that are both relatively easy to manufacture and service. The original axle loading was analyzed to determine the necessary strength and fatigue properties of the new axle using Modified-Goodman and Miners criterion. When the calculations were finished, the design was finalized and moved into the manufacturing stage. All of the individual parts for the axle were fabricated at Cal Poly and then delivered to EV Grid in order to be welded together. The completed <b>deDion</b> <b>axle,</b> which replaced the solid rear axle, reduced the unsprung weight, used commercially available driving components and can be quickly installed into the vehicle...|$|E
50|$|Walter Snow Fighter plow trucks {{produced}} by the Walter Truck Company of Long Island, New York throughout the mid 20th century used <b>DeDion</b> <b>axles</b> with portal gear hubs for both the front and the rear suspension, allowing the use of large differentials for durability without increasing unsprung weight or reducing ground clearance. Forged steel axles were used instead of tubes.|$|R
