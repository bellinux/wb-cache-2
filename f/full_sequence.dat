5|$|When {{approaching}} investors {{prior to}} filming, Six {{did not mention}} the mouth-to-anus aspect of the plot, fearing it would put off potential backers. The financiers of The Human Centipede did not discover the full nature of the film until it was complete. The film received generally mixed reviews from mainstream film critics, but it won several accolades at international film festivals. The film was released in the United States on a limited theatrical release on 30 April 2010. A sequel, entitled <b>Full</b> <b>Sequence,</b> also written and directed by Six, was released in 2011.|$|E
5|$|The {{director}} of the episode, Cliff Bole, was a school friend of makeup supervisor Michael Westmore. The scene with Remmick {{at the end of}} the episode was added in post-production, as it was originally scripted to have Riker and Picard come face to face with a full-sized mother creature. The part where the parasite enters Remmick's throat reportedly took many takes because the bulging effect was made by Westmore blowing into air bladders under a false neck, and Bole kept trying to make Westmore hyperventilate from the exertion. The parasites themselves were created by Makeup & Effects Laboratories from a design by Rick Sternbach. A mold of Paul Newman's face was filled with raw meat and then blown up to create the effect used when Picard and Riker fire on Remmick, but both Rick Berman and Peter Lauritson were concerned that it was too graphic. Dan Curry invited his six-year-old son to watch the episode in order to test how children would react to it; the boy reportedly liked it so much that he suggested the creation of a Remmick action figure whose head would blow up by pressing a button. This resulted in Berman deciding to air the episode uncut with the <b>full</b> <b>sequence</b> included.|$|E

25|$|At {{the close}} of the decade, The Human Centipede (First Sequence) (2009) and A Serbian Film (2010) were among the most notable torture porn releases; {{although}} not as financially successful as Saw or Hostel, A Serbian Film and The Human Centipede II (<b>Full</b> <b>Sequence)</b> (2011) gained attention in the press for their graphic depictions of forced fecal consumption and necrophilia, and both films were censored in order to attain release in the U.K. Other torture porn films such as Grotesque and The Bunny Game were banned outright by the BBFC.|$|E

The material varies from year to year; currently, it covers a sweeping introduction to three cornerstones of Mathematics, namely, Linear Algebra, Abstract Algebra, and Real Analysis. Vector spaces, linear operators, groups, fields and rings, and the topological underpinnings of Calculus are also covered. Emphasis is placed on rigor and proof.|$|E
25|$|Several {{algorithms}} {{dealing with}} aspects of PCFG based probabilistic models in RNA structure prediction exist. For instance the inside-outside algorithm and the CYK algorithm. The inside-outside algorithm is a recursive dynamic programming scoring algorithm that can follow expectation-maximization paradigms. It computes the total probability of all derivations {{that are consistent}} with a given sequence, based on some PCFG. The inside part scores the subtrees from a parse tree and therefore subsequences probabilities given an PCFG. The outside part scores the probability of the complete parse tree for a <b>full</b> <b>sequence.</b> CYK modifies the inside-outside scoring. Note that the term 'CYK algorithm' describes the CYK variant of the inside algorithm that finds an optimal parse tree for a sequence using a PCFG. It extends the actual CYK algorithm used in non-probabilistic CFGs.|$|E

25|$|For recent genealogy, exact {{matching}} on the mtDNA <b>full</b> <b>sequence</b> is used {{to confirm}} a common ancestor on the direct maternal line between two suspected relatives. Because mtDNA mutations are very rare, a nearly perfect match is not usually considered relevant {{to the most recent}} 1 to 16 generations. In cultures lacking matrilineal surnames to pass down, neither relative above is likely to have as many generations of ancestors in their matrilineal information table as in the above patrilineal or Y-DNA case: for further information on this difficulty in traditional genealogy, due to lack of matrilineal surnames (or matrinames), see Matriname. However, the foundation of testing is still two suspected descendants of one person. This hypothesize and test DNA pattern is the same one used for autosomal DNA and Y-DNA.|$|E
500|$|The {{third and}} final film in the trilogy, The Human Centipede 3 (Final Sequence), {{received}} a limited theatrical release on 22 May 2015. The film features the largest human centipede in the series, composed of five hundred victims, as Six says [...] "each film is {{a reaction to the}} other. And the film got so big, it was a pop culture phenomenon, and people wanted more: a bigger centipede, helicopters and things… it had to be bigger and bigger. And what I did, I used the idea and almost made a parody on the human centipede films itself." [...] As <b>Full</b> <b>Sequence</b> was intended to make First Sequence look like My Little Pony in comparison, Final Sequence was intended to make <b>Full</b> <b>Sequence</b> resemble a Disney film. The movie features the tag-line [...] "100% Politically Incorrect". Both Dieter Laser and <b>Full</b> <b>Sequence</b> star Laurence R. Harvey returned in starring, albeit different, roles.|$|E

[...] Yennie stated at the May 2010 Weekend of Horrors that the sequel would contain [...] "the blood and shit" [...] that viewers did not see in the first film.

500|$|The plot of <b>Full</b> <b>Sequence</b> {{involves}} {{a man who}} after becoming sexually obsessed with a DVD recording of First Sequence decides to create his own human centipede. The film had been planned for a DVD release in the United Kingdom. However, upon submitting the film to the BBFC for classification, the film was rejected due to content that was [...] "sexually violent and potentially obscene". The BBFC's report criticised the film as making [...] "little attempt to portray any of the victims in the film {{as anything other than}} objects to be brutalised, degraded and mutilated for the amusement and arousal of the central character, {{as well as for the}} pleasure of the audience" [...] and that the film was potentially in breach of the Obscene Publications Act, meaning its distribution in the UK would be illegal. Bounty Films, the UK distributor, appealed the decision, and the film was eventually passed with an 18 certificate in October 2011. To achieve the 18 rating, thirty-two cuts were made from the film, removing two minutes and thirty-seven seconds from the original version.|$|E
