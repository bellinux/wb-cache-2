30|$|A {{value of}} 0.2 was added when <b>fitting</b> the <b>diameter</b> {{increment}} to accommodate negative or zero increments (common in tropical forests) and enable the logarithmic transformation of null and negative values, because omitting these observations would have introduced bias {{and resulted in}} overestimates of the diameter increment (Vanclay 1991 a).

40|$|Abstract: The {{method and}} devices for {{absolute}} volume measurements of 1 kg silicon spheres are described. An interferometer {{equipped with a}} direct optical frequency tuning system is {{used to measure the}} sphere volume, in which the optical frequency of a diode laser can be tuned continuously over a frequency range of 19 GHz. Accurate frequency changes in the laser produced by this system are used to measure the sphere diameters by phase-shifting interferometry. A total of seventy diameters, which are distributed near-uniformly over the surface of the sphere, are measured in vacuum. The volume of the sphere is determined by <b>fitting</b> the <b>diameters</b> to a series of spherical harmonics. The mass of the sphere is compared with that of the national prototype of the kilogram through a secondary 1 kg standard.

The magnetization {{data obtained by}} using a SQUID magnetometer show the NPs as a superparamagnet in terms of anhysteretic curves near room temperature. Unoverlaping of the scaled M(H-ext, T) /M-s vs. H-ext, T plots and the dc susceptibility obeying the Curie-Weiss behavior rather than the Curie law at high temperatures provide evidence that the NPs are interacting superparamagnetic ensembles. A mean-field correction to the Langevin function L ([H-ext + alpha M]/k(B) T) worked well for the magnetic ordering of the NPs. By means of the Langevin <b>fitting,</b> the <b>diameter</b> of the NP {{was estimated to be}} lower than 15 nm, depending oil the milling time.

First, using molecular dynamics {{data from the}} literature and also from our own study, a representative correlation of the viscosity of a Lennard-Jones fluid is developed {{for a wide range}} of thermodynamic states. Second, a corresponding states scheme is proposed which allows the transposition of the previous results to real fluids.

For larger molecules, the results are poorer but can be strongly improved by <b>fitting</b> the atomic <b>diameter.</b> Then, it is shown for simple binary and multicomponent mixtures that, by using merely a van der Waals one-fluid approximation and the Lorentz-Berthelot rules, results are as good as for pure fluids.

40|$|A Doctoral Thesis. Submitted in partial {{fulfilment}} of {{the requirements}} for the award of Doctor of Philosophy of Loughborough University. British Gas have been using polyethylene pipe and fittings for gas distribution since 1969. The medium density, and more recently high density polyethylene pipes are produced by a simple and well established extrusion process. Unfortunately the production of <b>fittings,</b> especially large <b>diameter</b> <b>fittings</b> is not so simple. Traditionally pipe fittings are made from either injection moulding or by other fabrication techniques which require subsequent cutting and welding of different parts to produce the finished article. Recently however the methodology has been developed to facilitate the production of fittings by rotational moulding. Incorporated into the new methodology {{is the ability to}} produce crosslinked fittings by peroxide inclusion. Crosslinking of the pipe fittings has a major advantage in that it produces a substantial improvement in the mechanical properties of the polymer. Of particular importance is the improvement in stress crack resistance. Stress cracking is presently the primary mode of failure in polyethylene pipelines. Cross linking should help to reduce the susceptibility of the pipeline to failure by this method. The purpose of this project has been to investigate the crosslinking process in two rotational moulding grades of polyethylene. In particular a study has been made of the relationships between various chemical and physical properties, and of how these change upon material modification. A series of compression moulded samples containing increasing levels of peroxide have been produced for both polymers. Characterisation of these samples was undertaken using such techniques as Differential Thermal Analysis, Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy, Gel Permeation Chromatography, Gel Content and Microscopy. The results have shown that as peroxide concentration is increased gel content rises sharply before reaching a maximum value. In contrast to the gel content, the crystallinity of the samples was shown to decrease. Infrared analysis provided the facility to monitor the variation in molecule end group concentration with changing peroxide levels. It was found that increasing the level of peroxide resulted in a decrease in the concentration of terminal vinyl unsaturation in an inverse relationship to gel content results. Subsequent gel permeation chromatography analysis demonstrated that the terminal vinyl groups were being lost in a chain extension mechanism which resulted in an increase in the molecular weight of the samples...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. Steel {{conveying}} rollers used in {{hot rolling}} mills must be exchanged very frequently at great cost because hot conveyed strips induce wear {{on the surface}} of roller in short periods. In this study, new roller structure is considered which has a ceramics sleeve connected with two short steel shafts at both ends by shrink fitting. Here, the ceramics sleeve may provide longer life and reduces the cost for the maintenance. However, sometimes the steel shaft has to be pulled out for exchange. Simply, heating outside surface and cooling inside surface of the shaft are necessary for separation. However, attention should be paid to the maximum thermal stress of the ceramics sleeve in the process of separation. In this paper, finite element method analysis is applied to the structure and thermal stress has been calculated with the varying dimensions of the structure. Also several effects on thermal stress have been investigated, such as the effect of shrink <b>fitting</b> ratio, outside <b>diameter,</b> the fitted length, thickness of shaft, materials an so on. Finally the most appropriate thermal conditions to reduce maximum stress and make separation easy have been discussed, which is very useful for designing of new rollers...|$|R

40|$|The {{diameter}} and height growth model {{is one of}} three submodels used for simulating individual tree growth.

Tree <b>diameter</b> and height data were obtained from 48 permanent plots of unthinned stands of Eucalyptus grandis × Eucalyptus urophylla hybrid located in northern Brazil. The evaluation of the diameter and height growth models was based on adjusted coefficient of determination, standard error of estimate as a percentage, trend, root mean square error and Akaike Information Criterion. Analysis also included distribution of residual percentage, statistical significance and signs of the coefficients. The Lundqvist-Korf model provided the most accurate estimates for diameter and height growth, in comparison with the other models, providing better statistical values, greater proximity to observed values and better distribution of residual percentages. The use of this type of model is feasible and can result in significant improvements in the accuracy of yield estimates...|$|R
50|$|The brothers' {{involvement}} in the support for the screw propellor was significant, as the British Admiralty was reluctant to change away from paddle wheels, believing the pitching of a ship would lift the propellor clear {{of the water in}} heavy seas causing the engine stress and rendering the vessel hard to control. Francis Pettit Smith and Captain John Ericsson had been trying to demonstrate the potential of the propellor for five years, and eventually it was Smith who formed a company to finance the building of the Archimedes (107 ft length) fitted with a Rennie single cylinder engine and 5 ft 9in screw propellor. It was her successful trials that began in 1839 that led to the admiralty purchasing the Mermaid in 1842 (130 ft length), which was built and engined by Rennie, and fitted with the Rennie's patent propellor of 5 ft 8in diameter. This was followed by the Admiralty <b>fitting</b> a 10-foot <b>diameter</b> Smith's propellor to the unfinished sailing sloop Ardent, which was launched in April 1843 renamed HMS Rattler. The Archimedes was also loaned to Brunel and resulted in him changing the design of the SS Great Britain to screw propulsion, even though the paddle wheels were part constructed, setting back the project by 9 months.|$|R
40|$|This work proposes the {{detection}} of red peaches in orchard images based on the definition of different linear color models in the RGB vector color space. The classification and segmentation of the pixels of the image is then performed by comparing the color distance from each pixel to the different previously defined linear color models.

The peach variety in the orchard was the paraguayo (Prunus persica var. platycarpa) peach with red skin. The segmentation {{results showed that the}} area of the red peaches in the images was detected with an average error of 11. 6 %; 19. 7 % in the case of bright illumination; 8. 2 % in the case of low illumination; 8. 6 % for occlusion up to 33 %; 12. 2 % in the case of occlusion between 34 and 66 %; and 23 % for occlusion above 66 %. Finally, a methodology was proposed to estimate the diameter of the fruits based on an ellipsoidal <b>fitting.</b> A first <b>diameter</b> was obtained by using all the contour pixels and a second diameter was obtained by rejecting some pixels of the contour.

40|$|Tubuloglomerular {{feedback}} (TGF) and the myogenic mechanism control afferent arteriolar diameter in each nephron {{and regulate}} blood flow. Both mechanisms generate self-sustained oscillations, the oscillations interact, TGF modulates {{the frequency and}} amplitude of the myogenic oscillation, and the oscillations synchronize; a 5 : 1 frequency ratio is the most frequent. TGF oscillations synchronize in nephron pairs supplied from a common cortical radial artery, as do myogenic oscillations. We propose that electrotonic vascular signal propagation from one juxtaglomerular apparatus interacts with similar signals from other nephrons to produce synchronization. We tested this idea in tubular-vascular preparations from mice. Vascular smooth muscle cells were loaded with a fluorescent voltage-sensitive dye; fluorescence intensity was measured with confocal microscopy. Perfusion of the thick ascending limb activated TGF and depolarized afferent arteriolar smooth muscle cells. The depolarization spread to the cortical radial artery and other afferent arterioles and declined with distance from the perfused juxtaglomerular apparatus, consistent with electrotonic vascular signal propagation. With a mathematical model of two coupled nephrons, we estimated the conductance of nephron coupling by <b>fitting</b> simulated vessel <b>diameters</b> to experimental data. With this value, we simulated nephron pairs to test for synchronization. In single-nephron simulations, {{the frequency of the}} TGF oscillation varied with nephron length. Coupling nephrons of different lengths forced TGF frequencies of both pair members to converge to a common value. The myogenic oscillations also synchronized, and the synchronization between the TGF and the myogenic oscillations showed an increased stability against parameter perturbations. Electronic vascular signal propagation is a plausible mechanism for nephron synchronization. Coupling increased the stability of the various oscillations...|$|R

METHODS:: Eighty-eight eyes were included in the study, divided into three groups: healthy (A 0, 28 eyes), keratoconus at stage I according to the Amsler-Krumeich classification (AI, 33 eyes) and keratoconus at stages II to IV (AII, 27 eyes). The Pentacam Scheimpflug system was used to manually measure the corneal peripheral angles corresponding to a chord length range between 8. 6 and 12. 6 mm at 8 different peripheral locations. RESULTS:: The peripheral angle was influenced by ocular condition and by the peripheral location, with no interaction effect between both factors. Statistically significant differences were found in mean corneal peripheral angles between groups A 0 (30. 84 °± 2. 33 °) and AI (31. 63 °± 2. 02 °) (P= 0. 001) and between A 0 and AII (31. 37 °± 2. 11 °) (P= 0. 030). The differences between AI and AII were not significant. In all eyes, the largest and smallest peripheral angles were found at the temporal inferior and temporal superior locations, respectively, with a mean difference between largest and smallest of 3. 37 °± 1. 42 ° in healthy eyes and 2. 96 °± 1. 54 ° in keratoconus (AI+AII).

Detailed breakdown of key factors contributing to the damage to buried pipes is given with reference to the above and other relevant parameters. Particular attention is given to the interpretation, analysis and modelling of liquefaction effects on the damage and performance of the buried pipe networks. Clear link between liquefaction severity and damage rate for the pipeline has been observed with an increasing damage rate seen with increasing liquefaction severity. The approach taken here was to correlate the pipeline damage to LRI (Liquefaction Resistance Index, newly developed parameter in Cubrinovski et al., 2011) which represents a direct measure for the soil resistance to liquefaction while accounting for the seismic demand through PGA. Key quality of the adopted approach is that it provides a general methodology that in conjunction with conventional methods for liquefaction evaluation can be applied elsewhere in New Zealand and internationally. Preliminary correlations between pipeline damage (breaks km- 1), liquefaction resistance (LRI) and seismic demand (PGA) have been developed for AC pipes, as an example. Such correlations can be directly used in the design and assessment of pipes in seismic areas both in liquefiable and non-liquefiable areas.
