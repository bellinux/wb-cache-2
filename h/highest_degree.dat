While the mainstream view is that the Song court exercised the <b>highest</b> <b>degree</b> of restraint and courtesy towards civil officials, the new protocol of enhanced deferential treatment by officials towards the emperor during conferences and meetings further eroded the emperor's close contact with his ministers.|$|E

Some Australian university course descriptions stress that the exegesis is "related to", "linked to" or "integrated with" the creative work, while others propose a more "reflective" role. Still others nominate that the exegesis will "describe", "elaborate", "elucidate", "examine" and/or "contextualise" the creative work, all of which suggest varying temporal relations between the two usual parts of the creative writing research degree.

The role of a counselling-trained mentor is one that combines elements of counselling, mentoring, organisational and social support for both <b>higher</b> <b>degree</b> research students and supervisors.

40|$|What distinguishes {{effective}} <b>higher</b> <b>degree</b> supervision {{in research}} fields of education? What are the strategies commonly employed by <b>higher</b> <b>degree</b> supervisors in these fields? Which strategies best {{meet the needs}} of education students during candidature? These questions are important because they concern the special features of <b>higher</b> <b>degree</b> study in the diverse and dynamic research fields of education. In this chapter, the authors address these questions by drawing upon the views of experienced supervisors in education and by framing these views within the context of disciplinary diversity. A key argument in the chapter is that <b>higher</b> <b>degree</b> supervision is a process that supports the induction of individuals to particular academic disciplines. The authors first examine what students need in order to master disciplinary conventions and norms necessary for successful completion of <b>higher</b> <b>degree</b> studies in the social sciences, including education. They then provide evidence of the strategies used by supervisors in education to meet these needs...|$|R
