5|$|In 1910 Theodore Roosevelt {{visited the}} province. Before his arrival, Governor R.C.R. Owen {{informed}} Governor General Sir Reginald Wingate that <b>everything</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> {{done for the}} former president of the United States, but also pointed out that his troops had not even one donkey.|$|E
5|$|The general {{opinion was}} {{that we were going to}} remain in the ghetto until the end of the war, until the arrival of the Red Army. Then <b>everything</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> as before. It was neither German nor Jew who ruled the ghetto– it was illusion.|$|E
5|$|During the {{two weeks}} leading up to the Grand Prix, Räikkönen and Felipe Massa {{released}} statements to the press saying they believed that <b>everything</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> different in Canada because of the very different conditions—as shown at Paul Ricard. Fernando Alonso believed McLaren had momentum from their win in Monaco, and Martin Whitmarsh said that they were realistic about dominating the race.|$|E
60|$|She promised <b>everything.</b> She <b>would</b> <b>be</b> {{so proud}} {{to tell her}} husband.|$|R
6000|$|... "And, in {{the other}} case, I suppose <b>everything</b> <b>would</b> have <b>been</b> reversed--illegitimacy <b>would</b> have had the extinguisher?" [...] said Deronda, with some scorn.|$|R
5000|$|The {{fact that}} the monsters are costumed criminals, and their mastermind's {{finishing}} sentence that <b>everything</b> <b>would</b> have <b>been</b> fine except [...] "for those meddling guys" [...] is {{a reference to the}} Scooby-Doo franchise.|$|R
5|$|An {{undertaking}} of {{the restoration}} team was that <b>everything</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> handled in a transparent fashion, that reporters, art historians {{and others with}} a bona fide interest should have ready access to information and to view the work. However, a single company, Nippon Television Network Corporation, had sole photography rights. Michael Kimmelman, chief art critic of The New York Times, wrote, in 1991, that the criticism of {{the restoration of the}} ceiling and lunettes was in part fuelled by the Nippon Television Network's reluctance to make public those photographs that they had taken by exclusive right, which had recorded every stage of the process and which were the only solid evidence that the work was being done appropriately.|$|E
5|$|Gierek, like Gomułka in 1956, came {{to power}} on a raft of {{promises}} that <b>everything</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> different from now on: wages would rise, prices would remain stable, there would be freedom of speech, and {{those responsible for the}} violence at Gdynia and elsewhere would be punished. Although Poles were much more skeptical than they had been in 1956, Gierek was believed to be an honest and well-intentioned man, and his promises bought him some time. He used this time to create a new economic program, one based on large-scale borrowing from banks in the West — mainly from the United States and West Germany — to buy technology that would upgrade Poland's production of export goods. This massive borrowing, estimated to have totaled over 24 billion US (1970s) dollars during Gierek's years, was used to re-equip and modernize Polish industry, and to import consumer goods to give the workers more incentive to work.|$|E
25|$|On November 15, 2000, Wojcicki {{failed to}} make payroll for the first pay period of the season, and as such {{defaulted}} ownership of the club to the league. This news was greeted bitterly by the players, who just days early had been repeatedly ensured by the owner himself that <b>everything</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> fine.|$|E
5000|$|... "Authenticity is {{everything}} - without it <b>everything</b> <b>would</b> appear to <b>be</b> {{nothing more than}} a hollow shell." ...|$|R
5000|$|Ari Shavit {{writes of}} Israel's nuclear strategy: [...] "Concerning {{anything}} and <b>everything</b> nuclear, Israel <b>would</b> <b>be</b> much, much more cautious than the United States and NATO. Concerning anything and <b>everything</b> nuclear, Israel <b>would</b> <b>be</b> the responsible adult {{of the international}} community. It would well understand the formidable nature of the demon and keep it locked in the basement".|$|R
6000|$|... "Murder!" [...] echoed her son, looking askance, as if {{dodging the}} bailiffs. [...] "No, mother; I wanted nothing {{but what was}} fair. Mr. Denbigh would have had an equal chance to blow out my brains; I <b>am</b> sure <b>everything</b> <b>would</b> have <b>been</b> fair." ...|$|R
25|$|Beginning in July and {{throughout}} most of the period of the preparation of the libretto, the composer and Strepponi had been in Paris taking care of securing various performance and publication rights, including working on a translated version of Il trovatore, the opera which became Le trouvère. Piave was informed that Verdi's stay would need to be lengthened and <b>everything</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> handled between them and the Venetian authorities by mail.|$|E
25|$|Track staff worked {{overnight}} {{to fix the}} barriers, and to {{make sure}} <b>everything</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> fixed in time for qualifying on Saturday, some of the teams sent out mechanics to help. The drivers, though, still were not convinced, but the race organizers threatened legal action if no race was run. This, and rumors that the Guardia Civil would seize the cars which were in the paddock, which was at Montjuïc Stadium, forced the drivers to call off the strike.|$|E
25|$|The actions Claudius took to {{preserve}} his rule in the short-term were not easily undone as Britannicus approached manhood. In late 54, Britannicus was within 6 months of reaching manhood by Roman tradition, and had matured early. According to the historian Suetonius, Claudius began to mention divorcing Agrippina and dismissing Nero {{now that he was}} no longer needed. In preparation, Claudius commended both his son and adopted son to the Senate as equals in his last Senate address. Suetonius reports that Claudius now admonished his son to grow up quickly, implying that <b>everything</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> righted when he assumed the toga virilis.|$|E
60|$|A girl in {{blue with}} a big hat had come up, and was {{standing}} staring open-mouthed at the group. At {{the sight of her}} Bill the parrot uttered a shriek of welcome. Nelly Bryant had returned, and <b>everything</b> <b>would</b> now <b>be</b> all right again.|$|R
6000|$|... "Hear the big, strong, afraid-man talk!" [...] she jeered, with a wan smile. [...] "You don't know {{anything}} about it. How can a man? I am a healthy, natural woman. <b>Everything</b> <b>would</b> have <b>been</b> all right this time if... if all that fighting hadn't happened. Where did they bury Bert?" ...|$|R
60|$|Undy had no {{trust in}} his brother. He felt all but sure that, under {{the fire of}} Mr. Chaffanbrass, he <b>would</b> confess <b>everything.</b> It <b>would</b> <b>be</b> terrible to own the truth, but it <b>would</b> <b>be</b> more terrible to be indicted for perjury. So he sat silent.|$|R
25|$|Later, Nicholas, who {{requires}} {{his family}} signet ring {{as proof of}} his identity, tells Jo that the container of toxic waste is safe, as he has hidden it in the well. Jo is horrified at this and now considers Nicholas {{to be the person}} responsible for the harm which had befallen her friends at the school. Nicholas promises her that <b>everything</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> okay. With the help of Tama, and the technology of 1995, a neutralising agent for the toxic waste is discovered, and a sufficient quantity is manufactured to render the waste in the container safe.|$|E
25|$|Minister of the Interior Otar Khetsia stated on 21 November that {{criminal}} cases had been opened {{by law enforcement}} agencies in Gagra and Aradu. He noted that Azhiba's car had stood along the road at a far distance from his home, and while he confirmed that fire had broken out, he cautioned that {{it was up to}} the investigation to establish whether the car had exploded or been set fire to. Khetsia also confirmed that a warehouse for kiwifruit had burned down in Aradu, and that <b>everything</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> done to find the perpetrators, but he expressed his surprise at the fact that reporters from Abaza TV (owned by Butba) had been at the crime scene before officers from the Ochamchira police department.|$|E
25|$|The Austrians {{declined}} to launch any more serious assaults on Taponier's division and by 1:00 PM the contest degenerated into an artillery duel. Part of Lambert's brigade was rallied and reoccupied Heidenheim. The Austrians threatening the French right flank began withdrawing to Dillingen an der Donau. For {{the fourth time}} that day Moreau came to see Saint-Cyr, this time accompanied by Desaix. They informed their colleague that Delmas' division was not available yet {{and it was too}} late to attack the Austrian right that day. <b>Everything</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> ready the next day. Charles hoped that Moreau might concede defeat, but the morning of 12 August found the French army still in position. Charles then gave the order to fall back. Worried about the artillery ammunition shortage, Moreau did not attack Charles' right, but neither did he panic and retreat. Instead he held his position all day on the 12th waiting for confirmation that the Austrians were withdrawing across the Danube.|$|E
6000|$|... 'Oh! my dear Miss Bessie, let me {{introduce}} you to Mr. Foxholm--such a clever literary man. He knows everybody--all about everybody and <b>everything.</b> It <b>would</b> <b>be</b> such an advantage! And he has actually made me give him my autograph! Only think of that!' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You are not {{the less}} murderers {{if you have the}} intent to murder. Are {{soldiers}} murderers who kill other soldiers in battle? The murderer is the man who illegally kills. Now, in accordance with us, <b>everything</b> <b>would</b> have <b>been</b> done legally; and I'm afraid that if your grandfather were living among us, he <b>would</b> have to <b>be</b> deposited like the rest." ...|$|R
50|$|Albright and Mann {{note that}} Matthew {{consistently}} {{emphasizes the importance}} of renunciation in coming to Jesus, as represented by the fishers' abandonment of their nets. Fishing was a profitable, but capital intensive, occupation and abandoning <b>everything</b> <b>would</b> have <b>been</b> an important sacrifice. Clarke notes that this abandonment of worldly possessions was taken as a model by later Christian ascetics.|$|R
500|$|Robert Kirkman {{claimed that}} he had {{considered}} {{the idea of a}} television series, but never actively pursued it. When Darabont became interested, Kirkman called it [...] "extremely flattering" [...] and {{went on to say that}} [...] "he definitely cares about the original source material, and you can tell that in the way he's adapting it." [...] In his interview, Kirkman exclaimed that it was [...] "an extreme validation of the work", and continued by expressing that [...] "never in a million years could [...] have thought that if Walking Dead were to ever be adapted that <b>everything</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> going this well." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{music video}} for [...] "Losing My Religion" [...] was {{directed}} by Tarsem Singh. As opposed to previous R.E.M. videos, Michael Stipe agreed to lip sync the lyrics. The video originated as a combination of ideas envisioned by Stipe and Singh. Stipe wanted the promo to be a straightforward performance video, akin to Sinéad O'Connor's [...] "Nothing Compares 2 U". Singh {{wanted to create a}} video in the style of a certain type of Indian filmmaking, where <b>everything</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> [...] "melodramatic and very dreamlike", according to Stipe. [...] Singh has said the video is modeled after the Gabriel Garcia Marquez short story [...] " [...] A Very Old Man with Enormous Wings" [...] in which an angel crashes into a town and the villagers have varied reactions to him.|$|E
2500|$|After the {{discovery}} of the bodies, the police opened a murder investigation. Despite having received about 150 tips in the case, they were practically without leads. Kristiansand Police however stated that they were [...] "optimistic and confident that this case, {{we will be able to}} resolve fairly quickly". Prime Minister Jens Stoltenberg and Minister of Justice Hanne Harlem both stated that <b>everything</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> done to get the murders solved.|$|E
50|$|To Nietzsche {{everything}} in this world {{is an expression of}} will to power. To exist is to represent will to power, to cause influence (compare similar views of Protagoras' disciples in Plato's Theaetetus). One can cause influence only on something that exists. Therefore, (through induction) an act changes everything from that moment onwards. If one thing <b>was</b> otherwise, <b>everything</b> <b>would</b> have to <b>be</b> otherwise (and generally also backwards). Contrary to Chesterton's views, this general rule is not precluded even by absolute chances: they of course change the course of the world too, but still: if one thing <b>was</b> set otherwise, <b>everything</b> <b>would</b> have to <b>be</b> otherwise.|$|R
40|$|This essay {{discusses}} {{the idea that}} a Theory of <b>Everything</b> <b>would</b> not <b>be</b> complete without a theory of consciousness as one of its parts, and the suggestion that new physics may be needed to describe consciousness. I argue that the motivations behind searching for such a theory arise as the result of misunderstandings over the use of language when talking about consciousness. ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Psychologically," [...] Marcia Hannaway observed, [...] "his present {{action is}} interesting. If {{he had shot}} you or me in his first fit of passionate resentment, <b>everything</b> <b>would</b> have <b>been</b> in order, but to leave the country, nurse a sullen feeling of revenge for years, and then come back, seems curious. What shall {{you do when you}} see him sitting in his garden?" ...|$|R
2500|$|In 2014, the {{magazine}} withdrew a harshly-criticised {{review of a}} book by Edward Baptist on slavery and American capitalism; The Economist had complained that [...] "lmost all the blacks in his book are victims, almost all the whites villains." [...] Baptist attributed the harsh review to {{the magazine}}'s adherence to [...] "free-market fundamentalist" [...] theories, [...] "the idea that <b>everything</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> better if measured first and last by its efficiency at producing profit." ...|$|E
2500|$|... "Russell Johnson, {{secretary}} of the NAAO [...] had an arrangement with the Henley officials that they would approve all entries from the United States, which he had made {{during his visit to}} England in the winter of 1919-20... I asked him to check with the Stewards to see if they would accept my entry because in my earlier days I had served an apprenticeship as a bricklayer. He contacted four of them and they told him to send my entry in; the war had changed the old rule and <b>everything</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> all right".|$|E
2500|$|In an Internet of Things, {{the meaning}} of an event will not {{necessarily}} {{be based on a}} deterministic or syntactic model but would instead be based on the context of the event itself: this will also be a semantic web. Consequently, it will not necessarily need common standards that {{would not be able to}} address every context or use: some actors (services, components, avatars) will accordingly be self-referenced and, if ever needed, adaptive to existing common standards (predicting <b>everything</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> no more than defining a [...] "global finality" [...] for everything that is just not possible with any of the current top-down approaches and standardizations).|$|E
50|$|On 31 December, however, {{a witness}} in the Yadlin affair sent the police a {{statement}} which raised more questions for investigation, and various rumors were published about possible charges. On 2 January, Prime Minister Rabin and Justice Minister Zadok assured Ofer that <b>everything</b> possible <b>would</b> <b>be</b> done to expedite the inquiry.|$|R
60|$|<b>Everything</b> now <b>would</b> have <b>been</b> lost, if by {{good luck}} the hunter {{had not been}} {{standing}} on the castle tower and had seen everything with his sharp eyes.|$|R
6000|$|... 'If it were {{possible}} that I could make a lodgment with you, all my cares on that head <b>would</b> <b>be</b> removed. I am no bad neighbour, as perhaps you imagine; I have pliancy enough to suit myself to another, and here and there withal a certain knack, as Yorick says, at helping to make him merrier and better. Failing this, if you could find me any person that would undertake my small economy, <b>everything</b> <b>would</b> still <b>be</b> well.|$|R
