40|$|High density nano-crystalline MgB 2 bulk superconductors with induced pinning centres were {{prepared}} from elemental precursors by {{a sequence of}} ball milling, heat treatment, and <b>final</b> <b>pressing.</b> The XRD results revealed the main phase was MgB 2 with a minor component of MgO. The magnetic moment versus temperature indicated that the transition temperature of MgB 2 samples was around 34 K, which {{is less than the}} typical transition temperature of commercial powders and also the transition temperature strongly depended on the milling time. It is well known that introduction of defects, grain boundaries and impurities act as effective flux pinning centres in MgB 2 and results in increased critical current density, Jc and decreased the transition temperature, Tc. The magnetization measurements were performed using VSM at 10 K, 20 K and 30 K, and the M-H curves indicated a complete flux jump effect, which is a severe problem for the application of superconductors. It was determined that a noticeable amount of heating (∼ 0. 3 K jumps at 10 K) occurs at these jumps. In addition, {{it was found that the}} sweeping rate of magnetic field and the size of bulk sample are very effective to promote the flux jumping and whereas a low sweeping rate (12 Oe/s) avoids these "avalanches", consistent with a kind of supercritical phenomenon: going slower allows the field gradients to stay close enough to equilibrium so that the avalanche effect is not triggered. In contrast, the sweeping rate of 100 Oe/s leads to numerous jumps. © 2009 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved...|$|R
40|$|High-purity (99. 99 %) {{aluminum}} {{that had}} been subjected to equal-channel angular pressing (ECAP) was analyzed by orientation imaging microscopy (OIM). The analysis of microtexture and microstructure by OIM will be reviewed. The ECAP pressing was conducted at room temperature with a die that had a 90 ° angle between the die channels and repetitive pressings followed either route A, BC or C. Billets were examined after one pass and after four or twelve passes by each of the ECAP routes. After one pressing operation, the deformation-induced microstructure was inhomogeneous at the resolution of OIM and consisted mostly of subgrains. Following four pressings by each of the routes, the microstructures were homogeneous and exhibited similar (sub) grain sizes (~ 1. 3 ?m). Elongation and alignment of the (sub) grains with the shearing direction of the last pressing operation was observed in all cases. The corresponding disorientation distributions showed significant increases in the fractions of high-angle boundaries (?> 15 °) although processing route had little apparent effect on the observed distributions. However, distinct differences were noted in the microtexture data. After 12 pressing operations {{by any of the}} different routes the grain size was reduced further to about 1. 0 ?m.

30|$|A {{hot press}} {{was used to}} {{manufacture}} particleboards (H boards). A radio-frequency hot press (for RH boards) and an air-injection radio-frequency hot press (for ARH board) were also used, {{and the effects of}} air injection on preventing blowout and board properties were analyzed. The thicknesses and densities of manufactured boards were 10 and 30  mm, and 0.6, 0.7, and 0.8  g/cm 3, respectively. The investigation ascertained the effects of air injection in preventing blowout when a radio-frequency hot press is used. The increasing order of temperature was ARH board > RH board > H board during the <b>final</b> <b>pressing</b> stage. For the 30 -mm-thick boards, the temperature of H board increased to 100  °C and remained constant at 100  °C even when the pressing time was extended. The temperature of the RH board increased to 100  °C more quickly than {{in the case of the}} H board and remained constant at 110 – 118  °C. The temperature of the ARH board increased linearly to 130 – 142  °C. For both the 10 - and 30 -mm-thick boards, the internal bond strength of the RH board was almost the same as that of the ARH board at densities of 0.6 and 0.7  g/cm 3. In contrast, the internal bond strength of the RH board was lower than that of the ARH board at a density of 0.8  g/cm 3. For the 10 -mm-thick boards, the thickness swelling in the RH board was almost the same as that in the ARH board irrespective of the density. However, for the 30 -mm-thick boards, the thickness swelling in the RH board was higher than that in the ARH board. The low plasticization of particles due to air injection presumably results in a high degree of thickness swelling.|$|R

40|$|In {{the current}} work {{the effects of}} {{machine-tool}} deflections, component unloading, and component-tool interactions on the dimensions of positive WC-Co compacts were determined {{on the basis of}} various tests performed using different compact geometries, compaction materials, tool designs and press decompression settings. Specifically the machine-tool deflection was defined and examined in terms of the punch-ram system contraction along the vertical axis of the press, component unloading in terms of axial, radial and volumetric compact springback, and component-tool interaction in terms of contact between the ejecting compacts and the die-wall. A new tool design was introduced to study the springback behaviour of compacts and compared against the conventional tooling design which makes use of a tight-fitting upper punch and die combination. As a result of the new tool design, positive compacts that were formed had near perfectly sharp cutting edges. Contraction experiments allowed for the determination of the contraction profile along several points of the machine-tool system especially contraction of the upper punch-ram. This quantity was found to be independent of tool geometry; a significant result which allows for the prediction of contraction behaviour and therefore increased control over the <b>final</b> <b>pressing</b> position of a variety of other production punches. Natural springback behaviour of positive compacts was studied {{on the basis of the}} determined contraction measurements and the newly introduced tool design which allowed for the formation and ejection of compacts free from die-wall contact and associated frictional influences. Axial and radial springback, as well as their fractional counterparts, could be expressed in terms of the same functions of the pressing force, dependant only on the hold-down setting (geometric and material factors being accounted for and embodied in the pressing force parameter). This new result simplifies the prediction of linear springback and its effect on the net shape of production items. Volumetric springback was found to be independent of compact shape which can then be used to make general predictions regarding the effect of three-dimensional springback on the total net shape of compacts in production. Both relative and volumetric springback were also found to be independent of the compaction material and hold-down setting...|$|R

Material for {{the album}} was {{completed}} in stages from 1986 to 1990, with one song ("Death...In Its Arms") recorded by the band Danzig, including drummer Chuck Biscuits (who {{had never been a}} member of Samhain) during the sessions for Danzig II: Lucifuge. On all other tracks, a drum machine was used. As much of the material for Final Descent was intended for a planned Samhain Grim album, its sound and songwriting bridges the gap between 1986's November Coming Fire and 1988's Danzig. In its first <b>pressings,</b> <b>Final</b> Descent also featured new remixed versions of the then out-of-print Unholy Passion EP. Possibly to avoid potential legal disputes with former guitarist Damien, Danzig had overdubbed/re-recorded all of the original guitar tracks with his own guitar playing. He also created a new track, a remix of the bass and vocal tracks from [...] "I Am Misery", entitled [...] "Misery Tomb".|$|R
