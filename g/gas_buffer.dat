40|$|Lecturepg. 69 There {{has been}} a rapid growth in the {{application}} of noncontacting double seals with a <b>gas</b> <b>buffer</b> fluid to pump sealing. The advantages of such a sealing arrangement are: ?	There is no liquid buffer fluid to maintain or dispose of. ?	<b>Gas</b> <b>buffer</b> fluid causes a minimum of contamination to the process. ?	There are no emissions, so no monitoring may be required. ?	Friction power is only a fraction of that associated with liquid seals. ?	Because there is no contact, seal life can be several times that of a liquid/contacting seal. One of the limitations of a conventional double seal arrangement, be it gas or liquid, is that there must be either considerable axial length or considerable diametral space available. There are many pump applications that could benefit from a double gas buffered sealing system where space is severely limited. Thus, {{there is a need for}} a small size double gas sealing device. The double gas seal with coplanar coaxial Rayleigh pad faces has two gas sealing faces concentrically located on the same plane. Buffer gas is supplied to an annular groove between the two sealing faces. The outside gas seal leaks to process and the inside gas seal leaks to atmosphere. Both faces have Rayleigh step pad lifting surfaces as well as a sealing dam similar to a conventional gas seal. The process fluid is to the outside of the outer seal face so as to minimize process fluid contamination of the gas seal face. With the configuration described, the double gas seal with coplanar coaxial faces can be made into a small package that fits entirely into a seal gland, which itself has minimum dimensions. Thus this seal will fit to most conventional small bore ANSI pumps, and this makes it possible to apply double gas sealing technology to many existing process pumps. In this paper, the theory of the double gas seal with coplanar coaxial faces is described. Considerable design work was required to find useable shapes and balance moments on the seal so that the inside and outside sealing gaps stay open under variable process and gas supply pressures. Optimization of the Rayleigh step pad bearings was performed. A complete simulation model was developed. Deflection results and predicted performance (leakage) are presented. Extensive testing has been conducted, and the paper presents predicted and measured leakage as a function of process and gas pressure. Loss-of-gas testing has also been performed, and these results are presented. Several field tests have been initiated and these are described. Observation so far has been that the seal performs as expected, so the double gas seal with coplanar coaxial faces can be used to provide double gas sealing solutions for many pumps having limited available space...|$|E

40|$|The {{selective}} oxidation {{of organic}} and inorganic substrates has gained much importance in recent years, {{for example in}} the preparation of high value-added organics or in the field of the environmental remediation. Oxygen atom transfer (OAT) reactions are an important class of oxidation reactions that are widely applied and technologically relevant. A reaction of particular importance is the oxidation of harmful carbon monoxide to the more benign carbon dioxide in the presence of heterogeneous catalysts, a process that is relevant for example in the abatement of environmental pollution or in case of the poisoning of fuel cell, where the absorbed CO molecules, generated as reaction intermediates, block active sites of the catalyst hindering further reactions. 	OAT to carbon monoxide has been mainly accomplished by metal-dioxo, metal peroxo and metal-oxo species, that offer pathways for the selective oxidation of this compound. Gas phase studies have been especially useful in elucidating the intrinsic behaviour of such species, that can be investigated with rigorous exclusion of many complicating parameters such as solvent and aggregation effects, counterions, ligands, etc. 	In contrast, {{little is known about the}} reactivity of non-metal oxides, and it is worth investigating these reactions in the gaseous isolated state to gain a better understanding of the mechanism of oxidation of CO. 	As a continuation of our interests in the activation of small molecules by metal-free ionic species, here we report on the activation of carbon monoxide by oxyhalogenated anions, (XO-, X = Cl, Br, I).

40|$|In this thesis, the {{magnetic}} and structural properties of layered epitaxial film systems and clusters are presented. A main achievement is {{the investigation of}} the direct correlation between magnetism and structural or morphological details of ultrathin films. For this purpose, the film structure has been accessed directly by means of surface science methods. The effect of structural changes on the magnetism were observed in-situ by magneto-optical techniques. First, epitaxial Fe films grown at low temperature (∼ 120 K) on Cu(100) have been investigated. Such layers assume an fcc-crystal structure due to their interaction with the underlying Cu substrate. Within this work it is shown that the morphology of these films can be altered by annealing treatments. The thermally-induced morphological changes have direct consequences for domain wall propagation and result in increased coercivity and in modified surface anisotropy. Flat fcc-Fe layers on Cu(100) have been used as templates to form fcc-Fe/Cu/Fe trilayers with coupled perpendicular magnetization. Such systems might be of relevance for data storage applications. The perpendicular coupling is ascribed to the realignment of the magnetization of the bottom Fe layer within the stray field produced by the top Fe layer magnetization. The magnetic coupling has been investigated {{as a function of the}} thickness of the top and the bottom Fe layer as well as the Cu spacer thickness. It was found that the magneto-static interaction is a direct consequence of the fcc-structure of both Fe layers and the interface roughness. It is demonstrated that Fe films with fcc-structure and perpendicular magnetization can also be prepared on other fcc-templates, such as Pt substrates. Monatomic steps on the substrate surface are exploited to steer the growth of the film and with it the magnetism. Despite significant differences in the morphology and the atomic structure of Fe films on flat Pt(111) and stepped Pt(997), the critical thickness for the spin reorientation transition is similar on the two surfaces. However, the local atomic arrangement above three monolayer film thickness determines in-plane easy magnetization axis parallel to the step edges. For all layered systems investigated in this thesis, epitaxial strain is a the driving force which influences the film structure and triggers structural transitions. The strain dependence of the morphology and the magnetism was probed by a comparative study of Fe deposited on Pt substrates with and without a noble <b>gas</b> <b>buffer</b> layer. The formation of relaxed Fe clusters during Xe layer desorption is favored in the absence of the overlayer-substrate interaction. Striking differences in {{the magnetic}} anisotropy between the systems are attributed to magneto-elastic contributions. Measurements of the blocking temperature of the Fe clusters allow estimating the cluster size. All samples have been investigated under ultra high vacuum conditions.

Structural characterization was done by low energy electron diffraction and, in collaboration with other scientists, by scanning tunnelling microscopy...|$|E
40|$|The {{iron oxide}} copper-gold (IOCG) Raúl-Condestable deposit is located 90 km south of Lima, Peru, and {{approximately}} 5 km from the Pacific coast. Mineralization consists mainly of replacement mantos and disseminations within permeable volcaniclastic and carbonate-rich rocks and structurally controlled veins surrounding a coeval and apparently causative intrusion of tonalitic composition emplaced {{in the core}} of a dacitic volcano. Potassic (biotite grading upward to sericite-chlorite) alteration and a poorly developed, almost sulfide-free, quartz stockwork closely border the tonalite, affecting the basaltic to dacitic Lower Cretaceous volcano-sedimentary host sequence. Ore is associated with a hydrated calc-silicate (mainly amphiboles) alteration that surrounds the biotite alteration. A hematite-chlorite (albite, epidote, calcite) alteration affects the periphery of the system. The main ore stage is characterized by two end-member mineral associations that were formed according to (1) an oxidized deposition sequence (hematite-magnetite-pyrite-chalcopyrite) occurring in and near feeder structures, and (2) a reduced deposition sequence (pyrrhotite-pyrite-chalcopyrite) found in volcaniclastic rocks and veins. Early specular hematite of the oxidized sequence is transformed to magnetite (“mushketovite”). The main ore-stage mineralization is cut by minor late-stage calcite-sulfide veins. Main ore-stage sulfides have δ 34 S values asymmetrically distributed from 1. 0 to 26. 3 per mil, with a median at 6. 6 per mil (n = 51). Similar values are observed for pyrrhotite, pyrite, and chalcopyrite. The δ 34 S values depend on the stratigraphic position, with deep-seated vein samples normally distributed between 1. 0 and 6. 3 per mil (avg about 3. 5 ‰, n = 13) and shallower samples from 2. 7 to 26. 3 per mil (median around 7. 5 ‰, n = 39). Sulfides found in late-stage calcite-sulfide veins show strongly negative δ 34 S values ranging between – 32. 7 and – 22. 9 per mil (n = 6), indicating a possible biogenic source. Because no rock unit is known to occur in the internal parts of the deposit that could have oxidized fluids to the point of hematite stability, the oxidized mineral sequence is best explained by magmatic brines following the SO 2 -H 2 S <b>gas</b> <b>buffer</b> at high temperature (> 350 °C) and fluid/rock ratio. This is supported by the close to magmatic δ 34 S values of sulfides from the deep parts of feeder veins. Mass-balance calculation based on sulfur isotope data suggests that at the deposit scale, the bulk of the sulfides is dominated by magmatic sulfur, with sulfides of the oxidized minerals association having a larger component of magmatic sulfur than those of the reduced mineral association. The deposition sequence from hematite to chalcopyrite reflects the cooling of the magmatic fluid and redox and pH buffering by the basaltic-andesitic volcano-sedimentary host rocks. Thus, the occurrence of magnetite pseudomorphous after early hematite (mushketovite) paragenetically followed by iron-bearing sulfides is interpreted to be direct field evidence for precipitation from oxidized magmatic brines. The same sequence has been described in many IOCG, skarn, and some porphyry copper deposits worldwide. δ 34 S values of sulfides ranging up to 26. 3 per mil are found in what corresponded to a relatively shallow aquifer filled with evolved reduced seawater. Heavy sulfur in H 2 S was produced through thermochemical reduction of Aptian seawater sulfate (δ 34 S = 14 ‰) in the recharge zone, which is interpreted to correspond to the hematitechlorite (albite, epidote, calcite) alteration present at the upper flanks of the hydrothermal system, adjacent to the causative intrusion. Hematitization (through oxidation) resulted from the high fO 2 of seawater and from the reduction of its sulfate to H 2 S by the Fe 2 + contained in the rock. In the core of the system, the seawater-derived fluids reached near chemical equilibrium with their actinolitized host rock, at about 300 ° to 350 °C, in reduced, rock-dominated conditions. Mixing of these fluids with magmatic brines, already partially or totally reduced through reaction with wall rock at medium to low magmatic fluid/rock ratio can explain the large positive δ 34 S scatter observed in sulfides of the reduced mineral association, at stratigraphically shallow positions...|$|E

40|$|We {{show that}} a large class of helium-containing cold polar {{molecules}} form readily in a cryogenic <b>buffer</b> <b>gas,</b> achieving densities as high as 10 ^ 12 cm^- 3. We explore the spin relaxation of these molecules in <b>buffer</b> <b>gas</b> loaded magnetic traps, and identify a loss mechanism based on Landau-Zener transitions arising from the anisotropic hyperfine interaction. Our {{results show that the}} recently observed strong T^ 6 thermal dependence of spin change in <b>buffer</b> <b>gas</b> trapped silver (Ag) is accounted for by the formation and spin change of AgHe, thus providing evidence for molecular formation in a <b>buffer</b> <b>gas</b> trap.

40|$|The 10. 6 pm {{transmission}} {{properties of}} SF 6 were measured using nanosecond-duration pulses for various <b>buffer</b> <b>gases</b> and <b>buffer</b> <b>gas</b> pressures up to 3 atm. The {{addition of a}} barer gas strongly increased the SF 6 absorption at moderate energy fluenees without significantly altering the high fluence pulse transmission. For pressures above 1 atm the transmission behavior appeared independent of the pulse duration over the range of parameters investigated in this experiment. The implication of these results for CO 2 laser applications will be discussed. Peer reviewed: YesNRC publication: Ye...|$|R

40|$|We {{describe}} {{the results of}} the frequency shifts measured from various <b>buffer</b> <b>gases</b> that might be used as a <b>buffer</b> <b>gas</b> to increase the loading efficiency and cooling of ions trapped in a small mercury ion clock. The small mass, volume and power requirement of space clock precludes the use of turbo pumps. Hence, a hermetically sealed vacuum system, incorporating a suitable getter material with a fixed amount of inert <b>buffer</b> <b>gas</b> may be a practical alternative to the groundbased system. The collision shifts of 40, 507, 347. 996 xx Hz clock transition for helium, neon and argon <b>buffer</b> <b>gases</b> were measured in the ambient earth magnetic field. In addition to the above non-getterable inert gases we also measured the frequency shifts due to getterable, molecular hydrogen and nitrogen gases which may be used as <b>buffer</b> <b>gases</b> when incorporated with a miniature ion pump. We also examined the frequency shift due to the low methane gas partial pressure in a fixed higher pressure neon <b>buffer</b> <b>gas</b> environment. Methane gas interacted with mercury ions in a peculiar way as to preserve the ion number but to relax the population difference in the two hyperfine clock states and thereby reducing the clock resonance signal. The same population relaxation was also observed for other molecular <b>buffer</b> <b>gases</b> (N H,) but at much reduced rate...|$|R

The linewidth decreases with the increase of the <b>buffer</b> <b>gas</b> pressure.
