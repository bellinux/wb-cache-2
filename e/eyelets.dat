5|$|For {{protection}} and preservation, a polished Japanese sword needs a scabbard. A fully mounted scabbard (koshirae) may {{consist of a}} lacquered body, a taped hilt, a sword guard (tsuba) and decorative metal fittings. Though the original purpose was to protect a sword from damage, from early times on Japanese sword mountings became a status symbol and were used to add dignity. Starting in the Heian period, a sharp distinction was made between swords designed for use in battle and those for ceremonial use. Tachi long swords were worn edge down suspended by two cords or chains from the waist belt. The cords were attached to two <b>eyelets</b> on the scabbard.|$|E
25|$|This is {{the process}} of running the {{shoelaces}} through the holes, <b>eyelets,</b> loops, or hooks to hold together the sides of the shoe with many common lacing methods. There are, in fact, almost two trillion ways to lace a shoe with six pairs of <b>eyelets.</b>|$|E

The marshal's star is suspended by a 25 mm moire ribbon. The total weight of the large marshal's star is 36.8 g. Approximately 200 {{of this type of}} marshal's star were produced.|$|R
25|$|With {{the advent}} of metal <b>eyelets,</b> tight lacing became possible. The {{position}} of the <b>eyelets</b> changed. They were situated across from one another at the back. The front was fastened with a metal busk in front. Corsets were mostly white. The corsets of the 1850s–1860s were shorter than the corsets of the 19th century through 1840s. This was because {{of a change in}} the silhouette of women's fashion. The 1850s and 1860s emphasized the hoopskirt. After the 1860s, when the hoop fell out of style, the corset became longer to mold the abdomen, exposed by the new lines of the princess or cuirass style.|$|E
25|$|The {{purpose of}} 18th century stays was {{to support the}} bust and confer the fashionable conical shape while drawing the {{shoulders}} back. At this time, the <b>eyelets</b> were reinforced with stitches and were not placed across from one another, but instead staggered. This allowed the stays to be spiral laced. One end of the stay lace was inserted and knotted in the bottom eyelet; the other end was wound through the stays' <b>eyelets</b> and tightened on the top. Tight-lacing was not the purpose of stays during this time period. Women in all societal levels, from ladies of the court to street vendors, wore stays.|$|E
25|$|The stiff {{section at}} each end of the shoelace, which both keeps the twine from {{unraveling}} and also makes it easier to hold the lace and feed it through the <b>eyelets,</b> is called an aglet, also spelled aiglet.|$|E
25|$|Small trout {{caught on}} a barb-less hook can be {{released}} simply by: grasping the <b>eyelet</b> of the fly, and rotating the <b>eyelet</b> toward the bend (the U-bend). This pulls the point backwards, back through the way it entered. Push the <b>eyelet</b> directly toward the bend until the point {{is removed from the}} fish. Large trout can be grasped gently and forceps can be used to grip the bend and push backwards, away from the direction the hook currently points. If necessary, squirming trout can be held on their backs. This often subdues the fish and provides enough time to remove the hook.|$|R

25|$|Holes {{may be made}} conductive, by {{electroplating}} or inserting metal <b>eyelets</b> (hollow), to electrically and thermally connect board layers. Some conductive {{holes are}} intended for the insertion of through-hole-component leads. Others, typically smaller and used to connect board layers, are called vias.|$|E

25|$|As for {{shoelaces}} in {{the sense}} that we know them in modern times, the Museum of London has documented examples of medieval footwear dating from as far back as the 12th century, which clearly show the lacing passing through a series of hooks or <b>eyelets</b> down the front or side of the shoe.|$|E

40|$|The general {{diffusion}} porin from Rhodopseudomonas blastica {{was produced in}} large amounts in Escherichia coli inclusion bodies and (re) natured to the exact native structure. Here, we report on 13 mutants at the pore <b>eyelet</b> giving rise to new diffusion properties as measured in planar lipid bilayer experiments. The crystal structures of seven of these mutants were established. The effects of charge-modifying mutations at the pore <b>eyelet</b> {{are consistent with the}} known selectivity for cations. Deletions of 16 and 27 residues of the constriction loop L 3 resulted in labile trimers and pores. The reduction of the <b>eyelet</b> cross section by introducing tryptophans gave rise to a closely correlated decrease of the conductivities. A mutant with six newly introduced tryptophans in the <b>eyelet</b> closed its pore in a defined manner within seconds under a voltage of 20 mV, suggesting the existence of two states. The results indicate that the pore can be engineered in a rational manner...|$|R

25|$|The {{component}} parts {{that may be}} found in a leather dress glove are one pair of tranks, one pair of thumbs, four whole fourchettes, four half fourchettes, two gussets, and six quirks. Depending on the style of the glove there may also be roller pieces, straps, rollers, <b>eyelets,</b> studs, sockets and domes. Finally, linings will themselves consist of tranks, thumbs and fourchettes.|$|E
25|$|He wore {{mismatched}} {{socks and}} jockey undershorts, along with brown slacks, which were partially removed, as {{was typical of}} other victims. Brad wore boots, which were ankle-high, hiking-style, with brown fleece interior. Metal <b>eyelets</b> were used to fasten them. Brad's boots are no longer available for examination. Because {{of the type of}} tattoos he had, he may have served time in jail or a juvenile detention center.|$|E
25|$|From 1600 to c. 1630, hose or {{breeches}} were {{fastened to}} doublets {{by means of}} ties or points, short laces or ribbons pulled through matching sets of worked <b>eyelets.</b> Points were tied in bows at the waist and became more elaborate until they disappeared with the very short waisted doublets of the late 1630s. Decorated metal tips on points were called aiguillettes or aiglets, {{and those of the}} wealthy were made of precious metals set with pearls and other gemstones.|$|E

25|$|Most uppers have a mechanism, such as laces, straps with buckles, zippers, elastic, velcro straps, buttons, or snaps, for {{tightening}} the upper on the foot. Uppers with laces {{usually have a}} tongue that helps seal the laced opening and protect the foot from abrasion by the laces. Uppers with laces also have <b>eyelets</b> or hooks {{to make it easier}} to tighten and loosen the laces and to prevent the lace from tearing through the upper material. An aglet is the protective wrapping on the end of the lace.|$|E
25|$|Another kind of {{compound}} eye, {{found in}} males of Order Strepsiptera, employs {{a series of}} simple eyes—eyes having one opening that provides light for an entire image-forming retina. Several of these <b>eyelets</b> together form the strepsipteran compound eye, {{which is similar to}} the 'schizochroal' compound eyes of some trilobites. Because each eyelet is a simple eye, it produces an inverted image; those images are combined in the brain to form one unified image. Because the aperture of an eyelet is larger than the facets of a compound eye, this arrangement allows vision under low light levels.|$|E
25|$|Shoelaces, {{also called}} shoestrings (US English) or bootlaces (UK English), are a system {{commonly}} used to secure shoes, boots and other footwear.They typically consist {{of a pair of}} strings or cords, one for each shoe, finished off at both ends with stiff sections, known as aglets. Each shoelace typically passes through a series of holes, <b>eyelets,</b> loops or hooks {{on either side of the}} shoe. Loosening the lacing allows the shoe to open wide enough for the foot to be inserted or removed. Tightening the lacing and tying off the ends secures the foot within the shoe.|$|E

25|$|The final layer was the petticoat, {{which could}} have a scooped {{neckline}} and was sleeveless, and was fitted {{in the back with}} hooks and <b>eyelets,</b> buttons or tapes. These petticoats were often worn between the underwear and the outer dress and was considered part of the outer clothing not underwear. The lower edge of the petticoat was intended to be seen, since women would often lift their outer dresses to spare the relatively delicate material of the outer dress from mud or damp (so exposing only the coarser and cheaper fabric of the petticoat to risk). Often exposed to view, petticoats were decorated at the hem with rows of tucks or lace, or ruffles.|$|E
25|$|La Rose was {{editor-in-chief}} of New Beacon Books {{until his death}} in 2006. He edited the occasional journal New Beacon Review (1968, 1985, 1986) and co-edited with Andrew Salkey the special issue of the magazine Savacou (Nos. 9/10, 1974) that provided a comprehensive anthology of black writing in Britain during the period of the Caribbean Artists Movement. La Rose published his first collection of poems, Foundations, in 1966 and his second collection, <b>Eyelets</b> of Truth Within Me, in 1992 (both published by New Beacon Books). His poems and essays have been widely anthologised, and his journalism was published regularly in Race Today. He co-authored Kaiso Calypso Music: David Rudder in Conversation with John La Rose in 1990. He co-produced and scripted the documentary film Mangrove Nine, about the resistance to police attacks on the popular Mangrove restaurant in the early 1970s, with the film director Franco Rosso. He produced a short film on the Black Church in Britain as part of a Full House BBC 2 television programme on the Caribbean arts in 1973.|$|E

50|$|Of {{this type}} of medals {{about half of the}} known {{specimens}} have their <b>eyelet</b> broken off. That is due to fashion in the late 17th and 18th century, when a medal with an <b>eyelet</b> did not show off beautifully in a collector’s cabinet (even nowadays museums sometimes buy early medals with an <b>eyelet</b> broken off, unaware of yesterday’s fashion and of complete specimens in other collections).Early in the 17th century, {{when it became clear that}} the Dutch were going to win their Eighty Years' War, there was a growing demand for Geuzen medals, because now it was safe to be a geus. From that moment Jonghelinck’s medal was copied, mostly not cast but in struck silver, mostly slightly bigger to show off better and already sometimes with attached beggar’s bowls and flasks.|$|R
