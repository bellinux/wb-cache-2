40|$|Gene {{regulatory}} {{interactions are}} context dependent, active in some cell types or cellular states {{but not in}} others. In this thesis we present a method for determining when a regulatory link is active given temporal measurements of gene expression. Correlations in time-series data are used to determine how genes influence each other and their causal relationships. Natural stochastic noise is shown {{to aid in the}} process of network identification by perturbing the expression of genes; the speed and direction at which the noisy signal propagates shows how the network is connected. Cross correlation functions are used to reveal time-delayed correlations. We develop a stochastic model of gene expression and show that by measuring correlations in cellular noise, it is possible to infer network activity and temporal properties of gene regulation. Using a linearized version of the model, we introduce a method for analytically deriving cross correlation functions for arbitrary networks. These results are validated experimentally using a synthetic gene circuit in E. coli bacteria. Single-cell time-lapse microscopy is used to measure noisy expression of multiple genes over time. Extending this work to natural systems, we study <b>feed-forward</b> <b>loops</b> and determine that certain classes of <b>feed-forward</b> <b>loops</b> are more robust to noise and parameter variations that others.

50|$|The {{ubiquitous}} role of {{this gene}} {{lends itself to}} being involved {{in a variety of}} disease pathologies, including cancer. PDK1 mRNA expression is significantly associated with tumor progression; in fact, the presence of PDK1 can serve as a prognostic marker, indicating the level of success a patient can achieve. Specifically, this may serve as a biomarker in patients with gastric cancer. In coordination, the inhibitor dichloroacetic acid may be used in the future as a treatment option for patients with this type of cancer. PDK1, as it regulates hypoxia and lactate production, is associated with a poor outcome in patients with head and neck squamous cancer. The buildup of glycolytic metabolites may promote Hypoxia-Inducing Factor (HIF) activation, which creates a <b>feed-forward</b> <b>loop</b> for malignancy progression. As such, using HIF-1 as a metabolite to regulate PDK1 is seen as another potential therapy, either on its own or in tandem with other therapies, for this type of cancer. In a further developed study, combined PDK1 and CHK1 inhibition was shown to be required to kill glioblastoma stem-like cells in vitro and in vivo.|$|E

The human pathogen Mycobacterium tuberculosis responds to stress encountered during infection by arresting multiplication and implementing critical metabolic changes {{that lead to}} or sustain the nonreplicative state. Much of this differentiation program is recapitulated when M. tuberculosis cultures are subjected to gradual oxygen depletion in vitro. Here we report that hypoxic induction of critical central metabolism genes in the glyoxylate shunt (icl 1) and in the methylcitrate cycle (gltA 1) involves both global and local regulators. The global regulators are accessory sigma factors σB for icl 1 and σE for gltA 1. The local regulators are the products of two paralogous genes mapping at positions adjacent to the corresponding effector gene or operon. We call these genes lrpI and lrpG (for local regulatory protein of icl 1 and gltA 1). We also found that (i) each sigma factor controls the corresponding local regulator, (ii) both global and local regulators are required for effector gene induction, and (iii) the occurrence of sigma factor control of effector gene induction is independent of its control over the corresponding local regulator. Together, these data indicate that induction of icl 1 and gltA 1 utilizes parallel <b>feed-forward</b> <b>loops</b> with an AND input function. Both <b>feed-forward</b> <b>loops</b> are affected by σE, since this sigma factor {{is part of the}} gltA 1 loop and controls sigB in the icl 1 <b>loop.</b> <b>Feed-forward</b> <b>loops</b> may critically contribute to the cellular developmental program associated with M. tuberculosis dormancy...|$|R

40|$|The {{molecular}} {{mechanisms that}} control the balance between antiangiogenic and proangiogenic factors and initiate the angiogenic switch in tumors remain poorly defined. By combining chemical genetics with multimodal imaging, we have identified an autocrine <b>feed-forward</b> <b>loop</b> in tumor cells in which tumor-derived VEGF stimulates VEGF production via VEGFR 2 -dependent activation of mTOR, substantially amplifying the initial proangiogenic signal. Disruption of this <b>feed-forward</b> <b>loop</b> by chemical perturbation or knockdown of VEGFR 2 in tumor cells dramatically inhibited production of VEGF in vitro and in vivo. This disruption was sufficient to prevent tumor growth in vivo. In patients with lung cancer, we found that this VEGF:VEGFR 2 <b>feed-forward</b> <b>loop</b> was active, {{as the level of}} VEGF/VEGFR 2 binding in tumor cells was highly correlated to tumor angiogenesis. We further demonstrated that inhibition of tumor cell VEGFR 2 induces feedback activation of the IRS/MAPK signaling cascade. Most strikingly, combined pharmacological inhibition of VEGFR 2 (ZD 6474) and MEK (PD 0325901) in tumor cells resulted in dramatic tumor shrinkage, whereas monotherapy only modestly slowed tumor growth. Thus, a tumor cell-autonomous VEGF:VEGFR 2 <b>feed-forward</b> <b>loop</b> provides signal amplification required for the establishment of fully angiogenic tumors in lung cancer.

Although the abundance of certain three-node motifs, such as the <b>feed-forward</b> <b>loop,</b> is positively correlated with a networks’ ability to tolerate moderate disruptions to gene expression, little is known regarding the connectivity of individual genes participating in multiple motifs. Using the transcriptional network of the bacterium Escherichia coli, we investigate this feature by reconstructing the distribution of genes participating in <b>feed-forward</b> <b>loop</b> motifs from its largest connected network component. We contrast these motif participation distributions with those obtained from model networks built using the preferential attachment mechanism employed by many biological and man-made networks. We report that, although some of these model networks support a motif participation distribution that appears qualitatively similar to that obtained from the bacterium Escherichia coli, the probability for a node to support a <b>feed-forward</b> <b>loop</b> motif may instead be strongly influenced by only a few master transcriptional regulators within the network.

40|$|The {{importance}} of post-transcriptional regulation by small non-coding RNAs {{has recently been}} recognized in both pro- and eukaryotes. Small RNAs (sRNAs) regulate gene expression post-transcriptionally by base pairing with the mRNA. Here we use dynamical simulations to characterize this regulation mode in comparison to transcriptional regulation mediated by protein–DNA interaction and to post-translational regulation achieved by protein–protein interaction. We show quantitatively that regulation by sRNA is advantageous when fast responses to external signals are needed, consistent with experimental data about its involvement in stress responses. Our analysis indicates that the half-life of the sRNA–mRNA complex and the ratio of their production rates determine the steady-state level of the target protein, suggesting that regulation by sRNA may provide fine-tuning of gene expression. We also describe the network of regulation by sRNA in Escherichia coli, and integrate it with the transcription regulation network, uncovering mixed regulatory circuits, such as mixed <b>feed-forward</b> <b>loops.</b> The integration of sRNAs in <b>feed-forward</b> <b>loops</b> provides tight repression, guaranteed by the combination of transcriptional and post-transcriptional regulations...|$|R

Our TSC algorithm allows the user to specify which higher-order network structures (cycles, <b>feed-forward</b> <b>loops,</b> etc.) should be preserved by the network clustering. Higher-order network structures of interest are represented using a tensor, which we then partition by developing a multilinear spectral method. Our framework can be applied to discovering layered flows in networks as well as graph anomaly detection, which we illustrate on synthetic networks. In directed networks, a higher-order structure of particular interest is the directed 3 -cycle, which captures feedback loops in networks.

We examine the <b>feed-forward</b> <b>loop</b> dynamics quantitatively at the whole time interval of cell cycle.

40|$|AbstractExpression {{profiles}} of developmental genes in Dictyostelium were determined on microarrays during development of wild type cells and mutant cells lacking either the DNA binding protein GBF or the signaling protein LagC. We {{found that the}} mutant strains developed in suspension with added cAMP expressed the pulse-induced and early adenylyl cyclase (ACA) -dependent genes, but not the later ACA-dependent, post-aggregation genes. Since expression of lagC itself is dependent on GBF, expression of the post-aggregation genes might be controlled only by signaling from LagC. However, expression of lagC in a GBF-independent manner in a gbfA− null strain {{did not result in}} expression of the post-aggregation genes. Since GBF is necessary for accumulation of LagC and both the DNA binding protein and the LagC signal transduction pathway are necessary for expression of post-aggregation genes, GBF and LagC form a <b>feed-forward</b> <b>loop.</b> Such network architecture is a common motif in diverse organisms and can act as a filter for noisy inputs. Breaking the <b>feed-forward</b> <b>loop</b> by expressing lagC in a GBF-independent manner in a gbfA+ strain does not significantly affect the patterns of gene expression for cells developed in suspension with added cAMP, but results in a significant delay at the mound stage and asynchronous development on solid supports.

40|$|Complex gene {{regulation}} networks {{are made of}} simple recurring gene circuits called network motifs. One {{of the most common}} network motifs is the incoherent type- 1 <b>feed-forward</b> <b>loop</b> (I 1 -FFL), in which a transcription activator activates a gene directly, and also activates a repressor of the gene. Mathematical modeling suggested that the I 1 -FFL can show two dynamical features: a transient pulse of gene expression, and acceleration of the dynamics of the target gene. It is important to experimentally study the dynamics of this motif in living cells, to test whether it carries out these functions even when embedded within additional interactions in the cell. Here, we address this using a system with incoherent <b>feed-forward</b> <b>loop</b> connectivity, the galactose (gal) system of Escherichia coli. We measured the dynamics of this system in response to inducing signals at high temporal resolution and accuracy by means of green fluorescent protein reporters. We show that the galactose system displays accelerated turn-on dynamics. The acceleration is abolished in strains and conditions that disrupt the I 1 -FFL. The I 1 -FFL motif in the gal system works as theoretically predicted despite being embedded in several additional feedback loops.
