5|$|The {{procedure}} is high risk as a diver suffering from DCS may become paralysed, unconscious or stop breathing whilst under water. Any {{one of these}} events may result in the diver drowning or further injury to the diver during a subsequent rescue to the surface. These risks can be mitigated to some extent by using a helmet or <b>full-face</b> mask with voice communications on the diver, and suspending the diver from the surface so that depth is positively controlled, and by having an in-water standby diver attend the diver undergoing the treatment at all times.|$|E
5|$|An {{alternative}} to self-contained breathing systems is to supply breathing gases {{from the surface}} through a hose. When combined with a communication cable, a pneumofathometer hose and a safety line {{it is called the}} diver's umbilical, which may include a hot water hose for heating, video cable and breathing gas reclaim line. More basic equipment that uses only an air hose is called an airline or hookah system. This allows the diver to breathe using an air supply hose from a cylinder or compressor at the surface. Breathing gas is supplied through a mouth-held demand valve or light <b>full-face</b> mask. It is used for work such as hull cleaning and archaeological surveys, for shellfish harvesting, and as snuba, a shallow water activity typically practised by tourists and those who are not scuba-certified.|$|E
5|$|Oxygen {{toxicity}} is {{a catastrophic}} hazard in diving, because a seizure results in near certain death by drowning. The seizure may occur suddenly {{and with no}} warning symptoms. The effects are sudden convulsions and unconsciousness, during which victims can lose their regulator and drown. One {{of the advantages of}} a <b>full-face</b> diving mask is prevention of regulator loss {{in the event of a}} seizure. As there is an increased risk of central nervous system oxygen toxicity on deep dives, long dives and dives where oxygen-rich breathing gases are used, divers are taught to calculate a maximum operating depth for oxygen-rich breathing gases, and cylinders containing such mixtures must be clearly marked with that depth.|$|E
5|$|Surface {{supplied}} divers {{are usually}} required to carry an emergency gas supply sufficient {{to allow them}} to return to a place of safety if the main gas supply fails. The usual configuration is a back mounted single cylinder supported by the diver's safety harness, with first stage regulator connected by a low-pressure hose to a bailout block, which may be mounted {{on the side of the}} helmet or band-mask or on the harness to supply a lightweight <b>full-face</b> mask. Where the capacity of a single cylinder in insufficient, plain manifolded twins or a rebreather may be used. For closed bell bounce and saturation dives the bailout set must be compact enough to allow the diver to pass through the bottom hatch of the bell. This sets a limit on the size of cylinders that can be used.|$|E
5|$|Spreckels {{was already}} in {{correspondence}} with American authorities; in January 1883, the Director of the United States Mint, Horatio Burchard, had written to him explaining the laws under which the Mint could strike coins for foreign governments, and that although the coins could be struck at the San Francisco Mint, the dies for the coinage {{would have to be}} prepared at Philadelphia. He asked for sketches from Spreckels, who provided an obverse showing a <b>full-face</b> portrait of the king; this was submitted to Chief Engraver Charles E. Barber in Philadelphia, who rejected it as impractical. Barber recommended the king be shown in profile, and a suitable photograph was sent to him for use in preparing models of the proposed coins. Once the Mint received Spreckels' commission as agent, Acting Director Robert E. Preston wrote noting that the authorization called for 12 cent pieces, but that the Hawaiian law had called for coins identical in size, weight, and fineness to US coins, and there was no such denomination struck by the US Mint. He asked if ten-cent pieces were desired instead, but no answer was immediately forthcoming, and Barber finished preliminary designs, including the 12 cent piece.|$|E
25|$|Cylindrically curved faceplates such {{as those}} used for {{firefighting}} <b>full-face</b> masks produce severely distorted views underwater.|$|E
25|$|The {{methods of}} {{clearing}} differ between the conventional recreational diver's half mask, which covers {{the eyes and}} nose, and the <b>full-face</b> mask, which also covers the mouth.|$|E
25|$|Respiratory protection: use <b>full-face</b> air-purifying {{respirators}} with multi-purpose or type ABEK respirator cartridges as {{a backup}} to the engineering controls and when proper risk assessment recommends its usage.|$|E
25|$|In 1926 Maurice Fernez and Yves Le Prieur {{patented}} a hand-controlled {{constant flow}} regulator (not a demand valve), which used a <b>full-face</b> mask (the air escaping from the mask at constant flow).|$|E
25|$|Dry suits with {{adequate}} thermal undergarments are standard environmental protection for ice diving, though {{in some cases}} thick wetsuits may suffice. Hoods, boots and gloves are also worn. <b>Full-face</b> masks can provide more protection for the divers' facial skin.|$|E
25|$|The twin-hose {{arrangement}} with a mouthpiece or <b>full-face</b> mask {{is common in}} rebreathers, {{but as part of}} the breathing loop, not as part of a regulator. The associated demand valve comprising the bail-out valve is a single hose regulator.|$|E
25|$|Divers cannot talk {{underwater}} {{unless they}} are wearing a <b>full-face</b> mask and electronic communications equipment, but they can communicate basic and emergency information using hand signals, light signals, and rope signals, and more complex messages can be written on waterproof slates.|$|E
25|$|This {{system is}} unusual in that it used a single stage single hose demand valve in a <b>full-face</b> mask. The high {{pressure}} supply hose routes over the shoulder, but from an inverted cylinder, which allows the user to easily reach the valve.|$|E
25|$|In 1934 René Commeinhes, from Alsace (France), adapted a Rouquayrol-Denayrouze {{apparatus}} {{for the use}} of firefighters. With new 1937 and 1942 patents (GC37 and GC42), his son Georges adapted this invention to underwater breathing {{by means}} of a single hose connected to a <b>full-face</b> mask.|$|E
25|$|On 11 April 2011, a French woman S.A.S who {{regularly}} wore a <b>full-face</b> veil, lodged an application with the European Court of Human Rights against the French state, {{claiming that the}} law violated several of her human rights according to the European Convention on Human Rights (ECHR).|$|E
25|$|Several {{versions}} of the Le Prieur breathing set. Yves Le Prieur first patented with Maurice Fernez, in 1926, a breathing apparatus using a mouthpiece, but as of 1933 he removed the mouthpiece and included a circular <b>full-face</b> mask in all following patents (like 1937, 1946 or 1947).|$|E
25|$|The French government's {{claim that}} a ban of the use <b>full-face</b> veils was {{necessary}} for public safety was not found valid by the Court as it argued public safety concerns could be addressed by more limited restrictions which the Court had previously accepted; for instance the obligation to show the face for identification purposes in certain circumstances.|$|E
25|$|The chief {{difference}} between women's and men's ice hockey is that body checking {{is not allowed}} in women's hockey. After the 1990 Women's World Championship, body checking was eliminated in women's hockey. In current IIHF women's competition, body checking is either a minor or major penalty, decided at the referee's discretion. In addition, players in women's competition are required to wear protective <b>full-face</b> masks.|$|E
25|$|In {{conclusion}} {{the minority}} wrote «we {{find that the}} criminalization of the wearing of a <b>full-face</b> veil is a measure which is disproportionate to the aim of protecting the idea of “living together” – an aim which cannot readily be reconciled with the Convention’s restrictive catalogue of grounds for interference with basic human rights» and they concluded that the ban violated Articles 8 and 9.|$|E
25|$|Compared to scuba diving, {{dressing}} the diver in is {{a relatively}} laborious process, as the equipment is bulky and fairly heavy, and several components are connected together by hoses. This is more so with helmets, and less so with light <b>full-face</b> masks. It is not usual for the diver {{to do all the}} dressing in without the assistance of a diver's tender, who will also manage the umbilical during the dive.|$|E
25|$|The supply {{pressure}} {{must be in}} excess of minimum functional pressure for the regulator {{to be enough to}} get air to the diver. In practice a delivery pressure of about 20 bar is commonly used. The manufacturer of the helmet or <b>full-face</b> mask will specify a pressure range which will deliver sufficient air for a given dive depth, which is usually from 6 to 10 bar more than the ambient pressure due to depth.|$|E
25|$|Deployment of {{a single}} {{tethered}} scuba diver is a reasonably safe alternative to free-swimming buddy team diving. The tethered scuba diver {{is equipped with a}} <b>full-face</b> mask with voice communications, high capacity scuba air supply, and an independent emergency air supply. A lifeline with communications cable is secured to a body harness on the diver and is handled by a surface tender who is in constant voice communication with the diver. A similarly equipped standby diver is available on the surface.|$|E
25|$|The {{traditional}} {{gas mask}} style with two small circular eye windows originated {{when the only}} suitable material for these eye windows was glass or acrylic; as glass is notoriously brittle, glass eye windows had to be kept small and thick. Later, the discovery of polycarbonate allowed for gas masks with a large <b>full-face</b> window. Some {{have one or two}} filters attached to the face mask while others have a large filter connected to the face mask with a hose, that is sometimes confused with respirators.|$|E
25|$|The {{demand valve}} has a chamber, which in normal use {{contains}} breathing gas at ambient pressure. A valve which supplies medium pressure gas can vent into the chamber. Either a mouthpiece or a <b>full-face</b> mask {{is connected to}} the chamber for the diver to breathe from. The mouthpiece can be direct coupled or connected by a flexible low-pressure hose. On one side of the chamber is a flexible diaphragm to control the operation of the valve. The diaphragm is protected by a cover with holes or slits through which outside water can enter freely.|$|E
25|$|During {{his time}} as an illustrator, looking {{at a picture of}} Stig Blomqvist in his driver's overall and helmet, Bamber began to {{practice}} cartoon drawing of drivers in overalls and a <b>full-face</b> helmet, of whom Blomqvist was the first caricature drawn by Bamber. Rather than drawing faces of drivers, a common feature at the time, he shortcutted it by drawing a ball as a helmet and adding names above their visors to identify drivers. Bamber would continue to practice drawing drivers' caricatures, while working as an illustrator and as an Art Editor for Rallycourse yearbooks.|$|E
25|$|Under the {{supervision}} of Post Office design adviser Barry Robinson, Jeffery Matthews prepared alternative essays from March 1982 pictures of the Queen by Lord Snowdon. Matthews used many different positions {{of the head and}} shoulders, from profile to <b>full-face.</b> Essays with the latter position were designed from the photographic representation and from a portrait drawn by his son Rory Matthews. In 1983, Robinson ordered new portraits by different artists : drawn by John Sargeant, painted by Timothy Whidborne and Brian Sanders, later engraved by Czesław Słania in 1984. Harrisons and Sons printed these essays. However, they failed to please the Stamp Advisory Committee.|$|E
25|$|A <b>full-face</b> mask {{encloses}} both {{mouth and}} nose, which {{reduces the risk}} of the diver losing the air supply compared to a half mask and demand valve. Some models require a bailout block to provide alternative breathing gas supply from the umbilical and bailout cylinder, but are not suitable for accepting an alternative air supply from a rescue diver, while a few models accept a secondary demand valve which can be plugged into an accessory port (Draeger, Apeks and Ocean Reef). The unique Kirby Morgan 48 SuperMask has a removable DV pod which can be unclipped to allow the diver to breathe from a standard scuba demand valve with mouthpiece.|$|E
25|$|After {{capturing}} {{cities in}} Iraq, ISIL issued guidelines {{on how to}} wear clothes and veils. ISIL warned women {{in the city of}} Mosul to wear <b>full-face</b> veils or face severe punishment. A cleric told Reuters in Mosul that ISIL gunmen had ordered him to read out the warning in his mosque when worshippers gathered. ISIL ordered the faces of both male and female mannequins to be covered, in an order which also banned the use of naked mannequins. In Raqqa the group uses its two battalions of female fighters in the city to enforce compliance by women with its strict laws on individual conduct.|$|E
25|$|The gold-leaf {{shielding}} in Sunshine {{was influenced}} by NASA satellite designs for deflecting heat {{and other forms of}} radiant energy. Boyle designed the gold-coloured space suits along these lines despite persistent encouragement to model them after the NASA template. The helmets were designed to have cameras mounted in them. This further enhanced a sense of claustrophobia useful to the actors in delivering more heartfelt performances. The helmets were also limited to a horizontal slit for visibility instead of a <b>full-face</b> visor as further consideration toward protecting the characters from the ambient radiation of outer space. According to Boyle, the funnel shape of the helmet {{was influenced by}} the character Kenny from South Park.|$|E
25|$|The 2011 Hotan {{attack was}} a bomb-and-knife attack that {{occurred}} in Hotan, Xinjiang, China on July 18, 2011. According to witnesses, the assailants were a group of 18 young Uyghur men who opposed the local government's campaign against the <b>full-face</b> Islamic veil, which had grown popular among older Hotan women in 2009 but were also used {{in a series of}} violent crimes. The men occupied a police station on Nuerbage Street at noon, killing two security guards with knives and bombs and taking eight hostages. The attackers then yelled religious slogans, including ones associated with Jihadism, as they replaced the Chinese flag on top of a police station with another flag, the identity of which is disputed.|$|E
25|$|On October 28, 2005, Game {{was charged}} with disorderly conduct and {{resisting}} arrest in Greensboro, North Carolina. At one point, police said his companions were pepper sprayed when they surrounded officers in a threatening manner. Mall security officers said the rapper was wearing a <b>full-face</b> Halloween mask, filming shoppers, cursed loudly, and refused to leave when asked. Game continued to act up and was arrested, a police statement said. Game claimed that officers overreacted {{and that he did}} nothing wrong when he was pepper-sprayed by the mall security. The five officers involved in the incident ended up suing Game for defamation. The officers were awarded $5 million in compensatory damages, which was upheld on appeal by the North Carolina Court of Appeals in February 2012.|$|E
25|$|Several {{types of}} <b>full-face</b> mask exist, and the {{procedure}} for clearing them depends on the construction. They will automatically drain through the exhaust port of the demand valve provided the water can get to it, {{but this is not}} always possible, and in models which use an internal mouthpiece, the procedure is the same as with a half mask. Models which use an oral/nasal internal seal will usually drain to the demand valve or an additional drain valve at a low point when the diver's face is roughly upright or face down, and these will clear during normal breathing for small leaks, and may be cleared of major flooding by using the purge button on the demand valve to fill the mask with air.|$|E
25|$|The {{methods of}} {{clearing}} differ between the half mask, which covers {{the eyes and}} nose, and the <b>full-face</b> mask, which also covers the mouth. If the mask has a purge valve and the strap tension is correct, the diver holds the head so that the valve is at the lowest point and exhales through the nose. If the mask is a good fit on the diver's face and the strap is correctly placed, exhaling through the nose will usually drive water out along the bottom edge of the skirt. It {{may be necessary to}} press {{the upper part of the}} mask against the face to improve the seal if the diver is rolled to one side. If the fit is not perfect, or the strap is too low, contact pressure of the top edge against the forehead may be insufficient to maintain a seal when the head is upright.|$|E
25|$|Small {{variations}} in pressure between the delivered gas and the ambient pressure at the lungs can be tolerated. These {{can result from}} the trim of the diver in the water, {{the position of the}} diaphragm operating the demand valve, the position of the counterlungs in a rebreather, cracking pressure and flow resistance of the exhaust valve, or intentional overpressure in a <b>full-face</b> mask or helmet, intended {{to reduce the risk of}} contaminated water leaking into the breathing apparatus through the exhaust valve. A consistent variation in delivered pressure difference does not affect the work of breathing - the whole graph is shifted up or down without change to the enclosed area - but the effort required for inhalation and exhalation are perceptibly different from normal, and if excessive, may make it difficult or impossible to breathe. Free-flow systems inherently operate under a positive pressure relative to the head, to allow controlled exhaust flow, but not necessarily to the lungs in the upright diver. Snorkel breathing is inherently negative pressure breathing, as the lungs of the swimmer are at least partly below the surface of the water.|$|E
25|$|The {{original}} {{communication between}} diver and attendant was by pulls on the diver's lifeline. Later a speaking tube system was tried, {{but it was}} not very successful. A small number were made by Seibe-Gorman, but the telephone system was introduced soon after this and since it worked better and was safer, the speaking tube was soon obsolete, and most helmets which had them were returned to the factory and converted. In the early 20th century electrical telephone systems were developed which improved the quality of voice communication. These used wires incorporated into the lifeline or air line, and used either headsets worn inside the helmet or speakers mounted inside the helmet. The microphone could be mounted {{in the front of the}} helmet or a contact throat-microphone could be used. At first it was only possible for the diver to talk to the surface telephonist, but later double telephone systems were introduced which allowed two-divers to speak directly to each other, while being monitored by the attendant. Diver telephones were manufactured by Siebe-Gorman, Heinke, Rene Piel, Morse, Eriksson, Draeger and others. This system was well-established by the mid-20th century, and has been technologically improved, but is still in common use for surface-supplied divers using lightweight demand helmets and <b>full-face</b> masks.|$|E
500|$|The carving on the Camus Cross shows {{distinct}} similarities {{with those}} on the Brechin Hogback stone and point to an Irish Ecclesiastical influence. The foliar designs on {{the north and south}} edges, originally seen as Ringerike-like (and hence, Scandinavian in origin), consist of tendrils and volutes with [...] "wave-crest" [...] thickening. These features bear closest similarity with Irish insular art of the late tenth century, and the treatment of the symmetrical foliar scroll design on the lower portion of the west face is diagnostically Irish. The <b>full-face</b> figures on the east face are of an identical type to {{those on the}} Brechin Hogback. In the case of the Brechin Hogback, the figures are carrying objects that are characteristic of early medieval Irish monasticism.|$|E
