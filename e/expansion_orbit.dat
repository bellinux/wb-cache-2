40|$|Evolutionary {{change in}} encephalization {{within and across}} {{mammalian}} clades is well-studied, yet relatively few comparative analyses attempt to quantify the impact of evolutionary change in relative brain size on cranial morphology. Because of {{the proximity of the}} braincase to the orbits, and the inter-relationships among ecology, sensory systems and neuroanatomy, a relationship has been hypothesized between orbit orientation and encephalization for mammals. Here, we tested this hypothesis in 68 fossil and living species of the mammalian order Carnivora, comparing orbit orientation angles (convergence and frontation) to skull length and encephalization. No significant correlations were observed between skull length and orbit orientation when all taxa were analysed. Significant correlations were observed between encephalization and orbit orientation; however, these were restricted to the families Felidae and Canidae. Encephalization is positively correlated with frontation in both families and negatively correlated with convergence in canids.

40|$|The {{magnetic}} moment of a particle orbiting a straight current-carrying wire may precess rapidly {{enough in the}} wire's magnetic field to justify an adiabatic approximation, eliminating the rapid time dependence of the {{magnetic moment}} and leaving only the particle position as a slow degree of freedom. To zeroth order in the adiabatic <b>expansion,</b> the <b>orbits</b> of the particle in the plane perpendicular to the wire are Keplerian ellipses. Higher order post-adiabatic corrections make the orbits precess, but recent analysis of this `vector Kepler problem' {{has shown that the}} effective Hamiltonian incorporating a post-adiabatic scalar potential (`geometric electromagnetism') fails to predict the precession correctly, while a heuristic alternative succeeds. In this paper we resolve the apparent failure of the post-adiabatic approximation, by pointing out that the correct second-order analysis produces a third Hamiltonian, in which geometric electromagnetism is supplemented by a tensor potential. The heuristic Hamiltonian of Schmiedmayer and Scrinzi is then shown to be a canonical transformation of the correct adiabatic Hamiltonian, to second order. The transformation has the important advantage of removing a $ 1 /r^ 3 $ singularity which is an artifact of the adiabatic approximation. Comment: 9 pages, 10 figure...|$|R

40|$|This {{thesis is}} {{concerned}} with the application and extension of semiclassical methods, involving correlated trajectories, that were recently developed to explain the observed universal statistics of classically chaotic quantum systems. First we consider systems that depend on an external parameter that does not change the symmetry of the system. 'Ve study correlations between the spectra at different values of the param~ter, a scaled distance x apart, via the parametric spectral form factor K(r, x). Using a semiclassical periodic <b>orbit</b> <b>expansion,</b> we obtain a small r expansion that agrees with random matrix theory for systems with and without time reversal symmetry. Then we consider correlations of the Wigner time delay in open systems. We study a form factor K (r, x, y, M) that depends on the number of scattering channels M, the non-symmetry breaking parameter difference x and also a symmetry breaking parameter y. TheWigner time delay can be expressed semiclassically in terms of the trapped periodic orbits of the system, and using a periodic <b>orbit</b> <b>expansion</b> we obtain several terms in the small r expansion of the form factor that are identical to those calculated from random matrix theory. The Wigner time delay can also be expressed in terms of scattering trajectories that enter and leave the system. Starting from this picture, we derive all terms in the periodic orbit formula and therefore show how the two pictures of the time delay are related on a semiclassical level. A new type of trajectory correlation is derived which recreates the terms from the trapped periodic orbits. This involves two trajectories approaching the same trapped periodic orbit closely - one trajectory approaches the orbit and follows it for several traversals, while its partner approaches in almost the same way but follows the periodic orbit an additional number of times.
