500|$|At the 2015 IPC Athletics World Championships in Doha, Ballard {{won gold}} medals in the Women's 200m T53 in a {{championship}} record time of 29.33 and the Women's 400m T53. After winning the 400m, Ballard said: [...] "This is the one I wanted. I was so nervous coming in, you try and tell yourself that {{the worst thing that}} can happen is a loss and starting again tomorrow, {{but the reality is that}} this matters so much. <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>so</b> <b>scared</b> before the race, perhaps it gave me the adrenalin to get it done. I’ve just worked so hard for this for so long." [...] She also won a bronze medal in the Women's 800mm T54 behind gold medallist Madison de Rozario.|$|E
500|$|He was {{a member}} of the Kappa Sigma fraternity. Nashville sportswriter Fred Russell, who entered Vanderbilt in 1924, told a story about Bomar in his {{autobiography}} Bury Me In An Old Press Box: [...] "As a freshman I had pledged Kappa Sigma fraternity, which at that time had many varsity athletes. Among them was Lynn Bomar, selected All-American end in 1923... I also had the responsibility, as a freshman, of awakening Bomar in time for him to get to classes, and at the end of the school year I did this one morning by rolling the biggest lighted firecracker I ever saw under his bed. When it exploded I feared the whole corner of the fraternity house had been blown off, and <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>so</b> <b>scared</b> that even Bomar in his BVD's chasing me across the street and deep into the campus couldn't catch me." ...|$|E
500|$|People's {{reactions}} varied: some {{described themselves}} as [...] "shocked"; others admitted to being [...] "shaky" [...] or nervous {{for the rest of}} the day. Harold Kittinger, a worker at the Suntone Factory, said, [...] "I do not care to tell anyone I was frightened. But I was not shaking in my shoes. My shoes were moving." [...] One woman hypothesized that the shaking was a [...] "bomb". Grace Standerfer suggested the earthquake was sudden, saying, [...] "I was just scared to death. My husband and I were in the house. The Venetian shades began to shake one way, then another. When that awful blast came, he grabbed me and we ran outside. Things were falling and breaking in the house. I said to him, 'This is it.' I thought the world had come to an end. Outside, wires were moving. There was no wind. The ground was quivering under our feet. <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>so</b> <b>scared.</b> I did not know I was scared." [...] People in the community of Mount Vernon, Illinois, were frightened by the shaking. However, some did not notice the earthquake; Jane Bessen said her party was [...] "in a car... to Evansville and didn't know about it until we got there".|$|E
6000|$|... "Do I {{look as if}} they did? <b>I</b> <b>was</b> never <b>so</b> <b>scared</b> in my life. Timothy McManus himself couldn't {{have caught}} me that day. But what {{happened}} afterward? I heard they had a fearful roughhouse, but I couldn't stop to see." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{know they}} do. That's the Methodist way {{and it is}} all right for them. I haven't a word to say against Methodists. My Aunt Jane <b>was</b> one, and <b>I</b> might have <b>been</b> one myself if <b>I</b> hadn't <b>been</b> <b>so</b> <b>scared</b> of the Judgment Day. But you ain't a Methodist. You're a Presbyterian, ain't you?" ...|$|R
5000|$|A {{girlfriend of}} mine in college {{referred}} me to the man that was putting the group together. <b>I</b> honestly <b>was</b> <b>so</b> <b>scared</b> to sing and I didn't even know a song to sing at the audition so I sang [...] "Jesus Loves Me". I remember them saying [...] "we can work with her tone because she has the right look {{and she is a}} model that break dances". <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>so</b> thankful to this day for that experience because I do not think I would have ever gotten the role in Pitch Perfect if I hadn't overcome my fear to open my mouth and sing.|$|R
2500|$|Jones {{described}} {{his childhood in}} Sports Illustrated: [...] "After a while I didn't care about gettin' hurt or dyin' anymore. I was in pain all day, every day, <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>so</b> <b>scared</b> of my father. He'd pull up in his truck and start lookin' for something I'd done wrong. There was no escape, no excuse, no way out of nothin'. ... Getting' hurt or dyin' might've been better than the life I was livin'. ... Used to think about killin' myself anyway." ...|$|E

5000|$|Schoen {{also wrote}} many of Count Basie's earlier {{arrangements}} in the mid-1930s. He {{commented on the}} time when Basie paid him for some of his arrangements: [...] "He owed me some money one night after a gig. I had written several arrangements for him and he paid me one hundred dollars in single dollar bills. I walked out of that Harlem club with the biggest wad of cash in my pocket. <b>I</b> had never <b>been</b> <b>so</b> <b>scared</b> in my life." ...|$|R
5000|$|Cameron's brother {{passed away}} {{at a young age}} at 31, and Cameron himself {{believed}} {{that he was going to}} die young like his brother due to heart complications and several heart problems. In an interview, he told The Sun newspaper that [...] "I woke up during the night thinking <b>I</b> <b>was</b> having a heart attack. <b>I</b> <b>was</b> having <b>so</b> much pain from the middle of my chest it felt like someone was sitting on me. It’s the first time I’ve ever been an emergency admission and <b>I</b> have never <b>been</b> <b>so</b> <b>scared</b> in all my life". Cameron went onto say that he “genuinely thought <b>I</b> <b>was</b> going to die that night. The pain just got worse and worse and worse".|$|R
60|$|In {{another moment}} the guide {{disappeared}} behind the deluge, and, bewildered by the thunder, driven helplessly by the wind, and smitten by the arrowy tempest of rain, <b>I</b> followed. All <b>was</b> darkness. Such a mad storming, roaring, and bellowing of warring {{wind and water}} never crazed my ears before. I bent my head, and seemed to receive the Atlantic on my back. The world seemed going to destruction. I could not see anything, the flood poured down savagely. I raised my head, with open mouth, and {{the most of the}} American cataract went down my throat. If I had sprung a leak now <b>I</b> had <b>been</b> lost. And at this moment I discovered that the bridge had ceased, and we must trust for a foothold to the slippery and precipitous rocks. <b>I</b> never <b>was</b> <b>so</b> <b>scared</b> before and survived it. But we got through at last, and emerged into the open day, where we could {{stand in front of the}} laced and frothy and seething world of descending water, and look at it. When I saw how much of it there was, and how fearfully in earnest it <b>was,</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> sorry <b>I</b> had gone behind it.|$|R
6000|$|... "It was {{all black}} in the ice-house, and <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>so</b> <b>scared</b> I didn't call her, but she saw me; and she will see me now, no matter how dark it is," [...] {{returned}} confiding Rob, standing up to peer into the gloom for the help which never failed him.|$|E
6000|$|... "I hadn't {{got into}} the thrilling part of it when {{suddenly}} I {{heard the sound of}} somebody's coming through the bushes, and before I could open my mouth to yell, who should show himself but that miserable dog Towser!

6000|$|... "Huck, it was awful!

6000|$|... "Not exactly that, captain, for we {{have not}} been near the others at all.

The first because <b>I</b> have <b>been</b> <b>so</b> badly <b>scared</b> by a snake, who would have bit me had not this young fellow leaped on to its back just as he was about to strike me in the neck, that I would not have slept on the ground for anything; and, in the second place, we came to tell you that from the top of the hill we saw a large frigate--English, I should say, from the cut of her sails--five or six miles off on the other side of the island, and I thought you ought to know about her at once." ...|$|R
40|$|I {{teach people}} to use library {{resources}} more effectively; however, the skills I’ll talk about below are useful when working with any adult audiences. This is not a comprehensive guide to teaching or public speaking, rather, it is a summary {{of some of the}} main ideas and practices that help me. <b>I</b> used to <b>be</b> <b>so</b> <b>scared</b> when <b>I</b> talked in front of other people — even {{a small group of people}} — that I would turn bright red and break out in a sweat. I couldn’t look people in the eye; I read from my notes; I stumbled over my words. I even walked out of an oral exam in graduate school because <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>so</b> nervous that my mind went totally blank! Today, however, <b>I</b> <b>am</b> capable of being a good speaker, trainer or teacher in group settings. I say “capable of,” because this still doesn’t come naturally to me. Rather, it <b>is</b> something <b>I</b> have learned how to do well — with the appropriate amount of preparation. I still envy those people who are perfectly comfortable “winging it” in front of an audience. I don’t always think they make the best teachers or trainers, but I would gladly replace my anxiety with their ease. Nevertheless, I firmly believe that if I learned how, anyone can...|$|R
5000|$|According to the {{original}} Etemaad story, one of the boyfriends recalls the events in this way: [...] "In an instant, three young men approached us in a threatening manner and said some horrible things to us. Then, Mohammad, one of those men, attacked us with a rock. Samieh got off of my motorcycle and approached the men to fight them. Roozbeh and <b>I</b> <b>were</b> both <b>scared,</b> <b>so</b> we got on our motorcycles to flee, and just as we got on our bikes, I {{saw one of the}} men on the ground bleeding." [...] No source has reported what independent witnesses said about the encounter. The Etemaad news story also reports {{that at the time of}} the attack, Fatehi was a runaway who was disowned by her family; however, a phone interview with Fatehi's mother is reported to have shown that her mother displayed great concern about her daughter's fate, and that she tearfully pleaded for her daughter's life. In the same interview, Nazanin's mother reportedly confirmed that she had asked the mother of the deceased man for pardon, but that she had been refused.|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh, Miss Gray!" [...] he gasped. [...] "I guess Old Lady Lloyd {{has gone}} clean crazy at last. The minister's wife {{asked me to}} run up to the Old Lady, with a message about the Sewing Circle--and I knocked--and knocked--and nobody came--so I thought I'd just step in and leave the letter on the table. But when I opened the door, I heard an awful queer laugh in the sitting-room, and next minute, the Old Lady came to the sitting-room door. Oh, Miss Gray, she looked awful. Her face was red and her eyes awful wild--and she was muttering and talking to herself and {{laughing}} like mad. <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>so</b> <b>scared</b> I just turned and run." ...|$|E
6000|$|I {{could not}} speak, <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>so</b> <b>scared.</b> I knew {{that with his}} notions about the human race Satan would {{consider}} it a matter of no consequence to strike her dead, there being [...] "plenty more"; but my tongue stood still, I could give her no warning. But nothing happened; Satan remained tranquil--tranquil and indifferent. I suppose {{he could not be}} insulted by Ursula any more than the king could be insulted by a tumble-bug. The old woman jumped to her feet when she made her remark, and did it as briskly as a young girl. It had been many years since she had done the like of that. That was Satan's influence; he was a fresh breeze to the weak and the sick, wherever he came. His presence affected even the lean kitten, and it skipped to the ground and began to chase a leaf. This surprised Ursula, and she stood looking at the creature and nodding her head wonderingly, her anger quite forgotten.|$|E
6000|$|... "There warn't nobody {{stirring}} anywhere, and {{the boat}} was slipping along, swift and steady, through the big water in the smoky moonlight. We never said a word, but went straight up onto the hurricane-deck and plumb back aft, and set down {{on the end of}} the sky-light. Both of us knowed what that meant, without having to explain to one another. Bud Dixon would wake up and miss the swag, and would come straight for us, for he ain't afeard of anything or anybody, that man ain't. He would come, and we would heave him overboard, or get killed trying. It made me shiver, because I ain't as brave as some people, but if I showed the white feather--well, I knowed better than do that. I kind of hoped the boat would land somers, and we could skip ashore and not have to run the risk of this row, <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>so</b> <b>scared</b> of Bud Dixon, but she was an upper-river tub and there warn't no real chance of that.|$|E
6000|$|But {{it made us}} turn {{cold and}} creepy just to think of it, and we said we wouldn't budge. <b>So</b> Tom <b>was</b> for {{slipping}} back there by himself {{to see if he}} couldn't get at the steering-gear and land the ship. We begged and begged him not to, but it warn't no use; so he got down on his hands and knees, and begun to crawl an inch at a time, we a-holding our breath and watching. After he got {{to the middle of the}} boat he crept slower than ever, and it did seem like years to me. But at last we see him get to the professor's head, and sort of raise up soft and look a good spell in his face and listen. Then we see him begin to inch along again toward the professor's feet where the steering-buttons was. Well, he got there all safe, and was reaching slow and steady toward the buttons, but he knocked down something that made a noise, and we see him slump down flat an' soft in the bottom, and lay still. The professor stirred, and says, [...] "What's that?" [...] But everybody kept dead still and quiet, and he begun to mutter and mumble and nestle, like a person that's going to wake up, and <b>I</b> thought <b>I</b> <b>was</b> going to die, <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>so</b> worried and <b>scared.</b>|$|R
6000|$|... "Uncle Roger can laugh," [...] said Cecily, with a quiver in her voice, [...] "but it's no {{laughing}} matter to <b>be</b> <b>so</b> <b>scared.</b> <b>I</b> just feel sick, <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>so</b> frightened." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Nay! {{why should}} you <b>be</b> <b>so</b> <b>scared,</b> sir?" [...] {{continued}} Sir Percy lazily, [...] "did you think <b>I</b> <b>was</b> drunk?... <b>I</b> assure you, sir, on my honour, <b>I</b> <b>am</b> not <b>so</b> drunk as you think I am." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Friends, I thank you," [...] {{the pale}} and {{resolute}} author weakly began. [...] "I didn't know I {{had so many}} friends in the world. Two minutes ago <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>so</b> <b>scared</b> my teeth chattered. Now I am entirely at my ease--you notice that." [...] The little ripple of laughter which followed this remark really gave him time to think--gave him courage. [...] "I feel that I am at last {{face to face with}} an audience that knows my work--that is ready to support a serious attempt at playwriting. I claim that a play may do something more than amuse--it may interest. There is a wide difference, you will see. To be an amusement merely is to degrade our stage {{to the level of a}} Punch-and-Judy show. I am sorry for tired men and weary women, but as a dramatist I can't afford to take their troubles into account. I am writing for those who are mentally alert and willing to support plays that have at least the dignity of intention which lies in our best novels. This does not mean gloomy plays or problem plays, but it does mean conscientious study of American life. If you like me as well after the close of the play"--he made dramatic pause--"well I shall not be able to sleep to-night. I sincerely thank you. You have given me a fair hearing--that is all I can ask--and I am very grateful." ...|$|E
6000|$|But he {{was gone}} now, so {{it was time for}} us to follow. I heard a big shout, and turned around--the city was {{dropping}} from under us like a shot! It made me sick all through, <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>so</b> <b>scared.</b> Jim turned gray and couldn't say a word, and Tom didn't say nothing, but looked excited. The city went on dropping down, and down, and down; but we didn't seem to be doing nothing but just hang in the air and stand still. The houses got smaller and smaller, and the city pulled itself together, closer and closer, and the men and wagons got to looking like ants and bugs crawling around, and the streets like threads and cracks; and then it all kind of melted together, and there wasn't any city any more it was only a big scar on the earth, {{and it seemed to me}} a body could see up the river and down the river about a thousand miles, though of course it wasn't so much. By and by the earth was a ball--just a round ball, of a dull color, with shiny stripes wriggling and winding around over it, which was rivers. The Widder Douglas always told me the earth was round like a ball, but I never took any stock in a lot of them superstitions o' hers, and of course I paid no attention to that one, because I could see myself that the world was the shape of a plate, and flat. I used to go up on the hill, and take a look around and prove it for myself, because I reckon the best way to get a sure thing on a fact is to go and examine for yourself, and not take anybody's say-so. But I had to give in now that the widder was right. That is, she was right as to the rest of the world, but she warn't right about the part our village is in; that part is the shape of a plate, and flat, I take my oath! ...|$|E
6000|$|Once I said {{to myself}} {{it would be a}} {{thousand}} times better for Jim to be a slave at home where his family was, as long as he'd GOT to be a slave, and so I'd better write a letter to Tom Sawyer and tell him to tell Miss Watson where he was. But I soon give up that notion for two things: she'd be mad and disgusted at his rascality and ungratefulness for leaving her, and so she'd sell him straight down the river again; and if she didn't, everybody naturally despises an ungrateful nigger, and they'd make Jim feel it all the time, and so he'd feel ornery and disgraced. And then think of ME! It would get all around that Huck Finn helped a nigger to get his freedom; and if I was ever to see anybody from that town again I'd be ready to get down and lick his boots for shame. That's just the way: a person does a low-down thing, and then he don't want to take no consequences of it. Thinks {{as long as he can}} hide it, it ain't no disgrace. That was my fix exactly. The more I studied about this the more my conscience went to grinding me, and the more wicked and low-down and ornery I got to feeling. And at last, when it hit me all of a sudden that here was the plain hand of Providence slapping me in the face and letting me know my wickedness was being watched all the time from up there in heaven, whilst I was stealing a poor old woman's nigger that hadn't ever done me no harm, and now was showing me there's One that's always on the lookout, and ain't a-going to allow no such miserable doings to go only just so fur and no further, I most dropped in my tracks <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>so</b> <b>scared.</b> Well, I tried the best I could to kinder soften it up somehow for myself by saying I was brung up wicked, and so I warn't so much to blame; but something inside of me kept saying, [...] "There was the Sunday-school, you could a gone to it; and if you'd a done it they'd a learnt you there that people that acts as I'd been acting about that nigger goes to everlasting fire." ...|$|E
