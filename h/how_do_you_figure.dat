Can you imagine how you'd cringe if the film ended in a flashback of little Mickey undergoing childhood trauma? There is some human behavior beyond our ability to comprehend. I was reading a theory the other day that a few people just happen to be pure evil. I'm afraid I believe it. They lack any conscience, any sense of pity or empathy for their victims.

She stops to pose a ques-tion, “What does popularity mean? ” The room is silent {{for a few moments}} as the 9 - and 10 -year-olds put their minds to work. Antonio, a student known more for the frequency of his answers than their accuracy, raises his hand. “It’s like something about the president. ” “OK,” Ms. Jenkins notes. “Can anyone add to what Antonio said?” Ms. Jenkins faces a sea of furrowed brows and blank stares. She glances at {{the clock on the wall}} and begins to wonder if they will make it through the text before lunch.
