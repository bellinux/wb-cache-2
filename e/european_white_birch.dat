5|$|Betula pendula, {{commonly}} known as silver birch, warty birch or East Asian white birch, is a species of tree in the family Betulaceae, native to Europe and parts of Asia, though in southern Europe it is only found at higher altitudes. Its range extends into Siberia, China and southwest Asia {{in the mountains of}} northern Turkey, the Caucasus and northern Iran. It has been introduced into North America, where it is known as the <b>European</b> <b>white</b> <b>birch,</b> and is considered invasive in some states in the United States and in parts of Canada. The tree can also be found in more temperate regions of Australia.|$|E
500|$|The {{silver birch}} grows {{naturally}} from western Europe eastwards to Kazakhstan, the Sakha Republic in Siberia, Mongolia and the Xinjiang province in China, and southwards {{to the mountains}} of the Caucasus and northern Iran, Iraq and Turkey. It is also native to northern Morocco and has become naturalised in some {{other parts of the}} world. In the southern parts of its range it is mainly found in mountainous regions. Its light seeds are easily blown by the wind and it is a pioneer species, one of the first trees to sprout on bare land or after a forest fire. It needs plenty of light and does best on dry, acid soils and is found on heathland, mountainsides and clinging to crags. Its tolerance to pollution make it suitable for planting in industrial areas and exposed sites.

40|$|ABSTRACT: <b>European</b> <b>white</b> <b>birch</b> (Betula pubescens) {{and silver}} birch (B. pendula) are {{important}} tree species for Finnish pulp and wood-products industries. Moose (Alces alces) damage, however, reduces {{the quality of}} butt logs intended for high-quality plywood and saw logs. In addition to flaws in stem form, pith discoloration and color change outside the pith reduce quality and value of logs irrespective of their end use. Our objectives were to 1) analyze the external and internal quality of birch trees damaged by moose, 2) measure whether the severity, type, and occurrence of damage dif-fered between silver birch and <b>European</b> <b>white</b> <b>birch</b> trees, and 3) evaluate visual criteria that would enable a forest-owner to assess damage and future value of moose-damaged birch trees prior to the first commercial thinning. We sampled 4 stands with a known history of moose damage; 18 trees per stand were classified by visual evaluation into 3 damage categories. The severity and type of damage lowering the internal quality of logs from sample trees were classified into 5 grades. The proportion of all visible color defects and/or decay was 74 % in silver birch trees and 67 % in white birch trees. Moose damage caused no visible color defect and/or decay in 35 % of silver birch and 33 % of white birch trees. The commercial quality and value of birch trees damaged by moose was reduced by the internal color defects and/or decay, even in certain trees without obvious external moose damage. Nev-ertheless, forest-owners can evaluate the internal quality of most birch trees in order to remove those of low-quality in the first commercial thinning by using external quality indicators of moose-damaged stems (e. g., stem form and clear curve {{at the point of}} stem breakage).

40|$|The {{coordinate}} {{appearance of}} the bispecific NAD(P) H-nitrate reductase (NR; EC 1. 6. 6. 2) and nitrite reductase (NiR; EC 1. 7. 7. 1) was investigated in leaves and roots from <b>European</b> <b>white</b> <b>birch</b> seedlings (Betula pendula Roth). Induction by nitrate and light of both enzymes was analyzed by in vitro assays and by measuring NR- and NiR-encoding mRNA pools with homologous cDNAs as probes. When birch seedlings were grown on a medium containing ammonium as the sole nitrogen source, low constitutive expression of NR and NiR was observed in leaves, whereas only NiR was significantly expressed in roots. Upon transfer of the seedlings to a nitrate-containing medium, mRNA pools and activities of NR and NiR dramatically increased in leaves and roots, with a more rapid induction in leaves. Peak accumulations of mRNA pools preceded the maximum activities of NR and NiR, suggesting that the appearance of both activities can be mainly attributed to an increased expression of NR and NiR genes. Expression of NR was strictly light-dependent in leaves and roots and was repressed by ammonium in roots but not in leaves. In contrast with NR, constitutive expression of NiR was not affected by light, and even a slight induction following the addition of nitrate {{was found in the}} dark in roots but not in leaves. No effect of ammonium on NiR expression was detectable in both organs. In leaves as well as in roots, NiR was induced more rapidly than NR, which appears to be a safety measure to prevent nitrite accumulation...|$|E
40|$|Abstract Background Bet v 1 is an {{important}} cause of hay fever in northern Europe. Bet v 1 isoforms from the <b>European</b> <b>white</b> <b>birch</b> (Betula pendula) have been investigated extensively, but the allergenic potency of other birch species is unknown. The presence of Bet v 1 and closely related PR- 10 genes in the genome was established by amplification and sequencing of alleles from eight birch species that represent the four subgenera within the genus Betula. Q-TOF LC-MS E was applied to identify which PR- 10 /Bet v 1 genes are actually expressed in pollen and to determine the relative abundances of individual isoforms in the pollen proteome. Results All examined birch species contained several PR- 10 genes. In total, 134 unique sequences were recovered. Sequences were attributed to different genes or pseudogenes that were, in turn, ordered into seven subfamilies. Five subfamilies were common to all birch species. Genes of two subfamilies were expressed in pollen, while each birch species expressed a mixture of isoforms with at least four different isoforms. Isoforms that were similar to isoforms with a high IgE-reactivity (Bet v 1 a = PR- 10. 01 A 01) were abundant in all species except B. lenta, while the hypoallergenic isoform Bet v 1 d (= PR- 10. 01 B 01) was only found in B. pendula and its closest relatives.

40|$|Abstract Background Pollen of the <b>European</b> <b>white</b> <b>birch</b> (Betula pendula, syn. B. verrucosa) is an {{important}} cause of hay fever. The main allergen is Bet v 1, member of the pathogenesis-related class 10 (PR- 10) multigene family. To establish the number of PR- 10 /Bet v 1 genes and the isoform diversity within a single tree, PCR amplification, cloning and sequencing of PR- 10 genes was performed on two diploid B. pendula cultivars and one interspecific tetraploid Betula hybrid. Sequences were attributed to putative genes based on sequence identity and intron length. Information on transcription was derived by comparison with homologous cDNA sequences available in GenBank/EMBL/DDJB. PCR-cloning of multigene families {{is accompanied by a}} high risk for the occurrence of PCR recombination artifacts. We screened for and excluded these artifacts, and also detected putative artifact sequences among database sequences. Results Forty-four different PR- 10 sequences were recovered from B. pendula and assigned to thirteen putative genes. Sequence homology suggests that three genes were transcribed in somatic tissue and seven genes in pollen. The transcription of three other genes remains unknown. In total, fourteen different Bet v 1 -type isoforms were identified in the three cultivars, of which nine isoforms were entirely new. Isoforms with high and low IgE-reactivity are encoded by different genes and one birch pollen grain has the genetic background to produce a mixture of isoforms with varying IgE-reactivity. Allergen diversity is even higher in the interspecific tetraploid hybrid, consistent with the presence of two genomes. Conclusion Isoforms of the major birch allergen Bet v 1 are encoded by multiple genes, and we propose to name them accordingly. The present characterization of the Bet v 1 genes provides a framework for the screening of specific Bet v 1 genes among other B. pendula cultivars or Betula species, and for future breeding for trees with a reduced allergenicity. Investigations towards sensitization and immunotherapy should anticipate that patients are exposed to a mixture of Bet v 1 isoforms of different IgE-reactivity, even if pollen originates from a single birch tree. </p...|$|E
