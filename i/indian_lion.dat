50|$|Reginald Innes Pocock (1939) {{mentioned}} {{that some people}} had the opinion that the tiger {{played a role in}} the near-extinction of the <b>Indian</b> <b>lion,</b> but he dismissed this view as 'fanciful'. According to him, there was evidence that tigers inhabited the Subcontinent, before lions. The tigers likely entered Northern India from the eastern end of the Himalayas, through Burma, and started spreading throughout the area, before the lions likely entered Northern India from Balochistan or Persia, and spread to places like the Bengal and the Nerbudda River. Because of that, before the presence of man could limit the spread of lions, tigers reached parts of India that lions did not reach. However, the presence of tigers throughout India did not stop the spread of lions there, in the first place, so Pocock said that it is unlikely that Bengal tigers played a role, significant or subordinate, in the near-extinction of the <b>Indian</b> <b>lion,</b> rather, that man was responsible for it, as was the case with the decline in tigers' numbers. As such, Pocock (1939) thought that it was unlikely that serious competition between them regularly occurred, and that even if Indian lions and tigers met, the chance that they would fight for survival was as good as the chance that they would choose to avoid each other, and that their chances of success, if they were to clash, were as good as each other's.|$|E

5000|$|The {{possibility}} of conflict, between lions and tigers, {{has been raised}} in relation to India's Asiatic Lion Reintroduction Project, which is meant to introduce Gir Forest's lions to another reserve which {{is considered to be}} within the former range of the <b>Indian</b> <b>lion,</b> that is Kuno Wildlife Sanctuary in Madhya Pradesh, which was reported to contain some tigers that came from Ranthambore Park, including one called 'T-38'. Concerns were raised that the co-presence of lions and tigers would [...] "trigger frequent clashes." [...] The University of Minnesota's Lion Research Project describes one reason to delay the introduction of lions to Kuno Palpur, is the fear that tigers living there would kill the incoming lions. In a one-on-one encounter, it is believed that a Bengal tiger could beat an <b>Indian</b> <b>lion,</b> given its weight advantage. However, lions are social, and may form fighting groups, whereas tigers are usually solitary, and it is believed that a group of lions (2 - 3 males) or lionesses (2 - 4 females) is more than match for a single tiger or tigress (See the Section Temperament below). Therefore, it would appear that in order for Asiatic lions to survive in an area with Bengal tigers, after being translocated there, the lions would have to be translocated there as intact groups, rather than as individuals, according to Doctor Craig Packer. Nevertheless, tigers occasionally socialize, like for the purpose of mating, or forming hunting groups.|$|E

50|$|In India, {{or in the}} {{extended}} modern sense, the Subcontinent, Asiatic lions and Bengal tigers coexisted {{in a number of}} places, such as the area of Gwalior in the center, and that of Mount Abu (which has a sanctuary) in the north, {{before the end of the}} 20th Century. Kailash Sankhala (1978) said that the habitat and prey of the <b>Indian</b> <b>lion</b> was not like those of an African savannah, but like habitats of Indian tigers, to an extent, including the dry, deciduous Aravali part of Sariska Tiger Reserve in the State of Rajasthan, and that it was a difficult place for predators to hunt as groups. Today, lions are found in Gir Forest National Park and surrounding areas in the region of Saurashtra, State of Gujarat, and tigers are found in other places, like Sariska Tiger Reserve and Ranthambore National Park in neighboring Rajasthan, the neighboring states of Madhya Pradesh and Maharashtra, and the Bengali Sunderbans. Gir, Sariska and Ranthambore are in the same ecoregion, that of Kathiawar-Gir dry deciduous forests. Though the Bengal tiger is reportedly extinct in northern and southeastern Gujarat, the nearest population of tigers to that of Indian lions is the border-area of Gujarat, Maharashtra and Madhya Pradesh. It is located across the Gulf of Khambhat from Kathiawar Peninsula, and includes the Dangs' Forest and Shoolpaneshwar Wildlife Sanctuary. Either big cat can be called 'Sher' (शेर) and have a fearsome reputation in the Subcontinent, and emigrate from its protected habitat.|$|E
25|$|Human development, mostly agriculture, has {{replaced}} {{nearly all of}} the original natural vegetation of the Ganges basin. More than 95% of the upper Gangetic Plain has been degraded or converted to agriculture or urban areas. Only one large block of relatively intact habitat remains, running along the Himalayan foothills and including Rajaji National Park, Jim Corbett National Park, and Dudhwa National Park. As recently as the 16th and 17th centuries the upper Gangetic Plain harboured impressive populations of wild Asian elephants (Elephas maximus), Bengal tigers (Panthera t. tigris), Indian rhinoceros (Rhinoceros unicornis), gaurs (Bos gaurus), barasinghas (Rucervus duvaucelii), sloth bears (Melursus ursinus) and <b>Indian</b> <b>lions</b> (Panthera leo persica). In the 21st century there are few large wild animals, mostly deer, wild boars, wildcats, and small numbers of Indian wolves, golden jackals, and red and Bengal foxes. Bengal tigers survive only in the Sundarbans area of the Ganges Delta. The Sundarbands freshwater swamp ecoregion, however, is nearly extinct. Threatened mammals in the upper Gangetic Plain include the tiger, elephant, sloth bear, and four-horned antelope (Tetracerus quadricornis).|$|R
50|$|The tiger {{was more}} than 10.0 ft long, over 4.0 ft at the shoulder, had long teeth and claws, besides strong shoulders, and was agile. People {{considered}} {{it to be the}} biggest man-eater that they ever saw in India. They chose an African lion to fight it, rather than an Asiatic lion in India, because the latter was considered to be too 'small' or 'timorous' to cope with the tiger. In reality, it appears from reports of clashes between <b>Indian</b> <b>lions</b> and tigers, besides that they co-existed {{before the end of the}} 19th century, that Asiatic lions could compete with tigers. For example, a draw was reported in the jungle of a creek connected to the Cauvery River, between a lion, which was said to be of medium size, and a tiger that was described as being 'big', and that it was more agile than the lion, by St. Landry Democrat (1887), The Eaton Democrat (1887), The Iola Register (1887), The Milan Exchange (1887), and The Sydney Mail (1889), from The Sun (New York).|$|R

[...] In the fight, both cats sustained injuries, and although the tiger sometimes retreated from Atlas, it would come back to fight it, and in the end, managed to scratch Atlas to death, though Atlas pushed it off in one final move, before dying.
