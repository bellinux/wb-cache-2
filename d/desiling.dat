40|$|On Belgian farms, visible {{fungal growth}} is {{regularly}} encountered in ensiled feed commodities. The toxigenic fungal species Penicillium roqueforti sensu strictu (s. s.) and P. paneum, designated together as P. roqueforti sensu lato (s. l.) in this dissertation, {{are the most}} frequently isolated fungi in silages. Since the inhalation of fungal spores {{as well as the}} consumption of mycotoxin contaminated feed comprise serious health risks, it is of the outmost importance to prevent fungal contamination of silages. In this dissertation, general preventory measures are described. The final goal of this PhD research was to contribute to the prevention of specifically P. roqueforti s. l. development in silage. To achieve this goal, multiple in vitro lab experiments and in vivo trials with microsilos have been conducted, evaluating the effect of several abiotic and biotic factors on P. roqueforti s. l. growth and mycotoxin production. Roquefortine C, a mycotoxin that can be produced by both P. roqueforti s. s. and P. paneum, is considered to be an indicator of mycotoxin production by P. roqueforti s. l. in silages. Therefore, this particular mycotoxin has been determined to evaluate mycotoxin production. During the ensiling process, lactic acid bacteria convert sugars to mainly lactic acid, but also some acetic acid, methanol, ethanol, etc. These compounds can be used by P. roqueforti s. l. as a carbon source. Lactic acid as sole carbon source was not very conducive for fungal growth, while acetic acid (inhibiting aerobic deterioration and subsequent fungal development in silages) as sole carbon source facilitated good fungal growth. This illustrates that P. roqueforti s. l. is very well adapted to its silage-habitat, rendering prevention difficult. The bacterium Bacillus velezensis displayed antagonistic properties towards P. roqueforti s. l. in an in vitro experiment: both culture supernatant as cell suspension reduced spore germination and spore survival and inhibited fungal growth, without triggering an increased roquefortine C production. These observations seemed promising towards the capability of B. velezensis to prevent P. roqueforti s. l. development in silages, but the applied cell suspension could not live up to the great expectations regarding antagonism in an in vivo microsilo trial. Future research is required to investigate the potential of B. velezensis as a silage additive to counter P. roqueforti s. l. in silage. Oxygen appears to {{play a crucial role in}} the development of P. roqueforti s. l. : in anaerobic conditions, no fungal growth can occur. An in vivo microsilo trial with artificially infected whole-crop maize (@ 1500 conidia per gram fresh matter) desiled after 50, 100 or 150 days demonstrated that at <b>desiling</b> after 50 days some P. roqueforti s. l. propagules (66 per gram verse stof) had survived, while after an ensiled period of 100 days no active P. roqueforti s. l. propagules were detected. This experiment emphasizes the importance of a sufficiently long ensiled period, during which the integrity of the silo coverage needs to be maintained. In order to prevent the development of P. roqueforti s. l. in silages, the strict application of good agricultural practices regarding ensiling and <b>desiling,</b> limiting air ingress into silages, is the key factor to success...|$|E

40|$|We look at {{correcting}} {{breaks in}} the Pen-Opposed Extended Edge Strokes, particularly from crossed pen trails. 1 Introduction In [13], we extracted strokes from extended edges. Unfortunately, and as shown by Figure 1. 1 there are broken strokes due to failures in the original extended edges, and at pen crossings. Our goal is to correct for these breaks. 2 Prediction Masking We propose to use the ends of each stroke to predict future behaviour. The prediction will be formed as a binary image through which other strokes can be masked. Most of the difficulty is in defining {{the area of the}} stroke from which we will be making our prediction, and correcting for ink thickness. Making the Prediction We predict the future behaviour of a stroke by linear extrapolation of the ends 1, drawing upon experience from [9]. The process is best viewed graphically, and in the following description, the (Image Î”) refer to images in Figure 2. 2. 1 The original concept was outlined by Chris <b>deSil</b> [...] ...|$|R
