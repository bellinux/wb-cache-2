40|$|The {{harp seal}} Phoca groenlandica, which is {{numerous}} and {{widespread in the}} Northwest Atlantic, may have a significant influences {{on the structure of}} this ecosystem. To qualify this influence, we must understand the functional relationship between harp seals and their prey. If seals are discriminating in their choice of prey, then their consumption of a particular species will not necessarily vary in relation to its availability or catchability. By applying Chesson's index of selectivity to stomach contents and research trawl data collected in several near- and offshore locations, we found that harp seals preferentially selected capelin Mallotus villosus relative to other prey species, irrespective of their local abundance, when given the choice. Arctic cod Boreogadus saida were also preferred in enarshore areas, but not in the offshore. In general, these predators were neutrally selective towards Atlantic cod Gadus morhua, American plaice <b>Hippoglossoides</b> <b>platessoides</b> and Greenland halibut Reinhardtius hippoglossoides.

Here, length frequency distributions from commercial catches and age information from otolith readings are used to compare long rough dab from the North Sea and the West of Scotland. Catch data from the Scottish demersal fisheries show differences in the length distribution of long rough dab between the 2 areas, with large fish (> 20 cm) more prevalent in the North Sea. The maximum length of long rough dab observed in commercial catches is 8 cm greater in the North Sea, where otolith readings indicate that the species has a greater longevity. Growth models suggest that long rough dab of age 3 + are significantly smaller in the West of Scotland. Potential explanations for the observed contrasts in hie history features include spatial differences in temperature-related metabolic costs, food availability, sex ratios (males tend to be smaller), or age-specific loss rates (emigration or mortality).

In this study, stochastic simulations were used to evaluate the probability distributions of the time horizons required to rebuild each of the two stocks to above Blim. A range of by-catch mortality levels, recruitment models, and body growth and maturation rates were applied in the simulations. Uncertainty in the estimates of the numbers at age in the last assessed year and uncertainty in future recruitment were also incorporated within the simulations.

The purpose of this study was to examine the distribution, size and maturation of American plaice in the Flemish pass to determine if fish in that area are a mix of fish from the two adjacent populations or if the fish remain separated there. American plaice collected from the Div. 3 L and Div. 3 M sides of the Flemish Pass were clearly different in mean length at age and in their maturation.

40|$|The {{relationship}} between stock size and recruitment {{is an essential}} element {{in the understanding of}} the productivity of a population. However, predicting the number of recruits produced by a population {{has proven to be a}} difficult challenge. This may in part be a result of poor estimation of reproductive potential (RP). We determined if including increased information on reproductive biology in indices of RP results in better predictions of recruitment. We investigated some of the conditions that lead to better (or worse) recruitment prediction when more biologically complex indices of RP are used. Data from four populations in the Northwest Atlantic were examined: southern Grand Bank (NAFO Division 3 NO) cod (Gadus morhua), Flemish Cap (NAFO Division 3 M) cod, Newfoundland (NAFO Division 3 LNO) American plaice (<b>Hippoglossoides</b> <b>platessoides),</b> and Greenland halibut (Reinhardtius hippoglossoides) (NAFO Subarea 2 + Division 3 KLMNO). Stock–recruit models paired with complex indices of RP gave a better estimate of recruitment in slightly more than half of the tests conducted. When there were larger trends in the reproductive biology (maturity at age, sex ratio and egg production), more complex indices of RP were more likely to provide a better estimate of recruitment. The {{relationship between}} stock size and recruitment is an essential element in the understanding of the productivity of a population. However, predicting the number of recruits produced by a population has proven to be a difficult challenge. This may in part be a result of poor estimation of reproductive potential (RP). We determined if including increased information on reproductive biology in indices of RP results in better predictions of recruitment. We investigated some of the conditions that lead to better (or worse) recruitment prediction when more biologically complex indices of RP are used.

40|$|A {{total of}} 1199 {{individuals}} of yellowtail flounder (Limanda ferruginea, Storer) and 970 individuals of American plaice (<b>Hippoglossoides</b> <b>platessoides,</b> Fabricius) were sampled from six hauls {{carried out in}} a period of 24 hours for studying the feeding chronology of these species. The main prey of yellowtail flounder (considered as total weight percentage) were Gammaridae (19. 5 %), Ammodytes dubius (10. 1 %) Annelida (6. 3 %), Mysidacea (6. 0 %) and Anthozoa (5. 6 %). The predominant preys in American plaice were Ammodytes dubius (72. 3 %), followed by Mysidacea (8. 5 %) and Echinarachnius parma (6. 1 %). Diet composition varied with size and timetable for both species. The feeding intensity index values in yellowtail flounder were scaled over 24 -hr period, and in both species these values slightly decreased during the night and at dawn, but in American plaice there was more variability in the timetable values between the size ranges. The mean weight fullness index values over the 24 -hr period in yellowtail flounder were lower than in American plaice. Also, both species presented different behaviour between the size ranges. No significant differences were noted (p< 0. 05) in the estimated values for feed intensity throughout the 24 -hr period in any of the ranges of both species studied...|$|E
