40|$|In {{the past}} few decades, the perilous {{socio-economic}} effects of meteorological hazards were exemplified by drought, desertification, flood, storm surges, erosion, landslide, harmattan <b>haze,</b> <b>line</b> squalls and thunderstorms, tornadoes and heat waves. These were sadly concerned as observed {{on the lives of}} the citizens of Nigeria. It is saddening to note that weather hazards are evidently becoming an ever-greater part of the daily lives of our people and must not be over-looked. Therefore, Studies on the potential impact of climatic change on man and his environment have become very crucial in contemporary scientific research. because, human health, energy and comfort are affected by climate than any other element of the physical environment. This study examined the impacts of meteorology and weather prediction in the process of national transformation. The development and challenges of modern prediction with special focus on tropical weather system are examined. The paper concludes that there is a pressing need to improve our conventional methods of weather forecasting through more up-to-date and powerful techniques such as weather prediction, monitoring and processing by the use of radars, satellites and computers...|$|E

From there, Landsat ETM+ data of November 18, 1999 and November 27, 1999 were mosaicked. This was followed by a histogram equalization enhancement technique performed on all the images. Later, the counties (Hancock, Harrison, Jackson, George, Stone and Pearl River) Shape file was imported into ERDAS, and used as ERDAS Area of Interest Tool (AOI) file to subset the ETM+ image of the study area.|$|R

An example throughout the journal Children as Consumers explains how celebrity endorsements in commercials have {{positive effects on}} a child’s response throughout the sales of toy cars. Cross-promotions of businesses heavily involve celebrity and character endorsements. For ten years Disney worked in collaborating with McDonald's, promoting the latest Disney films throughout the McDonald's Happy Meals. The connection between toys and fast food for young children creates a fun experience. Evident in the American Academy of Paediatrics journal, 20% of fast food restaurants advertisements now mention a complementary toy in their ads. The consequence of this illusion, that fast food is fun, holds businesses accountable for exploiting children and contributing to the global epidemic of child obesity.

"FBI special agents Teresa Simon and her husband, Andy, {{have been}} trained in ExEx—Extreme Experience—a kind of virtual reality {{enabling}} intelligence officers to relive scenes of carnage, murder, and brutality as they learn to save themselves. Andy is investigating the possibility of connecting killers with victims thought to be random, {{in the hope of}} becoming able to predict violent outbursts, when, ironically, he is killed by a crazed gunman on a shooting spree. Teresa takes a restorative trip to England, her birthplace, sojourning in Bulverton, a sleepy former resort town. There, she winds up investigating a mass murderer's shootings of her hotel's owners, the barmaid's husband, and many others on the very day of Andy's death. Thanks to a bourbon-induced <b>haze,</b> the <b>line</b> between reality and ExEx blurs for panicky Teresa, and suddenly she is [...] "experiencing" [...] the violence in Bulverton. Or was she dreaming? hallucinating? If not, who is controlling her ExEx experience?" ...|$|R
40|$|The {{growth of}} {{aviation}} industry in Nigeria {{and the increased}} adoption of air transportation {{as one of the}} best means of transport have been obstructed by various weather hazards. There is a greater need for aviation weather forecasters to deliver quality forecasts. It is therefore necessary to identify the most dangerous and most common weather hazards which are detrimental to the aviation industry so as to enhance the expertise on addressing them. This paper examined various weather hazards which include thunderstorm, fog, dust <b>haze</b> and <b>line</b> squall that affect flight operation such as flight delays, diversion and cancellation. The study revealed that fog accounted for 13. 2 % of flight cancellation at the airport and line squall similarly accounted for 10. 1 % of delays, 8. 4 % of diversion and 20 % of cancellation from 2000 - 2009 at the airport. The paper recommends that with the aid of improved forecasting tools such as Meteosat Second Generation (MSG) and Radar network which provides different images of clouds every fifteen minutes, it becomes much easier to identify dangerous clouds and give prior warning to the aviation industry...|$|R
50|$|In {{the summer}} of 2007 Haze began feuding with Sara Del Rey who was the reigning Shimmer Champion. The two fought on many occasions, {{typically}} with the Championship not on the <b>line.</b> <b>Haze's</b> first Championship match came in 2008 at the Ring of Honor's 6th Anniversary Show, where Del Rey retained the championship. The feud with Del Rey expanded to include Sweet and Sour, Inc, the faction of which Del Rey was a member, and as a result, Delirious came to aid Haze. Haze's rivalry with Lacey, who had become part of The Age of the Fall, reignited. Delirious began revealing romantic intentions towards Haze, but she rejected him, prompting Rhett Titus to claim that he had slept with Haze, who denied it. After seeing footage of Haze and Tius together, however, Delirious joined The Age of the Fall, although he left shortly afterwards when Jacobs attempted to spike Haze, but Delirious turned on his stablemates and saved Haze.|$|R
60|$|In another instant bugles were ringing {{through the}} camp, with the hurrying hoofs of mounted {{officers}} and the trampling of forming men. The house itself was almost deserted. Although the single cannon-shot had been enough {{to show that it}} was no mere skirmishing of pickets, Brant still did not believe in any serious attack of the enemy. His position, as in the previous engagement, had no strategic importance to them; they were no doubt only making a feint against it to conceal some advance upon the centre of the army two miles away. Satisfied that he was in easy supporting distance of his division commander, he extended his line along the ridge, ready to fall back in that direction, while retarding their advance and masking the position of his own chief. He gave a few orders necessary to the probable abandonment of the house, and then returned to it. Shot and shell were already dropping in the field below. A thin ridge of blue <b>haze</b> showed the <b>line</b> of skirmish fire. A small conical, white cloud, like a bursting cotton-pod, revealed an open battery in the willow-fringed meadow. Yet the pastoral peacefulness of the house was unchanged. The afternoon sun lay softly on its deep verandas; the pot pourri incense of fallen rose-leaves haunted it still.|$|R
60|$|Yet even then, {{without knowing}} {{that it was her}} thoughtless speech which had driven him to seek this foolish {{oblivion}} of remorse and sorrow, she saw only his HELPLESSNESS. She tried in vain to rouse him; he only muttered a few incoherent words and sank back again. She looked despairingly around. Something must be done; the steamer might be visible at any moment. Ah, yes,--the telescope! She seized it and swept the horizon. There was a faint streak of <b>haze</b> against the <b>line</b> of sea and sky, abreast the Golden Gate. He had once told her what it meant. It WAS the steamer! A sudden thought leaped into her clear and active brain. If the police boat should chance to see that haze too, and saw no warning signal from the semaphore, they would suspect something. That signal must be made, BUT NOT THE RIGHT ONE! She remembered quickly how he had explained to her the difference between the signals for a coasting steamer and the one that brought the mails. At that distance the police boat could not detect whether the semaphore's arms were extended to perfect right angles for the mail steamer, or if the left arm slightly deflected for a coasting steamer. She ran out to the windlass and seized the crank. For a moment it defied her strength; she redoubled her efforts: it began to creak and groan, the great arms were slowly uplifted, and the signal made.|$|R
40|$|M-dwarfs are {{the coolest}} type of hydrogen-burning stars, {{and three times}} as {{numerous}} as all other stars in the Galaxy combined. Thanks to their low masses, luminosities and surface temperatures, they are potentially the best targets for finding exoplanets capable of supporting life. A low surface temperature unfortunately also allows the formation of various molecules, which complicates spectroscopic analyses. In this work, the molecular lines of titanium oxide (TiO) and various atomic lines are analyzed in a high-resolution (R ~  68000) UVES spectrum of the M-dwarf GJ 876, as well as very high-resolution (R ~ 120000) spectra of five M-dwarfs. The TiO linelist is evaluated in a theoretical study of the molecular model. Results of the molecular line analysis {{are found to be}} misleading in certain regions. The strong TiO bands below wavelengths of 7300 Å indicate results incompatible with atomic lines at higher wavelengths. Instead, the TiO lines near 7700 Å are preferred. The theoretical study of the molecule improved both the precision and accuracy of transition wavelengths, but could not improve results of the molecular line analysis. The incompatible results are believed to stem from inaccuracies in the molecular <b>line</b> <b>haze.</b> Analyses in the wavelength range 7600 - 8800 Å are found to indicate consistent results, but residual accuracy problems cannot be excluded in the present analysis. Further study of M-dwarfs and improved modeling of TiO could resolve this issue, as well as lead to general improvements in the analyses of cool stars...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. | When {{analyzing}} any wavelength region, stellar spectroscopists {{must deal}} with the multitude of weak lines which depress the true continuum and thus form the pseudocontinuum. Calculating the eect of these lines, known collectively as the haze, " under conventional synthetic spectrum analysis is CPU intensive; an excessive amount of time is often spent calculating the opacity proles of lines which are too weak to have even a cumulative eect on the <b>line</b> <b>haze.</b> We have developed a method of identifying and eliminating these " lines from synthetic spectrum computations. We treat the line opacity as a perturbation to the continuum opacity and generate tables of equivalent width coecients which are {{a function of the}} model atmosphere, species, excitation potential, and wavelength region. Through interpolation of these tables and knowledge of the gf value for each line, we rapidly and accurately calculate the equivalent width of any line on the linear part of the curve of growth. We then determine the cumulative line blocking as a function of equivalent width. Through the use of this function and a specied line-blocking error, we eliminate from further consideration all lines having little or no eect on the pseudocontinuum. The {{reduction in the number of}} lines used in the spectrum synthesis results in a signicant savings in computation time. We present the method for 314 000 atomic and molecular lines in the 864 − 878 nm wavelength region, eective temperatures of 4000 − 6000 K, log g of 1. 5 − 4. 5 (cgs units), and solar abundances...|$|R
