Within a <b>few</b> <b>days</b> <b>of</b> the collapse, the Minnesota Department of Transportation (Mn/DOT) planned a replacement bridge, the I-35W Saint Anthony Falls Bridge. Construction was completed rapidly, and it opened on September 18, 2008.|$|E
5|$|Painful {{cramping}} in the abdomen, back, or upper thighs {{is common}} {{during the first}} <b>few</b> <b>days</b> <b>of</b> menstruation. Severe uterine pain during menstruation is known as dysmenorrhea, and it is most common among adolescents and younger women (affecting about 67.2% of adolescent females). When menstruation begins, symptoms of premenstrual syndrome (PMS) such as breast tenderness and irritability generally decrease. Many sanitary products are marketed to women for use during their menstruation.|$|E

Further, the sites that had been used to spread the bogus Flash updating have gone offline or removed the problematic files within a <b>few</b> <b>days</b> <b>of</b> its discovery, effectively killing off the spread of Bad Rabbit.|$|E

5|$|A new ergate {{spends the}} first <b>few</b> <b>days</b> <b>of</b> its adult life {{caring for the}} queen and young. She then {{graduates}} to digging and other nest work, and later to defending the nest and foraging. These changes are sometimes fairly sudden, and define what are called temporal castes. An explanation for the sequence {{is suggested by the}} high casualties involved in foraging, making it an acceptable risk only for ants who are older and are likely to die soon of natural causes.|$|E

5|$|After mating, sheep have a {{gestation}} period of around five months. Within a <b>few</b> <b>days</b> <b>of</b> the impending birth, ewes begin to behave differently. They may {{lie down and}} stand erratically, paw the ground, or otherwise act {{out of sync with}} normal flock patterns. A ewe's udder will quickly fill out, and her vulva will swell. Vaginal, uterine or anal prolapse may also occur, in which case either stitching or a physical retainer can be used to hold the orifice in if the problem persists.|$|E
5|$|Board of Trade {{inspections}} {{took place}} in late December 1862 and early January 1863 to approve the railway for opening. After minor signalling changes were made, approval was granted and a <b>few</b> <b>days</b> <b>of</b> operating trials were carried out before the grand opening on 9 January 1863, which included a ceremonial run from Paddington and a large banquet for 600 shareholders and guests at Farringdon. Charles Pearson did not {{live to see the}} completion of the project; he died in September 1862.|$|E
5|$|Figs {{flower and}} fruit asynchronously. Flowering and fruiting is {{staggered}} throughout the population. This fact {{is important for}} fig wasps—female wasps {{need to find a}} syconium in which to lay their eggs within a <b>few</b> <b>days</b> <b>of</b> emergence, something that would not be possible if all the trees in a population flowered and fruited at the same time. This also makes figs important food resources for frugivores (animals that feed nearly exclusively on fruit); figs {{are one of the few}} fruit available at times of the year when fruit are scarce.|$|E

5|$|Lavender Foal Syndrome (LFS), {{also called}} Coat Color Dilution Lethal (CCDL). Recessive disorder, fatal when homozygous, {{carriers}} show no signs. The condition has its name because most affected foals {{are born with}} a coat color dilution that lightens {{the tips of the}} coat hairs, or even the entire hair shaft. Foals with LFS are unable to stand at birth, often have seizures, and are usually euthanized within a <b>few</b> <b>days</b> <b>of</b> birth. In November 2009, Cornell University announced that a DNA test has been developed to detect carriers of LFS. Simultaneously, the University of Pretoria also announced that they had also developed a DNA test.|$|E
5|$|Much of {{the extant}} {{information}} about the last <b>few</b> <b>days</b> <b>of</b> Poe's life comes from his attending physician, Dr. John Joseph Moran, though his credibility is questionable. Poe was buried after a small funeral {{at the back of}} Westminster Hall and Burying Ground, but his remains were moved to a new grave with a larger monument in 1875. The newer monument also marks the burial place of Poe's wife, Virginia, and his mother-in-law, Maria. Theories as to what caused Poe's death include suicide, murder, cholera, hypoglycemia, rabies, syphilis, influenza, and that Poe was a victim of cooping. Evidence of the influence of alcohol is strongly disputed.|$|E
5|$|The {{event was}} recounted in Dexter Masters' 1955 novel The Accident, a fictional {{account of the}} last <b>few</b> <b>days</b> <b>of</b> {{the life of a}} nuclear {{scientist}} suffering from radiation poisoning. Depictions of the criticality incident include the 1989 film Fat Man and Little Boy, in which John Cusack plays a fictional character named Michael Merriman based on Slotin, and the Louis Slotin Sonata, a 2001 off-Broadway play directed by David P. Moore.|$|E

3000|$|Various {{cleaning}} {{solutions are}} advocated in the literature, including soap and water, sterile water, normal saline, peroxide, polyvinylpyrrolidone iodine, isopropyl alcohol and chlorhexidine [2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 10, 27, 28, 30]. When comparing chlorhexidine to normal saline, W-Dahl [30] [...] found that chlorhexidine resulted in fewer positive bacteria cultures, lower frequency of Staphylococcus aureus and <b>fewer</b> <b>days</b> <b>of</b> antibiotic use.|$|R
5|$|Tour {{operators}} {{continue to}} advertise the island as a lost paradise surrounded by mangroves where travellers' exotic dreams come to life, but {{this type of}} discovery tourism is not as popular as traditional beach-related tourism. Thus, visitors from France, Spain, and Italy often combine tours of the cases á impluvium in Enampore or Mlomp with a <b>few</b> <b>days</b> <b>of</b> relaxation in Carabane. The area is also very conducive {{to the interests of}} fishing enthusiasts. Along the beach, small stalls offer traditional crafts and clothes at prices lower than those in Cap Skirring or Saly. Badji Malang, a local painter, potter, sculptor, and poet, has created a camp in the area.|$|E

The Vita version was similarly successful: within two months of release, it had been downloaded 100,000 times. That figure rose by an additional 50,000 over the following month.|$|E
5|$|Although American {{units were}} usually able to {{replenish}} their numbers quickly, the replacements rarely had sufficient tactical training. Many junior officers were short on tactical and leadership abilities. Some tankers were shipped to Europe without {{having so much}} as driven a car before; some tank commanders were forced to teach their men how to load and fire their tank guns in the field prior to missions. The American replacement system, which focused on quantity over quality, ensured {{that the majority of}} fresh troops reaching the front lines were not properly trained for combat. It was not unusual for half of a unit's replacements to become casualties within the first <b>few</b> <b>days</b> <b>of</b> combat. These tremendous frontline losses required ever-more troops to be fed into the fighting; for instance, a freshly reinforced battalion of the US 28th Infantry Division was immediately thrown into direct assaults against Aachen to buttress the depleted US 1st Infantry Division during the final stages of the battle on 18–21 October.|$|E
