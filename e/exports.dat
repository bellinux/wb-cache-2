However, {{little is known about the}} drivers of <b>export</b> planning. In addressing this knowledge gap, this article proposes that <b>export</b> planning is usefully analyzed in terms of a managerial orientation. Regarding the antecedents of <b>export</b> planning orientation, the focus here is on the role of factors internal to the firm, especially its <b>exporting</b> mindset (<b>export</b> necessity and <b>export</b> commitment). This article also examines to what extent <b>export</b> confidence (psychic distance and marketing advantage) moderates the relationship. The empirical results show that <b>export</b> commitment has a strong and positive effect on a firm's <b>export</b> planning orientation. This relationship is moderated by psychic distance and marketing advantage. Specifically, the results show that the greater the psychic distance and the weaker the marketing advantage, the stronger the relationship between <b>export</b> commitment and a firm's <b>export</b> planning orientation. The results also show that management's perceived <b>export</b> necessity has a negative effect on a firm's <b>export</b> planning orientation and that this relationship remains unaffected by psychic distance and marketing advantage. <b>Export</b> planning orientation <b>Export</b> necessity <b>Export</b> commitment <b>Export</b> confidence Psychic distance Marketing advantage <b>Export</b> experience...|$|R
