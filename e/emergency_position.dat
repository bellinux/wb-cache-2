On 10 March—following improved weather—rescue teams resumed searching for the three missing fishermen. During the second rescue attempt, one of the fishermen was found alive but alone in a large swell about 259km (161mi) northeast of Yeppoon, Queensland. The rescuers {{were able to find}} him when he turned on an <b>Emergency</b> <b>Position</b> Indicating Radio Beacon, which he originally thought was a stick. This beacon allowed the rescuers to pinpoint his location, though the other two fishermen reportedly did not have these beacons. On 16 March, a memorial service was held for the two fishermen who were lost at sea. About 200 people who knew the two men attended the service; many of whom signed a book honoring the fishermen.|$|E

40|$|Ericsson is {{developing}} a new technology for accurate indoor positioning, named the HIP-solution. The HIP-solution is a joint product with areas of use in both the public safety market for <b>emergency</b> <b>positioning</b> and as a commercial platform for location based services. The {{driving force behind the}} development of Ericsson's HIP solution is E 911, a legal requirement imposed in theU. S. where operators are required to <b>position</b> an <b>emergency</b> call within a radius of 50 - 300 meter, depending on available positioning technology. Location Based Services (LBS) are the other important market for the HIP-solution where the technology can be used to offer customized services for mobile users based on their location, such as guidance to the nearest banking cash machine, or whereabouts of friends or family.    This master thesis is conducted at Ericsson, with the purpose of evaluate the HIP-solutions U. S market potential. The theoretical framework used in this paper is the Real Option Pricing Theory, with emphasis on the Expand Option. The theory provides a context for evaluating the HIP-solutions market potential based not only on its physical characteristics, but also of on future expand options and how well Ericsson manages to capture the cloud of externalities the HIP-solution as a joint product.   Keywords Ericsson, HIP-High Precision In-building <b>Positioning,</b> U.
