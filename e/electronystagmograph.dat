50|$|The {{resulting}} {{movement of}} the eyes may be recorded and quantified by special devices called <b>electronystagmograph</b> (ENG), a form of electrooculography (an electrical method of measuring eye movements using external electrodes), or even less invasive devices called videonystagmograph (VNG), a form of video-oculography (VOG) (a video-based method of measuring eye movements using external small cameras built into head masks) by an audiologist. Special swinging chairs with electrical controls {{can be used to}} induce rotatory nystagmus.|$|E
40|$|Spontaneous {{nystagmus}} {{encountered in}} neuro-otological practice is nearly always a physical sign of high diagnostic importance. Its localizing value is largely determined by certain of its qualitative characteristics {{and these are}} best studied and evaluated {{by means of the}} <b>electronystagmograph,</b> but for reasons discussed this is not suitable for use in smaller clinics. For the recognition and qualitative analysis of spontaneous nystagmus the use of Frenzel's glasses used in complete darkness, as recommended by Frenzel himself, has been found to give very satisfactory results...|$|E
