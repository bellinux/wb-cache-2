40|$|Koristeći bogatu arhivsku građu matičnih knjiga grada Pule, autor je u ovome članku analizirao relativno malobrojne slučajeve koji se odnose na spominjanje pripadnika nekih posebnih skupina, poput Cigana, ali i pojedinaca s različitim tjelesnim i psihičkim nedostatcima, kao što su slijepe, kljaste, šepave, nijeme i mentalno zaostale osobe. Using the {{plentiful}} archival fond of {{the civil}} and ecclesiastical <b>records</b> of <b>the</b> city of Pula, in this article author analyses <b>recorded</b> cases of <b>the</b> relatively not numerous groups of people, such as Gipsies, mentally retarded, blind, physically disabled and mute persons. <b>In</b> <b>the</b> <b>records</b> of Pula Gipsies are mentioned under the term Cigalo, Cingano, Cingaro and Zingaro. <b>In</b> <b>the</b> <b>records</b> of <b>the</b> marriages {{one of them is}} mentioned two times at the beginning of <b>the</b> eighteenth century. <b>In</b> <b>the</b> <b>records</b> of <b>the</b> baptisms Gipsies are mentioned 10 times: two times <b>in</b> <b>the</b> seventeenth century and eight times <b>in</b> <b>the</b> eighteenth century. <b>In</b> <b>the</b> <b>records</b> of <b>the</b> deceased they are mentioned 13 times: fi ve times <b>in</b> <b>the</b> seventeenth century and eight times <b>in</b> <b>the</b> eighteenth century. Mentally disabled persons are rarely <b>recorded</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> sources, too – only 11 times. <b>In</b> <b>the</b> <b>records</b> of <b>the</b> marriages they are not mentioned at all, but <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>records</b> of <b>the</b> decea-sed the most of them are mentioned. Blind persons are mentioned <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>records</b> of <b>the</b> deceased only two times (both <b>in</b> <b>the</b> eighteenth century), and <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>records</b> of <b>the</b> holy confi rmation only one blind person is documented (<b>in</b> <b>the</b> nineteenth century). Similarly, <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>records</b> of <b>the</b> holy confi rmation only one blind person is <b>recorded.</b> By <b>the</b> same token, only one physically disabled person is <b>recorded</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>records</b> of <b>the</b> deceased (<b>in</b> <b>the</b> mid eighteenth century), and only one limping person is mentioned <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>records</b> of <b>the</b> holy confi rmation (<b>in</b> <b>the</b> nineteenth century). Likewise, one mentally retarded boy is <b>recorded</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>records</b> of <b>the</b> deceased <b>in</b> <b>the</b> mid eighteenth century. Mute persons are mentioned 4 times: once <b>in</b> <b>the</b> second half of the eighteenth century and three times <b>in</b> <b>the</b> beginning of the nineteenth century. To sum all, Gipsies and variously disabled persons are recorded 36 times: 21 recordings <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>records</b> of <b>the</b> deceased, 11 notes <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>records</b> of baptisms, and two times <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>records</b> of <b>the</b> holy confi rmation and <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>records</b> of <b>the</b> marriages.

5|$|Urse, {{along with}} his contemporaries, benefited from the {{increasing}} power wielded by the sheriffs. Although royal officials, including the sheriffs, had been appropriating ecclesiastical lands since the late 10th century, in the immediate years after the Norman Conquest churchmen complained about the increased amount of land seized by the sheriffs. Urse received his share of complaints, but {{he was part of}} a wider trend {{during the early years of}} William I's reign. The appropriation of land led to an increase <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>recording</b> of rights and possessions not only by clergy but also by laymen, culminating <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>recording</b> of all possessions and the rights held by the king over them in the Domesday Survey of 1086. This behaviour was not limited to the sheriffs, as other nobles were also accused in contemporary chronicles of appropriating land from churches and from native Englishmen.|$|E
5|$|With intense media {{interest}} in the Beatles during 1963, the year was also taken up with TV shows, press interviews and a weekly radio show. Despite these demands the band found time for many sessions <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>recording</b> studio, releasing two albums and four singles during the year. 1963 was also the year when Lennon's son Julian was born.|$|E
5|$|After {{the initial}} concerts, the group flew to New York's Record Plant Studios at Lambert's suggestion, for studio recordings. The group {{were joined by}} guests Al Kooper on Hammond organ, Ken Ascher on piano and Leslie West on guitar. Townshend used a 1957 Gretsch guitar, {{given to him by}} Joe Walsh, during the session and it went on to become his main guitar for studio recording. Lambert's {{participation}} <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>recording</b> was minimal, and he proved to be unable to mix the final recordings. He had started taking hard drugs, while Townshend was drinking brandy regularly. After returning to Britain, engineer Glyn Johns made safety copies of the Record Plant material but decided {{that it would be better}} to re-record it from scratch at Olympic Sound Studios in Barnes.|$|E

5|$|Following Uncle Tupelo's final tour, Tweedy {{encouraged}} his bandmates to {{join him}} in a new group, while Farrar searched for members for a band of his own. Tweedy was able to retain the rest of the Uncle Tupelo lineup, and created Wilco. Wilco began rehearsing {{a few days after the}} final Uncle Tupelo concert, and by August 1994 they were <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>recording</b> studio for their first album, A.M.. Farrar asked Jim Boquist to join his new band, Son Volt; Boquist was a multi-instrumentalist who had performed with Joe Henry as the opening act on Uncle Tupelo's last tour. Boquist also recruited his brother Dave, and Farrar convinced Mike Heidorn to leave Belleville to join the group. Farrar's new four-piece began recording their debut album Trace in November 1994.|$|E
5|$|Following popular {{television}} {{appearances and}} concerts during their February 1964 visit, the Beatles {{returned to the}} United States in August 1964, and again in August 1965, for tours. In August 1966 they returned once more, and although this tour was commercially successful, it coincided with a storm of U.S. public protest after publication of a quote from John Lennon's remarks about Christianity. The 1966 U.S. tour {{marked the end of}} the Beatles' concert days. The band ceased to perform commercial concerts, instead devoting their efforts to creating new material <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>recording</b> studio.|$|E
5|$|Frusciante {{wrote and}} {{recorded}} {{a plethora of}} songs {{during and after the}} By the Way tour.

The group was together for about two weeks, during which they recorded about ninety minutes of material. After two days <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>recording</b> studio, they played two shows at the Knitting Factory in Hollywood, and spent two more days in the studio before disbanding. Later that year, five songs provided by Frusciante appeared on The Brown Bunny soundtrack.|$|E

5|$|In February 2012, Legacy Recordings {{signed a}} deal with Nelson that {{included}} the release of new material, as well as past releases that would be selected and complemented with outtakes and other material selected by him. With the new deal, Buddy Cannon returned to produce the recordings of Nelson. After selecting the material {{and the sound of}} the tunes with the singer, Cannon's work method consisted <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>recording</b> of the tracks with studio musicians, with the takes later completed on a separate session by Nelson with his guitar. Cannon's association to Nelson also extended to songwriting, with singer and producer composing the lyrics by exchanging text messages.|$|E
5|$|In November 2013, Howling Bells {{recorded}} Heartstrings at Assault & Battery Studios, in London. The {{album was}} primarily produced by Marks, but Moulder supported {{the effort and}} was given credit as co-producer.

Her female nature was credited with her ability to elicit exceptional performances from the band, more so than any of her record producer counterparts who worked with Howling Bells previously. The band moved on from former label Cooking Vinyl and established a partnership with Birthday Records, a small, independent record label founded by former Kaiser Chiefs drummer, Nick Hodgson.|$|E
5|$|The Beatles' {{arrival in}} the United States in 1964 marked the spread of Beatlemania from the UK to the wider world, {{established}} the group's international stature, and, triggering the British Invasion, caused changes in U.S. popular culture.

The Beatles, from the end of their 1966 U.S. tour until their break-up in 1970, gave no further commercial concerts, instead devoting their efforts to creating new material <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>recording</b> studio.|$|E
