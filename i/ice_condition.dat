25|$|A rescue party, led by William S. Champ {{aboard the}} Terra Nova, sailed a course direct {{to the ice}} fields, and {{proceeded}} when the <b>ice</b> <b>condition</b> was favorable. On July 24, they encountered thick ice, causing the crew to doubt their ability to reach their destination. However the ship reached Palmi Island on July 28 and Cape Dillion the following day, where 6 expedition members were found. More members were found at Cape Flora, and the Terra Nova returned to Cape Dillion, where a sled party was organized, which brought back the crew.|$|E
50|$|As the American Division champions, Boston {{enjoyed a}} first round bye in the playoffs, {{and faced the}} Montreal Maroons, the Canadian Division champions, in the semi-finals in a best-of-five series. The {{first game of the}} series was a grueling {{overtime}} match in which Bruins' coach Art Ross was noted for ceaseless criticism of the officiating and the <b>ice</b> <b>condition,</b> to the annoyance of the home crowd in Montreal, won on a Harry Oliver overtime goal at the 45 minute mark. The Bruins won the second match handily on two goals from Clapper, partially due to an injury forcing Montreal star Babe Siebert out only a few minutes into the game, but with Siebert's return in the third game the match was much closer. Unusually, Montreal starter Buck Boucher broke a leg 24 minutes into overtime, and his replacement, little-used defenseman Archie Wilcox, scored the game winner at the 26 minute mark. Siebert did not dress for the final game, and the Bruins overwhelmed the Maroons to reach the Cup finals, behind two goals from Marty Barry, earning the Bruins a rest while they waited for their next opponents.|$|E

40|$|Historical sea <b>ice</b> <b>conditions</b> were reconstructed for Izembek Lagoon, Bering Sea, Alaska. This lagoon is {{a crucial}} staging area during {{migration}} for numerous species of avian migrants and a major eelgrass (Zostera marina) area important {{to a variety of}} marine and terrestrial organisms, especially Pacific Flyway black brant geese (Branta bernicla nigricans). Ice cover is a common feature of the lagoon in winter, but appears to be declining, which has implications for eelgrass distribution and abundance, and its use by wildlife. We evaluated <b>ice</b> <b>conditions</b> from a model based on degree days, calibrated to satellite observations, to estimate distribution and long-term trends in <b>ice</b> <b>conditions</b> in Izembek Lagoon. Model results compared favorably with ground observations and 26. years of satellite data, allowing <b>ice</b> <b>conditions</b> to be reconstructed back to 1943. Specifically, periods of significant (limited access to eelgrass areas) and severe (almost complete ice coverage of the lagoon) <b>ice</b> <b>conditions</b> could be identified. The number of days of severe ice within a single season ranged from 0 (e. g., 2001) to 2 ̆ 265 67 (e. g., 2000). We detected a slight long-term negative trend in <b>ice</b> <b>conditions,</b> superimposed on high inter-annual variability in seasonal aggregate <b>ice</b> <b>conditions.</b> Based on reconstructed <b>ice</b> <b>conditions,</b> the seasonally cumulative number of significant or severe ice days correlated linearly with mean air temperature from January until March. Further, air temperature at Izembek Lagoon was correlated with wind direction, suggesting that <b>ice</b> <b>conditions</b> in Izembek Lagoon were associated with synoptic-scale weather patterns. Methods employed in this analysis may be transferable to other coastal locations in the Arctic. 9 2013 Elsevier B. V. Peer reviewed: YesNRC publication: Ye...|$|R
40|$|There {{are many}} {{parameters}} {{which are very}} difficult to calibrate in the threshold autoregressive prediction model for nonlinear time series. The threshold value, autoregressive coefficients, and the delay time are key parameters in the threshold autoregressive prediction model. To improve prediction precision and reduce the uncertainties in the determination of the above parameters, a new DNA (deoxyribonucleic acid) optimization threshold autoregressive prediction model (DNAOTARPM) is proposed by combining threshold autoregressive method and DNA optimization method. The above optimal parameters are selected by minimizing objective function. Real <b>ice</b> <b>condition</b> time series at Bohai are taken to validate the new method. The prediction results indicate that the new method can choose the above optimal parameters in prediction process. Compared with improved genetic algorithm threshold autoregressive prediction model (IGATARPM) and standard genetic algorithm threshold autoregressive prediction model (SGATARPM), DNAOTARPM has higher precision and faster convergence speed for predicting nonlinear <b>ice</b> <b>condition</b> time series...|$|E
40|$|Tests were {{conducted}} in the Icing Research Tunnel at the NASA Lewis Research Center to determine the icing characteristics of three modern airfoils: a natural-laminar-flow, a medium-speed, and a swept medium-speed airfoil. The tests measured the impingement characteristics and drag degradation for angles-of-attack typifying cruise and climb for cloud conditions typifying the range that might be encountered in flight. The maximum degradation occurred at the cruise angle-of-attack for the long, glaze <b>ice</b> <b>condition</b> for all three airfoils with increases over baseline drag being 486 percent, 510 percent, and 465 percent for the natural-laminar-flow, the medium-speed, and the swept, medium-speed airfoils, respectively. For the climb angle-of-attack, the maximum drag degradation (and total extent of impingement) observed were also for the long, glaze <b>ice</b> <b>condition</b> and were 261 percent, 181 percent, and 331 percent, respectively.

Sea ice extent and concentration are discussed using DMSP SSM/I satellite passive microwave data. Persistent high ice concentration was observed in December in 1989 and 1993. In those years, sea ice was formed earlier in the autumn (April-May) and expanded rapidly in this initial stage. The sea ice concentrations were higher throughout the winter season in these years.

50|$|<b>Icing</b> <b>conditions</b> exist {{when the}} air {{contains}} droplets of supercooled liquid water; <b>icing</b> <b>conditions</b> are characterized quantitatively by the average droplet size, the liquid water content and the air temperature.

The formation and development of sea ice has been reviewed. The Ice Load Monitoring system tested on the Norwegian coast guard vessel KV Svalbard is described. Three different analytical ice resistance calculation methods are described. The three methods are Lindqvist (1989), Keinonen et al. (1996) and Riska et al. (1997). Data obtained from the Ice Load Monitoring system are used to estimate the full scale ice resistance on KV Svalbard. The three analytical methods are calculated with KV Svalbard as a reference ship to be able to compare with the full scale measurements. MATLAB is used for the calculations...|$|E
