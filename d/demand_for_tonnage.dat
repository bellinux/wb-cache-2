In July 1940, it was announced that West Elcasco would be reconditioned and placed back into service along with nine other ships, including four more Skinner & Eddy-built ships, Eldena, Polybius and West Elcascos sister ships [...] and , all of which had spent {{the latter part of the}} 1930s laid up at New Orleans.|$|E

In 1936, she changed hands again and became an auto carrier. She sailed for several years under this new guise, hauling new autos from Detroit, Milwaukee, and Kewaunee until 1942. She was wrecked off Manistique that year. Had {{it not been for the}} great <b>demand</b> <b>for</b> <b>tonnage</b> in World War II, she would have been scrapped. Instead, she was sold to the Cleveland Tanker Company, and {{converted}} to a tanker. It was at this time that she obtained the name Meteor, as Cleveland Tanker named their vessels after celestial bodies. As a tanker, she hauled gasoline and other liquids for over 25 years.|$|E

Næss was put under considerable pressure to abandon his policy of operating in the spot market but he strongly resisted long time charters as he believed the markets would recover. Then, in June 1967 the Six-Day War erupted, and the Suez Canal closed for years to come. This created an enormous surge in <b>demand</b> <b>for</b> tanker <b>tonnage</b> and the Næss group was ideally positioned with 16 large tankers available, receiving extremely good rates for its vessels.|$|R
25|$|Unlike {{many of her}} contemporaries however, West Cressey was {{to escape}} the scrap merchants' yard, and {{following}} the outbreak of World War II in 1939, steadily mounting losses of merchant ships to U-boats revived the <b>demand</b> <b>for</b> shipping <b>tonnage.</b> In order to help meet this demand, the successor to the USSB, the Maritime Commission, {{in addition to its}} orders <b>for</b> new <b>tonnage,</b> implemented a reconditioning program for older ships previously laid up. West Cressey became one of the ships so reconditioned, and in March 1941 she was placed back into service with the Grace Line for a monthly charter price of $16,486. Following this revival of fortune, West Cressey appears to have been employed {{for the next few months}} in a shuttle service between Los Angeles and Honolulu.|$|R

5000|$|Eriksberg {{underwent}} similar developments as {{the other}} Swedish major shipbuilding companies; Kockums Mekaniska Verkstads AB, AB Götaverken and AB Lindholmens Varv - partly through World War I and the post-war period until 1940; a successive expansion triggered by a shipping boom and in particular by Norwegian and Swedish shipowner's need of new and bigger ships. In this regard, Eriksberg had an advantage through the direct-ownership by the Broström family (later through their listed mother company Ångfartygsaktiebolaget Tirfing). With a relatively modest share capital (6.5 million SEK) Eriksberg {{was able to make}} net profits of 40-50 million SEK every year during the 1940s. The cause for this was an unprecedented profitability during the second world war, repairing war-damaged <b>tonnage</b> and strong <b>demand</b> <b>for</b> replacement <b>tonnage</b> <b>for</b> Swedish and Norwegian shipping companies. This was enhanced by the favourable [...] "wartime windfall taxes" [...] introduced during the war. Most of these extraordinary profits were reinvested within shipping and industrial investments of the Broström Group, and this contributed to Broström's becoming the country's richest group {{in the beginning of the}} 1960s.|$|R
40|$|It is the {{strategic}} objective of maritime nations {{to develop and}} sustain an indigenous merchant marine {{to be able to}} participate in cargo lifting in the international seaborne shipping trade and thus earn shipping freight revenues. Various policies aimed at achieving this objective have been put forward by Maritime Administration of nations and indeed the Nigerian Maritime Administration. Successful implementation and appraisal of these policies arguably depend on quantitative estimation of shipping tonnage demand and other freight market indices. This paper attempts an exploratory analysis of shipping tonnage demand in the Nigeria’s non-oil freight market. Based on shipment level data obtained from port terminals records, we conduct a parametric analysis to determine <b>demand</b> <b>for</b> shipping <b>tonnage</b> and shipping routes showing intense transport demand. Trend analysis of aggregated trade volumes is conducted to examine the viability of Nigeria’s seaborne trade in the short term.

50|$|In 1964 the Naess group {{started a}} {{collaboration}} with P&O {{in the form}} of the jointly owned company Associated Bulk Carriers, thus giving them access to P&O's vast technical department. The last hurdles were cleared under a meeting at the A. G. Weser shipyard in Bremen on 6 April 1964, and a contract for building the first combined vessel was signed. The vessel was christened 16 June 1965 as Naess Norseman. The German industrialist owning the shipyard proposed the type to be called Naess-type; Næss himself however found it more appropriate to name it after the cargoes carried. Thus the name for the new type was to be OBO for Oil-Bulk-Ore. The vessel performed as expected, with some 75% of the time with cargo and only 25% in ballast. The much increased time with cargo would then more than outweigh the 15% higher cost of the vessel. Adding to the versatility of the type was that the oil and bulk market often developed differently. The OBO ship could then trade with bulk cargoes when that market was on top, and change to oil when the <b>demand</b> <b>for</b> tanker <b>tonnage</b> was high.|$|R
50|$|Years {{of working}} for A.P. Møller no doubt {{convinced}} Sigval Bergesen d.y. of the strategic importance of having a shipyard. After learning that Norges Bank intended to sell its Rosenberg Mekaniske Verksted shares, Sigval Bergesen d.y. bought those shares at a price decided by the bank. As such, he gained {{a quarter of the}} shipyard's shares and would later go on to secure full ownership. Rosenberg delivered Berge Bergesen, a 16000 DWT vessel, in 1951 and then Crown Princess Märtha of Norway was the ship's sponsor. At the point of its creation, it was the largest vessel ever constructed in Norway. Initially Rosenberg's building berth could only fit vessels of 33000 DWT and below. A larger dry dock that could fit vessels of 85000 DWT and below was built to meet the company's <b>demand</b> <b>for</b> greater <b>tonnage.</b> The shipyard was also expanded in the 1960s so it could construct even bigger vessels of up to 160000 DWT. Nonetheless, after nearly 27 years, 43 vessels and much investment in the shipyard's facilities, it became apparent that Rosenberg could no longer fulfil the company's needs and was sold off on 1 January 1970.During its years under Bergesen's ownership Rosenberg was graced by many notable guests. King Haakon VII, Crown Princess Märtha, King Olav V, Princess Astrid and Norwegian Prime Minister Einar Gerhardsen were some of the illustrious visitors to the shipyard.|$|R

40|$|After World War I, the war-inflated {{shipbuilding}} {{operations in}} Germany had {{a capacity of}} some thirty to fifty percent over demand. A reduced <b>demand</b> <b>for</b> new vessel constructions, low cargo rates {{and the lack of}} orders for war vessels led to a ruinous crisis in the shipbuilding sector lasting from 1924 to 1934, with an interim respite from 1927 to 1929. Shut-downs, closures and mergers were the consequence. Due to their unfavourable location, the shipbuilding companies in the Baltic Sea regions were hit disproportionately hard by the capacity scale-down and the structural crisis. By means of strikes, the shipyard workers and labour unions attempted to hold onto the privileges they had obtained after World War I, but to little avail. The Verein Deutscher Schiffswerften (VDS; association of German shipyards) tolerated the tough competition within the sector, to which many well-known German shipyards fell victim despite numerous technical innovations. The shipbuilding business was suffering internationally, as was shipping itself - two further factors accounting for the crisis in the German shipbuilding industry. In 1925, as a means of overcoming the crisis, the Reich government supported the faltering ship yards with a “ship renewal fund” of fifty million Reichsmarks (loan for financing up to fifty percent of new vessel constructions). In 1926 / 27 there was moreover a programme for reducing interest on loans for new ships. In 1932 the Reich government instituted a scrappage programme with a budget of twelve million Reichsmarks for ships twenty years and older, with bonuses and interest-free loans. The world economic crisis and the agreement concluded in 1930 between Hapag and the Norddeutsche Lloyd (Hapag-Lloyd-Union) brought about a further reduction in the <b>demand</b> <b>for</b> new <b>tonnage</b> since the concentration of the two major German shipping companies led to a slackening of orders for new ship constructions. The National Socialist government then introduced rearmament measures which encompassed a fleet-building programme for the navy. In conjunction with the aspirations toward selfsufficiency which led to the expansion of deep-sea fishing and the establishment of a whaling fleet, these measures were what finally brought about a noticeable improvement in the circumstances of the German shipbuilding industry, where there was now full employment. The social advantages which the labour unions had achieved for the manual labourers and office workers in the shipyard sector during the Weimar Republic, however, were revoked during the National Socialist period. The laws governing forced compliance with the NS system ultimately led to the defeat of the labour movement and the break-up of the unions...|$|R

40|$|The {{objective}} of this thesis is to provide {{an analysis of the}} current issues and conditions affecting shipping finance in Russia based {{on the development of the}} systems of ship and mortgage registration. Particular economic reasons describing the situation on the shipping markets lie outside the scope of this thesis. However, a general overview of the situation of the shipping markets and results achieved by the leading banks will be provided in the first chapter. The reason is to demonstrate that in spite of a business recession in some areas, shipping companies continue to experience favourable market conditions such as the increased freight rates and the continuing <b>demand</b> <b>for</b> gross <b>tonnage</b> capacity. The latter has led to the companies expanding or upgrading existing vessels. Another reason for choosing the above subject was the experience obtained working in the shipping finance group of a City of London law firm during the last 9 months. The author was involved as an assistant in a number of loan facility transactions for financing newbuildings for the Russian-controlled borrowers. Analysing the structure of the transactions it was noted that mortgage over the vessels and vessel registration in one of the open ship registries were prerequisites of the lending banks. In this thesis the following issues are to be considered: (i) the role of mortgage over the vessel as one of the securities in a shipping finance transaction; (ii) the role of underlying vessel registration and advantages and/or disadvantages of the existing types of ship registries; (iii) the procedures for ship and mortgage registration under Russian law and (iv) an analysis of the relative advantages and disadvantages of the Russian mortgage. In order to integrate the above issues, the following structure and terminology will be used in this thesis: (a) overview of shipping finance based on the results of the shipping banks survey published (chapter 2); (b) analysis of shipping finance characteristics, sources and main types of securitisation in shipping finance (chapter 2); (c) current issues in relation to ship and mortgage registration (chapter 3); (d) research on provisions of the ship and mortgage registration under Russian law (chapter 3); and (e) comparison between requirements in connection with (i) ship registration in the Russian International Ship Registry and Norwegian International Ship Registry...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{contains}} a micro econometric analysis of household electricity {{and natural gas}} <b>demand</b> <b>for</b> {{a cross section of}} 2, 885 Danish households observed in 1996. The sample includes fulltime employed couples in single family houses. The specification of the model is guided by an explorative nonparametric data analysis. The analysis reveals, among other things, the fairly surprising result that <b>demand</b> <b>for</b> heating is unaffected by the number of children in the household. The dependence between <b>demand</b> <b>for</b> gas and <b>demand</b> <b>for</b> electricity is examined in the paper. This is done by testing <b>for</b> separability of <b>demand</b> <b>for</b> gas from <b>demand</b> <b>for</b> electricity, and vice versa. Separability of electricity (gas) from gas (electricity) is tested by estimating <b>demand</b> <b>for</b> electricity (gas) conditional on <b>demand</b> <b>for</b> gas (electricity). The model allows for endogeneity of the conditional variable. Building regulations and individual time variation, that is panel data, identify the test. The test indicates that <b>demand</b> <b>for</b> electricity is separable from <b>demand</b> <b>for</b> natural gas, and that <b>demand</b> <b>for</b> natural gas is separable from <b>demand</b> <b>for</b> electricity.
