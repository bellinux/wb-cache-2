I do not think this <b>general</b> <b>insolvency,</b> which involves in some sort all the population, to be the reason of the difficulty experienced at Christmas and New Year and other times, in bestowing gifts; since it is always so pleasant to be generous, though very vexatious to pay debts. But the impediment lies in the choosing. If at any time it comes into my head that a present is due from me to somebody, I am puzzled what to give, until the opportunity is gone. Flowers and fruits are always fit presents; flowers, because they are a proud assertion that a ray of beauty outvalues all the utilities of the world. These gay natures contrast with the somewhat stern countenance of ordinary nature: they are like music heard out of a work-house. Nature does not cocker us; we are children, not pets; she is not fond; everything is dealt to us without fear or favor, after severe universal laws. Yet these delicate flowers look like the frolic and interference of love and beauty. Men use to tell us that we love flattery even though we are not deceived by it, because it shows that we are of importance enough to be courted. Something like that pleasure, the flowers give us: what am I to whom these sweet hints are addressed? Fruits are acceptable gifts, because they are the flower of commodities, and admit of fantastic values being attached to them. If a man should send to me to come a hundred miles to visit him and should set before me a basket of fine summer-fruit, I should think there was some proportion between the labor and the reward.|$|E
40|$|Bank {{insolvency}} regimes vary widely. First, {{many countries}} maintain separate bank insolvency rules {{from those that}} govern insolvency of other firms or individuals. Other countries have no special regime and rely on their <b>general</b> <b>insolvency</b> law for bank closure. Second, some countries rely on an administrative process for bank closure in which the bank supervisor, bank insurer, or other agency {{has the power to}} appoint the conservator or receiver, and, in some instances, may appoint itself to the job. Other countries rely on a judicial process in which the bank supervisor (or bank managers or creditors) must apply to the court for the appointment of a conservator or receiver. A comparison of the United States and United Kingdom bank insolvency regimes reflects many of the different approaches used throughout the world. The U. K. system relies on <b>general</b> <b>insolvency</b> law for the closure of banks. The system is judicial in that a court decides whether a bank is insolvent and insolvency is the only basis for closing the bank. In contrast, the U.

40|$|Self-insurance {{is often}} {{permitted}} {{as a means}} of satisfying regulatory requirements imposed on operators to evidence capability to bear their environmental liabilities. Its hallmark is that operators or their parent companies prove their financial strength rather than dedicate specific assets/funds to cover these costs. This article examines whether self-insurance can ensure that adequate funds are available when required. It is argued that if a self-insuring operator and/or its parent enter into liquidation then the protection afforded to their creditors under insolvency law may result in an environmental regulator recovering little or, indeed, nothing in respect of the costs associated with any requisite preventive, remedial or restorative works. This protection includes a liquidator’s ability to disclaim ‘onerous property’ and challenge certain payments made to the regulator as a voidable ‘preference’.

CLRC has conducted a research into the current provisions under the Companies Act 1965 since December 2003 which took about four years to complete. The result is the Final Report of the CLRC. Under this report, the CLRC has recommended the establishment of Corporate Voluntary Arrangement ('CVA') {{to take over the}} affairs of the insolvent companies and rescue them. The CVA is armed with a moratorium power against any action taken which may be commenced by the creditors and others to enable him to effectively carry out his duty in order to prepare a restructuring plan acceptable by the creditors. The plan also must be approved by the Court. This paper is a result of a pure qualitative legal research that relates to the abandoned housing projects in Malaysia. The authors also analyzed the CVA's provisions as recommended by the CLRC for the establishment of CVA vis-a-vis the rehabilitation of abandoned housing projects.

2500|$|The {{meaning of}} {{insolvency}} matters {{for the type}} of legal rule. In <b>general</b> terms <b>insolvency</b> has, since the earliest legislation, depended upon inability to pay debts. The concept is embodied in the Insolvency Act 1986 section 122(1)(f) which states that a court may grant a petition for a company to be wound-up if [...] "the company is unable to pay its debts". This general phrase is, however, given particular definitions depending on the rules for which insolvency is relevant. First, the [...] "cash flow" [...] test for insolvency represented under section 123(1)(e) is that a company is insolvent if [...] "the company is unable to pay its debts as they fall due". This is the main test used for most rules. It guides a court in granting a winding-up order or appoints an administrator. The cash flow test also guides a court in declaring transactions by a company to be avoided on the ground they were at an undervalue, were an unlawful preference or created a floating charge for insufficient consideration. The cash flow test is said to be based on a [...] "commercial view" [...] of insolvency, as opposed to a rigid legalistic view. In Re Cheyne Finance plc, involving a structured investment vehicle, Briggs J held that a court could take into account debts that would become payable in the near future, and perhaps further ahead, and whether paying those debts was likely. Creditors may, however, find it difficult to prove in the abstract that a company is unable to pay its debts as they fall due. Because of this, section 122(1)(a) contains a specific test for insolvency. If a company owes an undisputed debt to a creditor of more than £750, the creditor sends a written demand, but after three weeks the sum is not forthcoming, this is evidence that a company is insolvent. In Cornhill Insurance plc v Improvement Services Ltd a small business was owed money, the debt undisputed, by Cornhill Insurance. The solicitors had repeatedly requested payment, but none had come. They presented a winding up petition in the Chancery Court for the company. Cornhill Insurance's solicitors rushed to get an injunction, arguing that there was no evidence at all that their multi-million business had any financial difficulties. Harman J refused to continue the injunction noting that, if the insurance company had [...] "chosen" [...] not to pay, a creditor was also entitled to choose to present a winding up petition when a debt is undisputed on substantial grounds.|$|R

The dissertation entails an analysis of core insolvency standards and related principles, which are highly significant when (re-) designing or reforming the insolvency regime of a country in the transition process. There, the author intends to examine those issues from a potential legislator's point of view, whereby the benefits and repercussions associated with such standards are analysed {{in the context of}} the particular economical, social and political needs of the jurisdictions in question. The aim of the thesis is to discuss the policy objectives facing a potential legislator in a country seeking to reform its insolvency regime and to offer guidelines that support good practise standards in the countries in question. Furthermore, the paper attempts to articulate a comprehensive statement about the various and competing goals that underlie the insolvency system, particularly in a transition economy. As a result the paper identifies several key principles that should form the basis of any insolvency regime. Furthermore, the outcome of the research points out, certain issues will be of more importance for transition economies than for developed countries, and vice versa.

40|$|The {{contribution}} {{considers the}} topical {{issue of the}} relationship between secured transactions and insolvency laws in the light of two recent international instruments, the 2001 Cape Town Convention on international interests on mobile equipment and the (at the time) Draft UNCITRAL Legislative Guide on Secured Transactions. Both instruments, though differing in their scope of application and in their nature, pursue the primary goal of promoting secured credit through efficient and clear rules. Such a goal may be, however, in contrast with national insolvency law policies, especially when rescue of the defaulting debtor's economic activity is attempted. Thus, the international uniform rules should try to find an - admittedly difficult - balance between the need to foster reorganisation procedures and the goal of encouraging pre-commencement financing of enterprises. The contribution considers several aspects which are crucial to the relationship between the pre-commencement creditor rights and insolvency-related policies: avoidance of preferential transactions, priority of liens arising by operation of law, opportunity to limit all-encompassing security devices in favour of (certain) unsecured creditors, tension between creditors’ preferential satisfaction and rescue proceedings, treatment of title retention instruments in insolvency. After a thorough analysis of the uniform law provisions dealing with the above mentioned aspects, the conclusion is reached that both the UNCITRAL Legislative Guide and the Cape Town Convention offer a number of fruitful suggestions towards finding a balanced solution, while the Aircraft Protocol to the Cape Town Convention shows a marked preference for enhancing the secured creditor's position to the detriment of <b>general</b> <b>insolvency</b> policies.

Part 5. 3 A of the Corporations Act 2001 (Cth) followed the Report titled, “Administration of a Company’s Affairs with a View to Executing a Deed of Company Arrangement” and operates from 23 June 1993. The deed of company arrangement allows for the creditors and the company debtor to come to an alternate arrangement between themselves to enable the chances of a company within the zone of insolvency a chance of survival and as an alternative to liquidation of the company. This fresh start ideal is a key underpinning feature of modern insolvency and bankruptcy law. The Australian corporate rescue provisions however have been in place for over 20 years and remain largely unaltered. Whilst this is a testament to inter alia clarity of drafting, there are signs that perhaps {{now is the time to}} review {{the operation of}} the deed of company arrangement provisions, especially in the light of court judgments regarding secured credit and deeds of company arrangement that appear to be at odds with the purpose and drafting of rescue provisions speciﬁcally and corporate insolvency generally.
