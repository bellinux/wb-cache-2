A multimedia terminal which embeds different probes to monitor network conditions and end user perceptual characteristics has been conceived and implemented. A series of QoS mapping between perception and adaptation spaces are yielded {{by means of the}} parameters provided by the QoS probes, facilitating content adaptation enabled by any generic adaptation server or intermediate service. Such a design approach illustrates a possible architecture for next-generation multimedia end user system supporting QoS control and content adaptation over a heterogeneous delivery chain...|$|E
40|$|This thesis proposes optimization-based {{methods for}} control and {{estimation}} of dynamic systems. Due to their versatility, optimization-based schemes range {{among the most}} advanced and generic methods, and enjoy increasing popularity. The computational burden associated with the online solution of an optimization problem, however, still constitutes a major limiting factor on the control and estimation performance {{in a range of}} real-time applications that impedes the further practical success of this class of methods. 					We focus on problems featuring long prediction or estimation horizons, with both linear and nonlinear dynamics, andconstraints. Such problems are of great practical interest {{for a variety of reasons}} including stability <b>guarantees</b> <b>and</b> <b>control</b> or estimation performance. Particularly in the pursuit of economic objectives their formulation can be a key necessity. We develop algorithms that exploit the inherent sparsity of these problems with a focus on concurrency of the major computational steps, so as to ensure parallelizability on current and future computational architectures. 					In particular, a hierarchical re-linearization procedure for nonlinear model predictive control (MPC) based on the well-established Real-Time Iteration scheme is given, thus further bridging the gap between linear and nonlinear MPC. An improved, reduced-complexity condensing algorithm for dimension reduction of the arising structured quadratic programming problems (QPs) is presented. 					Moreover, a novel structure-exploiting sparse QP algorithm based on dual decomposition and a semismooth Newton method is proposed, aiming at a combination of sparsity-exploitation characteristics from interior-point methods and warmstarting capabilities from common active-set methods for dense problems. We prove finite convergence and rigorous infeasibility detectionof the algorithm, and identify its tailored factorization routine with the Riccati recursion for linear-quadratic control. Most notably, we analyze various theoretical and practical numerical aspects of this method, leading to an efficient implementation that improves the state-of-the-art in QP solution approaches by factors of more than ten in computation time on a variety of benchmarkproblems. The implementation has been publicly released as open-source code as part of this thesis. 					Generalizations of this dual Newton idea to distributed quadratic programming and to nonlinear programming are examined. The development of a high-fidelity real-time feasible nonlinear MPC scheme for autonomous driving, which can be applied for real-time collision avoidance in dangerous driving conditions as well as for time-optimal driving, concludes this thesis. nrpages: 294 status: publishe...|$|E

40|$|Many sensor {{networking}} {{applications such}} as surveillance and environmental monitoring are time-sensitive in nature. To sup-port such applications, we design and implement Nano-RK, a reservation-based real-time operating system (RTOS) with multi-hop networking support for use in wireless sensor net-works. We support fixed-priority preemptive multitasking for guaranteeing that task deadlines are met, along with support for CPU and network bandwidth reservations. Tasks can spec-ify their resource demands and the operating system provides timely, <b>guaranteed</b> <b>and</b> <b>controlled</b> access to CPU cycles and network packets in resource-constrained embedded sensor envi-ronments. We also introduce the concept of virtual energy reser-vations that allows the OS to enforce energy budgets associated with a sensing task by controlling resource accesses. A light-weight wireless networking stack supports packet forwarding, routing and TDMA-based network scheduling. Nano-RK has been implemented on the Atmel ATMEGA 128 processor with the Chipcon CC 2420 802. 15. 4 transceiver chip. Our results show that a light-weight embedded resource kernel with rich functionality and timing support is practical and constitutes a simple and alternative paradigm for supporting distributed sensing tasks. ...|$|R
40|$|Despite {{the recent}} {{interest}} towards food safety <b>and</b> <b>control,</b> {{it is generally}} difficult to ensure full products traceability through industrial food chains, {{due to the lack}} of efficient information and communication systems. Consequently, nowadays, the protection of food products often ends at the gates of the producer without any investigation about the status of their quality at the consumer’s location. The aim of this paper was the development of a supply chain monitoring system based on a smart logistic unit (SLU) to support the integrated management of the food supply chain from “farm to fork” in order to <b>guarantee</b> <b>and</b> <b>control</b> food safety <b>and</b> shelf life (SL) of products in agreement with logistic efficiency and system sustainability.

Finally, an experimental SL model has been determined, based on the volatile organic compounds emitted from fruits and monitored by the SLU. We have validated the model by simulating real transport conditions and assessing the residual SL of the product at different time intervals...|$|R
