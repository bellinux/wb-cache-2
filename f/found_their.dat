5|$|The plates lie flat {{along the}} back, as a shingle-like armor. This was Marsh's initial interpretation, {{which led to}} the name 'roof lizard'. As further and {{complete}} plates were <b>found,</b> <b>their</b> form showed they stood on edge, rather than lying flat.|$|E
5|$|Treasure {{hunters have}} {{sought out the}} Eshmun Temple since antiquity; around 1900 {{artifacts}} bearing Phoenician inscriptions from the temple site <b>found</b> <b>their</b> way to Beirutine antiquities markets where they stirred {{the interest of the}} Ottoman authorities and prompted a series of archeological digs.|$|E
5|$|After {{signing with}} Fat Wreck Chords, Tintari and White left the band. The {{remaining}} members then {{spent the next}} few months looking for another drummer capable of playing double-time beats at a rapid pace. During this period, the band Good Riddance <b>found</b> <b>their</b> new drummer, and sent Rise Against the audition tape of their number two choice, Brandon Barnes. A mutual friend gave Barnes' phone number to Principe, and after listening to Transistor Revolt, Barnes accepted the band's invitation.|$|E

5|$|Because {{of their}} long {{association}} with humans, cockroaches are frequently {{referred to in}} popular culture. In Western culture, cockroaches are often depicted as dirty pests. In a 1750–1752 journal, Peter Osbeck noted that cockroaches were frequently seen and <b>found</b> <b>their</b> way to the bakeries, after the sailing ship Gothenburg ran aground and was destroyed by rocks.|$|E
5|$|Consequently, {{when the}} Sisters of Death arrived in Mega-City One, they found Kraken there instead of Dredd. Finding Kraken to be {{vulnerable}} to manipulation by their psychic powers, as he was still torn by latent subconscious loyalty to his late master Judd, {{they were able to}} use him as their agent to free Judge Death from captivity and begin their conquest of the city. Had Dredd not resigned, they might not have <b>found</b> <b>their</b> task so easy. Dredd eventually returned to the city and defeated them.|$|E
5|$|Despite {{his failure}} at seizing the throne, Constantine Doukas' {{popularity}} meant that his memory was preserved both {{among the people}} and the aristocracy of Asia Minor: in the 930s, Basil the Copper Hand assumed his identity and led a peasant revolt, while among the aristocracy he was glorified as a hero. Elements of Constantine's life eventually <b>found</b> <b>their</b> way into the epic poem Digenes Akrites.|$|E

5|$|Filming {{also took}} place in 2005, near the {{marketplace}} of the Bucharest neighborhood Rahova. The chosen area raised a few difficulties related to safety. However, the production benefited from its picturesque view, rendering the scenography and the original music unnecessary. The omnipresent manele also <b>found</b> <b>their</b> way into the movie, as background music.|$|E
5|$|In 1990 Northern Irish poet Paul Muldoon {{published}} his long poem Madoc: a Mystery, inspired by Southey's {{work and the}} events surrounding it. Muldoon's work takes as its premise the idea that Southey and Coleridge actually came to America to <b>found</b> <b>their</b> ideal state, and offers a multi-layered poetic exploration {{of what might have}} happened. It won the 1992 Geoffrey Faber Memorial Prize.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to the effect on his spiritual growth, the connection with Deguchi gave Ueshiba entry to elite political and military circles as a martial artist. As {{a result of this}} exposure, he was able to attract not only financial backing but also gifted students. Several of these students would <b>found</b> <b>their</b> own styles of aikido.|$|E

5|$|It became common {{knowledge}} among the settlers that their European vines, of the vinifera. variety, simply would not grow in American soil, and they resorted to growing Native American plants, and established plantations of these native vines. Exceptions did exist; vinifera plantations were well-established in California before the aphids <b>found</b> <b>their</b> way there.|$|E
5|$|Ladd's group soon <b>found</b> <b>their</b> {{business}} {{expertise in}} other areas did not apply as well to the iron industry. Their lack of experience, coupled with a dispute over water rights, caused the company to close in 1869. After a brief respite in which they filled an order for iron wheels for the Central Pacific Railroad from 1874 to 1876, the company closed for good in 1878 and the assets were sold off at a sheriff's auction.|$|E
5|$|Local {{residents}} have become critical of Hyde Park as a concert venue, {{due to the}} sound levels, and have campaigned for a maximum sound level of 73 decibels.

5|$|Nevertheless, the {{bombardment}} caused {{a large number}} of casualties. Though some projectiles buried themselves in the soft soil, most <b>found</b> <b>their</b> marks on the reverse slope of the ridge. The bombardment forced the cavalry of the Union Brigade (in third line) to move to its left, as did the Scots Greys, to reduce their casualty rate.|$|E
5|$|On this basis, an anti-drug {{campaign}} was initiated by Baba lovers in the United States, Europe and Australia.

5|$|Studios <b>found</b> <b>their</b> {{way around}} the {{restrictions}} and published increasingly racy imagery. Ultimately this backfired in 1934 when a billboard in Philadelphia was placed outside the home of Cardinal Dennis Dougherty. Severely offended, Dougherty took his revenge by helping to launch the motion-picture boycott which would later facilitate enforcement of the Code. A commonly repeated theme by those supporting censorship, and one mentioned in the Code itself was {{the notion that the}} common people needed to be saved from themselves by the more refined cultural elite.Massey, pg. 71.|$|E

The win was even more special as the UConn men's basketball team won the men's national championship the previous night, marking the first time one University won both the men's and women's basketball championships in one season, a feat UConn repeated in 2014.|$|E
5|$|The MP 40 {{was used}} for several decades {{following}} World War II by many {{countries around the world}} in armed conflicts.

5|$|The taxonomic affinities of the broad-billed parrot are un{{determine}}d. Considering {{its large}} jaws and other osteological features, the ornithologists Edward Newton and Hans Gadow thought {{it to be}} {{closely related to the}} Rodrigues parrot (Necropsittacus rodricanus) in 1893, but were unable to determine whether they both belonged in the same genus, since a crest was only known from the latter. The British ornithologist Graham S. Cowles instead <b>found</b> <b>their</b> skulls too dissimilar for them to be close relatives in 1987.|$|E
