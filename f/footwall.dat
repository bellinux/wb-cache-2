40|$|THESIS 7841 This thesis investigates {{a natural}} CO 2 {{reservoir}} {{to define the}} factors that can cause leakage and determine the rates and consequences of CO 2 leakage on the surrounding environment. Situated at {{the northern end of}} the Paradox Basin in east- central Utah, faulting of the north-plunging Green River Anticline has created structural highs in the <b>footwalls</b> of the west-north-west trending Little Grand Wash Fault and northern fault of the Salt Wash Graben. Focussed surface leakage of CO 2 is prevalent in the immediate <b>footwalls</b> of both faults with the presence of C 02 -charged geysers and springs and travertine deposits. The C 02 -rich waters erupting from the geysers and springs are a product of CO 2 produced from clay-carbonate reactions in Triassic and sub-Permian source beds rising and mixing with a series of overlying stacked aquifers (Heath, 2004). Geochemical investigations of active and ancient travertines along both faults indicate that this hydrologic system has been prevalent for at least the last 78, 000 years...|$|R
50|$|During the Devonian Period the {{thickened}} welt of crust {{formed by}} the Caledonian orogeny began to collapse. Some thrust surfaces show evidence of reactivation as low-angle extensional faults, but the main structures formed at this time were large-scale extensional detachments. Movement on these detachments led to deposition of thick sequences of continental clastic sediments in their hanging walls and was in part responsible for the exhumation of late Caledonian ultra high-pressure metamorphic rocks, including eclogites, in their <b>footwalls.</b> The displacements on these structures range from nearly orthogonal to the Caledonian chain {{in the south to}} being strongly oblique in mid-Norway.|$|R
40|$|The {{juxtaposition}} of fault-bounded sedimentary basins, above crustal-scale detachments, with warmer exhumed <b>footwalls</b> {{can lead to}} thermal convection of the fluids in the sediments. The Devonian basins of western Norway are examples of supradetachment basins that formed in the hanging wall of the Nordfjord-Sogn Detachment Zone. In {{the central part of}} the Hornelen and Kvamshesten basins, the basin-fill is chiefly represented by fluvial sandstones and minor lacustrine siltstones, whereas the fault margins are dominated by fanglomerates along the detachment contact. Prominent alteration and low-greenschist facies metamorphic conditions are associated with the peak temperature estimates of the sediments close to the detachment shear zone. Fluid circulation may have been active during the burial of the sediments, and we quantify the potential role played by thermal convection in redistributing heat within the basins. Different models are tested with homogeneous and layered basin-fill and with material transport properties corresponding to sandstones and siltstones. We found that thermally driven fluid flow is expected in supradetachment basins as a transient process during the exhumation of warmer <b>footwalls.</b> We demonstrate that the fluid flow may have significantly affected the temperature distribution in the upper five kilo-meters of the Devonian basins of western Norway. The temperature anomaly induced by the flow may locally reach about 80 °C. The sedimentary layering formed by sand- and siltstones strata does not inhibit fluid circulation at the scale of the basin. The presence of fluid pathways along the detachment has an important impact on the flow and allows an efficient drainage of the basin by channelizing fluids upward along the detachment...|$|R

30|$|On {{the basis}} of fault zone {{structures}} and their control on remaining oil distribution, {{and the types of}} remaining oil, a three-step approach for predicting distribution of remaining oil at fault edges was developed. First, we should determine faults and fault blocks with rich remaining oil and optimal NNW antithetic fault <b>footwalls</b> based on the matching relationship between faults and reservoirs. Second, we will determine the location of faults by superposing micro-amplitude structures, ranges of fault sealing oil, and the oblique anticlines formed by soft-linkage faults, and determining favorable locations for the distribution of remaining oil.

30|$|Traps are {{structural}} or stratigraphic {{features that}} ensure that accumulated hydrocarbon {{are held in}} a fixed and firm position of seal and reservoir to avoid the escape {{of oil and gas}} to the surface. Outcrop exposures in the Anambra Basin have revealed the presence of fault (growth fault), which are similar to those found in available interpreted 2 D seismic data of Anambra Basin and 3 D subsurface seismic data of Niger Delta Basin (Figs.  4 a, 7 e, f, 10 a, b; Abubakar 2004; Nwajide 2005; Dim et al. 2017, 2018 a). These structures are believed to have formed due to response of sediment package to syn-sedimentary deformation (Obi and Okogbue 2004; Dim et al. 2017). These faults constitute structural traps, which together with stratigraphic traps could allow for accumulation of hydrocarbon on the both the <b>footwalls</b> and the hanging walls of fault structures (Fig.  10 c, d).|$|R

40|$|From the Palacozoic to the Cretaceous, crustal {{thinning}} in the Mid Norway {{area was}} associated with the denudation of gneiss-cored culminations and metamorphic core complexes in the <b>footwalls</b> of major extensional faults. The development of the culminations led to warping and deactivation of early detachments, to the nucleation of new faults in more distal positions and to the exhumation of highgrade metamorphic rocks to more shallow levels in the crust. Some of the culminations and core complexes became part of the erosional template in Mid-Late Palaeozoic time, some were probably exhumed in the Mesozoic, whereas some may never have reached the surface. We present an overview of five types of gneiss-cored culminations and core complexes that have been identified in the field, through the interpretation of offshore, long-offset seismic reflection data. We furthermore address their mechanism(s) of formation, and their role in the progressive evolution of the Mid-Norwegian margin...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: Delta systems {{developed}} above ductile substrates such as overpressured shales {{and salt}} have been modelled using layered sand-packs above ductile silicone polymer layers. Gravity spreading ofprogradational sedimentary wedges produces delta-top and upper delta-slope grabens linked to delta-toe contractional fold-thrust and diapir zones. The delta-top grabens {{are bound by}} both regional and counter-regional listric growth faults. A basinward-stepping sequence of regional, counter-regional followed by regional faulting is commonly developed. Polymer pillows and ridges commonly develop in the <b>footwalls</b> of the major listric extensional faults and may evolve into reactive diapirs. Successive progradational loads generate new delta-top or upper delta-slope graben systems on top of lder contractional belts where the ductile polymer layer has been thick-ened significantly.

40|$|Extensional {{detachment}} systems separate hot <b>footwalls</b> from cool hanging walls, but {{the degree}} to which this thermal gradient is the product of ductile or brittle deformation or a preserved original transient geotherm is unclear. Oxygen isotope thermometry using recrystallized quartz-muscovite pairs indicates a smooth thermal gradient (140 degrees C/ 100 m) across the gently dipping, quartzite-dominated detachment zone that bounds the Raft River core complex in northwest Utah (United States). Hydrogen isotope values of muscovite (delta D-Ms similar to- 100 parts per thousand) and fluid inclusions in quartz (delta D-Fluid similar to- 85 parts per thousand) indicate the presence of meteoric fluids during detachment dynamics. Recrystallized grain-shape fabrics and quartz c-axis fabric patterns reveal a large component of coaxial strain (pure shear), consistent with thinning of the detachment section. Therefore, the high thermal gradient preserved in the Raft River detachment reflects the transient geotherm that developed owing to shearing, thinning, and the potentially prominent role of convective flow of surface fluids...|$|R

25|$|Crustal {{extension}} {{controls the}} tectonic accommodation space available for sediments in rift settings {{and may be}} defined by the structural and depositional geometry of sedimentary successions observed on seismic data {{and the rate of}} subsidence through time as represented by the accommodation of sediment. The characteristic features of each are dependent on three variables: the time taken for deposition; the interplay between tectonics and eustasy and the lithology (thus facies) of the succession observed. The Sherwood Sandstone Group has been considered to represent a syn-rift phase of fluvial deposition throughout Europe, with the overlying Mercia Mudstone Group interpreted as the succeeding phase of deposition in an evaporitic seaway during post-rift thermal subsidence. More recently, however, there has been the recognition that it is the Mercia Mudstone Group which is seen to thicken markedly into faults imaged on seismic data rather than the Sherwood Sandstone Group. This work demonstrates the Mercia Mudstone Group to be a syn-rift phase of deposition, with the fine grained nature of the sedimentary record at this time controlled by the prevailing arid climate. Such conditions were not conducive to the large-scale and rapid movement of sediments from the hinterlands raised by relative <b>footwall</b> uplift, thus the sediments are fine grained. The minor thickening of the Sherwood Sandstone Group into faults is interpreted to be a combination of minor extension in the early Triassic superimposed on thermal subsidence inherited from the important regional phase of extension in the early Permian. Analysis of the timing of fault growth indicates a larger proportion of fault-controlled, synsedimentary movement occurred during the mid-to-late Triassic (Mercia Mudstones) rather than the early Triassic (Sherwood).|$|E

40|$|For the {{conjugate}} {{margins of}} the South Atlantic (West Africa and Brazil), we compare and contrast the structural styles, {{using data from the}} subsurface and surface. Our aim is to explain the similarities and differences for both syn-rift and post-rift structures. The area of interest spans the Lower Congo, Kwanza and Benguela basins of West Africa, and the Espirito Santo, Campos and Santos basins of Brazil. All of these formed by Neocomian rifting, at the eastern edge of a Panafrican transpressional orogen, the Ribeira Fold Belt. Because this belt has a sigmoidal outline on a map, rifting and later opening of the Atlantic resulted in major jogs in the coastlines of West Africa and Brazil. Rifting also inherited the dominant eastward vergence of the fold belt, so that most of the master faults of the rift basins dip westward. In West Africa, on CongoSpan seismic profiles of the continental margin, Neocomian strata lie within rift basins, beneath an unconformable layer of Aptian salt, The master faults of the rift basins dip predominantly westward (in other words, seaward). In the lower crust, the faults curve into low-angle reflectors. We interpret these as Precambrian thrust zones, which reactivated in extension. In their <b>footwalls,</b> the reflection Moho rises locally by several km, accounting for isostatic gravity anomalies. On the Atlantic margin of Brazil, the main master faults of the rift basins also dip westward (in other words, landward on this margin). Again, the Moho rises locally in their <b>footwalls.</b> The conjugate margins differed progressively, after rifting ceased and the Atlantic Ocean opened. In Brazil, the margin was subject to three or more phases of uplift and exhumation, which we correlate with phases of orogeny in the Andes. Thus we argue that plate-wide horizontal compression was an important factor in the post-rift development of the Brazilian margin. The compression reactivated the Precambrian thrusts, inverting the rift basins. In West Africa, there is also some evidence for compressional reactivation of the margin. We argue that reactivation of Precambrian thrust zones is responsible for uplift and exhumation of the continental interior, especially in the West Congo fold belt, where thrusts are seismically active today. In conclusion, structural inheritance has influenced the geological histories of both margins...|$|R

40|$|Extensional basins often evolve {{both with}} the {{generation}} of normal faults at all scales, and with tilting in the hanging walls and <b>footwalls</b> of major structures. This paper examines the effect of regional tilting {{on the development of}} normal fault arrays in an anisotropic sequence, using the asymmetric Lodève Basin, France, as a case study. The orientation range of normal faults is found not to match that expected by continued symmetric generation of conjugate normal faults during tilting. Instead, continued generation of new faults preferentially occurred for faults dipping opposite to the direction of tilt, with propagation perpendicular to bedding. The presence of early bedding-perpendicular joints in the competent sandstone units aided propagation of these faults during tilting and this preferential asymmetric development. Bedding-parallel slip surfaces were activated as normal faults during the later stages of bedding tilting, showing complex interaction patterns with later faults downthrowing in the direction opposite to bedding tilting. Hence knowledge of the timing between tilting of the strata and deformation helps in evaluating the likely complexity of fault arrays at subseismic scales in extensional basins, and may also help in understanding the evolution of fault systems in tilted normal fault blocks at the reservoir scale...|$|R
