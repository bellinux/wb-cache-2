50|$|On the 27th, she got {{underway}} in {{company with the}} French frigate Le Sensible. Want of winter clothing then prevented Jones from beginning an extended cruise in quest of prizes; and, instead, the ship struggled across the Bay of Biscay against head winds along a roughly northeasterly course toward L'Orient. En route, she recaptured a wine-laden French barque - a prize which had been taken by an English privateer - and saved the <b>foundering</b> <b>vessel's</b> cargo before the barque sank. She also chanced upon Livingston and escorted that tobacco-laden American merchantman to the French coast.|$|R
50|$|On September 10, 1910, Pere Marquette 18 {{was bound}} for Milwaukee, Wisconsin, from Ludington, Michigan, with {{a load of}} 29 {{railroad}} freight cars and 62 persons. Near midnight, the vessel began to take on massive amounts of water. The captain dumped nine railroad cars into Lake Michigan, but this was no use—the ship was going down. The Pere Marquette 17, traveling nearby, picked up the distress call and sped to assist the <b>foundering</b> <b>vessel.</b> Soon after she arrived and she could come alongside, the Pere Marquette 18 sank {{with the loss of}} 28 lives; there were 33 survivors.|$|R

Sometime after 2:00 am on 15 August 1901 while sailing down the narrow Lynn Canal south of Juneau, she struck what {{was reported to be}} an iceberg that stove a large hole in her forward port quarter. Attempts to steer the <b>foundering</b> <b>vessel</b> ashore on nearby Douglas Island were in vain; within five minutes, the tremendous weight of the water filling the ship's forward compartments had forced her bow underwater and her stern, rudder and propellers completely out of the water.|$|R

Later that day, in the Bristol Channel, about five {{miles off the coast}} of Ilfracombe, an explosion occurred under the vessel amidships. The ships siren was activated and the crew entered the lifeboats. The siren was heard on shore and the Ilfracombe coast guard sent lifeboats to the area. There were 21 other steamers in the area at the time of the explosion and six of them offered assistance to the <b>foundering</b> <b>vessel.</b> All 33 crew were saved and taken to Ilfracombe pier. Early reports were unsure what had caused the explosion. There was speculation that the vessel had struck a mine or torpedo.

2500|$|During her nine-year career, {{she came}} to the rescue of distressed vessels and she had several mishaps of her own, {{including}} stranding on a reef in 1882, running ashore in 1888 near Cheboygan, Michigan, and striking a bar and sinking at the dock in Duluth, Minnesota in 1889. In 1883, Drake rescued the crew of her consort, the 347-ton schooner Dot (the former Mary Merrit), when Dot began leaking and sank off Grand Marais, Michigan. [...] In 1889, Drake picked up 3 passengers and the 15-man crew from the wooden steam barge Smith Moore that had been sideswiped by James Pickands in heavy fog. [...] Drake towed Moore for 6 hours when Moore finally sank only 300 feet from the bar {{at the mouth of the}} Munising, Michigan harbor. In 1900, Drake rescued the 8-man crew from the leaking schooner-barge R. Hallaran that foundered off Keweenaw Point near Stannard Rock Light. [...] Drake saved at least 4 crews from <b>foundering</b> <b>vessels</b> during her career but her final rescue of her own consort's crew caused a fatal blow to her structure that resulted in her suffering the same fate.|$|R
50|$|Surfacing, Lightoller {{spotted the}} ship's crow's nest, now {{level with the}} water, and started to swim towards it {{as a place of}} safety before remembering that it was safer {{to stay away from the}} <b>foundering</b> <b>vessel.</b> Then, as water flooded down one of the forward ventilators, Lightoller was sucked under. He was pinned against the grating for some time by the {{pressure}} of the incoming water, until a blast of hot air from the depths of the ship erupted out of the ventilator and blew him to the surface. The suction pulled him down again against another grating. He did not know how he got away, but he resurfaced. He realized he couldn’t swim properly because of the weight of the Webley revolver he was carrying in his coat pocket, so he swiftly discarded it. Following this, he saw Collapsible B floating upside down with several swimmers hanging on to it. He swam to it and held on to a rope at the front. Then the Titanics Number 1 (forward) funnel broke free and hit the water, washing the collapsible further away from the sinking ship.|$|R
2500|$|On 18 August Magicienne was {{in company}} with Penguin, , and [...] as they escorted {{a fleet of}} 109 {{merchant}}men from Jamaica to Britain.

Initial reports had nine <b>vessels</b> <b>foundering,</b> with the crew of some being saved; later reports put the loss at 13 merchant <b>vessels</b> <b>foundered</b> and two abandoned but later salvaged. Franchise lost her fore-mast and main-top-mast but together with Penguin managed to bring 71 merchant vessels back to England. (Others arrived earlier or later, and some went to America.)

50|$|The M.M. Drake was {{constructed}} in 1882 in Buffalo, New York as a wooden steam barge and named for the line superintendent of her building company, Mr. Marcus Motier Drake. The Drake started her career in September 1882 by towing the barge F.W. Gifford. In 1883 she was chartered for Lake Erie to Duluth, Minnesota for coal and from Marquette, Michigan to Lake Erie for iron ore. In 1885 she was re-admeasured and had upper decks added at the Union Dry Dock Company in Buffalo, New York. James Corrigan of Wickliffe, Ohio became her third and final owner in 1889. During her nine-year career, {{she came to the}} rescue of distressed vessels and she had several mishaps of her own, including stranding on a reef in 1882, running ashore in 1888 near Cheboygan, Michigan, and striking a bar and sinking at the dock in Duluth, Minnesota in 1889. In 1883, the Drake rescued the crew of her consort, the 347-ton schooner Dot (the former Mary Merrit), when the Dot began leaking and sank off Grand Marais, Michigan. In 1889, the Drake picked up 3 passengers and the 15-man crew from the wooden steam barge Smith Moore that had been sideswiped by the James Pickands in heavy fog.

40|$|A Whig {{vision of}} the rout of Van Buren in the presidential {{election}} of 1840. In a stormy sea Van Buren grasps the mast (labeled "Maine") of a <b>foundering</b> <b>vessel</b> "O. K. " (the initials for "Old Kinderhook," a Van Buren nickname derived from his birthplace and home in Kinderhook, New York). In the water are supporters John Calhoun, Amos Kendall, Francis Preston Blair, Thomas Hart Benton, and Levi Woodbury. The gale seems to emanate from three faces which appear in the clouds: William C. Rives, William Henry Harrison, and Nathaniel P. Tallmadge. The image represents the formidable alliance of conservatives and Whigs that Van Buren faced in the election. (Tallmadge and Rives were conservative Democrats-turned-Whigs in opposition to Van Buren's fiscal programs.) Van Buren: "I can hold no longer to be forsaken at such a time by Maryland & Georgia too. Oh Curse that Cataline to force me to pass the Sub-Treasure Bill. " Calhoun: "If I had minded what [ally and political editor] Duff Green said to me this would not have happend. " Woodbury: "This is worse than getting White Washed. " Kendall: "Oh my dear Babys. " Kendall's remark probably refers to an incident in May of 1840 when a Whig mob discharged a cannon on his front lawn, frightening his children. This, combined with Van Buren's reference to the Independent Treasury Bill, passed by Congress in July 1840, suggests that "The Shipwreck" appeared {{during the second half of}} the year.
