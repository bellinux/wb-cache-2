To derive a quantitative ra-tionale for such discussions within Western Europe’s health care systems, a prospective assessment of both the benefit of TKA from a patient’s perspective {{as well as its}} cost effectiveness from a health care insur-er’s perspective was implemented. Methods: A prospective cost effectiveness trial recruit-ed a total of 65 patients (60 % females), who under-went TKA in 2006; median age of patients was 66 years (interquartile range 61 – 74 years). Before and three months after surgery patients were interviewed by means of the EuroQol- 5 D and the WOMAC ques-tionnaires to assess their individual benefit due to TKA and the subsequent inpatient rehabilitation. Both questionnaires ’ benefit estimates were transformed into the number of gained quality adjusted life years [QALYs]. Total direct cost estimates for the overall care were based on German DRG and rehabilitation cost rates [€]. The primary clinical endpoint of the in-vestigation was the individual number of QALYs gained by TKA based on the WOMAC interview; the primary health <b>economic</b> <b>endpoint</b> was the marginal cost effectiveness ratio (MCER) relating the costs to the associated gain in quality of life [€/QALY].

40|$|International audienceImage guided {{radiation}} therapy (IGRT) {{is a major}} technical innovation of radiotherapy. It allows locating the tumor under the linear accelerator just before the irradiation, by direct visualization (3 D mode soft tissue) or indirect visualization (2 D mode and radio-opaque markers). The technical implementation of IGRT is done by very different complex devices. The most common modality, because available in any new accelerator, is the cone beam CT. The main experiment of IGRT focuses on prostate cancer. Preliminary studies suggest the use of IGRT combined with IMRT should increase local control and decrease toxicity, especially rectal toxicity. In head and neck tumors, due to major deformation, a rigid registration is insufficient and replanning is necessary (adaptive radiotherapy).

40|$|BACKGROUND: Psoriasis and psoriatic {{arthritis}} (PsA) impair quality of life, including reduction in employment or job duties. The PRESTA (Psoriasis Randomized Etanercept STudy in Patients with Psoriatic Arthritis) study, a randomized, double-blind, two-dose trial, examined {{the efficacy of}} etanercept treatment in patients with moderate-to-severe plaque psoriasis and PsA and the main results have been presented previously. This analysis examined employment status, job duties and sick days, pre-defined endpoints in PRESTA, among this patient population. METHODS: Participants (N = 752) were randomized to receive etanercept 50 mg twice weekly (BIW; n = 379) or 50 mg once weekly (QW; n = 373) for 12 weeks by subcutaneous injection. All participants then received open-label etanercept 50 mg QW for 12 additional weeks, while remaining blinded to the randomization. A pharmacoeconomic questionnaire was administered at baseline, week 12 and week 24 of treatment. The questionnaire included employment status and changing job responsibilities and sick time taken due to psoriasis or PsA. The statistical methods included analysis of covariance, t-test, Fisher's exact test and McNemar's test. Last-observation-carried-forward imputation was used for missing data. RESULTS: Employment was at least maintained from baseline to week 24 in both dose groups (56 % [BIW/QW] and 60 % [QW/QW] at baseline, 61 % and 60 %, respectively, at week 24). Among employed participants, the proportion of patients whose job responsibilities changed due to PsA decreased significantly from baseline to week 24 (17 - 23 % to 5 - 8 %; p < 0. 01). Similar results were seen with job responsibility changes due to psoriasis (11 - 14 % to 4 %; p < 0. 01). The number of monthly sick days also decreased from baseline to week 24 (2. 4 days for both treatment groups to 0. 7 (BIW/QW) and 1. 1 (QW/QW); p </= 0. 03 for each). No {{significant differences between the}} treatment groups were observed for any <b>economic</b> <b>endpoint</b> at any time point. CONCLUSIONS: For patients with moderate-to-severe plaque psoriasis and PsA, etanercept treatment resulted in reducing job responsibility changes due to disease and in reducing sick time.

40|$|This {{study is}} funded by the NIHR Research for Patient Benefit Programme (PB-PG- 1013 - 32047), United Kingdom. BACKGROUND: Multiple {{sclerosis}} (MS) is an incurable, unpredictable but typically progressive neurological condition. It {{is the most common}} cause of neurological disability in young adults. Within 15  years of diagnosis, approximately 50  % of affected people are unable to walk unaided, and over time an estimated 25  % depend on a wheelchair. Typically, people with such limited mobility are excluded from clinical trials. Severely impaired people with MS spend much of their day sitting, often with limited ability to change position. In response, secondary complications can occur including: muscle wasting, pain, reduced skin integrity, spasms, limb stiffness, constipation, and associated psychosocial problems such as depression and lowered self-esteem. Effective self-management strategies, which can be implemented relatively easily and cheaply within people's homes, are needed to improve or maintain mobility and reduce sedentary behaviour. However this is challenging, particularly in the latter stages of disease. Regular supported standing using standing frames is one potential option. METHODS/DESIGN: SUMS is a pragmatic multi-centre randomised controlled trial evaluating use of Oswestry standing frames with blinded outcome assessment and full economic evaluation. Participants will be randomly allocated (1 : 1) to either a home-based, self-management standing programme (with advice and support) along with their usual care or to usual care alone. Those in the intervention group will be asked to stand for a minimum of 30  min three times weekly over 20  weeks. Each participant will be followed-up at 20 and 36  weeks post baseline. The primary clinical outcome is motor function, assessed using the Amended Motor Club Assessment. The primary <b>economic</b> <b>endpoint</b> is quality-adjusted life years. The secondary outcomes include measures of explanatory physical impairments, key clinical outcomes, and health–related quality of life. An embedded qualitative component will explore participant’s and carer’s experiences of the standing programme. DISCUSSION: This is the first large scale multi-centre trial to assess the clinical and cost effectiveness of a home based standing frame programme for people who are severely impaired by MS.

Despite this important service provision, coronary heart disease continues to be under-diagnosed and many patients are left untreated and at risk. Recent advances in imaging technology have now led to the widespread use of noninvasive computed tomography, which can be used to measure coronary artery calcium scores and perform coronary angiography in one examination. However, this technology has not been robustly evaluated in its application to the clinic. Methods/design: The SCOT-HEART study is an open parallel group prospective multicentre randomized controlled trial of 4, 138 patients attending the rapid access chest pain clinic for evaluation of suspected cardiac chest pain.

Furthermore, bearing demographic changes in Western Europe in mind, TKA-associated financial investment {{for health care}} insurers will increase notably and thereby catalyze discussions on ressource allocation to Orthopedic surgery. To derive a quantitative rationale for such discussions within Western Europe's health care systems, a prospective assessment of both the benefit of TKA from a patient's perspective {{as well as its}} cost effectiveness from a health care insurer's perspective was implemented. Methods A prospective cost effectiveness trial recruited a total of 65 patients (60 % females), who underwent TKA in 2006; median age of patients was 66 years (interquartile range 61 - 74 years). Before and three months after surgery patients were interviewed by means of the EuroQol- 5 D and the WOMAC questionnaires to assess their individual benefit due to TKA and the subsequent inpatient rehabilitation. Both questionnaires' benefit estimates were transformed into the number of gained quality adjusted life years [QALYs]. Total direct cost estimates for the overall care were based on German DRG and rehabilitation cost rates [€]. The primary clinical endpoint of the investigation was the individual number of QALYs gained by TKA based on the WOMAC interview; the primary health <b>economic</b> <b>endpoint</b> was the marginal cost effectiveness ratio (MCER) relating the costs to the associated gain in quality of life [€/QALY]. Results Total direct costs for the overall procedure were estimed 9549 € in median. The WOMAC based interview revealed an overall gain of 4. 59 QALYs (interquartile range 2. 39 - 6. 21 QALYs), resulting in marginal costs of 1795 €/QALY (1488 - 3288 €/QALY). The corresponding EuroQol based estimates were 2. 93 QALYs (1. 75 - 5. 59 QALYs) and 3063 €/QALY (1613 - 5291 €/QALY). Logistic regression modelling identified the patients' age as the primary determinant of cost effectiveness (Likelihood Ratio p = 0. 006) : patients younger than 60 years showed a median gain of 6. 45 QALYs and median marginal costs of 1463 €/QALY, patients between 60 - 70 years 5. 47 QALYs and 1744 €/QALY, patients older than 70 years 2. 76 QALYs and 3186 €/QALY. Conclusion TKA was proven to be cost effective from a health care insurer's perspective, although its marginal costs notably increased with increasing age. Note, however, that this age-related gradient in marginal cost effectiveness is of comparable order as the changes in cost effectiveness due to variation of the underlying assessment instrument. </p...|$|E
40|$|Abstract Background Greenhouse gas (GHG) {{mitigation}} policies {{can provide}} ancillary benefits {{in terms of}} short-term improvements in air quality and associated health benefits. Several studies have analyzed the ancillary impacts of GHG policies {{for a variety of}} locations, pollutants, and policies. In this paper we review the existing evidence on ancillary health benefits relating to air pollution from various GHG strategies and provide a framework for such analysis. Methods We evaluate techniques used in different stages of such research for estimation of: (1) changes in air pollutant concentrations; (2) avoided adverse health endpoints; and (3) economic valuation of health consequences. The limitations and merits of various methods are examined. Finally, we conclude with recommendations for ancillary benefits analysis and related research gaps in the relevant disciplines. Results We found that to date most assessments have focused their analysis more heavily on one aspect of the framework (e. g., economic analysis). While a wide range of methods was applied to various policies and regions, results from multiple studies provide strong evidence that the short-term public health and economic benefits of ancillary benefits related to GHG mitigation strategies are substantial. Further, results of these analyses are likely to be underestimates because {{there are a number of}} important unquantified health and <b>economic</b> <b>endpoints.</b> Conclusion Remaining challenges include integrating the understanding of the relative toxicity of particulate matter by components or sources, developing better estimates of public health and environmental impacts on selected sub-populations, and devising new methods for evaluating heretofore unquantified and non-monetized benefits. </p...|$|R
40|$|Increasing {{numbers of}} {{economic}} evaluations are conducted alongside randomised controlled trials. Such studies include factorial trials, which randomise patients to {{different levels of}} two or more factors and can therefore evaluate the effect of multiple treatments alone and in combination. Factorial trials can provide increased statistical power or assess interactions between treatments, but raise additional challenges for trial-based economic evaluations: interactions may occur more commonly for costs and quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) than for clinical endpoints; <b>economic</b> <b>endpoints</b> raise challenges for transformation and regression analysis; and both factors must be considered simultaneously to assess which treatment combination represents best value for money. This article aims to examine issues associated with factorial trials that include assessment of costs and/or cost-effectiveness, describe the methods {{that can be used to}} analyse such studies; and make recommendations for health economists, statisticians and trialists. A hypothetical worked example is used to illustrate the challenges and demonstrate ways in which economic evaluations of factorial trials may be conducted, and how these methods affect the results and conclusions. Ignoring interactions introduces bias that could result in adopting a treatment that does not make best use of healthcare resources, while considering all interactions avoids bias but reduces statistical power. We also introduce the concept of the opportunity cost of ignoring interactions as a measure of the bias introduced by not taking account of all interactions.

40|$|Objectives: Preterm birth {{contributes}} {{to a range of}} healthcare problems amongst infants surmounting to sizeable healthcare costs. Twin pregnancies are at particular risk of preterm birth. The objective {{of this study was to}} assess the cost-effectiveness of vaginal progesterone gel for the prevention of preterm birth in twin pregnancies. Methods: An economic evaluation was conducted alongside a randomized placebo controlled trial (the STOPPIT trial) of vaginal progesterone gel for the prevention of preterm birth in twin pregnancies. Five hundred women were recruited from nine maternity hospitals in the United Kingdom. The outcomes of the economic evaluation were presented in terms of net benefit statistics, cost-effectiveness acceptability curves, generated using the nonparametric bootstrap method, and the expected value of perfect information. Results: Mean health service costs between the period of randomization and discharge for mother and infant were £ 28, 031 in the progesterone group and £ 25, 972 in the placebo group, generating a mean nonsignificant cost difference of £ 2, 059 (bootstrap mean cost difference £ 2, 334; 95 percent confidence interval: −£ 5, 023, £ 9, 142; p =. 33). The probability of progesterone being cost-effective was 20 percent at a willingness to pay threshold of £ 30, 000 per preterm birth prevented. There is little economic justification for conducting further research into the use of vaginal progesterone gel in twin pregnancies for the prevention of preterm birth. Conclusions: Further studies of preventive interventions for preterm birth more generally are required given the scale of the clinical and economic burden of this condition. These studies should be sufficiently powered for <b>economic</b> <b>endpoints</b> and extend beyond hospital discharge...|$|R
40|$|A novel {{influenza}} virus has emerged {{to produce a}} global pandemic {{four times in the}} past one hundred years, resulting in millions of infections, hospitalizations and deaths. There is substantial uncertainty about when, where and how the next influenza pandemic will occur. We developed a novel mathematical model to chart the evolution of an influenza pandemic. We estimate the likely burden of future influenza pandemics through health and <b>economic</b> <b>endpoints.</b> An important component of this is the adequacy of existing hospital-resource capacity. Using a simulated population reflective of Ottawa, Canada, we model the potential impact of a future influenza pandemic under different combinations of pharmaceutical and non-pharmaceutical interventions. There was substantial variation in projected pandemic impact and outcomes across intervention scenarios. In a population of 1. 2 million, the illness attack rate ranged from 8. 4 % (all interventions) to 54. 5 % (no interventions); peak acute care hospital capacity ranged from 0. 2 % (all interventions) to 13. 8 % (no interventions); peak ICU capacity ranged from 1. 1 % (all interventions) to 90. 2 % (no interventions); and mortality ranged from 11 (all interventions) to 363 deaths (no interventions). Associated estimates of economic burden ranged from CAD $ 115 million to over $ 2 billion when extended mass school closure was implemented. Children accounted for a disproportionate number of pandemic infections, particularly in household settings. Pharmaceutical interventions effectively reduced peak and total pandemic burden without affecting timing, while non-pharmaceutical measures delayed and attenuated pandemic wave progression. The timely implementation of a layered intervention bundle appeared likely to protect hospital resource adequacy in Ottawa. The adaptable nature of this model provides value in informing pandemic preparedness policy planning in situations of uncertainty, as scenarios can be updated in real time as more data become available. However-given the inherent uncertainties of model assumptions-results should be interpreted with caution...|$|R
40|$|Background:In Japan, both {{incidence}} and mortality rates of cancers have continuously increased and medical costs are growing {{more rapidly than}} the overall economy of Japan. However, {{there is no consensus}} threshold for cost-effectiveness in medical care, and few studies have investigated cost-effectiveness of medical care in Japan. The present {{study was to determine the}} direct costs of molecular-targeting drugs that were recently approved in Japan through simple and quantitative calculations. Thus, we calculated an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) and the cost per life-year gained (LYG) by using reported data from randomized clinical trials for various cancers. Methods:Between 2008 and 2011, we reviewed seven molecular-targeting drugs that were approved for treatment of five cancers in Japan. These drugs included Bevacizumab, sorafenib, sunitinib, temsirolimus, Lapatinib, and panitumumab. Direct cost, ICER, and LYG of the drugs were estimated from the randomized phase III clinical trial data referred to in package leaflets. Effectiveness was defined as the prolongation of both median overall survival (OS) and progression-free survival (PFS). Costs were calculated as those of molecular-targeting drugs. Subsequently, ICER was based on 1 -month increases in both OS and PFS periods and 1 % increases in OS, and LYG was determined. Results:Direct costs ranged from ¥ 724, 804 ($ 9, 060) to ¥ 1, 506, 628 ($ 18, 833). ICERs of the drugs ranged from ¥ 724, 804 ($ 9, 060) to ¥ 1, 506, 628 ($ 18, 833) for a 1 -month increase in OS. For each month of PFS, ICERs ranged from ¥ 372, 243 ($ 4, 653) to ¥ 7, 399, 877 ($ 92, 498). The costs of Bevacizumab and sorafenib for treatment of HCC per 1 % increase in OS were ¥ 376, 657 ($ 4, 708) and ¥ 313, 733 ($ 3, 922), respectively. LYG ranged from ¥ 8, 697, 650 ($ 108, 721) to ¥ 18, 079, 530 ($ 225, 994). Conclusions:Some molecular-targeting drugs are not cost-effective.

40|$|Factorial {{randomised}} controlled trials (RCTs) evaluate {{two or more}} interventions simultaneously, enabling {{assessment of}} interactions between treatments. This thesis presents literature reviews, methodological reviews, simulation studies and applied case studies that explore methods for assessing cost-effectiveness based on factorial RCTs. My systematic review suggests that factorial RCTs account for around 3 % of trial-based economic evaluations, although there is currently no guidance or methodological work indicating the most appropriate methods. Around 40 % of published studies assumed no interaction between treatments and many were poorly-reported. Various mechanisms are likely to produce large interactions within <b>economic</b> <b>endpoints</b> such as costs, quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) and net benefits. Failing {{to take account of}} interactions can introduce bias and prevent efficient allocation of healthcare resources. I developed the opportunity cost of ignoring interactions as a measure of the implications of this bias. However, allowing for small, chance interactions is inefficient, potentially leading to over-investment in research if trial-based evaluations are used to inform decisions about subsequent research. Nonetheless, analyses on simulated trial data suggest that the opportunity cost of adopting a treatment that will not maximise health gains from the healthcare budget is minimised by including all interactions regardless of magnitude or statistical significance. Different approaches for conducting economic evaluations of factorial RCTs (including regression techniques, extrapolation using patient-level simulation, and considering different components of net benefit separately) are evaluated within three applied studies, including both full and partial factorials with 2 x 2 and 2 x 2 x 2 designs. I demonstrate that within both trial-based and model-based economic evaluation, efficient allocation of healthcare resources requires consideration of interactions between treatments, and joint decisions about interacting treatments based on incremental cost-effectiveness evaluated “inside-the-table” on a natural scale. I make recommendations for the design, analysis and reporting of factorial trial-based economic evaluations {{based on the results of}} this thesis.

40|$|The {{increased}} {{pressures on}} health care budgets have emphasised the need to demonstrate the value for money from health technologies. Most major pharmaceutical companies have therefore commissioned cost-benefit or cost-effectiveness analysis of their products. There is an assumed analogy between clinical trains, which are required for product licensing, and economic evaluations, which would help in justifying price and securing reimbursement. In most countries {{it is the responsibility}} of the pharmaceutical companies to provide adequate data on efficacy and safety, which is monitored by government. Cost-effectiveness data is only required by government in a few countries, although in others, including the United Kingdom, the pharmaceutical industry is being encouraged to provide such data for its products. Although clinical trial data are used in the marketing of products, they are usually perceived as scientific data in support of licensed implications. It is not clear whether the same is true for economic evaluation data, which may be more open to interpretation. This paper explores the extent to which the analogy between clinical trials and economic evaluation really applies. It considers whether there is a greater potential for bias in economic evaluations, whether the use of economic evaluations for price setting raises any ethical concerns, whether clinical endpoints are any ‘harder’ than <b>economic</b> <b>endpoints</b> and whether there is a need to set methodological standards for economic evaluation and to develop methods for scrutinizing the results of studies. It is concluded that, in principle, there should be no more bias in a well-conducted economic evaluation than in a clinical trial. However, economists need to improve the methodological standards of economic evaluations. Priority should be given to basing studies on good medical evidence, making measurements rather than assumptions where feasible, applying conventional tests of statistical significance and improving methods of quality of life measurement. Pharmaceutical sponsors should view economic evaluations as science, although, given the increased interest in value for money, such studies will also be useful in marketing and in encouraging a rational diffusion and use of medicines. pharmaceutical industry, clinical trials...|$|R

In a 2. 5 -yr randomized controlled study, combined beta(2) -agonist/corticosteroid therapy (BA + CS) and combined beta(2) -agonist/anticholinergic therapy(BA + AC) were compared with beta(2) -agonist/ placebo therapy (BA + FL). Included in the study were 274 patients 18 to 60 yr of age with moderately severe obstructive airways disease. The main clinical endpoints were lung function, hyperresponsiveness, restricted activity days, and symptom-free days. The <b>economic</b> <b>endpoints</b> were the costs of health care utilization. Compared with BA + FL, BA + CS led to significant improvements in FEV(1), PC 20, and symptom-free days. BA + AC did not differ from BA + PL in this respect. The respective annual acquisition costs of BA + CS, BA + AC, and BA + PL were 532 US$, 277 US$, and 156 US$. Thus, BA + CS costs 376 US$ more than BA + FL. However, compared with BA + PL therapy, BA + CS led to statistically significant savings in other health care costs of about 175 US$ (95 % CI from 46 to 303 US$). Thus, more than half of the additional costs of adding the inhaled corticosteroid are compensated for by a reduction in the costs of other health care services. Overall, inhaled corticosteroids lead to a small but net increase in health care costs of 201 US$ per patient per year. The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of BA + CS compared with BA + PL ranges from 200 US$ per 10 % increase in FEV(1) to 5 US$ per symptom-free day gained. In order to reach net societal savings the economic benefits of increased productivity due to inhaled corticosteroids have to be valued higher than 42 US$ per day. No significant differences in health care costs were found between the BA + AC and BA + PL groups. It can be concluded that the addition of an inhaled corticosteroid to a beta(2) -agonist leads to significant benefits in respiratory function and restricted activity days, which seem to be worth the relatively low additional health care costs, whereas addition of an anticholinergic agent appears expensive and of no long-term value...|$|R
40|$|Background: There is {{uncertainty}} about the benefit of chemotherapy for some patients with ER-positive HER 2 -negative early breast cancer. Multi-parameter assays of gene expression may enhance the value of chemotherapy through personalised treatment decisions. An economic evaluation was undertaken {{in the context of}} the feasibility phase of an RCT (OPTIMA prelim) designed to validate prospectively the use of such an assay as a treatment decision tool in the UK National Health Service (NHS). The aim of the economic evaluation was to confirm value in an ongoing RCT and optimise its design for <b>economic</b> <b>endpoints.</b> Comparators included (i) All patients treated with chemotherapy, (ii) Oncotype DX, (iii) MammaPrint/BluePrint and (iv) Prosigna. Methods: A model-based cost-effectiveness analysis was conducted to the standards of the UK National Institute for Care Excellence (NICE) reference case. A Markov model was constructed to simulate the care pathway of a cohort of patients with characteristics identified in the OPTIMA prelim study or, where unavailable, from the published literature. The costs (GBP) and benefits (QALYs) were estimated over a time horizon of the patient life-time. Alternative scenarios of recurrence rates and chemotherapy effect were explored in patients identified high or low risk by the tests and treated with and without chemotherapy. Scenarios included estimates based on the SWOG- 8814 trial, the EBCTCG and outcomes forecasted using Adjuvant! Online. Uncertainty introduced by discrepancy in patient selection between tests was modelled using a Bayesian decision analytic framework. Probabilistic sensitivity analysis and value of information analysis was conducted using Monte Carlo simulation. Results: There were 285 randomised patients. Multi-parameter analyses were performed on tumour samples and baseline factors were included in the model. The cost-effectiveness of all tests was uncertain. Uncertainty was predominantly driven by assumptions about long term recurrence rates in test-selected groups and the ability of tests to predict benefit from chemotherapy. The relationship between recurrence-free survival and life expectancy in test-selected groups and in patients who did or did not receive adjuvant chemotherapy was also important. The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) for Oncotype DX compared with chemotherapy for all was cost-effective in many scenarios, ranging from GBP 26, 000 per QALY to resulting in increased QALYs with cost savings (dominate), depending on assumptions. The value of information analysis placed high societal value in further research into recurrence-free survival for test-directed chemotherapy, irrespective of the test evaluated. Conclusion: There is substantial value in prospective comparative research into all tests evaluated, including long term outcomes, to resolve uncertainties in the clinical and economic optimal choice of test...|$|R

40|$|Alzheimer s disease (AD) is a {{neurodegenerative}} disorder causing dementia, a syndrome of gradual loss {{of cognitive}} function causing impairment in social and occupational functioning. This leads to substantial loss in {{quality of life and}} premature death for persons with the disease, associated suffering for their families and large costs to society. In parallel to the aging of the population the world prevalence is predicted to threefold within the next 40 years, creating a challenge for researchers and decision-makers to make better treatments available. Further, improved methods for economic evaluation in AD are needed to identify the optimal treatment strategies. The overall objective of this thesis is to explore the application of cost-utility analysis in AD and address key methodological challenges and data needs. In paper I, prediction functions for simulating disease progression and <b>economic</b> <b>endpoints</b> in a decision-analytic model were estimated. Three year follow-up data from the Swedish Alzheimer Treatment Study (SATS) on the natural course of AD of 435 patients commencing treatment with donepezil and their care setting and costs of care was analyzed. A simplified model in which cognition (representing the underlying course of disease) and the ability to perform activities of daily living (ADL) (representing patient care need) was assumed to predict the provision of care. According to the estimated statistical functions, cognition was found to be the key predictor of ADL-ability which itself was the main predictor of care setting and costs of care. In paper II, we used contingent valuation methods to elicit caregivers willingness-to-pay (WTP) for reductions in patient care need. In total, 517 caregivers of AD patients in four countries (Spain, Sweden, UK and US) were interviewed. The mean WTP for a one hour reduction per day was estimated at between £ 59 and £ 144 per month depending on country. The income of the caregiver was the only consistently significant determinant of WTP across all countries. In paper III, we assessed predictors of the costs of care of 1, 222 AD patients in four countries (Spain, Sweden, UK and US), both residing in the community and in residential care settings. Cognition, ADL-ability, behavioural symptoms and costs of care (RUD-Lite) were assessed via a patient and caregiver interview. Cost estimates ranged between £ 1, 000 to £ 5, 000 per patient and month, increasing with disease severity and higher in residential care settings. ADL-ability was the most important predictor of costs but part of the variation was also explained by cognition and behavioural symptoms. In paper IV, the key components and drivers of costs of care in a clinical trial sample of 2, 744 mild to moderate AD patients were identified. Costs were assessed with RUD-Lite at baseline and every 6 months over the 18 months trial. Informal care constituted 82 - 86 percent of total costs, whereas community care and patient accommodation constituted an equal share of 12 - 16 percent. Informal care also had the strongest correlation with disease severity measures including cognition, ADL-ability, global function and behavioural symptoms. In conclusion, cognition, ADL-ability and behavioural symptoms are all important indicators of care need in AD and should be considered in economic modelling. Caregivers have a substantial willingness to pay for reductions in care need. Informal care is the key cost component in clinical trials in mild to moderate AD. Health utility estimates of AD patients are highly dependent on the methodology including choice of instrument, respondent and utility tariffs...|$|R

Medical nutrition is regulated by a specific bill in Europe and in the US, with specific legislation and guidelines, and is provided to patients with special nutritional needs and indications for nutrition support. Therefore, medical nutrition products are delivered by medical prescription and supervised by health care professionals. Although these products have existed for more than 2 decades, health economic evidence of medical nutrition interventions is scarce. This research assesses the current published health economic evidence for medical nutrition by performing a systematic literature review related to health economic analysis of medical nutrition. Methods: A systematic literature search was done using standard literature databases, including PubMed, the Health Technology Assessment Database, and the National Health Service Economic Evaluation Database. Additionally, a free web-based search was conducted using the same search terms utilized in the systematic database search. The clinical background and basis of the analysis, health economic design, and results were extracted from the papers finally selected. The Drummond checklist was used to validate the quality of health economic modeling studies and the AMSTAR (A Measurement Tool to Assess Systematic Reviews) checklist was used for published systematic reviews. Results: Fifty-three papers were identified and obtained via PubMed, or directly via journal webpages for further assessment. Thirty-two papers were finally included in a thorough data extraction procedure, including those identified by a “gray literature search” utilizing the Google search engine and cross-reference searches. Results regarding content of the studies showed that malnutrition was the underlying clinical condition in most cases (32 %). In addition, gastrointestinal disorders (eg, surgery, cancer) were often analyzed. In terms of settings, 56 % of papers covered inpatients, whereas 14 papers (44 %) captured outpatients, including patients in community centers. Interestingly, {{in comparison with the}} papers identified overall, very few health economic models were found. Most of the articles were modeling analyses and economic trials in different design settings. Overall, only eight health economic models were published and were validated applying the Drummond checklist. In summary, most of the models included were carried out to quite a high standard, although some areas were identified for further improvement. Of the two systematic health economic reviews identified, one achieved the highest quality score when applying the AMSTAR checklist. Conclusion: The reasons for finding only a few modeling studies but quite a large number of clinical trials with health <b>economic</b> <b>endpoints,</b> might be different. Until recently, health economics has not been required for reimbursement or coverage decisions concerning medical nutrition interventions. Further, there might be specifics of medical nutrition which might not allow easy modeling and consequently explain the limited uptake so far. The health economic data on medical nutrition generated and published is quite ample. However, it has been primarily based on database analysis and clinical studies. Only a few modeling analyses have been carried out, indicating a need for further research to understand the specifics of medical nutrition and their applicability for health economic modeling.

40|$|Life Cycle Sustainability Assessment (LCSA) {{is often}} {{described}} as the most advanced approach for sustainability assessment, as its implementation allows for identifying trade-offs between the environmental, social and economic dimension. Yet, shortcomings for its practical implementation exist, as the three related methods – Life Cycle Assessment (LCA), Social Life Cycle Assessment (SLCA) and Life Cycle Costing (LCC) – {{do not have the same}} level of methodological and practical maturity. While LCA is widely implemented and standardized through the ISO-series 14040 and 14044, consensus on how to implement SLCA and LCC is missing. In this context, the discussion on adopting the commonly followed structure of LCA for SLCA and LCC plays a key role. While LCA includes well defined characterization models, SLCA misses concrete impact category definitions and LCC lacks an impact level at all. This further leads to inconsistent assessment approaches for SLCA and LCC. In addition, lacking guidance on the indicators and impact categories selection creates further obstacles for practical implementation. All this impairs the achievement of methodological improvements. Therefore, this thesis pursues a twofold approach by addressing both – the lack of guidance as well as the methodological shortcomings of SLCA and LCC. An in-depth review of existing LCSA indicators and impact categories is carried out, which builds the basis for the methodological developments addressing relevant topics of the social and economic dimension. In a first step, a criteria-based selection of impact categories and indicators is provided for the three methods – LCA, SLCA and LCC. The considered criteria are: practicality, relevance and method robustness. The resulting Tiered approach concept includes a hierarchical structure guiding practitioners through LCSA. Therefore, the basic ‘sustainability footprint’ at Tier 1 provides a starting point with simple but meaningful indicators – including global warming potential for the environmental dimension, fair wages for the social dimension, and value added for the economic dimension. Consecutively, additional impact and cost categories are implemented towards a comprehensive assessment level. Tier 2 in this context broadens the assessment by including indicators suggested by relevant institutions, such as the Joint Research Centre of the European Commission. Tier 3 also includes challenging indicators worth future consideration, such as land use and cultural heritage. Although, the implemented hierarchy itself provides focus on which impact categories and indicators to consider, it hardly contains solutions for the inherent methodological challenges. Yet, the Tier 1 level provides the basis for the methodological improvements targeted within this work. To tackle methodological differences and to align the three LCSA methods, it is focused on the different demands of SLCA and LCC. For SLCA concrete characterization models and impact descriptions are needed, while LCC requires the definition of an impact level in the first place. Accordingly, for SLCA a characterization model for fair wages is developed by also addressing the related impact pathway. With regard to the economic dimension, a new framework for economic assessments by means of Economic Life Cycle Assessment (EcLCA) is suggested defining different economic impact categories, followed by the development of a specific characterization model considering value added at Tier 1. With the fair wage characterization model a consistent and quantitative way of determining a specific set of social impacts along a product’s life cycle is presented. The inclusion of fair wages at the midpoint level allows to account for workers´ economic situation and embodies a necessary requirement for an adequate living standard. The performed case studies confirmed the general applicability of both the fair wage method and the associated database. Certain specifics of the characterization model require further investigations, such as the included inequality factor and the results´ relation to the functional unit. With the definition of the EcLCA framework and the coherent <b>economic</b> midpoint and <b>endpoint</b> impact categories as well as economic areas of protection, a broader perspective for the economic dimension within the LCSA framework is provided. Relevant relations between the midpoint and endpoint level are displayed through the defined impact pathway, e. g. the connection between a product´s or organization’s value added and an economy´s prosperity is addressed. Following on the conceptual nature of the EcLCA approach and enabling the development of concrete characterization models, a starting point is provided with a defined impact category ‘profitability’, which connects the value added indicator to an economic impact pathway. The developed characterization model allows for displaying economic impacts by means of the value added along a product´s life cycle. Therewith, the different production locations can be compared and differences and imbalances between them can be displayed. Nonetheless, the performed case studies revealed some challenges with regard to the reflection of producers far up- or downstream the supply chain. While primary data can typically be gathered for the direct producer, no economic secondary database has so far been established reflecting the up- or downstream supply chain. Despite those challenges, the impact categories considered within the ‘sustainability footprint’ represent crucial topics of production processes, by including global warming potential representing an important environmental concern, fair wage representing the workers´ situation, and profitability addressing the organizations´ performance. Furthermore, the Tiered approach as well as the methodological developments show that an alignment of the different maturity levels of LCA, SLCA and LCC (by means of EcLCA) is possible. Moreover, it shows that quantitative and applicable characterization models can be achieved for SLCA and that impact categories as well as characterization models can be defined for the economic dimension of LCSA. Die lebenszyklusbezogene Nachhaltigkeitsbewertung (Life Cycle Sustainability Assessment) wird oft als der fortschrittlichste Ansatz im Bereich der Nachhaltigkeitsbewertung beschrieben. Über die Berücksichtigung der drei Nachhaltigkeitsdimensionen – Umwelt, Gesellschaft und Wirtschaft – wird (zumindest theoretisch) die Identifikation von Zielkonflikten ermöglicht. In der praktischen Implementierung bestehen allerdings Unzulänglichkeiten, da die drei Kernmethoden – die Ökobilanz (Life Cycle Assessment), die Sozialbilanz (Social Life Cycle Assessment) und die Kostenbilanz (Life Cycle Costing) – keinen vergleichbaren Reifegrad aufweisen. Während die Ökobilanz bereits über die ISO-Serie 14040 ff. standardisiert ist und großflächig angewendet wird, besteht kein Konsens wie die Sozial- und Kostenbilanz implementiert werden sollen. Vor diesem Hintergrund spielt die Adaptierung der Ökobilanz-Struktur innerhalb der Sozial- und Kostenbilanz eine nicht untergeordnete Rolle in der wissenschaftlichen Diskussion. Gemäß der Standardisierung und der gängigen Praxis existieren für die Ökobilanz konkrete Charakterisierungsmodelle, während für die Sozialbilanz bislang lediglich grobe Definitionen potentieller Charakterisierungsmodelle bestehen und für die Kostenbilanz die Definition eines Wirkungskategorie-Levels komplett fehlt. Für die beiden letztgenannten Methoden führt dies zu inkonsistenten Bewertungsansätzen, als auch zu einer unklaren Auswahl von Indikatoren und Wirkungskategorien. Beides behindert die methodische Weiterentwicklung dieser Methoden. In dieser Doktorarbeit wird entsprechend ein zweigeteilter Ansatz verfolgt, der sowohl die praktische Anwendbarkeit als auch die methodische Reife der Sozial- und Kostenbilanz adressiert. Hierfür erfolgt zunächst ein Review der lebenszyklusbezogenen Nachhaltigkeitsbewertung samt den existierenden Indikatoren und Wirkungskategorien. Dieses bildet die Basis für die im weiteren Verlauf angestrebten methodischen Weiterentwicklungen für ausgewählte soziale und wirtschaftliche Belange. In einem ersten Schritt wird dafür ein kriterien-basierte Auswahl von Indikatoren und Wirkungskategorien für die drei Methoden präsentiert. Die hierfür berücksichtigten Kriterien sind: Praktikabilität, Relevanz und methodische Reife. Das daraus resultierend Konzept (Tiered approach) führt den Anwender mit Hilfe einer hierarchischen Struktur in mehreren Schritten durch die Nachhaltigkeitsbewertung. Der ‚nachhaltige Fußabdruck‘ (Sustainability Footprint) auf der untersten Ebene bildet hierbei den Startpunkt. Er berücksichtigt einfache aber relevante Indikatoren als Repräsentanz der drei Nachhaltigkeitsdimensionen, namentlich das Treibhauspotential, Faire Löhne und Wertschöpfung. Nach und nach werden weitere Wirkungs- und Kostenkategorien berücksichtigt. Auf der zweiten Ebene wird entsprechend eine breitere Bewertungsbasis angestrebt, wobei Indikatoren berücksichtigt werden, die von internationalen Institutionen vorgeschlagen wurden. Auf der dritten und letzten Ebene werden zusätzlich Indikatoren mit hoher zukünftiger Relevanz berücksichtigt, die allerdings Herausforderungen in der Anwendbarkeit innehaben können. Die bereitgestellte Hierarchie bietet zwar eine Auswahl und Strukturierung von relevanten Indikatoren innerhalb der drei Nachhaltigkeitsdimensionen, präsentiert aber mitnichten Lösungen für die methodischen Herausforderungen. Über die Definition des ‚nachhaltigen Fußabdrucks‘ wird jedoch die Basis für erste methodische Weiterentwicklungen im Rahmen dieser Arbeit gelegt. Zur Angleichung der methodischen Unterschiede der drei Methoden innerhalb der Nachhaltigkeitsbewertung müssen im Anschluss die verschiedenen Ausgangssituationen der Methoden, besonders der Sozial- und Kostenbilanz, berücksichtigt werden. Während für die Sozialbilanz konkrete Charakterisierungsmodelle notwendig sind, erfordert die Angleichung der Kostenbilanz-Struktur zunächst die Definition von Wirkungskategorien. Entsprechend wird innerhalb dieser Thesis der Fokus auf die Entwicklung eines quantitativen Charakterisierungsmodells für Faire Löhne innerhalb der Sozialbilanz gelegt. Für die ökonomische Dimension erfolgt zunächst eine Anpassung der generellen Kostenbilanzierungsstruktur, die über das vorgeschlagene Konzept des Economic Life Cycle Assessments implementiert wird. Hierin werden ökonomische Schutzgüter und Wirkungskategorien vorgeschlagen. Dies bereitet zudem die Basis für die Entwicklung eines ersten Charakterisierungsmodells zur Implementierung von Wertschöpfungsaspekten innerhalb des ‚nachhaltigen Fußabdrucks‘. Mit dem Charakterisierungsmodell für Faire Löhne wird eine quantitative Vorgehensweise präsentiert, die es erlaubt soziale Wirkungen entlang eines Produktlebenszyklus‘ zu determinieren. Über die Wirkungskategorie kann der sozioökonomischen Situation von Arbeitern Rechnung getragen werden, die als Voraussetzung für einen angemessenen Lebensstandard gesehen werden kann. Die im Rahmen der Arbeit durchgeführten Fallstudien bestätigen die generelle Anwendbarkeit des entwickelten Ansatzes sowie auch der zugehörigen Datenbank. Nichtsdestotrotz erfordern einige Aspekte des Charakterisierungsmodells weiterführende Forschung, z. B. der inhärente Faktor zur Bemessung der Einkommensungleichheit sowie die Beziehung der Ergebnisse zur funktionellen Einheit. Mit der konzeptionellen Entwicklung des neuen ökonomischen Bewertungsansatzes (Economic Life Cycle Assessment) wird eine breitere Perspektive für die ökonomische Nachhaltigkeitsdimension im Vergleich zur klassischen Kostenbilanz vorgestellt. Relevante Beziehungen zwischen den Wirkungsmitt- und Endpunkten entlang einer ökonomischen Ursache-Wirkungs-Kette werden eingeführt. So konnte beispielsweise gezeigt werden wie die Wertschöpfung auf Unternehmensebene mit wirtschaftlichem Wohlstand zusammenhängt. In diesem Zusammenhang wurde auch ein erstes Charakterisierungsmodell für die Wirkungskategorie ‚Profitabilität‘ entwickelt. Hierüber können Aspekte der Wertschöpfung entlang eines Produktlebenszyklus‘ dargestellt werden. Dies erlaubt den Vergleich verschiedener Produktionsstandorte und die Identifikation von Ungleichgewichten zwischen den Standorten. Über die durchgeführten Fallstudien wurden einhergehende Herausforderungen identifiziert, vor allem im Zusammenhang mit Produzenten am unteren und oberen Ende der Wertschöpfungskette. Hier spielt das Fehlen sekundärer Datenbanken eine entscheidende Rolle, da Primärdaten typischerweise nur für den Endproduzenten verfügbar sind. Abgesehen von den benannten Herausforderungen repräsentieren die Wirkungskategorien, die innerhalb des ‚nachhaltigen Fußabdrucks‘ identifiziert wurden und für die (erste) Charakterisierungsmodelle entwickelt wurden, relevante Aspekte innerhalb von Produktionsprozessen. Das Treibhauspotential ist von entscheidender globaler und ökologischer Bedeutung, während Faire Löhne einen Kernaspekt für Arbeitnehmer und ihre Arbeitssituation darstellen und Wertschöpfungsaspekte Relevanz für den Erfolg von Organisationen haben. Über den in dieser Thesis entwickelten Tiered Approach und die resultierenden methodischen Weiterentwicklungen konnte gezeigt werden, dass eine Angleichung der Bilanzierungspraxis innerhalb der drei Nachhaltigkeitsdimensionen erreicht werden kann. Weiter konnte gezeigt werden, dass für die Sozialbilanz quantitative Charakterisierungsmodelle möglich sind und auch innerhalb der ökonomischen Dimension Wirkungskategorien und Charakterisierungsmodelle definiert werden können...|$|R
