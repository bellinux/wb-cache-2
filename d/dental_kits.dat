50|$|Dental care {{may be most}} {{important}} while grooming, just like humans a clean mouth can impact the pets health greatly as it ages. This is however quite a difficult mission, given that dogs hardly allow their teeth to be brushed. The <b>dental</b> <b>kits</b> available on the market include everything from special tooth paste to toothbrushes. Many models of toothbrushes include a three flexible head design which maintains the proper pressure on all surfaces of the tooth with every stroke. These brushes have side bristles set the 45-degree angles to reduce the arm twisting and soft outer bristles for massaging the gums. Toothpaste designed to be used on dogs is usually natural sugar free toothpaste with different flavoring. Foaming or rinsing is not necessary.|$|E
5000|$|Cathay Pacific {{introduced}} a Premium Economy Class in March 2012. The seat pitch will be 38 inches - six inches more than Economy Class - and the seat itself will be wider {{and have a}} bigger recline. It will have a large meal table, cocktail table, footrest, a 10.6-inch personal television, an in-seat power outlet, a multi-port connector for personal devices, and extra personal stowage space. The Premium Economy Class seat offers {{a higher level of}} comfort with more living space in a separate cabin before the Economy Class zone. Passengers will also receive an [...] "environmentally friendly" [...] amenity <b>kit</b> with <b>dental</b> <b>kit,</b> socks and eyeshade for use during the journey. Larger pillows and noise-cancelling headsets will be provided. The new Premium Economy cabin will be installed on most Cathay Pacific long-haul aircraft. The first Boeing 777-300ER and Airbus A330-300 featuring Premium Economy Class has entered into service in March (substituting for regional aircraft) and scheduled service in April.|$|R
50|$|The 14-story Centurion Tower was {{completed}} in 1970 {{at a cost of}} $4.2 million. In 2011 it was announced that the tower would be renovated and be renamed to Nobu, and to operate as the first Nobu Hotel with a restaurant. The concept was that the tower was to be a boutique hotel within the resort. Because the exterior was unchanged, the interior with only 181 rooms, small by Vegas standards, is more spacious with bigger rooms than the standard hotel. The motif is Asian luxury with high end amenities, including a sake bar and strict security which uses optical scanners. Each room has a sitting area, a spacious bedroom with black lacquered furniture and artworks. The bathroom contains a double-sized stall with a teak shower stall, black tiles and a large rain-style showerhead. Luxury toiletries like razors and shaving cream, <b>dental</b> <b>kit</b> and other high-end products exceed the usual offerings at US hotels. Electronics include charging devices and flat screen TVs with multiple outlets throughout the room.|$|R
5000|$|... Health for Kids, a new {{initiative}} for 2013 providing nit treatment, nit combs, hand sanitiser, band-aids and tissues for KidsCan partner schools. Over 2000 children were supported when the programme launched in Kaitaia - over 1000 basic hygiene items and 290 prescription medicines were provided. KidsCan have also partnered with Lumino the Dentists to provide Lumino <b>dental</b> hygiene <b>kits</b> and free <b>dental</b> care to families of children at KidsCan partner schools on Lumino Day.|$|R
40|$|Summary: Although dental {{injuries}} are common occurrences at swimming pools, {{there are very}} few publications about them. The {{purpose of this study was}} to interview pool attendants at public swimming pools/bathing resorts in Switzerland on lip and dental injuries in 2007. The questions focussed on their knowledge of first aid, the frequency and accident site of lip and tooth trauma, as well as the storage medium for avulsed teeth. Questions were also asked about the presence of a "dental first-aid kit" and the poster on dental first aid. 606 public pools were contacted, and one pool attendant per pool was interviewed by telephone. 553 individuals participated; 53 declined to take part. The results show that in 2007, 40 % of the interviewed pool attendants (n = 221) had witnessed at least one lip injury, and 36. 9 % (n = 204) at least one tooth trauma. At pools with slides, accidents were more frequent (p> 0. 001), and the waterslide was the most common accident site. The pool attendants provided satisfactory answers on their actions after lip and dental injuries. However, 68. 7 % could not adequately answer the questions on storage of avulsed teeth. Only 74 pool attendants had a <b>dental</b> first-aid <b>kit.</b> Of these, only 68 used the kits as the storage medium for avulsed teeth. 59 pool attendants were in possession of the poster on dental first aid. Overall, it was shown that pool attendants who had a <b>dental</b> first-aid <b>kit</b> and a <b>dental</b> first aid poster gave better answers on how to handle tooth trauma...|$|R
40|$|Dental amalgam {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{commonly}} used materials in restorative dentistry. However, one of its major components, mercury, is of particular concern due to its potential adverse effects on humans and the environment. In this review, the environmental impact of dental amalgam will be discussed, with particular reference to the effects attributed to its mercury component. Mercury commonly occurs in nature as sulfides and in a number of minerals. Globally, between 20, 000 - 30, 000 tons of mercury are discharged into the environment each year as a result of human activities. According to a recent German report, approximately 46 per cent of the freshly triturated amalgam is inserted as new amalgam restorations and the rest is waste. Depending on the presence of an amalgam separating unit, some of the generated amalgam-contaminated sludge is discharged into the sewage system. Lost or extracted teeth with amalgam fillings and amalgam-contaminated waste, such as trituration capsules and cotton rolls are discharged with the solid waste and, in most instances, are incinerated. Use of disinfectants containing oxidizing substances in <b>dental</b> aspirator <b>kits</b> may contribute to remobilization of mercury and its subsequent release into the environment. Nevertheless, dental mercury contamination is only a small proportion of terrestrial mercury (3 - 4 per cent), which is quite insignificant compared with industrial pollution and combustion of fossil fuels by vehicles. The environmental impact of dental mercury is mainly due to the poor management of dental amalgam waste. Proper collection of mercury-contaminated solid waste prevents the release of mercury vapour during combustion. In addition, the use of amalgam separating devices reduces the amount of amalgam-contaminated water released from dental clinics...|$|R
40|$|To {{investigate}} {{the involvement of}} intrinsic mitochondrial apoptosis in dental monomer-induced cytotoxicity and the influences of N-acetyl cysteine (NAC) on this process. Human dental pulp cells (hDPCs) were exposed to several dental monomers in the absence or presence of NAC, and cell viability, intracellular redox balance, morphology and function of mitochondria and key indicators of intrinsic mitochondrial apoptosis were evaluated using various commercial <b>kits.</b> <b>Dental</b> monomers exerted dose-dependent cytotoxic effects on hDPCs. Concomitant to the over-production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and depletion of glutathione (GSH), differential changes in activities of superoxide dismutase, glutathione peroxidase, and catalase were detected. Apoptosis, as indicated by positive Annexin V/propidium iodide (PI) staining and activation of caspase- 3, was observed after dental monomer treatment. Dental monomers impaired the morphology and function of mitochondria, and induced intrinsic mitochondrial apoptosis in hDPCs via up-regulation of p 53, Bax and cleaved caspase- 3, and down-regulation of Bcl- 2. NAC restored cell viability, relieved oxidative stress and blocked the apoptotic effects of dental monomers. Dental monomers induced oxidative stress and mitochondrial intrinsic apoptosis in hDPCs. NAC could reduce the oxidative stress and thus protect hDPCs against dental monomer-induced apoptosis...|$|R
40|$|The {{main reason}} {{of this study}} is mainly {{represented}} by the C Scan (En Face) OCT time domain investigation of acetone dynamic effects induced to the superficial layer of acrylic teeth. One of the organic solvents used in order to improve the adhesion of acrylic teeth to denture base resin is acetone. The ridge lap area of 20 acrylic second upper molars (Spofa <b>Dental</b> complete denture <b>kit)</b> was milled to flat. Afterwards the molars with the milled ridge lap area were cut in two halves. The artificial teeth were randomly assigned in 2 groups. : Group 1. (control) (without treatment), Group 2. Acetone treatment. The both sample groups were submitted to OCT C Scan (En Face) investigation for 200 seconds. The both sample groups were also submitted to SEM (Scanning Electron Microscopy) nondestructive investigation. The dynamical changes of acrylic teeth superficial layer induced by acetone, among which the superficial layer hardening, were captured with C Scan OCT, proving the fact that time domain C scan OCT could be used in order to investigate the dynamics of the effects of this organic solvent to the polymeric acrylic teeth substrate...|$|R
