5|$|The viral load of an {{infected}} person {{is an important}} risk factor in both sexual and mother-to-child transmission. During the first 2.5months of an HIV infection a person's infectiousness is twelve times higher due to this high viral load. <b>If</b> <b>the</b> <b>person</b> <b>is</b> in the late stages of infection, rates of transmission are approximately eightfold greater.|$|E
5|$|In addition, at {{some time}} between {{the date of the}} writ of {{election}} and 12:00 noon on nomination day, the potential candidate or someone on his or her behalf must hand to the returning officer a deposit amounting to three times of 8% of the total allowances payable to an MP in the preceding calendar year, rounded to the nearest $500. At the 2017 presidential election, the deposit was $43,500. The deposit is returned <b>if</b> <b>the</b> <b>person</b> <b>is</b> not nominated as a candidate, withdraws his or her candidature, or is eventually elected. If the candidate is unsuccessful at the election, the deposit is only repaid if he or she polled more than one-eighth {{of the total number of}} votes polled, not including rejected votes.|$|E
5|$|Olfactory {{communication}} {{is very important}} in this species. It has roles in alerting others of the identity, physical state and position of the individual. It is also important in reproduction. Like other slow lorises, the Sunda slow loris has glands on its elbows that exude oils. The gland is licked to spread scent and is thought to have evolved for communication, but it is toxic to humans. <b>If</b> <b>the</b> <b>person</b> <b>is</b> allergic to the animal they can go into shock and could even die. It also has glands on its anus and can signal conspecifics by perineal rubbing which deposits urine. When it locates the scent of another slow loris it may rub its face on the substrate where the scent was found.|$|E

5|$|The WHO {{guidelines}} recommend prompt {{oral administration}} of drugs when pain occurs, starting, <b>if</b> <b>the</b> <b>person</b> <b>is</b> not in severe pain, with non-opioid {{drugs such as}} paracetamol, dipyrone, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs or COX-2 inhibitors. Then, if complete pain relief is not achieved or disease progression necessitates more aggressive treatment, mild opioids such as codeine, dextropropoxyphene, dihydrocodeine or tramadol {{are added to the}} existing non-opioid regime. If this is or becomes insufficient, mild opioids are replaced by stronger opioids such as morphine, while continuing the non-opioid therapy, escalating opioid dose until the person is painless or the maximum possible relief without intolerable side effects has been achieved. If the initial presentation is severe cancer pain, this stepping process should be skipped and a strong opioid should be started immediately in combination with a non-opioid analgesic.|$|E
5|$|The {{specific}} type of postremission therapy is individualized based on a person's prognostic factors (see above) and general health. For good-prognosis leukemias (i.e. inv(16), t(8;21), and t(15;17)), people will typically undergo an additional three to five courses of intensive chemotherapy, known as consolidation chemotherapy. For people {{at high risk of}} relapse (e.g. those with high-risk cytogenetics, underlying MDS, or therapy-related AML), allogeneic stem cell transplantation is usually recommended <b>if</b> <b>the</b> <b>person</b> <b>is</b> able to tolerate a transplant and has a suitable donor. The best postremission therapy for intermediate-risk AML (normal cytogenetics or cytogenetic changes not falling into good-risk or high-risk groups) is less clear and depends on the specific situation, including the age and overall health of the person, the person's values, and whether a suitable stem cell donor is available.|$|E

25|$|After a {{successful}} approach, negatively buoyant {{objects such as}} a weight belt are removed. The priority is then to transport the person to the water's edge in preparation for removal from the water. The person is turned on their back with a secure grip used to tow from behind. <b>If</b> <b>the</b> <b>person</b> <b>is</b> cooperative they may be towed {{in a similar fashion}} held at the armpits. <b>If</b> <b>the</b> <b>person</b> <b>is</b> unconscious they may be pulled in a similar fashion held at the chin and cheeks, ensuring that the mouth and nose are well above the water.|$|E
25|$|Benzoic acid {{is present}} {{as part of}} hippuric acid (N-benzoylglycine) in urine of mammals, {{especially}} herbivores (Gr. hippos = horse; ouron = urine). Humans produce about 0.44 g/L hippuric acid in their urine, and <b>if</b> <b>the</b> <b>person</b> <b>is</b> exposed to toluene or benzoic acid, it can rise above that level.|$|E
25|$|In power {{transmission}} systems, {{one side of}} the circuit, known as the neutral, is grounded to dissipate static electricity and to reduce hazardous voltages caused by insulation failure and other electrical faults. It is possible to get a shock by only touching the hot wire, due to the person's body being capacitively coupled to the ground upon which the person stands, even <b>if</b> <b>the</b> <b>person</b> <b>is</b> standing on an insulated surface.|$|E
25|$|Scientific {{investigations}} on residual neural plasticity {{in adulthood}} now also include {{studies on the}} recovery of stereopsis. Now {{it is a matter}} of active scientific investigation under which conditions and to which degree binocular fusion and stereo vision can be acquired in adulthood, especially <b>if</b> <b>the</b> <b>person</b> <b>is</b> not known to have had any preceding experience of stereo vision, and how outcomes may depend on the patient's history of therapeutic interventions.|$|E
25|$|In {{the cases}} of some throat cancers, the air {{passages}} in the mouth and behind the nose may become blocked from lumps or the swelling from the open sores. If the throat cancer is {{near the bottom of}} the throat it has a high likelihood of spreading to the lungs and interfering with the person’s ability to breathe; this is even more likely <b>if</b> <b>the</b> <b>person</b> <b>is</b> a smoker, because they are highly susceptible to lung cancer.|$|E

However, such rescue missions may never happen <b>if</b> <b>the</b> <b>person</b> <b>is</b> not known to still be alive, if {{the fact that they are}} missing is unknown or if the island is not mapped. These scenarios have given rise to the plots of numerous stories in the form of novels and film.|$|E
25|$|The {{sensation}} of weight {{is caused by}} the force exerted by fluids in the vestibular system, a three-dimensional set of tubes in the inner ear.

25|$|Resorts may ban persons {{convicted of}} sex, drug, or violent crimes. Policies vary, but might include doing a {{criminal}} record check or checking a sex offender registry. However, minor crimes related to naturism are usually excluded, even <b>if</b> <b>the</b> <b>person</b> <b>is</b> {{required by law to}} register. (Requirements vary substantially from one jurisdiction to the next.) An example would be someone who thought they were in a secluded area while nude bathing with no lewd intent, but were charged with a crime anyhow.|$|E
25|$|The {{breath test}} uses {{radioactive}} carbon to detect H. pylori. To perform this exam the person {{will be asked}} to drink a tasteless liquid which contains the carbon as part of the substance that the bacteria breaks down. After an hour, the person {{will be asked to}} blow into a bag that is sealed. <b>If</b> <b>the</b> <b>person</b> <b>is</b> infected with H. pylori, the breath sample will contain radioactive carbon dioxide. This test provides the advantage of being able to monitor the response to treatment used to kill the bacteria.|$|E
25|$|A {{reasonable}} guideline is {{to treat}} people age >1 year within 3 weeks of cough onset and infants age <1 year and pregnant women within 6 weeks of cough onset. <b>If</b> <b>the</b> <b>person</b> <b>is</b> diagnosed late, antibiotics will not alter {{the course of the}} illness, and even without antibiotics, they should no longer be spreading pertussis. Antibiotics when used early decrease the duration of infectiousness, and thus prevent spread. Short-term antibiotics (azithromycin for 3–5 days) are as effective as long-term treatment (erythromycin 10–14 days) in eliminating B. pertussis with fewer and less severe side effects.|$|E
25|$|Esophageal {{dysphagia}} {{is almost}} always caused by disease in or adjacent to the esophagus but occasionally the lesion is in the pharynx or stomach. In many of the pathological conditions causing dysphagia, the lumen becomes progressively narrowed and indistensible. Initially only fibrous solids cause difficulty but later the problem can extend to all solids and later even to liquids. Patients with difficulty swallowing may benefit from thickened fluids <b>if</b> <b>the</b> <b>person</b> <b>is</b> more comfortable with those liquids, although, so far, there are no scientific study that proves that those thickened liquids are beneficial.|$|E
25|$|AF {{is often}} treated with {{medications}} {{to slow the}} heart rate to a near normal range (known as rate control) or to convert the rhythm to normal sinus rhythm (known as rhythm control). Electrical cardioversion {{can also be used}} to convert AF to a normal sinus rhythm and is often used emergently <b>if</b> <b>the</b> <b>person</b> <b>is</b> unstable. Ablation may prevent recurrence in some people. Depending on the risk of stroke either aspirin or anti-clotting medications such as warfarin or a novel oral anticoagulant may be recommended. While these medications reduce this risk, they increase rates of major bleeding.|$|E
25|$|An RCD {{helps to}} protect against {{electric}} shock when current flows through a person from a phase (live / line / hot) to earth. It cannot protect against electric shock when current flows through a person from phase to neutral or from phase to phase, for example where a finger touches both live and neutral contacts in a light fitting; a device cannot differentiate between current flow through an intended load from flow through a person, though the RCD may still trip <b>if</b> <b>the</b> <b>person</b> <b>is</b> {{in contact with the}} ground (earth), as some current may still pass through the persons finger and body to earth.|$|E
25|$|H2-receptor antagonists: include {{cimetidine}} (Tagamet), famotidine (Pepcid), nizatidine (Axid), and ranitidine (Zantac). Reduced secretion of {{gastric acid}} and pepsin produced by H2 blockers can reduce absorption of protein-bound (dietary) vitamin B12, {{but not of}} supplemental vitamin B12. Gastric acid is needed to release vitamin B12 from protein for absorption. Clinically significant vitamin B12 deficiency and megaloblastic anemia are unlikely, unless H2 blocker therapy is prolonged (2 years or more), or the person's diet is poor. It is also more likely <b>if</b> <b>the</b> <b>person</b> <b>is</b> rendered achlorhydric(with complete absence of gastric acid secretion), which occurs more frequently with proton pump inhibitors than H2 blockers. Vitamin B12 levels should be monitored in people taking high doses of H2 blockers for prolonged periods.|$|E
25|$|AF often occurs after {{cardiac surgery}} {{and is usually}} self-limiting. It is {{strongly}} associated with age, preoperative hypertension, {{and the number of}} vessels grafted. Measures should be taken to control hypertension preoperatively {{to reduce the risk of}} AF. Also, people with a higher risk of AF, e.g., people with pre-operative hypertension, more than 3 vessels grafted, or greater than 70 years of age, should be considered for prophylactic treatment. Postoperative pericardial effusion is also suspected to be the cause of atrial fibrillation. Prophylaxis may include prophylactic postoperative rate and rhythm management. Some authors perform posterior pericardiotomy to reduce the incidence of postoperative AF. When AF occurs, management should primarily be rate and rhythm control. However, cardioversion may be employed <b>if</b> <b>the</b> <b>person</b> <b>is</b> hemodynamically unstable, highly symptomatic, or persists for 6 weeks after discharge. In persistent cases, anticoagulation should be used.|$|E
25|$|Immobility is a {{significant}} risk factor {{in the development of}} thrombosis. Immediate post-surgical interventions,(out of bed orders (OOB), are typically ordered by the physician to prevent thrombosis. These orders are typically delegated to a nurse, but may include the participation of a physical therapist and others trained to perform the intervention. are to perform range of motion (ROM) activities that include: muscle contractions of the lower legs for those who are very weak, moving the feet, wiggling the toes, bending the knees, raise and lower the legs. In addition, changes in positioning prevents immobility and shifts areas of venous stasis. <b>If</b> <b>the</b> <b>person</b> <b>is</b> too weak to perform these preventative activities, hospital personnel will perform these movements independently. Exercise of the lower extremeties is a post-operative method of prophlaxsis. Nursing personnel will often perform range of motion exercises and encourage frequent moving of the legs, feet, and ankles. Frequent positioning changes and adequate fluid intake. After a surgical procedure, ambulation as soon as possible is prophylactic in preventing the formation of blood clots.|$|E
25|$|Scabies may be {{diagnosed}} clinically in geographical areas {{where it is}} common when diffuse itching presents along with either lesions in two typical spots or itchiness is present in another household member. The classical sign of scabies is the burrow made by a mite within the skin. To detect the burrow, the suspected area is rubbed with ink from a fountain pen or a topical tetracycline solution, which glows under a special light. The skin is then wiped with an alcohol pad. <b>If</b> <b>the</b> <b>person</b> <b>is</b> infected with scabies, the characteristic zigzag or S pattern of the burrow will appear across the skin; however, interpreting this test may be difficult, as the burrows are scarce and may be obscured by scratch marks. A definitive diagnosis is made by finding either the scabies mites or their eggs and fecal pellets. Searches for these signs involve either scraping a suspected area, mounting the sample in potassium hydroxide and examining it under a microscope, or using dermoscopy to examine the skin directly.|$|E
25|$|However, {{it may not}} be {{necessary}} for a public authority to provide a formal opportunity for a person to make representations before a decision is taken <b>if</b> <b>the</b> <b>person</b> <b>is</b> already aware of the matter and has been given chances to act on it. In Dow Jones Publishing Co. (Asia) Inc. v. Attorney-General (1989), the appellant was owner of a foreign business newspaper, the Asian Wall Street Journal, circulating in Singapore. After some disagreements with the Monetary Authority of Singapore, the Minister for Communications and Information restricted the newspaper's circulation significantly. The appellant applied for certiorari to quash the Minister's decision. One of the grounds relied upon was that the Minister had not acted fairly as he had failed to give an opportunity to the appellant to explain or otherwise deal with the articles involved. However, Chan Sek Keong J, delivering judgment on behalf of the Court of Appeal, dismissed this argument on the ground that the Minister's failure to give the appellants an opportunity to make representations neither amounted to unfair treatment nor had prejudiced it in any way. This was because the Minister had already issued a warning to the appellant; the appellant had been given many opportunities to publish a letter from the MAS responding to articles published in its newspaper; and, from an earlier case involving Time magazine, the appellant was aware that the circulation of its newspaper might be cut if it declined to publish the MAS's letter.|$|E

500|$|For cancers {{involving}} {{the head of}} the pancreas, the Whipple procedure is the most commonly attempted curative surgical treatment. This is a major operation which involves removing the pancreatic head and the curve of the duodenum together ("pancreato-duodenectomy"), making a bypass for food from the stomach to the jejunum ("gastro-jejunostomy") and attaching a loop of jejunum to the cystic duct to drain bile ("cholecysto-jejunostomy"). It can be performed only <b>if</b> <b>the</b> <b>person</b> <b>is</b> likely to survive major surgery and if the cancer is localized without invading local structures or metastasizing. It can, therefore, be performed only in a minority of cases. [...] Cancers of the tail of the pancreas can be resected using a procedure known as a distal pancreatectomy, which often also entails removal of the spleen. Nowadays, this can often be done using minimally invasive surgery.|$|E
