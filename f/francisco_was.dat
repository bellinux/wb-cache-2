5|$|In 1984, the NHC was {{separated}} from the Miami Weather Service Forecast Office, which meant the meteorologist in charge at Miami {{was no longer in}} a position above the hurricane center director.

In 1992, Hurricane Andrew blew the WSR-57 weather radar and the anemometer off the roof of NHC's/the Miami State Weather Forecast offices. The radar was replaced with a WSR-88D NEXRAD system in April 1993 installed near Metro Zoo, near where Hurricane Andrew made landfall.|$|E

5|$|Before the Dumbarton and San Mateo-Hayward Bridges {{were built}} across the San Francisco Bay in the 1920s, San <b>Francisco</b> <b>was</b> bottled {{up at the}} north end of a long peninsula, with driving south on El Camino Real towards San Jose as the only {{reasonable}} alternative to the ferries for crossing the bay. The first of several highways built as an alternate to El Camino Real was the Skyline Boulevard, which was added to the state highway system in 1919. A second route, the Bay Shore Highway (Route 68), became a state highway in 1923, but only from the San Francisco city limits into San Mateo County, where the Dumbarton Bridge would begin. Just prior to the start of construction on the Dumbarton Bridge, San Francisco Supervisor Richard J. Welch noted that the Bay Shore Highway would need to be built all the way to San Jose as an escape valve for the additional traffic that the bridge would attract.|$|E

5|$|By 1940, at {{the dawn}} of the freeway era, the state was making plans to convert the Bayshore Highway into a ten-lane Bayshore Freeway between San Francisco and Palo Alto. The first piece built was from Peninsula Avenue at the San Mateo-Burlingame line to South San Francisco. This six-lane freeway, {{completed}} in 1949, followed the existing highway to Broadway in Burlingame, but then took a more inland alignment past the San Francisco International Airport, and crossed the old road at South San Francisco, running just east of it to near the south end of the cut at Sierra Point. Construction began inside San Francisco in 1950 and was completed in 1958; the new causeway across Candlestick Cove, connecting the completed section in South San Francisco with San <b>Francisco,</b> <b>was</b> dedicated in mid-1957. In 1951, the state legislature renamed the portion within San Francisco after James Lick, a California pioneer and philanthropist.|$|E
5|$|In {{response}} to pleas from Travis, James Fannin started from Goliad with 320 men, supplies and armaments, yet had to abort {{a day later}} due to a wagon breakdown. Final reinforcements were able to enter the Alamo during March 1–4, most of them from Gonzales which had become a recruitment camp. Others who had left intending to return were unable to re-enter. At 5:30a.m. on March 6, the Mexican army began the final siege. An hour later, all combatants inside the Alamo were dead. The bodies, {{with the exception of}} Gregorio Esparza's, were cremated on pyres and abandoned. Esparza's brother <b>Francisco</b> <b>was</b> a soldier in the Mexican army and received permission from Santa Anna for a Christian burial.|$|E
5|$|Odwalla was {{incorporated}} in September 1985 {{after five years}} of growth and expanded to sell products in San Francisco in 1988.

By 1992, the company employed 80 people at its company headquarters in Davenport, California, and sold around 20 different flavors of juice for between $1.50 and $2.00 a pint. Odwalla went public in December 1993 (NASDAQ:ODWA); the company had 35 delivery trucks, almost 200 employees, and made about $13million a year.

5|$|The German Chancellor Theobald von Bethmann-Hollweg {{authorised}} German activity against British India as World War I {{broke out}} in September 1914. Germany decided to actively support the Ghadarite plans. Using the links established between Indian and Irish residents in Germany (including Irish nationalist and poet Roger Casement) and the German Foreign Office, Oppenheim tapped into the Indo-Irish network in the United States. Har Dayal had helped organise the Ghadar party before his arrest in the United States in 1914. He however jumped bail {{and made his way}} to Switzerland, leaving the party and publications in the charge of Ram Chandra Bharadwaj, who became the Ghadar president in 1914. The German consulate in San <b>Francisco</b> <b>was</b> tasked to make contact with Ghadar leaders in California. A naval lieutenant by the name of Wilhelm von Brincken {{with the help of the}} Indian nationalist journalist Tarak Nath Das and an intermediary by the name of Charles Lattendorf established links with Bharadwaj. Meanwhile, in Switzerland the Berlin committee was able to convince Har Dayal that organising a revolution in India was feasible.|$|E
5|$|Upon {{independence}} from Spain in 1821, the area {{became part of}} Mexico. Under Mexican rule, the mission system gradually ended, and its lands became privatized. In 1835, Englishman William Richardson erected the first independent homestead, near a boat anchorage around what is today Portsmouth Square. Together with Alcalde Francisco de Haro, he laid out a street plan for the expanded settlement, and the town, named Yerba Buena, began to attract American settlers. Commodore John D. Sloat claimed California for the United States on July 7, 1846, during the Mexican–American War, and Captain John B. Montgomery arrived to claim Yerba Buena two days later. Yerba Buena was renamed San Francisco on January 30 of the next year, and Mexico officially ceded the territory to the United States {{at the end of}} the war. Despite its attractive location as a port and naval base, San <b>Francisco</b> <b>was</b> still a small settlement with inhospitable geography.|$|E
5|$|After {{maintaining}} its peak intensity for about 36hours, Francisco began weakening, after the eye lost definition due to building wind shear. By October21, the eye became ragged and cloud-filled while the overall satellite {{presentation of the}} storm became elongated. That day, the typhoon entered the area of responsibility of the Philippine Atmospheric, Geophysical and Astronomical Services Administration (PAGASA), which gave Francisco the local name Urduja; the agency would cease issuing advisories on October23. Conditions generally remained favorable, allowing the eye to remain distinct despite a great reduction in the sustained winds. Dry air began affecting the tropical cyclone late on October22, cutting off the flow of moist air, and water temperatures cooled along the storm's track. As a result, the eye dissipated and the convection weakened. An approaching trough from the Korean peninsula weakened the ridge to the north, slowing the typhoon and allowing it to turn north and northeast on October24. Francisco weakened below typhoon status after passing 210km (130mi) southeast of Okinawa. The storm began interacting with the approaching cold front while it passed south of Japan, moving around the subtropical ridge. With increasing wind shear, the circulation became exposed from the convection, and the JTWC discontinued advisories on October25, declaring that <b>Francisco</b> <b>was</b> becoming extratropical. On the next day, Francisco completed its extratropical transition, but dissipated later on October26, to the southeast of Japan.|$|E
