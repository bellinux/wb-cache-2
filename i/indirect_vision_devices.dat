After introducing the ergonomic theory of driving fatigue and the development of driving fatigue detection at home and abroad, mainly use EEG to judge the driving fatigue level of <b>indirect</b> <b>vision</b> driving. The experiment results show that greater fatigue is brought to the driver on the condition of <b>indirect</b> <b>vision</b> driving compared with the direct vision driving...|$|R
40|$|Of {{interest}} to designers of future combat vehicles {{is the effect}} of <b>indirect</b> <b>vision</b> upon vehicle driving, and in particular the effect of the camera lens field of view (FOV). In a field study, driving performance was measured for natural and <b>indirect</b> <b>vision</b> with eight participants negotiating a road course in a military vehicle. The <b>indirect</b> <b>vision</b> system was driven with fixed panoramic flat panel, liquid crystal displays in the cab and a forward viewing monocular camera array mounted on the front roof of the vehicle and tilted slightly downward. The results are that the participants successfully drove the vehicle with <b>indirect</b> <b>vision</b> for the different FOVs of the cameras: near unity, wide, and extended. However, they drove the course faster with natural vision than they did with the <b>indirect</b> <b>vision</b> systems. Further, the course speed significantly decreased with increased camera FOV. Workload ratings show a significant increase in perceived workload with increased FOV. Most participants reported a discomfort associated with motion sickness while they were in the moving vehicle with the displays. Finally, cluster analysis of the mental workload measures supports a skills-rules-knowledge model of information processing for the driving task...|$|R
40|$|<b>Indirect</b> <b>vision</b> {{systems are}} used by drivers to {{identify}} objects that do not fall directly within their line of sight. This can be accomplished {{through the use of}} a conventional mirror-based <b>indirect</b> <b>vision</b> system or by a camera-based <b>indirect</b> <b>vision</b> system. The purpose of this study is to evaluate the design factors surrounding the use of camera-based <b>indirect</b> <b>vision</b> systems, quantify the possible fuel savings which may be achieved through the use of such systems and to identify and quantify any secondary effects related to their use. The design factors were separated into human design considerations and equipment design considerations. The two categories of design factors were evaluated through a literature review of past similar studies as well as other pertinent journal articles and texts. The possible fuel savings which may be realized {{through the use of a}} camera-based <b>indirect</b> <b>vision</b> system were quantified by performing full-scale component testing in a 2 m by 3 m wind tunnel. The results of the component testing were compared to previously performed full-scale vehicle testing in order to determine the overall reduction in the vehicle drag coefficient expected through the use of a camera-based <b>indirect</b> <b>vision</b> system and, in turn, the possible fuel savings.

40|$|Abstract: The current paper {{defines a}} new {{mathematical}} model of night <b>vision</b> <b>devices</b> choice {{taking into account}} the external surveillance conditions. The night <b>vision</b> <b>device</b> working range is an important NVD parameter influenced by the external surveillance conditions. The developed mathematical model is used to formulate multicriteria combinatorial optimization tasks which solutions provide night <b>vision</b> <b>devices</b> choice based on preliminary theoretical estimation of the device working range under expected external surveillance conditions. Additional user requirement about the preferred working range value is used as restriction in optimization tasks. The practical applicability of the proposed night <b>vision</b> <b>devices</b> choice approach is proved by numerical examples based on real night vision goggles and external surveillance conditions data. The multicriteria combinatorial mixed integer optimization tasks are solved by weighted sum method using the software system LINGO v. 11. The proposed approach for night vision goggles choice considering external surveillance conditions can be applied for other types of night <b>vision</b> <b>devices</b> choice {{taking into account the}}ir specifics...|$|R

Full scale aerodynamic testing was performed in a 2 m by 3 m wind tunnel on a system component basis to quantify the possible fuel savings associated with the removal of the side mirrors. The mirrors on a Volvo VN 780 tractor were removed and replaced with a prototype camera-based <b>indirect</b> <b>vision</b> system consisting of four cameras mounted in the front fender location; two cameras {{on either side of the}} vehicle. Four monitors mounted in the vehicle - two mounted on the right A-pillar and two mounted on the left A-pillar - provided <b>indirect</b> <b>vision</b> information to the vehicle operator. Four commercial drivers were asked to perform a series of tests simulating typical driving scenarios on a closed course test track. The tests included an object identification test, a blind spot comparison test, a coupling and uncoupling test, a quasi-static lane change test, a dynamic lane change test and an evasive manoeuvres test. The tests were performed both with the mirrors and with the camera-based <b>indirect</b> <b>vision</b> system. The results of the study provide an analysis of driver performance while using the mirrors in comparison to driver performance while using the camera-based <b>indirect</b> <b>vision</b> system. Driver acceptance of the camera-based <b>indirect</b> <b>vision</b> system was also analyzed through the use of questionnaires. Peer reviewed: YesNRC publication: Ye...|$|R

50|$|For {{operations}} during night time, {{the observation}} devices could be disconnected {{and replaced by}} an active infrared night <b>vision</b> <b>device</b> of the TKN-1 type or similar. The infra-red searchlight attached to the commander's dome had to be coupled to the night <b>vision</b> <b>device</b> with bolts and electric wires leading inside the tank. For {{this one of the}} four vision blocks had to be removed, creating a gap to pull the wires through. However, the infra-red floodlight could effectively illuminate only at distances up to 400 meters with a x2.75 magnification. Though the much larger gunner's infra-red floodlight helped to see effectively up to 800 meters, but only at the frontal arch of the turret. Such early night <b>vision</b> <b>devices</b> had many drawbacks, and the TKN-1 was no exception. The bright infra-red floodlights could be easily spotted by modern passive infra-red night <b>vision</b> <b>devices</b> and thermal sights at ranges exceeding the visibility of the active infra-red devices like the TKN-1. Moreover, the eyepieces of the TKN-1 lay very close to the body of the TPKU-2B what made the commander's rubber frontal headrest an obstacle, without which keeping the eyes on the eyepieces during movement of the vehicle very difficult.|$|R
