40|$|Modern {{eating habits}} depend {{in large part}} on the {{development}} of food processing technology. Thermal treatments are often performed in the conventional food processing, but it can cause discoloration and loss of nutrients of the food by thermal processing or treatment. On the other hand, food processing using an underwater shock wave has little influence of heat and its processing time is very short, preventing the loss of nutrients. In this research optical observation experiment and the numerical simulation were performed, in order to understand and control the behavior of the underwater shock wave {{in the development of the}} processing container using an underwater shock wave for the factory and home. In this experiment a rectangular container was used to observe the behavior of the underwater shock wave. In the experiment, the shock wave was generated by using explosive on the shock wave generation side. The shock wave, which passed through the phosphor bronze and propagated from the <b>aluminum</b> <b>sidewall,</b> was observed on the processing container side.

A true triaxial apparatus {{was designed and}} fabricated to apply mechanical loading to achieve multi-axial stress states. The University of Minnesota plane strain apparatus was equipped with piston assemblies that generated intermediate principal stress σ_II up to 100 MPa. The minor principal stress σ_III was limited by the pressure vessel to 24 MPa and the major principal stress σ_I was applied by a closed-loop, servo-hydraulic load frame. Calibration tests were conducted on an isotropic, linear <b>elastic</b> material (<b>aluminum</b> 6061) to confirm {{the performance of the}} piston assemblies. Results from strength testing of Dunnville sandstone under multi-axial stress states were used to evaluate the Mohr-Coulomb (MC), Hoek-Brown (HB), and Paul-Mohr-Coulomb (PMC) failure criteria. A series of conventional triaxial compression (σ_II=σ_III) and extension (σ_I=σ_II) experiments were performed to evaluate the necessary material parameters for each failure criterion. The true triaxial apparatus was used to conduct experiments under various states of stress (σ_I≠σ_II≠σ_III) at constant mean stress (p=(σ_I+σ_II+σ_III) / 3) of 28. 3 and 56. 0 MPa. The three criteria were compared in principal stress space on a plane normal to the hydrostatic axis called the pi-plane. Even though MC and HB are independent of σ_II, the stress states at failure were reasonably predicted at p = 28. 3 MPa. This was not the case at p = 56. 0 MPa, and a plane fitting method using a failure criterion such as PMC that includes σ_II may be needed...|$|R

40|$|The {{development}} of digital computers {{capable of making}} the requisite numerical cal-culations {{and the availability of}} accurate experimental low-temperature specific heats have led to a revival of interest in the Born-von Karman theory of lattice dynamics. The vibrational frequency spectrum and the bulk thermodynamic properties of several metals crystallizing in the face-centered cubic system were recently computed by a Born-von Karman calculation (1, 2) using interatomic force constants derived from the adiabatic elastic constants of a metal single crystal. Since the specific heat at low tem-peratures is most sensitive to the parameters of the lattice model employed, calculations using the elastic constants at liquid helium temperatures are of the greatest interest.

The reinforcing effect obtained is determined by the stiffness of the unidirectional CFRP laminate which has twice the <b>elastic</b> modulus of <b>aluminum.</b> One can therefore easily follow that an unstressed CFRP laminate reinforcement of welded beams made of steel will not lead to a substantial increase in fatigue strength of the steel structure.

40|$|Non-contact {{measurement}} of elastic modulus {{is necessary for}} the in-line assessment of material in harsh environments such as high temperature. In this paper, a fully non-contact method to measure elastic modulus is proposed based on the laser ultrasonic technique (LUT) that uses a short-pulsed laser to generate ultrasound and the other laser coupled to an interferometer using a photorefractive crystal to detect the ultrasonic wave displacement. Basically, this method measures velocities of shear wave and longitudinal wave to obtain the elastic modulus. The uniqueness is that the velocity of shear wave is measured in the thermo-elastic regime first and then the velocity of longitudinal wave is measured in the ablation regime. This is because the strong mode of generated ultrasound is the shear wave in the thermo-elastic regime while the longitudinal wave in the ablation regime. Regime change can be achieved simply by switching the laser power, with no change in the measurement setup. In order to demonstrate the usefulness of the proposed method, the <b>elastic</b> modulus of <b>aluminum</b> casting alloy has been measured and the results were compared with a conventional contact method and a destructive tensile test.

40|$|Sensing devices {{developed}} upon resonant microelectromechanical and nanoelectromechanical (M/NEMS) system {{technology have}} {{become one of}} the most attractive areas of research over the past decade. These devices make exceptional sensing platforms because of their miniscule dimensions and resonant modes of operation, which are found to be extremely sensitive to added mass. Along their unique sensing attributes, they also offer foundry compatible microfabrication processes, low DC power consumption, and CMOS integration compatibility. In this work, electrostatically and piezoelectrically actuated RF MEMS bulk resonators have been investigated for mass sensing applications. The capacitively-transduced resonators employed electrostatic actuation to achieve desired resonance mode shapes. These devices were fabricated on silicon-on-insulator (SOI) substrates with a device layer resistivity ranging from 0. 005 Ω cm to 0. 020 Ω cm. The electrode-to-resonator capacitive gap was defined by two different techniques: oxidation enabled gap reduction and sacrificial atomic layer deposition (ALD). For oxidation enabled gap reduction, a hard mask composed of silicon nitride and polysilicon is deposited, patterned, and defined using standard MEMS thin-film layer deposition and fabrication techniques. The initial lithographically-defined capacitive gap of 1 μm is further reduced to ~ 300 nm by a wet furnace oxidation process. Subsequently, the reduced gap is transferred to the device layer using a customized dry high-aspect-ratio dry etching technique. For sacrificial approach, a ~ 100 nm-thin ALD <b>aluminum</b> oxide <b>sidewall</b> spacer is chemically etched away as the last microfabrication step to define the ~ 100 nm capacitive gap. Small capacitive gaps developed in this work results in small motional resistance (Rm) values, which relax the need of the read-out circuitry by enhancing the signal transduction. Piezoelectrically-actuated resonators were developed using thin-film bulk acoustic resonant (FBAR or TFBAR) and thin-film piezoelectric-on-substrate (TPoS) technologies with reported Q factors and resonant frequencies as high as 10, 638 and 776. 54 MHz, respectively, along with measured motional resistance values as low as 169 Ω. To the best of our knowledge, this work is the first one that demonstrated TPoS resonators using LPCVD polysilicon as an alternative low loss structural layer to single-crystal silicon with Q factors as high as ~ 3, 000 (in air) and measured motional resistance values as low as 6 kΩ with an equivalent acoustic velocity of 6, 912 m s- 1 for a 7 μm thick layer. Polysilicon based TPoS single devices were measured with the coefficient of resonant frequency of - 3. 77 ppm/°C, which was the lowest ever reported for this type of devices. Also a novel releasing process, thin-piezo on single crystal reactive etched (TPoSCRE), allows us to develop of TPoS resonators without the need to SOI wafers. The fabricated devices using this technique were reported with Q factor exceeding ~ 1, 000 and measured motional resistance values as low as 9 kΩ. The sensitivity of a fourth-order contour mode ZnO-on-SOI disk resonator based mass sensor was determined by performing multiple depositions of platinum micro-pallets using a focus ion beam (FIB) equipped with gas injection system on strategically-chosen locations. It was found out that the sensitivity of the resonator on its maximal and minimal displacement points was of 1. 17 Hz fg- 1 and 0. 334 Hz fg- 1, respectively. Also, the estimated limit of detection of the resonator was found to be a record breaking 367 ag (1 ag = 10 - 18 g) compared to devices with similar modes of resonance. Lastly, a lateral-extensional resonator was used to measure the weight of HKUST- 1 MOF crystal cluster. The weight of it was found to be 24. 75 pg and 31. 19 pg by operating two lateral resonant modes, respectively...|$|R
40|$|The present work {{deals with}} the texture, {{dislocation}} and lattice strain evolution under uniaxial tension. The in situ experiments were carried out using high-energy X-ray diffraction and a 20 kN universal tensile machine. The anisotropic mechanical behavior is revealed through the reflex-dependent lattice strain evolution of flat samples under uniaxial tension. The as-received material is a 29. 5 mm thick aluminum block with strong texture gradient along the block thickness. In the first experiment, two tensile samples from 7. 5 mm below the surface were prepared along the RD (rolling direction). The two samples have the deformation texture (copper type) with sharpness of 10 mrd (multiples of random distribution). One sample is used to study the texture evolution and the other sample is {{used to determine the}} lattice strain evolution and dislocation evolution during uniaxial tension. During the tensile test, the texture changes slightly due to the low amount of deformation from initial state to sample fracture. In contrast, significant changes in reflex-dependent lattice strains are observed. In the elastic region, the { 111 } lattice planes are the stiffest, as in theory, but the { 200 } lattice planes are not the most compliant ones due to the interaction with neighboring grains having other orientations. Moreover, the Young’s modulus of { 311 } lattice planes is less affected by the texture of 10 mrd. The work hardening during plastic deformation shows a clear dependence on the grain orientations, as shown by the reflex-dependent lattice strains. The essential difference of work hardening as a function of grain orientation is based on two types of dislocation arrangements, the so called [111] tension stress state and [100] tension stress states. Load release first starts on the { 111 } and { 222 } lattice planes before macroscopic UTS (ultimate tensile strength). After UTS all lattice planes experience load release. The dislocation density evolution indicates that in the elastic region, dislocation density decreases as the tensile stress increases. From YS (yield strength), the increase of dislocation density causes the work hardening. Near UTS region, the dislocation density becomes constant. Further beyond UTS, some grain orientations show further work hardening while other grain orientations show softening. It leads to a slight increase in the dislocation density. In the fracture region, a significant increase of dislocation density is observed. It results from the reversal stress (compressive stress) which is formed outside the necking zone, caused by the return of elastic strain. In a second experiment the anisotropic behavior of AA 7020 -T 6 sample with maximum orientation density of 29. 7 mrd was investigated. For this purpose, three flat samples {{from the center of the}} Al-block were prepared, with the orientations of 0 ° to RD, 45 ° to RD and 90 ° to RD. The uniaxial tensile tests were carried out till UTS, which shows three stress-strain curves with different yield strengths, ultimate tensile strengths and elongations. The in situ experiments were performed in HEMS@PetraIII/DESY. Due to the low <b>elastic</b> anisotropy of <b>aluminum,</b> the yield strengths, which were determined from the reflex-dependent lattice strain evolution, show only small variation. The plastic anisotropy is much stronger, which can be observed from the lattice strain evolution of all the three samples. The tensile test of the 45 ° to RD sample shows lowest values of YS and UTS. The variation of lattice strain shows that differently oriented grains undergo different stresses. This effect is greatest in the 45 ° to RD sample. Overall, the 45 ° to RD sample shows the most specific characteristics, because less (111) and more (200) grain orientations are available...|$|R
