The chosen compounds span much of the observed range of Henry s law constants for volatile compounds (0. 02 to 0. 4) and the measured Darcy velocities represent most of those likely to be encountered in natural settings for unsaturated soils.

These gravity-based solutions to water processing are robust physical separation techniques, which may be advantageous to many other techniques for their simplicity in design and operation. The two techniques can be used in conjunction with each other to obtain high purity water. The components and feed compositions for modeling waste water streams are presented in conjunction with the Aspen property system for traditional stage distillation models and air stripping models. While the individual components for each of the waste streams will vary naturally within certain bounds, an analog model for waste water processing is suggested based on typical concentration ranges for these components. Target purity levels for the for recycled water are determined for each individual component based on NASA s required maximum contaminant levels for potable water Distillation processes are modeled separately and in tandem with air stripping to demonstrate the potential effectiveness and utility of these methods in recycling wastewater on the Moon. Optimum parameters such as reflux ratio, feed stage location, and processing rates are determined with respect to the power consumption of the process. Multistage distillation is evaluated for components in wastewater to determine the minimum number of stages necessary for each of 65 components in humidity condensate and urine wastewater mixed streams.

Sci. Technol. 21 : 202 - 208, 1987). The constant was calculated to be 0. 032 at 25 °C, suggesting that MTBE is more volatile than previously reported. Analysis of unpublished data collected earlier, using the method of Gossett, is consistent with the most recent estimate, giving median estimates of 0. 046 and 0. 032 in two series. The value of H was also determined by consecutive additions of water to a single bottle containing a solution of MTBE. Duplicate bottles gave median values of 0. 030 and 0. 036 at 25 °C. The only published measures of H are 0. 022 at 25 °C and 0. 048 at 30 °C, but neither value lies very close to the regression line determined for the range 25 to 50 °C [each value deviates from the line by the equivalent of ~ 2 °C] (Robbins et al.; Anal. Chem. 65 : 3113 - 3118, 1993). The dispersion of MTBE through course and fine river bottom sands and silty sand was also analyzed. A simulated MTBE spill on the three materials was studied for a seven-day period by sampling of the headspace gas of effluent collected daily after application of measured amounts of water to simulate precipitation.

No MTBE remained in the coarse, freely draining sand after five days; while in the silty sand, a significant portion remained in the soil even after seven days.

40|$|Contamination of {{military}} sites by energetic materials and chemical warfare agents {{is a growing}} problem. To avoid health hazards associated with these compounds, {{it is necessary to}} decontaminate or remediate the contaminated sites. Effective decontamination requires knowledge of environmental fate of contaminants and the appropriate remediation methodologies. While the fate of chemical warfare agents are well studied, the impact of certain energetic materials in the environment is relatively unknown. So the current focus is determining environmental fate of Insensitive Munitions (IM) which are energetic materials that have low shock sensitivity and high thermal stability and developing detection schemes for identifying chemical warfare agents. For energetic materials, the environmental fate can be assessed by determining the partition coefficients, especially the octanol-water partition coefficient and Henry 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>law</b> <b>constant.</b> For chemical warfare agents, the most important criteria for developing sensors is the detection selectivity. Carbon adsorbents are a simple and effective way of increasing the sensor selectivity for the contaminants by concentration or prefiltration through physical adsorption. So it is necessary to study the adsorption behavior of the contaminants in carbon slit pores as a preliminary step to the sensing process. In this work, molecular modeling or simulation is proposed as a theoretical tool to determine thermophysical properties that aid in understanding how certain energetic materials behave in the environment and developing techniques for detecting chemical warfare agents. Molecular modeling is a promising alternative to experiments due to the hazardous nature of these compounds and the long experimental time scales involved in their testing. Molecular models or force fields are developed to predict various thermophysical properties. For energetic materials, atomistic molecular dynamics simulations are used to predict properties such as octanol-water partition coefficiens, Henry 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>law</b> <b>constant</b> and also critical parameters, vapor pressure, boiling point, lattice parameters, crystal density and melting point.

40|$|The {{air-water}} {{mass transfer}} of VOCs during air sparging was investigated using a single-air channel air sparging setup and a 14 cm (51 [over] 2 in) diameter soil column. Three different porous media and 10 VOCs {{were used in}} the study. Air velocities ranged from 0. 2 cm/s to 2. 5 cm/s. Experimental results for the single-air channel setup indicated that volatilization of VOCs during air sparging was a diffusion limited process. VOCs, in a thin layer of saturated porous media next to the air channels (identified as the mass transfer zone, MTZ), were found to deplete rapidly during air sparging resulting in a steep concentration gradient within this zone while the VOC concentrations outside the zone remained fairly constant. The rapid depletion was associated with faster initial volatilization of VOCs at the air-water interface as compared to the diffusive transport of VOCs to the air-water interface. The size of MTZ ranged from 17 to 41 mm or between 70 dp 50 and 215 dp 50 (dp 50 = mean particle size of the porous media) depending on the VOC. A general correlation predicting the size of the MTZ was developed. The size of MTZ was found to be directly proportional to the aqueous diffusivity of the VOC, the mean particle size, and the uniformity coefficient. The size of MTZ was also found to decrease with increasing organic carbon content of the porous media. This effect was larger for VOCs with low solubilities and high partition coefficients;Air-water mass transfer coefficients (KG) for the volatilization of VOCs were estimated by fitting experimental data to a one-dimensional diffusion model. The air-water mass transfer coefficients ranged from 1. 79 x 10 - 3 cm/min to 3. 85 x 10 - 2 cm/min for the VOCs tested.

The resulting differential equation was integrated numerically to predict the effect of initial bubble size and system parameters (carbon dioxide concentration, surface tension at the bubble interface, temperature) on bubble growth. Two situations exist, potentially; the dough could be either supersaturated or subsaturated with carbon dioxide. When the dough is supersaturated, the model predicts a critical bubble size above which bubbles grow indefinitely,while belowthe critical bubble size bubbles reach a limiting size and stop growing. The critical bubble size decreases with increasing carbon dioxide concentration and increases with increasing surface tension. Below saturation, all bubbles reach an upper size limit proportional to their initial size. The final bubble size increases with carbon dioxide concentration and decreases with increasing surface tension. Higher temperatures increase the rate of bubble growth and reduce the critical bubble size for supersaturated doughs, by increasing the value of Henry’ <b>s</b> <b>Law</b> <b>constant.</b> Higher temperatures also increase the final bubble size for subsaturated systems.

The instrument also needed to measure the dissolved air content in situ and in real time during the de-aeration process. The current methods {{used to measure the}} dissolved air content require the fluid to be drawn from the hydraulic system, and additional offline laboratory processing time is involved. During laboratory processing, there is a potential for contamination to occur, especially when subsaturated fluid is to be analyzed.

The device measures the dissolved air content through an in situ, real-time process that requires no additional offline laboratory processing time. The method utilizes an instrument that measures the partial pressure of oxygen in the hydraulic fluid. By using a standardized calculation procedure that relates the oxygen partial pressure to the volume of dissolved air in solution, the dissolved air content is estimated. The technique employs luminescent quenching technology to determine the partial pressure of oxygen in the hydraulic fluid.

HLCs were determined using the volatilization rate (kv) of sparged chemical at 25 °C. Despite the assumption that kv should be constant throughout the stripping duration, results indicated that kv decreased over time according to three separate slope regions. Results of ANCOVA indicate that kv is statistically different in the third slope region, which leads to the conclusion that use of the entire stripping data set would lead to biased HLCs. This decrease in kv may be attributed to desorption from sparger surfaces, which has not been considered widely in the literature. Statistical analysis was possible because of the robustness of the current experimental procedure which included numerous replications (15 total spargers) and extensive data points available to discern key slope changes.

However, the {{partition}} coefficients of Sc and Cr between olivine and liquid are significant 0. 2 - 1. 0. We have measured Cr(3 +) partition coefficients of near unity and have grown olivines with nearly 3 wt. % Sc 2 O 3. Therefore, {{there must be}} a simple means of charge balancing 3 + ions in a crystal structure that was obviously not designed to receive other than 2 + ions on the olivine M sites. The simplest explanation is that two 3 + ions enter the olivine structure by displacing three 2 + ions and creating an M site vacancy. Even this explanation has difficulties. For minor elements in our experiments (~ 1 wt. %) the odds of a minor element 3 + ion finding a second 3 + for charge balance are of the order of 100 : 1 against. Because of the reducing conditions of our experiments, Fe(3 +) will not suffice; and Al(3 +) is not in sufficient quantity in olivine for charge balance. Therefore, Cr or Sc must, in effect, charge balance itself. For true trace elements, the problem is compounded many times. For an ion at the 10 ppm level the chances of finding a second (for example) Sc ion is approx. 10 (exp 5) : 1 against. Of course, any other 3 + ion would suffice but comparisons between percent level doping experiments and trace level partitioning indicate that <b>Henry</b> <b>s</b> <b>law</b> is obeyed. This implies that the same substitution mechanism occurs at both the percent and tens of ppm levels. There are two simple solutions to this problem: (i) The electrical conductivity of olivine is such that charge balance need not be local. This requires substantial domains within the olivine crystal in electrical contact by migration of vacancies or electronic defects. (ii) The 3 + cation brings along its own charge-balancing ion because it existed as a dimer in the silicate liquid. Olivine is not a true insulator but is actually a p-type semiconductor. Even so, electrical communication by this means is unlikely over the tens or hundreds of unit cells that would be required for charge balance to be local. Therefore, we cautiously favor the idea that melt speciation is the means by which 3 + ions enter the olivine structure. Possibly this model might be tested by in situ XAFS measurements or by molecular dynamical calculations...|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{advances}} {{our understanding}} of secondary organic aerosol (SOA) formation from small, water soluble molecules like glyoxal and methyl glyoxal that partition to the aerosol aqueous phase according to Henry 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>law.</b> Their partitioning behavior can be altered {{by the presence of}} inorganic salts, which are abundant in aerosols. If the molecules become more soluble this is called 2 ̆ 2 salting in 2 ̆ 2 and the reverse is 2 ̆ 2 salting out 2 ̆ 2. We present the first measurements of salting constants of glyoxal and methyl glyoxal in the aerosol-relevant salts ammonium sulfate, ammonium nitrate, sodium chloride, and sodium nitrate, as well as additional salts for theory-measurement comparison purposes: tetramethylammonium bromide, tetrabutylammonium bromide, and sodium oxalate. We find that glyoxal 2 ̆ 2 salts in 2 ̆ 2 to all salts tested, while methyl glyoxal 2 ̆ 2 salts out 2 ̆ 2. Explanations for their salting behavior are presented using quantum-mechanical calculations to quantify molecule-ion attractions and proposed literature mechanisms to predict repulsive forces (solution volume decrease upon salt addition, dielectric decrement). We calculate a ΔG of interaction (the enthalpy for replacing a water molecule in the hydration shell of an ion with an organic molecule) for isoprene epoxydiol (IEPOX) and its ring-opening product methyl tetrol with sulfate, and given the structural similarities of IEPOX and methyl tetrol with methyl glyoxal, we find that the values are similar to the value for methyl glyoxal. Therefore we predict that trans-Β-IEPOX and its methyl tetrol likely salt out with a salting constant similar to methyl glyoxal. Partitioning also influences reactivity. In a series of simulation chamber experiments we have studied the effect of NH 3 on the rate of gly-SOA formation and find that in the presence of added NH 3 we observe a significant enhancement in total SOA mass formed from glyoxal, especially in the formation of nitrogen-containing products (imidazoles) and the overall aerosol N/C. We present the results of simulation chamber experiments that focus on the chemical composition of gly-SOA. We are able to identify a number of imidazoles resulting from the reaction of glyoxal + NH 4 +. We also use time-resolved data to propose a mechanism for their formation. By comparing imidazole formation under a variety of different chamber conditions we are able to determine under what conditions they will contribute most strongly to brown carbon formation. We have further used a box model to simulate SOA formation in Mexico City during the MCMA- 2003 campaign using an explicit aqueous-phase mechanism for glyoxal processing (gly-SOA). This gly-SOA was compared to SOA from semi/intermediate volatility gases (S/I VOC) using a near explicit gas-phase oxidation mechanism, and two different volatility basis sets to characterize their partitioning. We also have applied our measured salting constants to predict SOA formation over the continental United States using the Community Multi-scale Air Quality Model (CMAQ). Significant SOA forms from the further reactions of these precursors in the aerosol, but the effect of salt is most important. The small Henry 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>law</b> <b>constant</b> for methyl glyoxal combined with the fact that it salts out means that even though methyl glyoxal is far more abundant in the gas phase than glyoxal, methyl glyoxal forms significantly less SOA than glyoxal.
