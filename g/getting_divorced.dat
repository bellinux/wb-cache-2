25|$|According to a 2004 study, Las Vegas {{has one of}} {{the highest}} divorce rates. The city's high divorce rate is not wholly due to Las Vegans {{themselves}} <b>getting</b> <b>divorced.</b> Since divorce is easier in Nevada than most other states, many people come from across the country for the easier process. Similarly, Nevada marriages are notoriously easy to get. Las Vegas {{has one of the}} highest marriage rates of U.S. cities, with many licenses issued to people from outside the area (see Las Vegas weddings).|$|E

After her initial success in late 60's, she married renowned {{director}} Hassan Tariq, of whom she had a daughter Rabia. Due to conflicts Hassan Tariq divorced Rani in the late 70's. She then married to producer Mian Javed Qamar, who divorced her when it was discovered that Rani had cancer. During her treatment in London, she met famous cricketer Sarfaraz Nawaz. Soon they developed a good relationship with each other and got married. Rani helped Sarfraz in his election campaign in late 80's. But their relationship also did not last long and they parted. After <b>getting</b> <b>divorced</b> for the third time, Rani was struck by the grief of loneliness. Cancer also struck back and this time with much more intensity as Rani did not have much desire to live but to see her daughter married.|$|E

500|$|... "A Milhouse Divided" [...] is {{the only}} episode for which Steve Tompkins has sole writing credit, {{although}} {{he had been a}} part of the writing staff for several years. The writers wanted to do an episode that involved a couple <b>getting</b> <b>divorced.</b> They had wanted to break the sitcom convention that characters who look like they will divorce get back together and have two characters remain divorced even after the episode. The Van Houtens were chosen because the writers felt that they were the most developed couple next to Marge and Homer and the Lovejoys. The scene in the episode [...] "Sideshow Bob's Last Gleaming" [...] where Milhouse is in a jet pretending to fire missiles at his parents is where they got the idea to have his parents' marriage be in trouble.|$|E
500|$|In a 1979 {{interview}} with Rolling Stone, Harrison cited [...] "Simply Shady" [...] {{as the song}} that best summed up a fallow period in his personal life that ended when he found lasting happiness with Arias. Arias has commented on the surprising background to the song, saying, [...] "He's in India, a very spiritual place, writing about a very material experience", adding that a tape has been discovered of Harrison working on the composition while at the Lake Palace hotel in Udaipur. She told Mojo of this period in Harrison's career: [...] "Everything in his life had changed at that point: <b>getting</b> <b>divorced,</b> Apple was in turmoil, {{he had his own}} personal demons. '74 was one of those breaking-through-the-sound-barrier periods. You come through and it's just quiet on the other side." ...|$|E

They quit on their marriage and even more tragic, (they) quit on each other. Instead, we had them make a deal with the devil. [...] 'Cause that isn't as bad." [...] Quesada went on to say, [...] "Peter and MJ didn't quit on their love, they sacrificed it to save a life, that to me is a pretty heroic story." ...|$|E

500|$|Leslie and Justin meet Frank, {{a strange}} and {{depressed}} man that has constant panic attacks. Leslie begins to have doubts about bringing him {{to her mother and}} tries to call it off, but Justin insists that they should [...] "let this unfold". At the dance, where Andy's (Chris Pratt) band Mouse Rat is playing, Frank meets up with Marlene, who is repulsed by Frank's past, current unemployment and overall failure at life. She turns down his offer at a second chance at love, prompting him to storm onto the stage and denounce her over the microphone. Leslie apologizes to her mother for bringing Frank. She is later upset with Justin, but has trouble pinpointing the reasons for her dissatisfaction. Ron (Nick Offerman) explains that Justin is a [...] "tourist," [...] meaning that he takes [...] "vacations in people's lives" [...] and only cares about telling interesting stories to impress other people, which makes him selfish. Two older women then recognize Ron as jazz saxophonist Duke Silver, but he denies it. Leslie later breaks up with Justin, which Tom (Aziz Ansari) takes especially hard, reacting as if his parents were <b>getting</b> <b>divorced.</b>|$|E
500|$|As Lennon and Cynthia were <b>getting</b> <b>divorced,</b> {{it became}} clear that Lennon did not wish to keep Kenwood, and Cynthia could not afford to {{maintain}} it on her own, so it was sold in December 1968, for a reputed £40,000, to Bill Martin, writer of songs such as [...] "Puppet on a String" [...] and [...] "Congratulations". Kenwood has subsequently changed hands several times, and been subject to some major renovation work, such that the interior now little resembles the house that Lennon lived in. The exterior and grounds are still recognisable, although the sunroom has been completely rebuilt. After being displayed at the Liverpool International Garden Festival in 1984, the psychedelic eye mosaic was unclaimed, and left in a field. It was rediscovered and restored by Tom Lorimer, a laboratory technician at the Liverpool John Moores University. The mosaic was then displayed at the Museum of Liverpool Life. Items from Lennon's Kenwood period have also appeared for auction, including towels and cutlery, a caviar jar, and the table that sat in the sunroom. Lennon kept the Kenwood house sign after he left, but gave it to Andy Eccles, who was a gardener at Tittenhurst Park, in 1972. It was sold for US$20,400, in 2003. In October 2006, Kenwood went back on the market, with a price of £5.95 million, and was sold in January 2007 for £5.8 million. It has been claimed that every owner after the Lennons has sold it due to divorce.|$|E
500|$|The {{episode was}} written by series creator Matt Groening, the lone episode (discounting the Tracey Ullman shorts) in which he {{received}} an individual writing credit, though he has co-written for the episodes [...] "Some Enchanted Evening", [...] "The Telltale Head", and [...] "22 Short Films About Springfield". [...] "Colonel Homer" [...] was partly based on the 1980 film Coal Miner's Daughter, which {{tells the story of}} country music singer Loretta Lynn. Groening said he had always wanted to write an episode in which Homer is offered a chance at being rich and famous, other than being with his family, but then chooses his family over glamour at the end. He pitched the idea to the writers of the show, who suggested the parody of Coal Miner's Daughter and also that Homer should become a manager for a country singer. Show runner Mike Reiss was originally skeptical about the episode, as he did not think Homer could get a new job when he already had a full-time job at the Springfield Nuclear Power Plant. Reiss eventually gave in, but in future episodes the writers tried to develop the explanation that he got fired from the plant and then rehired at the end. Groening said that during the episode production, he received comments from the production team that Homer was acting like a [...] "jerk" [...] in it, but his explanation was that Homer's behavior was due to his desire to make Lurleen a star and he was oblivious to her attempts to seduce him until the end. Mike Reiss stated that [...] "Whenever we want to write stories about characters <b>getting</b> <b>divorced</b> or actually having an affair, rather than with Homer and Marge, which we could never do, we use secondary characters for that." ...|$|E

2500|$|The highly {{anticipated}} new studio album, The Art of Love, {{was released}} in February 2007, charting within top 20 in German charts and enjoying a minor success internationally. For the first time, Michael Cretu {{did not participate in}} recording the album, as he was reportedly busy with new Enigma recordings, instead letting Jens Gad produce the entire work. Sandra now participated actively in composing and writing the album, therefore lyrics were more personal and reflected struggles in her personal life. [...] "The Way I Am" [...] was the album's lead single, peaking at number 50 in Germany, while the second single, [...] "What Is It About Me", failed to chart.
