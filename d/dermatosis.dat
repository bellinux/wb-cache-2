5|$|The breed {{is prone}} to skin disorders. About a quarter of Westies {{surveyed}} are affected by atopic dermatitis, a heritable chronic allergic skin condition. A higher proportion of males are affected compared to females. An uncommon but severe breed-specific skin condition, hyperplastic <b>dermatosis,</b> may affect West Highland White Terriers, both juveniles and adults dogs. Affected dogs can suffer from red hyperpigmentation, lichenification, and hair loss. In the initial stages, this condition can be misdiagnosed as allergies or less serious forms of dermatitis.|$|E

500|$|Several breed-specific and nonspecific {{health issues}} {{appear in the}} breed, {{including}} a condition in young dogs nicknamed [...] "westie jaw" [...] which causes an overgrowth of bone in the jaw of the dog. It can also be prone to skin disorders, with a breed-specific condition called hyperplastic <b>dermatosis</b> occurring. They are very energetic and need plenty of exercise. Cousin to the Cairn Terrier, the Westie was bred to hunt small rodents at places such as farms.|$|E
