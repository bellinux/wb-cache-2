40|$|In the {{literature}} {{there are several}} conflicting reports dealing {{with the possibility of}} a <b>desensitizing</b> <b>treatment</b> in food allergy. In this paper we describe the methods and the results we obtained with an oral <b>desensitizing</b> <b>treatment</b> using standardized protocols. The treatment was performed in 50 patients with food allergy (55 desensitizing treatments were carried out because some patients were allergic to more than one food). 11 patients did not continue the treatment, while 37 out of 44 successfully completed the program; {{at the end of the}} desensitization all patients who completed the treatment could eat the allergenic food with no side- effects at all. So an oral <b>desensitizing</b> <b>treatment</b> should be taken into consideration in the management of food- allergic people.

40|$|Rabbits {{sensitized}} with {{diphtheria toxoid}} were desensitized by repeated antigen injections. The skin reactions and amounts of serum antibodies were examined {{at regular intervals}} during the poriod of the <b>desensitizing</b> <b>treatment,</b> with the following results. I) No remarkable difference was observed between allergic skin reactions induced with purified,toxoid and those with roughly prepared one. The reactions appeared 3 weeks after {{the beginning of the}} desensitization, reaching the peak in the 4 th week, thereafter weakening gradually, but not disappearing entirely so far as studied. Histologically, allergic lesions in blood-vessel walls and connective tissues were demonstrated without any signs of necrosis, and the grade of the lesions observed histologically was parallel to the grade of their gross appearances. II) Serum antibodies were first detected 3 weeks after the beginning of <b>desensitizing</b> <b>treatment</b> and reached a plateau during the 5 th week, followed afterwards by a slight decrease. III) From the 5 th week after the beginning of the <b>desensitizing</b> <b>treatment,</b> dissocia-tion cf parallelism between intensity of the allergic skin reaction and level of serum antibodies was observed. Namely, the most intensive allergic reaction was observed in the animals showing a definite antibody level in serum, but not observed in the animals showing a higher or a lower antibody level...|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACTBackgroundOvalbumin, ovomucoid, ovotransferrin, lysozyme, and ovomucin {{are known}} to be major allergens found in egg white. Egg white protein is {{composed}} of over 30 proteins; many of which have neither been identified nor their allergenicities characterized. This study set out to analyze whether unknown proteins that bind to IgE antibodies in serum from patients with egg allergy exist in egg white. MethodsDiluted egg white proteins were separated by 2 -dimensional (2 -D) gel electrophoresis. Immunolabeling was performed on individual patient sera from 19 child patients with egg white allergy and 11 negative control subjects. Spots of egg white proteins that bound to the patients' IgE were identified by mass spectrometry-based proteomics. ResultsEgg white proteins were separated into 63 spots. Twenty-five of the 63 reacted with egg allergy patients' sera, and 10 of the 25 reactive spots showed IgE-reactivity to controls as well. Specific bindings to the IgE from egg allergy patients were found in 15 spots; one of which was confirmed as ovotransferrin. Among the other 14 protein spots, egg white cystatin and lipocalin-type prostaglandin D synthase (L-PGDS) were newly identified proteins that reacted with IgE in patients with egg allergy. ConclusionsWe demonstrated that L-PGDS and cystatin reacted with serum IgE in patients with egg allergy. Our proteomics-based analysis in egg white gives a comprehensive map of proteins bound with IgE and should assist in enabling more accurate diagnoses and recommendations of <b>desensitizing</b> <b>treatments</b> for individual patients...|$|R
40|$|The {{isometric}} maximal {{responses of}} the guinea-pig ileum to acetylcholine and to histamine (but not those to prostaglandin E 2 and to high K+) exhibited a secondary transient increase in tonus during the tonic component of the contraction. After <b>desensitizing</b> <b>treatment</b> with acetylcholine or histamine, the isometric responses to either agonist showed decreased phasic and enhanced tonic components, whereas both components of the response to prostaglandin E 2 were markedly depressed. During the <b>desensitizing</b> <b>treatment</b> the degree of desensitization went through a maximum that coincided with the occurrence of the secondary tonic increment. In low-Na+ medium, or in ouabain-treated tissues, {{the responses to the}} three agonists were similar to the respective responses in the desensitized state. It is concluded that the non-specific desensitization is due to changes in Na+ translocation and that the increased tonic component of the isometric response is due to a reduced Na+ gradient across the cell membrane and consequent increase in Ca 2 + loading...|$|E
40|$|We {{attempted}} an oral rush desensitization {{with mixed}} cow and sheep {{milk in a}} 6 -year-old boy who had had adverse reactions to cow and goat milks. Skin prick tests and specific immunoglobulin (Ig) E to cow, sheep and goat milks were positive. The double-blind, placebo-controlled food challenge with cow milk was positive too. He underwent a 12 -day sublingual-oral desensitization treatment with mixed cow and sheep milk. Specific IgE and IgG 4 were measured. Open oral challenges with cow milk, sheep milk and sheep cheeses were also performed after the desensitization. At {{the end of the}} <b>desensitizing</b> <b>treatment</b> our patient could tolerate 120 mL of mixed milk. Specific IgE levels did not vary, whereas an increase of specific IgG 4 concentrations was observed. Open oral challenges with cow and sheep milks and sheep cheeses were negative.

40|$|The {{possibility}} of obtaining oral desensitization {{in patients with}} food allergy is still a matter of debate. We decided to evaluate the safety and efficacy of standardized protocols for oral desensitization with the most common food allergens. Forty-two children (ages up to 16 years) diagnosed as affected by food allergy (on the basis of clinical history, skin prick tests, measurement of specific IgE, and double-blind, placebo-controlled food challenge) underwent a sublingual-oral <b>desensitizing</b> <b>treatment</b> according to new standardized protocols. The control group consisted of 10 patients who followed an elimination diet. The treatment was successfully completed by 85. 7 % of the patients. Specific IgE showed a significant decrease, while specific IgG(4) showed a significant increase, in all treated patients. The immunological modifications observed in our patients lead us to hypothesize that oral tolerance may be mediated by the same mechanisms as those involved in traditional desensitizing treatments for respiratory and insect sting allergy...|$|E
40|$|Because of {{widespread}} latex manufacturing {{in the last}} decades, exposure to latex has become ever greater, as has the incidence of latex allergy among the general population {{as well as the}} high-risk groups. Clinical manifestations range from local reactions (edema, itching, erythema, and papulae), rhino-conjunctivitis, asthma, pharyngeal edema, to severe systemic reactions such as anaphylactic shock (from parenteral exposure especially during medical examinations or surgical procedures). Diagnosis is formulated {{on the basis of the}} personal history and an accurate allergological evaluation. Patients usually have a history of food intolerance or adverse reactions during medical or surgical procedures, which are believed to be the result of anesthetics or other drugs. In vivo tests are prick and patch tests and challenge tests. Challenge tests (nasal, conjunctival, bronchial, intravaginal, sublingual, oral, and cutaneous tests) are important for confirming the diagnosis, for evaluating a patient's response to the different kinds of latex exposure, and for verifying the effects of <b>desensitizing</b> <b>treatments</b> on the various organs involved in latex allergy. The most important in vitro test is the specific anti-natural rubber latex IgE assay. The only effective resolution to the latex allergy problem seems to be desensitization. The criteria of effectiveness are the capability to use latex items, to undergo medical examinations (even invasive), and to remain in an environment where latex particles can be inhaled (such as surgical departments), without symptoms. The first attempts were performed by subcutaneous administration of latex, but this protocol seems to be delicate to perform because of the side effects. Two different alternative methods (percutaneous and sublingual) were successfully performed and proved to be safer and more effective, even though further studies on a larger group of patients are needed...|$|R

Various treatment methods have been proposed but no universally accepted <b>desensitizing</b> agent or <b>treatment</b> has been identified. When a patient has symptoms that {{can be attributed to}} dentin hypersensitivity, a thorough clinical examination should be carried out to rule out other likely causes prior to diagnosis and treatment.

40|$|The Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana) GSTF 8 gene is {{a member}} of the {{glutathione}} S-transferase (GST) family whose expression is induced by defense signals, certain chemical stresses, and some pathogens. Here, we have used transgenic plants and an in vivo imaging system to demonstrate that GSTF 8 expression is subject to a distinct desensitization phenomenon because prior chemical treatment significantly reduces reactivation of the GSTF 8 promoter by hydrogen peroxide, auxin, and salicylic acid. A GSTF 8 null line had similar desensitization properties to wild type, demonstrating that GSTF 8 protein levels are not responsible for desensitization. The resulting refractory period is unusually long lasting, with full recovery taking 4 d. Expression of the GSTF 8 promoter following a second treatment occurred predominantly in newly formed tissue at the root tip, suggesting that desensitization is lost upon cell division. Expression of the endogenous GSTF 8 gene and another GST gene, GSTF 6, is also <b>desensitized</b> following <b>treatment</b> with hydrogen peroxide. The desensitization phenomenon can be activated by a very low concentration of inducer that is not sufficient to activate the GSTF 8 promoter. These results demonstrate that activation of the GSTF 8 promoter is not essential for eliciting desensitization. A key promoter sequence within the GSTF 8 gene, the ocs element, is also affected by desensitization. Treatment with a phosphatase inhibitor prevents desensitization of GSTF 8 expression and ocs element activity, suggesting that dephosphorylation of one or more proteins is required for desensitization to occur...|$|R
40|$|Aim: This {{randomized}}, double blind, split mouth {{study was}} aimed to compare three dentin <b>desensitizing</b> <b>treatment</b> modalities. Methods: Two hundred sixty teeth of 25 patients; each having at least 2 hypersensitive teeth in each quadrant, were included. Teeth were randomized to 4 groups: Group A treated with 2 % NaF solution, Group B received GLUMA®; an aqueous solution of Hydroxy-Ethyl-Methacrylate and Glutarldehyde, (HEMA-G), Group C received iontophoresis with distilled water (placebo) and Group D {{was treated with}} NaF-iontophoresis. Pain response was evaluated on a visual analogue scale (VAS), by using tactile, air blast and cold-water stimuli at 0 -day, 15 -day, 1 -month and 3 -months interval. Results: All treatments were effective in reducing dentinal hypersensitivity significantly, Group D and Group B were more effective than Group A and Group C at all time intervals. Group D and Group B were equally effective in reducing dentinal hypersensitivity at 15 -day and 1 -month interval but Group D was more effective at 3 -months. Conclusion: All treatment modalities were more effective in reducing hypersensitivity than placebo. 2 % NaF-iontophoresis and HEMA-G were more effective than 2 % NaF local application at all time intervals. But at 3 -months, 2 % NaF-iontophoresis was more effective than HEMA-G, while placebo produced no significant effect in reduction of hypersensitivity...|$|E
40|$|Introduction: Current {{theories}} of dentin bonding {{are based on}} the concept of "hybrid layer". However, the histological complexity of dentin, as well as the vulnerability of the hybrid layer, goes against the long-term effect of dentin bonding. At the same time, post-operative sensitivity is more likely to occur after traditional adhesive restoration. The Hypothesis: Compared to dentin bonding, enamel bonding exhibits a more optimal immediate and long-term performance, owing to its higher degree of mineralization, well-arranged enamel crystals and the porous structure after etching. Moreover, "enamel hypersensitivity" is never going to happen {{due to the lack of}} tubules existing in dentin. In light of this phenomenon, we brought up the concept and the proposal method to form an "enamel-like" dentin, simulating enamel structure to achieve satisfying durability of dentin bonding and obtain good performance for preventing post-operative sensitivity. With the application of mesoporous silicon bi-directionally binding to hydroxyapatite of dentin itself and hydroxyapatite nanorods synthetized in vitro, we may be able to form an enamel-like "functional layer" via ion-regulating self-assembly. Evaluation of Hypothesis: This paper explains how to achieve dentin enamel-like modification by chemical methods, especially, details the strategies and possible mechanisms of the hypothesis. Validation of the hypothesis is more likely to eliminate the adverse effect of dentinal fluid, improve long-term performance of dentin bonding, offer strategies for <b>desensitizing</b> <b>treatment</b> and self-repairing carious-affected dentin, and furthermore, provide the possibility to introduce new {{theories of}} dentin bonding...|$|E
40|$|The present paper {{deals with}} {{inhibition}} of the cultivated leukocytes obtained from desensitized rabbits {{by the addition}} of tuberculin. At the same time, tuberculin skin reaction and serum precipitation reaction was also tested at a definite interval after sensitization and desensitization treatment. For the purpose of desensitizing rabbits, animals already inoculated with tubercle bacilli were treated with daily subcutaneous injections of the Sauton-tuberculin in small amounts. At the same time, desen sitization treatment with a intravenous injection of a large amount of the Sauton-tuberculin was carried out in another group of rabbits. The following results were obtained. 1) In the rabbits desensitized by repeated injections of small amount of tuberculin, tuberculin skin reaction became weaker and weaker in its intensity, running parallel with the desensitizing treatments, and after a certain interval it turned completely negative; however, antibody amount in serum gradually increased followed by maintaining practically a constant value. In other words, a dissociation of parallelism between intensity of tuberculin skin reaction and amount of serum antibodies was found. 2) The grade of inhibition of the culture, continued to maintain a constant value throughout the entire course of desensitization. 3) The dissociation phenomenon is considered {{to be the result of}} an excess production of free and sessile antibodies. 4) Tuberculin skin reaction turned negative with <b>desensitizing</b> <b>treatment</b> with a large amount of tuberculin, while the grade of inhibition of the culture was not influenced by this treatment...|$|E

40|$|The {{intrinsic}} protein-tyrosine kinase {{activity of}} the epidermal growth factor (EGF) receptor is required for signal transduction. Increased protein-tyrosine kinase activity is observed following the binding of EGF to the receptor. However, signaling is rapidly <b>desensitized</b> during EGF <b>treatment.</b> We report that EGF receptors isolated from desensitized cells exhibit a lower protein-tyrosine kinase activity than EGF receptors isolated from control cells. The mechanism of desensitization of kinase activity can be accounted for, in part, by the EGF-stimulated phosphorylation of the receptor at Ser 1046 / 7, a substrate for the multifunctional calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II in vitro. Mutation of Ser 1046 / 7 by replacement with Ala residues blocks desensitization of the EGF receptor protein-tyrosine kinase activity. Furthermore, this mutation causes a marked inhibition of the EGF-stimulated endocytosis and down-regulation of cell surface receptors. Thus, the phosphorylation site Ser 1046 / 7 is required for EGF receptor desensitization in EGF-treated cells. This regulatory phosphorylation site {{is located at the}} carboxyl terminus of the EGF receptor within the subdomain that binds src homology 2 regions of signaling molecules...|$|R
40|$|Allergen {{immunotherapy}} (AIT) {{is effective}} in reducing the clinical symptoms associated with allergic rhinitis, asthma and venom-induced anaphylaxis. Subcutaneous (SCIT) and sublingual immunotherapy (SLIT) with unmodified allergen extracts are the most widely prescribed AIT regimens. The efficacy of these 2 routes appears comparable, but the safety profile with SLIT is more favorable allowing for home administration and requiring less patient time. However, both require that the treatment is taken regularly over several years, e. g., monthly in a supervised medical setting with SCIT and daily at home with SLIT. Despite the difference in treatment settings, poor adherence has been reported with both routes. Emerging evidence suggests that AIT may be effective in other allergic conditions such as atopic dermatitis, venom sting-induced large local reactions, and food allergy. Research with oral immunotherapy (OIT) for food allergies suggest that many patients can be <b>desensitized</b> during <b>treatment,</b> but questions remain about whether this can produce long term tolerance. Further {{studies are needed to}} identify appropriate patients and treatment regimens with these conditions. Efforts to develop safer and more effective AIT for inhalant allergies have led to investigations with modified allergens and alternate routes. Intralymphatic (ILIT) has been shown to produce long-lasting clinical benefits after three injections comparable to a 3 -year course of SCIT. Epicutaneous (EPIT) has demonstrated promising results for food and inhalant allergies. Vaccine modifications, such as T cell epitopes or the use of viral-like particles as an adjuvant, have been shown to provide sustained clinical benefits after a relatively short course of treatment compared to the currently available AIT treatments, SLIT and SCIT. These newer approaches may increase the utilization and adherence to AIT because the multi-year treatment requirement of currently available AIT is a likely deterrent for initiating and adhering to treatment...|$|R
40|$|Tooth {{sensitivity}} is a {{very common}} clinical presentation which can cause considerable concern for patients. Dentin hypersensitivity (DH) is characterized by short sharp pain arising from exposed dentin in response to stimuli. The most widely accepted theory of how the pain occurs is Brannstrom′s hydrodynamic theory, fluid movement within the dentinal tubules. The condition generally involves the facial surfaces of teeth near the cervical aspect and is very common in premolars and canines. This condition is frequently encountered by dentists, periodontists, hygienists and dental therapists. Some dental professionals lack confidence in treating DH. The management of this condition requires {{a good understanding of}} the complexity of the problem, as well as the variety of treatments available. This review considers the etiopathogenesis, incidence, diagnosis, prevention and management of dentinal hypersensitivity. DH is diagnosed after elimination of other possible causes of the pain. Any treatment plan for DH should include identifying and eliminating predisposing etiologic factors. Professionals should appreciate the role causative factors play in localizing and initiating hypersensitive lesions. It is important to identify these factors so that prevention can be included in the treatment plan. Treatments can be self-administered by the patient at home or be applied by a dental professional in the dental office. At-home methods tend to be simple and inexpensive and can treat simultaneously generalized DH affecting many teeth <b>Desensitizing</b> <b>treatment</b> should be delivered systematically, beginning with prevention and at-home treatments.

40|$|Background: Dentine {{hypersensitivity}} is {{a transient}} condition that often resolves {{with the natural}} sclerotic obturation of dentinal tubules. A potent topically applied in-office <b>desensitizing</b> <b>treatment</b> is indicated as the choice of treatment when dentine hypersensitivity is localized {{to one or two}} teeth. Aim: The present study aimed to evaluate and compare the clinical efficiency of CPP-ACP F, sodium fluoride, propolis, and distilled water that was used as placebo in treating dentinal hypersensitivity. Materials and Methods: 120 patients aged 20 - 40 years reporting with dentinal hypersensitivity in relation to canine, premolar and molars with erosion, abrasion, and gingival recession were randomly assigned to four groups of 30 patients each. Response to air jet and tactile stimuli were measured using visual analogue scale initially on 1 st, 7 th, 15 th, 28 th, 60 th, and final assessment was done on the 90 th day. Statistical Analysis: A statistical analysis was done using Anova test (Fischer′s test) and Tukey HSD test for multicomparison. Results: The teeth treated with the test group showed decrease in the mean hypersensitivity values compared to control group, over a period of three months. The results showed propolis to be most efficient in treating dentinal hypersensitivity and CPP- ACPF showed to be the least efficient. Conclusion: All test groups were effective in reducing dentinal hypersensitivity, although they differed in rapidity of action over the period of 3 months. Further studies can be done using advanced materials and techniques. Multiple therapeutic modalities have been developed to treat dentinal hypersensitivity including products that impede nerve conduction of pain stimulus, products that mechanically occlude dentinal tubules, and calcium containing products designed to create plugs in the tubules utilizing a demineralization mechanism...|$|E

Apesar da grande diversidade de tratamentos propostos, ainda nÃo existe uma terapia considerada ideal para eliminar essa situaÃÃo desconfortÃvel. Esta dissertaÃÃo, constituÃda por dois artigos cientÃficos, teve por objetivos: (1) revisar criticamente a {{literatura}} disponÃvel sobre os principais aspectos relacionados Ã etiologia e ao tratamento da hiperestesia dentinÃria; (2) avaliar clinicamente a eficiÃncia de agentes anti-hiperestÃsicos no tratamento da hiperestesia dentinÃria. No estudo 1, a literatura cientÃfica pertinente ao assunto foi analisada atravÃs dos resultados de investigaÃÃes clÃnicas e laboratoriais pesquisadas usando a base de dados medline e busca manual de referÃncias citadas em artigos cientÃficos. No estudo 2, um total de 164 dentes, provenientes de 30 pacientes com diagnÃstico de hiperestesia dentinÃria moderada ou severa, foi dividido aleatoriamente em trÃs grupos e avaliado clinicamente de acordo com o tratamento administrado: aplicaÃÃo de laser de arseniato de gÃlio-alumÃnio (AsGaAl), aplicaÃÃo de gel de oxalato de potÃssio a 3 % e aplicaÃÃo de gel placebo. As aplicaÃÃes dos tratamentos foram realizadas em intervalos semanais, durante o perÃodo de quatro semanas consecutivas e o grau de sensibilidade foi mensurado para cada dente atravÃs de uma escala visual analÃgica em resposta aos estÃmulos tÃtil (sonda exploradora) e evaporativo (jato de ar) antes da primeira aplicaÃÃo (baseline), imediatamente apÃs e trÃs meses apÃs a Ãltima aplicaÃÃo dos tratamentos. Os dados foram submetidos Ã anÃlise estatÃstica pelo teste de Kruskal-Wallis (p= 0, 05) e o grau de reduÃÃo da hiperestesia dentinÃria foi avaliado para cada um dos perÃodos observacionais em relaÃÃo ao baseline. A anÃlise crÃtica apresentada no artigo 1 mostrou que a literatura apresenta diversos tipos de tratamento para a hiperestesia dentinÃria, que variam desde procedimentos simples, que podem ser executados pelo prÃprio paciente, atÃ procedimentos complexos, que envolvem a combinaÃÃo de diferentes terapias. Os resultados do artigo 2 demonstraram que a aplicaÃÃo dos tratamentos propostos, inclusive o placebo, proporcionou reduÃÃo estatisticamente significante, imediata e mediata, da sensibilidade em resposta aos estÃmulos tÃtil e evaporativo (p 0, 05). Em conclusÃo, os resultados desses estudos indicam que o conhecimento acerca do mecanismo de ocorrÃncia da hiperestesia dentinÃria e dos agentes anti-hiperestÃsicos disponÃveis Ã indispensÃvel para a elaboraÃÃo de um tratamento eficiente.

Despite {{the large number of}} different proposed kinds of treatment, there is no product or therapy reported in literature that could be considered ideal to eliminate this uncomfortable situation. The aim of this study, comprised by two manuscripts, was: (1) to critically review the literature related to the main evidences about the etiology and the management of dentinal hypersensitivity; (2) to evaluate the clinical performance of different dentine desensitizers in the treatment of dentinal hypersensitivity. In study 1, the scientific literature related to the issue was analyzed through the results of laboratory and clinical investigations searched using medline and manual tracing of references cited scientific papers. In study 2, a total of 164 teeth, from 30 patients with clinical diagnosis of moderate or severe dentinal hypersensitivity, were randomly divided into three groups and clinically evaluated according to the <b>desensitizing</b> <b>treatment</b> under study: gallium-aluminun-arsenide (GaAlAs) laser therapy, 3 % potassium oxalate application and placebo gel application. Treatment sessions were performed at seven-day intervals for four consecutive weeks and the degree of sensitivity in response to tactile (probe) and evaporative (air blast) stimuli was assessed according to a visual analogue scale at baseline, immediately after and three months after the last treatment session. Data scores were submitted to Kruskal-Wallis statistical analysis (p= 0. 05) and were analyzed by dentinal hypersensitivity reduction for each observational moment in relation to baseline. The critical review presented in study 1 showed that the reviewed literature points out several treatment modalities ranging from simple procedures, which can be performed by the patient him/herself, to complex procedures that involve the combination of therapies. The results of study 2 demonstrated that the treatment of dentinal hypersensitivity performed with both active and control groups produced statistically significant reduction of pain in response to evaporative and tactile stimulation immediately after and three months after treatment (p 0. 05). In conclusion, the results of these studies suggest that knowledge about the available desensitizing products and the factors involved in the mechanism of the dentinal hypersensitivity is indispensable in order to perform an effective treatment. Besides, it could be concluded that the three treatments performed in the clinical study were effective for treating dentinal hypersensitivity and that the placebo effect {{plays an important role in}} sensitivity reductio...|$|E
40|$|The {{mechanism}} of ‘down regulation’ of luteinizing hormone receptors {{was investigated in}} pseudopregnant rats using a modified radioimmunoassay capable of measuring endogenous tissue-bound hormone. Treatment of pseudopregnant animals with a <b>desensitizing</b> dose (desensitization <b>treatment)</b> of human chorionic gonadotropin resulted in a decrease in receptor concentration. This decrease was prevented if the animals were treated prior to the desensitization treatment with indomethacin, an inhibitor of prostaglandin biosynthesis, suggesting a role for prostaglandins in down regulation. The desensitization treatment resulted in a time-dependent decrease in subsequent responsiveness of the tissue to luteinizing hormone. Basal progesterone production rate was also decreased following desensitization. Total tissue cholesterol {{was found to be}} decreased following desensitization treatment, without any change in the ratio of free to esterified cholesterol. Mitochondrial cholesterol was significantly reduced and pregnenolone production by the mitochondria of desensitized corpora lutea was also markedly reduced. However, when cholesterol was added to the mitochondria of desensitized corpora lutea, pregnenolone production was increased, reaching values almost equal to that shown by the control mitochondria. These results show that decrease in the responsiveness following desensitization treatment is due to, besides receptor loss, decrease in tissue cholesterol, in particular mitochondrial cholesterol. The cholesterol side chain cleavage activity, although low, appears to be functionally intact; the low activity could be attributed to low levels of mitochondrial cholesterol...|$|R

In this review we focus on oral immunotherapy (OIT), a potential treatment for food allergies. After the introduction, the research method is described. Subsequently, the general principle of OIT is explained. The results describe the main points of each article which are included in this review. The main points are described in the context of efficacy and safety. The description of the main points is followed by a discussion of these points. Of the 274 patients, enrolled in twelve clinical trails included in this review, 181 patients (66 %) full <b>desensitized</b> after <b>treatment.</b> Control groups were included to examine if desensitization and/or tolerance are/is induced by OIT or by natural outgrow. Some studies performed an elimination diet after treatment to examine if the effect of OIT is persistent or transient. The effect of OIT is significant positive straight after treatment compared to the control groups. This effect finished after an elimination diet and this indicates that OIT thus not induce tolerance and that OIT contribute towards desensitization. However, there are some disadvantages. The results are supported only by a limited amount of studies and the general conclusions are debatable because there is much variation between studies in protocols (duration of therapy, dose increase scheme, way to establish allergies) and characteristics of patients enrolled in the trails (mean age, multiple food allergies, severity of allergy). Furthermore, some studies have not included control groups, did not performing an elimination diet after OIT, and did not enrolling a reliable number of patients in there studies. There is needed more knowledge for we can apply this treatment in clinics. In addition, it is difficult to say if OIT therapy is safe enough to apply in clinic. To collect comparable information about the safety of this therapy it is advisable to use a reliable method to establish the severity of side-effects. Furthermore, it is important to examine the effect of OIT on different groups with discrepancies in age, kind of allergy, multiple allergies etc. Thus, more research is needed. ...|$|R
40|$|Dentin {{hypersensitivity}} may {{be defined}} as brief, sharp pain arising from exposed dentin. It occurs typically in response to chemical, thermal, evaporative or osmotic stimuli and cannot be explained as arising from other dental defects or pathology. The primary cause of dentin hypersensitivity is loss of enamel on the tooth crown and gum recession exposing the tooth root, with subsequent loss of cementum. The exact mechanism of dentin hypersensitivity is still being researched, but many accept the hydrodynamic theory as {{an explanation of the}} symptoms. A Hong Kong survey found a prevalence of dentin hypersensitivity greater than 60 % among patients attending a dental hospital; lower incisors were the most commonly affected teeth. Studies have found that many dental clinicians have misconceptions about dentin hypersensitivity and lack the confidence to manage this oral health problem. It is important that Hong Kong dentists know how to diagnose dentin hypersensitivity and provide appropriate treatments and recommendations for patients. Many treatments have been proposed but no universally accepted or highly reliable <b>desensitizing</b> agent or <b>treatment</b> has been identified. When a patient presents with symptoms that may be attributed to dentin hypersensitivity, a thorough clinical examination should be carried out to rule out other likely causes before making a diagnosis and embarking on treatment. Depending on the identified cause, a combination of individual oral health behavior instructions, use of self-care products, and professional treatment may be required to manage the problem...|$|R
40|$|The {{receptor}} alterations {{involved in}} catecholamine-induced desensitization of adenylate cyclase in human neutrophils {{have been investigated}} as has the ability of hydrocortisone to modify such alterations. Incubation of human neutrophils with isoproterenol for 3 h in vitro resulted in an 86 % reduction {{in the ability of}} isoproterenol to stimulate cyclic AMP accumulation in the cells. Two types of receptor alterations were documented. There was a 40 % {{reduction in the number of}} beta adrenergic receptors (42 vs. 25 fmol/mg protein, P < 0. 005) present after desensitization as assessed by [3 H]dihydroalprenolol ([3 H]DHA) binding. In addition the receptors appeared to be relatively uncoupled from adenylate cyclase. This uncoupling was assessed by examining the ability of the agonist isoproterenol to stabilize a high-affinity form of the receptor, detected by computer modelling of competition curves for [3 H]DHA binding. Desensitized receptors were characterized by rightward-shifted agonist competition curves. When hydrocortisone was added to the <b>desensitizing</b> incubations (combined <b>treatment)</b> there was a statistically significant attenuation in the desensitization process as assessed by the ability of isoproterenol to increase cyclic AMP levels in the cells. Although combined treatment did not prevent the decline in receptor number, it did attenuate the uncoupling of the receptors. Combined treatment resulted in competition curves intermediate between the control and the rightward-shifted desensitization curves. Prednisolone was similar to hydrocortisone in attenuating isoproterenol-induced uncoupling. Thus, steroids appeared to attenuate agonist-induced desensitization of the beta adrenergic receptor-adenylate cyclase system by dampening the ability of agonists to uncouple receptors without modifying their ability to promote down-regulation of beta adrenergic receptors...|$|R
40|$|We investigated, in 36 healthy volunteers, {{the effects}} of {{prednisone}} and ketotifen on recovery of lymphocyte beta 2 -adrenoceptor density (determined by (-) - 125 iodocyanopindolol binding) and responsiveness (assessed by lymphocyte cyclic AMP [cAMP] responses to 10 microM (-) -isoprenaline) after desensitization by the beta 2 -agonist terbutaline. Terbutaline (3 X 5 mg/d) decreased lymphocyte beta 2 -adrenoceptor density by approximately 40 - 50 %; concomitantly, lymphocyte cAMP responses to 10 microM (-) -isoprenaline were significantly reduced. After withdrawal of terbutaline beta 2 -adrenoceptor, density and responsiveness gradually increased, reaching predrug levels after 4 d. Prednisone (1 X 100 mg orally) accelerated beta 2 -adrenoceptor recovery; only 8 - 10 h after administration of the steroid beta 2 -adrenoceptor density and cAMP responses to (-) -isoprenaline had reached values {{not significantly different from}} pretreatment levels. Similar effects were obtained with ketotifen (2 mg; thereafter 2 X 1 mg/d for 4 d) : 24 h after application of the drug beta 2 -adrenoceptor density and cAMP responses to (-) -isoprenaline had reached pretreatment levels. Furthermore, ketotifen simultaneously applied with terbutaline completely prevented terbutaline-induced decrease in lymphocyte beta 2 -adrenoceptor density and responsiveness. Prednisone (1 X 100 mg orally) or ketotifen (2 mg; thereafter 2 X 1 mg/d for 2 d) had no significant influence on lymphocyte beta 2 -adrenoceptor density in healthy volunteers not pretreated with terbutaline, but shifted the ratio high-to-low affinity state of the lymphocyte beta 2 -adrenoceptor toward high affinity state. We conclude that glucocorticoids as well as ketotifen can accelerate recovery of density and responsiveness of lymphocyte beta 2 -adrenoceptors <b>desensitized</b> by long-term <b>treatment</b> with beta 2 -agonists. Such an effect may have clinical implications for preventing tachyphylaxis of asthmatic patients against therapy with beta 2 -agonists...|$|R
40|$|Since the {{formulation}} of the monoaminergic hypotheses of depression, several investigations have established that the serotonin (5 -HT) {{as well as the}} noradrenaline (NA) systems are altered by antidepressant treatments. In the last few years, several studies have indicated that interactions between these two systems might also be important in the mechanism of action of antidepressant drugs. We have thus undertaken: (1) to elucidate the nature of some interactions between the 5 -HT and NA systems in the rat hippocampus using in vivo electrophysiology and in vitro superfusion techniques; and (2) to determine whether antidepressant treatments alter these interactions. It was found that NA tonically inhibits 5 -HT neurotransmission via $ alpha sb 2 $-adrenergic heteroreceptors. In addition, the presence of 5 -HT$ sb 3 $ receptors facilitating the release of NA was also documented in this brain region. These receptors were shown to be activated by elevated levels of endogenous 5 -HT, but {{did not appear to be}} activated by basal levels of this neurotransmitter. Long-term administrations of antidepressant drugs commonly known to increase the synaptic concentration of NA, i. e. monoamine oxidase and NA reuptake inhibitors, were found to desensitize the $ alpha sb 2 $-adrenoceptors that inhibit the release of 5 -HT. This effect was also produced by atypical antidepressant drugs that have $ alpha sb 2 $-adrenergic antagonist properties (e. g. mianserin and idazoxan), but not by other antidepressant treatments, (e. g. selective 5 -HT reuptake inhibitors or electroconvulsive shocks). In contrast to $ alpha sb 2 $-adrenergic heteroreceptors, 5 -HT$ sb 3 $ receptors that enhance the release of NA did not become <b>desensitized</b> following long-term <b>treatments</b> with drugs that elevate the synaptic concentration of their endogenous neurotransmitter. Rather, the responsiveness of these 5 -HT$ sb 3 $ receptors became blunted following an antidepressant treatment (desipramine) that caused a large increase in the...|$|R
40|$|This study {{aimed to}} compare the {{effectiveness}} of an 8 % arginine and calcium carbonate in-office desensitizing prophylaxis paste {{with that of a}} home-use toothpaste having the same active ingredients in reducing dentine hypersensitivity. The study was a randomized controlled clinical trial involving 55 subjects who had at least one tooth with sound exposed dentine on the cervical region of the buccal surface displaying hypersensitivity. The subjects were recruited from students and staff, other than those from the Faculty of Dentistry, of The University of Hong Kong. After receiving scaling performed by a dental hygienist at baseline, subjects were randomly assigned to either the in-office <b>desensitizing</b> prophylaxis paste <b>treatment</b> group or the home-use desensitizing toothpaste group. Clinical assessments of dentine hypersensitivity to tactile and to thermal stimuli were performed prior to the treatment at baseline, week 4 and week 12 by a blinded examiner and subjective global assessments of dentine hypersensitivity were recorded. The responses of the subjects to both stimuli were recorded by using a pain score scale from 0 to 10 (from no pain to unbearable pain). Reponses to both tactile and thermal hypersensitivity assessments in the home-use desensitizing toothpaste group showed statistically significant differences between baseline and week 12 (tactile: 2. 4 vs. 0. 9; cold: 5. 8 vs. 3. 5, both p 0. 05) for the in-office desensitizing prophylaxis paste group. There was also a statistically significant difference in the change in thermal assessment scores between the two groups (in-office: - 0. 2 vs. home-use: - 2. 3, p 0. 05). There were no statistically significant differences in global subjective responses to external stimuli in the telephone interviews. Daily use of an 8 % arginine and calcium carbonate toothpaste was able to reduce dentine hypersensitivity over 12 weeks but a single in-office application of prophylaxis paste of similar content was not able to provide instant and long-lasting benefits for subjects with a mild-to-moderate degree of dentine hypersensitivity. published_or_final_versionDentistryMasterMaster of Philosoph...|$|R
40|$|Dopamine {{receptor}}s {{belong to}} the G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) superfamily and are classified into two families: D 1 -like (D 1 R and D 5 R) and D 2 -like (D 2 R, D 3 R and D 4 R), based {{on their ability to}} stimulate or inhibit adenylyl cyclase (AC). Classically, GPCRs (including D 2 R and D 3 R) are desensitized by the activation of the serine/threonine protein kinase C (PKC) upon phorbol- 12 -myristate- 13 -acetate (PMA) treatment. Previous studies demonstrate that while human D 5 R (hD 5 R) is also strongly <b>desensitized</b> upon PMA <b>treatment,</b> the human D 1 R (hD 1 R) undergo a robust PMA-induced sensitization. The aim of this PhD thesis was to explore how the canonical PKC- or phorbol ester-linked pathway can control the responsiveness of two similar GPCRs like hD 1 R and hD 5 R in an opposite fashion. Our data indicate that hD 1 R sensitization and hD 5 R desensitization are not mediated by a direct modulation of AC activity by PKC. Using a chimeric approach, we identified the third intracellular loop (IL 3) as the key structural determinant controlling in an opposite manner the PMA-mediated regulation of hD 1 R and hD 5 R. To delineate the potential PKC phosphorylation sites, a series of mutation of serine (Ser) and threonine (Thr) located into IL 3 of hD 1 R and hD 5 R were used. No hD 1 R mutation decreased the PMA-mediated sensitization. This suggests that hD 1 R phosphorylation is not required for PMA-induced sensitization. In contrast, our results indicate that PMA-mediated hD 5 R desensitization occurs through a hierarchical phosphorylation of Ser 260, Ser 261, Ser 271 and Ser 274. Notably, these hD 5 R mutants exhibited a PMA-induced sensitization, reminiscent of the PMA-induced hD 1 R sensitization. Additionally, using short hairpin RNAs (shRNAs), we showed that PKCε is the potentiating PKC while the desensitizing isoform is δ. Overall, our work suggests {{the presence or absence of}} specific Ser residues on IL 3 of hD 1 -like receptors dictate if phosphorylation-dependent desensitization (through PKCδ) or phosphorylation-independent potentiation (via PKCε) will occur...|$|R
40|$|Originally {{studying}} the molecular mechanisms for the insulin-like effects of growth hormone (GH), lipogenesis and antilipolysis, in isolated rat adipocytes {{we found that}} the GH receptor (GHR) was tyrosine phosphorylated in response to GH in cells that were responsive to these effects. Then, as Janus kinase 2 (JAK 2) was described as a GH-stimulated and GHR-associated tyrosine kinase, we found that JAK 2 was tyrosine phosphorylated in response to GH in responsive cells. These phosphorylations were only marginally observed in response to GH in cells that were refractory to the insulin-like effects. Subsequent to the discovery of phosphatidylinsositol 3 -kinase (PI 3 -kinase) being essential for the insulin stimulated uptake of glucose in adipocytes, PI 3 -kinase-inhibitor wortmannin was shown to inhibit GH-induced lipogenesis and antilipolysis. Tyrosine phosphorylated proteins binding and thereby activating PI 3 -kinase in response to GH were identified as insulin receptor substrate- 1 and - 2 (IRS- 1 and IRS- 2). As was the case for the tyrosine phosphorylation of GHR and JAK 2, these effects dominated in responsive as compared to refractory cells. The activity of PI 3 -kinase was increased in IRS- 1 immunoprecipitates from GH treated cells. In contrast, equally in both responsive and in refractory cells, GH stimulated the tyrosine phosphorylation of a 95 kDa protein (pp 95) which we identified as Signal Transducer and Activator of Transcription 5 (STAT 5), or a protein immunologically related to STAT 5. In addition, while inhibiting both other GH-stimulated cellular tyrosine phosphorylations as well as the insulin-like effects, the tyrosine phosphorylation of STAT 5 was not inhibited by tyrosine kinase- and JAK 2 -inhibitor staurosporine. Nor was the ability of GH to stimulate tyrosine phosphorylation of pp 95 /STAT 5 <b>desensitized</b> by prior <b>treatment</b> with GH as is the case for the tyrosine phosphorylation of GHR, JAK 2, IRS- 1 and IRS- 2 as well as the insulin-like effects. In conclusion, the data presented here suggest a role for JAK 2 activation and thereby tyrosine phosphorylation of GHR, JAK 2, IRS- 1 and IRS- 2 in the insulin-like effects of GH but also that there possibly are actions of GH mediated by kinases other than JAK 2. Alternatively the kinetics of JAK 2 activation are different in refractory as compared to responsive cells and a model supporting this hypothesis is outlined...|$|R
40|$|Exogenous and {{endogenous}} cannabinoids {{have been}} reported to modulate functional activities of macrophages. It is recognized that macrophages express primarily the CB 2 cannabinoid receptor, but recent studies indicate that its expression is differential in relation to activation state with maximal levels occurring when cells are in 2 ̆ 2 responsive 2 ̆ 2 and 2 ̆ 2 primed 2 ̆ 2 states. The functional activities of macrophages when in these states of activation are the most susceptible to the action of cannabinoids, {{at least in terms of}} a functional linkage to the CB 2. To assess the effect of cannabinoid treatment on macrophage chemotaxis and test the hypothesis that cannabinoids inhibit the chemotactic response of macrophages and microglia to endogenous and exogenous, pathogen-derived stimuli, primary murine peritoneal macrophages and neonatal rat microglia were used. Chemotaxis assays and scanning electron microscopy studies demonstrated that cannabinoids inhibit chemotaxis, a signature activity attributed to 2 ̆ 2 responsive 2 ̆ 2 macrophage-like cells, to the endogenous chemokine RANTES (Regulated upon Activation Normal T-cell Expressed and Secreted) and to Acanthamoeba conditioned medium containing secreted proteases. The partial agonist delta- 9 -tetrahydrocannabinol (THC), administered in vitro, inhibited the chemotactic response of peritoneal macrophages to the chemokine RANTES and to Acanthamoeba conditioned medium. In vivo treatment with THC also resulted in inhibition of the in vitro chemotactic response of murine peritoneal macrophages to RANTES and amoebic conditioned medium. Pharmacological studies employing cannabinoid receptor agonists and antagonists demonstrated the involvement of CB 2 in cannabinoid-mediated inhibition of peritoneal macrophage chemotaxis to RANTES and Acanthamoeba conditioned medium, implying that signaling through cannabinoid receptors may <b>desensitize</b> chemokine receptors. <b>Treatment</b> with cannabinoids had no apparent effect on chemokine receptor mRNA levels, but did enhance CCR 5 protein phosphorylation. Macrophage migration to Acanthamoeba conditioned medium may involve activation and signaling through protease activated receptors (PARs), as pathogen-derived proteases have been shown to activate PARs and initiate cellular migration; however, further studies are required to demonstrate PAR activation by amoebic conditioned medium and to assess the effects of cannabinoids on PAR signaling. Acanthamoeba are opportunistic pathogens that cause Granulomatis amoebic encephalitis, an infection of the CNS that is often fatal. THC treatment has been shown to increase mortality to Acanthamoeba infections and is characterized by an absence of granuloma formation. We hypothesize that inhibitory effect of THC on macrophage migration may be a key factor in cannabinoid-mediated immunosuppression. To assess the effect of cannabinoids on microglial migration to Acanthamoeba conditioned medium, chemotaxis assays were performed using primary rat microglia treated with cannabinoids. These studies demonstrated that cannabinoids inhibit microglial chemotaxis to amoebic conditioned medium. Furthermore, the studies demonstrate that cannabinoids, acting through cannabinoid receptors, may cross-talk with a diverse array G-protein coupled receptors so as to modulate responsiveness of macrophage and macrophage-like cells...|$|R
40|$|Psychiatric {{disorders}} {{represent a}} large economic burden in modern societies. However, pharmacological treatments are {{still far from}} optimal. Drugs used {{in the treatment of}} major depressive disorder (MDD) and anxiety disorders (selective serotonin [5 -HT] reuptake inhibitors [SSRIs] and serotonin- noradrenaline reuptake inhibitors [SNRIs]) are pharmacological refinements of first-generation tricyclic drugs, discovered by serendipity, and show low efficacy and slowness of onset. Moreover, antipsychotic drugs are partly effective in positive symptoms of schizophrenia, yet they poorly treat negative symptoms and cognitive deficits. The present article reviews the neurobiological basis of 5 -HT 1 A receptor (5 -HT 1 A-R) function and the role of pre- and postsynaptic 5 -HT 1 A-Rs in the treatment of MDD, anxiety and psychotic disorders. The activation of postsynaptic 5 -HT 1 A-Rs in corticolimbic areas appears beneficial for the therapeutic action of antidepressant drugs. However, presynaptic 5 -HT 1 A-Rs play a detrimental role in MDD, since individuals with high density or function of presynaptic 5 -HT 1 A-Rs are more susceptible to mood disorders and suicide, and respond poorly to antidepressant drugs. Moreover, the indirect activation of presynaptic 5 -HT 1 A-Rs by SSRIs/SNRIs reduces 5 -HT neuron activity and terminal 5 -HT release, thus opposing the elevation of extracellular 5 -HT produced by blockade of the serotonin transporter (SERT) in the forebrain. Chronic antidepressant <b>treatment</b> <b>desensitizes</b> presynaptic 5 -HT 1 A-Rs, thus reducing the effectiveness of the 5 -HT 1 A autoreceptor-mediated negative feedback. The prevention of this process by the non-selective partial agonist pindolol accelerates clinical antidepressant effects. Two new antidepressant drugs, vilazodone (marketed in the USA) and vortioxetine (in development) incorporate partial 5 -HT 1 A-R agonist properties with SERT blockade. Several studies with transgenic mice have also established the respective role of pre- and postsynaptic 5 -HT 1 A-Rs in MDD and anxiety. In agreement with pharmacological studies, presynaptic and postsynaptic 5 -HT 1 A-R activation appears necessary for anxiolytic and antidepressant effects, respectively, yet, neurodevelopmental roles for 5 -HT 1 A-Rs are also involved. Likewise, the use of small interference RNA has enabled the showing of robust antidepressant-like effects in mice after selective knock-down of 5 -HT 1 A autoreceptors. Postsynaptic 5 -HT 1 A-Rs in the prefrontal cortex (PFC) also appear important for the superior clinical effects of clozapine and other second-generation (atypical) antipsychotic drugs in the treatment of schizophrenia and related psychotic disorders. Despite showing a moderate in vitro affinity for 5 -HT 1 A-Rs in binding assays, clozapine displays functional agonist properties at this receptor type in vivo. The stimulation of 5 -HT 1 A-Rs in the PFC leads to the distal activation of the mesocortical pathway and to an increased dopamine release in PFC, an effect likely involved in the clinical actions of clozapine in negative symptoms and cognitive deficits in schizophrenia. The anxiolytic/antidepressant properties of 5 -HT 1 A-R agonists in preclinical tests raised expectations enormously. However, these agents have achieved little clinical success, possibly due to their partial agonist character at postsynaptic 5 -HT 1 A-Rs, together with full agonist properties at presynaptic 5 -HT 1 A autoreceptors, as well as their gastrointestinal side effects. The partial 5 -HT 1 A-R agonists buspirone, gepirone, and tandospirone are marketed as anxiolytic drugs, and buspirone is also used as an augmentation strategy in MDD. The development of new 5 -HT 1 A-R agonists with selectivity for postsynaptic 5 -HT 1 A-Rs may open new perspectives in the field. © 2013 Springer International Publishing Switzerland.

40|$|Serotonin (5 -HT) is a {{ubiquitous}} neurotransmitter in {{the brain}} that is involved in various physiologic functions including the regulation of hypothalamic hormones and has been implicated in various mood disorders such as depression. Preclinical and clinical data from studies in adults have shown that antidepressant drugs produce time-dependent changes in serotonergic and other systems and can also normalize dysfunction associated with the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis. To date, {{our understanding of the}} mechanisms of 5 -HT receptor signaling and the actions of drugs on serotonergic function have been derived from extensive preclinical research carried out using cell lines in vitro or in adult animal models in vivo. Fewer studies have investigated serotonergic signaling mechanisms or the effects of antidepressants (i. e., selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs)) in animal models prior to sexual maturation. This is a scientific and clinically relevant issue as (1) SSRIs, the most effective pharmacological option for treating mood disorders in children and adolescents, are being increasingly prescribed and may be associated with suicidal thoughts or behaviors in these age groups and (2) preclinical studies in rodents indicate that SSRI-induced modulation of the serotonergic system prior to sexual maturation produces effects that are distinct and more long-lasting than those produced in adults. To date, few if any studies have investigated mechanisms of 5 -HT receptor signal transduction in peripubertal hypothalamic neurons in vivo and their regulation by SSRIs, despite a wealth of existing comparative data on serotonin 1 A (5 -HT 1 A) receptor signaling in adult hypothalamic rat paraventricular nucleus (PVN). Given the clinical relevance of potential age-dependent differences in serotonergic signaling and regulation of hypothalamic function, the objective of the studies in this dissertation was to identify and characterize the mechanisms of 5 -HT 1 A receptor signaling in the peripubertal hypothalamic PVN. The data generated by studies in this dissertation project provide the first in vivo evidence that 5 -HT 1 A receptors in the peripubertal PVN can activate multiple responses: (1) oxytocin and adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) plasma hormone responses, (2) activation of extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK), and (3) activation of protein kinase B (Akt). The data also demonstrate that these pathways may be differentially responsive to different classes of 5 -HT 1 A receptor agonists. (+) 8 -OH-DPAT (an aminotetralin), acted as a 2 ̆ 2 full 2 ̆ 2 agonist on each of the respective pathways, while tandospirone (an azapirone) exhibited 2 ̆ 2 partial 2 ̆ 2 agonist activity on activation of Akt but exhibited 2 ̆ 2 full 2 ̆ 2 agonist activity on neuroendocrine responses and activation of ERK. 5 -HT 1 A receptors produce a rapid and prolonged activation of ERK in the peripubertal PVN, unlike the rapid but more transient response in the adult PVN. In addition, the 5 -HT 1 A activation of ERK may be expressed only in certain populations of neuroendocrine cells in the peripubertal PVN. These studies have also revealed some unique aspects that G α proteins in the peripubertal PVN, since: (1) there are age-dependent increases only in Gαo levels, (2) Gαi 3 and Gαo are not reduced by intra-PVN injection with pertussis toxin, and (3) Gαz proteins are not reduced by 7 or 14 days of fluoxetine treatment. We also have determined that chronic fluoxetine <b>treatment</b> <b>desensitizes</b> 5 -HT 1 A receptor-mediated phosphorylation of GSK 3 β in the absence of changes in its canonical upstream kinase, Akt. These data suggest fluoxetine may induce changes in phosphatase activity or {{that there may be a}} different upstream kinase mediating the phosphorylation of GSK 3 β in the peripubertal PVN. In conclusion, the present studies determined the mechanisms of 5 -HT 1 A receptor-mediated signaling in peripubertal PVN and identified some aspects of 5 -HT 1 A receptor signaling that differ from those previously identified in adults. These findings may be clinically relevant with respect to facilitating a better understanding of mechanisms mediating the therapeutic and/or side effects of SSRIs prescribed to young patients or to identify novel drug targets to treat mood disorders in children and adolescents...|$|R
