50|$|Since {{conductive}} EV charging AVCONs {{can be used}} by all EVs {{by using}} an AVCON adapter box that provides a 240V NEMA 14-50 outlet, and inductive EV charging cannot, some RAV4 EV drivers have taken to bringing their SPI TAL <b>inductive</b> <b>charger</b> with them. This allows RAV4 EVs with an inductive charging system to recharge from public, conductive, AVCON EV charging heads. This practice will fade away since virtually all 2011 and later production Electric Vehicles are equipped with a SAE J1772 charge port. Drivers of the few 2011 and later or conversion vehicles are either using SAE J1772 adapters that connect to their chargers or are putting SAE J1772 charge ports in their vehicles.|$|E
40|$|One of {{the most}} {{discussed}} topics in Industrial Ecology is incorporating sustainability into business. One of the key barriers in this process is companies’ fears associated with hindering company activity and increased costs. This master thesis examines the implementation of <b>inductive</b> <b>charging</b> technology for cars, and discovers the competitive advantage gained by using a sustainable system approach in companies. Market {{research has shown that}} PHEV consumers don’t plug-in their cars as often as thought, indicating a problem of convenience. A convenience problem believed to be solved by <b>inductive</b> <b>charging.</b> The interest of OEMs and CEVT lays in the convenience of consumers. The thesis has evolved around a benchmarking of current EVs and PHEVs, {{in order to understand the}} dynamics of the current market as well as an in-depth analysis of <b>inductive</b> <b>charging.</b> Covering the basics of the technology, suppliers and their different variations, and consumer perspective on <b>inductive</b> <b>charging.</b> With the aim of developing a sustainable 1 business plan for CEVT regarding <b>inductive</b> <b>charging</b> in C-segment cars. A sustainable business model for <b>inductive</b> <b>charging</b> is presented as a result, with specific targets depending on market, indicating that <b>inductive</b> <b>charging</b> should be presented as a luxury feature. The overall conclusion is for OEMs to “make room” for the technology solution in order to be compatible with <b>inductive</b> <b>charging,</b> as well as being involved in the standardization work...|$|R

5000|$|The main {{stimulus}} {{for the development}} of SAE J1772 came from the California Air Resources Board. Formerly electric vehicles like the General Motors EV1 had used <b>inductive</b> <b>charger</b> couplers.

The size of sensor nodes and the limitations of battery technologies do not allow inclusion of high energy in a sensor.

This paper provides a novel grid approximation algorithm for efficient and low cost deployment of <b>inductive</b> <b>charger</b> so that the minimum number of chargers along with their placement locations can charge all the sensors of the network. The algorithm proposed in this paper is a generalized one and {{can also be used}} in various applications including the measurement of network security strength by estimating the minimum number of malicious nodes that can destroy the communication of all the sensors.

5000|$|The second {{approach}} {{is known as}} <b>inductive</b> <b>charging.</b> A special 'paddle' is inserted into a slot on the car. The paddle is one winding of a transformer, while the other {{is built into the}} car. When the paddle is inserted it completes a magnetic circuit which provides power to the battery pack. In one <b>inductive</b> <b>charging</b> system, [...] one winding is attached to the underside of the car, and the other stays {{on the floor of the}} garage. The advantage of the inductive {{approach is}} that there is no possibility of electrocution as there are no exposed conductors, although interlocks, special connectors and ground fault detectors can make conductive coupling nearly as safe. <b>Inductive</b> <b>charging</b> can also reduce vehicle weight, by moving more charging componentry offboard. An <b>inductive</b> <b>charging</b> proponent from Toyota contended in 1998, that overall cost differences were minimal, while a conductive charging proponent from Ford contended that conductive charging was more cost efficient.|$|R
40|$|In some applications, {{for example}} {{electric}} vehicle <b>inductive</b> <b>charger</b> using proximity type inductive coupler, the coupling {{quality of the}} transformer could be much lower than an usual isolating/scaling transformer.

40|$|A {{promising}} {{method for}} charging batteries of electric vehicles (EV) is inductive power transfer (IPT), {{also known as}} inductive charging. IPT, a convenient, safe, and aesthetic method of charging EVs, inductively transfers high-frequency AC power in the transmitting pad, or coil, to the receiving pad, or coil. However, the application of IPT entails several practical limitations. For example, misalignment of the coils and varied charging distance (air gap) between the coils change the magnetic coupling effect between the transmitting and receiving coils. As a result, system stability decreases because the electrical characteristics in different charging cycles vary. Previous research has rarely proposed an adaptive and effective method {{to solve the problems}} of varied coupling. Many EV models, however, exist on the market and more will be released in the future. A universal charger suitable for charging various models of EVs will have broad applications, especially in public charging areas. Therefore, we must design a universal <b>inductive</b> <b>charger</b> capable of providing stable charging voltage to various loads, even with influences by varied magnetic coupling. Also important is the design standard of on-board chargers used for universal inductive charging. The design schemes of the universal <b>inductive</b> <b>charger</b> and on-board chargers can be used as references for the future development of the entire EV inductive charging system. Ph. D...|$|E

40|$|One way {{to reduce}} {{pollution}} from the vehicle fleet is to electrify it. Electric vehicles needs to be charged quite often and a conductive charger with a plug has several disadvantages compared to wireless charging. This thesis describes the simulation and development of an <b>inductive</b> <b>charger</b> to a small electric vehicle. The charger can transfer 700 - 950 W at an efficiency of 87 %, and 1100 - 1200 W at an efficiency of 84 %. Measurements shows that the most significant contribution to losses occur in the secondary coil. An efficiency of 90 % is possible if {{the design of the}} secondary coil is improved. To deal with the high leakage inductance of the coils, resonant capacitor banks are placed in series with each coil. The load current is regulated by changing the duty cycle of the inverter. Further work is however needed for implementation of automatic control. Tests has been performed where the two coils are misaligned and when the gap has been increased. Results shows that a misalignment of 100 mm will give a total efficiency of 80 % which is still good. As the system has shown good performance the technology should be viable for charging vehicles but could also be applied in other areas...|$|E

Moreover, in order to assess the impact of the additional demand of <b>inductive</b> <b>charging</b> on the grid operation, an estimation of the 24 -hour power profile of dynamic <b>inductive</b> <b>charging</b> is presented considering, apart from the road traffic, the probability of the need for fast charging, as well as the specifications of the proposed solution.

40|$|The {{introduction}} of battery electric vehicles (BEVs) could help to reduce dependence {{on fossil fuels}} and emissions from transportation and as such increase energy security and foster sustainable use of energy resources. However a major barrier to the {{introduction of}} BEVs is their limited battery capacity and long charging durations. To address these issues of BEVs several solutions are proposed such as battery swapping and fast charging stations. However apart from these stationary modes of charging, recently a new mode of charging has been introduced which is called <b>inductive</b> <b>charging.</b> This allows charging of BEVs as they drive along roads without the need of plugs, using induction. But it is unclear, if and how such technology could be utilized best. In order to investigate the possible impact of the introduction of such <b>inductive</b> <b>charging</b> infrastructure, its potential and its optimal placement, a framework for simulating BEVs using a multi-agent transport simulation was used. This framework was extended by an <b>inductive</b> <b>charging</b> module and initial test runs were performed. In this paper we present the simulation results of these preliminary tests together with analysis which suggests that battery sizes of BEVs could be reduced even if <b>inductive</b> <b>charging</b> technology is implemented only at a small number of high traffic volume links. The paper also demonstrates that our model can effectively support policy and decision making for deploying <b>inductive</b> <b>charging</b> infrastructure...|$|R
