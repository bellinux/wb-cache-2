At the time, Rice {{was best known}} for his 1914 Broadway play On Trial, which featured the first use of flashback, a narrative technique he adapted from film, in a Broadway production. Rice's adaptation of Talbot's work, It <b>Is</b> <b>the</b> <b>Law,</b> again featured a story told in flashback. It ran for 125 performances at the Ritz Theatre, and was a modest success.|$|E

5|$|Curtis Benson {{wrote the}} film {{adaptation}} for It Is the Law; unlike the theatrical version, his screenplay presents the story entirely in chronological order. J. Gordon Edwards directed, {{the only time}} he did so in 1924, as he was primarily serving as Fox Film's director-general at the time. It was also his last time to direct; he retired from Fox after the film's completion, and although he expressed an interest to returning to the role, he died of pneumonia the following year. Filming took place at Fox's New York studio, although most production had by then moved to Hollywood. It <b>Is</b> <b>the</b> <b>Law</b> was one of only four films Fox made at its East Coast facility in 1924. Except for four Allan Dwan films in 1926, they were the last Fox produced in New York. The Film Daily reported that a trailer was produced to advertise the film.|$|E

It {{is a film}} adaptation of the eponymous 1922 Broadway play by Elmer Rice, itself based on a novel by Hayden Talbot. The film depicts the story of Ruth Allen (Palma), who marries Justin Victor (Heyes) over competing suitor Albert Woodruff (Hohl). Seeking revenge for this slight, Woodruff fakes his death by killing a drifter who resembles him, and frames Victor for the murder. When Woodruff returns to court Allen under a new identity, she sees through his disguise. Once Victor is freed from prison, he kills Woodruff, and goes free because a conviction would constitute double jeopardy.|$|E
