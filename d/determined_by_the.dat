5|$|A batsman can be out lbw even if {{the ball}} did not hit his leg: for example, a batsman struck on the head could be lbw.

Similarly, a batsman who has attempted {{to hit the ball}} with his bat cannot be lbw if the ball strikes him outside the line of off stump. However, some shots in cricket, such as the switch hit or reverse sweep, involve the batsman switching between a right- and left-handed stance; this affects the location of the off and leg side, which are <b>determined</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> stance.
