5|$|At a {{preliminary}} hearing on June 19, Judge Robert Taylor set a date for December 8, at which Hendrix would stand trial for two counts of illegal possession of narcotics, for which he faced as many as 20 years in prison. While {{there was no question}} as to whether the drugs were in Hendrix's luggage, in order for the Crown to prove possession they had to show that <b>he</b> <b>knew</b> <b>they</b> <b>were</b> there. In his cross-examination of Canadian customs officials, defense attorney John O'Driscoll raised doubts about whether the narcotics belonged to Hendrix, who had no drug paraphernalia in his luggage or needle tracks on his arms. After a trial that lasted for three days, the jury deliberated for 8 hours before returning a not guilty verdict, acquitting Hendrix of both charges.|$|E

25|$|Once in Harlem, a news {{broadcast}} about {{the bombing of}} the convent causes the group to realize there is more going on than they know. The Noelites have become a major new salvationist religion, which vast numbers of people cling to as the world spirals out of control. However, in private meetings, it is seen that their High Priestess only desires power and uses invented miracles to court converts. Gorsky, working for the Noelites, had planted a tracking device in Toorop's passport and bombed the convent when <b>he</b> <b>knew</b> <b>they</b> <b>were</b> in the United States. The doctor who earlier saw Aurora examines her again. When he leaves, Aurora reveals (without being told) that she is pregnant with twins despite being a virgin.|$|E
25|$|As first American carrier planes, then long-distance {{land-based}} planes began {{raids on}} the Philippines, the guerrillas became important {{for yet another}} reason. As American pilots bailed out when their planes were hit by Japanese anti-aircraft fire, they often found Filipino guerrillas waiting for them even before they hit the ground. Pilots who landed in the water were picked up quickly by Filipinos in small, swift boats. Often the pilots would be expressing their appreciation of the guerrillas to their ships' debriefing officers {{within a day or}} two. Fertig soon issued orders that pilots were not allowed to go on patrol with the guerrillas, as some of the more enthusiastic pilots were doing. <b>He</b> <b>knew</b> <b>they</b> <b>were</b> more important flying missions against Japanese targets. Besides, Colonel Fertig now had a good supply of experienced, battle-hardened American and Filipino leaders for his combat patrols.|$|E
500|$|While {{there was}} no {{question}} as to whether the drugs were in Hendrix's luggage, in order for the Crown to prove possession they had to show that <b>he</b> <b>knew</b> <b>they</b> <b>were</b> there. Judge Joseph Kelly presided over the trial proceedings, which began on December 8, 1969. Crown counsel John Malone called as witnesses the officers who discovered the drugs and the lab technicians who identified them as heroin; the prosecution rested after three hours of testimony. In his cross-examination of Canadian customs officials, defense attorney John O'Driscoll raised doubts about whether the drugs belonged to Hendrix. Mervin Wilson, the customs agent who discovered the drugs, agreed with O'Driscoll's assertion that Hendrix had drawn attention to himself at the airport by wearing what O'Driscoll described as [...] "obviously mod clothing". Wilson stated that Hendrix had no drug paraphernalia in his luggage, and Constable W.J. Matheson confirmed that Hendrix had no needle tracks on his arms.|$|E

According to reports, high-placed Saudi businessmen transferred millions of dollars through NCB to charities operating as fronts for al-Qaeda. Mahfouz states {{that he could not}} have been aware of every wire transfer moving through the bank, and that he would not have allowed such transactions had <b>he</b> <b>known</b> <b>they</b> <b>were</b> taking place. There is no evidence that Mahfouz was personally involved in any of these transactions.|$|R

2500|$|It wasn't {{until the}} {{governor}} {{called for the}} militia to meet at Apache Canyon to prepare for defense of New Mexico that he changed his mind. [...] When he saw that his militia had weapons of spears, bows, arrows and outdated firearms, <b>he</b> <b>knew</b> <b>they</b> <b>were</b> outnumbered, too under-trained and under-equipped to meet the regular United States's army. After inspecting his men, he sent them home. [...] Armijo decided he should go to Mexico and plead for more help from the Mexican government. According to a previous New Mexico State Historian, Thomas E. Chávez, {{there is no evidence}} that Armijo ever took a bribe, yet to the contrary, there is evidence to prove that Armijo was one of the few who wanted to fight the invaders.|$|E
2500|$|... “It {{was night}} of the 17th to 18thJuly, 1918. When we were sure the whole town was asleep, we quietly stole through the window into the school building. Nobody there noticed our presence, they were already all asleep. We entered through the {{unlocked}} door into the building where the women were sleeping, and woke them up, telling them quietly to get dressed at once, as {{they were to be}} taken to a safe place because of the possibility of an armed attack. They obeyed silently. We tied their hands behind their backs there and then, blindfolded them, and let them out to the cart, which was already waiting by the school, sat them in it, and sent them off to their destination. After that, we went into the room occupied by the men. We told them the same story as we had told the women. The young princes Konstantinovich (KR's sons) and Prince Paley also obeyed meekly. We took them out into the corridor, blindfolded them, bound their hands behind their backs, and put them in another cart. We had earlier decided that the carts should not go together. The only one to try to oppose us was Grand Duke Sergei Mikhailovich. Physically he was stronger than the rest. We had to grapple with him. He told us categorically {{that he was not going}} anywhere, as he knew they all were going to be killed. He barricaded himself behind the cupboard and our efforts to get him out were in vain. We lost precious time. I finally lost my patience and shot at the Grand Duke. However, I only fired with the intention of wounding him slightly and frightening him into submission. I wounded him in the arm. He did not resist further. I bound his hand and covered his eyes. We put him in the last cart and set off. We were in a great hurry: already the dawn was heralding morning. Along the way, Grand Duke Sergei Mikhailovich again repeated that <b>he</b> <b>knew</b> <b>they</b> <b>were</b> all going to be killed. “ Tell me why? He asked. “ I have never been involved in politics. I loved sports, played billiards, and was interested in numismatics. “ I reassured him as best as I could. although I was very agitated myself by everything I have been through that night. Despite his wounded arm, the Grand Duke did not complain. At last, we arrived at the mine. The shaft was not very deep and as it turned out had a ledge on one side that was not covered by water.” ...|$|E

He created the dust cloud around Krikkit and also the fake wrecked spacecraft that provoked them to develop spaceflight. <b>He</b> <b>knows</b> <b>they</b> <b>are</b> going to destroy them, and they do.
