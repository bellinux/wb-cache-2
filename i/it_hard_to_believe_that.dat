5|$|Idaho {{police officer}} Hal Jackson (William Boyett) {{arrives at the}} funeral for young Frank Dixon, Jr. (Bill Agee), who has {{died in a car}} accident. Hal, a friend of the Dixon family, does not go inside, feeling it would be too {{difficult}} to take. Hal finds <b>it</b> <b>hard</b> <b>to</b> <b>believe</b> <b>that,</b> only a few days ago, the Dixons were a relatively regular family. In flashback, he recounts what led to Frank Jr.'s death. Frank Jr. has returned home for the summer to aid his father, Frank Sr. (Harold Agee), on the family farm. He also visits his girlfriend Betty Hutchins (Christine Lynch). When Frank Sr.'s new tractor arrives at the local train station, Frank Jr.'s brother Alan (Tim Bosworth) wishes to drive it, having recently taken a driver's test. His father disallows it, so Frank Jr. drives it home.|$|E
25|$|Frederick Douglass (born Frederick Augustus Washington Bailey; – February 20, 1895) was an African-American social reformer, abolitionist, orator, writer, and statesman. After {{escaping}} from slavery in Maryland, {{he became a}} national leader of the abolitionist movement in Massachusetts and New York, gaining note for his dazzling oratory and incisive antislavery writings. In his time, he was described by abolitionists as a living counter-example to slaveholders' arguments that slaves lacked the intellectual capacity to function as independent American citizens. Northerners at the time found <b>it</b> <b>hard</b> <b>to</b> <b>believe</b> <b>that</b> such a great orator {{had once been a}} slave.|$|E
25|$|Ben Hecht and Charles MacArthur {{investigated}} {{the case in}} conjunction with police. Hecht's first clue was a police photograph of the two weapons used in the shooting. Both were virtually identical Colt M1911's. Hecht thought it odd {{that a man who}} appeared to be a penniless vagrant—he had less than $5 on his person when found—would carry such an expensive weapon which was not widely available to the public at the time, instead of selling it. He also found <b>it</b> <b>hard</b> <b>to</b> <b>believe</b> <b>that</b> a mere drifter would risk a conflict with a veteran who was widely known to carry a gun. MacArthur came to a similar conclusion and came to find that the stranger's weapon had been sold to Wanderer's cousin Fred several years earlier.|$|E

500|$|Lawrence Witmer {{pointed out}} that social {{behavior}} can't be determined by brain endocasts and the brains of solitary leopards are identical to those of a cooperatively hunting lion; estimated brain sizes only show that an animal may have hunted in groups. In his opinion, the brains of tyrannosaurs were large enough for what he dubs [...] "communal hunting", a semi-organized behavior that falls between solitary and cooperative hunting. Witmer claims that communal hunting is a step towards the evolution of cooperative hunting. He found <b>it</b> <b>hard</b> <b>to</b> <b>believe</b> <b>that</b> tyrannosaurs wouldn't have exploited the opportunity to join others in making a kill, and thus decrease risk and increase their chances of success.|$|E

Miss Katsura is one of the finest players I've faced in a world's tournament, while Welker Cochran, five-time holder of the Billiards World Crown, predicted: [...] "Given another two or three years of American competition and she will be the world's champion.... Masako has opened a new field for women. Her presence has made the game attractive to women for the first time. She has the power of a man and strokes beautifully. Her maneuvers with the cue ball are fantastic. All she needs is a bit more experience and she will be unbeatable." ...|$|E

500|$|Modern {{historians have}} been {{divided on the}} issue. T. F. Tout, writing in 1914, {{rejected}} the idea. J. S. Hamilton, who wrote a biography of Gaveston in 1988, {{on the other hand}} says that [...] "there {{is no question that the}} king and his favourite were lovers". Pierre Chaplais, writing a few years later, had more reservations. Chaplais cites the fact that Edward had four children with his wife – and even an extra-marital son – as well as the relative silence of contemporary commentators on the topic. He also finds <b>it</b> <b>hard</b> <b>to</b> <b>believe</b> <b>that</b> Philip IV of France would have allowed the English king to marry his daughter Isabella if Edward was known to be homosexual. Mark Ormrod has pointed out the inherent anachronism of speaking of homosexuality in a medieval context. Instead Ormrod suggests the focus should be on the motivation behind the use of sexuality in contemporary attacks on the King and Gaveston.|$|E
500|$|Three {{decades after}} Murrell's death, {{in the late}} 19th century, Morrison visited Hadleigh on a holiday, expressing {{the view that the}} area was [...] "still in the eighteenth century as regards aspect, costume, habits, and mode of thought". He learned about Murrell, and decided [...] "to write a story about him", believing that [...] "some might find <b>it</b> <b>hard</b> <b>to</b> <b>believe</b> <b>that</b> such a man, {{practicing}} such arts and wielding such influence, could have lived so recently within so short a distance from London". The landlord of the Castle Inn, a local pub, showed Morrison to the house in which Murrell had once lived, and the journalist was also able to meet with Choppen, the smith who had made Murrell's witch bottles. Morrison found that Choppen was living in a small house on the outskirts of Hadleigh; the craftsman revealed that while he had none of the bottles left, he was in possession of Murrell's spectacles. Morrison subsequently met with Murrell's son Edward [...] "a short, sturdy old fellow, with ashock head of loose, white hair" [...] who was then living in Thundersley. Morrison subsequently authored Cunning Murrell, a fictitious account of Murrell's life, as well as a more objective account, the latter for The Strand magazine. It was Morrison's novel that turned Murrell into a national figure and [...] "inflated the name of the old Essex wizard above all others of his craft".|$|E
500|$|Justice William O. Douglas {{delivered}} {{the opinion of}} the court. In a 6-2 decision, the ruling of the U.S. Court of Claims was affirmed, ruling that the tribe retained its hunting and fishing rights under the treaty. Douglas noted that Public Law 280 had been enacted and was fully in force for approximately seven years before the Termination Act became effective. The section of that law that dealt with Wisconsin provided that hunting and fishing rights in [...] "Indian Country" [...] were protected from state regulation and action. Thus from 1954 until termination in 1961, the Menominee's hunting and fishing rights were not interfered with by Wisconsin. The Termination Act stated that all federal statutes dealing with the tribe were no longer in force, but Douglas noted that it was silent with regard to treaties. The act did not specifically address the hunting and fishing rights, and Douglas stated that the U.S. Supreme Court would [...] "decline to construe the Termination Act as a backhanded way of abrogating the hunting and fishing rights of these Indians." [...] He noted that in a similar bill for the Klamath Tribe, there was a discussion on paying the tribe to buy out their hunting and fishing rights, a clear indication that Congress was aware of the implications. Douglas found <b>it</b> <b>hard</b> <b>to</b> <b>believe</b> <b>that</b> Congress would subject the United States to a claim for compensation without an explicit statement to that effect. He found that without a specific abrogation of those rights, the tribe retained those rights.|$|E

[...] Similar doubt about the feat was expressed by Ron Jones, another British POW, who also found <b>it</b> <b>hard</b> <b>to</b> <b>believe</b> <b>that</b> Avey, a tall, fit, strong Englishman, could have passed himself off alongside [...] "starving six-stone Jews." ...|$|E
2500|$|In October 1969 Crick {{participated in}} {{a celebration of the}} 100th year of the journal Nature in which he {{attempted}} to make some predictions about what the next 30years would hold for molecular biology. His speculations were later published in Nature. Near the end of the article, Crick briefly mentioned the search for life on other planets, but he held little hope that extraterrestrial life would be found by the year 2000. He also discussed what he described as a possible new direction for research, what he called [...] "biochemical theology". Crick wrote [...] "so many people pray that one finds <b>it</b> <b>hard</b> <b>to</b> <b>believe</b> <b>that</b> they do not get some satisfaction from it".|$|E

2500|$|The {{majority}} opinion {{was written by}} Justice Antonin Scalia, and joined by Chief Justice John Roberts and Justices Anthony Kennedy, Clarence Thomas, and Samuel Alito. [...] "Requiring the availability of classwide arbitration interferes with fundamental attributes of arbitration," [...] Scalia wrote. [...] "We find <b>it</b> <b>hard</b> <b>to</b> <b>believe</b> <b>that</b> defendants would bet the company with no effective means of review, and even harder to believe that Congress would have intended to allow state courts to force such a decision." [...] Justice Scalia focused on the impact California's unconscionability law was having on arbitration clauses - since the rule was invalidating {{a large proportion of}} arbitration agreements, the rule must violate the policy in favor of arbitration. [...] Therefore, it was preempted by the FAA.|$|E
2500|$|A {{rich and}} revenge-minded teenage {{girl at the}} high school usually {{described}} as [...] "psycho" [...] and Ryang's ex-girlfriend. She is extremely beautiful and is popular among men, and also likes to dress up in unique styles. (Her hairstyle changes every time she shows up and she seems to possess an impressive wardrobe) Readers are shown Ryang's first date with Yuri Kim in vol 3, as told to Fanta by Mungyeong Seong. [...] Yuri treated Ryang abusively, making <b>it</b> <b>hard</b> <b>to</b> <b>believe</b> <b>that</b> they ever had any more dates. [...] However, in vol 16 readers are shown a bit of Ryang's memory of him dating Yuri. [...] She is the one responsible for the long scar on his forehead, a parting [...] "gift" [...] when their relationship broke up.|$|E
2500|$|Some found <b>it</b> <b>hard</b> <b>to</b> <b>believe</b> <b>that</b> {{the punch}} could have floored {{a man like}} Liston. Hall of Fame {{announcer}} Don Dunphy said, [...] "Here {{was a guy who}} was in prison and the guards used to beat him over the head with clubs and couldn't knock him down." [...] But others contend that he wasn't the same Liston. Dave Anderson of the New York Times said Liston [...] "looked awful" [...] in his last workout before the fight. Liston's handlers secretly paid sparring partner Amos Lincoln an extra $100 to take it easy on him. Arthur Daley of the New York Times wrote that Liston's handlers knew he [...] "didn't have it anymore." [...] These comments don't accord with the fact that Liston easily beat Amos Lincoln three years later in 1968, knocking him out inside two rounds.|$|E

2500|$|That being said, {{there is}} {{consensus}} in late 20th century and early 21st century scholarship that the label 'nihilist' is misleading, {{in part because}} if his argument were genuinely meant to support nihilism it would be self-undermining. The argument, of course, is itself something, and has pretensions to communicate knowledge, in conflict with its explicit pronouncement {{that there is nothing}} and that it can't be known or communicated. Gisela Striker argues: [...] "I find <b>it</b> <b>hard</b> <b>to</b> <b>believe</b> <b>that</b> anyone should ever have thought that Gorgias seriously advocated the view that nothing is and that he was, therefore, a 'nihilist.' Similarly Caston states: [...] "Gorgias would have to be not merely disconsolate, but quite dull-witted, to have missed the conflict between his presentation and its content" [...] Finally, Wardy says, [...] "This sadly mistaken reading overlooks the most obvious consequence of Gorgias' paradoxologia (παραδοξολογία): his message refutes itself, and in consequence, so far from constituting a theory of logos, it confronts us with a picture of what language cannot be, with what it cannot be assumed to aspire to be." [...] Gigon and Newiger make similar points.|$|E
2500|$|Kevin O'Sullivan {{from the}} Daily Mirror called the affair storyline [...] "dreadful", [...] "painfully unoriginal", [...] "ludicrous tosh" [...] and [...] "far fetched", saying, [...] "A tired old rerun of 2010's who-got-Heather-pregnant nailbiter, the who-copped-off-with-Kat saga {{was about as}} {{believable}} as a Barclays banker." [...] Ally Ross from The Sun said that [...] "someone has been slipping angel dust in the Queen Vic beer and half the Square have lost their friggin' minds [...] all the men now fancy Ting Tong (Kat Moon)", while Julie Emery from Heat said, [...] "Now don't get us wrong, we love Kat Moon. [...] But we're finding <b>it</b> <b>hard</b> <b>to</b> <b>believe</b> <b>that</b> she has five (five!) blokes thinking she's sex-on-legs and lusting after her Tango'd torso. Perhaps Michael, Ray, Jack, Max and Derek all have a thing about too-tight Lycra pencil skirts and make-up that looks like it's been applied by a five year old on acid." [...] Sarah Dempster from The Guardian dubbed the storyline [...] "Who Banged Kat?", [...] "a question to which the only sane response is 'Pass us the remote, love. [...] is on Five.'" [...] She said [...] "Nobody cares" [...] about the [...] "tedious" [...] storyline, adding that the reveal would cause [...] "yawns of non-surprise" [...] from the viewers. Following the final reveal, Ellie Henman from Heat said it had been [...] "possibly {{one of the most}} gripping since who shot Phil" [...] and that the reveal was [...] "some seriously head in hands, sweaty palms, accidentally kick your dog because the moment is just too intense viewing".|$|E
