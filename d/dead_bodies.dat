This period of heavy bombardment lasted several hundred million years and is evident in the cratering still visible on geologically <b>dead</b> <b>bodies</b> of the inner Solar System such as the Moon and Mercury.

5|$|Stealth {{is based}} on {{limiting}} the player character's visibility; hiding behind objects and buildings, avoiding the enemies' cone of vision, and avoiding lighted areas aid in reducing detection.

The player can also look through keyholes to gain insight into closed rooms. Sneaking up behind enemies allows the player to silently subdue them, and unconscious or <b>dead</b> <b>bodies</b> can be moved and hidden.|$|E
