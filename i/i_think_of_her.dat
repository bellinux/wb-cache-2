2500|$|In her {{autobiography}} Cross Creek {{first published}} in 1942, Rawlings described how she owned many acres of land and also hired many people to help her with day-to-day chores and activities. An entire chapter {{of the book is}} dedicated to one woman she hired, whose name was Beatrice, but whom she was affectionately known as [...] "GeeChee", because the woman was ethnically part of the GeeChee people. In the book Rawlings said GeeChee's mother lived in nearby Hawthorne, Florida and GeeChee was blind in one eye from a fight she was involved in. GeeChee was employed by Rawlings on and off for nearly two years in which GeeChee dutifully made life easier for Rawlings. GeeChee revealed to Rawlings that her boyfriend named Leroy was serving time in prison for manslaughter, and asked Rawlings for help in gaining his release. She arranged for Leroy to be paroled to her and come work for her estate, and had a wedding on the grounds for Beatrice and Leroy. After a few weeks, Leroy aggressively demanded for more earnings from Rawlings and threatened her. She decided he had to leave, which caused her distress because she did not want GeeChee to go with him, and was sure she would. GeeChee eventually decided to stay with Rawlings, but GeeChee began to drink heavily and abandoned her. Weeks later, Rawlings went out searching for GeeChee and drove her back to her estate, describing GeeChee as a [...] "Black Florence Nightingale". GeeChee was unable to stop herself from drinking, which led a heartbroken Rawlings to dismiss her. Rawlings stated in her autobiography [...] "No maid of perfection--and now I have one--can fill the strange emptiness she left in a remote corner of my heart. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> often, and I know she does of me, for she comes once a year to see me".|$|E
6000|$|Can <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> as dead, {{and love}} {{her for the}} love she bore? [...] No--she never loved me truly: love is love for evermore.|$|E
6000|$|... 'When <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> at {{fourteen}} or fifteen, {{with that}} exquisite bloom and the floating wavy hair, I {{see a very}} different creature from what she is now.' ...|$|E
60|$|But I {{was bound}} to <b>think</b> <b>of</b> Eunice. <b>I</b> did <b>think</b> <b>of</b> <b>her,</b> before <b>I</b> ventured to accept the position--the {{critical}} position, as I shall presently show--of Philip's friend.|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh, I {{thought you}} meant Miss Graham. Mrs. Bowen is my contemporary, and so <b>I</b> didn't <b>think</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> {{when you said}} young. I should have called her pretty rather than beautiful." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes, that's the answer, <b>I</b> <b>think,</b> most <b>of</b> <b>her</b> acquaintances would give, if {{they were}} asked the same {{question}} and replied honestly," [...] said the young girl, as if musing.|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes; but write regularly?--Show that <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> all the time? When I {{really think}} I'm {{going to take}} you from her, I seem so cruel and heartless!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Go {{and tell}} her <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> all the time, and worship her. Why--you are crying again. Don't be so worried about me, dear; I think {{there is nothing to}} fear, yet." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I can't talk of it, mother--it's too terrible an idea. And I can't talk of her, nor of what <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>of</b> <b>her.</b> You {{must leave}} that to me. I do her perfect justice." ...|$|E
60|$|My dear Mother Bunch was {{an entire}} {{contrast}} to Blot. Such a fat, cosey old mamma you never saw, {{and her first}} appearance was so funny, <b>I</b> never <b>think</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> without laughing.|$|R
60|$|MAGGIE [now a scorner <b>of</b> herself]. <b>I</b> don't <b>think</b> much <b>of</b> <b>her.</b>|$|R
5000|$|Likely Lads writer Ian La Frenais said <b>of</b> <b>her</b> [...] "she was {{sexy and}} funny {{and she knew}} John Lennon...Sheila always found time for everyone, and <b>I</b> now <b>think</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> and Audrey with great affection".|$|R
6000|$|... "But {{all these}} things trouble me," [...] said he; [...] "for I feel I am sacrificing her for my own sin; and <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>of</b> <b>her,</b> and often {{come down here and}} look at this." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You still {{suspect that}} your mother knows where our Aurelia is?" [...] said Betty. [...] "When <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> demeanour, I can hardly believe it! But did you hear nothing of your little sisters?" ...|$|E
6000|$|Father Benwell smiled. [...] "When {{you are as}} old as I am," [...] he said, [...] "you {{will not}} believe in {{appearances}} where women are concerned. Do you know what <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>of</b> <b>her?</b> Beautiful, if you like--and dangerous as well." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "There you are, you see," [...] said Tom with sombre triumph; [...] "you oughtn't to {{have noticed}} {{a thing like}} that. It oughtn't to matter to you what I call <b>her.</b> <b>I</b> always <b>think</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> as Dolly." ...|$|R
60|$|Then {{the door}} opened and Alicia--for so I was used to hearing her called, nor did <b>I</b> ever <b>think</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> as my aunt in my own mind--came in, and a little in the rear my tall, dark uncle.|$|R
6000|$|... 'And actually,' he pursued, 'I don't believe <b>I</b> ever <b>think</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> when <b>I</b> am {{out of the}} way <b>of</b> <b>her!</b> No, indeed! if I had not {{believed}} that was all over, do you <b>think</b> <b>I</b> could have said what I did yesterday?' ...|$|R
60|$|But there's enough. I {{shall be}} asleep by 3, and I don't need much sleep, because I am never drowsy or tired these days. Dear, dear Susy my {{strength}} reproaches me when <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> and you, my darling.|$|E
6000|$|... "Joan is very peculiar," [...] she said. [...] "When <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> I {{feel like}} a doll. She is as strong as steel. I think that she cared for you, Douglas, and, putting aside {{everything}} else, you behaved shamefully to her." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Think of her, my dear fellow! <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> too much. I should {{absolutely}} have diddled Hounslow, {{if it had}} not been for her confounded pretty face flitting about my stupid brain. I saw you speaking to Guardy. You managed that business well.' ...|$|E
6000|$|Serviss {{looked down}} at his book. [...] "I suppose she imagines herself {{stricken}} with a mortal illness. I confess <b>I</b> sometimes <b>think</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> in that way. I can't understand why her parents--" [...] He checked himself. [...] "Where are they stopping?" ...|$|R
60|$|I am {{sure it will}} do you great good to have {{change and}} liberty and {{distraction}} in various ways. The 'anxiety' you speak of--oh, I do hope it does not relate to Gerardine. <b>I</b> always <b>think</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> when you seem anxious.|$|R
6000|$|... "Tell Mary, deacon," [...] {{said the}} young sailor, in an aside, [...] "that I rely on her promise, and that <b>I</b> shall <b>think</b> <b>of</b> <b>her,</b> {{whether it be}} under the burning sun of the line, or among the ice of the antarctic." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I'll {{tell you}} what <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> by that time. Send up your brother Richard, {{if you wish to}} do her good. Richard would be a much better person to write than yourself. I {{perceive}} that he is the reasonable member of the family." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "There was {{a little}} girl--you saw her {{when you were in}} London. She is married now, but <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> sometimes; and when I do, you and old Jennings seem to me like a couple of blithering idiots cursing things too {{wonderful}} for you to understand!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "God {{above us}} alone knows what I have or have not thought, {{but it is}} certain that at present <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> only as one who has been most kind to me, but who is more to be feared than my worst foe, if I have any." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Well," [...] {{said the}} doctor, with {{recovered}} warmth, [...] "I {{am not so}} sure that <b>I</b> <b>think</b> less <b>of</b> <b>her.</b> At first it was a sort of blow; but, dammy! I'll stick up for her. She's charming, every inch of her!" ...|$|R
6000|$|Morris Townsend {{received}} this statement {{with a smile}} that was not wholly devoid of deference. [...] "I don't know what <b>I</b> might <b>think</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> if <b>I</b> were her father. I can't put myself in that place. I speak from my own point of view." ...|$|R
60|$|I {{took the}} letter from him and read it. At my request, he has {{permitted}} me to keep it. The letter is my justification for thinking of Madame Pratolungo as <b>I</b> now <b>think</b> <b>of</b> <b>her.</b> <b>I</b> place it here, before I write another line in my Journal.|$|R
60|$|So {{ends the}} journey of my second small traveller, and when <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> safe and happy in a good home, I always fancy that (if such things may be) in the land which is lovelier than even {{beautiful}} old England, Maggie's mother watches over little Annie.|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{say nothing}} of Ada," [...] said Richard, [...] "but <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>of</b> <b>her,</b> and have thought of her very much. Look at her! See her here, sir, bending over this pillow when she has so much need to rest upon it herself, my dear love, my poor girl!" ...|$|E
6000|$|To which Peter replied inscrutably: [...] "Lord, no, never again. I bade her good-bye yesterday. She {{knows what}} <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> form. It's very good, but she carries {{it a little}} too far. Besides, she didn't want me to come, and it's {{therefore}} more discreet to keep away from her." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'She hasn't {{her health}} by any means,' said Mr Pecksniff. 'She misses her sister, my dear sir; they doted {{on each other}} from the cradle. And <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>of</b> giving <b>her</b> a run in London for a change. A good long run, sir, if I find she likes it.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Then I {{will write}} to you,' said Hermione. 'You think your sister will come? I {{should be so}} glad. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> she is wonderful. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> some <b>of</b> <b>her</b> work is really wonderful. I have two water-wagtails, carved in wood, and painted--perhaps you have seen it?' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Until she was eleven. That {{was four}} years ago. But <b>I</b> did not <b>think</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> getting lost. The automobiles, you know, are so thick----" ...|$|R
