40|$|ABSTRACT: Thermoplastic pipes {{are often}} {{manufactured}} with profiled walls to max-imize the flexural stiffness {{of the pipe}} for a given amount of polymer. Thin elements in the profile can buckle {{under the influence of}} large earth pressures associated with deep burial or other extreme loading conditions. Earth load tests have been conducted on high density polyethylene pipes with a number of different wall profiles. Two high-pressure pipe test cells have been used to conduct these tests. Observations of local buckling in the <b>internal</b> <b>liners</b> of these products have been examined and compared to stability assessments based on the conventional equation for buckling in stiffened plate structures (following modification of that equation to an equation that defines critical strain instead of critical stress).

40|$|Water-based latices, {{used in the}} {{production}} of <b>internal</b> <b>liners</b> for beer/beverage cans, were investigated using a number of analytical techniques. The epoxy-graft-acrylic polymers, used to prepare the latices, and films, produced from those latices, were also examined. It was confirmed that acrylic polymer preferentially grafts onto higher molecular weight portions of the epoxy polymer. The amount of epoxy remaining ungrafted was determined to be 80 %. This figure is higher than was previously thought. Molecular weight distribution studies were carried out on the epoxy and epoxy-g-acrylic resins. A quantitative method for determining copolymer composition using GPC was evaluated. The GPC method was also used to determine polymer composition as a function of molecular weight. IR spectroscopy was used to determine the total level of acrylic modification of the polymers and NMR was used to determine the level of grafting. Particle size determinations were carried out using transmission electron microscopy and dynamic light scattering. Levels of stabilising amine greatly affected the viscosity of the latex, particle size and amount of soluble polymer but the core particle size, as determined using TEM, was unaffected. NMR spectra of the latices produced spectra only from solvents and amine modifiers. Using solid-state CP/MAS/freezing techniques spectra from the epoxy component could be observed. FT-IR spectra of the latices were obtained after special subtraction of water. The only difference between the spectra of the latices and those of the dry film were due to the presence of the solvents in the former. A distinctive morphology in the films produced from the latices was observed. This suggested that the micelle structure of the latex survives the film forming process. If insufficient acrylic is present, large epoxy domains are produced which gives rise to poor film characteristics.

40|$|AbstractAn {{analytical}} bifurcation {{solution is}} presented for axisymmetric wrinkling on a lined pipe under axial compression without internal pressure. The <b>internal</b> <b>liner</b> consists of corrosion-resistant alloy (CRA), {{it is not}} metallurgically bonded to the carbon steel backing pipe, and it {{is assumed to be}} in a snug fit condition: i. e. there is no gap between the liner and the backing pipe, but also no prestress that would lead to a positive contact or gripping pressure between the liner and the backing. The backing is assumed to be much thicker than the liner, so that wrinkling-related deformations of the backing pipe can be neglected. The solution indicates that the incipient wrinkling strain for the snug-fit pipe without any imperfections {{is the same as the}} incipient wrinkling strain for a single pipe with (5 / 3) times the wall thickness of the liner, and the same midsurface diameter, as determined by the solution of Batterman (1965) for the case of small strains, or Peek (2000 a) for the case of finite strains. For the case when the liner-pipe friction is included the factor (5 / 3) increases slightly. A positive contact pressure due to prestress or internal pressure raises the wrinkling strain, whereas imperfections (e. g. at seam or girth welds) reduces it. The snug-fit solution accounts for neither, but nevertheless provides a useful reference wrinkling strain, and can be used to validate numerical solutions, and it gives a bifurcation modeshape and wrinkle length that can be used in numerical models to investigate post-bifurcation behaviour...|$|R

40|$|The {{performance}} of a deep water composite production riser from a system perspective is presented, and its advantages are articulated through comparisons with a typical steel riser under identical service conditions. The composite riser joints {{in this study were}} considered {{to be a part of}} a single Tension Leg Platform (TLP) riser string to be installed at a depth of 6000 ft in Gulf of Mexico. A series of numerical analyses ??????burst, collapse, fatigue, global and local ?????? have been performed, and the capacities of the composite riser have been determined utilizing long-term strength properties. The capacities associated with the hoop direction, i. e., burst and collapse, are limited by the presence of a steel <b>internal</b> <b>liner</b> whose function is to ensure pressure and fluid tightness. The collapse capacity of the riser can be drastically impaired by the presence of a debond between the liner and composite. Due to the high strength to weight ratio of the carbon/epoxy composite, its response under combined axial tension and bending moment showed great safety margins, favoring pursuits of greater water depths. The study also constructed damage envelopes associated with axial tension and bending moment, which facilitate feasibility checks for expanding the use of the composite joints to other locations or systems. The fatigue life of the composite body is expected to greatly exceed its design life, and the most critical element is the welds between the liner and metal end pieces. Since there is wide dispersion of S-N relationships for carbon/epoxy composites depending on the combinations of constituent materials, a parametric study was carried out in this study to suggest the range of acceptable S-N relationships. The composite riser is estimated to offer only moderate damping, due primarily to its specially orthotropic lay-up. The study also demonstrates that the use of Rayleigh stiffness proportional damping may not be suitable for deep water risers.

40|$|Aft {{fan noise}} is {{becoming}} a more dominant source as engine bypass ratio is increased and improved methods are for required for its control. Acoustic linings are {{an effective means of}} reducing internally generated noise and bypass liners are especially effective in attenuating aft fan noise. Previous calculations have shown that as the fan noise emerges from the bypass exhaust nozzle, {{a significant part of the}} sound field radiates directly out through the shear layer but there is also another propagation path, along which the sound field is first reflected from the hard ‘afterbody’ before it propagates out to the far field. It has been suggested that if the afterbody were acoustically lined, it would reduce the strength of that reflected field and hence the far field noise level. Here we describe results from some preliminary tests on a rig, using scaled, locally reacting, linear SDOF acoustic linings to simulate the conventional, <b>internal</b> bypass <b>liners</b> and also the new external Afterbody Liner (AL). The measured data from this ‘No-flow’ rig indicate that up to 3 dB PWL insertion loss can be achieved with an AL in addition to that achieved with conventional bypass liners. Calculations agree well with the measured PWL insertion loss spectrum although the measured SPL reductions are not so well predicted at some angles.

40|$|AbstractPipeline {{material}} with <b>internal</b> cladding or <b>liner</b> of corrosion resistant material {{has become more}} customary in the later years {{as a replacement for}} carbon steel with high corrosion allowance due to the high corrosivity of unprocessed hydrocarbons. Clad material however, offer new challenges in the fracture assessment methodology due to inhomogeneous material, where the backing steel usually is low alloy carbon steel of 415 or 450 MPa yield stress and the clad layer basically has a significantly lower yield stress. In addition, the weld metal mechanical properties may only be partly overmatching compared to the base material. For operational conditions where the local material utilization exceeds the elastic limit, commonly used assessment methods based on analytical fracture models such as BS 7910 might be inadequate for clad pipelines, and more detailed finite element modeling must be performed. This paper addresses the relevant load scenarios for a clad steel pipeline installed by S-lay.

40|$|Most damaged {{pipelines}} are structurally safe, {{but due to}} hydraulic requirements renovations are required. One {{solution is}} to apply an <b>internal</b> polymer <b>liner.</b> The critical external fluid pressure at which the liner may collapse is the target of this research. The Finite Element Method (FEM) is used and a rigorous non-linear interaction analysis allowing for large deformations and material plasticity is developed. Liners {{are assumed to be}} either perfectly circular or circular with some initial local or global geometrical imperfections. The typical local imperfection is defined as a wavy intrusion into the liner. The global imperfections take the shape of an ovalization in the damaged host pipe or an eccentric position of the loosely fitted liner relative to the damaged pipeline. A parametric study is undertaken to determine the effect of the geometrical parameters (e. g. liner thickness to radius ratio, imperfection size, ovality and size of gap between the liner and the host pipe). A comparison is made with experimental data available for circular liners, and there is good agreement with the numerical solution.;It is shown that critical external fluid pressure depends heavily on the ratio of liner thickness to radius. Thick liners experience a modest stability increase as a result of host pipe support compared to the significant stability increase for thin liners. Local geometrical imperfections have a very substantial effect on the buckling strength. The imperfection sensitivity is particularly significant for thin liners. Ovalling in the host pipe decreases stability somewhat relative to circular host pipes. Stability of loosely fitted liners degrades seriously if a significant gap exists between the liner and the host pipe, particularly when the liner is thin. Generally, the pressure which causes yield in the liner materials represents the peak value that the structure can sustain, and inelastic stability can reasonably be estimated using that point of first yield. The current ASTM design practice employs a single stability value for all liners which is not conservative for thick liners. The thesis presents an efficient new design approach based on the parametric study which includes the effect of the liner thickness to radius ratio, liner ovality, and local imperfections...|$|R
40|$|Master's thesis in Petroleum engineeringBP’s Skarv {{field is}} a stacked three layer {{reservoir}} structure. The field development plan involves drilling deviated and horizontal wells into the uppermost reservoir layer, Garn, and the lowermost reservoir layer, Tilje. Above Garn {{is a high}} pressure zone, that requires 1. 59 sg mud weight to be drilled. When Garn {{have proven to be}} a strong formation, the overburden and Garn is drilled as one section in Skarv drilling phase 1 to reach Tilje. A 9 7 / 8 ” shoe is set in top Tilje and the reservoir section in Tilje is drilled with an 8 ½” bit and left open hole and completed with gravel pack. The drainage strategy involves pressure support in Tilje, hence Garn will deplete with a faster rate. In phase 2 Garn will have depleted to an extent that drilling with 1. 59 mud will become a to large overbalance regarding differential sticking issues. The 9 7 / 8 ” shoe must therefore be set in top Garn. Due to the low pressure in Garn, Garn must be sealed off before drilling Tilje to avoid crossflow from Tilje into Garn. Garn and Ile, the middle sand, will be drilled with an 8 ½” bit. Traditionally a 7 ” liner will be set between top Garn and top Tilje. This will give a slim hole solution in the Tilje reservoir section which can lead to insufficient gravel packing resulting in hole collapse. It was proposed that expandable liner could be the solution to maintain an 8 ½” hole in Tilje. Available solutions for Skarv have been identified and Expandable liners from two vendors, Enventure GT’s SET® open hole liner and Baker Hughes linEXX™ monobore liner have been analyzed in StressCheck for installation, drilling and production loads an expandable liner could possible need to endure through the life off the well. Skarv’s J- 4 well, Skarv basis of design, Skarv casing design, NORSOK and BP internal regulations are used to set up a model in StressCheck. Expandables are special tubulars that are expanded down hole by mechanically or hydraulically pushing or pulling a cone or mandrel through the tubular. beyond the yield point, permanently deforming the pipe. When undergoing such expansion the mechanical properties of the pipes are changed. To gain a complete picture of what load scenarios the expandable must endure, the expandables were modeled both as pre- and post expanded. The analysis includes five different pressure regimes and four different mud weights as drilling and displacement fluids. Pressure regimes were calculated based on the expected depletion rate in Garn and mud weight were calculated based on minimum required mud weight in relation to well stability. Output from the analysis are safety factors, SF. For Skarv, minimum required SF for burst and collapse loads are 1. 10 and 1. 00 for collapse. In general, the limiting factor for an expandable is the collapse strength. The results however show that the limiting factors for depleted Garn is related to the burst loading, when the <b>liners</b> <b>internal</b> pressure which is the weight of the mud and the applied surface pressure, as in a pressure test, will exceed the low external reservoir pressure. For the 7. 625 X 9 7 / 8 ” SET® liner, the minimum SF was 0. 93 for burst and 2. 35 for collapse. For the 8. 625 X 10 3 / 4 ” SET® liner, the minimum SF was 0. 88 for burst and 2. 02 for collapse. For linEXX™ liner was 0. 73 for burst and 1. 32 for collapse. For all cases it was the high test pressure and injection pressures that casued the low SF. The internal pressure in a well is the pressure that can be controlled, which propose that expandables are a god solution for depleted reservoirs. By designing the well parameters to ensure the liners burst limit will not be exceeded, by e. g. tailor making the mud weight, expandable liner can be installed in Skarv wells. The expandables are not easily modeled in StressCheck when it proved challenging to ensure the correct properties are input for the pre- and post-expanded pipes and combining the two. For StressCheck to be a reliable tool for expandables, vendor should supply exact numbers or a range for both the pre-and post-expansion properties as the input variables required in StressCheck.
