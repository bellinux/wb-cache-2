5|$|Little {{is known}} of the saxaul sparrow's behaviour. Often hidden in foliage, it forages in trees and on the ground. It feeds mostly on seeds, as well as insects while {{breeding}} and as a nestling. When not breeding it forms wandering flocks, but it is less social than other sparrows while breeding, often nesting in isolated pairs. Nests are round bundles of <b>dry</b> <b>plant</b> material lined with soft materials such as feathers. They are built in holes in tree cavities, earth banks, rocky slopes, and within man-made structures or the nests of birds of prey. Two clutches {{of five or six}} eggs are typically laid in a season. Both parents construct the nest and care for their eggs and young.|$|E
25|$|When a soil {{becomes too}} <b>dry,</b> <b>plant</b> {{transpiration}} drops because {{the water is}} increasingly bound to the soil particles by suction. Below the wilting point plants are {{no longer able to}} extract water. At this point they wilt and cease transpiring altogether. Conditions where soil is too dry to maintain reliable plant growth is referred to as agricultural drought, and is a particular focus of irrigation management. Such conditions are common in arid and semi-arid environments.|$|E
25|$|Forest fires play an {{important}} role in regulating the growth of plants in the Pine Barrens. Frequent light fires tend to reduce the amount of undergrowth and promote the growth of mature trees. Forest fires have contributed to the dominance of pitch pine in the Pine Barrens. They can resist and recover quickly from fire by resprouting directly through their bark (something very unusual for pines). Their serotinous pine cones open only after having been heated by a fire. The prevalence of forest fire allows the pitch pines to dominate over oaks, which by comparison are usually killed outright by a moderate or intense fire. High air temperatures and <b>dry</b> <b>plant</b> undergrowth contribute to the intensity of the fire. While severe fires are uncommon, severe fires at fairly frequent intervals can eliminate species that do not bear seed at an early age. Frequent killing fires keep an area covered with small sprouts.|$|E

500|$|The nest is {{in a tree}} cavity, {{usually an}} old {{woodpecker}} hole, but sometimes of natural origin. Occasionally the female will enlarge an existing hole in rotten wood. The nest site is typically [...] above the ground and has a deep base of pine bark or chips of other wood, rarely supplemented with <b>dry</b> <b>plant</b> material. If {{the entrance to the}} hole is too large, it is plastered with mud, clay and sometimes dung to make it smaller. A small entrance and large interior, together {{with the use of a}} deep layer of wood chips in which to bury the eggs and small young when the adults leave the nest, may be adaptations to reduce the chance of predation. Nests with small entrance holes are most successful. Locally, a small entrance may make it less likely that the nest will be taken over by common starlings. The female undertakes most of the work, and often plasters the inside of the cavity too, taking up to four weeks to complete the construction. A nest is often re-used in subsequent years.|$|E
2500|$|Just as Tulsi {{respect is}} rewarding, her {{contempt}} attracts {{the wrath of}} Vishnu. Precautions are taken to avoid this. It is taboo to urinate, excrete or throw waste water near the plant. Uprooting and cutting branches of the plant is prohibited. When the plant withers, the <b>dry</b> <b>plant</b> is immersed in a water body with due religious rites as is the custom for broken divine images, which are unworthy for worship. Though Tulsi leaves are necessary for Hindu worship, there are strict rules for it. [...] A prayer of forgiveness may also be offered to Tulsi before the act.|$|E

40|$|Essential oils of Mentha longifolia from Senegal were {{extracted}} from fresh <b>plants</b> and <b>dried</b> <b>plants</b> {{in the shade}} for 7 days. The yields were of 0. 39 and 0. 32 % in the fresh and <b>dried</b> <b>plants</b> respectively. Analysis of the essential oils, floral waters and the assay of pulegone were carried out by GC/FID and GC/MS. The major compounds identified in the oils were pulegone (52. 0 and 42. 4 %), menthone (14. 3 and 21. 2 %), 1, 8 -cineole (13. 1 and 11. 4 %) and isomenthone (9. 0 and 13. 2 %) in the fresh and <b>dried</b> <b>plants,</b> respectively. Analyses revealed that floral waters were also characterized by the same major compounds as essential oils but at different rates. In these floral waters, pulegone constituted 60. 2 and 47. 0 %, 1, 8 - cineole 7. 9 and 19. 6 %, isomenthone 7. 2 and 10. 7 %, menthone 6. 4 and 9. 2 %, chrysanthenone 6. 4 and 3. 2 % and α-terpineol 3. 0 and 2. 7 % in the fresh and <b>dried</b> <b>plants,</b> respectively.
