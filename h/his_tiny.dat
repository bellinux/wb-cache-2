5|$|The Device Forts {{along the}} Solent also fell into Parliamentary hands {{early in the}} conflict. Calshot was garrisoned throughout, as was Brownsea, which was {{strengthened}} and equipped with additional guns. West Cowes was rapidly taken after firing on a nearby Parliamentary ship, and the Royalist commander at Yarmouth quickly negotiated a surrender of <b>his</b> <b>tiny</b> garrison. The heavily outnumbered garrison at Southsea Castle was stormed by Parliamentary forces in a night attack. Like Camber, St Andrew's and Netley were rapidly occupied and then decommissioned by Parliament. In the north-east, Hull also sided with Parliament, and its castle and blockhouses were used {{as part of the}} town's defences during multiple sieges.|$|E
5|$|The will, Balzac cautions, is a {{destructive}} force that seeks only to acquire power unless tempered by knowledge. The shopkeeper presents a foil for Valentin's future self, offering study and mental development {{as an alternative}} to consuming desire. Foedora also serves as a model for resistance to the corruption of will, insofar as she seeks at all times to excite desire in others while never giving in to her own. That Valentin is happiest living in the material squalor of <b>his</b> <b>tiny</b> garret– lost in study and writing, with the good-hearted Pauline giving herself to him– underscores the irony of his misery {{at the end of the}} book, when he is surrounded with the fruits of his material desire.|$|E

25|$|It {{is clear}} that Lucas' {{superiors}} expected some kind of offensive action from him. The point of the landing was to turn the German defences on the Winter Line, taking advantage of their exposed rear and hopefully panicking them into retreating northwards past Rome. However, Lucas instead poured more men and material into <b>his</b> <b>tiny</b> bridgehead, and strengthened his defences.|$|E
25|$|Southey married Edith Fricker at St. Mary Redcliffe, Bristol, on 14 November 1795. She was {{a sister}} of Sara Fricker, Coleridge's wife.

He joined the Phi Gamma Delta fraternity and served as student body president his senior year. Graduating Phi Beta Kappa in 1938, he won a Rhodes Scholarship to the University of Oxford in England; after deferring it for a year to play pro football, he attended Hertford College, Oxford. During this time in England, he became acquainted with Joe and John Kennedy, as their father Joseph Kennedy was the U.S. ambassador in London.|$|E
25|$|Playing shows {{late into}} the night, and living {{with his wife and}} young child in <b>his</b> <b>tiny</b> apartment, Orbison often sought refuge by taking his guitar to his car and writing songs there. Songwriter Joe Melson, an {{acquaintance}} of Orbison's, tapped on his car window one day in Texas in 1958, and the two decided to try to write some songs together. In three recording sessions in 1958 and 1959, Orbison and Melson recorded seven songs at RCA Nashville, with Atkins producing, but only two were judged worthy of release by RCA; Wesley Rose brought Orbison to the attention of producer Fred Foster at Monument Records.|$|E
25|$|Macleod {{returned}} to the shadow cabinet under Home after the 1964 election. His remit of opposing steel nationalisation came to naught as given <b>his</b> <b>tiny</b> majority Labour Prime Minister Harold Wilson did not proceed with this measure. Macleod’s speech opposing steel nationalisation had been trailed as his comeback to frontline politics, but in the event was a damp squib. Nigel Fisher wrote {{that it was the}} only really bad speech of his career. Macleod did not contest the first ever Conservative Party leadership election in 1965, but backed Edward Heath, whom he did not particularly like but thought would be a better leader than Maudling. He expected to have received 40-45 votes had he stood.|$|E

25|$|One of {{the main}} {{characters}} of McCarthyism was John Peurifoy, who was sent as the ambassador of the United States to Guatemala, as {{this was the first}} country in the American sphere of influence after World War II that included elements openly communists in his government. He came from Greece, where he had already done considerable anticommunist activity, and was installed as ambassador in November 1953, when Carlos Castillo Armas was already organizing <b>his</b> <b>tiny</b> revoucionary army. After a long meeting, Peurifoy made it clear to President Arbenz that the US was worried about the communist elements in his government, and then reported to the Department of State that the Guatemalan leader was not a communist, but that surely a Communist leader would come after him; furthermore, in January 1954 he told Time magazine: American public opinion could force us to take some measures to prevent Guatemala from falling into the orbit of international communism.|$|E
25|$|The Ottoman land campaign, {{which was}} the more {{challenging}} part, involved intimidating the ruler of Sinope into surrendering his realm, a march lasting {{more than a month}} through uninhabited mountainous wilderness, several minor battles with different opponents, and ended with the siege of Trebizond. The combined Ottoman forces blockaded the fortified city by land and sea until Emperor David agreed to surrender his capital city on terms: in return for <b>his</b> <b>tiny</b> realm, he would be given properties elsewhere in the Ottoman Empire, where David, his family, and his courtiers would live. For the rest of the inhabitants of Trebizond, however, their fates were less favorable. The Sultan divided them into three groups: one group were forced to leave Trebizond and resettle in Constantinople; the next group became slaves either of the Sultan or of his dignitaries; and the last group were left to live in the countryside surrounding Trebizond, but not within its walls. Some 800 male children became recruits for his Janissaries, the elite Ottoman military unit, which required them to convert to Islam.|$|E
25|$|A {{year after}} being {{reinstated}} {{to his job}} in the customs department, he quit and enlisted as a clerk for the Carrier Corps during World War I. During the war, he served with a British infantry during military campaigns in Cameroon, East Africa and the Middle East. Wallace-Johnson received exposure to the world outside <b>his</b> <b>tiny</b> village. After being demobilised in 1920, he moved from job to job, {{unable to find a}} comfortable niche to settle in. While working as a clerk in the Freetown municipal government, a corruption scandal erupted, involving the misappropriations of funds and equipment by top government officials, including the mayor. In his pamphlet regarding municipal governance in Freetown, A Cloud of Doom, Wallace-Johnson took credit for exposing the corruption. His exact role in the affair is not known, but no Sierra Leoneans ever challenged the veracity of his claim. In the aftermath of the scandal, the British revoked Freetown's rights to complete municipal self-government, believing that Africans, no matter how educated they were, could not govern themselves.|$|E

25|$|With Calder's fleet patrolling off Cape Finisterre in {{anticipation}} of the arrival of the combined Franco-Spanish fleet under Pierre-Charles Villeneuve, Prowse and the Sirius, in company with HMS Egyptienne were despatched to scout for the enemy. Villeneuve had been reported as having arrived in the area and on 22 July Prowse located the allied feet, with the frigate Siréne at the rear, towing a captured merchant. Prowse closed on the Siréne, intending to cut her off and board her, but Villeneuve ordered his ships to wear in succession and reverse their course to meet Calder's advancing fleet. Prowse suddenly found himself facing the entire combined fleet, which was fast bearing down on him, led by the Spanish Admiral Federico Gravina aboard the Argonauta. With <b>his</b> <b>tiny</b> frigate heavily outclassed, Prowse began to beat away to leeward as the fleet passed him on the opposite tack. Gravina, aware of the convention that a ship of the line did not open fire on a frigate, ordered that the Sirius not be fired upon and the next Spanish ships also held fire. Shortly afterwards Calder's van came into range of the fleet and a general action ensued, whereby the Sirius was fired on by the España and had two men killed and three wounded. After the battle Prowse was sent to Plymouth with the captured Spanish 74-gun Firme in tow.|$|E
500|$|In March 1966 Wilson {{called an}} election, hoping to improve <b>his</b> <b>tiny</b> {{parliamentary}} majority. He did so, increasing it to almost 100.

500|$|The Animaniacs cast of {{characters}} had a variety of inspiration, from celebrities to writers' family members to other writers. Executive producer Steven Spielberg said that the irreverence in Looney Tunes cartoons inspired the Animaniacs cast. Tom Ruegger created Pinky and the Brain, a series Sherri Stoner had also written for, after being inspired by the personalities of two of <b>his</b> <b>Tiny</b> Toon Adventures colleagues, Eddie Fitzgerald and Tom Minton. Ruegger thought of the premise for Pinky and the Brain when wondering {{what would happen if}} Minton and Fitzgerald tried to take over the world. Deanna Oliver contributed The Goodfeathers scripts and the character Chicken Boo, while Nicholas Hollander based Katie Kaboom on his teenage daughter.|$|E

500|$|By {{the end of}} the 1880s, Port Ryerse {{was dying}} out. [...] The advent of {{railways}} was making tiny lake ports obsolete, and in Port Ryerse's case this obsolescence was hastened by the town mill burning down in August 1890. [...] Against this backdrop, the family moved to Bradshaw, in Lambton County. [...] There, John began school and attended Sunday school at the village's Methodist church. [...] He was the only pupil at <b>his</b> <b>tiny</b> school not from a farm; he later claimed that this exposure to farmers gave him an early understanding of their concerns. [...] He also became involved with his church's young people's club, which put on speaking programs. [...] He was by nature shy, serious, and introverted, which made these programs a challenge at first; however, he found {{that he was able to}} succeed at them through focus and discipline.|$|E
500|$|Mugabe is {{of average}} height, {{measuring}} {{a little over}} 5 feet 7 inches, and exhibits what his biographer David Blair described as [...] "curious, effeminate mannerisms". Mugabe took great care with his appearance, typically wearing a three-piece suit, and insisting that members of his cabinet dressed in a similar Anglophile fashion. On taking power in 1980, Mugabe's hallmark was his wide-rimmed glasses, {{and he was also}} known for <b>his</b> <b>tiny</b> moustache. Unlike a number of other African leaders, Mugabe did not seek to mythologise his childhood. He avoided smoking and drinking, and—according to his first biographers, David Smith and Colin Simpson—had [...] "enormous affection for children". During his early life he had an operation on his genitals which generated rumours that he had only one testicle or half a penis; such rumours were used by opponents to ridicule him and by supporters to bolster the claim {{that he was willing to}} make severe sacrifices for the revolutionary cause.|$|E

On 1 June 1794, Cooke was a witness to the battle of the Glorious First of June, although <b>his</b> <b>tiny</b> ship was far too small to engage in combat. In the action's aftermath, Cooke was included in the general promotions issued to the fleet, becoming a post captain on 23 July 1794. For a year, Cooke was stationed off Newfoundland as flag captain to Sir James Wallace aboard the 74-gun , before returning to Britain and being offered command of the 28-gun [...] Cooke accepted, but when he found out she was ordered to the West Indies, he resigned it, having been told by Gardner that further service in the West Indies would likely kill him.|$|E
