5|$|In 1885, the Tecks {{returned}} to London, {{and took up}} residence at White Lodge, in Richmond Park. May was close to her mother, and acted as an unofficial secretary, helping to organise parties and social events. She was also close to <b>her</b> <b>aunt,</b> the Grand Duchess of Mecklenburg-Strelitz, and wrote to her every week. During the First World War, the Crown Princess of Sweden helped pass letters from May to <b>her</b> <b>aunt,</b> who lived in enemy territory in Germany until her death in 1916.|$|E

5|$|In {{the early}} 20th century, Martha Dickinson Bianchi and Millicent Todd Bingham kept the {{achievement}} of Emily Dickinson alive. Bianchi promoted Dickinson's poetic achievement. Bianchi inherited The Evergreens {{as well as the}} copyright for her aunt's poetry from her parents, publishing works such as Emily Dickinson Face to Face and Letters of Emily Dickinson, which stoked public curiosity about <b>her</b> <b>aunt.</b> Bianchi's books perpetrated legends about <b>her</b> <b>aunt</b> in the context of family tradition, personal recollection and correspondence. In contrast, Millicent Todd Bingham's took a more objective and realistic approach to the poet.|$|E

6000|$|... "To make to me, aunt?" [...] said Linda, now quite astray as to <b>her</b> <b>aunt's</b> intention. She was sure, at least, {{that there}} was no danger about the young man. Had it been <b>her</b> <b>aunt's</b> purpose to rebuke her for aught that she had done, <b>her</b> <b>aunt's</b> manner and look would have been very different,--would have been hard, severe, and full of denunciation. As it was, Madame Staubach almost hesitated in her words, and {{certainly}} had assumed much less than her accustomed austerity.|$|R
50|$|Wendy {{is living}} {{in the country with}} <b>her</b> three witch <b>aunts,</b> Gert, Gabby, and Fanny. Jules and Vincent arrive to abduct Wendy, who {{narrowly}} escapes with <b>her</b> <b>aunts.</b> To keep Wendy safe from Desmond, <b>her</b> <b>aunts</b> hide and vacation at a resort hotel, which happens to be the same in which Casper and his uncles are vacationing.|$|R

They begin discussing their future together, but Rasminah insists that she will only marry when <b>her</b> <b>aunt</b> is reunited with Kasimin. After a lengthy search, in which he almost gives up hope, Hoesin finds Kasimin at a small plantation in the hills outside of the city– Hadidjah's long-lost husband previously operated his own orchard, but had been evicted by a conniving and greedy landlord only days before. Kasimin and Hadidjah are reunited, allowing Hoesin and Rasminah to begin their own preparations.|$|E
5|$|When Amir {{does not}} return, Tati and <b>her</b> <b>aunt</b> are worried: as Tati saw Amir with Omi, she {{fears that the}} two have run away together. Heartbroken, she intends to return to Cigading. When she and <b>her</b> <b>aunt</b> visit their boss, Abdul Sidik, they unknowingly pass PardiAbdul Sidik's doctor. Upon {{returning}} home, Pardi calls Abdul Sidik and asks him to take Tati in {{as if she were}} his daughter and educate her. Tati is a fast learner, and is soon comparable to any woman from a wealthy family.|$|E

5|$|Within a {{month the}} party had been moved to a house owned by a Madame de Villentroy, located {{at the corner of}} rue de l'Arsenal and rue du Rempart near the French {{government}} offices in St. Denis. Ranavalona was reportedly pleased with the two-story house, which had a large walled garden and featured a peaked roof and wrap-around veranda reminiscent of the traditional highland homes of Madagascar. In addition to the queen and <b>her</b> <b>aunt,</b> sister, and grand-niece, the royal household included two secretaries, a cook, a maid, three servants for Ranavalona, and several more servants for <b>her</b> <b>aunt</b> and sister. The queen's private pastor was authorized to make visits freely to the royal household.|$|E
5|$|A crowded Thanksgiving dinner {{brings a}} host of family {{together}} in a small Harlem apartment, where a shy, twenty-four-year-old schoolteacher named Dorothy (Diana Ross) lives with <b>her</b> <b>Aunt</b> Em (Theresa Merritt) and Uncle Henry (Stanley Greene). Extremely introverted, Dorothy is teased by Aunt Em for never having been south of 125th Street, as she has delayed moving out to start her own, independent life as an adult.|$|E
5|$|Having {{inherited}} the Habsburg lip {{and not very}} feminine looks, Mary was not considered physically attractive. Her portraits, letters, and comments by her contemporaries do not assign her the easy Burgundian charm possessed by her grandmother, Duchess Mary of Burgundy, and <b>her</b> <b>aunt</b> Margaret. Nevertheless, she {{proved to be a}} determined and skillful politician, as well as an enthusiastic patron of literature, music, and hunting.|$|E
6000|$|Dorothy {{immediately}} fell on {{her knees}} at <b>her</b> <b>aunt's</b> feet, and hid her face in <b>her</b> <b>aunt's</b> lap. Miss Stanbury twined round her fingers the soft hair which she loved so well,--because it was a grace given by God and not bought out of a shop,--and caressed the girl's head, and muttered something that was intended for a prayer. [...] "If he will let me, aunt, I will give him up," [...] said Dorothy, looking up into <b>her</b> <b>aunt's</b> face. [...] "If he will say that I may, though I shall love him always, he may go." ...|$|R

Her parents' car crash leaves her {{orphaned}} at a young age, and as a result, she moves in with <b>her</b> <b>aunt.</b> Dinah can see the ghosts which haunt her aunt's house, which was a hospital and later a boarding school; however, <b>her</b> <b>aunt</b> and doctor believe that she suffers from schizophrenia. One day, she and her only friend, Vincent Monroe, sneak out of her aunt's house to search for materials for his garden. They stumble across an ancient mausoleum, and after Dinah reads aloud from a plaque, she discovers that her name is written on a contract which binds her {{to return to the}} mausoleum every night to free the ghosts. If she succeeds, she will win her freedom and a reward. If she fails, she will die and stay in the mausoleum as a corpse.|$|E

5|$|A {{particularly}} damning {{piece of}} evidence came from a bonnetmaker named Maria Durden who told the court that Webster had visited her {{a week before the}} murder and had said {{that she was going to}} Birmingham to sell some property, jewellery and a house that <b>her</b> <b>aunt</b> had left her. The jury interpreted this as a sign that Webster had premeditated the murder and convicted her after deliberating for about an hour and a quarter.|$|E
5|$|A {{secondary}} plot involves Merital and {{his desire}} to marry a woman named Helena, cousin to Matchless. He is kept from doing so externally by her uncle, Sir Positive Trap, by the workings of <b>her</b> <b>aunt,</b> and internally by themselves. Against her uncles wishes, Helena and Merital elope. Although Trap is angered by this, Lady Matchless steps in and defends the marriage by saying that she too will marry like her cousin. The play ends with a song about beauty, virtue, and lovers.|$|E

5000|$|Mary {{returns to}} college, where she meets and flirts with rich {{instructor}} Rodrigo. She gets {{a ride home}} from him, directing him to a stranger's Beverly Hills mansion rather than <b>her</b> <b>aunt's</b> house in East L.A. They later share a kiss over lunch. After scoffing at <b>her</b> <b>aunt's</b> suggestion that she invite Rodrigo to the upcoming party at <b>her</b> <b>aunt's</b> home, Mary approaches Bruno outside his house. She makes a deal with him that, if Bruno can make <b>her</b> <b>aunt's</b> backyard look good for a party dedicated to Mexican Independence Day, he can have a dance with Mary. Mary invites Rodrigo to the party and admits to him upon arrival at <b>her</b> <b>aunt's</b> house {{that this is where}} she actually lives. After watching how Mary dances with Rodrigo, Bruno declines Mary's offer of a dance to complete the decoration agreement. Edward arrives at the party, and he and a drunk Nora kiss. When Nora becomes afraid of her feelings and that it would destroy her career, she coldly informs Edward that she is [...] "just another girl who answered an ad in the paper" [...] to him and drives him away. Outside, she and Bruno share a bottle of wine, sad over having to lose their chances with Mary and Edward.|$|R

5|$|Catherine {{was first}} {{cared for by}} her {{paternal}} grandmother, Alfonsina Orsini (wife of Piero de' Medici). After Alfonsina's death in 1520, Catherine joined her cousins and was raised by <b>her</b> <b>aunt,</b> Clarice Strozzi. The death of Pope Leo in 1521 briefly interrupted Medici power until Cardinal Giulio de' Medici was elected Pope Clement VII in 1523. Clement housed Catherine in the Palazzo Medici Riccardi in Florence, where she lived in state. The Florentine people called her duchessina ("the little duchess"), in deference to her unrecognised claim to the Duchy of Urbino.|$|E
5|$|Manning {{became the}} target of {{bullying}} at the school {{because she was the}} only American and was viewed as effeminate. Manning had come out to two friends in Oklahoma as gay, but was not open about it at school in Wales. The students would imitate her accent, and apparently abandoned her once during a camping trip; <b>her</b> <b>aunt</b> told The Washington Post that Manning awoke to an empty camp site one morning, after everyone else had packed up their tents and left without her.|$|E
5|$|Mary soon {{experienced}} financial troubles, illnesses, and loneliness. In 1528, <b>her</b> <b>aunt</b> Margaret {{suggested that}} she should marry King James V of Scotland.

In 1530 Charles again {{suggested that she}} should remarry; he proposed to arrange a marriage to Frederick of Bavaria, who had unsuccessfully courted Mary's sister Eleanor sixteen years before. Mary rejected him as well.|$|E
