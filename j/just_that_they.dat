5|$|In 1649, {{the town}} is witness to many witch burnings. In the church, the townspeople {{try to figure out}} whom to condemn next. People begin accusing others and soon they erupt into chaos, until Marge intervenes. She tries to talk sense into the townspeople, but Moe accuses her of being a witch. Quimby assures her that she is {{entitled}} to due process which means she will be thrown off a cliff with a broomstick; if she is a witch she will be able to fly to safety, in which case the authorities expect her to report back for punishment. If she is not a witch, then she will fall to an honorable Christian death. After being shoved off the cliff, Marge flies up on the broomstick revealing that she really is a witch and vows to conquer the whole entire town. She returns to her sisters Patty and Selma. The sisters watch Ned and Maude Flanders talking about how the witches eat children, which gives them the notion to do <b>just</b> <b>that.</b> <b>They</b> knock on the Flanders' door and demand their sons, but before they leave, Maude offers the witches gingerbread men instead. The witches like these better than the children so they go to each house, getting goodies in exchange for not eating the children. As they fly off, the Sea Captain says that is how the tradition of Halloween and trick-or-treating started.|$|E
25|$|Another {{difference}} is {{between those who}} believe the New Covenant has already substantially arrived (Preterists), and that this knowledge of God that the member of the New Covenant has is primarily salvific knowledge; and those that believe that the New Covenant has not yet substantially arrived, but will in the Second Coming, and that this knowledge is more complete knowledge, meaning {{a member of the}} New Covenant no longer has to be taught anything at all regarding the Christian life (not <b>just</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> lack need for exhortation regarding salvific reconciliation with God).|$|E
25|$|A {{review was}} {{announced}} on 26 February 2016, after forty-three Coalition backbenchers including former leader Tony Abbott {{had signed a}} petition calling for the program's closure. The review did not consider {{the contents of the}} Minus 18 website, or the contents of the network partners’ websites. The review did not find that any of the official resources were inappropriate. It found that the content in guideline documents was consistent with the aims of the program and that the language and content was suitable. All lesson plans were found to be consistent with the aims of the program as were all the posters. No harm was expected to come from primary schools students viewing the material, <b>just</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> may not comprehend some terms such as transphobia or homophobia. The level of interaction between schools and parents was found to be appropriate.|$|E

25|$|TSA rules {{state that}} the range-jumping generals cannot capture an equal or higher-ranking piece, not <b>just</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> cannot jump over them. This gives a huge {{advantage}} to Black, so that Black can win every game if played right, but is not supported by Japanese articles on tenjiku shogi and has been largely abandoned in the West as unplayable. This {{is due to the}} very terse wording of the historical documents, that do not make it clear if the capture of an equal or higher-ranking piece is allowed even if such a piece cannot be jumped over. The presence of the king in the hierarchy suggested the TSA rules, since the king cannot jump-capture at all, and in any situation where the enemy king could be jumped over it would not happen in practice as it would simply be captured. Due to the resulting playability problem, it was suggested that capturing would be allowed but not jumping, but this allowed for smothered mates in the opening and again gives a huge advantage to Black. However, the rule used in this article and The Chess Variant Pages, which allows the capture of equal or higher-ranking pieces except kings or princes, removes this advantage to Black.|$|E

2500|$|Paddick {{asserts that}} he {{implemented}} the policy {{because he wanted}} his officers to deal with cannabis quickly and informally {{so that they could}} concentrate on heroin and crack cocaine offences, and street robbery and burglary, which were affecting {{the quality of life in}} Lambeth to a greater extent. [...] "olice officers said they weren't prepared any longer to drop cannabis down the drain because one of their colleagues had been arrested by internal investigators apparently for doing <b>just</b> <b>that.</b> <b>They</b> were going to arrest everybody they found even with the smallest amount of cannabis. I couldn't have allowed that to happen. They would have been doing nothing else." ...|$|E

2500|$|The {{show has}} {{received}} mixed reviews. Critics have {{compared it to}} The O.C. and Dawson's Creek, but with a more masculine appeal, and {{a significant number of}} fans have debated the relative merits of One Tree Hill versus The O.C.. Lucas and Ryan Atwood have been noted for their similarities in being brooding blond male leads in a new environment, having a wealthy nemesis and falling in love with the nemesis's popular girlfriend (Peyton/Marissa Cooper). Comparisons have also been made between Brooke and Summer Roberts for being dark-haired vixens and best friends of the popular female lead. Chad Michael Murray was originally chosen for the part of Ryan Atwood and had guest-starred on Dawson's Creek as a minor character, which led to One Tree Hill referencing Dawson's Creek in the first episode. [...] "Where Dawson's was about relationships, especially between boys and girls, One Tree Hill tries to be about masculinity, especially as negotiated through sports", wrote Tracy McLoone of PopMatters, who predicted that, despite this, it would probably be pinned as a girl's show. [...] "This doesn't mean boys won't watch it, <b>just</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> won't talk about it." [...] Allison McCracken of flowtv.org, on the other hand, called it a [...] "boy soap opera", saying, [...] "The new boy-centered soap employs 'feminine' generic serial elements to explore male adolescence and relationships between males, often focusing around brothers or fathers & sons", and, [...] "The boy soap is as pleasurable a text for female viewers as television offers today." ...|$|E
2500|$|June 22, 2012 – One {{day before}} first pitch {{between the two}} teams at Citi Field, Mets closer Frank Francisco taunted the Yankees by calling them chicken. Francisco's {{teammates}} greeted him in the Mets club house {{the next day with}} the Chicken Dance and put up a pitcture of Derek Jeter's head on the body of a chicken. [...] "I can't wait to strike out those chickens, I want to strike out the side against them. I've done it before." [...] Francisco would later go on to say [...] "I make a simple comment, <b>just</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> complain a lotfor every call, for everything, I thought it was funny. I didn't expect to make a big deal." [...] Although he would not strike out the side and allow two base runners, Francisco did notch the save in {{the first game of the}} series before going on the disabled list. Mets reliever Tim Byrdak would go as far to bring a live chicken into the clubhouse and named it [...] "Little Jerry Seinfeld" [...] in honor of a Seinfeld episode. The chicken was used as an unofficial mascot and was donated to an animal farm sanctuary in upstate New York a few days later. Francisco later admitted he himself raised chickens and is an expert about them. Despite the Mets winning the opener, the Yankees wound up winning the next two games, including halting Mets pitcher R.A. Dickey's scoreless inning streak of [...] innings to win the series. Yankee outfielder Nick Swisher playfully quipped at the end of the series [...] "who's chicken now?" ...|$|E

Will you trust to the blood that was shed upon the cross, that run down to the ground, and perished in the dust?

60|$|While the {{preparations}} for departure were being made, Nikobob offered {{to direct the}} men of Pingaree, and did so in a very capable manner.

So he directed his people to search through the storehouses of King Gos and to regain all their goods and chattels that could be found. Also he instructed them to take as much else as they required to make their new homes comfortable, so that many boats were loaded full of goods that would enable the people to restore Pingaree to its former state of comfort.|$|E

6000|$|What is now combated is the {{position}} that secession {{is consistent with the}} Constitution--is lawful and peaceful.

The nation paid very large sums (in the aggregate, I believe, nearly a hundred millions) to relieve Florida of the aboriginal tribes.

The nation is now in debt for money applied to the benefit of these so-called seceding States in common with the rest.
