Williams came second in the Constructors' Championship, scoring 77 points in total; 64 points behind McLaren. Patrese finished 3rd in the Drivers' Championship with 40 points, 41 points behind the 1989 world champion, Alain Prost.

30|$|During the {{interviews}} with project leaders, their project’s progress was discussed by identifying critical incidents as milestones: ‘Through {{the use of}} the critical incident technique one may collect specific and significant behavioral facts, providing (…) a sound basis for making inferences as to requirements for measures of typical performance (criteria), measures of proficiency (standard samples), training, selection and classification, job design and purification, operating procedures, equipment design, motivation and leadership (attitudes), and counseling and psychotherapy’ (Flanagan 1954). Critical incidents are events or conditions that interrupt the normal procedure of a project; such incidents can lead to significant deviations from the original plan and result in setbacks, delays or even termination of a project. Critical recovery takes place when the project <b>gets</b> <b>back</b> <b>on</b> <b>track</b> towards the intended or adjusted goal, which can be achieved by ‘speeding up’ activity, applying a solution, making a decision, or serendipity.
