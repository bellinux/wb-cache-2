Critics pointed {{out that in the}} 1997–98 session of Parliament, in which the Liberals held a majority, the main achievements of the government had to ratify tax treaties with Croatia and Algeria, allowing the government of Canada to <b>exchange</b> <b>tax</b> information concerning dual citizens who were Croat-Canadian and Algerian-Canadian with those two nations to club tax evasion. Chrétien for his part defending this record, arguing that he was doing a fine job as a prime minister, and the Canadian people did not want major changes to their nation. [...] One of the few areas that the government was active on was national unity. In August 1998, the Supreme Court of Canada in the Reference re Secession of Quebec ruled in favor of the federal government's claim that an unilateral declaration of independence on the part of Quebec was illegal, that to leave Confederation would require Quebec to negotiate with the federal government, and that Quebec could only leave after achieving a settlement with Ottawa granting independence. This ruling created the legal background to the bill that became the Clarity Act.|$|E

40|$|The <b>exchange</b> of <b>tax</b> {{information}} is a distinctive feature of international tax cooperation processes. The trend of intensive {{communication between the}} national tax administrations has been a political priority in economically developed countries. This area of international tax law has been subject to {{significant changes in the}} past few years. Countries are prompted to pursue the automatic <b>exchange</b> of <b>tax</b> information by entering into multilateral treaties on the <b>exchange</b> of <b>tax</b> information rather than engage in international <b>exchange</b> of <b>tax</b> information upon request by entering into bilateral agreements. These processes are promptly expedited owing to the incredible development of information and communication technologies. These developments are basically aimed at preventing different forms of international tax fraud which generate significant financial losses in the circumstances of current economic crisis. Such efforts may be justifiable regarding the interests of the countries of residence; but, what about the legal status of ordinary taxpayers who are now subject to a comprehensive and far-reaching control? The new concept may be appropriate for tracking tax fraud or embezzlement but what are its implications for law-abiding taxpayers? The national legislatures are obliged to provide for the protection of confidentiality of <b>exchanged</b> <b>tax</b> information but many states have not fully recognized the importance of providing adequate legal protection of sensitive personal and financial data. There are only a few countries whose legislations explicitly prescribe the taxpayers' right to be informed, the right to consult tax administration and the right to seek tax administration intervention as a form of legal protection in international <b>exchange</b> of <b>tax</b> information. The Serbian tax legislation does not envisage the obligation of tax authorities to notify the taxpayers about the request submitted by foreign tax authorities to provide some tax information. The OECD standards on the international <b>exchange</b> of <b>tax</b> information are given in the form of soft law. As they are endorsed by the G 20 and the European Union, the member states are obliged to incorporate them into the national legislations as binding rules on international tax cooperation. However, the boundaries of international public (tax) law are radically changing in light of the requirements for fiscal transparency and subrogation of the confidentiality of information in banking transactions...|$|R

Two alternative regimes are considered. A first, {{in which there is}} strict bank secrecy and a second, where there is international information <b>exchange</b> for <b>tax</b> purposes. In particular, we show that sharing tax information with onshore countries can be a dominant strategy for an OFC if there is enough scope for providing tax planning. Moreover, a partial reduction of tax liabilities can already prompt OFCs to voluntarily <b>exchange</b> relevant <b>tax</b> information. We also discuss the conditions under which the possible removal of bank secrecy may reduce or increase the onshore country's tax revenue...|$|R

The findings help explain the rise of non-monetary transactions during much of the 1990 s. We show that non-monetary transactions inhibit enterprise restructuring. Our findings suggest that a policy solution to the non-cash problem would require the state and public utilities to phase out arrears and offsets.
