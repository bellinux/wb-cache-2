This report has been prepared to identify the building’s fire protection and life safety features that must be provided {{in accordance with the}} applicable codes and standards. The ACME Semiconductor Fab Expansion will contain multiple separated uses and will be required to be constructed with Type I-B construction. Building Construction Documents are provided in Appendix A showing compliance with the requirements found herein. There are multiple occupancy classifications within the building. The predominant use of the building is semiconductor fabrication (H- 5), with some storage of hazardous materials (H- 2, H- 3, and H- 4). The structural fire protection requirements are presented. The structure, being Type I-B, would normally require 1 -hour fire resistance rated roof supports. Other prescriptive structural requirements are shown to be compliant. A performance based analysis is presented showing that the roof support does not reach critical temperatures for duration of one hour when exposed to a worst case credible fire scenario. The sprinkler system design requirements for the ACME Semiconductor Fab Expansion are presented showing various sprinkler system design densities. The most demanding case occurs in the Solvent Storage Room with 0. 30 gallons per minute per square foot over a design area of 3, 000 square feet. A summary of the inspection, testing, and maintenance requirements related to the fire sprinkler systems has been provided. This report presents the relevant fire detection, alarm and communication system design requirements for the ACME Semiconductor Fab Expansion. An excerpt of fire alarm design drawings has been provided in Appendix G showing the general code requirements, typical notification device layout and spacing, and a unique detection situation utilizing radiant-energy sensing detectors. Detection response analysis has been performed using DETACT, FDS, and manufacturer’s data for the unique flame detector situation. A brief summary of the inspection, testing, and maintenance requirements related to the fire alarm systems has been provided. This report presents the relevant egress requirements for the ACME Semiconductor Fab Expansion. Life Safety Plans are provided in Appendix K showing areas of non-compliance with the prescriptive requirements of the LSC. Use of the IBC would yield compliance acceptable to many authorities having jurisdiction. The egress calculations shown and simulated provide the basis for a performance based design of the egress systems in this building. This report can be used to establish the RSET value to be compared to an ASET value determined {{through the use of a}} CFD fire model. Recommendations include conducting a fire study to evaluate the egress systems in accordance with the LSC for high hazard industrial occupancies.

Currently available CAD tools, such as Cadence DF 2 or Mentor Falcon Framework, need extensions {{before they can}} be used for the automated design of micromachined devices. Works at the CMP have extended the capabilities of CADENCE OPUS and MENTOR GRAPHICS to microsystem technology. The user is able to generate layout of a microsystem including electronic and non-electronic parts in a commonly used format (GDS 2, CIF), run an extended DRC which submits the layout to design rules checks in process aspects and electrical aspects and, finally, extract parameters from the layout level to the netlist level. The extended extractor will recognise electronic components as well as microstructures, such as bridges, cantilevers and membranes. A netlist is generated and the simulation can be executed by the means of parametrized behavioural models of these microstructures. Finally, a parametrized cells library is also built. These advances as well as the addressed technologies are described in the paper...|$|R

WFS samples from 17 independent casting facilities were retrieved as investigation objects and blended individually with cement, fly ash and water in proportions to produce WFS structural flowable fills. Work scope includes tests of parameters: physical characteristics and chemical oxides of WFS, unconfined compressive strength, bleeding/shrinkage, and setting time/ penetration resistance of flowable fills. Results indicate that WFS samples vary in physical and chemical characteristics due to variation in casting operations and mineral nature, and the variation in physical and chemical characteristics is correlated with the variation of engineering behaviors of flowable fills. WFS structural flowable fills are able to demonstrate qualified performance. WFS are accordingly approved as a substantial reusable resource for structural flowable fills. An Deng[URL]...|$|R
