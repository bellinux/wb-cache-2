5000|$|The Chinese press were {{critical}} of the authorities' response to the disaster. Jilin Petrochemicals, which runs the plant that suffered the explosions, initially denied that the explosion could have leaked any pollutants into the Songhua River, saying that it produced only water and carbon dioxide. The media has focused mostly on Harbin, with almost no information on the slick's effect on cities and counties in Jilin province. Heilongjiang responded to the crisis a full week after the explosions occurred—their initial announcement attributed the impending shutoff to [...] "maintenance", and gave only a day's notice; {{it was the second}} announcement on the next day that clarified the reason for the shutoff and postponed the shutoff. In response, Vice Governor Jiao Zhengzhong of Jilin province and Deputy General Manager Zeng Yukang of CNPC have visited Harbin and expressed their apologies to the city. On 6 December, the vice-mayor of Jilin, Wang Wei, was found dead in his home. This followed a threat by the Chinese government to severely punish anyone who had covered up the severity of the accident.

40|$|AbstractWe {{consider}} {{a variant of}} the 0 – 1 Knapsack Problem, where the profit of each item corresponds to its weight plus a fixed constant. These so-called Strongly Correlated Knapsack Problems have attained much interest due to their apparent hardness and wide applicability in several fixed-charge problems. A specialized algorithm for the problem is presented, where the main approach is to derive an additional constraint from an <b>extended</b> <b>cover.</b> By surrogate relaxation with optimal multipliers, we obtain a Subset-sum Problem defined in the profits of the items. It is proved that an optimal solution to the Subset-sum Problem is also an optimal solution to the original problem provided that the largest possible number of items is chosen. Based on this observation, a 2 -optimal heuristic is derived which solves the problem to optimality for several large-sized problems. In those cases where the heuristic fails, we solve the problem to optimality by restricting the problem to a fixed number of chosen items β. For each value of β the problem is solved through dynamic programming. Extensive computational experiments are provided showing that we are able to solve strongly correlated instances faster than other algorithms solve uncorrelated instances...|$|E

As compared to a conventional SiO 2 dielectric spacing layer, the high-k dielectrics have significant advantages, such as (i) a polarizability over two times higher, (ii) an extinction cross-section 4. 1 times larger, (iii) a 5. 6 % higher transmission coefficient, (iv) a maximal 39. 9 % and average 25. 0 % increase in the transmission of the electromagnetic field, (v) an absorption of the transmitted electromagnetic field that is a maximum of 2. 8 times and an average of 1. 4 times greater, and (vi) increased absorption efficiency and <b>extended</b> <b>cover</b> range.

40|$|In mid- 1987, the {{existing}} workers’ compensation system in New South Wales {{was replaced by}} a new Scheme, called ‘WorkCover’. While WorkCover solved a number of the financial problems that had plagued its predecessor, its enactment created other issues. Furthermore, WorkCover has failed to deal with a number of gaps in providing compensation for occupational injuries, most notably those suffered by independent contractors. By combining a study of aspects of industrial law and industrial relations, this thesis will examine some of those problems and gaps, in particular: (a) Should WorkCover be amended to enable independent contractors to come within its ambit? (b) Should there be additional insurance cover available (known as ‘top-up’ insurance) to insure those parts of workers’ wages presently left unprotected by WorkCover? (c) Should workers be permitted to take out another form of ‘top-up’ insurance to increase the quantum of death cover presently provided by the Scheme? (d) Should independent contractors who arc permitted to enter WorkCover also be permitted to obtain the <b>extended</b> <b>cover</b> set out in (b) and (c) above? Where appropriate, the thesis compares WorkCover to the workers’ compensation schemes in other Australian jurisdictions.

40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{contributes to}} the supply chain design literature by providing a novel solution approach and presenting new theoretical and applied models. Using the proposed solution approach, {{we are able to}} formulate models that consider joint facility location and inventory management problems in a stochastic environment. Due to these uncertainties, it is important to design the supply chain that better adapts to unexpected changes. In Chapter 2, we study several joint location-inventory problems. In particular, we consider cases with uncapacitated facilities, capacitated facilities, correlated retailer demand, stochastic lead times, and multi-commodities. We show how to formulate these problems as conic quadratic mixed-integer problems. We compare with the existing modeling and solution methods to state that the new conic integer programming approach not only provides a more general modeling framework but also leads to fast solution times in general. Valid inequalities, including extended polymatroid and <b>extended</b> <b>cover</b> cuts, are added to strengthen the formulations and improve the computational results. In Chapter 3, we employ the technique presented in the previous chapter to explore the supply chain design problem that incorporates reverse logistics decisions. Supply chains with returned products are receiving increasing attention in the operations management community and this chapter studies a capacitated facility location model with bidirectional flows and marginal value of time for returned products. While at the retailers' site, products can be shipped back to the supplier for reprocessing. Each distribution center is capacitated and handles stocks of new and/or returned product. In Chapter 4, we study another applied area that is getting increasing attention in the operations management community: the nonprofit sector. Under some circumstances nonprofit practices can significantly differ from for-profit ones and this might require a different design of the supply chain. This chapter starts with a definition of the nonprofit supply chain identifying its major managerial challenges. Then, we provide a summarized comprehensive overview of current operations management literature that address each major challenge. The second part of the chapter studies a particular nonprofit supply chain design problem {{in the context of a}} humanitarian organization distributing food in a less secure area...|$|E
40|$|Traffic related {{trauma is}} {{the most common cause of}} {{fatality}} and severe injury to children in developed countries. The majority of these fatalities and injuries are caused by frontal and side impacts. Researchers agree that the head {{is the most}} important body region to protect for all ages of children, while the thorax is equally important for older children. Injury epidemiology has shown that special attention is needed for the 3 -year-olds in boosters and the 12 -year-olds in seat belts only. The aim of this thesis is to develop mathematical frontal and side impact models and to use them to investigate and define the beneficial characteristics of restraint systems and other crash-related car parameters. It must be emphasized that children are better protected in rear-facing child restraints; they should remain rear-facing for as long as possible. Most children have outgrown the large rear-facing restraints by the age of about 4 years. This work concentrates on injury mitigation for those who have transited to forward-facing restraints. Models for two load cases were developed and validated. One of them was a frontal impact type, and the other was a near-side impact type. The frontal model was used both for a parameter study, to define beneficial restraint system characteristics for 3 -year-olds, and for reconstructing three crashes in order to evaluate the head kinematics of the occupant model. The characteristics of the side impact load case were defined by analyzing real life crashes involving child occupants. The near-side impact model was used for a parameter study to define beneficial restraint system characteristics for 3 - and 12 -year-olds. It was also used to evaluate and propose improvements to the restraint systems within a range of common sitting positions for 12 -year-olds. The validations carried out here showed that the models developed were suitable tools for conducting comparative studies of injury mitigation systems in both frontal and near-side impacts. The parameter studies showed that several of the restraint systems for adults also reduced the values measured by the child model. In the near-side impact, a curtain airbag, a thorax-pelvis airbag and a seat belt with a pretensioner reduced the head and chest injury measures of the two occupant models. To help mitigate injuries resulting from a frontal impact, the upper belt anchor point should be positioned so that the belt is routed near mid-shoulder (slightly toward the neck) and encloses the shoulder (tight fit). The lap belt anchor points should be positioned to make the lap belt angle as horizontal as possible without inducing submarining. Seat belts with pretensioners and load limiters also reduced the head injury measures for the 3 -year-old occupant model. In side impacts, the results of the evaluation of common sitting positions suggested that extensive outboard, inboard and forward positions should be discouraged, while the restraint systems should be adapted to function with slight inboard, outboard and forward positions. This can be achieved with side supports integrated in the seat back, pre-impact (pre-brake) trigged seat belts, high performance full cell coverage curtain airbags, and/or thorax-pelvis airbags with an <b>extended</b> <b>cover</b> area. These findings are significant contributions to the continuous work of mitigating traffic accident induced injuries and fatalities to children...|$|E
