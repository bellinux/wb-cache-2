The system uses a bundle of 16 optical fibers that both deliver light and capture its reemission. This bundle runs in parallel with a cable carrying EEG signals from 16 microelectrodes. Both data collection arrays terminate in a precision-machined cap that is surgically attached to the skull. Free movement is enabled by suspending the cables with an elastic cord. Rats are also tracked with a video system so their behavior can be compared to hemodynamic and neural activity. Optical measurements are done with 760 and 830 nm laser diodes using a time-multiplexed, frequency-encoded illumination scheme at a source-switching speed of 68 Hz.

40|$|In {{this paper}} we present two novel {{techniques}} {{for improving the}} performance of the Internet Small Computer Systems Interface (iSCSI) protocol, which is the basis for IP-based networked block storage today. We demonstrate that by making a few modifications to an existing iSCSI implementation, it is possible to increase the iSCSI protocol processing throughput from 1. 4 Gbps to 3. 6 Gbps. Our solution scales with the CPU clock speed and can be easily implemented in software using any general purpose processor without requiring specialized iSCSI protocol processing hardware. To gain an in-depth understanding of the processing costs associated with an iSCSI protocol implementation, we built an iSCSI fast path in a userlevel sandbox environment. We discovered that the generation of Cyclic Redundancy Codes (CRCs) which is required for data integrity, and the data copy operations which are required for the interaction between iSCSI and TCP represent the main bottlenecks in iSCSI protocol processing. We propose two optimizations to iSCSI implementations to address these bottlenecks. Our first optimization is on the way CRCs are being calculated. We replace the industry standard algorithm proposed by Prof. Dilip Sarwate with ‘Slicing-by- 8 ’ (SB 8), a new algorithm capable of ideally reading arbitrarily large amounts of data at a time while keeping its memory requirement at reasonable level. Our second optimization is on the way iSCSI interacts with the TCP layer.

40|$|The {{central part}} of the Accelerator Control System at Fermilab is a cluster of Java Data Acquisition Engines (DAEs). In order to read or set data, an {{application}} needs to connect to one of the DAEs through the plain Remote Method Invocation (RMI) protocol. As the system grew over the past decade, new security concerns appeared. The existing client-server communication protocol failed to meet higher security requirements, because it employs fairly simple rules of authentication and does not support either encryption or <b>data</b> <b>integrity</b> <b>checks.</b> Besides that, the API providing access to all functions of the control system seemed to be too complex for inexperienced client application developers. Therefore, it was decided to introduce an intermediary level in the architecture between DAEs and client applications. This tier, named Secure Controls Framework (SCF), provides security for the client connections and offers new simplified API for Control System access. In the SCF, security features are implemented on the transport level by means of the Kerberos V 5 protocol. They include strong user authentication and encryption (or message integrity codes) applied to the network traffic. Special attention was paid to automation of the authentication process and making it less annoying for the users. A generic Kerberos implementation in Java was extended to support various types of ticket caches, including memory caches on Windows and Macs, and implement an automated ticket discovery.

40|$|The {{total amount}} of {{information}} stored on disks has increased tremendously in recent years with data storage, sharing and backup becoming more important than ever. The demand for storage has not only changed in size, but also in speed, reliability and security. These requirements not only create a big challenge for storage administrators who must decide on several aspects of storage policy with respect to provisioning backups, retention, redundancy, security, performance, etc. but also for storage system architects who must aim for a one system fits all design. Storage policies like backup and security are typically set by system administrators for an entire file system, logical volume or storage pool. However, this granularity is too large and can sacrifice storage efficiency and performance—particularly since different files have different storage requirements. In the same context, clustered storage systems that are typically used for data storage or as file servers, provide very high performance and maximum scalability by striping data across multiple nodes. However, high number of storage nodes in such large systems also raises concerns for reliability in terms of loss of data due to failed nodes, or corrupt blocks on disk drives. Redundancy techniques similar to RAID across these nodes are not common {{because of the high}} overhead incurred owing to the parity calculations for all the files present on the file system. In the same way, <b>data</b> <b>integrity</b> <b>checks</b> are often omitted or disabled in file systems to guarantee high throughput from the storage system. This is because not all the files require redundancy or data protection mechanism, and achieving higher throughput outweighs the need to have these computationally expensive routines in place. ^ In this thesis, we begin by studying the I/O access patterns of different applications that typically use clustered storage. The study helps us understand the application requirements from a file system. We then propose a framework for an attribute-based extendable storage system which will allow storage policy decisions to be made at a file-level granularity and {{at all levels of the}} storage stack, including file system and device managers. We propose to do this by using a file 2 ̆ 7 s extended attributes that will enable different defined tasks via plugins or functions implemented at various levels within the storage stack. The applications can set extended attributes for their files, or directories, and extract a complete content-aware storage functionality from the storage system stack. We present a stackable user-space file system which will make it easier to write and install these plugins. Using our stackable file system technique, these plugins can be programmed in user-space and mounted by non-privileged users. We also provide two scenarios where our framework can be used to provide an overall improved performance for a reliable clustered storage system. ...|$|E

The computation overheads on both the cloud server and the verifier can be significantly reduced by making use of data auditing {{because there is no}} necessity to retrieve the entire file but rather just use a spot checking technique. A number of cloud data auditing schemes have been proposed recently, but a majority of the proposals are based on Public Key Infrastructure (PKI). There are some drawbacks in these protocols: (1) It is mandatory to verify the validity of public key certificates before using any public key, which makes the verifier incur expensive computation cost. (2) Complex certificate management makes the whole protocol inefficient.
