5|$|The <b>duodenum</b> and the jejunum are {{the first}} and second parts of the small intestine, respectively. The {{suspensory}} muscle of the <b>duodenum</b> marks their formal division. The suspensory muscle arises from the right crus of the diaphragm as it passes around the esophagus, continues as connective tissue around the stems of the celiac trunk (celiac artery) and superior mesenteric artery, passes behind the pancreas, and enters {{the upper part of the}} mesentery, inserting into the junction between the <b>duodenum</b> and jejunum, the duodenojejunal flexure. Here, the muscles are continuous with the muscular layers of the <b>duodenum.</b>|$|E
5|$|The {{ligament}} {{contains a}} slender band of skeletal muscle from the diaphragm and a fibromuscular band of smooth muscle from the horizontal and ascending {{parts of the}} <b>duodenum.</b> When it contracts, by virtue of connections to {{the third and fourth}} parts of the <b>duodenum,</b> the suspensory muscle of the <b>duodenum</b> widens the angle of the duodenojejunal flexure, allowing movement of the intestinal contents.|$|E
5|$|The {{suspensory}} muscle of <b>duodenum</b> {{is a thin}} muscle {{connecting the}} junction between the <b>duodenum,</b> jejunum, and duodenojejunal flexure to connective tissue surrounding the superior mesenteric artery and coeliac artery. It {{is also known as}} the ligament of Treitz. The suspensory muscle most often connects to both the third and fourth parts of the <b>duodenum,</b> as well as the duodenojejunal flexure, although the attachment is quite variable.|$|E
5|$|During a Whipple's procedure, {{commonly}} used to treat pancreatic cancer by removing the pancreas, <b>duodenum,</b> {{and part of the}} jejunum, the ligament of Treitz is separated from the <b>duodenum</b> and preserved. When the remaining jejunum is anastamosed with the pylorus of the stomach, it may be passed through the ligament.|$|E
5|$|According to some authors, {{who use the}} {{original}} description by Treitz, the muscle may {{be divided into two}} sections: a ligamentous portion attaching the right crus of diaphragm to the connective tissue surrounding the coeliac artery and superior mesenteric artery; and a lower muscular portion from the connective tissue attaching to the <b>duodenum.</b> The superior portion is also described as the Hilfsmuskel. These two parts are now considered anatomically distinct, with the suspensory muscle referring solely to the lower structure attaching at the <b>duodenum.</b>|$|E
5|$|Embryologically, the {{suspensory}} muscle of the <b>duodenum</b> {{is derived}} from mesoderm. It {{plays an important role}} in the embryological rotation of the small intestine as the superior retention band.|$|E
5|$|Ascending cholangitis, {{also known}} as acute cholangitis or simply cholangitis, is an {{infection}} of the bile duct (cholangitis), usually caused by bacteria ascending from its junction with the <b>duodenum</b> (first part of the small intestine). It tends to occur if the bile duct is already partially obstructed by gallstones.|$|E
5|$|Bile is {{produced}} by the liver, and serves to eliminate cholesterol and bilirubin from the body, as well as emulsifying of fats {{to make them more}} soluble in water and aid in their digestion. Bile is formed in the liver by hepatocytes (liver cells) and excreted into the common hepatic duct. Part of the bile is stored in the gall bladder because of back pressure (exerted by the sphincter of Oddi), and may be released at the time of digestion. The gallbladder also concentrates the bile by absorbing water and dissolved salts from it. All bile reaches the <b>duodenum</b> (first part of the small intestine) through the common bile duct and the ampulla of Vater. The sphincter of Oddi, located at the junction of the ampulla of Vater and the <b>duodenum,</b> is a circular muscle that controls the release of both bile and pancreatic secretions into the digestive tract.|$|E
5|$|The {{suspensory}} muscle {{marks the}} formal {{division between the}} first and second parts of the small intestine, the <b>duodenum</b> and the jejunum. This division is used to mark the difference between the upper and lower gastrointestinal tracts, which is relevant in clinical medicine as it may determine the source of bleeding in the gastrointestinal tract.|$|E
5|$|Gastric acid acts as {{a barrier}} against {{microorganisms}} to prevent infections and {{is important for the}} digestion of food. Its low pH denatures proteins and thereby makes them susceptible to degradation by digestive enzymes such as pepsin. The low pH also activates the enzyme precursor pepsinogen into the active enzyme pepsin by self-cleavage. After leaving the stomach, the hydrochloric acid of the chyme is neutralized in the <b>duodenum</b> by sodium bicarbonate.|$|E
5|$|Superior {{mesenteric}} artery syndrome (SMA) is {{an extremely}} rare life-threatening condition that can either be congenital and chronic, or induced and acute. SMA Syndrome is characterised by compression of the <b>duodenum</b> between the abdominal aorta and the superior mesenteric artery, and maywhen congenitalresult from a short suspensory muscle. One surgical treatment is Strong's operation, which involves cutting the suspensory muscle, though this is not often carried out.|$|E
5|$|The biliary tree is {{normally}} relatively free of bacteria because of certain protective mechanisms. The sphincter of Oddi {{acts as a}} mechanical barrier. The biliary system normally has low pressure (8 to 12 cmH2O) and allows bile to flow freely through. The continuous forward flow of the bile in the duct flushes bacteria, if present, into the <b>duodenum,</b> and does not allow {{the establishment of an}} infection. The constitution of bilebile salts and immunoglobulin secreted by the epithelium of the bile duct also has a protective role.|$|E
5|$|Murphy {{developed}} his eponymous anastomotic button for a sutureless anastomosis of the gallbladder to the <b>duodenum</b> (his preferred treatment for acute cholecystitis), {{but it was}} equally suitable for intestinal anastomoses. He developed it in the experimental animal laboratory in a barn behind his house and first used it {{less than a week}} after developing it on a dog. The Murphy button can be credited as the forerunner of the modern end-to-end stapling instrument after having become the method of choice for operations at the Mayo Clinic and elsewhere in the United States for over twenty years.|$|E
5|$|In 1974, Thomas Henry Flewett {{suggested}} the name rotavirus after observing that, when viewed through an electron microscope, a rotavirus particle {{looks like a}} wheel (rota in Latin); the name was officially recognised by the International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses four years later. In 1976, related viruses were described in several other species of animals. These viruses, all causing acute gastroenteritis, were recognised as a collective pathogen affecting humans and animals worldwide. Rotavirus serotypes were first described in 1980, and in the following year, rotavirus from humans was first grown in cell cultures derived from monkey kidneys, by adding trypsin (an enzyme found in the <b>duodenum</b> of mammals and now known to be essential for rotavirus to replicate) to the culture medium. The ability to grow rotavirus in culture accelerated the pace of research, and by the mid-1980s the first candidate vaccines were being evaluated.|$|E
5|$|The gold {{standard}} test for biliary obstruction is still {{endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography}} (ERCP). This {{involves the use of}} endoscopy (passing a tube through the mouth into the esophagus, stomach and thence to the <b>duodenum)</b> to pass a small cannula into the bile duct. At that point, radiocontrast is injected to opacify the duct, and X-rays are taken to get a visual impression of the biliary system. On the endoscopic image of the ampulla, one can sometimes see a protuberant ampulla from an impacted gallstone in the common bile duct or the frank extrusion of pus from the common bile duct orifice. On the X-ray images (known as cholangiograms), gallstones are visible as non-opacified areas in the contour of the duct. For diagnostic purposes, ERCP has now generally been replaced by MRCP. ERCP is only used first-line in critically ill patients in whom delay for diagnostic tests is not acceptable; however, if the index of suspicion for cholangitis is high, an ERCP is typically done to achieve drainage of the obstructed common bile duct.|$|E
5|$|Frogs have maxillary teeth {{along their}} upper jaw {{which are used}} to hold food before it is swallowed. These teeth are very weak, and cannot be used to chew or catch and harm agile prey. Instead, the frog uses its sticky, cleft tongue to catch flies and other small moving prey. The tongue {{normally}} lies coiled in the mouth, free at the back and attached to the mandible at the front. It can be shot out and retracted at great speed. Some frogs have no tongue and just stuff food into their mouths with their hands. The eyes assist in the swallowing of food {{as they can be}} retracted through holes in the skull and help push food down the throat. The food then moves through the oesophagus into the stomach where digestive enzymes are added and it is churned up. It then proceeds to the small intestine (<b>duodenum</b> and ileum) where most digestion occurs. Pancreatic juice from the pancreas, and bile, produced by the liver and stored in the gallbladder, are secreted into the small intestine, where the fluids digest the food and the nutrients are absorbed. The food residue passes into the large intestine where excess water is removed and the wastes are passed out through the cloaca.|$|E
25|$|In {{the small}} intestines, the <b>duodenum</b> {{provides}} critical pH balancing to activate digestive enzymes. The liver secretes bile into the <b>duodenum</b> {{to neutralize the}} acidic conditions from the stomach, and the pancreatic duct empties into the <b>duodenum,</b> adding bicarbonate to neutralize the acidic chyme, thus creating a neutral environment. The mucosal tissue of the small intestines is alkaline with a pH of about 8.5.|$|E
25|$|The pylorus is one {{component}} of the gastrointestinal system. Food from the stomach, as chyme, passes through the pylorus to the <b>duodenum.</b> The pylorus, through the pyloric sphincter, regulates entry of food from the stomach into the <b>duodenum.</b>|$|E
25|$|The pylorus is {{the furthest}} {{part of the}} stomach that connects to the <b>duodenum.</b> It {{is divided into two}} parts, the antrum, which connects to the body of the stomach, and the pyloric canal, which connects to the <b>duodenum.</b>|$|E
25|$|The small {{intestine}} {{consists of the}} <b>duodenum,</b> jejunum and ileum. Inflammation of the {{small intestine}} is called enteritis, which if localised to just part is called duodenitis, jejunitis and ileitis, respectively. Peptic ulcers are also common in the <b>duodenum.</b>|$|E
25|$|The pyloric sphincter, or valve, is {{a strong}} ring of smooth muscle {{at the end of}} the pyloric canal which lets food pass from the stomach to the <b>duodenum.</b> It {{controls}} the outflow of gastric contents into the <b>duodenum.</b> It receives sympathetic innervation from the celiac ganglion.|$|E
25|$|Duodenum: In {{patients}} with neuromuscular disorders, particularly {{progressive systemic sclerosis}} and visceral myopathy, the <b>duodenum</b> is frequently involved. There may be dilatation, which is often more pronounced in the second, third and fourth parts. The dilated <b>duodenum</b> may be slow to empty and the grossly dilated, atonic organ may produce a sump effect.|$|E
25|$|Retroperitoneal {{parts are}} covered with adventitia. They blend into the {{surrounding}} tissue and are fixed in position. For example, the retroperitoneal section of the <b>duodenum</b> usually passes through the transpyloric plane. These include the esophagus, pylorus of the stomach, distal <b>duodenum,</b> ascending colon, descending colon and anal canal. In addition, the oral cavity has adventitia.|$|E
25|$|Barium meal {{examinations}} {{are used}} to study the lower esophagus, stomach and <b>duodenum.</b>|$|E
25|$|Recently, M. laryngeus worms {{were found}} in the <b>duodenum</b> of a Thai patient, which was the first {{gastrointestinal}} case of ammomonogamiasis. The patient complained of chest pain, haematemesia, melaena, and abdominal bloating, but no respiratory symptoms. Although nothing conclusive was determined, t the adult worms perhaps were dislodged from the larynx, reswallowed, and later found in the <b>duodenum.</b>|$|E
25|$|The upper {{gastrointestinal}} tract {{consists of the}} buccal cavity, pharynx, esophagus, stomach, and <b>duodenum.</b>|$|E
25|$|Image:Cartoon-WilkieSyndrome.JPG | A {{diagram of}} a {{compressed}} <b>duodenum</b> {{due to a}} reduced mesenteric angle.|$|E
25|$|Placement of a {{weighted}} feeding tube (e.g. Dobhoff) into the <b>duodenum</b> after previous attempts without fluoroscopy have failed.|$|E
25|$|Motilin – {{is in the}} <b>duodenum</b> and {{increases}} the migrating myoelectric complex component of gastrointestinal motility and stimulates the production of pepsin.|$|E
25|$|When food {{containing}} fat {{enters the}} digestive tract, it stimulates the secretion of cholecystokinin (CCK) from I {{cells of the}} <b>duodenum</b> and jejunum. In response to cholecystokinin, the gallbladder rhythmically contracts and releases its contents into the common bile duct, eventually draining into the <b>duodenum.</b> The bile emulsifies fats in partly digested food, thereby assisting their absorption. Bile consists primarily of water and bile salts, and also acts {{as a means of}} eliminating bilirubin, a product of hemoglobin metabolism, from the body.|$|E
25|$|The {{cells are}} filled with {{granules}} containing the digestive enzymes. These are secreted in an inactive form called (termed zymogens or proenzymes). When released into the <b>duodenum,</b> they are activated by the enzyme enteropeptidase present in {{the lining of the}} <b>duodenum.</b> The proenzymes are cleaved, creating a cascade of activating enzymes: enteropeptidase activates the proenzyme trypsinogen by cleaving it to form trypsin. The free trypsin then cleaves the rest of the trypsinogen, as well as chymotrypsinogen to its active form chymotrypsin.|$|E
25|$|The stomach {{contains}} receptors {{that can}} detect {{the presence of}} nutrients, but there are detectors in the intestines as well, and the satiety factors of the stomach and intestines can interact. Cholecystokinin (CCK) is a peptide hormone secreted by the <b>duodenum</b> that controls the rate of stomach emptying. CCK is secreted {{in response to the}} presence of fats, which are detected in by receptors in the <b>duodenum.</b> Another satiety signal produced by cells is peptide YY3-36 (PYY), which is released after a meal in amounts proportional to the calories ingested.|$|E
25|$|The {{timing of}} the {{symptoms}} {{in relation to the}} meal may differentiate between gastric and duodenal ulcers: A gastric ulcer would give epigastric pain during the meal, as gastric acid production is increased as food enters the stomach. Symptoms of duodenal ulcers would initially be relieved by a meal, as the pyloric sphincter closes to concentrate the stomach contents, therefore acid is not reaching the <b>duodenum.</b> Duodenal ulcer pain would manifest mostly 2–3hours after the meal, when the stomach begins to release digested food and acid into the <b>duodenum.</b>|$|E
25|$|Gastric {{inhibitory}} peptide (GIP) – {{is in the}} <b>duodenum</b> {{and decreases}} the stomach churning in turn slowing the emptying in the stomach. Another function is to induce insulin secretion.|$|E
25|$|Secretion {{of these}} proenzymes is via the hormones gastrin, {{cholecystokinin}} and secretin, which are secreted by {{cells in the}} stomach and <b>duodenum</b> in response to distension and/or food.|$|E
25|$|During {{the fourth}} week of embryological development, the stomach rotates. The stomach, {{originally}} {{lying in the}} midline of the embryo, rotates so that its body is on the left. This rotation also affects {{the part of the}} gastrointestinal tube immediately below the stomach, which will go on to become the <b>duodenum.</b> By the end of the fourth week, the developing <b>duodenum</b> begins to spout a small outpouching on its right side, the hepatic diverticulum, which will go on to become the biliary tree. Just below this is a second outpouching, known as the cystic diverticulum, that will eventually develop into the gallbladder.|$|E
