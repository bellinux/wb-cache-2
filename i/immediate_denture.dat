40|$|Introduction: Diabetes Mellitus is a {{clinical}} syndrome due to absolute or relative deficiency of insulin. Diabetes causes various complications {{in the body}} including compromise oral health as well. Oral health disorders include periodontitis, caries, xerostomia, oral ulcers, burning moutrh syndrome etc. Multiple approaches can be employed for oral rehabilitation of diabetic patients, one way is the provision of immediate dentures for such patients. Fabrication of immediate dentures for diabetic patients will markedly improve the Quality of Life (QoL) by improving speech, mastication, esthetics and confidence of such patients. Materials and Methods: Thirty patients with diagnosed diabetes mellitus reported to Prosthodontics Department of Hamdard University Dental Hospital, Karachi were included in this study. Twenty four patients were males while six mere females with age range of 22 - 74 years. The duration {{of this study was}} of two years from October 2011 to September 2013 [...] After taking consent Questionnaire based on OHIP- 14 was used before and after 6 months from provision of <b>immediate</b> <b>denture</b> to assess quality of life of in patients. Data was collected and statistical analysis had been done by using SPSS software. Wilcoxon Signed Ranks Test was applied and results were obtained. Probability level of P 3 ̆c. 05 was considered statistically significant. Results: There was marked improvement in quality of life in these patients after provision of immediate dentures. For two patients <b>immediate</b> <b>denture</b> was fabricated twice. accordingly. All patients were satisfied with their immediate dentures. Three patients need slight adjustments in their dentures which were provided to them All patients had significant improvement in speech (P value. 01), diet satisfaction (P value. 00), mastication (P value. 01), decrease embarrassment (P value. 08) and self confidence (P value. 025). However impact of <b>immediate</b> <b>denture</b> on variable like tension was not favorable with P values. 157 Conclusion: Provision of <b>immediate</b> <b>denture</b> brings improve QoL in diabetic patients, efforts should be made to increase awareness in dentist 2 ̆ 6 patients about immediate dentures...|$|E

40|$|Introduction. Good {{and well}} {{balanced}} diet provided by adequate mastication {{is part of}} therapy in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (DM). The critical period presents the time immediately after teeth extractions; hence, <b>immediate</b> <b>denture</b> is a rational therapeutical choice for diabetic patients. The presence of <b>immediate</b> <b>denture</b> and its compression might compromise wound healing process, affect chewing ability, food intake and consequently blood glucose level in type 2 DM patients. Objective. The objective {{of this study was}} to compare socket opening diameters (SOD), chewing ability, changes in blood glucose level and food intake in type 2 DM patients with and without maxillary immediate complete denture (MICD) during a three-week wound healing period. Methods. The study comprised 78 type 2 DM partially removable denture wearers (42 candidates for teeth extractions and 36 candidates for teeth extractions and insertion of MICDs). During the three-week period participants were followed for SOD, chewing ability and changes in blood glucose level and food intake. Results. Patients with MICD showed significantly lower reduction of SOD (seventh, 14 th, 21 st day) and higher chewing ability (seventh, 14 th, 21 st day) in comparison to patients without an MICD. Significantly lower number of patients with an MICD had changes in blood glucose level and food intake. Conclusion. Maxillary immediate complete denture presents a good therapeutic choice for type 2 DM patients, as it provides possibility of adequate mastication after teeth extractions and maintenance of nutritional status and blood glucose level...|$|E

30|$|Retention is an {{important}} parameter {{in the success of}} the prosthodontic treatment. Retention depends upon numerous factors such as physical, physiological, psychological, mechanical, and surgical factors. Denture adhesives increase the retention and stability of complete dentures. Denture adhesives have many indications such as <b>immediate</b> <b>dentures,</b> flat ridges, and patients with xerostomia and poor muscle control.|$|R
30|$|Denture {{adhesives}} {{are indicated}} for many {{cases such as}} severely atrophied edentulous ridges of severe grade, severely abused/hypertrophied tissue covering the ridges, <b>immediate</b> <b>dentures,</b> patients having lack of neuromuscular control (e.g., stroke and Parkinsonism), cases with xerostomia, maxillofacial defects which provides inadequate tissue support, and patients with lack of neuromuscular control (Muneer et al., 2013).|$|R
40|$|There is a {{very close}} {{relationship}} between the form {{and size of the}} anterior teeth and the patient's personality. In order to fulfill the patient's expectation to have his immediate complete denture with the same form and shape of his natural teeth, an impression was made before the teeth were extracted. This impression was poured with the same tooth colored self curing acrylic resin in the anterior teeth. After the resin set, the impression was fully poured with hard stone. With this method, a duplication of the natural anterior teeth was made and those teeth were set up in a better position int he <b>immediate</b> <b>denture...</b>|$|E

The immediate partial denture was prepared with interseptal alveolectomy n upper and lower jaws. The extraction procedure was planned toward 13, 12, 11, 21, 22, 23, and 32, 31, 41, 42. The patient refused 13 and 23 extraction based on psychological consideration. The operator approached the patient by re-explaining the treatment procedure and its purposes and they came up with a solution that the extraction would by split into two phases.

40|$|Advances {{in therapy}} have helped {{patients}} with periodontal disease to retain {{part of their}} natural dentition for an extended period. These patients can be well served by properly designed removable partial dentures. For the patient facing the loss of all his/her remaining natural teeth, there are three treatment options. One is for the patient to have all remaining teeth extracted and wait for 6 – 8 weeks for the extraction sites to heal. The conventional complete denture is made following healing, leaving the patient without teeth not only during the healing phase but also during the time required for the fabrication of the conventional complete denture. A second option is to convert an existing removable partial denture into an interim immediate complete denture. A third option {{is to make a}} conventional immediate complete denture.

40|$|The paper {{presents}} {{the case of}} a young female patient treated with T. B. R. implants after unsuccessful replantation. The patient applied for the treatment in the Prosthodontic Department in January 1994, three months after the procedure of retained canine replantation. Before the replantation the patient had been treated with an orthodontic traction device, but the treatment was unsuccessful. The lack of bony restitution and permanent inflammation was the reason for canine extraction and <b>immediate</b> <b>denture</b> application. Bony defect after unsuccessful replantation and canine extraction was the reason for the surgical procedure of augmentation by transplantation from iliac bone 6 months later. Healing after bone augmentation was satisfactory and provided favourable conditions for implant installation. Two cylinder T. B. R. implants were placed in the region of the missing canines in September 1995. After 6 months the healing screws were connected to the implants. After 1 week a small correction of the gingival flap, pulling the mucous membrane on the labial surface, was made on the right side. Healing then proceeded without additional problems. The final prosthetic restorations were made in March 1996. The patient has a regular check-up. The implant mobility is measured with Periotest and depth of gingival pockets with Florida probe...|$|E
40|$|The {{aesthetic}} {{needs of}} patients with complete dentures is currently greatly increasing. To encounter of the stages {{and the process of}} complete dentures settlement that takes time, the operators must develop a variety of techniques to overcome them.

40|$|Edentulous {{patients}} without {{support area}} to promote retention {{of the upper}} and lower dentures, has been recommended the treatment of dental implants osseointegrated. The overdenture operates similarly to the conventional total prosthesis, whose support is predominantly mucous, but their retention and stability are improved by implants, being an implant muco-supported or implant-retained. The benefits of this rehabilitation are many, mainly related to the aesthetics, phonetics, mastication aspects, and especially, the integration of these patients into society. The protocol prostheses have largely favorable prognosis, providing rigidity, retention and appropriate mastication. This paper has the aim to demonstrate the clinical relevance of the development of total prosthesis, overdenture type and protocol for the rehabilitation of edentulous patients. Patient D. M. P, 40 years, with postforamen incomplete cleft, suggesting diagnosis of Noonan syndrome, was evaluated radiographically and clinically. The treatment planed was complete extraction of upper and lower teeth and installation of two <b>immediate</b> <b>dentures.</b> One year after, a new evaluation was made with a view to planning dental implants, then, dentures were duplicated and made surgical guides. 4 implants were installed in the maxilla and 4 implants in the mandible. Were used Multi Unit abutments and fabricated one bar top and bottom, and then, an overdenture and a protocol prosthesis were installed. The conclusion of this was that the prosthesis and overdenture protocol provided appropriate retention and stability and chewing efficiency, safety, comfort and improved quality of life of patients with postforamen incomplete cleft and Noonan Syndrome...|$|R

40|$|There {{are growing}} {{prosthetic}} and esthetic demands for Oral Rehabilitations on osseointegratable implants, requiring precise prosthetic-surgical planning. In edentulous patients planning may be done using cephalometric analysis {{to determine the}} position of the teeth in the dental prosthesis, and consequently, those of the implants. In this clinical case, the planning and treatment of an oral implant-supported rehabilitation is described, using cephalometry to optimize prosthetic success and patient comfort. The patient presented complete mandibular and partial maxillary edentulism, with unsatisfactory esthetics and function of the anterior teeth, with accentuated vestibular inclination. In order to determine the correct position of maxillary teeth it was necessary to use a Steiner cephalometric tracing to position the maxillary central incisor in the diagnostic wax-up. Therefore, the maxillary anterior teeth were extracted, osseointegratable implants were placed (Neodent(r), Curitiba, Brazil), and an <b>immediate</b> temporary fixed <b>denture</b> was inserted. After 30 days, surgery was performed for the placement of 4 osseointegratable implants (Neodent(r), Curitiba, Brazil) in the inter-mentonian region, on which a complete, temporary, implant-supported denture was placed.

40|$|ABSTRACT: A minimum {{insertion}} torque {{has been}} suggested for immediate function of regular diameter implants. ˚ Even {{when there is a}} growing tendency to use Mini Dental Implants (MDIs) for <b>immediate</b> function of <b>dentures,</b> there is no clinical data concerning MDIs insertion torque, nor its influence on implant failure. The aim of this prospective study was to assess the insertion torque of immediate loaded MDIs in edentulous patients and its association with risk failure. ˚ Ninety MDIs were placed in the anterior mandible of 45 edentulous patients, two per patient. The insertion torque was recorded with an electronic device and failures were documented during two years follow-up. All implants were immediately loaded with overdentures, using ball (44 / 90) or bar (46 / 90) attachments. A Kaplan—Meier survival probability estimator and a fitted multiple Cox regression model were performed to establish the influence of insertion torque and other clinical parameters on implant risk failure. The average insertion torque of 90 MDIs was 12. 5 ± 7. 8 Ncm. A cumulative survival rate of 94. 2 % (5 / 90) was found by means of the Kaplan-Meier estimation. The Cox proportional-hazards regression model showed no association between insertion torque and MDIs failure. MDIs have much lower insertion torque than average conventional implants. The insertion torque of MDIs immediately loaded with mandibular dentures, seems not to be a risk factor associated to failure, at two years follow-up...|$|R
40|$|AbstractBackground/purposeThe {{purpose of}} the study was to {{evaluate}} the vertical and sagittal maxillomandibular relationship and differences in the natural head posture related to posterior airway changes in complete denture wearers using cephalometric radiographs. Materials and methodsThirty-five complete denture wearers were evaluated cephalometrically at 3 stages. Cephalograms exposed in the natural head position at rest without a prosthesis (T 0), at rest with complete dentures (T 1), and in centric occlusion (T 2). Various postural and morphological landmarks were individualized on the radiographs. ResultsChanges in the occlusal vertical dimension were associated with statistically significant alterations in head posture; from T 0 to T 1 extension of the head, from T 1 to T 2 flexion of the head, and cranial extension between T 2 and T 0 were significant (P< 0. 001). Posterior airway dimensions significantly decreased from T 0 to T 1 and T 1 to T 2 (P< 0. 001). The analysis of repeated measurements and Friedman tests were used to compare differences, and P values of < 0. 05 were considered significant. ConclusionAirway protection maintenance with extension and flexion of the head is vital because any rehabilitation involves the head and neck region. Correlation coefficients indicated significant changes in dynamic measurements of the natural head position related to complete <b>dentures.</b> <b>Immediate</b> head extension and alterations of posterior airway dimensions were observed following airway obstruction because of the insertion of complete dentures. The significant changes found in the study should help practitioners understand the mechanisms of craniofacial and cranio-vertical features before planning massive rehabilitations that reduce the oral cavity space...|$|R
