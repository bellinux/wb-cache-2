Particle trajectory calculations {{are a result}} of three interdependent computations. First, electrostatic forces must be calculated at the current position of the ion. These forces are then used to compute the current ion acceleration and then by numerical integration techniques to predict the position and velocity of the ion at the next time step. Moreover, the time step itself is continuously adjusted to maximize trajectory accuracy. A standard fourth-order Runge-Kutta method is used for numerical integration of the <b>ion</b> <b>trajectory</b> in three dimensions.|$|E

A numerical method is chosen to be used in a model to simulate <b>ion</b> <b>trajectories</b> in uniform and non-uniform electromagnetic fields. The outputs are stored in a file format which can be visualized using different software packages. <b>Ion</b> <b>trajectories</b> and their response to solar wind magnetic field and induced electric field are studied using the simulation model. Since this model can be applied to any solar wind condition, the Earth's moon environment is chosen as a real example for <b>ion</b> <b>trajectories.</b> After an analysis of the interaction of solar wind with the moon, a computational model for simulating its interaction with any other body is introduced. The outputs of this model are used to study <b>ion</b> <b>trajectories</b> at the moon wake.

Space charge effects on <b>ion</b> <b>trajectories</b> within the source were modeled through a successive iteration process involving the calculation of <b>ion</b> <b>trajectories</b> through Poisson-equation-determined electric fields, followed by calculation of modified electric fields incorporating the charge distribution from the previously calculated <b>ion</b> <b>trajectories.</b> The program has several additional features that are useful in ion source modeling: (1) averaging of space charge distributions over successive iterations to suppress instabilities, (2) Child's Law modeling of space charge limited ion emission from surfaces, and (3) emission of particular ion groups with a thermal energy distribution and at randomized angles. The results of the modeling effort indicated that significant modification of the interior geometry of the source would double Cs{sup +} ion production from our spherical ionizer and produce a significant increase in negative ion output from the source.

Characteristic individual <b>ion</b> <b>trajectories</b> are examined, as well as the devolution of bulk parameters and ion distribution functions when equal 'polar wind' streams are injected at the northern and southern ionospheres. In the <b>ion</b> <b>trajectories,</b> relatively modest and realistic perpendicular electric field power levels are found to lead to decreased mirror latitudes, substantial acceleration, and equatorial entrainment of these ions.

Correlation between electrostatic surface potential and ion neutralization probability has been shown for ion scattering from the CdS surfaces. Ne + neutralization during scattering from the Si(100) -(2 x 1) surface correlates to local surface charge density along the <b>ion</b> <b>trajectory.</b> Variations in ion neutralization rate for the intrinsic, n- and p-doped surfaces have been correlated to band bending at the Si surface...|$|E

The electric potential is calculated by use of the superposition principle and relaxation method {{with a large number}} of grid points (e. g., 100 × 100 × 100 for a cubic trap). Complex ICR experiments and spectra may now be simulated with high accuracy. Ion trajectories may be obtained for any combination of trapping and excitation modes, including quadrupolar or cubic trapping in static or dynamic mode; and dipolar, quadrupolar, or parametric excitation with single-frequency, frequency-sweep (chirp), or stored waveform inverse Fourier transform waveforms. The resulting <b>ion</b> <b>trajectory</b> may be represented either as its three-dimensional spatial path or as two-dimensional plots of x-, y-, or z-position, velocity, or kinetic energy versus time in the absence or presence of excitation.

30|$|Figure 5 {{illustrates}} how the magnetic shadow depends on proton energy. At relatively low energies, 50 keV (Fig. 5 (a)) and 200 keV (Fig. 5 (b)), the Martian magnetosphere can scatter the incident ion beams so {{that part of}} the scattered trajectories are transposed upstream of the bow shock (left and middle columns). At 600 keV and 3.2 MeV the trajectories of the incident protons are more coherent and these ions start rather to move toward the −z direction due to their gyro-motions. Comparisons between the <b>ion</b> <b>trajectories,</b> especially when they are viewed from the magnetotail (right columns), reveals how the effect of magnetic shadowing differs over the analyzed energy range 50 keV– 3.2 MeV. It is noted (not shown) that the <b>ion</b> <b>trajectories</b> of 30 MeV protons were found not to differ substantially from those of 3.2 MeV particles.|$|R
40|$|The {{trajectories of}} a large {{ensemble}} of particles are calculated in a modified Tsyganenko magnetic field model with a uniform cross-tail electric field. The model magnetotail {{can be divided into}} several distinct dynamical regimes of ion motion. Near Earth, where the field lines are dipolar the adiabatic formalism is adequate. In the mid-tail and distant tail, guiding-center theory breaks down and must be replaced by a quasi-adiabatic formalism. There is an important transition region between the adiabatic and quasi-adiabatic regions where <b>ion</b> <b>trajectories</b> become more complicated and no simple analytical description holds. This wall region is characterized by rapid ion acceleration and a major loss of particles to the dusk flank. The moments of the ion distribution function are constructued from the <b>ion</b> <b>trajectories,</b> including density, temperature, and pressure in the x-z and x-y planes. In the noon-midnight meridian plane, parameters are relatively constant except near the Earth, while the x-y plots show strong gradients across the magnetotail. Magnetotail plasma convects earthward, drifts toward dusk, and is squeezed out of the tail in the near-Earth region. A thin current sheet forms in the quasi-adiabatic region, and the pressure tensor has significant off-diagonal terms at its edges. These terms are the result of quasi-adiabatic <b>ion</b> <b>trajectories</b> which lead to azimuthally asymmetric distribution functions capable of maintaining approximate stress balance across the current sheet. Simplified analytical descriptions provide further physical insight into ion dynamics that are observed...|$|R

40|$|An Omegatron type mass {{spectrometer}} {{has been investigated}} both theoretically and experimentally to determine its detailed operation and limitations. Resolution, peak height, shape and frequency have been calculated theoretically and compared experimentally. A method is given for sketching <b>ion</b> <b>trajectories</b> in the nonlinear case (e. g., with space charge). Using this method, it is shown that {{a small amount of}} space charge will seriously hamper the operation of the Omegatron in that it will limit the maximum excursion of a resonant ion and thus limit the possible resolution. It is shown that under normal operating conditions a trapping voltage is necessary to maintain ion collection efficiency, and that this trapping voltage causes a space charge sufficient in size to result in nonlinear <b>ion</b> <b>trajectories</b> and poor operation. It is concluded that in order to get good operation of the Omegatron some method will have to be found for eliminating the space charge or its effects.

40|$|A new {{time-of-flight}} (TOF) {{mass spectrometer}} with a corkscrew <b>ion</b> <b>trajectory</b> {{was designed and}} constructed. The spiral trajectory was realized by using four toroidal electrostatic sectors. Each had fifteen-stories made of sixteen Matsuda plates piled up inside a cylindrical electrostatic sector. The ions passed the four toroidal electrostatic sectors sequentially and revolved along a figure-eight-shaped orbit on a certain projection plane. During the multiple revolutions, each <b>ion</b> <b>trajectory</b> was shifted by 50 mm per cycle on a direction perpendicular to the projection plane, thus generating a spiral trajectory. The flight path length of one cycle was 1. 308 m so that the maximum flight path length became ∼ 20 m. The mass resolution, mass accuracy, and ion transmission were tested by utilizing an orthogonally coupled electron ionization source. A mass resolution of 35, 000 (FWHM) for m/z greater than 300 was achieved. Even in a lower mass region, mass resolutions of more than 20, 000 (FWHM) were confirmed with a doublet of 12 C 51 H 514 N+ and 13 C 12 C 51 H 6 +. The mass accuracy was also improved such {{that it was better}} than 1 ppm with only one internal standard peak. An ion transmission of approximately of 100 % was observed for 15 cycles...|$|E
40|$|A novel MALDI-TOF mass {{spectrometer}} that utilizes a spiral <b>ion</b> <b>trajectory</b> was developed. In this {{mass spectrometer}}, the ions sequentially passed through four toroidal electrostatic sectors and revolved along a figure-eight-shaped orbit {{on a particular}} projection plane. Each toroidal electrostatic sector had eight stories, and during multiple revolutions, the <b>ion</b> <b>trajectory</b> shifted perpendicular to the projection plane in every cycle, thereby generating a spiral trajectory. The flight path length of one cycle was 2. 1 m; therefore, when the ions completed eight cycles, the total flight path length was 17 m. By adopting an ion optical system that had a flight path length five times longer than that in the commonly used reflectron ion optical system, the mass dependence on the mass resolving power was reduced, while improving the mass accuracy of the mass measurements. The basic performance of the system was tested by using standard peptides or the tryptic digest of bovine serum albumin. A mass resolving power of 80, 000 (full width at half maximum) was achieved at m/z = 2564 (ACTH 18 - 39).
