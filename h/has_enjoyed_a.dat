5|$|Glam metal lost {{mainstream}} {{interest in}} the early 1990s as the perceived excesses of glam metal created a backlash against the genre. A factor in the decline of glam metal was the rise of grunge in the early 1990s, which had a stripped-down aesthetic and a complete rejection of the glam metal visual style. Glam metal <b>has</b> <b>enjoyed</b> <b>a</b> revival since the late 1990s with reunions of many popular acts from the genre's 1980s heyday, {{as well as the}} retro styling of newer bands including The Darkness from Lowestoft, the United Kingdom, Santa Cruz from Helsinki, Finland, and Steel Panther from Los Angeles, America.|$|E

5|$|Twelve {{publishers}} {{rejected the}} manuscript before {{an editor at}} the Bobbs-Merrill Company risked his job to get it published. Contemporary reviewers' opinions were mixed.

5|$|Although members {{contribute}} {{capital to}} the IBRD, the Bank acquires funds primarily by borrowing on international capital markets by issuing bonds. The Bank raised $29 billion USD worth of capital in 2011 from bonds issued in 26 different currencies. The IBRD <b>has</b> <b>enjoyed</b> <b>a</b> triple-A credit rating since 1959, which {{allows it to}} borrow capital at favorable rates. It offers benchmark and global benchmark bonds, bonds denominated in non-hard currencies, structured notes with custom-tailored yields and currencies, discount notes in U.S. dollars and eurodollars. In 2011, the IBRD sought an additional $86 billion USD (of which $5.1 billion would be paid-in capital) {{as part of a}} general capital increase to increase its lending capacity to middle-income countries. The IBRD expressed in February 2012 its intent to sell kangaroo bonds (bonds denominated in Australian dollars issued by external firms) with maturities lasting until 2017 and 2022.|$|E
5|$|Conker's Bad Fur Day {{was awarded}} the 2001 BAFTA Interactive Entertainment Award for sound, IGN's Game of the Month for March 2001, and GameSpot's Best Platform Game for 2001. In 2009, Official Nintendo Magazine placed Conker's Bad Fur Day at #97 on their list of 100 Greatest Nintendo Games Ever, and GameTrailers rated it #1 on their list of Top Ten Funniest Games. In 2010, UGO {{included}} the game at #3 on their list of The 11 Weirdest Game Endings. Although the game fared well with critics in both the United Kingdom and United States, it sold worse than expected (only about 55,000 copies as of April 2001), partly due to its prohibitively high cost, advertisements exclusive to the older audience, and release {{towards the end of}} the Nintendo 64's life cycle. Nevertheless, the game <b>has</b> <b>enjoyed</b> <b>a</b> cult following due to its unique styling.|$|E
5|$|The Portland Trail Blazers, {{commonly}} known as the Blazers, are an American professional basketball team based in Portland, Oregon. The Trail Blazers compete in the National Basketball Association (NBA) {{as a member of the}} league's Western Conference Northwest Division. The team played its home games in the Memorial Coliseum before moving to Moda Center in 1995 (called the Rose Garden until 2013). The franchise entered the league as an expansion team in 1970, and <b>has</b> <b>enjoyed</b> <b>a</b> strong following: from 1977 through 1995, the team sold out 814 consecutive home games, the longest such streak in American major professional sports at the time, and only since surpassed by the Boston Red Sox. The Trail Blazers have been the only NBA team based in the bi-national Pacific Northwest, after the Vancouver Grizzlies relocated to Memphis and became the Memphis Grizzlies in 2001, and the Seattle SuperSonics relocated to Oklahoma City and became the Oklahoma City Thunder in 2008.|$|E

5|$|The {{field of}} dinosaur {{research}} <b>has</b> <b>enjoyed</b> <b>a</b> surge in activity {{that began in}} the 1970s and is ongoing. This was triggered, in part, by John Ostrom's discovery of Deinonychus, an active predator that may have been warm-blooded, in marked contrast to the then-prevailing image of dinosaurs as sluggish and cold-blooded. Vertebrate paleontology has become a global science. Major new dinosaur discoveries have been made by paleontologists working in previously unexploited regions, including India, South America, Madagascar, Antarctica, and most significantly China (the amazingly well-preserved feathered dinosaurs in China have further consolidated the link between dinosaurs and their living descendants, modern birds). The widespread application of cladistics, which rigorously analyzes the relationships between biological organisms, has also proved tremendously useful in classifying dinosaurs. Cladistic analysis, among other modern techniques, helps to compensate for an often incomplete and fragmentary fossil record.|$|E
