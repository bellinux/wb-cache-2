This implies that the radio source significantly expanded <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>time</b> <b>that</b> had passed since the burst was detected. Using the known distance to the source and the elapsed time before the scintillation ended, Frail calculated that the radio source had expanded at almost the speed of light. While various existing models already encompassed {{the notion of a}} relativistically expanding fireball, this was the first strong evidence to support such a model.|$|E
5|$|<b>In</b> <b>the</b> <b>time</b> <b>that</b> Gates was there, {{research}} focused {{mainly on}} honey production, brood diseases, wax extraction and horticultural pollination in the cucumber and cranberry industries. From 1913 to 1920 the laboratory was also {{operated by a}} superintendent, John L. Byard, hired on by Gates to maintain the facilities {{from day to day}} as well as perform wax extractions and other services to beekeepers from around the state. Following Gates' resignation in 1918, the school ceased to offer its summer beekeeping school, many of its state extension services, and the college went through several different professors before hiring Frank R. Shaw as the new professor of beekeeping in 1931. With Shaw's retirement in 1969, the laboratory was rededicated to urban and medical entomology research, with the former beekeeping program falling into relative obscurity.|$|E
25|$|Where such a {{restriction}} {{is imposed}} in a one-innings game, {{it is said}} to be a limited overs match. An example of this is an ODI match, where each team can bat for only 50 consecutive overs. Once the 50 overs are up, and the team has not been bowled out, the innings is closed. If rain intervenes so that all the allocated overs cannot be bowled in the time available for the game, the overs restriction may be modified so that the game may be completed <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>time</b> <b>that</b> remains.|$|E

500|$|On the Turkish side, by {{that night}} the 2nd Battalion 57th Infantry were on Baby 700, the 3rd Battalion, reduced to only ninety men, were at The Nek, and the 1st Battalion on Mortar Ridge. Just south {{of them was the}} 77th Infantry, next was the 27th Infantry {{opposite}} 400 Plateau. The last regiment, the 72nd Infantry, were on Battleship Hill. As for manpower, the Turks were in a similar situation to the ANZACs. Of the two regiments most heavily involved, the 57th had been destroyed, and the 27th were exhausted with heavy casualties. Large numbers of the 77th had deserted, and the regiment was in no condition to fight. The 72nd was largely intact, but they were a poorly trained force of Arab conscripts. The III Corps, having to deal with both landings, could not assist as they had no reserves available. It was not until 27 April that the 33rd and 64th Infantry Regiments arrived to reinforce the Turkish forces. The ANZACs, however, had been unable to achieve their obectives, and therefore dug in. Gallipoli, like the Western Front, turned into a war of attrition. The German commander, Liman von Saunders, was clear about the reasons for the outcome. He wrote that, [...] "on the Turkish side the situation was saved by the immediate and independent action of the 19th Division." [...] The division commander, Kemal, became noted as [...] "the most imaginative, most successful officer to fight on either side" [...] during the campaign. As a commander he was able {{to get the most out}} of his troops, typified by his order to the 57th Infantry Regiment; [...] "Men, I am not ordering you to attack.

2500|$|To {{provide a}} system {{able to make}} such an {{accurate}} measurement, and do so continually, Pollard developed a system that used the entire CRT display to provide a measurement showing only ranges a short distance {{on either side of}} a pre-selected range setting.

The time base was set to move across the screen <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>time</b> <b>that</b> represented less than a kilometre. A large potentiometer was used to control the charging rate, which provided a range offset.

Lytle and Col. Nathan Walworth, checked the Confederate advance on a slight ridge west of the Dyer field near the Widow Glenn House. While leading his men in the defense, Lytle was killed and his men, now outflanked and leaderless, fled west. Hindman's brigade on the left, under Brig. Gen.
