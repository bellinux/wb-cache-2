2500|$|Flying discs are {{disc-shaped}} objects thrown {{and caught}} for recreation, which are generally plastic and roughly 20 to 25 centimeters (8–10inches) in diameter, with a lip. The {{shape of the}} disc, an airfoil in cross-section, allows it to fly by generating lift as it moves through the air while rotating. First known as the [...] "Whirlo-Way", the <b>flying</b> <b>disc</b> was invented in 1949 by Walter Frederick Morrison who combined his fascination with invention and his interest in flight. Carved from a solid block of a plastic compound known as [...] "Tenite," [...] Morrison sold his <b>flying</b> <b>disc</b> invention to WHAM–O, which introduced it in 1957 as the [...] "Pluto Platter."

2500|$|A {{flying saucer}} (also {{referred}} to as a <b>flying</b> <b>disc)</b> is a descriptive term for a supposed type of flying craft having a disc or saucer-shaped body, commonly used generically to refer to an anomalous flying object.

50|$|Leuco dyes {{are used}} in {{applications}} where temperature response accuracy is not critical: e.g. novelties, bath toys, <b>flying</b> <b>discs,</b> and approximate temperature indicators for microwave-heated foods. Microencapsulation allows their use in wide range of materials and products.

Although Pye Wacket was terminated by 1961, research had shown lenticular-shaped vehicles possessed sound re-entry characteristics. [...] Subsequently, research proceeded towards developing manned lenticular re-entry vehicles during the 1960s and '70s.|$|R
