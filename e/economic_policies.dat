Unemployment did not fall below its 1979 level during her tenure, although in June 1990 the recorded rate (5.4%) was lower than the rate in April 1979 (5.5%). The long-term effects of her policies on manufacturing remain contentious.|$|E

This paper looks into how justified the link between Keynes's theory and the Nazi German <b>economic</b> <b>policy</b> really is. The first part introduces Keynes's ideas on <b>economic</b> <b>policy</b> and his vision of society. These are in the second part confronted with the <b>economic</b> <b>policy</b> of the Nazi Germany (and partly that of Bolshevik Russia) and common components are identified. The conclusion is that despite his explicit repudiation of socialism and dictatorship and his efforts to "save" capitalism, Keynes's concept of <b>economic</b> <b>policy</b> was similar to the <b>economic</b> <b>policy</b> of Nazi Germany and opened the way towards socialism and planning. <b>economic</b> <b>policy,</b> Germany, Keynes, Hitler, socialism...|$|R
5|$|According to the {{economist}} Zdzisław Sadowski, the Poles were generally euphoric {{about the end}} of the era of communist rule and Soviet domination. Because of the belief that the Balcerowicz Plan would quickly result in universal Western-like prosperity, the plan enjoyed broad social support, which would cause any conceivable competing pursuits of more moderate <b>economic</b> <b>policies</b> to be politically unrealistic.|$|E
5|$|Since Reagan {{left office}} in 1989, {{substantial}} debate has occurred among scholars, historians, {{and the general}} public surrounding his legacy. Supporters have pointed to a more efficient and prosperous economy as a result of Reagan's <b>economic</b> <b>policies,</b> foreign policy triumphs including a peaceful end to the Cold War, and a restoration of American pride and morale. Proponents also argue Reagan restored faith in the American Dream with his unabated and passionate love for the United States, after a decline in American confidence and self-respect under Jimmy Carter's perceived weak leadership, particularly during the Iran hostage crisis, as well as his gloomy, dreary outlook {{for the future of the}} United States during the 1980 election. Critics contend that Reagan's <b>economic</b> <b>policies</b> resulted in rising budget deficits, a wider gap in wealth, and an increase in homelessness and that the Iran–Contra affair lowered American credibility.|$|E

5|$|Upon {{his return}} to Palestine in 1918, al-Hajj Muhammad {{supervised}} his family's land possessions and entered the trade business. He {{became one of the}} prominent local grain traders in Palestine {{during the early years of}} the Mandate. Coinciding with this period, al-Hajj Muhammad became an ardent opponent of Zionism and British support for that movement. The 1920 Nebi Musa riots, unrest in 1923 and the 1929 Palestine riots all extended into Tulkarm and al-Hajj Muhammad was angered at the coercive manner in which the British authorities quelled the Palestinian Arab participants. His business eventually went bankrupt after the Mandate adopted new <b>economic</b> <b>policies</b> that saw the import of cheaper, foreign wheat at the expense of local produce. His disaffection of British <b>economic</b> <b>policies</b> partly motivated his future participation in the Palestinian Arab revolt in 1936.|$|E
