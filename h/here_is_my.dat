5|$|It {{happened}} {{on my last}} day in Hanoi. I was exhausted and an emotional wreck after the 2-week visit... The translator {{told me that the}} soldiers wanted to sing me a song. He translated as they sung. It was a song about the day 'Uncle Ho' declared their country's independence in Hanoi's Ba Dinh Square. I heard these words: 'All men are created equal; they are given certain rights; among these are life, Liberty and Happiness.' These are the words Ho pronounced at the historic ceremony. I began to cry and clap. 'These young men should not be our enemy. They celebrate the same words Americans do.' The soldiers asked me to sing for them in return... I memorized a song called 'Day Ma Di', written by anti-war South Vietnamese students. I knew I was slaughtering it, but everyone seemed delighted that I was making the attempt. I finished. Everyone was laughing and clapping, including me... <b>Here</b> <b>is</b> <b>my</b> best, honest recollection of what happened: someone (I don't remember who) led me towards the gun, and I sat down, still laughing, still applauding. It all {{had nothing to do with}} where I was sitting. I hardly even thought about where I was sitting. The cameras flashed... It is possible that it was a set up, that the Vietnamese had it all planned. I will never know. But if they did I can't blame them. The buck stops here. If I was used, I allowed it to happen... a two-minute lapse of sanity that will haunt me forever... But the photo exists, delivering its message regardless of what I was doing or feeling. I carry this heavy in my heart. I have apologized numerous times for any pain I may have caused servicemen and their families because of this photograph. It was never my intention to cause harm.|$|E

500|$|Poet Gerald Stern (born 1925), from Lawrenceville, New Jersey, was {{appointed}} as the state's first poet laureate by Governor Christine Todd Whitman on April 17, 2000. At {{the time of}} his appointment, Stern had been the author of twelve books of poetry and won the National Book Award for his 1998 collection This Time: New and Selected Poems. Stern had been a finalist for the Pulitzer Prize for Poetry in 1991 for his collection Leaving Another Kingdom. Poet and Drew University literature professor Ross Gay described Stern's work, saying that his poems [...] "feel to me, often, a bit like that story, or rather, his manner of telling it: <b>here</b> <b>is</b> <b>my</b> pain, <b>here</b> <b>is</b> <b>my</b> sorrow, here is the song I’ve made of it." [...] Stern's last public reading as poet laureate was held on June 27, 2002 at a Summer Writer's Conference held at Rutgers Universitys Camden campus.|$|E
500|$|The {{music video}} for [...] "Not on Drugs" [...] was {{directed}} by Rikkard Häggbom. It was released on Lo's Vevo channel and iTunes Store on 19 August 2014, {{the same day the}} singer announced the release of Queen of the Clouds. [...] The clip features the singer dancing and performing the song in a white film set and other locations while colored smoke bombs explode around her. During the video, computer-generated animation is projected on the background and Lo's body is edited to appear distorsed. In an interview with Rolling Stone, the artist said, [...] "I choked on the paint, the smoke made me half blind and <b>here</b> <b>is</b> <b>my</b> three-minute trip that shows the intensity and weirdness I feel when falling in love. The main theme we had in mind while making this video was 'What just happened?' It was quite amazing making something with the happy piece of my heart this time!".|$|E

500|$|Delft, {{captured}} {{in the early stages}} of the battle, was under the command of the Dutch Lieutenant Heilberg and the British Lieutenant Charles Bullen, with a small prize crew of 69 men. Ninety-three Dutch prisoners had been removed, and among the remaining Dutch sailors were 76 wounded men. As the gale intensified, it rapidly became clear that despite a tow line attached from Veteran the ship would never reach Britain, and a large board was raised on deck with the chalked message [...] "The ship is sinking". Reacting at once, boats from nearby ships organised an evacuation and began loading the Dutch prisoners for transfer to more seaworthy vessels. Bullen offered a place in the first rescue boat, from Veteran, to Heilberg, but the Dutch officer refused, gesturing to the immobile wounded who had been brought onto the maindeck as the lower decks had flooded and replying [...] "But how can I leave these men?". In response, Bullen cried out [...] "God bless you, my brave fellow! <b>Here</b> <b>is</b> <b>my</b> hand; I give you my word I will stay her with you!". The prize crew left on the second rescue boat sent from Russell, and Bullen and Heilberg waited for a third trip to bring them off with the remaining 30 wounded men and three junior Dutch officers who had also elected to stay. Before further help could arrive, however, Delft suddenly foundered, Bullen and Heilberg throwing themselves clear as the ship sank. Both were seen in the water but only Bullen reached safety, swimming to Monmouth alone.|$|E
2500|$|Translation of Abulafia's poems, as well {{as other}} medieval poems written in Hebrew, {{presents}} some challenges because some words could be interpreted with several meanings. A good example of such challenge is the poem [...] "Figs". Asking a friend for some figs, the poet writes: [...] "end a ripening fig, give a portion for seven of them, even for eight." [...] The next line of the poem was translated as [...] "And in return, <b>here</b> <b>is</b> <b>my</b> flatus." [...] The Hebrew word used in the poem was zemorah that means [...] "vine twig". Howard Tzvi Adelman from Queen's University says that [...] "Zemorah means 'penis' and 'fig,' a reference to 'vagina.' I {{think that this is a}} sexual and not a scatological reference; both, however, fit the category of the grotesque. The next line—'Henceforth I won't give it to strangers'—could fit either way." ...|$|E
2500|$|Estimates of {{the number}} of {{religious}} men killed vary greatly. One estimate is that of the 30,000 priests and monks in Spain in 1936, 13% of the secular priests and 23% of the monks were killed, amounting to 6800 religious personnel altogether. Some 283 women religious were killed, some of them badly tortured. 13bishops were killed from the dioceses of Siguenza Lleida, Cuenca, Barbastro, Segorbe, Jaén, Ciudad Real, Almeria, Guadix, Barcelona, Teruel and the auxiliary of Tarragona. Aware of the dangers, they all decided to remain in their cities: [...] "I cannot go, only <b>here</b> <b>is</b> <b>my</b> responsibility, whatever may happen," [...] said the Bishop of Cuenca. In addition 4,172diocesan priests, 2,364monks and friars, among them 259Claretians, 226Franciscans, 204Piarists, 176Brothers of Mary, 165Christian Brothers (also called the De La Salle Brothers), 155Augustinians, 132Dominicans, and 114Jesuits were killed. In some dioceses, the number of secular priests killed was overwhelming: ...|$|E
