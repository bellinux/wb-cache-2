Plant ecologists study the composition of local and regional floras, their biodiversity, genetic diversity and fitness, the adaptation of plants to their environment, and their competitive or mutualistic interactions with other species. Some ecologists even rely on <b>empirical</b> <b>data</b> from indigenous people that is gathered by ethnobotanists.

The goals of plant ecology are to understand the causes of their distribution patterns, productivity, environmental impact, evolution, and responses to environmental change.|$|E

The detailed quantitative agreement of the theory with empirical results of firms growth based on a large economic database spanning over 20 years is good. Further we find that this basic law of competition leads approximately a power law scaling over a wide range of parameters. The <b>empirical</b> <b>datas</b> are in accordance with present theory rather than a simple power law. ...|$|R

Today’s automobiles typically contains approximately five thousand or more spot weld. Current spot welding technology relies on volume on <b>empirical</b> <b>data's</b> to set the working parameters. Often this data is no sufficient to ensure that a nugget of sufficient size is formed thus quality and strength depends on the optimum welding diameter of welding nugget. There are various parameters affecting the nugget size in RSW. In this paper the effect of weld time and weld current is studied on CRCA material by experiments and also by using the FEA model...|$|R

25|$|The central theses {{underlying}} the indeterminacy of translation and other extensions of Quine's work are ontological relativity {{and the related}} doctrine of confirmation holism. The premise of confirmation holism is that all theories (and the propositions derived from them) are under-determined by <b>empirical</b> <b>data</b> (data, sensory-data, evidence); although some theories are not justifiable, failing to fit with the data or being unworkably complex, there are many equally justifiable alternatives. While the Greeks' assumption that (unobservable) Homeric gods exist is false, and our supposition of (unobservable) electromagnetic waves is true, both are to be justified solely by their ability to explain our observations.|$|E
