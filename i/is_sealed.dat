5|$|A {{fusible plug}} is a {{threaded}} metal cylinder usually of bronze, brass or gunmetal, with a tapered hole drilled completely through its length. This hole <b>is</b> <b>sealed</b> {{with a metal}} {{of low melting point}} that flows away if a pre-determined, high temperature is reached. The initial use of the fusible plug was as a safety precaution against low water levels in steam engine boilers, but later applications extended its use to other closed vessels, such as air conditioning systems and tanks for transporting corrosive or liquefied petroleum gasses.|$|E
5|$|The Naruto manga series, {{written and}} {{illustrated}} by Masashi Kishimoto, is split in two parts to divide the storyline; the second part is simply known as Part II. The plot follows the return of the ninja Naruto Uzumaki to Konohagakure, after {{two and a half years}} of training after leaving his teammates Sakura Haruno and Kakashi Hatake, and his subsequent efforts to make his best friend, Sasuke Uchiha, return with him and his friends. However, the criminal organization Akatsuki begins to hunt Naruto to get the Nine-Tailed Demon Fox that <b>is</b> <b>sealed</b> within him.|$|E
5000|$|As of 1998, however, {{women who}} have died may <b>be</b> <b>sealed</b> {{to more than one}} man. In 1998, the LDS Church created a new policy that a woman may also <b>be</b> <b>sealed</b> to more than one man. A woman, however, may not <b>be</b> <b>sealed</b> to more than one man while she is alive. She may only <b>be</b> <b>sealed</b> to {{subsequent}} partners after both she and her husband(s) have died. Thus, if a widow who <b>was</b> <b>sealed</b> to her first husband remarries, she may <b>be</b> <b>sealed</b> by proxy to all of her subsequent husband(s), but only after both she and the subsequent husbands have died. Proxy sealings, like proxy baptisms, are merely offered to the person in the afterlife, indicating that the purpose is to allow the woman to choose the right man to <b>be</b> <b>sealed</b> to.|$|R

50|$|Although the LDS Church has {{abandoned}} {{the practice of}} plural marriage, it has not abandoned the underlying doctrines of polygamy. According to the church's sacred texts and pronouncements by its leaders and theologians, the church leaves {{open the possibility that}} it may one day re-institute the practice. It is still the practice of monogamous Mormon couples to <b>be</b> <b>sealed</b> to one another. However, in some circumstances, men and women may <b>be</b> <b>sealed</b> to multiple spouses. Most commonly, a man may <b>be</b> <b>sealed</b> to multiple wives: if his first wife dies, he may <b>be</b> <b>sealed</b> to a second wife. A deceased woman may also <b>be</b> <b>sealed</b> to multiple men, but only through vicarious <b>sealing</b> if they <b>are</b> also deceased.|$|R
5|$|The {{interior}} {{surfaces of}} the arms are covered with circular, adhesive suckers. The suckers allow the octopus to anchor itself or to manipulate objects. Each sucker is usually circular and bowl-like and has two distinct parts: an outer shallow cavity called an infundibulum and a central hollow cavity called an acetabulum, {{both of which are}} thick muscles covered in a protective chitinous cuticle. When a sucker attaches to a surface, the orifice between the two structures <b>is</b> <b>sealed.</b> The infundibulum provides adhesion while the acetabulum remains free, and muscle contractions allow for attachment and detachment.|$|E
5|$|The {{pointing}} man has variously {{been described}} as either the patron of the work (Fraenger in 1947), as an advocate of Adam denouncing Eve (Dirk Bax in 1956), as Saint John the Baptist in his camel's skin (Isabel Mateo Gom√©z in 1963), or as a self-portrait. The woman below him lies within a semicylindrical transparent shield, while her mouth <b>is</b> <b>sealed,</b> devices implying that she bears a secret.

5|$|Back at Stonehenge, the Doctor {{discovers that}} the {{volunteer}} legionaries, including Rory, are Autons, {{and he is}} quickly captured as his other orbiting foes materialise around him. Above ground, as Rory fights to retain his human identity, Amy suddenly remembers him, but as his Auton identity emerges he unwillingly shoots her in the stomach and she dies. The Doctor struggles against his captors, who reveal that they have formed an alliance to imprison him in the Pandorica. Knowing the TARDIS exploding would cause the cracks destroying reality, they believe only the Doctor can operate the TARDIS, and thus removing him will prevent the explosion and save the universe. As the Doctor <b>is</b> <b>sealed</b> into the Pandorica, explosions surround the Earth in space before everything fades to black and silence.|$|E
50|$|It {{has been}} argued that the LDS Church's policy on {{sealings}} and cancellations reflect its doctrine of plural marriage. Although plural marriage is currently prohibited in the church, a man can <b>be</b> <b>sealed</b> to multiple women, in the case of widowers who <b>are</b> <b>sealed</b> to their dead and living wives. Additionally, men who are dead may <b>be</b> <b>sealed</b> by proxy to all women to whom they were legally married while alive. Recent changes in church policy also allow women to <b>be</b> <b>sealed</b> to multiple men, but only after both she and her husband(s) are dead.|$|R

5|$|In Thebes, Egypt, 1290 BC, {{high priest}} Imhotep has {{a love affair}} with Anck-su-Namun, the {{mistress}} of Pharaoh Seti I. When the Pharaoh discovers the affair, Imhotep and Anck-su-Namun assassinate him. Imhotep flees, while Anck-su-Namun kills herself, intending for Imhotep to resurrect her. Imhotep and his priests steal her corpse and travel to Hamunaptra, the city of the dead, but the resurrection ritual is stopped by Seti's bodyguards, the Medjai. Imhotep's priests are all mummified alive, while Imhotep himself is sentenced to suffer the Hom Dai, the worst of Egyptian curses, buried alive with flesh-eating scarab beetles. Imhotep <b>is</b> <b>sealed</b> away in a sarcophagus at the feet of a statue of the Egyptian god Anubis and kept under strict surveillance by the Medjai to prevent Imhotep's return.|$|E
5|$|In {{the fourth}} branch, Zero manages to kill {{all of her}} sisters and absorb their powers, {{managing}} to take down One with help from Accord. After absorbing all their powers, she and Mikhail are transported to another world and Mikhail destroys the monster Zero transforms into. With this, the flower's magic <b>is</b> <b>sealed</b> away, although Accord speculates that Zero might have survived and would reappear in some form. In the novel Drag-On Dragoon 3 Story Side, a novel detailing the events leading directly into Drakengard, a combination of events from other branches occurs. During the final confrontation with One, Mikhail is poisoned and Zero forms a pact with Mikhail to save him. After killing One, One's clone kills Zero.|$|E
5|$|Pain {{is confronted}} by Jiraiya while infiltrating Amegakure, {{resulting}} in a fight that ends with his mentor's death. However, Pain's captured Animal Path vessel is replaced shortly afterwards for Pain's attack on Konoha. The rest of the Paths are destroyed {{in the fight against}} Naruto, while Nagato recovers his faith in their mentor and world peace when talking personally. Then, he sacrifices his life to revive the people he killed in Konoha. However, Nagato is reanimated by Kabuto and sent alongside Itachi to battle Naruto and Killer Bee. Though he regains his ability to fight at his full potential, Nagato <b>is</b> <b>sealed</b> by Itachi and sent back to the afterlife. In the Japanese anime, Nagato's voice actor is Junpei Morita and the Deva Path's being Kenyu Horiuchi; in the English dub, Nagato is voiced by Vic Mignogna and his Deva Path is voiced by Troy Baker.|$|E

5|$|The {{determination}} of an individual's age by anthropologists {{depends on whether}} or not the individual was an adult or a child. The {{determination of}} the age of children, under the age of 21, is usually performed by examining the teeth. When teeth are not available, children can be aged based on which growth plates are sealed. The tibia plate seals around age 16 or 17 in girls and around 18 or 19 in boys. The clavicle is the last bone to complete growth and the plate <b>is</b> <b>sealed</b> around age 25. In addition, if a complete skeleton is available anthropologists can count the number of bones. While adults have 206 bones, the bones of a child have not yet fused resulting in a much higher number.|$|E
5|$|A chorus greets {{the dawn}} as Ariadne, after a troubled night's sleep, {{returns to the}} shore with her companion, Dorilla, to find that Theseus has departed. Dorilla offers her comfort. In despair {{at the thought that}} Theseus will not return, Ariadne {{nevertheless}} decides to go to the landing area to wait for him. In a pastoral interlude a chorus sings of the joys of rural life, and expresses the hope that Theseus will not forget Ariadne. Primed by an envoy with the news that Ariadne is alone and sorrowing, the chorus again sings in sympathy with her. On the beach, Ariadne sings her lament for her lost love and prepares to kill herself. At this point fanfares are heard heralding an arrival, causing Ariadne to hope that it is Theseus returning. In another interlude the chorus empathises, but a second envoy announces that it is Bacchus who has arrived, having taken pity on Ariadne. A sung ballo celebrates the anticipated betrothal of Bacchus and Ariadne. In the final scene Cupid reappears, and Venus rises from the sea before Jupiter speaks his blessing from the heavens. The union <b>is</b> <b>sealed</b> as Bacchus promises Ariadne immortality in heaven, and a crown of stars.|$|E
5|$|A year of {{wandering}} later, {{the dark}} energy {{has begun to}} affect other countries in Fa'Diel. Keldric discovers in Jadd that Ritzia plans to release the Mavolian energy to cover the whole world. He and Faye journey back to Illusia, only to discover Ritzia seemingly possessed and {{saying that it is}} their destiny to rule the world. After she runs away, Keldric meets a masked stranger who tells him that he was the one to close the portal centuries ago, sealing up the Maiden who had opened it, Anise, inside. He also reveals that Stroud is Keldric's older brother. When Keldric and Faye reach the portal, they find Stroud and Ritzia fighting. Stroud is trying to prevent Ritzia, possessed by Anise, from destroying the world, but is being mutated by the dark energy. Keldric defeats the mutated Stroud, and then fights Ritzia. Realizing {{that the only way to}} close the portal is to defeat Anise, he is forced to kill Ritzia along with her. The spirits of Ritzia and Faye then merge with the Tree of Mana, the portal <b>is</b> <b>sealed,</b> and Illusia is restored.|$|E

25|$|In the LDS Church today, {{both men}} and women may enter a {{celestial}} marriage with only one living partner at a time. A man may <b>be</b> <b>sealed</b> to more than one woman. If his wife dies, he may enter another celestial marriage, and <b>be</b> <b>sealed</b> to both his living wife and deceased wife or wives. Many Mormons believe that all these marriages will be valid in the eternities and the husband will live together in the celestial kingdom as a family with all to whom he <b>was</b> <b>sealed.</b> In 1998, the LDS Church changed the policy and now also allows women to <b>be</b> <b>sealed</b> to more than one man. A woman, however, may not <b>be</b> <b>sealed</b> to more than one man at a time while she is alive. She may only <b>be</b> <b>sealed</b> to subsequent partners after she has died. Proxy sealings, like proxy baptisms, are merely offered to the person in the afterlife. According to church teachings, the celestial marriage covenant, as with other covenants, requires the continued righteousness of the couple to remain in effect after this life. If only one remains righteous that person is promised a righteous eternal companion in eternity.|$|R
5|$|An ice core is a {{vertical}} column through a glacier, sampling the layers that formed through an annual cycle of snowfall and melt. As snow accumulates, each layer presses on lower layers, making them denser until they turn into firn. Firn is not dense {{enough to prevent}} air from escaping; but at a density of about 830kg/m3 it turns to ice, and the air within <b>is</b> <b>sealed</b> into bubbles that capture {{the composition of the}} atmosphere at the time the ice formed. The depth at which this occurs varies with location, but in Greenland and the Antarctic it ranges from 64m to 115m. Because the rate of snowfall varies from site to site, the age of the firn when it turns to ice varies a great deal. At Summit Camp in Greenland, the depth is 77 m and the ice is 230 years old; at Dome C in Antarctica the depth is 95 m and the age 2500 years. As further layers build up, the pressure increases, and at about 1500m the crystal structure of the ice changes from hexagonal to cubic, allowing air molecules to move into the cubic crystals and form a clathrate. The bubbles disappear and the ice becomes more transparent.|$|E
5|$|As with {{previous}} Valkyira Chronicles games, Valkyria Chronicles III is a tactical role-playing game where players {{take control of}} a military unit and take part in missions against enemy forces. Stories are told through comic book-like panels with animated character portraits, with characters speaking partially through voiced speech bubbles and partially through unvoiced text. The player progresses {{through a series of}} linear missions, gradually unlocked as maps that can be freely scanned through and replayed as they are unlocked. The route to each story location on the map varies depending on an individual player's approach: when one option is selected, the other <b>is</b> <b>sealed</b> off to the player. Outside missions, the player characters rest in a camp, where units can be customized and character growth occurs. Alongside the main story missions are character-specific sub missions relating to different squad members. After the game's completion, additional episodes are unlocked, some of them having a higher difficulty than those found {{in the rest of the}} game. There are also love simulation elements related to the game's two main heroines, although they take a very minor role.|$|E
5|$|During the conflict, it is {{revealed}} that Tobi is Obito Uchiha, a former teammate of Kakashi's who {{was thought to}} be dead. The real Madara saved Tobi's life, and they have since collaborated. As Sasuke learns the history of Konoha, including the circumstances that led to his clan's downfall, he decides to protect the village and rejoins Naruto and Sakura to thwart Madara and Obito's plans. However, Madara's body ends up possessed by Kaguya ≈åtsutsuki, an ancient princess who intends to subdue all humanity. A reformed Obito sacrifices himself to help Team 7 stop her. Once Kaguya <b>is</b> <b>sealed,</b> Madara dies as well. Sasuke takes advantage of the situation and takes control of all the Tailed Beasts, as he reveals his goal of ending the current village system. Naruto confronts Sasuke to dissuade him from his plan, and after they almost kill each other in a final battle, Sasuke admits defeat and reforms. After the war, Kakashi becomes the Sixth Hokage and pardons Sasuke for his crimes. Years later, Kakashi steps down while Naruto marries Hinata Hyuga and becomes the Seventh Hokage, raising the next generation.|$|E

5|$|Jack survives {{and finds}} himself on Devil's Reef, where he discovers old {{smuggling}} tunnels beneath the seabed, leading {{him to the}} underwater city of Y'ha-nthlei. The city {{is found to be}} located below Devil's Reef and is the home of the Deep Ones and members of the Order. U.S. Navy submarines attempt to torpedo Y'ha-nthlei, but are stopped by a magical barrier protecting the city. The Temple of Dagon {{is the source of the}} barrier, but the entrance <b>is</b> <b>sealed</b> off to prevent any interference. Jack finds another way in through ancient tunnels feared by the Deep Ones at the bottom of the city's foundations. Apparently, this passage, which leads to the temple, is an ancient prison for flying polyps, the enemy of the Great Race of Yith. Jack manages to defeat them with the help of a Yithian energy weapon. Jack then enters the Temple of Dagon and kills Mother Hydra - whose song is generating the barrier - by deafening himself to her song, allowing him to take control of Deep Ones. With the barrier down, the submarines attack the city, while Jack escapes through a portal leading back to the Order's headquarters and collapses in front of Hoover and Mackey.|$|E
5|$|Later, Kate {{appears as}} part of Batman and Robin: Blackest Knight. Batwoman is kidnapped by cultists and taken to London in order for her to once again be sacrificed. She <b>is</b> <b>sealed</b> within a coffin and taken {{underground}} to the last remaining Lazarus Pit {{in order for the}} ritual to begin. She is saved by the timely intervention of Dick Grayson and British superheroes Knight and Squire. After learning that Grayson plans on placing Bruce Wayne's corpse into the pit in order to revive him, Kate strongly protests, but he simply ignores her. True to Kate's warnings, Bruce (in reality an insane clone created by Darkseid) emerges from the Pit and attacks the heroes. As the battle takes place, the cultists who kidnapped Kate detonate explosives surrounding the Pit, causing a massive cave-in. Grayson discovers Kate, buried alive and with extensive injury to her spine and legs, and tries to help her. Kate is healed after being placed inside the Pit, and she returns to Gotham with the others. Before leaving to return to her home, Grayson flirts with Kate by telling her that he has a thing for red-haired crime-fighters (a reference to his previous love interests, Barbara Gordon and Starfire), apparently unaware of Kate's sexuality.|$|E
