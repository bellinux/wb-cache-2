40|$|Exploration of {{extraterrestrial}} surfaces (e. g. moon, Mars, asteroid) {{will require}} durable space mechanisms that will survive potentially dusty surface conditions {{in addition to}} the hard vacuum and extreme temperatures of space. Baseline tests with lunar simulant were recently completed at NASA GRC on a new Low-Temperature Mechanism (LTM) <b>dust</b> <b>seal</b> for space actuator application. Following are top-level findings of the tests completed to date in vacuum using NU-LHT- 2 M lunar-highlands simulant. A complete set of findings are found in the conclusions section. Tests were run at approximately 10 - 7 torr with unidirectional rotational speed of 39 RPM. Initial break-in runs were performed at atmospheric conditions with no simulant. During the break-in runs, the maximum torque observed was 16. 7 lbf-in. while the maximum seal outer diameter temperature was 103 F. Only 0. 4 milligrams of NU-LHT- 2 M simulant passed through the sealshaft interface in the first 511, 000 cycles while under vacuum despite a chip on the secondary sealing surface. Approximately 650, 000 of a planned 1, 000, 000 cycles were completed in vacuum with NU-LHT- 2 M simulant. Upon test disassembly NU-LHT- 2 M was found on the secondary sealing surface...|$|E

40|$|Mission {{architectures}} {{for human}} {{exploration of the}} lunar surface continue to advance {{as well as the}} definitions of capability needs, best practices and engineering design to mitigate the impact of lunar dust on exposed systems. The NASA DMP has been established as the agency focal point for dust characterization, technology, and simulant development. As described in this paper, the DMP has defined a process for selecting and justifying its R&T portfolio. The technology prioritization process, which is based on a ranking system according to weighted criteria, has been successfully applied to the current DMP dust mitigation technology portfolio. Several key findings emerged from this assessment. Within the dust removal and cleaning technologies group, there are critical technical challenges that must be overcome for these technologies to be implemented for lunar applications. For example, an in-situ source of CO 2 on the moon is essential to the CO 2 shower technology. Also, significant development effort is required to achieve technology readiness level TRL 6 for the electrostatic cleaning system for removal of particles smaller than 50 pm. The baseline materials related technologies require considerable development just to achieve TRL 6. It is also a nontrivial effort to integrate the materials in hardware for lunar application. At present, there are no terrestrial applications that are readily adaptable to lunar surface applications nor are there any obvious leading candidates. The unique requirements of <b>dust</b> <b>sealing</b> systems for lunar applications suggest an extensive development effort will be necessary to mature <b>dust</b> <b>sealing</b> systems to TRL 6 and beyond. As discussed here, several alternate materials and technologies have achieved high levels of maturity for terrestrial applications and warrant due diligence in ongoing assessment of the technology portfolio. The present assessment is the initial step in an ongoing effort to continually evaluate the DMP technology portfolio and external non-NASA relevant technology developments efforts to maintain an optimal investment profile. At the same time, there is an ongoing review of agency-wide dust-related R&T activities. The results of these ongoing assessments will be reported in future publications...|$|R
40|$|The development, performance, {{and test}} {{results for the}} {{spaceborne}} magnetic tape transport are discussed. An analytical model of the tape transport was used to optimize its conceptual design. Each of the subsystems was subjected to reliability analyses which included structural integrity, maintenance of system performance within acceptable bounds, and avoidance of fatigue failure. These subsystems were also compared {{with each other in}} order to evaluate reliability characteristics. The transport uses no mechanical couplings. Four drive motors, one for each reel and one for each of two capstans, are used in a differential mode. There are two hybrid, spherical, cone tapered-crown rollers for tape guidance. Storage of the magnetic tape is provided by a reel assembly which includes the reel, a reel support structure and bearings, <b>dust</b> <b>seals,</b> and a dc drive motor. A summary of transport test results on tape guidance, flutter, and skew is provided...|$|R
50|$|Compact {{digital cameras}} are fitted with fixed lenses, {{which makes it}} harder for dust to get into the image area. Similar film cameras are often only {{light-tight}} and not environmentally sealed.

40|$|The {{merger of}} General Motors Australia and Holden Motor Body Builders in 1931 not only {{established}} Australia&# 039;s leading automotive company it formalised Automotive Design in this country. This paper, {{for the first}} time, will examine and disclose the initial 30 years of Automotive design at GM-H and expose the original designers, their origins and achievements. Initially located in Adelaide from 1923, Holden&# 039;s design section produced unique body styles, like the streamline styled All-Enclosed Coupé and provided solutions not only for <b>dust</b> <b>sealing,</b> ventilation and motor body strength but solved complex engineering problems with innovative design during WWII. The initial designers were trained internally by one man, Bert Wylie, who understood that good body design lay in precise drawings and not a chalk board. The team he built, with American input, applied considerable knowledge and expertise to ensure the Holden car, when released in 1948, was exactly what the Australian market wanted. Design at GM-H evolved from American practice through a small team who were provided {{the opportunity to be}} innovative and progressive. This paper explores the emergence of the Holden design team and their place in the general design sphere. The paper will argue that by the mid- 1940 s the GM-H design group were capable of producing a complete Australian car and that this expertise elevated the Holden design team to a position of respect within the GM Corporation...|$|R
5000|$|The {{camera was}} {{announced}} on August 29, 2006 with a [...] "teaser" [...] advertising campaign and was unveiled at the photokina trade show in Cologne, Germany on 2006-09-26. After production delays, Sigma announced the official {{release of the}} SD14 to be on March 6, 2007. Sigma has released sample images on their website. Contrary to most consumer cameras, which use color sensors based on a Bayer color array, the SD14 uses a Foveon X3 sensor. Also peculiar {{is the fact that}} the infrared filter is on the lens mount and doubles as a <b>dust</b> protector, <b>sealing</b> the mirror and sensor compartment, and can be removed easily, to allow infrared photography.|$|R

It also has a [...] "hold-open" [...] bolt catch which holds the bolt open after the last round in the magazine has been fired (the bolt release button is just above the magazine release) and has a spring-loaded <b>dust</b> cover that <b>seals</b> the ejection port from debris.|$|R
40|$|Marine biofouling, insect {{adhesion}} on aircraft surfaces, {{microbial contamination}} of sterile environments, and particle contamination all present unique challenges for which researchers have adopted {{an array of}} mitigation strategies. Particulate contamination is of interest to NASA regarding exploration of the Moon, Mars, asteroids, etc. 1 Lunar <b>dust</b> compromised <b>seals,</b> clogged filters, abraded visors and space suit surfaces, and was a significant health concern during the Apollo missions. 2 Consequently, NASA has instituted a multi-faceted approach to address dust including use of sacrificial surfaces, active mitigation requiring {{the use of an}} external energy source, and passive mitigation utilizing materials with an intrinsic resistance to surface contamination. One passive mitigation strategy is modification of a material s surface energy either chemically or topographically. The focus of this paper is the synthesis and evaluation of novel copolyimide materials with surface modifying agents (SMA, oxetanes) enabling controlled variation of surface chemical composition...|$|R
5000|$|As {{expected}} {{of a professional}} camera at the time, the LX provides mechanical shutter speeds, ranging from the flash synchronization ('X') speed of 1/75 second to 1/2000 second and bulb ('B'), permitting manual operation without battery power. The slow speeds from 1/60 second to 4 seconds, {{as well as the}} exposure meter, are battery dependent. Construction is strong and durable, with a solid cast metal frame and metal covering plates. All buttons and dials are weather and <b>dust</b> <b>sealed,</b> a unique feature not found on other professional cameras of the day. Underneath the satin black finish is black chrome, so that even as the surface finish inevitably wore through in hard professional use, the underlying metal would not look brassy. Both the viewfinder and the focusing screen are interchangeable to suit the task at hand, a large choice of alternatives were available. The camera has a somewhat uncommon frame counter, being able {{to keep track of the}} frame number in either direction, whether advancing or rewinding the film; this feature dramatically adds to the flexibility of the camera, as well as aids in multiple exposures. The camera has a multi-function lever that supports mirror lock-up, self-timer and depth of field preview. Both a winder and motor drive were available, and a full complement of other professional accessories. Many additional features could be found inside the camera, the [...] "Magic-Needles" [...] ringed the film take-up spool. Found on M-series bodies, it was included in the LX to make loading a quick task. The shutter curtains are made of a Titanium foil composite and a small thumb operated dial sit to the side of the film plane to operate a mask that could be deployed for use with the time data back when installed in place of the standard back. As stated about the mask for data back, Pentax offered two types. The time stamp version that included a wristwatch style component that was inserted in the back and projected on to the deployed mask. The other data back was a three digit type that could project dates or useful information on to the film. Also taking advantage of the removable back was a high capacity magazine allowing for 250 exposures.|$|R
500|$|The 1906 Grand Prix de l'Automobile Club de France, {{commonly}} known as the 1906 French Grand Prix, was a motor race held on 26 and 27 June 1906, on closed public roads outside the city of Le Mans. The Grand Prix was organised by the Automobile Club de France (ACF) at the prompting of the French automobile industry {{as an alternative to the}} Gordon Bennett races, which limited each competing country's number of entries regardless of the size of its industry. France had the largest automobile industry in Europe at the time, and in an attempt to better reflect this the Grand Prix had no limit to the number of entries by any particular country.

50|$|To prevent {{water and}} dirt from {{damaging}} the suspension, gaiters {{have been used}} to cover the fork's stanchions. However even when properly sealing the stanchions and sliders, the gaiters have to have small openings in them to allow air to move {{in and out of the}} cavity between gaiter and stanchion as the fork moves through its travel. Some water and grit may find its way in through these holes, staying trapped inside and accumulating over time. Since modern <b>dust</b> wipers and <b>seals</b> keep out water and dirt adequately enough by themselves, and since gaiter-less stanchions are generally regarded as more aesthetically pleasing, gaiters have fallen out of favor.|$|R
30|$|Roadsides have {{significantly}} higher SOC, {{which can be}} explained by the following. First, soils in roadsides are seldom disturbed, while other land uses undergo transformations and replacement of vegetation by structures or other vegetation, which depletes SOC. Second, atmospheric deposition from vehicles and high accumulation of <b>dust</b> from nearby <b>sealed</b> surfaces result in increased nutrient content in roadsides (Chon et al. [1998]; Park et al. [2010]; Li et al. [2013]). Third, street litter and animal waste in roadsides may also lead to SOC accumulation (Park et al. [2010]; Zhao et al. [2013]). Similar to SOC, the highest C/N is found in roadsides followed by industrial areas. However, soil TN shows no statistical difference (P[*]=[*] 0.052) between seven land-use types.|$|R
40|$|Ultra-low doses and dose- {{rates of}} {{ionizing}} radiation {{are effective in}} preventing disease which suggests that they also may be effective in treating disease. Limited experimental and anecdotal evidence indicates that low radiation doses from radon in mines and spas, thorium-bearing monazite sands and enhanced radioactive uranium ore obtained from a natural geological reactor {{may be useful in}} treating many inflammatory conditions and proliferative disorders, including cancer. Optimal therapeutic applications were identified via a literature survey as dose-rates ranging from 7 to 11 µGy/hr or 28 to 44 times world average background rates. Rocks from an abandoned uranium mine in Utah were con-sidered for therapeutic application and were examined by γ-ray and laser-induced break-down fluorescence spectroscopy. The rocks showed the presence of transuranics and fis-sion products with a γ-ray energy profile similar to aged spent uranium nuclear fuel (93 % dose due to β particles and 7 % due to γ rays). Mud packs of pulverized uranium ore rock <b>dust</b> in <b>sealed</b> plastic bags delivering bag surface β,γ dose-rates of 10 - 450 µGy/h were used with apparent success to treat several inflammatory and proliferative conditions in humans...|$|R
40|$|Cassava (Manihot spp.) tubers form a major {{food source}} of {{carbohydrates}} and other food nutrients for tropical dwellers. The tubers also are sources of industrial {{products such as}} dextrins, glues, ethyl alcohol, acetone and glucose etc. Post -harvest losses on storage of cassava root tubers are large because of their poor storage qualities. In this study, wholesome cassava tubers were washed and disinfected for used to study the storage and spoilage of cassava tubers using moist saw <b>dust</b> in <b>sealed</b> boxes and some exposed as control. Profuse microbial growths occurred {{on the surface of}} tubers exposed on the 4 th day and were completely soften due to fermentation of the tissues on the 7 th day. Bacteria isolated from the tubers were species of Staphylococcus, Bacillus and Diplococcus. Fungal species isolated using cultural characteristics were Candida and Aspergillus. Tubers on moist sawdust had no microbial growth but developed secondary roots on the 3 rd day of storage. They could be stored up to 3 weeks. The sawdust acted as soil for the tubers while the different gases and heat evolved by the tubers in the sealed boxes had a curing effect on the tubers. The study hence recommends that storage of cassava tubers in moist saw-dust would provide effective preservative method against post-harvest losses...|$|R
5000|$|During a {{foraging}} period, {{they will}} stop and dig a [...] "V" [...] shaped trench with their forefeet and then sniff it profusely {{as a means}} to explore their location. When a concentration of ants or termites is detected, the aardvark digs into it with its powerful front legs, keeping its long ears upright to listen for predators, and takes up an astonishing number of insects with its long, sticky tongue—as many as 50,000 in one night have been recorded. Its claws enable it to dig through the extremely hard crust of a termite or ant mound quickly. It avoids inhaling the <b>dust</b> by <b>sealing</b> the nostrils. When successful, the aardvark's long (up to 30 cm) tongue licks up the insects; the termites' biting, or the ants' stinging attacks are rendered futile by the tough skin. After an aardvark visit at a termite mound, other animals will visit to pick up all the leftovers. Termite mounds alone don't provide enough food for the aardvark, so they look for termites that are on the move. When these insects move, they can form columns 10 - 40 m long and these tend to provide easy pickings with little effort exerted by the aardvark. These columns are more common in areas of livestock or other hoofed animals. The trampled grass and dung attract termites from Odontotermes, Microtermes, and Pseudacanthotermes genera.|$|R
5000|$|Sealed {{ball joints}} {{do not require}} {{lubrication}} as they are [...] "lubed for life". Formerly most ball joints had grease fitting (sometimes called a grease zerk) and were designed for periodic addition of a lubricant, however almost all modern cars use sealed ball joints to minimise maintenance requirements. The lubricant was usually a very high-viscosity lubricant. It is commonly believed that standard ball joints will outlive sealed ones because eventually the seal will break, causing the joint to dry out and rust. [...] Additionally, the act of adding new lubricant pushes out old and dry lubricant, extending {{the life of the}} joint. This was supposed to be done at intervals of 1000 to 2000 miles on many vehicles, which is incompatible with the service interval on modern cars, often 12000 miles or more, and in any case was rarely attended to by owners, resulting in severe wear and possible ball joint failure, which can result in serious accidents. For this reason, almost all ball joints on modern European or Far Eastern cars are the sealed for life type. New technology especially applied to the internal bearing design has allowed ball joints to meet these longer service intervals. The special design's incorporate sintered metal bearings which replace OEM sealed polymer/plastic version and improved <b>dust</b> boot <b>seal's</b> that work much better at retaining the grease.|$|R

40|$|We {{investigate}} the thermal evolution of comet 67 P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko's subsurface in the Seth_ 01 region, where active pits {{have been observed}} by the ESA/Rosetta mission. Our simulations show that clathrate destabilization and amorphous ice crystallization can occur at depths corresponding {{to those of the}} observed pits in a timescale shorter than 67 P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko's lifetime in the comet's activity zone in the inner solar system. Sublimation of crystalline ice down to such depths is possible only {{in the absence of a}} dust mantle, which requires the presence of dust grains in the matrix small enough to be dragged out by gas from the pores. Our results are consistent with both pits formation via sinkholes or subsequent to outbursts, the dominant process depending on the status of the subsurface porosity. A <b>sealed</b> <b>dust</b> mantle would favor episodic and disruptive outgassing as a result of increasing gas pressure in the pores, while high porosity should allow the formation of large voids in the subsurface due to the continuous escape of volatiles.

40|$|Creating a {{habitable}} {{environment is}} a complex process involving {{a wide variety of}} interacting processes. A prerequisite for any biological activity is an energy source. The terrestrial example of the black smokers shows how efficient geothermal processes are as an energy source. There is ample morphological evidence for continuous and episodic volcanic activity over the geological history of Mars. The youngest ages determined by the crater sizefrequency measurements are about 2 Ma suggesting that the volcanoes are potentially still active today. While there is no direct evidence for volcanic activity the likelihood for localized hot spot activity or hydrothermal systems is very high. We have shown recently using thermo-physical modeling that a morphologically identified glacial deposit on the northwestern flanks of Hecates Tholus contains very likely still a stagnant ice core. There are several units on Mars, especially on flanks of volcanic edifices, which based on morphological evidence may be glacial deposits and which are possibly still ice-cored. Combining these two findings provides an interesting option for a biological niche. Our modeling shows that variations in the climate and in the local internal heat flow due to ongoing volcanic activity can create a complex internal structure of these ice deposits. The ice deposits can effectively store volcanic gases. The enrichment of water ice with volcanic gases might form a nutrient rich environment which is protected by a <b>dust</b> cover and <b>sealed</b> by an enrichment of ice at the top. The implications for biological activity in these places deserve further attention...|$|R
