This can be provided by banks of switched capacitors or by synchronous condensers, or if a suitable power generating station is located close to the static inverter plant, the generators in the power station.

5000|$|Valve {{amplifier}} circuits {{are significantly}} different from broadband solid state circuits. Solid state devices have a very low output impedance which allows matching via a broadband transformer covering a large range of frequencies, for example 1.8 to 30 MHz. With either class C or AB operation, these must include low pass filters to remove harmonics. While the proper low pass filter must be switch selected for the frequency range of interest, the result {{is considered to be}} a [...] "no tune" [...] design.

50|$|In 1997, after {{inauguration of}} the second 380 kV-powerline to Czech, which ends at Prestice substation, most {{external}} components of GKK Etzenricht were dismantled and stored on {{the area of the}} facility. Since beginning of this dismantling, the facility was not workable any more. Only the transformers, the smoothing reactor and one <b>harmonic</b> <b>filter</b> remained on their original sites. Since shutdown of the static inverter, it was planned to sell the installation to eastern Europe, where it would have allowed the construction of an HVDC back-to-back station for exchanging power between eastern Europe and the former Soviet Union. As the static inverter went more and more out of date and one was meanwhile able to build static inverters like that of GKK Etzenricht much simpler by using photo thyristors, no such deal ever took place. In 2006 the facility was sold to IDPC, an Austrian recycling company, which wanted first to sell the installation completely and as this did not work, part by part. However, only a few components were sold. In spring 2009 all remaining components of GKK Etzenricht were dismantled and scrapped.|$|E

The shunt <b>harmonic</b> <b>filter's</b> control objective is defined as: balance the phase angle of the input current with the phase angle of the line frequency component of the load current. This objective is achieved in digital implementation without sensing the input voltages. The controller uses a phase-shifting method on the sensed input current and then applies the resistor-emulator-type input-current-shaping strategy on the phase-shifted current. In implementation, Texas Instrument's digital-signal-processor-based unit TMS 320 F 240 EVM is used as the digital hardware platform.

40|$|The {{condition}} {{monitoring of the}} passive 12 th and 24 th <b>harmonic</b> <b>filters</b> in the DC sub station employing 12 pulse passive rectification plays the vital role of suppressing generated harmonics. The railway service of South Africa (Transnet) is confronted {{by the introduction of}} complex loads the sub stations was never designed for. In recent years the suppression of harmonics has become increasingly important due to penalties incurred from the energy supplier and the influence harmonics has on sensitive equipment supplied from the same grid. The {{condition monitoring}} of <b>harmonic</b> <b>filters</b> can thus be used to control harmonic energy. Due to the fact that these filters are passive they have to be monitored to ensure efficiency. The efficiency of the filter is dependant on the filter components being within specification to ensure accurate attenuation of generated harmonics. The investigation of the document aims to address the condition monitoring of the passive filter components for various operating conditions to establish whether these components are still operating in an efficient manner. In the short term the proper functioning of the <b>harmonic</b> <b>filters</b> will reduce power factor quality penalties and in the long term the life expectancy of systems supplied by the DC grid will be prolonged.
