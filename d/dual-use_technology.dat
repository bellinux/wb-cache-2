25|$|Since {{this path}} was chosen, the United States was, {{in its early}} days, {{essentially}} an advocate {{for the prevention of}} nuclear proliferation, though primarily for the reason of self-preservation. A few years after the USSR detonated its first weapon in 1949, though, the U.S. under President Dwight D. Eisenhower sought to encourage a program of sharing nuclear information related to civilian nuclear power and nuclear physics in general. The Atoms for Peace program, begun in 1953, was also in part political: the U.S. was better poised to commit various scarce resources, such as enriched uranium, towards this peaceful effort, and to request a similar contribution from the Soviet Union, who had far fewer resources along these lines; thus the program had a strategic justification as well, as was later revealed by internal memos. This overall goal of promoting civilian use of nuclear energy in other countries, while also preventing weapons dissemination, has been labeled by many critics as contradictory and having led to lax standards for a number of decades which allowed a number of other nations, such as China and India, to profit from <b>dual-use</b> <b>technology</b> (purchased from nations other than the U.S.).|$|E

40|$|This {{paper will}} discuss <b>dual-use</b> <b>technologies</b> {{with a focus}} on {{practices}} and trends relevant for international security, through a three-steps approach. In the first chapter, the lack of unambiguous definition for <b>dual-use</b> <b>technologies</b> will be addressed, first in relation to international sanctions and then with regard to the tension between EU institutions and Union's Member States over integration in the defence and security field. In the second chapter, the European investments in <b>dual-use</b> <b>technologies</b> will be considered by focusing on three aspects. First, the complex portfolio of funding for dual use, whereby several institutional actors are involved with overlapping competencies, different agendas and little cooperation. Second, the relation between dual-use and the capabilities for EU external action, particularly regarding Common Security and Defence Policy (CSDP) and civil-military cooperation. Third, the governance issue, with a specific focus on the roles of both European Commission (EC) and European Defence Agency (EDA). The last chapter of this paper will discuss <b>dual-use</b> <b>technologies</b> and the EU export control system, with a view to the ongoing review of the latter. Finally, the conclusions will underline as dual-use lies somehow at the crossroads among technological innovation, international regulation, EU governance, and the way security challenges are addressed by European actors...|$|R

At no point, however, did the U.S. directly supply arms to Iraq.

2500|$|Iraq {{quickly found}} itself {{bogged down in}} one of the longest and most {{destructive}} wars of attrition of the 20th century. During the war, Iraq used chemical weapons against Iranian forces fighting on the southern front and Kurdish separatists who were attempting to open up a northern front in Iraq with the help of Iran. These chemical weapons were developed by Iraq from materials and technology supplied primarily by West German companies as well as using <b>dual-use</b> <b>technology</b> imported following the Reagan administration's lifting of export restrictions. The United States also supplied Iraq with [...] "satellite photos showing Iranian deployments". In a US bid to open full diplomatic relations with Iraq, the country was removed from the US list of State Sponsors of Terrorism. Ostensibly, this was because of improvement in the regime's record, although former United States Assistant Secretary of Defense Noel Koch later stated, [...] "No one had any doubts about [...] continued involvement in terrorism ... The real reason was to help them succeed in the war against Iran." [...] The Soviet Union, France, and China together accounted for over 90% of the value of Iraq's arms imports between 1980 and 1988.|$|E
2500|$|In February 1982, Iraq {{was removed}} from the State Department's list of State Sponsors of Terrorism to ease the {{transfer}} of <b>dual-use</b> <b>technology</b> to that country.

[...] "I was not consulted," [...] Haig is said to have complained. In March, President Reagan signed National Security Study Memorandum (NSSM) 4-82—seeking [...] "a review of U.S. policy toward the Middle East"—and in June Reagan signed a National Security Decision Directive (NSDD) co-written by NSC official Howard Teicher, which determined: [...] "The United States could not afford to allow Iraq to lose the war to Iran." [...] Pursuant to this Directive, Thomas Twetten arrived in Baghdad on July 27 to share CIA satellite imagery on Iranian troop movements with the Iraqi Mukhabarat. This was [...] "the first U.S. provision of intelligence to Iraq," [...] and sparked a short-lived debate over whether Iraq would tolerate a CIA presence in the country: Mukhabarat head Barzan Tikriti told Twetton to [...] "get the hell out of Iraq," [...] but Iraqi military intelligence—"having already drooled over it and having said repeatedly how valuable it was"—subsequently informed Twetton [...] "we'll continue to look at your information, and we'll assess whether it is of use to us in any way." [...] Reports of Iraq's use of chemical weapons against Iran reached the CIA as early as 1983, but the U.S. took no action to restrain Iraq's violations of international law, failing even to alert the UN. In late 1983, Reagan selected Donald Rumsfeld as his envoy to the Middle East; Rumsfeld met Saddam in Baghdad in December 1983 and March 1984.

40|$|The term <b>dual-use</b> characterizes <b>technologies</b> {{that can}} have both {{military}} and civilian applications. What {{is the state of}} current efforts to control the spread of these powerful technologies—nuclear, biological, cyber—that can simultaneously advance social and economic well-being and also be harnessed for hostile purposes? What have previous efforts to govern, for example, nuclear and biological weapons taught us about the potential for the control of these <b>dual-use</b> <b>technologies?</b> What are the implications for governance when the range of actors who could cause harm with these technologies include not just national governments but also non-state actors like terrorists? These are some of the questions addressed by Governance of Dual-Use Technologies: Theory and Practice, the new publication released today by the Global Nuclear Future Initiative of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences. The publication's editor is Elisa D. Harris, Senior Research Scholar, Center for International Security Studies, University of Maryland School of Public Affairs. Governance of <b>Dual-Use</b> <b>Technologies</b> examines the similarities and differences between the strategies used for the control of nuclear technologies and those proposed for biotechnology and information technology. The publication makes clear the challenges concomitant with dual-use governance. For example, general agreement exists internationally on the need to restrict access to technologies enabling the development of nuclear weapons. However, no similar consensus exists in the bio and information technology domains. The publication also explores the limitations of military measures like deterrence, defense, and reprisal in preventing globally available biological and information technologies from being misused. Some of the other questions explored by the publication include: What types of governance measures for these <b>dual-use</b> <b>technologies</b> have already been adopted? What objectives have those measures sought to achieve? How have the technical characteristics of the technology affected governance prospects? What have been the primary obstacles to effective governance, and what gaps exist in the current governance regime? Are further governance measures feasible?
