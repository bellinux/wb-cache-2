[...] Archer replied, [...] "Well, I am not glad to see you by a damn sight!" ...|$|E
500|$|When Henriksen {{first got}} the script, he mistook {{it for a}} film because of its [...] "powerful" [...] story. He was not fond {{of the idea of}} {{participating}} in a television project. Henriksen contacted Carter about the character; his first question was [...] "How {{are you going to make}} this hero a hero? I mean, it is so dark, <b>how</b> <b>are</b> <b>you</b> going to handle this?" [...] Carter replied saying that Frank was a hero because he was able to [...] "stand-up" [...] against all of this. Henriksen was also worried about the dark [...] "feel" [...] of the show, saying that all shows needs some glimpse of light at the end of the tunnel. According to Carter [...] "The yellow house" [...] was the light, which Henriksen later agreed upon.|$|E
500|$|... "Cocktails" [...] {{was written}} by Paul Lieberstein, who plays Human Resources {{representative}} Toby Flenderson on the series. Lost series creator J. J. Abrams was hired on as episode director, his first such credit for the series. Abrams disliked the American series when it first premiered, due to his love for the original British series. The director explained, [...] "I resented it before I saw it, because I thought, 'well, <b>how</b> <b>are</b> <b>you</b> {{going to do what}} Ricky and Steve did. In fact, the first season I didn't get into it at all. In the second season, they really found their voice. And that's despite having to make 22 episodes, which is twice the length of what the BBC show did. And I thought that the show became brilliant. I was really impressed by how it worked." ...|$|E

500|$|The {{main source}} of the game's horror is Alma, a ghostly little girl. Craig Hubbard remarked that [...] "a guy in a mask chasing co-eds with a meat cleaver can be scary, but on some level you're {{thinking}} to yourself you could probably kick his ass if you got the drop on him...but when a spooky little girl takes out an entire Delta Force squad, <b>how</b> <b>are</b> <b>you</b> supposed to deal with that?" [...] While Alma {{has been compared to}} the character Samara from The Ring, Craig Hubbard stated that she [...] "... was born out of a tradition of eerie, faceless female ghosts ..." [...] and not [...] "... as an answer to any specific movie character." [...] Hubbard acknowledged that Alma [...] "... admittedly bears some visual resemblance to the ghosts in Dark Water or Séance", but [...] "... creepy little girls have been freaking [...] out since The Shining." [...] Developers Dave Matthews and Nathan Hendrickson say the name 'Alma' comes from the character Alma Mobley in Peter Straub's novel Ghost Story.|$|E
