Later, she sang in and directed a Slavic chorus while an undergraduate at Yale University. She and some friends traveled to Eastern Europe in 1989, specifically Bulgaria and Bosnia, to study local musical customs. The recordings they made will be deposited in the Library of Congress. While Kostova was in Europe, the Berlin Wall collapsed, heralding the fall of Communism in Eastern Europe, events which shaped <b>her</b> <b>understanding</b> <b>of</b> history.|$|E
5|$|In 1952 she met Nicholas Heron, {{with whom}} she entered into a relationship. An engraver, {{photographer}} and former journalist for the Brighton Argus, he shared her interest in the occult, and together they developed a magical system based upon Luciferianism, the veneration of the deity Lucifer, or Lumiel, whom they {{considered to be a}} benevolent angelic deity. In 1956, they founded the Order of the Morning Star, or Ordo Stella Matutina (OSM), propagating it through a correspondence course. The couple sent out lessons to those who paid the necessary fees over a series of weeks, eventually leading to the twelfth lesson, which contained The Book of Lumiel, a short work written by Montalban that documented <b>her</b> <b>understanding</b> <b>of</b> Lumiel, or Lucifer, and his involvement with humankind. The couple initially lived together in Torrington Place, London, from where they ran the course, but in 1961 moved to the coastal town of Southsea in Essex, where there was greater room for Heron's engraving equipment.|$|E

25|$|When {{first asked}} to {{distinguish}} between all, some, and one Genie would interpret some to mean all, but by 1975 she reversed this and began mistaking some for one, which Curtiss interpreted {{as a sign of}} progress. This contrasted with her distinction between more and less, which she had demonstrated by at least August 1973, and <b>her</b> <b>understanding</b> <b>of</b> the qualifiers one and all in everyday conversations. When learning relative terms such as large and small or narrow and wide she simultaneously learned both words in the pair, whereas most people acquire either the marked or the negative form first, and never mistakenly used one term in a pair to mean the other. Although she had difficulty with different pairs of relative and relational terms on tests, she showed significantly greater comprehension outside of test settings.|$|E
25|$|In February of 2017, then-National Security Advisor Michael Flynn named Fontes, a {{colleague}} from {{his tenure as}} Director of the Defense Intelligence Agency, {{to be the next}} senior director for India, Pakistan and Central Asian Affairs at United States National Security Council (NSC). Anonymous sources within the Government of India told The Telegraph that they were hopeful Fontes's appointment in the White House would help convey New Delhi's concerns. Senior officials familiar with Fontes commented upon <b>her</b> <b>understanding</b> <b>of</b> India's security concerns vis-à-vis China and Pakistan; that she would be a friendly face among a Trump Administration cabinet mostly unknown to India. With Flynn's subsequent ouster, Fontes's assignment to the NSC was cancelled and the position was filled by Lisa Curtis (a former CIA analyst and fellow at The Heritage Foundation) at the behest of Flynn's replacement, H.

25|$|Her second book, now {{the best}} known of her works, Out of Africa, was {{published}} in 1937. Its success firmly established her reputation. Having learned from her previous experience, Blixen published the book first in Denmark and the United Kingdom, and then in the United States. Garnering another Book-of-the-Month Club choice, Blixen was assured of not only sales for this new work, but also renewed interest in Seven Gothic Tales. She was awarded the Tagea Brandt Rejselegat (a Danish prize for women in the arts or academic life) in 1939. The work brought attention from critics who were concerned not only with literary appraisal of the book, but also with defining Blixen's intentions and morality. Post-colonial criticism has linked her with contemporary British writers and in some cases branded her as just another morally bankrupt white European aristocrat. Danish scholars have not typically made judgments about her morality, perhaps understanding that while elements of racism and colonial prejudices, given the context and era, are inherent in the work, her position as an outsider, a Dane and a woman made evaluating her, rather than the work, more complex. Some critics, including Carolyn Martin Shaw and Raoul Granqvist, have judged her to be a racist and a white supremacist, while other critics, such as Abdul R. JanMohamed, have recognized both her romanticized colonial attitudes and <b>her</b> <b>understanding</b> <b>of</b> colonial problems, as well as her concern and respect for African nationalists.|$|E
500|$|A May 1, 1917 {{review by}} The New York Times praised her natural talent, with some {{reservations}} about the unpolished quality of her voice.

Angelou mentioned none of this controversy in Singin' and Swingin', however.|$|E
