5|$|A {{metalloid}} is any {{chemical element}} which has properties in between those of metals and nonmetals, or {{that has a}} mixture of them. There is neither a standard definition of a metalloid nor complete agreement on the elements appropriately classified as such. Despite the lack of specificity, the term remains <b>in</b> <b>use</b> <b>in</b> the literature of chemistry.|$|E
5|$|About 1 in 20 meteorites {{consist of}} the unique iron-nickel {{minerals}} taenite (35–80% iron) and kamacite (90–95% iron). Although rare, iron meteorites are the main form of natural metallic iron on the Earth's surface. According to the International Resource Panel's Metal Stocks in Society report, the global stock of iron <b>in</b> <b>use</b> <b>in</b> society is 2200kg per capita. Much of this is in more-developed countries (7000–14000kg per capita) rather than less-developed countries (2000kg per capita).|$|E

5|$|Another modern {{development}} (<b>in</b> <b>use</b> <b>in</b> the Netherlands) is {{the creation}} of housing communities at the edges of wetlands with floating structures, restrained in position by vertical pylons. Such wetlands can then be used to accommodate runoff and surges without causing damage to the structures while also protecting conventional structures at somewhat higher low-lying elevations, provided that dikes prevent major surge intrusion.|$|E
5|$|Artificial trees made of goose {{feathers}} were <b>in</b> <b>use</b> <b>in</b> American homes {{since the}} 1880s. In the 1930s, however, The Addis Brush Company, an American toilet bowl brush manufacturer, began making artificial trees of green-dyed bristles and then supplied the British (who suffered {{a dearth of}} wild trees) with thousands of artificial trees in the post-War years. Americans took {{little interest in the}} Addis artificial trees and remained loyal to real trees.|$|E

50|$|Besides Serbian, {{which is}} the {{official}} language in the whole country, there are five regional languages <b>in</b> the official <b>use</b> by the provincial administration in Vojvodina: Hungarian, Romanian, Slovak, Rusyn, and Croatian. The Serbian language is <b>used</b> <b>in</b> all municipality governments, while minority languages are <b>used</b> <b>in</b> selected municipality governments. The Serbian language with Cyrillic script is <b>in</b> official <b>use</b> <b>in</b> all 45 municipalities of Vojvodina, while Serbian Latin script is <b>in</b> official <b>use</b> <b>in</b> only 23 of 45 municipalities. The Hungarian language is <b>in</b> official <b>use</b> <b>in</b> 29 municipalities, Slovak in 12, Romanian in 9, Rusyn in 6, and Croatian and Czech in 1 municipality each (however, the Czech language is not official at provincial level).|$|R
5|$|At {{the start}} of the 13th century, a {{primitive}} form of milling the silk threads was already <b>in</b> <b>use.</b> <b>In</b> 1221 Jean de Garlande's dictionary, and in 1226, Étienne Boileau's Livre des métiers (Tradesman's Handbook) enumerated many types of devices which can only have been doubling machines. The instruments used were further perfected in Bologna between 1270 and 1280. From {{the start of}} the 14th century, many documents allude to the use of devices that were quite complex.|$|E
5|$|Coastal {{areas of}} Wales, and those near rivers, produce many {{different}} forms of fish and shellfish. Traditional fishing methods, such as wade netting for salmon, remained in place for 2,000 years. Welsh coracles, simple boats made of a willow frame and covered in animal hides, were noted by Romans and were still <b>in</b> <b>use</b> <b>in</b> the 20th century. Once landed, fish would generally be wind-dried and smoked, or cured with salt.|$|E

Gunpowder {{seems to have}} been widely known by the 13th century. The Europeans, Arabs, and Koreans all obtained firearms in the 14th century. The Turks, Iranians, and Indians all got firearms no later than the 15th century, in each case directly or indirectly from the Europeans. The Japanese did not acquire firearms until the 16th century, and then from the Portuguese rather than the Chinese.|$|E
