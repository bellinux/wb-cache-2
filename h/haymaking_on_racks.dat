40|$|The {{effect of}} <b>haymaking</b> <b>on</b> the neutral {{detergent}} soluble fraction of two intercropped forages cut at different growth stages The {{aim of the}} paper was to study the fermentation of the neutral detergent soluble fraction (NDS) using a 2 x 3 x 2 factorial arrangement of two intercropped forages (barley/broad bean and vetch/oats) collected at three growth stages and preserved by haymaking. Each feed sample and its isolated NDF were fermented in vitro and gas production was monitored utilizing the in vitro gas production technique (IVGPT). NDS gas yield {{was determined by the}} difference between gas from the unfractioned forage and that of its respective NDF. Haymaking decreased gas yield and rate of gas production from the unfractioned forage. Increasing maturi-ty did not change the final gas volume, but reduced the rate of gas production from the NDS fraction. The rate of gas production from the NDS fraction of hay decreased on average by 2. 9 ml/h compared with fresh forage. <b>On</b> average, <b>haymaking</b> reduced the gas yield from the NDS fraction by 18. 70 %. The curve subtrac-tion technique can be used to study the effects of <b>haymaking</b> <b>on</b> the neutral detergent soluble fraction of for-ages...|$|R

50|$|A nutrient-poor common-like {{landscape}} is a landscaping {{goal for the}} area. This type of landscape occurred naturally in the Middle Ages, probably due to intensive grazing and repeated <b>haymaking</b> <b>on</b> the commons, combined with not bringing back {{the same amount of}} nutrients in the form of manure, as was taken away, according to a theory. In some descriptions of the formation of the depleted vegetation around Trehøje {{there is no mention of}} the wind-erosion factor, which can blow away fertile topsoil nutrients - even though this has been a determining depletion-factor for surrounding land on Djursland in the Middle Ages.|$|R

40|$|Based on {{the ongoing}} Sino-German grazing experiment, which was {{designed}} to test how grazing intensity and management regimes (traditional system vs. mixed system) would affect the aboveground net primary productivity (ANPP) and compensatory growth of a typical steppe ecosystem in Inner Mongolia dominated by Leymus chinensis and Stipa grandis. Our experimental treatments included two management systems (e. g., a traditional versus a mixed system) and seven levels of stocking (i. e., 0, 1. 5, 3. 0, 4. 5, 6. 0, 7. 5, and 9. 0 sheep/ha). The traditional system was managed with grazing and <b>haymaking</b> <b>on</b> two different areas. The mixed system was managed with a yearly shift between grazing and <b>haymaking</b> <b>on</b> the same area. The results showed that, with increasing stocking rate, aboveground net primary productivity (ANPP) declined in both traditional and mixed grazing plots. At high stocking rates, ANPP in mixed grazing plots was significantly higher than that in the traditional grazing plots. Our results were partially in agreement with the grazing optimization hypothesis. Under the two management regimes, and using different methods for estimating the annual ANPP, we observed overcompensation, equal-compensation, and under-compensation in plantgrowth along a gradient of stocking rates. Equal-compensation was generally observed in the low stocking rate plots, while under-compensation was found in the high stocking rate plots. For most systems, compensatory growth could be simulated with linear or quadratic models when the percent biomass eaten by sheep was used as an index for estimating the relative stocking rate. Our study suggests that stocking rate, grazing regime, topographic position, and methods for estimating the net aboveground productivity were all important factors determining the magnitude and directions of estimated ANPP responses to grazing...|$|R
