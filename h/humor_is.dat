5|$|Home Made Mince Pie is a 1910 American silent short comedy {{produced}} by the Thanhouser Company. The film is a comedy of circumstances, in which the Gale family is going to host a dinner. The focus of the <b>humor</b> <b>is</b> in a mince pie that brandy is added to {{in an attempt to}} make it more appreciable, but three people each add brandy to the pie. Everyone becomes tipsy upon eating the pie, including the family cat, and the film concludes. No cast or staff credits for this film are known. The film was released on September 27, 1910, to mixed reviews in trade publications. Reviewers mentioned that the film was too long and it was unbelievable that one pie split eight ways would be able to impact everyone. The film is presumed lost.|$|E
25|$|Much of Sedaris' <b>humor</b> <b>is</b> ostensibly autobiographical and self-deprecating, {{and often}} {{concerns}} his family life, his middle-class upbringing {{in the suburbs}} of Raleigh, North Carolina, his Greek heritage, homosexuality, jobs, education, drug use, and obsessive behaviors, and his life in France, London, and the English South Downs.|$|E
25|$|Paired qualities were {{associated}} with each humor and its season. The word <b>humor</b> <b>is</b> a translation of Greek χυμός, chymos (literally juice or sap, metaphorically flavor). At around the same time, ancient Indian Ayurveda medicine had developed a theory of three humors, which they linked with the five Hindu elements.|$|E

25|$|In {{addition}} to feminine personality and wardrobe, the series characterized Maggie as extremely loyal {{and the ultimate}} friend. Her sense of <b>humor</b> <b>is</b> brought together by witty one-liners, often relying on such when angry, confrontational, or happy. Somewhat of a risk-taker, the character is frequently known to handle matters her way, no matter the consequence.|$|E
25|$|The comic's <b>humor</b> <b>is</b> {{most often}} absurdist, {{typically}} lacking a traditional set punchline, {{and very often}} moves to the highly surreal. The world of the strip is expansive, featuring many major and minor characters with detailed backstories, and often references previous events, making it an ongoing narrative. As Onstad is a food and cooking enthusiast, many Achewood strips contain some reference to food or drink.|$|E

40|$|Research {{has shown}} that a factor in a victim’s {{forgiveness}} of an offender is the victim’s ability to make more positive, or at least less negative, attributions of the offender’s behavior and that perspective-taking can {{be a factor in}} facilitating that process. Self-enhancing <b>humor</b> has <b>been</b> found to be positively correlated with perspective-taking empathy and aggressive <b>humor</b> found to <b>be</b> negatively correlated with perspective-taking empathy. Therefore it was predicted that self-enhancing <b>humor</b> would <b>be</b> positively correlated with forgiveness and aggressive humor negatively correlated with forgiveness. The Humor Styles Questionnaire, the Absence of Negative and Presence of Positive subscales of the Forgiveness Scale, and the Forgiveness Likelihood Scale were administered to 112 college undergraduates. Self-enhancing <b>humor</b> <b>was</b> significantly and positively correlated with all of the forgiveness measures, aggressive humor and self-defeating <b>humor</b> <b>were</b> significantly and negatively correlated with some of the forgiveness measures and affiliative <b>humor</b> <b>was</b> not significantly correlated with any of the forgiveness measures. The results were interpreted in terms of previous findings for humor styles, perspective-taking empathy, depression, self-esteem and anxiety. Future research involving the extent to which other personality variables, such as perspective-taking empathy, mediate the relationship between self-enhancing <b>humor</b> and forgiveness <b>was</b> suggested...|$|R
25|$|Ken Sutcliffe, {{known as}} the Male Model from Mudgee, is {{actually}} voiced by Sutcliffe himself. Considerable <b>humor</b> <b>is</b> dedicated to Sutcliffe's handsome features, and is seen as being a hit with the ladies—including the wives of both Benaud and Walker. When it's announced he is a possible addition to the commentary team, Sutcliffe is kidnapped by Max Walker in order to guarantee Walker's own successes.|$|E
25|$|Paranoia is {{a humorous}} {{role-playing}} game {{set in a}} dystopian future similar to Nineteen Eighty-Four, Brave New World, Logan's Run, and THX 1138; however, {{the tone of the}} game is rife with black humor, frequently tongue-in-cheek rather than dark and heavy. Most of the game's <b>humor</b> <b>is</b> derived from the players' (usually futile) attempts to complete their assignment while simultaneously adhering to The Computer's arbitrary, contradictory and often nonsensical security directives.|$|E
25|$|Though {{the basic}} {{concept of the}} strip is simple, Herriman always found ways to tweak the formula. Ignatz's plans to surreptitiously lob a brick at Krazy's head {{sometimes}} succeed; other times Officer Pupp outsmarts Ignatz and imprisons him. The interventions of Coconino County's other anthropomorphic animal residents, and even forces of nature, occasionally change the dynamic in unexpected ways. Other strips have Krazy's imbecilic or gnomic pronouncements irritating the mouse {{so much that he}} goes to seek out a brick in the final panel. Even self-referential <b>humor</b> <b>is</b> evident—in one strip, Officer Pupp, having arrested Ignatz, berates Herriman for not having finished drawing the jailhouse.|$|E

25|$|The optical {{component}} {{is concerned with}} producing a reduced inverted image on the retina. The eye's optical system consists of not only two but four surfaces—two on the cornea, two on the lens. Rays are refracted toward the midline. Distant rays, due to their parallel nature, converge to a point on the retina. The cornea admits light at the greatest angle. The aqueous and vitreous humors both have a refractive index of 1.336-1.339, whereas the cornea has a refractive index of 1.376. Because the change in refractive index between cornea and aqueous <b>humor</b> <b>is</b> relatively small compared to the change at the air–cornea interface, it has a negligible refractive effect, typically -6 dioptres. The cornea {{is considered to be}} a positive meniscus lens.|$|E
500|$|While Half-Life 2 follows protagonist Gordon Freeman in a dystopian future, Concerned {{follows a}} similar {{path through the}} eyes of [...] "Gordon Frohman", a dangerously clumsy {{character}} who arrives in the setting of the game a few weeks before Freeman does. The webcomic's dark <b>humor</b> <b>is</b> derived from its contrasts with the game and through references to the game's shortcomings. On several occasions in the comic, Frohman becomes the cause of various disastrous circumstances that Freeman will later encounter.|$|E
500|$|... "The Son Also Draws" [...] {{was written}} by Ricky Blitt and {{directed}} by Neil Affleck, both working on their first Family Guy episode. The episode guest starred actors Suzie Plakson, Kevin Michael Richardson, Fred Tatasciore and Wally Wingert. Recurring guest voice actors included writer and animator Butch Hartman and actor Patrick Bristow. Much of the episode's <b>humor</b> <b>is</b> structured around cutaway sequences that parody popular culture, including references to Speed Racer, Happy Days, Nova, One Day at a Time, and The More You Know.|$|E

500|$|In contrast, Robert Pierson {{from the}} TV Critic gave the episode a {{negative}} review criticizing the episode's self-referential humor {{and the fact}} that the characters would be so selfish that they would cripple their own friend, he stated that the scene where Peter and the others attack Joe made him [...] "dislike the show because there is nothing funny, positive or entertaining about it", he ended his review by saying that the episode's <b>humor</b> <b>is</b> [...] "evidence of a writing team which is too lazy and incompetent to write good humour".|$|E
500|$|Much of the comic's dark <b>humor</b> <b>is</b> {{derived from}} its {{contrasts}} with Half-Life 2: in a depressing, dark {{vision of a}} conquered humanity's future, Gordon Freeman becomes a hero and savior; the similarly named Gordon Frohman, on the other hand, is just an average person, improbably cheerful {{to the point of}} stupidity, and somewhat naïve as to what is actually going on around him. [...] For instance, Frohman fails to realize that his return-addressed letters to Doctor Breen reveal his location, and so result in that location being invaded, bombed, or otherwise compromised.|$|E

It {{was one of many}} similar shorts produced by Vitagraph Studios, whose popularity made Bunny and Finch early film stars.
