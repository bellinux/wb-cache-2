40|$|HIV epidemicity {{in context}} of STI declines: a telling {{discordance}} Decosas and Padian report, {{but do not}} discuss, a noteworthy disassociation in epidemic tra-jectory between human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and sexually transmitted infec-tions (STI) in Zimbabwe. 1 They cite estimates that, between 1990 and 1999, HIV prevalence increased linearly from 9 % to 25 %, while STI syndrome reports declined substantially, from 963 436 cases to 727 788. The authors not only believe that observed STI declines are real, but cite increases in reported condom use by high risk people (for example, prostitute women, truck drivers, miners, and young people) as supporting evidence. What is not clear is why HIV prevalence would increase markedly coevally with increasing condom use in high risk populations and with decreasing STI incidence. Assuming synergism between STI and HIV transmission, 2 {{one would expect that}} a burgeoning and sexually mediated HIV epi-demic would be accompanied by correspond-ing increases in STI transmissions. An esti-mated increase in HIV prevalence from 9 % to 25 % in a decade, implying a 12 % annual epidemic growth rate, {{is not likely to be}} due to differences between HIV, a chronic <b>infection</b> <b>that</b> <b>accumulates</b> in a reservoir, and STI, which tend not to. Does this anomaly require clarification? Recent analyses 3 4 suggest that a large proportion of HIV infections, especially in sub-Saharan Africa, 5 may be a consequence of unsafe medical injections. This under-suspected and scientifically underexplored transmission vector is overlooked by the authors as well (exception: “blood safety ” in fig 1). Theirs is not the first report of an epidemiologically suspicious anomaly be-tween STI and HIV trends in Africa 6 and, if others ’ suspicions are correct, 3 – 5 it is unlikely to be the last...|$|E
50|$|A {{dental abscess}} (also termed a dentoalveolar abscess, tooth abscess or root abscess), is a {{localized}} collection of pus {{associated with a}} tooth. The {{most common type of}} dental abscess is a periapical abscess, and the second most common is a periodontal abscess. In a periapical abscess, usually the origin is a bacterial <b>infection</b> <b>that</b> has <b>accumulated</b> in the soft, often dead, pulp of the tooth. This can be caused by tooth decay, broken teeth or extensive periodontal disease (or combinations of these factors). A failed root canal treatment may also create a similar abscess.|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT: A tooth abscess or root abscess is pus {{enclosed}} in the tissues of the jaw bone {{at the apex}} of an infected tooth's root(s). Usually the abscess originates from a bacterial <b>infection</b> <b>that</b> has <b>accumulated</b> in the soft, often dead, pulp of the tooth. This can be caused by untreated tooth decay, cracked teeth or extensive periodontal disease. A failed root canal treatment may also create a similar abscess. Recently developed molecular methods have made it possible to characterise mixed micro flora in their entirety, including the substantial numbers of uncultivable bacteria. This paper will review the current literature regarding the molecular techniques used to identify uncultivable bacteria from dental abscess.
