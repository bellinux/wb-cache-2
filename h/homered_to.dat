5|$|Kershaw had a 41 inning {{scoreless}} inning streak {{that ended}} {{in the top of}} the sixth inning on July 10 when, with two outs, Chase Headley <b>homered</b> <b>to</b> left field at Dodger Stadium. Kershaw's streak was, at the time, tied for the fifteenth longest scoreless inning streak in MLB history. He won the pitcher of the month award again in July, the third Dodger (along with Don Sutton and Burt Hooton) to win it two months in a row. He was 4–0 with a 1.10 ERA in the month with 48 strikeouts and only 10 walks. He picked up his 200th strikeout of the season on September 2, the fifth year in a row he had reached that number, trailing only the six seasons in a row for Sandy Koufax among Dodger starters. He also became just the fourth pitcher since 1893 to have at least five 200-strikeout seasons through an age-26 season (Bert Blyleven, Walter Johnson and Sam McDowell are the others).|$|E
25|$|Al Woods came up {{to pinch}} hit for Steve Bowling {{in the bottom of}} the fifth inning. With Otto Vélez on the basepads, Woods <b>homered</b> <b>to</b> right field. The score was now 7–4 in favour of Toronto, with the team having scored in every inning of the game to that point.|$|E
25|$|González {{pitched a}} perfect second inning. In {{the bottom of}} the second, Washington second baseman Daniel Murphy <b>homered</b> <b>to</b> right on Cubs starter Kyle Hendricks′s first pitch to tie the game at 1-1. Third baseman Anthony Rendon {{followed}} with a single, then advanced to second when catcher Matt Wieters executed a perfect bunt single. Center fielder Michael A. Taylor then hit a three-run homer – his second consecutive home run in the series – to give Washington a 4-1 lead. After Hendricks got the first two outs of the inning, he gave up a double to Werth and the Cubs intentionally walked Harper, but Hendricks finally stopped the Nationals′ rally by striking out first baseman Ryan Zimmerman.|$|E

25|$|The Razorbacks {{opened the}} College World Series in game 1 against #1 {{national}} seed Cal State Fullerton. Dallas Keuchel pitched well, with Zack Cox and Andy Wilkins both homering in a resounding 10-6 win. The win set a rematch with LSU, who had beaten Arkansas in a hard-fought series {{earlier in the}} year. LSU got a first-inning home run from pitcher Brett Eibner, and the Hogs bats fell silent in a 9-1 loss. Both fighting for their tournament lives, Arkansas met Virginia in an elimination game. The Razorbacks offense was again quiet, and the Hogs were down to their last strike when Brett Eibner <b>homered</b> <b>to</b> keep the Razorbacks in Omaha. The Hogs would prevail after another timely Andrew Darr double in the tenth inning. A rematch with LSU sat on the horizon, and the drained Arkansas pitching staff struggled. Closer Stephen Richards started the game for the Hogs, who were losing 4-0 by the third inning. After an error and a wild pitch, the Razorbacks gave up runs in six separate innings, and lost 14-5. The Hogs finished tied with Arizona State (who Arkansas defeated twice in the regular season) for third place.|$|E
25|$|The Nationals {{began their}} 2017 season {{at home against}} the {{division}} rival Miami Marlins. Marlins starter Edinson Vólquez pitched effectively, making heavy use of his changeup to bamboozle Nationals hitters and working out of jams {{in the first and}} fourth innings. He gave up four hits and a walk and allowed no runs while striking out six, but he left the game after five innings. Stephen Strasburg was efficient as the Opening Day starter for the Nationals, but the Marlins took the lead {{in the top of the}} fourth inning, with right fielder Giancarlo Stanton driving in catcher J.T. Realmuto with a double and then scoring on a single by Marcell Ozuna. The lead was cut in half as Nationals right fielder Bryce Harper hit his fifth career Opening Day home run to right field off Marlins reliever David Phelps in the sixth inning with no one on base, and then Phelps gave up the lead entirely in the bottom of the seventh inning, as pinch-hitter Adam Lind <b>homered</b> <b>to</b> center field after a two-out single by catcher Matt Wieters—both players new additions to the Nationals who signed late in the off-season, with Lind making his first plate appearance with Washington.|$|E
25|$|Neither team scored {{until the}} Mariners took a 1–0 {{lead in the}} seventh inning. Aaron Hill and Mookie Betts turned the game around with solo shots in the eighth and ninth, respectively. Craig Kimbrel, who just {{returned}} from the DL walked one batter but earned the save. In game 2, David Price took a 4–0 lead in the eighth but allowed the first four batters to reach on just nine pitches and was pulled from the game. Matt Barnes struck out the only batter he faced and newly acquired Fernando Abad was summoned from the bullpen to face Robinson Canó, but he <b>homered</b> <b>to</b> take the 5–4 lead which was {{the difference in the}} game. Rick Porcello pitched an eight inning complete game and took the loss with just one run in support. He gave up three runs on just four hits, three of them solo home runs. Andrew Benintendi collected his first hit in the majors and added a second Game four was tied at 2 from the fifth inning on. Travis Shaw scored the go ahead run in the eleventh inning on a Brock Holt RBI single. Craig Krimbrel, who was put in the game with two outs in the ninth, earned the win, Brad Ziegler recorded the save.|$|E

Amadopoulos wants <b>Homer</b> <b>to</b> give a pep talk to his plant's lackluster workers. <b>Homer</b> is hesitant <b>to</b> accept, but Mr. Burns forces him into it. At the Shelbyville plant, he gives a fumbling motivational speech. Suddenly an impending meltdown threatens the Shelbyville plant. Amadopoulos and <b>Homer</b> go <b>to</b> the control room, and Amadopoulos asks <b>Homer</b> <b>to</b> avert the meltdown. In front of everyone, Homer repeats his rhyme and presses a button blindly. By luck, he again manages to avert a meltdown. Amadopoulos thanks Homer for saving the plant, but angrily berates him for his stupidity. Soon the phrase [...] "to pull a Homer", meaning [...] "to succeed despite idiocy," [...] becomes widely used and is entered into the dictionary.|$|R

25|$|The Dodgers {{returned}} home on July 25 {{and dropped the}} opener of a four-game series against the Cincinnati Reds, 5-2. Mat Latos held the Dodgers to one run in 7 2/3 innings, and Jay Bruce and Xavier Paul each <b>homered</b> <b>to</b> end the six-game winning streak. Hanley Ramírez hit a two-run homer to back Clayton Kershaw's eight strikeouts in eight innings as the club won 2-1 {{in the second game}} of the series. Hyun-jin Ryu dominated on July 27, striking out nine and allowing only one run on two hits in seven innings in the Dodgers' 4-1 victory over the Reds. Puig hit a walk-off homer {{in the bottom of the}} 11th as the Dodgers took the series finale 1-0. A pitching duel between Chris Capuano and Tony Cingrani kept the game tied heading into extra innings. The 20 strikeouts by Dodgers batters in the game set a franchise record, breaking the mark set during a 15-inning game on May 2, 1995 against the Giants. Greinke stuck out 7 in 7 innings and Mark Ellis hit a walk-off RBI single in the ninth as the Dodgers beat the New York Yankees 3-2 on July 30. Kershaw pitched eight shutout innings as the month came to a close, but Hiroki Kuroda also did not allow a run and the Yankees won 3-0 after scoring all their runs off the Dodgers bullpen in the top of the ninth.|$|E

The Yankees met the Chicago Cubs in the 1932 World Series and swept them four games to none. Gehrig had three home runs, eight RBI, and a [...]529 batting average for the Series, while Ruth contributed a pair of home runs in the third game at Chicago's Wrigley Field. The second of Ruth's home runs was his [...] "called shot"; after pointing towards the center field stands, according to some post-game press reports, Ruth <b>homered</b> <b>to</b> break a 4–4 tie in the fifth inning. Although accounts of the incident vary greatly, author Eric Enders called the home run [...] "the most talked-about hit in baseball history".|$|E

Donaldson competed in the Home Run Derby, losing to eventual winner Todd Frazier in the semi-finals. After the break, the Blue Jays returned to Toronto to play three games against the Rays.

2500|$|... in {{the bottom}} of the eighth in the second game {{provided}} the only offense of the night in a 1–0 victory that pulled the Dodgers into sole possession of first place for the first time all season. The Dodgers completed their first home sweep of the Cards in 22 years when Clayton Kershaw struck out 10 in seven innings and Ramirez <b>homered</b> <b>to</b> lead the Dodgers to a 4–3 victory in the series finale.

[...] He <b>homered</b> <b>to</b> drive in his 888th career run on July 1 versus the Oakland Athletics, passing Heath for the all-time lead among Canadian-born players.

2500|$|Carl Edwards Jr. came in {{to pitch}} for the Cubs {{in the bottom of}} the eighth, which began with pinch-hitter Adam Lind, a veteran who had played 1,344 regular-season games over 12 seasons, {{singling}} in the first postseason appearance of his career. Twenty-year-old Victor Robles, who had just reached the major leagues for the first time on September 7, made his own career postseason debut when he {{came in to}} pinch-run for Lind. After Trea Turner struck out, Bryce Harper, 0-for-3 in the game with two groundouts and a strikeout and seemingly overmatched by Cubs pitching, came to the plate; he had just returned in late September from 42 days on the disabled list and since then had gone 4-for-25 (.160) in the regular season and postseason combined with no extra-base hits, but on a 3-1 pitch from Edwards he <b>homered</b> <b>to</b> right – the fifth home run of his 16-game postseason career – to tie the game at 3-3. Edwards then walked Rendon. Mike Montgomery relieved Edwards, but surrendered a single to Daniel Murphy which advanced Rendon to second. Zimmerman then came up to bat; he had hit only [...]167 against the Cubs during the regular season and his 1-for-6 performance in the division series had dropped his average against the Cubs in 2017 as a whole to [...]144, but he hit a three-run homer to left, giving the Nationals a 6-3 lead. After Montgomery retired the side, Nationals closer Sean Doolittle made his first appearance of the series, and gave up only a single in the top of the ninth on his way to earning the first postseason save of his career. The Nationals evened the series at 1-1.|$|E
