500|$|The album {{features}} four guest artists; Rakim {{from the}} hip hop duo Eric B. & Rakim on [...] "Guilty All the Same", Page Hamilton from the American alternative metal band Helmet on [...] "All for Nothing", Daron Malakian from System of a Down for the song [...] "Rebellion" [...] and Tom Morello of Rage Against the Machine fame on the song [...] "Drawbar". Bennington commented on the collaborations, stating that [...] "We really felt like {{if we need to}} be inspired and move in another direction. I think when we got Page in, Mike had written this chorus and sang it, and his voice had this tone, and it was unlike anything I'd heard from him before. And I was like, [...] "Dude this is crazy, this sounds like a Helmet song! It's cool!" [...] And we were like, [...] "Dude, why don't we see <b>if</b> <b>we</b> <b>can</b> <b>get</b> like Page in here?" [...] You know? And if that's why the song says it's feeling like it should be, then why don't we just go straight to the source".|$|E
500|$|The episode {{featured}} several appearances {{by several}} frequent guest stars, including Todd Buonopane as NBC Human resource mediator Jeffrey Weinerslav, Cheyenne Jackson as TGS cast member Danny Baker, Chris Parnell as Dr. Leo Spaceman, and Sherri Shepherd as Angie Jordan {{the wife of}} Tracy Jordan. Buonopane, Jackson, Parnell, and Shepherd made their fifth, eighth, sixteenth, and sixth appearances on the show, respectively. In an interview with TV Guide in November 2010, co-showrunner and executive producer Robert Carlock revealed that Shepherd's character [...] "will be getting her own Real Housewives-type reality show. Having the cameras around forces Tracy to act on better behavior." [...] This {{is evident in the}} following episode [...] "Operation Righteous Cowboy Lightning". Tina Fey, the series creator, executive producer and lead actress on 30 Rock, told Entertainment Weekly, in regards to Angie's reality show, [...] "We're hoping to, maybe, <b>if</b> <b>we</b> <b>can</b> <b>get</b> away with it, do an entire episode that's just an episode of Queen of Jordan. Now I'm just superimposing my own TV viewing habits onto 30 Rock." [...] In the episode, Dr. Spaceman informs Tracy Jordan—played by Tracy Morgan—that he is dying, television columnist Meredith Blake from the Los Angeles Times wondered if this subplot was written as {{a way to deal with}} Tracy Morgan's recent kidney transplant as he is expected to miss several episodes to recover from the procedure.|$|E
500|$|He started 2002–03 well, {{taking his}} place in the team due to {{injuries}} to other players. He made his first appearance in the opening match, a 1–1 draw away to Macclesfield Town on 10 August 2002, with chairman John Batchelor claiming Smith had a [...] "wonderful game and <b>if</b> <b>we</b> <b>can</b> <b>get</b> that sort of attitude from everyone in the team we won't have any problems". Smith was dropped to the bench for a 1–1 home draw with Wrexham on 29 October 2002 due to a change in formation, having started every match in 2002–03 prior to this match, although he did play as a 48th-minute substitute. He suffered a hamstring injury in early-November 2002, making his return in a 1–0 victory away to Rochdale on 23 November. Smith received his first red card of 2002–03 for a second bookable offence in a 1–1 home draw with Hull City on 28 December 2002, resulting in a one-match suspension. This meant he missed York's match against Torquay on 11 January 2003, and after a short spell on the sidelines returned in a 2–1 home win over Macclesfield on 2 February. Smith finished 2002–03 with 39 appearances for York, and was described by the Evening Press as the [...] "surprise star of the season". Despite being in outstanding form and becoming a fans' favourite, he was not offered a new contract with York at the end of 2002–03 by Dolan, although he hoped to still to have a future at the club. This decision was reversed by newly appointed player-manager Chris Brass, and Smith signed a new one-year contract in July 2003.|$|E

6000|$|... "Now, boys, we've {{got to do}} something," [...] {{said the}} Brill captain, when the nine came in. [...] "Two runs at least, and three <b>if</b> <b>we</b> <b>can</b> {{possibly}} <b>get</b> them." ...|$|R
2500|$|Eastwood had {{confidence}} in Swank's acting background, but upon seeing Swank's small physique, he had concerns, [...] "I just thought, 'Yeah, this gal would be great. <b>If</b> <b>we</b> <b>can</b> <b>get</b> her trained up. <b>If</b> <b>we</b> <b>can</b> <b>get</b> {{a little bit}} more bulk on her, to make her look like a fighter'...She was like a feather. But what happened is, she had this great work ethic." ...|$|E
2500|$|... "A lot {{of people}} hear about Biscayne National Park because of Stiltsville. It can be a {{wonderful}} educational tool <b>if</b> <b>we</b> <b>can</b> <b>get</b> people out there so {{we can talk about}} the local history and marine environment." ...|$|E
2500|$|On July 7, 2006, Angelides {{expressed}} {{his support for}} gay rights, and pledged to legalize same-sex marriage if elected governor, stating [...] "I would sign the marriage equality bill because I believe <b>if</b> <b>we</b> <b>can</b> <b>get</b> behind people to build a lasting relationship, {{that is a good}} thing." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "We {{might do}} it," [...] said Kennedy to Fenn, as they changed. [...] "Milligan's a cert for three points, of course, but <b>if</b> <b>we</b> <b>can</b> only <b>get</b> two <b>we</b> win the cup." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "On {{the other}} hand, here's gold {{knocking}} about like cast iron at home. <b>If</b> only <b>we</b> <b>can</b> <b>get</b> {{some of it}} back, <b>if</b> only <b>we</b> <b>can</b> find our sphere again before they do, and get back, then--" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "That's really clever, my dear," [...] he said, [...] "and I see {{no reason}} why we can't do it, just the way you say, <b>if</b> only <b>we</b> <b>can</b> <b>get</b> the wild monkeys to agree to it." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "So {{you like}} Plumfield better than Page's farm. Well, {{let us see}} <b>if</b> <b>we</b> <b>can</b> <b>get</b> on more comfortably this time than we did before." ...|$|E

60|$|We {{expect to}} do a lot of inland work. The {{smallness}} of the Snark makes this possible. When we enter the land, out go the masts and on goes the engine. There are the canals of China, and the Yang-tse River. We shall spend months on them <b>if</b> <b>we</b> <b>can</b> <b>get</b> permission from the government. That will be the one obstacle to our inland voyaging--governmental permission. But <b>if</b> <b>we</b> <b>can</b> <b>get</b> that permission, there is scarcely a limit to the inland voyaging we can do.|$|E
6000|$|... "Stop paddling, masters, {{and look}} {{ahead at the}} rock yonder, jist under the tall cliff. There's a bear a-sittin' there, an' <b>if</b> <b>we</b> <b>can</b> only <b>get</b> to shore afore he sees us, we're sartin sure of him." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Half {{the month}} safely gone. <b>If</b> <b>we</b> <b>can</b> only <b>get</b> well over these last weeks, a great weight will be off my mind," [...] thought Rose {{as she went}} down one wild, wet morning {{toward the end of}} February.|$|R
6000|$|... "Why, of course," [...] Frida cried impulsively, with prompt decision; [...] "Robert's Gladstone bag and {{my little}} brown trunk would be the very things for him. I could lend them to him at once, <b>if</b> only <b>we</b> <b>can</b> <b>get</b> a Sunday cab to take them." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I suppose <b>if</b> <b>we</b> <b>can</b> <b>get</b> {{ready to}} go up with you, Harry, we could go into lodgings at Putney, till we find a house to suit us?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "No," [...] said Jonas, [...] "not much now, but {{the wind}} may rise before we get back. However, we'll go and see <b>if</b> <b>we</b> <b>can</b> <b>get</b> a boat." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Well, Mother,' said Ellen, 'I'll go in {{and take}} the things to Betsey on the next market-day, and <b>if</b> <b>we</b> <b>can</b> <b>get</b> thirty shillings on them without the mantle--' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Then {{instead of}} {{remaining}} here {{we had better}} cross the river {{as soon as we}} have our cases of goods. <b>If</b> <b>we</b> <b>can</b> only <b>get</b> a store in a good location we may do better than we did on circus day in those other places." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "If {{we had a}} boat {{we could}} catch him easily," [...] {{observed}} Tom. Then his eyes fell upon the fallen tree. [...] "I have an idea! Let us try to get across on that! I won't mind a wetting <b>if</b> only <b>we</b> <b>can</b> <b>get</b> Dick's watch back." ...|$|R
6000|$|Fellows, I {{believe there}} is a camp over there, and <b>if</b> <b>we</b> <b>can</b> manage to <b>get</b> across perhaps we'll learn {{something}} about our belongings." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I wasn't in {{very good}} form that night," [...] he acknowledged. [...] "I must {{make up for it}} to-night, <b>if</b> <b>we</b> <b>can</b> <b>get</b> Fothergill to give us our revenge." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "The Frenchman has gone, father; and so noiselessly that I {{could hardly}} hear her. <b>If</b> <b>we</b> <b>can</b> <b>get</b> out as quietly {{there is little}} fear of our being noticed." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "There is {{a vessel}} on the sands," [...] Frank exclaimed. [...] "Let us make for her. <b>If</b> <b>we</b> <b>can</b> <b>get</b> on board {{we shall have}} a better chance than here." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Your Excellency is overtoiled in {{the public}} service," [...] said Pearson; [...] "a course of the stag in the evening will refresh you.

6000|$|... "We wouldn't let {{the boys}} come in. We'd have {{it a secret}} society, as they do their temperance lodge, and we'd have badges and pass-words and grips.

6000|$|... "As you {{are new to}} {{our ways}} I am {{going to let you}} rest this evening. We will sit about the fire and tell stories.

6000|$|... "Aint no {{cabin on}} this trail short of Hank Leeson's place, twenty miles {{this side of}} the fort. <b>If</b> <b>we</b> <b>can</b> <b>get</b> that far I reckon we can make the fort." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Now," [...] said Hugh, as they strung their bows, [...] "six arrows apiece here, <b>if</b> <b>we</b> <b>can</b> <b>get</b> off so many, {{and the odd}} eleven at {{our next}} stand. Ah, they come." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "And see <b>if</b> <b>we</b> <b>can</b> <b>get</b> horses {{enough to}} pull it," [...] said Ben. [...] "Some farmers won't let their horses out in such a storm as this--and you can't blame 'em much, either." ...|$|E
60|$|<b>If</b> <b>we</b> <b>can</b> ever <b>get</b> {{this thing}} through Congress, <b>we</b> <b>can</b> try making {{copyright}} perpetual, some day.

6000|$|... "We {{must keep}} a good {{look-out}} for that.
