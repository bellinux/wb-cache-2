40|$|Activation of the {{surfaces}} of lunar regolith particles can occur through interactions with solar electromagnetic radiation, solar and <b>galactic</b> <b>particle</b> radiation and micrometeoroid bombardment.

Also key to the importance of activation is the lifetimes of activated states in various environments which is controlled by their passivation rate as well as their activation rate.

40|$|This {{investigation}} {{was directed at}} determining the energy spectra and abundances of low energy heavy cosmic rays (0. 03 E or = 150 MeV/nucleon). The cosmic rays were detected using plastic and glass particle track detectors. Particles emitted during the 17 April 1972 solar flare dominated the spectra for energies below about 70 MeV/nucleon. Two conclusions emerge from the low energy data: (1) The differential energy spectra for solar particles vary rapidly for energies as low as 0. 05 MeV/nucleon for iron-group nuclei. (2) The abundance ratio of heavy elements changes with energy at low energies; heavy elements are enhanced relative to higher elements increasingly as the energy decreases. <b>Galactic</b> <b>particle</b> fluxes recorded within the spacecraft are in agreement with those predicted taking into account solar modulation and spacecraft shielding.

40|$|Recent {{observations}} of GeV /TeV photon emission from several X-ray binaries have sparked {{a renewed interest}} in these objects as <b>galactic</b> <b>particle</b> accelerators. In spite of the available multi-wavelength data, their acceleration mechanisms are not determined, {{and the nature of the}} accelerated particles (hadrons or leptons) is unknown. While much evidence favors leptonic emission, it is very likely that a hadronic component is also accelerated in the jets of these binary systems. The observation of neutrino emission would be clear evidence for the presence of a hadronic component in the outflow of these sources. In this paper we look for periodic neutrino emission from binary systems. Such modulation, observed in the photon flux, would be caused by the geometry of these systems. The results of two searches are presented that differ in the treatment of the spectral shape and phase of the emission. The 'generic' search allows parameters to vary freely and best fit values, in a 'model-dependent' search, predictions are used to constrain these parameters. We use the IceCube data taken from May 31, 2007 to April 5, 2008 with its 22 -string configuration, and from April 5, 2008 and May 20, 2009 with its 40 -string configuration. For the generic search and the 40 string sample, we find that the most significant source in the catalog of 7 binary stars is Cygnus X- 3 with a 1. 8 % probability after trials (2. 10 " sigma one-sided) of being produced by statistical fluctuations of the background.

40|$|The {{lunar surface}} is {{bathed in a}} variety of {{impacting}} particles originating from the solar wind, solar flares, and galactic cosmic rays. These particles can become embedded in the regolith and/or produce a range of other molecules as they pass through the target material. The Moon therefore contains a record of the variability of the solar and <b>galactic</b> <b>particle</b> fluxes through time. To obtain useful temporal snapshots of these processes, discrete regolith units must be shielded from continued bombardment that would rewrite the record over time. One mechanism for achieving this preservation is the burial of a regolith deposit by a later lava flow. The archival value of such deposits sandwiched between lava layers is enhanced by the fact that both the under- and over-lying lava can be dated by radiometric techniques, thereby precisely defining the age of the regolith layer and the geologic record contained therein. The implanted volatile species would be vulnerable to outgassing by the heat of the over-lying flow, at temperatures exceeding 300 – 700 °C. However, the insulating properties of the finely particulate regolith would restrict significant heating to shallow depths. We have therefore modeled the heat transfer between lunar mare basalt lavas and the regolith in order to establish the range of depths below which implanted volatiles would be preserved. We find that the full suite of solar wind volatiles, consisting predominantly of H and He, would survive at depths of not, vert, similar 13 – 290 cm (for 1 – 10 m thick lava flows, respectively). A substantial amount of CO, CO 2, N 2 and Xe would be preserved at depths as shallow as 3. 7 cm beneath meter-thick flows. Given typical regolith accumulation rates during mare volcanism, the optimal localities for collecting viable solar wind samples would involve stacks of thin mare lava flows emplaced a few tens to a few hundred Ma apart, in order for sufficient regolith to develop between burial events. Obtaining useful archives of Solar System processes would therefore require extraction of regolith deposits buried at quite shallow depths beneath radiometrically-dated mare lava flows. These results provide a basis for possible lunar exploration activities...|$|E

40|$|We {{have used}} {{measurements}} from instruments on Voyagers 1 and 2 and Pioneer 10 to derive simultaneous latitudinal and radial gradients of anomalous cosmic-ray helium and oxygen and {{galactic cosmic rays}} during {{the latter part of}} 1986. We find that the negative latitudinal gradients that first appeared in 1985 when Voyager 1 reached heliolatitudes in excess of the current sheet continue to be observed, with an increased magnitude probably related to the decreasing tilt of the current sheet. The sign of this gradient is opposite to that reported during the last solar cycle when the solar magnetic field polarity was reversed, as predicted by propagation models in which curvature and gradient drifts are important. Although during the 1985 - 1986 time period radial gradients in the outer heliosphere appeared to decrease, the ratios of the radial and latitudinal gradients remained similar for both anomalous and <b>galactic</b> <b>particles</b> as predicted by drift theory.

40|$|Solar {{activity}} {{can influence the}} Earth's environment, {{and in particular the}} ozone layer, by direct modulation of the e. m. radiation or through variability of the incoming cosmic ray flux (solar and <b>galactic</b> <b>particles).</b> In particular, solar energetic particles (SEPs) provide additional external energy to the terrestrial environment; they are able to interact with the minor constituents of the atmospheric layer and produce ionizations, dissociations, dissociative ionizations and excitations. This paper highlights the SEP effects on the chemistry of the upper atmosphere by analysing some SEP events recorded during 2005 in the descending phase of the current solar cycle. It is shown that these events can lead to short- (hours) and medium- (days) term ozone variations through catalytic cycles (e. g. HOx and NOx increases).

Recently, however, there have been claims for lower transitional energies, specifically from logE (eV) ~ 17. 0 [G. Thompson et al. (2004) ] via 17. 2 - 17. 8 [V. S. Berezinsky et al. (2004) ] to 18. 0 [A. M. Hillas (2004) ]. In our model the ankle arises naturally from the sum of simple power law-spectra with slopes differing by ~ 1. 8; from differential slope - 3. 8 for <b>Galactic</b> <b>particles</b> (near logE = 19) to ~ - 2. 0 for extragalactic sources. In the other models, on the other hand, the ankle is intrinsic to the extragalactic component alone, and arises from {{the shape of the}} rate of energy loss versus energy for the (assumed) protons interacting with the cosmic microwave background (CMB). Our detailed analysis of the world's data on the ultra-high energy spectrum shows that taken together, or separately, the resulting mean sharpness of the ankle (second difference of the log(intensity*E^ 3) with respect to logE) is consistent with our `mixed' model. For explanation in terms of extragalactic particles alone, however, the ankle will be at the wrong energy - for reasonable production models and of insufficient magnitude if, as seems likely, there is still a significant fraction of heavy nuclei at the ankle energy...|$|R
