30|$|Fast {{fingerprint}} database construction Although the fingerprint positioning {{has been}} studied for a long time, it still cannot be applied widely since its offline phase generally spends {{a huge amount of}} time on fingerprint database construction. By using the conventional approaches, the target area is calibrated with a batch of equally spaced grids, and then, the fingerprints are collected at the grids point-by-point [18, 19]. The involved time cost rises significantly with the increase of environmental size, which hinders the development of fingerprint positioning. In [20], the authors propose to construct an incomplete fingerprint database with realistic coverage gaps, and meanwhile study the performance of several interpolation and extrapolation approaches used for recovering the <b>missing</b> <b>fingerprints.</b> In [21], according to the distribution of Reference Points (RPs) with respect to each Wi-Fi Access Point (AP), the signal propagation model is constructed as a function of spatial structure, which can be used to construct the fingerprint database quickly.|$|R

40|$|Past {{automation}} {{research has}} focused primarily on machine-related factors (e. g., automation reliability) and human-related factors (e. g., accountability). Other machine-related factors such as type of automation <b>errors,</b> <b>misses</b> or false alarms, have been noticeably overlooked. These two automation errors correspond to potential operator <b>errors,</b> omission (<b>misses)</b> and commission (false alarms), which have proven to directly affect operators trust in automation. This research examined how automation-error-type affects operator trust and reliance in and perceived reliability of automated decision aids. This present research confirmed that perceived reliability is often lower than actual system reliability and that false alarms significantly reduced operator trust in the automation more so than do misses. In addition, this study found that there {{does not appear to}} be an effect on the level of subjective trust within each experimental condition (i. e., type of automation error) based on age. There does, however, appear to be a significant difference in the reliance on automation between older and younger adult participants attributed to differences in perceived workload. M. S.
