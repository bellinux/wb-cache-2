5|$|Although the Kentucky Constitution {{prohibited}} governors {{from serving}} consecutive terms, Beckham {{announced he would}} seek a full term as governor in 1903. His candidacy was challenged in court, but the court ruled Beckham had not served a full first term and was eligible to run. Due to his record of reconciliation and supporting non-controversial reforms, he had no significant opposition in winning his party's nomination. His record also deprived his Republican opponent, Morris B. Belknap, of any significant campaign <b>issue</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> general election. Beckham defeated Belknap and three minor candidates.|$|E

5|$|Critical {{reception}} {{towards the}} game was generally positive. Reviews praised the game's formula, including its open-ended nature {{and its ability to}} immerse the player into the game. Criticism targeted the game's lack of documentation, which some reviewers found made it harder to learn how to play the game. The in-game speed was also criticized for being too slow, which was a crucial <b>issue</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> game because time must pass for the player to earn income to purchase new facilities.|$|E
5|$|Danny K. Davis {{running for}} Chicago mayor in the Democratic primary {{scheduled}} for February 26, 1991, made police brutality and excessive force an <b>issue</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> campaign.

After Mayor of Chicago Richard M. Daley seemed reluctant to initiate an investigation, his opponent Davis questioned {{whether there was a}} police and city coverup. Eventually, after pressure by citizens' organizations and anti-brutality organizations, the police department resumed an internal investigation.|$|E
5|$|However, Lauderdale was disliked for his {{opposition}} to the popular Queen Caroline, which became a significant <b>issue</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> campaign. His agents claimed that Balfour would have opposed her trial for alleged adultery, but he was portrayed as too close to Liverpool's Tory ministry to properly represent interests of the borough. After four days of polling, Balfour lost by 9 votes (374—363) to the Whig baronet Sir Francis Blake.|$|E

5|$|In August 1931, Amazing was {{acquired}} by Teck Publications, a subsidiary of Bernarr Macfadden's Macfadden Publications.

5|$|Since the {{beginning}} of this country's history, most American Indian tribes have been subject to federal authority and jurisdiction. In Maine, however, indigenous populations lived on reservations that were exclusively and completely administered by the state.

Other forms of these advisories include winter weather, high wind, flood, tropical cyclone, and fog. Severe weather advisories and alerts are broadcast through the media, including radio, using emergency systems as the Emergency Alert System, which break into regular programming.|$|E
5|$|After 830, Egbert had {{followed}} {{a policy of}} maintaining good relations with Mercia, and this was continued by Æthelwulf when he became king. London was traditionally a Mercian town, but in the 830s it was under West Saxon control; soon after Æthelwulf's accession it reverted to Mercian control. King Wiglaf of Mercia died in 839 and his successor, Berhtwulf, revived the Mercian mint in London; the two kingdoms appear to have struck a joint <b>issue</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> mid-840s, possibly indicating West Saxon help in reviving Mercian coinage, and showing the friendly {{relations between the two}} powers. Berkshire was still Mercian in 844, but by 849 it was part of Wessex, as Alfred was born in that year at the West Saxon royal estate in Wantage, then in Berkshire. However, the local Mercian ealdorman, also called Æthelwulf, retained his position under the West Saxon kings. Berhtwulf died in 852 and cooperation with Wessex continued under Burgred, his successor as King of Mercia, who married Æthelwulf's daughter Æthelswith in 853. In the same year Æthelwulf assisted Burgred in a successful attack on Wales to restore the traditional Mercian hegemony over the Welsh.|$|E
5|$|After bee populations dropped 23% in {{the winter}} of 2013, the Environmental Protection Agency and Department of Agriculture formed a task force to address the <b>issue.</b> <b>In</b> <b>the</b> six years leading up to 2013, more than 10 million {{beehives}} were lost, often to CCD, nearly twice the normal rate of loss.

An insecticide produced by Syngenta was banned by the European Commission in 2013 for use in crops pollinated by bees. Syngenta together with Bayer is challenging this ban in court.|$|E
