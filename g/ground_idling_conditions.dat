40|$|In this study, {{the effects}} of air-flow {{shifting}} between the pilot and main stages of a staged lean jet engine burner were investigated. A fluidic element attached {{in front of the}} swirlers was used to alter the air-flow split ratio between them, and the swirler and nozzle exit-section pressure loss behind the fluidic element was measured using an atmospheric isothermal test. The fluidic element did not fully recover the pressure loss in the burner inlet. However, it can also affect the losses, and cause an air shift between the pilot and main stage. Therefore, further combustion tests were conducted under two operating conditions: <b>ground</b> <b>idle</b> at 7 % maximum take-off thrust and scaled cruise <b>condition.</b> Under <b>ground</b> <b>idle</b> <b>conditions,</b> increased pilot air flow improved the combustion efficiency for high fuel flow, and reduced pilot air flow improved it for low fuel flow.

At an overall combustor fuel/air ratio of 0. 007, fuel zoning reduced THC emissions by a factor of 5 to 1. The reduction in THC emissions is attributed to the increase in local fuel/air ratio provided by the fuel zoning. An alternative method of increasing fuel/air ratio would be to operate with larger-than-normal compressor overboard bleed; however, analysis on this method indicated an increase in idle fuel consumption of 20 percent.

The ethanol–acetaldehyde ratio (by mol) in the exhaust is 6.
