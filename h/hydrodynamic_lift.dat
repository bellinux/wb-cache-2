Landa (1998) argues that the leader of a school constantly changes, because while being in the body of a school gives a hydrodynamic advantage, being the leader means you are the first to the food.|$|E
25|$|Named America and {{launched}} 22 June 1914, trials began {{the following day}} and soon revealed a serious shortcoming in the design: the tendency for {{the nose of the}} aircraft to try to submerge as engine power increased while taxiing on water. This phenomenon had not been encountered before, since Curtiss' earlier designs had not used such powerful engines. In order to counteract this effect, Curtiss fitted fins to the sides of the bow to add <b>hydrodynamic</b> <b>lift,</b> but soon replaced these with sponsons to add more buoyancy. Both prototypes, once fitted with sponsons, were then called Model H-2s incrementally updated alternating in succession. These sponsons would remain a prominent feature of flying boat hull design in the decades to follow. With the problem resolved, preparations for the transatlantic crossing resumed, and 5 August 1914 was selected {{to take advantage of the}} full moon.|$|E

2500|$|The wind, {{current and}} waves {{make up the}} balance of forces for any {{drifting}} object. Sufficient information of these forces {{as well as the}} shape of the drifting object should yield the correct resultant drift of the object. Richardson (1997) and Breivik and Allen (2008) noted that there are aerodynamic and <b>hydrodynamic</b> <b>lift</b> and drag components of the wind and current on the parts of the object exposed to the air and current. Figures 1 & 2 depict the various leeway components. [...] The larger component of leeway drift is the downwind component, which is comparable to the hydrodynamic and aerodynamic drag. It is critical to include the component of drift that is perpendicular to the downwind component called the crosswind component of leeway drift, which is comparable to the hydrodynamic and aerodynamic lift. The crosswind component causes the drift object to diverge from straight downwind direction. The leeway divergence depends upon the search object as well as the environment. Furthermore, the initial orientation of the object relative to the wind will change the path of the object. It is unknown whether the search object will diverge to the right or left of the downwind direction therefore the range of values of leeway divergence is important in determining the actual trajectory.|$|E

Recognition of and adhesion to specific macromolecules is a crucial task of leukocytes to initiate the immune response. To gain statistically reliable information of cell adhesion, large numbers of cells should be measured. However, direct measurement of the adhesion force of single cells is still challenging and today’s techniques typically have an extremely low throughput (5 – 10 cells per day). Here, we introduce a computer controlled micropipette mounted onto a normal inverted microscope for probing single cell interactions with specific macromolecules. We calculated the estimated <b>hydrodynamic</b> <b>lifting</b> force acting on target cells by the numerical simulation of the flow at the micropipette tip. The adhesion force of surface attached cells could be accurately probed by repeating the pick-up process with increasing vacuum applied in the pipette positioned above the cell under investigation. Using the introduced methodology hundreds of cells adhered to specific macromolecules were measured one by one {{in a relatively short}} period of time (, 30 min). We blocked nonspecific cell adhesion by the protein non-adhesive PLL-g-PEG polymer. We found that human primary monocytes are less adherent to fibrinogen than their in vitro differentiated descendants: macrophages and dendritic cells, the latter producing the highest average adhesion force.

It is instructive to know how the mobility and dynamics of rigid microparticles is altered by the presence of micrometer-size roughness on walls. The presented theoretical study addresses this issue via computer simulations. The approach is based on a combination of the Lattice Boltzmann method for calculating hydrodynamics and the Lagrangian Particle dynamics method to describe the dynamics of cell membranes.

40|$|The {{entrapment}} of inclusions, bubbles, slag, {{and other}} particles into solidified steel products is a critically-important quality concern. During continuous casting, particles may enter the mold with the steel {{flowing through the}} submerged nozzle. In addition, mold slag may be entrained from the top surface. A computational model has been developed to simulate the transport and entrapment of particles from both of these sources. The model first computes transient turbulent flow in the mold region using Large Eddy Simulation (LES), with the sub-grid-scale (SGS) k model. Next, the transport and capture of over 30, 000 particles are simulated using a Lagrangian approach to track the trajectories. A new criterion was developed to model particle pushing and capture by a dendritic interface and was incorporated into the particle transport model. Particles smaller than the primary dendrite arm spacing are entrapped if they enter the boundary layer region and touch the solidifying steel shell. Larger particles are entrapped only if they remain stable while the shell grows around them. The new criterion models this by considering a balance of ten different forces which act on a particle in the boundary layer region, including the bulk <b>hydrodynamic</b> forces (<b>lift,</b> pressure gradient, stress gradient, Basset, and added mass forces), transverse drag force, (caused by fluid flow across the dendrite interface), gravity (buoyancy) force, and the forces acting at the interface (Van der Waals interfacial force, lubrication drag force, and surface energy gradient force).

40|$|AbstractThe {{characterization}} of a dielectrophoretic/gravitational field-flow-fractionation (DEP/G-FFF) system using model polystyrene (PS) microbeads is presented. Separations of PS beads of different surface functionalization (COOH and none) and different sizes (6, 10, and 15 μm in diameter) are demonstrated. To investigate the factors influencing separation performance, particle elution times were determined {{as a function}} of particle suspension conductivity, fluid flow rate, and applied field frequency and voltage. Experimental data were analyzed using a previously reported theoretical model and good agreement between theory and experiment was found. It was shown that separation of PS beads was based on the differences in their effective dielectric properties. Particles possessing different dielectric properties were positioned at different heights in a fluid-flow profile in a thin chamber by the balance of DEP and gravitational forces, transported at different velocities {{under the influence of the}} fluid flow, and thereby separated. To explore <b>hydrodynamic</b> (HD) <b>lift</b> effects, velocities of PS beads were determined {{as a function of}} fluid flow rate in the separation chamber when no DEP field was applied. In this case, particle equilibrium height positions were governed solely by the balance of HD lift and gravitational forces. It was concluded that under the experimental conditions reported here, the DEP force was the dominant factor in controlling particle equilibrium height and that HD lift force played little role in DEP/G-FFF operation. Finally, the influence of various experimental parameters on separation performance was discussed for the optimization of DEP/G-FFF...|$|R

This behavior was hypothesized to arise from a thin lubricant overlayer film sandwiched between the droplet and solid substrate, but this has not been observed experimentally. Here, using confocal optical interferometry, we are able to visualize the intercalated film under both static and dynamic conditions. We further demonstrate that the lubricant flow entrained by droplet motion can transform a partially dewetted film into a continuous layer, by generating a sufficient <b>hydrodynamic</b> force to <b>lift</b> the droplet over the solid substrate. The droplet is therefore oleoplaning, akin to tires hydroplaning on a wet road, with minimal dissipative force (down to 0. 1 μN for 1 μl droplet when measured using a cantilever force sensor) and no contact line pinning.

In this paper, the basic gliding model of an underwater glider developed by the Shenyang Institute of Automation (SIA), Chinese Academy of Sciences (CAS) is established, and a class of control strategies are investigated.

To identify the fundamental motion parameters of the underwater glider such as the drag coefficients, we compute the <b>hydrodynamic</b> drag force, <b>lift</b> force and toque as functions of attacking angles using the CFX hydrodynamic computing software. Furthermore, we compute the optimal gliding path angle to achieve the maximum gliding range given battery capacity. We then propose a scheduling strategy to reduce energy consumption in sensors.

The first strategy aims for minimum time and the second aims for the shortest distance reaching the next waypoint, and real-time estimated current are used in both strategies.

40|$|Objectives: Placing {{implants}} in {{the posterior}} maxillary area has the drawback {{of working with}} scarce, poor quality bone in {{a significant percentage of}} cases. Numerous advanced surgical techniques have been developed to overcome the difficulties associated with these limitations. Subsequent to reports on the elevation of the maxillary sinus through the lateral approach, there were reports {{on the use of the}} crestal approach, which is less aggressive but requires a minimal amount of bone. Furthermore, it is more sensitive to operator technique, as the integrity of the sinus membrane is checked indirectly. The aim of this paper is to review the technical literature on minimally invasive sinus lift and compare the advantages of different techniques with Intralift?, a new technique. Study Design: The present study is a review of techniques used to perform minimally invasive sinus lift published in Cochrane, Embase and Medline over the past ten years and the description of the crestal sinus lift technique based on minimally invasive piezosurgery, with the example of a case report. Results: Only eight articles were found on minimally invasive techniques for sinus lift. The main advantage of this new technique, Intralift, is that it does not require a minimum amount of crestal bone (indeed, the smaller the width of the crestal bone, the better this technique is performed). The possibility of damage to the sinus membrane is minimised by using ultrasound based <b>hydrodynamic</b> pressure to <b>lift</b> it, while applying a very non-aggressive crestal approach.

The initial deposition rates increased linearly with particle concentrations in suspensions as expected from theoretical mass transport calculations. Deposition efficiencies of 0. 78 and 0. 62 were obtained for wall shear rates, G, of 15 and 50 s(- 1), respectively. Blocked areas, A(1) expressed {{as the number of}} particle cross sections, gamma, decreased from initially high to low values (A(1,G= 15) = 10 and A(1,G= 50) = 18, at infinite particle concentration) {{as a function of the}} particle concentration. This decrease in blocked area with particle concentration was explained as a consequence of the increased backscattering of flowing particles colliding with adhering particles. Backscattering due to collisions between flowing particles is obviously more frequent at higher Concentrations. Blocked areas, calculated using pair distribution functions, corresponded well with those obtained from deposition kinetics. Initial desorption rate coefficients, beta(0) ranging from 0. 3 x 10 (- 3) to 2. 0 x 10 (- 3) s(- 1), increased linearly with particle concentration in suspension due to an increase in the number of collisions between adhering and flowing particles per unit time. The final desorption rate coefficients, beta(infinity,) ranging from 0. 002 x 10 (- 3) to 0. 01 x 10 (- 3) s(- 1), and the relaxation time, 1 /delta, of the desorption rate coefficient, ranging from 50 to 1000 s, decreased as a function of the particle concentration because, as the effective interaction potential minimum is not the same for each adhering particle, weakly adhering particles will be removed first.
