40|$|The {{most common}} {{operations}} in food industries where grains are handled, thus producing combustible dusts, are grinding, drying, transport in bucket <b>elevators</b> <b>and</b> <b>conveyors,</b> pneumatic transport, filtering, and storage in silos. Unfortunately, these operations {{all too often}} give rise to fires or explosions with catastrophic consequences. Spontaneous combustion must {{be considered to be}} a potential ignition source for a dust or gas explosion every time a large mass of combustible dust comes in contact with air. In this paper we present a methodological approach to the characterization of combustible products (grains, pellets, dusts, etc) with respect to self-heating and fermentation and give results for certain agricultural dusts. Our method includes the use of modeling and various laboratory tests such as Thermal Differential Analysis coupled with Thermo-Gravimetric Analysis (DTA-TGA), Isothermal Oven Tests (at ambient pressure and elevated pressure), and Adiabatic Calorimetry. The objective of these tests is not only to rank the various products by order of reactivity but to determine under which conditions a given product will pose a threat of spontaneous combustion...|$|E

40|$|Abstract: This article {{presents}} the design system for high efficiency gantry crane system using <b>elevator</b> <b>and</b> <b>conveyor</b> system. The basic concept {{for the proposed}} gantry crane system {{can be used with}} modification of the classical gantry crane instead of changing lots of them. However, the proposed crane system can reduce the cycle time more than the classical gantry crane. The high efficiency gantry crane can also improve the productivity of the container transportation job because of reducing cycle time. In order to achieve the effectiveness of the proposed design system, the loading and unloading capabilities are compared with the classical crane, and then these results show that the proposed crane system has better performances than the classical type.

50|$|Internal {{infrastructure}} {{which remains}} at the place includes the facility's plant consisting of an engine connected by a drive wheel to the drive shaft and all associated elements to attach it to {{the ceiling of the}} receiving shed. Not inspected but also present are the <b>elevators</b> <b>and</b> <b>conveyor</b> belts (housed in the shed but in a largely disassembled state) and the intact maize sorting / grading machine, regarded as remnant machinery s, and located on the mezzanine floor of the grain receiving building, approximately 5 metres above ground level and its camel haired conveyor belt. The truck despatch and receiving entrance is also extant. The access ladder used to enter the underground passageway, was extant although unusable located inside the maize receiving shed.|$|R
5|$|Certain {{high-performance}} applications involve four-quadrant loads (Quadrants I to IV) {{where the}} speed and torque can be in any direction such as in hoists, <b>elevators,</b> <b>and</b> hilly <b>conveyors.</b> Regeneration can occur only in the drive's DC link bus when inverter voltage is smaller in magnitude than the motor back-EMF and inverter voltage and back-EMF are the same polarity.|$|R
40|$|Electrical drives play an {{important}} role in rapidly growing industrial era, so the controlling of electrical drives is also important. Variable speed drives are the major part of power system, microelectronic, power plant and so on. Conventional controlling methods of electrical drives needed mathematical model of control process which was very tedious, that problem is solved by artificial intelligence which contains both hard computation and soft computation. Artificial intelligence has found high application in most nonlinear systems same as motor drive. As no mathematical model is needed for artificial intelligent system so efficiency and reliability of drives increase and volume, weight and cost of drives decrease. Soft starters are widely used with electronic motor as it provides improved operating characteristics and better control. Soft starter also reduces the wear and tear effects on motor and their associated drive systems which in turn reduces maintenance, conserve energy and plays a significant part in improving system performance so the escalators, pumps, <b>elevators</b> <b>and</b> <b>conveyor</b> belts can be operated more effectively with soft starter...|$|R

40|$|Variable speed drives {{are growing}} and varying. Drives expanse depend on {{progress}} in {{different part of}} science like power system, microelectronic, control methods, and so on. Artificial intelligent contains hard computation and soft computation. Artificial intelligent has found high application in most nonlinear systems same as motors drive. Because artificial intelligent techniques can use as controller for any system without requirement to system mathematical model, {{it has been used}} in electrical drive control. With this manner, efficiency and reliability of drives increase and volume, weight and cost of them decrease. Due to the improved operating characteristics they give to the equipment control, electronic motor soft starters are increasingly widely applied. Escalators, pumps, <b>elevators</b> <b>and</b> <b>conveyor</b> belts all operate more effectively if they are soft started. However, it is not simply the ergonomics of an airport, process plant or shopping mall that are improved by soft starters. A major factor in the growth in popularity of soft starters is the reduced wear and tear that they place on motors and their associated drive systems. In turn, this reduces maintenance, conserves energy and plays a significant part in improving plant performance and operating costs...|$|R

5000|$|Jamie King {{joined the}} tour on 2 May 2008 in Manchester, England. Before that date, {{the show was}} not on a central stage (except in Japan) for {{logistics}} reasons. After {{two and a half}} months, Dion rehearsed again to perfect the show for the [...] "in the round" [...] setup. Because of Dion's bilingual career and the restrictions of certain arenas and stadiums on the tour, King had to direct and choreograph three separate shows. One show featured a set-list mostly of English-language songs, and was performed in-the-round using the full system of mobile screens, <b>elevators,</b> <b>and</b> <b>conveyor</b> belts. A second show also featured the center stage arrangement, but included about ten French language songs for performances in Francophone countries. A third, less complex show was used where the center stage arrangement would not fit into the venue or where it would be impractical to transport the stage. An end stage setup was used in these cases, and featured a massive central video screen and a lighting system that engulfed the stage in brilliant blue and red from above on all three sides. Before the European leg, the central and end stage setups were redone, changing lights and cues, in order for the three separate shows to fit in these two stages. Dion premiered new costumes when the European tour began.|$|R

5000|$|In 1906 major {{additions}} were commenced. In {{addition to}} the two malthouses, there {{was already on the}} site a brewery tower (erected [...] ) and residential accommodation. The additions costing £6,999 were designed and supervised by Toowoomba architect Harry Marks of James Marks and Son. They comprised the erection of a new malthouse and kilns which were linked to the 1899 malthouse and the conversion of the existing brewery tower to a high water storage reservoir. The new malthouse included steeping tanks, a large polished cement germinating floor, two kilns, malt dressing rooms, and a number of pine storage bins. <b>Elevators</b> <b>and</b> a <b>conveyor</b> belt, which traversed the length of the building, transported the grain in its various stages. The malt storage chamber was fitted with 38 Marks patented reversible casement windows and a number of Marks's roof ventilators. Special kiln top ventilators were also designed by Marks, who was described as being gifted with inventive genius. The new complex, described as the biggest in the Commonwealth, was opened on 1 June 1907. The contractor was Montague Ivory with the plastering (including the cement germinating floor) by WJ Waldron, ironwork by the Toowoomba Foundry, and plumbing by Partridge and Co.|$|R
