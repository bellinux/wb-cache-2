40|$|In {{this paper}} we {{describe}} {{a novel approach}} for searching large data sets from a mobile phone. Existing interfaces for mobile search require <b>keyword</b> text <b>entry</b> and are not suited for browsing. Our alternative uses a hybrid model to deemphasize tedious <b>keyword</b> <b>entry</b> in favor of iterative data filtering. We propose navigation and selection of hierarchical metadata (facet navigation), with incremental text entry to further narrow the results. We conducted a formative evaluation to understand the relative advantages of <b>keyword</b> <b>entry</b> versus facet navigation for both browse and search tasks on the phone. We found <b>keyword</b> <b>entry</b> to be more powerful when {{the name of the}} search target is known, while facet navigation is otherwise more effective and strongly preferred.

40|$|Purpose: A {{computational}} {{system was}} developed for this paper in the C++ programming language, to create a 125 I radioactive seed <b>entry</b> <b>file,</b> based on the positioning of a virtual grid (template) in voxel geometries, {{with the purpose of}} performing prostate cancer treatment simulations using the MCNPX code. Methods: The system is fed with information from the planning system with regard to each seed’s location and its depth, and an <b>entry</b> <b>file</b> is automatically created with all the cards (instructions) for each seed regarding their cell blocks and surfaces spread out spatially in the 3 D environment. The system provides with precision a reproduction of the clinical scenario for the MCNPX code’s simulation environment, thereby allowing the technique’s in-depth study. Results and Conclusion: The preliminary results from this study showed that the lateral penumbra of uniform scanning proton beams was less sensitive In order to validate the computational system, an <b>entry</b> <b>file</b> was created with 88 125 I seeds that were inserted in the phantom’s MAX 06 prostate region with initial activity determined for the seeds at the 0. 27 mCi value. Isodose curves were obtained in all the prostate slices in 5 mm steps in the 7 to 10 cm interval, totaling 7 slices. Variance reduction techniques were applied in order to optimize computational time and the reduction of uncertainties such as photon and electron energy interruptions in 4 keV and forced collisions regarding cells of interest. Through the acquisition of isodose curves, the results obtained show that hot spots have values above 300 Gy, as anticipated in literature, stressing the importance of the sources’ correct positioning, in which the computational system developed provides, in order not to release excessive doses in adjacent risk organs. The 144 Gy prescription curve showed in the validation process that it covers perfectly {{a large percentage of the}} volume, at the same time that it demonstrates a large decline for short distances.

Thus Beta BASIC provided a new and improved CLI and editor. It supported Sinclair's idiosyncratic single-key entry system for BASIC keywords but also allowed keywords to be spelled out letter-for-letter. This also removed the necessity for memorising the sometimes arcane key combinations necessary to enter less-commonly-used BASIC keywords. However, the single-key entry system was also extended by mapping the Spectrum's 'graphics' characters to Beta BASIC's new keywords. To switch from <b>keyword</b> <b>entry</b> to typed entry, it was merely necessary to type a single space, causing the cursor mode to change from K (keyword) to L (lowercase) or C (capital).

An automated solution identifies common entry errors such as incorrect tariff numbers, product description, and country of origin. With a solution in place, companies {{have the ability to}} identify missing or inaccurate data on the entry virtually immediately after the <b>entry</b> have been <b>filed.</b> Having visibility this soon allows the company to determine the root cause of the error, take the steps both internally and externally to correct the errors, and to report the errors soon after the error is filed instead of months after, reducing the chance of customs withholding shipments and causing delays.|$|R

40|$|OVERVIEW: As the {{functionality}} of AV equipment improves and {{the number}} of TV broadcast channels increases, the era in which we “can’t pick and can’t watch ” our preferred programs is approaching. In addressing this problem, Hitachi has developed an “intelligent user interface”—which uses “multimodal dialog control ” to help users (i. e. viewers) operate home AV equipment by means of spoken dialog. Integrating speech information processing, image information processing, and a TV program recommender based on viewing-history analysis, this multimodal dialog control can partake in dialog with the viewer. Without the need for <b>keyword</b> <b>entry,</b> the TV program recommender automatically analyzes the viewer’s program preferences from their past viewing history, and then selects, recommends, and records certain programs according to the analysis results. Utilizing voice information processing, this intelligent user interface can operate AV devices via spoken dialog very close to everyday conversation. It can also distinguish different viewers by facial image recognition and automatically change the offered services (such as the TV program recommender) to match the preferences of whoever is in front of the TV...|$|R
