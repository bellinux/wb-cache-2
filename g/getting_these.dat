25|$|Cantwell has {{expressed}} support for making Plan B contraceptives available to girls 16 and under. In 2007, she cosponsored the Prevention First Act, a bill that sought to increase national access to family planning and preventative methods {{as a means to}} reduce unwanted pregnancies. It included providing women with access to Plan B as well as expanding family planning to be covered under Medicaid. As an advocate of increasing access to family planning and sexual health education, Cantwell argues that these venues for increased education are necessary {{to reduce the number of}} unwanted pregnancies. She received criticism from her Republican challenger, State Senator Michael Baumgartner, who suggested that Cantwell was too extreme and too far to the left of most Washington voters on this issue, and expressed concern about 11-year-olds <b>getting</b> <b>these</b> drugs without a prescription.|$|E
25|$|Montezuma Castle was a {{relatively}} uncontroversial site, being small, remote, and not heavily (or at least profitably) exploited by either the pot hunters or agriculture in the vicinity, some temporary de facto restrictions on the pot hunting having already come into being before the monument was created. It was therefore a good test case for Hewett's vision as embodied in the Antiquities Act, and creation of the national monument caused comparatively few complaints. Another site closer to home that Hewett had studied, at today's Gila Cliff Dwellings National Monument in southwestern New Mexico, would soon follow, {{and by the end}} of 1907, Chaco Canyon itself had been made a national monument, thus preserving the most extensive site of ruins of the Pueblo culture. However, Hewett was not satisfied; he had his eye on other extensive and significant candidates for preservation, notably his long-time favorites on the Pajarito Plateau, that promised to be more controversial. He therefore turned his attention to the problems of <b>getting</b> <b>these</b> sites preserved, as the number of national monuments created under the Antiquities Act began to climb.|$|E

500|$|Ray Winstone plays George [...] "Mac" [...] McHale, a British agent whom Jones worked {{alongside}} in World War II, but has now {{allied with}} the Soviets to resolve financial problems. The character acts as a spin on Sallah and René Belloq – Jones's friend and nemesis, respectively, in Raiders of the Lost Ark. Spielberg cast Winstone as he found him [...] "one of the most brilliant actors around", having seen Sexy Beast. Winstone tore his hamstring during filming. [...] "I keep <b>getting</b> <b>these</b> action parts as I’m getting older", he remarked. Like John Hurt, Winstone wished to see the script prior to committing to the film. In interviews on British TV Winstone {{explained that he was}} only able to read the script if it was delivered by courier, who waited while he read the script, and returned to the U.S. with the script once Winstone had read it. His reasoning for wanting to read the script was, [...] "If I'm gonna be in it, I want to be in it." [...] He gave suggestions to Spielberg, including the idea of Mac pretending to be a double agent. He also stated that once filming was completed he had to return the script, such was the secrecy about the film. He was later presented with a copy of the script to keep.|$|E
2500|$|The {{costs of}} the royal house {{continued}} to be controversial; the parliamentary opposition succeeded in <b>getting</b> <b>these</b> more transparent, and somewhat confine them. A growing {{percentage of the population}} indicated they desired a purely ceremonial kingship, and in the House, several parliamentary groups made efforts to confine the formal and informal powers of the monarch, and to reduce the royal house's subsidies. The most important step in this direction was taken during the 2012 government formation, when the House itself took the initiative to appoint a [...] "scout" [...] (verkenner), and later two informateurs, bringing the traditional privilege of the monarch to lead the cabinet formation to an end. The inauguration of Ministers and State Secretaries, too, was conducted in public for the first time for the sake of transparency, despite objections by queen Beatrix.|$|E

2500|$|In January 2009, Sharon {{went to the}} Abbott cabin to {{have time}} for herself after the {{breakdown}} of her marriage to Jack. Nick showed up because Noah was ice-skating and fell, suffering hypothermia. After becoming trapped in the cabin during a blizzard, Nick found a letter Sharon wrote to him (but didn't intend to show him) which professed her undying love for him. He confronted her and they made love. Prior to this, Brad {{had come to the}} cabin to profess his love for Sharon. On his way out, he ended up dying by saving Noah from the ice. Discussing the plot, Case said that Sharon wants Nick [...] "more than anyone" [...] but would only have him under [...] "certain terms" [...] which includes him leaving Phyllis. Additionally, she said that she wouldn't want Nick and Sharon reunite if there wasn't any conflict. That April, they were at the cabin again searching for Noah and ended up making love, resulting in Sharon becoming pregnant. During an interview with The Daily News Case said that Nick constantly changing his mind whether to be with Sharon or Phyllis [...] "throws everything into a spin" [...] and causes Sharon to make her decisions [...] "all over again because she has new information". Also weighing in on the reunion, Morrow told TV Guide: [...] "The fans have wanted {{this for a long time}} [...] it is going to be a very messy journey <b>getting</b> <b>these</b> two back together as a solid couple, but I am sure it will happen." [...] Sharon briefly lied about the baby's paternity because of Summer becoming ill, and stated that Jack was the father. The truth came out, but Faith [...] "died" [...] at birth, Nick and Sharon grieved the loss of their child.|$|E
