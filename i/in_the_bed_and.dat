5|$|Inside {{their hotel}} room, Spears {{and her boyfriend}} start {{screaming}} at each other. When he tries to make amends and get close to her, she brushes off his attempts and walks away. Her boyfriend gets mad and then throws a vase at the wall while Spears goes into the bathroom, hurling something at the mirror. She begins to fill the bathtub and remove her clothes. After this, the video includes intercut scenes of a close-up of Spears singing in a white shirt {{in front of a}} bright white light. As she lies in the bathtub, a red string, a custom associated with Kabbalah is seen in her wrist. She touches her head and looks at her hand, realizing she is bleeding from the wound. According to Jennifer Vineyard of MTV, the blood in her hand is stigmata. She loses consciousness in the bathtub and drowns. Shortly after, her boyfriend finds her and tries to resuscitate her. Meanwhile, it is revealed that in the close-up scenes Spears is actually inside a hospital hallway. The video continues with scenes of her being carried into an ambulance and surrounded by photographers, as well as scenes of her being resuscitated by doctors in a hospital bed. The ghost of Spears in a white shirt, watches herself <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>bed</b> <b>and</b> walks into the next room, where a baby girl is born. Spears is then seen running away from the camera into the light. The music video ends with her rising from under the water, resting her head and smiling, suggesting the whole scene of her death was a dream or a morbid fantasy.|$|E

500|$|Sly Stone mostly {{worked on}} There's a Riot Goin' On {{alone in a}} studio that he had built for himself at The Plant Studios, also known as The Record Plant, in Sausalito, California, or at his home studio in the loft of his Bel Air mansion. He would often lie down <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>bed</b> <b>and</b> record his vocals with a {{wireless}} microphone system. According to the other Family Stone members, most of the album was performed by him alone, overdubbing and sometimes using a drum machine. Other band members contributed by overdubbing alone with Sly instead of playing together as before. For [...] "Family Affair" [...] and some other selections Stone enlisted several other musicians including Billy Preston, Ike Turner, and Bobby Womack instead of his bandmates, and several female vocalists mostly omitted from the final mix.|$|E
500|$|According to Anderson's account, {{the first}} of the stories that became Winesburg, Ohio ({{probably}} [...] "The Book of the Grotesque") was composed, {{on the spur of the}} moment, in the middle of the night, probably while he was staying on the third floor of a rooming house at [...] in Chicago: [...] "...it was a late fall night and raining...I was there naked <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>bed</b> <b>and</b> I sprang up. I went to my typewriter and began to write. It was there, under those circumstances, myself sitting near an open window, the rain occasionally blowing in and wetting my bare back, that I did my first writing...I wrote it, as I wrote them all, complete in the one sitting...The rest of the stories in the book came out of me on succeeding evenings, and sometimes during the day while I worked in the advertising office..." [...] Study of his manuscripts shows that, though it is probably true that most of the stories were written within a relatively short span of time in late 1915, like a number of facts in Anderson's retelling of his writing process (for instance, his claim that he had written the Winesburg, Ohio stories after his earlier books were already published), it is inaccurate to say that the final versions of the stories published in 1919 were exactly the same as the ones written whole four years earlier.|$|E

2500|$|Between Dorking and Leatherhead the Mole cuts a steep-sided valley {{through the}} North Downs, {{creating}} a [...] river cliff {{on the western}} flank of Box Hill. The bedrock is permeable chalk and the water table lies permanently {{below the level of}} the riverbed, allowing water to drain out of the river through swallow holes <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>bed</b> <b>and</b> banks. The amount of water lost from the river is significant and in very hot summers the channel can become dry between Mickleham and Thorncroft Manor; this was recorded most recently in 1949 and 1976. At Leatherhead, the river leaves the chalk and flows across impermeable London Clay. At this point that the water table rises enough for the water to flow back into the main river channel.|$|E
2500|$|Taylor then won the Gibraltar Darts Trophy. He dropped {{just seven}} {{legs in the}} six matches he played which {{concluded}} with a 6–1 victory over Jamie Lewis in the final. However, Taylor's win in Gibraltar was later the subject of controversy as footage emerged showing him winning a leg and retrieving his dart when he had actually missed the double. Neither referee Russ Bray nor his opponent Dean Winstanley noticed the error and Taylor {{went on to win}} the match 6–1. Taylor insisted that he had not realised that the dart had missed and offered to replay the match and forfeit his prize money. The PDC released a statement blaming the incident on human error. The incident led to a feud with Taylor's old mentor Eric Bristow who stated: [...] "The player knows if it's not <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>bed</b> <b>and</b> has to declare it. You don't want cheats in the game". Taylor responded by claiming that Bristow's comments were [...] "hurtful" [...] and that he would not be talking to Bristow again.|$|E

2500|$|Between Dorking and Leatherhead the Mole cuts a steep-sided valley (the Mole Gap) {{though the}} North Downs, carving a [...] river cliff {{on the western}} flank of Box Hill and a smaller [...] cliff at Ham Bank in Norbury Park. The sudden change from {{impermeable}} Wealden Clay to permeable chalk and the increased gradient of the river (which drops 15m in the six mile (10km) stretch between Brockham and Leatherhead, compared to 3m in [...] between Horley and Brockham) allow the water table to drop below {{the bed of the}} river. Water is able to flow out of the river through swallow holes <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>bed</b> <b>and</b> banks, decreasing the volume of water carried in the main channel. The course of the river through Norbury Park was partially straightened when the Epsom to Horsham railway was built in 1837, with the removal of a small meander north of Westhumble. The meander was reinstated in 1997, in an attempt to enhance this area of the Park, although it has since become blocked by silt. The entirety of the Mole Gap lies within the Surrey Hills Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty.|$|E
