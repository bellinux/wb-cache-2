50|$|Oswald Jozef Leroy (Passendale, Belgium, 1936) is a Belgian {{mathematician}} {{known for}} his contributions to theoretical acousto-optics. Leroy's biggest achievement was a theoretical study of the interaction of light with two adjacent <b>ultrasonic</b> <b>beams</b> under different conditions in terms of beam shape, frequency content and intensity. Understanding of this phenomenon was very important in the 1970s when new acousto-optic devices were developed (mainly due to novel developments in laser technology) that utilized adjacent <b>ultrasonic</b> <b>beams.</b> Such devices were being used in optical modulators, optical scanners, information processing, optical filtering and frequency-spectrum analysis. Before his contribution only the interaction of light with one <b>ultrasonic</b> <b>beam</b> was understood.

40|$|This article {{explains}} how a multi-frequency <b>ultrasonic</b> <b>beam</b> path is split due to passing through dispersive {{materials and the}} implications that it has in flow measurement using a Clamp-on ultrasonic flowmeter. The importance of knowing this phenomenon is because dispersive materials are commonly used {{in the manufacture of}} transducer wedges and plastic pipes. Splitting of the <b>ultrasonic</b> <b>beam</b> path occurs when the incident angle is not normal {{to the surface of the}} pipe and a coupling wedge is necessary. The diffraction angle is produced at the boundaries among materials with different propagation velocities (according to Snell’s law), and furthermore, in dispersive materials, the propagation speed depends on frequency. Therefore, when the excitation signal contains several frequential components, each frequency travels with a different velocity. Under this circumstance, different diffraction angles are produced for each frequency at the boundaries between materials. As a result of splitting the path, the <b>ultrasonic</b> <b>beam</b> widens and the reception transducer aperture becomes too small to receive all the frequential components contained in the <b>ultrasonic</b> <b>beam.</b> Thus, when the <b>ultrasonic</b> <b>beam</b> is carried by the liquid flowing inside the pipe, the reception transducer receives different frequential contributions, producing change in its spectral composition. As a consequence of the mixing of these frequencies, the reception signal is modulated in phase and amplitude. Moreover, modulation will change as a function of frequential composition that is combined at the reception transducer. This is the origin of the linearity error in Clamp-on ultrasonic flowmeters.

40|$|Developing a {{quantitative}} understanding of <b>ultrasonic</b> <b>beam</b> propagation in engineering {{materials such as}} Ti- 6 A 1 - 4 V is important because flaw signals can be altered greatly by the macrostructure that the <b>ultrasonic</b> <b>beam</b> propagates through between the transducer and the flaw. Two consequences of the macrostructure are particularly important: 1) back scattered noise which competes with flaw signals and 2) forward scattered signals and the associated beam profile fluctuations which can modulate the strength of flaw signals [1, 2, 3], These effects are particularly important when <b>ultrasonic</b> <b>beams</b> are used to detect subtle defects such as unvoided, uncracked hard-alpha inclusions (regions with a high content of interstitial nitrogen or oxygen), because the flaw signal is inherently weak due to a small mismatch of acoustic impedance. Each of these effects {{is controlled by the}} inherently complex macrostructure which develops during routine processing. Current theories suggest that the most important physical feature which controls noise is the two-point correlation of elastic constants, which is in turn controlled by local variations in crystallographic orientation [4]. Therefore, in order to quantify the effects of the macrostructure on <b>ultrasonic</b> <b>beam</b> propagation, one must determine the elastic constants on a microscopic level with length scales less than the ultrasonic wavelength, approximately 600 μm at 10 MHz...|$|R

40|$|Background: The {{anatomical}} substrate for the mid-mural ventricular hyperechogenic zone remains uncertain, but it {{may represent}} no more than ultrasound reflected from cardiomyocytes orientated orthogonally to the <b>ultrasonic</b> <b>beam.</b> We sought to ascertain {{the relationship between the}} echogenic zone and the orientation of the cardiomyocytes. Methods: We used 3 D echocardiography, diffusion tensor imaging, and microcomputed tomography to analyze the location and orientation of cardiomyocytes within the echogenic zone. Results: We demonstrated that visualization of the echogenic zone is dependent on the position of the transducer and is most clearly seen from the apical window. Diffusion tensor imaging and microcomputed tomography show that the echogenic zone seen from the apical window corresponds to the position of the circumferentially orientated cardiomyocytes. An oblique band seen in the parasternal view relates to cardiomyocytes orientated orthogonally to the <b>ultrasonic</b> <b>beam.</b> Conclusions: The mid-mural ventricular hyperechogenic zone represents reflected ultrasound from cardiomyocytes aligned orthogonal to the <b>ultrasonic</b> <b>beam.</b> The echogenic zone does not represent a space, a connective tissue sheet, a boundary between ascending and descending limbs of a hypothetical helical ventricular myocardial band, nor an abrupt change in cardiomyocyte orientation...|$|R
