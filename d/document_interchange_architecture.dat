40|$|Significant {{progress}} has been made in the area of final form document description with Postscript emerging as a de facto standard. Some {{progress has}} been made on the translation of page description languages [...] Postscript to Interpress and Interpress to Postscript. However, these developments are of no assistance in the sharing of documents that may need to be revised. The ISO OSI standards for revisable form <b>documents</b> <b>interchange</b> continue to evolve with the Standard Generalized Markup Language, the Office Document Architecture, and the Office <b>document</b> <b>Interchange</b> Format offering great promise for the future. While the ultimate solution to <b>document</b> <b>interchange</b> is universal acceptance of an interchange standard, some intermediate solution is required to meet the needs that exist today. It is in this context that document conversion systems are considered. The approaches to conversion fall in two broad categories. The first category includes systems that hard code each conversion. The second category of system rely on an intermediate metalanguage [...] a standard. This paper describes a hybrid system for converting files created by one text processing system to a format suitable for another. The discussions covers the design principles for an extended machine and table driven approach. Tables allow for user involvement in customizing and developing new conversions while an extended machine allows for logical and arithmetic control of the conversion. The paper describes the kinds of copymarks found in text files, sets out the scope of what a copymark conversion engine must do, describes how various approaches tackle the problem, and describes how the conversion engine produced accomplishes these goals...|$|R

40|$|With {{the growth}} in the spread of {{computer}} networks the demand by users for <b>document</b> <b>interchange</b> features is becoming increasingly apparent. The prerequirement for the realization of <b>document</b> <b>interchange</b> in a heterogenous computer environment are internationally accepted standards for the description of documents. Already in early 1986, the Standard Generalized Markup Language SGML was published as an international standard for the structuring of documents. The publication of the Office Document Architecture ODA is expected in the course of 1988. The final text is already available. ODA was originally developed for the pure office environment, whereas the concept for SGML addressed the author/publisher environment. This fact is mirrored in the current pilot projects testing the standards: the manufacturers of office and word-processing systems mainly work with ODA, whereas in the technical scientific and publishing sectors SGML is often implemented. Users requiring an interface both to the office sector {{as well as to the}} publishing sector will therefore be confronted with the problems related to working with two different, only partially compatible standards...|$|R

The DPRC has made very good progress this quarter, and has also begun several new projects with potential benefits for the declassification community. After significant delays, work is now progressing well on the Federal Intelligent Document Understanding Laboratory (FIDUL) project. The DPRC has become a familiar, respected member of the declassification community because of its efforts in the Declassification Productivity Management Council`s (DPMC`s) Automation Working Group (AWG). The DPRC provided a lead role and coordinating efforts in delivery of the AWG Electronic <b>Document</b> <b>Interchange</b> Standard (EDIS), and the associated (DPTC developed) (1) <b>Document</b> <b>Interchange</b> System (DIS) and (2) Document Review/Redaction System (DRS).

The DPRC has also moved into a bigger facility at the GWU Virginia campus, which provides more space for expansion and for setting up the long envisioned DPRC Declassification Test Laboratory. Finally, the DPRC has also helped to develop a World Wide Web-based design concept and an operational prototype database system for one-stop coordination of multi-agency equity reviews.
