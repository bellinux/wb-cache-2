Modern business management has not been applied in terms of aspects of production, utilization of human resources, and marketing and financial management. This study aimed to determine the capacity of human resources (management or business owners) in managing HFI in Bone Regency, as well as development efforts that can be done to improve their capacity. The results showed that the main products produced by HFI in Bone Regency were ranging from traditional foods (traditional cakes) to modern food (nuggets, meatballs, milkfish presto etc.). The capacity of human resources in managing HFI is limited in several important aspects, Financial management was not designed well; for example, production costs were not calculated in a careful, complete, thorough, and precise manner; so that the benefit was not known or could not be predicted with certainty. Marketing management was weak in providing a good product identity name, brand, and expiration date. In terms of production management production plan was not designed well, so sometimes the <b>excessive</b> <b>stocks</b> spoiled before being sold, and sometimes they ran out of supplies, meaning they could not meet consumers' demands. The over and under-productions affected the overall benefit generated from the business operation.

40|$|Because of the {{transformation}} from a seller's to a buyer's market and the increasing globalization of markets, companies now must compete internationally for potential customers and orders. At the same time, markets are characterized by constantly changing customer needs. Companies that {{want to continue to}} operate successfully in such a turbulent environment must differentiate themselves by having extremely flexible production systems. The high costs of the production resources employed require a high level of capacity utilization, so that the company's production will be profitable even with dynamic utilization rates and changing product lines. Within this context, effective peripheral systems, such as the operating resources system, take on added importance, in order to guarantee a high availability of jobs. When endeavoring to ensure full availability in a flexible production system, a lack of information often leads to <b>excessive</b> <b>stocks</b> of mobile operating resources (tools, machines, measuring equipment). The resulting costs directly affect the profitability of the entire system. Thus, the purpose of this assignment was to draft a design for gathering contextual information on resource engineering and the practicability thereof by means of a prototypical implementation. Consequently, in contrast to previous, popular administration systems, the management of master data for a pre-existing operating resources system is not a priority. Instead, the focus of the work is on the management of dynamic information. In the process, already existing functions will be retained and expanded, using contextual information.

40|$|A partial {{equilibrium}} {{framework is}} used to estimate the deadweight loss arising from government intervention in the U. S. rice market {{in order to protect}} domestic producers. The efficiency of the rice program is compared to other grain programs. Deadweight losses relative to taxpayer and consumer costs from rice programs in recent years were only slightly higher compared to the same measure associated with major commodity programs. The primary source of deadweight losses in rice programs result from set-asides. The potential savings from completely decoupling the rice program are estimated to reach $ 387 million for 1987. Key words: acreage control, deadweight loss, decoupling, rice programs. Commodity programs that tie producers ' sup-port to production decisions are becoming a ma-jor issue in designing the programs. Current dis-cussions of planting flexibility and decoupling are examples. The point of these discussions is to move producers away from making produc-tion decisions in response to the program and to facilitate their response to market signals. The goal is to avoid the necessity of using large set-asides to reduce the buildup of <b>excessive</b> <b>stocks,</b> and thereby to increase the efficiency in income transfer from taxpayers and consumers to pro-ducers. The marketing loan provision of the Food Se-curity Act of 1985 reflects market orientation on the demand side of the market by virtually elim-inating government management of stocks. Freezing a payment yield and determining base acreage at the previous five-year-moving aver-age is a limited decoupling on the supply side. In addition, the 50 / 92 underplanting provision of current rice programs further decouples pro-duction decisions from program payments-rice growers who underplant their permitted acreage by planting between 50 % and 92 % of the per-mitted acreage and devote the remaining acre...|$|E

These new retailers have adopted advanced technologies or efficient techniques {{to manage their}} inventories so as to attain the competitive performance. A case study, Bangphaialaiyont is one of auto parts retailers, which has confronted inventory problems for many years. This paper identifies the major root causes of high percentage of absent stocks and <b>excessive</b> <b>stocks</b> problem, focuses on the utilisation of inventory models which can eliminate these root causes by applying to three families of auto parts namely fast moving, slow moving and seasonal products, proposes the implementation of Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) system used to develop and redesign inventory management of this retailer, and suggests the further beneficial systems or techniques to significantly improve competitive performance. Diagnosis of this inventory problem already carried out in form of the fishbone diagram, analysis of inventory model adoption is examined in three distinct parts, including (s, Q) system for fast moving products, (R, S- 1, S) system for slow moving products, and Newsvendor model for seasonal products, and then eventually the most important findings and additional recommendations are highlighted. With regard to redesigning inventory management, it is concluded {{that the combination of}} inventory models application and ERP implementation results in managing inventory more efficiently, thus the business owner enables to obtain huge profitability such as eliminating root causes of inventory problems, reducing enormous inventory costs, and maintaining the high level of customers’ satisfaction.

40|$|The Instron Corporation in Canton, MA, {{manufactures}} {{material testing}} systems. These systems {{are used to}} evaluate the tensile strength of metals, plastics, composites, textiles, and other materials by holding a test sample at each end with a mechanical "grip," pulling in opposite directions, and measuring the applied forces. This thesis describes the efforts of a project improvement team chartered to dramatically reduce inventory for a variety of mechanical grips without increasing cycle time or component fabrication costs. The author developed optimization techniques, queuing theory models, and simulation tools to guide the improvement efforts. The project team achieved a thirty-percent reduction in grip inventory in six months by consolidating redundant supply chains, changing from a make-to-stock to a make-to-order process, and changing from material resource planning to pull production. The inventory reduction increased the inventory turns from less than two to over four turns per year. Strategic inventory placement models suggested the problem could be split into two separate approaches: (1) managing the capacity of the job shop to meet the increased demand from supply chain consolidation; and (2) developing a control system for component and raw material inventories. The analysis of the capacity of the grip assembly job shop uses optimization techniques to specify the assembly lot sizes for the various grips and queuing theory to estimate the reserve capacity required to maintain cycle times under probabilistic demand. Simulations of the job shop assembly process validate the analysis and resource management plan. The continuous review control system specifies reorder points and order quantities for the hundreds of detail components and raw materials. The team's efforts are expected to reduce inventory by a similar amount in the coming months as <b>excessive</b> <b>stocks</b> are consumed. Recommendations for further reductions include improved component outsourcing, disposition of slow-moving inventory, and optimization of safety stock levels. Implementation of these recommendations will lead to inventory reductions of similar magnitude. by Daniel H. Wheeler. Thesis (S. M.)

40|$|This article {{provides}} an analytical {{discussion of the}} adjustment to EU accession for an economy under alternative assumptions about monetary policy rules. The post-accession phase is characterized by rapid capital inflows and real exchange rate appreciation. If accession is combined with membership of the euro area and a pegged exchange rate, then the post-accession period exhibits excessive foreign borrowing, high wage inflation, an <b>excessive</b> <b>stock</b> market boom, and much too rapid growth in the non-traded sector {{at the expense of}} the exportable goods sector. Alternative monetary policies can be used to eliminate the inefficiencies of the post-accession adjustment, but some bring real costs in terms of lower growth and unemployment. We find that the best policy is one of flexible inflation targeting with some weight on exchange rate stability. In the absence of exchange rate adjustment, fiscal policy could be used, but this requires complicated time-varying expenditure taxes. While the analytical discussion emphasizes the benefits of exchange rate adjustment, a later section of the article explores some more recent arguments regarding non-traditional costs of exchange rate volatility.

30|$|A {{growing body}} of {{research}} has established firm-specific return variation as an effective measure of firm private information impounded into stock price. French and Roll (1986) and Roll (1988) show that neither market returns nor public news explain stock return variation, suggesting that firm-specific return variation captures the impounding of private information into stock price. An influential study by Morck et al. (2000) finds that stock returns are less synchronous in developed markets with relatively strong property rights protection (and thus fewer impediments to informed trading) than in emerging markets with relatively poor protection, supporting the notion that firm-specific return variation is associated with the intensity of information-based trading. Empirical studies have largely supported their conclusions (Brockman and Yan, 2009; Durnev et al., 2003; Gul et al., 2009; Hutton et al., 2009; Kim and Shi, 2012). Piotroski and Roulstone (2004) show that insider trading reduces stock return synchronicity. Fernandes and Ferreira (2009) show that the enforcement of insider trading laws encourages informed risk arbitrage, which in turn facilitates the impounding of firm-specific information into stock prices.

The quick response model and new supply chain practices of fast fashion even accelerate the speed of it. In recent years, the fashion cycle has steadily decreased as fast fashion retailers sell clothing that is expected to be disposed of after being worn only a few times.

Using a sample of listed US insurers, this thesis shows that board independence, gender diversity, busy boards, board compensation, and CEO compensation are positively related to the risk taking and performance while no strong relation is found for experienced boards and insurer risk taking or performance. The results are robust {{to a number of}} risk and performance proxies. The several estimation methods are applied to address the endogeneity, unobserved heterogeneity, cross-sectional correlation, and outlier problems.

The board independence and busy boards results are also new in the insurance context, and different from prior non-financial and banking governance literature. These findings should prove to be of interest to a number of stakeholders. Academics should consider the inter-linkages among board structures and incentives when designing future research on insurance governance and compensation.

The scope of the standard extends beyond payments to employees, but {{for the purpose of}} this study, the focus is only on 'employee stock options'. IIFRS 2 requires a fair value of stock options records calculated on grant date, and recognized as compensation expenses over vesting periods. Prior to the introduction of IIFRS 2, stock options were not recognized and were only disclosed in the notes to the accounts. In Malaysia, the standard is mandatory for all companies listed on or after January 1, 2006. This study assumes the requirement existed in 2003. This study examines the impact of stock options expenses from 2003 to 2005, on the top 100 Malaysian companies. The three year observations show at least 24 % of the sample exceeds the 5 % materiality threshold on diluted EPS. The sectors that are impacted the most are the Trade/Service and Finance sectors. From the multiple-regression test, this study finds that fair value of stock options have a negative relationship with dividend yields (input of the Black-Scholes Merton (BSM) Model).
