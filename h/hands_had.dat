5|$|After Olander, Williams, and Johnson had recovered, the six musicians {{set to work}} {{on their}} debut album. In doing so, Johnson soon {{discovered}} that the injuries to his <b>hands</b> <b>had</b> altered his dexterity on the mandolin, and threatened to walk away after Powell offhandedly remarked that he would have Roe dub in his own tenor harmonies instead of having Johnson sing them. The band also had commitments to finish as the Tennessee River Boys, {{to the point that they}} occasionally had to promote themselves under both names in the same day.|$|E
5|$|Lambeosaurus {{was like}} other hadrosaurids, and could move on both two legs and all fours, {{as shown by}} {{footprints}} of related animals. It had a long tail stiffened by ossified tendons that prevented it from drooping. The <b>hands</b> <b>had</b> four fingers, lacking the innermost finger of the generalized five-fingered tetrapod hand, while the second, third, and fourth fingers were bunched together and bore hooves, suggesting the animal could have used the hands for support. The fifth finger was free and {{could be used to}} manipulate objects. Each foot had only the three central toes.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to these gunnery drills, Broke was fond of preparing hypothetical scenarios to test his crew. For example, after all <b>hands</b> <b>had</b> been drummed to quarters, he would inform them of a theoretical attack {{and see how they}} would act to defend the ship. Though the use of cutlasses in training was avoided a method of swordsmanship training called 'singlestick' was regularly practised. This was a game employing roughly similar cuts, thrusts and parries as were used with the cutlass, but as it was played with wooden sticks with wicker hand guards; hits, although painful, were not often dangerous. It soon developed quickness of eye and wrist. Many of the crew became very expert.|$|E
50|$|First {{compare the}} hand types. If one <b>hand</b> <b>has</b> a better <b>hand</b> type than the other, that hand wins. The amount won is the winning hand's deng times the {{original}} bet. If both the dealer's {{hand and the}} player's <b>hand</b> <b>have</b> the same <b>hand</b> type, the numerical value taem is compared. If one <b>hand</b> <b>has</b> a greater taem than the other, that hand wins. The amount won is the winning hand's deng. If both <b>hands</b> <b>have</b> the same <b>hand</b> type and taem, the deng is compared. If one <b>hand</b> <b>has</b> a greater deng than the other, that hand wins the payout of the difference of the hands' deng. If both <b>hands</b> <b>have</b> the same <b>hand</b> type, taem, and deng, they tie and the original bet is returned to the player.|$|R

This first British Grand Prix was won by Louis Wagner and Robert Sénéchal, sharing the drive in a Delage 155B. The second British Grand Prix was staged there in 1927 and these two events resulted in improved facilities at Brooklands.|$|E

25|$|The Orlac couple {{are forced}} to sell many of their {{possessions}} {{to pay for the}} surgery, while Stephen finds he is unable to play the piano with his new hands. When a creditor comes to claim the Orlacs' piano, Stephen throws a fountain pen that barely misses his head. Stephen seeks help from his stepfather, Henry Orlac (Ian Wolfe). Henry denies the request, upset that Stephen did not follow in his line of business as a jeweler. A knife thrown in anger by Stephen misses Henry, but breaks the shop front's window. Gogol meanwhile asks Yvonne for her love, but she refuses. Stephen goes to Gogol's home and demands to know about his hands, and why they throw knives. Gogol suggests that Stephen's problem comes from childhood trauma, but later confirms to his assistant Dr. Wong (Keye Luke) that Stephen's <b>hands</b> <b>had</b> been Rollo's.|$|E
500|$|The Times had {{reported}} that Shackleton {{planned to take}} a dozen men to the Arctic, [...] "chiefly those who had accompanied him on earlier expeditions". In fact, Quest left London for the south with 20men, of whom eight were old Endurance comrades; another, James Dell, was a veteran from the Discovery, 20years previously. Some of the Endurance <b>hands</b> <b>had</b> not been fully paid from the earlier expedition, but were prepared to join Shackleton again out of personal loyalty.|$|E

The decomposing body had already started emitting a strong odor, which ship <b>hands</b> <b>had</b> assumed was a poison put out to kill rats. [...] The stevedore opened the crate, revealing a half-naked male corpse wrapped in a shop awning, bound with rope and packed with salt. [...] A scar on the body's leg and a single gold ring identified the body as Adams.|$|E
500|$|McCabe {{died of a}} skull {{fracture}} {{after falling}} from a cliff {{at his home in}} Mosman, New South Wales after attempting to dispose of a dead possum. He had earlier told Dwyer of his plan to clean out his backyard, and was told to rest, but did so anyway, falling down and rolling off the steep slope in his backyard and over the ledge of the cliff abutting the rear of his house. There was innuendo that McCabe had actually committed suicide, with O'Reilly musing [...] "He had despatched the possum, but had gone overboard with it!". However, the coroner ruled that the death was accidental and his family strongly denied that he had chosen to end his life. The coroner’s investigation noted that McCabe’s <b>hands</b> <b>had</b> tufts of ripped grass in them, indicating that he had tried to grab onto vegetation in a vain attempt to stop his fall.|$|E
500|$|The scapulae (shoulder blades) were robust; {{the bones}} of the forelimb were short in {{relation}} to the animal's size, but broad and sturdy. The humerus was short and stout, with its ends broadly expanded and flattened—the upper side for the deltopectoral crest and muscle attachment and the lower for articulation with the radius and ulna. The radius was short, stout and straight, and the olecranon of the ulna apparently very powerful. The lower part of the ulna had a broad expansion. The <b>hands</b> <b>had</b> three fingers; the first finger bore a large claw (ungual bone) measuring about [...] along its curve, which would have been lengthened by a keratin sheath in life. Apart from its size, the claw's proportions were fairly typical of a theropod; it was bilaterally symmetric, slightly compressed, smoothly rounded, and sharply pointed. A groove for the sheath ran {{along the length of the}} claw. The pubic foot of the pelvis was not expanded.|$|E

500|$|Governor Eden was {{certainly}} embarrassed by Spotswood's invasion of North Carolina, and Spotswood disavowed himself of {{any part of}} the seizure. [...] He defended his actions, writing to Lord Carteret, a shareholder of the Province of Carolina, that he might benefit from the sale of the seized property and reminding the Earl of the number of Virginians who had died to protect his interests. [...] He argued for the secrecy of the operation by suggesting that Eden [...] "could contribute nothing to the Success of the Design", and told Eden that his authority to capture the pirates came from the king. [...] Eden was heavily criticised for his involvement with Teach and was accused of being his accomplice. [...] By criticising Eden, Spotswood intended to bolster the legitimacy of his invasion. [...] Lee (1974) concludes that although Spotswood may have thought that the ends justified the means, he had no legal authority to invade North Carolina, to capture the pirates and to seize and auction their goods. [...] Eden doubtless shared the same view. [...] As Spotswood had also accused Tobias Knight of being in league with Teach, on 4April 1719, Eden had Knight brought in for questioning. [...] Israel <b>Hands</b> <b>had,</b> weeks earlier, testified that Knight had been on board the Adventure in August 1718, shortly after Teach had brought a French ship to North Carolina as a prize. [...] Four pirates had testified that with Teach, they had visited Knight's home to give him presents. [...] This testimony and the letter found on Teach's body by Maynard appeared compelling, but Knight conducted his defence with competence. [...] Despite being very sick and close to death, he questioned the reliability of Spotswood's witnesses. [...] He claimed that Israel <b>Hands</b> <b>had</b> talked under duress, and that under North Carolinian law, the other witness, an African, was unable to testify. [...] The sugar, he argued, was stored at his house legally, and Teach had visited him only on business, in his official capacity. [...] The board found Knight innocent of all charges. [...] He died later that year.|$|E
500|$|Tyrannosaurids varied {{little in}} body form, and Tarbosaurus was no exception. The head was {{supported}} by an S-shaped neck, {{while the rest of}} the vertebral column, including the long tail, was held horizontally. Tarbosaurus had tiny forelimbs, proportionably to body size the smallest of all members of the family. The <b>hands</b> <b>had</b> two clawed digits each, with an additional unclawed third metacarpal found in some specimens, similar to closely related genera. Holtz has suggested that Tarbosaurus also has a theropod reduction of fingers IV-I [...] "developed further" [...] than in other tyrannosaurids, as the second metacarpal in the Tarbosaurus specimens he studied is less than twice the length of the first metacarpal (other tyrannosaurids have a second metacarpal about twice the length of the first metacarpal). Also, the third metacarpal in Tarbosaurus is proportionally shorter than in other tyrannosaurids; in other tyrannosaurids (like Albertosaurus and Daspletosaurus), the third metacarpal is often longer than the first metacarpal, while in the Tarbosaurus specimens studied by Holtz, the third metacarpal is shorter than the first.|$|E
