5|$|Pollution, {{floods and}} {{development}} of the watershed and the surrounding county have blighted the water quality and wildlife of the creek since the 1960s, when residential suburban development of the eight cities in the watershed began. Pollution continues to be a major problem for the creek—the subject of many water quality and feasibility studies—but, as with many other Orange County streams, little <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>done</b> <b>to</b> correct it.|$|E
5|$|Some of the 62 known {{satellites}} of Saturn {{are considered}} lost {{because they have}} not been observed since their discovery and hence their orbits are not well-known enough to pinpoint their current locations. Work <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>done</b> <b>to</b> recover many of them in surveys from 2009 onwards, but seven – S/2007 S 2, S/2004 S 13, S/2006 S 1, S/2007 S 3, S/2004 S 17, S/2004 S 12, and S/2004 S 7 – still remain lost today.|$|E

Various temple pyramids, {{the remains}} of palaces (mostly reduced to mounds of rubble) and a court for playing the Mesoamerican ballgame {{can be seen in}} the site core. In the Greater Q'umarkaj area there were four ballcourts, one in each of the four major political divisions of the city, testifying to the central role of the ballgame ritual in the sociopolitical organisation of the city.|$|E

5|$|The usual form of {{diamond in}} cutting tools is micrometer-sized grains {{dispersed}} {{in a metal}} matrix (usually cobalt) sintered onto the tool. This is typically referred to in industry as polycrystalline diamond (PCD). PCD-tipped tools {{can be found in}} mining and cutting applications. For the past fifteen years, work <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>done</b> <b>to</b> coat metallic tools with CVD diamond, and though the work still shows promise it has not significantly replaced traditional PCD tools.|$|E
5|$|Today, Fort Ricasoli {{remains largely}} intact, {{although}} {{it is in a}} dilapidated state. The headland that it is built upon is prone to coastal erosion, and some of the walls between No. 3 and No. 4 bastions have already collapsed into the sea. In 2004, the Restoration Unit of the Ministry of Resources and Infrastructure removed, restored and re-attached part of the fort's walls, but nothing <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>done</b> <b>to</b> restore the entire fort.|$|E
5|$|Following World War II, Sava {{was raised}} once again, and was {{refurbished}} {{to serve in}} the Yugoslav Navy from 1952 to 1962.

In 2005, the government of Serbia granted her limited heritage protection after citizens demanded that she be preserved as a floating museum, but little else <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>done</b> <b>to</b> restore her at the time. In 2015, the Serbian Ministry of Defence and Belgrade's Military Museum acquired the ship with the intent of restoring her.|$|E

5|$|Some of the 69 known {{satellites}} of Jupiter {{are considered}} lost {{because they have}} not been observed since their discovery and hence their orbits are not well-known enough to pinpoint their current locations. Work <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>done</b> <b>to</b> recover many of them in surveys from 2009 onwards (in which some new moons were also discovered), but six – S/2003 J 12, S/2003 J 10, S/2003 J 19, S/2003 J 4, S/2003 J 2, and S/2011 J 1 – still remain lost today. Follow-up observations in 2018 are planned to secure their orbits and perhaps find new moons.|$|E
5|$|The {{formation}} timescale {{of giant}} planets {{is also an}} important problem. Old theories were unable to explain how their cores could form fast enough to accumulate significant amounts of gas from the quickly disappearing protoplanetary disk. The mean lifetime of the disks, which is less than ten million (107)years, appeared to be shorter than the time necessary for the core formation. Much progress <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>done</b> <b>to</b> solve this problem and current models of giant planet formation are now capable of forming Jupiter (or more massive planets) in about 4 million years or less, well within the average lifetime of gaseous disks.|$|E
5|$|Human {{attitudes toward}} insects are often negative, {{reinforced}} by sensationalism in the media. This {{has produced a}} society that attempts to eliminate insects from daily life. For example, nearly 75 million pounds of broad-spectrum insecticides are manufactured and sold each year for use in American homes and gardens. Annual revenues from insecticide sales to homeowners exceeded $450 million in 2004. Out of the roughly a million species of insects described so far, not more than 1,000 {{can be regarded as}} serious pests, and less than 10,000 (about 1%) are even occasional pests. Yet not one species of insect has been permanently eradicated through the use of pesticides. Instead, at least 1,000 species have developed field resistance to pesticides, and extensive harm <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>done</b> <b>to</b> beneficial insects including pollinators such as bees.|$|E

5|$|In the {{aftermath}} of the Machination's attempted takeover, Sunstreaker and Hunter are successfully separated by Ratchet. Hunter has a happy reunion with Verity and Jimmy, but Sunstreaker, angry over what <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>done</b> <b>to</b> him, abandons his former partner. After the initial battles on Earth, the Decepticons lie low, experimenting with creating new life and eventually creating the Insecticons {{to take advantage of a}} now captured Hunter, as well as thousands of failed experiments eventually dubbed the Swarm. As the Autobots have reinforced their position on Earth, the Decepticons lure them into a trap by planting disinformation about a Decepticon trap with the help of Sunstreaker, who is convinced that he is in fact helping Starscream kill Megatron. His motives are darker than merely helping the Autobots win by disposing of Megatron - he asks the Decepticon to kill all the humans in revenge for what was done to him. Armed with the disillusioned Autobot's knowledge, unified and with their new weapon - Devastator - the Decepticons decimate the Autobots. Planning to dispose of them through a portal to Cybertron, Prime manages to fight them off long enough for his troops to escape through the portal, though at great cost - Prime is heavily damaged and rendered comatose by the damage he takes, and the Autobots are marooned on Cybertron.|$|E
5|$|The Sulu bleeding-heart is {{considered}} to be critically endangered by the IUCN. The Sulu bleeding-heart has always been considered a rare bird, and only two specimens, both males, have ever been taken of the species. The specimens, collected in October 1891 on the small islet of Tataan, are the last time anyone has definitely seen the Sulu bleeding-heart alive. The bleeding-heart was searched for 22 days in December 1971 and briefly in September 1991 without success. Most of Tawi-Tawi's forests were cleared by August 1994, and the Sulu bleeding-heart may well be extirpated on the mainland. However, an ethnobiological survey in 1995 generated reports that the bleeding-heart survives and is regularly seen on the nearby islets of Tandubatu, Dundangan, and Baliungan. It was also reported that the species was quite common until the 1970s. Despite this, an expedition in 2009 failed to find any signs of the species or discover a new report of the species' continued existence. The islets it reportedly survives on may also be too small to support a viable population. Any surviving population of Sulu bleeding-hearts is likely to be small, possibly numbering fewer than 50 birds, and would be threatened by continued habitat destruction and uncontrolled hunting. As the Mindanao and Luzon bleeding-hearts are popular cagebirds, any bleeding-heart found on Tawi-Tawi could also be an escaped bleeding-heart instead of the indigenous Sulu bleeding-heart. There are no protected areas in the Sulu Archipelago, and other than two environmental education initiatives in the 1990s nothing <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>done</b> <b>to</b> protect any surviving population.|$|E
5|$|The {{injustice}} which <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>done</b> <b>to</b> our author's works, in estimating their poetical merit, rendered us doubly anxious, {{on opening}} his last volume, {{to find it}} likely to seize fast hold of general sympathy, and thus turn an overwhelming power against the paltry traducers of talent, more eminently promising in many respects, than any the present age has been called upon to encourage. We have not {{found it to be}} quite all that we wished in this respect--and {{it would have been very}} extraordinary if we had, for our wishes went far beyond reasonable expectations. But we have found it of a nature to present to common understandings the poetical power with which the author's mind is gifted, in a more tangible and intelligible shape than that in which it has appeared in any of his former compositions. It is, therefore, calculated to throw shame on the lying, vulgar spirit, in which this young worshipper in the temple of the Muses has been cried-down; whatever questions may still leave to be settled as to the kind and degree of his poetical merits. Take for instance, as proof of the justice of our praise, the following passage from an Ode to the Nightingale:--it is distinct, noble, pathetic, and true: the thoughts have all chords of direct communication with naturally-constituted hearts: the echoes of the strain linger bout the depths of human bosoms.|$|E
