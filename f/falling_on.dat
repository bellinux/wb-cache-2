5|$|A {{brain and}} a subtle ear {{has gone into}} the making of this poem...celebrating the mystery of Christ's conception. Dew <b>falling</b> <b>on</b> grass, flower and spray (traditional imagery, {{deriving}} from OT texts such as Psalm 72:6) suggests ease, grace and delicacy generally (not progressive stages of insemination). The emphasis on Mary's freedom of choice, {{at the moment of}} the annunciation, is theologically strictly proper.|$|E
5000|$|In the diaspora, {{the second}} day of Shavuot <b>falls</b> <b>on</b> Shabbat, the only time Shavuot ever <b>falls</b> <b>on</b> Shabbat. (In Israel, Shavuot never <b>falls</b> <b>on</b> Shabbat.) ...|$|R
5000|$|As a consequence, in {{the case}} of Yom Kippur, which <b>falls</b> <b>on</b> 10 Tishrei and cannot <b>fall</b> <b>on</b> a Friday or Sunday, the days in Cheshvan and/or Kislev are {{adjusted}} so that Rosh Hashanah, which <b>falls</b> <b>on</b> 1 Tishrei, does not <b>fall</b> <b>on</b> a Wednesday or Friday. And, {{in the case}} of Hoshana Rabbah, which <b>falls</b> <b>on</b> 21 Tishrei and cannot <b>fall</b> <b>on</b> a Saturday, Rosh Hashanah cannot be on a Sunday. This leaves only four days on which Rosh Hashanah is allowed to fall: Monday, Tuesday, Thursday and Saturday, which are also referred as the [...] "four gates".|$|R
50|$|The basic {{condition}} for general {{position is that}} points do not <b>fall</b> <b>on</b> subvarieties of lower degree than necessary; in the plane two points should not be coincident, three points should not <b>fall</b> <b>on</b> a line, six points should not <b>fall</b> <b>on</b> a conic, ten points should not <b>fall</b> <b>on</b> a cubic, and likewise for higher degree.|$|R
5|$|After initial assessments, the HUSAR team {{felt they}} had the proper {{equipment}} for the mission. In {{the early hours of}} Monday morning, June 25 – and despite discovering signs of life – rescue work was suspended due to the danger of additional concrete <b>falling</b> <b>on</b> the potential survivors and the HUSAR rescuers.|$|E
5|$|Although the Persians stood {{their ground}} for a while, they {{eventually}} broke and fled to the palisade. The soldiers of the right wing followed them into the camp, at which point many of the Persian army fled from the camp, except the ethnic Persian troops, who grouped together and fought the Allied soldiers who entered the camp. Finally, the left wing arrived, outflanking the camp and <b>falling</b> <b>on</b> {{the rear of the}} remaining Persian forces, thereby completing the rout.|$|E
5|$|England reached 3/106 by stumps on {{the fourth}} day, but the final day started poorly when Compton edged the second ball of the day—bowled by Johnston—to a diving Miller at second slip; he knocked the ball upwards before <b>falling</b> <b>on</b> his back and {{completing}} the catch as the ball went down. Just as in the first innings, Compton’s dismissal precipitated a collapse, and Australia dismissed England for 186 to complete victory by 409 runs.|$|E

5|$|Rain <b>falling</b> <b>on</b> {{loosely packed}} {{material}} such as newly fallen ash can produce dimples {{that can be}} fossilized.

5|$|The scrimmages were {{something}} awful to witnessliving, kicking, scrambling masses of humanity surging to and fro, each individual after the leather oval.

5|$|Winters {{are cold}} and snowy; Utica {{receives}} lake-effect snow from Lake Erie and Lake Ontario. Utica is colder on average than other Great Lakes cities {{because of its}} location in a valley and susceptibility to north winds; temperatures in the single digits or below zero Fahrenheit are not uncommon on winter nights. Annual precipitation (based on a 30-year average from 1981–2010) is , <b>falling</b> <b>on</b> an average of 171 days.|$|E
5|$|By early 2016, delays as {{a result}} of {{overcrowding}} were up to more than 20,000 every month, four times the amount in 2012. The overcrowded trains have resulted in an increase of assaults because of tense commuters. With less platform space, more passengers are forced to be {{on the edge of the}} platform resulting in the increased possibility of passengers <b>falling</b> <b>on</b> the track. One possible solution that the MTA is considering is platform screen doors, which exist on the AirTrain JFK to prevent passengers from falling onto the tracks. In order to prevent hitting passengers who could fall onto the tracks, train operators are being instructed to go into stations at lower speeds. The increased proximity of riders could result in the spread of contagious diseases.|$|E
5|$|Historically, most rain <b>falling</b> <b>on</b> the {{watershed}} {{was taken up}} by vegetation, flowed into wetlands, soaked into the ground, or evaporated. Heavy rain in the winter months recharged the groundwater and provided baseflows to the slough during dry summers. Urban development, which replaced vegetation and water-absorbing soils with airport runways, house roofs, highways, warehouses, parking lots, and other hard surfaces, interrupted this cycle. In 1999, a study estimated that impervious surfaces covered 54percent of {{the watershed}}. Storm runoff that might have taken days to reach the historic slough reaches the developed slough in hours.|$|E
50|$|Observance {{of the day}} {{is moved}} back to the Thursday before, if 27 Nisan <b>falls</b> <b>on</b> a Friday (as in 2008), or forward a day, if 27 Nisan <b>falls</b> <b>on</b> a Sunday (to avoid {{adjacency}} with the Jewish Sabbath). The fixed Jewish calendar ensures 27 Nisan does not <b>fall</b> <b>on</b> Saturday.|$|R

5|$|In {{the third}} Test, too, Ring's batting made more impact than his bowling. A wet pitch led to 22 wickets <b>falling</b> <b>on</b> the first day, and {{temporary}} Australian captain Arthur Morris rejigged his batting order {{at the end}} of the day, opening the second innings with Ian Johnson and Gil Langley, sending Geff Noblet in when Johnson was out and then Ring as a second nightwatchman when Noblet was out. Ring lasted into the second day when conditions were easier, and top-scored for the Australian team with 67, which remained his best score in Tests. He took three of the four wickets that fell as West Indies successfully chased a target of 233 on Christmas Day.|$|E
5|$|Lysacek {{began the}} 2007–2008 {{season at the}} 2007 Skate America. He underrotated and fell on an {{attempted}} quadruple toe loop-triple toe loop in the short program, receiving only one point for that element. He was in second place going into the free skate. He won the free skate, landing a clean quadruple jump, {{but was unable to}} pull up to first overall, due to Daisuke Takahashi's twelve point lead after the short program. He went on to the 2007 Cup of China, where he won the short program with a score of 81.55, improving his personal best by almost thirteen points. He placed second in the free skate after <b>falling</b> <b>on</b> his quadruple jump, and finished second overall to Johnny Weir.|$|E
5|$|Rupert {{continued}} to impress militarily. By 1644, now the Duke of Cumberland and Earl of Holderness, {{he led the}} relief of Newark and York and its castle. Having marched north, taking Bolton and Liverpool along the way in two bloody assaults, Rupert then intervened in Yorkshire in two highly effective manoeuvres, in the first outwitting the enemy forces at Newark with speed; in the second, striking across country and approaching York from the north. Rupert then commanded much of the royalist army at its defeat at Marston Moor, {{with much of the}} blame <b>falling</b> <b>on</b> the poor working relationship between Rupert and the Marquess of Newcastle, and orders from the King that wrongly conveyed a desperate need for a speedy success in the north.|$|E
50|$|Section 1 of the 1971 Act also {{enables the}} Queen to appoint {{substitute}} bank holidays {{in any one}} year by Royal Proclamation. Substitute days are customarily appointed for all UK bank holidays which <b>fall</b> <b>on</b> a Saturday or Sunday. Where any of the dates <b>fall</b> <b>on</b> a Sunday, the Act substitutes the following Monday for that date. If any <b>fall</b> <b>on</b> a Saturday (or if Boxing Day <b>falls</b> <b>on</b> a Saturday or Sunday), the Royal Proclamation includes substitute days for these days.|$|R

5|$|Scully {{finds the}} two {{sitting at a}} table with the dead guard's revolver. Modell forces Mulder to play Russian {{roulette}} with him. Despite Scully's pleading, Mulder pulls the trigger first at Modell and then himself, the hammer <b>falling</b> <b>on</b> an empty chamber both times. Modell then makes him aim the gun at Scully. At the last instant, Scully sees a fire alarm in a mirror and pulls it in desperation, breaking Modell's concentration. Mulder instantly switches his aim to Modell and pulls the trigger; the bullet is fired and Modell is severely wounded.|$|E
5|$|That evening Kouma led {{the patrol}} of two M26 Pershing tanks and two M19 Gun Motor Carriages in Agok, along the Naktong River. Kouma placed his patrol {{on the west}} side of Agok near the Kihang ferry. At 20:00 a heavy fog covered the river, and at 22:00 mortar shells began <b>falling</b> <b>on</b> the American-held side of the river. By 22:15 this strike {{intensified}} and North Korean mortar preparation struck A Company's positions. American mortars and artillery began firing counter-battery. Some of A Company's men reported hearing noises on the opposite side of the river and splashes in the water.|$|E
5|$|The rhyme is {{constructed}} of quatrains in trochaic tetrameter catalectic, (each line {{made up of}} four metrical feet of two syllables, with the stress <b>falling</b> <b>on</b> the first syllable in a pair; the last foot in the line missing the unstressed syllable), which is common in nursery rhymes. In its most common form it relies on a double repetition, rather than a rhyming scheme, which is a frequently employed device in children's rhymes and stories. The Roud Folk Song Index, which catalogues folk songs and their variations by number, classifies the song as 502.|$|E
2500|$|Verbs {{that have}} one or more prefixes, called [...] "compound verbs", always take conjunct endings. In this case, stress {{generally}} <b>falls</b> <b>on</b> the syllable after the first prefix. Where only one prefix is present, that means stress <b>falls</b> <b>on</b> the verb root, but where two or more prefixes are present, stress then <b>falls</b> <b>on</b> the second prefix.|$|R
