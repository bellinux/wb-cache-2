500|$|Although Piquet's {{result was}} fortuitous, Renault Engineering Director, Pat Symonds, {{subsequently}} praised him for {{stepping up to}} the job of staying with the leaders in the final stint of the race. Meanwhile, Massa commented that his car was not in good order during the race: [...] "It was just slow with difficult stability and also on braking I think <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> problem as well and lost a lot of performance. I didn’t have the car to fight. I tried but it was not possible." [...] Teammate Räikkönen also struggled with low grip and hot brakes {{for the duration of the}} race, while Kovalainen and Kubica had problems with their tyres.|$|E
500|$|The episode {{features}} cultural {{references to}} many American and British films. Woods becoming {{a convenience store}} clerk {{to prepare for a}} film is similar to Nick Lang (Michael J. Fox) becoming a police officer in the 1991 film The Hard Way, which Woods also starred in (interestingly, this is a reversal of roles: Woods played the cop that Lang was saddled with in the film). When Kent asks Homer if he is willing to go undercover to [...] "nail" [...] Apu, Homer replies: [...] "No way, man, get yourself another patsy!" [...] This is a reference to a line in the 1991 film JFK. The scene of Homer and Apu riding on mules to the Springfield Airport, with their luggage strapped to the mules' backs, is similar to a scene from the 1962 film Lawrence of Arabia. In his Kwik-E-Mart job interview, the interviewer asks Woods why he would want to work at the Kwik-E-Mart, to which he replies: [...] "To be honest, in my upcoming movie I'm going to be playing this tightly-wound convenience store clerk and, I kind of like to research my roles and really get into it. For instance, in True Believer I actually worked in a law firm for two months. And then, the film Chaplin <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> cameo in that. I actually traveled back in time, back to the twenties, where... Well, I've said too much," [...] referencing the 1989 film True Believer and the 1992 film Chaplin.|$|E
500|$|Ralf Schumacher said, [...] "I'm {{more than}} happy; {{we have been}} strong here the whole weekend and my car behaved perfectly. <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> moment of worry about six laps from the end when the {{throttle}} didn't seem to pick up properly and I thought the engine was going to stop, but it came back and all was well." [...] Schumacher added that his team was confident of securing third in the Constructors' Championship; although he could not match Häkkinen's pace, he praised the team for his car's set-up. Coulthard was disappointed with his fourth-place finish, and thought his team's decision to call him into the pit lane after his competitors cost him the victory; however, he remained confident about his championship chances. Button was also disappointed to finish fifth: [...] "It was a bad race for me, if not the worst. The car was working well at the start, but when I tried to pass Jarno I went in a bit late." [...] Trulli refused to criticise Button after the race, believing that Button made a mistake. Fisichella and Verstappen felt similarly about their lap-nine collision, with Fisichella saying that he [...] "felt sorry" [...] for Verstappen and describing his weekend as [...] "disastrous". Verstappen said that he struggled with his car's balance, which resulted in oversteer. He was [...] "happy to go home", because [...] "it's not been a good weekend." [...] Frentzen said that although {{he was happy to}} score points, he had hoped for a better finish.|$|E

2500|$|In 1960, Reynolds and Autry {{founded the}} Major League Baseball {{expansion}} team the Los Angeles Angels. [...] At {{the time that}} he and Autry received the franchise for the American League's new Los Angeles franchise, Reynolds described his transition to a [...] "baseball man" [...] and his long relationship with Autry:"'My transformation into the town's No. 1 baseball fan,' he grinned, 'occurred the minute we were given the franchise, and I found out <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> personal investment at stake.' … 'I'd known Gene for at least 15 years, and we always hoped to own a radio station together,' explained Bob. [...] 'We satisfied that ambition with the acquisition of KMPC in 1952. NOw we have a baseball team, and we're out to make it the best.'" ...|$|E
2500|$|... "Theme from Caged Heat 1985" [...] : All Hail the King, Drew Pearce {{created a}} fictional CBS 1980s {{television}} pilot titled Caged Heat (starring Ben Kingsley's Trevor Slattery character), and Feige encouraged him [...] "to go off. The {{whole purpose of}} Trevor is to go off the rails." [...] Feige and Marvel subsequently suggested that Pearce create a full title sequence for the pilot. Feige's love of film soundtracks [...] "started when <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> tape recorder and I would tape the themes to Simon and Simon and The A-Team and play it back, and those were all Mike Post", so Pearce contacted Post about using one of his old themes for the sequence. Because Post had sold the rights {{to all of the}} themes he had written, and felt that none of them fit the [...] "Russian Magnum P.I." [...] tone that Pearce was aiming for anyway, he offered to write a new theme specifically for the project. Post recorded the theme music on the same equipment he used for his iconic 1980s series' themes.|$|E
