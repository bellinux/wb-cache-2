25|$|There {{has been}} three {{attempts}} of reformation since the band's breakup in 2004. In 2006 Norton and Dedman started demoing new tracks with Matt “Skitz” Sanders from Damaged on drums, Seanheist had injured {{his knee and}} ankle {{and was unable to}} commit to recording at this time. Three new songs were recorded but were never fully finished and were soon shelved. The second attempt at reformation was in 2008 with the lineup of Biro, Norton, Seanheist and Dedman rehearsing some old songs and jamming new material a handful of times. Personality clashes, old grievances and just bad timing <b>just</b> <b>made</b> <b>the</b> reformation impossible to go ahead. In 2012 All five members of the band from the IRCR line-up finally caught up and met at the album's 10 year Anniversary party at Norton’s bar (Whole Lotta Love) in Melbourne, talks of reforming were once again on the table, but nothing eventuated.|$|E

It made us look forward to getting together as a band so much more. The positive effect he had on me <b>just</b> <b>made</b> <b>the</b> whole experience of Limp Bizkit feel like a brand-new entity." [...] Before Smith replaced Borland, Durst played a great deal of guitar.

500|$|In Eurogamer February 2009 {{preview of}} Resident Evil 5, Dan Whitehead {{expressed}} concern about controversy the game might generate: [...] "It plays so blatantly into the old clichés of the dangerous '' and the primitive lust of its inhabitants that you'd swear the game {{was written in the}} 1920s". Whitehead said that these issues became more [...] "outrageous and outdated" [...] as the game progressed, and that the addition of the [...] "light-skinned" [...] Alomar <b>just</b> <b>made</b> <b>the</b> overall issue worse. Hillary Golstein from IGN believed that the game was not deliberately racist, and though she did not personally find it racist or offensive, she felt that others would due to the subjective nature of offensiveness. Chris Hudak dismissed any allegations of racism as [...] "stupid". Karen Dyer, who is of Jamaican descent, also dismissed the claims. She said that in over a year of working on the game's development she never encountered anything racially insensitive, and would not have continued working there if she had.|$|E

Bauman was a baseball player who, despite hitting 72 home runs during the 1954 season—at the time, a record for a professional player—never {{made it to the}} Major Leagues. Duchovny immediately connected the story of Bauman, who played for the Roswell Rockets, with the 1947 Roswell Incident, saying [...] "I <b>just</b> <b>made</b> <b>the</b> association...What if this guy was an alien? and I just started working on that idea." [...] Duchovny later said that [...] "these happy chronological coincidences" [...] facilitated the development of the story.

After the band released their third studio album Undone in early 2004, they decided {{to take some time}} off, and realized they could record a Christmas album over that period. Although MercyMe had started as a rock band, they become associated with the adult contemporary genre after their single [...] "I Can Only Imagine" [...] became successful. In creating The Christmas Sessions, the band incorporated more elements from rock music and other genres; Millard described it as [...] "the most 'rock' album we've done" [...] and noted they did not concern themselves with the album's direction, saying [...] "we didn’t have to worry about which direction we went. We <b>just</b> <b>made</b> <b>the</b> record we wanted to make".|$|E
500|$|The group's primary musical {{influences}} {{came from}} bands such as Buzzcocks, The Jam, Madness and The Kinks. Supergrass took this contemporary music and mixed it with pop punk's characteristic fast, three-chord, guitar-based, catchy tunes {{to produce a}} sound uniquely their own; [...] "we were just {{the three of us}} in my bedroom or someone's house, just making... we played really hard and just made loads of noise. Most of our early songs were just three chord grooves and stuff that was fun to play. So that's why the first album sounded so 'punky', I think... it's just 'cause we were all used to playing in this small room and it being really loud, so we <b>just</b> <b>made</b> <b>the</b> album sound like that." [...] Songs for Beginners by Graham Nash was another possible influence on I Should Coco.

Although Fischer's rating was not among the top 12 in the country, he received entry by special consideration. Playing against top opposition, the 13-year-old Fischer could only score 4½/11, tying for 8–9th place. Yet, he won the [...] for his immortal game against International Master Donald Byrne, in which Fischer sacrificed his queen to unleash an unstoppable attack. Hans Kmoch called it [...] "The Game of the Century", writing: [...] "The following game, a stunning masterpiece of [...] play performed by a boy of 13 against a formidable opponent, matches the finest on record in the history of chess prodigies".

500|$|... "She Wolf" [...] {{was written}} by Shakira, John Hill, and Sam Endicott. Shakira and Hill also served as the {{producers}} of the song. In an interview with Rolling Stone, Shakira said that the idea for [...] "She Wolf" [...] came to her [...] "very mysteriously", revealing [...] "I was in the studio {{in a bad mood}} that day, then I got inspired and went to a corner and I wrote the lyrics and the melody in 10 minutes. The image of the she wolf just came to my head, and when I least expected it I was howling and panting". Endicott, musician and lead singer of American post-punk band The Bravery, explained how he and Hill began working with Shakira, saying she [...] "contacted him (Hill), asking if he had any stuff. We never had her in mind. We <b>just</b> <b>made</b> <b>the</b> thing independently of her, and then she liked it a lot, and she sang over it. She used some of the melodies we put in there and then wrote these crazy lyrics about being a werewolf. And that's how it happened". [...] "She Wolf" [...] was described by Slant Magazine as a [...] "sleek, hi-NRG/Italo throwback that's drenched in disco strings". Mikael Wood from Spin identified the song's genre as synthpop. Shakira also howls and pants at various times during the song. It is written in B minor key and is a moderate dance groove with a tempo of 120 beats per minute. Shakira's vocal range on the song spans from B3 to D5. One of the lines of the song, in which Shakira sings [...] "I'm starting to feel just a little abused, like a coffee machine in an office", is often cited {{as an example of the}} unusual lyrics present in Shakira's songs.|$|E
500|$|... "Smile" [...] was {{met with}} mixed to {{positive}} reviews from music critics. According to Heather Phares of Allmusic, the song [...] "has a silky verse melody that just barely conceals [...] spite", while she keeps [...] "her revenge sweet, the extra sting being given to it {{by the way she}} sounds like she's singing about how ice cream or puppies or being in love makes her smile". Blender reporter Jon Dolan claims that Allen [...] "deploys a sugary melody as a Trojan horse for a smackdown on a douche-bag ex-boyfriend", as Rob Webb from Drowned in Sound called [...] "Smile" [...] an [...] "infectious slice of bouncing, carnival reggae that punches hard with its opening line: 'When you first left me / I was wanting more / But you were fucking that girl next door / What you do that for?,'" [...] and {{went on to say that}} the theme of the song is melancholy, [...] "set against breezy beats", and while not being [...] "an obvious TOTP contender on the surface, [...] is good but far from one of the LP's choice cuts". Rob Sheffield from Rolling Stone gave a rather negative review, claiming the singer [...] "doesn't sound as if she's trying too hard", singing the song with a [...] "breezy sha-la-la lilt that <b>just</b> <b>made</b> <b>the</b> song seem even nastier". Later, he called Allen a [...] "theoretical pop princess, who just entered the breakup-song hall of fame". Dom Passantino of Stylus suggested that [...] "'Smile' gets burned off the lights by both Sean Paul and Abs when it comes to facsimiles of 'Uptown Top Ranking,' but neither of them could bring the quality of lyricism the singer does," [...] while Slant Magazine reporter Sal Cinquemani was baffled as to why the song, which she [...] "sings without a smirk of irony", is a UK chart-topper.|$|E
500|$|Dek Hogan of Digital Spy stated he [...] "really enjoyed" [...] {{the episode}} {{and it was}} [...] "beautifully dark". He later {{described}} it as [...] "a chilling tale" [...] and [...] "a cracker". Now Playing magazine reviewer Arnold T Blumburg gave [...] "The Unquiet Dead" [...] a grade of A-, describing it as [...] "spectacular", though he noted there were [...] "a few hiccups, such as the weak and convenient plot point that forces the Gelth ... to be drawn out of their human hosts by {{the mere presence of}} gas". He also criticised Eccleston for making the Doctor appear an [...] "ineffectual goof", and noted that he played no role in the resolution. In 2013, Mark Braxton of Radio Times described the episode as [...] "a sparkling script, as crisp and inviting as a winter wonderland", praising the magical atmosphere and the treatment of Dickens. However, he felt that [...] "the spectral swirlings are all a bit Raiders of the Lost Ark". In Who Is the Doctor, a guide to the revived series, Graeme Burk felt that [...] "The Unquiet Dead" [...] was [...] "terribly, terribly disappointing" [...] on first viewing, as Rose and the Doctor's characterisation did not drive the plot and the story was reduced to playing it safe and being [...] "ordinary", as it <b>just</b> <b>made</b> <b>the</b> aliens evil instead of discussing their morality. Despite this, he wrote that the story was still enjoyable, with a [...] "delightfully ludicrous" [...] set-up, [...] "vividly realized" [...] period setting, and the characterisation of Dickens. Burk's coauthor, Robert Smith? , called the episode a [...] "complete mess". He felt that Gatiss was attempting to recreate the classic series, but that it came across as [...] "half-hearted". He felt that there was no moral dilemma and Sneed underwent an unsettling character change. While he noted that Eccleston and Piper were [...] "excellent", he felt that Rose and the Doctor's developing relationship was not subtle.|$|E

Other collaborators included John Hill, Sam Endicott, and Timbaland. Shakira later said that her collaboration with Williams helped her learn a lot, noting [...] "When collaborating you always try and capture something from the other person and I learnt a lot from his method". The singer revealed that the two readied four tracks in five days, and commented that [...] "What was interesting is that he's very fast and immediate in the studio and I'm a little slower". Endicott, musician and lead singer of American post-punk band The Bravery, was personally called by Shakira to co-compose the title track of the album along with Hill. He explained how they both began working with the single, saying she [...] "contacted him , asking if he had any stuff. We never had her in mind.

Haitian-American rapper Wyclef Jean, who previously appeared as a featured artist on [...] "Hips Don't Lie" [...] with Shakira, talked about his chemistry with her, saying [...] "I have a natural chemistry with Shakira. I love the Latin vibe. The Lebanese vibe. I love the multicultural aspect of the CD. These days it's hard for you to pick up a CD and love it from beginning to end.
