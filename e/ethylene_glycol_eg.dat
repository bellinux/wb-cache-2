Ethylene oxide kills all known microorganisms such as bacteria (including spores), viruses, and fungi (including yeasts and moulds), and is compatible with almost all materials even when repeatedly applied.

Ethylene oxide sterilizers and processes require biological validation after sterilizer installation, significant repairs or process changes.

Two base-fluids viz, water and <b>ethylene</b> <b>glycols</b> (<b>EG).</b> Three particle sizes (11, 45 and 150 nm), varying over an order of magnitude, were {{used to analyze the}} effect of particle size. The experimental data has shown typical Newtonian behavior for both W based and EG based alumina NFs The viscosity of EG based NFs is found to be anomalously reduced compared to the base fluid. This reduction in viscosity may be due to hygroscopic nature of EG or due to the presence of water in as-received high concentration sample also, as told by some researchers. However, this phenomenon was absent for water based NFs. The inter-related effects of particle size, concentration and mode of dispersion (mono or poly-dispersed) were investigated. To eliminate the effect of size variation, mono dispersed NFs are obtained by centrifuging and re-suspension of parent NFs. Particle migration under shear is attributed to the reduction of viscosity.

40|$|Observing {{the optical}} {{cross-section}} and electron micrographs of mechanically skinned fibres of frog skeletal muscle, {{we found that}} <b>ethylene</b> <b>glycols</b> (<b>EGs)</b> of small (mono-, di-, tri- and tetra-EGs; Mr 62 – 194) and medium (poly-EGs; Mr 900 and 3350) molecular weights efficiently dehydrate the fibres to shrink them radially without microscopic inhomogeneity. The medium-sized poly-EGs at 30 % weight/ weight concentration absorbed almost all the evaporable water from the fibre. Passive tension measurement at near slack sarcomere spacing indicated that this dehydration by EGs did not accompany longitudinal fibre shrinkage. Chemically relevant fully hydric alcohols (glycerol, threitol, ribitol and mannitol; Mr 92 – 182) showed no appreciable dehydrating ability on fibres. An intimate correlation was found between fibre dehydration and CH 2 -concentration of the solutions. Viscosity measurements indicated that the hydrodynamic radii of the alcohols were compa-rable {{to those of the}} small EGs. Therefore, hydrodynamic radii are not a primary determinant of the dehydrating ability. Additionally, CH 2 -concentration of EGs but not alcohols was found to correlate intimately with the measured viscosity of the bulk solution of EGs. These results suggested that the interaction between water molecules and CH 2 -units in crowded cytoplasm of skeletal muscle affects cytoplasm as a whole to realize anisotropic fibre shrinkage...|$|R

In the present study, the adsorption of brinogen, serum, and plasma were studied by ellipsometry {{on a series}} of well-de ned oligo(EG) terminated alkane-thiols self-assembled on gold.

Methoxy-terminated tri(EG) undecanethiol and hydroxyl-terminated hexadecanethiol self-assembled monolayers (SAMs) were used as references. The results clearly demonstrate that the adsorption depends on the experimental conditions with small amounts of brinogen adsorbing from a single protein solution, but larger amounts of proteins from serum and plasma. The adsorption of brinogen and blood plasma decreased with an increasing number of EG repeats and was temperature-dependent. Signi cantly less serum adsorbed to methoxy tri(EG) than to hexa(EG) and more proteins remained on the latter surface after incubation in a sodiumdodecyl sulfate (SDS) solution, indicating a looser protein binding to the methoxy-terminated surface. All surfaces adsorbed complement factor 3 (C 3) from serum and plasma, although no surfacemediated complement activationwas observed.
