40|$|Tight {{control of}} {{electrode}} paste additions, hard and soft paste levels, baked zone position and electrode temperatures are integral to superior Söderberg electrode management practices. Paste addition is typically effected through briquettes, cylinders or large blocks. Each electrode paste form has its advantages and disadvantages, but probably a more crucial element from an electrode control perspective is {{the frequency and}} amount of electrode paste addition into a Söderberg <b>electrode</b> <b>column.</b> The detrimental effects of excessive soft paste levels leading to Stokes ’ Law segregation of paste in the <b>electrode</b> <b>column</b> are well documented, while several operators have effectively implemented the use of electrode thermocouples to monitor paste temperatures and automated slipping algorithms to control baking conditions within electrodes. Somewhat less well appreciated are the negative influences of inadequate soft paste levels, especially when coupled with excessive paste cylinder or block additions and resulting high hard paste levels. The alternative of insufficient hard paste levels and associated overheated electrode paste must also be considered, and can contribute to paste segregation directly.

40|$|History of the {{submerged}} {{arc furnace}} For more than 100 years SMS Demag {{played a significant}} role in the development of the submerged arc furnace and electric smelter technology. During the past century, the submerged arc furnace has been one of metallurgy’s most amazing diversified melting units, which has found many applications in over 20 different industrial areas, including ferroalloys, iron, silicon metal, copper, lead, zinc, refractory, titanium oxide, calcium carbide, phosphorus and materials recycling, etc. 1 SMS Demag has been developing this technology for more than 100 years and has supplied a diverse market with about 700 furnaces and major furnace components 2. Numerous applications were constantly developed serving various users 3, 4. Such an evolution was possible only because of tremendous efforts in research and development and due to the large range of design solutions. The increasing demand for ferroalloys and de-oxidation agents in steelmaking at the beginning of the 20 th century led to the development of the first few furnaces. Demag, for the last two centuries a major supplier for the iron and steel industry, started with the construction of the first submerged arc furnace in 1906. The 1. 5 MVA unit was installed in Horst, Ruhr/Germany, for the production of calcium carbide and was successfully commissioned in 1906. The ‘evolution ’ and the major milestones of the technology are shown below: 1906 : Reduction furnace (bottom + top electrode) 1913 : 6 -electrode rectangular reduction furnace 1935 : 15 MVA furnace 1951 : SAF with rotating gear for Si-metal production 1953 : 40 MVA large capacity furnace 1956 : Compensated low-inductive high currency line 1957 : Copper slag cleaning furnace 1958 : Hydraulically controlled <b>electrode</b> <b>column</b> 1959 : Large-capacity 60 MVA furnace 1966 : Encapsulated <b>electrode</b> <b>column</b> 1967 : Large-capacity ferro-, silicon-chromium 1974 : Large-capacity silicon metal furnace 1975 : Hollow electrode charging system 1982 : High capacity FeNi rectangular furnace...|$|E

In this article, the performances of various 3 D detector structures are simulated with up to 1 × 1016 1 MeV-neq/cm 2 radiation damage.

40|$|Pressure {{rings are}} key {{mechanical}} components of an <b>electrode</b> <b>column</b> in a smelting furnace. They operate inside the furnace, {{just above the}} raw charge within the furnace flame and hot gasses. Due to their working environment, a pressure ring is typically a water cooled component. Early furnace designs employed stainless steel cast segments that formed the pressure ring. In recent years the industry has {{moved away from the}} cast stainless steel pressure ring design to a manufactured wrought copper design. The fundamental differences between the cast stainless steel design and the manufactured copper design are the change in material, as well as the cooling water passage design. A cast passage can be optimally placed and shaped, whereas the manufactured pressure rings cooling passage is typically made of round straight drilled passages that are not always optimally placed due to manufacturing constraints. These key design differences were evaluated and compared using ANSYS FLUENT to conduct a conjugate heat transfer analysis on each design. Having reliable simulations of existing components help design engineers develop new components in shorter time with improved performance characteristics by providing a tool to assist in understanding of the relationship of the variable design parameters on the performance of a specific component. ...|$|E

The IZ shifted in the proximal direction by up to 2. 4 cm, depending upon the subject and <b>electrode</b> <b>column.</b> The mean shift of all the columns was 0. 6 ± 0. 4 cm (10 % vs. 100 % MVC, P < 0. 001).

40|$|Three-dimensional (3 D) silicon sensors offer {{potential}} advantages over standard planar sensors for radiation hardness in future high energy physics experiments and reduced charge-sharing for X-ray applications, but may introduce inefficiencies {{due to the}} columnar electrodes. These inefficiencies are probed by studying variations in response across a unit pixel cell in a 55 μm pitch double-sided 3 D pixel sensor bump bonded to TimePix and Medipix 2 readout ASICs. Two complementary characterisation techniques are discussed: the first uses a custom built telescope and a 120 GeV pion beam from the Super Proton Synchrotron (SPS) at CERN; the second employs a novel technique to illuminate the sensor with a micro-focused synchrotron X-ray beam at the Diamond Light Source, UK. For a pion beam incident perpendicular to the sensor plane an overall pixel efficiency of 93. 0 ± 0. 5 % is measured. After a 10 o rotation of the device {{the effect of the}} columnar region becomes negligible and the overall efficiency rises to 99. 8 ± 0. 5 %. The double-sided 3 D sensor shows significantly reduced charge sharing to neighbouring pixels compared to the planar device.

A novel technique to diagnose issues with high-voltage components is described. The main application of this technique is noninvasive testing of electrostatic accelerator high-voltage grading systems, measuring insulation resistance, or determining the volume and surface resistivity of insulation materials used in column posts and acceleration tubes. In addition, this technique allows verification of {{the continuity of the}} resistive divider assembly as a complete circuit, revealing if an electrical path exists between equipotential rings, resistors, tube <b>electrodes,</b> and <b>column</b> post-to-tube conductors. It is capable of identifying and locating a “microbreak” in a resistor and the experimental validation of the transfer function of the high impedance energy control element. A simple and practical fault-finding procedure has been developed based on fundamental principles. The experimental distributions of relative resistance deviations (ΔR/R) for both accelerating tubes and posts were collected during five scheduled accelerator maintenance tank openings during 2013 and 2014. Components with measured ΔR/R>± 2. 5 % were considered faulty and put through a detailed examination, with faults categorized. In total, thirty four unique fault categories were identified and most would not be identifiable without the new technique described. The most common failure mode was permanent and irreversible insulator current leakage that developed after being exposed to the ambient environment. As a result of efficient in situ troubleshooting and fault-elimination techniques, the maximum values of |ΔR/R| are kept below 2. 5 % at the conclusion of maintenance procedures. The acceptance margin could be narrowed even further by a factor of 2. 5 by increasing the test voltage from 40  V up to 100  V.

A fabric substrate is very appealing: it is elastic and extensible [2], supported by a well known technology and produced at low-cost. State of the art. Some smart pressure-sensors interfacing with a flexible substrate have been developed, but they are either based on electro-optical fabric ([3]) which is not suitable for the low cost market, or they need expensive and cumbersome PCB electronics ([4]).

Numerical models were built to understand the feasibility and differences of electrochemical detection within an unpacked and packed column. From the simulated results, the surface area of the electrode was not hindered by the presence of the particles in flow condition. An electrochemical microfluidic device has been successfully fabricated on PET (polyethylene terephthalate) substrate using the reverse imprinting technique. The photolithographically produced gold metal electrode lines were imprinted into the PET substrate using a blank mould and produced an inlaid electrode array with overall step residue within 40 nm. The semi-cured thermoset polyester channel was irreversibly thermal bonded on the PET substrate. The devices were able to tolerate pressure in excess of 90 bars. The PET column was packed with 5 μm C 18 silica beads to perform reverse phase chromatography separation. The array was electrochemically characterised using standard redox probes in both stagnant conditions and under flow. Both numerical modelling and experimental data show improved sensitivity under flow and a limiting current which scaled linearly with cubic root of volume flow rate.

40|$|A microshutter array (MSA) {{has been}} {{developed}} for use as an aperture array for multi-object selections in James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) technology. Light shields, molybdenum nitride (MoN) coating on shutters, and aluminum/aluminum oxide coatings on interior walls are put on each shutter for light leak prevention, and to enhance optical contrast. Individual shutters are patterned with a torsion flexure that permits shutters to open 90 deg. with a minimized mechanical stress concentration. The shutters are actuated magnetically, latched, and addressed electrostatically. Also, micromechanical features are tailored onto individual shutters to prevent stiction. An individual shutter consists of a torsion hinge, a shutter blade, a front electrode that is coated on the shutter blade, a backside electrode that is coated on the interior walls, and a magnetic cobalt-iron coating. The magnetic coating is patterned into stripes on microshutters so that shutters can respond to an external magnetic field for the magnetic actuation. A set of <b>column</b> <b>electrodes</b> is placed on top of shutters, {{and a set of}} row electrodes on sidewalls is underneath the shutters {{so that they can be}} electrostatically latched open. A linear permanent magnet is aligned with the shutter rows and is positioned above a flipped upside-down array, and sweeps across the array in a direction parallel to shutter columns. As the magnet sweeps across the array, sequential rows of shutters are rotated from their natural horizontal orientation to a vertical open position, where they approach vertical electrodes on the sidewalls. When the electrodes are biased with a sufficient electrostatic force to overcome the mechanical restoring force of torsion bars, shutters remain latched to vertical electrodes in their open state. When the bias is removed, or is insufficient, the shutters return to their horizontal, closed positions. To release a shutter, both the electrode on the shutter and the one on the back wall where the shutter sits are grounded. The shutters with one or both ungrounded electrodes are held open. Sub-micron bumps underneath light shields and silicon ribs on back walls are the two features to prevent stiction. These features ensure that the microshutter array functions properly in mechanical motions. The MSA technology can be used primarily in multi-object imaging and spectroscopy, photomask generation, light switches, and in the stepper equipment used to make integrated circuits and MEMS (microelectromechanical systems) devices...|$|R
