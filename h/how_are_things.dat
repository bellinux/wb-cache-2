As McCoy {{rolled down the window}} and produced his driving licence, gunmen came up to the minibus and one of them said in a Northern Irish accent, [...] "Goodnight, fellas. <b>How</b> <b>are</b> <b>things?</b> Can you step out of the van {{for a few minutes and}} we'll just do a check". The unsuspecting band members got out and were politely told to line up facing the ditch at the rear of the minibus with their hands on their heads. More uniformed men appeared from out of the darkness, their guns pointed at the minibus. About 10 gunmen were at the checkpoint, according to author and journalist Martin Dillon.|$|E
500|$|But {{there was}} also {{speculation}} over how long Reagan had demonstrated symptoms of mental degeneration. Not long after the attempted assassination of Ronald Reagan, at a reception for mayors, Reagan greeted his Secretary of Housing and Urban Development Samuel Pierce in 1981 by saying [...] "How are you, Mr Mayor? <b>How</b> <b>are</b> <b>things</b> in your city?" [...] Former CBS White House correspondent Lesley Stahl recounted that, in her final {{meeting with the president}} in 1986, Reagan did not seem to know who Stahl was, and that she came close to reporting that Reagan was senile, {{but at the end of}} the meeting, Reagan had regained his alertness. However, Dr. Lawrence K. Altman, a physician employed as a reporter for The New York Times, noted that [...] "the line between mere forgetfulness and the beginning of Alzheimer's can be fuzzy," [...] and all four of Reagan's White House doctors said that they saw no evidence of Alzheimer's while he was president. Dr. John E. Hutton, Reagan's primary physician from 1984 to 1989, said the president [...] "absolutely" [...] did not [...] "show any signs of dementia or Alzheimer's." [...] His former Chief of Staff James Baker considered [...] "ludicrous" [...] the idea that Reagan slept during cabinet meetings. Other staff members, former aides, and friends said they saw no indication of Alzheimer's while he was president. Reagan did experience occasional memory lapses, though, especially with names. Reagan's doctors say that he only began exhibiting overt symptoms of the illness in late 1992 or 1993, several years after he had left office. For example, Reagan repeated a toast to Margaret Thatcher, with identical words and gestures, at his 82nd-birthday party on February 6, 1993.|$|E

40|$|Is reality somehow tensed? Or is tense {{a feature}} of how we {{represent}} reality and not properly {{a feature of}} reality itself? Although this question is often raised, {{it is very hard}} to say what it comes to. For both sides to the debate can agree to certain tensed claims. They can agree that I am sitting right now, for example, or that Queen Ann is dead. So in a clear and obvious sense there are tensed facts. And so how can it sensibly be denied that reality is tensed? My own view is that the question can only be made clear by drawing a distinction between <b>how</b> <b>things</b> <b>are</b> (mere reality) and <b>how</b> <b>things</b> <b>are</b> in reality (metaphysical reality). Thus what the antirealist about tense wishes to dispute <b>is</b> not <b>how</b> <b>things</b> <b>are,</b> which should be common ground between him and his opponent, but <b>how</b> <b>things</b> <b>are</b> in reality. Of course, he will say, Queen Ann is dead but this representation of the facts is not faithful to <b>how</b> <b>things</b> <b>are</b> in reality; and this is so, not because of the reference to Queen Ann or to her being dead, but because of the tense. In a faithful representation of <b>how</b> <b>things</b> <b>are</b> in reality, there will be nothing that corresponds to our use of tense. 1 But when the dispute is put in this form, it is now the realist’s position that seems open to objection. For there is a powerful argument that appears to show that his position is at odds wit...|$|R
