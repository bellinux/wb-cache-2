5000|$|Rubus caesius is a Eurasian {{species of}} dewberry, {{known as the}} <b>European</b> <b>dewberry.</b> Like other dewberries, it is a species of {{flowering}} plant in the rose family, related to the blackberry. It is widely distributed across much of Europe and Asia from Ireland and Portugal as far east as Xinjiang Province in western China. [...] It has also become sparingly naturalized in scattered locations in Argentina, Canada, and the United States.|$|E

It is less sought after, because its fruits are small and retain a markedly tart taste even when fully ripe.|$|E

Thompson, a plant enthusiast, {{collected}} two inflorescences from {{a vigorous}} bramble near the North Central Regional Plant Introduction Station farm southwest of Ames, Iowa. The unusually late flowering and the atypically compound, corymbose {{form of the}} inflorescences suggested that his collection was not taken from a common North American Rubus L. A few weeks later, additional collections were made when the senior author accompanied Mr. Thompson to the site. By using the keys in Flora Europaea (Heslop-Harrison 1968) and Brambles of the British Isles (Edees 2 ̆ 6 Newton 1988) and consulting European Rubus specimens held in ISC 3 and excellent illustrations in the Czech national flora, Kve˚tena Ceské Republiky (Holub 1995), and the Illustrated Companion to Gleason and Cronquist’s Manual (Holmgren 1998), the senior author determined the plants to be Rubus caesius L., the <b>European</b> <b>dewberry...</b>|$|E
