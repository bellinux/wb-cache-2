METHODS: Families of 79 subjects with gallstones (cases) and of 79 subjects without gallstones (controls) were investigated {{for the presence of}} gallstones by ultrasonography. Index cases and <b>index</b> <b>controls</b> were matched for age, sex, and operative unit. Sixty-three and sixty-two husbands and wives of index cases and <b>index</b> <b>controls,</b> respectively, were also studied. RESULTS: Overall, the prevalence of GD was significantly higher (c 2 = 14. 52, P< 0. 001) in the 202 first-degree relatives of subjects with gallstones than that in the 201 first-degree relatives of subjects without gallstones (28. 6 % vs 12. 4 %, relative risk (RR) 1. 80, 95 % confidence interval (CI) 1. 29 - 2. 63). In particular, prevalence of GD was significantly higher in mothers, fathers, and sisters of index cases than that in the respective family members of <b>index</b> <b>controls.</b> The highest RR was observed in mothers (RR= 2. 35, 95 %CI 1. 38 - 4. 3). Prevalence of GD was not obviously different in brothers and also in husbands and wives of index cases and <b>index</b> <b>controls.</b> Family members of index cases did not differ from family members of control cases with respect to the most important risk factors for gallstones (age, diabetes, BMI, and number of pregnancies) with an exception of a higher prevalence of diabetes in fathers of <b>index</b> <b>controls</b> than in fathers of index cases.

40|$|This study {{presents}} an input filter resonance mitigation method for an AC–DC matrix converter. This method combines {{the advantages of}} the one-cycle control strategy and the active damping technique. Unnecessary sensors are removed, and system cost is reduced by employing the grid-side input currents as feedback to damp out LC resonance. A model that includes the proposed method and the input filter is established with consideration of the delay caused by the actual controller. A zero-pole map is employed to analyze model stability and to investigate virtual resistor parameter design principles. Based on a double closed-loop control scheme, the one-cycle control strategy does not require any complex modulation <b>index</b> <b>control.</b> Thus, this strategy can be more easily implemented than traditional space vector-based methods.
