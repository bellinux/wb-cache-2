2500|$|This was {{followed}} by a March 1815 review by John Herman Merivale in the Monthly Review, which claimed, [...] "We have no scruple in declaring our opinion that this production will contribute to the advancement of the author's legitimate fame more largely than any of his former poems. Its principal faults are that it is too long by half, too declamatory, and consequently often cold and spiritless where it ought to be most impassioned, and that it is incumbered by a pervading affection of scriptural phraseology". Not everything was a problem: [...] "these defects are counterbalanced by a well chosen subject, happily suited to the prevailing enthusiasm of the author's mind in favour of Spanish liberty, by a <b>deep</b> <b>tone</b> of moral and religious feeling, by an exalted spirit of patriotism, by fine touches of character, by animated descriptions of natural scenery [...] and by an occasional excellence of versification worthy of the best and purest age of English poetry. We are sorry to be obliged to qualify this praise by repeating that it applies to the work before us only in part".|$|E

6000|$|... [103] This {{character}} has, I think, been traced in {{the various}} [...] writings of Mrs. Sherwood better than in any others; she has a [...] peculiar art of making it felt and of striking the <b>deep</b> <b>tone</b> of it [...] as from a passing-bell, contrasting it with the most cheerful, [...] lovely, and sincere conditions of Protestantism.|$|E
