5|$|A lesbian is a <b>female</b> homosexual: a <b>female</b> who {{experiences}} {{romantic love}} or sexual attraction to other females. The term lesbian {{is also used}} to express sexual identity or sexual behavior regardless of sexual orientation, or as an adjective to characterize or associate nouns with <b>female</b> homosexuality or same-sex attraction.|$|E
5|$|A {{member of}} the genus Latrodectus in the family Theridiidae, the redback belongs in a clade with the black widow spider, with the katipo as its closest relative. A 2004 {{molecular}} study supports the redback's status as a distinct species, as does the unique abdomen-presenting behaviour of the male during mating. The close {{relationship between the two}} species is shown when mating: the male redback is able to successfully mate with a <b>female</b> katipo producing hybrid offspring. However, the male katipo is too heavy to mate with the <b>female</b> redback, as it triggers a predatory response in the <b>female</b> when it approaches the web, causing the <b>female</b> to eat it. There is evidence of interbreeding between <b>female</b> katipo and male redbacks in the wild.|$|E
5|$|After mating, the <b>female</b> washes her vulva thoroughly. If a male {{attempts}} {{to mate with}} her at this point, the <b>female</b> will attack him. After about 20 to 30 minutes, once the <b>female</b> is finished grooming, the cycle will repeat.|$|E
5000|$|While {{the average}} weight of <b>females</b> does not differ {{between high and}} low-density {{population}} conditions reproductive output is greater in low-density conditions compared to high-density conditions. <b>Females</b> in high-density conditions also experience a higher mortality rate. In a study by Wall and Begon (1987) 10 of 29 <b>females</b> in high-density conditions died while no <b>females</b> died in the low-density conditions. [...] A positive correlation also exists {{between the number of}} eggs per pod and the length of a <b>female’s</b> hind femur. <b>Females</b> in high-density conditions produced only half of the eggs produced by <b>females</b> in low-density conditions. Larger <b>females</b> in high-density conditions produce eggs at a faster rate than smaller <b>females.</b> While smaller <b>females</b> in low-density groups produce eggs faster than larger <b>females</b> resulting in an equal reproductive output between small and large <b>females.</b>|$|R
50|$|Of those {{remaining}} in the hospital {{at the close of}} the year, 124 males, 85 <b>females,</b> were epileptic; 37 males, 6 <b>females,</b> were paralytic; 26 males, 5 <b>females,</b> were homicidal; 34 males, 224 <b>females,</b> were suicidal; 57 males, 6 <b>females,</b> were insane convicts; 43 males, 8 <b>females,</b> were of the criminal insane; 215 males, 260 <b>females,</b> were uncleanly in person and habits, and about 109 patients were estimated to be probably curable cases.|$|R
40|$|In {{this pilot}} study, {{we sought to}} compare the vasodilatory and hemodynamic {{properties}} of the peripheral vasculature in the forearms of young, healthy African-American <b>females</b> to similarly matched white <b>females.</b> We used high-resolution ultrasound of the brachial artery to evaluate 11 African-American <b>females</b> and 8 white <b>females.</b> When normalized to nitrate-induced dilation, endothelium-dependent dilation was reduced in young African American <b>females</b> compared to white <b>females</b> (0. 6 in African American <b>females</b> compared to 1. 0 in white <b>females).</b> These results indicate {{the need for a}} larger study to examine this phenomenon...|$|R
5|$|As they {{stake out}} their territories and compete for females, males exhibit rivalry. When they clash, they {{face up to}} each other with bent knees and {{exchange}} horn thrusts. Elaborate individual displays are made during their rivalry and they may bellow, snort and dig their horns into the ground. Once dominance has been established, each male attempts to lure the <b>female</b> into his domain. During courtship, urination and low-stretch are common activities and the male soon attempts to mount the <b>female.</b> A receptive <b>female</b> holds her tail {{to one side and}} stands still while copulation takes place. Matings may be repeated several times and may take place twice or more times within a minute. The male neither eats nor rests when a <b>female</b> is present in his territory and during this time, the <b>female</b> keeps close to the male, often rubbing her head on his torso and sniffing his penis. While in season, a <b>female</b> may visit several territories and mate with several different males.|$|E
5|$|At the 2012 Olympic Games in London, Great Britain, for {{the first}} time in Olympic history, every country {{competing}} included <b>female</b> athletes. Saudi Arabia included two <b>female</b> athletes in its delegation; Qatar, four; and Brunei, one (Maziah Mahusin, in the 400m hurdles). Qatar made one of its first <b>female</b> Olympians, Bahiya al-Hamad (shooting), its flagbearer at the 2012 Games, and runner Maryam Yusuf Jamal of Bahrain became the first Gulf <b>female</b> athlete to win a medal when she won a bronze for her showing in the 1500 m race.|$|E
5|$|Beginning in the 1960s, James E. Lloyd's {{investigation}} of <b>female</b> fireflies {{of the genus}} Photuris revealed they emit the same light signals that females of the genus Photinus use as a mating signal. Further research showed male fireflies from several different genera are attracted to these mimics, and are subsequently captured and eaten. <b>Female</b> signals are based on that received from the male, each <b>female</b> having a repertoire of signals matching the delay and duration of the <b>female</b> of the corresponding species. This mimicry may have evolved from non-mating signals that have become modified for predation.|$|E
40|$|Christophers’ stages {{durations}} {{and effect}} of interrupted blood meal were investigated in laboratory {{to study the}} gonotrophic cycle of Aedes caspius (Pallas, 1771). A first experiment was done with replete <b>females</b> (full blood meal) and <b>females</b> with an interrupted blood meal. <b>Females</b> were then regularly dissected, the durations of Christophers’ stages I, II, III, IV, V were up to 8, 8, 32, 8, 48 h, respectively. A second experiment was done with replete <b>females,</b> <b>females</b> with an interrupted blood meal and <b>females</b> with an interrupted blood meal completed 24 h later. Interrupted <b>females</b> matured 21 ± 5 follicles, interrupted-completed <b>females</b> 92 ± 11, and replete <b>females</b> 120 ± 8 follicles...|$|R
40|$|Totally 7 {{minerals}} {{were reported}} in the present study. For the individual contribution 5 (Sodium>Calcium>Potassium>Iron>Magnesium), 7 (Sodium>Calcium>Iron>Potassium>Phosphorus>Magnesium>Zinc) and 4 (Calcium>Sodium>Iron>Magnesium) minerals {{were reported in}} males, <b>females</b> and berried <b>females</b> respectively. In all sexes sodium and calcium were maximum and magnesium was minimum. Comparatively <b>females</b> contain maximum amount of minerals than males and berried <b>females.</b> Phosphorous and zinc were absent in males whereas potassium was absent in addition to phosphorous and zinc in berried <b>females.</b> Among different sexes <b>females</b> contain maximum amount of minerals (61. 56 mg) followed by males (39. 92 mg) and berried <b>females</b> (35. 11 mg). From the study <b>females</b> contain maximum amount of minerals than berried <b>females</b> and males. So it is recommended to consume <b>females</b> to get maximum minerals. ...|$|R
50|$|Caste of P. chartergoides <b>females</b> can be {{determined}} by examining the ovaries and the spermatheca for insemination. Queens are inseminated <b>females</b> with developed ovaries, intermediates are unmated <b>females</b> with some development of the ovaries, and workers are unmated <b>females</b> with no development of the ovaries. Intermediate <b>females</b> are morphologically similar to worker <b>females.</b> Caste differentiation is very similar in the species Polybia sericea.|$|R
5|$|Both sexes reach sexual {{maturity}} at {{one year of}} age. The male mates with the <b>female</b> by swimming close to her with his head lowered and tail raised, continually whistling. If there {{is a group of}} males, they will chase the <b>female</b> in flight until only one drake is left. The <b>female</b> prepares for copulation, which takes place in the water, by lowering her body; the male then bobs his head up and down and mounts the <b>female,</b> taking the feathers {{on the back of her}} head in his mouth. After mating, he raises his head and back and whistles.|$|E
5|$|Courtship {{begins when}} a male follows a <b>female</b> until he meets her face-to-face. He then strokes {{her face and}} neck with his {{elongated}} front claws, a gesture returned by a receptive <b>female.</b> The pair repeat the process several times, with the male retreating from and then returning to the <b>female</b> until she swims to the bottom, where they copulate. As the male is smaller than the <b>female,</b> he is not dominant. The <b>female</b> stores sperm, {{to be used for}} up to three clutches, in her oviducts; the sperm may remain viable for up to threeyears. A single clutch may have multiple fathers.|$|E
5|$|<b>Female</b> Murray cod, upon first {{reaching}} sexual maturity, have egg {{counts of}} no more than 10,000. Very large <b>female</b> Murray cod can have egg counts as high as 80,000–90,000, although a recent, very large 33-kg specimen yielded an egg count of 110,000 viable eggs. Egg counts in <b>female</b> Murray cod of all sizes are relatively low compared to many fish species.|$|E
50|$|Caribou have {{developed}} adaptions for optimal metabolic efficiency during warm months {{as well as}} for during cold months. The body composition of caribou varies highly with the seasons. Of particular interest is the body composition and diet of breeding and non-breeding <b>females</b> between seasons. Breeding <b>females</b> have more body mass than non-breeding <b>females</b> between the months of March and September with a difference of around 10 kg more than non-breeding <b>females.</b> From November to December, non-breeding <b>females</b> have more body mass than breeding <b>females</b> as non-breeding <b>females</b> were able to focus their energies towards storage during colder months rather than lactation and reproduction. Body masses of both breeding and non-breeding <b>females</b> peaked in September. During the months of March through April, breeding <b>females</b> have more fat mass than the nonbreeding <b>females</b> with a difference of almost 3 kg. After this however, nonbreeding <b>females</b> on average have a higher fat mass than the breeding <b>females.</b>|$|R
25|$|Intraspecific social {{parasitism}} {{may also}} occur, as in parasitic nursing, where some individual young take milk from unrelated <b>females.</b> In wedge-capped capuchins, higher ranking <b>females</b> sometimes take milk from low ranking <b>females</b> without any reciprocation. The high ranking <b>females</b> benefit {{at the expense}} of the low ranking <b>females.</b>|$|R
30|$|From this viewpoint, we {{examined}} the defensive function of the lying posture of P. citri <b>females</b> by manipulating non-lying <b>females.</b> The higher consumption rate of non-lying <b>females</b> by the both predatory mites in turn suggested that the lying posture of P. citri <b>females</b> is effective against wide range of predatory mites. We also examined the defensive function of the dorsal setae of P. citri <b>females</b> by manipulating hair-removed <b>females.</b> Since hair-removed P. citri <b>females</b> readily survived {{in the absence of}} predators, the higher predation rate for hair-removed <b>females</b> demonstrated that dorsal setae functioned to prevent predation.|$|R
5|$|<b>Female</b> genital {{mutilation}} (FGM), {{also known as}} <b>female</b> genital cutting and <b>female</b> circumcision, is the ritual cutting or removal of {{some or all of}} the external <b>female</b> genitalia. The practice is found in Africa, Asia and the Middle East, and within communities from countries in which FGM is common. UNICEF estimated in 2016 that 200 million women living today in 30 countries—27 African countries, Indonesia, Iraqi Kurdistan and Yemen—have undergone the procedures.|$|E
5|$|<b>Female</b> orangutans {{experience}} {{their first}} ovulatory cycle around 5.8–11.1years. These occur earlier in females with more body fat. Like other great apes, <b>female</b> orangutans enter {{a period of}} infertility during adolescence which may last for 1–4years. <b>Female</b> orangutans also have a 22– to 30-day menstrual cycle. Gestation lasts for 9 months, with females giving birth to their first offspring {{between the ages of}} 14 and 15years.|$|E
5|$|<b>Female</b> rodents play {{an active}} role in {{choosing}} their mates. Factors that contribute to <b>female</b> preference may include the size, dominance and spatial ability of the male. In the eusocial naked mole rats, a single <b>female</b> monopolizes mating from at least three males.|$|E
50|$|Intraspecific social {{parasitism}} {{may also}} occur. One {{example of this}} is parasitic nursing, where some individuals take milk from unrelated <b>females.</b> In wedge-capped capuchins, higher ranking <b>females</b> sometimes take milk from low ranking <b>females</b> without any reciprocation. The high ranking <b>females</b> benefit {{at the expense of the}} low ranking <b>females.</b>|$|R
30|$|Six {{groups of}} {{data will be}} {{considered}} in the following sections: males, <b>females</b> and ovigerous <b>females</b> swimming in filtered water; males, <b>females</b> and ovigerous <b>females</b> swimming in water enriched with a high concentration of food.|$|R
25|$|Also, <b>females</b> exhibit mate choice copying. When virgin <b>females</b> {{are shown}} other <b>females</b> copulating {{with a certain}} type of male, they tend to copulate more with this type of male {{afterwards}} than naive <b>females</b> (which have not observed the copulation of others). This behavior is sensitive to environmental conditions, and <b>females</b> copy less in bad weather conditions.|$|R
5|$|Females in estrus are {{followed}} by males, with copulation initiated by the <b>female.</b> The <b>female</b> will hang from a branch and may vocalise. The male will hold the <b>female</b> and the branch and copulate with her. Urine-marking and vocalising are also used by the <b>female</b> to solicit mating. The male may create a mating plug following copulation.|$|E
5|$|Georgia Tech's Evening School of Commerce began holding {{classes in}} 1912. The school {{admitted}} its first <b>female</b> student in 1917, although {{the state legislature}} did not officially authorize attendance by women until 1920.

40|$|Locating {{potential}} mates {{is critical}} to mating. We studied males’ association with <b>females</b> and mate-searching patterns in the guppy, Poecilia reticulata, a promiscuous live-bearer. In the field, we examined whether male guppies respond differently to a shoal of conspecific fish based on {{the members of the}} shoal. We found that more males were attracted to shoals that contained receptive <b>females</b> than to shoals of nonreceptive <b>females</b> or males. We also conducted laboratory experiments to investigate how males use olfactory cues of nonreceptive and receptive <b>females</b> to search for and associate with <b>females.</b> We gave males the option to associate with nonreceptive <b>females</b> when olfactory cues of receptive or nonreceptive <b>females</b> were present and absent, and when olfactory cues were presented alone. Males associated with <b>females</b> most strongly when both cues were presented simultaneously, but when cues were presented separately males’ association with <b>females</b> differed with respect to the olfactory cues that were added. Males associated with <b>females</b> equally with visual and olfactory cues presented separately when the odour cues were from receptive <b>females.</b> However, when the odour cues were from nonreceptive <b>females,</b> males associated with <b>females</b> less with olfactory than visual cues. Searching activity increased when males had access only to olfactory cues. Taken together these results suggest that olfactory cues influence males’ association with <b>females</b> and searching behaviour, and these changes in behaviour are likely to maximize a male’s opportunity to encounter receptive <b>females.</b> <br /...|$|R
40|$|We {{investigated}} sperm storage by <b>females</b> of a predatory bug, Nabis rugosus, {{before and}} after hibernation and with regard to nutritional status. In the field, <b>females</b> had more sperm available before than after hibernation. Food-deprived <b>females</b> maintained fewer sperm than fed <b>females</b> before but not after hibernation. However, after hibernation food-deprived <b>females</b> suppressed egg production rather than decreasing sperm-storage efficiency. Because mated <b>females</b> did not exhibit increased overwinter survival relative to virgin <b>females</b> there is a low likelihood of direct benefits {{in the form of}} ejaculate-derived nutrients. If nutrition-dependent sperm storage by <b>females</b> is widespread in the animal kingdom, our findings may have important implications for the understanding of postcopulatory sexual selection and the evolution of food gifts...|$|R
40|$|Proximate factors {{affecting}} animal behavior include stimuli generated by conspecifics. In spider mites {{of the genus}} Tetranychus (Acari: Tetranychidae), males guard pre-reproductive quiescent <b>females,</b> because only the first mating results in fertilization. In a dual-choice experiment, more adult males of T. urticae were attracted to <b>females</b> guarded by a male than to solitary <b>females.</b> Because spider mites are known to perceive volatiles, we hypothesized that guarded and solitary <b>females</b> differ in the volatile blends emitted. To test this hypothesis, headspace volatiles of guarded <b>females,</b> solitary <b>females,</b> and solitary males were collected, respectively. GC/MS analysis detected octanal, methyl salicylate, ethyl 4 -ethoxybenzoate, and methyl cis-dihydrojasmonate {{in all of the}} groups. Orthogonal Projection to Latent Structures Discriminant Analysis (OPLS-DA) of the blends clearly discriminated guarded <b>females</b> from solitary <b>females,</b> supporting our hypothesis. Individual compounds did not show significant difference in emission rates for guarded <b>females</b> vs. solitary <b>females,</b> suggesting that differences lay in the total blend composition. OPLS-DA did not discriminate between the blends emitted by guarded <b>females</b> and solitary males. In conclusion, the differences in the volatile blends are likely to mediate male discrimination between guarded and solitary <b>females...</b>|$|R

5|$|Males take up nesting sites {{before the}} {{breeding}} season, by frequently calling beside them. Unmated males start nest construction and call particularly frequently to attract females. When a <b>female</b> approaches a male during this period, the male displays by {{moving up and}} down while drooping and shivering his wings, pushing up his head, raising and spreading his tail, and showing his bib. Males may try to mate with females while calling or displaying. In response, a <b>female</b> will adopt a threatening posture and attack a male before flying away, pursued by the male. The male displays in front of her, attracting other males, which also pursue and display to the <b>female.</b> This group display usually does not immediately result in copulations. Other males usually do not copulate with the <b>female.</b> Copulation is typically initiated by the <b>female</b> giving a soft dee-dee-dee call to the male. Birds of a pair copulate frequently until the <b>female</b> is laying eggs, and the male mounts the <b>female</b> repeatedly each time a pair mates.|$|E
40|$|Observations on {{the mating}} and parental {{behaviour}} {{of the green}} poison-dart frog were used to test two hypotheses for the function of female-female competition in this species. The hypothesis that <b>females</b> compete to monopolize as many mates as possible was not supported because: (1) male territoriality was associated with competition for females; (2) intra-female competition for mates was not more common or intense than intra-male competition; (3) <b>females</b> were more selective about mating than were males; (4) estimated offspring production by individual <b>females</b> did not exceed the parental capacity of a single male. The hypothesis that <b>females</b> compete to monopolize the parental care of particular males was consistent with observations that: (1) <b>females</b> competed for males, but were more selective about mating than were males; (2) <b>females</b> remained near particular males and attempted to keep other <b>females</b> from mating with those males; (3) <b>females</b> may have used courtship to prevent males from mating with other <b>females.</b> Both hypotheses were consistent with evidence that: (1) <b>females</b> are large compared with males in D. auratus, relative to closely related species with low male parental investment; (2) <b>females</b> destroyed the eggs of other <b>females</b> when they located them...|$|R
5000|$|<b>Females</b> {{within a}} harem do not display any {{dominance}} relationships {{as seen in}} many other baboon and macaque species. The harem males suppress aggression between the <b>females</b> and prevent any dominance hierarchies from arising. Despite this, some social differences between the <b>females</b> occur. Some <b>females</b> are more socially active and have a stronger social bond with the harem male. These <b>females,</b> known as the [...] "central females", stay in closer proximity to the harem male than the other <b>females.</b> <b>Females</b> that {{spend most of their}} time farther from the harem male are called [...] "peripheral females".|$|R
500|$|Adult P. labiatas {{sometimes}} uses [...] "propulsive displays", {{in which}} an individual threatens a rival of the same sex, and unreceptive <b>females</b> also threaten males in this way. P. labiata <b>females</b> are extremely aggressive to other <b>females,</b> trying to invade and take over each other's webs, which often results in cannibalism. A test showed that they minimise the risk of confrontations by using silk draglines as territory marks. Another test showed that <b>females</b> can recognise the draglines {{of the most powerful}} fighters and prefer to move near the draglines of less powerful ones. <b>Females</b> try to kill and eat their mates during or after copulation, while males use tactics to survive copulation, but sometimes <b>females</b> outwit them. Before being mature enough to mate, juvenile <b>females</b> mimic adult <b>females</b> to attract males as prey. When hunting, P. labiata mature <b>females</b> emit olfactory signals that reduce the risk that any other <b>females,</b> males or juveniles of the same species may contend for the same prey.|$|R
