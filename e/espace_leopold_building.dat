5000|$|The <b>Espace</b> <b>Léopold</b> (French, {{commonly}} used in English) or [...] (Dutch) is the complex of parliament buildings in Brussels (Belgium) housing the European Parliament, a legislative chamber of the European Union.|$|R
5000|$|... #Caption: Leopold Park is a {{major feature}} of the area, and retains some of its {{architectural}} heritage. The Paul-Henri Spaak <b>building</b> of the <b>Espace</b> <b>Léopold,</b> now housing the European Parliament {{can be seen in}} the background.|$|R
50|$|It sits {{between the}} Rue Belliard (Belliardstraat) and Leopold Park and was {{formerly}} called the Belliard building. It housed the Brussels {{activities of the}} European Parliament until the 1990s, when these functions were moved to the new <b>Espace</b> <b>Léopold.</b>|$|R
50|$|In September 2014, she was {{appointed}} rapporteur for changes to medical devices legislation primarily triggered by scandals involving PIP breast implants and 'metal-on-metal' hip replacements.She also hosted an PASD {{event at the}} <b>Espace</b> <b>Léopold</b> focussed on improved labelling of alcoholic drinks.|$|R
50|$|The quarter {{contains}} the European Parliament (with its building {{known as the}} <b>Espace</b> <b>Léopold)</b> and other European Union offices. It is also a major financial district of Brussels. The Brussels-Luxembourg Station was {{formerly known as the}} Leopold Quarter station before undergoing major rebuilding.|$|R
50|$|Following the {{completion}} of Antall and Brandt, it is believed the complex now provides enough space for Parliament {{for the next ten}} to fifteen years with no major new building projects foreseen. Three quarters of Parliamentary activity now take place in <b>Espace</b> <b>Léopold,</b> rather than Strasbourg.|$|R
50|$|Further to {{the south}} is Leopold Park and the <b>Espace</b> <b>Léopold</b> complex of the European Parliament and the {{buildings}} of the Committee of the Regions and Economic and Social Committee. To the east is a car park and Jean Rey Square and to the north is the Justus Lipsius building of the Council of the European Union.|$|R
50|$|The entire European Parliament in Brussels {{used to be}} {{housed in}} the Belliard {{building}}, now called the Delors building (after former President Jacques Delors). This building, and the Bertha von Suttner (ATR) buildings (after pacifist Bertha von Suttner) {{which is part of}} <b>Espace</b> <b>Léopold,</b> now house the Economic and Social Committee and the Committee of the Regions.|$|R
50|$|The Parlamentarium is the visitors' {{centre of}} the European Parliament and {{is located in the}} Parliament's <b>Espace</b> <b>Léopold</b> complex in Brussels. The {{official}} opening was on 14 October 2011 by President of the European Parliament Jerzy Buzek. The permanent exhibition contains hundreds of multimedia components, explaining the European Parliament and other European Union institutions. The entrance to the centre is located on the Parliament's esplanade.|$|R
50|$|The mall {{runs the}} central {{length of the}} <b>Espace</b> <b>Léopold</b> (the European Parliament {{buildings}} in Brussels), with the Alterio Spinelli building {{to the east and}} the Willy Brandt and József Antall to the west joined to the former by the circular Konrad Adenauer footbridge running over the mall. The former station building (see below) has been converted into an information centre and fronts onto Luxembourg Square.|$|R
50|$|The station, {{completed}} in 2009, is now entirely underground, {{although it has}} been designed to allow a maximum of natural light in. Stained glass windows from the original structure were incorporated in the new building. It now covers 16,000 square meters and is owned and operated by National Railway Company of Belgium. The same architect consortium responsible for the Parliament, Atelier <b>Espace</b> <b>Léopold,</b> were responsible for the station's redesign.|$|R
2500|$|On 14 July, Bocelli gave {{a concert}} at the European Parliament's <b>Espace</b> <b>Léopold,</b> in Brussels, Belgium, during [...] "Rome {{in the heart of}} the future", an event hosted by the Vice President of the European Parliament for the seventh parliament, MEP, Roberta Angelilli. A {{screening}} of the film Homage to Rome, directed by Franco Zeffirelli, who was present during the event, and starring Bocelli, in his cinematographic debut, was shown prior to the special concert.|$|R
50|$|The first {{plans were}} {{submitted}} in 1988 {{by the company}} which built <b>Espace</b> <b>Léopold,</b> however they were deemed too ambitious by the local authorities. It {{was intended to be}} tall, serving as a gateway into the area together with the Charlemagne building opposite. The authorities demanded a reduction of 20 metres, giving it 15 floors instead of the planned 20, in order to preserve the visual dominance of the Berlaymont building and the Cinquantenaire arcades.|$|R

50|$|The European Parliament {{has also}} {{collected}} around 363 paintings and sculptures across its {{three sets of}} buildings which it has been purchasing as a pan-European cultural collection since 1979. Lidia Geringer de Oedenberg MEP, {{who is in charge}} of Parliament's art budget, plans to ensure the public have greater access by opening a 'tunnel of art' between the <b>Espace</b> <b>Léopold</b> and the Delors building. A museum of Europe will also be established in the Eastman building near Parliament in Leopold Park.|$|R
50|$|The {{building}} forms part of Parliament's <b>Espace</b> <b>Léopold</b> (the {{complex of}} Parliamentary buildings in Brussels) {{along with two}} new buildings either side which border the square. The whole complex of Parliamentary buildings dominate the eastern view of the square, with the dome of Parliament's Paul-Henri Spaak building mirroring the clock {{at the top of}} the station facade - creating a popular shot of Parliament from the square. Openings each side of the old station building lead directly to the Esplanade of the European Parliament, the pedestrian mall running the length of Parliament.|$|R
25|$|Since {{the second}} half of the 20th century, modern office towers have been built in Brussels (Madou Tower, Rogier Tower, Proximus Towers, Finance Tower, the World Trade Center, among others). There are some thirty towers, mostly {{concentrated}} in the city's main business district: the Northern Quarter (also called Little Manhattan), near Brussels-North railway station. The South Tower, standing adjacent to Brussels-South railway station, is the tallest building in Belgium, at 148m. Along the North-South connection, is the State Administrative City (French: Cité administrative de l'État, Dutch: Rijksadministratief Centrum), an administrative complex in the International Style. The postmodern <b>buildings</b> of the <b>Espace</b> <b>Leopold</b> complete the picture.|$|R
50|$|In 1987 the old Leopold brewery {{was torn}} down in {{anticipation}} of the construction of what would become <b>Espace</b> <b>Léopold,</b> which was unofficially intended to house the European Parliament. Political and legal wrangling had continually delayed a final conclusion regarding the unofficial seat for the parliament. However, as Brussels hoped to keep all of the official institutions in Europe, provision was made {{for the construction of a}} suitable facility. (See : Brussels and the European Union) The construction of the massive facility changed the face of the area again, putting the above ground railway tracks of the Leopold Quarter train station below ground and renaming it as the Brussels-Luxembourg station.|$|R
50|$|The {{station was}} the central feature of the square for much of its existence. However, with the {{construction}} of the <b>Espace</b> <b>Leopold</b> (which now houses the European Parliament) starting in 1989 the character of the square changed significantly. Designs changed frequently, amidst much legal and political wrangling, but ultimately the tracks of the previously open air station were covered over by the flagstone mall that is now seen outside the parliament. The bulk of the station building itself was torn down in 2004, and rebuilt underground, leaving only the central entrance which now serves as an information office. By 2008 the European Parliament complex was complete.|$|R
50|$|The square is {{paved with}} natural stone, bordered by plant boxes and benches facing 24 water jets in the centre which mirror the Maelbeek {{collector}} and storm basin below. Trees line {{the western side}} (not open to traffic) mirroring the axis starting {{at the entrance of}} Leopold Park {{across the street to the}} south. It is named after President Jean Rey and occupies a space between the Justus Lipsius building (headquarters of the Council of the European Union) and Leopold Park (next to the <b>Espace</b> <b>Léopold</b> of the European Parliament). It was inaugurated at the start of the Belgian EU Presidency on 26 June 2001.|$|R
50|$|<b>Leopold</b> <b>Buildings</b> is a {{historic}} tenement block of flats in Bethnal Green, in the East End of London, England, {{in what is now}} the London Borough of Tower Hamlets. It is located on Columbia Road, not far from Columbia Road Market.|$|R
25|$|Brussels, {{along with}} Luxembourg and Strasbourg, began to host European {{institutions}} in 1957, soon becoming {{the centre of}} activities, as the Commission and Council based their activities {{in what has become}} the European Quarter, in the east of the city. Early building in Brussels was sporadic and uncontrolled, with little planning. The current major buildings are the Berlaymont building of the Commission, symbolic of the quarter as a whole, the Justus Lipsius building of the Council and the <b>Espace</b> <b>Léopold</b> of the Parliament. Today, the presence has increased considerably, with the Commission alone occupying 865,000m2 within the European Quarter (a quarter of the total office space in Brussels). The concentration and density has caused concern that the presence of the institutions has created a ghetto effect {{in that part of the}} city. However, the European presence has contributed significantly to the importance of Brussels as an international centre.|$|R
5000|$|... #Caption: The Place du Luxembourg, {{with what}} remains of the old Gare du Quartier <b>Léopold</b> <b>building</b> centre, and the European Parliament behind. Place du Luxembourg retains some of the more {{traditional}} architectural elements of the Quartier Leopold, while the parliamentary complex dominates the now largely institutional area.|$|R
5000|$|Over {{the last}} several years, several {{businesses}} have either left the area or relocated elsewhere. These businesses include Exide, makers of vehicle batteries, CAT, Case Corporation's closest competitor in American made construction equipment, and Lehigh-Leopold, makers of office furniture. This has left some former manufacturing plants around the city empty, but other businesses have moved into them; PPG, maker of auto safety glass has moved into the former CAT plant, and a warehouse has moved into the former <b>Leopold</b> <b>building.</b> In March 2012, the Des Moines Register reported that [...] "Unemployment here is 7.6 percent, compared with the 5.4 percent state average".|$|R
50|$|He {{started his}} {{political}} career as a Councillor in 1857 (when he introduced telegraph links between police stations). In 1863 he became an Alderman and began his philanthropic works. He {{was chairman of the}} philanthropic housing company The Improved Industrial Dwellings Company, which built the <b>Leopold</b> <b>Buildings</b> amongst others. He also worked for many other charities. He was a Sheriff of the City of London in 1866 and Lord Mayor of London from 1872-1873. Having been knighted in 1867 Waterlow was created a Baronet of Fairseat in the parish of Wrotham in the County of Kent and of Highgate in the County of Middlesex on 4 August 1873.|$|R
50|$|Rensselaer Courthouse Square Historic District is a {{national}} historic district located at Rensselaer, Jasper County, Indiana. It encompasses 37 contributing buildings, 2 contributing structures, and 3 contributing objects in the central business district of Rensselaer. The district developed between about 1868 and 1955, and includes notable examples of Italianate, Romanesque Revival, Gothic Revival, Classical Revival, Art Deco, and Modern style architecture. Located in the district is the separately listed Jasper County Courthouse. Other notable buildings include the Mobil Service Station (1955), Murray <b>Building</b> (1906), A. <b>Leopold</b> <b>Building</b> (1881), First National Bank Building (1917), IOOF Lodge (1895), Eigelsbach Building (1899), Eger Grocery (c. 1930), and Worden Building (1928).|$|R
50|$|Also {{particularly}} striking are {{the buildings}} in the Art Nouveau style, most famously by the Belgian architects Victor Horta, Paul Hankar and Henry Van de Velde. Some of Brussels districts were developed during the heyday of Art Nouveau, and many buildings are in this style. Good examples {{can be found in}} Schaerbeek, Etterbeek, Ixelles, and Saint-Gilles. The Major Town Houses of the Architect Victor Horta - Hôtel Tassel (1893), Hôtel Solvay (1894), Hôtel van Eetvelde (1895) and the Horta Museum (1901) - have been listed as a UNESCO World Heritage Site since 2000. Another example of Brussels Art Nouveau is the Stoclet Palace (1911), by the Viennese architect Josef Hoffmann, designated a World Heritage Site by UNESCO in June 2009.Art Deco structures include the Centre for Fine Arts (1928), the Basilica of the Sacred Heart in Koekelberg, the Saint-Augustine Church in Forest (1935), the former House of the Radio building on Flagey Square (1935-1938), the Villa Empain in Ixelles (1934) and the exhibition halls of Brussels Expo, built for the 1935 World Fair.Since {{the second half of the}} 20th century, modern office towers have been built in Brussels (Madou Tower, Rogier Tower, Proximus Towers, Finance Tower, the World Trade Center, among others).

50|$|Brussels {{serves as}} {{capital of the}} European Union, hosting the major {{political}} institutions of the Union. The EU has not declared a capital formally, though the Treaty of Amsterdam formally gives Brussels {{the seat of the}} European Commission (the executive/government branch) and the Council of the European Union (a legislative institution made up from executives of member states). It locates the formal seat of European Parliament in the French city of Strasbourg, where votes take place with the Council on the proposals made by the Commission. However, meetings of political groups and committee groups are formally given to Brussels, along with a set number of plenary sessions. Three quarters of Parliament sessions now take place at its Brussels hemicycle. Between 2002 and 2004, the European Council also fixed its seat in the city. In 2014, the Union hosted a G7 summit in the city.Brussels, along with Luxembourg and Strasbourg, began to host European institutions in 1957, soon becoming the centre of activities, as the Commission and Council based their activities in what has become the European Quarter.

2500|$|International {{opposition}} and criticism {{from both the}} Catholic Party and the Labour Party caused the Belgian parliament to compel the king to cede the Congo Free State to Belgium in 1908. The deal {{that led to the}} handover cost Belgium the considerable sum of 215.5 million Francs. This was used to discharge the debt of the Congo Free state and to pay out its bond holders as well as 45.5 million for <b>Leopold's</b> pet <b>building</b> projects in Belgium and a personal payment of 50 million to him. [...] The Congo Free State was transformed into a Belgian colony known as the Belgian Congo under parliamentary control. Leopold {{went to great lengths to}} conceal potential evidence of wrongdoing during his time as ruler of his private colony. The entire archive of the Congo Free State was burned and he told his aide that even though the Congo had been taken from him, 'they have no right to know what I did there.' ...|$|R
50|$|Mouldings {{of various}} types were common {{external}} decorative features in the 18th and 19th centuries, especially on Regency-style buildings. Many structural elements would typically feature moulded stucco work—pilasters, entablatures, pediments, brackets and courses—while other mouldings would be merely decorative. Typical designs included shells, foliage (especially on capitals) and vermiculation. The Ammonite Order is a Classical order found almost exclusively in Brighton and Hove, consisting of fluted columns topped by capitals whose volutes are shaped like ammonite fossils. Architect Amon Henry Wilds used them extensively. Pilasters and columns of the Corinthian order are also common. Victorian and Edwardian buildings made use of intricately moulded courses and bracketed eaves. Elaborate carved reliefs are found on some of John <b>Leopold</b> Denman's <b>buildings</b> of the 1930s {{as a result of}} his collaboration with sculptor Joseph Cribb. In central Brighton, 20-22 Marlborough Place has a series of reliefs showing workers in the building trade, and 2-3 Pavilion Buildings have Portland stone capitals with scallops and seahorses.|$|R

50|$|In {{the mid-19th}} century, King Leopold I dreamed {{of turning the}} {{uninhabited}} Koekelberg hill into a royal residence area. After his death just before 1880, King <b>Leopold</b> II envisaged <b>building</b> a Belgian Panthéon dedicated to Great Belgians, inspired by the French Panthéon in Paris, to commemorate the 50th anniversary of Belgian independence. The King dropped this project {{due to the lack}} of enthusiasm of the Belgian population. In 1902, King Leopold II visited the Basilique du Sacré-Coeur of Paris and decided to build instead a pilgrimage church, a national sanctuary dedicated to the Sacred Heart of Jesus.|$|R

(of the pub) ... wantonly sacrificed by the new proprietors {{in the interest of}} a bottling store ... (which had) ... anciently enclosed the kennels for a pack of royal hounds". He asserts that when Henry Vlll followed the chase in the Essex (Epping) Forest, he: [...] "took up the hounds here at Upton" [...] about a mile from the toll-gate which subsequently: [...] "gave the name of Forest Gate to a new residential district." ...|$|R
50|$|The {{institute}} {{was founded}} with the patronage and guidance of Count Celso Petrucci Bargagli and other donors, {{and the leadership}} of Pendola. By 1828, Pendola became the first director of the Royal Institute for the Deaf and Dumb (Sordomuti) of Siena, approved by a decree of Grand Duke <b>Leopold</b> II. The <b>building</b> had been first located on Via San Pietro #39, but subsequently moved to the present site, the buildings that used to house the medieval Convent of Santa Margherita. The original building housed and educated 50 deafmute boys. By 1835, a parallel institute for girls was established {{under the direction of}} nuns of the Congregation of Daughters of Charity of San Vincenzo de’ Paoli, with the male component housed in a building on the same street (#62).|$|R
