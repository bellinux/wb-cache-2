It traverses {{the same type of}} terrain as the other six lines; the land <b>is</b> <b>replete</b> <b>with</b> lakes, wetlands, and forested rolling hills. Gradually, the power line turns to the southeast, as it crosses under several 735kV power lines.|$|E
5|$|The fourth movement, in sonata form {{but with}} {{characteristics}} of a rondo, <b>is</b> <b>replete</b> <b>with</b> Haydnesque false recapitulations and conclusions. In one example, the music lands in the tonic {{at the end of}} the recapitulation and apparent coda, and is followed by two measures of complete silence, creating an illusion of finality. However, the main theme is then reprised, and the real conclusion to the work follows some 20 measures later.|$|E
5|$|In his foreword, Kwee {{wrote that}} Boenga Roos dari Tjikembang was {{intended}} to lead readers to consider how fate is often {{at odds with the}} wants of those involved. Critical readings have, however, been diverse. The sinologist Myra Sidharta notes that the book <b>is</b> <b>replete</b> <b>with</b> mysticism common at the time, as does another sinologist, John Kwee. The latter cites four examples: a dream of Marsiti's, later shown to be prophetic, in which she is forcibly separated from Aij Tjeng despite his previous promise that they would never part; a discussion of reuniting with loved ones after death; Marsiti's spirit attending her daughter's wedding; and a scene {{towards the end of the}} novel in which Marsiti's spirit guides Roosminah's daughter to pick flowers for Aij Tjeng and Gwat Nio. Nio Joe Lan, in his history of Chinese Malay literature, notes that Kwee was the only Chinese writer of romances to also write on Eastern (particularly Chinese) philosophy. He finds mysticism to be a common theme in Kwee's works, noting it as particularly well-developed in the later novel Soemangetnja Boenga Tjempaka (The Joy of the Cempaka Flowers).|$|E

25|$|Pietschmann {{published}} {{two books}} {{about his experiences}} during the genocide. In his first book, published in 1927 entitled Unter Eis und Palmen (Under Ice and Palms), Pietschmann recalls his travels and writes extensively about the violence suffered by the Armenian deportees. Pietschmann's second publication, entitled Durch kurdische Berge und armenische Städte (Through Kurdish Mountains and Armenian Cities) was published in 1940. It is essentially the diary {{of his time in}} the region during that period and <b>is</b> <b>replete</b> <b>with</b> numerous illustrations and photographs.|$|E
25|$|Ancient history <b>is</b> <b>replete</b> <b>with</b> {{examples}} of political leaders who derived legitimacy through religious titles. Sargon of Akkad {{claimed to have}} been given the right to rule by the god An and the goddess Inanna. Many ancient Kings of Judah claimed to rule with a mandate from Heaven. Julius Caesar was elected as Pontifex Maximus, the chief priest of the Roman state religion before he became the consul of Rome. Caligula referred to himself as a god when meeting with politicians and he was referred to as Jupiter on occasion in public documents.|$|E
25|$|Ancient Greek architectural, {{clothing}} and coin designs <b>are</b> <b>replete</b> <b>with</b> single or interlinking swastika motifs. There are also gold plate fibulae from the 8thcentury BCE decorated with an engraved swastika. Related symbols in classical Western architecture include the cross, the three-legged triskele or triskelion and the rounded lauburu. The swastika symbol {{is also known}} in these contexts {{by a number of}} names, especially gammadion, or rather the tetra-gammadion. The name gammadion comes from its being seen as being made up of four Greek gamma (Γ) letters. Ancient Greek architectural designs <b>are</b> <b>replete</b> <b>with</b> the interlinking symbol.|$|R

25|$|Elsewhere in {{the high}} country, the {{landscape}} of bare rock and talus left by former glaciers <b>is</b> <b>replete</b> <b>with</b> hanging valleys, waterfalls, serrated ridges (arêtes), cirques, and hundreds of alpine tarns. Some of the highest peaks retain permanent snowfields and even glaciers. Palisade Glacier, {{the largest in the}} Sierra, is located near the park's edge in the John Muir Wilderness. These glaciers are not holdovers from the Ice Ages; rather, they were most likely formed during cold periods in the last 1,000 years. The park's glaciers are now melting rapidly due to increased temperatures, and may disappear completely within a few decades.|$|E
25|$|The archaeological record <b>is</b> <b>replete</b> <b>with</b> {{excavations}} of built structures across time, {{but due to}} {{the natural}} decay of materials and the vagaries of preservation, the further backward in time, the less likely it is for artifacts to have survived. For example, Paleolithic shelter constructions from the Lower Paleolithic (c. 2,600,000 - 300,000 BP) and Middle Paleolithic (c. 300,000 - 45,000 BP) are generally less complete and thus subject to interpretation, while those dating to the Upper Paleolithic (c. 45,000- 10,000 BP) are both more numerous and better preserved. Paleolithic structures generally have no remaining superstructure, and must be inferred from a footprint of artifacts.|$|E
25|$|Qutb's {{experiences}} as an Egyptian Muslim – his village childhood, professional career, and activism in the Muslim Brotherhood – left an indelible mark on his theoretical and religious works. Even Qutb's early, secular writing shows {{evidence of his}} later themes. For example, Qutb's autobiography of his childhood Tifl min al-Qarya (A Child From the Village) makes little mention of Islam or political theory and is typically classified as a secular, literary work. However, it <b>is</b> <b>replete</b> <b>with</b> references to village mysticism, superstition, the Qur'an, and incidences of injustice. Qutb's later work developed along similar themes, dealing with Qur'anic exegesis, social justice, and political Islam.|$|E

25|$|The {{earliest}} Indian {{paintings were}} the rock paintings of pre-historic times, the petroglyphs {{as found in}} places like Rock Shelters of Bhimbetka, {{and some of them}} are older than 5500 BC. Such works continued and after several millennia, in the 7th century, carved pillars of Ellora, Maharashtra state present an example of Indian paintings, and the colors, mostly various shades of red and orange, were derived from minerals. Thereafter, frescoes of Ajanta and Ellora caves appeared. India's Buddhist literature <b>is</b> <b>replete</b> <b>with</b> examples of texts which describe that palaces of kings and aristocratic class were embellished with paintings, but they have not survived. But, it is believed that some form of art painting was practiced in that time.|$|E
25|$|The power {{vested in}} the {{commission}} to suo motu take up matters for discussion and submit recommendations has also worked well {{to the advantage of}} India's legal system. The history of the commission <b>is</b> <b>replete</b> <b>with</b> such recommendations which {{have been made in the}} wake of the hour and where the law has needed change. Further, the commission has been often returned to review its earlier reports in the wake of changed scenarios and the aptness of law in such situations. Euthanasia and related issues, in particular, has been one such area where the commission has been relook the situation at least three times, with the latest being its 196th report on the topic.|$|E
25|$|In {{traditional}} Islamic societies, {{love between}} men and women was widely celebrated, and both the popular and classical literature of the Muslim world <b>is</b> <b>replete</b> <b>with</b> works on this theme. Throughout Islamic history, intellectuals, theologians and mystics have extensively discussed the nature and characteristics of romantic love (ishq). In its most common intellectual interpretation of the Islamic Golden Age, ishq refers to an irresistible desire to obtain possession of the beloved, expressing a deficiency that the lover must remedy in order to reach perfection. Like the perfections of the soul and the body, love thus admits of hierarchical degrees, but its underlying reality is the aspiration to the beauty which God manifested in the world when he created Adam in his own image.|$|E
