It is key to notice that an <b>indirect</b> <b>evaluation</b> of the role of women is seen in this novel also, in a very subtle manner. In the society described, Bimala, like most women, blindly worships her husband. This can be seen when Bimala is described, [...] "taking the dust of my husband's feet without waking him". When she is caught doing this act of reverence, her reaction is, [...] "That {{had nothing to do with}} merit. It was a woman's heart, which must worship in order to love." [...] (18). This scene shows the average woman in this society who believes love will happen and worship is a given in a marriage.

30|$|To {{ensure the}} {{security}} of the VANETs, this paper presents a comprehensive vehicle node security authentication method. The proposed security authentication method consists of two main parts: the direct trust <b>evaluation</b> and the <b>indirect</b> trust <b>evaluation.</b> When a vehicle wants to access the Internet through the roadside base station, the direct trust evaluation method is adopted to validate the vehicle node. In order to objectively determine whether the vehicle node can access the VANET, the trust of the node is directly evaluated based on the historical evaluations from the authority unit (AU). When a group of vehicles form a wireless network to communicate information with each other, the <b>indirect</b> trust <b>evaluation</b> method can decide whether to accept a new vehicle node. The <b>indirect</b> trust <b>evaluation</b> mechanism of the vehicle node is established based on the recommended trust from other nodes in VANETs. The <b>indirect</b> trust <b>evaluation</b> lets the nodes within the network decide the acceptance of the new access vehicle node. We will show the detail of the trust evaluation in this section.|$|R

40|$|This paper {{deals with}} the <b>indirect</b> <b>evaluation</b> of the natural wet bulb temperature, tnw, {{one of the two}} {{quantities}} forming the basis of the well known WBGT index, considered worldwide a suitable and user friendly tool for the preliminary assessment of hot thermal environments. This quantity can be measured by a wet bulb thermometer (a temperature sensor covered with a wetted wick naturally ventilated), or, if not available, calculated from others microclimatic parameters (i. e. the air temperature, the globe temperature, the air velocity and the humidity) using a quite trivial energy balance equation. Because of the strong non linear structure of such an equation, the risk of a multiplicity of steady state solutions could result in the failure to obtain a reliable index evaluation. To dispel all doubts, this work carries out an in-depth analysis of the heat balance equation to be solved for the <b>indirect</b> <b>evaluation</b> of the natural wet bulb temperature. A preliminary investigation of each heat flow term involved in the heat balance on the sensor has been carried out; in a second phase a special continuation method has been implemented highlighting the effect of microclimatic parameters on the multiplicity of solutions. Results show that under free convection the evaluation produces a single solution only under uniform conditions, whereas, in the presence of even slight differences between the air temperature and the mean radiant temperature there can be as many as three solutions. This phenomenon, if confirmed by a further experimental investigation, could become a ticklish matter since a sensor, in principle, has to read a sole value of the measurand. In any case, from a numerical point of view, the presence of many values of tnw greatly reduces the possibility of an indirect WBGT calculation from the other involved physical quantities; as a consequence, the <b>indirect</b> <b>evaluation</b> of WBGT should be clearly avoided by ISO 7243 Standard...|$|E

The vehicle network is largely similar to the interpersonal network. In interpersonal network, the acceptance of a new node mainly depends on the trust value and the recommendation of other individuals. Therefore, the trust value of the vehicle node depends on the recommendation trust from other nodes in the network. However, some selfish vehicle nodes in the VANET may maliciously deny the new vehicle node. The condition is unfavorable for the VANET. We need to distinguish the malicious nodes before calculating the indirect trust value. Based on above analysis, we propose an <b>indirect</b> trust <b>evaluation</b> method.

30|$|Current trust {{management}} researches {{are focused}} on message evaluation and user privacy protecting. The message evaluation can stop delivering of false message and enhance the security of VANETs. Although the trust management can be applied in VANETs to comprehensively improve the security and reliability of VANETs, these methods cannot fundamentally solve the problem. What is more, previous studies do not consider the ‘suggestion’ from existing nodes when validating the new accessing node. Because the VANETs are human-oriented user groups, the vehicle nodes in VANETs can subjectively judge whether to accept the new accessing node. To solve the problem and improve the accuracy of trust evaluation, this paper proposes a security authentication method based on trust evaluation. Our method does security authentication based on both direct trust <b>evaluation</b> and <b>indirect</b> trust <b>evaluation.</b> In the direct trust evaluation, in order to objectively determine whether the vehicle node can access the VANET, we calculate the direct trust value based on historical security behavior information.

We tested {{the performance of a}} new sublingual capillary tonometer in experimental hemorrhage. Thirty-six anesthetized, ventilated mini pigs were divided into sham-operated (n = 9) and shock groups (n = 27). Hemorrhagic shock was induced by reducing mean arterial pressure (MAP) to 40 mmHg for 60 min, after which fluid resuscitation started aiming to increase MAP to 75 % of the baseline value (60 - 180 min). Sublingual carbon-dioxide partial pressure was measured by tonometry, using a specially coiled silicone rubber tube. Mucosal red blood cell velocity (RBCV) and capillary perfusion rate (CPR) were assessed by orthogonal polarization spectral (OPS) imaging. In the 60 min shock phase a significant drop in cardiac index was accompanied by reduction in sublingual RBCV and CPR and significant increase in the sublingual mucosal-to-arterial PCO 2 gap (PSLCO 2 gap), which significantly improved during the 120 min resuscitation phase. There was significant correlation between PSLCO 2 gap and sublingual RBCV (r = - 0. 65, p < 0. 0001), CPR (r = - 0. 64, p < 0. 0001), central venous oxygen saturation (r = - 0. 50, p < 0. 0001), and central venous-to-arterial PCO 2 difference (r = 0. 62, p < 0. 0001).

Therefore, if a new vehicle node wants to access the network, we need to validate the vehicle node carefully to ensure the security of the entire networking. There are a large number of vehicle nodes, and the strange degree among the nodes is very high in VANETs. In addition, VANETs are human-oriented networks. All vehicle nodes in the VANET have the right to decide whether to accept a new node. To attack this challenge, this paper proposes a security authentication method based on trust evaluation. The security authentication method consists of two parts: secure authentication based on direct trust evaluation and secure authentication based on <b>indirect</b> trust <b>evaluation.</b> In the direct trust evaluation, the security vector model is established based on the security behaviors of the new vehicle node. The historical security evaluation from the authority units (AU) is collected to calculate the final direct trust.

The method employs correlation coefficient for distinguishing the malicious vehicle. Then, the recommendations from the malicious vehicle nodes are removed. The final recommended trust is gained by calculating the average recommendation trusts of remained vehicle nodes. Simulation results show the advantage of our proposed method.|$|R

Different coatings o n the Si wafers hinder direct measurements and <b>indirect</b> <b>evaluations.</b> Production peoplerecognize pattern effect frequently as a malfunction in temperature contro l. People in process integration can not easily separate the main root cause of broader parameter distribution in electrical parameters in final test due to the overlapping results of CD variations in lithography {{and those of the}} microload- ing effects in RTP, CMP and plasma etch processing. In this paper we clarify the versatile realisations of pattern effects in different geometrical fractals and for different coating materials. We describe new methods for easy evaluation of pat-tern effects in production. An inherent solution to eliminate pattern effec ts in dual side heated RTP is to create a (hot) black body cavity at the frontside of the production wafer. This can be achieved by positioning an additional Si wafer (called Hot Shield) near the frontside of the production wafer. This arra ngement allows 150 K/s ramp rate and dramatically reduces intra-die variations c ompared to a process where a wafer is heated without the Hot Shield at the same ramp up rate. The enhanced thermal mass with the Hot Shield results in slightly longer "peak time" for spike annealing.

Phenotype screening of freezing injury (lethal temperature for 50 % of the plants [LT 50], plant survival, and chlorophyll fluorescence) and <b>indirect</b> <b>evaluations</b> (molecular-marker-based analysis of vernalization requirement) were used. The maximum quantum yield of the photosystem II photochemistry measured as the variable (Fv) to maximal (Fm) fluorescence ratio (Fv:Fm) analysis was confirmed as a reliable method of screening geneticdiversity for FT in plants at early growth stages. Variability for FT was also found after shorter acclimation at optimal (3 / 1 °C day/night) or suboptimal (12 / 7 °C day/night) hardening temperatures. High levels of FT and WH were found in both winter and facultative growth habits. Facultative genotypes were more responsive to early hardening than spring or winter types. Some of them coped best with frost in both laboratory and field experiments. The most tolerant winter genotypes coped best with prolonged exposure to low temperature in the fi eld experiments.
