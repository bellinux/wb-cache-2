5|$|From the 11th century, newly {{incorporated}} {{features were}} either {{based on the}} traditional dravida plan of the Badami Chalukyas, as found in the Virupaksha and Mallikarjuna Temples at Pattadakal, or were further elaborations of this articulation. The new features produced a closer <b>juxtaposition</b> <b>of</b> architectural components, visible as a more crowded decoration, {{as can be seen}} in the Mallikarjuna Temple at Sudi in the Gadag district and the Amrtesvara Temple at Annigeri in the Dharwad district.|$|E
5|$|Nouvelles Extraordinaires, {{like other}} {{newspapers}} of its time, gave primarily political and commercial information, classified by source and {{date of arrival}} (the oldest, from the most distant lands, coming first). It offered reports on international politics, such as wars and diplomatic relations, as well as coverage of major domestic affairs. The newspaper also contained trivia, editorials and advertising. Like many other early newspapers, it offered judgments and prognostications, {{and was in the}} main a <b>juxtaposition</b> <b>of</b> rumors and announcements from various sources, presented without much unification.|$|E

5|$|The {{most notable}} {{members of the}} group include Ernest Zobole, a painter from Ystrad, whose expressionist work was deeply rooted in the <b>juxtaposition</b> <b>of</b> the industrialised {{buildings}} of the valleys set against the green hills that surround them. Also from the Rhondda Fawr was sculptor Robert Thomas; born in Cwmparc, his heavy cast statues have become icons of contemporary Wales, with many of his works publicly displayed in Cardiff.|$|E
5|$|Vincent DiStephano was not {{included}} in the original screenplay for Alien: Resurrection, but director Jean-Pierre Jeunet admired Cruz' previous work and had casting director Rick Pagano arrange a meeting. DiStephano was added to the cast as the remaining soldier and guide for the band of survivors. In Alien Zone II: The Spaces of Science-fiction Cinema, Annette Kuhn calls DiStephano's death at the hands of the Newborn a perverse joke because of its <b>juxtaposition</b> <b>of</b> infantile features and curiosity with gruesome killing.|$|E
5|$|According to Geisel's biographers Judith and Neil Morgan, Horton Hatches the Egg {{was born}} in 1940, the day after New Year's, {{when he took a}} break from drawing in his Park Avenue {{apartment}} and went for a walk. When he returned, he noticed that he had left a window open in his studio and that the wind had blown one sketch on transparent paper on top of another, making it look like an elephant was sitting in a tree. This account was based on interviews with Geisel, who had told similar stories about the book's creation to reporters asking about his creative process since as early as 1957. The story had changed with each telling but always involved the fortuitous <b>juxtaposition</b> <b>of</b> drawings of an elephant and a tree.|$|E

5|$|Sorabji's {{music is}} characterised by {{frequent}} use of polyrhythms, complex <b>juxtaposition</b> <b>of</b> tonal and atonal elements, and copious ornamentation. Many of his works contain sections employing strongly contrasting approaches to musical architecture; some of them use baroque forms, while others are athematic. His musical output consists of over 100 compositions, ranging from aphoristic pieces to works spanning several hours. Most are for piano solo or feature an important piano part, but he also composed for orchestra, chamber ensembles, organ and other instruments. Partly because of this, Sorabji {{has been described as}} a descendant of a tradition of composer-pianists such as Frédéric Chopin, Franz Liszt and Charles-Valentin Alkan.|$|E
5|$|The K'iche' rebuilt over earlier Classic period {{structures}} in a distinctively K'iche' style. The basic K'iche layout {{consists of a}} westward-facing temple with a steep talud-tablero facade, flanked by two unequally sized wings. This was {{likely to have been}} the temple of Awilix, patron goddess of the Nija'ib' K'iche'. A longer palace structure lies to the north, facing southwards and the ballcourt to the southwest. This K'iche' layout was somewhat distorted by the reuse of the earlier architecture, because the typical Mam settlement layout was built along an axis running from southeast to northwest. As the K'iche' did not completely redesign the entire site along a K'iche' pattern, the <b>juxtaposition</b> <b>of</b> Mam- and K'iche'-style complexes demonstrates the fusing of the local and intrusive elite lineages.|$|E
5|$|The text {{consists}} of different Bible {{passages from the}} Old and New Testament, {{as well as individual}} verses of hymns by Martin Luther and Adam Reusner, which all together refer to finiteness, preparation for death and dying. There are two distinct parts to the cantata: the view of the Old Testament on death shown in the first part is confronted by that of the New Testament in the second part, leading to a symmetrical structure. The <b>juxtaposition</b> <b>of</b> texts from the Old and New Testament appeared before in the Christliche Betschule (Christian school of prayer) by Johann Olearius. Markus Rathey, professor at the Yale Institute of Sacred Music, argued in 2006, that the sermon given at the funeral of Strecker is similar in ideas to the themes of the cantatas. It may be an indication that Bach composed the work for this occasion.|$|E

5|$|III. Scherzo: Allegro vivace – Trio: Un poco più lento. The A {{section of}} the scherzo uses a playful leaping rolled chord figure that is rhythmically and harmonically {{reminiscent}} of the opening bars of the sonata. The B section {{is dominated by the}} <b>juxtaposition</b> <b>of</b> two distant tonal realms. It commences in C-major for a rollicking theme that is abruptly interrupted by a downward-rushing C-sharp minor scale without any modulatory preparation, in a striking cyclic reference to the climax of the preceding movement's middle section. Following this outburst, the B section quietly ends in C-sharp minor a grace-note melody identical in contour to a figure from the theme of the Andantino (2–1–7–1–3–1), before modulating back to the movement's tonic. C major returns in the concluding A section, this time more tonally integrated into its A-major surroundings, by modulatory sequences. The ternary form trio in D major uses hand crossing to add melodic accompaniment to the chordal theme, and is rhythmically and harmonically based on the opening of the Allegro.|$|E
5|$|The {{earliest}} {{source for}} the composition is a copied manuscript dated 1768, therefore {{the date of the}} composition is not certain. Research leads to a funeral of a former mayor of Mühlhausen on 16 September 1708. The text is a carefully compiled <b>juxtaposition</b> <b>of</b> biblical texts, three quotations from the Old Testament and four from the New Testament, combined with funeral hymns, of which two are sung and one is quoted instrumentally, and some additions by an anonymous author. Bach scored the work for four vocal parts and a small ensemble of Baroque instruments, two recorders, two violas da gamba and continuo. The work is opened by an instrumental Sonatina, followed by through-composed sections which have been assigned to three movements. The structure is symmetrical around a turning point, when the lower voices, who contemplate the Old Covenant, are overcome by a soprano calling for Jesus.|$|E
