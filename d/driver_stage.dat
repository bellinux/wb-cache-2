The first requirement is typically solved with a long-tailed cascode stage (2 or 3 double triodes), the second - with two cathode followers inserted between the <b>driver</b> <b>stage</b> and the power stage.

5000|$|For example, in a {{push-pull}} {{power amplifier}} using vacuum tubes, the signal {{is most often}} split by a phase splitter (aka phase inverter) stage which produces two signals, one in phase, and the other out of phase, that is, phase inverted. These two complementary signals then drive {{the two halves of}} the first push-pull stage, which may be either the output stage or the <b>driver</b> <b>stage.</b> The other common arrangements for driving a push-pull stage are by using an isolation transformer to produce the split signals, or by using the in-phase half of the first push-pull stage to drive the other half. A common circuit using this last technique is the long-tailed pair, often seen in television sets and oscilloscopes. In solid state electronics all of these techniques can be used, and phase inversion can also be produced by the use of NPN/PNP complementary circuitry, which has no corresponding technique in vacuum tube designs.|$|E

5000|$|Standard TTL {{circuits}} {{operate with}} a 5-volt power supply. A TTL input signal {{is defined as}} [...] "low" [...] when between 0 V and 0.8 V {{with respect to the}} ground terminal, and [...] "high" [...] when between 2 V and VCC (5 V), and if a voltage signal ranging between 0.8 V and 2.0 V is sent into the input of a TTL gate, there is no certain response from the gate and therefore it is considered [...] "uncertain" [...] (precise logic levels vary slightly between sub-types and by temperature). TTL outputs are typically restricted to narrower limits of between 0.0 V and 0.4 V for a [...] "low" [...] and between 2.4 V and VCC for a [...] "high", providing at least 0.4 V of noise immunity. Standardization of the TTL levels is so ubiquitous that complex circuit boards often contain TTL chips made by many different manufacturers selected for availability and cost, compatibility being assured; two circuit board units off the same assembly line on different successive days or weeks might have a different mix of brands of chips in the same positions on the board; repair is possible with chips manufactured years (sometimes over a decade) later than original components. Within usefully broad limits, logic gates can be treated as ideal Boolean devices without concern for electrical limitations. The 0.4V noise margins are adequate because of the low output impedance of the <b>driver</b> <b>stage,</b> that is, a large amount of noise power superimposed on the output is needed to drive an input into an undefined region.|$|E

5000|$|The {{simplest}} guitar amplifiers, such as some vintage amps {{and modern}} practice amps, {{have only a}} single volume control. Most have two volume controls: a first volume control called [...] "preamplifier" [...] or [...] "gain" [...] and a master volume control. The preamp or gain control is designed differently on different types of guitar amps. On an amp designed for an acoustic guitar, turning up the preamp knob will preamplify the signal, but even at its maximum setting, the preamp control is unlikely to produce much overdrive. However, with amps designed for electric guitarists playing electric blues, hard rock and heavy metal music, turning up the preamp or gain knob will usually produce overdrive or distortion. Some electric guitar amps have three controls in the volume section: preamplifier, distortion and master control. Turning up the preamp and distortion knobs in varying combinations can create a range of overdrive tones, from a gentle, warm growling overdrive suitable for a traditional blues show or a rockabilly band to the extreme distortion used in hardcore punk and death metal. On some electric guitar amps, the [...] "gain" [...] knob {{is equivalent to the}} distortion control on a distortion pedal, and similarly may have a side-effect of changing the proportion of bass and treble sent to the next stage.A simple, inexpensive amplifier may have only two tone controls, a passive bass and treble control. In some better quality amps, one or more midrange controls are provided. On the most expensive amps, there may be shelving equalizers for bass and treble, a number of mid-range controls (e.g., low mid, mid and high mid), and a graphic equalizer or parametric equalizer.
