CWP structure consists of a suction bell, impeller chamber and impeller, diffuser, <b>discharge</b> <b>elbow,</b> lower the main shaft and the main upper shaft, electric motor. Cooler motors wrapped around {{the walls of the}} pump motor CWP. Cooler tube has a diameter of 14 mm and a thickness of 1 mm. In November 2011 there has been damage to the engine water pump. Date March 15, 2013 experienced the same case, the damage occurred in the pump cooler pump motor CWP bottom (lower shaft CWP 6). Cooler winding temperature at around 35 - 75 o C. This section serves to cool the temperature of the pump motor. Cooler pump motor is made of copper-type C 12250, included in a group of pure copper. The study was conducted to determine the causes and mechanisms of failure in elbow cooler. To {{find out more about the}} causes of the failure of this material then, an analysis of the failure of the observations in the form of macro, micro observations (metallographi), testing of SEM-EDX, XRD testing, as well as simulating fluent. Based on the results of testing that was done failures in the cooler tube elbow caused by corrosion-erosion. The mechanism of corrosion-erosion due to the combination of high flow rates and corrosive fluids. At high flow rates physically corrosive fluids clicking eliminate erosion and corrosion protection layer thus opening reactive metal underneath. Suspended slurries strengthen and accelerate erosion-corrosion (Accelerated erosion-corrosion attack). Key Word : Cooler, Erosi-korosi, elbow tube coole...|$|E
40|$|A 22 -year-old male patient {{presented}} with multiple swellings over elbows {{and knees and}} a sinus over the right <b>elbow</b> <b>discharging</b> chalky white material. Skin biopsy of the swelling demonstrated calcium deposition in dermis and subcutis. There {{was no evidence of}} connective tissue disorder or abnormal mineral metabolism. Hence it was concluded as idiopathic calcinosis cutis and is reported for its interesting presentation...|$|R
40|$|One of {{the most}} {{spectacular}} motions is the generation of the acrosomal process in the limulus sperm. On contact with the egg, the sperm generates a 60 -mum-long process that literally drills its way through the jelly surrounding the egg. This irresversible reaction takes only a few seconds. We suggested earlier that this motion is driven by a change in twist of the actin filaments comprising the acrosomal process. In this paper we analyze the so-called false discharge, a reversible reaction, in which the acrosomal filament bundle extends laterally {{from the base of the}} sperm and not anteriorly from the apex. Unlike the true discharge, which is straight, the false discharge is helical. Before extension, the filament bundle is coiled about the base of the sperm. In the coil, the bundle is not smoothly bent but consists of arms (straight segments) and elbows (corners) so that the coil looks like a 14 -sided polygon. The extension of the false discharge works as follows: starting at the base of the bundle, the filaments change their twist which concomitantly changes the orientations of the elbows relative to each other; that is, in the coil, the elbows all like in a common plane, but after the change in twist, the plane of each elbow is rotated to be perpendicular to that of its neighbors. This change transforms the bundle from a compact coil into an extended left- handed helix. Because the basal end of the bundle is unconstrained, the extension is lateral. The true discharge works the same way but starts at the apical end of the bundle. The apical end, however, is constrained by its passage through the nuclear canal, which directs the extention anteriorly. Unlike the false discharge, during the true <b>discharge</b> the <b>elbows</b> are melted out, making the reaction irreversible. This study shows that rapid movement can be regenerated by actin without myosin and gives us insight into the molecular mechanism...|$|R
