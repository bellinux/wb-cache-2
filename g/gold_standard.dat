5|$|The free silver {{movement}} {{reached its}} height with the 1896 campaign of former Nebraska representative William Jennings Bryan, {{who won the}} Democratic nomination for president after his Cross of Gold speech, which decried the <b>gold</b> <b>standard,</b> electrified the 1896 Democratic National Convention. Bryan was defeated in the election by former Ohio governor William McKinley, and in 1900, Congress passed the <b>Gold</b> <b>Standard</b> Act, placing that standard into law. The <b>gold</b> <b>standard</b> was departed from for many purposes by President Franklin Delano Roosevelt's New Deal administration, and completely ended by President Richard Nixon in 1971.|$|E
5|$|American negotiators soon {{concluded}} a reciprocity treaty with France, {{and the two}} nations approached Britain to gauge British enthusiasm for bimetallism. The Prime Minister, Lord Salisbury, and his government showed some interest in the idea and told the American envoy, Edward O. Wolcott, {{that he would be}} amenable to reopening the mints in India to silver coinage if the Viceroy's Executive Council there agreed. News of a possible departure from the <b>gold</b> <b>standard</b> stirred up immediate opposition from its partisans, and misgivings by the Indian administration led Britain to reject the proposal. With the international effort a failure, McKinley turned away from silver coinage and embraced the <b>gold</b> <b>standard.</b> Even without the agreement, agitation for free silver eased as prosperity began to return to the United States and gold from recent strikes in the Yukon and Australia increased the monetary supply even without silver coinage. In the absence of international agreement, McKinley favored legislation to formally affirm the <b>gold</b> <b>standard,</b> but was initially deterred by the silver strength in the Senate. By 1900, with another campaign ahead and good economic conditions, McKinley urged Congress to pass such a law, and was able to sign the <b>Gold</b> <b>Standard</b> Act on March 14, 1900, using a gold pen to do so.|$|E
5|$|Bradley {{declared}} his candidacy {{early for the}} Republican gubernatorial nomination in 1895, and no real challenger emerged prior to the Republicans' nominating convention. Consequently, Bradley was nominated in a relatively harmonious convention. The major issue of the campaign was whether the country should maintain a monetary system based on the <b>gold</b> <b>standard</b> or allow the coinage of silver {{at a ratio of}} 16 to 1, commonly called the free silver position. At their convention, the Republicans adopted a platform that was unequivocally in favor of the <b>gold</b> <b>standard.</b>|$|E

5|$|Cleveland's agrarian and silverite enemies {{gained control}} of the Democratic party in 1896, repudiated his {{administration}} and the <b>gold</b> <b>standard,</b> and nominated William Jennings Bryan on a Silver Platform. Cleveland silently supported the Gold Democrats' third-party ticket that promised to defend the <b>gold</b> <b>standard,</b> limit government and oppose high tariffs, but he declined their nomination for a third term. The party won only 100,000 votes in the general election, and William McKinley, the Republican nominee, triumphed easily over Bryan. Agrarians nominated Bryan again in 1900. In 1904 the conservatives, with Cleveland's support, re{{gained control of}} the Democratic Party and nominated Alton B. Parker.|$|E

5|$|The {{classical}} <b>gold</b> <b>standard</b> {{was established}} in 1821 by the United Kingdom as the Bank of England enabled redemption of its banknotes for gold bullion. France, Germany, the United States, Russia, and Japan each embraced the standard one by one from 1878 to 1897, marking its international acceptance. The first departure from the standard occurred in August 1914 when these nations erected trade embargoes on gold exports and suspended redemption of gold for banknotes. Following the end of World War I on November 11, 1918, Austria, Hungary, Germany, Russia, and Poland began experiencing hyperinflation. Having informally departed from the standard, most currencies were freed from exchange rate fixing and allowed to float. Most countries throughout this period sought to gain national advantages and bolster exports by depreciating their currency values to predatory levels. A number of countries, including the United States, made unenthusiastic and uncoordinated attempts to restore the former <b>gold</b> <b>standard.</b> The {{early years of the}} Great Depression brought about bank runs in the United States, Austria, and Germany, which placed pressures on gold reserves in the United Kingdom {{to such a degree that}} the <b>gold</b> <b>standard</b> became unsustainable. Germany became the first nation to formally abandon the post-World War I <b>gold</b> <b>standard</b> when the Dresdner Bank implemented foreign exchange controls and announced bankruptcy on July 15, 1931. In September 1931, the United Kingdom allowed the pound sterling to float freely. By the end of 1931, a host of countries including Austria, Canada, Japan, and Sweden abandoned gold. Following widespread bank failures and a hemorrhaging of gold reserves, the United States broke free of the <b>gold</b> <b>standard</b> in April 1933. France would not follow suit until 1936 as investors fled from the franc due to political concerns over Prime Minister Léon Blum's government.|$|E
5|$|A fairly {{peculiar}} economic phenomenon {{occurred during}} the war in that the Confederate government issued both regular money notes and interest-bearing money, although the United States did issue Interest Bearing Notes during the war that were legal tender for most financial transactions. The circulation of the interest-bearing money and the convertibility of one kind of money into the other was enforced by fiat and Southern banks were threatened with a return to the <b>gold</b> <b>standard</b> if they did not cooperate. Because of the amount of Southern debt held by foreigners, to ease currency convertibility, in 1863 the Confederate Congress decided to adopt the <b>gold</b> <b>standard,</b> although actual convertibility was not to come into effect until 1879 (hence the law never went into effect, being supplanted by the Coinage Act of 1873 {{and the end of the}} Confederacy).|$|E

5|$|For twenty years, Americans {{had been}} bitterly divided over the nation's {{monetary}} standard. The <b>gold</b> <b>standard,</b> which the United States had effectively been on since 1873, limited {{the money supply}} but eased trade with other nations, such as the United Kingdom, whose currency was also based on gold. Many Americans, however, believed that bimetallism (making both gold and silver legal tender) was necessary for the nation's economic health. The financial Panic of 1893 intensified the debates, and when Democratic President Grover Cleveland continued to support the <b>gold</b> <b>standard</b> against the will of much of his party, activists became determined {{to take over the}} Democratic Party organization and nominate a silver-supporting candidate in 1896.|$|E
40|$|International audienceA {{number of}} {{analysis}} tools {{have been developed}} for the estimation of brain atrophy using MRI. Since brain atrophy is being increasingly used as a marker of disease progression in many neuro-degenerative diseases such as Multiple Sclerosis and Alzheimer's Disease, the validation of these tools is an important task. However, this is complex, in the real scenario, due to the absence of <b>gold</b> <b>standards</b> for comparison. In order to create <b>gold</b> <b>standards,</b> we first propose an approach for the realistic simulation of brain tissue loss that relies on the estimation of a topology preserving B-spline based deformation fields. Using these <b>gold</b> <b>standards,</b> an evaluation of the performance of three standard brain atrophy estimation methods (SIENA, SIENAX and BSI-UCD), {{on the basis of their}} robustness to various sources of error (bias-field inhomogeneity, noise, geometrical distortions, interpolation artefacts and presence of lesions), is presented. Our evaluation shows that, in general, bias-field inhomogeneity and noise lead to larger errors in the estimated atrophy than geometrical distortions and interpolation artefacts...|$|R

5|$|One of {{the most}} {{volatile}} questions of the 1880s was whether the currency should be backed by gold and silver, or by gold alone. The issue cut across party lines, with western Republicans and southern Democrats joining together in the call for the free coinage of silver, and both parties' representatives in the northeast holding firm for the <b>gold</b> <b>standard.</b> Because silver was worth less than its legal equivalent in gold, taxpayers paid their government bills in silver, while international creditors demanded payment in gold, resulting in a depletion of the nation's gold supply. Owing to worldwide deflation in the late 19th century, however, a strict <b>gold</b> <b>standard</b> had resulted in reduction of incomes without the equivalent reduction in debts, pushing debtors and the poor to call for silver coinage as an inflationary measure.|$|E
5|$|The Panic of 1893 {{caused the}} price of silver to crash; the gold price, however, {{remained}} fixed, as the United States was on the <b>gold</b> <b>standard.</b> The influx of silver miners into the gold mines caused a lowering of wages. Mine owners demanded longer hours for less pay.|$|E

50|$|Towards {{the end of}} the 19th century, some silver {{standard}} countries {{began to}} peg their silver coin units to the <b>gold</b> <b>standards</b> of the United Kingdom or the United States.

5|$|After McKinley's inauguration, {{increases}} in gold availability from new discoveries and improved refining methods {{led to a}} considerable increase in the money supply. Even so, in 1900, Congress passed the <b>Gold</b> <b>Standard</b> Act, formally placing the United States on that standard. Although Bryan ran again on a silver platform in the 1900 presidential election, the issue failed to produce the same resonance with the voters. McKinley won more easily than in 1896, making inroads in the silver West.|$|E
5|$|Argentina {{abandoned}} the <b>gold</b> <b>standard</b> in December 1929, earlier than most countries. For {{much of the}} previous period, the country had operated a currency board, in which a body known as the caja de conversión was charged with maintaining the peso's value in gold. The devaluation of the peso increased the competitiveness of its exports and protected domestic production.
