Between c3 and d3 of Fig. XIV. {{there may}} be evidently another condition, {{represented}} at 6, Plate II., and formed by the insertion of a central shaft within the four external ones. This central shaft we may suppose to expand {{in proportion to the}} weight it has to carry. If the external shafts expand in the same proportion, the entire form remains unchanged; but if they do not expand, they may (1) be pushed out by the <b>expanding</b> <b>shaft,</b> or (2) be gradually swallowed up in its expansion, as at 4, Plate II. If they are pushed out, they are removed farther from each other by every increase of the central shaft; and others may then be introduced in the vacant spaces; giving, on the plan, a central orb with an ever increasing host of satellites, 10, Plate II.; the satellites themselves often varying in size, and perhaps quitting contact with the central shaft. Suppose them in any of their conditions fixed, while the inner shaft expands, and they will be gradually buried in it, forming more complicated conditions of 4, Plate II. The combinations are thus altogether infinite, even supposing the central shaft to be circular only; but their infinity is multiplied by many other infinities when the central shaft itself becomes square or crosslet on the section, or itself multifoiled (8, Plate II.) with satellite shafts eddying about its recesses and angles, in every possible relation of attraction. Among these endless conditions of change, the choice of the architect is free, this only being generally noted: that, as the whole value of such piers depends, first, upon their being wisely fitted to the weight above them, and, secondly, upon their all working together: and one not failing the rest, perhaps to the ruin of all, he must never multiply shafts without visible cause in the disposition of members superimposed:[41] and in his multiplied group he should, if possible, avoid a marked separation between the large central shaft and its satellites; for if this exist, the satellites will either appear useless altogether, or else, which is worse, they will look as if they were meant to keep the central shaft together by wiring or caging it in; like iron rods set round a supple cylinder,--a fatal fault in the piers of Westminster Abbey, and, in a less degree, in the noble nave of the cathedral of Bourges.|$|E
50|$|Typical {{radiographic}} appearances include skeletal demineralization, <b>expanded</b> <b>shafts</b> of the metacarpals and phalanges with widenend medullary cavities, cardiomegaly, and intramural calcification of {{the proximal}} aorta with occasional extension into the aortic or mitral valves.|$|R
30|$|In {{the open}} gap model {{which is often}} used to compare the {{mechanical}} strength of osteosynthesis implants, a composite cylinder is cut in half and both ends are fixated with a plate (Figure  1 A). That construct is then tested under axial and torsion loads, with motion measured across the gap. As documented by Stoffel et al. gap size and plate length are important factors in the overall stability [[2]]. It is therefore not unexpected that under these circumstances a shorter and slimmer plate has a lower stiffness and fatigue strength than a plate that is longer and that has an <b>expanded</b> <b>shaft.</b>|$|R
50|$|Airshafts {{also called}} Air <b>Expanding</b> <b>shafts</b> {{are used in}} the {{manufacturing}} processes for fitting into a core onto which materials such as paper, card and plastic film are wound. An airshaft is designed so that, on fitting into a core, it can be readily expanded, thereby achieving a quick and firm attachment, it may also be easily deflated to facilitate easy withdrawal of the shaft after winding of product is complete. Their efficient design makes them ideal for mounting onto bearing housings to enable the winding or unwinding of rolls of stock material with the minimum of equipment down time. The advantage of using an airshaft is its ability to grip the core, without damage, whilst providing a positive interface to control the web via motors & brakes. Airshafts are available as either lug type (with bladder down the centre) or strip type (bladders {{on the periphery of the}} shaft).|$|R
50|$|Frenulum breve is a {{condition}} in which the frenulum is short and restricts the movement of the foreskin, {{which may or may not}} interfere with normal sexual activity. The condition can be treated by frenuloplasty, frenectomy, or circumcision. Frenulum breve may contribute to frenular chordee, where the glans is pulled toward the vernal body of the penis. Frenulum breveu may also be treated by manually <b>expanding</b> the <b>shaft</b> skin by stretching.|$|R
50|$|An {{expandable}} baton (also {{referred to}} variously as a collapsible baton, telescopic or telescoping baton, tactical baton, spring cosh, ASP, Extendable, or extendo slang) is typically {{composed of a}} cylindrical outer shaft containing telescoping inner shafts (typically 2 or 3, depending on the design) that lock into each other when <b>expanded.</b> The <b>shafts</b> are usually made of steel, but lightweight baton models may have their shafts made from other materials such as aluminium alloy.|$|R

50|$|The mines were <b>expanded</b> {{with new}} <b>shafts</b> and {{machinery}} {{was brought in}} to assist productivity by bringing ore to the surface, pumping out the shafts and processing the ore on the surface. Large waterwheels provided the power source, including Rhod Goch (Red Wheel), which, at 63 feet in diameter, was {{one of the largest in}} Britain.|$|R
50|$|The {{rotating}} {{packs of}} disks (known as the media) {{are contained in}} a tank or trough and rotate at between 2 and 5 revolutions per minute. Commonly used plastics for the media are polyethylene, PVC and <b>expanded</b> polystyrene. The <b>shaft</b> is aligned with the flow of wastewater so that the discs rotate {{at right angles to}} the flow with several packs usually combined to make up a treatment train. About 40% of the disc area is immersed in the wastewater.|$|R
5000|$|Coal was {{discovered}} {{in the area around}} near Kaitangata in the late 1840s and William Aitchinson began extracting coal near Kaitangata in 1862. In 1871 he leased his mine to John Thompson of Balclutha. In September 1872 Thompson and Aitchenson reached agreement to raise capital to expand their mining operation by way of a new company, the Kaitangata Coal Mining Company. [...] The underground mine produced sub-bituminous coal of a high quality. In 1875, the Company merged with the recently created Kaitangata Railway Company to become the Kaitangata Railway and Coal Company Ltd. Through late 1875 and early 1876 the mine was <b>expanded</b> with additional <b>shafts</b> being driven in anticipation of the new railway. Once the railway had been completed the company announced further expansion intentions with a desire by 1877 to bring production up to 100 tons per week. There were 41 men employed at the mine in mid-1877.|$|R
40|$|In {{the design}} of {{foundations}} for buildings and structures of various purposes, including improved risk, weak water-saturated clay soils with low mechanical characteristics are often found on a construction site. One of the possible ways of using them as a foundation is to seal them in various ways, including using pile drains of sand or rock stone material {{that are capable of}} both absorbing the load at the base and accelerating the process of filtration consolidation. This paper describes an analytical {{solution to the problem of}} interaction between the pile and the mattress with the surrounding soil of the foundation, taking into account the possibility of <b>expanding</b> the pile <b>shaft.</b> Solutions are obtained for determining the stresses in the shaft of the pile drain and in the soil under the mattress. The solution takes into account the influence of the pre-stressed state of the foundation after compaction on the formation of a stress-strain state during the erection and operation of structures. The solutions are relevant for consolidating pile drains made of rubble or for jet grouting piles, the rigidity of which is comparable to the rigidity of the surrounding soil. The paper describes the technique for determining the characteristics of the strength and deformability of the converted foundation and the results of large-scale tests at the experimental site for the construction of a large energy facility in Russia...|$|R
60|$|This green boss {{is called}} by botanists the pistil, which word {{consists}} of the two first syllables of the Latin pistillum, otherwise more familiarly Englished into 'pestle.' The meaning of the botanical word is of course, also, that {{the central part of}} a flower-cup has to it something of the relations that a pestle has to a mortar! Practically, however, as this pestle has no pounding functions, I think the word is misleading as well as ungraceful; and that we may find a better one after looking a little closer into the matter. For this pestle is divided generally into three very distinct parts: there is a storehouse at the bottom of it for the seeds of the plant; above this, a shaft, often of considerable length in deep cups, rising to the level of their upper edge, or above it; and at the top of these <b>shafts</b> an <b>expanded</b> crest. This <b>shaft</b> the botanists call 'style,' from the Greek word for a pillar; and the crest of it--I do not know why--stigma, from the Greek word for 'spot.' The storehouse for the seeds they call the 'ovary,' from the Latin ovum, an egg. So you have two-thirds of a Latin word, (pistil)--awkwardly and disagreeably edged in between pestle and pistol--for the whole thing; you have an English-Latin word (ovary) for the bottom of it; an English-Greek word (style) for the middle; and a pure Greek word (stigma) for the top.|$|R
6000|$|... 37. But {{the spirit}} that was in these Aphrodites of the earth was not then, nor in them, to be restrained. Colonnade rose over colonnade; the {{pediment}} of the western front was lifted into a detached and scenic wall; story above story sprang the multiplied arches of the Campanile, and the eastern pyramidal fire-type, lifted from its foundation, was placed upon the summit. With the superimposed arcades of the principal front arose the necessity, instantly felt by their subtle architects, of a new proportion in the column; the lower wall inclosure, necessarily {{for the purposes of}} Christian worship continuous, and needing no peristyle, rendered the lower columns a mere facial decoration, whose proportions were evidently no more to be regulated by the laws hitherto observed in detached colonnades. The column <b>expanded</b> into the <b>shaft,</b> or into the huge pilaster rising unbanded from tier to tier; shaft and pilaster were associated in ordered groups, and the ideas of singleness and limited elevation once attached to them, swept away for ever; the stilted and variously centered arch existed already: the pure ogive followed--where first exhibited we stay not to inquire;--finally, and chief of all, the great mechanical discovery of the resistance of lateral pressure by the weight of the superimposed flanking pinnacle. Daring concentrations of pressure upon narrow piers were the immediate consequence, and the recognition of the buttress as a feature in itself agreeable and susceptible of decoration. The glorious art of painting on glass added its temptations; the darkness of northern climes both rendering the typical character of Light more deeply felt than in Italy, and necessitating its admission in larger masses; the Italian, even at the period of his most exquisite art in glass, retaining the small Lombard window, whose expediency will hardly be doubted by anyone who has experienced the transition from the scorching reverberation of the white-hot marble front, to the cool depth of shade within, and whose beauty will not be soon forgotten by those who have seen the narrow lights of the Pisan duomo announce by their redder burning, not like transparent casements, but like characters of fire searing the western wall, the decline of day upon Capraja.|$|R
