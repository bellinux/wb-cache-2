Restrictive regulations are being used by many nations to deal with this problem, focusing on treatments, such as recycling, to avoid resource depletion. Specific rules for disposal of used lubricant oil already exist in various countries, including Brazil, but not for its containers. Using the life cycle assessment methodology, this article evaluates different management options for the destination of Lubricant Oil Plastic Containers (LOPCs), comparing recycling and incineration to disposal in an industrial landfill. Results show that reducing the proportion of LOPCs destined to the landfill has positive impacts in lowering the burdens caused in the life cycle of LOPCs. Incineration, which is not a technology used for destination of LOPCs in Brazil, proved to be a promising option when combined with recycling for treatment of this kind of waste. Combining different destinations is also a good option as long as economic, logistics and the environment are taken into consideration.

40|$|Background: Hospital waste {{contains}} a large quantity of dangerous pathogenic agents, which are hazardous {{to the health}} of man, animal, plant and the environment. In Iran, like many other developing countries, not enough attention is paid to this matter and available information regarding the generation and disposal of medical wastes are low. The existing information about production and disposal of wastes in our hospitals is little and incomplete. In this study, a survey on hospital waste management system in Bushehr province hospitals was conducted. Methods: In this cross-sectional study, 8 hospitals in Bushehr province were investigated during a period of 6 months using a questionnaire, interviews and direct observations. The questionnaire had 93 questions (open and closed) about general information on the hospitals and about various systems of managing hospital waste according to the World Health Organization suggested survey questionnaire for hospital waste management in developing countries. Results: In hospitals of bushehr province, waste generation rate was 2615 kg/day, including domestic waste (51. 7 %), infectious waste (20. 8 %), sharps (15. 2 %) and chemical and drugs wastes (12. 3 %). In almost all hospitals, segregation of infectious waste from domestic waste at the place of origin and putting them in special containers had been done but this segregation wasn’t complete and sometimes some <b>hazardous</b> <b>waste</b> were <b>disposed</b> <b>of</b> in domestic <b>waste</b> containers. All hospitals used a color coding system for waste containers, 75 % of hospitals had incinerators. In others, waste was carried out by municipal service daily.

This project report provides an assessment of the first household hazardous materials publicity campaign and collection event held in Illinois. The collection event date was September 13, 1987, in Champaign County. This report describes survey results concerning the state of public awareness, use, and disposal of household hazardous materials prior to and immediately after the publicity campaign in Champaign County. Comparisons with the city of Decatur are included. Results from the two surveys indicated that 30 - 40 percent of the urban households had heard about <b>hazardous</b> <b>waste</b> problems before the campaign and nearly 60 percent had heard about them after the event. Most of the public could assess hazardousness of materials reasonably well. Farmers were generally much better informed than were city dwellers. In all communities, the better-educated and established citizens were better informed about <b>hazardous</b> <b>waste</b> than were others and were more likely to become better informed during the campaign. While each farm household had on average over 26 partial or full containers of hazardous material, urban households had an average of 10 such containers at their homes. This came to an estimated total of over 390, 000 partial or full containers at Champaign/Urbana homes alone. Established citizens, homeowners, and larger households had greater quantities. Environmentally inappropriate disposal of <b>hazardous</b> <b>waste</b> from homes exceeded an estimated total of 38, 600 containers per year in Champaign/Urbana, 30, 750 per year in Decatur, and 1, 490 per year among Champaign County farmers. The inappropriate disposal of these containers from Champaign/Urbana would, if left uncrushed, fill a 74 to 158 cubic yard site. On public policy issues, overwhelming majorities in each community expressed support for various types of special household <b>hazardous</b> <b>waste</b> collection programs. The collection event was very successful in extending basic awareness and in reaching households with unwanted <b>hazardous</b> <b>waste.</b> The event drew only 0. 7 percent of the city households but collected 7 percent of the quantity <b>of</b> <b>hazardous</b> <b>waste</b> improperly <b>disposed</b> <b>of</b> each year.

40|$|M. Sc. Waste {{generation}} and waste disposal forms {{part of our}} everyday lives, even more so for a tanning facility. This mini dissertation discusses the delisting of waste generated at a tanning facility. This facility produces crust leather from partially tanned hides received from other tanneries in the Mpumalanga province. Crust leather is the product in the penultimate process before it attains its desired leather like properties. The crust leather is sent to a finishing plant for the final process of painting before it is supplied to the automotive industry for upholstery purposes. Large volumes of raw materials including chemicals, water and hides {{are used in the}} retanning process to produce crust leather. During the production of this leather various waste streams are generated including effluent, solid waste and tanning sludge. The tanning sludge is classified in terms of the Department of Water Affairs and Forestry’s Minimum Requirements for Handling, Classification and Disposal of <b>Hazardous</b> <b>waste</b> as a possible or potentially <b>hazardous</b> <b>waste.</b> <b>Hazardous</b> <b>waste</b> must be <b>disposed</b> <b>of</b> to a permitted <b>hazardous</b> <b>waste</b> landfill site which has a significant cost implication for the tanning facility. This mini-dissertation focuses on the attempt to delist the tanning sludge. This mini-dissertation highlights the problems associated with <b>hazardous</b> <b>waste</b> disposal in the form of sludge from the tannery. This disposal is expensive because there is only one permitted <b>hazardous</b> <b>waste</b> landfill site in the Gauteng and Mpumalanga provinces. This site is called Holfontein and is situated approximately 200 km from the tanning facility. The high disposal cost encountered is owing to the specialist management required because of the environmental risks involved in operating this waste disposal site. However, an option to delist the <b>hazardous</b> tanning sludge <b>waste</b> is available to the tanning facility, which could mean that the hazard rating is reduced from extremely hazardous to a lower rating or even to general waste. Delisting the tanning sludge will allow it to be <b>disposed</b> <b>of</b> to a general landfill site. Previous attempts to delist the tanning sludge were not successful as the presence of hexavalent chromium (Cr (VI)) and cyanide (CN) in the tanning sludge caused it to remain classified as extremely <b>hazardous</b> <b>waste.</b> Due to the increasing waste disposal cost the tanning facility once again engaged in the processes to delist the tanning sludge. The personnel of the tanning facility is of the opinion that hexavalent chromium (Cr(VI)) and cyanide (CN) should not be present in the tanning sludge as these substances are not used generally in the tanning industry. Therefore, the main aim of this mini-dissertation is to delist the tanning sludge to general waste thus allowing it to be <b>disposed</b> <b>of</b> to a general landfill site, which in turn will result in a reduction in the waste disposal costs. Delisting of <b>hazardous</b> <b>waste</b> produced in a tannery In order to achieve the main aim, the study entailed a literature review of the retanning process explaining the generation of the various waste streams, the possible presence of chromium (Cr) and hexavalent chromium (Cr(VI) in the process, and a review of the environmental legislation that will determine the waste disposal options. To delist the tanning sludge the tanning facility followed a defined procedure as determined by the Department of Water Affairs and Forestry. The tanning sludge was assessed using analytical procedures as specified. The objective was to characterise the leachability of the tanning sludge, as well as to verify the presence of any hazardous substances which prevent the tanning sludge from being delisted. Leachability is the potential mobilisation of substances from the sludge under circumstances similar than that of the waste disposal sites. This includes the presence of hexavalent chromium (Cr(VI)) and cyanide (CN) in the tanning sludge. In an approach to verify the presence of hexavalent chromium (Cr(VI)) and cyanide (CN) in the tanning sludge the composition of the raw materials (chemicals and hides) were evaluated and samples were taken from the various effluent streams. The tanning sludge was sampled separately to determine the leachability characteristics. No hexavalent chromium (Cr(VI)) and cyanide (CN) were found to be present in the raw materials or in any of the waste effluent streams. However, small quantities of cyanide (CN) and hexavalent chromium (Cr(VI)) were found to be present in the tanning sludge. The reason for the presence of these constituents could not be determined as it was proved that hexavalent chromium (Cr(VI)) and cyanide (CN) do not enter the process through the raw materials. It was further proved that the process does not support circumstances to oxidise trivalent chromium to hexavalent chromium (Cr(VI)). Further, the presence of cyanide (CN) cannot be explained since it is not a substance that is generally used in the tanning industry. Part of the study included determining treatment options for the tanning sludge. It was found that treating the tanning sludge with lime reduced the concentration of heavy metals such as hexavalent chromium (Cr(VI)). However, after analysis and classification of the tanning sludge it was found that it was not the hexavalent chromium (Cr(VI)) and cyanide (CN) that prevented the tanning sludge from being delisted to a lower hazard rating but rather the presence of small quantities of cadmium (Cd). Cadmium (Cd) is classified as extremely hazardous and therefore it is this substance that is responsible for the high hazard rating classification of the sludge. Although the objective to delist the tanning sludge was not achieved, it was determined that the <b>waste</b> can be <b>disposed</b> <b>of</b> to a general waste landfill site permitted to accept a certain amount of waste containing heavy metals (such as chromium and manganese). The reduction in the waste disposal cost will therefore be achieved and the tanning facility will <b>dispose</b> <b>of</b> their <b>waste</b> in a Delisting of <b>hazardous</b> <b>waste</b> produced in a tannery sound and environmentally responsible method ensuring it will not {{have a significant impact on}} the environment...|$|R

The forecasting model proposed draws from the consideration that a landfill facility could be placed only in an area satisfying specific requirements, for example with regard to geological, hygienic, landscape and urban matters. Since eligible areas are limited, a natural limit to the exploitation of dumping ground exists. The main assumption of this study is that the quantity <b>of</b> <b>waste</b> <b>disposed</b> <b>of</b> in landfills follows a trend that can be described with the mathematical model of the Logistic function. The values of the historical series describing the streams of municipal solid waste landfilled in Italy are used as input data. The proposed model allows to perform forecasts that could be useful to governments for the definition of environmental policies and for a timely and adequate planning of the waste management system...|$|R
50|$|In Canada, {{the pulp}} and paper {{industry}} released 5% of the total industrial <b>waste</b> <b>disposed</b> <b>of</b> to water in 2015. In 2014, 97.5%, 99.9% and 99.8% of effluent samples from {{pulp and paper}} mills met regulatory requirements for toxicity tests on fish, biochemical oxygen demand, and total suspended solids, respectively.|$|R

5000|$|Economies {{of scale}} - The cost of {{producing}} goods or services decreases as production increases. With regards to solid waste this principle applies to landfills where {{the average cost of}} landfill construction, operation, and maintenance decreases as <b>waste</b> <b>disposed</b> <b>of</b> increases. This propels interstate trade where private parties divert wastes to large regional landfills.|$|R
25|$|Health {{care workers}} are to {{minimize}} their interaction with sharps <b>waste</b> by <b>disposing</b> <b>of</b> it in a sealable container. Attempts by {{health care workers}} to disassemble sharps waste is kept to a minimum. Strict hospital protocols and government regulations ensure that hospital workers handle sharps <b>waste</b> safely and <b>dispose</b> <b>of</b> it effectively.|$|R

5000|$|A {{landfill}} fire {{occurs when}} <b>waste</b> <b>disposed</b> <b>of</b> in a landfill ignites and spreads. Two types of landfills fires are generally recognized. Surface Fires and Deep Seated Fires. Surface fires typically occur in underdeveloped countries that lack capacity to properly cover waste with inert daily and intermediate cover. Modern {{examples of such}} fires include the Deonar and Ghazipur Landfills in India, Cerro Patacon Landfill in Panama and the New Providence Landfill in the Bahamas.|$|R
