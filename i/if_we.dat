5|$|<b>If</b> <b>we</b> {{want more}} fish, we should shift that {{person who has}} a {{comparative}} advantage in fish hunting (i.e. Friday) out of coconut gathering and into fish hunting. When Friday is producing 96 pounds of fish, he is fully occupied. If fish production is to be increased beyond this point, Crusoe will have to start hunting fish. Here onward, {{the slope of the}} joint PPF is -2. <b>If</b> <b>we</b> want to produce only fish, then the economy will have 144 pounds of fish, 48 from Crusoe and 96 from Friday. Thus the joint PPF is kinked because Crusoe and Friday have comparative advantages in different commodities. As the economy gets more and more ways of producing output and different comparative advantages, the PPF becomes concave.|$|E

40|$|Study, like prayer, {{is a way}} of being—it is an ethics. Alan A. Block (2004, 2) The {{academic}} {{field of}} education is so very reluctant to abandon social engineering. <b>If</b> only <b>we</b> can find the right technique, the right modifica-tion of classroom organization (small groups, collaborative learning, dialogue), <b>if</b> only <b>we</b> teach according to “best practices, ” <b>if</b> only <b>we</b> have students self-reflect or <b>if</b> only <b>we</b> develop “standards ” or conduct “scientific ” research, then students will learn what <b>we</b> teach them. <b>If</b> only <b>we</b> test regularly, “no child [will be] left behind. ” Social engineering—our predecessor Edward L. Thorndike (1922, 1) called it, simply, “human engineering”—appears to assume that edu-cation is like a complex automobile engine: <b>if</b> only <b>we</b> make the right adjustments—in teaching, in learning, in assessment—it will hum, and transport us to our destination, the promised land of high test scores, or, for many of us on the educational left, a truly democratic society (Gaztambide-Fernandez and Sears, 2004). America’s historic preoccupations with business and religion have provided cultural support for such a view of mind, a view profoundly anti-intellectual in consequence, as Richard Hofstadter (1962) has fa-mously documented. The “business-minded ” are interested in design-ing “effects ” on situations that can be profitable. In this sense, social engineering is the complement of capitalism. The “religiously-minded” mangle the present by disavowing it (“the best is yet to come”) or by employing religious rituals (such as prayer) to manipulate present cir-cumstances. Protestantism and capitalism are famously intertwined (Weber 2002 [1930]), perhaps most savagely in the American Sout...|$|R
