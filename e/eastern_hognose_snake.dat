50|$|<b>Eastern</b> <b>hognose</b> <b>snakes</b> are {{occasionally}} {{available in}} the exotic pet trade, but due to their specific dietary requirements, {{they are not as}} readily available as other species. Generally, they refuse feeder rodents unless they are scented with amphibians. In Canada, <b>Eastern</b> <b>hognose</b> <b>snakes</b> are considered to be a species-at-risk (COSEWIC designation: Threatened), and consequently capture or harassment of these animals, including their captive trade, is illegal.|$|R
50|$|<b>Eastern</b> <b>hognose</b> <b>snakes</b> mate in April and May. The females, {{which lay}} 8 - 40 eggs (average about 25) in June or early July, {{do not take}} care of the eggs or young. The eggs, which measure about 33 x 23 mm, hatch after about 60 days, from late July to September. The {{hatchlings}} are 16.5 - 21 cm long.|$|R
40|$|Habitat loss is the {{greatest}} contributor to the decline of species globally and thus understanding habitat use and the consequences fragmentation has on biodiversity is a fundamental step towards management and recovery. I conducted a radio-telemetry study to examine the spatial ecology {{and the effects of}} roads on <b>Eastern</b> <b>Hognose</b> <b>Snakes</b> (Heterodon platirhinos), a species at risk, in the Long Point Region of Ontario, Canada. I tested habitat selection at multiple spatial scales and I found that within the home range, snakes avoided agricultural land and selected open sand barrens, particularly for nesting. At the local scale, snakes avoided mature overstory trees and used younger patches of forest. Used locations had more woody debris, logs and low-vegetative coverage than locations selected at random. <b>Eastern</b> <b>Hognose</b> <b>Snakes</b> also showed avoidance of paved road crossings in their seasonal movements, but readily crossed unpaved roads. Management efforts for this species at risk should be placed on the conservation of sand barrens and on the construction of road underpasses to prevent genetic isolation of populations...|$|R
50|$|Many {{animals can}} be seen in the park. Some of the mammals there include deer, squirrel, raccoon, opossum, fox, skunk, rabbit, bobcat and black bear. Dozens of species of birds can be viewed.

50|$|The {{wilderness}} area includes a round-trip hike of approximately 4.5 mi of trails, through habitats such as mixed hardwood swamp, sand pine scrub and pine flatwoods.

50|$|Although {{some local}} declines have been reported, {{the species is}} widespread, has a large overall {{population}} size (>100,000), and is effectively protected {{by a variety of}} conservation programs. It is therefore currently classified as Least Concern by the IUCN. The <b>eastern</b> <b>hognose</b> <b>snake</b> (Heterodon platirhinos) is classified as a threatened species in some regions of its range and is therefore protected under those state's laws.|$|E

50|$|The Western Hog-nosed Snake (Heterodon nasicus) is a {{harmless}} colubrid species found in North America and northern Mexico. The Western <b>Hognose</b> <b>Snake</b> {{is a light}} sandy brown in color, with darker brown or gray blotching, their coloration {{is not nearly as}} variable as the <b>Eastern</b> <b>Hognose,</b> Heterodon platirhinos, but they often have an ink-black and white or yellow checker patterned belly, sometimes accented with orange. They are very stout for their size (a full grown 24-inch female is as bulky as a five-foot corn snake) and can grow from 15 to 33 inches in length, with females generally being larger than males. The characteristic of all <b>hognose</b> <b>snakes</b> is their upturned snout, which aids in digging in the soil. <b>Hognose</b> <b>Snakes</b> are considered to be rear-fanged venomous, but are not considered to pose any danger to humans and will only bite as a feeding response, rarely in defense.|$|R

50|$|The <b>Eastern</b> <b>hognose</b> <b>snake</b> feeds {{extensively}} on amphibians, {{and has a}} particular fondness for toads. This snake has resistance to the toxins toads secrete. This immunity is thought to come from enlarged adrenal glands which secrete large amounts of hormones to counteract the toads' powerful skin poisons. At the rear of each upper jaw, they have greatly enlarged teeth, which are neither hollow nor grooved, with which they puncture and deflate toads {{to be able to}} swallow them whole. They will also consume other amphibians, like frogs and salamanders.|$|E
50|$|This {{species is}} {{classified}} as Least Concern (LC) on the IUCN Red List of Threatened Species (Year assessed: 2007). However, it is a species of increasing conservation concern, especially in the northeastern part of its range. Of the five states in the northeast U.S. where the <b>eastern</b> <b>hognose</b> <b>snake</b> occurs, it currently has “listed” conservation status in four (Connecticut, New Hampshire, New York, and Rhode Island). Noted declines {{are believed to be}} the result of direct anthropogenic pressures including habitat loss and fragmentation, road mortality, environmental degradation, and intentional killing.|$|E
50|$|Long-tailed ducks, white-winged scoter, {{common loon}} and horned grebe spend winter off the refuge shore, while shorebirds, songbirds and raptors are present during spring and fall.

Ipswich sparrow, rough-legged hawk, and short-eared owl spend winter at the refuge. In late spring and summer the beach hosts piping plover, and common and least terns (protected by the Endangered Species Act) as well as sandpiper and other shorebirds.
