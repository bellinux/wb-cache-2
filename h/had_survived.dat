5|$|Otto Frank survived his {{internment}} in Auschwitz. After the war ended, {{he returned}} to Amsterdam, where he was sheltered by Jan and Miep Gies as he attempted to locate his family. He learned {{of the death of}} his wife, Edith, in Auschwitz, but remained hopeful that his daughters <b>had</b> <b>survived.</b> After several weeks, he discovered Margot and Anne had also died. He attempted to determine the fates of his daughters' friends and learned many had been murdered. Sanne Ledermann, often mentioned in Anne's diary, had been gassed along with her parents; her sister, Barbara, a close friend of Margot's, <b>had</b> <b>survived.</b> Several of the Frank sisters' school friends <b>had</b> <b>survived,</b> as had the extended families of Otto and Edith Frank, as they had fled Germany during the mid-1930s, with individual family members settling in Switzerland, the United Kingdom, and the United States.|$|E
5|$|Cardiac {{surgery was}} {{developed}} at the university's Variety Club Hospital, where by 1957, more than 200 patients <b>had</b> <b>survived</b> open-heart operations, many of them children. Working with surgeon C. Walton Lillehei, Medtronic began to build portable and implantable cardiac pacemakers about this time.|$|E
5|$|During {{and after}} the Black Death the area's {{population}} collapsed. Those miners who <b>had</b> <b>survived</b> the pandemic left mining to work in farming, in which wages had doubled owing to the severe labour shortage, and the mines of Bere Alston were abandoned.|$|E

5|$|With {{his book}} Hind Swaraj (1909) Gandhi, aged 40, {{declared}} that British rule {{was established in}} India with the co-operation of Indians and <b>had</b> <b>survived</b> only because of this co-operation.

5|$|A {{revival of}} {{interest}} in 'old-style' serif typefaces {{took place in the}} late nineteenth and early twentieth century. This saw a revival of the Imprimerie royale typefaces (the office was now called the Imprimerie nationale following the end of the French monarchy), which, unlike Garamond's own work, <b>had</b> <b>survived</b> in Paris. The attribution came to be considered certain by the Imprimerie's director Arthur Christian.|$|E
5|$|Although communists {{had killed}} the entire {{imperial}} Romanov family in July 1918, including 17-year-old Grand Duchess Anastasia, for years afterwards communist disinformation fed rumors {{that members of the}} Tsar's family <b>had</b> <b>survived.</b> The conflicting rumors about the fate of the family allowed impostors to make spurious claims that they were a surviving Romanov.|$|E
5|$|During {{the run-up}} to the elections, a CH-53E {{helicopter}} crashed near Al-Rutbah on 26 January, killing all 31 Marines and sailors, most of whom were members of 1st Battalion 3rd Marines and who <b>had</b> <b>survived</b> the Second Battle of Fallujah.

25|$|Several shakhas ("branches", i. e. recensions) of Rig Veda {{are known}} to have existed in the past. Of these, Śākalya is the only one to <b>have</b> <b>survived</b> in its entirety. Another shakha that may <b>have</b> <b>survived</b> is the Bāṣkala, {{although}} this is uncertain.|$|R
50|$|A {{great variety}} of {{ornamental}} motifs are found on pysanky.

5|$|Gabrielle Giffords was {{reported}} to be the target of the shootings. Some news organizations initially reported that she had been killed, but these statements were quickly revised to reflect that she <b>had</b> <b>survived</b> with a gunshot wound to the head.

5|$|Somewhat {{apocryphal}} stories tell of Augustus {{pleading with}} Tiberius to stay, even {{going so far}} as to stage a serious illness.

5|$|The {{bodies of}} the two Neville {{brothers}} were brought back to London. They did not suffer the customary fate accorded to traitors—quartering and display at the city gates.

5|$|The {{first task}} of the new air force, the {{backbone}} of which was provided by 500 former VVKJ officers and 1,600 NCOs, was the acquisition or salvage of aircraft, weapons, machinery, equipment and fuel that <b>had</b> <b>survived</b> the fighting and had not been confiscated by the German or Italian forces.|$|E
5|$|A {{light rail}} system for Greater Manchester emerged from {{the failure of the}} 1970s Picc-Vic tunnel scheme to obtain central {{government}} funding. A light-rail scheme was proposed in 1982 as the least expensive rail-based transport solution for Manchester city centre and the surrounding Greater Manchester metropolitan area. Government approval was granted in 1988 and the network began operating services between Bury Interchange and Victoria on 6 April 1992, becoming the United Kingdom's first modern street-running rail system; the 1885-built Blackpool tramway being the only first-generation tram system in the UK that <b>had</b> <b>survived</b> up to Metrolink's creation.|$|E

5|$|After a brief {{exchange}} of fire, their crews ran both French ships onshore {{close to the}} mouth of the River Dives, where several of the landing barges that <b>had</b> <b>survived</b> the attack on the British-held Îles Saint-Marcouf were sheltering. Confiante was badly damaged and boarding parties from Hydra and the other ships were able to board and burn her the following morning. Vésuve had suffered less than the Confiante and troops onshore were able to protect her from further attack until her crew could bring her into the nearby harbour of Sallenelles. There she was repaired and eventually she returned to Le Havre.|$|E
5|$|Alex North's unused {{music had}} its first public {{appearance}} in Telarc's {{issue of the}} main theme on Hollywood's Greatest Hits, Vol. 2, a compilation album by Erich Kunzel and the Cincinnati Pops Orchestra.

Eventually, a mono mix-down of North's original recordings, which <b>had</b> <b>survived</b> in the interim, would be released as a limited-edition CD by Intrada Records.|$|E
5|$|Although Morgan {{was briefly}} {{seen as a}} hero, {{widespread}} fears concerning plutocracy and concentrated wealth soon eroded this view. Morgan's bank <b>had</b> <b>survived,</b> but the trust companies that were a growing rival to traditional banks were badly damaged. Some analysts believed that the panic had been engineered to damage confidence in trust companies so that banks would benefit. Others believed Morgan {{took advantage of the}} panic to allow his U.S. Steel company to acquire TC Although Morgan lost $21 million in the panic, and the significance of the role he played in staving off worse disaster is undisputed, he also became the focus of intense scrutiny and criticism.|$|E
