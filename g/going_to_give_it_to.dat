2500|$|One {{historian}} has written, however, {{that when}} Murrow met Roosevelt with William J. Donovan of the OSS that night, while {{the magnitude of}} the destruction at Pearl Harbor horrified the president, Roosevelt seemed slightly less surprised by the attack than the other men. According to Murrow, the president told him [...] "Maybe you think [...] didn't surprise us!" [...] He said later, [...] "I believed him", and thought that he might have been asked to stay as a witness. When allegations of Roosevelt's foreknowledge appeared after the war, John Gunther asked Murrow about the meeting. He reportedly responded that the full story would pay for his son's college education and [...] "if you think I'm <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>give</b> <b>it</b> <b>to</b> you, you're out of your mind". Murrow did not write the story, however, before his death.|$|E
2500|$|Nothing {{will make}} me give up Yasmin's chance to live here in America among our {{precious}} freedoms and habits. While I respect the Muslim faith, and all other faiths, it is my earnest wish that my daughter be raised as a normal, healthy American girl in the Christian faith. There isn't any {{amount of money in}} the entire world for which it is worth sacrificing this child's privilege of living as a normal Christian girl here in the United States. There just isn't anything else in the world that can compare with her sacred chance to do that. And I'm <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>give</b> <b>it</b> <b>to</b> Yasmin regardless of what it costs.In January 1953 Hayworth was granted a divorce from Aly Khan on the grounds of extreme mental cruelty. Hayworth's daughter Yasmin played about the court while the case was being heard, finally climbing on to the Judge's lap.|$|E

6000|$|... "Oh," [...] said Carrie with {{a little}} laugh, [...] "there {{will not be the}} least {{difficulty}} about the money. I am <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>give</b> <b>it</b> <b>to</b> you--two thousand pounds if you want it." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "You're {{the best}} fellows in the world--the very best," [...] he murmured, presently. [...] "A {{thousand}} dollars! And you were <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>give</b> <b>it</b> <b>to</b> me--not loan it to me! I'll never forget that, never, if I {{live to be}} a hundred. But I {{am not going to}} take all that money--it's too much of a temptation. Let me have a hundred as a loan, and that's all." ...|$|E
5000|$|I {{decided to}} join Troy because music {{was the thing that}} helped me {{overcome}} that difficult period of time. This is my last challenge. Iâ€™m <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>give</b> <b>it</b> my all.|$|R

6000|$|... 'And {{as it were}} a Spirit 'as come to me {{and said}} that I too must give all. In short, I 'ave {{determined}} to sell out my stocks and my shares; my breweries are seven points 'igher than when I bought them; I knew it was a good investment.

6000|$|... "Such a boy {{deserves to}} have a good {{education}} and I am <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>give</b> <b>it</b> <b>to</b> him," [...] said the rich manufacturer, and so Dave was sent to boarding school, as related in the first volume of this series, entitled [...] "Dave Porter at Oak Hall." [...] There he made a host of friends, including Roger Morr, the son of a United States senator; Phil Lawrence, the son of a rich shipowner; Shadow Hamilton, who loved to tell stories; Buster Beggs, who was fat and jolly; Luke Watson, who was a musician of considerable skill, and many others.|$|E

6000|$|... "This is Patsy's secret, and I'm not <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>give</b> <b>it</b> away," [...] said Mr. Merrick. [...] "Attend to {{this matter}} promptly, Major, and you'll see the result {{when you come}} to us in July for your vacation." ...|$|R

If you think that because your father's a K.C.B., and you want to marry my sister, you can make yourself as nasty as you please and say what you like, youre mistaken. Let me tell you that except Hypatia, not one person in this house is in favor of her marrying you; and I dont believe shes happy about it herself. The match isnt settled yet: dont forget that. Youre on trial in the office because the Governor isnt giving his daughter money for an idle man to live on her. Youre on trial here because my mother thinks a girl should know what a man is like in the house before she marries him. Thats been going on for two months now; and whats the result? Youve got yourself thoroughly disliked in the office; and youre getting yourself thoroughly disliked here, all through your bad manners and your conceit, and the damned impudence you think clever.|$|E
6000|$|He {{took from}} a fold of his scarlet sash a small parcel neatly folded in white paper as fresh and spotless as himself. Holding {{it in his}} fingers, he went on: [...] "I {{happened}} to be at Heavy Tree Hill early this morning before sun-up. In the darkness I struck your cabin, and I reckon--I struck somebody else! At first I thought {{it was one of}} you chaps down on your knees praying {{at the rear of the}} cabin, but the way the fellow lit out when he smelt me coming made me think it wasn't entirely fasting and prayer. However, I went to the rear of the cabin, and then I reckoned some kind friend had been bringing you kindlings and firewood for your early breakfast. But that didn't satisfy me, so I knelt down as he had knelt, and then I saw--well, Mr. Demorest, I reckon I saw JUST WHAT YOU HAVE SEEN! But even then I wasn't quite satisfied, for that man had been grubbing round as if searching for something. So I searched too--and I found IT. I've got it here. I'm <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>give</b> <b>it</b> <b>to</b> you, for it may some day come in handy, and you won't find anything like it among the folks where you're going. It's something unique, as those fine-art-collecting sharps in 'Frisco say--something quite matchless, unless you try to match it one day yourself! Don't open the paper until I run on and say 'So long' to your partners. Good-by." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "Cousins or not, Alice," [...] Frank said, laughing, [...] "I have kissed {{you from}} the time you were a child, and if you suppose I am <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>give</b> <b>it</b> up now, when there is a real {{pleasure}} in kissing you, you are mistaken, I can tell you." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I'm <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>give</b> <b>it</b> {{up for a}} while, at least," [...] Dick had answered. During {{those days}} the search had been kept up for Josiah Crabtree, but so far nothing had been heard of the {{fugitive}} from justice. That the man had left the neighborhood was quite probable.|$|R
5000|$|Talking {{about the}} song's message, the band {{said that it}} is [...] "basically that we are the girls with the secret potion and we're <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>give</b> <b>it</b> <b>to</b> all the other girls that want to get the man they want to get" [...] with Pinnock adding that [...] "it potion is a metaphor for having {{confidence}} to get your man".|$|E

He is seen leaving his house, berating his spouse as a shrew and a harpy, {{promising}} that she shall have good cause for her jealousy.

50|$|Hegel got a {{call from}} a former {{associate}} at RCA, Dave Carpin, who was now at Arista, saying he thought Just as I Am was perfect for Air Supply to follow their smash hit, Making Love Out of Nothing at All and was <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>give</b> <b>it</b> <b>to</b> Clive Davis for evaluation. In 1985 Arista released Air Supply's version of the song and it became a top twenty hit.|$|E

5000|$|Unlike many {{characters}} on the show, Vanessa Ives is completely original {{to the series}} and has never appeared before. She was created by writer John Logan specifically for the show. [...] "This is a show about Vanessa Ives and her struggle with faith- how one woman grapples with God and the devil." [...] Logan's decision to kill Vanessa was highly controversial.
