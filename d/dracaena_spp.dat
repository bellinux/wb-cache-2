40|$|The global {{dispersal}} of Aedes albopictus (Skuse, 1894) is {{allowed by the}} transport of its eggs or larvae through the trade of goods such as used tyres or lucky bamboo (<b>Dracaena</b> <b>spp.).</b> Ae. albopictus is a peridomestic and anthropophilic species, that {{was responsible for the}} first European outbreak of chikungunya in the Emilia Romagna Region, Italy, in 2007, and it has been shown experimentally to be a competent vector of at least 26 arboviruses, including West Nile virus (WNV) and Zika virus (ZIKV). peer-reviewe...|$|E
40|$|Several resins generically {{known as}} ‘dragon’s blood’ from {{different}} botanical and geographical sources were characterised non-destructively using Fourier transform Raman spectroscopy. Genuine ‘dragon’s blood’ resin (<b>Dracaena</b> <b>spp.)</b> as found on Socotra Island was the probable source in antiquity. The spectra of recently collected Socotran resins from different sites {{were compared with}} fresh ‘dragon’s blood’ resins from Aden and Australia and a commercial source of Daemonorops draco from south-east Asia. All resin samples were freshly collected. A means of identification of the resins from their Raman spectra is proposed...|$|E
50|$|Small {{patches of}} pine forest occur around the Sierra Cristal, Nipe-Sagua-Baracoa Mountains, and Sierra Maestra. These forests are found at higher {{elevations}} than western pine forests, up to 800 - 1800 m, making them cooler and wetter. Consequently, {{some of the}} vegetation resembles that of the rainforests, {{with an abundance of}} ferns. Pino de la Maestra (Pinus maestrensis) predominates in the Sierra Maestra, developing on landslide areas over granitic rock, while the Pino de Mayarí (Pinus cubensis) predominates in the Nipe-Sagua-Baracoa. Some accompanying species in these forests are the griñapo (<b>Dracaena</b> cubensis), Eupatorium <b>spp.,</b> Myrtus spp., Baccharis spp., Jacaranda arborea and Eugenia pinetorum.|$|R
