40|$|Underlying {{the verses}} {{describing}} a prophetic interpretation of an Egyptian King’s dream about “seven lean cows devouring seven fat ones and seven dry ears of corn withering around seven green ones” are some principles that {{remain to be}} further uncovered in farming research. The relevance of the principles probably lies in the science and economics of <b>farming</b> <b>management.</b> Firstly, seven-year-cultivation period is a basis for many crop production systems, {{especially in terms of}} efficiency and major production decisions. Secondly, seven-year-cultivation period is also a basis for analyzing the cyclical nature of many agricultural crops. This paper discusses some examples of agricultural crop systems that demonstrate such characteristics. It is found that the agronomic and economic aspects of crop production are logically tied to the concept of seven-year time horizon and, therefore, it makes sense to strategize <b>farming</b> <b>management</b> on a seven-year cycle basis. Key words: Seven-year-cultivation rule of thumb (7 -Y-C RoT), <b>farming</b> <b>management.</b> The prophetic rule of thumb about seven-year-cultivation period (7 -Y-C RoT) in farming based on Prophet Yusof’s interpretation of an Egyptian King’s dream has set some important scientific an...|$|R

25|$|Animal {{husbandry}} and Integrated Crop Management (ICM) {{often are}} just two branches of one agricultural enterprise. In modern agriculture, animal husbandry and crop production must be understood as interlinked sectors which cannot be looked at in isolation, as the context of agricultural systems leads to tight interdependencies. Uncoupling animal husbandry from arable production (too high stocking rates) is therefore not considered {{in accordance with the}} principles and objectives of Integrated Farming (Lütke Entrup et al., 1998 1).

25|$|Although {{only about}} one-quarter of Taiwan's land area is {{suitable}} for farming, virtually all farmland is intensely cultivated, with some areas suitable for two and even three crops a year. However, increases in agricultural production have been much slower than industrial growth. Agricultural modernization has been inhibited by {{the small size of}} farms and the lack of investment in better facilities and training to develop more profitable businesses. Taiwan's agricultural population has steadily decreased from 1974 to 2002, prompting the Council of Agriculture to introduce modern <b>farm</b> <b>management,</b> provide technical training, and offer counseling for better production and distribution systems. Promotion of farm mechanization has helped to alleviate labor shortages while increasing productivity; both rice and sugar cane production are completely mechanized. Taiwan's main crops are rice, sugar cane, fruits (many of them tropical), and vegetables. Although self-sufficient in rice production, Taiwan imports large amounts of wheat, mostly from the United States. Meat production and consumption has risen sharply, reflecting a high standard of living. Taiwan has exported large amounts of frozen pork, although this was affected by an outbreak of hoof and mouth disease in 1997. Other agricultural exports include fish, aquaculture and sea products, canned and frozen vegetables, and grain products. Imports of agriculture products are expected to increase due to the WTO accession, which is opening previously protected agricultural markets.|$|E

Strawberry (Fragaria×ananassaDuch.) is a rich source of antioxidants and an important fruit in the human diet. Materials and methods.

The surface lightness, firmness, lipophilic antioxidant activity, soluble solids, ascorbic acid and ellagic acid contents were significantly higher at harvest than after thawing. Frozen storage increased only hydrophilic antioxidantactivity, leaving reducing sugars and total phenols without significant alterations.
