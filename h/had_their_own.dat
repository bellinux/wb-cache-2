5|$|During Wilfrid's {{lifetime}} Britain and Ireland {{consisted of}} a number of small kingdoms. Traditionally the English people were thought to have been divided into seven kingdoms, but modern historiography has shown that this is a simplification of a much more confused situation. A late 7th-century source, the Tribal Hidage, lists the peoples south of the Humber river; among the largest groups of peoples are the West Saxons (later Wessex), the East Angles and Mercians (later the Kingdom of Mercia), and the Kingdom of Kent. Smaller groups who at that time <b>had</b> <b>their</b> <b>own</b> royalty but were later absorbed into larger kingdoms include the peoples of Magonsæte, Lindsey, Hwicce, the East Saxons, the South Saxons, the Isle of Wight, and the Middle Angles. Other even smaller groups <b>had</b> <b>their</b> <b>own</b> rulers, but their size means that they do not often appear in the histories. There were also native Britons in the west, in modern-day Wales and Cornwall, who formed kingdoms including those of Dumnonia, Dyfed, and Gwynedd.|$|E
5|$|Mason's marks {{were used}} by the stonemason to {{identify}} his work, and {{in the days of}} the medieval craft guilds may also have had mystical or religious significance.

Similarly, merchants <b>had</b> <b>their</b> <b>own</b> marks to identify their products, and these frequently appeared on houses, gravestones and church walls.|$|E
5|$|On St. Laurence's Day in 1500, Portuguese {{explorer}} Diogo Dias {{landed on}} the island and named it São Lourenço. Polo's name was preferred and popularized on Renaissance maps. No single Malagasy-language name predating Madagasikara appears to have been used by the local population to refer to the island, although some communities <b>had</b> <b>their</b> <b>own</b> name for part or all of the land they inhabited.|$|E

Certain large corporations <b>have</b> <b>their</b> <b>own</b> rules; for example, Union Pacific Railroad <b>has</b> <b>their</b> <b>own</b> BAC limit of 0.02% that, if violated during a random test or a for-cause test—for example, after a traffic accident—can result in {{termination of employment}} with no chance of future rehire.|$|R

Shrewsbury also had a large cheese market in Victorian times.|$|E

The MATs (Multiple Access Transponder) components, MAT-1 and MAT-2, utilize Hughes Aircraft CDP1802CD microprocessors. The Wide Field and Planetary Camera (WFPC) also utilized an RCA 1802 microprocessor (or possibly the older 1801 version). The WFPC-1 {{was replaced by the}} WFPC-2 during Servicing Mission 1 in 1993, which was then replaced by the Wide Field Camera 3 (WFC3) during Servicing Mission 4 in 2009.|$|E
5|$|All {{families}} <b>had</b> <b>their</b> <b>own</b> {{gardens in}} which they grew vegetables that lasted through the winter. Some raised cows, pigs and chickens; others had horses for carrying firewood. There was little refrigeration, and perishables were difficult to keep. Before the mercantile came to Elcor, residents went to the J. P. Ahlin store in McKinley, or to the Saari, Campbell and Kraker Mercantile in Gilbert. Deliveries were made daily, with orders taken for the following day. People bought on credit and paid monthly, on paydays.|$|E
5|$|All of the Irish kingdoms <b>had</b> <b>their</b> <b>own</b> kings {{but were}} {{nominally}} {{subject to the}} High King. The High King was drawn {{from the ranks of}} the provincial kings and ruled also the royal kingdom of Meath, with a ceremonial capital at the Hill of Tara. The concept didn't become a political reality until the Viking Age and even then was not a consistent one. Ireland did have a culturally unifying rule of law: the early written judicial system, the Brehon Laws, administered by a professional class of jurists known as the brehons.|$|E

5|$|Although {{the central}} and local governments kept an {{enormous}} number of records about land property in order to assess taxes, it became common practice in the Tang for literate and affluent people to create their own private documents and signed contracts. These <b>had</b> <b>their</b> <b>own</b> signature and that of a witness and scribe in order to prove in court (if necessary) that their claim to property was legitimate. The prototype of this actually existed since the ancient Han dynasty, while contractual language became even more common and embedded into Chinese literary culture in later dynasties.|$|E
5|$|Although {{the regular}} Confederate {{military}} had a paper strength of 6,000 personnel, the first 100,000 volunteers {{from all over}} the South participated in a variety of dress. Many were from state militia outfits, which <b>had</b> <b>their</b> <b>own</b> state-issued uniforms. In the early battles, some Confederate units that wore dark blue uniforms were often mistaken on the field of battle for the enemy. Conversely, many Union units that were originally militia units went to war wearing gray.|$|E

5|$|Artists and {{craftsman}} operated as corporations (guilds) {{rather than}} as individual business. Inscriptions mention guilds of weavers, oilmen, artisans, basket and mat makers and fruit sellers. A Saundatti inscription refers to an assemblage {{of all the people}} of a district headed by the guilds of the region. Some guilds were considered superior to others, just as some corporations were, and received royal charters determining their powers and privileges. Inscriptions suggest these guilds <b>had</b> <b>their</b> <b>own</b> militia to protect goods in transit and, like village assemblies, they operated banks that lent money to traders and businesses.|$|E
5|$|At {{its peak}} in May 1945, 82,000 people were {{employed}} at the Clinton Engineer Works, and 75,000 people lived in the township. By January 1946, these figures had fallen to 43,000 and 48,000 respectively. By the time the Manhattan Project concluded {{at the end of}} 1946, the corresponding figures were 34,000 and 43,000. The departure of large numbers of construction workers meant that 47 percent of those remaining were family members of workers. Eight dormitories were closed in October 1945. Most of those who remained in dorms now <b>had</b> <b>their</b> <b>own</b> rooms. The white hutments began to be removed. Trailers were returned to the Federal Public Housing Authority.|$|E
5|$|At the {{outbreak}} of the French Revolution in 1789, most countries and even some cities <b>had</b> <b>their</b> <b>own</b> system of measurement. Although different countries might have used units of measure with the same name, such as the foot, or local language equivalents such as pied, Fuß, and voet, there was no consistency in the magnitude of those units, nor in the relationships with their multiples and submultiples, much like the modern-day differences between the US and the UK pints and gallons.|$|E
