5000|$|Option pricing {{models are}} built on {{rational}} pricing logic. Here, essentially: (a) it is presupposed that one can create a [...] "hedged portfolio" [...] comprising one option and [...] "delta" [...] shares of the underlying. (b) Arbitrage arguments then allow for the option's price to be estimated today; see Rational pricing #Delta hedging. (c) When hedging of this sort is possible, since delta hedging and risk neutral pricing are mathematically identical, then risk neutral valuation may be applied, {{as is the case}} with most option pricing models. (d) Under ROV however, the option and (usually) its underlying are clearly not traded, and forming a <b>hedging</b> <b>portfolio</b> would be difficult, if not impossible.|$|E

40|$|One {{theoretical}} {{implication of}} cointegration, according to Granger (1986), is that asset prices in an efficient market cannot be cointegrated. Using price data on US Treasury STRIPS with maturities from 2 / 15 / 1997 to 8 / 15 / 2015, {{it is found}} that a set of three STRIPS series is often cointegrated. In addition, by setting up a costless <b>hedge</b> <b>portfolio</b> from three STRIPS with three different maturities, {{it is found that}} the <b>hedge</b> <b>portfolio</b> is often stationary and thus arbitrage opportunities are likely to occur. That is, because the <b>hedge</b> <b>portfolio</b> is costless and stationary, cash in can be done when the value of the <b>hedge</b> <b>portfolio</b> is either positive or negative. However, when taking liquidity, tax effects, and transaction costs into consideration, these arbitrage profits would be unlikely. Hence, it is concluded that the US Treasury STRIPS market is efficient. ...|$|R
40|$|The Black-Scholes model (1973) is {{developed}} under {{the concept of}} the riskless <b>hedged</b> <b>portfolio</b> by <b>hedging</b> the call option against the underlying stock.

However, none of the conditions of perfect capital markets is true in real capital markets. Therefore, whether the growth rate of the <b>hedged</b> <b>portfolio</b> is the riskless interest rate is an interesting and challenging topic.

40|$|Multi-period {{guarantees}} {{are often}} embedded in life insurance contracts. In this paper {{we consider the}} problem of hedging these multi-period guarantees {{in the presence of}} transaction costs. We derive the hedging strategies for the cheapest <b>hedge</b> <b>portfolio</b> for a multi-period guarantee that with certainty makes the insurance company able to meet the obligations from the insurance policies it has issued. We find that by imposing transaction costs, the insurance company reduces the rebalancing of the <b>hedge</b> <b>portfolio.</b> The cost of establishing the <b>hedge</b> <b>portfolio</b> also increases as the transaction cost increases. For the multi-period guarantee there is a rather large rebalancing of the <b>hedge</b> <b>portfolio</b> as we go from one period to the next.

Transaction costs may therefore be one possible explanation for why we do not see the insurance companies performing a large rebalancing of their investment portfolio {{at the end of each}} year. ...|$|R

40|$|The problem studied {{is that of}} <b>hedging</b> a <b>portfolio</b> {{of options}} in {{discrete}} time where underlying security prices are driven {{by a combination of}} idiosyncratic and systematic risk factors.

The nature of the <b>hedge</b> <b>portfolio</b> in the limit of large portfolio size is substantially different from its continuous time counterpart. Instead of linearly hedging the total risk of each option separately, the correct <b>portfolio</b> <b>hedge</b> in discrete time eliminates linear as well as second and higher order exposures to the systematic risk factors only.

Relationships to utility indifference pricing and pricing by valuation and stress measures will be discussed. Examples using the shortfall risk measure and average VaR will be shown...|$|E
30|$|To qualify the {{behavior}} of the model, we assume banks do not have complete information about the activities, or even intent of their borrowers. Furthermore, a <b>hedging</b> <b>portfolio</b> is sought to offset any downside risks from either lending or idling.

The credit banks extend manifest in loan agreements with individuals or firms (Villar 2006). In this study, we assume banks will continually lend to gain access to future payments from the projects these loans fund. While banks accept loan applications, and underwrite loans, they do not have complete information as to the actual value of the portfolio in the subsequent period. As such, banks only have an expectation of the future loan portfolio value at the time they lend. Loans may continue to perform as expected, fall into delinquency, or enter a state of impairment.
