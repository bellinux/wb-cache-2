5000|$|He {{grew up in}} Metuchen, New Jersey, {{and began}} acting {{in high school in}} the mid-1960s under the {{guidance}} of Metuchen High School theater teacher, Barton Shepard. Upon graduation from Glassboro State College (now Rowan University) where he completed his student teaching requirement at Haddon Township High School, with a Bachelor of Arts in Speech/Theater and Secondary Education, Hegyes ventured to New York City to pursue a career in acting and soon became a member of a Greenwich Village children's theater group called, [...] "Theater in a Trunk," [...] performing educational theater at U.S. President Theodore Roosevelt's birthplace, on East 20th Street. Hegyes continued performing in the Village in educational children's theater, this time as a puppeteer with an arm <b>and</b> <b>rod</b> <b>puppet</b> company, playing Mr. Toad in The Wind in the Willows. Robert managed to work a third performing job in Washington Square Park and at the Provincetown Playhouse {{as a member of the}} political improvisational guerrilla troupe, [...] "Jack LaRumpa's Flying Drum & Kazoo Band." ...|$|R
50|$|Russian puppet theater {{appears to}} have {{originated}} either in migrations from the Byzantine Empire in the sixth century or possibly by Mongols travelling from China. Itinerant Slavic minstrels were presenting puppet shows in western Russia by the thirteenth century, arriving in Moscow in the mid-sixteenth century. Although Russian traditions were increasingly influenced by puppeteers from western Europe in the eighteenth century, Petrushka continued {{to be one of}} the principal figures. In addition to glove <b>puppets</b> <b>and</b> marionettes, <b>rod</b> <b>puppets</b> <b>and</b> flat puppets were introduced for a time but disappeared in the late nineteenth century.|$|R

50|$|A <b>rod</b> <b>puppet</b> is {{made out}} of wood wire and string and is {{manipulated}} with wooden or wire <b>rods.</b> <b>Rod</b> <b>puppets</b> can sometimes have a complete working hinged mouth but many do not. A <b>rod</b> <b>puppet</b> can have a fixed facial expression. Arms are usually a requirement as rods are attached to them. A fish <b>rod</b> <b>puppet</b> could have a rod attached to the tail to manipulate this section of the puppet. Sometimes special variants exist with additional manipulable parts: (e.g., eyelids that open <b>and</b> close). Many <b>rod</b> <b>puppets</b> depict only the upper half of the character, from the waist up, with the stage covering the missing remainder, but variations sometimes have legs. The legs usually just dangle, but in special cases the legs may be controlled either from behind the stage using rods from below.These are mostly used at carnivals or fairs. A very common example of <b>rod</b> <b>puppets</b> are those of The Muppets and Sesame Street.|$|R
25|$|The Alien {{is portrayed}} by both Woodruff, Jr. {{in a suit}} <b>and</b> a <b>rod</b> <b>puppet</b> filmed against bluescreen and {{optically}} composited into the live-action footage, with the rods removed by rotoscoping. A mechanical alien head was also used for close-ups. The suit adapted the design used in Aliens so Woodruff could walk on all fours. Woodruff's head was contained in {{the neck of the}} suit, because the head was filled with animatronics to move the mouth of the Alien. Fincher suggested that a Whippet be dressed in an alien costume for on-set coverage of the quadrupedal alien, but the visual effects team was dissatisfied with the comical result and the idea was dropped in favor of the puppet.|$|R

500|$|The {{subspecies}} creatures, {{which were}} created from Radu's blood, originally began as local Romanian men in rubber suits. The men were filmed on over-scaled sets {{to simulate the}} miniature size of the creatures. The performances of the Romanian men, along with {{the design of the}} rubber suits, caused director Ted Nicolaou to rethink his approach. Nicolaou brought in animator David W. Allen to assist him in creating [...] "more magical" [...] looking subspecies creatures. Allen went through all of the film footage that contained the Romanian extras in their rubber suits with the film's editor in order to find usable footage before and after the men enter the scene. Allen would use the isolated footage to develop a new background for the animated creatures he would later create. Allen created two puppet types, displayed in front of a bluescreen: a stop-motion <b>puppet</b> <b>and</b> a <b>rod</b> <b>puppet.</b> Each of the puppet types were composed of foam rubber, and held similar skeletal systems. Some differences between the two types include tension filled joints for the stop-motion <b>puppet,</b> while the <b>rod</b> <b>puppet</b> was looser. The flexibility of the rod-puppet allowed for faster movements, which were needed occasionally for real-time filming.|$|R

5000|$|The first Prehysteria was co-directed by Charles and Albert Band {{and it was}} {{released}} in 1993. The film was such a huge success, and it gained over $100,000,000 in rental sales. Due to its outcome, a sequel was quickly developed, and released in 1994. No character from the first film returned, however Albert Band returned to direct. In 1995, Moonbeam developed a second sequel, entitled [...] "Prehysteria! 3". David DeCoteau directed the film. The only returning character was Owen Bush, from the second film. All of the films were released by Paramount Home Video. *Besides the dinosaurs, Mr. Cranston (Owen Bush) is the only returning character in the series. The Stegosaurus, Jagger, never appeared on the first three film posters. Prehysteria! was Austin OBriens first lead role. The Tyrannosaurus, Elvis, and Brachiosaurus, Paula, have appeared {{on all of the}} film posters. The dinosaurs in the first three films were realized by traditional stop motion animation <b>and</b> <b>rod</b> <b>puppets.</b> Prehysteria! 2 <b>and</b> Prehysteria! 3 were both aimed at younger audiences. Madonna the Geosternbergia hurt her wing in Prehysteria! 2, so that the producers could save money on the cost of stop motion animation. In Prehysteria! 3, Madonna does not fly. Prehysteria! was the first Moonbeam Entertainment film. Prehysteria 2 was Moonbeams first sequel. The characters of [...] "Richie", played by Stuart Fratkin and [...] "Louis", played by Tony Longo from the first Prehysteria!, were brought back to star in another Moonbeam Production, [...] "Remote", because theyve done so well as comedic thugs in Prehysteria.|$|R

50|$|Barclay {{was born}} to a Scottish mother and an English father. At age four, he {{performed}} marionettes, glove <b>and</b> <b>rod</b> <b>puppets</b> with his parents, Ann and Michael who formed Pex Puppet Theatre focusing their acting talents on live puppetry. When he was seven, Barclay performed traditional Punch and Judy at the British Puppet Guild, for documentary cameras. Throughout his childhood, he designed built and performed dozens of his own puppets and continued performing Punch and Judy into his late teens. He worked for other live puppet companies, Jactito, directors James and Joan Barton, and Cap and Bells, director Violet Philpott. His first work in front of camera was a brief appearance as a large dog in the British classic comedy series The Morecambe and Wise Christmas Show. This was in 1978 for Thames TV. In July 1979 he was offered the position of make up assistant working for Stuart Freeborn on the second Star Wars film The Empire Strikes Back. The main challenge was a state-of-the-art hand puppet named Yoda, and Barclay assisted building duplicate parts, seaming the foam latex head skins, etc., but when Wendy Midener Froud became allergic to something on the set, he was drafted in as a puppeteer. Dave performed the cable controlled facial movements for Muppet master Frank Oz, the chief puppeteer. When Oz {{had to return to}} New York City to shoot Sesame Street, as the production had run over, Oz nominated Barclay to take over as chief puppeteer for Yoda. Barclay was then invited to become the first British puppet maker on a new adventurous project by Jim Henson and Frank Oz, The Dark Crystal. In November 1979, he joined a handful of Henson's American puppet makers, to develop puppets that would finally become the entire cast of the movie. And so started the long term relationship and desire to push the envelope in animatronic performance art.|$|R
50|$|Edith Finney and Louise Ewing were {{established}} performers {{using the name}} “EdLo Puppets.” Ellen and Romaine “Proctor Puppets” were also well known performers touring throughout the country. They were particularly well-known in Saint Louis for their Christmas performances in the fashionable Scruggs Department Store. Romaine Proctor is credited with designing the puppet Saint Louis on a rearing horse for the guild logo. The Rowlsons traveled and painted wagons. They had a beautiful, “gypsy” wagon that they had designed, and with which they would travel during the summers, painting and performing. Carolyn Meyer was a school teacher and known for her fabulous cardboard shadow puppets with levering mechanisms for more movement. Art Pfaff and his first wife name and upon her death, his second wife, Gladys, were very popular performers with glove <b>and</b> <b>rod</b> <b>puppets.</b> The “Ruth Quinn Marionettes” performed variety acts and she and also created marionettes for other puppeteers across the country. Elmer Kramer and family were also popular puppeteers. Nelly Mendham and Genevieve Albers were renowned for her colorful shadow puppetry. Claude Sontag {{and his wife were}} also popular performers of that era. Mildred (Billie) Blackwell was also a popular puppeteer. The guild successfully brought the 1941 Puppeteers of America Festival to Saint Louis (and 3 others since). The first one being in June 24-27, 1941. It was held at the Melbourne Hotel (Northwest Corner of Grand and Lindell), Saint Louis, Missouri with Romain Proctor as chairman.

5000|$|Also {{called a}} [...] "two-man puppet" [...] or a [...] "live-hand puppet", the human-arm puppet {{is similar to}} a hand puppet but is larger and {{requires}} two puppeteers. One puppeteer places a hand inside the puppet's head and operates its head and mouth while putting her other arm into a glove and special sleeve attached to the puppet (the right arm if they are left <b>handed</b> <b>and</b> left arm if they are right handed). The second puppeteer puts her arm into a glove and special sleeve attached to the puppet in order to operate the other arm. This way, the puppet can perform hand gestures.
