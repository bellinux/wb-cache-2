The distinction was that they were created alternately and moved in opposite directions away from a central location on the valley floor, suggesting the existence of an inaudible free convection whistle. The reason for including this type of whistle is that we tend to think that it is necessary for a forced jet flow to encounter a solid material to create a whistle. Perhaps it would be more correct to generalize the concept to a particular impedance mismatch rather than a solid object. The Hartmann whistle and the jet screech fits into this generalization.

An analysis is presented of the <b>flow</b> <b>force</b> acting on a two-way valve using the equilibrium condition of the piston and the equilibrium condition of fluid in the control volume. Three types of <b>flow</b> <b>forces</b> are identified: pressure-difference-induced <b>flow</b> <b>force,</b> viscous-shear-induced <b>flow</b> <b>force,</b> and momentum-induced <b>flow</b> <b>force.</b> Nondimensional analysis shows that among all steady <b>flow</b> <b>force</b> the pressure-difference-induced <b>flow</b> <b>force</b> is largest with viscous-shear-induced <b>flow</b> <b>force</b> the second and momentum-induced <b>flow</b> <b>force</b> the smallest. However, the fluid inertial-induced <b>flow</b> <b>force,</b> which is a momentum-induced <b>flow</b> <b>force,</b> is very important while the pressure transient effect caused by the slight compressibility of the fluid is negligible.

To enable further experiment 100 -points average and pressure profile factor are introduced.

50|$|Sweeping-gas MD, {{also known}} as air stripping, uses a channel {{configuration}} with an empty gap on the permeate side. This configuration {{is the same as}} in AGMD. Condensation of the vapour takes place outside the MD module in an external condenser. As with AGMD, volatile substances with a low surface tension can be distilled with this process. The advantage of SWGMD over AGMD is the significant reduction of the barrier to the mass transport through <b>forced</b> <b>flow.</b> Hereby higher surface-related productwater mass flows can be achieved than with AGMD. A disadvantage of SWGMD caused by the gas component and therefore the higher total mass flow, is the necessity of a higher condenser capacity.When using smaller gas mass flows there is a risk of the gas heating itself at the hot membrane surface, thus reducing the vapour pressure difference and therefore the driving force. One solution of this problem for SWGMD and for AGMD is the use of a cooled walling for the permeate channel, and maintaining temperature by flushing it with gas.|$|E
50|$|After {{the removal}} of the dams, 10.5 million metric tons of {{sediment}} was released from two reservoirs through the Elwha river system. The sudden increase of sediment supply caused bed aggradation of ~1 meter, resulting in a change of channel morphology from pool-riffle to braided, and decreased the slope of the lowermost river. Widespread bed aggradation <b>forced</b> <b>flow</b> through floodplain channels, depositing additional sediment in the side channels of the Elwha river floodplain. Mainstream aggradation also formed numerous bars, further establishing braided morphology. The river system showed a greater geomorphic response to dam removal than it had to a 40-year flood event four years before dam removal. The dams had virtually eliminated bed-material sediment supply to the river downstream, forming large deltas upstream of each reservoir. Once released, the sediment travelled downstream to the mouth of the river where a new estuary is believed to be forming. These geomorphic alterations have important ecological implications, affecting aquatic habitat structure, benthic fauna, salmonid spawning and rearing potential, and riparian vegetation. The response of the Elwha River system to the dam removals provides a unique and important case study for future river restoration projects.|$|E

50|$|The RPV and Nuclear Steam Supply System (NSSS) have {{significant}} improvements, {{such as the}} substitution of RIPs, eliminating conventional external recirculation piping loops and pumps in the containment that in turn drive jet pumps producing <b>forced</b> <b>flow</b> in the RPV. RIPs provide significant improvements related to reliability, performance and maintenance, including a reduction in occupational radiation exposure related to containment activities during maintenance outages. These pumps are powered by wet-rotor motors with the housings connected {{to the bottom of}} the RPV and eliminating large diameter external recirculation pipes that are possible leakage paths. The 10 internal recirculation pumps are located at the bottom of the annulus downcomer region (i.e., between the core shroud and the inside surface of the RPV). Consequently, internal recirculation pumps eliminate all of the jet pumps in the RPV, all of the large external recirculation loop pumps and piping, the isolation valves and the large diameter nozzles that penetrated the RPV and needed to suction water from and return it to the RPV. This design therefore reduces the worst leak below the core region to effectively equivalent to a 2 in leak. The conventional BWR3-BWR6 product line has an analogous potential leak of 24 or more inches in diameter. A major benefit of this design is that it greatly reduces the flow capacity required of the ECCS.|$|E
