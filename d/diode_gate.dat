5000|$|During the 1960s {{the use of}} tunnel diodes in logic {{circuits}} was an active research topic. When compared to transistor logic gates of the time, the tunnel diode offered much higher speeds. Unlike other diode types, the tunnel diode offered the possibility of amplification of signals at each stage. The operating principles of a tunnel diode logic rely on biasing of the tunnel diode and supply of current from inputs over a threshold current, to switch the diode between two states. Consequently, tunnel diode {{logic circuits}} required a means to reset the diode after each logical operation. A simple tunnel <b>diode</b> <b>gate</b> offered little isolation between inputs and outputs and had low fan in and fan out. More complex gates, with additional tunnel diodes and bias power supplies, overcame some of these limitations. [...] Advances in discrete and integrated circuit transistor speed and the more nearly unilateral nature of transistor amplifiers overtook the tunnel <b>diode</b> <b>gate</b> {{and it is no}} longer used in modern computers.|$|E

5000|$|While {{diode logic}} has the {{advantage}} of simplicity, the lack of an amplifying stage in each gate limits its application. Not all logical functions can be implemented in diode logic alone; only the non-inverting logical AND and logical OR functions can be realized by <b>diode</b> <b>gates.</b> If several <b>diode</b> logic <b>gates</b> are cascaded, the voltage levels at each stage are significantly changed, so one-stage is normally used.

50|$|Forward voltage drop. The first {{restoration}} {{problem of}} diode logic {{is that there}} is a voltage drop VF about 0.6 V across the forward-biased diode.

40|$|A silicon <b>gated</b> <b>diode,</b> being {{evolved from}} MOSFET {{technology}} and utilizing {{a half of}} MOSFET, has been developed as LED) {{for the first time}} to demonstrate unique electric field modulation of light emission characteristics. In contrast to a reverse biased traditional two-terminal Si-diode possessing light emission modulation by current signal, this three-terminal Si-gated diode is capable of modulating optical emission by applied gate voltage signal, which is directly compatible with a standard CMOSFET circuit operation easing monolithic integration of logic circuit implementation and a light emission diode on silicon technology. The gate applied voltage can produce two effects on the <b>gated</b> <b>diode.</b> Firstly, it induces carrier concentration modulation at both channel and source/drain region underneath the gate, thus modulating electric field strength and distribution. Secondly, an inversion layer of surface carriers underneath the gate in the source or drain overlap region can be formed at a certain gate applied voltage. Since the inversion layer of carriers is formed at heavily doped semiconductor, a tunneling current can be observed in such a field induced junction. These two combined effects of electric field modulation and tunneling current injection in the high electric field region lead to unique light emission characteristics. Fabricated in a standard CMOS process technology, silicon p-n junction diodes (source/substrate or drain/substrate) and <b>gated</b> p-n junction <b>diodes</b> (gate/source/substrate or gate/drain/substrate) are used in this study to compare their light emission characteristics and device performance. The pn junction diode operating at avalanche breakdown conditions has visible light emission originating from the depletion region as confirmed by 2 D device simulation and experimental measurement results. It is believed that this optical radiation comes from carriers generated by impact ionization losing their kinetic energy by colliding with immobile charged centers in the avalanche region. A theoretical model is presented to show the correlation of photonic emission with the electric field strength, also known as the hot carrier effect with the related high electric field. The <b>gated</b> pn junction <b>diode</b> operating at electric field assisted tunneling current conditions has visible light emission originating from the gate/drain or gate/source overlap region as confirmed by 2 D device simulation and experimental measurement results. Both pn junction <b>diode</b> and <b>gated</b> pn junction <b>diode</b> exhibits a linear dependence of light emission intensity on the device terminal current. The only difference between them is that the pn junction diode is controlled by the avalanche current initiated by the junction leakage current while the <b>gated</b> <b>diode</b> by the tunneling current. It has been discovered that, at the same terminal current, the optical output power in <b>gated</b> <b>diode</b> is higher than that in diode, indicating higher quantum efficiency in the <b>gated</b> <b>diode.</b> To compare LED device performance, the electro-optic modulation schemes and speed in the pn <b>diode</b> and the <b>gated</b> <b>diode</b> are analyzed in detail, showing a modulation speed of a few tens of gigahertz achievable in the gated LED.
