The director and webmaster of the site, who uses the professional name Tomcat, received a university degree in film and media, and had experience with filmmaking and operating the sex-machines. He began work at Kink.com as a production assistant. He focused his direction style on filming the <b>female</b> <b>participants</b> experiencing sincere pleasure from the machines.|$|E
5|$|In a 2013 study, Yule et al. {{looked into}} mental health variances between Caucasian heterosexuals, homosexuals, bisexuals, and asexuals. The results of 203 male and 603 <b>female</b> <b>participants</b> were {{included}} in the findings. Yule et al. found that asexual male participants {{were more likely to report}} having a mood disorder than other males, particularly in comparison to the heterosexual participants. The same was found for female asexual participants over their heterosexual counterparts; however, non-asexual, non-heterosexual females had the highest rates. Asexual participants of both sexes were more likely to have anxiety disorders than heterosexual and non-heterosexual participants, as were they more likely than heterosexual participants to report having had recent suicidal feelings. Yule et al. hypothesised that some of these differences may be due to discrimination and other societal factors.|$|E

25|$|The {{earliest}} recorded {{incidence of}} women's surfing concerns the mythical Kelea. Kelea {{was born of}} royalty in Maui, it is believed she out-surfed riders of both genders. A few centuries years pass until the mid-late 1800s, when Thrum’s Hawaiian Annual reported that women in ancient Hawaii surfed in equal numbers and frequently better than men. Women's surfing in Australia has a popular following amongst <b>female</b> <b>participants.</b>|$|E

5000|$|Alan Turing, in his 1952 paper Computing Machinery and Intelligence, {{proposed}} {{a test for}} intelligence which has since {{become known as the}} Turing test. While {{there are a number of}} different versions, the original test, described by Turing as being based on the [...] "Imitation Game", involved a [...] "machine intelligence" [...] (a computer running an AI program), a <b>female</b> <b>participant,</b> and an interrogator. Both the AI and the <b>female</b> <b>participant</b> were to claim that they were female, and the interrogator's task was to work out which was the <b>female</b> <b>participant</b> and which was not by examining the participant's responses to typed questions. While it is not clear whether or not Turing intended that the interrogator was to know that one of the participants was a computer, while discussing some of the possible objections to his argument Turing raised the concern that [...] "machines cannot make mistakes".|$|R
25|$|In 2007, The Age {{reported}} that a survey by Sweeney Sports had found that 69% of the Australian public {{have an interest in}} cricket, second to none. Cricket is often known as Australia's national sport due to its equal popularity {{in all parts of the}} country. Cricket is also a mass participation sport in Australia: a census conducted on behalf of Cricket Australia found that in the 2003–04 season there were 471,329 participants in Australian cricket programmes and competitions, including 47,780 <b>female</b> <b>participants.</b>|$|E
25|$|The game {{objective}} is to outscore the opposing team. The sport is played on an ice surface, primarily by women and girls, and {{requires the use of}} ice skates. The sport uses a blue rubber pneumatic ring and all players, with the exception of goaltenders, use a straight stick. One of the sport's most recognizable and defining features {{is the fact that it}} does not involve the use of intentional body contact as a strategic component. Despite its primary popularity among <b>female</b> <b>participants,</b> the sport is officially mixed.|$|E
25|$|Tan {{posits that}} most sexual {{language}} in the Philippines is patriarchal: it focuses on the actions and expectations of the male, rather than <b>female,</b> <b>participants.</b> As an example, gamit tends {{to be used as}} Ginamit ako ng mister ko ("My husband 'used' me"), but such turn of phrase would never be used by a straight man. Tan uses other metaphors, such as the relationship between the euphemisms pagdidilig ("to water plants") and magpadilig ("to be watered"), and a woman waiting patiently for sex is described as uhaw (thirsty), to forward this theory: in his view, the Tagalog language subconsciously puts the woman in the passive role.|$|E

30|$|The {{differences}} in pitch and word rate have similar behavior across participants. For the “bold” typesetting, the pitch differences were ranging from small (e.g., − 7  %, for a <b>female</b> <b>participant)</b> to large (e.g., − 36  %, {{for a male}} participant). The percentage word rate decrease had similar behavior (e.g., a <b>female</b> <b>participant</b> in a sentence case − 23  %, and a male participant in a phrase case − 56  %). Similar results were observed for the rendition of the “italics” typesetting, e.g., + 11 and + 49 % for pitch differences and + 14 and + 48  % for word rate differences.|$|R
25|$|From June 30 to July 3, Hou {{was part}} of the team {{representing}} China in the 4th Asian Martial Arts Games held in Incheon, South Korea.

25|$|Girton {{college has}} {{a variety of}} student-run sports teams and it {{provides}} its own sports pitches for cricket, football, hockey, lacrosse, netball and volleyball. An extensive refurbishment of the pitches was completed in 2009. There are men's and women's teams for badminton, football, hockey, rowing (Girton College Boat Club) and rugby. Hockey has a mixed team as well. Cricket, cross country, lacrosse, netball, squash, swimming, table tennis, tennis, volleyball and waterpolo teams are open to both male and <b>female</b> <b>participants.</b> The college has outdoor tennis and indoor squash courts, and a gym. The indoor-heated swimming pool has been in use since 1900, but is currently out of order due to building work. A one-mile running path leads around the college grounds. College alumni are currently raising money in order to build a new sports pavilion.|$|E
25|$|Nāzlĩ Fādil {{was one of}} {{the first}} women to revive the {{tradition}} of the literary salon and contributed immeasurably to the cause of women's emancipation in the Arab world. She began to invite guests to her Cairo salon towards the end of the nineteenth century, although the absence of <b>female</b> <b>participants</b> in her salon evenings should be noted. Like Maryana Marrash, Fādil added to the ambience in her salon by playing the piano, while one of her male guests sang and her Tunisian maid danced. The men who frequented her salon were prominent in Egyptian and Arab society; including statesmen, diplomats, journalists and literary figures. Among the regular visitors to her salon was the renowned Islamic Reformist thinker, Sheikh Mohammed 'Abduh, as well as Qāsim Amin, Boutros Ghali and Saad Zaghloul, to name but a few.|$|E

25|$|Performance {{in mental}} {{rotation}} and similar spatial tasks {{is affected by}} gender expectations. For example, studies show that being told before the test that men typically perform better, or that the task is linked with jobs like aviation engineering typically associated with men versus jobs like fashion design typically associated with women, will negatively affect female performance on spatial rotation and positively influence it when subjects are told the opposite. Experiences such as playing video games also increase a person's mental rotation ability. A study from the University of Toronto showed that differences in ability get reduced after playing video games requiring complex mental rotation. The experiment showed that playing such games creates larger gains in spatial cognition in females than males. However, male participants still performed superior to <b>female</b> <b>participants</b> {{both before and after}} training.|$|E
25|$|Hensel {{and colleagues}} {{conducted}} a study with 387 <b>female</b> <b>participants</b> {{between the ages of}} 14 and 17 and found that as the girls got older (and learned more about their sexual self-concept), they experienced less anxiety, greater comfort with sexuality and experienced more instances of sexual activity. Additionally, across the four years (from 14-17), sexual self-esteem increased, and sexual anxiety lessened. The researchers stated that this may indicate that the more sexual experiences the adolescent girls have had, the more confidence they hold in their sexual behavior and sexuality. Additionally, it may mean that for girls who have not yet had intercourse, they become more confident and ready to participate in an encounter for the first time. Researchers state that these patterns indicate that adolescent sexual behavior is not at all sporadic and impulsive, rather that it is strongly affected by the adolescent girls’ sexual self-concept and changes and expands through time.|$|E
25|$|The {{tone and}} topics of {{discussion}} were usually {{at the discretion}} of the salonnières or hostesses, who administered the conversation. Of course, every salon was slightly different, but most evenings offered a mix of serious and lighthearted conversation, with musical entertainment in some cases. As the conversation flowed, it was not uncommon for guests to colour their conversations with personal anecdotes or local gossip. Indeed, it was thought to be a necessary talent of a successful hostess to encourage such digressions. As these salons were conducted during the Arab Awakening, which advocated a synthesis of tradition and modernity, the use of fushā (classical Arabic) was emphasised. Unfortunately, specific topics of conversation in the literary salons have remained somewhat of a mystery over the years. However, in Yatanaqashun (They Discuss), a fictional portrayal of a salon session held in her house in which the subject of 'equality' was discussed at length, Mayy Ziyadah gives a good indication of the content, atmosphere and interactions between male and <b>female</b> <b>participants</b> in her salon.|$|E
