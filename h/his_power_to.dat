5|$|Historian Thomas Vogel opines that Rommel {{was not a}} Nazi, if {{one uses}} the {{definition}} the Nazis themselves used, considering that although he did everything in <b>his</b> <b>power</b> <b>to</b> make his country strong again, he showed no support towards the racial policies or {{other aspects of the}} regime.|$|E
5|$|Razor Ramon faced Bob Backlund next. Ramon used <b>his</b> <b>power</b> <b>to</b> {{dominate}} {{the majority of}} the match, but Backlund used hip tosses to attempt a comeback. Ramon won the match in under four minutes by pinning Backlund with a small package.|$|E
5|$|According to the {{practice}} of cursing and sorcery peculiar to Sinhala Buddhists, Kataragama deviyo has his dark side represented by Getabaru and Kadavara. The current Getabaru shrine is located in an isolated place near Morawaka. The shrine for Kadavara is in the town of Kataragama. <b>His</b> <b>power</b> <b>to</b> curse is carried out in secret outside the Main Kataragama deviyo shrine at a place at the Menik Ganga, where he receives animal sacrifices. Katagama devio is also directly invoked in sorcery practices.|$|E

5|$|The oppressive {{taxes and}} brutal {{collection}} methods incite sporadic rebellions that are suppressed harshly. Süß {{goes so far}} as to destroy half of a blacksmith's house to prove <b>his</b> <b>power</b> <b>to</b> punish those who refuse to pay their taxes. When the blacksmith attacks Süß's coach with a sledgehammer, Süß has the blacksmith hanged on the grounds that an attack on the Duke's minister is tantamount to an attack on the Duke himself.|$|E
5|$|A further {{example of}} an {{executive}} decision invalidated by improper purpose {{can be seen from}} Congreve v. Home Office (1976). In that case, the Home Secretary, who had the power to revoke television licences, purported to revoke the licences of people who had pre-empted a rise in licence fees by buying a licence at the old rate before the date when the fees were due to go up, even though their old licences had not yet expired. The court held that this was an improper exercise of the Home Secretary's discretionary powers. <b>His</b> <b>power</b> <b>to</b> revoke could not be used to raise revenue, and therefore this power had been used for the wrong purpose.|$|E
5|$|After {{returning}} to the present and retrieving three magical stones to complete the wand, Oliver learns that his mother Allie {{was in fact the}} great sage, Alicia. Realizing she could not defeat Jabou, and that he had destroyed his soulmate in the other world to avoid the possibility of being defeated through them, she chose to travel into both the future and into Oliver's world in the hopes of finding his next soulmate; after settling into this new world, she eventually gave birth to her son, Oliver, who unknowingly became Jabou's soulmate. After he is defeated, Jabou's past is shown. He was once a soldier who helped a young girl against orders, and whose hometown was destroyed to set an example. The spirit of Alicia talks to the dying Jabou, who realises that the girl he saved was the young Alicia herself. Jabou then uses <b>his</b> <b>power</b> <b>to</b> sever the link between himself and Oliver, in order to save Oliver from dying as well.|$|E

5|$|At {{some point}} during his reign, Sigeberht abdicated <b>his</b> <b>power</b> <b>to</b> Ecgric and retired to lead a {{religious}} life within a monastery he had built for his own use. Bede does not name the location of Sigeberht's monastery, but later sources name it as Beodricesworth, afterwards called Bury St Edmunds. If that identification is accepted, the likely site was in the original precinct of the mediaeval abbey at Bury St Edmunds, probably the 'worth' or curtilage of Beodric after whom the place was originally named. The site occupied a strong position on {{the upper reaches of}} the Lark valley, which drains north-west into the Great Fen through important early settlements at Icklingham, Culford, West Stow and others. This was a line of access towards Ely, where a foundation of Saint Augustine may already have existed, and towards Soham, where Saint Felix is thought to have founded a monastery.|$|E
5|$|By {{the time}} Vashyron and his comrades learn the full tale from Juris, Rowen {{is in the}} midst of a crisis of faith due to his control over the Zenith System through his ring. During the party's {{confrontation}} with Sullivan where he threatens to destroy Leanne's quartz, Rowen shoots Sullivan to try and prove the existence of a higher power through Leanne's survival. The three then confront Rowen directly and fatally wound him, but Rowen's control of the Zenith System preserves his life. Vashyron calls Zephyr and Leanne off, seeing further fighting is pointless. During the game's credits, Rowen uses <b>his</b> <b>power</b> <b>to</b> resurrect the Cardinals, then leaves the control ring on Frieda's grave, and Sullivan is seen reuniting with Rebecca. In a post-credit scene, Leanne, Zephyr and Vashyron explore the now-clean world beyond Basel, and Leanne's quartz is revealed to have been safely embedded in her hand.|$|E
5|$|Democrats in the General Assembly were outraged. When the 1930 {{legislative}} session convened, they immediately {{passed a bill}} that stripped Sampson of <b>his</b> <b>power</b> <b>to</b> appoint a highway commissioner, giving it to a three-person commission composed of the governor, lieutenant governor, and attorney general. The Republican Sampson would be outnumbered and outvoted in this group. Confident that the Democrats would not lose another gubernatorial election, Democratic legislators stipulated in the bill that the appointment power {{would return to the}} governor in 1931, the end of Sampson's term. The law passed the House by a vote of 53—42 and the Senate by a vote of 22—15. Sampson vetoed the bill, but the veto was overridden, and Johnson was returned to his former position.|$|E

50|$|In the Blackest Night storyline, Psycho-Pirate {{has been}} {{identified}} as one of the deceased entombed below the Hall of Justice. Psycho-Pirate's corpse is revived as a Black Lantern during the event. He attacks Smallville, using <b>his</b> <b>powers</b> <b>to</b> manipulate the inhabitants, and sway Conner Kent into attacking Superman. Psycho-Pirate murders several Smallville citizens after using <b>his</b> <b>powers</b> <b>to</b> enhance their emotions: Black Lanterns enjoy attacking the emotionally overwrought.|$|R
5|$|Due to the lord's {{presence}} in a castle, it was a centre of administration from where he controlled his lands. He relied on the support of those below him, as {{without the support of}} his more powerful tenants a lord could expect <b>his</b> <b>power</b> <b>to</b> be undermined. Successful lords regularly held court with those immediately below them on the social scale, but absentees could expect to find their influence weakened. Larger lordships could be vast, and it would be impractical for a lord to visit all his properties regularly so deputies were appointed. This especially applied to royalty, who sometimes owned land in different countries.|$|E
5|$|Following the {{overthrow}} of al-Shishakli, Syria held its first democratic elections in five years. The Ba'ath Party, led by Aflaq, al-Bitar and al-Hawrani, had 22 members elected to parliament. This increase in influence can largely be attributed to al-Hawrani – several old ASP strongholds voted for the Ba'ath Party because of al-Hawrani's presence. By this time Aflaq was losing much of <b>his</b> <b>power</b> <b>to</b> al-Hawrani and his supporters, who were in {{a majority in the}} party. A proof of this was the decision of the Ba'ath Party to collaborate openly with the Syrian Communist Party (SCP), a move Aflaq opposed. Aflaq was elected the party's Secretary General of the newly established National Command, a title equivalent to 'party leader', by the party's Second National Congress.|$|E
5|$|Hancock's General Order Number 40 {{was quickly}} {{condemned}} by Republicans in Washington, especially by the Radicals, while President Johnson wholeheartedly approved. Heedless {{of the situation}} in Washington, Hancock soon put his words into action, refusing local Republican politicians' requests to use <b>his</b> <b>power</b> <b>to</b> overturn elections and court verdicts, while also letting it be known that open insurrection would be suppressed. Hancock's popularity within the Democratic party grew {{to the extent that he}} was considered a potential presidential nominee for that party in the 1868 election. Although Hancock collected a significant number of delegates at the 1868 convention, his presidential possibilities went unfulfilled. Even so, he was henceforth identified as a rare breed in politics: one who believed in the Democratic Party's principles of states' rights and limited government, but whose anti-secessionist sentiment was unimpeachable.|$|E

5|$|Henry {{inherited}} {{the kingdom of}} England from William Rufus, giving him a claim of suzerainty over Wales and Scotland, and acquired the Duchy of Normandy, a complex entity with troubled borders. The borders between England and Scotland were still uncertain during Henry's reign, with Anglo-Norman influence pushing northwards through Cumbria, but Henry's relationship with King David I of Scotland was generally good, partially due to Henry's marriage to his sister. In Wales, Henry used <b>his</b> <b>power</b> <b>to</b> coerce and charm the indigenous Welsh princes, while Norman Marcher Lords pushed across the valleys of South Wales. Normandy was controlled via various interlocking networks of ducal, ecclesiastical and family contacts, backed by a growing string of important ducal castles along the borders. Alliances and relationships with neighbouring counties along the Norman border were particularly important to maintaining {{the stability of the}} Duchy.|$|E
5|$|In Legacy of the Void, {{not long}} after his {{ascension}} to the throne, Korhal {{and the rest of}} the Dominion are assaulted by Moebius Foundation under control of the fallen Xel'Naga, Amon. Alongside Raynor, he does everything in <b>his</b> <b>power</b> <b>to</b> save his people. When Artanis arrives, he aids Raynor and Valerian to repel the Moebius Foundation on Korhal. After Amon has been banished into the Void, Valerian allows Raynor to take the Dominion Fleet to Ulnar in order to help Kerrigan and Artanis to defeat Amon once for all. After Amon's defeat, Valerian has turned the Terran Dominion into a government of peace and prosperity.|$|E
5|$|It was {{not long}} before the new reign also met with other {{problems}} caused by the central position at court of Roger Mortimer, who was now the de facto ruler of England. Mortimer used <b>his</b> <b>power</b> <b>to</b> acquire noble estates and titles, and his unpopularity grew with the humiliating defeat by the Scots at the Battle of Stanhope Park and the ensuing Treaty of Edinburgh–Northampton, signed with the Scots in 1328. Also the young king came into conflict with his guardian. Mortimer knew his position in relation to the king was precarious and subjected Edward to disrespect. The tension increased after Edward and Philippa, who had married at York Minster on 24 January 1328, had a son on 15 June 1330. Eventually, Edward decided to take direct action against Mortimer. Aided by his close companion William Montagu and a small number of other trusted men, Edward took Mortimer by surprise at Nottingham Castle on 19 October 1330. Mortimer was executed and EdwardIII's personal reign began.|$|E

5|$|Later, Owsley's tenure {{would be}} marred by a {{conflict}} with Benjamin Hardin, his Secretary of State. Hardin believed that by supporting Owsley in the gubernatorial election, he would obtain some influence in Owsley's choices for other appointments. Tensions between Hardin and Owsley worsened as Hardin became increasingly frustrated with his lack of influence. On September 1, 1846, Owsley removed Hardin from his cabinet, charging that Hardin had abandoned his duties {{because he did not}} reside in Frankfort. Hardin challenged this premise for his removal, and when Owsley nominated George B. Kinkead to replace Hardin, the state senate voted 30—8 that no vacancy existed. The Kentucky Court of Appeals upheld this decision. Vindicated, Hardin then resigned, charging Owsley with practicing nepotism. In the Kentucky Constitution of 1850, the governor was stripped of <b>his</b> <b>power</b> <b>to</b> remove the Secretary of State from office.|$|E

He weds Moelia and Retna Sari and has them promise that their first son will be raised a Hindu and become king of the Baduy; he then surrenders all <b>his</b> <b>power</b> <b>to</b> his daughter. Later, hoping that his spirit and those of his ancestors can control the volcano, Noesa Brama secretly commits suicide by jumping into the well. Several weeks later, activity at the volcano drops, although it remains active.|$|E
5|$|Newton {{moved to}} London {{to take up}} the post of warden of the Royal Mint in 1696, a {{position}} that he had obtained through the patronage of Charles Montagu, 1st Earl of Halifax, then Chancellor of the Exchequer. He took charge of England's great recoining, somewhat treading on the toes of Lord Lucas, Governor of the Tower (and securing the job of deputy comptroller of the temporary Chester branch for Edmond Halley). Newton became perhaps the best-known Master of the Mint upon the death of Thomas Neale in 1699, a position Newton held for the last 30 years of his life. These appointments were intended as sinecures, but Newton took them seriously, retiring from his Cambridge duties in 1701, and exercising <b>his</b> <b>power</b> <b>to</b> reform the currency and punish clippers and counterfeiters.|$|E
