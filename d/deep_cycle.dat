25|$|Photo-voltaic panels, wind {{turbines}} <b>deep</b> <b>cycle</b> batteries, meters, sockets cables and connectors are all expensive. Even when the relative difference in buying power, materials cost, opportunity cost, labor cost and overhead are factored in, renewable energy will remain expensive {{for people who}} are living on less than US$1 per day. Many rural electrification projects in the past use government subsidies to finance the implementation of rural development programs. It is difficult for rural electrification projects to be accomplished by for profit companies; in economically impoverished areas these programs must be run at a loss for reasons of practicality. There are several theorized ways in which specific African nations can rally the resources for such projects.|$|E
25|$|There {{are various}} {{extremely}} important electrochemical processes in both nature and industry, like the coating of objects with metals or metal oxides through electrodeposition and {{the detection of}} alcohol in drunken drivers through the redox reaction of ethanol. The generation of chemical energy through photosynthesis is inherently an electrochemical process, as is production of metals like aluminum and titanium from their ores. Certain diabetes blood sugar meters measure the amount of glucose in the blood through its redox potential. As well as the established electrochemical technologies (like <b>deep</b> <b>cycle</b> lead acid batteries) {{there is also a}} wide range of new emerging technologies such as fuel cells, large format lithium ion batteries, electrochemical reactors and super-capacitors that are becoming increasingly commercial. Electrochemistry has also important applications in the food industry, like the assessment of food/package interactions, the analysis of milk composition, the characterization and the determination of the freezing end-point of ice-cream mixes, the determination of free acidity in olive oil.|$|E

50|$|The primary {{advantage}} of their batteries {{is that they can}} be charged very quickly. In testing, a 35 kW·h battery pack was charged in ten minutes. Other advantages include longer life with up to 25,000 <b>deep</b> <b>cycles,</b> higher power density than other nanostructured cells, wider operating temperatures, and greater stability under electrical and mechanical stress (i.e. the cells cannot catch fire). On the other hand, a disadvantage is that they have lower specific energy than other lithium ion cells, 100 versus 120 Wh/kg. They have also been more expensive to produce, at US$2 per Wh, due to low manufacturing volumes.|$|R

40|$|ABSTRACT: The loss {{of sulfur}} cathode {{material}} {{as a result}} of polysulfide dissolution causes significant capacity fading in rechargeable lithium/sulfur cells. Here, we use a chemical approach to immobilize sulfur and lithium polysulfides via the reactive functional groups on graphene oxide. This approach enabled us to obtain a uniform and thin (around tens of nanometers) sulfur coating on graphene oxide sheets by a simple chemical reactiondeposition strategy and a subsequent low-temperature thermal treatment process. Strong interaction between graphene oxide and sulfur or polysulfides enabled us to demonstrate lithium/sulfur cells with a high reversible capacity of 9501400 mA h g 1, and stable cycling for more than 50 <b>deep</b> <b>cycles</b> at 0. 1 C (1 C = 1675 mA g 1).

50|$|Flooded {{lead-acid}} {{batteries are}} the cheapest and in past most common traction batteries available. There {{are two main}} types of lead-acid batteries: automobile engine starter batteries, and <b>deep</b> <b>cycle</b> batteries. Automobile alternators are designed to provide starter batteries high charge rates for fast charges, while <b>deep</b> <b>cycle</b> batteries used for electric vehicles like forklifts or golf carts, and as the auxiliary house batteries in RV's, require different multi-stage charging. No lead acid battery should be discharged below 50% of its capacity, as it shortens the battery's life.

To demonstrate the plug-in electric vehicle agent behavior, an optimization algorithm is presented and two battery aging methods as well as their effect on V 2 G operation are ana-lyzed. Aging costs based on the depth of discharge result in shallow cycles and a strong dependency on driving behavior, because the state-of-charge affects the discharging process.

40|$|In {{this paper}} {{we present a}} series of models for the <b>deep</b> water <b>cycle</b> on super-Earths {{experiencing}} plate tectonics. The <b>deep</b> water <b>cycle</b> can be modeled through parameterized convection models coupled with a volatile recycling model. The convection of the silicate mantle {{is linked to the}} volatile cycle through the water-dependent viscosity. Important differences in surface water content are found for different parameterizations of convection. Surface oceans are smaller and more persistent for single layer convection, rather than convection by boundary layer instability. Smaller planets have initially larger oceans but also return that water to the mantle more rapidly than larger planets. Super-Earths may therefore be less habitable in their early years than smaller planets, but their habitability (assuming stable surface conditions), will persist much longer.

40|$|The {{electrical}} power grid faces a growing need for large-scale energy storage {{over a wide}} range of time scales due to costly short-term transients, frequency regulation, and load balancing. The durability, high power, energy efficiency, and low cost needed for grid-scale storage pose substantial challenges for conventional battery technology. (1, 2) Here, we demonstrate insertion/extraction of sodium and potassium ions in a low-strain nickel hexacyanoferrate electrode material for at least five thousand <b>deep</b> <b>cycles</b> at high current densities in inexpensive aqueous electrolytes. Its open-framework structure allows retention of 66 % of the initial capacity even at a very high (41. 7 C) rate. At low current densities, its round trip energy efficiency reaches 99 %.

The long cycle life, high power, good energy efficiency, safety, and inexpensive production method make nickel hexacyanoferrate an attractive candidate for use in large-scale batteries to support the electrical grid. © 2011 American Chemical Society...|$|R
