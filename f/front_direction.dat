It was first shown alongside the Rekord D at the 1972 Geneva Salon. It was available with the 1697 cc (83 hp) or 1897 cc (97 hp) four-cylinder engines from the Rekord, or {{two versions of the}} 2.5 litre six-cylinder engines as fitted to the Rekord's more luxurious sibling, the Opel Commodore. The Ranger B had twin headlights in place of the Rekord/Commodore's single rectangular lights, repositioned <b>front</b> <b>direction</b> indicators and a reworked front grill with a horizontal bar. There was a stylish raised section on the bonnet/hood which was different from the one used on diesel-engined Rekords, and the rear panel also incorporates detail differences. The Rangers were not strikingly more expensive than equivalently powered Rekords and Commodores, but nor were they perceived as sufficiently differentiated, and Rangers were quietly withdrawn from the showrooms by late 1975.|$|E

In order to meet this demand, the antenna shapes are optimized by the conjugate gradient method in this paper. The time-domain radiating characteristics of the dipole antennas are analyzed by the time stepping method. The objective functions used in the optimization procedure are the peak {{values of the}} radiating pulse in the <b>front</b> <b>direction</b> of the antenna, the variables to be optimized are the included angles of the V-dipoles and the arm radii of the arc-curved dipoles, and the included angles between the ann radii and the axes. ...|$|E

The analysis focuses on the South Madagascar region characterized by the strong East Madagascar Current and sharp gradients of surface tracers. The results are compared against in-situ observations from three moorings along the Jason- 1 track 196. Accurate information on the total velocity direction is the key factor for obtaining accurate estimates of along-track velocities. Although with some limitations, surface tracer fronts can be successfully used to retrieve such information...|$|R

Recent space experiments, in combination with ground-based studies, have shown that elongation growth is stimulated and lateral expansion suppressed in various shoot organs and roots under microgravity conditions. Plant organs also show automorphogenesis in space, which consists of altered growth direction and spontaneous curvature in the dorsiventral (back and <b>front)</b> <b>directions.</b> Changes in cell wall properties are responsible for these modifications of growth and morphogenesis under microgravity conditions.

There is a distinct class of Alfvenic fluctuations with phase planes nearly parallel to the mean field B sub 0. The characteristic length of the phase fronts of the fluctuations is probably significantly greater than 50 R-E. It is concluded that since tangential discontinuities and possibly other types of static structures appear in Alfvenic fluctuations, these fluctuations are not solely Alfven waves...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{an investigation of}} the side wall effects on facade flames ejected from the opening (such as a window) of an under-ventilated room fire. Experiments are carried out in a reduced-scale experimental setup, consisting of a cubic fire compartment having an opening with a vertical facade wall and two side walls normal to the façade wall. By changing the distance of the two side walls, the facade flame heights for different opening conditions (width, height) are recorded by a CCD camera. It is found that as the distance of the two side walls decreases the behavior the flame height can be distinguished into two regimes characterized by the dimensionless excess heat release rate, skew 5 dotQ_ex^ast See Formula in PDF, outside the opening: (a) for the “wall fire” (skew 5 dotQ_ex^ast See Formula in PDF ≤ 1. 3), the flame height is shown to change little with decrease of side wall distance as the dominant entrainment is from the <b>front</b> <b>direction</b> (normal to the facade wall) independent of the side wall distances; (b) for the “axis-symmetrical fire” (5 dotQ_ex^ast > 1. 3), the flame height increases significantly with a decrease in side wall distance as both the entrainment from the two side directions (parallel to the facade wall) and that from the <b>front</b> <b>direction</b> (normal to the facade wall) together apply. A global physically based non-dimensional factor K is then brought forward based on the side wall constraint effect on the facade flame entrainment to characterize the side wall effect on the flame height, by accounting for the dimensionless excess heat release rate, the characteristic length scales of the opening as well as the side wall separation distance. The experimental data for different opening dimensions and side wall distances collapse by using this global non-dimensional factor...|$|E

40|$|Multi-channel {{self-steering}} microphone arrays for {{hearing aid}} applications enable the hearing impaired user to follow conversations coming from other directions than the <b>front</b> <b>direction.</b> Binaural connections between {{left and right}} hearing aids allow for (i) the estimation of the direction of arrival (DOA) and thus for automatic beam-steering, (ii) a higher noise reduction due to {{a greater number of}} sensors, and (iii) the preservation or reconstruction of binaural cues that can be used by the hearing impaired listener for object segregation. Since the microphones are placed near the human head, diffraction and shadowing effects have to be incorporated into the beamformer design as well as into the DOA estimator. In this contribution a combined system of DOA estimation and a head-worn 6 -channel binaural noise reduction scheme is presented and evaluated using perceptual measures that are based on auditory models. ...|$|E

30|$|The {{trend of}} {{estimation}} bias {{is represented in}} Figure 9 which shows the results in the low DOA angle and high DOA angle cases separately. The phase of high DOA angle cases are commonly wrapped because the wrapping is occurred when the DOA angle is lager than 32 ° in our simulation condition. All of the tested algorithms are hardly biased when the source is located in <b>front</b> <b>direction</b> of dual-sensor as depicted in Figure 9 a because the phase wrapping {{is less likely to}} occur for a low DOA angle incident case. As shown in Figure 9 b, however, the estimation bias for a signal from the high DOA angle generally increases. Since the bias problem becomes more serious when the IPD is getting closer to +π (or -π) as we described in Figures 6 and 7. The proposed algorithm working in the expanded phase domain, however, does not suffer from the bias especially in noisy environment.|$|E

40|$|Modelling of {{solidification}} process by {{the method of}} cellular automaton (CA) requires determination of geometrical characteristics of the interface, i. e. of its direction and curvature. In previous studies the authors proposed a method to reduce the well-known effect of an artificial symmetry of the simulation results caused by the anisotropy of the CA computation grid (e. g. a preferred growth of the main dendrite arms along the grid lines or at an angle of 45 ° {{in the case of}} grids with square cells). The aim was achieved by application of the developed methods of computation of the transformation rate and <b>front</b> <b>direction.</b> In this study the authors examined the problem of an accuracy of the computations of an interface curvature.

Practical application of the proposed tests enables selection of a best solution, including the authors' own solutions, thus considerably improving an accuracy of the solidification modelling by the method of CA...|$|E

40|$|Surprisingly {{expensive}} to compute wall distances are still {{used in a}} range of key turbulence and peripheral physics models. Potentially economical, accuracy improving differential equation-based distance algorithms are considered. These involve elliptic Poisson and a hyperbolic-natured Eikonal equation approaches. Numerical issues relating to non-orthogonal curvilinear grid solution of the latter are addressed. Eikonal extension to a Hamilton-Jacob equation is discussed. Use of this extension to improve turbulence model accuracy and, along with the Eikonal, enhance detached eddy simulation (DES) techniques is considered. Application of the distance approaches is studied for various geometries. These include a plane channel flow with a wire at the centre, a wing-flap system, and a supersonic double-delta configuration. Although less accurate than the Eikonal, Poisson method-based flow solutions are extremely close to those using a search procedure. For a moving grid case the Poisson method is found especially efficient. Results show that the Eikonal equation can be solved on highly stretched, non-orthogonal, and curvilinear grids. A key accuracy aspect is that metrics must be upwinded in the propagating <b>front</b> <b>direction.</b> The Hamilton-Jacobi equation is found to have qualitative turbulence model improving properties.

40|$|International audienceThis {{experiment}} {{was designed to}} assess the combined influence of practice schedule (blocked or random), task similarity (similar or dissimilar), and amount of practice on motor learning. Participants were required to perform three movement times (200, 350, 500 ms) in a blocked or random schedule while pointing towards the target located in the <b>front</b> <b>direction</b> in the similar condition, or towards three targets (left, front, and right) in the dissimilar condition. In each condition, participants completed 99 or 297 acquisition trials before a delayed retention test similar for all participants. Results indicated a contextual interference (CI) effect due to the schedule of practice following 297 trials for similar task: blocked schedule tended to produce better performance early in practice; random schedule enhanced learning for a larger amount of practice. However, when participants experienced dissimilar task variations, no blocked-random difference was found whatever the amount of practice. This suggests that task similarity is a learning variable that modulates the CI effect. Our findings argue for {{the evidence that the}} intertask processing evoked by random schedule is not sufficient to improve learning and {{that there may be a}} ceiling effect on retention performance due to the extent of additional intertask processing...|$|E
