5|$|In 1994 {{the general}} {{design of the}} {{banknotes}} was reviewed {{to keep up with}} advancing technologies against counterfeiting, which resulted in the release of two new denominations ($50 and $100) between 1994 and 1995, also to counter the effects of consumer price inflation, which peaked at 41.6% in 1992. Although the Chiremba Balancing Rocks were retained, other features including latent imaging in which the letters RBZ can be seen when the banknote is tilted horizontally at the eye level and <b>identification</b> <b>marks</b> for the visually impaired were added to the design, and the neck of the Zimbabwe Bird watermark was longer. The $5, $10 and $20 banknotes were also revised with the new designs in 1997, whilst the $2 banknote was and replaced by a coin in the same year with the $5 denomination undergoing the same process in August 2001.|$|E
5|$|In late 2007 {{plans were}} {{announced}} {{to create a}} stud book for the breed, a collaborative venture between the Marwari Horse Society of India and the Indian government. A registration process was initiated in 2009, {{when it was announced}} that the Marwari Horse Society had become a government body, the only government-authorized registration society for Marwari horses. The registration process includes an evaluation of the horse against the breed standards, during which unique <b>identification</b> <b>marks</b> and physical dimensions are recorded. After the evaluation, the horse is cold branded with its registration number and photographed. In late 2009 the Indian government announced that the Marwari horse, along with other Indian horse breeds, would be commemorated on a set of stamps issued by that country.|$|E
25|$|Watermarks are <b>identification</b> <b>marks</b> {{produced}} during the paper making process. The first watermarks appeared in Italy during the 13th century, but their use rapidly spread across Europe. They {{were used as}} a means to identify the papermaker or the trade guild that manufactured the paper. The marks often were created by a wire sewn onto the paper mold. Watermarks continue to be used today as manufacturer's marks and to prevent forgery.|$|E

25|$|Earlier {{than the}} {{attestations}} {{in the full}} function as a numeral are a few instances where sampi was used in Athens as a mark to enumerate sequences of things in a set, along with the 24 other letters of the alphabet, without implying a specific decimal numeral value. For instance, there {{is a set of}} 25 metal tokens, each stamped with one of the letters from alpha to sampi, which are dated to the 4th century BC and were probably used as <b>identification</b> <b>marks</b> for judges in the courts of the Athenian democracy.|$|E
25|$|A {{visit to}} the {{workshops}} always makes a deep impression. At the forges hirsute men, stripped to the waist, move rapidly and methodically {{in front of the}} ovens. The bars of iron, heated to an exact temperature, are swallowed by the presses and moulded into the desired shape in a second. The rough form of a shell, glowing bright red, and carrying on its flank the first <b>identification</b> <b>marks,</b> is then rolled towards the yard, like a beautiful but terrible toy, a friend of the graves. As soon as the shell has cooled enough, skilful hands take it, smooth and polish it, and finish it to perfection. But it was dangerous work, and the hospital had a steady stream of ‘work-wounded’ to deal with, some minor, some much more serious. As an example, here is part of the story of one man.|$|E
25|$|The {{turning point}} came when, on 29 June, clothes, boots and keys found stowed at Haarmann's {{apartment}} {{were identified as}} belonging to a missing 18-year-old named Robert Witzel. A skull which {{had been found in}} a garden on 20 May (which had not initially been connected with later skeletal discoveries) had been identified as that of the missing youth. A friend of Witzel identified a police officer seen in the company of the youth the day prior to his disappearance as Fritz Haarmann. Confronted with this evidence, Haarmann briefly attempted to bluster his way out of these latest and most damning pieces of evidence. When Robert Witzel's jacket was found in the possession of his landlady and he was confronted with various witnesses' testimony as to his destroying <b>identification</b> <b>marks</b> upon the clothing, Haarmann broke down and had to be supported by his sister.|$|E

500|$|Operation Ursula (named {{after the}} {{daughter}} of Karl Dönitz) saw a group of German U-boats active around the waters near Spain against the Spanish Republican Navy, under the overall command of Hermann Boehm (Konteradmiral since 1934, and Vizeadmiral since April 1, 1937) in Berlin. It began on 20 November 1936, with the movement of [...] and [...] from Wilhelmshaven. Any <b>identification</b> <b>marks</b> were obscured, and the whole mission was kept secret. They entered the Mediterranean {{on the night of}} 27–28 November, taking over from Italian submarine patrols. If damaged, they were to sail to La Maddelena, and enter under an Italian ensign. U-33 operated around Alicante, and U-34 around Cartagena. Difficulties in identifying legitimate targets and concerns about discovery limited their operations. The torpedoes they used also often malfunctioned. During their return to Wilhelmshaven in December, the Spanish Republican submarine C-3 was sunk; the Germans claimed this was due to a torpedo fired from U-34, although the Republicans' enquiry claimed its loss was due to an internal explosion. Their return marked the official end of Operation Ursula. However, it does seem that further submarines were sent in mid-1937, but details of the operation are not known; six (U-25, U-26, U-27, U-28, U-31 and U-35) are believed to have been involved. Five submarine commanders received the Spanish Cross in Bronze without Swords in 1939.|$|E
2500|$|In August 2006, NASA 928 {{arrived at}} RAF Mildenhall totally devoid {{of all the}} usual <b>identification</b> <b>marks,</b> {{particularly}} serial numbers or NASA logos. [...] The only insignia were a small U.S. flag on the tail fin and some even smaller flags beneath the cockpit on the port side. The lack of insignia possibly indicated that the aircraft was operating on behalf of another U.S. government agency. After some local sorties, possibly to test the onboard equipment, the aircraft departed to Kandahar Airport, Afghanistan via NSA Souda Bay, Crete. The aircraft then flew a number of sorties out of Kandahar, presumably carrying a classified sensor package and returned to Ellington Field via Souda Bay and Mildenhall.|$|E

40|$|Internet hosts are {{threatened}} by large-scale Distributed Denial-of-Service (DDoS) attacks. The Path Identification DDoS defense scheme has recently been proposed as a deterministic packet marking scheme that allows a DDoS victim to filter out attack packets on a per packet basis with high accuracy {{after only a few}} attack packets are received. This paper proposes the Stack Path <b>identification</b> <b>marking,</b> a new packet marking scheme based on path identification, and new filtering mechanisms. The Stack Path <b>Identification</b> <b>marking</b> scheme consists of two new marking methods that substantially improve Path identifier’s incremental deployment performance i. e., Stack-based marking and Write-ahead marking. The proposed scheme almost completely eliminates the effect of a few legacy routers on a path, and performs better than the original Path identification scheme in a sparse deployment of path identifier enabled routers. For the filtering mechanism, derive an optimal threshold strategy for filtering with the Path <b>identification</b> <b>marking.</b> The system develops the path identification IP filter, which can be used to detect IP spoofing attacks with just a single attack packet. Finally, evaluate the Stack path identification’s compatibility with IP Fragmentation, applicability in an IPv 6 environment, and several other important issues relating to potential deployment of Stack path identification.
