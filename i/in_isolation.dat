5|$|Another {{factor in}} the Mellotron's sound is that the {{individual}} notes were recorded <b>in</b> <b>isolation.</b> For a musician accustomed to playing in an orchestral setting, this was unusual, and meant that they had nothing against which to intonate. Noted cellist Reginald Kirby refused to downtune his cello to cover the lower range of the Mellotron, and so the bottom notes are actually performed on a double bass. According to Mellotron author Nick Awde, one note of the string sounds contains {{the sound of a}} chair being scraped in the background.|$|E

40|$|Abstract Background Uropathogenic Escherichia coli O- Serogroups {{with their}} {{virulence}} factors {{are the most}} prevalent causes of UTIs. The present research performed to track common uropathogenic E. coli serogroups, antibiotic resistance pattern of strains and prevalence of virulence genes <b>in</b> <b>isolations</b> having the ability to constitute biofilm. Methods In this research 130 E. coli isolation from patients having UTI symptoms were collected and antimicrobial resistance pattern was performed by Kirby-Bauer method. Polymerase chain reaction was done using primer pairs to identify common serogroups of uropathogenic E. coli and studying virulence genes <b>in</b> <b>isolations</b> creating biofilm. Results Among 130 E. coli isolates, 80 (61. 53  %) {{were able to make}} biofilm that 15 isolates (18. 75  %) indicated strong reaction, 20 (25  %) of medium and 45 (56. 25  %) of weak biofilm reaction. Among isolations creating biofilm, the highest resistance reported to Ampicillin (87. 5  %) and the lowest to Nitrofurantoin (3. 75  %). The frequency of fimH, pap, sfa and afa genes <b>in</b> <b>isolations</b> having the ability to create strong biofilm reported 93. 33  %, 86. 66  %, 86. 66  % and 66. 66  %, respectively. Conclusions The findings indicated the importance of virulence genes in serogroups producing uropathogenic E. coli biofilm. It is recommended that strains producing biofilm before antibiotic use should be studied...|$|R

In a Spanish study, boxes {{made from a}} mixture of wood and {{concrete}} (woodcrete) had a much higher occupancy rate than wooden boxes (76.5% versus 33.5%), and birds nesting in woodcrete sites had earlier clutches, a shorter incubation period and more breeding attempts per season. Clutch size and chick condition did not differ between nest box types, but reproductive success was higher in woodcrete, perhaps because the synthetic nests were 1.5°C warmer than their wooden counterparts.|$|E

5|$|A {{criticism}} {{of this method}} {{is that it can}} be statistically weak. Schaefer in particular has questioned how robust the claimed alignments in the Caracol are. Because of the wide variety of evidence, which can include artefacts as well as sites, there is no one way to practice archaeoastronomy. Despite this it is accepted that archaeoastronomy is not a discipline that sits <b>in</b> <b>isolation.</b> Because archaeoastronomy is an interdisciplinary field, whatever is being investigated should make sense both archaeologically and astronomically. Studies {{are more likely to be}} considered sound if they use theoretical tools found in archaeology like analogy and homology and if they can demonstrate an understanding of accuracy and precision found in astronomy. Both quantitative analyses and interpretations based on ethnographic analogies and other contextual evidence have recently been applied in systematic studies of architectural orientations in the Maya area and in other parts of Mesoamerica.|$|E
