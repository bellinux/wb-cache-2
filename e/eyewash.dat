2500|$|In October 1980, Julia Cave and a {{team from}} the BBC arrived in Abydos to film the {{documentary}} Omm Sety and Her Egypt. Featuring interviews with Egyptologists T. G. H. James and Rosalie David, it described Abydos and the excavations that had been undertaken. It had extensive input from Omm Sety, who used crutches due to her deteriorating health. The documentary was broadcast on BBC 2 in May 1981. The Times wrote of the documentary: [...] "An incredulous smile froze on my lips as I watched the Chronicle film Omm Sety and Her Egypt. Could I be absolutely positive {{it was all a}} lot of <b>eyewash?</b> Of course I couldn't. And neither will you be able to. In any case, it makes marvellous television." [...] At the time the BBC were recording their documentary, the American producer Miriam Birch asked Omm Sety to appear, along with Egyptologists Kent Weeks and Lanny Bell, in a documentary that National Geographic Channel was filming, Egypt: Quest for Eternity. It concentrated on Rameses II, the son of Seti I. Shooting took place in March 1981, coinciding with Omm Sety's seventy-seventh birthday party at Chicago House, which was filmed. She was {{in a lot of pain}} but full of good cheer, and the film crew carried her up to the Temple of Seti for filming. This was to be her last visit to the shrine in which she believed she had served as a priestess 3,000 years before.|$|E

"There's {{one thing}} I wish," [...] remarked Miss Adams, in the hard, {{metallic}} voice {{with which she}} disguised her softness of heart, [...] "and that is, that I could see the Legislature {{of this country and}} lay a few cold-drawn facts in front of them, I'd make a platform of my own, Mr. Stephens, and run a party on my ticket. A Bill for the compulsory use of <b>eyewash</b> would be one of my planks, and another would be for the abolition of those Yashmak veil things which turn a woman into a bale of cotton goods with a pair of eyes looking out of it." ...|$|E
60|$|The site of Equator City--we named {{our city}} for the schooner--was soon chosen. The {{immediate}} shores of the lagoon are windy and blinding; Tembinok' himself is glad to grope blue-spectacled on his terrace; and we fled the neighbourhood of the red conjunctiva, the suppurating eyeball, and the beggar who pursues and beseeches the passing foreigner for <b>eyewash.</b> Behind the town the country is diversified; here open, sandy, uneven, and dotted with dwarfish palms; here cut up with taro trenches, deep and shallow, and, according {{to the growth of}} the plants, presenting now the appearance of a sandy tannery, now of an alleyed and green garden. A path leads towards the sea, mounting abruptly to the main level of the island--twenty or even thirty feet, although Findlay gives five; and just hard by the top of the rise, where the coco-palms begin to be well grown, we found a grove of pandanus, and a piece of soil pleasantly covered with green underbush. A well was not far off under a rustic well-house; nearer still, in a sandy cup of the land, a pond where we might wash our clothes. The place was out of the wind, out of the sun, and {{out of sight of the}} village. It was shown to the king, and the town promised for the morrow.|$|E
50|$|<b>Eyewashes</b> may be {{beneficial}} to those with sensitive eyes and can provide relief to the painful side effects of sensitivity. However, prolonged usage of such products will cause mild side effects, such as the reddening of the eye and/or pupil and cause itchiness. If such symptoms occur, {{it is best to}} see one's family doctor.|$|R
60|$|General Remarks.--Travellers are apt {{to expect}} too much from their medicines, {{and to think that}} savages will hail them as demigods {{wherever}} they go. But their patients are generally cripples who want to be made whole in a moment, and other suchlike impracticable cases. Powerful emetics, purgatives, and <b>eyewashes</b> are the most popular physickings.|$|R
50|$|Otto Carl Friedrich Westphal (1800 - 1879) was a German {{physician}} and Geheimer Sanitätsrath (privy medical counsellor). He {{wrote on the}} human eye and on optics. He was interested in environmental impacts on eyesight, including light quality, and argued that eyeglasses should be tailored to occupation. He also examined a variety of <b>eyewashes</b> and tinctures, and reportedly invented eye occlusion therapy, currently used for correction of strabismus and amblyopia. He was married to Karoline Friederike Heine, {{the daughter of a}} wealthy Jewish banker, and is the father of Carl Friedrich Otto Westphal and grandfather of Alexander Carl Otto Westphal.|$|R
50|$|Also {{known as}} a {{personal}} <b>eyewash</b> unit, it is a supplementary for <b>eyewash</b> stations. However, <b>eyewash</b> stations cannot be replaced by <b>eyewash</b> bottles since they do not meet safety standards. <b>Eyewash</b> bottles allow an individual to flush the injured area immediately, or until the individual can reach the fixed <b>eyewash</b> station. Early eyewashes were designed with a single rinsing stream, but recent advancements have made eyewashes capable of flushing both eyes simultaneously. A pH neutral solution for emergency <b>eyewash</b> may also be chosen to reduce the danger from contaminants if strong acid or alkali chemicals are present.|$|E
50|$|There {{are several}} types of {{emergency}} <b>eyewash</b> station and safety shower station systems, including safety showers, <b>eyewash</b> stations, drench hoses, combination units, and <b>eyewash</b> bottles.|$|E

5000|$|Both {{seasonal}} {{allergic conjunctivitis}} and perennial allergic conjunctivitis are two acute allergic conjunctival disorders. SAC {{is the most}} common ocular allergy. Symptoms of the aforementioned ocular diseases include itching and pink to reddish eye(s). These two eye conditions are mediated by mast cells. [...] Nonspecific measures to ameliorate symptoms include cold compresses, <b>eyewashes</b> with tear substitutes, and avoidance of allergens. [...] Treatment consists of antihistamine, mast cell stabilizers, dual mechanism anti-allergen agents, or topical antihistamines. [...] Corticosteroids are another option, but, considering the side-effects of cataracts and increased intraocular pressure, corticosteroids are reserved for more severe forms of allergic conjunctivitis such as vernal keratoconjunctivitis (VKC) and atopic keratoconjunctivitis (AKC).|$|R
50|$|An {{example of}} nasal decongestants is {{pseudoephedrine}} and its side-effects include insomnia, restlessness, and difficulty urinating. Some other nasal sprays are available by prescription, including Azelastine and Ipratropium. Some of their side-effects include drowsiness. For eye symptoms, {{it is important}} to first bath the eyes with plain <b>eyewashes</b> to reduce the irritation. People should not wear contact lenses during episodes of conjunctivitis. Allergy immonotherapy (AIT) treatment involves administering doses of allergens to accustom the body to induce specific long-term tolerance. Allergy immunotherapy can be administered orally (as sublingual tablets or sublingual drops), or by injections under the skin (subcutaneous). Discovered by Leonard Noon and John Freeman in 1911, allergy immunotherapy represents the only causative treatment for respiratory allergies.|$|R
2500|$|Promotional {{and content}} based DVDs began to emerge, {{such as the}} works from the UK's ITV1 {{television}} series Mixmasters (2000–2005) produced by Addictive TV, Lightrhythm Visuals (2003), Visomat Inc. (2002), and Pixdisc, all of which focused on the visual creators, VJ styles and techniques. These were then later followed by NOTV, Atmospherix, and other labels. Mia Makela curated a DVD collection for Mediateca of Caixa Forum called [...] "LIVE CINEMA" [...] in 2007, focusing on the emerging sister practice of [...] "live cinema". Individual VJs and collectives also published DVDs and CD-ROMs of their work, including Eclectic Method's bootleg video mix (2002) and Eclectic Method's [...] "We're Not VJs" [...] (2005), as well as <b>eyewash's</b> [...] "DVD2" [...] (2004) and their [...] "DVD3" [...] (2008).|$|R

5000|$|According to Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), several {{regulation}} of emergency <b>eyewash</b> and shower station {{was developed and}} contained in 29 CFR 1910.151 stated that [...] "Where the eyes or body of any person may be exposed to injurious corrosive materials, suitable facilities for quick drenching or flushing of the eyes and body shall be provided within the work area for immediate emergency use." [...] However, OSHA regulation is unclear on defining what facility is required. From this reason, American National Standards Institute (ANSI) has developed a standard for emergency <b>eyewash</b> and shower station including the design.|$|E
50|$|A {{combination}} unit {{is where}} other units {{such as a}} shower station, <b>eyewash</b> station, and drench hose share the same water supply plumbing. This unit is useful in laboratory where hazardous chemicals with different properties are used.|$|E
