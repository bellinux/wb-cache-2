Unfortunately, {{in our country}} because of different reasons, production and supply of <b>fish</b> <b>sausage</b> in industrial level {{has not yet been}} successful and some efforts taken, has also been doomed to failure or not welcomed. Fat fish is a rich source of poly unsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) and co- 3. In this research, efforts have been made to produce and enrich sausage with fish oil and maintenance of fatty acids has also been experimented using gas chromatography along with heating process. The stages of producing ground fish and <b>fish</b> <b>sausage</b> are as the following: Transferring and preparing fish, washing the cleared fish, filleting, separating fillet steak, washing and drying them, Refining meat, Producing and homogenizing mixture from basic ingredients in a cutter, filling, knotting and heat processing. The <b>fish</b> <b>sausage</b> produced by this method tried and welcomed by the subjects. In the product in which fish meat was used, the subjects was not recognized fish flavor and taste and when in addition to fish meat, fish oil was used during enrichment, the flavor and taste of fish was considered as highly acceptable. TVN measurement of the produced <b>fish</b> <b>sausage</b> was kept in the refrigerator in two month was at a maximum of 16. 5, the amount of peroxide was at a maximum 1. 5 % after the period of two months.

3000|$|Overall surimi {{products}} in the Southeast Asian Region in 2005 {{are estimated to be}} 315, 800 metric tons. Thailand was the largest surimi producer followed by Malaysia and Vietnam with the amount of surimi products of 145, 000, 95, 300, and 64, 000 metric tons, respectively (Pangsorn et al. [2007]). Surimi can be used to prepare a variety of processed foods such as kamaboko, kani (crab) -kamaboko, chikuwa, Satsuma-age, <b>fish</b> <b>sausages,</b> <b>fish</b> balls, etc. Surimi with high quality yields the flexible gel with white color. To improve the properties of surimi gel, a number of additives have been used. Protein additives with proteolytic inhibitory activity or protein cross-linkers such as microbial transglutaminase (MTGase) have been widely used in surimi (Benjakul and Visessanguan [2003]; Benjakul et al. [2004 a]). MTGase from Streptoverticillium mobaraense does not require calcium ions for its activity (Ando et al. [1989]). MTGase is an enzyme that catalyzes the cross-linking of proteins through the formation of covalent bonds between protein molecules. MTGase {{has been shown to be}} useful in strengthening surimi gels during the setting (Benjakul et al. [2003]; Seguro et al. [2006]). The addition of MTGase to surimi significantly increased gel strength, particularly when the surimi has lower natural setting ability (Kumazawa et al. [1993]; Lee and Park [2006]). An increase in non-disulfide polymerization and formation of ϵ-([...] γ-glutamyl) lysine isopeptides was found with increasing setting time and MTGase concentration (Tsukamasa et al. [1990]).|$|R
40|$|Fragment-size {{distributions}} {{have been}} studied experimentally in masticated viscoelastic food (<b>fish</b> <b>sausage).</b> The mastication experiment in seven subjects was examined. We classified the obtained results into two groups, namely, a single lognormal distribution group and a lognormal distribution with exponential tail group. The facts suggest that the individual variability might affect the fragmentation pattern when the food sample has a much more complicated physical property. In particular, the latter result (lognormal distribution with exponential tail) indicates that the fragmentation pattern by human mastication for <b>fish</b> <b>sausage</b> {{is different from the}} fragmentation pattern for raw carrot shown in our previous study.

40|$|The {{films of}} rubber {{hydrochloride}} (RH) and polyvinylidenchloride (PC) are commercially used for casing of <b>fish</b> <b>sausage.</b> But {{it has been}} recognized that the <b>fish</b> <b>sausage</b> cased with RH film is preserved longer in a good condition than that cased with PC film, and that PC film is not suitable for this purpose, especially in summer. The results of studies on the cause of difference in preservation period between the fish sausages cased with these two films are presented. At first, the aerial permeability test of the film {{was carried out by}} using resazurin. The result was that PC film was less permeable than RH film, so that there was no correlation between the aerial permeability of the films and the preservation period. It is known, moreover, that chlorine ion is liberated from RH film when heated, but the author 2 ̆ 7 s examination proved that it has no influence on the bacterial growth. In connection with this fact, it was confirmed that some substance liberated by heating from RH film inhibited the growth of bacteria. It is concerned with some of the compounding ingredients of rubber. It seems that the substance is liberated from RH film during heating process in the case of manufacturing <b>fish</b> <b>sausage,</b> and that it plays a part in inhibiting the growth of bacteria in the superficial portion of <b>fish</b> <b>sausage.</b> 塩酸ゴム(Rubber hydrochloride,以下RHと略記),ポリビニリデソクロライド(Polyvinylidenchloride,以下PCと略記) などのフィルムが魚肉ソーセージのケーシングとして主に使用されているが,PCフィルムで包装した方がRHフィルムを用いた場合よりも腐敗しやすいと一般に言われており,ことに夏季においてはPCフィルムは使用されていないようである. 貯蔵期間にこのような差の生ずる原因については報告を見ない. 著者は魚肉ソーセージの腐敗菌は嫌気性菌の場合もあるが,主として好気性菌であると報告されていることから考えて,両フィルムの通気性についてレサズリンを用いて検べたところ,RHフィルムがPCフィルムに較べて相当大きかつた. しかし,製造後の貯蔵期間はPCフィルムを用いた方がRHフィルムを用いた場合よりも逆に短かいことから推察すると空気の透過性とは無関係のようである. 一方著者はRHフィルムを加熱すると塩素イオンが遊離することから両フィルムの物理的性質よりも,むしろ化学的性質の差に基づくものであろうと考えて実験を行ない,加熱によつてRHフィルムからは微生物の増殖を阻害する物質が遊離されることを知り,その物質がRHの製造過程中に加えられる配合成分と関係のあることを確めた...|$|E
