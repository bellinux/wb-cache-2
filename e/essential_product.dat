25|$|California pioneers after 1848 {{discovered}} {{an increasing number}} of oil seeps—oil seeping to the surface, especially in Humboldt, Colusa, Santa Clara, and San Mateo counties, and in the asphaltum seeps and bituminous residues in Mendocino, Marin, Contra Costa, Santa Clara, and Santa Cruz counties. In Southern California, large seeps in Ventura, Santa Barbara, Kern, and Los Angeles counties received the most attention. Interest in oil and gas seeps was stirred in the 1850s and 1860s, becoming widespread after the 1859 commercial uses of oil were demonstrated in Pennsylvania. Kerosene quickly replaced whale oil for lighting, and lubricating oils became an <b>essential</b> <b>product</b> in the Machine Age. Other uses later in the 19th century included providing paving material for many roads and providing power for many steam locomotives and steam-powered shipping—replacing coal.|$|E

Maldivian coir was exported to Sindh, China, Yemen, and the Persian Gulf. [...] "It {{is stronger than}} hemp", wrote Ibn Battuta, [...] "and is used to sew together the planks of Sindhi and Yemeni dhows, for this sea abounds in reefs, and if the planks were fastened with iron nails, they would break into pieces when the vessel hit a rock. The coir gives the boat greater elasticity, so that it doesn't break up." ...|$|E

5000|$|Middle Eastern {{seafarers}} {{had just}} begun to take over the Indian Ocean trade routes in the 10th century and found Maldives to be an important link in those routes as the first landfall for traders from Basra sailing to Southeast Asia. Trade involved mainly cowrie shells [...] - [...] widely used as a form of currency throughout Asia and parts of the East African coast [...] - [...] and coir fiber. The Bengal Sultanate, where cowrie shells was used as legal tender, was one of the principal trading partners of the Maldives. The Bengal-Maldives cowry shell trade was the largest shell currency trade network in history. The other <b>essential</b> <b>product</b> of the Maldives was coir, the fibre of the dried coconut husk, resistant to saltwater. It stitched together and rigged the dhows that plied the Indian Ocean.

50|$|Inland water {{transportation}} {{to connect the}} agriculture-rich middle and upper regions of the Obitsu developed slowly and reached its zenith on the Obitsu River in the Edo period (1603 - 1868). The Tokugawa shogunate showed strong interest in products from Kazusa Province. The shogunate excavated and straightened the meandering middle part of the Obitsu River to develop new paddy fields for the cultivation of rice and renkon lotus root. Like the Yōrō River and the Koito River, small riverboats were used on the Obitsu. Rice, as the nengu tax tribute to the Tokugawa shogunate, passed from the former Kururi Region of Kimitsu to the port at Kisarazu, typically crossing a distance of 27.5 km2. Charcoal, an <b>essential</b> <b>product</b> in the Edo capital, was produced in the central region of the Boso Peninsula, and was another essential trade product on the Obitsu. In the most prosperous period of the Obitsu River, there were 35 riverboats active in trade, and most were property of individual villages along middle and {{upper reaches of the}} river. The mouth of the Obitsu River became a lively trade center, as the Port of Kisarazu had exclusive rights to sea traffic between the western Bōsō Peninsula and the Edo capital.|$|E
5000|$|Pete Tamlyn {{reviewed}} Avengers Assembled! for Imagine magazine. He {{opined that}} [...] "Avengers Assembled! {{will be an}} <b>essential</b> <b>product</b> for most players of the game". He stated: [...] "Personal preferences aside, the Avengers are probably the ideal group to choose {{if you are going}} to run an extended campaign using MSH. There have been so many members and roster changes that your players are almost certain to be able to pick a character each without conflict over who plays which particular favourite, or someone getting lumbered with a character that doesn't suit their style of play." [...] He continued: [...] "There are a few grossly powerful characters among them, and I'd recommend that Thor in particular be kept as an NPC who can rescue the players in times of dire emergency, but the only real wimps, Wasp and Hawkeye, are among the most interesting characters to play. My only complaint is that many of the villains are also very tough, the sort of folks who take on the Avengers single-handed and are normally only defeated thanks to their arrogance and over-confidence, and will therefore be quite difficult for the GM to handle." [...] Tamlyn concluded by saying: [...] "Overall, a much-needed publication which will sell very well." ...|$|E

Evaluating the {{consequences}} of the existing creator and inventor doctrine on access to public goods, this paper investigates the ways of finding the most adequate legal protection that may bridge public interest and private interest in this respect.

In addition, it proposes the embodiment of humanistic rationalisation and the U-Principle in order to protect public interest.
