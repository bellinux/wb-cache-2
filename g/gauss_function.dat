40|$|Abstract — The {{proteins}} {{representing the}} structures of ordered form in respect to their tertiary structure are discussed. The hydrophobic core of 3 -D <b>Gauss</b> <b>function</b> (“fuzzy oil drop” model) appeared {{to be present in}} some proteins. The proteins of the structure with ordered form of vdW and/or electrostatic internal interaction in protein body are discussed in the paper. The vdW interaction distribution in proteins appeared to be accordant with assumed 3 -D <b>Gauss</b> <b>function</b> while the electrostatic represents the distribution of random form. This characteristics allows interpretation of the tertiary structure as the effect of external/internal force field influence expressed by 3 -D <b>Gauss</b> <b>function</b> in respect to hydrophobic and/or vdW interaction. It is postulated that the additional introduction of 3 -D <b>Gauss</b> <b>function</b> representing the influence of external environment (in contrast to internal force field of protein body) in the simulation of protein folding process in silico may simplify the optimization procedure leading to the appropriate order on the level of tertiary structure of protein molecule and directing the hydrophobic residues {{toward the center of the}} protein body with the exposure of hydrophilic residues on the surface. The procedure minimize the differences between internal interactions and the idealized one expressed by external force field...|$|E
