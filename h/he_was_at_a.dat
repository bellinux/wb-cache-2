5|$|The most {{difficult}} scene for Whedon to film was Willow panicking in her dormitory room. Her obsession {{about what to}} wear to visit Buffy was inspired by Whedon's own experiences when <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>at</b> <b>a</b> loss for what tie to wear for a friend's funeral. He praised Alyson Hannigan's acting, saying {{that she was able}} to be consistently emotional in every take and make him and the crew cry every time. Whedon acknowledged his difficulty speaking on the DVD commentary while watching Hannigan in the scene.|$|E
5|$|A few teams {{expressed}} interest in St. Louis. He chose to sign with the Tampa Bay Lightning as he believed {{they were the most}} likely to give him playing time in the NHL. He made his debut with the team on October 6, 2000. He struggled at first, failing to score a goal in the first six weeks of the season and again found himself out of the lineup at times. Realizing that <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>at</b> <b>a</b> career crossroads, St. Louis abandoned the changes to his game that his NHL coaches had impressed on him, trusting his own instincts. He scored his first goal of the season in late November, and finished the season with 18 goals and 40 points – 34 of which came after December 1.|$|E
5|$|Bryennios had camped at {{the plain}} of Kedoktos (a name {{deriving}} from the Latin aquaeductus) {{on the road}} to Constantinople. His army comprised 12,000 mostly seasoned men from the regiments (tagmata) of Thessaly, Macedonia and Thrace, as well as Frankish mercenaries and the elite tagma of the Hetaireia. Alexios's forces included 2,000 Turkish horse-archers, 2,000 Chomatenoi from Asia Minor, a few hundred Frankish knights from Italy, and the newly raised regiment of the Immortals, which had been created by Michael VII's chief minister Nikephoritzes and was intended to form the nucleus of a new army. Estimates of Alexios's total force vary from 5,500–6,500 (Haldon) to some 8,000–10,000 (Birkenmeier), {{but it is clear that}} <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>at</b> <b>a</b> considerable disadvantage against Bryennios; not only was his force considerably smaller, but also far less experienced than Bryennios's veterans.|$|E

5|$|Flick entered semi-professional {{baseball}} by chance. When he was 15 years old, <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>at</b> <b>a</b> {{train station}} {{to support the}} local baseball team as it left for a road trip. Only eight of the team's players {{showed up at the}} station, so Flick was recruited to go on the trip with the team. Though Flick did not have a uniform or shoes, he hit well in both games of the doubleheader, though Bedford lost both games. He joined the Bedford team on a regular basis, and he continued to play semi-pro baseball throughout his teenage years.|$|E
5|$|The {{family moved}} from Alford {{to the heart}} of London in 1605 when Anne was 15, where her father was given the {{position}} of vicar of the Church of Saint Martin's in the Vintry. Here his expression of puritan views was tolerated, though somewhat muffled, because of a shortage of pastors. Marbury took on additional work in 1608, preaching in the parish of Saint Pancras, several miles northwest of the city, travelling there by horseback twice a week. In 1610, he replaced that position with one much closer to home and became rector of Saint Margaret's on New Fish Street, only a short walk from Saint Martin in the Vintry. <b>He</b> <b>was</b> <b>at</b> <b>a</b> high point in his career, but he died suddenly at the age of 55 in February 1611, when Anne was 19 years old.|$|E
5|$|Walter {{approaches}} Alistair as {{a fellow}} man of science, who is replacing components that form a time machine that he has constructed within his body. Walter professes that Alistair's attempt to jump back several months would require {{a great deal more}} power than Alistair has predicted, possibly killing hundreds in the area near where he appears. Alistair, aware of this, recalls an empty field where <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>at,</b> <b>a</b> few blocks from where his fiancée died, and plans to use this field where only the vegetation will die out from his arrival. Walter tells Alistair how to correct the mistake that caused him to jump to the train but warns him of the other consequences that changing events will bring, explaining that stealing Peter from the parallel universe has left him wracked with regret. Despite being a man of science, Walter's torment over the years drove him to believe in a higher power, and he hopes for a sign of God's forgiveness—and thus, eventually, Peter's—in the form of a white tulip.|$|E

5|$|As a {{delegate}} for the Junta, {{he led the}} ill-fated Paraguay campaign. His troops were defeated by Bernardo de Velasco at the battles of Campichuelo and Paraguarí. Though he was defeated, the campaign initiated the {{chain of events that}} led to the Independence of Paraguay in May 1811. He retreated to the vicinity of Rosario, to fortify it against a possible royalist attack from the Eastern Band of the Uruguay River. While there, he created the flag of Argentina. The First Triumvirate did not approve the flag, but because of slow communications, Belgrano would only learn of that many weeks later, while reinforcing the Army of the North at Jujuy. There, knowing <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>at</b> <b>a</b> strategic disadvantage against the royalist armies coming from Upper Peru, Belgrano ordered the Jujuy Exodus, which evacuated the entire population of Jujuy Province to San Miguel de Tucumán. His counter-offensive at the Battle of Tucumán resulted in a key strategic victory, and it was soon followed by a complete victory over the royalist army of Pío Tristán at the Battle of Salta. However, his deeper incursions into Upper Perú led to defeats at Vilcapugio and Ayohuma, leading the Second Triumvirate to order his replacement as Commander of the Army of the North by the newly arrived José de San Martín. By then, the Asamblea del Año XIII had approved the use of Belgrano's flag as the national war flag.|$|E
25|$|Newsweek {{magazine}} {{also ran}} an investigation, {{and they said}} that most, if not all, of the charges made were groundless. Specifically, Newsweek found little evidence that the United States had transferred arms to Iran prior to Iran Contra, and was able to account for Bill Casey's whereabouts when he was allegedly at the Madrid meeting, saying that <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>at</b> <b>a</b> conference in London. Newsweek also alleged that the story was being heavily pushed within the LaRouche Movement.|$|E

25|$|In the {{epilogue}} {{the characters}} are taking Arthur to a 'quiet and idyllic planet' when they come across a half-mad journalist. He tells them that <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>at</b> <b>a</b> court case and a witness there was given {{too much of a}} truth drug and started to tell all truth, which was driving everybody there mad. They go to the courtroom in the hope of learning the question of Life, the Universe and Everything from him. They discover he is finished (there was little truth to tell) and he has forgotten it all, except that knowledge of the Ultimate Question and Ultimate Answer is mutually exclusive. He then attempts to tell Arthur where God's last message to His creation is, though dies seemingly before Arthur is able to memorise the location.|$|E
25|$|The defence {{opted for}} Einem {{to give an}} unsworn {{statement}} from the dock, rather than given sworn evidence from the witness box. In his unsworn statement, Einem detailed his alibi with what he claimed happened between 5 June and 11 July 1983. He again claimed that on 5 June he had picked up Kelvin in North Adelaide, had driven him to his home, and later had dropped him off in the Adelaide CBD. He also claimed that he was sick with the flu {{for the next week}} after that and did not return to work until 14 June. Einem was quite sketchy on his activities after that, however he did remember what he did on 10 July, the day the body was dumped on the airstrip. He said that <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>at</b> <b>a</b> relative's birthday party with his mother for most of that evening, and after dropping off a friend on the way home, had gone straight to bed and then to work the next day. He also addressed the issue of the noisy exhaust on the car heard during the abduction of Kelvin, by stating that the exhaust on his Ford Falcon (which Einem had sold on 16 July 1983, purportedly to raise money for his overseas trip) was less than two years old and in good condition. He closed his unsworn statement by again claiming his innocence.|$|E

500|$|Geneva reconsidered its {{expulsion}} of Calvin. Church attendance had dwindled {{and the political}} climate had changed; as Bern and Geneva quarrelled over land, their alliance frayed. When Cardinal Jacopo Sadoleto {{wrote a letter to}} the city council inviting Geneva to return to the Catholic faith, the council searched for an ecclesiastical authority to respond to him. At first Pierre Viret was consulted, but when he refused, the council asked Calvin. He agreed and his Responsio ad Sadoletum (Letter to Sadoleto) strongly defended Geneva's position concerning reforms in the church. On 21 September 1540 the council commissioned one of its members, Ami Perrin, to find a way to recall Calvin. An embassy reached Calvin while <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>at</b> <b>a</b> colloquy, a conference to settle religious disputes, in Worms. His reaction to the suggestion was one of horror in which he wrote, [...] "Rather would I submit to death a hundred times than to that cross on which I had to perish daily a thousand times over." ...|$|E
500|$|Heskey was {{the partner}} of Kylee Pinsent but {{left her in}} 2004 and married Chantelle (née Tagoe) in May 2014 at Rookery Hall, Cheshire.

Following the revelation of his two-year affair with Tagoe, Pinsent broke up with Heskey. He is the father of six children, three of them with former partner Pinsent and three with Tagoe. His fiancée Tagoe was held at knifepoint at their home in Hale, Greater Manchester in July 2008, while <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>at</b> <b>a</b> training session. The thieves burgled the house and stole Heskey's car but neither Tagoe, nor their two (at the time) children who were in the house, were hurt. Following this, he said Tagoe was [...] "very, very distressed" [...] by the incident. In 2009, he was rated as owning a personal fortune of £12million. Heskey {{and other members of the}} England team supported the Shoe Aid for Africa campaign in 2009, which was aimed at helping underprivileged children in Africa.|$|E

[...] your hormones start kicking in hardcore. So he’s definitely going through some stuff." [...] In another interview, he described Fenmore as [...] "trying to find his place in the world", saying: [...] "When Fen first came back, I think <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>at</b> <b>a</b> very vulnerable age and was trying to find his place in the world; just really figure out who he is.

500|$|According to CNN, {{he became}} a drug dealer and used the Bible that his {{grandmother}} gave him as a good luck charm. After being arrested for drug possession, the officer saw the Bible and let Lecrae go on a promise that he would agree to live by it. He eventually turned from drugs to alcohol consumption and a party lifestyle and became a [...] "misfit of a person." [...] He has described himself during this period as a thrill-seeker, he would pull stunts such as jumping from a third-story building, and gained the nickname [...] "Crazy 'Crae". Encouraged by his concerned mother to read his Bible, Lecrae said that [...] "I remember ripping the pages out of the Bible and throwing it on the floor. I don't want this Bible. I couldn't wrap my hands around this being true or real." [...] He began to drink and smoke more and look for more women [...] "as the emptiness became more profound." [...] At age 17, his personal, financial, and relationship troubles convinced him that <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>at</b> <b>a</b> [...] "dead end." [...] Wanting {{to do what he}} considered the mature thing, through the influence of his grandmother, he desired to start attending church. A girl Lecrae attended high school with was there, and she invited him to a Bible study, where he met Darragh, his future wife. Lecrae {{was surprised to find that}} the members of the Bible study [...] "were just people like me. [...] They read the same books and listened to the same music. Their character was just different. They were loving and that's really what drew me in." [...] Lecrae says that it was at age 19 that he finally decided to live for God, though [...] "it wasn't overnight" [...] and he [...] "spent a lot of time making bad decisions." ...|$|E
