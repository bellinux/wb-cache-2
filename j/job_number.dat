40|$|This paper {{presents}} the second version of scheduling heuristic {{to minimize the}} makespan of a reentrant flow shop with dominant characteristic at first process. The processes scheduling resembles a four machine permutation re-entrant flow shop with the process routing of M 1,M 2,M 3,M 4,M 3,M 4 in which the first process at M 1 has high tendency of exhibiting dominant characteristic. The BAM 4 is developed based on the bottleneck correction factor algorithm introduced to the makespan computation using bottleneck approach. It was shown that using bottleneckbased analysis, an effective constructive heuristic can be developed to solve for near-optimal scheduling sequence. At strong machine dominance level and medium to high <b>job</b> <b>numbers,</b> this heuristic shows slightly better makespan performance compared to the NEH.
