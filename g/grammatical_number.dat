25|$|Verbs are inflected for first-, second- {{or third}} person, and for singular, dual or plural <b>grammatical</b> <b>number.</b>|$|E
25|$|Nouns are {{classified}} according to animacy. They change according to <b>grammatical</b> <b>number</b> (singular and plural) {{but are not}} distinguished according to gender or definiteness.|$|E
25|$|Nouns are inflected {{by number}} and gender. Inflection by <b>grammatical</b> <b>number</b> (singular and plural) is clearly {{distinguished}} in feminine nouns, but not masculine nouns, where pronunciation is generally identical for those words {{ending with a}} vowel.|$|E
50|$|Tawala distinguishes three persons: first, {{second and}} third. There {{are only two}} <b>grammatical</b> <b>numbers,</b> {{singular}} and plural although first person plural makes a distinction between inclusive and exclusive.|$|R
50|$|Arabela has two <b>grammatical</b> <b>numbers,</b> {{singular}} and plural. The plural {{is generally}} added {{by adding a}} suffix to the singular, {{the nature of this}} suffix varying according to the pluralized word.|$|R
5000|$|The {{conjugation}} of Northern Sami verbs {{resembles that}} of Finnish. There are three grammatical persons (persovnnat), and three <b>grammatical</b> <b>numbers</b> (logut), singular, dual and plural. There are four or five grammatical moods (vuogit): ...|$|R
25|$|These may be {{classified}} as first person (the speaker), second person (the one spoken to), and third person (the one spoken about). They are also classified by <b>grammatical</b> <b>number,</b> i.e., singular and plural. There is no distinction between subject and object.|$|E
25|$|In the West, {{the word}} ninja became more {{prevalent}} than shinobi in the post–World War II culture, possibly {{because it was}} more comfortable for Western speakers. In English, the plural of ninja can be either unchanged as ninja, reflecting the Japanese language's lack of <b>grammatical</b> <b>number,</b> or the regular English plural ninjas.|$|E
25|$|English nouns are inflected for <b>grammatical</b> <b>number,</b> {{meaning that}} if they are of the {{countable}} type, they generally have different forms for singular and plural. This article discusses the variety of ways in which English plural nouns are formed from the corresponding singular forms, as well as various issues concerning the usage of singulars and plurals in English. For plurals of pronouns, see English personal pronouns.|$|E
50|$|There are <b>grammatical</b> <b>numbers</b> singular, and plural in Colognian. Few {{individual}} words implicitly {{have either}} singular forms only or plural forms only and cannot be marked the other, but almost all nouns exhibit either forms.|$|R
50|$|As noted above, {{within each}} person {{there are often}} {{different}} forms for different <b>grammatical</b> <b>numbers,</b> especially singular and plural. Languages which have other numbers, such as dual (e.g. Slovene), may also have distinct pronouns for these.|$|R
5000|$|Old Saxon {{also had}} three <b>{{grammatical}}</b> <b>numbers</b> ( [...] , plural, and dual) and three grammatical genders (masculine, feminine, and neuter). The dual forms {{occurred in the}} first and second persons only and referred to groups of two.|$|R
25|$|Originally, all dialects {{distinguished}} singular, dual and plural numbers, {{but some}} of the more innovative dialects, such as those of Querétaro and of the Mezquital area, distinguish only singular and plural numbers, sometimes using the previous dual forms as a paucal number. The Ixtenco dialect distinguishes singular, plural, and mass plural numbers. The personal prefixes distinguish four persons, making for a total of eleven categories of grammatical person in most dialects. The <b>grammatical</b> <b>number</b> of nouns is indicated by the use of articles; the nouns themselves are unmarked for number.|$|E
500|$|Another {{characteristic}} of Quenya reminiscent of ancient natural languages like Old Greek, Old English or Sanskrit is the dual <b>grammatical</b> <b>number</b> {{which is used}} in addition to singular and plural. It {{has been suggested that}} Tolkien used the dual to give Quenya an [...] "archaic feel" [...] in its role as an ancient language of the Elves.|$|E
2500|$|Dual as a {{distinct}} <b>grammatical</b> <b>number</b> from singular and plural ...|$|E
50|$|Characteristics of the Munda {{languages}} {{include three}} <b>grammatical</b> <b>numbers</b> (singular, dual and plural), two genders (animate and inanimate), {{a distinction between}} inclusive and exclusive first person plural pronouns {{and the use of}} suffixes or auxiliaries to indicate tense.|$|R
50|$|The Romance {{languages}} {{inherited from}} Latin two <b>grammatical</b> <b>numbers,</b> singular and plural; the only {{trace of a}} dual number comes from Latin ambō > Spanish and Portuguese ambos, Old Romanian îmbi > Romanian ambii, Old French ambe, Italian ambedue, entrambi.|$|R
50|$|Some {{languages}} {{also have}} a dual (denoting exactly two of something) or other systems of number categories. However, in English and many other languages, singular and plural are the only <b>grammatical</b> <b>numbers,</b> except for possible remnants of the dual in pronouns such as both and either.|$|R
2500|$|Definite {{articles}} {{preceding the}} noun {{are used to}} express plurality in nominal elements, since the nouns themselves are invariant for <b>grammatical</b> <b>number.</b> Most dialects have rʌ 'the (singular)' and yʌ 'the (dual/plural)'. Example noun phrases: ...|$|E
2500|$|The full {{numbering}} adjectives in Greek are inflectional for {{grammatical gender}} (ie. there is monos , mone [...] and monon [...] ), grammatical case (ie. nominative, genitive etc.) and <b>grammatical</b> <b>number</b> (singular/plural). The prefixes are produced from the default grammatical type (masculine/nominative/singular).|$|E
2500|$|If a noun is {{preceded by}} a number {{composed}} {{of more than one}} distinct part, the last part determines the <b>grammatical</b> <b>number.</b> 1001 Nat (literally [...] "1001 Night") and to en halv time (literally [...] "two and a half hour") use singular nouns, whereas English would use [...] "nights" [...] and [...] "hours".|$|E
5000|$|The {{grammar of}} Old Saxon was fully inflected with five {{grammatical}} cases (nominative, accusative, genitive, dative, and instrumental), three <b>grammatical</b> <b>numbers</b> ( [...] , plural, and dual) and three grammatical genders (masculine, feminine, and neuter). The dual forms {{occurred in the}} first and second persons only and referred to groups of two.|$|R
50|$|Although other Eskimo {{languages}} {{know more}} than the familiar two <b>grammatical</b> <b>numbers</b> (by having also dual), Sireniki uses only singular and plural, thus it lacks dual. As mentioned, Sireniki is peculiar in this aspect not only among Eskimo languages, {{but even in the}} entire Eskimo-Aleut language family, even its neighboring Siberian Yupik relatives have dual.|$|R
50|$|Unlike Hindi, Odia retains most of {{the cases}} of Sanskrit, though the {{nominative}} and vocative have merged (both without a separate marker), as have the accusative and dative. There are three genders (masculine, feminine and neuter) and two <b>grammatical</b> <b>numbers</b> (singular and plural). There are three true tenses (present, past and future), others being formed with auxiliaries.|$|R
2500|$|When the pronoun is {{to act as}} {{the subject}} of the {{relative}} clause, [...] is generally used, though as before, [...] may be used instead for greater precision. (This is less common than the use of [...] with direct objects, however, since verbs in French often reflect the <b>grammatical</b> <b>number</b> of their subjects.) ...|$|E
2500|$|Nouns are {{classified}} into two grammatical genders ("masculine" [...] and [...] "feminine") and are inflected for <b>grammatical</b> <b>number</b> (singular or plural). Adjectives and determiners (articles, demonstratives, possessives, and quantifiers) must be inflected {{to agree with}} the noun in gender and number. Many nouns can take diminutive or augmentative suffixes to express size, endearment, or deprecation.|$|E
2500|$|The {{variants}} neger and negar, {{derive from}} the Spanish and Portuguese word [...] (black), and from the now-pejorative French nègre (negro). Etymologically, negro, noir, nègre, and nigger ultimately derive from nigrum, the stem of the Latin [...] (black) (pronounced [...] which, in every other grammatical case, grammatical gender, and <b>grammatical</b> <b>number</b> besides nominative masculine singular, is nigr-, the r is trilled).|$|E
5|$|Verbal endings convey {{information}} about <b>grammatical</b> person, <b>number</b> and voice. The imperative mood {{has its own}} set of endings.|$|R
2500|$|Attributive {{adjectives}} {{are placed}} before the noun they describe, and change their ending {{according to the}} <b>grammatical</b> gender, <b>number,</b> and case: ...|$|R
50|$|In the Russian language, {{the system}} of {{grammatical}} declension is elaborate and complex. Nouns, pronouns, adjectives, demonstratives, most numerals and other particles are declined for two <b>grammatical</b> <b>numbers</b> (singular and plural), three grammatical genders (masculine, feminine and neuter) and six grammatical cases (see below). This gives dozens of spelling combinations {{for most of the}} words, which is needed for grammatical agreement within and (often) outside the proposition. Also, there are several paradigms for each declension with numerous irregular forms.|$|R
2500|$|Klingon nouns take suffixes to {{indicate}} <b>grammatical</b> <b>number.</b> There are three noun classes, {{two levels of}} deixis, and a possession and syntactic function. In all, twenty-nine noun suffixes from five classes may be employed: jupoypu’na’wI’vaD [...] "for my beloved true friends". A word may carry {{no more than one}} suffix from each class, and the classes have a specific order of appearance.|$|E
2500|$|While Sindarin {{does not}} have a {{grammatical}} gender, it has just like Welsh two systems of <b>grammatical</b> <b>number.</b> [...] Singular/plural nouns correspond to the singular/plural number system just as of English. Sindarin noun plurals are unpredictable and formed in several ways. If Tolkien did not provide us with the plural form of a Sindarin (or Noldorin) noun we have no certain way of inferring it.|$|E
2500|$|The [...] "structure-centered" [...] {{approach}} {{starts with}} a language's structural peculiarity and examines its possible ramifications for thought and behavior. The defining example is Whorf's observation of discrepancies between the grammar of time expressions in Hopi and English. More recent research in this vein is Lucy's research describing how usage of the categories of <b>grammatical</b> <b>number</b> and of numeral classifiers in the Mayan language Yucatec result in Mayan speakers classifying objects according to material rather than to shape as preferred by English speakers.|$|E
5000|$|There {{are four}} <b>grammatical</b> <b>numbers</b> in High Valyrian — singular, plural, paucal and {{collective}}. For example, vala [...] "man" [...] (nom. sing.); vali [...] "men" [...] (nom. pl.); valun [...] "some men" [...] (nom. pau.); valar [...] "all men" [...] (nom. coll.). The collective can itself be modified by number {{as a new}} noun declension, for example azantys [...] "knight, soldier" [...] (nom. sing.) → azantyr [...] "army" [...] (nom. coll.); azantyr [...] "army" [...] (nom. sing.) → azantyri [...] "armies" [...] (nom. pl.).|$|R
50|$|Nouns are {{not usually}} marked for <b>grammatical</b> gender or <b>number.</b>|$|R
50|$|Dutch verbs {{conjugate}} for tense {{in present}} and past, and for mood in indicative, subjunctive and imperative. The subjunctive mood in Dutch is archaic or formal, and is rarely used. There are two <b>grammatical</b> <b>numbers</b> (singular and plural) and three grammatical persons. However, many forms are identical to others, so the conjugation doesn't have distinct forms for all possible combinations {{of these factors}} (that is, there is considerable syncretism). In particular, there is always just one form for the plural, and only in the present indicative is there a clear distinction among the different singular persons.|$|R
