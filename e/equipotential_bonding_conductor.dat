40|$|The {{purpose of}} this project is to analyze {{earthing}} systems for houses. By practical measurements and theoretical analyzes consequences of possible faults, that can occur within the facility and in the low-voltage distribution network, is illustrated.    The reason for this project is that nowadays one has to arrange with a main <b>equipotential</b> <b>bonding</b> system for buildings. Apart from that, if necessary, bathrooms must be provided with a supplementary <b>equipotential</b> <b>bonding</b> system. The practical measurements verify that potential differences in facilities {{may be due to}} voltage drops in the PEN conductor between the origin of the electrical installation and the power transformer. Based on the theoretical analyzes of possible faults, it is considered that the requirement for  supplementary <b>equipotential</b> <b>bonding</b> systems for bathrooms in most cases can be questioned, when basic insulation, fault protection, residual current devise and main <b>equipotential</b> <b>bonding</b> system already provides an adequate level of protection. A PEN conductor loss may result in a situation where metallic parts attached to the <b>equipotential</b> <b>bonding</b> system starts working as earth electrodes. <b>Equipotential</b> <b>bonding</b> system may also increase the incidence of stray currents. If TN-C-S systems is provided with a local connection to earth a redundant system against PEN conductor loss is obtained. That is not the case for neutral conductor loss in TN-S systems with a local connection to earth. If district heating pipes is supplied with insulated flanges it prevents stray currents and foreign potential to be spread in the district heating network...|$|R

50|$|<b>Equipotential</b> <b>bonding</b> {{involves}} joining together metalwork that is {{or may be}} earthed {{so that it is}} at {{the same}} potential (i.e., voltage) everywhere. Such is commonly used under transformer banks by power companies and under large computer installations.

It is also done in bathrooms where all exposed metal that leaves the bathroom including metal pipes and the earths of electrical circuits must be bonded together to ensure that they are always at the same potential. Isolated metal objects, including metal fittings fed by plastic pipe, are not required to be bonded. In Australia and South Africa, a house's earth cables must be connected both to an earthing rod driven into the ground and also to the plumbing or gas pipe.In Australia a house's earth cable must be connected to all reinforcing mesh in any concrete under any bathroom and in any swimming pool.|$|R

40|$|International (IEC) European (CENELEC) and American (NEC) Standards require, in each building, the {{connection}} of extraneous conductive parts (i. e. metal water or gas pipes) to the main grounding terminal. There are two good reasons for this: the voltage between extraneous conductive parts and exposed conductive parts is zeroed and extraneous conductive parts {{can contribute to the}} leakage of fault current into the ground. There is however a third advantage in the bonding connection: the entire structure (floors and walls of the building), together with the exposed and the extraneous metallic parts, forms a quasi-equipotential system, with the consequent strong reduction of touch voltages. Metallic pipes and reinforcement of reinforced concrete have a particular relevance thanks to their large widespread through buildings. However, in some practical cases, {{it is not possible to}} connect all extraneous conductive parts to the protective <b>equipotential</b> <b>bonding</b> because they are not accessible. In the paper, the reduction of touch voltages in buildings, when these extraneous conductive parts are present but not connected to the protective <b>equipotential</b> <b>bonding</b> is quantified. Different building models are created and solved by the finite element method in order to calculate touch voltages in different scenarios. The results show that the mere presence of widespread metallic parts in buildings helps to reduce touch voltages, but not enough to ensure safety against indirect contacts. The electrical installation safety performance is greatly improved in reinforced concrete buildings if at least some easily accessible parts, like water or central heating pipes, are connected to the main grounding terminal. Also in brick buildings, they provide a certain reduction of GPR, maximum and mean touch voltages...|$|R

50|$|Some {{types of}} metal conduit may {{also serve as}} a useful <b>bonding</b> <b>conductor</b> for {{grounding}} (earthing), but wiring regulations may also dictate workmanship standards or supplemental means of grounding for certain types.

25|$|Equipment <b>bonding</b> <b>conductors</b> {{provide a}} low {{impedance}} path between normally non-current-carrying metallic parts of equipment and one of the conductors of that electrical system's source. If any exposed metal part should become energized (fault), such as by a frayed or damaged conductor, it creates a short circuit, causing the overprotection device (circuit breaker or fuse) to open, clearing (disconnecting) the fault. It is important to note this action occurs regardless of whether there is a connection to the physical ground (earth); the earth itself has no role in this fault-clearing process since current must return to its source; however, the sources are very frequently connected to the physical ground (earth). (see Kirchhoff's circuit laws). By bonding (interconnecting) all exposed non-current carrying metal objects together and to other metallic objects such as pipes or structural steel, they should remain near the same voltage potential, thus reducing the chance of a shock. This is especially important in bathrooms where one may be in contact with several different metallic systems such as supply and drain pipes and appliance frames. When a system needs to be connected to the physical ground (earth), the equipment <b>bonding</b> <b>conductor</b> also becomes the equipment earthing conductor (see above).|$|R

The results and observation show that most of the damages reported due to the indirect lightning flashes, power line surges and step voltage in the event of lightning strike to the tower. The property damages such as patches and cracks developed in their walls and floors, the damages to electrical and electronic equipment such as electrical switch gears, bulbs, socket outlets, televisions, and radios also reported.

In one case, the victims were sleeping on floor in his home which is located around 40 m away from the tower and also the altitude is low with compared to the tower ground level. In another case the victims were sitting on the chair with legs on the ground in his home which is located around 30 m away from the tower and also the altitude is low with compared to the tower ground level.
