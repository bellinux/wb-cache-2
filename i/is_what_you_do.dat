500|$|Robinson {{once told}} future Hall of Fame inductee Hank Aaron that [...] "the game of {{baseball}} is great, but the greatest thing <b>is</b> <b>what</b> <b>you</b> <b>do</b> after your career is over." [...] Robinson retired from baseball at age 37 on January 5, 1957. Later that year, after he complained of numerous physical ailments, his doctors diagnosed him with diabetes, a disease that also afflicted his brothers. Although Robinson adopted an insulin injection regimen, the state {{of medicine at the}} time could not prevent the continued deterioration of Robinson's physical condition from the disease.|$|E
500|$|A {{few weeks}} before the {{official}} music video's release in November 2003, Madonna's manager Caresse Henry confirmed video plans for [...] "Love Profusion". It was directed by Luc Besson and shot on September 2003, at Warner Bros. Studios in Burbank, California. Besson later directed Madonna in the 2007 animated film Arthur and the Invisibles. [...] "There are a lot of special effects. I talked to things that weren't there – which <b>is</b> <b>what</b> <b>you</b> <b>do</b> when you're doing green-screen or blue-screen stuff. There's {{going to be a lot}} of fairies dancing around me. Isn't that exciting? I always have a lot of fairies dancing around me", Madonna commented about the music video. The video premiered in the US on February 11, 2004 on AOL's First View. After the premiere, it was streamed on Yahoo!, MSN, Windows Media, Apple, MTV, VH1, iFilm and Madonna.com.|$|E
500|$|Actress and dancer Zoë Lister {{was cast}} {{in the role of}} Zoe. On 8 June 2009, media {{entertainment}} website Digital Spy revealed that Lister had quit the soap and would leave {{towards the end of the}} year. Speaking of her decision to quit, Lister stated: [...] "It's scary but also very, very exciting. I think three years in a soap is enough to do and you get to a point where you either make a decision that this <b>is</b> <b>what</b> <b>you</b> <b>do</b> or you want to try something different." [...] She also revealed that she had been planning to leave the series one year prior to announcement. Lister's decision to quit matched that of co-star Loui Batley (Sarah Barnes). Hollyoaks officially announced on 23 July 2009 that both Lister and Batley would leave towards the end of the year in a storyline that would see [...] "A tragic curtain call for one of them", later revealing that either Sarah or Zoe would be killed off in a dramatic storyline. Lister also revealed in an interview with Heat magazine that she was [...] "nervous", but [...] "very excited" [...] about leaving the show.|$|E

500|$|Although Primus was {{a regular}} member of Perrin's team {{at the end of}} the 2004–05 season and captained the side on {{occasions}} during pre-season, he rarely featured until Perrin's sacking in November. The return of Harry Redknapp, who had been won over by his performances and was now one of his biggest admirers, to Portsmouth lead to Primus' immediate return to the side, and he was ever present in the side that achieved Premiership survival in the last 10 games of the season. Primus remained a regular in the Portsmouth defence for the 2006–07 season, partnering England international Sol Campbell in the centre of defence, and Redknapp hailed him as the unofficial Player of the Season; the official winner of the award was David James. He failed to make an appearance in 2007–08 due to a career threatening knee injury. He was treated with surgery performed by Dr. Richard Steadman who is known to have saved the careers of many footballers, including Alan Shearer and Ronaldo. After the operation, Primus commented [...] "The difference between success and failure <b>is</b> <b>what</b> <b>you</b> <b>do</b> afterwards in your rehabilitation, not necessarily the actual operation." [...] Despite his injury, he still managed to earn a new one-year deal at Portsmouth in May 2008.|$|E

40|$|Humans {{aspire to}} be {{rational}} beings, but our feelings often drive us more than logic does.

And besides, I feel that the exercise of freedom, activity, foresight, daring, independent self- determination, even in a few minutes' burst across country, strengthens me in mind as well as in body. It might not do so to you; but you are of a different constitution, and, from all I see, the power of a man's muscles, the excitability of his nerves, the shape and balance of his brain, make him what he is.

One does not need two glances at your face to know that you would not enjoy fox-hunting, that you would enjoy book-learning and [...] "refined repose," [...] as they are pleased to call it. Every man carries his character in his brain.
