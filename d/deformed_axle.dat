50|$|The {{specific}} {{manner or}} way {{by which a}} failure occurs in terms of failure of the item (being a part or (sub) system) function under investigation; it may generally describe the way the failure occurs. It shall at least clearly describe a (end) failure state of the item (or function {{in case of a}} Functional FMEA) under consideration. It {{is the result of the}} failure mechanism (cause of the failure mode). For example; a fully fractured axle, a <b>deformed</b> <b>axle</b> or a fully open or fully closed electrical contact are each a separate failure mode of a DFMEA, they would not be failure modes of a PFMEA. Here you examine your process, so process step x - insert drill bit, the failure mode would be insert wrong drill bit, the effect of this is too big a hole or too small a hold.|$|E
