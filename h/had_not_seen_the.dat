5|$|Jaguar's {{marketing}} department had allocated space on their {{stand at the}} motor show for the XJ220, but <b>had</b> <b>not</b> <b>seen</b> <b>the</b> vehicle until its arrival. Jaguar chairman John Egan and Roger Putnam, {{who was in charge}} of Jaguar's racing activities, were shown the vehicle the week before the motor show and signed off on the concept, allowing its unveiling. The car received an overwhelmingly positive reception by public and press, and a number of wealthy Jaguar enthusiasts handed over blank cheques to secure a purchase option should the XJ220 concept go into production. Ferrari's display of their F40 model at the same event was overshadowed; an estimated 90,000 additional visitors came to see the Jaguar XJ220.|$|E
5|$|Wright's {{adaptation}} {{failed to}} have the same cultural impact as the 1995 serial and has since attracted sharply-divided opinions. However, even three years after the release, Knightley was still associated with Elizabeth Bennet among a generation of young viewers who <b>had</b> <b>not</b> <b>seen</b> <b>the</b> 1995 production. Given the varied opinions about the film, JASNA published an edited special issue of its online journal Persuasions On-Line in 2007 with the collaboration of nineteen Austen scholars from six countries; the intent was to foster discussion and stimulate scholarly analysis. JASNA had done this only once before, for the 1996 film Emma.|$|E
5|$|Fischer {{lived for}} a time in Japan. On July 13, 2004, acting in {{response}} to a letter from U.S. officials, Japanese immigration authorities arrested him at Narita International Airport near Tokyo for allegedly using a revoked U.S. passport while trying to board a Japan Airlines flight to Ninoy Aquino International Airport in Manila, Philippines. Fischer resisted arrest, and claimed to have sustained bruises, cuts and a broken tooth in the process. At the time, Fischer had a passport (originally issued in 1997 and updated in 2003 to add more pages) that, according to U.S. officials, had been revoked in November 2003 due to his outstanding arrest-warrant for the Yugoslavia sanctions violation. Despite the outstanding arrest-warrant in the U.S., Fischer said that he believed the passport was still valid. The authorities held Fischer at a custody center for 16 days before transferring him to another facility. Fischer claimed that his cell was windowless and he <b>had</b> <b>not</b> <b>seen</b> <b>the</b> light of day during that period, and that the staff had ignored his complaints about constant tobacco smoke in his cell.|$|E

5|$|On {{the morning}} of 13 October, Warren sighted two of the French frigates {{standing}} out of Donegal Bay and went after them, directing Moore in Melampus to stay behind to search for stragglers. Hindered by contrary winds, Melampus scoured the bay until well after nightfall, and at 23:30 {{was surprised by the}} sudden appearance directly in front of her of Immortalité and Résolue near St. John's Point. Immortalité soon spotted Melampus and made sail, but Captain Bargeau of Résolue <b>had</b> <b>not</b> <b>seen</b> <b>the</b> British ship, and was hesitant about following his compatriot in the dark. In the gloom and confusion, he mistook Melampus for Immortalité and came alongside, only realising his mistake when Melampus opened fire. Because of the heavy seas, Résolues guns had been tied down below decks, so the only return fire she could offer was from her handful of quarterdeck guns. Bargeau, whose ship was still leaking badly, recognised that further resistance was futile and surrendered in minutes, having lost ten men and much of his rigging. Melampus put aboard a prize crew and then departed in pursuit of Immortalité.|$|E
5|$|Confusion reigned {{over just}} what {{experiments}} had been conducted. Pusztai had mentioned {{two lines of}} genetically modified potatoes, meaning the two GNA lines, and this was reported by the media. The Rowett institute mistakenly assumed the media {{was talking about a}} second line transformed with concanavalin A (ConA), a Jack Bean lectin that is toxic to mammals. Transgenic ConA Potatoes had been developed, but had never been tested. Two press releases issued by the Rowett Institute on the 10th and 11th praised Pusztai's research and supported increased safety tests on genetically modified food. The press releases also said that the potatoes were modified with ConA, adding to the confusion. Pusztai claimed that he <b>had</b> <b>not</b> <b>seen</b> <b>the</b> press releases before they went out and had no opportunity to correct the mistake. James says that he drafted it and Pusztai rewrote one section, but did not see the final copy. The mistaken belief that the ConA gene was inserted into the potato led scientist Sir Robert May and Agricultural Minister Jack Cunningham to release statements to the media saying that the findings were not surprising, as a known poison had been added to the potato. Some scientists still dismiss Pusztai's work over this error.|$|E
5|$|In 2002, {{straight}} {{after finishing}} Cold Feet, Bathurst went straight into filming My Dad's the Prime Minister, a series {{in which he}} portrays fictional British prime minister Michael Philips. The first series was broadcast in a Sunday afternoon CBBC slot in 2003. He watched debates in the House of Commons {{to prepare for the}} role but did not base his portrayal on Tony Blair. In 2003, he returned to theatre {{for the first time in}} four years to play Vershinin in The Three Sisters, opposite Kristin Scott Thomas and Eric Sykes. He <b>had</b> <b>not</b> <b>seen</b> <b>The</b> Three Sisters before starring in it. Director Michael Blakemore advised him to turn this to his advantage, as he would not feel he had to live up to previous portrayals. After its run concluded, a special edition of The Three Sisters was filmed with the same cast for television broadcast on BBC Four. In 2005, the second series of My Dad's the Prime Minister was broadcast, now moved to a Friday night time slot to take advantage of the adult humour. The same year, he starred in the ITV thriller The Stepfather playing Christopher Veazey, a man whose daughter goes missing. Bathurst was pleased that this white-collar worker had an emotional side, in comparison to David Marsden, whom he used as a yardstick when accepting those sorts of roles. Also in 2005, he played Mr Sesseman in an adaptation of Heidi and Dottore Massimo in The Thief Lord.|$|E

5|$|On the July 24 Impact Wrestling, Hardy {{told the}} {{audience}} that we <b>had</b> <b>not</b> <b>seen</b> <b>the</b> last of Willow and then brought out Matt Hardy, his brother, to reform The Hardys. The Wolves joined them in the ring and challenged them to a match for the TNA World Tag Team Championship at , which the Hardys agreed to. At Destination X, the Hardys lost against the Wolves, but shook hands after the match. On October 22, 2014, The Hardys entered a number one contenders tournament for the TNA World Tag Team Championships defeating The BroMans (Jessie Godderz and DJ Z) {{in the first round}} of the tournament. On October 29, episode of Impact Wrestling, The Hardys defeated Team Dixie (EC3 and Tyrus) in the semifinals to advance to the finals of the tournament where they defeated Samoa Joe and Low Ki to become number one contenders for the TNA World Tag Team Championship. On the January 7 episode of Impact Wrestling, Hardy along with his brother Matt were at ringside for The Wolves vs. James Storm and Abyss; during the match, The Great Sanada and Manik attempted to interfere in the match, but then ended up receiving a Side Effect from Matt Hardy, and a Twist of Fate from Jeff Hardy. Despite that, it distracted Eddie Edwards, who then received a Last Call super kick from Storm. At the Lockdown episode of Impact Wrestling, Hardy suffered a minor concussion which was set as a storyline injury when he fell on the door of the cage; James Storm hit Hardy off the door onto the steel steps below with a cowbell. The falling off the cage spot was covered in mainstream media such as USA Today and TMZ. Hardy returned after TNA United Kingdom tour. In March, The Hardys participated in a tournament for the vacant TNA World Tag Team Championship. On March 16, 2015, The Hardys won an Ultimate X match for the belts for the first time as a team and individually. On May 8, 2015, the Hardys were forced to vacate the TNA World Tag Team Championship due to Jeff suffering a broken leg in a legitimate dirt bike accident.|$|E
