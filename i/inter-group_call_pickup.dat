For each of the proposed methods I have made use of my own experiences with guitar pickup, laser harp function, MIDI controller capabilities, and the properties of electret microphones. Most of the methods are ones that I developed and tested in practice, some of which I am still working on and will include in my subsequent Bachelor’s thesis...|$|R

40|$|Abstract—Investigating {{passenger}} {{demand is}} essential for the taxicab business. Existing solutions are typically based on dated and inaccurate offline data collected by manual investigations. To address this issue, we propose Dmodel, using roving taxi-cabs as real-time mobile sensors to (i) infer passenger arriving moments by interactions of vacant taxicabs, and (ii) infer pas-senger demand by a customized online training with both historical and real-time data. Such huge taxicab data (almost 1 TB per year) pose a big data challenge. To address this chal-lenge, Dmodel employs a novel parameter <b>called</b> <b>pickup</b> pattern (accounts for various real-world logical information, e. g., bad weather) to increase the inference accuracy. We evalu-ate Dmodel with a real-world 450 GB dataset of 14, 000 taxicabs, and results show that compared to the ground truth, Dmodel achieves a 76 % accuracy on the demand inference and outperforms a statistical model by 39 %.

Our work focuses on the appointment making process which is most of the time carried out by auxiliary nurses of the gynecology and obstretric department. Generally, these auxiliary nurses have only a few minutes to collect information from expectant mothers, to identify the risk level of the pregnancy, and to make an appointment with the relevant and available practitioner. Two main difficulties have been identified in this process: the <b>call</b> <b>pickup</b> rate and errors in making appointment. These two difficulties have become for us two principal areas for improving the service quality given to patients.
