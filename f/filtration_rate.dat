5|$|Studies to {{quantify}} this theory {{have shown that}} there is an overall decreased systemic vascular resistance in hepatorenal syndrome, but that the measured femoral and kidney fractions of cardiac output are respectively increased and reduced, suggesting that splanchnic vasodilation is implicated in the kidney failure. Many vasoactive chemicals have been hypothesized as being involved in mediating the systemic hemodynamic changes, including atrial natriuretic factor, prostacyclin, thromboxane A2, and endotoxin. In addition to this, it has been observed that the administration of medications to counteract splanchnic vasodilation (such as ornipressin, terlipressin, and octreotide) leads to improvement in glomerular <b>filtration</b> <b>rate</b> (which is a quantitative measure of kidney function) in patients with hepatorenal syndrome, providing further evidence that splanchnic vasodilation is a key feature of its pathogenesis.|$|E
5|$|Rhabdomyolysis {{may cause}} kidney failure by several mechanisms. The most {{important}} is the accumulation of myoglobin in the kidney tubules. Normally, the blood protein haptoglobin binds circulating myoglobin and other heme-containing substances, but in rhabdomyolysis the quantity of myoglobin exceeds the binding capacity of haptoglobin. Myoglobinuria, the presence of myoglobin in the urine, occurs when the level in plasma exceeds 0.5–1.5mg/dl; once plasma levels reach 100mg/dl, the concentration in the urine becomes sufficient {{for it to be}} visibly discolored and corresponds with the destruction of about 200grams of muscle. As the kidneys reabsorb more water from the , myoglobin interacts with Tamm–Horsfall protein in the nephron to form casts (solid aggregates) that obstruct the normal flow of fluid; the condition is worsened further by high levels of uric acid and acidification of the filtrate, which increase cast formation. Iron released from the heme generates reactive oxygen species, damaging the kidney cells. In addition to the myoglobinuria, two other mechanisms contribute to kidney impairment: low blood pressure leads to constriction of the blood vessels and therefore a relative lack of blood flow to the kidney, and finally uric acid may form crystals in the tubules of the kidneys, causing obstruction. Together, these processes lead to acute tubular necrosis, the destruction of the cells of tubules. Glomerular <b>filtration</b> <b>rate</b> falls and the kidney is unable to perform its normal excretory functions. This causes disruption of electrolyte regulation, leading to a further rise in potassium levels, and interferes with vitamin D processing, further worsening the low calcium levels.|$|E

40|$|Various {{aspects of}} the feeding ecology of {{zooplankton}} are described for hypertrophic Hartbeespoort Dam, where the phytoplankton {{is dominated by the}} cyanophyte Microcystis. The study considers zooplankton succession, community grazing <b>rates,</b> and speciesspecific <b>filtration</b> <b>rates</b> on Microaystis colonies and natural bacterioplankton. Seasonal abundance of the main herbivorous zooplankton between 1981 and 1986 is described both in respect of biomass and specific densities. In situ community grazing rates were measured from January 1983 to March 1985 using 14 C-Iabelled Chlorella. Zooplankton succession and community grazing rates are examined in relation to food quantity and quality. Experiments measuring species-specific <b>filtration</b> <b>rates</b> on labelled Chlorella and Microcystis colony fractions revealed low <b>filtration</b> <b>rates</b> for small-bodied cladoceran species on cyanophyte colonies. Daphnia fed significantly on Microcystis colonies up to 60 - 100). μm but Daphnia <b>filtration</b> <b>rates</b> on Chlorella were suppressed by ~ 707. during the mid-summer increase in Microcystis abundance. <b>Filtration</b> <b>rates</b> of small cladoceran species were not suppressed by MicpocystisJ which was not an important food resource. Cladoceran filtration rate:body length models were developed for Chlorella and Microcystis colony fractions as food. Multiple regression models explained variance in <b>filtration</b> <b>rates</b> on these foods as a function of body length, food type and size, grazer species and temperature (in order of significance). Inclusion of food quality factors such as cyanophyte colony size seems justified in models of plankton feeding in eutrophic or hypertrophic lakes. Methods for in situ measurement of zooplankton <b>filtration</b> <b>rates</b> on 'H-thymidine-Iabelled natural bacteria were improved for use under hypertrophic conditions, and associated isotope-adsorption errors were measured. Community, species-specific and length-specific <b>filtration</b> <b>rates</b> on bacterioplankton were measured (late-spring to late-summer 1986 - 87). Ceriodaphnia exhibited no preference for bacteria or Chlorella. Other cladocerans preferred the algal food. Algal/bacterial selectivity coefficients of the zooplankton community revealed an increased algal preference following the mid-summer shift to phytoplankton dominance by largely inedible Microcystis. This implies that bacterioplankton is not an important food resource for the summer cladoceran community. Estimates of the contribution of bacterial carbon to the daily zooplankton carbon requirements are low. The implications of all results are discussed in relation to seasonal succession, the clear-water phase', and biomanipulation in this hypertrophic reservoir...|$|R
40|$|Introduced Pacific oysters Crassostrea gigas have {{expanded}} {{rapidly in the}} Dutch Oosterschelde estuary, while stocks of native bivalves declined slightly. As a consequence, total filtration pressure increased significantly, which may affect the mortality of bivalve larvae. Better escape abilities in Pacific oyster larvae might be a contributing factor to their rapid geographic expansion. To study whether C gigas larvae are filtered less than larvae of native bivalves, we investigated filtration and ingestion of the larvae of the native Mytilus edulis and introduced C. gigas by the adults of C gigas and M. edulis {{as well as the}} native Cerastoderma edule. We measured <b>filtration</b> <b>rates</b> of C gigas and M. edulis larvae by the adult bivalves (C gigas, M. edulis and C. edule), and compared these to <b>filtration</b> <b>rates</b> of algae. Additionally, we studied the fate of filtered larvae. All three adult species filtered both C gigas and M. edulis larvae. M. edulis larvae were filtered by all three bivalve species with the same <b>filtration</b> <b>rates</b> as algae, whereas <b>filtration</b> <b>rates</b> of C gigas larvae were roughly 50 % lower than <b>filtration</b> <b>rates</b> of algae. This suggests that C. gigas larvae can somehow reduce their filtration risk, whereas larvae of M. edulis cannot. The majority of filtered C. gigas and M. edulis larvae were ingested.

40|$|A novel {{fermentation}} unit comprising an axial microfilter for cell retention {{was evaluated}} for continuous-flow aerobic cultivations of a yeast, bacterium and fungus. Performance {{characteristics such as}} <b>filtration</b> <b>rates</b> and cell accumulation were assessed {{as a function of}} filter rotational speed, operating pressure, cultivation time and microfilter type (i. e., membrane or porous metallic).

Yeast (S. cerevisiae) and bacterial (E. coli) cell concentrations were enhanced by as much as 16 -fold and 8 -fold over ordinary batch growth, respectively. Concomitant <b>filtration</b> <b>rates</b> were stable over operating times of up to 130 h, and thus were independent of cell concentration.

The effect of climate change was taken into consideration by measuring the chlorophyll A concentration at current average lake temperatures and temperatures adjusted for climate change predictions.

40|$|Climate {{change and}} water {{extraction}} {{may result in}} increased exposition of the biota to ultraviolet-B radiation (UVB) in high-altitude Andean lakes. Although exposition to lethal doses in these lakes is unlikely, sub-lethal UVB doses may have strong impacts in key compartments such as zooplankton. Here, we aimed at determining the effect of sub-lethal UVB doses on <b>filtration</b> <b>rates</b> of two cladoceran species (Daphnia pulicaria and Ceriodaphnia dubia). We firstly estimated the Incipient Limiting Concentration (ILC) and the Gut Passage Time (GPT) for both species.
