25|$|UMTRI {{houses the}} Center for National Truck and Bus Statistics. For many years, {{it has worked}} collaboratively with FMCSA and NHTSA to {{maintain}} the Trucks Involved in Fatal Accidents (TIFA) and Buses Involved in Fatal Accidents (BIFA) databases. Starting with cases identified in the Fatality Analysis Reporting System (FARS) (the U.S. national database of road traffic fatalities based on police crash reports), UMTRI researchers collect detailed data on vehicle configuration, cargo type, hours of driving, and other variables. In addition, TIFA and BIFA data collection protocols are easily adapted to address <b>emerging</b> <b>issues.</b> Other strengths of the UMTRI program include vehicle engineering, crash avoidance systems such as collision warning systems and stability control, biomechanics, and risk factors such as distraction, fatigue, and medical conditions.|$|E
25|$|Due to Southern Italy's lack of {{progress}} to bettering the area, it has {{a record number of}} emigration. This mentality stems from the sad truth that many who are native to Southern Italy find it more beneficial to emigrate rather than stay in the area and try to push for reforms. The most prevalent issue in Southern Italy is its inability to attract businesses and therefore create jobs. Between 2007 and 2014 943,000 Italians were unemployed. Of this, 70% were Italians from the South. Employment in the South is ranked the lowest compared to countries in the European Union. The <b>emerging</b> <b>issues</b> discourage living in Southern Italy as even obtaining a job in the area is close to impossible. Naturally, Italians from the South are also ranked the lowest in terms of money contributed into the economy of the Italy from immigrants. The most common jobs in Southern Italy lie in tourism, distribution, food industries, wood furniture, whole sale, vehicle sales, sales in mineral and artisan. As evident in the list of the most common jobs in Southern Italy, the economy of the South heavily relies on tourism. It attracts tourists through its rich historical background. One example of this is Rome, {{one of the most prominent}} and advanced ancient civilizations.|$|E
