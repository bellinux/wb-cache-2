Skinner had given up academia, thanks at least in part to Wittgenstein's influence, and had been working as a mechanic in 1939, with Kirk as his apprentice. Kirk and Wittgenstein struck up a friendship, with Wittgenstein giving him lessons in physics to help him pass a City and Guilds exam. During his period of loneliness at Guy's he wrote in his diary: [...] "For ten days I've heard nothing more from K, even though <b>I</b> <b>pressed</b> him a week ago for news. I think that he has perhaps broken with me. A tragic thought!" [...] Kirk had in fact got married, and they never saw one another again.|$|E
2500|$|On 15 November, Dibaba won the Zevenheuvelenloop 15 {{kilometres}} {{road race}} in Nijmegen, Netherlands {{in a world}} best time of 46:28. This bettered Kayoko Fukushi's previous world best by almost half a minute. (Dibaba's record was broken by Florence Kiplagat on 15 February 2015.) This was her first competitive road race since 2005, but she downplayed the idea of moving on to road running, stating that the track remained her priority. Her 5 kilometre splits were 15:58 – 15:25 – 15:05. She said, [...] "Although I trained a lot together with my husband for this race, a roadrace is something different. I {{did not know what}} I could expect. Therefore, I was not that fast in the beginning. ... After 10 kilometres, <b>I</b> <b>pressed</b> the pace and in the final three kilometres it felt like flying. It feels good as you hear after the finish that your husband also has won." ...|$|E
2500|$|In 1295 France and Scotland {{enter the}} Treaty of Paris, agreeing to mutual support in face of {{conflict}} with England, and subsequently termed the ‘Auld Alliance.’ Edward I {{tried to raise}} forces to pursue further war with France, but [...] Bohun and other earls resisted this goal. In March 1297 Parliament was held at Salisbury, and Edward <b>I</b> <b>pressed</b> the issue, but events in Scotland changed his direction. As fighting broke out again, William Wallace sacked Lanark Castle in May 1297. On 5 August 1297 the King provided John Devereux with letters of protection {{for the next year}} while he is on the king’s service overseas. William Wallace defeated the English at Stirling Bridge on 11 September 1297. Devereux gathered with the army for Edward I’s invasion of Scotland, and was probably present at the Battle of Falkirk. On 7 June 1300 John Devereux, son of Nicholas Devereux, was granted Letters of Protection while serving in Scotland under John de Usflete. John de Usflete was the husband of Lora, daughter and coheir of Gerard de Furnivale. On 21 November 1301 John Devereux, yeoman, was granted letters of protection along with Nicholas le Archer who were staying on the king’s service in Scotland.|$|E

2500|$|Star Wars: Masters of Teräs Käsi {{received}} {{mixed reviews}} from critics. It ranked 10th in ScrewAttack's Top 10 Worst Fighting Games. In the book , author Rob Smith said the game {{served as a}} reminder that [...] "simply attaching the Star Wars name to a game wasn't enough.". Smith did note that despite this Teräs Käsi did have successful sales during the 1997 holiday season. In March 2004, GMR placed Masters of Teräs Käsi in its top five Star Wars game of all time. GameSpot's Jeff Gerstman felt that the game played like it was [...] "stuck in slow motion". He cited sluggish movement, uninteresting combos and unbalanced characters as weak points within the game. Adam Douglas of IGN also responded similarly. Of the controls he said [...] "I ended up mashing the buttons more than one time hoping the harder <b>I</b> <b>pressed</b> the quicker they’d respond. No such luck." [...] Kotaku's Patrick Klepek echoed these statements and further added that the game lacked depth. His colleague Luke Plunket called Masters of Teräs Käsi [...] "possibly the worst Star Wars game ever made." [...] Plunkett felt that it was a wasted opportunity. It was [...] "something that could have been worthwhile" [...] he said.|$|E
2500|$|Also {{important}} {{to the theme of}} family dissolution is Act 2, Scene 5, where a father unwittingly kills his son, and a son unwittingly kills his father. Stuart Hampton-Reeves argues that this scene is a symbolic one referring to the conscription debate in England during the 1580s and 1590s. The Dutch Revolt against the Spanish Empire had begun in 1568, and although England and France were both supporting the Dutch, they had officially remained neutral for fear of angering the Spanish. However, in 1585, Elizabeth I signed the Treaty of Nonsuch, which officially brought England into the conflict, with the promise of 6,500 troops (which was then changed to 8,000 troops) for the Dutch. As such, to supply these troops, mobilisation was needed and the government thus replaced the traditional feudal system, whereby local nobles raised armies from among their own tenantry, with national conscription. This was not without controversy, and the incident involving the fathers and sons allude to both practices; the feudal system and the national system. Upon discovering he has killed his father, the son laments [...] "From London by the king was <b>I</b> <b>pressed</b> forth./My father, being the Earl of Warwick's man,/Came on the part of York, pressed by his master" [...] (2.5.64–66). The son had left the family home and travelled to London, where he had been conscripted into the king's army upon the outbreak of war. The father had stayed at home and had been compelled to join the army of the local noble (i.e. Warwick). Thus they ended up on opposite sides in the conflict, as regional stability gives way to national discord and social breakdown, and the war begins quite literally to tear families apart.|$|E
