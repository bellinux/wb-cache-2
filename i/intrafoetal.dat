40|$|Transuterine <b>intrafoetal</b> {{injections}} of foreign spleen cells {{were made in}} 13 and eight sheep foetuses at 60 and 70 - 90 days of pregnancy r spectively. Nine of the 21 injected foetuses survived to full term. Only one of the 17 operated ewes aborted. Foetal resorption was known to have followed the injection in two ewes examined post mortem, and was assumed to have occurred in six others. The causes and effects of this foetal wastage are discussed...|$|E
40|$|The {{concentrations}} of 6 -oxo-prostaglandin F 1 =a 6 -oxo-PGF 1 =a have been determined in maternal and foetal plasma from nine chronically catheterized sheep during late pregnancy and parturition. Labour occurred either spontaneously (three sheep) or was induced by continuous <b>intrafoetal</b> infusion of Synacthen (ACTH 1 =n- 4; 0 =. 4 mg/ 24 h; three sheep) or dexamethasone (1 mg/ 24 h; three sheep). During spontaneous and Synacthen-induced parturition, {{concentrations of}} 6 -oxo-PGF 1 =a∈ maternal and foetal plasma remained at basal levels until 24 h before delivery. At varying {{times during the}} 24 h before delivery, levels of 6 -oxo-PGF 1 =a∈ maternal and foetal plasma were generally increased. When parturition was induced with dexamethasone, however, no increase was observed in the foetal plasma although the concentration of 6 -oxo-PGF 1 =a∈ maternal plasma was raised close to delivery...|$|E
40|$|Summary. -Canine {{melanoma}} {{has been}} transplanted to allogeneic neonatal recipients receiving continuous immunosuppression with anti-lymphocyte serum. One spontaneous melanoma was directly transplanted into 8 recipients, 6 of which developed tumours. 5 / 5 melanoma cell cultures were transplantable, with 19 tumour takes in 31 allogeneic recipients. Serial passage {{was performed in}} the case of two melanomas. Tumour development required continuous immunosuppression and the site was dependent upon the route of inoculation and other factors. Transplanted cell cultures were all amelanotic in vitro and in vivo, except {{in the case of}} one melano-ma which reverted to a melanotic morphology after in vivo growth. CANINE spontaneous neoplasms have been infrequently transplanted, and success rates were low when irradiation or drug immunosuppression were employed (Allam et al., 1954; Nielsen and Cole, 1961; Moldovanu et al., 1966). <b>Intrafoetal</b> inoculation or immunosuppression with antilymphocyte serum (ALS) have yielded better results with canine osteosarcom...|$|E
40|$|Summary Lymphoid {{tissue from}} 43 cases of canine {{lymphosarcoma}} and from 40 clinically normal dogs {{have been examined}} for markers of retrovirus infection. From 69 - 76 % of culture supernatants from lymphosarcomas were shown to contain particles of retroviral density and to possess poly rC-oligo dG templated polymerase (reverse transcriptase) activity compared with 17 - 24 % of culture supernatants from normal canine lymphoid cells. In 6 culture supernatants from cases of lymphosarcoma, high molecular weight 60 - 70 S RNA was detected and shown {{to be found in}} association with this particulate reverse transcriptase activity. No such RNA was detected in 6 culture supernatants from normal canine lymphoid cells. Lymphosarcoma {{is one of the most}} common malignancies found in the dog, with a reported incidence of 20 per 105 adult dogs (Jarrett et al., 1966). The tumours can be transplanted by <b>intrafoetal</b> inoculation of unrelated canines with tumour cells (Owen & Neilson, 1968), the malignancies becoming apparent in the puppie...|$|E
40|$|Aim. To {{analyze the}} {{formation}} and reactivity of the intermediate part (marginal tranzitional zone) of joint capsule using lectinhistochemistry. Methods and results. Hip joint of laboratory rats was as an object for present investigation. Method of <b>intrafoetal</b> antigen injection has been taken as а pattern in order to study the reactivity of above-mentioned zone. Fragments of hip joints were fixed in picroformol, decalcinated and dehydrated. We used a standard set of lectins, conjugated with horseradish peroxidase for lectinhistochemistry. In the intermediate part, we distinguished regio superficialis and regio profunda. The intensity of expression for lectin receptors in regio superficialis was always {{higher than in the}} parietal part of the joint capsule. The intermediate part is distinguishable from the surrounding tissues as early as on the 1 st day, meanwhile regio superficialis and regio profunda are discernible from each other only on the 7 th day. The intermediate part formation is associated with a decrease in the expression of lectin receptors in regio superficialis and an increase in the content of galactose-, mannose- and glycoconjugates in regio profunda occurring from the 14 th day. Changes are more pronounced in regio profunda in comparison with regio superficialis and consist in their premature development, which is accompanied by early expression {{of a large number of}} galactoseconjugates in regio profunda on the 7 th day, with a subsequent decrease in galactose – and mannose saturation in it and appearance of significant L-fucose residues amount. Conclusions. Antigenic effect leads to tension in immuno-biological relationship between articular cartilage and joint capsule and following reactive processes affecting lectin receptors glycosylation of intermediate part. Premature glycosylation of regio profunda is aimed on the early formation of the intermediate part of joint capsule having the lectin-mediated barrier, preventing excessive invasion of the joint capsule into the articular cartilage. ...|$|E
