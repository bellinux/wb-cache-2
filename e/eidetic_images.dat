50|$|Though {{spontaneous}} and repeatable like an eidetic, when the daydream does not progress independently on its own, {{it is not}} an eidetic. However, daydreams have easily been confused with <b>eidetic</b> <b>images</b> because, as Allport recognized, spontaneous images of fantasy can be <b>eidetic</b> <b>images</b> if they are of a perceptual character and have a healthy orientation. This healthy orientation is what distinguishes an eidetic from a daydream. Only daydreams being of the healthful and releasing type are eidetic, while negative daydreams go against the nature of the eidetic in not being healthy and restorative.|$|E
5000|$|In a {{more general}} context, the eidetic {{can be defined as}} a normal {{subjective}} visual image experienced with noticeable vividness whether evoked by an actual external object or not. The <b>eidetic</b> <b>image</b> is not dependent on any prior experience, condition, state, or event. The <b>eidetic</b> <b>image</b> is “seen” within the mind or literally seen externally. In seeing an <b>eidetic</b> <b>image,</b> definite somatic events as well as a feeling of meaning are also present. American psychologist Gordon Willard Allport formulated a similar definition and emphasized the “healthful” structure of the eidetic by stating “definition should be understood to exclude both pathological hallucinations and dream images, and to admit those spontaneous images of phantasy which, though possessed of perceptual character, cannot be said to be literally revivals or restorations of any specific perception.” (Allport, 1924, p. 100) ...|$|R
40|$|In {{this paper}} I explore the <b>eidetic</b> <b>image</b> {{as it relates}} to the {{rethinking}} and imaging of architectural and urban planning concerns. An <b>eidetic</b> <b>image</b> is produced through drawing, painting, modeling, mapping, and/or computer animation from which artists, designers and architects may conduct research into complex spatiality that challenges the passive Cartesian mode of picturing prevalent in both architecture and painting conventions. The term eidetic generally refers to mental imagery, “which are revived versions of [...] impressions called up by the imagination in the absence of the objects that originally stimulated them [...] . ” (Mitchell, Iconology 10). Which is not to say that all eidetic imagery must be recalled from memory. Within the context of this paper, an <b>eidetic</b> <b>image</b> is a visual model constructed by an artist, or designer. In his essay, “Eidetic Operations and New Landscapes” landscape architect James Corner calls on researchers to use this imaging methodology as a means of stimulating discourse, creative invention, and actualizing emergent realities. In his seminal work, “The Image of the City” Kevin Lynch categorizes the contents of the imageable city into five types of architectural components: paths, edges, districts, nodes, and landmarks (46). A summary of what those components are and how they function within the urban-landscape will be provided. In addition to Lynch’s five categories, I address the phenomena of pictorial architecture. Pictorial architecture refers to the ubiquitous application of two-dimensional graphic imagery onto three-dimensional architectural structures in the form of retail signage, large-format television screens, and billboards. The thesis of my proposal is that, an artist, designer or architect may use the operational language of Lynch’s five architectural components, and pictorial architecture, within eidetic imagery, as a means of describing the contemporary urban-landscape. To elaborate how architectural components may be deployed in eidetic imagery I will review the works of contemporary artists such as Zaha Hadid, Benjamin Edwards, and Julie Mehretu who specifically deal with the urban-landscape. In addition, I have constructed my own <b>eidetic</b> <b>image,</b> Dream City: Vancouver (2008) and will describe my methodological approach towards urban exploration and image building. In relation to the exploration of cities, the works of The Situationist International and Franz Ackermann will also be discussed. Personal, noncommercial use of this item is permitted...|$|R
5000|$|In Klüver's words, [...] "the <b>Eidetic</b> <b>Image</b> {{has been}} {{identified}} in psychological literature as a vision, {{as a source for}} new thought and feeling, as a material picture in the mind which can be scanned by the person as he would scan a real current event in his environment, and as a potent, highly significant stimulus which arises from within the mind and throws it into a series of self-revealing imagery effects" [...] (Klüver, 1932; Richardson, 1969; Ahsen, 1977).|$|R
50|$|The {{popular culture}} concept of “photographic memory,” where (e.g.) someone can briefly {{look at a}} page of text and then recite it {{perfectly}} from memory, {{is not the same}} as seeing <b>eidetic</b> <b>images,</b> and photographic memory has never been demonstrated to exist.|$|E
50|$|Psychologist E.R Jaensch {{states that}} eidetic memory apart of visual {{thinking}} {{has to do}} with <b>eidetic</b> <b>images</b> fading between the line of the after image and the memory image. A fine relationship may exist between the after image and the memory image, which causes visual thinkers from not seeing the eidetic image but rather drawing upon perception and useful information. Individuals diagnosed with agnosia, {{may not be able to}} perform mental reasoning.|$|E
50|$|An eidetic {{image is}} a type of vivid mental image, not {{necessarily}} derived from an actual external event or memory. It was identified {{in the early twentieth century}} as a distinct phenomenon by psychologists including E.R. Jaensch, Heinrich Klüver, Gordon Allport and Frederic Bartlett. Later, Akhter Ahsen located eidetic imagery in a structuralist context, and explored its therapeutic applications: psychotherapists sometimes encourage their clients to create and explore <b>eidetic</b> <b>images</b> as a way of coming to terms with past life events. Eidetic imagery has also been studied in relation to the creative arts.|$|E
50|$|The {{distinction}} between the <b>eidetic</b> <b>image</b> and the imagination also applies to the term “active imagination”. The eidetic responds to natural precision in consciousness but does not react well to “active imaginal handling which, most often, leads to distortion through memory channels.” The original Jungian term “active imagination” (Jung, 1954), which then lead to the derivations of Assagioli’s “psychosynthesis” and Virel’s “directed daydream,” differs from the eidetic process in that the eidetic arises from alert consciousness rather than when consciousness is dimmed or is controlled.|$|R
50|$|The eidetic being central {{gives it}} special status {{as it relates}} to Emmert's law, which states that the size of the image varies proportionately with the {{distance}} of the projection ground from the eye. The after-image follows the law most faithfully, the memory image does not follow it at all, and the <b>eidetic</b> <b>image</b> falls in between; i.e., it follows and does not follow Emmert's law. In general, however, the eidetic resembles the after-image more than the memory image in respect to this characteristic.|$|R
50|$|As to {{determining}} {{the key to}} the criteria for distinctions, some theorists emphasize the study of the after-image while others the memory image and still others the <b>eidetic</b> <b>image.</b> The <b>eidetic</b> <b>image</b> is favored as the key because it shares some attributes with the other two. To demonstrate this positioning of the EI sharing attributes, consider the following example. If one watches a color television picture and then turns the eye quickly away from the screen, a brief positive after-image (AI) of the original picture lingers. This AI travels with the eye and is not subject to voluntary control or recall. The eidetic (EI) of the original TV picture, once obtained, can be seen for a few minutes or even as long as several hours so it, too, has the lingering sensory quality of the positive after-image. While the memory image (MI) of the original TV picture being a conscious attempt of recall, it does not have the sensory quality of AI or EI. However, the MI can be seen {{for a long period of}} time like EI. Therefore, sharing qualities of the other two while also being independent of them, the EI is placed in intermediate position between AI and MI.|$|R
50|$|According to Ahsen’s {{research}} on imagery, {{which took place}} after the Second World War over a fifteen-year period prior to {{the publication of his}} first book in 1965, the type of image that repeatedly emerged as capable of resolving significant family or social issues had the same qualities as the eidetic described by the Marburg school. In 1977, after having tested and applied the concepts and techniques of eidetics in the experimental as well as clinical setting, Ahsen distinguished between structural eidetics (<b>eidetic</b> <b>images</b> based on the individual’s personal history and the changes he could cause in them) and typographic eidetics (an exact reproduction of the presented picture under laboratory conditions).|$|E
50|$|In {{more recent}} {{uses of the}} term, vivid memory images have been {{described}} as <b>eidetic</b> <b>images</b> (Horowitz, 1970, p. 22), “an exceptionally vivid memory image that occurs immediately after the perception” (Hebb, 1972, p. 242), “the ability possessed by a minority of people to ‘see’ an image that is an exact copy of the original sensory experience” (Kagan & Havemann, 1972, p. 588), the “half-way house to hallucination” (Drever, 1964, p. 80). Other treatments include that of Leask, Haber, and Haber, who describe the eidetic as “a visual image, representing a previously scanned stimulus, persisting for up to several minutes, and phenomenally located in front of the eyes” (p. 25).|$|E
50|$|In {{addition}} to poetry and short stories, Miller wrote four novels. The Race for Home (Dial, 1968) has a South Texas setting. Surviving Joy (Donald I. Fine, 1995) concerns {{a young boy}} named Dub Johnson in Depression-era Houston. His other novels are Liv (Dial,1973) and The Skook (Warner Books, 1984), about a spelunker confronting a cave creature {{who may or may}} not be from his own imagination. In what was the first use of a hologram on a book cover, the Skook was sketched by Miller and then sculpted by <b>Eidetic</b> <b>Images,</b> Inc., an American Bank Note subsidiary. Warner Books paid $6000 for the hologram elements, part of a $50,000 publicity campaign.|$|E
50|$|Due to {{the sensory}} {{deprivation}} and isolation research, {{there is a}} better understanding that during sensory deprivation and isolation the mind sometimes generates ideas or images that, under certain pathological conditions, appear as full-fledged hallucinations. (Campbell, 1930; Perot & Penfield, 1960; Goldberger & Holt, 1961; Fisher, 1962; Klüver, 1962; Solomon & Mendelson, 1962; Horowitz, 1964; Zuckerman & Cohen, 1964; Maclndoe & Singer, 1966) The spontaneity of the appearance of the hallucination is similar to the spontaneity of the appearance of an <b>eidetic</b> <b>image,</b> but again, as also mentioned as to the distinction between a daydream and an eidetic, the eidetic progresses toward the healthy restitution of natural order while the hallucination does not.|$|R
50|$|Kasiṇa {{meditation}} is {{a concentration}} meditation (variously known in different traditions as samatha, dhyana, or jhāna meditations), intended {{to settle the}} mind of the practitioner and create a foundation for further practices of meditation. In the early stages of kasiṇa meditation, a physical object is used as the object of meditation, being focused upon by the practitioner until an <b>eidetic</b> <b>image</b> of the object forms in the practitioner's mind. In more advanced levels of kasiṇa meditation, only a mental image of the kasiṇa is used as an object of meditation. Unlike the breath, Buddhist tradition indicates that some kasiṇa are not appropriate objects for certain higher levels of meditation, nor for meditation of the vipassana (insight) type.|$|R
5000|$|Due to the {{flexibility}} of the eidetic, it has often been confused with imagination in that while experiencing an eidetic, an individual can maneuver the image to perform meaningful actions. But as Allport pointed out, “The range of flexibility is very great indeed, but it does not extend to include the ridiculous or unnatural.” Most people can use their imagination to make any ridiculous change in their imagination <b>image,</b> but the <b>eidetic</b> <b>image</b> alters only in a natural direction and, therefore, the eidetic is not unlimited in its alterability like an image of imagination. (See also comments on Ahsen’s concept of the eidetic in Wolpe, 1969, p. 233; Lazarus, 1971, p. 226; Singer, 1974, p. 134 [...] )however, the above theory of eidetic excluding unnatural or ridiculous might be contradicted by the concept of memory palace.|$|R
5000|$|... "Eidetikers", {{as those}} who possess this ability are called, report a vivid afterimage that lingers in the visual field with their eyes {{appearing}} to scan across the image as it is described. Contrary to ordinary mental imagery, <b>eidetic</b> <b>images</b> are externally projected, experienced as [...] "out there" [...] {{rather than in the}} mind. Vividness and stability of the image begins to fade within minutes after the removal of the visual stimulus. Lilienfeld et al. stated, [...] "People with eidetic memory can supposedly hold a visual image in their mind with such clarity that they can describe it perfectly or almost perfectly ..., just as we can describe the details of a painting immediately in front of us with near perfect accuracy." ...|$|E

40|$|Two {{groups of}} Children {{took part in}} this {{longitudinal}} study of eidetic imagery (ED. The New Haven sample consisted of 12 elementary school children, and the Rochester sample consisted of 23 children (aged 7 to 11 years {{at the beginning of}} the study). The study was designed to find out some of the qualities of EI and its relationship to memory. An <b>eidetic</b> <b>image</b> was defined as a long-lasting visual image of a figure localized in space in front of the subject. positive in color, and usually on the place where the original figure was shown. The image persists after the stimulus is gone. Subjects were shown pictures one at a time for a brief period and asked to comment on each picture once it had been removed.

40|$|Honey bees (Apis mellifera, worker) {{were trained}} to {{discriminate}} between two random gratings oriented perpendicularly to each other. This task was quickly learned with vertical, horizontal, and oblique gratings. After being trained on perpendicularly-oriented random gratings, bees could discriminate between other perpendicularly-oriented patterns (black bars, white bars, thin lines, edges, spatial sinusoids, broken bars) as well. Several tests indicate that the stimuli were not discriminated {{on the basis of}} a literal <b>image</b> (<b>eidetic</b> template), but, rather, on the basis of orientation as a single parameter. An attempt to train bees to discriminate between two different random gratings oriented in the same direction was not successful, also indicating that the bees were not able to form a template of random gratings. Preliminary experiments with oriented 'Kanizsa rectangles' (analogue of Kanizsa triangle) suggest that edge detection in the bee may involve mechanisms similar to those that lead to the percept of illusory contours in humans. ...|$|R
40|$|The {{paper has}} been fully {{published}} on the cd {{that is part of}} the conference proceedings. The paper 1 is positioned within an ongoing Ph. D through designing. The process through which ‘to dream’ (architectural invention) connects with ‘to make’ (construction practice) is the research subject of this Ph. D. The description of consecutive steps that lead to the appropriate research paradigm introduces the paper and situates the research method of the case. The described case focuses on ‘to dream’ as one component of the Ph. D subject, in which the designing researcher aims for a deeper understanding of the mechanisms of ‘to dream’, in order to apply it with more accuracy in design processes. Images of eidetic moments that built the spatial intelligence (Van Schaïk, 2008) of the architectural designer are one channel to trigger ‘to dream’.

40|$|The {{complexity}} of behaviour necessitates {{a clear and}} concise approach in order to comprehend its functioning. An example of such an approach is highlighted by the field of cybernetics. Cybernetic models have been used extensively throughout the various fields of Psychology but perhaps never more so {{as in the case}} of short term memory (STM). This particular field abounds with behavioural models and research workers are constantly developing new models or testing the unviversality of existing models. Universal validity is essential to the strength of the behavioural principles inherent in any model but unfortunately such validity tends to be neglected. The present study attempts to reconcile this position with reference to specific models of STM, with relation to the phenomena of eidetic imagery (EI). Certain studies concerning the incidence of EI in illiterate Africans have produced results which are contradictory to those obtained in the Western culture. Two of the most important contradictions concern the fact that the illiterate Africans experienced the absence of an age parameter on the occurrence of such imagery and the fact that the incidence of imagery was more extensive in the African culture. A reason for these contradictions was sought and it was reasoned that as <b>eidetic</b> <b>images</b> have been closely linked with memory images, it may, therefore, be assumed that these particular cultures may use EI as an aid to memory in the absence of written material. Further, it would not be unreasonable to assume that this visual imagery may tend to dominate the STM process and thereby challenge the universality of those memory models that proposed acoustic domination of this process. No work has been done in investigating the memory process of the Africans. Thus, a study which did so would not only test the universality of specific memory models but would also possibly throw more light on the memory process itself. In this particular study there were three specific aims; (a) to ascertain the relative incidence of EI on a cross-cultural level, (b) to assess the influence of EI on the memory process, and (c) to ascertain the extent to which principles of STM developed in the West applied to the African groups. The groups concerned in the study comprised two Xhosa groups and a European group. The European group (WS) was drawn from a White Student population at Rhodes University and was regarded as a control group. The equivalent literate Xhosa group (BS) was drawn from a Black Student population at the University of Fort Hare. The illiterate Xhosa group (RX) was drawn from a population of Red Xhosa people in the Transkei. Four tasks were administered to the groups with the cross-cultural variable carefully controlled as much as possible. The following comprised the four tasks; (a) eidetic imagery (b) auditory serial recall (c) visual serial recall and (d) an acoustic confusable task. Each subject commenced with the eidetic imagery task and was then confronted with a random presentation of the other three tasks. The EI task began with an after image task which was foIlowed by three selected pictures which comprised the EI task. After each picture presentation the subject was closely questioned as to the presence of imagery. Scoring was of a subjective nature. The visual and acoustic confusion tasks constituted serial presentation of ten items over six randomized trials. Each item was presented for 0, 75 seconds with a negligible inter-item interval. The presentation order of the items was randomized throughout the trials. Presentation was by means of a preprogrammed 16 mm colour film. Items were scored for correct serial position. The auditory task consisted of the serial presentation of ten items over six randomized trials. The items were once again randomized throughout the trials with regards to presentation order. The presentation speed was one word per second. The presentation was by means of a pre-programmed tape. Items were scored for correct serial position. The visual task was common to both language groups whilst the other two tasks correIated with the language group. Thus, the items in the auditory and acoustic confusion tasks were different for each language but an attempt was made to control this variable. The tasks were conducted in the subjects home languagc which was either Xhosa or English. It was assumed that the RX group would demonstrate a greater incidence of EI, irrespective of the age of the subject, and that imagery would be reflected in the recall performance of the memory tasks. It was suggested that imagery may determine or encourage the mode of storage that the subject cmployed, which, in this case, would be the visual modality. If so then it would be expected that visual storage would circumvent the detrimental influence of acoustic confusability. The Xhosa university group (BS) was an unknown quantity but was included to ascertain whether there were any marked differences between the group and the other two. The results revealed that imagery was in fact more prevalent in the Xhosa groups whilst the WS group demonstrated a complete lack of EI but did report the presence of pictorial imagery (PI). However, imagery did not appear to function as an aid to memory. It seemed, however, that in certain instances it correlated with visual encoding. Generally the Xhosa subjects, especially with regards to the visual tasks, tended to encode visually whilst the WS group encoded auditorily. With reference to recall performance, it was found that in all instances the WS group demonstrated superior recall followed by the BS and RX groups in that order. There was a significant difference in the strength of recall between each of the groups. The results of the auditory and visual tasks were interpreted within the STM principles developed in the West. It was found that the WS group adhered to these principles thereby justifying its position as a central group. The BS group followed a similar pattern with exception to the recency effect which was much weaker in their case. The RX group reported the absence of any storage and rehearsal strategies and this was reflected in their poor recall performance. They too were characterized by a very weak recency effect. The interesting point arose, however, when the auditory and visual recency effects were compared. According to Crawder and Norton (1969) the influence or the precategorical acoustic store (PAS) on recall should be reflected by a comparatively stronger auditory recency effect. This trend was observed in relation to the WS group but not to the Xhosa groups who tended to demonstrate a stronger visual recency effect. It was therefore, suspected that PAS did not operate with the same effectiveness with the Xhosa subjects. In fact it was suggested that in the case of the Xhosa subjects the visual peripheral store may be stronger than PAS. Contrary to expectation all three groups exhibited acoustic confusion. This was expected of the WS group as the subjects preferred auditory storage, but not of the Xhosa subjects who preferred visual storage. It was suggested however, that in the case of the Xhosa subjects the visual storage technique would have to be abandoned immediately prior to or during recall as recall was necessarily in the auditory modality. The outcome of the experiment generally confirmed Doab's conclusions as to the incidence of imagery and its relation with memory. However, due to the Xhosa preference for visual storage and their stronger visual recency effect, Sperling's model was slightly modified. Conrad 's findings were, of course, substantiated.
