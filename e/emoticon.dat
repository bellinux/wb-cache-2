25|$|<b>Emoticon</b> - Scott Fahlman, a Carnegie Mellon professor, {{created the}} first <b>emoticon.</b>|$|E
25|$|This {{character}} {{resembles a}} face (two eyes {{and an open}} mouth); and is often used as an <b>emoticon</b> to show disbelief or surprise.|$|E
25|$|As {{computers}} offer increasing {{built-in support}} for non-Western writing systems, {{it has become}} possible to use other glyphs to build emoticons. The 'shrug' <b>emoticon,</b> ¯\_(ツ)_/¯, uses the glyph ツ from the Japanese katakana writing system.|$|E
40|$|<b>Emoticons</b> (e. g., :) and :() {{have been}} widely used in {{sentiment}} analysis and other NLP tasks as features to ma- chine learning algorithms or as entries of sentiment lexicons. In this paper, we argue that while <b>emoticons</b> are strong and common signals of sentiment expression on social media the relationship between <b>emoticons</b> and sentiment polarity are not always clear. Thus, any algorithm that deals with sentiment polarity should take <b>emoticons</b> into account but extreme cau- tion should be exercised in which <b>emoticons</b> to depend on. First, to demonstrate the prevalence of <b>emoticons</b> on social media, we analyzed the frequency of <b>emoticons</b> in a large re- cent Twitter data set. Then we carried out four analyses {{to examine the relationship between}} <b>emoticons</b> and sentiment polarity as well as the contexts in which <b>emoticons</b> are used. The first analysis surveyed a group of participants for their perceived sentiment polarity of the most frequent <b>emoticons.</b> The second analysis examined clustering of words and emoti- cons to better understand the meaning conveyed by the emoti- cons. The third analysis compared the sentiment polarity of microblog posts before and after <b>emoticons</b> were removed from the text. The last analysis tested the hypothesis that removing <b>emoticons</b> from text hurts sentiment classification by training two machine learning models with and without <b>emoticons</b> in the text respectively. The results confirms the arguments that: 1) a few <b>emoticons</b> are strong and reliable signals of sentiment polarity and one should take advantage of them in any senti- ment analysis; 2) a large group of the <b>emoticons</b> conveys com- plicated sentiment hence they should be treated with extreme caution...|$|R
2500|$|Exposure to both Western and Japanese style <b>emoticons</b> or kaomoji through blogs, instant messaging, and forums {{featuring}} {{a blend of}} Western and Japanese pop culture {{has given rise to}} many <b>emoticons</b> that have an upright viewing format. [...] The parentheses are often dropped, and these <b>emoticons</b> typically only use alphanumeric characters and the most commonly used English punctuation marks. <b>Emoticons</b> such as -O-, -3-, -w-, '_',_;, T_T, :>, and [...]V. are used to convey mixed emotions that are more difficult to convey with traditional <b>emoticons.</b> Characters are sometimes added to <b>emoticons</b> to convey an anime- or manga-styled sweat drop, for example ^_^', !>_ ...|$|R
25|$|<b>Emoticons</b> are {{commonly}} created with diacritic symbols, especially Japanese <b>emoticons</b> on popular imageboards.|$|R
25|$|The rise of cuteness in Japanese culture {{emerged in}} the 1970s {{as part of a}} new style of writing. Many teenage girls began to write {{laterally}} using mechanical pencils. These pencils produced very fine lines, as opposed to traditional Japanese writing that varied in thickness and was vertical. The girls would also write in big, round characters and they added little pictures to their writing, such as hearts, stars, <b>emoticon</b> faces, and letters of the Latin alphabet.|$|E
25|$|KDE4.1 was {{released}} on 29 July 2008. KDE4.1 includes a shared <b>emoticon</b> theming system which is used in PIM and Kopete, and DXS, a service that lets applications download and install data from the Internet with one click. Also introduced are GStreamer, QuickTime 7, and DirectShow 9 Phonon backends. Plasma improvements include support for Qt4 widgets and WebKit integration – allowing many Apple Dashboard widgets to be displayed. There will also be ports of some applications to Windows and Mac OS X.|$|E
25|$|An <b>emoticon</b> or smiley is {{a symbol}} or {{combination}} of symbols used to convey emotional content in written or message form. Forums implement a system through which some of the text representations of an emoticons (e.g. xD, :p) are rendered as a small image. Depending on {{what part of the}} world the forum's topic originates (since most forums are international) smilies can be replaced by other forms of similar graphics, an example would be kaoani (e.g. *(^O^)*, (^-^)b), or even text between special symbols (e.g. :blink:, :idea:).|$|E
50|$|Filetopia FX {{features}} {{a very powerful}} graphic chat, which integrates security features, file sharing, file search, a graphic and searchable log system, hundreds of <b>emoticons</b> and ability for the user to add their own <b>emoticons,</b> even animated ones and capture the <b>emoticons</b> used by others.|$|R
40|$|Do {{people of}} {{different}} cultures agree on the meaning and use of <b>emoticons?</b> This study addresses this question from an inter-cultural perspective and explores the use of <b>emoticons</b> in the American and Chinese Computer-mediated communication (CMC) communities. The research indicates that both the Americans and Chinese participants use <b>emoticons</b> for entertaining, informational and social interaction motivations but the Americans {{are more likely to}} use <b>emoticons</b> for information motivations than the Chinese and the Chinese participants are more likely to use <b>emoticons</b> for social interactions than the Americans participants. The results correspond to the cultural differences between the two countries in low-/ high-context and individualism/collectivism dimensions. Moreover, the results also show that the Americans and the Chinese disagree on the meaning of most <b>emoticons</b> used in the study...|$|R

500|$|Yotoriyama {{announced}} Necrid {{early in}} Soulcalibur IIs production for the Xbox, {{in an interview}} with the Japanese [...] magazine Famitsu. Text in each version of the game's box art also drew attention to Necrid. Namco later featured the character in promotional items, such as artwork, screenshots, and an animated <b>emoticon,</b> which they distributed to IGN and other news outlets. McFarlane Productions distributed one thousand copies of a limited-edition lithograph to promote the character at E3 2003. Drawn by Greg Capullo, the lithograph featured a comic-book rendition of Necrid, fighting Spawn in one of the game's arenas. In August 2003, Namco included a sculpture of Necrid in a set of five based on different Soulcalibur II characters. The figure was based on Necrid's secondary outfit, stood [...] tall (with a base), and allowed for adjustment of its head and arms. McFarlane Productions later gave the sculptures and copies of the game as prizes in a contest named after the character.|$|E
2500|$|An <b>emoticon</b> ( [...] , , rarely {{pronounced}} [...] ) is a pictorial {{representation of}} a facial expression using punctuation marks, numbers and letters, usually written to express a person's feelings or mood.|$|E
50|$|Users {{can express}} their {{feelings}} with <b>emoticons</b> and actions. There are numerous <b>emoticons,</b> {{such as a}} happy face, a sad face, angry, etc. The <b>emoticons</b> appear above the avatar's head in a speech bubble.

50|$|<b>Emoticons</b> {{may be used}} {{to express}} a wider range of responses, usually {{expressed}} by non-verbal communication: for example to soften negative statements, or to express enthusiastic approval or humour (Bell & Zaitseva, 2005) http://www.wwwords.co.uk/pdf/viewpdf.asp?j=elea&vol=2&issue=4&year=2005&article=4_Bell_ELEA_2_4_web&id=146.87.255.19. On the other hand, <b>emoticons</b> may be perceived as childish, or notappropriate in formal education. <b>Emoticons</b> are routinely available in chat rooms and forums in the public domain, but are not currently embedded in every VLE. For example, Moodle has <b>emoticons</b> but they are not available in current versions of Blackboard.|$|R

2500|$|An {{equal sign}} {{is often used}} for the eyes {{in place of the}} colon, seen as =), without {{changing}} the meaning of the <b>emoticon.</b> In these instances, the hyphen is almost always either omitted or, occasionally, replaced with an [...] "o" [...] as in =O) [...] In most circles it has become acceptable to omit the hyphen, whether a colon or an equal sign is used for the eyes, but in some areas of usage people still prefer the larger, more traditional <b>emoticon</b> :-) or :^). One linguistic study has indicated that the use of a nose in an <b>emoticon</b> {{may be related to the}} user's age. Similar-looking characters are commonly substituted for one another: for instance, o, O, and 0 can all be used interchangeably, sometimes for subtly different effect or, in some cases, one type of character may look better in a certain font and therefore be preferred over another. It is also common for the user to replace the rounded brackets used for the mouth with other, similar brackets, such as ] instead of [...] ).|$|E
2500|$|Etymologist Eric Partridge and the Oxford English Dictionary {{believe the}} term {{comes from the}} now {{obsolete}} typographical sequence of a colon and a dash; [...] This typography, using a dash following a colon, was used to introduce a list.

[...] In 1997, Nicolas created {{hundreds}} of <b>emoticons,</b> including a 3D smiley logo. [...] Some sources incorrectly claim that Nicolas {{was the first to}} create portrait-orientation <b>emoticons,</b> but various prior usage of portrait-format <b>emoticons</b> dates back to as early as 1972. His images, registered with the United States Copyright Office in 1997, were first published as GIF files on the internet in 1998, making them the first graphical <b>emoticons</b> used in technology. [...] He launched the SmileyWorld brand shortly thereafter. In the early 2000s, the company licensed the rights to their <b>emoticons</b> to telecom companies, including Nokia, Motorola, Samsung, amongst others. Nicolas Loufrani compiled his graphical <b>emoticons,</b> along with other existing images used for communication, into an online dictionary which was divided into categories, and by 2002, the dictionary included over 3,000 images.|$|R

2500|$|In Western countries, emoticons {{are usually}} written at {{a right angle}} to the {{direction}} of the text. Users from Japan popularized a kind of <b>emoticon</b> called kaomoji ( [...] ; lit. 顔(kao)=face, 文字(moji)=character(s); often confused with emoji in the West) that can be understood without tilting one's head to the left. This style arose on ASCII NET of Japan in 1986.|$|E

5000|$|While text-based {{communication}} eliminates {{audio and}} visual cues, {{there are other}} methods for adding emotion. <b>Emoticons,</b> or emotional icons, {{can be used to}} display various types of emotions. Similar to emotional displays in face-to-face communication, it was found that females tend to use more <b>emoticons</b> than their male counterparts. [...] Beyond simply using <b>emoticons,</b> in virtual communication platforms, people tend to capitalize letters or words to add emphasis to speaking.|$|R
5000|$|Emojis which {{originated}} in Japan and later {{spread to other}} parts of Asia have now become mainstream in Western societies. Eastern <b>emoticons</b> particularly Japanese <b>emoticons</b> known as [...] "kaomoji" [...] have also become popular in the West in conjunction with Western-origin <b>emoticons,</b> resulting in a blend of the two. A 2006 study showed North American instant messaging users rated the importance of using <b>emoticons</b> much lower than Indian and East Asian users. However, by the 2010s, a 2013 questionnaire showed 74% of people in the US responded positively to the question, “Do you use stickers or emoji in messaging apps?” Characters used as <b>emoticons</b> that are used in certain Asian languages such as Kannada, an Indian language, has spread to and become popular to use on Western websites after initially being used on Japanese sites such as 2channel. Asian-origin characters that have become popular to use on Western websites include ಠ and ಥ (both of Kannada origin), ง (Thai origin), 益 (Mandarin origin), ㅅ (Korean origin) and ヮ and ツ (both of Japanese origin), for example, which are all used with other symbols to create <b>emoticons.</b>|$|R
2500|$|English-language anime forums adopted those Japanese-style emoticons {{that could}} be used with the {{standard}} ASCII characters available on Western keyboards. [...] Because of this, they are often called [...] "anime style" [...] emoticons in English. [...] They have since seen use in more mainstream venues, including online gaming, instant-messaging, and non-anime-related discussion forums. [...] Emoticons such as <(nbsp&^.^nbsp&)>, <(^_^<), <(o_o<), <(nbsp&-'.'-nbsp&)>, <('.'-^), or (>';..;')> which include the parentheses, mouth or nose, and arms (especially those represented by the inequality signs < or >) also are often referred to as [...] "" [...] in reference to their likeness to Nintendo's video game character Kirby. [...] The parentheses are sometimes dropped when used in the English language context, and the underscore of the mouth may be extended as an intensifier for the <b>emoticon</b> in question, e.g. ^_________^ for very happy. The <b>emoticon</b> [...] uses the Eastern style, but incorporates a depiction of the Western [...] "middle-finger flick-off" [...] using a [...] "t" [...] as the arm, hand, and finger. Another apparently Western invention is the use of emoticons like *,..,* or `;..;´ to indicate vampires or other mythical beasts with fangs.|$|E
2500|$|In 1963 the [...] "smiley face", {{a yellow}} button with two black dots {{representing}} eyes and an upturned thick curve representing a mouth {{was created by}} freelance artist Harvey Ball. It was realized on order of a large insurance company {{as part of a}} campaign to bolster the morale of its employees and soon became a big hit. This smiley presumably inspired many later emoticons; the most basic graphic <b>emoticon</b> that depicts this is in fact a small yellow smiley face.|$|E
2500|$|Some {{variants}} {{are also}} more common in certain countries due to keyboard layouts. For example, the smiley =) may occur in Scandinavia, where the keys for = and [...] ) are placed right beside each other. However, the :) variant is without a doubt the dominant one in Scandinavia, making the =) version a rarity. Diacritical marks are sometimes used. The letters Ö and Ü {{can be seen as}} an <b>emoticon,</b> as the upright version of :O (meaning that one is surprised) and :D (meaning that one is very happy) respectively.|$|E
