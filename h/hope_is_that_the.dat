25|$|As {{far back}} as the 1970s, {{international}} fast food restaurant chain Burger King has attempted to introduce a premium line of burgers. These sandwiches are part of a system which eventually became known as the barbell strategy; a plan designed to expand Burger King's menu with both more sophisticated, adult-oriented fare along with products that are more value-oriented. This program is intended to bring in a larger, more affluent adult audience who will be willing to spend more on the better quality products on one side while maintaining a lower cost value menu dedicated to a more cost-conscious audience on the other. The <b>hope</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> customers would be drawn in initially for the lower prices of the value-menu and upgrade to the more expensive products, upping overall sales.|$|E
25|$|The studio's {{official}} {{press release}} was presented on May 20, 2010 and confirmed that Smallville would be remaining at its Friday, 8 p.m. time slot. It {{also revealed that}} Smallville would be reteaming with Supernatural, a series that was originally slotted just behind Smallville on Thursday nights for four seasons. The press release did not list Mack {{in the list of}} stars. On May 21, 2010, Mack released a statement confirming that she would not return as a series regular, but would return for multiple episodes to wind up her storyline. However, at the 2010 Comic-Con, Peterson stated that, despite her long absence and limited episode count, Mack would remain a series regular. Mack stated that her <b>hope</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> character of Chloe will hold on to her integrity as the writers close out her storyline. For the actress, watching as her character matured over the years—from sacrificing the things she wanted for the sake of her friends, to finally reaching a point where she can strive to satisfy her own needs and wants—has been important for her. Tom Welling, who served as a part-time producer for season nine, was announced as a full executive producer for season ten. Welling was also set to direct two episodes during the season, and Justin Hartley was contracted to direct another episode.|$|E
500|$|The {{episode was}} met with mixed {{critical}} responses. Ahsan Haque of IGN praised {{the second half of}} the episode but felt that the Kathy Ireland plot was too long. In his review, he commented [...] "It's definitely meant for people who are open-minded to this kind of humor, and can make sure they treat the subject matter purely as comedy and not any manner of social commentary or prejudice. Take away the slow start, and this episode managed to really deliver some memorable shocking comedy." [...] TV Guide critic Alex Rocha praised the show's League of Justice opening sequence and the Kathy Ireland plot but reacted negatively to {{the second half of the}} episode, stating that he [...] "dozed off" [...] during the last fifteen minutes. TV Guide also listed the episode on the [...] "TV hot list" [...] of October 4. The Toronto Star noted the episode was [...] "worth watching". Todd VanDerWerff of The A.V. Club gave the episode a negative review, giving it a C— grade and concluding that, [...] "Overall, the episode was just an excuse to drag out a bunch of tired Jewish jokes and also have Peter briefly descend into anti-Semitism". Though he mostly disliked the episode, VanDerWerff praised Stewie's part in the episode, as well as the Shakespeare cutaway gag and a cutaway that featured Peter getting into fight with a cat. Jewish Journal critic Adam Willis commented [...] "My <b>hope</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> series will roast the familiar Jewish themes introduced in “Family Goy,” rather than continuing on the Jews-as-targets route. The show has regularly featured some inspiring Jewish gags– both in good taste and bad. And while Hebrew community in-jokes would be better received by Jewish viewers, the likely reality is the Holocaust humor will continue to dominate." ...|$|E

Immediate goals were to revisit the clubs administrative practices, establish a Colts program and recruit for a return to competition in 2010.

60|$|It must be conceded, {{to begin}} with, {{that the fact}} that two things have been found often {{together}} and never apart does not, by itself, suffice to prove demonstratively that they will be found together in the next case we examine.

The city was offered to France's envoy to Siam, the Chevalier de Chaumont, and a provisional treaty signed in December; Siamese ambassador Kosa Pan sailed to France the following year to ratify the cession. The French, however, were not interested: Secretary of State for the Navy, the Marquis de Seignelay, told Kosa Pan <b>that</b> Singora <b>was</b> ruined and of no further use, {{and asked for a}} trading post in Bangkok instead.|$|R
60|$|On the whole, I am {{satisfied}} {{with regard to}} 'Colombe.' I never expected a theatrical success, properly and vulgarly so called; and the play has taken rank, {{to judge by the}} various criticisms, in the right way, as a true poet's work: the defects of the acting drama seemed recognised as the qualities of the poem. It was impossible all that subtle tracery of thought and feeling should be painted out clear red and ochre with a house-painter's brush, and lose nothing of its effect.[22] A play that runs nowadays has generally four legs to run with--something of the beast to keep it going. The human biped with the 'os divinior' is slower than a racehorse even. What I <b>hope</b> <b>is,</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> poetical appreciation of 'Colombe' will give an impulse to the sale of the poems, which will be more acceptable to us than the other kind of success....|$|E

The old lady was certainly absolute fiar, and might dispose of it in full right of property. All {{that we have to}} <b>hope</b> <b>is,</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> devil may not have tempted her to alter this very proper settlement. You must attend the old girl's funeral to-morrow, to which you will receive an invitation, for I have acquainted her agent with your being here on Miss Bertram's part; and I will meet you afterwards at the house she inhabited, and be present to see fair play {{at the opening of the}} settlement.

So we can have hope, that, though Christ rebuke us, He will yet hear us, if our prayers are reasonable, and {{therefore}} according to His will. And surely, surely, surely, if our prayers are for the improvement of any human being; if we are praying that we, or any human being, may be made better men and truer Christians at last, and saved from the temptations of the world, the flesh, and the devil--oh then, then shall we not be heard? The Lord may keep us long waiting, as He kept St Monica of old, when she wept over St Augustine's youthful sins and follies. But He may answer us, as He answered her by the good bishop--"Be of good cheer. It is impossible that the son of so many prayers should perish." [...] And so, though He may shame us, in our inmost heart, by the rebuke--"Except ye see signs and wonders, ye will not believe"--He will in the same breath grant our prayer, undeserved though His condescension be, and say--"Go in peace, thy son liveth." ...|$|E
25|$|A {{few hours}} elapsed until Mackall {{was able to}} decide what to do next. Realizing <b>that</b> his {{position}} <b>was</b> hopeless, he put the men on the mainland in motion in the direction of Tiptonville.

Mackall's only <b>hope</b> <b>was</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> gunboats would not interfere, but they did, and the retreat of his army was delayed long enough for Pope's men to get to Tiptonville first. The defenders were trapped, with no prospect of victory, so Mackall decided to surrender.|$|R

Project TIP TOW was canceled when an EF-84D and a specially modified test EB-29A crashed, killing everyone on both aircraft. This accident was attributed to the EF-84D flipping over onto the wing of the EB-29A. Project Tom-Tom, involving RF-84Fs and a GRB-36D from the FICON project (redesignated JRB-36F), continued for a few months after this crash, but was also canceled due to the violent turbulence induced by the wingtip vortices of the B-36.|$|R

But, not being Lord Etherington, and an anointed scoundrel into the bargain, I will content myself with cudgelling him to death so soon as I can get out of the guardianship of this old, meddling, obstinate, self-willed, busybody.--Then, {{what is to be done}} for Clara?--This mock marriage was a mere bubble, and both parties must draw stakes. She likes this grave Don, who proves to be the stick of the right tree, after all--so do not I, though there be something lordlike about him. I was sure a strolling painter could not have carried it off so. She may marry him, I suppose, if the law is not against it--then she has the earldom, and the Oaklands, and Nettlewood, all at once.--Gad, we should come in winners, after all--and, I dare say, this old boy Touchwood is as rich as a Jew--worth a hundred thousand at least--He is too peremptory to be cut up for sixpence under a hundred thousand.--And he talks of putting me to rights--I must not wince--must stand still to be curried a little--Only, I wish the law may permit Clara's being married to this other earl.--A woman cannot marry two brothers, that is certain:--but then, if she is not married to the one of them in good and lawful form, there can be no bar to her marrying the other, I should think--I hope the lawyers will talk no nonsense about it--I hope Clara will have no foolish scruples.--But, by my word, the first thing I have to <b>hope</b> <b>is,</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> thing is true, for it comes through but a suspicious channel.

6000|$|Tom {{tells me}} that you called on Mr. Haslam, with a {{newspaper}} giving an account of a gentleman in a Fur cap falling over a precipice in Kirkcudbrightshire. If it was me, I {{did it in a}} dream, or in some magic interval {{between the first and second}} cup of tea; which is nothing extraordinary when we hear that Mahomet, in getting out of Bed, upset a jug of water, and, whilst it was falling, took a fortnight's trip, as it seemed, to Heaven; yet was back in time to save one drop of water being spilt. As for Fur caps, I do not remember one beside my own, except at Carlisle: this was a very good Fur cap I met in High Street, and I daresay was the unfortunate one. I daresay that the fates, seeing but two Fur caps in the north, thought it too extraordinary, and so threw the dies which of them should be drowned. The lot fell upon Jones: I daresay his name was Jones. All I <b>hope</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> gaunt Ladies said not a word about hanging; if they did I shall repent that I was not half-drowned in Kirkcudbright. Stop! let me see!--being half-drowned by falling from a precipice, is a very romantic affair: why should I not take it to myself? How glorious to be introduced in a drawing-room to a Lady who reads Novels, with [...] "Mr. So-and-so--Miss So-and-so; Miss So-and-so, this is Mr. So-and-so, who fell off a precipice and was half-drowned." [...] Now I refer to you, whether I should lose so fine an opportunity of making my fortune. No romance lady could resist me--none. Being run under a Waggon--side-lamed in a playhouse, Apoplectic through Brandy--and a thousand other tolerably decent things for badness, would be nothing, but being tumbled over a precipice into the sea--oh! it would make my fortune--especially if you could contrive to hint, from this bulletin's authority, that I was not upset on my own account, but that I dashed into the waves after Jessy of Dumblane, and pulled her out by the hair. But that, alas! she was dead, or she would have made me happy with her hand--however in this you may use your own discretion. But I must leave joking, and seriously aver, that I have been very romantic indeed among these Mountains and Lakes. I have got wet through, day after day--eaten oat-cake, and drank Whisky--walked up to my knees in Bog--got a sore throat--gone to see Icolmkill and Staffa; met with wholesome food just here and there as it happened--went up Ben Nevis, and--N.B., came down again. Sometimes when I am rather tired I lean rather languishingly on a rock, and long for some famous Beauty to get down from her Palfrey in passing, approach me, with--her saddle-bags, and give me--a dozen or two capital roastbeef Sandwiches.|$|E
