5|$|It was {{initially}} named the Folboat Troop, after {{the type of}} folding canoe employed in raiding operations, and then renamed No. 1 Special Boat Section in early 1941.

In June 1942, they took part in the Crete airfield raids. In September 1942, they carried out Operation Anglo, a raid on two airfields on the island of Rhodes, from which only two men returned.

When he returns to Mimiga Village, he finds that the Doctor has captured the Mimigas.
