The crop management practiced included conventional rainfed, untied ridges, planting basins and supplemental irrigation. Scatter plots inferred {{the most sensitive}} variables affecting <b>family</b> <b>balance,</b> while the Monte Carlo method, using random sampling, was used to propagate the uncertainty in the model inputs to produce <b>family</b> <b>balance</b> probability distributions. A non-linear correlation between in-season rainfall and <b>family</b> <b>balance</b> arises from several factors that affect crop yield, indicating the complexity of farm family finance resource-base in relation to climate, crop management practices and environ- mental resources of soil and water. Stronger relationships between <b>family</b> <b>balance</b> and evapotranspira- tion than with in-season rainfall were obtained. Sensitivity analysis results suggest more targeted investment effort in data monitoring of yield, in-season rainfall, supplemental irrigation and maize price to reduce <b>family</b> <b>balance</b> uncertainty that varied from 42 % to 54 % at 90 % confidence level.

40|$|<b>Balancing</b> {{work and}} <b>family</b> {{responsibilities}} is an increasingly significant concern {{not only for}} individual employees, their families and the broader community, but also for government and local communities. However {{little attention has been}} paid to the different ways in which constraints and opportunities for work and <b>family</b> <b>balance</b> operate across industry in regional and rural Australia or how these differences might affect employee work and <b>family</b> <b>balance</b> outcomes. Nor has there been any detailed analysis of the ways in which local infrastructure, such as the operating hours of local services including kindergartens, public transport and local government services, might support or frustrate better work and <b>family</b> <b>balance.</b> A regional focus is important because work and <b>family</b> <b>balance</b> for individual workers and or working families is dependent on many background economic and social forces outside the family or household. These include: > The structure of job opportunities in a particular area, such as the strength of labour demand and the configuration of dominant industries and skill requirements; > The availability of public and private infrastructure such as transport, education and training, childcare and aged care; and > Specific employment benefits and workplace conditions that the worker experiences in his or her job, eg the number of hours, schedules, wages, leave provisions, and the nature of supervision. The recent implementation of the Federal Government’s wide ranging policy and legislative changes in industrial relations and its welfare to work reforms are expected to further intensify the challenges faced by working <b>families</b> in <b>balancing</b> work and <b>family.</b> Much depends on the response of employers. It remains uncertain the extent to which, and how quickly, WorkChoices will influence employers’ decisions with respect to wages and conditions. ‘Work and <b>Family</b> <b>Balance</b> in Regional Victoria: a Pilot Project’ is an exploratory study and focuses on four Victorian regional areas – Bendigo, Colac, Horsham and Latrobe City.

50|$|In contrast, actual {{experience}} in Western cultures provides {{no evidence for}} any degree of gender imbalance from technologies which have long been available and legal - such as selective abortion or preimplantation embryo testing. When used for <b>family</b> <b>balancing</b> indications in such countries as the United States, pre-conceptual sex selection is widely sought without any preferential selection of males.A 1993 {{survey of more than}} 2300 pregnant women in the British population found no overall preference for either sex. These findings are largely consistent with other surveys conducted in the US. Thus the right of individual families {{to determine whether or not}} to balance gender of offspring in their families is not and will not become, in many countries, a demographic issue. Furthermore, in countries where such demographic issues exist because of strong gender preferences in a segment of the population, regulatory and legal control of, without denial of access to, sperm sorting technology can be utilized to provide individuals with choices while ensuring that equal numbers of boys and girls are produced for population demographic equality.|$|E

40|$|The {{development}} of pre-implantation genetic diagnosis (PGD) has allowed accurate sex selection {{to be possible}} both for medical and non-medical reasons. PGD is performed in conjunction with in vitro fertilisation (IVF). Currently, in the UK sex selection is only legal for medical reasons. The purpose of this dissertation is to analyse the legal and ethical arguments in permitting sex selection for <b>family</b> <b>balancing</b> to become legal. Through extensive literature research and analysis this dissertation aims to show that allowing sex selection for <b>family</b> <b>balancing</b> {{will not have a}} detrimental effect upon society or the future sex selected child. Research has revealed that sex selection for <b>family</b> <b>balancing</b> will not distort the sex ratio of the UK, it will not be discriminatory against one particular sex nor will it be the beginning of the slippery slope towards designer babies. Sex selection for <b>family</b> <b>balancing</b> will not be a drain upon the NHS resources as {{it would have to be}} funded privately and neither will it disregard the status of the embryo. The conclusion drawn from this research is that the current regulation on sex selection in the UK is inadequate. Many UK parents want access to PGD and possibly other sex selective technology, such as sperm sorting, as they want to be able to select the sex of their baby for <b>family</b> <b>balancing</b> reasons. The main reasoning behind this is that these parents want the opportunity to experience the rearing of children of both sexes. As long as there are strict rules and regulations in place and the welfare of the future child and any existing children are considered, it is recommended that the law on sex selection should change to allow parents to select the sex of their baby but only for <b>family</b> <b>balancing</b> reasons...|$|E

The results indicate that couples pursuing <b>family</b> <b>balancing</b> understand justice primarily in individualist and familial terms rather than in terms of social justice for women and girls or for children resulting from sex selection. Study participants indicated that an individual’s desire for gender balance in their family is ethically complex and may not be inherently sexist, immoral, or socially consequential, particularly given the social context in which they live. Our findings suggest that the social conditions that contribute to prospective users ’ desires for gender balance in their families may direct them away from recognizing or engaging broader social justice concerns relating to sexism and stratified reproduction...|$|E
40|$|BACKGROUND: Like {{a number}} of {{international}} organizations before them, the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG) recently issued an ethics opinion, which condemned all indications of elective gender selec-tion as devaluatory to women and sexist and, therefore, given the choice, assumed automatic preference for male gender selection in all populations. This study intended to investigate this notion for accuracy. METHODS: We inves-tigated the desired gender in 92 couples who had undergone between January 2004 and December 2006 first in vitro fertilization (IVF) cycles in attempts at gender selection for <b>family</b> <b>balancing</b> purposes. Their choices were then also investigated stratified for the ethnicity of the couple. RESULTS: Among 92 cycles, 36 cycles were selected for female and 56 for male (P 5 0. 037). An analysis based on the couples ’ ethnicities revealed, however, considerable differences in gender selection patterns. Especially Chinese (21 out of 22), Arab/Muslim (5 out of 6) and Asian-Indian (5 out of 5) couples primarily selected for males. Other ethnicities, however, actually preferentially selected for female gender (34 female, 25 male selections in 59 cycles). Gender choices thus varied in a statistically significant way between ethni-cities (P < 0. 001). CONCLUSIONS: In an ethnically mixed patient population, elective gender selection for <b>family</b> <b>balancing</b> purposes in most ethnic groups does not represent a discriminatory procedure against female equality. However, cultural biases against females are, indeed, still maintained in some minority populations. Ethics opinion...|$|E

40|$|Parents in many {{developing}} countries may prefer boys to girls, either due to intrinsic gender bias, or because of the marriage squeeze — girls find it harder to marry due to population growth and the age gap at marriage, and parents also value having grandchildren.

This is socially inefficient, due to a congestion externality in the marriage market, and improvements in selection techniques aggravate the inefficiency. On the other hand, if intrinsic gender bias is absent, then sex selection may improve welfare {{in the presence of the}} marriage squeeze.
