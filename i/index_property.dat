40|$|The California Bearing Ratio is a {{penetration}} test {{for evaluation of}} the mechanical strength of road sub-grades and base-courses. This {{can be used as}} a mean of designing the road pavement required for a particular strength of sub-grade by comparing the strength of different sub-grade materials. However; civil engineers always encounter difficulties in obtaining representative CBR value for design of pavement. Over the years, many correlations had been proposed by various researchers in which the soil <b>index</b> <b>properties</b> were used to develop these correlations. A study was carried out to find correlations between CBR value with soil <b>index</b> <b>properties</b> those best suit the type of soils in Sri Lanka. Analyses were carried out based on the published correlations and soil data obtained from several Sri Lankan project sites. Based on the results, it is observed that the current published correlations are not in good agreement with Sri Lanka soils. In addition, no typical range could be found based on the soil <b>index</b> <b>properties.</b> Mechanical Strength of soil depends not only on the soil type but also on the observable physical characteristics which significantly influence on a soil’s behavior. Therefore, a method is proposed for correlating soaked CBR value and compaction parameters with such <b>index</b> <b>properties,</b> for Sri Lankan soils. This research covers the entire soil types according to Unified Soil Classification System which are generally used as sub-grades and base-courses. Among the several soil <b>index</b> <b>properties,</b> Atterberg Limits and grain size distribution data are used in this regard as these tests are much more economical and rapid than Compaction and CBR tests.

40|$|Leg 199 drilled {{a series}} of sites in the {{equatorial}} Pacific in order to investigate the paleoceanography of the Paleogene Pacific Ocean. The two deepest cored sites, (1218 and 1219) have provided continuous/near continuous spliced sedimentary sections and in situ wireline log data. Comparison of core to log data sets shows the familiar non-linear, increasing with depth, miss-match between the core (metres composite depth - mcd) and log (mbsf) depths and concomitant offset between core and log physical property data sets e. g. porosity, density, velocity. The depth miss-matches represent core expansion due to elastic rebound experienced by the sediments upon unloading i. e. removal of overburden stress, which {{is a function of}} the sediment void ratio and log of the effective in situ stress. The increasing depth offset observed between the 1218 core and log data is used to calculate an expansion index (C$_{r}$) for continuous discrete measurement intervals, down the core. The C$_{r}$ values are used to re-compress the core (mcd) depth scale and as expected provide a good match with the log (mbsf) depths. The C$_{r}$ values are also used to correct the core <b>index</b> <b>property</b> data, to in situ values. The quality of the corrected core <b>index</b> <b>property</b> data is good when compared with the in situ measured log data. C$_{r}$ values are dependent upon the sediment composition (especially the quantity of clay) and core light absorption spectroscopy (LAS) data collected on Leg 199, provides a continuous down-core record of sediment composition, in terms of the percent clay, carbonate and opal. A relationship between the C$_{r}$ values and the sediment LAS composition is established and is then applied to the Site 1219 core LAS data, allowing appropriate C$_{r}$ values to be assigned to continuous, discrete core intervals. These composition based C$_{r}$ values are then used to re-calculate the core (mcd) depths and correct the <b>index</b> <b>property</b> data to in situ values. The quality of the depth and <b>index</b> <b>property</b> corrections are checked by comparison with the in situ measured log data, and provide encouraging results...|$|E
