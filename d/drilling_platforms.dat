25|$|The Texas Towers were a set {{of three}} radar {{facilities}} off the eastern seaboard of the United States which were used for surveillance by the United States Air Force during the Cold War. Modeled on the offshore oil <b>drilling</b> <b>platforms</b> first employed off the Texas coast, they were in operation from 1958-1963. After the collapse {{of one of the}} towers in 1961, the remaining towers were closed due to changes in threat perception and out of a concern {{for the safety of the}} crews.|$|E
25|$|The VB-10,000 is a heavy-lift twin-gantry {{catamaran}} {{consisting of}} two truss space frames atop two barges. The design was derived from Versabar's earlier VB-4000 (aka Bottom Feeder), which was developed to clear debris from toppled oil <b>drilling</b> <b>platforms</b> in the Gulf of Mexico. Instead of sending divers to section the wreckage into pieces, the heavy-lift capability facilitates salvaging the platform as a single piece. The primary benefit is increasing safety by {{reducing the number of}} high-risk diving activities, but substantial cost savings can be realized by reducing the number of lifts and shortening the decommissioning schedule.|$|E

25|$|The first {{offshore}} wells {{drilled in}} the Beaufort used artificial islands as <b>drilling</b> <b>platforms,</b> {{but this was}} a winter drilling system, and was only practical in shallow water. In the mid-1970s, the introduction of a fleet of reinforced drillships extended the drilling season to include the 90 to 120 ice-free days of summer. This also enabled the industry to drill in the deeper waters of the Beaufort Sea. By the mid-1980s, variations on artificial island and drilling vessel technologies had extended both the drilling season and the depth of water at which the industry could operate. They had also reduced exploration costs.|$|E
500|$|While Andrew was {{entering}} the Gulf of Mexico, oil companies evacuated hundreds of employees from offshore <b>drilling</b> <b>platforms.</b> The storm damaged 241oil and gas facilities and toppled 33platforms {{off the coast}} of Louisiana, causing significant disruptions in production. Additionally, 83pipeline segments suffered damage to some degree. The oil industry lost about $12million per day in the days following Andrew and $4million daily by three weeks later. Initially, a production loss of 240,000 to 270,000barrels per day occurred [...] approximately one-third of production throughout the Gulf of Mexico. Overall, Hurricane Andrew caused about $500million in damage to oil facilities.|$|E

Strong winds and heavy surf destroyed 13oil platforms and damaged 5beyond repair. All but one of the lost oil rigs were built to withstand a [...] "25-year storm", with the other constructed to withstand a [...] "100-year storm".
