5|$|Chadwick did {{not believe}} that there was any {{likelihood}} of another war with Germany in 1939, and took his family for a holiday on a remote lake in northern Sweden. The news of the outbreak of the Second World War therefore came as a shock. Determined not to spend another war in an internment camp, Chadwick made his way to Stockholm as <b>fast</b> <b>as</b> <b>he</b> <b>could,</b> but when he arrived there with his family, he found that all air traffic between Stockholm and London had been suspended. They made their way back to England on a tramp steamer. When he reached Liverpool, Chadwick found Joseph Rotblat, a Polish post-doctoral fellow who had come to work with the cyclotron, was now destitute, as he was cut off from funds from Poland. Chadwick promptly hired Rotblat as a lecturer, despite his poor grasp of English.|$|E
5|$|Falkenberg and Næsheim {{held onto}} Bågenholm's skis {{as they waited}} for the rescue teams to arrive. At first Bågenholm {{struggled}} in the cold water before she found an air pocket and was able to remain conscious for 40minutes before becoming a victim of circulatory arrest. Ketil Singstad led the rescue team {{from the top of the}} mountain. He skied as <b>fast</b> <b>as</b> <b>he</b> <b>could</b> to Bågenholm's location, where he and his rescue team tried unsuccessfully to pull her out with a rope. They then tried to dig her out, but their snow shovel could not break through the ice. Rescuers from the bottom of the mountain then arrived, bringing with them a pointed gardening shovel. They were able to cut a hole in the ice, and pulled her through at 19:40. Bågenholm had been in the water for 80minutes when she was rescued.|$|E
5|$|Having failed as a spin bowler in a {{trial at}} Richmond in 1950, Meckiff {{switched}} to fast bowling in 1951–52 when he began his district career in Victorian Premier Cricket with South Melbourne. He started in the Fourth XI after his brother had to withdraw from a match. The following summer, aged 17, Meckiff was in the senior team and played in South Melbourne's first championship-winning side in his debut season in the First XI, although his club career was sometimes interrupted by national service in the reserves. After receiving requests from cricket administrators, the military authorities scheduled the leave of young players for weekends, so that the impact on their careers would be minimised. At the time, Australia lacked bowlers of great pace, so a teammate advised Meckiff to bowl as <b>fast</b> <b>as</b> <b>he</b> <b>could,</b> without regard for accuracy—a plan he successfully adopted.|$|E

25|$|Farnes {{was reduced}} to tears in 1932, playing against Yorkshire at Scarborough. Earlier that year, playing at Leyton, Yorkshire had beaten Essex by an innings and 313 runs.

25|$|It is {{said that}} the Athenians would not believe their loss, in a great degree because {{of the person who}} first brought them news of it. For a certain stranger, it seems, coming to Piraeus, and there sitting in a barber's shop, began to talk of what had happened, as if the Athenians already knew all that had passed; which the barber hearing, before he acquainted anybody else, ran as <b>fast</b> <b>as</b> <b>he</b> <b>could</b> up into the city, {{addressed}} himself to the Archons, and presently spread it about in the public Place. On which, there being everywhere, as may be imagined, terror and consternation, the Archons summoned a general assembly, and there brought in the man and questioned him how he came to know. And he, giving no satisfactory account, was taken for a spreader of false intelligence and a disturber of the city, and was, therefore, fastened to the wheel and racked a long time, till other messengers arrived that related the whole disaster particularly. So hardly was Nicias believed to have suffered the calamity which he had often predicted.|$|E

500|$|Appian {{claims that}} Spartacus {{executed}} some 300 captured Roman soldiers to avenge {{the death of}} Crixus, forcing them to fight each other to the death as gladiators. Following this victory, Spartacus pushed northwards with his followers (some 120,000) as <b>fast</b> <b>as</b> <b>he</b> <b>could</b> travel, [...] "having burned all his useless material, killed all his prisoners, and butchered his pack-animals in order to expedite his movement".|$|E

The christening had taken place, and Ima I was to remain." [...] During her childhood, Hogg's elder brother William often came home from school with a bloody nose, the result of defending, as she later recalled, [...] "my good name". Throughout her adult years, Hogg signed her name in a scrawl that left her first name illegible. Her personal stationery was usually printed [...] "Miss Hogg" [...] or [...] "I. Hogg", and she often had her stationery order placed in her secretary's name to avoid questions. Hogg did not use a nickname until several months before her death, when she began calling herself [...] "Imogene". Her last passport was issued to [...] "Ima Imogene Hogg".|$|E
500|$|Following {{the second}} race, Giovinazzi thanked his team for {{encouraging}} {{him not to}} give up the race and that he felt emotional and excited during the event's final lap. He stated that he was expecting a good result but had not anticipated winning both of the weekend's races. Giovinazzi said {{it would be difficult to}} repeat the performance but he would enjoy the results. Gasly said it felt like [...] "a crazy race" [...] but enjoyed it. He revealed that he attempted to focus on driving in order to be as <b>fast</b> <b>as</b> <b>he</b> <b>could,</b> but it had been difficult to build a large gap because of the circuit's long straights. He was happy with his second-place finish and said that it had been a fair battle for the win. Matsushita was issued with a one-race ban for the next race weekend in Austria for [...] "erratic driving" [...] and for causing a safety hazard in the first and second rolling restarts of the sprint race. Eriksson was judged to have caused the collision between himself and King and was issued with a three-place grid penalty that was taken at the season's next race.|$|E

2500|$|There are copious {{examples}} in this match which serve to support Altham's affirmation that Read was [...] "a wonderful fielder in the country" [...] (i.e. outfield).

He crawled up the ravine to see where he could see the soldiers. He shot them as <b>fast</b> <b>as</b> <b>he</b> <b>could</b> load his gun. They fell off their horses as <b>fast</b> <b>as</b> <b>he</b> <b>could</b> shoot." [...] When they found they were being killed so fast, the ones that were left broke and ran as fast as their horses could go to some other soldiers that were further along the ridge toward Custer. Here they tried to make another stand and fired some shots, but we rushed them along the ridge where Custer was. Then they made another stand (the third) and rallied a few minutes. Then they went along the ridge and got with Custer’s men." ...|$|E
2500|$|While Ermey practiced {{his lines}} in a {{rehearsal}} room, a production assistant would throw tennis balls and oranges at him.

2500|$|In 1984, Hatch, a Fulbright-trained {{economist}} and international development expert, conceived a new method for delivering {{assistance to the}} poor. In an airplane high above the Andes, Hatch was {{en route to a}} consultant assignment in Bolivia, when inspiration struck. He grabbed in-flight cocktail napkins, scraps of paper, and a pen and began writing down ideas, equations, and flow charts as <b>fast</b> <b>as</b> <b>he</b> <b>could.</b> By the time he landed in La Paz, he had the outline of a radically different approach to poverty alleviation: a financial services program that put the poor in charge. “Give poor communities the opportunity, and then get out of the way!” he said. He called the idea [...] "village banking". This approach gave the poor the opportunity to obtain loans without collateral-the poor's main obstacle to accessing credit—at market-level interest rates.|$|E
60|$|With that Danny {{curled up}} in the old tomato can. But it wasn't meant that Danny should have that nap. He had closed his eyes, but his ears were still open, and {{presently}} he heard soft footsteps drawing near. His eyes flew open, and he forgot all about sleep, you may be sure, for those footsteps sounded familiar. They sounded to Danny very, {{very much like the}} footsteps of--whom do you think? Why, Reddy Fox! Danny's heart began to beat <b>faster</b> <b>as</b> <b>he</b> listened. <b>Could</b> it be? <b>He</b> didn't dare peep out.

60|$|Chatterer, {{still running}} {{for his life}} and without the least hope, {{suddenly}} saw a last chance to escape from Shadow the Weasel. That is, he saw something that might offer him a chance. He couldn't be sure until he had tried, and even then he might escape from one danger only to run right into another equally great. What Chatterer saw was a big brown bunch {{near the top of}} a tall chestnut-tree, and he headed for that tree <b>as</b> <b>fast</b> <b>as</b> ever <b>he</b> <b>could</b> go. What was that big brown bunch? Why it was Redtail the Hawk, who was dozing there with his head drawn down between his shoulders dreaming.|$|R
60|$|Just <b>as</b> <b>he</b> {{reached the}} old barrel, Reddy {{was so close}} to him that Peter was almost sure that <b>he</b> <b>could</b> feel Reddy's breath.

When he reached it, he turned {{to see what was happening}} behind him, for he knew by the screaming of Sammy Jay and by other sounds that a great deal was happening.

2500|$|Blue Horse {{was known}} for {{assisting}} white men in distress and swore {{in the presence of}} the Great Spirit [...] "Wakan Tanka" [...] that his brown hand had never risen to kill a white man. Blue Horse's friend E.A. Burbank reported: “At my hotel in Pine Ridge I chanced to meet a white Indian trader who owned a store about twenty-five miles from the agency. He said that a good many years before a band of Sioux had captured twelve of his comrades and planned to burn them at the stake. Blue Horse, who lived forty miles distant, heard of their intentions and immediately mounted his horse and rode as <b>fast</b> <b>as</b> <b>he</b> <b>could</b> to where the Indians held the whites captive. The trader said he never saw an Indian or a white man work harder than Blue Horse did that day to save the lives of those twelve men, which he was able to accomplish, and from that time on, he said whenever he met Blue Horse he always gave him money and tobacco in recognition of his aid to white men in distress.” Blue Horse’s Wágluȟe village afterward became noted as a place of refuge for white travelers.|$|E
2500|$|The {{landing at}} Caval was a tense one {{though there was}} no fighting, Perry {{stationed}} sentries at the gates of the royal kraal to help with escape should it be necessary. Crack-O denied that his people had done anything wrong, so he touched his ears and his tongue, with his sword, as a gesture of truthfulness. Governor Roberts asked Crack-O if he would attend the [...] "Great Palaver" [...] at Little Bereby and he accepted. Next Perry sailed his squadron for Little Bereby on December 11 and arrived on December 14 and landed his fifty marines and 150 sailors. The meeting was held in a house about fifty yards from the kraal gates, during which Roberts began discussing with Crack-O the Mary Carver and the Edward Barley affairs. It was apparent that the king was not telling the truth, so Commodore Perry stepped closer to Crack-O to advise him to stop lying and a scuffle ensued. The chief attempted to drag Perry to his spear, but the commodore threw off his attacker, who then left the house as <b>fast</b> <b>as</b> <b>he</b> <b>could.</b> But before getting out the door, a marine sergeant opened fire with his musket and hit the king while two others bayoneted him. Simultaneously the native interpreter ran {{out of the house and}} skirmishing erupted between the American sentries and some Bereby riflemen.|$|E
2500|$|He first {{ran against}} his great rival Steve Ovett in a schools {{cross country race}} in 1972. Neither won, nor did either win in their first major {{encounter}} in the European Championships Prague on 31 August 1978 in the 800m where Ovett (breaking Coe's UK record with a run of 1:44.09) was second and Coe finished third behind the East German Olaf Beyer. According to Pat Butcher, Coe's father and coach Peter Coe had encouraged him to run as <b>fast</b> <b>as</b> <b>he</b> <b>could</b> from the start. The early pace was indeed exceptionally fast: Coe ran 200 metres in 24.3 seconds, 400 metres in 49.32 seconds and 600 metres in 1:16.2: then he slowed down and finished third in 1:44.76. A few weeks later Coe was to reclaim the UK record, setting an all-comers' mark of 1:43.97 [...] at Crystal Palace to rank him second {{in the world that}} year. On 1st of October 1978, Coe displayed to the world for the first time his phenomenal natural endurance by winning the Loughrea 4 Mile road race in Ireland in 17:54, defeating the likes of Eamonn Coghlan (1983 World 5000m champion) and Mike McLeod (1984 Olympic 10000m silver medalist), and breaking Brendan Foster's course record of 18:05. All this off a season which had been focussed on 800m, with only one race over 1500m or a mile. This was a warning to the world's top milers of what was to happen the following summer.|$|E
60|$|Now {{there was}} nothing that Redeye himself could do to help, for he was too small. He must get help somewhere else, and he must do it quickly.

Perhaps Unc' Billy <b>could</b> help. <b>He</b> hoped that Unc' Billy was at home, and he wasted no time in finding out. Unc' Billy was at home, and when he heard that his old friend Prickly Porky was in trouble, he hurried up the hill <b>as</b> <b>fast</b> <b>as</b> ever <b>he</b> <b>could.</b> <b>He</b> saw right away what was the trouble.|$|R
