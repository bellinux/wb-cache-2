After taking account of a conceptual framework, which concludes in an econometric model, with the methodology used by Bittencourt & Domingo (1996), regressions were estimated in several panels for the dependent variables: total FDI, FDI corrected (less mergers and acquisit ions and privatizations), FDI from United States and FDI in manufacturing. The joint panel (forty years and four countries) confirm that we can identify a “model” of Mercosur’s FDI receipts. The <b>internal</b> market <b>dynamism,</b> the export performance and the macroeconomic stability have importance as FDI determinants. FDI corrected and FDI from United States, presented an structural change in 1986. The regional integration process impact the FDI with significant and positive net effects.

40|$|This paper {{deals with}} the first {{systematic}} theoretical approaches to theatre directing in Croatia, corresponding, both historically and problematically, with the European trends in affirming stage directors’ contribution to theatrical phenomenon. This primarily concerns authors from the period of modernism such as Ivo Raić, Branko Gavella, Tito Strozzi, Josip Kulundžić and Kalman Mesarić. Gavella and Kulundžić are the first Croatian directors–theoreticians describing stage directing as theatrical inter-discipline and, thus, applying the ostulates of directing to the teaching process. Both Gavella and Kulundžić approached theatrical theory with the practical knowledge of theatre production. By exploring links between {{the theme of the}} play, the idea of the play and the idea of the staged performance, Kulundžić contributed {{to one of the most}} intriguing interdisciplinary debates on theatre directing, pondering on the question of how director’s »actualization« and »localization« changes the idea of the play and how this very idea could be changed by actors’ concept of dramatis personae. This paper also points to the necessity of revaluati Kalman Mesarić’s theoretical insight into theatre directing and dramaturgy. In the section of the text dealing with the »heritage« of Croatian contemporary directing for theatre, the author reflects upon Kosta Spaić’s analysis of the relationship between the scene and the auditorium on the example of some open space (»ambiental«) productions in the urban centre of Dubrovnik. On the other hand, Božidar Violić, quite like Gavella, gives primacy to the treatment of the theatrical space of the closed, »chamber« stage. However, Spaić and Violić, both of them autstanding theatre practitioners, are aware of the stimulating performing potential of directors’ underlying and recreating the <b>internal</b> space <b>dynamism...</b>|$|R

Taking into account the historic center of Salerno, the paper discusses an urban regeneration experience based on remote monitoring and permanent maintenance with innovative technologies.

The paper identifies a knowledge based approach as the means to promote outdoor spaces identity, with the affirmation of inner inherent <b>dynamism,</b> <b>internal</b> and external connection. Knowledge based active protection is here identified with a process of anticipation, vigilance and planning of vulnerabilities, informed to the logic of responsibility sharing between users and managers, coordinating design choices. Condition for an active protection is the complementarily of information, experience and expertise, for the preservation and promotion of the built capital. Reconciling multi-scalar and multi-sector approaches, active protection brings into play an idea of the settlement as an interconnected system, where design scenarios arise from the complexity of the relationships between spaces, performances and instances.

40|$|Economic {{globalisation}} {{provides a}} fitting context for China’s modernisation and pluralistic development. This, in turn, allows China {{to become a}} cosmopolitan and civilising influence in economic globalisation. The interaction between economic globalisation and China’s development can indeed be mutually productive. It can, by the same token, be mutually destructive if care is not taken to retain the humane ‘ren’ qualities of Confucian culture as the underlying philosophy of this Sino-global interface. With the imminent return of China to its former status as 2 ̆ 7 celestial empire 2 ̆ 7 or superpower - a superpower, one may speculate, ‘with Confucian characteristics’ - we will be seeing more of the Chinese cultural style of statecraft. This {{is necessary for the}} return of China to its central place between ‘Heaven and Earth’, thus returning humanity to the cosmic triad. In contemporary terms, it means humanising globalisation. Japan, as a foremost economic globaliser and part of the traditional Confucian culture area, would be well placed to assist in this endeavour. This paper proposes that as China modernises and grows more connected with the global system, it will be compelled by its own <b>internal</b> logic and <b>dynamism</b> to instigate a shift in the international political system. Like the European Union, which is currently finding strength in pluralistic unity rather than fragmented sovereignties, China will soon {{be in a position to}} cross the threshold of an international system in which states are self-serving or ‘xiaoren’, to the Confucian notion of ‘junzi’ by which states – like people – can be ‘self-cultivating’ (in other words, ‘self-civilising’) in an interactive global system. The proverbial ‘struggle for power’ thus converts to ‘partnerships of power’; it is now more profitable to connect than to clash. This ethos applies as much to civilisations as to states and their citizens. With the above in mind, China can address the needs of globalisation by remembering itself as a one-world ‘datong’-serving civilisation. The exigencies of globalisation might well unlock China’s rich cultural resources for global survival and meaningfulness. It may be postulated that the current economic globalisation presents a rare opportunity for China to gravitate to its rightful place under the 21 st century international Heaven (or moral universe). The price of not doing so will be prohibitive –both for China and the world. An untamed globalisation serves no one’s interests, not even that of the markets which seek consumers and deplore economic wastelands. This paper proposes that economic globalisation will require Confucian characteristics and a strong Chinese state to sponsor them. The beneficiaries would then be human. Policies and practices that seek to avoid the human cost of economic globalisation, while building creative capacity, must surely be mandated by Heaven...|$|R

Science goes beyond its specific function and also prepares people to find the profound and hidden meaning of reality. This understanding of science may serve as a good starting point in the science-religion dialogue, since it recognizes a potentiality in science to be interpreted in religious terms. The second is his understanding of matter which surpasses all matter-spirit dualism.

40|$|After {{years of}} poor {{economic}} performance, many Latin American countries undertook ambitious programs of macroeconomic stabilization andstructural reform in recent years. This {{change in policy}} created high expectations for the region, and some observers have questioned whether actual growth outcomes have lived up to these expectations. The authors offer evidence that the response of economic growth to reforms in Latin America has not been disappointing. Because of their significant policy changes, and despite a global slowdown, Latin America did well to return to its historic growth rate of 2 percent per capita in 1990 - 93. Latin America has responded to changes in policy variables, as would have been predicted by the experience of other times and places. Those earlier experiences are summarized by a panel regression spanning many countries and multi-year periods from 1960 to 1993.

30|$|A {{model of}} {{business}} incubation process as developed by Hackett and Dilts (2004 a) {{is based on}} the concept of ‘black-box’. The process is primarily concerned with what happens inside the incubator (its <b>internal</b> <b>dynamism)</b> with a link to its environment. The Hackett and Dilts model conceives business incubation as the selection of incubatees from pool munificence of prospective candidates who ‘enter’ into the black box of incubation. The incubatees undergo value addition activities in three ways: selection performance (which is also an aspect of selecting prospective incubatees), monitoring and business assistance intensity and resource munificence. The incubatees are then outputted from the ‘black-box’ of incubation as graduated companies having an outcome that is either success or failure. The Hackett and Dilts model has control variables of population size, state of the economy, incubator size, and incubator level of development. In summary, their business incubation process model comprises three fundamental activities: selecting weak but promising firms to be admitted to the incubation program, monitoring and assisting those that would be successful and lastly providing the requisite resources to help them develop and graduate from the incubation program as financially viable and freestanding firms.|$|E

Firms are often {{faced with the challenge}} of establishing ways to engage in goal directed action that calls upon routinized, path dependent activity as well as the exploration of new opportunities, at times when there is inner turbulence. Using an in-depth case study (2007 to 2012) on the airline Spanair, we ask the following question: How can a firm leverage its dynamic capabilities to bring about deep purposeful change? In our findings we identify a circular rather than hierarchical capability pattern with four dynamic capabilities, adding, transferring, integrating and shedding, and two higher order capabilities, goal development and orchestration. We contribute to the literature by demonstrating, how a link between the goal development capability of senior directors and the change orchestration capability, create a goal directed path. We also explain how the link between the high order and dynamic capabilities develops an important bridge between path dependence and path creation. We then demonstrate how goal adjustment occurs in a circular manner to create a link between the four dynamic capabilities and the goal development capability. Furthermore, we demonstrate how the goal development and change orchestration capabilities jointly enable a firm’s transformation, particularly in times of heightened internal and external environmental turbulence.

40|$|The {{present study}} {{will attempt to}} achieve this double {{objective}} — to gain an insight into the fundamental structures of educational behaviour {{in order to help}} explain the inertia that has weighed against educational reform. We will seek to penetrate everyday practice in Belgian primary education. The choice of the primary school as the object of study reflects not only the background to the research project but also the ferm belief that the essence of educational intervention is most clearly revealed at those levels at which educationalisation has penetrated most effectively. The period covered by the study has also been carefully selected. It runs from 1880 to 1970 and thus takes in the years in which the second industrial revolution made itself felt. To test the hypothetical continuity of educational behaviour, a deliberate choice has also :been made for three key periods in economic history, in which the social situation varied significantly: the 1880 s, the 1930 s and the 1960 s. This sequence accentuates the cyclical pattern of economic development and sets out a kind of macro-historical line of discontinuity against which the <b>internal</b> <b>dynamism</b> of educational behaviour has been played out. The foundations of the `schoolish' society were laid during the first period with its 'écoles casernes'. It was during the second, meanwhile, that education became a mass phenomenon with authoritarian overtones — it is no coinci¬dence that Reform Pedagogy, which was diametrically opposed to such overtones, should also have emerged at this point. The third period heralded in the dismantling of the authoritarian model of education and, in theory at least, proclaimed the break¬through of the emancipatory model. We have also attempted to capture the distinction between <b>internal</b> <b>dynamism</b> and external development — between continuity and discontinuity, if you will — by using conceptual tools such as 'hidden curriculum' and 'higher pedagogy', which have unmistakably pushed the micro-history of pedagogical behaviour in the direction ‘schooling'. We report on these efforts in the first chapter, which is devoted to ‘classroom history'. We finally decided to adopt pedagogical periodicals as our principal source. The selection of periodicals for further study was made according to the continuity-discontinuity hypothesis, based on predetermined criteria, such as ideological background (Catholic versus non¬ Catholic), pedagogical stance (progressive versus conservative) and practical involvement. In addition to these periodicals, unpublished reports from teachers' conferences 5 have also played an important part in the construction of our text. Our third and final main source con¬sisted of interviews carried out as part of earlier research, which have subsequently been complemented by new data. The content analyses of the source material were all encoded according to a predetermined system, stored in a database and prepared or further processing. This empirical data concerning the history of primary schooling is examined in chapters II to IV, with a view to identifying the specific shape of its educational mission. Curriculum analysis plays a central role, as objectives and subject matter form the link par excellence in the teaching process (related to the grammar of schooling). Chapters V—VII explore the underlying patterns of educational interaction related to the grammar of educationalisation) in isolation from the specific subject matter. The view of teacher and pupil, their recurring relationship patterns as reflected in rituals, punishment and reward, and externally expressed in the use of time and space, are the key elements of this part of the study. The conclusion, finally links our findings back to the initial questions and basic concepts. nrpages: 265 status: publishe...|$|E

Para isso, utilizaram-se dezenove indicadores econÃmicos e sociais que formaram o grau de desenvolvimento de cada municÃpio do ParanÃ no ano de 2004 e em 1979. Com esses dados, hierarquizou-se os municÃpios, classificando-os em desenvolvido, em desenvolvimento e subdesenvolvidos, estimando a influÃncia dos investimentos estatais (fatores exÃgenos) sobre o desenvolvimento econÃmico. Como resultado, evidenciaram-se trÃs linhas de conclusÃo: A primeira refere-se a complementariedade existente entre as variÃveis que formam o desenvolvimento econÃmico no ParanÃ e seus efeitos multiplicativos, fundamentais para o processo do desenvolvimento econÃmico. A segunda linha de conclusÃo refere-se ao perfil de desenvolvimento do Estado, verificando um aumento de municÃpios desenvolvidos e em desenvolvimento, com a formaÃÃo de dois corredores de desenvolvimento e de um aglomerado de municÃpios em desenvolvimento na regiÃo Oeste. Observou-se que os municÃpios em desenvolvimento e os desenvolvidos localizam-se principalmente nos extremos do Estado, prÃximos dos municÃpios que estavam em desenvolvimento no ano de 1979, sinalizando uma difusÃo do desenvolvimento por contigÃidade. JÃ, os municÃpios subdesenvolvidos localizam-se principalmente no Centro do Estado, regiÃo na qual nÃo se tinha praticamente nenhum municÃpio em desenvolvimento em 1979. A terceira linha de conclusÃo refere-se ao efeito que os investimentos do Estado tÃm sobre o desenvolvimento econÃmico. Essa associaÃÃo entre desenvolvimento e inversÃes estatais foi delineada atravÃs de um modelo de regressÃo quadrÃtica, na qual verificou-se que o aumento nos investimentos do Estado eleva o grau de desenvolvimento dos seus municÃpios, porÃm a taxas decrescentes. Desta forma, a aÃÃo do Estado no desenvolvimento dos municÃpios Ã relevante, com uma eficiÃncia maior das suas inversÃes no inÃcio de processo de desenvolvimento; porÃm, na medida que o Estado intensifica seus investimentos, disponibilizando uma melhor infra-estrutura, com maiores investimentos sociais e econÃmicos, cria-se um dinamismo interno que conduz por si sÃ o desenvolvimento econÃmico.

For that, nineteen economic and social indicators were used that formed the degree of development of each municipal district of ParanÃ in the year of 2004 and 1979. With those data, the municipal districts were ranked, being classified in developed, in development and underdeveloped, estimating the influence of the state investments (hexogen factors) on the economic development. As a result, three conclusion lines were evidenced: the first refers to the complementary existent among the variables that form the economic development in ParanÃ and their multiplying effects, fundamental for the process of the economic development. The second conclusion line refers to the process of the economic development of the State, verifying an increase of developed and in development municipal districts, with the formation of two development corridors and of an agglomerate of municipal districts in development in the West area. It was observed that the developed and in development municipal districts are located mainly in the edges of the State, close to the municipal districts that were in development in the year of 1979, signaling a diffusion of the development for proximity. The underdeveloped municipal districts are located mainly in the centre of the State, where there was not practically any municipal district in development in 1979. The third conclusion line refers to the effect that the investments of the State have on the economic development. That association between development and state inversions was delineated through a model of quadratic regression, in which it was verified that the increase in the investments of the State elevates the degree of development of their municipal districts, nonetheless to decreasing rates. This way the action of the State {{in the development of the}} municipal districts is relevant, with a larger efficiency of their inversions in the beginning of the development process; however, in the same rate that the State intensifies its investments, making available a better infrastructure, with larger social and economic investments, it is created an <b>internal</b> <b>dynamism</b> that drives the economic development by itself. Also, the influence of the State inversions on the development was regionally analyzed, verifying significant discrepancies as for the meaning of that relationship; nevertheless, independently of the magnitude and of the format of the relationship among those variables, the government of the State has a relevant participation in the economic development of the municipal districts of ParanÃ. And it should consider which form will be its performance in each area with the intention of not wasting either efforts or resources, promoting, indeed, a developmen...|$|E

Die Diskussion um Gentrification umfasst eine Vielzahl unterschiedlicher Themen und sehr kontroverse Standpunkte. Zudem verzeichnete das empirische Phänomen als auch die wissenschaftliche Forschung mehrere Konjunkturzyklen. Die theoretische und empirische Komplexität der Gentrification hat ihr den Ruf eines "chaotischen Konzeptes" eingebracht. Ziel des Textes ist es, eine Übersicht über den aktuellen Stand der Gentrificationforschung und die neuesten empirischen Erkenntnisse zu bieten. Diskutiert werden die Definitionen der Gentrification, die Geschichte der Gentrification und ihrer Erforschung, die Dimensionen der Gentrification, die Akteure der Gentrification, die Erklärungsmodelle der Gentrification, die Verlaufsmodelle der Gentrification und die unterschiedlichen Bewertungen der Gentrification. Wichtigste Ergebnisse sind, dass sich die Gentrification vom einstigen Konzept zur Wiederbelebung innenstadtnaher Wohnquartiere zu einer etablierten Strategie der Raumentwicklung gewandelt hat, die nicht nur auf Städte beschränkt bleibt, sondern inzwischen auch im ländlichen Räumen nachweisbar ist. Diese in bislang drei großen Wellen verlaufende Erfolgsgeschichte der Gentrification hat zu einer fast weltweiten Verbreitung des Phänomens geführt. Der jüngste Konjunkturzyklus ist seit Mitte der 1990 er Jahre zu beobachten und u. a. mit einer Ausweitung der Gentrification auf Großstädte in den ehemaligen Ostblockstaaten und einigen Metropolen der Dritten Welt verbunden. Der anfängliche Glaube diesen Prozess anhand einer einzigen, allgemeingültigen Theorie zu erklären, scheiterte an der Komplexität, Historizität, Selbstreferenz und Eigendynamik der Gentrification. Die Gentrification folgt keinen allgemeinen Gesetzen oder einfachen Kausalitäten, sondern ist ein sozialer, evolutionär entstandener Prozess, der in seiner lokalen Ausprägung ständig neu produziert und modifiziert wird. Insbesondere Investoren, Politiker und Planer haben gelernt, wie die Aufwertung von Bestandsquartieren initiiert und gefördert werden kann. Aber auch die "Anwälte der Betroffenen" kennen die Zeichen einer "drohenden" Aufwertung und Verdrängung sowie das Instrumentarium des Widerstandes. Die historisch individuellen Verläufe führen zu fallspezifischen Mustern der Gentrification. Für die Gentrificationforschung ergeben sich daraus folgende Notwendigkeiten und Konsequenzen: eine größere Offenheit des Konzeptes, da Gentrification in der Ausprägung ihrer vier Dimensionen und der räumlichen Verbreitung sehr variabel sein kann; eine sich daraus ergebende größere Bedeutung von detaillierten Fallanalysen aber zugleich auch Vergleiche der Gentrification in verschiedenen Städten/Quartieren und eine daraus abgeleitete Typisierung; eine genauere Untersuchung lokaler Politiken der Gentrification und lokaler Gentrificationdiskurse; eine vergleichende Diskussion und Bewertung der Untersuchungsmethoden der Gentrification. (Autorenreferat) The {{concept of}} {{gentrification}} {{has been the}} object of academic research and urban planning practice for more than forty years. The debate on gentrification encompasses {{a wide range of}} different issues and very controversial attitudes. In addition, the empirical phenomenon and its academic research have witnessed a series of ups and downs so that the theoretical and empirical complexity of gentrification has won it the reputation of being a "chaotic concept". This text has the goal of providing a cross-section of the current development of gentrification research including the latest empirical insights. It will discuss the various ways gentrification is defined, the history of gentrification, how it is researched, the dimensions of gentrification, the players in the process of gentrification, the models for explaining gentrification, the models of the process of gentrification and the various ways to analyse gentrification. Foremost findings are the fact that gentrification has transformed itself from a strategy once used for reviving living spaces in the proximity of the city centre to an established strategy for regional development. It not only continues to be concentrated on cities, but can also be detected in rural regions. The success story of gentrification has taken place in three great waves to date extending this phenomenon almost over the entire world. The latest set of ups and downs has been in evidence since the mid- 90 ’s and is linked with gentrification spreading to big cities in the states of the former Eastern Block and some big cities of the Third World. The initial belief that this process could be explained with a unified theory failed due to gentrification's complexity, historicity, self-referential character and <b>internal</b> <b>dynamism.</b> Gentrification does not follow any general laws or simple causalities. Instead, it is a social process that develops in an evolutionary fashion to constantly reinvent and modify itself in its particular local characteristic. Especially investors, policymakers and planners have learned how to launch and promote the enhancement of existing living spaces whose "advocates of gentrification victims" recognise the signs of "imminent" enhancement and displacement and know how to use the instruments for resisting these phenomena. Case-specific patterns of gentrification emerge from the historically individualised processes which spell out the following imperatives and consequences for gentrification research: opening up the concept of gentrification to a greater extent since it can be highly variable in its four dimensions and spatial spread; assigning greater significance to detailed case analyses while comparing the gentrification processes in various cities/districts to derive typifications; studying local policies on gentrification and local gentrification discourses more precisely; launching a comparative discussion and evaluation of the methods for studying gentrification.
