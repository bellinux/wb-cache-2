Polymeric witness plates are utilized to alleviate particle response issues that arise in gaseous flow fields containing shock waves and to allow measurements of shock-induced material velocities to be made using particle image velocimetry (PIV). Quantitative comparisons of velocity profiles across the shock waves in air and in PDMS are made to demonstrate the improved response achieved by the dynamic witness plate method. Schlieren photographs are used to complement analysis through direct visualization of detonator-induced shock waves in the witness plates...|$|E
40|$|Currently, the {{critical}} particle properties of pentaerythritol tetranitrate (PETN) that influence deflagration-to-detonation time in <b>exploding</b> <b>bridge</b> <b>wire</b> detonators (<b>EBW)</b> {{are not known}} in sufficient detail to allow development of a predictive failure model. The specific surface area (SSA) of many PETN powders has been measured using both permeametry and gas absorption methods and {{has been found to}} have a critical effect on EBW detonator performance. The permeametry measure of SSA is a function of particle shape, packed bed pore geometry, and particle size distribution (PSD). Yet there is a general lack of agreement in PSD measurements between laboratories, raising concerns regarding collaboration and complicating efforts to understand changes in EBW performance related to powder properties. Benchmarking of data between laboratories that routinely perform detailed PSD characterization of powder samples and the determination of the most appropriate method to measure each PETN powder are necessary to discern correlations between performance and powder properties and to collaborate with partnering laboratories. To this end, a comparison was made of the PSD measured by three laboratories using their own standard procedures for light scattering instruments. Three PETN powder samples with different surface areas and particle morphologies were characterized. Differences in bulk PSD data generated by each laboratory were found to result from variations in sonication of the samples during preparation. The effect of this sonication was found to depend on particle morphology of the PETN samples, being deleterious to some PETN samples and advantageous for others in moderation. Discrepancies in the submicron-sized particle characterization data were related to an instrument-specific artifact particular to one laboratory. The type of carrier fluid used by each laboratory to suspend the PETN particles for the light scattering measurement had no consistent effect on the resulting PSD data. Finally, the SSA of the three powders was measured using both permeametry and gas absorption methods, enabling the PSD to be linked to the SSA for these PETN powders. Consistent characterization of other PETN powders can be performed using the appropriate sample-specific preparation method, so that future studies can accurately identify the effect of changes in the PSD on the SSA and ultimately model EBW performance...|$|R
40|$|Streak cameras, either {{electronic}} or rotating mirror, {{are common}} diagnostic tools used to explore very fast phenomena. Often {{they are used}} to precisely time events or durations, and in most cases, {{it is important to have}} quality time marks on the film record. Many methods have been used to introduce time marks onto the film. <b>Exploding</b> <b>bridge</b> <b>wires</b> are frequently used, but they light up slowly and are difficult to read with consistent accuracy. It is also difficult to put more than a few <b>bridge</b> <b>wires</b> in the view of a camera slit, so there are only a few timing marks written to the film. In some cases the time scale on the film must be interpolated over long distances, creating a significant loss of accuracy. Interpolation is especially troublesome with those cameras that have a nonlinear sweep rate. Spark gaps located on the camera slit turn on a bit faster, but suffer from the same interpolation induced errors. A series of short duration laser pulses, accurately timed and introduced along the edges of the film, is a very fine solution. The problem with such a laser fiducial system is that the lasers are very expensive and difficult to maintain. There has been a need for many years for an inexpensive, very bright light source that can be repetitively pulsed accurately and with short duration. Various technologies have sufficiently developed over the past few years, allowing us to build a fiducial system based on light emitting diodes (LED) for the Cordin rotating mirror streak cameras...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{reviews and}} {{summarizes}} prior work related to low frequency (< 100 Hz) EMP (ElectroMagnetic Pulse) observed from explosions. It focuses on how EMP signals might, or might not, {{be useful in}} monitoring underground nuclear tests, based on the limits of detection, and physical understanding of these signals. In summary: (1) Both chemical and nuclear explosions produce an EMP. (2) The amplitude of the EMP from underground explosions is at least two orders of magnitude lower than from above ground explosions and higher frequency components of the signal are rapidly attenuated due to ground conductivity. (3) In general, in the near field, that is distances (r) of less than 10 s of kilometers from the source, the amplitude of the EMP decays approximately as 1 /r{sup 3 }, which practically limits EMP applications to very close (<{approx} 1 km) distances. (4) One computational model suggests that the EMP from a decoupled nuclear explosion may be enhanced over the fully coupled case. This has not been validated with laboratory or field data. (5) The magnitude of the EMP from an underground nuclear explosion is about two orders of magnitude larger than that from a chemical explosion, and has a larger component of higher frequencies. In principle these differences {{might be used to}} discriminate a nuclear from a chemical explosion using sensors at very close (<{approx} 1 km) distances. (6) Arming and firing systems (e. g. detonators, <b>exploding</b> <b>bridge</b> <b>wires)</b> can also produce an EMP from any type of explosion. (7) To develop the understanding needed to apply low frequency EMP to nuclear explosion monitoring, it is recommended to carry out a series of controlled underground chemical explosions with a variety of sizes, emplacements (e. g. fully coupled and decoupled), and arming and firing systems...|$|R
40|$|The {{hypervelocity}} impact (1. 25 to 6 km/sec) of projectiles {{into water}} has been studied at the University of Arizona by Gault and Sonett. They observed quite different behavior of the water cavity as it expanded when the atmospheric pressure was reduced from one to a tenth atmosphere. Above {{about a third of}} an atmosphere, a jet of water formed above the expanding bubble and a jet or “root” emerged below the bottom of the bubble. Similar results were observed by Kedrinskii at the Institute of Hydrodynamics in Novosibirsk, Russia when the water cavity was generated by <b>exploding</b> <b>bridge</b> <b>wires</b> with jets and roots forming for normal atmospheric pressure and not for reduced pressures. Earlier at the Los Alamos National Laboratory B. G. Craig, reported observing the formation of jets and roots while the gas cavity was expanding by bubbles generated by small spherical explosives detonated near the water surface. During the last decade a compressible Eulerian hydrodynamic code called SAGE has been under development by the Los Alamos National Laboratory and Science Applications International (SAIC) which has continuous adaptive mesh refinement (AMR) for following shocks and contact discontinuities with a very fine grid while using a coarse grid in smooth flow regions. A version of the SAGE code that models explosives called NOBEL has been used to model the experimental geometries of Sonett and of Craig. The experimental observations were reproduced as the atmospheric pressure was varied. When the atmospheric pressure was increased the difference between the pressure outside the ejecta plume above the water cavity and the decreasing pressure inside the water plume and cavity as it expanded resulted in the ejecta plume converging and colliding at the axis forming a jet of water proceeding above and back into the bubble cavity along the axis. The jet proceeding back thru the bubble cavity penetrates the bottom of the cavity and forms the root observed experimentally. The complicated bubble collapse and resulting cavity descent into deeper water was numerically reproduced. Now that a code is available that can describe the experimentally observed features of projectile interaction with the ocean, we have a tool {{that can be used to}} evaluate impact landslide, projectile or asteroid interactions with the ocean and the resulting generation of tsunami waves...|$|R

40|$|This study {{explored}} {{the development of}} various printed metallic initiators. The purpose was to create an initiator that could easily be integrated with a printed energetic material, specifically, a liquid suspension of nanothermite. Printing the initiator allowed for precise control and easy manipulation of the geometry. Thus, the geometry could be custom made for various applications. ^ <b>Bridge</b> <b>wire</b> initiators were first investigated due to their presence in current initiation systems. A <b>bridge</b> <b>wire</b> is a thin wire that a high electrical current is sent through. The current causes the <b>bridge</b> <b>wire</b> to heat and can ignite an energetic material, if it reaches the material 2 ̆ 7 s critical ignition temperature. If the current heats the <b>bridge</b> <b>wire</b> faster than it can expand in response, the <b>bridge</b> <b>wire</b> will break and the resulting shock can ignite the energetic material. <b>Bridge</b> <b>wires</b> of various length were tested {{to determine how the}} length affects the breakage time. In addition, the <b>bridge</b> <b>wires</b> were tested under various voltages (between 7. 5 V and 13. 75 V). It was found that increasing the voltage decreased the break time. Finally, a nanothermite [nano-aluminum and nano-bismuth (III) oxide] was pipetted on to the <b>bridge</b> <b>wires.</b> Ignition of the energetic material from the breaking of the wire was achieved, but it proved unreliable due to various factors including, but not limited to, print quality. ^ The <b>bridge</b> <b>wires</b> were subsequently tested {{as a part of a}} circuit with a wireless trigger. The <b>bridge</b> <b>wires</b> were able to break through the energetic material at 15 V, but did not ignite the nanothermite [nano-aluminum and nano-copper (II) oxide]. This indicates that the <b>bridge</b> <b>wire</b> did not heat enough to ignite the nanothermite or that the shock produced from breaking the wire was not enough to ignite the material. Further investigation into the effect of the length of the <b>bridge</b> <b>wire</b> on ignition and the use of different nanothermites will be conducted in future work. ^ To explore alternative geometries, spark gap initiators of various sizes were also printed. A spark gap was created by printing two conducting electrodes close enough to each other to allow an electric spark to jump between them. The breakdown voltage for the spark gaps varied, but reliable spark over occurred under 5 kV and 50 μA. The ability to create a printed initiator integrated with printed energetic material was also demonstrated. Printed nanothermite [nano-aluminum and nano-copper (II) oxide] was placed in the center of a spark gap, covering both electrodes. The spark gaps required a much higher voltage to achieve ignition of the energetic material than the <b>bridge</b> <b>wires,</b> but for the utilized geometry, they achieved a significantly higher reliability. For ignition, 5 kV proved sufficient but the current required was 75 μA. ^ Overall, the successful printing of metallic initiators was demonstrated. <b>Bridge</b> <b>wire</b> and spark gap initiator geometries were created and tested. The ignition of energetic material for the different initiator types was demonstrated. ...|$|R
