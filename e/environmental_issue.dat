5|$|The {{government}} recognises {{that there}} are no viable alternative aviation fuels, and whilst it accepts that the exemption of aviation fuel from fuel tax is anomalous, it sees no scope for a unilateral approach in addressing this. The strategy adopted in the White Paper seeks to mitigate the global impact of air transport primarily through emissions trading schemes. Although the Kyoto Protocol implemented emissions trading as a means to reduce emissions at national levels, the global nature of air transport means that all air travel is excluded from this mechanism. The government is seeking to redress this through the International Civil Aviation Organisation (ICAO), which has been working on the <b>environmental</b> <b>issue</b> since 1998, but progress is slow. In the meantime efforts are being made to include aviation in the EU Emission Trading Scheme (EU ETS) with an original target to implement this by 2008. In 2006 the government re-affirmed this policy as the best approach for addressing the climate change impacts of aviation, and current proposals aim at accomplishing this for all flights within the EU by 2011, with the scheme being extended to include all flights to and from the EU the following year.|$|E
5|$|Sarawak's {{rain forests}} are {{primarily}} {{threatened by the}} logging industry and palm oil plantations. The issue of human rights of the Penan and deforestation in Sarawak became an international <b>environmental</b> <b>issue</b> when Swiss activist Bruno Manser visited Sarawak regularly between 1984 and 2000. Deforestation has affected the life of indigenous tribes, especially the Penan, whose livelihood is heavily dependent on forest produce. This led to several blockades by indigenous tribes during the 1980s and 1990s against logging companies encroaching on their lands. There have also been cases where Native Customary Rights (NCR) lands {{have been given to}} timber and plantation companies without the permission of the locals. The indigenous people have resorted to legal means to reinstate their NCR. In 2001 the High Court of Sarawak fully reinstated the NCR land claimed by the Rumah Nor people, but this was overturned partially in 2005. However, this case has served as a precedent, leading to more NCR being upheld by the high court in the following years. Sarawak's mega-dam policies, such as the Bakun Dam and Murum Dam projects, have submerged thousands of hectares of forest and displaced thousands of indigenous people. Since 2013, the proposed Baram Dam project has been delayed due to ongoing protests from local indigenous tribes. Since 2014, the Sarawak government under chief minister Adenan Satem started to take action against illegal logging in the state and to diversify the economy of the state. Through the course of 2016 over 2 million acres of forest, much of it in orangutan habitats, were declared protected areas.|$|E

25|$|Pollination of {{food crops}} {{has become an}} <b>environmental</b> <b>issue,</b> due to two trends. The trend to {{monoculture}} means that greater concentrations of pollinators are needed at bloom time than ever before, yet the area is forage poor or even deadly to bees {{for the rest of}} the season. The other trend is the decline of pollinator populations, due to pesticide misuse and overuse, new diseases and parasites of bees, clearcut logging, decline of beekeeping, suburban development, removal of hedges and other habitat from farms, and public concern about bees. Widespread aerial spraying for mosquitoes due to West Nile fears is causing an acceleration of the loss of pollinators.|$|E
25|$|Another recent <b>environmental</b> <b>issue</b> in Melbourne was the Victorian {{government}} {{project of}} channel deepening Melbourne Ports by dredging Port Phillip Bay—the Port Phillip Channel Deepening Project.

Other major pollution problems in Melbourne include levels of bacteria including E. coli in the Yarra River and its tributaries caused by septic systems, as well as litter. Up to 350,000 cigarette butts enter the storm water runoff every day. Several programs are being implemented to minimise beach and river pollution. In February 2010, The Transition Decade, an initiative to transition human society, economics and environment towards sustainability, was launched in Melbourne.|$|E
25|$|Sea turtle {{conservation}} groups have publicized concerns that dense V. rotundifolia growth may prevent sea turtles from reaching acceptable nesting sites.

A recent USA Today article mentioned these concerns {{as part of an}} effort to raise awareness of V. rotundifolia, and has at least one review article. However, these concerns have not been validated scientifically. Several sea turtle species nest along the coasts of the Carolinas. These include the endangered loggerhead turtle (Caretta caretta), the endangered green turtle (Chelonia mydas), and the critically endangered Kemp's Ridley (Lepidochelys kempii). If scientific evidence is found to support claims that V. rotundifolia harms sea turtles, this threat would constitute a substantial <b>environmental</b> <b>issue.</b>|$|E

25|$|One of Broad's first {{challenges}} as an incoming minister was {{to deal with}} the fate of the Snowy River, which had diminished to a trickle as a result of being dammed for various purposes. Though it had been an <b>environmental</b> <b>issue</b> for many years, it became of particular concern to the Bracks government, as the issue was central to the support of independent Craig Ingram, who they relied on to retain a majority in parliament. It fell to Broad, as the relevant minister, to handle negotiations on the issue with both the federal and New South Wales state governments. Despite the involvement of a number of conflicting interests, a major agreement was reached between the three parties in October 2000. This saw A$160 million put towards regenerating the river, with the intention of increasing its water flow to 28% of its original capacity.|$|E

The Burigana River in Bangladesh is now black in colour and pronounced biologically dead because neighbouring leather tanneries are discharging more than 20000 cubics of liquid waste daily. (Stanko, 2013) The daily life of local people is significantly affected as Buriganga River is their source of bathing, irrigation and transportation. Many workers in the tanneries suffer from serious skin illness since they are exposed to toxic chemicals for long period of time.

25|$|Opponents {{say that}} nuclear power poses many threats {{to people and}} the environment, and that costs do not justify benefits. Threats include health risks and {{environmental}} damage from uranium mining, processing and transport, the risk of nuclear weapons proliferation or sabotage, and the unsolved problem of radioactive nuclear waste. Another <b>environmental</b> <b>issue</b> is discharge of hot water into the sea. The hot water modifies the environmental conditions for marine flora and fauna. They also contend that reactors themselves are enormously complex machines where many things can and do go wrong, {{and there have been}} many serious nuclear accidents. Critics do not believe that these risks can be reduced through new technology. They argue that when all the energy-intensive stages of the nuclear fuel chain are considered, from uranium mining to nuclear decommissioning, nuclear power is not a low-carbon electricity source. Those countries that do not contain uranium mines cannot achieve energy independence through existing nuclear power technologies. Actual construction costs often exceed estimates, and spent fuel management costs do not have a clear time limit.|$|E

500|$|The koala {{was heavily}} hunted by European {{settlers}} in the early 20th century, largely for its thick, soft fur. More than two million pelts are estimated to have left Australia by 1924. Pelts were in demand for use in rugs, coat linings, muffs, and as trimming on women's garments. Extensive cullings occurred in Queensland in 1915, 1917, and again in 1919, when over one million koalas were killed with guns, poisons, and nooses. The public outcry over these cullings was probably the first wide-scale <b>environmental</b> <b>issue</b> that rallied Australians. Novelist and social critic Vance Palmer, writing {{in a letter to}} The Courier-Mail, expressed the popular sentiment: [...] "The shooting of our harmless and lovable native bear is nothing less than barbarous... No one has ever accused him of spoiling the farmer's wheat, eating the squatter's grass, or even the spreading of the prickly pear. There is no social vice that can be put down to his account... He affords no sport to the gun-man... And he has been almost blotted out already from some areas." [...] Despite the growing movement to protect native species, the poverty brought about by the drought of 1926–28 led to the killing of another 600,000 koalas during a one-month open season in August 1927. In 1934, Frederick Lewis, the Chief Inspector of Game in Victoria, said that the once-abundant animal had been brought to near extinction in that state, suggesting that only 500–1000 remained.|$|E

40|$|Thesis (M. Environmental Management) [...] North-West University, Potchefstroom Campus, 2012. Sustainable {{development}} is achieved through {{the consideration of}} environmental, social and economic factors in planning and decision making. However, even though the environmental right contained in section 24 of the South African Constitution indirectly requires land use and planning instruments to incorporate <b>environmental</b> <b>issues,</b> developments approved by local authorities suggest that land use decisions at local level exclude environmental considerations. The main {{aim of the research}} is therefore to critically analyse whether <b>environmental</b> <b>issues</b> are incorporated in land use and planning instruments within selected municipalities of Ehlanzeni District. The research methods applied in the study include case study selection approach, document review, literature review and interviews. The research mostly identified areas of weaknesses within land use and planning instruments where <b>environmental</b> <b>issues</b> are incorporated to a limited extent or not at all. This compromises the quest for sustainable development since it was found that <b>environmental</b> <b>issues</b> are also consequently not incorporated in decision making. The research has revealed that reasons for not incorporating <b>environmental</b> <b>issues</b> in planning decisions is the lack of incorporation of <b>environmental</b> <b>issues</b> in land use and planning instruments and a lack of understanding and knowledge of the legal requirements regarding <b>environmental</b> <b>issues.</b> Alignment of land use planning tools with environmental legal requirements and tools, development of checklist, capacity building, and appointment of environmental officers and development of strategies for policy implementation are recommended measures to improve land use and planning instruments.
