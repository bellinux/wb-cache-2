40|$|Territorial {{behavior}} of Broad-tailed (Selasphorous platycercus) and Rufous (Selasphorous rufus) hummingbirds in Colorado was measured at sites with feeders containing 10 %, 20 %, and 30 % sucrose solutions, respectively. The {{presence or absence}} of territory <b>holders,</b> <b>number</b> of intruders, and intensity of defense were measured at the three levels of energy availability. Migrating Rufous Hummingbirds displaced Broad-tailed Hummingbirds from territories they had defended during the breeding season; Broad-tailed Hummingbirds then defended only lower quality sites. Both Broad-tailed and Rufous hummingbirds employed more energetically expensive behaviors when defending high quality sites, with longer chases more often supplemented with chip calls and hovering. Other investigators have suggested that chip calls and hovering are precursors to a chase. However, I found that chasing was the default response to the presence of an intruder. Chip calls and hovering were added to intensify a chase. In the few cases where chip calls were uttered or hovering occurred without a chase, Rufous Hummingbirds were more likely to exhibit this behavior than Broad-tailed Hummingbirds...|$|E
40|$|Plastic cards have {{invaded the}} {{monetary}} {{market as a}} payment instrument used to purchase goods and services. There are several types of plastic cards in the circulation namely, credit cards, debit cards, charge cards, stored value cards and smart cards. The first credit card used to eliminate the need to carry cash was the Mobil Oil, USA card issued in 1914 and the first form of charge card was the Diners card, which was used by businessmen in the 1950 's to purchase meals on an expense account. Since then, a variety of cards have been introduced to customers that have a multitude of functions for their daily transactional needs. The numbers of individuals that rely on cards have increased {{from year to year}} and presently the plastic card has become an indispensable instrument in the money wallet. Among all the different types of plastic cards, the most favoured by customers is the credit card. Statistics provided by Bank Negara Malaysia indicate that as at August 2007, principal card <b>holders</b> <b>number</b> 8. 22 million; supplementary card holders' number 1. 15 million; and in August 2007 the number of credit card transactions using (local and foreign) credit cards totaled 20. 21 million. 2 The credit card appears to be the most favourite plastic card among Malaysians. However, the downside of owning the credit card is the danger of it being used by unauthorized third parties to illegally purchase goods/services or to withdraw moneys/credit advances from the automated teller machine. Is the consumer protected from incurring the liability of such illegal transactions? The writer will discuss the extent of legal protection afforded by banking laws In protecting innocent bank customers from being burdened with illegal transactions conducted in his name...|$|E

40|$|The {{sensitivity}} of a multiple eigenvalue of a matrix under perturbations {{can be measured}} by its <b>Hölder</b> condition <b>number.</b> Various extensions of this concept are considered. A meaningful notion of structured <b>Hölder</b> condition <b>numbers</b> is introduced and it is shown that many existing results on structured condition numbers for simple eigenvalues carry over to multiple eigenvalues. The structures investigated in more detail include real, Toeplitz, Hankel, symmetric, skew-symmetric, Hamiltonian, and skew-Hamiltonian matrices. Furthermore, unstructured and structured <b>Hölder</b> condition <b>numbers</b> for multiple eigenvalues of matrix pencils are introduced. Particular attention is given to symmetric/skew-symmetric, Hermitian and palindromic pencils. It is also shown how matrix polynomial eigenvalue problems can be covered within this framework. ...|$|R
