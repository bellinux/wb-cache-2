Available at [URL] The topic covered in this thesis is medical temperature measurement of subcutaneous parts of human tissue with use of microwave radiometry. Radiometry is a completely non-invasive, non-toxic and relatively inexpensive sensing modality. The radiometric technique {{is based on the}} measurement of electromagnetic noise power emitted by lossy materials. The method has explicit low investment costs and low technological complexity, but relatively low spatial resolution. Still the method can be useful for some dedicated medical applications. Fundamental radiometric theory and dielectrical properties of biological tissues are derived. The process to realize a miniaturized radiometer is going from active antenna configuration to a complete miniaturized radiometer and finally to a modular radiometer, that is used in-vivo on humans. Different radiometers were designed, simulated, built and tested on realistic human phantoms. In vivo experiments were also conducted to verify the prototype radiometer and to test the ability to be used in tailored medical diagnostics. The primary application covered is temperature gradient measurement during microwave hyperthermia and in pediatric vesicouretaral reflux (VUR) detection. Hyperthermia is a therapeutic technique in which cancerous tissue is heated to 40 - 45 ^∘C, inducing vascular and cellular changes that improve the therapeutic effectiveness when used in conjunction with chemotherapy or radiation therapy. VUR is abnormal flow of urine from the bladder back to the upper urinary tract. Another application where this radiometer can be of great interest is in breast cancer diagnostic. Breast cancer is a type of cancer that forms in tissues of the breast; usually in the ducts and lobules and can occur in both men and woman. We present results from radiometric measurement on human phantoms during a hyperthermia heating sequence. Experimental evidence shows that radiometry can be used for temperature quality assurance of the heated volume in depth. In VUR detection, {{the first step is to}} heat the bladder prior to detection of the reflux. We present results from measurements in-vivo with a water filled balloon in the human mouth, that mimics pediatric bladder heating. Results show that the radiometer can be used as the first step in the novel VUR detection. Radiometry antennas are one of the most critical components in a radiometer system. An elliptical printed circuit board antenna is designed and matched to the human body. Further, an antenna with suction, with use of negative pressure to mount the antenna onto the human body for improved radiometric performance, was also proposed and built. The simple and elegant solution for the coupling of the antenna with use of negative pressure, documents improved performance in estimating the true temperature as well as exhibiting smaller fluctuation in the radiometric signal. Bakgrunnen for avhandlingen er at nåværende metoder som brukes til screening av brystkreft hos kvinner er røntgenbaserte gjennomlysningsmetoder med assosierte utfordringer som tilgjengelighet og stor grad av feildiagnostisering. Videre er vesicouretral refluks en tilstand med tilbakestrøm av urin fra blære, opp via urinleder til nyre, og som i visse tilfeller kan forårsake nyreskade. Denne diagnosen blir ofte stilt i barneår, hvor barnet da må i gjennom diagnostiske prosedyrer som kan oppleves smertefulle. Vi ønsker å finne ut om det er mulig å lage et lite og fungerende mikrobølgeinstrument som er fullstendig ufarlig for pasienten og som kan brukes til medisinsk diagnostikk av disse sykdommene. Vi har designet, simulert og bygget et mikrobølgeinstrument som på fagspråk betegnes et radiometer. Radiometeret er bygget av kommersielt masseproduserte og lett tilgjengelige komponenter. Ved å velge en slik konstruksjonsmetode, kan kostnadene <b>holdes</b> nede og størrelsen på selve instrumentet blir minimalisert. Deteksjonsprinsippet som ligger til grunn for instrumenteringen er å måle naturlig varmestråling fra kroppen for å kunne avdekke temperaturdifferanser inne i selve vevet. Det er kjent fra studier at kreftsvulster har høyere temperatur (opptil 5 C) enn normalt friskt vev. Denne temperaturkontrasten kan man avlese med dette instrumentet om temperaturdifferansen er tilstrekkelig høy. Videre kan instrumentet potensielt brukes i en helt ny metode for detektering av refluks av urin fra blære til nyrer. Instrumenteringen har vært testet på mennesker, hvor man har klart å lage et måleoppsett som simulerer oppvarming av en pediatrisk blære. Denne oppvarmingen av blæren er en forutsetning for videre deteksjon av refluks av urin fra blære til en eller begge nyrene...|$|R

40|$|I {{will review}} the drastic change seen in herd {{composition}} and slaughtering strategy the last decades in the reindeer husbandry of Fennoscandia (i. e. Finland, Norway and Sweden). Herd composition was traditionally {{a function of the}} multipurpose herd, where reproduction of draught power played a major role. Hence, the slaughter scheme was based on adult males, in particular castrates. The herd represented the owner's capital and was viewed as the best insurance for staying in business. Indeed, a big and well composed herd announced social status as well as authority. Historically this has resulted in rises and falls in reindeer numbers. Control of the herd was being emphasized through age and sex composition and selection of behavioural traits and easily recognisable animals which favour handling. A high proportion of adults alleviated control of the herd as it eased the herding and reduced the mortality risk as they were able to withstand the highly stochastic environment. The introduction of the snowmobiles in the 1960 s revolutionized the herding and transportation and hence reduced the importance of the male segment of the herd and amplified the ongoing transformation of the modern society into a market based economy. Now, the challenge was to efficiently convert the limited primary plant production into animal product, mainly meat. This is primarily achieved by balancing the animal numbers in accordance to the forage resources. However, also herd composition and slaughtering strategy are essential for maximizing the meat output per area unit. A highest possible proportion of reproductive females combined with a slaughtering scheme based on calves was tested and partly implemented in Soviet-Union already in the 1930 s and introduced in the 1960 s in Finland. Also in parts of Norway and Sweden this scheme was modified and tested. However, the formal work of refining and testing this new strategy based on modern population theory blended with traditional knowledge, started in Riast/Hylling reindeer herding district in southern Norway in the early 1970 s and was completed around 1985. The work was followed up in Ruvhten Sitje (earlier called Tännäs Sameby), the neighbouring herding community of Riast/Hylling on the Swedish side of the border. In its stringent form the modern herd should comprise the highest proportion possible of reproductive females. The stocking rate should be adjusted to allow females to reproduce early; preferably at an age of 1. 5 year, and {{they should be able to}} raise calves successfully every year. The male segment should be large enough to serve the females successfully during rut. Using 1. 5 years old males as breeding bulls means that they can be slaughtered after rut. The culling should primarily aim at calves and removal of females reaching reproductive senescence, normally at around 12 years of age. Only the best female calves are selected as replacement of the senescence females slaughtered and the best male calves are selected as breeding bulls for the next year's rut. Calculations suggest that this new herd composition and slaughtering strategy could increase the meat production per area unit by around 50 % compared to a traditional herd composition and off take scheme. However, such a strategy necessitates a strict control of environmental factors, including forage resources, as well as predators and human disturbance. Breeding programme based on selection on autumn calf weight has been proven successful. This work has been carried out in Ruvhten Sitje. The challenge is to establish appropriate breeding objectives in an ever changing environment. Selection for only calf weight may lead to improvement of capacity of growth only, which necessitates improvement of the environment in order to realize the genetic potential. Emphasize on maternal ability may lead to increase efficiency. To secure the genetic improvement in an open nucleus breeding scheme, with partly different breeding goals and different dedication to the breeding work is challenging. As the female part of the herd has been in focus in this research I will evaluate the importance of the male segment for offspring performance and herd productivity based on a 10 years study in the experimental research herd in Kaamanen, Finland. The results confirm basically the findings from Riast/Hylling and Ruvhten Sitje; 10 % of 1. 5 years old males in good shape are sufficient to secure normal pregnancy rate, a synchronous rut and early parturition and hence a decent production output. I {{will review the}} "state of the art" and the biological challenges and limitations in applying such a "modern" production strategy. Today herd composition and slaughtering strategies vary and are modifications of the modern strategy developed adjusted according to natural condition, social settings and the production objectives. However, in many areas the variable grazing pressure makes the implementation of the model difficult. New products call for new adaptations. This is seen locally where products related to eco-tourism and so called ecological services (for example keeping up the semi-natural grazing induced vegetation types and serving as prey for the predators). This will call for new compositions of the herd and new slaughtering strategies. Accordingly herd composition has to be put in a historical context. Flokkstruktur og slaktestrategi i reindrifta - et historisk perspektiv Abstract in Norwegian / Sammendrag: I denne oversiktsartikkelen vil jeg gjennomgå bakgrunnen for den drastiske omleggingen av flokkstruktur og slaktestrategi som har funnet sted i reindrifta i Fennoskandia de siste tiårene. Tradisjonelt var flokkstrukturen sterkt påvirket av behovet for trekkdyr, og slakteuttaket var i stor grad basert på voksne bukker, spesielt kastrater. Akkumulasjon av dyr var ansett som den beste forsikringen for fortsatt drift og ga status og makt. Dette førte til relativt store svingninger i tamreintallet. Et høyt innslag av voksne dyr sikret kontroll over flokken da de var lettere å gjete og bedre i stand til å takle harde vintre. Det materielle grunnlaget for omleggingen av flokkstruktur og slaktestrategi var innføringen av mekanisert trekkraft; særlig snøskuteren på 1960 -tallet, kombinert med en markedsøkonomi basert på kjøttproduksjon. Det biologiske utgangspunktet er en begrenset beiteressurs som må utnyttes optimalt. Dette gjøres primært gjennom å tilpasse beitebelegget til ressursgrunnlaget. Men også flokksammensetningen og en tilpasset slaktestrategi er avgjørende for hvor mange kilo kjøtt en kan høste på et gitt areal. Innen reindrifta var en høy simleandel kombinert med slakt av kalver allerede utprøvd i Sovjetunionen på 1930 -tallet og vant innpass i finsk reindrift på 1960 -tallet. En slik omlegging ble modifisert og utprøvd også i enkelte områder i Norge og Sverige, og diskusjonen gikk høyt om dens berettigelse. Arbeidet med å utvikle og etterprøve denne nye strategien basert på moderne produksjonsteori og tradisjonell kunnskap startet for fullt i Riast/Hylling reinbeitedistrikt i Sør-Norge i begynnelsen av 1970 -tallet og ble avsluttet rundt 1985. Dette arbeidet ble videreført i Ruvhten Sitje (tidligere Tännäs Sameby). I sin rendyrkede form innebærer den nye flokkstrukturen en høyest mulig andel simler i vinterflokken. Disse reproduserer og fostrer årlig opp kalver slik at flest mulig er i live og i godt hold første høst. Antall bukker <b>holdes</b> på et minimum, men høyt nok til å sikre full bedekking. Slaktestrategien tilpasses denne flokkstrukturen ved at de fleste kalvene slaktes; bare de beste settes på til livdyr eller parringsbukker. Dette betyr at simlene utrangeres når aldringen begynner å påvirke reproduksjonen negativt, normalt ved 12 års alder. Bruk av 1, 5 -årige parringsbukker innebærer at disse kan slaktes etter brunst. Som et resultat blir vinterflokken bestående av produktive simler pluss påsettet av simlekalver til livdyr og bukkekalver til bedekking av simlene neste høst. Beregninger viser at en ved å optimalisere flokksammensetningen etter slike kriterier kan øke slakteuttaket per arealenhet med rundt 50 % sammenlignet med en tradisjonell struktur og uttak. Dette krever imidlertid kontroll med miljøet gjennom en god beitebalanse og med andre miljøfaktorer som rovvilt og menneskelig forstyrrelse. Utvalg av framtidige mordyr og avlsbukker, basert på simlekalvenes og bukkekalvenes høstvekt har vist seg å gi en avlsmessig framgang. Dette arbeidet har vært utført i Ruvhten Sitje. Utfordringen i avlsarbeidet er valg av utvalgskriterier i et variabelt miljø. Ensidig vekt på kalvetilvekst kan innebære ensidig avl for kapasitet, noe som krever styrking av miljøet for å kunne realisere det genetiske potensialet. Vektlegging av morsegenskaper kan imidlertid øke dyrenes effektivitet. Å sikre den genetiske framgangen i et åpent system (liten kontroll over hanndyrsegmentet) med uensartede avlsmål og ulik grad av bevisst avlsarbeid blant reineierne er også en utfordring. Siden simlesegmentet har vært i fokus i dette arbeidet, vil jeg vurdere bukkesegmentets betydning for produksjonsresultatet basert på forskning utført i forsøksflokken i Kaamanen de siste ti årene. Funnene herfra samsvarer i all hovedsak med Rørosmodellens anbefalinger om at rundt 10 % 1, 5 -årige bukker i godt hold sikrer full bedekking, en tilfredsstillende synkronisering av brunsten og en tidlig kalving og dermed et godt produksjonsresultat. Særlig en tidlig kalving og konsentrert kalving er avgjørende. Jeg vil gå gjennom disse nye strategiene og de biologiske utfordringer og begrensinger som ligger i dem. Flokkstrukturen og slaktestrategien i reindrifta i dag kjennetegnes av stor diversitet og modifiseringer av Rørosmodellen ut fra naturgitte og sosiale forhold og ulike produksjonsmål. Det er imidlertid klart at misstilpasninger i beitebruken mange steder gjør det vanskelig å gjennomføre modellen. Produksjonsspektret er imidlertid stadig i endring og må tilpasses lokalt. Andre produkter knyttet til turisme og såkalte økologiske tjenester, for eksempel opprettholdelse av det åpne, kulturpåvirkede beitelandskapet i fjellet og mat til rovdyr som storsamfunnet vil ta vare på, vil betinge nye flokkstrukturer og slaktestrategier. </p...|$|R
