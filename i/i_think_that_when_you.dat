6000|$|... "No," [...] {{answered}} Ingleby contritely, with a {{trace of}} confusion. [...] "Certainly not. I would never have offered, only we are such old friends; and <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>when</b> <b>you</b> brought that hat home after buying it you {{let me put it}} on for you." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Wait {{till you}} see him in uniform, Mabel," [...] Mr. Penfold went on. [...] "I am afraid that respect {{is one of the}} moral qualities in which you are deficient. Still <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>when</b> <b>you</b> see Ralph in his uniform, you will be struck with awe." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "It isn't a {{question}} of 'me.' Everybody's omelet is made of somebody's eggs. Besides, <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>when</b> we're alone together--!" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Certainly. But <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>when</b> {{they see}} the {{regiment}} marching along, and hear the bugles, they will clear out fast enough of their own accord." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I do {{not want}} to do that, {{as long as we can}} {{possibly}} stay here. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>that,</b> <b>when</b> night comes, we ought to make a sortie." ...|$|R
60|$|In {{regard to}} the general history of the expedition, and of the manners, customs, religion, and {{politics}} of Carthage, I have followed M. Hennebert in his most exhaustive and important work on the subject. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>when</b> <b>you</b> have read to the end you will perceive that although our sympathies may remain with Hannibal and the Carthaginians, it was nevertheless {{for the good of}} the world that Rome was the conqueror in the great struggle for empire. At the time the war began Carthage was already corrupt to the core, and although she might have enslaved many nations she would never have civilized them. Rome gave free institutions to the people she conquered, she subdued but she never enslaved them, but rather strove to plant her civilization among them and to raise them to her own level. Carthage, on the contrary, was from the first a cruel mistress to the people she conquered. Consequently while all the peoples of Italy rallied round Rome in the days of her distress, the tribes subject to Carthage rose in insurrection against her as soon as the presence of a Roman army gave them a hope of escape from their bondage.|$|E
60|$|It is my {{conviction}} {{that there should}} always be some water in a view--a lake or a river, but not the ocean, if you are down on its level. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>when</b> <b>you</b> are down on its level it seldom inflames you with an ecstasy which you could {{not get out of}} a sand-flat. It is like being on board ship, over again; indeed it is worse than that, for there's three months of it. On board ship one tires of the aspects in a couple of days, and quits looking. The same vast circle of heaving humps is spread around you all the time, with you in the centre of it and never gaining an inch on the horizon, so far as you can see; for variety, a flight of flying-fish, mornings; a flock of porpoises throwing summersaults afternoons; a remote whale spouting, Sundays; occasional phosphorescent effects, nights; every other day a streak of black smoke trailing along under the horizon; on the one single red letter day, the illustrious iceberg. I have seen that iceberg thirty-four times in thirty-seven voyages; it is always the same shape, it is always the same size, it always throws up the same old flash when the sun strikes it; you may set it on any New York door-step of a June morning and light it up with a mirror-flash; and I will engage to recognize it. It is artificial, and it is provided and anchored out by the steamer companies. I used to like the sea, but I was young then, and could easily get excited over any kind of monotony, and keep it up till the monotonies ran out, if it was a fortnight.|$|E
5000|$|<b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>when</b> <b>you</b> {{encounter}} {{a person like}} this individual he was asked about, you must {{make a distinction between}} the fact of a person being gay from the fact of being a lobby, because lobbies, all are not good. That is bad. If a person is gay and seeks the Lord and has good will, well who am I to judge them? ...|$|E
6000|$|... "How may we {{overcome}} prejudice? <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>when</b> we are prejudiced [...] {{against a}} person, {{it is the}} hardest {{thing in the world}} to overcome [...] it." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh, it is a nasty place, that is all; and <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>when</b> Sir John {{has seen}} it, {{he will tell}} you to keep quiet for a few days." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I was {{thinking}} of my darter," [...] said Mrs. Banks, smoothing down her apron majestically. [...] "The arrangement was, <b>I</b> <b>think,</b> <b>that</b> <b>when</b> they were, married they was to live with you?" ...|$|R
5000|$|Speaking {{about her}} {{definition}} of an instrument {{in the context of}} The Lady's Glove, she said: [...] I've been trying to figure out at which point a controller becomes an instrument. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>when</b> <b>you</b> use or design a controller, and if you're just using it to push buttons of trigger things, it does not really affect the way you think of the music or how you write the software. You have your ideas and you're using a controller as an interface. Then I would not call it an instrument. I think it becomes an instrument when the software starts reflecting and adapting the limitations and possibilities of the controller, and your musical thinking and ideas become more a symbiosis between the controller, the software, and the hardware.|$|E
50|$|Mullins did not {{consider}} the song {{to be one of}} his best. In an interview with The Lighthouse Electronic Magazine in April 1996, he said:You know, the thing I like about Awesome God is that it's one of the worst-written songs that I ever wrote; it's just poorly crafted. But the thing is that sometimes, <b>I</b> <b>think,</b> <b>that</b> <b>when</b> <b>you</b> become too conscientious about being a songwriter, the message becomes a vehicle for the medium. This is a temptation that I think all songwriters have. I think a great songwriter is someone who is able to take a very meaningful piece of wisdom - or of folly or whatever - and say {{it in a way that}} is most likely to make people respond. But, what you want them to respond to is not how cleverly you did that; what you want them to respond to is your message.|$|E
5000|$|One of {{contemporary}} poetry’s most eclectic and formally innovative writers, Brenda Hillman {{is known for}} poems that draw on elements of found texts and document, personal meditation, observation, and literary theory. Often described as “sensuous” and “luminescent,” Hillman’s poetry investigates and pushes at the possibilities of form and voice, while remaining grounded in topics such as geology, the environment, politics, family, and spirituality. In an interview with Sarah Rosenthal, Hillman described her own understanding of form: “It is the artist’s job to make form. Not even to make it, but to allow it. Allow form. And all artists have a different relationship to it, and a different philosophy of it… <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>when</b> <b>you</b> are trying {{to open up a}} territory—in this case I was working with a desire to open the lyric—you have to be greedy, in that you want more than you can do. And you’re always bound to fail.” ...|$|E
6000|$|... "What {{a delicious}} soft wind!" [...] he exclaimed, {{removing}} his unsightly hat. [...] "Really, <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>when</b> {{we get a}} sunny day like this, April is almost our most beautiful month." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Do {{you know}} what, Capataz? <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>when</b> {{the time comes}} and some {{information}} must be given, I shall indicate the Great Isabel. That {{is the best place}} <b>I</b> can <b>think</b> of. What is the matter?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Do you know, Robert, I {{have been}} {{thinking}} {{so much about the}} future, and <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>when</b> we come back from our travels we ought to put aside almost all our money to do good with." ...|$|R
5000|$|Commanding General of the Third Army, George S. Patton said, [...] "The funny fuze won the Battle of the Bulge for us. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>when</b> all armies {{get this}} shell {{we will have}} to devise some new method of warfare." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I really don't <b>think</b> <b>that</b> {{you need}} be very anxious, Miss Thurwell," [...] he said hopefully. [...] "At present things look bad enough, but <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>when</b> the time comes, I shall {{be able to}} throw a {{different}} light upon them." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I am engaged," [...] he continued, [...] "upon a {{study of}} the methods and habits of one whom I believe to be a great criminal. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>when</b> <b>I</b> place my {{prisoner}} in the bar, Wainwright and these other great artists in crime will fade from the memory." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{should not}} deny my faith, even {{to save my}} life, sir, if the {{question}} were put to me: 'Are you a Huguenot?' But <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>when</b> four lives are at stake, it is lawful to take any opening there may be {{to get out of}} it." ...|$|R
50|$|<b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>when</b> President Bush {{says all}} options {{are on the}} table, the destabilization of Iran's ethnic provinces is one of them. Don't forget, Mr Mahmudali Chehregani, one of the pan-Turkist leaders {{agitating}} for a separatist Azeri agenda, was in Washington last year by invitation of the Defense Department.|$|R
5000|$|Regarding happenings, Red Grooms has remarked, [...] "I had {{the sense}} that I knew it was {{something}}. I knew it was something because I didn't know what it was. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>that's</b> <b>when</b> you're at your best point. When you're really doing something, you're doing it all out, but you don't know what it is." ...|$|R
60|$|Shortly {{after that}} one glimpse I had had {{of the old}} Admiral, he died. And <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>when</b> <b>I</b> saw him {{standing}} at his gate gazing past me at the distance, he was looking out for an expected messenger--a figure in black moving swiftly towards him with a drawn sword in his hand.|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{have seen}} him! He sent for me!" [...] she answered. [...] "Lumley, don't {{look at me}} like that! We're not in the nursery, you and I. I went because I had to. He's going to America for a time, and then he's coming back here. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>when</b> he comes back--he means mischief!" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Then I beg of {{you not to}} choose, Ayesha, since <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>when</b> {{there is}} {{work to be done}} by both of us, we shall find more comfort side by side than if I were on the ground seeking to kiss a garment that doubtless then it would delight you to snatch away." ...|$|R
50|$|Cronkite {{responded that}} a person should {{have a sense of}} curiosity. Ushery has said of the interview: “Many have asked if <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>that's</b> <b>when</b> the seed was planted for me to become a {{television}} reporter and anchor. I say, YES.” Connecticut audiences would see Ushery grow up on television. He hosted “Kidsworld” until he was 18.|$|R
6000|$|... "There isn't {{anything}} in the world," [...] he told her quietly, [...] "which {{has the power to}} tempt me from doing the thing which <b>I</b> <b>think</b> best. <b>I</b> cannot promise that it will be always the thing which seems right to this committee of men," [...] he added, touching the envelope with his forefinger. [...] "I cannot promise you that, but it should not worry you. You yourself are different. It is my hope that soon you will understand me better. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>when</b> <b>that</b> time comes you will cease to fear." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I renounce {{that dream}} utterly, and aspire to nothing higher than colonel. It must really be an awful bore to be commander-in-chief. Fancy {{having to go}} down to your office every morning, and go into all sorts of questions, and settle all sorts of business. No, <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>that,</b> <b>when</b> <b>I</b> get to be a colonel, my {{aspirations}} will be satisfied." ...|$|R
5000|$|John Ciardi {{wrote in}} The Western Humanities Review: [...] "I venture the guess {{that many of}} these poems must endure as long as English poems are read... <b>I</b> <b>think,,,</b> <b>that</b> <b>when</b> the time has had a chance to sift the chaff from the cliques Radcliffe Squires will come to be {{recognized}} asa one of the most valid singers of life now at work among us." ...|$|R
60|$|But <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>when</b> a man {{has reached}} that state of mind, as David reached it, he will rise, as David rose, to a higher state of mind still. He will rise, as David rises in this psalm, from {{thoughts}} about his own soul, to thoughts about God. In one word, he will rise from religion to that which is above even religion, namely theology.|$|R
6000|$|... "No," [...] said Greta, {{tracing the}} pattern of the {{sunlight}} on her skirt. [...] "But <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>when</b> we hope, we are not brave, because we are expecting something for ourselves. Chris says that hope is prayer, and if it is prayer, then all the time we are hoping, we are asking for something, and it is not brave to ask for things." ...|$|R
60|$|CHRIST. Little did <b>I</b> <b>think</b> once, <b>that</b> <b>when</b> {{my husband}} went on pilgrimage, I should ever have followed.|$|R
5000|$|... "But the {{condition}} was that Akhalaia {{should have been}} last guest of the program; such conditions are absolutely unacceptable for me. Also <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>when</b> such a murder to the Girgvliani's case occurs in the country the Interior Minister should at least resign. So {{this is my last}} program and I quit this channel 2." [...] After the statement, Khoperia announced an advertising break, but the programme did not resume.|$|R
5000|$|Patricia's {{contribution}} Floodland wasn't directly musical. Which {{is not to}} say it wasn't important, {{because the}} look, the feel, the image, if you're in a pop group, is very important. It was an intriguing relationship that had a lot of value - probably more value than Andrew realized at first. And when he did realize it, <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>that's</b> <b>when</b> he became very uneasy with Patricia. But her musical contributions were very minimal.|$|R
