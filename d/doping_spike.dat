Strong radiative recombination is observed of the 2 DHG with the photocreated electrons confined by GaAs/Al sub x Ga sub 1 -x As heterointerfaces placed at {{both sides of the}} <b>doping</b> <b>spike.</b> For optical excitation with a sufficiently large penetration depth to generate electrons {{on both sides of the}} <b>doping</b> <b>spike,</b> a filling of the valence subbands with photocreated holes is found for excitation power densities exceeding a certain thereshold. Excitation with light generating electrons only at the near-surface side of the <b>doping</b> <b>spike</b> does not lead to such band filling, but yields luminescence spectra which show a strong enhancement in intensity at the Fermi edge.

40|$|SBV (Single Barrier Varactor) diodes {{have been}} {{proposed}} as alternatives to Schottky barrier diodes for harmonic multiplier applications. However, these show a higher current than expected. The excess current is due to X valley transport in the barrier. We present experimental results showing {{that the use of}} a superlattice barrier and <b>doping</b> <b>spikes</b> in the GaAs depletion regions {{on either side of the}} barrier can reduce the excess current and improve the control of the capacitance vs. voltage characteristic. The experimental results consist of data taken from two types of device structures. The first test structure was used to study the performance of AlAs/GaAs superlattice barriers. The wafer was fabricated into 90 micron diameter mesa diodes and the resulting current vs. voltage characteristics were measured. A 10 period superlattice structure with a total thickness of approximately 400 A worked well as an electron barrier. The structure had a current density of about one A/sq cm at one volt at room temperature. The capacitance variation of these structures was small because of the design of the GaAs cladding layers. The second test structure was used to study cladding layer designs. These wafers were InGaAs and InAlAs layers lattice matched to an InP substrate. The layers have n(+) <b>doping</b> <b>spikes</b> near the barrier to increase the zero bias capacitance and control the shape of the capacitance vs. voltage characteristic. These structures have a capacitance ratio of 5 : 1 and an abrupt change from maximum to minimum capacitance. The measurements were made at 80 K. Based on the information obtained from these two structures, we have designed a structure that combines the low current density barrier with the improved cladding layers. The capacitance and current-voltage characteristics from this structure are presented...|$|R

The B 2 H 6 doping gas was added for 2 s by two methods, namely during growth or as a flush while the Si 2 H 6 flow was interrupted. High-resolution SIMS {{measurements}} have revealed extremely sharp and highly concentrated dopant profiles. Peak B concentrations up to 5 × 1021 cm- 3 and, at 1 atm H 2, a FWHM of 3 nm were obtained.

40|$|Opposed to {{phosphorus}} n+-emitters on p-type silicon {{solar cells}}, p+-emitters on n-type silicon solar cells show altered properties {{with respect to}} e. g. dopant diffusion, electrical contacting, and metal induced recombination. This work tries to paint a consistent picture whose results base on deep-penetrating metal spikes (often {{also referred to as}} crystallites) formed below Ag-Al screen printing pastes during the contact firing process. By optimizing BBr 3 diffusion processes, emitter dark saturation current densities of as low as 30 fA/cm² on alkaline textured and passivated surface are obtained. For considering the interplay between boron <b>doping</b> profile and <b>spike</b> depth regarding the specific contact resistance C, BBr 3 diffusion processes are adapted yielding profiles with similar surface concentration but different junction depth. Apart from the maximum boron concentration, the junction depth of the doping profiles impacts C obtained for two examined Ag-Al pastes: deeper junctions lead to lower C. This finding is confirmed by an analytical model taking metal spikes with penetration depths of several 100 nm into account. The known issue of increased recombination below the Ag-Al metallization is addressed by a new simulation approach, which models the actual geometric shape of metal spikes in a three-dimensional (3 D) simulation utilizing the quasisteady-state photoconductance (QSSPC) technique. With these 3 D QSSPC simulations, we discuss the impact of metal spiking in boron emitters in relation to depth and surface coverage of the spikes, and discuss the scenario which leads to dark saturation current densities of metallized boron emitters in the range of several 1000 fA/cm²...|$|R

40|$|A {{systematic}} {{study of}} the theoretical acceptor-related photoluminescence spectra in a cylindrical GaAs-(Ga,Al) As quantum-well wire is performed. The acceptor states are described within a variational scheme in the effective-mass approximation. Photoluminescence spectra associated with acceptors are calculated for both homogeneous and on-center spike-doped distributions of acceptors in the quantum-well wire. Results are dependent on the temperature, on {{the choice of the}} quasi-Fermi-energy level of the conduction-subband electron gas, and on the distribution of acceptors in the wire. The photoluminescence spectra corresponding to the on-center spike-doped Gaussian distribution (width of the <b>doping</b> <b>spike</b> of the order of 50 angstrom) shows a peak for energies associated with on-center impurity states, as is expected, whereas for a homogeneous distribution of acceptors in the well we essentially found an edge in the spectra associated with transitions involving on-center acceptors and a peaked structure related to the onset of transitions from the conduction subband to on-edge acceptors.

For homogeneous doping at 410 degree C, the maximum carrier concentration is 1. 9 x 10 high 19 cmhigh- 3, while at 660 degree C {{it is only}} 7. 4 x 10 high 18 cmhigh- 3. In contrast, for the Delta-doping the highest maximum sheet carrier concentration of 2. 5 x 10 high 13 cmhigh- 2 is found {{at a growth temperature}} of 660 degree C, whereas at a growth temperature of 410 degree C the maximum sheet carrier concentration is only 5 x 10 high 12 cmhigh- 2.

40|$|The mm-wave {{frequency}} range is being increasingly researched {{to close the}} gap between 100 to 1000 GHz, the least explored region of the electromagnetic spectrum, often termed as the 'THz Gap'. The ever increasing demand for compact, portable and reliable THz (Terahertz) devices and the huge market potential for THz system have led to an enormous amount of research and development in the area for a number of years. The Gunn Diode is expected to {{play a significant role in}} the development of low cost solid state oscillators which will form an essential part of these THz systems. Gunn and mixer diodes will 'power' future THz systems. The THz frequencies generation methodology is based on a two-stage module. The initial frequency source is provided by a high frequency Gunn diode and is the main focus of this work. The output from this diode is then coupled into a multiplier module. The multiplier provides higher frequencies by the generation of harmonics of the input signal by means of a non-linear element, such as Schottky diode Varactor. A realistic Schottky diode model developed in SILVACOTM is presented in this work. This thesis describes the work done to develop predictive models for Gunn Diode devices using SILVACOTM. These physically-based simulations provide the opportunity to increase understanding of the effects of changes to the device's physical structure, theoretical concepts and its general operation. Thorough understanding of device physics was achieved to develop a reliable Gunn diode model. The model development included device physical structure building, material properties specification, physical models definition and using appropriate biasing conditions. The initial goal of the work was to develop a 2 D model for a Gunn diode commercially manufactured by e 2 v Technologies Plc. for use in second harmonic mode 77 GHz Intelligent Adaptive Cruise Control (ACC) systems for automobiles. This particular device was chosen as its operation is well understood and a wealth of data is available for validation of the developed physical model. The comparisons of modelled device results with measured results of a manufactured device are discussed in detail. Both the modelled and measured devices yielded similar I-V characteristics and so validated the choice of the physical models selected for the simulations. During the course of this research 2 D, 3 D rectangular, 3 D cylindrical and cylindrical modelled device structures were developed and compared to measured results. The injector <b>doping</b> <b>spike</b> concentration was varied to study its influence on the electric field in the transit region, and was compared with published and measured data. Simulated DC characteristics were also compared with measured results for higher frequency devices. The devices mostly correspond to material previously grown for experimental studies in the development of D-band GaAs Gunn devices. Ambient temperature variations were also included in both simulated and measured data. Transient solutions were used to obtain a time dependent response such as determining the device oscillating frequency under biased condition. These solutions provided modelled device time-domain responses. The time-domain simulations of higher frequency devices which were developed used modelling measured approach are discussed. The studied devices include 77 GHz (2 nd harmonic), 125 GHz (2 nd harmonic) and 100 GHz fundamental devices. During the course of this research, twelve research papers were disseminated. The results obtained have proved that the modelling techniques used, have provided predictive models for novel Transferred Electron Devices (TEDs) operating above 100 GHz.
