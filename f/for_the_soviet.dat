5|$|Cumulative U.S. {{military}} expenditures {{throughout the entire}} Cold War amounted to an estimated $8trillion. Further nearly 100,000 Americans {{lost their lives in}} the Korean and Vietnam Wars. Although Soviet casualties are difficult to estimate, as a share of their gross national product the financial cost <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>Soviet</b> Union was much higher than that incurred by the United States.|$|E
5|$|Gomułka's thaw {{was caused}} by several factors. The death of Joseph Stalin in 1953 and the {{resulting}} de-Stalinization and the Khrushchev Thaw prompted debates about fundamental issues throughout the entire Eastern Bloc.

5|$|In {{a seminar}} at the Woodrow Wilson Institute on May 20, 2009, {{and based on}} an {{extensive}} analysis of the Vassiliev notebooks taken from the KGB archives, John Earl Haynes, Harvey Klehr, and Alexander Vassiliev concluded that Oppenheimer never was involved in espionage <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>Soviets.</b> <b>The</b> KGB tried repeatedly to recruit him, but were never successful. Allegations that he had spied <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>Soviets</b> are unsupported, and in some instances, contradicted by voluminous KGB and Venona documentation released {{after the fall of}} <b>the</b> <b>Soviet</b> Union. In addition, he had several persons removed from the Manhattan project who had sympathies to <b>the</b> <b>Soviet</b> Union.|$|R

5|$|In 1991, the Chief Military Prosecutor <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>Soviet</b> Union began {{proceedings}} against P.K.

5|$|The Soviet Union never {{participated in}} the Eurovision Song Contest, but it made several {{attempts}} in the late 1980s. In 2009, Eduard Fomin, a former employee of the Ministry of Education of the RSFSR, revealed that in 1987 George Veselov, the Minister of Education <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>Soviet</b> Union, brought forward the idea of Soviet participation in the Eurovision Song Contest due {{to the number of}} political reforms made by the General Secretary of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union Mikhail Gorbachev during the late 1980s. The idea was mainly a political one, with the thought that a win in the contest <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>Soviet</b> Union would impact on the relationships between the Soviet Union and the capitalist countries of the west. Valery Leontyev was suggested as a singer <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>Soviet</b> Union's first entry into the contest, but Veselov's ideas were not shared by the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, or by Gorbachev himself, believing it to be too radical a step to take, and so the Soviet Union never entered the contest before dissolving.|$|E
5|$|After Reagan's {{military}} buildup, the Soviet Union did {{not respond}} by further building its military because the enormous military expenses, along with inefficient planned manufacturing and collectivized agriculture, were already a heavy burden <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>Soviet</b> economy. At the same time, Saudi Arabia increased oil production, even as other non-OPEC nations were increasing production. These developments contributed to the 1980s oil glut, which affected the Soviet Union, as oil was {{the main source of}} Soviet export revenues. Issues with command economics, oil price decreases and large military expenditures gradually brought the Soviet economy to stagnation.|$|E
5|$|After {{the end of}} the war in Europe, the 395th Guards Heavy Self-Propelled Artillery Regiment was {{transferred}} to the Far East <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>Soviet</b> invasion of Manchuria. Snetkov became its chief of intelligence and assistant chief of staff for intelligence, and ended the war with the rank of captain. Between 8 August and 3 September, the regiment fought in the Soviet invasion of Manchuria attached to the 5th Army, and on 8 September he received a second Order of the Patriotic War, 1st class, for providing crucial intelligence gained from reconnaissance to his unit.|$|E

5|$|As {{early as}} 1948, the Soviet secret service took an {{interest}} in this area of medicine. One of those with overall responsibility <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>Soviet</b> secret police, pre-war Procurator General and State Prosecutor, the deputy Minister of Foreign Affairs Andrey Vyshinsky, was the first to order the use of psychiatry as a tool of repression. Russian psychiatrist Pyotr Gannushkin also believed that in a class society, especially during the most severe class struggle, psychiatry was incapable of not being repressive. A system of political abuse of psychiatry was developed at the end of Joseph Stalin's regime.|$|E
5|$|At age 16, Bure {{began his}} {{professional}} hockey career playing for CSKA Moscow. He {{was invited to}} the senior club's training camp for the 1987–88 season. Although he was deemed too young, and not yet ready, <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>Soviet</b> League, Bure earned minimal playing time filling in for absent regulars. He made his debut in September 1987, and played five games for the senior team, scoring his only goal in his first game.|$|E

5|$|By January 1943, the {{situation}} looked very good <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>Soviet</b> side. The German {{defeat in the}} Battle of Stalingrad had weakened the German front. The Soviet forces were planning or conducting offensive operations across the entire front, especially in southwestern Russia. Amidst these conditions, Operation Iskra was {{to become the first}} of several offensive operations aimed at inflicting a decisive defeat on the German Army Group North.|$|E
5|$|Debate exists {{over the}} {{significance}} and {{outcome of the}} battle. The German forces destroyed many Soviet tanks and temporarily degraded the striking power of the 5th Guards Tank Army, but {{they were unable to}} take Prokhorovka or break through into open ground before developments elsewhere forced the termination of Operation Citadel. <b>For</b> <b>the</b> <b>Soviet</b> side, the massive armoured attack of 12 July failed to destroy the II SS-Panzer Corps, but succeeded in exhausting the Germans and eventually contributed to checking their advance. Thus, neither the 5th Guards Tank Army nor the II SS-Panzer Corps accomplished their objectives for 12 July.|$|E
5|$|Immediately {{after the}} shootdown, South Korea, {{owner of the}} {{aircraft}} and therefore prime considerant for jurisdiction, designated the United States and Japan as search and salvage agents, thereby making it illegal <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>Soviet</b> Union to salvage the aircraft, providing it was found outside Soviet territorial waters. If it did so, the United States would now be legally entitled to use force against the Soviets, if necessary, to prevent retrieval of {{any part of the}} plane.|$|E

5|$|In 1940, when General Zhukov was {{promoted}} to commander of the Kiev Military District in the Ukrainian SSR, Bagramyan wrote a letter asking to serve under his command. Zhukov agreed, and in December asked for his help writing a paper to {{be presented to the}} commanders of the Soviet Military Districts. Bagramyan's paper, Conducting a Contemporary Offensive Operation, apparently impressed Zhukov, as he promoted Bagramyan to become the head of Operations <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>Soviet</b> 12th Army based in Ukraine. Within three months however, Bagramyan, then a colonel, was appointed deputy {{chief of staff of the}} Southwestern Front, headquartered in Kiev.|$|E
5|$|In December 1981, Poland's Wojciech Jaruzelski {{reacted to}} the crisis by {{imposing}} a period of martial law. Reagan imposed economic sanctions on Poland in response.

5|$|In July 1940, Britain {{offered the}} United States {{access to its}} {{scientific}} research, and Cockcroft briefed American scientists on British nuclear weapons developments. He discovered that the American S-1 Project (later renamed the Manhattan Project) was smaller than the British, and not as far advanced. The two projects exchanged information, but did not initially combine their efforts, ostensibly over concerns about American security. Ironically, it was the British project {{that had already been}} penetrated by atomic spies <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>Soviet</b> Union.|$|E
