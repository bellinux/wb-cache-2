500|$|As governor, Huntsman listed {{economic}} development, health-care reform, education, {{and energy}} security as his top priorities. He oversaw {{tax cuts and}} advocated reorganizing the way that services were distributed so {{that the government would}} not become overwhelmed by the state's fast growing population. He also proposed a plan to reform health-care, mainly through the private sector, by using tax breaks and negotiation to keep prices down. In 2007, when asked about a healthcare mandate, Huntsman said, [...] "I'm comfortable with a requirement – you can call it whatever you want, but at some point we're going to have to <b>get</b> <b>serious</b> about how we deal with this issue".|$|E

500|$|Fujimoto {{argues that}} the story has overly {{traditional}} gender roles, noting [...] " [...] its representations suggest that men are {{men and women are}} women and that they differ naturally regarding aptitude and vocation". For example, the girls initially outperform the boys in the Ninja Academy, but [...] "once the boys <b>get</b> <b>serious,</b> the girls cannot keep pace". [...] Fujimoto points out that this does not upset Sakura, who is now surpassed by Naruto. [...] Character development based on female roles, when it does occur, again uses stereotypical roles: Tsunade, for example, a middle-aged woman with large breasts, is a clear mother figure, and when she teaches Sakura to be a medical ninja, which requires special skills possessed only by women, the story reinforces the idea that women only belong on the battlefield as healers. [...] Tsunade herself, who is a figure of authority in Naruto, is portrayed as ridiculous in a way that men in the same position are not. [...] Fujimoto suggests this presentation of women may explain why the female characters are often the most disliked characters among readers of the manga.|$|E
500|$|Reviews for {{the episode}} were strong. Many critics noted a step-up in quality {{from the first}} season. Newsdays Verne Gay called stated [...] " [...] "Skies" [...] has made the bad guys intriguing, and now if it can only <b>get</b> <b>serious</b> about {{character}} development with the good ones -- humans -- then the second season {{will be a big}} improvement." [...] Maureen Ryan of The Huffington Post compared the episode to the first season by saying [...] "Season 2 is a different animal, a much leaner and meaner machine that allows sentiment to be present but unexpressed and depicts a darker world in which innocence is a luxury that no one can truly afford." [...] Chuck Barney declared [...] "Sunday's explosive two-hour opener boldly delivers on the promise by TNT producers to rev up both the pace and the firepower in Season 2." [...] Matt Richenthal of TV Fanatic called the episode a [...] "strong start overall to Falling Skies Season 2," [...] and continued by praising the performances of Wyle, Patton and Cunningham. Screen Rant's Anthony Ocasio praised the episode. [...] "While further episodes will reveal more, the type of character development, intriguing storylines and exciting action that will be contained in Falling Skies season 2 , there’s no doubt that TNT’s hit drama will likely become an epic adventure, spanning many seasons," [...] he said.|$|E

2500|$|Stevens' songs {{have been}} showcased in several videos. [...] "Gitarzan" [...] was {{featured}} on The Dr. Demento 20th Anniversary Collection. Stevens' video albums were frequently offered via television commercials. 1992's Comedy Video Classics won [...] the Billboard Home Video of the Year in 1993, and other awards.

2500|$|Jon Dolan, {{writing for}} Blender, gave the album {{three out of}} five stars and commended Norwood's {{decision}} to re-team with Jerkins: [...] "Now she's gone back to girlie hip-hop Eden; four songs were written by Jerkins, author of her best late-'90s hits. Fluttery jams about long distance longing and time-suspending slow dances are balanced by grown-up moments of deeply felt, if slightly weird, balladic fortitude." [...] Jon Pareles from The New York Times felt that the sentiments of the songs, whether self-affirming or heartbroken, were back to generic ones: [...] "Song titles like 'Torn Down' and 'Shattered Heart' show how much Brandy is trying to <b>get</b> <b>serious,</b> taking on an adult world where happily ever after is elusive. But she still {{comes across as a}} fledgling, a personality still being formed, eagerly tagging along after her role models." [...] In his review for Entertainment Weekly, Henry Goldblatt noted [...] "the huskiness that defined Brandy's prior work has been replaced by wispier and higher tones. The result is pleasant but far less ambitious than her last CD, 2004's Afrodisiac." [...] Mikael Wood's review for Los Angeles Times was less emphatic. He gave the album one and a half stars out of four, and said: [...] "Unfortunately, it's also hard {{to make it through the}} thing. Brandy's strong suit has never been her thoughtfulness; appropriately for someone with her Hollywood history, she's long been one of R's emptiest vessels, a gorgeous voice used by a series of gifted producers to communicate their own unique ideas." ...|$|E
2500|$|Like Michael, Jermaine began a solo career {{while still}} {{a member of}} The Jackson 5, and had a hit with the 1972 Shep and the Limelites cover [...] "Daddy's Home". It sold over one million copies by March 1973, and was awarded a gold disc. When The Jackson 5 left Motown, Jermaine left the group and stayed at Motown. Jermaine was {{nominated}} for the Grammy Award for Best Male R Vocal Performance for his 1980 album Let's <b>Get</b> <b>Serious.</b> He {{had a number of}} Billboard Top 30 hits throughout the 1970s and 1980s, including [...] "Daddy's Home" [...] (#9), [...] "That's How Love Goes", [...] "Let's Be Young Tonight", [...] "Bass Odyssey", [...] "Feel the Fire", [...] "Let Me Tickle Your Fancy" [...] (featuring Devo on backing vocals) (#18), [...] "Let's Get Serious" [...] (#9, also one of his only two UK hits, peaking at #8), [...] "Dynamite" [...] (#15), [...] "Do What You Do" [...] (#13), and [...] "I Think It's Love" [...] (#16).
