40|$|Background: In recent years, {{numerous}} {{articles have}} attempted {{to shed light on}} our understanding of the patho-physiological mechanisms of exercise-induced immunologic changes and their impact on allergy and asthma. It is known that lymphocyte subclasses, cytokines and chemokines show modifications after exercise, but outcomes can be affected by the type of exercise as well as by its intensity and duration. Interesting data have been presented in many recent studies on mouse models, but few studies on humans have been performed to check the long-term effects of exercise over a whole championship season. Methods: This study evaluated lymphocyte subsets and their intracellular IL- 2, IL- 4, TNF-α and IFN-γ production in professional football (soccer) players, at three stages of the season, to evaluate if alterations occur, particularly in relation with their allergic status. Results and Conclusion: Despite significant mid-season alterations, no significant lymphocyte subclasses count modifications <b>except</b> <b>for</b> <b>NKs</b> that were significantly higher, were observed at the end. IL- 2 and IL- 4 producing cells showed a significant decrease (p= 0. 018 and p= 0. 001, but in a steady fashion for IL- 4), confirming the murine data about the potential beneficial effects of aerobic exercise for allergic asthma...|$|R

40|$|Anticancer drugs induce cell-cycle {{arrest and}} {{apoptosis}} {{not only in}} tumor cells, but also in immune cells. However, many preclinical and clinical findings show that some chemotherapeutic agents can improve the antitumor efficacy of immunotherapy. We immunohistochemically analyzed the degree of immune cell infiltration and the relevance of programmed cell death 1 ligand- 1 (PD-L 1) expression in surgically resected oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC) specimens from patients who had undergone pretreatment with certain chemotherapies and other patients without pretreatment. We divided the patients into the group of neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NAC) patients (n= 8) and the nNAC (without NAC) patient group (n= 10). We observed that NAC induced infiltrations of CD 4, CD 8 T cells and CD 56 NK cells into the tumor microenvironment. Decreased numbers of Tregs and PD- 1 -positive cells were observed in the NAC group. No significant difference was observed {{in the degree of}} immune-cell infiltration between the patient groups <b>except</b> <b>for</b> CD 56 <b>NK</b> cells in the stroma and PD- 1 cells in cancer nests. Eighty percent of the nNAC specimens showed intermediate-to-strong PD-L 1 protein expression, whereas 75 % of the NAC specimens showed down-regulation of the PD-L 1 protein, indicating the effectiveness of the chemotherapeutic treatment before surgery...|$|R
