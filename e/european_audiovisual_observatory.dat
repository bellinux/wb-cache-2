40|$|In {{the paper}} at hand we analyze the ‘enlarged <b>European</b> <b>audiovisual</b> market’. Hence, {{accession}} to the European Union (EU) not only resulted in harmonization of audiovisual legislation {{of the new}} Member States, but also in {{being part of the}} common <b>European</b> (<b>audiovisual)</b> market. By using the design of a SWOT (strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, threats) analysis we try to make an assessment: What does the enlarged audiovisual market looks like? What are its strengths and what are the weaknesses? What does the enlargement of the EU mean for Central and Eastern <b>European</b> <b>audiovisual</b> cultures? Does it offer opportunities or rather threats? The main characteristic – {{and at the same time}} the main weakness – of the <b>European</b> <b>audiovisual</b> market is its fragmentation into small national markets with only limited cross-border distribution. The EU enlargement seems to ‘enlarge’ this characteristic as the new countries of Central and Eastern Europe fit into this picture (with only Poland, and in second place Hungary and the Czech Republic as countries with sizeable markets). EU enlargement offers opportunities for Central and Eastern <b>European</b> <b>audiovisual</b> industries such as increased investments and funding, cooperation partners and enhanced export possibilities. The threat of Europeanization, however, adds to the already present threat of Americanization. It could be argued, though, that Europeanization as a process of ‘transnational cultural diffusion’ is not so evident – neither in Western Europe, Eastern Europe or enlarged Europe. Again, Eastern Europe ‘adds more of the same’. In both Western and Eastern Europe the audiovisual sector is considered to play not only a major economic but also an important cultural role. Audiovisual policy is considered an instrument to preserve the national and (in second instance) European culture. Eastern and Western Europe could feel united by this idea. status: publishe...|$|R

The audiovisual “explosion” is a cultural, social and economic phenomenon of global dimension. The audiovisual sector forms an essential part of Europe’s economic and cultural influence in the world. The fundamental principle of the Union’s audiovisual policy is to provide for the free circulation of reception of trans frontier broadcasts. So the <b>European</b> <b>audiovisual</b> industry is likely to become a stronger and more competitive player on the global scene. The future of public service broadcasting in Europe is increasingly challenged by unfavorable external factors, such as intensifying competition from commercial media, media concentrations, political and economic interests adversary to independent media, and by internal difficulties, such as cost ineffectiveness. <b>European</b> <b>Audiovisual</b> Policy, public service broadcasting, audience market share, cultural obligations, license fee...|$|R

40|$|This article {{studies the}} link between the Eastern {{enlargement}} of the European Union and issues of audiovisual policy and audiovisual markets. The main link between audiovisual policy and EU enlargement is through alignment with the Community acquis, in particular the Television Without Frontiers Directive. Legislative alignment has been achieved in all Central and Eastern European countries by adopting new media laws. This process can be described one of (neutrally defined) Europeanization. EU enlargement offers opportunities for Central and Eastern <b>European</b> <b>audiovisual</b> industries such as increased investments and funding, cooperation partners, and enhanced export possibilities, but also bears the threat of Europeanization as a process of cultural diffusion or cultural dominance. Both Eastern and Western Europe, however, are culturally and linguistically fragmented. Enlargement, it is argued, basically enlarges the characteristics of the <b>European</b> <b>audiovisual</b> market. Enlargement adds to Europe 'more of the same': more diversity, more languages, and more (audiovisual) cultures. status: publishe...|$|R
