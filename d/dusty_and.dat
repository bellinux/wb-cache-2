5|$|Deep Impact was a NASA {{space probe}} {{launched}} from Cape Canaveral Air Force Station at 18:47 UTC on January 12, 2005. It {{was designed to}} study the interior composition of the comet Tempel 1 (9P/Tempel), by releasing an impactor into the comet. At 05:52 UTC on July 4, 2005, the impactor successfully collided with the comet's nucleus. The impact excavated debris from {{the interior of the}} nucleus, forming an impact crater. Photographs taken by the spacecraft showed the comet to be more <b>dusty</b> <b>and</b> less icy than had been expected. The impact generated an unexpectedly large and bright dust cloud, obscuring the view of the impact crater.|$|E
5|$|Dusty Rhodes {{continued}} to feud with Randy Savage after SummerSlam. During their match on the October 22 episode of Prime Time Wrestling, Ted DiBiase interfered and attacked Rhodes's son, Dustin. DiBiase and Dusty Rhodes {{faced each other}} {{as part of an}} elimination match at Survivor Series 1990; DiBiase won the match for his team. The continued rivalry led to a tag team match at the 1991 Royal Rumble that pitted <b>Dusty</b> <b>and</b> Dustin Rhodes against DiBiase and his bodyguard, Virgil. DiBiase and Virgil won the match and then began feuding with each other. Sapphire left the WWF soon after SummerSlam, and Savage stopped feuding with Rhodes in favor of challenging the Ultimate Warrior for the WWF World Heavyweight Championship.|$|E

In 2013, Goldust was a surprise entrant for the Royal Rumble match on January 26 and was once again eliminated by his half-brother. Although he hinted at a possible feud with Cody, he later confirmed {{in an interview that}} his return was a one night only deal.|$|E

The two {{go to the}} dentist office only to be kicked out. When the dentist departs on a cruise the two tramps then pose as dentists and occupy the office and pull teeth with pincers and tongs. When the rightful owners return they drive off again. The tramps continue in their venture and quickly make a large sum of money before they desire their old way of life. The two tramps then surrender the office to its rightful owners.|$|E

They arrive {{during one of the}} Magician's acts and Meru unintentionally negates her abilities, ruining the performance. This angers the Magician, who decides to ally herself with the Eraser out of spite. The Eraser's {{recruits}} use the Magician's help to set a trap for Lyme, Duncan, and Perrier. Lyme is beaten into a coma and left for dead, although he is found by passersby and taken to a hospital. Duncan and Perrier escape, but are now disconnected from Meru and the others. Meanwhile, Meru, Bill, and Dusty follow up a different lead in Hong Kong. They too are attacked by the Eraser, resulting in <b>Dusty</b> <b>and</b> Bill's deaths. Meru escapes, and is now more resolved than ever to stop the Eraser.|$|E

25|$|While the British {{cultural}} influence remained strong {{into the}} 21st century, other influences became increasingly important. The Hawaiian sport of surfing was adopted in Australia where a beach {{culture and the}} locally developed surf lifesaving movement was already burgeoning in the early 20th century. American pop culture and cinema were embraced in the 20th century, with country music and later rock and roll sweeping Australia, aided by the new technology of television {{and a host of}} American content. The 1956 Melbourne Olympics announced a confident, prosperous post-war nation, and new cultural icons like Australian country music star Slim <b>Dusty</b> <b>and</b> dadaist Barry Humphries expressed a uniquely Australian identity.|$|E
25|$|The {{trenches}} were hot, <b>dusty,</b> <b>and</b> miserable, but {{conditions were}} worse between the lines, {{where thousands of}} wounded Federal soldiers suffered horribly without food, water, or medical assistance. Grant was reluctant {{to ask for a}} formal truce that would allow him to recover his wounded because that would be an acknowledgment he had lost the battle. He and Lee traded notes across the lines from June 5 to 7 without coming to an agreement, and when Grant formally requested a two-hour cessation of hostilities, {{it was too late for}} most of the unfortunate wounded, who were now bloated corpses. Grant was widely criticized in the Northern press for this lapse of judgment.|$|E

25|$|In today's {{soap opera}} medium, there are couples which {{come close to}} gaining supercouple status in terms of popularity. Although these pairings have {{perceived}} chemistry and potential, the couple's story is cut short, often due to the actors leaving to pursue jobs outside of soap operas or due to the writers changing direction in a storyline. These couples do not last long enough onscreen to garner {{the long history of}} what is often considered a genuine supercouple. Such couples include Leo and Greenlee (All My Children), Ryan and Gillian (All My Children), <b>Dusty</b> <b>and</b> Lucy (As the World Turns), Simon and Katie (As the World Turns), Robin and Stone (General Hospital), Jonathan and Tammy (Guiding Light), and Todd and Téa (One Life to Live).|$|E
25|$|Little {{recalled}} today, the Es Salt {{operation was}} {{with the exception of}} the Gallipoli evacuation, perhaps the most 'close run thing' to occur to the Egyptian Expeditionary Force in the whole Sinai and Palestine campaign. The Ottoman attack on 1 May quickly overwhelmed the 4th Light Horse Brigade and that it managed to withdraw in as good an order as it did, in confused and dangerous circumstances, is testimony to the experience of the troops and the quality of the junior, squadron and regimental leadership. If the brigade had been lost at this time, virtually the entire Australian Imperial Force in the Middle East could have been captured. The Desert Mounted Corps followed these operations with a long, hot, <b>dusty</b> <b>and</b> disease-plagued summer in the Jordan Valley while Allenby's army's British troops were replaced by Indian Army troops before the Battle of Megiddo.|$|E
25|$|The frontoviks had to live, {{fight and}} die in small {{circular}} foxholes dug into the earth with enough room {{for one or two}} men with slit trenches being to connect what the Germans called “Russian holes”. The soldiers were usually not issued blankets or sleeping bags, even in the winter. Instead, the frontovik slept in their coats and shelter-capes usually on pine, evergreen needles, fir boughs, piled leaves or straw. In the winter, the temperature could drop as low as -60°F (-50°C), making General Moroz (General Frost) as much an enemy as the Germans. Spring started in April and with it came rains and snowmelt, making the battlefields into a muddy quagmire. Summers were <b>dusty</b> <b>and</b> hot while with the fall came the rasputitsa (time without roads) as heavy autumn rains once again turned the battlefields into muddy quagmires that made the spring rains look tame by comparison.|$|E

25|$|Bill Harkins Field at the Manley R. Whitcomb Band Complex is an {{artificial}} turf with rubber fill field built near the Flying High Circus on Chieftain Way. The field is an exact replica of what Bobby Bowden field looked like on game {{days at the}} time of the field's construction. Since then several alterations have been made to the actual field. Bill Harkins, head coach of the men's lacrosse team from 2004 to 2013, donated $350,000 towards the construction of the new field. Previously the space was a grassy field that often alternated between <b>dusty</b> <b>and</b> muddy. The Florida State University Marching Chiefs have primary use of the field and use it for their daily practices. The football team and lacrosse teams have secondary use of the field with the lacrosse team using the field for practices and games. The football team sometimes uses the practice field in anticipation of games at stadiums with artificial turf.|$|E
