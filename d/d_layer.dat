25|$|Medium {{frequency}} (MF) {{and lower}} high frequency (HF) radio waves are significantly attenuated within the <b>D</b> <b>layer,</b> as the passing radio waves cause electrons to move, which then collide with the neutral molecules, {{giving up their}} energy. Lower frequencies experience greater absorption because they move the electrons farther, leading to greater chance of collisions. This {{is the main reason}} for absorption of HF radio waves, particularly at 10nbsp&MHz and below, with progressively less absorption at higher frequencies. This effect peaks around noon and is reduced at night due to a decrease in the D layer's thickness; only a small part remains due to cosmic rays. A common example of the <b>D</b> <b>layer</b> in action is the disappearance of distant AM broadcast band stations in the daytime.|$|E
25|$|When the Sun is active, strong solar flares {{can occur}} that {{will hit the}} sunlit side of Earth with hard X-rays. The X-rays will {{penetrate}} to the D-region, releasing electrons that will rapidly increase absorption, causing a high frequency (3–30nbsp&MHz) radio blackout. During this time very low frequency (3–30nbsp&kHz) signals will be reflected by the <b>D</b> <b>layer</b> instead of the E layer, where the increased atmospheric density will usually increase the absorption of the wave and thus dampen it. As soon as the X-rays end, the sudden ionospheric disturbance (SID) or radio black-out ends as the electrons in the D-region recombine rapidly and signal strengths return to normal.|$|E

40|$|We present here a {{study of}} the first stages of the sulfurization of the III-V {{compounds}} GaAs and InP. The formation of the native sulfide is obtained by exposure to H 2 S/H 2 mixtures under controlled thermodynamic conditions. The first step of this reaction is the reversible formation of a stable two-dimensional l yer with a definite composition. On GaAs, the re-action proceeds by the formation of a close-packed two-dimensional layer, then of multi layers of a strained gallium sulfide, and finally by the nucleation and growth of unstrained three-dimensional su fide crystallites. This growth mecha-nism is similar to the one of III-V heterointerfaces with a large interfacial MISFIT, but different from that of native metal sulfides.
