40|$|Abstract: This paper {{analyses}} three type {{of different}} <b>indexing</b> <b>methods</b> applied on French test collections (CLEF from 2000 to 2005) : lemmas, truncated terms and single words. The same search engine {{and the same}} characteristics are used independently to the <b>indexing</b> <b>method</b> to avoid variability in the analysis. When evaluated on French CLEF collections, indexing by lemmas is the best method compared to single words and truncated term methods. We also analyse the impact of combining <b>indexing</b> <b>methods</b> by using the CombMNZ function. As CLEF topics are composed of different parts, we also examine the influence of these topic parts {{by comparing the results}} when topic parts are considered individually, and when they are combined. Finally, we combine both <b>indexing</b> <b>methods</b> and query parts. We show that MAP can be improved up to 8 % compared to the best individual methods. ...|$|R

50|$|SimuMCAT {{is a free}} Java {{application}} program that simulates a multidimensional computer adaptive test (MCAT). The user can select from five different MCAT item selection procedures (Volume, Kullback-Leibler information, Minimize the error variance of the linear combination, Minimum Angle, and Minimize the error variance of the composite score with the optimized weight). Two exposure control approaches are possible: the traditional Sympson-Hetter approach and a maximum exposure control approach. It is also possible to implement content constraints using the Priority <b>Index</b> <b>method.</b> Different stopping rules are implemented with fixed-length test and varying-length test. The user specifies true examinee ability, item pools, and item selection procedures, and the program outputs selected items with item responses and ability estimates. Bayesian and non-Bayesian methods can be specified by the user. The examinees’ ability and item pools can also be created from the program by the user specified distributions.|$|E

50|$|Ranking <b>index</b> <b>method,</b> {{applied to}} {{document}} database model, enables Clusterpoint to outperform SQL databases at search by several orders of magnitude. It solves information overload and latency problem for interactive web and mobile applications processing Big data. Today limited-size mobile device screens and network bandwidth restrictions prevent users requesting and processing large size data volumes per each query. Database search and querying {{need to be}} interactive and transactional to satisfy Internet users. Clusterpoint ranking index was designed for this computing model. It extracts relevant data first and returns information page by page in decreasing relevance. For instance, using only free text search, latency in large databases containing billions of document will be milliseconds, while relevance ranking will prevent overwhelming end-user with too much low-quality search results. This is also a crucial design element for distributed document database architecture: it makes its index scalable {{so that it can}} be safely shared across large cluster of servers without significant performance loss at data injection, free text search and access.|$|E
50|$|Success Likelihood <b>Index</b> <b>Method</b> (SLIM) is a {{technique}} used {{in the field of}} Human reliability Assessment (HRA), for the purposes of evaluating the probability of a human error occurring throughout the completion of a specific task. From such analyses measures can then be taken to reduce the likelihood of errors occurring within a system and therefore lead to an improvement in the overall levels of safety. There exist three primary reasons for conducting an HRA; error identification, error quantification and error reduction. As there exist a number of techniques used for such purposes, they can be split into one of two classifications; first generation techniques and second generation techniques. First generation techniques work {{on the basis of the}} simple dichotomy of ‘fits/doesn’t fit’ in the matching of the error situation in context with related error identification and quantification and second generation techniques are more theory based in their assessment and quantification of errors. ‘HRA techniques have been utilised in a range of industries including healthcare, engineering, nuclear, transportation and business sector; each technique has varying uses within different disciplines.|$|E
