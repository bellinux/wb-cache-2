Attempts to ‘nail down ’ the definition of projects reflect what Mitroff and Linstone[1993] call an overly ‘technical ’ or objective perspective.

The authors arranged a small ‘town and gown’ colloquium to explore the problems and possible solutions to project <b>definition.</b> <b>Drawing</b> on this, and many years of their own project definition experience, the paper argues that project definition has to be explicitly treated as something that will constantly grow with client and designer interaction.

These manufacturing dimensions also serve to satisfy not only the functional requirements given in the <b>definition</b> <b>drawing,</b> but also the manufacturing constraints, for example geometrical defects of the machine, vibration and the wear of the cutting tool. In this paper, an experimental study {{on the influence of}} the wear of the cutting tool (systematic dispersions) is explored. This study was carried out on three stages. The first stage allows machining without elimination of dispersions (random, systematic) so the tolerances of manufacture according to total dispersions. In the second stage, the results of the first stage are filtered in such way to obtain the tolerances according to random dispersions. Finally, from the two previous stages, the systematic dispersions are generated. The objective {{of this study is to}} model by the least squares method the error of manufacture based on systematic dispersion. Finally, an approach of optimization of the manufacturing tolerances was developed for machining on a CNC machine tool.

40|$|This thesis {{presents}} {{an inquiry into}} the concept and phenomena of content marketing and its corresponding market in Sweden by attending to its constituent practices. By adopting a practice based approach to markets, influenced by recent developments in economic sociology, it utilizes a constructivist  view of markets as constantly forming and emerging. This allows examination of a concept that is novel, ambiguously defined yet increasingly popular by focusing on its practical enactments along with actors' conceptions and ideas in order to study what constitutes content marketing. By archival analysis of trade media, examination of industry media and in-depth interviews with content marketing practitioners the paper highlights the formatting effect of ideas on practice, the existence of multiple and conflicting definitions and enactments of content marketing and the implications thereof. It also shows how different categories of content marketing practice are connected and interlinked, before arriving at a <b>definition</b> <b>drawing</b> on practitioners descriptions, enactments and ideas central to the market. The thesis contributes with an inquiry into content marketing where academic research is scant and also provides an empirical application of theory from the growing research tradition concerned with a practice approach to markets. ...|$|E
40|$|We exhibit {{intrinsic}} {{definitions of}} inequality tests, sorting functions and comparators as isomorphic presentations of total preorders (orders) : • Inequality tests are functions of type T × T → Bool that are reflexive, transitive and total. • Sorting functions are functions of type T ∗ → T ∗ (mapping finite sequences of elements of type T) that permute their input {{and do so}} consistently for each pair of elements. • Comparators are functions of type T × T → T × T that are permutative, transitive and idempotent. The definitions are intrinsic {{in the sense that}} they do not refer to predefined orders or to each other. Furthermore the isomorphisms can be defined parametrically polymorphically: the mapping from inequality tests to sorting functions is the class of stable comparator-based sorting algorithms; from comparators to sorting functions it is sorting networks (comparator-based sorting algorithms); the other mappings are trivial. So defining any one concrete presentation of an order automatically provides all three presentations. Whilst mathematically elementary and pleasingly simple, we believe our definitions of sorting functions and comparators as isomorphic characterizations of orders to be novel and of interest in themselves. We investigate a number of variations on the definition of sorting functions to illustrate that some care must be exercised in formulating their <b>definition.</b> <b>Drawing</b> on the resulting conceptual symmetry of inequality tests, sorting functions and comparators—no presentation has definitional preeminence over the other—we raise the question: How should orders be presented?

Our <b>definition</b> <b>draws</b> upon the distinction between the notion of an instant snapshot of observables (a situation) and the composition of these observables over time (a context). Observables and their relationships, which are elicited at the design stage of the development process, can be mapped, at the implementation phase, as colonies of contextors. A contextor is a software abstraction that models relationships between observables. Contextors share a common I/O structure including control channels and meta-data to ensure and express QoS (e. g., precision, stability), as well as common properties such as reflexivity and remanence. They can be combined as oriented graphs or encapsulated into higher computational units...|$|R

Our <b>definition</b> <b>draws</b> from Barbour's best-matching framework developed for the purpose of implementing spatial and temporal relationalism. Among other interesting theories, general relativity can be derived within this framework in novel ways. We study the detailed canonical structure {{of a wide range of}} best matching theories and show that their actions must have a local gauge symmetry. When gauge theory is derived in this way, we obtain at the same time a conceptual framework for distinguishing between background dependent and independent theories. Gauge invariant observables satisfying Kuchar's criterion are identified and, in simple cases, explicitly computed. We propose a procedure for inserting a global background time into temporally relational theories. Interestingly, using this procedure in general relativity leads to unimodular gravity.

40|$|The present thesis {{explores the}} {{critique}} of aesthetic experience in aesthetics {{of the second half}} of the 20 th century. The aim is to defend the consistency of the notion of aesthetic experience and highlight its potential for aesthetics in the 21 st century. The thesis points out certain historical and conceptual inconsistencies in the critique, and advances some arguments in support of tenebality of traditionally the main distinctive feature of aesthetic experience: disinterestedness. We focus on two dominant discussions in modern aesthetics that both built on re-evaluation and crititique of the concept of aesthetic experience, namely the controversy about the aesthetic nature of art, and the so-called rebirth of theoretical interest in aesthetic dimension of nature (and other living environments).

40|$|The {{concept of}} primary {{international}} institutions is a core {{idea of the}} English School and central to those scholars from Bull to Buzan who have sought {{to take it in}} a more sociological direction. Yet the English School has traditionally found it difficult to define and identify with consistency the institutions of international society. A group of scholars, here called the “new institutionalists,” have recently sought to address this problem by devising tighter definitions and applying them more rigorously. But different understandings and lists of institutions continue to proliferate. The source of the problem is the reliance on “stipulative” <b>definitions,</b> <b>drawn</b> from an increasingly abstract theoretical literature. The problem is compounded by the new institutionalists’ employment of social structural and other “outsider” methods of social research. This article argues that it is only possible to empirically ground institutions, a task on which all agree, by returning to the interpretive “insider” approach traditionally associated with the school—but employing it in a much more rigorous way. To this end it makes the case for a “grounded theory” of international institutions inspired by Chicago School sociology...|$|R
