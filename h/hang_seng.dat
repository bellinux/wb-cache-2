2500|$|Soon, {{the stock}} rush began. New stocks were on sale every day; {{brokerage}} houses mushroomed; some people quit their own jobs to become full-time investors, suffering {{a kind of}} urban disease which the doctors simply named [...] "stock illness". It is said that the investors during this period numbered to 500,000. The <b>Hang</b> <b>Seng</b> Index kept soaring, but not for long.

Although the <b>Hang</b> <b>Seng</b> Index fell by 2.59% during the [...] "Golden Week", it recovered and trading volume rose considerably. Shanghai Daily published on 4 October {{estimated that the}} protests had cost Hong Kong HK$40billion ($5.2billion), with tourism and retail reportedly being hardest hit. However, tourist numbers for the [...] "Golden Week" [...] (beginning 1 October) were 4.83% higher than the previous year, according to the Hong Kong Tourism Board. While substantial losses by retailer were predicted, some stores reported a marked increase in sales. Triad gangs, which had reportedly suffered a 40% decline in revenues, were implicated in the attacks in Mong Kok, {{where some of the}} worst violence had occurred. Economic effects seemed either to be extremely localised or transient, and in any event much less than the dire predictions of business lobbies. One of the hardest hit may have been the Hong Kong Tramways Company, which reported a decline in revenues of US$1million. An economist said that the future stability will depend on political governance, namely if political issues such as income gaps and political reforms will be addressed.|$|E
2500|$|Today, the Jardine Matheson Group {{is still}} very much active in Hong Kong, being one of the largest {{conglomerates}} in Hong Kong and its largest employer, second only to the government. Several landmarks in present-day Hong Kong are named after the firm and the founders Jardine and Matheson like Jardine's Bazaar, Jardine's Crescent, Jardine's Bridge, Jardine's Lookout, Yee Wo Street, Matheson Street, Jardine House and the Noon Day Gun. Jardines is also active in China, North America, Europe, Australia, the Middle East and parts of Africa. [...] It went through several major internal changes throughout the 19th and 20th century. [...] In 1947, a secret Trust was formed by members of the family to retain effective control over the company. [...] Jardine, Matheson and Co. offered its shares to the public in 1961 under the tenure of Sir Hugh Barton and was oversubscribed 56 times. The Keswick family, in consortium with several London-based banks and financial institutions, bought out the controlling shares of the Buchanan-Jardine family in 1959, but subsequently sold most of the shares during the 1961 public offering, retaining only about 10% of the company. The company had its head office redomiciled to Bermuda in 1984 under the tenure of Simon Keswick to maintain control after nearly being taken over by Chinese tycoon Li Ka-shing of Cheung Kong after a hostile raid in 1980. Li, who bought nearly 20% of the company at that time the largest shareholding in the company, agreed to sell his shares to Hongkong Land, a sister company of Jardines, at a premium. [...] Another reason for the move was fear of the Chinese take-over of Hong Kong and the threat of Chinese retaliation for Jardines drug smuggling past. [...] Subsequent events led to the cross-shareholding structure between Jardine, Matheson & Co. and Hongkong Land which was first instigated in 1980 by then taipan David Newbigging. [...] In 1988, instigated by Brian Powers, the first American taipan of Jardines, the entire corporate structure of Jardine, Matheson & Co., including all its allied companies, were restructured so that a holding company based in London and controlled by the Keswick family would have overall policy and strategic control of all Jardine Matheson Group companies. [...] The firm delisted from the Hong Kong Stock exchange (<b>Hang</b> <b>Seng</b> Index) in 1994 under the tenure of Alasdair Morrison and placed its primary listing in London and its secondary listing in Singapore. [...] The present Chairman of Jardine Matheson Holdings Ltd. is Sir Henry Keswick, who is based in the UK, was the company's tai-pan from 1970 (aged 31) to 1975 and was the 6th Keswick to be tai-pan of the company. His brother, Simon, was the company's taipan from 1983 to 1988 and is the 7th Keswick to be tai-pan. Both brothers are the 4th generation of Keswicks in the company. [...] The firm's present managing director or tai-pan is Anthony Nightingale who is based in Hong Kong. [...] The organizational structure of Jardines has changed almost totally, but the members of the family of Dr. William Jardine still control the firm through a complex cross-shareholding structure, several allied shareholders and a secretive 1947 Trust.|$|E
