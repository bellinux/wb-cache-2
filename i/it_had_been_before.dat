5|$|Culturally speaking, post-Civil War Massachusetts {{ceased to}} be a {{national}} center of idealistic reform movements (such as evangelicalism, temperance and antislavery) as <b>it</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>before</b> the war. Growing industrialism, partly spurred on by the war, created a new culture of competition and materialism.|$|E
5|$|In 215 Caracalla {{introduced}} the antoninianus, a coin intended {{to serve as}} a double denarius. This new currency, however, had a silver purity of about 52% for the period between 215 and 217 and an actual size ratio of 1antoninianus to 1.5denarii. This in effect made the antoninianus equal to about 1.5denarii. The reduced silver purity of the coins caused people to hoard the old coins that had higher silver content, making the inflation problem caused by the earlier devaluation of the denarii worse than <b>it</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>before.</b>|$|E
5|$|The Reform Act itself did {{not affect}} {{constituencies}} in Scotland or Ireland. However, reforms there were {{carried out by the}} Scottish Reform Act and the Irish Reform Act. Scotland received eight additional seats, and Ireland received five; thus keeping the total number of seats in the House of Commons the same as <b>it</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>before</b> the Act. While no constituencies were disfranchised in either of those countries, voter qualifications were standardised {{and the size of the}} electorate was expanded in both.|$|E

5|$|In 2009, leaks in {{the mall}} roof and mold caused Elliot Lake city councilors to {{consider}} moving the Elliot Lake Public Library out of the mall {{and back to the}} Solomon Building, where <b>it</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>before</b> 1992. Many books were damaged, despite library staff using tarps to cover shelves. At some points, entire sections were blocked for public health reasons. Much of the leaking was said to be corrected, before council considered the issue, and an environmental study was completed. Some library board members and councilors worried that liability insurance wouldn't cover them {{in the mall}}, despite reassurances by library management and the city's insurance broker. With a multi-use complex in the works, some of the library board was concerned with a five-year lease that mall management was pursuing, despite the library's preference for a 2.5-year lease. In the end, the library remained at the mall.|$|E
5|$|The {{constellation}} {{was known}} by other names. It was called Tubus Astronomicus {{in the eighteenth}} century, during which time three constellations depicting telescopes were recognised—Tubus Herschelii Major between Gemini and Auriga and Tubus Herschelii Minor between Taurus and Orion, both of which {{had fallen out of}} use by the nineteenth century. Johann Bode called it the Astronomische Fernrohr in his 1805 Gestirne and kept its size, but later astronomers Francis Baily and Benjamin Gould subsequently shrank its boundaries. The much-reduced constellation lost several brighter stars to neighbouring constellations: Beta Telescopii became Eta Sagittarii, which <b>it</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>before</b> Lacaille placed it in Telescopium, Gamma was placed in Scorpius and renamed G Scorpii by Gould, Theta Telescopii reverted to its old appellation of d Ophiuchi, and Sigma Telescopii was placed in Corona Australis. Initially uncatalogued, the latter is now known as HR 6875. The original object Lacaille had named Eta Telescopii—the open cluster Messier 7—was in what is now Scorpius, and Gould used the Bayer designation for a magnitude 5 star, which he felt warranted a letter.|$|E

25|$|During the war, Guthrie's Louisville and Nashville {{railroad}} was {{of vital}} importance. It {{was the only}} rail line originating in the North and terminating in the South. Early in the war, the line was used to transport supplies to the Confederates in Tennessee, but after 1861, it was used primarily to benefit the Union. Despite pressure to relinquish control to the federal government, Guthrie remained president of the railroad, which became a frequent target for guerrilla attacks. Combining earnings from both passenger and military rates, Guthrie ensured that the line's infrastructure {{at the close of}} the war was superior to what <b>it</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>before</b> the war started.|$|E

25|$|Though {{sometimes}} {{depicted as}} a key moment in Prussia's rise to greatness, the war nonetheless left Prussia weak: the kingdom's economy and population were devastated (though Frederick's extensive agrarian reforms and encouragement of immigration soon eased both problems); its armed forces had suffered heavy losses (particularly in the officer corps), and the state {{could not afford to}} rebuild the army to what <b>it</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>before</b> the war. In the succeeding War of the Bavarian Succession (1778–1779), the Prussians fought poorly, despite again being personally led by Frederick, and the Prussian army did not fare well against revolutionary France in 1792–1795. In 1806 the Prussians were annihilated by Napoleon's French at the Battle of Jena; only after a series of reforms motivated by the disasters of 1806–1807 did Prussian power again begin to grow.|$|E

With the political climate of Europe changed, and with the powerful monarchs who had called for the suppression of the Society no longer in power, Pope Pius VII issued an order restoring the Society of Jesus in the Catholic countries of Europe.

One month after the battle, the Grand Fleet was stronger than <b>it</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>before</b> sailing to Jutland. Warspite was dry docked at Rosyth, returning to the fleet on 22 July, while Malaya was repaired in the floating dock at Invergordon, returning to duty on 11 July. Barham was docked for a month at Devonport before undergoing speed trials and returning to Scapa on 8 July. Princess Royal stayed initially at Rosyth but transferred to dry dock at Portsmouth before returning to duty at Rosyth 21 July. Tiger was dry docked at Rosyth and ready for service 2 July. Queen Elizabeth, Emperor of India and , which had been undergoing maintenance {{at the time of the}} battle, returned to the fleet immediately, followed shortly after by Resolution and Ramillies.

500|$|To prevent ethical conflicts, James Madison {{proposed}} language at the Constitutional Convention {{that was}} adopted as the Ineligibility Clause after debate and modification by other Founding Fathers. Historically, {{a number of}} approaches {{have been taken to}} address the problem posed by restriction; these have included choosing another nominee, allowing the desired nominee's elected term of office to expire, ignoring the clause entirely, or reducing the offending emoluments to the level prior to when the nominee took office. Although Congress passed the mechanism reducing emoluments in 1909, the procedure was named [...] "Saxbe fix" [...] after Senator William Saxbe, who was confirmed as Attorney General in 1973 after Congress reduced the office's salary to the level <b>it</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>before</b> Saxbe's term commenced.
