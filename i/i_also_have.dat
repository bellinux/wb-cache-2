500|$|She {{moved into}} the teen-pop genre, as she felt that {{restyling}} herself to match the image of Spears and Aguilera would help remake her career. She separated from her then-boyfriend Nick Lachey, in March 2001, feeling the need to concentrate on her career. Her new image was promoted through appearances on many events, where Simpson wore revealing outfits. The development of this image coincided with the production and release of her second studio effort, Irresistible. Simpson said {{that she wanted to}} portray a [...] "sexier, more mature style" [...] in her new album. [...] "I recorded Sweet Kisses when I was 17 years old and I'm 21 [...] so there is four years of growth involved," [...] Simpson {{said in an interview with}} Coventry Newspapers in July 2001. In an interview with Cosmopolitan in June 2001, she explained, [...] "This record is about who I am now. The music is edgier, and I'm all grown up." [...] According to Terri Doughtery, author of People in the News: Jessica Simpson and Nick Lachey, Simpson hoped her new image would bring more attention to the power of her voice. [...] "It's not just me singing about being in love. <b>I</b> <b>also</b> <b>have</b> heartbreak songs and girls telling off guys songs. It's going to take me a while to recoup [...] this album, because we spent a lot of money on it," [...] Simpson said to Entertainment Weekly.|$|E

In his second season, he scored 11 goals and began to garner attention throughout the league. Mallorca President Mateo Alemany said of his style of play, [...] "I doubt if there is any other player in the world who would please the fans more at this moment."

She responded, [...] "I tried to be really, really respectful of the original Dallas because it was really clear to me that the people who love Dallas are [...] Trekkies, really committed to that show and I really did not understand that before, so I never wanted to violate anything that had happened in the past.

2500|$|Off-screen, actress Lucy Speed {{had decided}} to leave the serial after playing Natalie for a year, as she was {{reportedly}} “freaked out” by the media attention she was receiving from being in such a high-profile show. In an interview with the ‘’Walford Gazette’’, Speed commented: “I was very frightened by it quite frankly and certainly unprepared for it. I didn't like at all the attention that came with being on such a high-profile show. It simply wasn't what I signed up for in the first place-all that craziness. I was naive, I admit. Of course it does come with the job of being on the show and {{you have to learn to}} deal with it and cope with it. The advantages always outweigh the drawbacks, anyway, but it didn't seem like that to me at the time. I was very young and extremely shy, so it all became a huge difficulty for me…But <b>I</b> <b>also</b> <b>have</b> to make it clear that from the beginning when I joined, I always intended to stay in it for just a year anyway. I honoured my initial one-year contract and then moved on…they did express their interest in signing me for another year, but I politely but firmly declined. They were a bit shocked. I tried to explain in the best way I could my reasons for leaving at the end of my contract and they ultimately understood, and so I left on good terms with them…I had some growing up to do and instinctively knew that growing up more or less in front of the British public for one year was enough!” ...|$|E
