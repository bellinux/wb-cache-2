40|$|The next {{generation}} of database management, <b>directory</b> <b>browsing,</b> information retrieval, hypermedia, scientific data management, and library systems can enable convenient exploration of growing information spaces by {{a wider range of}} users. User interface designers can provide more powerful search techniques, more comprehensible query facilities, better presentation methods, and smoother integration of technology with task. This paper offers novel graphical and direct manipulation approaches to query formulation and information presentation/manipulation. These approaches include a graphical approach to restricted boolean query formulation based on generalization/aggregation hierarchies, a filter/flow metaphor for complete boolean expressions, dynamic query methods with continuous visual presentation of results as the query is changed (possibly employing parallel computation), and color-coded 2 -dimensional space-filling tree-maps that present multiple-level hierarchies in a single display (hundreds of directories and more than a thousand files can be seen at once).

40|$|Use of {{peer-to-peer}} {{technologies have}} been prevalent in sharing files and media over internet. This project proposes a new cooperative file sharing and storage {{system that allows}} users to store, share and find files over a robust and scalable network. This system is based on peer-to-peer technologies and provides a self-managed, decentralized, efficient, load-balanced and distributed way to store and retrieve files on peer nodes. Each node donates storage space to the system and also does routing of client messages based on Pastry[14] location protocol. This system uses replication based on erasure codes for increasing efficiency in providing persistent storage. The system also provides its users with a global hierarchical <b>directory</b> structure to <b>browse</b> for files – like a file-system. We present the system, its features, its architecture design and our progress in this report. ...|$|R

40|$|This {{study is}} an {{initiative}} to develop user-centered Web search tools {{based on the}} broadband Internet 2 and software agent technology. A conceptual model analyzing the Web search process including Web <b>directory</b> <b>browsing</b> and text-based keyword search is presented from human cognitive aspects and system design. Four new user-centered features were proposed to improve the usability of the Internet 2 search tools. They are the graphical Web directory, which presents the hierarchical structure of a Web directory with graphical interface; the attribute-aided search, which helps the users with domain knowledge in defining keywords; the dynamic hint, which provides interactive thesaurus help in keyword formation; and the classification for review, which supports the users 2 ̆ 7 decision making by classifying search results systematically. The software prototype of the search engines and Web browsers were developed using dynamic HTML, ASP, and JavaScript. Three experiments were conducted with 80 subjects to test five hypotheses concerning {{the validity of the}} conceptual model and the effectiveness of the four user-centered features. ^ By contrasting the user-centered features with the current Web directory and search engines, the results of the hypotheses testing show that, in searching the Web, graphical Web directory, attribute-aided search, and classification for review significantly improve the users 2 ̆ 7 performance and satisfaction level. Dynamic hints improve the users 2 ̆ 7 satisfaction level, but do not improve the users 2 ̆ 7 performance. The results of the study also suggest guidelines for user interface design on information categorization, decision support, and memory workload for the usability of Web search tools. ...|$|E
40|$|A Web Application Firewall (WAF) is a {{security}} tool {{that protects the}} web application and web application server from various attacks. Application protection is a valuable security layer to add because it can protect against a number of application layer security threats which is usually not protected by a typical network layer intrusion detection system. The Web Application can easily be attacked by the hackers even though with {{the existence of the}} normal firewall in the system. This is due to the limitation that the normal firewall does not work in the application layer. The hackers will attack the Web Application using the methods like structured Query Language (SQL) Injection, Cross Site Scripting (XSS), Command Injection, or Session Manipulation, cookie poisoning, <b>Directory</b> traversal, Forceful <b>browsing.</b> This paper addresses these problems by presenting a methodology for the automatic detection of vulnerabilities in web application and preventing web application from various attacks. The proposed methodology, implemented in this paper monitors all the incoming and outgoing data in the web application and blocks web related attacks like SQL injection attacks, Cross Site Scripting attacks, Buffer Overflow attacks, Cookie poisoning,Forceful <b>browsing</b> and <b>Directory</b> traversal attacks...|$|R
5000|$|Windows Vista, by default, {{references}} {{the profile}} of the user who originally created a saved search as part of the query's scope, which includes the disk partition. This design choice does not prevent saved searches from being shared with other users, but it prevents them from operating on different partitions or user profiles. While users can manually modify the contents of a saved search so that the scope references the %USERPROFILE% environment variable, which will enable it to operate on other machines or profiles regardless of the original author or location, Microsoft has released a SearchMelt Creator utility that automates this process for the user.In early development builds of Windows Vista, there existed pre-configured Search Folders for the default user profile folders (e.g., Documents, Music, and Pictures) that replaced the links to these folders seen on the Windows Start menu. When <b>browsing</b> <b>directories</b> in Windows Explorer, the navigation pane would feature predefined Search Folders that were relevant to a currently viewed directory. When viewing the Documents folder, for example, the navigation pane would populate with individual Search Folders based on authors of documents, their ratings, their keywords, their types, and documents that were recently changed.|$|R
40|$|The Data Information and Management System (DIMS) {{is a new}} {{generation}} facility from DLR-DFD to handle earth observation products. DIMS is a multi-mission ground system and will be configured to support the tasks performed {{within the framework of}} the upcoming programs/missions such as the Shuttle Radar Topography Mission (SRTM), EUMETSAT Polar System (EPS) or ENVISAT. The DIMS components follow a modular design based on CORBA AND Java, providing: o Communication independant from platform and programming language o Relocatable and distributed services o Reusable basic components used to build up application components o Platform independent software DIMS is responsible for user information services (including on-line delivery), off-line delivery, post-processing, the product library, ordering control and production control. A cornerstone is the product library which is the source of processing input and the destination of the processing output. It provides a complete and consistent reference to the configured products. Based on the product library, ordering control manages the business process ordering throughout the system. A unified operating tool provides interactive access for the above components. Interfaces to related systems like EPS ground segment, Unified Meteorological Archive and Retrieval Facility (UMARF) or ENVISAT Payload Data Segment (PDS) are foreseen to exchange products, catalogue and order information. The near real-time, as well as the off-line services, are provided by DIMS. The experience gained at DFD in managing large amounts of meteorological and earth observation data and a modern system design, using state-of-the-art technologies, resulted in the valuable features offered by DIMS: o Multi-mission facility, supporting products from many sensors/satellites/missions in parallel o User information services including guide, <b>directory,</b> inventory, <b>browse</b> and ordering o Product library, including automatic robot archive and inventory with optimized spatial access methods o Robot archive, with an extendable capacity of 300 Tbyte o Interfacing of local and remote processors o Product delivery on media or via Internet o Support of distributed sites based on interoperability with CORBA The software is foreseen for installation and configuration at other institutions...|$|R
40|$|When {{search results}} against digital {{libraries}} and web resources have limited metadata, augmenting them with meaningful and stable category information can enable better overviews and support user exploration. This paper proposes six “fast-feature” techniques that use only features {{available in the}} search result list, such as title, snippet, and URL, to categorize results into meaningful categories. They use credible knowledge resources, including a US government organizational hierarchy, a thematic hierarchy from the Open Directory Project (ODP) web <b>directory,</b> and personal <b>browse</b> histories, to add valuable metadata to search results. In three tests the percent of results categorized for five representative queries was high enough to suggest practical benefits: general web search (76 - 90 %), government web search (39 - 100 %), and the Bureau of Labor Statistics website (48 - 94 %). An additional test submitted 250 TREC queries to a search engine and successfully categorized 66 % of the top 100 using the ODP and 61 % of the top 350. Fast-feature techniques have been implemented in a prototype search engine. We propose research directions to improve categorization rates and make suggestions about how web site designers could re-organize their sites to support fast categorization of search results...|$|R
