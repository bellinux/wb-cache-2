25|$|From the 16th century, {{following}} French practice, the apostrophe {{was used}} when a vowel letter was omitted {{either because of}} incidental elision (I’m <b>for</b> <b>I</b> <b>am)</b> or because the letter no longer represented a sound (lov’d for loved). English spelling retained many inflections that were not pronounced as syllables, notably verb endings (-est, -eth, -es, -ed) and the noun ending -es, which marked either plurals or possessives (also known as genitives; see Possessive apostrophe, below). So apostrophe followed by s was often used to mark a plural, especially when the noun was a loan word (and especially a word ending in a, as in the two comma’s).|$|E

500|$|Reinfeldt {{has said}} that he left the Church of Sweden when he was {{eighteen}} years old, critical of the left-leaning perspectives of the church.

But exactly what it is I don't have an answer <b>for,</b> <b>I</b> <b>am</b> both searching and wondering." [...] He was however married, and had his children baptized in the Church of Sweden.|$|E

500|$|Loevs {{script was}} penned by Sudhanshu Saria [...] in the United States, {{when he was}} working on the {{screenplay}} of another film, I Am Here. Describing the film as [...] "small, fragile, honest", Saria said that through his endeavour he [...] "tries to capture the silences and the things unsaid in male friendships". He wrote Loev because he was unable to put together the financing <b>for</b> <b>I</b> <b>Am</b> Here. At the time of the script's inception, Saria had no plan of making it into a feature film, as he believed that no investors or actors would want to be associated with a film that he thought would be censored or banned in its home country. The plot of the film follows many personal experiences that Saria himself went through, growing up in the Indian hill town of Darjeeling, and later at the Ithaca Arts College, New York.|$|E

In 2010, Beyoncé was featured on Lady Gaga's single [...] "Telephone" [...] and appeared in its music video.

500|$|Chastain began 2017 {{by serving}} as the {{executive}} producer and providing the narration <b>for</b> <b>I</b> <b>Am</b> Jane Doe, a documentary on sex trafficking. In an effort to work with more female filmmakers, Chastain starred in two projects directed by womenNiki Caro's The Zookeeper's Wife and Susanna White's Woman Walks Ahead. In the former, an adaptation of Diane Ackerman's non-fiction book of the same name, she co-starred with Johan Heldenbergh as the real-life Polish zookeepers Jan and Antonina Żabiński who saved many human and animal lives during World War II. The film received mixed reviews, although Stephen Holden took note of how Chastain's [...] "watchful, layered performance" [...] empowered the film. Woman Walks Ahead {{tells the story of}} the 19th-century activist Catherine Weldon, who served as an adviser to the Sioux chieftain Sitting Bull prior to the Wounded Knee Massacre. She was interested in portraying a role that young girls could look up to for inspiration, and provided off-screen inputs to avoid a white savior narrative.|$|E

500|$|Ocala Star-Banner critic Jon Burlingame {{praised the}} episode for its [...] "smart humor" [...] and stated the show {{could be a}} perfect fit between Cheers and L.A. Law. Mike Flaherty and Mary Kaye Schilling of Entertainment Weekly reacted very {{positively}} to the episode and praised Alexander's performance in particular, stating [...] "George's profound self-hatred is now in full bloom ('Please, a little respect, <b>for</b> <b>I</b> <b>am</b> Costanza, Lord of the Idiots!'). Kramer's input, meanwhile, remains limited to off-the-wall, often annoying cameos. Which reminds us: Why {{in the world has}} Alexander been denied an Emmy, while Richards has scored two?" [...] Schilling and Flaherty graded the episode with a B+. However, The Kitchener-Waterloo Record critic Bonnie Malleck gave the episode a particular negative review, comparing Seinfeld to It's Garry Shandling's Show, she stated [...] "Seinfeld isn't neurotic enough to be as funny as [...] So, instead of being nervously funny, he's just nervously dull".|$|E
500|$|But here I {{would not}} be misunderstood. By the love of our country, I do not mean loyalty to our King, for that is a duty of another nature, and a man may be very loyal, in the common sense of the word, without one grain of public good in his heart. Witness this very kingdom we live in. I verily believe, that since the {{beginning}} of the world, no nation upon earth ever shewed (all circumstances considered), such high constant marks of loyalty in all their action and behaviour as we have done; and at the same time, no people ever appeared more utterly void of what is called public spirit ... therefore, I shall think my time not ill-spent if I can persuade most and all of you who hear me, to shew the love you have for your country by endeavouring in your several situations to do all the public good you can. <b>For</b> <b>I</b> <b>am</b> certain persuaded that all our misfortunes arise from no other original cause than that general disregard among us to the public welfare.|$|E

This rating is the icing on our silver anniversary cake." [...] Jay Hunt, controller of BBC One commented: [...] " [...] extraordinary live episode was a fitting celebration of 25 magnificent years for EastEnders. The audience were clearly gripped {{by one of the}} greatest soap whodunnits ever." [...] Discussing the ratings for EastEnders Live: The Aftermath, controller of BBC Three Danny Cohen appraised: [...] "It is an amazing testament to the EastEnders team and the brave and brilliant drama they provided." [...] Yorke responded to the high consolidated ratings with the statement: [...] "The best birthday present EastEnders could possibly have is to know that 25 years in it can still grab the biggest audience in the UK. It's a real tribute to the show's creators that {{a quarter of a century}} on, everybody's still talking about it." ...|$|E
