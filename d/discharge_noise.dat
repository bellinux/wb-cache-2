40|$|A {{large portion}} of the noise in the light output of a laser {{oscillator}} is associated with the noise in the laser discharge. The effect of the <b>discharge</b> <b>noise</b> on the laser output has been studied. The <b>discharge</b> <b>noise</b> has been explained through an ac equivalent circuit of the laser discharge tube. The <b>discharge</b> <b>noise</b> corresponds to time-varying spatial fluctuations in the electron density, the inverted population density and the dielectric permittivity of the laser medium from their equilibrium values. These fluctuations cause a shift in the resonant frequencies of the laser cavity. When the fluctuation in the dielectric permittivity of the laser medium is a longitudinally traveling wave (corresponding to the case in which moving striations exist in the positive column of the laser discharge), the laser output is frequency modulated. The <b>discharge</b> <b>noise</b> has been analyzed by representing the laser discharge by an equivalent circuit. An appropriate ac equivalent circuit of a laser discharge tube has been obtained by considering the frequency spectrum of the current response of the discharge tube to an ac voltage modulation. It consist of a series ρLC circuit, which represents the discharge region, in parallel with a capacitance C', which comes mainly from the stray wiring. The equivalent inductance and capacitance of the discharge region have been calculated from the values of the resonant frequencies measured on discharge currents, gas pressures and lengths of the positive column. The experimental data provide for a set of typical values and dependencies on the discharge parameters for the equivalent inductance and capacitance of a discharge under laser operating conditions. It has been concluded from the experimental data that the equivalent inductance originates mainly from the positive column while the equivalent capacitance is due to the discharge region other than the positive column. The ac equivalent circuit of the laser discharge has been shown analytically and experimentally to be applicable to analyzing the internal <b>discharge</b> <b>noise.</b> Experimental measurements have been made on the frequency of moving striations in a laser discharge. Its experimental dependence on the discharge current agrees very well with the expected dependence obtained from an analysis of the circuit and the experimental data on the equivalent circuit elements. The agreement confirms the validity of representing a laser discharge tube by its ac equivalent circuit in analyzing the striation phenomenon and other low frequency noises. Data have also been obtained for the variation of the striation frequency with an externally-applied longitudinal magnetic field and the increase in frequency has been attributed to a decrease in the equivalent inductance of the laser discharge. ...|$|E

Bundles of muscle from the fundus of W/WV mice, which lack intramuscular interstitial cells of Cajal (ICCIM) lacked the <b>discharge</b> of membrane <b>noise</b> observed in wild-type tissues. When the membrane potential was changed by passing depolarizing or hyperpolarizing current pulses, the <b>discharge</b> of membrane <b>noise</b> was little changed. The membrane noise was unaffected by adding chloride channel blockers; however, agents which buffered the internal concentration of calcium ions reduced the <b>discharge</b> of membrane <b>noise.</b> Treatment of tissues with CCCP, which interferes with the uptake of calcium ions by mitochondria, also reduced the membrane noise and caused membrane hyperpolarization. Similar observations were made on bundles of tissue isolated from the circular layer of the guinea pig antrum. Together the observations indicate that membrane noise is generated by a pathway located in ICCIM. The properties of this pathway appear to vary dramatically within a given organ.

40|$|Abstract—Previous {{studies have}} shown {{significant}} corre-lated <b>discharges</b> (<b>noise</b> correlation) and synergistic informa-tion coding among adjacent cortical neurons. In order to investigate whether such interactions are present at an ear-lier stage of sensory processing, we compared noise corre-lation and synergistic information transmission in the ventral posterolateral nucleus (VPLn) of thalamus and primary so-matosensory cortex (SI) of anesthetized rats. A hind paw was stimulated electrically and responses of several neighboring neurons were recorded simultaneously with a tetrode. Anal-yses indicated that noise correlation in the SI was about four times {{higher than in the}} VPLn, and, interestingly, it was sig-nificantly reduced following sensory stimulation in both re-gions. Spike count distributions of individual VPLn units contained higher amounts of information about the delivery of external stimulation compared with those of SI units. When simultaneously recorded units were considered together, transmission of information was more interactive (synergis-tic or redundant) among SI than VPLn units. On average, infor-mation transmission was independent in the VPLn, but syner-gistic in the SI. The difference in synergistic information coding was largely attributable to different levels of noise correlation and their modulation by external sensory stimulation. These results indicate that neuronal interactions are relatively low at the thalamic level, but much enhanced at the cortical level along the somatosensory pathway. The enhanced neuronal interac-tions in the cortex may reflect the role of cortex in extracting higher features of sensory stimuli. © 2003 IBRO. Published b...|$|R

The predominate man made radio noise source in the high frequency radio band is gap type breakdown discharges on electric power distribution lines.

Transmural nerve stimulation evoked a fast inhibitory junction potential (fast-IJP) which was followed initially by a smaller amplitude long lasting inhibitory junction potential (slow-IJP) and a period of excitation. The excitatory component of the response was abolished by atropine, suggesting that it resulted from the release of acetylcholine and activation of muscarinic receptors. Fast-IJPs were selectively reduced in amplitude by apamin and slow-IJPs were abolished by Nω-nitro-l-arginine. Slow-IJPs were associated with a drop in membrane noise, suggesting that inhibition resulted from a reduced discharge of unitary potentials by intramuscular interstitial cells of Cajal (ICCIM).

The synaptic organisation and physiology of the dorsal cochlear nucleus (DCN) have been investigated by electrical stimulation of the auditory nerve (1).

To examine this question we have explored the extracellular response of DCN units to both acoustic and electrical stimuli in the barbiturate anaesthetised cat. The electrical stimulus was a train of biphasic current pulses and 2 mA, 100 - 200 μsec/phase and presented at 200 pulses per second via a bipolar electrode inserted into the scala tympani.
