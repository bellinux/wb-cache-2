In particular, it explores the types of learning activities that teachers conduct using <b>dataloggers,</b> the support structures they deem necessary and the difficulties they face. Of the 593 respondents, 394 (67 %) had used <b>dataloggers</b> in the last two years, mainly in demonstrations and set experiments. The three most important support structures included: supportive laboratory technicians, training on the use of <b>dataloggers,</b> and instructional material on how to use <b>dataloggers</b> within the curriculum. The difficulties which deterred the respondents from using <b>dataloggers</b> included the logistics and time taken to set up datalogging equipment and activities, insufficient numbers of computer workstations, and the mishandling of equipment by students, leading to equipment malfunctions. To expand the use of <b>dataloggers</b> in school, the respondents suggest that dedicated laboratories be set up for datalogging activities, more curricular material to support datalogging be prepared, more familiarisation courses be run for teachers and laboratory technicians and, in particular, how <b>dataloggers</b> fit within an inquiry science learning approach. 17 page(s...|$|R

50|$|Released in 1995, the Dacta Control Lab was {{the first}} Lego product to feature the sensors used in later 9V-based {{automated}} Lego products. The control lab was a <b>datalogger,</b> which featured four passive input ports, four active input ports, eight controllable 9V output ports, and one continuous output port. It also featured a manual-override stop-button. The control panel connected to a computer using a serial-port with a specially designed adapter cable and a supplied computer-program allowed the user to conditionally program the outputs. This allowed for robotic operation of mostly stationary Lego inventions. The Control Lab superseded the old 4.5V PC interface from 1989, which {{was the first}} fully programmable Lego interface.|$|E

5000|$|The seventh {{round at}} the Catalan Grand Prix in Barcelona shaped {{the rest of}} Gibernau's season {{and the rest of}} his career, in an {{extraordinary}} crash described later by race commentators as [...] "Terrifying" [...] and [...] "I have never been so scared in my life, commentating a race". In the crowded first corner, a fast right-hander, Gibernau's teammate Capirossi moved left around traffic across Gibernau's faster line (over 124 mph (198 km/h) at the point of the accident, according to the <b>datalogger)</b> and collected his front brake lever, locking Gibernau's front wheel and flipping his bike end over end. It only narrowly missed landing on the unconscious Gibernau. In the resulting group crash, six riders went into the gravel, five motorcycles were wrecked, three riders were taken to hospital, and race organisers stopped the race. Gibernau's ambulance itself then had an accident on the way to hospital, hitting a bus just 50 metres from the hospital entrance, although he did not suffer any further injury. It was later confirmed that he had concussion and had broken a bone in his hand and re-broken the collar bone broken at Assen, necessitating the removal and replacement of the metal plate. The injuries came at a bad time - Catalunya was the first of five races in six weeks. Gibernau missed the following two races at Assen and Donington Park. Despite feeling weak, he raced in the German and United States rounds and, was never far behind his fitter teammate on identical machinery: on the Sachsenring he finished only three places behind Capirossi, and at Laguna Seca he finished only two places behind. But within three days of returning to Barcelona, he was back in hospital: the titanium plate in his collar bone had weakened, causing complications. He missed the round at Brno in the Czech Republic.|$|E

40|$|Miniature Thermochron iButton <b>dataloggers</b> have {{transformed}} {{the ways in}} which researchers collect thermal data. However, one important limitation is that these <b>dataloggers</b> are not waterproof, which can lead to device failure and loss of data under field conditions. Several methods have been used to increase their water resistance, but no study to date has investigated whether any of these techniques affects the accuracy of temperature readings. Waterproofing potentially could affect the accuracy of iButtons by biasing temperatures or altering rates of warming and cooling. We compared temperature profiles of unmodified Thermochron iButtons (model DS 1921 G) to iButtons that we coated with a clear plastic dip (designed to coat tool handles) to determine whether this waterproof coating affects the accuracy of temperatures they record. We also compared temperatures recorded by uncoated and coated iButtons that were embedded within physical models that mimic frog body temperatures. Finally, we used our field data to test whether coating iButtons with plastic prevents failure of <b>dataloggers</b> during fieldwork. Although we found statistically significant differences between the temperatures recorded by uncoated and coated iButtons, and also between uncoated and coated iButtons embedded in frog models, these effects were relatively small (0 – 1. 3 °C). We also found that coating iButtons with plastic reduced the likelihood of device failure under field conditions (from 8. 3 % to 0 %). We conclude that coating Thermochron iButtons with plastic is an affordable and reliable method of waterproofing <b>dataloggers</b> that prevents device failure and data loss with minimal influence on temperature readings...|$|R

This work especially focuses on systems capable of recording and storing measured data for later evaluation - the <b>dataloggers.</b> The introduction {{of this work}} is devoted to a survey among physics teachers that should investigate what form of instructions they prefer; then a brief search of existing ma- terials follows. The {{main part of the}} work consists of newly created instructions for experiments with <b>dataloggers</b> of the Vernier experimental system, primarily designed to serve tea- chers to implement physics experiments in their teaching. The instructions always include a description how to prepare and undertake the measurement, how to process the measured data and what questions and tasks for students can be connected with this part of physics. Experiments described in this work mainly focus on secondary school thermodynamics (or more precisely on molecular physics and thermals) and their thematic intersection is energy, its forms, transmission and conservation...|$|R

40|$|This thesis investigates {{whether the}} use of {{hand-held}} technology affects motivation and learning in science. An innovative mixed methods approach was used to provide new insights into an emerging area of research. First, two pilot observational studies were conducted, which aimed to establish how a school currently uses hand held <b>dataloggers,</b> and gain further insight into how learners respond to this technology. This {{was followed by a}} primarily quantitative experiment that was concerned with the role of data ownership and the impact of ‘seams’ on the transformation process of the collected data. The results indicated that a hands-on experience increased confidence among students in explaining their own data, as opposed to data collected by someone else. A third study was designed to compare how student motivation and learning were affected when carrying out the same inquiry task either with or without the support of <b>dataloggers.</b> The results revealed no difference in accuracy or motivation for learning. The final, fourth, study was a longitudinal study designed in collaboration with a secondary science teacher, comparing three conditions: the inclusion of cameras to support student reflection, the inclusion of both cameras and {{the use of}} <b>dataloggers</b> to support teaching, and a control condition where the lessons were not changed. This study found that inclusion of <b>dataloggers</b> into modules led to increased assessment scores, while the use of cameras indicated that students are adept at taking relevant photos, and did not suffer from an extensive novelty effect. The results highlighted the importance of using a range of methods and tools for teaching students. The thesis concludes with recommendations and future research ideas, including exploring how data is visualised and the role of physical context. Of key importance is that future work is conducted in collaboration with educators in the wild...|$|R
