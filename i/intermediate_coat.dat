50|$|Proper {{disposal}} of left over paint is a challenge. Sometimes {{it can be}} recycled: Old paint may be usable for a primer coat or an <b>intermediate</b> <b>coat,</b> and paints of similar chemistry can be mixed to make a larger amount of a uniform color.|$|E
40|$|In summary, the {{invention}} relates to a reflector for electromagnetic radiation of wavelengths with controllable degree of reflection and/or controllable transmissivity, comprising a first and a second reflection coating and an at least partially transparent non-electron-conducting <b>intermediate</b> <b>coating</b> arranged between the two reflection coatings and for the electromagnetic radiation of wavelength, the thickness of said <b>intermediate</b> <b>coating</b> being / 4 or a whole-interger multiple of / 4, whereby {{at least one of}} the two reflection coatings is at least a partially transparent coating for the electromagnetic radiation of wavelength, and the electrical resistance of the said layer determining its absorptivity and/or reflectivity for electromagnetic radiation of wavelength is electrically controllable...|$|R

5000|$|The {{school for}} many years used the armorial {{bearings}} of the founder, Edward Latymer. This included his motto, paulatim ergo certe ("Slowly therefore surely"), which doubled as a pun, including the word [...] "latimer" [...] (spelt thus due to there being no letter y in Latin). An <b>intermediate</b> <b>coat</b> of arms was taken {{from one of the}} quarters of the original coat of arms which combined that of the Latymer Foundation and of the Latymer School. The motto was dropped in 2004 along with the coat of arms, and a new, much simpler, shield (described in the school literature as a [...] "new crest") was adopted.|$|E
5000|$|Shedding {{can occur}} continuously, {{but in many}} breeds is {{strongly}} influenced by hormones. Seasonal shedders shed most in spring and fall, following an increase or decrease in day length, and least in summer and winter, in response to constant day length. Cold temperatures stimulate hair growth, so that the heaviest shedding is in spring on dogs living in cold climates. Artificial lighting can alter the seasonal shedding pattern of dogs who live indoors. Other hormonal influences include dietary factors, reproductive hormones in intact dogs, and various medical conditions and disorders. Shedding that is done {{in a short period}} of time is known as [...] "blowing the coat" [...] or [...] "blowing coat". Among the other coat types, dogs with fine silky coats (e.g., spaniels) are generally moderate shedders, those with an <b>intermediate</b> <b>coat</b> texture (e.g., mountain dogs) are generally heavy shedders, and those with thick stand-offish coats (e.g., spitzes) are generally very heavy shedders.|$|E
5000|$|As {{the name}} suggests, passive fire {{protection}} remains inactive in the coating system until a fire occurs. There are mainly two types of PFP: intumescent fire protection and vermiculite fire protection. In vermiculite fire protection, the structural steel members are covered with vermiculite materials, mostly a very thick layer. This is a cheaper option as compared to an intumescent one, but is very crude and aesthetically unpleasant. Moreover, if the environment is corrosive in nature, then the vermiculite option is not advisable, as {{there is the possibility}} of water seeping into it (because of the porous nature of vermiculite), and there it is difficult to monitor for corrosion. Intumescent fireproofing is a layer of paint which is applied along with the coating system on the structural steel members. The thickness of this intumescent coating is dependent on the steel section used. For calculation of DFT (dry film thickness) a factor called Hp/A (heated perimeter divided by cross sectional area), referred to as [...] "section factor" [...] and expressed in mâˆ’1, is used. Intumescent coatings are applied as an <b>intermediate</b> <b>coat</b> in a coating system (primer, intermediate, and top/finish coat). Because of the relatively low thickness of this intumescent coating (usually in the 350- to 700-micrometer range), nice finish, and anti-corrosive nature, intumescent coatings are preferred on the basis of aesthetics and performance.|$|E
40|$|The {{focus of}} this APP {{research}} program was to improve the bond coats used in the fabrication of flame sprayed instrumentation. Typically. a bond coat is applied to a superalloy surface prior to {{the application of a}} thin dielectric coating onto which instrumentation is placed. After affixing the instrumentation, a much thicker ceramic topcoat is typically applied to protect the instrumentation from harsh environments. The fatigue life of NiCoCrAlY coated superalloys was extended beyond current state-of-the-art by relatively simple and cost effective means. Heat treatment in reduced oxygen partial pressures at 1750 to 1800 F effectively doubled the fatigue life of NiCoCrAlY coated substrates relative to as-sprayed substrates and when used in conjunction with platinum diffusion barriers yielded a four fold increase in the fatigue life of NiCoCrAlY coated substrates. Further improvements in the fatigue life of thermally sprayed coatings were made by employing intermediate coatings, which minimized thermal expansion differences between the bond coat and top coat. Combinatorial chemistry experiments yielded an optimum composition for an <b>intermediate</b> TCE matching <b>coating</b> that showed considerable promise in extending the fatigue life of thermal spray instrumentation. The <b>intermediate</b> <b>coating</b> had two functions: to reduce the surface roughness of the peaks and valleys associated with the as-sprayed NiCoCrAlY bond coat, and to produce a thin layer of a mixture of Al 2 O 3 and NiCoCrAlY that exhibited an intermediate TCE. The optimal composition of the <b>intermediate</b> <b>coating</b> consisted of 60 wt% Al 2 O 3 and 40 wt% NiCoCrAlY, as determined by energy dispersive analysis of x-rays (EDS). Intermediate coatings having this composition were prepared by physical vapor deposition and the resulting coating systems are being evaluated in our test facility...|$|R
40|$|Diamondlike carbon (DLC) {{films were}} {{deposited}} on infrared transmitting optical windows and were evaluated as protective coatings for these windows exposed to particle and rain erosion. The DLC films were deposited on zinc selenide (ZnSe) and zinc sulfide (ZnS) by three different ion beam methods: (1) sputter deposition from a carbon target using an 8 -cm argon ion source; (2) direct deposition by a 30 -cm hollow cathode ion source with hydrocarbon gas in argon; and (3) dual beam direct deposition by the 30 -cm hollow cathode ion source and an 8 -cm argon ion source. In {{an attempt to}} improve the adherence of the DLC films on ZnSc and ZnS, ion beam cleaning, ion implantation with helium and neon ions, or sputter deposition of a thin, ion beam <b>intermediate</b> <b>coating</b> was employed prior to deposition of the DLC film. The protection that the DLC films afforded the windows from particle and rain erosion was evaluated, along with the hydrogen content, adherence, intrinsic stress, and infrared transmittance of the films. Because of the elevated stress levels in the ion beam sputtered DLC films and in those ion beam deposited with butane, films thicker than 0. 1 micron and with good adherence on ZnS and ZnSe could not be generated. An <b>intermediate</b> <b>coating</b> of germanium successfully allowed the DLC films to remain adherent to the optical windows and caused only negligible reduction in the specular transmittance of the ZnS and ZnSe at 10 microns...|$|R

40|$|Environmental barrier {{coatings}} (EBCs) with a Si bond coat, a yttria-stabilized zirconia (YSZ) top coat, and various intermediate coats were investigated. EBCs were processed by atmospheric pressure plasma spraying. The EBC durability {{was determined by}} thermal cycling tests in water vapor at 1300 C and 1400 C, and in air at 1400 C and 1500 C. EBCs with a mullite (3 Al 2 O 3 (dot) 2 SiO 2) + BSAS (1 - xBaO (dot) xSrO (dot) Al 2 O 3 (dot) 2 SiO 2) <b>intermediate</b> <b>coat</b> were more durable than EBCs with a mullite <b>intermediate</b> <b>coat,</b> while EBCs with a mullite/BSAS duplex <b>intermediate</b> <b>coat</b> resulted in inferior durability. The improvement with a mullite + BSAS <b>intermediate</b> <b>coat</b> was attributed to enhanced compliance of the <b>intermediate</b> <b>coat</b> due to {{the addition of a}} low modulus BSAS second phase. Mullite + BSAS/YSZ and BSAS/YSZ interfaces produced a low melting (less than 1400 C) reaction product, which is expected to degrade the EBC performance by increasing the thermal conductivity. EBCs with a mullite + BSAS / graded mullite + YSZ <b>intermediate</b> <b>coat</b> showed the best durability among the EBCs investigated in this study. This improvement was attributed to diffused CTE (Coefficient of Thermal Expansion) mismatch stress and improved chemical stability due to the compositionally graded mullite+YSZ layer...|$|E

30|$|There {{are many}} {{different}} combinations of primers, intermediate coats, and topcoats {{that can be applied}} to steel beam ends to protect the infrastructure components from corrosion. Most of the commonly-used steel systems employ all three aforementioned layers. Another system that exists to prevent corrosion is using hot-dipped galvanized steel, which may be coated or can be left uncoated; however, this process can be conducted in a controlled environment only (Helsel and Wissmar 2008). Frequently mentioned coatings for steel beam treatments include: polysiloxane systems which comprise of a zinc based primer and an epoxy siloxane top-coat, and inorganic zinc primer with an epoxy <b>intermediate</b> <b>coat</b> and aÂ urethane top-coating.|$|E

The study indicates that dispersion of graphite in acrylic coating though significantly brings down the electrical resistance; application of such a coating on the magnesium alloy does not offer good resistance against corrosion. In order to gain both the corrosion resistance as well as electrical conductivity an <b>intermediate</b> <b>coating</b> such as polyurethane needs to be provided.

A solution for computing the thermal spreading resistance of a planarcircular contact on a doubly coated substrate is presented. Also, a model is developed to compute the contact conductance between a bare substrate and a coated substrate. Comparisons are made with data obtained in the literature for which no analytical model was available. Solution of the governing equations and numerical computation of the spreading resistance were obtained using computer algebra systems...|$|R
40|$|AbstractThe trans-Golgi network (TGN) is {{the last}} station of the {{secretory}} pathway where soluble and membrane proteins are sorted for subsequent transport to endocytic compartments. This pathway is primarily followed by two distinct but related mannose 6 -phosphate receptors which exhibit complementary functions in soluble lysosomal enzyme targeting. These transmembrane proteins and their bound ligands are packaged in transport <b>intermediates</b> <b>coated</b> with clathrin and the AP- 1 assembly complex. Their segregation {{is determined by the}} interaction of tyrosine- and di-leucine-based sorting determinants present in their cytoplasmic domains with AP- 1. Other membrane proteins such as the lysosomal membrane glycoproteins or envelope glycoproteins of herpes viruses, which contain similar sorting signals, may also follow the same pathway. In this review, we will summarize our current understanding of the molecular mechanisms leading to membrane protein sorting in the TGN and the formation of AP- 1 -coated transport intermediates...|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT: The {{effectiveness}} of innovative polymeric coatings, polyurea and polyaspartic polyurea, to protect structural steel from corrosion was investigated through standard laboratory tests. The coating evaluation tests included salt fog test, QUV weathering test, adhesion test, and freeze-thaw stability test. These tests {{were used to}} assess the long-term performance of coating technologies compared to the conventional polyurethane type coatings, i. e. coating systems with inorganic zinc primer, epoxy <b>intermediate</b> <b>coat</b> and polyurethane topcoat. This paper presents part of results in the aforementioned evaluation tests. The results illustrate that polyaspartic coating systems are very promising for corrosion mitigation and can provide long-term adhesion strength for transportation steel structures. In addition, compared with the coating systems currently used by Department of Transportationâ€™s (DOTâ€™s), the polyaspatic coating systems performed equally well with even higher bond strength...|$|E

Non-pregnant ewes had lower P (90. 7 vs 103. 5 beats/min) and higher H (0. 76 vs 0. 65) (P 0. 05). Sheep with smooth, curly and <b>intermediate</b> <b>coat</b> types differed significantly (P 0. 05).

40|$|The {{titanium}} alloys {{are used in}} defense, aerospace, automobile, chemical plants and biomedical applications due to their very high strength and lightweight properties. However, corrosion is a life-limiting factor when Ti alloys are exposed to different chemical environments at high temperatures. In the present paper, duplex NiCrAlY/WCâ€“Co coating is coated onto Ti 6 Al 4 V substrate to investigate the corrosion behavior of both coated samples and the substrate. The duplex coating was performed with NiCrAlY as the <b>intermediate</b> <b>coat</b> of 200 Â Î¼m thickness deposited by HVOF process and WCâ€“Co ceramic top coat with varying thicknesses of 250 Â Î¼m, 350 Â Î¼m and 450 Â Î¼m deposited by DS process. Potentiodynamic polarization tests were employed to investigate the corrosion performance of duplex coated samples and substrate in Ringerâ€™s solution at 37 Â Â°C and pH value was set to 5. 7. Finally the results reveal that 350 Â Î¼m thick coated samples showed highest corrosion resistance compared to 250 Â Î¼m thick samples as well as bare substrate. However, the 450 Â Î¼m thick coated sample showed poor corrosion resistance compared to the substrate. The scale formed on the samples upon corrosion was characterized by using SEM analysis to understand the degree of corrosion behavior...|$|E

40|$|In {{the present}} work, {{tribological}} performances of duplex coatings (Ti/TiN PVD and WC-Co HVOF) on Ti 6 Al 4 V substrates were investigated by analytical modelling and experimental assessment of mechanical/tribological properties. An analytical {{study of the}} contact stress distribution under a spherical indenter was performed, considering changes in stress distribution after adoption of the WC-Co <b>intermediate</b> <b>coating</b> as a load support layer. Experimental activities consisted of micro- and nanoindentation testing, HRC adhesion test and ball-on-disc sliding wear test (Alumina counterpart) under dry atmosphere. Morphology of the worn surface and layer failure mechanisms (i. e. wear mechanisms, coating surface and sub-surface delamination, crack propagation modes, role of interfaces) were then analysed by FlB-SEM techniques. Results showed {{that the use of}} a WC-Co interlayer with intermediate hardness and stiffness provides a more effective distribution of contact strain, with a significant increase of load carrying capacity and wear resistance of samples. A correlation between results of simulations, H/E and H(3) /E(2) ratios and wear resistance of coatings is finally proposed. (C) 2008 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved...|$|R

40|$|The {{results of}} this {{research}} may be summarized as follows. 1) Various arterioles found in the 6 groups of the structures of pig ovaries were divided into 14 types. 2) In this research all of normal vesicular follicles {{in the process of}} the maturation, mature ones and ones just before the rupture showed the same finding : i. e., newly formed arterioles and normal small ones were found only in the theca externa. 3) Atretic follicles were divided into 3 types. 4) At the early stage of regressive processes the findings of arterioles found in follicle walls {{are similar to those of}} normal vesicular follicles. At the middle stage new arterioles protrude actively from the theca externa into the theca interna. And at the last stage, according to the hyalinization of the inner walls of follicles, arterioles themselves in such parts come to undergo the hyaline swelling of the <b>intermediate</b> <b>coat,</b> and finally disappear gradually. 5) Corpora lutea of non-pregnancy were divided into 6 types. 6) At the vascularization stage of corpora lutea of this group, new arterioles protrude actively from the capsule into the lutein cell layer, and at the fullyformed stage these arterioles reach as far as in the deep portions of the lutein cell layers. At the beginning stage of the regressive process, normal arterioles with the marked internal elastic membrane are found in the periphery of the lutein cell layer. Arterioles with arteriosclerotic changes appear at the middle stage of the regressive process for the first time; namely relatively large arterioles under the capsule show increase of elastic fibers in the <b>intermediate</b> <b>coat.</b> At the last stage, with hyalinization of the interstitial tissues, arterioles themselves undergo hyaline swelling of the wall, and collapse gradually. 7) Vascular bodies were divided into 3 types. 8) Arterioles found in the vascular bodies show heavy arteriosclerotic changes in comparison with those of corpora lutea of non-pregnancy : that is to say they are found with conspicuous thickening of the internal elastic membrane and hyperplastic swelling of the inner coat. Only such arterioles remain in spite of the disappearance of lutein cells and of interstitial tissues according to the hyalinization, showing characteristic appearances as vascular bodies.

40|$|The {{current state}} of art for {{corrosion}} protection of steel bridges involves a three-coat system typically consisting of a zinc-rich primer, an <b>intermediate</b> <b>coat,</b> and a top coat. Replacing a threecoat system with fewer coats without sacrificing corrosion resistance can lead to savings in production cost and improved productivity in the steel shops. Two-coat systems evaluated in a previous Federal Highway Administration study performed on par with the widely established well-performing zinc-rich three-coat systems. In this in-house one-coat study, commercially available coating materials {{that can be applied}} as one-coat systems to new steel bridges were evaluated. Eight one-coat systems and two controls, a three-coat and a two-coat system, were chosen, and their performance was evaluated using accelerated laboratory testing (ALT) and two outdoor exposure conditions, natural weathering (NW) and natural weathering with salt spray (NWS). ALT (6, 840 h) and the two outdoor exposure conditions (NW and NWS), both 18 months, were performed at the Coatings and Corrosion Laboratory at the Turner-Fairbank Highway Research Center in McLean, VA, while another outdoor exposure was performed at a marine exposure site for 24 months in Sea Isle City, NJ.

40|$|In {{response}} to UV light, single-stranded DNA <b>intermediates</b> <b>coated</b> with replication protein A (RPA) are generated, which trigger the ATR-Chk 1 checkpoint pathway. Recruitment and/or activation of several checkpoint proteins at the damaged sites {{is important for}} the subsequent cell cycle arrest. Surprisingly, upon UV irradiation, Rad 9 and RPA only minimally accumulate at DNA lesions in G 2 phase, suggesting that only a few single-stranded DNA intermediates are generated. Also, little phosphorylated Chk 1 is observed in G 2 phase after UV-irradiation, and UV light fails to elicit efficient accumulation of typical DNA damage response proteins at sites of damage in this phase. By contrast, p 38 MAPK is phosphorylated in G 2 phase cells after UV damage. Interestingly, despite the lack of an obvious activation of the ATR-Chk 1 pathway, only the combined inhibition of the ATR- and p 38 -dependent pathways results in a complete abrogation of the UV-induced G 2 /M arrest. This suggests that UV light induces less hazardous lesions in G 2 phase or that lesions created in this phase are less efficiently processed, resulting in a low activation of the ATR-Chk 1 pathway. UV-induced G 2 checkpoint activation in this situation therefore relies on signalling via the p 38 MAPK and ATR-Chk 1 signalling cascades...|$|R

40|$|A Doctoral Thesis. Submitted in partial {{fulfilment}} of {{the requirements}} for the award of Doctor of Philosophy of Loughborough University. A multifunctional structural polymer electrolyte membrane (PEM) fuel cell was designed, developed and manufactured. The structural fuel cell was designed to represent the rear rib section of an aircraft wing. Custom membrane electrode assemblies (MEA s) were manufactured in house. Each MEA had an active area of 25 cm 2. The platinum loading on each electrode (anode and cathode) was 0. 5 mg/cm 2. Sandwiched between the electrodes was a Nafion 212 electrolyte membrane. Additional components of the structural fuel included metallic bipolar plates and end plates. Initially all the components were manufactured from aluminium {{in order for the}} structural fuel cell to closely represent an aircraft wing rib. However due to corrosion problems the bipolar plate had to be manufactured from marine grade 361 L stainless steel with a protective coating system. A number of different protective coating systems were tried with wood nickel strike, followed by a 5 Âµm <b>intermediate</b> <b>coat</b> of silver and a 2 Âµm gold top coat being the most successful. Full fuel cell experimental setup was developed which included balance of plant, data acquisition and control unit, and a mechanical loading assembly. Loads were applied to the structural fuel cells tip to achieve a static deflection of Â± 7 mm and dynamic deflections of Â± 3 mm, Â± 5 mm, and Â± 7 mm. Static and dynamic torsion induced 1 Â° to 5 Â° of twist to the structural fuel cell tip. Polarisation curves were produced for each load case. Finite element analysis was used to determine the structural fuel cell displacement, and stress / strain over the range of mechanical loads. The structural fuel cells peak power performance dropped 3. 9 % from 5. 5 watts to 5. 3 watts during static bending and 2 % from 6. 2 watts to 6. 1 watts during static torsion. During dynamic bending (2000 cycles) the structural fuel cell peak power performance dropped 11 % from 6. 7 watts to 6 watts (3 mm deflection at 190 N), 23 % from 6. 3 watts to 4. 8 watts (5 mm deflection at 270 N), and 41 % from 7. 2 watts to 5 watts (7 mm deflection at 350 N). During dynamic torsion (2000 cycles) the structural fuel cell peak power performance dropped 16 % from 6 watts to 5. 1 watt (3 Â° of torsional loading), and 30 % from 6. 4 watts to 4. 3 watts (5 Â° of torsional loading). The simulated (finite element modelling) displacement of - 6. 6 mm (At maximum bending load of 364. 95 N) was within 9 % of the actual measured displacement of - 7. 2 mm at 364. 95 N. Furthermore the majority of the simulated strain values were within 10 % of the actual measured strain for the structural fuel cell...|$|E

40|$|The use of {{nanoscale}} materials {{has become}} {{common practice in}} a variety of industries such as electronics, medicine, cosmetics, construction and automobile to name a few. Whether used as dispersed nanoparticles or in the form of coatings and thin films, these nanomaterials open up a world of possibilities for new emerging technologies. Carbon nanomaterials in particular have great potential with a dynamic range of interesting properties in different dimensional structures. Under most application conditions the nanomaterials need to be protected from mechanical and/or chemical disruption by a protective matrix. In this thesis the feasibility and viability of fabricating thin composite films by embedding carbon nanomaterials in a protective matrix is explored. Tetrahedral amorphous carbon (ta-C) containing high sp 3 bonded carbon fraction has been selected as the protective matrix due to its high hardness, chemical inertness, optical transparency and ability to be deposited as a thin film. Carbon nanomaterials in the form of single wall carbon nanotubes (SWCNTs) and detonation nanodiamonds (DNDs) were tested in this thesis, due to their increasing usage in applications related to conductive films, thin film transistors, sensing elements and photonic components. SWCNT networks were coated by ta-C using a pulsed filtered cathodic arc process (p-FCVA) and tested to ascertain the electrical and mechanical properties. Experimental results supported by simulations show that ta-C coating with high sp 3 carbon fraction of 75 % could be deposited onto the SWCNT networks. The ta-C coating encapsulates the SWCNT bundles providing superior mechanical and chemical protection with 60 % reduction in wear and limited immunity to oxygen plasma in comparison to uncoated network. The increase of electrical resistance by around 4500 % for the SWCNT network post deposition of ta-C coating, has been investigated. The predominant cause of this resistance increase is attributed to the intrinsic compressive stress of the ta-C coating which moves the SWCNT bundle junctions apart, thus increasing the contact resistance leading to drastic increase in the network resistance. It has been shown that use of an <b>intermediate</b> <b>coating</b> between the SWCNT network and ta-C coating limits the resistance increase to manageable proportions. A 9 nm thick evaporated carbon <b>coating</b> as <b>intermediate</b> layer, limited the network resistance increase to 90 % and improved the mechanical wear by 50 % in comparison to ta-C <b>coated</b> network without <b>intermediate</b> <b>coating.</b> Furthermore, a novel method to deposit DND embedded ta-C composite films in a single step using p-FCVA process has been demonstrated here. The DND-ta-C composite film, with DND concentration of the order of 0. 1 vol% has 15 % increase of hardness and 40 % lower wear in comparison to ta-C film. Even under high load and multiple wear test conditions the DND-ta-C composite film has mechanical performance superior to ta-C films making them an ideal candidate for tribological applications...|$|R
40|$|Insufficient bonding of {{juxtaposed}} bone to an orthopaedic/dental implant {{could be}} caused by material surface properties that do not support new bone growth. For this reason, fabrication of biomaterials surface properties, which support osteointegration, {{should be one of}} the key objectives {{in the design of the}} next generation of orthopaedic/dental implants. Titanium and titanium alloy have been widely used in several bioimplant applications, but when implanted into the human body, these still contain some disadvantages, such as poor osteointegration (forming a fibrous capsule), wear debris and metal ion release, which often lead to clinical failure. Electrolytic hydroxyapatite/titanium dioxide (HA/TiO 2) double layers were successfully deposited on titanium substrates in TiCl 4 solution and subsequently in the mixed solution of Ca(NO 3) (2) and NH 4 H 2 PO 4, respectively. After annealing at 300 degrees C for 1 h in the air, the coated specimens were evaluated by dynamic cyclic polarization tests, immersion tests, tensile tests, surface morphology observations, XRD analyses and cells culture. The adhesion strength of the HA coating were improved by the <b>intermediate</b> <b>coating</b> of TiO 2 from 11. 3 to 46. 7 MPa. From cell culture and immersion test results, the HA/TiO 2 coated specimens promoted not only cells differentiation, but also appeared more bioactive while maintaining non-toxicity.
