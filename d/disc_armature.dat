2500|$|Bell {{exhibited}} a working telephone at the Centennial Exhibition in Philadelphia in June 1876, where it {{attracted the attention}} of Brazilian emperor Pedro II plus the physicist and engineer Sir William Thomson (who would later be ennobled as the 1st Baron Kelvin). In August 1876 {{at a meeting of the}} British Association for the Advancement of Science, Thomson revealed the telephone to the European public. In describing his visit to the Philadelphia Exhibition, Thomson said, [...] "I heard [...] passages taken at random from the New York newspapers: 'S.S. Cox Has Arrived' (I failed to make out the S.S. Cox); 'The City of New York', 'Senator Morton', 'The Senate Has Resolved To Print A Thousand Extra Copies', 'The Americans In London Have Resolved To Celebrate The Coming Fourth Of July!' All this my own ears heard spoken to me with unmistakable distinctness by the then circular <b>disc</b> <b>armature</b> of just such another little electro-magnet as this I hold in my hand." ...|$|E

Brush's design modified the Gramme dynamo by shaping the ring <b>armature</b> like a <b>disc</b> rather than a cylinder shape. The field electromagnets were also positioned {{on the sides of the}} <b>armature</b> <b>disc</b> rather than around the circumference.|$|R
40|$|The {{design and}} {{development}} of an axial-flux permanent-magnet air-cored generator {{for use as a}} direct drive generator with small-scale wind and water turbines is described. The generator is designed for simplicity and ease of manufacture and consists of two rotor discs each with permanent magnets located around its periphery. The stator is made of plastic and has a number of bobbin-wound armature coils located around its periphery. A three-phase prototype generator has been designed and built with 16 magnets per rotor <b>disc,</b> 12 <b>armature</b> coils (four per phase) and an overall diameter of 495 mm. The generator produces 1000 W at 300 rpm or 2000 W at 500 rpm with an electrical efficiency substantially greater than 90...|$|R
25|$|The printed {{armature}} (originally {{formed on}} {{a printed circuit}} board) in a printed armature motor is made from punched copper sheets that are laminated together using advanced composites to form a thin rigid <b>disc.</b> The printed <b>armature</b> has a unique construction in the brushed motor world in {{that it does not}} have a separate ring commutator. The brushes run directly on the armature surface making the whole design very compact.|$|R
40|$|This {{thesis is}} {{concerned}} primarily with the testing {{and analysis of}} design variations of the Lynch motor, which is an axial gap permanent magnet dc machine. These variants include: a standard production motor, a motor with low iron volume, a motor with bigger area of magnets and a motor using powder iron instead of laminations. The powder iron motor was constructed by the author, while all the other motors were provided by the Lynch Motor Company. Tests were conducted to evaluate motor circuit parameters, losses and efficiency using a purpose built test rig which {{was built in the}} first stage of the project. Finite element analysis (FEA) was used to determine the levels of the magnetic saturation in the different motors and calculate torque, inductance and EMF. The FEA was also used as bases for comparison with analytical electromagnetic calculations. A dynamic circuit model, whose parametric were derived from FEA and analytical calculations validated by test, was also constructed to study the effect of brush thickness on circulating current and torque production. The results of the work revealed that the larger magnet motor has a high level of saturation resulting in a higher slope of the torque-speed curve. The lower iron volume motor and the powder iron cored motor produced less torque and have less flux density than the standard Lynch motor. The test results proved that the selected powder iron material is usable in the Lynch rotated armature but it still needs improvements to close the performance gap with laminations. The powder iron motor has back emf that is 10 % lower than the standard motor, and consequently a lower efficiency. The results show that performance of the Lynch motor can be improved by optimising the size of the saturated parts of the motor, which are the stator <b>discs</b> and the <b>armature</b> teeth. In addition, careful selection of brush number, geometry and type can improve the motor performance. An alternative single gap motor was also studied. The test results show that it has more armature reaction than the dual gap motor and therefore it produced less torque with less efficiency.
