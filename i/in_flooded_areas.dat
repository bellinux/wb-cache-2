5|$|After the storm, New Jersey {{state health}} {{department}} investigators from Trenton were dispatched to study the possibility {{for an increase in}} typhoid fever <b>in</b> <b>flooded</b> <b>areas.</b> In Woodbury, where the city pumping station was flooded, water was rationed. Gas service was also limited in Woodbury, Pedricktown, Penns Grove. As a result of a gas plant becoming inundated in Glassboro, electricity was rationalized in Hammonton, forcing residents to eat uncooked food. Police were forced to transport residents of Mount Holly to work via boat due to the high floodwaters.|$|E
5|$|In {{response}} to the Taiwan flooding in Kaohsiung, officials deployed 7,888troops to the southern portion of the island to assist in rescue and recovery work. Soldiers also set up five medical centers, and utilized amphibious vehicles to rescue people <b>in</b> <b>flooded</b> <b>areas.</b> Taiwan's president Ma Ying-jeou toured the flooded regions on September23, emphasizing that efforts to drain the flooding should be the main priority. More than 100buildings in Kaohsiung required water pumps and thousands of volunteers to remove standing water from basements and streets. The mayor Kiku Chen temporarily suspended her reelection campaign due to the floods. About 80% of the factories in Kaohsiung were reopened by September21. The high crop damage allowed farmers to qualify for low interest loans. Rail lines took two weeks to reopen due to damage. Power and water service was restored {{within days of the}} storm, although residents <b>in</b> <b>flooded</b> <b>areas</b> were advised to boil water before usage. There was also an increase in dengue fever after the floods. The Red Cross Society of China donated about US$100,000 {{in the days after the}} storm. The government announced on September20 that families affected by the floods would receive NT$30,000 (US$945.92) per house. Throughout Taiwan, exports during September 2010 decreased 6.9% from August's levels due to the storm and an industrial fire.|$|E
5|$|Soon {{after the}} storm struck, CARE {{operated}} airlifts of food to flooded areas. The World Food Programme approved $2 million to help airlifting 53,000 metric tons of food. A fleet of 29 helicopters had rescued 14,204 people by March 7 as well as operating airlifting missions. This included 12 planes and helicopters from South Africa, six helicopters with crews along with 100 motorboats from the United Kingdom, ten helicopters from Germany, and two from Malawi. Many residents <b>in</b> <b>flooded</b> <b>areas</b> initially had to hold onto trees and roofs {{due to lack of}} helicopters, with 100,000 people needing rescue as of March 1. After the floodwaters receded, the need for rescue diminished, allowing families to return home, although helicopters were still required to airlift relief goods. Emergency road repairs allowed supplies to be delivered by road in some areas by March 5. The United States sent a crew of 700 soldiers in what became Task Force Atlas Response, a $37 million operation to coordinate disaster relief, rebuild roads, deliver crop seed, and drop off aid. This was ordered by U.S. President Bill Clinton on March 2 after criticism that the international assistance was insufficient. The Save the Children organization helped reunited separated children from their families, while World Relief flew seeds and tools to help 26,260 farmers regrow their damaged crops. The United Kingdom assisted by canceling the country's $150 million debt earlier than scheduled, and urged other nations to follow suit; Italy canceled its $500 million debt in March. On February 24, the World Bank provided $2.5 million to rebuild roads, and later provided an additional $15 million. The same agency delayed debt payments for one year. Portugal and Spain canceled $150 million and $20 million worth of debt, respectively. Through the Jubilee 2000, most wealthy nations postponed debt payments for one year on March 16.|$|E

25|$|The {{flood flow}} in {{urbanized}} areas constitutes a hazard {{to both the}} population and infrastructure. Some recent catastrophes include the inundations of Nîmes (France) in 1998 and Vaison-la-Romaine (France) in 1992, the flooding of New Orleans (USA) in 2005, and the flooding in Rockhampton, Bundaberg, Brisbane during the 2010–2011 summer in Queensland (Australia). Flood flows in urban environments have been studied relatively recently despite many centuries of flood events. Some recent research has considered the criteria for safe evacuation of individuals <b>in</b> <b>flooded</b> <b>areas.</b>|$|E
25|$|The {{impact of}} {{disasters}} was {{to an extent}} increased through human activity. Relatively high-lying swampland was drained {{to be used as}} farmland. The drainage caused the fertile peat to contract and ground levels to drop, upon which groundwater levels were lowered to compensate for the drop in ground level, causing the underlying peat to contract further. Additionally, until the 19th century peat was mined, dried, and used for fuel, further exacerbating the problem. Centuries of extensive and poorly controlled peat extraction lowered an already low land surface by several metres. Even <b>in</b> <b>flooded</b> <b>areas,</b> peat extraction continued through turf dredging.|$|E
25|$|Lower {{positive}} impacts {{are found}} in the tropical regions, as it has been noted that the reservoirs of power plants in tropical regions produce substantial amounts of methane. This is due to plant material <b>in</b> <b>flooded</b> <b>areas</b> decaying in an anaerobic environment, and forming methane, a greenhouse gas. According to the World Commission on Dams report, where the reservoir is large compared to the generating capacity (less than 100 watts per square metre of surface area) and no clearing of the forests in the area was undertaken prior to impoundment of the reservoir, greenhouse gas emissions from the reservoir may be higher than those of a conventional oil-fired thermal generation plant.|$|E
40|$|Flood {{spreading}} {{is one of}} the suitable {{methods to}} control the floods and conservation of soil and water in arid and semi-arid regions. Since soil properties may be influenced by the flood spreading, this study was carried out to investigate the effect of the flood spreading on physicochemical soil properties in Garacharyan plain located in North West of Zanjan <b>in</b> 2009. Three <b>flooded</b> <b>areas</b> and one control area were selected for soil sampling. Two hundred sixteen soil samples and twenty seven soil samples were taken from three <b>flooded</b> <b>areas</b> and control area, respectively. Soil infiltrability was also measured at three points both <b>in</b> the <b>flooded</b> <b>areas</b> and <b>in</b> control area. Results of the physical soil properties indicated that the soil infiltrability and available water content were significantly (p< 0. 001) affected by the <b>flood</b> spreading <b>in</b> the study plains. With a decrease in sand percentage and an increase in clay <b>in</b> the <b>flooded</b> <b>areas,</b> soil infiltrability strongly declined. The available water content negatively correlated (p< 0. 001) with clay in the areas. Soil chemical properties, including salinity, potassium, and bicarbonate, contrary to pH and total neutralizing carbonates and nitrogen, significantly (p< 0. 001) increased <b>in</b> the <b>flooded</b> <b>areas</b> as compared with control area. Increasing of the salinity <b>in</b> the <b>flood</b> plains is associated with potassium <b>in</b> the <b>flood</b> plains (p< 0. 001). There {{was no significant difference in}} organic matter and carbonate contents between the <b>flooded</b> <b>areas</b> and control area. The study revealed that controlling suspended load and solvent solids <b>in</b> the <b>floods</b> is necessary to prevent the degradation of the soil physicochemical properties (porosity, infiltration, plant water supply, and salinity and bicarbonate) and as a result improve the effectiveness of the <b>flood</b> spreading method <b>in</b> the <b>flooded</b> <b>areas...</b>|$|R

25|$|Redwoods often grow {{in areas}} prone to flooding. Deposits of {{sediment}} following floods can form impermeable barriers which suffocate tree roots, and the unstable soil <b>in</b> <b>flooded</b> <b>areas</b> often causes trees to lean to one side, increasing {{their chance to}} be toppled over by wind. Immediately after a flood, redwoods grow their existing roots upwards into recently deposited sediment layers. A second root system then develops from adventitious buds on the newly buried trunk and the old root system dies. To counter lean, redwoods will increase wood production on their vulnerable side, creating a supporting buttress. These adaptations create forests of almost exclusively redwood trees in flood-prone regions.|$|E
25|$|Flood {{flows in}} urban environments have been {{investigated}} relatively recently despite many centuries of flood events. Some researchers mentioned the storage effect in urban areas. Several studies looked into the flow patterns and redistribution in streets during storm events and the implication in terms of flood modelling. Some recent research considered the criteria for safe evacuation of individuals <b>in</b> <b>flooded</b> <b>areas.</b> But some recent field measurements during the 2010–2011 Queensland floods showed that any criterion solely based upon the flow velocity, water depth or specific momentum cannot account for the hazards caused by the velocity and water depth fluctuations.

500|$|On September17, Governor of Florida Jeb Bush {{activated}} {{emergency response}} teams. In various areas of Florida, spokesmen for the Emergency Operations Center advised residents {{to prepare for}} the storm and monitor the track of the approaching hurricane. At Cape Canaveral, National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) also took precautions against the hurricane, as the storm could force NASA to move Space Shuttle Discovery off its launch pad at the seaside and into the hangar. Many evacuations took place once Gordon crossed the Florida coast. The Emergency Operations Center in Florida said authorities had arranged mandatory evacuations for coastal regions in the Citrus, Franklin, Hernando, Levy and Taylor counties, while also recommending voluntary evacuations for numerous other counties. The Red Cross reported that the storm forced 500people to seek refuge in shelters. Also, many flights were canceled at the Tampa International Airport.

500|$|There were initial {{difficulties}} in distributing aid to areas of southwestern Madagascar due to prevailing unsettled weather, along with fuel shortages. Workers used boats to rescue people <b>in</b> <b>flooded</b> <b>areas.</b> Members of the Madagascar Armed Forces, along with about 200 Red Cross volunteers, assisted in evacuations and aid distribution, and the Red Cross also provided free medical consultations {{to thousands of}} people. Following the storm, there were increased levels of malaria, dysentery, and childhood diarrhea {{in the area around}} Toliara, and there was a locust outbreak. Increased locust activity persisted into the summer, and had been occurring since late 2012; this caused continued food shortages, and by July the locusts were affecting about half of the country's farmlands. To prevent further spreading of disease, officials provided vaccinations and sprayed insecticide. In isolated villages in southwestern Madagascar, residents faced food shortages, while in some areas, the water supply was contaminated. Within a few weeks of the storms, many residents whose dwellings were not destroyed were able to return to their homes. In Toliara, about 4,000students were initially unable to return to school due to being displaced. In the middle of March, 1,948displaced people stayed in a military camp or two schools, but most returned home by early April.

500|$|The 1st Canadian Parachute Battalion was allotted, as {{its primary}} task, the {{demolition}} of two bridges: one at Varaville and another at Robehomme. Much {{like the rest of}} the units in the division, the battalion was scattered throughout the operational area. One group of paratroopers landed [...] away from their drop-zone, and another landed only a short distance from the invasion beaches. A number were dropped <b>in</b> <b>flooded</b> <b>areas</b> around Varaville, and several drowned when they were dragged under the surface of the water due to the weight of their equipment. A group of paratroopers moved towards the Robehomme bridge, encountering and gathering together several other groups of airborne troops and sappers en route, before reaching the bridge where they discovered it was still intact. By 03:00, the sappers tasked with {{the demolition of}} the bridge had failed to arrive, and so the paratroopers gathered together the small amount of explosives they possessed and set them off, weakening the bridge. The sappers finally arrived at 06:00, and completed the demolition of the bridge whilst the paratroopers protected them. Meanwhile, another company of the battalion had been attempting to complete the tasks it had been ordered to fulfill; it was to clear the enemy garrison from Varaville and destroy a gun emplacement, demolish a bridge over the River Divette, and also destroy a radio transmitter near Varaville. However, the company was severely understrength, with only a fraction of its 100 men available. A small group, led by the company commander, assaulted the fortifications outside Varaville that were manned by approximately ninety-six Germans supported by several machine-gun nests and an artillery piece. The artillery piece inflicted a number of casualties on the small Canadian force, killing the company commander, and a stalemate ensued until 10:00 when the enemy garrison surrendered after being subjected to mortar bombardment. The paratroopers were then relieved by British Commandos from the 1st Special Service Brigade.|$|E
