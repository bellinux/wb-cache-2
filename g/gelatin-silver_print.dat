50|$|In 2005, Wolin began researching Descendants of Light: American Photographers of Jewish Ancestry. Since the 1850s, these photographers {{have contributed}} {{significantly}} to the fields of journalistic, fashion, portrait, advertising and fine art photography. By photographing and interviewing each photographer, (or interviewing the living descendants of those who are deceased) re-photographing heirloom images of their ancestors and showcasing an iconic image that is of their own creation, Wolin is able to visually and verbally document a multi-generational story of the intersection between American Jewish culture, modern America and the history and practice of photography. The book is now available and the large <b>gelatin-silver</b> <b>prints</b> are being prepared as a traveling exhibition. Penny photographed and interviewed more than 70 of the leading and most original Jewish-American photographers in history, including Lillian Bassman, Jo Ann Callis, Lauren Greenfield, Elinor Carucci, Lois Greenfield, Bruce Davidson, Annie Leibovitz, Herman Leonard, Helen Levitt, Jay Maisel, Joel Meyerowitz, Arnold Newman, Robert Frank and Joel-Peter Witkin. Posthumous interviews include the families of Philippe Halsman, Herb Ritts, Nickolas Muray, Arthur Rothstein, Roman Vishniac and Garry Winogrand. Alan Trachtenberg, Ph.D., Yale University has written the introductory essay entitled The Claim of a Jewish Eye. This documentary work was partially funded by crowd-sourced funding from Kickstarter and is now published by Crazy Woman Creek Press, Cheyenne, Wyoming © 2015.|$|R
