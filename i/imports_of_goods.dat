25|$|Real GDP grew by 3.8% in 2010 and 3.2% in 2011, {{boosted by}} rising {{worldwide}} nickel prices {{and an increase}} in domestic demand due to rising employment, as well as strong business investments. In 2011, exports of goods and services from New Caledonia amounted to 2.11billion US dollars, 75.6% of which were mineral products and alloys (mainly nickel ore and ferronickel). <b>Imports</b> <b>of</b> <b>goods</b> and services amounted to 5.22billion US dollars. 22.1% of the <b>imports</b> <b>of</b> <b>goods</b> came from Metropolitan France and its overseas departments, 16.1% from other countries in the European Union, 14.6% from Singapore (essentially fuel), 9.6% from Australia, 4.5% from the United States, 4.2% from New Zealand, 2.0% from Japan, and 27.0% from other countries.

25|$|However, {{the move}} to fixed {{exchange}} rates together with import licensing drastically curtailed exports, and the balance of payments problem became acute. The system became nearly unmanageable, and in 1953 a more flexible, multiple-exchange-rate system was introduced. Under the latter, imports considered essential were brought in at a favored rate; <b>imports</b> <b>of</b> <b>goods</b> that could be supplied domestically faced high rates and were allotted small portions of the available foreign exchange. Similarly, some exports were stimulated with a higher exchange rate than those of traditional exports. This system continued {{to be the main}} instrument for the promotion of import substitution industrialization, but the performance of the export sector improved only modestly.|$|E
25|$|Agriculture is {{the most}} {{important}} economic sector of Somalia. It accounts for about 65% of the GDP and employs 65% of the workforce. Livestock contributes about 40% to GDP and more than 50% of export earnings. Other principal exports include fish, charcoal and bananas; sugar, sorghum and corn are products for the domestic market. According to the Central Bank of Somalia, <b>imports</b> <b>of</b> <b>goods</b> total about $460 million per year, surpassing aggregate imports {{prior to the start of}} the civil war in 1991. Exports, which total about $270 million annually, have also surpassed pre-war aggregate export levels. Somalia has a trade deficit of about $190 million per year, but this is exceeded by remittances sent by Somalis in the diaspora, estimated to be about $1 billion.|$|E

25|$|The real {{exchange}} rate appreciated through 1981 and 1982, public sector investment rose 54 percent {{in real terms}} from 1979 to 1982, and public sector consumption rose 25 percent during the same three-year period. The combination effectively turned the current-account surplus into a large deficit, as increased spending plus import liberalization practically doubled <b>imports</b> <b>of</b> <b>goods</b> and services between 1979 and 1981. The appreciation also turned manufacturing exports back downward, and a plunge in external prices of primary exports brought them down too. And then the mistake of focusing on the earlier export surplus as {{the main cause of}} inflation became clear: the increases in spending led to a leap of inflation despite the return to an external deficit.

2500|$|South Carolinian George McDuffie popularized the [...] "Forty Bale theory" [...] {{to explain}} South Carolina's {{economic}} woes.

The tariffs applied to <b>imports</b> <b>of</b> <b>goods</b> such as iron, wool and finished cotton products. The Forty Bale theory was based on faulty math, as Britain could sell finished cotton goods made from Southern raw cotton around the world, {{not just to the}} United States. Still, the theory was a popular explanation for economic problems that were caused in large part by overproduction of cotton in the Deep South competing with South Carolina's declining crops because of its depleted soil. South Carolinians, rightly or wrongly, blamed the tariff for the fact that cotton prices fell from 18 cents a pound to 9 cents a pound during the 1820s.|$|E
2500|$|The global {{supply of}} labor almost doubled in {{absolute}} numbers between the 1980s and early 2000s, {{with half of}} that growth coming from Asia. At the same time, {{the rate at which}} new workers entered the workforce in the Western world began to decline. The growing pool of global labor is accessed by employers in more advanced economies through various methods, including <b>imports</b> <b>of</b> <b>goods,</b> offshoring of production, and immigration. Global labor arbitrage, the practice of accessing the lowest-cost workers {{from all parts of the}} world, is partly a result of this enormous growth in the workforce. While most of the absolute increase in this global labor supply consisted of less-educated workers (those without higher education), the relative supply of workers with higher education increased by about 50 percent during the same period. From 1980 to 2010, the global workforce grew from 1.2 to 2.9 billion people. According to a 2012 report by the McKinsey Global Institute, this was caused mostly by developing nations, where there was a [...] "farm to factory" [...] transition. Non-farming jobs grew from 54 percent in 1980 to almost 73 percent in 2010. This industrialization took an estimated 620 million people out of poverty and contributed to the economic development of China, India and others. The Institute estimates that increased exports in developing countries contribute to one-fifth of non-farm jobs in those nations and that immigrants from developing countries contributed to 40 percent of the workforce in advanced ones. By 2008 foreign-born workers accounted for 17 percent of all STEM (science, technology, engineering and math) positions in the United States.|$|E

60|$|Such was the situation(8) which prefaced {{the first}} general system {{destined to be}} based on {{supposed}} economic considerations, wrongly understood, to be sure, but vigorously carried out. I refer to the well-known mercantile system which over-spread Europe.(9) Spain, as the first receiver of American gold and silver, attributed to it abnormal power, and by heavy duties and prohibitions tried to keep the precious metals to herself. This led to a general belief in the tenets of the mercantile system, and its adoption by all Europe. 1. It was maintained that, where gold and silver abounded, there would be found no lack of the necessaries of life; 2. Therefore governments should do all in their power to secure an abundance of money. Noting that commerce and political power seemed to {{be in the hands of}} the states having the greatest quantity of money, men wished mainly to create such a relation of exports and <b>imports</b> <b>of</b> <b>goods</b> as would bring about an importation of money. The natural sequence of this was, the policy of creating a favorable âbalance of tradeâ by increasing exports and diminishing imports, thus implying that the gain in international trade was not a mutual one. The error consisted in supposing that a nation could sell without buying, and in overlooking the instrumental character of money. The errors even went so far as to create prohibitory legislation, in the hope of shutting out imported goods and keeping the precious metals at home. The system spread over Europe, so that France (1544) and England (1552) forbade the export of specie. But, with the more peaceful conditions at the end of the sixteenth century, the expansion of commerce, the value of money became steadier, and prices advanced more slowly.|$|E
