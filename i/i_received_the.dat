500|$|In April 1999, the BBC {{announced}} plans to overhaul its Six O'Clock News bulletin, and that an in-depth sports preview fronted by Rollason would {{be included in the}} programme's Friday edition. She began presenting the slot in May, and made her last onscreen appearance on 18 June. Rollason was awarded an MBE in the 1999 Birthday Honours for her services to broadcasting and charities, and in July 1999 attended a ceremony at Buckingham Palace to be presented with the honour by the Queen. Speaking about the occasion, Rollason said, [...] "I cried when <b>I</b> <b>received</b> <b>the</b> news. I don't feel I deserve it but I'm very thrilled that so many women are coming through in sport broadcasting now." [...] Also in July, she received an honorary degree from the University of Brighton, which was presented to her at her home after she became too ill to attend the ceremony. Shortly before that she was honoured with an award for courage at the 1999 Pride of Britain Awards.|$|E
500|$|As it {{had done}} in 2005, ERT asked 2004 entrant Sakis Rouvas to {{represent}} Greece in the 2006 contest, but he once again denied. In an interview with Down Town magazine Rouvas recalled getting the proposal from the network in [...] "either August or September" [...] and considering it briefly; however, he ultimately found {{there was no reason}} for him to go, especially when Greece was the reigning champion, making chances of winning little to none. Nevertheless, ERT still wanted Rouvas involved in some way and they asked him to host the competition, which he accepted. With the news leaked by the newspaper Ethnos, a public announcement was made on 1 November 2005. Rouvas said of his decision, [...] "but when <b>I</b> <b>received</b> <b>the</b> proposal for the hosting of Eurovision I found it intriguing", and that it would challenge him. American television personality and actress Maria Menounos was eventually announced as his female co-host. The two presented all of the major Eurovision events, including the allocation draw, in addition to the semi-final and final.|$|E

2500|$|I {{received}} a letter from the ITF that I failed a drugs test at the Australian Open. I take full responsibility for it. For the past ten years I have been given a medicine called mildronate by my family doctor and a few days ago after <b>I</b> <b>received</b> <b>the</b> ITF letter I found out that it also has another name of meldonium which I did not know. It is very important for you to understand that for ten years this medicine was not on WADA's banned list and I had legally been taking the medicine for the past ten years. But on January 1st [...] the rules had changed and meldonium became a prohibited substance which I had not known. I was given this medicine by my doctor for several health issues that I was having in 2006.|$|E
2500|$|Les Murray {{was born}} in Nabiac on the North Coast of New South Wales {{and grew up in}} the {{neighbouring}} district of Bunyah where he currently resides. He attended primary and early high school in Nabiac and then attended Taree High School. In 1957 he began study at the University of Sydney in the Faculty of Arts and joined the Royal Australian Navy Reserve to obtain a small income. Speaking about this time to Clive James he has said: [...] "I was as soft-headed as you could imagine. I was actually hanging on to childhood because I hadn't had much teenage. My Mum died and my father collapsed. I had to look after him. So I was off the chain at last, I was in Sydney and I didn't quite know how to do adulthood or teenage. I was being coltish and foolish and childlike. <b>I</b> <b>received</b> <b>the</b> least distinguished degree Sydney ever issued. I don't think anyone's ever matched it." [...] He developed an interest in ancient and modern languages, which qualified him to become a professional translator at the Australian National University (where he was employed from 1963 to 1967). During his studies he met other poets and writers such as Geoffrey Lehmann, Bob Ellis, Clive James and Lex Banning as well as future political journalists Laurie Oakes and Mungo McCallum Jr. Between times, he hitch-hiked around Australia and lived briefly at a Sydney Push household at Milson's Point. He returned to undergraduate studies in the 1960s and became a Roman Catholic when he married Budapest-born fellow-student Valerie Morelli in 1962. They lived in Wales and Scotland and travelled in Europe for over a year in the late 1960s. They have five children.|$|E
