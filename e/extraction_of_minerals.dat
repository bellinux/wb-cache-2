25|$|The {{process of}} mining from {{discovery}} of an ore body through <b>extraction</b> <b>of</b> <b>minerals</b> {{and finally to}} returning the land to its natural state consists of several distinct steps. The first is discovery of the ore body, which is carried out through prospecting or exploration to find and then define the extent, location and value of the ore body. This leads to a mathematical resource estimation to estimate the size and grade of the deposit.|$|E
25|$|Under 50% of the municipality’s {{population}} is economically active, but {{of these very}} few are unemployed. Commerce and services employ {{the largest number of}} people followed by construction and mining. Agriculture is extremely limited due to the very rugged terrain. However, some crops of sorghum, alfalfa, peanuts and fruits are produced. Livestock is produced on a very small scale and includes cattle, goats and sheep. Mining is the economic activity that spurred the founding of the city. However, <b>extraction</b> <b>of</b> <b>minerals</b> today is minimal, with gold and silver ores almost exhausted. Kaolin and lead are still mined. Principle mining companies includes Las Torres, Santa Fe de Guanajuato and El Cubo. The most important segments of the economy now are tourism and commerce. The city’s rich cultural and artistic heritage, along with its colonial area constructions, are what attract visitors. For the rural areas around the city, it is the place to shop for supplies not available at home. This includes foods, auto parts and service, banking services and more.|$|E

40|$|Organised {{mining and}} <b>extraction</b> <b>of</b> <b>mineral</b> {{resources}} began in 1903 in the Northern Protectorates and in 1904 in the Southern Protectorates of modern Nigeria {{with the establishment}} <b>of</b> <b>Mineral</b> Survey <b>of</b> the Northern Protectorates and the <b>Mineral</b> Survey <b>of</b> Southern Protectorates respectively, by the British colonial government. Over a century later, <b>extraction</b> <b>of</b> <b>mineral</b> resources {{in the country is}} still highly underdeveloped. There are great conflicts that surround oil extraction in the Niger Delta region, and Nigeria imports solid minerals which she is capable of producing domestically. The <b>extraction</b> <b>of</b> solid <b>minerals</b> and oil resources also calls into question issues of environmental neglect in the country. This paper provides for a descriptive analysis <b>of</b> Nigeria's <b>mineral</b> and oil resources extraction and management policy since the colonial period. It is observed that public policies in the sector have been interventionist, marginal, disjointed and elitist, and, have not properly included issues of sustainability for peace and development. Key recommendations of the paper are that public policy in the mineral and oil sector should seek to include more stringent regulations in relation to the environment, ensure equity in rent or royalty distribution especially to the host communities and develop the <b>extraction</b> <b>of</b> solid <b>minerals</b> with which the country is abundantly blessed.

50|$|The <b>extraction</b> <b>of</b> <b>minerals</b> from ore {{can be done}} two ways: placer mining, {{which uses}} water and gravity to {{concentrate}} the valuable minerals, or hard rock mining, which pulverizes the rock containing the ore and then relies on chemical reactions to concentrate the sought-after material. In the latter, the <b>extraction</b> <b>of</b> <b>minerals</b> from ore requires comminution, i.e., grinding the ore into fine particles to facilitate extraction of the target element(s). Because of this comminution, tailings consist of a slurry of fine particles, ranging from {{the size of a}} grain of sand to a few micrometres. Mine tailings are usually produced from the mill in slurry form, which is a mixture of fine mineral particles and water.|$|E
