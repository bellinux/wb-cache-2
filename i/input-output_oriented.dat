40|$|This {{paper is}} built around a theorem proved {{analytically}} and exemplified empirically in Flaschel, Franke and Veneziani (2010) which states that profitable capital-using labor-saving technical change is under mild conditions always reducing the labor content of commodities. This type of technical change therefore increases Marx’s value rate of profit in a systematic way. Against this background the paper studies {{the relationship between the}} actual value and price rate of profit and derives expressions that show that the deviation between them may be of a secondary and unsystematic nature. This result is then exemplified empirically using flow as well as stock matrix data for the German economy. The paper argues on this basis that prices of production are in fact of a questionable nature and an unnecessary detour in the <b>input-output</b> <b>oriented</b> analysis of the profitability nexus between total labor costs and the actual prices of the considered commodities. ...|$|E
40|$|Budget is {{the most}} {{important}} tool of goverment to perform its economic activities. The budget systems which form the classification tecniques of the units that take place in directing and ordering the economy and in carrying out the economy policy, have a crucial role. In this context, result oriented performance based budgeting system in public services has been accepted and practiced widely in the new world order created by globalization process in which we live. On this way, Turkey took its first steps with the Public Finance Administration and Control Law numbered 5018 that went into effect in 2006 and the practice of performance based budgeting system which is <b>input-output</b> <b>oriented</b> has begun in public institutions and organizations. In this period, the reorganization of Turkish Public Finance Administration and efficiency in public servivices have been realized. However, some problems that make the harmony difficult to the system have taken place. The method used in this study has provided an opportunity to analyze Turkish Public Finance Administration on theoretical grounds...|$|E
40|$|Cereal {{crops are}} the major {{component}} of agriculture sector in Afghanistan by generating income and providing food dietary of subsistence to the farm family. The sector which is dominated by small scale farmer across the country is facing numerous problems such as inefficient use of resources, poor production technology, low labor productivity and high production costs. This study was carried out to maximize farm income by optimization resource allocation and developing an optimal farm plan for a cooperative farm in Ahmad Abad district. A field survey was conducted to collect primary <b>input–output</b> <b>oriented</b> data from 32 cooperative farmers. Linear programming techniques was employed to optimize resources allocation, maximizing economic return restricted by certain linear constraints including land, irrigation water, production cost, human labor, tractor power and subsistence food requirement. The result suggested to allocates 179. 20, 11. 80, 9. 97 and 4. 92 hectares to wheat, maize, rice and barley, respectively. While, farmers allocate 72. 0, 57. 9, 36. 9 and 39. 1 hectares to wheat, maize, rice and barley, respectively. Following, which the gross revenue increases from 3, 275, 986 AFs in the actual plan to 4, 518, 906 AFs in the optimal plan (Indicating a 37. 9 % improvement). Results indicating that the existing plan of farmers is not efficient in term of resource allocation and economic outcome. Furthermore, the optimal plan argued the employment activities of the farm. The result reveal that hiring of labor is not required, even in the activities peak season (May, June, July and August). Eventually, the optimal plan enables 13. 5 % saving in the labor time. Furthermore, by efficient resource allocation only land is a binding constraint, capital, irrigation water and tractor do not limit the production process. Ultimately wheat came up as the most profitable crop of farm, farmers should allocate more arable land to wheat cultivation, which will enable the economic position of farm to be more sustainable and commercial...|$|E
