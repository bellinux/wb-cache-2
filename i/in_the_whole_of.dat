On {{the second day of the}} Tokyo University exam, Keitarō asks Naru about the promise and is stunned when she tells him he is mistaken. Despite their studying, and Naru's mock exam results, they both fail the exams. The pair then have an argument and independently run off to Kyoto to clear their heads. While on their trip they settle their differences and meet Mutsumi Otohime, who lives in Okinawa and is also studying for the Tokyo University exams.|$|E
5|$|Barn owls are {{relatively}} common {{throughout most of}} their range and not considered globally threatened. However, locally severe declines from organochlorine (e.g., DDT) poisoning in the mid-20th century and rodenticides in the late 20th century have affected some populations, particularly in Europe and North America. Intensification of agricultural practices often means that the rough grassland that provides the best foraging habitat is lost. While barn owls are prolific breeders and able to recover from short-term population decreases, {{they are not as}} common in some areas as they used to be. A 1995–1997 survey put their British population at between 3,000 and 5,000 breeding pairs, out of an average of about 150,000 pairs <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>whole</b> <b>of</b> Europe. In the USA, barn owls are listed as endangered species in seven Midwestern states, and in the European Community they are considered a Species of European Concern.|$|E
5|$|Furthermore, a {{significant}} number of Serbs were killed by the Ustaše on the territory of the NDH during the war. According to Midlarsky, the number of Serbs killed by the regime was at least half a million, but the figure is contradicted by Bogoljub Kočović and Vladimir Žerjavić. Kočović estimated total number of Serbs killed throughout Yugoslav territory in various circumstances at 487,000, while Žerjavić put the figure at 530,000. Žerjavić indicated that 320,000 Serbs were killed in the NDH, including 82,000 killed among the Yugoslav Partisans, 23,000 killed as Axis collaborators, 25,000 victims of typhoid epidemic, 45,000 killed by Germans and 15,000 by Italians. Kočović's and Žerjavić's total Yugoslav losses are in agreement with estimates made by Mayers and Campbell of the United States Census Bureau. The number of Croats killed in the NDH is estimated to be approximately 200,000, either by the Croatian fascist regime, as members of the armed resistance, or as Axis collaborators. Several thousand of these were killed by the Chetniks; most Croatian historians place the number of Croats killed by the Chetniks on the territory of modern-day Croatia at between 3,000 and 3,500. Croatian estimates for the number of Croats killed by Chetniks <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>whole</b> <b>of</b> Yugoslavia range from 18,000 to 32,000 (both combatants and civilians).|$|E

5|$|Interest in copernicium's {{chemistry}} was {{sparked by}} predictions {{that it would}} have the largest relativistic effects <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>whole</b> <b>of</b> period7 and group12, and indeed among all 118 known elements. Copernicium has the ground state electron configuration 5f146d107s2 and thus should belong to group12 of the periodic table, according to the Aufbau principle. As such, it should behave as the heavier homologue of mercury and form strong binary compounds with noble metals like gold. Experiments probing the reactivity of copernicium have focused on the adsorption of atoms of element112 onto a gold surface held at varying temperatures, in order to calculate an adsorption enthalpy. Owing to relativistic stabilization of the 7s electrons, copernicium shows radon-like properties. Experiments were performed with the simultaneous formation of mercury and radon radioisotopes, allowing a comparison of adsorption characteristics.|$|E

The second instalment, aired on 13 January, saw an increase of almost a million viewers to 5.1 million, a 20.8% share of the audience and beating ITV's The Bletchley Circle and an edition of Panorama on BBC One and its own former show Celebrity Big Brother (now on Channel 5) which aired {{in the same time}} slot. The third episode drew 5.2 million viewers giving it a 21.2% share of the audience, making it the most popular programme in the 9:00 pm time slot for the second week in a row, and giving Channel 4 their highest ratings since their coverage of the closing ceremony of the 2012 Summer Paralympics in September 2012. The fourth episode attracted fewer viewers, however, with an average of 4.1 million, and was behind the first part of Jeremy Paxman's World War I documentary series Britain's Great War, which aired on BBC One and had an average viewership of 4.23 million. The final episode drew 4.5 million viewers, an 18.6% audience share, but was beaten by ITV's DCI Banks which was watched by an average 6 million viewers.|$|E
5|$|Structure C8 is a {{residential}} compound that was accessed from the alley {{running to the}} East Plaza from behind Pyramid C1. The entrance opened onto the alley from a patio situated in the southern portion of the compound. This patio was surrounded on the east, west and north sides by rooms, with the alley to the south. It was floored with stucco and Structure C8 was the only stuccoed residential building <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>whole</b> <b>of</b> the city. The north range of rooms backed directly onto the ravine immediately {{to the north of}} Group C; the lower portion of the walls of the west room and of half of the north room still stand. The west room was square while the north room was narrow and probably extended the entire width of the patio. Wear marks in the stucco floor indicate that a door once accessed the north room from the west. The workmanship of Structure C8 was of very high quality and indicates that it was the residence of a member of the city's elite. Its proximity to the large pyramid-temple C1 has led archaeologist Henri Lehmann to speculate that it was once the house of the high priest.|$|E
