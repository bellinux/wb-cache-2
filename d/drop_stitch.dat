40|$|This study {{investigates the}} {{mechanical}} properties of <b>drop</b> <b>stitch</b> inflatable structures with specific reference to inflatable stand up paddleboards. A sample of <b>drop</b> <b>stitch</b> material was fabricated and simple beam bending tests were performed at different pressures. This data was {{then used to}} invalidate a developed model for the deflection of the sample. High standard deviations indicate that the pressure inside the tested sample was changing throughout {{the duration of the}} tests. An elastic modulus for the material was determined using the internal pressure. The results showed an elastic modulus on the order of 60 MPa. The fabrication process and results led to the conclusion that one of the main advantages of <b>drop</b> <b>stitch</b> technology is its ability to create unique shapes that are unable to be constructed with an inflatable alone. The results also showed that the beam becomes stiffer with an increase in internal pressure and that simple beam theory is invalid for characterizing <b>drop</b> <b>stitch</b> inflatable structures. by Lia DiGiovanna.

25|$|One of {{the more}} obvious {{differences}} is that crochet uses one hook while much knitting uses two needles. In most crochet, the artisan usually has only one live stitch on the hook (with the exception being Tunisian crochet), while a knitter keeps an entire row of <b>stitches</b> active simultaneously. <b>Dropped</b> <b>stitches,</b> which can unravel a fabric, rarely interfere with crochet work, due to a second structural difference between knitting and crochet. In knitting, each stitch {{is supported by the}} corresponding stitch in the row above and it supports the corresponding stitch in the row below, whereas crochet stitches are only supported by and support the stitches on either side of it. If a stitch in a finished crocheted item breaks, the stitches above and below remain intact, and because of the complex looping of each stitch, the stitches on either side are unlikely to come loose unless heavily stressed.|$|R

40|$|Image {{inspection}} by wavelet packets and a {{neural network}} classifier is presented for non-defect and six kinds of defects in knitted fabrics. The {{types of defect}} include a hole, set mark (coarse), <b>dropped</b> <b>stitch,</b> oil stain, streak, and tight end. In this study, wavelet packet decomposition of a sample image is carried out based on the best-basis wavelet packet tree with three resolution levels. The lowest-two entropy among all sub-band images and the standard deviation for the original image are selected as feature inputs of the neural network classifier. These textural features are shown in seven groups, which are separately distributed in the feature space. We gathered a total of 112 experimental samples, with 16 samples {{in each of the}} seven aforementioned categories. The results demonstrate that with the three features, 56 test samples are correctly inspected. However, the lack of one of the three features yields wrong classification of some samples. Therefore, the three features selected are definitely suitable for recognition of our knitted fabric defects and also are the smallest number of features required to give accurate inspection.

40|$|I’ve been {{knitting}} {{for most}} of my life and I really like particular images of women knitting whilst walking – they’re carrying milk, balancing barrels on their heads, carrying babies, wearing clogs and walking barefoot, knitting in between gutting fish…and they’re knitting complex patterns with multiple needles and colours. I just wanted to try knitting and walking. I change the colour for every walk, and the knitting is informed by the weather, conversation and terrain. Too cold, dark or boggy, I <b>drop</b> <b>stitches.</b> Sometimes I’m talking so much, and gesturing with my hands instead of knitting and little gets done. If the terrain is smooth and easy, the weather warm, and I’m listening more than talking, the stitches are good and the walk produces a large section. The knitting is a map of walks, each one defined through colour, amount and quality of stitches. I document the journey using two cameras – one strapped to my head filming the view, the other filming my hands. It’s a kind of performance – I’m not entirely sure where its going yet, or how it will be presented – I like the idea that although I am producing an object, that it’s the walks themselves that are the main event. </p...|$|R

5000|$|There {{are four}} basic types of {{knitting}} needles (also called [...] "knitting pins"). The {{first and most}} common type consists of two slender, straight sticks tapered to a point at one end, and with a knob {{at the other end}} to prevent stitches from slipping off. Such needles are usually 10-16 inches long but, due to the compressibility of knitted fabrics, may be used to knit pieces significantly wider. The most important property of needles is their diameter, which ranges from below 2 mm to 25 mm (roughly 1 inch). The diameter affects the size of stitches, which affects the gauge of the knitting and the elasticity of the fabric. Thus, a simple way to change gauge is to use different needles, which is the basis of uneven knitting. Although knitting needle diameter is often measured in millimeters, there are several different size systems, particularly those specific to the United States, the United Kingdom and Japan; a conversion table is given in the knitting needle article. Such knitting needles may be made out of any materials, but the most common materials are metals, wood, bamboo, and plastic. Different materials have different frictions and grip the yarn differently; slick needles such as metallic needles are useful for swift knitting, whereas rougher needles such as bamboo are less prone to <b>dropping</b> <b>stitches.</b> The knitting of new stitches occurs only at the tapered ends, and needles with lighted tips have been sold to allow knitters to knit in the dark.|$|R
