In April 2012 the Planning Inspectorate gave consent for the <b>erection</b> <b>of</b> <b>fencing</b> round the site to allow re-excavation of the site while {{protecting}} it against badger damage and protecting the public against accidentally falling into the deep pit. The size was given as 360 square metres (0.036 hectares). The excavation and erection of the fence were carried out shortly afterwards. However, the Natural England (NE) citation gives the area as 0.3 hectares and the NE map shows a larger area of 1.2 hectares.|$|E

The new boundary, however, did not seem to deter some hardy fence-jumpers, and a story in the Western Morning News on 12 June 1937 reported four elderly spectators sited at the Home Park End of the ground disappearing into Central Park as the collection tin came around, and then re-appearing when it had gone.|$|E

5000|$|The song's {{lyrics are}} filled with images of urban decay and civil unrest and focus on {{recurring}} Clash themes of alienation, monotony and oppression. According to their author, Joe Strummer, the lyrics were sparked by his disgust at the <b>erection</b> <b>of</b> <b>fences</b> in Britain's football terraces, built to keep fans apart in response to football hooliganism. Ten years later the Hillsborough Disaster would prove these fences fatal and his concerns irrefutably correct. The 'King of Early Evening ITV' mentioned in the song is confirmed as Bill Grundy, whose career was ruined after his infamous interview with the Sex Pistols and was indeed presenting early evening television on British terrestrial channel ITV.

50|$|The first {{moves to}} {{establish}} a public cemetery at Box Hill, east of Melbourne, were made in 1872 when an area of twelve acres was set aside and eight trustees were appointed at a public meeting. A grant of £35 was received from the Government of the day for the <b>erection</b> <b>of</b> a <b>fence</b> around the site.

5000|$|By the 1970s {{the lower}} cost of travel meant {{it was easier}} for fans to have away days, or road trips and a common {{practice}} among young visiting fans was to try to [...] "take the terrace". Large bodies of supporters of the visiting team would infiltrate the popular terracing of the home supporters with the result that violence often erupted. This led to crowd segregation at football grounds and also played a small part in the <b>erection</b> <b>of</b> high <b>fencing</b> and segregated pens within most terraces in England.|$|R
5|$|The blue {{wildebeest}} is preyed on by lions, leopards, African {{wild dogs}} and hyenas and predation {{is the main}} cause of death. They are also prone to outbreaks of disease which may also lead to a decline in numbers. Major human-related factors affecting populations include large-scale deforestation, the drying up of water sources, the expansion of settlements and poaching. Diseases of domestic cattle such as sleeping sickness can be transmitted to the animals and take their toll. The <b>erection</b> <b>of</b> <b>fences</b> that interrupt traditional migratory routes between wet and dry-season ranges have resulted in mass death events when the animals become cut off from water sources and the areas of better grazing they are seeking during droughts. A study of the factors influencing wildebeest populations in the Maasai Mara ecosystem revealed that the populations had undergone a drastic decline of around 80% from about 119,000 individuals in 1977 to around 22,000 twenty years later. The major cause of this was thought to be the expansion of agriculture, which led to the loss of wet season grazing and the traditional calving and breeding ranges. Similarly, drastic declines have recently occurred in the Tarangire wildebeest migration.|$|R

50|$|Following the {{establishment}} of the Pembrokeshire Coast National Park in 1952, Welsh naturalist and author Ronald Lockley surveyed a route around the coast. Although there were villages and settlements on the coast, communication between these was largely by boats, and access in the region was generally poor. Lockley's report for the Countryside Commission in 1953 was welcomed and broadly adopted. Some sections of the walk were existing rights-of-way, but the majority were in private hands, necessitating negotiation. Most landowners were in favour, and many benefitted from the <b>erection</b> <b>of</b> new <b>fencing.</b> Even today, however, the path in places detours from the obvious line where landowners were unwilling to accept a new right-of-way across their land.|$|R
50|$|Most {{people have}} {{a strong sense of}} privacy in {{relation}} to the exposure of their body to others. This is an aspect of personal modesty. A person will go to extreme lengths to protect this personal modesty, the main way being the wearing of clothes. Other ways include <b>erection</b> <b>of</b> walls, <b>fences,</b> screens, use <b>of</b> cathedral glass, partitions, by maintaining a distance, beside other ways. People who go to those lengths expect that their privacy will be respected by others. At the same time, people are prepared to expose themselves in acts of physical intimacy, but these are confined to exposure in circumstances and of persons of their choosing. Even a discussion of those circumstances is regarded as intrusive and typically unwelcome.|$|R

40|$|Plant {{translocation}} {{has become}} a widely used tool to improve the conservation status of threatened plants. Dianthus morisianus (Caryophyllaceae) is a narrow endemic plant which only grows on the Portixeddu coastal dune (South-West Sardinia). Its natural habitat has been strongly modified, and it is currently {{considered one of the}} most threatened plants of Sardinia. In a conservation effort, a translocation of reproductive plants was planned. Plants were obtained from seeds collected in the natural population and cultivated at the Botanic Gardens of Cagliari University. The following two suitable areas near the natural population were identified: the first is located in a fenced site which is managed by public administration, and the second is located in an unprotected site. In November 2010, 113 plants were reintroduced in site one, and in February 2011, 25 plants were reintroduced in site two; all plants were regularly monitored. The aim was to analyse the effect of different management activities (i. e. the herbivore and human exclusion) on transplanted plants. The following consistent differences between sites with different management types were found: the survival and growth of D. morisianus were enhanced by reducing herbivory and human disturbance; in particular, fences positively enhanced the plant’s long-term survival, reproductive success and seedling recruitment. This study highlights that management activities (i. e. <b>erection</b> <b>of</b> <b>fences)</b> should be incorporated into translocation design since they contribute to translocation success. Our experience can serve as a model for further translocations of the threatened plants of Sardinia and, more widely, of the Mediterranean islands...|$|R

30|$|Expert {{interviews}} {{and focus groups}} revealed that the exclusion from livestock markets has resulted in part-time and town-dwelling livestock owners.

Some respondents argue that {{this is also a}} major contributing factor in the spread of livestock diseases since these stray animals are never vaccinated. Citing the destruction of their cattle-led lifestyle, and land use policies which pastoralists argued favours mainly two types of land use (wildlife and commercial ranching), some Ovaherero pastoralists expressed their desire to abandon Ngamiland and repatriate to their native Namibia: ‘….I haven’t been able to sell since 2007, the land has seriously diminished since the <b>erection</b> <b>of</b> that <b>fence</b> (the ranches protection buffer fence)…BMC buys only from the ranches, we poor pastoralists are in the dark.
