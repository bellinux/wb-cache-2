50|$|On 7 July 1944 Hachijo was {{severely}} damaged {{in an air}} attack, taking damage to her <b>hull</b> and an <b>auxiliary</b> engine room was flooded. Hachijo survived the war and was scrapped on 30 April 1948.|$|R
40|$|Abstract: In {{this paper}} a linear {{dynamical}} system controlled under {{the conditions of}} disturbances and with control delays is considered. The Euclidean norm {{of a set of}} the system motion deviations at given instants of time from the origin is minimized. A typical case of the location of the indicated instants of time is studied. Within the game-theoretical approach the problem of calculating the value of the optimal guaranteed result and constructing a positional (closed-loop) control law that ensures this result is posed. For this problem, an effective solution procedure based on the recurrent construction of upper convex <b>hulls</b> of <b>auxiliary</b> program functions is elaborated. Results of numerical simulations are given...|$|R
50|$|About {{a minute}} after Hammann sank {{there was an}} {{underwater}} explosion, possibly caused by the destroyer's depth charges going off. The concussion killed many of Hammanns {{and a few of}} Yorktowns men who had been thrown into the water, battered the damaged carrier's <b>hull,</b> dislodged Yorktowns <b>auxiliary</b> generator and numerous fixtures from the hangar deck, sheared rivets in the starboard leg of the foremast, and injured several onboard crew members.|$|R
50|$|Harvey {{had been}} picked up three days earlier in the dinghy along with Renee's dead body. He told United States Coast Guard {{investigators}} that a squall had brought down the Bluebelles masts, holing the ship's <b>hull,</b> rupturing the <b>auxiliary</b> gas tank, and starting a fire. He claimed he had found Renee floating {{in the water and}} tried unsuccessfully to revive her. (An autopsy showed that she had died of drowning.) However, after Harvey was informed of Terry Jo's rescue, he checked into a motel under an assumed name and committed suicide with a razor blade.|$|R
25|$|A {{prototype}} Ram {{was completed}} in June 1941 and general production of the Ram I began in November of the same year. The Ram I and early Ram IIs were fitted with side doors in the <b>hull</b> and an <b>auxiliary</b> machine gun turret in the front. The former weakened the hull and complicated production, and the doors and the machine gun turret were discarded in later modifications. By February 1942 production had switched to the Ram II model with a 6-pounder gun and continued until July 1943. In March 1942 a decision {{had been made to}} change production over to the automotively-similar M4A1 Sherman tank for all British and Canadian units. Ram production continued due to delay in starting the new M4 production lines and a reluctance to let the plant lie idle. By July 1943 1,948 vehicles plus 84 artillery observation post (OP) vehicles had been completed.|$|R
5000|$|Some icebreakers have a hull that is wider {{in the bow}} than in the stern. These {{so-called}} [...] "reamers" [...] {{increase the}} width of the ice channel and thus reduce frictional resistance in the aftship as well as improve the ship's maneuverability in ice. In addition to low friction paint, some icebreakers utilize an explosion-welded abrasion-resistant stainless steel ice belt that further reduces friction and protects the ship's <b>hull</b> from corrosion. <b>Auxiliary</b> systems such as powerful water deluges and air bubbling systems are used to reduce friction by forming a lubricating layer between the hull and the ice. Pumping water between tanks {{on both sides of the}} vessel results in continuous rolling that reduces friction and makes progress through the ice easier. Experimental bow designs such as the flat Thyssen-Waas bow and a cylindrical bow have been tried over the years to further reduce the ice resistance and create an ice-free channel.|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{discusses}} fast novel view synthesis {{from multiple}} images taken from different viewpoints. We propose several new algorithms that {{take advantage of}} modern graphics hardware to create novel views. Although different approaches are explored, one geometry representation, the visual hull, is employed throughout our work. First the visual <b>hull</b> plays an <b>auxiliary</b> role and assists in reconstruction of depth maps that are utilized for novel view synthesis. Then we treat the visual hull as the principal geometry representation of scene objects. A hardwareaccelerated approach is presented to reconstruct and render visual hulls directly from a set of silhouette images. The reconstruction {{is embedded in the}} rendering process and accomplished with an alpha map trimming technique. We go on by combining this technique with hardware-accelerated CSG reconstruction to improve the rendering quality of visual hulls. Finally, photometric information is exploited to overcome an inherent limitation of the visual hull. All algorithms are implemented on a distributed system. Novel views are generated at interactive or real-time frame rates. i...|$|R
40|$|The Continuous Maintenance Program is {{designed}} to maintain ships {{at the highest level}} of material condition while keeping the ships at the optimum operational readiness. In this thesis the deferred maintenance records of seven DDG's were examined during the period FY 1999 to 2000 to determine if trends existed in the types of work being deferred. First, the deferred data were grouped into categories using the System Work List Item Number from data collected in the Maintenance Support Tool. Second, compilations of the grouped data (estimated total mandays and total costs) were divided into FYs 99 and 00. Third, trends were established and then compared to FY 99 and 00 to determine consistencies. The results showed that over 60 % of deferred jobs and estimated total mandays occurred in the categories of <b>hull</b> structure (decks), <b>auxiliary</b> equipment (air conditioning) and outfit/furnishing (habitability). Nearly 50 % of the estimated total costs, however, occurred within the hull structure and ship support services (shipyard services) categories. Trends were also established to determine the Port Engineer's accuracy in job estimates. In FY 00, estimated deferred data were compared to FY 00 actual deferred data. The results concluded that the Port Engineers overestimated total mandays by 9 % and total costs by 10 %. A determination of the effectiveness of the Continuous Maintenance Program could not be reached due to the classification required to make the analysis...|$|R
50|$|In December 1942, {{an accord}} between the U.S. American and French {{authorities}} foresaw, the {{one by one}} transfer of the 1500-ton submarines to the United States in order to modernize them, taking into consideration that their conception built has been then, almost twenty years old. The motors were integrally revised, the batteries changed, the thick <b>hull</b> and diving <b>auxiliaries</b> reinforced. Certain ballasts were also transformed to increase {{the autonomy of the}} boats. Grand efforts were made on soundproofing the submarines. The submarines were equipped with radar, underwater sound systems, more performing asdic, bathythermograph and featured other accessories. The living conditions were ameliorated with the installation of air conditioning and a refrigerator. The conning tower was modified, with a suppression of various navigational parts, replaced by a anti-aerial rail type. The last telescopic mats were definitely retired. L'Archimède (L'Archimède) left Dakar on February 8, 1943 and headed to Philadelphia, where the boat remained almost a year. Works began in the month of May at the Philadelphia Naval Shipyard. They were complicated by the absence of the boat's blue prints and piece assemblies schematics. In addition, out of the four 1500-ton submarines, each pair was equipped with different motor - an issue which irritated the American engineers. However, they were impressed by the modern fabrication of these boats whose concepts design were near twenty years old. The alterations and amendments of L'Archimède were completed on February 19, 1944, the boat was replaced in the American shipyard by the Le Glorieux until July, then Le Centaure from June 2 to December 18 and at last Le Casabianca from August 2, 1944 to March 30, 1945. The last two alterations and amendments were less pushed than the first. L'Argo (L'Argo), judged too tired for a complete alteration, was transferred to the American submarine schools for underwater sounds and passed over to another U.S.State.|$|R
