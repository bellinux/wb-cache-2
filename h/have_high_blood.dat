It would take almost a decade of epidemiological studies to conclusively establish {{an increased risk of}} venous thrombosis in oral contraceptive users and an increased risk of stroke and myocardial infarction in oral contraceptive users who smoke or <b>have</b> <b>high</b> <b>blood</b> pressure or other cardiovascular or cerebrovascular risk factors. These risks of oral contraceptives were dramatized in the 1969 book The Doctors' Case Against the Pill by feminist journalist Barbara Seaman who helped arrange the 1970 Nelson Pill Hearings called by Senator Gaylord Nelson. The hearings were conducted by senators who were all men and the witnesses {{in the first round of}} hearings were all men, leading Alice Wolfson and other feminists to protest the hearings and generate media attention. Their work led to mandating the inclusion of patient package inserts with oral contraceptives to explain their possible side effects and risks to help facilitate informed consent. Today's standard dose oral contraceptives contain an estrogen dose that is one third lower than the first marketed oral contraceptive and contain lower doses of different, more potent progestins in a variety of formulations.|$|E

40|$|BACKGROUND: The {{relationship}} between menopausal hormone therapy (MHT) and cardiovascular risk remains controversial, {{with a number}} of studies advocating the use of MHT in reducing risk of cardiovascular diseases, while others have shown it to increase risk. The aim {{of this study was to}} determine the association between menopausal hormone therapy and <b>high</b> <b>blood</b> pressure. METHODS AND FINDINGS: A total of 43, 405 postmenopausal women were included in the study. Baseline data for these women were sourced from the 45 and Up Study, Australia, a large scale study of healthy ageing. These women reported being postmenopausal, having an intact uterus, and had not been diagnosed with <b>high</b> <b>blood</b> pressure prior to menopause. Odds ratios for the association between MHT use and <b>having</b> <b>high</b> <b>blood</b> pressure were estimated using logistic regression, stratified by age (< 56 years, 56 - 61 years, 62 - 70 years and over 71 years) and adjusted for demographic and lifestyle factors. MHT use was associated with <b>higher</b> odds of <b>having</b> <b>high</b> <b>blood</b> pressure: past menopausal hormone therapy use: < 56 years (adjusted odds ratio 1. 59, 99 % confidence interval 1. 15 to 2. 20); 56 - 61 years (1. 58, 1. 31 to 1. 90); 62 - 70 years (1. 26, 1. 10 to 1. 44). Increased duration of hormone use was associated with <b>higher</b> odds of <b>having</b> <b>high</b> <b>blood</b> pressure, with the effect of hormone therapy use diminishing with increasing age. CONCLUSIONS: Menopausal hormone therapy use is associated with significantly <b>higher</b> odds of <b>having</b> <b>high</b> <b>blood</b> pressure, and the odds increase with increased duration of use. <b>High</b> <b>blood</b> pressure should be conveyed as a health risk for people considering MHT use...|$|R

40|$|Elevated blood {{pressure}} {{as a major}} indicator of higher health risks varies considerably around the globe. We examine whether the livability of the environment can account for part of this variation.

Male and female populations from 120 countries indeed <b>have</b> <b>higher</b> <b>blood</b> pressures to the extent they have to cope with too few or too many rather than just enough environmental resources. In poorer countries, predominantly located in hotter climes, both genders <b>have</b> <b>higher</b> <b>blood</b> pressures in too difficult-and-expensive environments with more demanding summers or winters (too few resources), than in just-right environments with more temperate summers and winters (optimal resources). In richer countries, predominantly located in colder climes, both genders <b>have</b> <b>higher</b> <b>blood</b> pressures in too easy-and-cheap environments with more temperate winters and summers (too many resources), than in just-right environments with more demanding winters or summers (optimal resources).
