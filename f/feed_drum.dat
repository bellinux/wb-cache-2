5000|$|A declassified US {{analysis}} of the feed system, based on models captured during the Korean War, reads: An interesting departure was made from the heretofore orthodox practice of feeding ammunition to a gun of this caliber. The feed, somewhat resembling a grooved revolver cylinder, {{is an integral part}} of the gun, and the cartridges remain axial throughout the entire operation.The cylindrical feed cage is rotated by an arm that engages a slot in the gas piston. A helical groove in the drum arrangement withdraws the cartridges from the metal disintegrating link belt as it moves through the feedway by engaging their rims and gradually camming the cartridges rearward. The freed cartridges are then presented at the bottom of the receiver for chambering by final rotation.This circular type of feed holds ten rounds. Several phases are required to completely delink a round and roll it up into position for being shoved into the chamber. A small folding handle held on the top side is used to rotate the <b>feed</b> <b>drum</b> when filling with cartridges.Camming the round slowly out of the belt with this type of feeder causes practically no drag when the weapon is fired at high speed. It has belt pull enough to take care of practically any length belt desired. ...The Russian Air Force nicknamed this circular arrangement the [...] "bird-cage" [...] feed. It is an adaptation of a system first used by the Polish designer, Gabriel Szakats. (Ian V. Hogg called the ShKAS feeding system a [...] "squirrel cage".) ...|$|E

Separation skin from the melon flesh with their subsequent destination application {{in the creation of}} new food products is one of the time-consuming operations in this technology. Lack of scientific and experimental base of this operation holding back the development of high-performance machines for its implementation. In this connection, the technique of the experiment on the separation of the skins of melons in the pilot plant and the search for optimal regimes of its work methods by statistical modeling is offered. The late-ripening species of melon: Kalaysan, Thorlami, Gulab-sary are objects of study. Interaction of factors influencing on separating the melon skins process is carried out. A central composite rotatable design and fractional factorial experiment was used. Using the method of experimental design with treatment planning template in Design Expert v. 10 software yielded a regression equations that adequately describe the actual process. Rational intervals input factors values are established: the ratio of the rotational speed of the drum to the abrasive supply roll rotational frequency; the gap between the supply drum and the shearing knife; shearing blade sharpening angle; the number of <b>feed</b> <b>drum</b> spikes; abrading drum orifices diameter. The mean square error does not exceed 12. 4 %. Regression equations graphic interpretation is presented by scatter plots and engineering nomograms that can be predictive of a choice of rational values of the input factors for three optimization criteria: minimal specific energy consumption in the process of cutting values, maximal specific performance by the pulp and pulp extraction ratio values. Obtained data can be used for the operational management of the process technological parameters, taking into account the geometrical dimensions of the melon and its inhomogeneous structure...|$|E

50|$|The most {{distinguishing}} {{mark on the}} red drum is one large black spot on {{the upper part of}} the tail base. Having multiple spots is not uncommon for this fish, but having no spots is extremely rare. As the fish with multiple spots grow older, they seem to lose their excess spots.

The red drum uses its senses of sight and touch, and its downturned mouth, to locate forage on the bottom through vacuuming or biting. On the top and middle of the water column, it uses changes in the light that might look like food.

Washing stage performance can be evaluated by the dilution factor, which determines the water amount used for pulp ton, and washing loss, which determines the amount of washable components in pulp discharged with pulp to bleaching that could not be washed away. This study focused on utilization of brown stock washing stage upper level control, which was based on the real time online measurement of total dry solids of the pulp suspension and washer filtrates in several points of the process. Online measurements were used to determine the chemical state of the process and adjustments to dilution factor made accordingly. Trial runs including <b>feed</b> consistency, washer <b>drum</b> torque, washing water temperature and dilution factor were made to examine the effect of different variables to washing result.

40|$|High feed {{costs and}} {{increasing}} demand for fishmeal have intensified {{the search for}} alternative protein sources which are needed to allow world aquaculture to continue expanding. A severely underused marine resource is processing wastes of various types of seafood, which are often disposed of at great cost. Therefore, {{this study was conducted}} to evaluate three different types of seafood processing wastes as potential feed ingredients for the red drum (Sciaenops ocellatus). The three processing wastes evaluated were heads and shells from Penaeid shrimp, and viscera and skeletal remains from filleted black drum (Pogonias cromis) and channel catfish (Ictaluras punctatus). These wastes were blended with soybean meal in a 40 : 60 ratio, dry extruded and dried to produce stable ingredients. All three byproduct meals produced had crude protein levels ranging from 45 to 50 percent. Two feeding trials were conducted to evaluate the different processing waste byproduct meals in comparison to menhaden fishmeal. A digestibility trial was conducted with sub-adult red drum which led to the computation of apparent digestibility coefficients (ADCs) for organic matter, protein, lipid and energy for each of the byproduct meals. Each byproduct meal had relatively high ADC values that were generally similar to those of menhaden fishmeal. A comparative growth trial with red drum was then conducted in which experimental diets were formulated with the three byproduct meals replacing menhaden fishmeal on an equal-digestible-protein basis at levels of 65 percent, 80 percent, or 95 percent. Juvenile red drum were fed the various diets for 8 weeks in a brackish (6 plus/minus 1 ppt) water recirculating system after which weight gain, survival, feed efficiency, as well as whole-body proximate composition and condition indices were measured. All three of the byproduct meals could replace up to 65 percent of the protein provided by fishmeal without adversely affecting performance of red drum. However, the shrimp byproduct consistently provided the highest performance values at 80 percent replacement. The catfish byproduct yielded the lowest fish performance at all levels.

40|$|Diets of many cultured fishes require high {{inclusion}} of fishmeal and fish oil. With {{the growth of}} aquaculture worldwide, demand for fishmeal and fish oil has increased resulting in higher prices of these ingredients due to increased demand but relatively static supplies. A promising source of alternative protein and lipid is the waste from seafood processing. This project evaluated four different types of seafood processing wastes as potential feed ingredients for the red drum (Sciaenops ocellatus) and hybrid striped bass (Morone saxatilis x M. chysops). Viscera and skeletal remains from filleted channel catfish (Ictalurus punctatus), black drum (Pogonias cromis), yellowfin tuna (Thunnus albacares) and krill (Euphausia superba) were evaluated with red drum and hybrid striped bass by determining nutrient and energy digestibility. Catfish, black drum, and tuna waste products were blended with soybean meal in a 40 : 60 ratio. All diets were subjected to dry extrusion, and then dried to produce stable ingredients. Diets used for the digestibility trial were formulated to contain 40 % crude protein, 10 % lipid and 1 % chromic oxide as a marker, with each ingredient substituted in a reference diet at a 30 : 70 ratio. The yellowfin tuna fillet waste also was evaluated in a comparative feeding trial with juvenile red drum. In that trial, experimental diets with the tuna by-product meal replaced menhaden fishmeal on an equal protein basis at levels of 5, 10, 20, 40 or 60 %. Diets were formulated to contain 40 % crude protein and 12 % lipid. Juvenile red drum were fed the various diets for 7 weeks in 38 -L aquaria linked as a brackish (6 + 1 ppt) water recirculating system. Apparent digestibility coefficient (ADC) values for crude protein, crude lipid, and energy from krill and catfish meal were similar for red drum while the black drum meal had decisively lower values. Krill meal had higher ADC values for organic matter and energy than catfish meal and black drum meal in hybrid striped bass. ADC values of crude protein, and crude lipid were similar for krill, catfish, and black drum ingredients. Based on weight gain and feed efficiency responses in the <b>feeding</b> trial, red <b>drum</b> fed the control diet with only fishmeal significantly outperformed fish fed the tuna-substituted diets. However, {{no significant differences were}} observed among fish fed the diets with 5, 10, 20, or 40 % tuna substitution. These results suggest that {{inclusion of}} seafood processing by-products can be substituted for fishmeal and possibly reduce the price of fish feeds...|$|R
40|$|In {{the mining}} industry, {{ferromagnetic}} particles (e. g. magnetite) are concentrated using wet low-intensity magnetic separation (LIMS). Mineral particles in suspension with water are {{pumped into the}} separator tank, and a magnetic concentrate is extracted by use of magnetic forces. The performance of the process is {{to a large extent}} controlled by the internal flow conditions in the separator, governed by process and machine settings. Due to the machine design these settings are not independent, and in some cases {{it can be difficult to}} reach optimal process performance. The main purpose of this work has been to find a measurement method capable of monitoring internal material transport in the wet LIMS, and use these data, together with numerical flow modelling, to get an increased understanding about the separation process. Since the mineral slurry entering the separator is essentially opaque, and the solids concentration is rather high, an ultrasound-based method was selected for the internal measurements. It is of interest to monitor both the internal flow patterns, as well as material build-up resulting from the magnetic field. The method development and evaluation proceeded in steps with increasing complexity, with later stages building on experience from the former. Initial measurements were done in model systems with simple geometries, and over a range of flow velocities corresponding to flow velocities in full-scale magnetic separators. Additional measurements were done on model systems under influence of a magnetic field of varying strength. After the measurement methods were verified in controlled laboratory conditions they were evaluated in real world conditions; in situ at the LKAB pilot plant in Malmberget, Sweden. For the pilot scale experiments a setup with two ultrasound transducers, mounted at the bottom of the separator tank, was used. The factors included in the designed experiment were the <b>feed</b> solids concentration, <b>drum</b> rotational speed, position of the concentrate weir, and the magnet assembly angle. Based on this investigation the drum rotational speed was the factor having the strongest influence on the overall flow velocity in the dewatering zone. Also, the presence of a recirculating flow transporting gangue particles away from the concentrate was confirmed. The factor with strongest influence on this flow is also the drum rotational speed, together with the magnet assembly angle. Using this method it is possible make high quality measurements of internal flow velocity profiles. It is also possible to monitor material build-up on the separator drum, and e. g. detect overload of magnetic material. The ultrasound based measurement system resulting from this work measures particle velocity based on a cross-correlation principle. Two consecutive ultrasound pulse-echo signals are cross-correlated piece-wise, to obtain a local velocity estimate. By measuring the suspension flow from two directions, using two transducers, 2 D velocity vectors can be estimated. Using the same measured data, but instead studying how the spectral contents of the signal vary with axial distance from the transducer, a qualitative measure of variations in local solids concentration can be obtained. During this work several aspects of wet LIMS have been studied, with focus on the internal material transport processes inside the separators. State-of-the-art measurement methods have been utilized to monitor the material flow inside the separators. Particle capture and entrainment have been studied on the particle level using numerical flow modelling. Measurement results have been linked to operational conditions of the separators. The insights gained, and the methods developed, have generated new possibilities to control, optimise, and develop the wet LIMS process.
