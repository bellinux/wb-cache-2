The store is divided into 19 specialist departments (e.g. coffee, pralines, wine, sausage & ham, fruit & vegetable, fish, cheese, bread, pasta, meat, cold & warm buffet, tea etc.). Due to the television advertisement for the brand Prodomo, the coffee department is the best-known of the departments: Just as in the advertisement, the coffee is still weighed with beam scales today. In {{the centre of the}} shop is the Putten (cherubs) fountain, in which crayfish wait to be sold. To a large extent, the goods offered in the Stammhaus are self-produced: On the second floor, there is a production kitchen, in which 70 chefs create gourmet salads, dishes for the warm buffet and cream cakes. The wine department, in which wines in particular from France, Italy, Germany and Austria are sold, was re-designed in 2008. What Dallmayr cannot produce on-site for reasons of space - such as smoked salmon or chocolate - is produced in their own factories in and around Munich. In Dallmayr’s praline factory near Munich, more than 40 tonnes of handmade pralines and <b>fruit</b> <b>jellies</b> are produced annually in around 70 different varieties.

Preserves are made of small, whole fruits, or uniform-size pieces of fruits in a clear, thick, slightly jellied syrup.
