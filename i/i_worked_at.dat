25|$|Bob Summers, my brother-in-law, {{has come}} into his own over the years too. Bob and I worked a lot on MGM records with the Mike Curb scene, early 1960s. He also was chief {{arranger}} for the Mike Curb Congregation, and they recorded some of my material, great too! Also Bob and <b>I</b> <b>worked</b> <b>at</b> Capitol Records for Ken Nelson and Cliffie Stone, passed recently. Too many country artists to even name nearly all of them: Hank Thompson, Wynn Stewart, Rose Maddox and others. Roy Lanham did one of his better albums at the Sound House, Merced, in El Monte (my old stamping grounds) and Mary Ford's home place, 9840 Kale Street. Bruce Summers (who is no longer with us), a piano man whom I played with a few times; a real swinger too.|$|E
500|$|The {{episode was}} filmed {{on a set}} {{constructed}} at Studio D in the BBC Elstree Centre, run by BBC Studioworks, and authentic 1970s costumes and props were rented for the filming. The studio was retrofitted with cameras and lighting equipment {{that would have been}} used on a 1970s set, including three Ikegami HK 323 cameras and a single Ikegami HK323P camera, all provided by a company called Golden Age Recreations. The filming of the episode thus differed from the series's usual single-camera setup approach. Adam Tandy, Inside No. 9 producer, said that [...] "Studio D has the heritage and familiar atmosphere that I remember from when <b>I</b> <b>worked</b> <b>at</b> Elstree in the 1980s; however, a lot of modernisation has taken place since then and this has allowed us to monitor our 4:3 625-line PAL pictures in BBC Studioworks' state of the art HD production gallery." [...] For Shearsmith, the result was that [...] "it looks shit, but it's brilliant".|$|E
60|$|All of September and October {{was spent}} at the Homestead. Each morning <b>I</b> <b>worked</b> <b>at</b> my writing, and in the {{afternoon}} I drove my mother about the country or wrought some improvement to the place.|$|E
5000|$|... "My name is Seif Adnan Kanaan. <b>I</b> <b>work</b> <b>at</b> Mosul airport... My {{second job}} is to supply {{beverages}} to the US army," [...] the victim said, surrounded by three hooded gunmen.|$|R
6000|$|... "But {{it would}} only be in the afternoon. <b>I</b> <b>work</b> <b>at</b> the school in the morning. After all, it's better to sit to me than to do {{translations}} of legal documents." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, {{you have}} chosen a most {{exquisite}} scene for me. The more <b>I</b> <b>work</b> <b>at</b> it, the more I find to admire. May I look now at what you have done?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "A friend {{asked me}} why I didn't try for the Academie. That started me going to the night schools; I worked every minute--I had to get my living as well, of course, so <b>I</b> <b>worked</b> <b>at</b> night.|$|E
60|$|All day <b>I</b> <b>worked</b> <b>at</b> {{trimming}} vines, {{and planting}} flowers while the robins chuckled from the lawn, and the maples expanded overhead. How spacious and wide and safe the yard appeared, a natural playground {{for the use}} of children.|$|E
6000|$|October 24--Laboured in the morning. At breakfast Dr. Holland[377] and Cohen, {{whom they}} now call Palgrave,[378] a {{mutation}} of names which confused my recollections. Item, Moore. <b>I</b> <b>worked</b> <b>at</b> the Colonial Office pretty hard. Dined with Mr. Wilmot Horton and his beautiful wife, the original of the [...] "She walks in Beauty," [...] etc., of poor Byron.|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh, I {{shall be}} grateful," [...] said Mirah, putting her hands {{together}} devoutly. [...] "I would rather get my bread in that way than by anything more public. I will try to improve. What should <b>I</b> <b>work</b> <b>at</b> most?" ...|$|R
3000|$|The {{objective}} function, {{as presented}} by Eq. (9), focuses on maximizing {{the sum of}} nurses’ preferences for weekends off (the first part) and working shifts during the planning horizon (the second part), respectively. If nurse i is off in weekend t (i.e., [...] s_i, 7 t = 1 [...]), then [...] f_i,t s_i, 7 t indicates the preference of the nurse i to be off in weekend t. Furthermore, if nurse <b>i</b> <b>works</b> <b>at</b> shift j in week t (i.e., [...] x_i,j,t = 1 [...]), then [...] p_i,j,t x_i,j,t indicates the preference of the nurse <b>i</b> to <b>work</b> <b>at</b> shift j in week t.|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{should like}} it very well," [...] said Cicely, {{as she stood}} by the table, [...] "if I could get on faster with it, but <b>I</b> <b>work</b> so very, very slowly. I made a {{calculation}} this morning, that if <b>I</b> <b>work</b> <b>at</b> the same rate that I have been working since I came here, it will take me thirteen years and eleven months to copy your manuscript." ...|$|R
60|$|I shall burden no {{one with}} the dry chronicles of a law office. The acquirement of {{learning}} is a slow process in life, and perchance a slower one in the telling. I lacked not application during the three years of my stay in Richmond, and to earn my living <b>I</b> <b>worked</b> <b>at</b> such odd tasks as came my way.|$|E
60|$|But I didn't know I was {{displacing}} two men. Nobody told me. On the contrary, {{the superintendent}} warned everybody {{not to tell}} me. How valiantly I went at it that first day. <b>I</b> <b>worked</b> <b>at</b> top speed, filling the iron wheelbarrow with coal, running it on the scales and weighing the load, then trundling it into the fire-room and dumping it on the plates before the fires.|$|E
60|$|I made a low reverence, terribly abashed, and I fear {{it would}} have reduced my mother to despair, {{but it was an}} honour that I appreciated; for now that I was a married woman, I was {{permitted}} to read romances, and I had just begun on the first volume of the Grand Curus. My husband read it to me as <b>I</b> <b>worked</b> <b>at</b> my embroidery, and you may guess how we enjoyed it.|$|E
50|$|Kingsford {{trained as}} an {{occupational}} therapist during World War <b>I,</b> and <b>worked</b> <b>at</b> various military hospitals later in her career.|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh, {{anything}}--I mean <b>I</b> would <b>work</b> <b>at,</b> anything <b>I</b> {{could get}} to do, but thus far I haven't {{been able to find}} an occupation." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I am indeed. <b>I</b> <b>work</b> <b>at</b> {{the studio}} of one M. Goudé, {{and if you}} choose to inquire, you will find he is perhaps the best master in Paris. I am afraid the Prussians are going to {{interrupt}} my studies a good deal. This has made me angry and I have enlisted--that is to say, been sworn in {{as a member of the}} Chasseurs des Écoles, which most of the students at Goudé's have joined." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Mother died {{just after}} Emma was born," [...] said the child, {{glancing at the}} face upon her bosom. [...] "Then father said I was {{to be as good}} a mother to her as I could. And so I tried. And so <b>I</b> <b>worked</b> <b>at</b> home and did {{cleaning}} and nursing and washing {{for a long time before}} I began to go out. And that's how I know how; don't you see, sir?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "And I did my {{best with}} it too. You would hardly believe how hard <b>I</b> <b>worked</b> <b>at</b> it. There is not a line {{that has not been}} weighed and written, perhaps, three times over. I do not think I am conceited; but I cannot but believe that there is {{something}} in it. The reviewers are so jealous! if a man has not a name, they will give him credit for nothing; and it is so hard to begin." ...|$|E
60|$|But many a night I did not {{knock off}} work until midnight. On {{occasion}} I worked eighteen and twenty {{hours on a}} stretch. Once <b>I</b> <b>worked</b> <b>at</b> my machine for thirty-six consecutive hours. And there were weeks on end when I never knocked off work earlier than eleven o'clock, got home and in bed at half after midnight, and was called at half-past five to dress, eat, walk to work, and be at my machine at seven o'clock whistle blow.|$|E
60|$|This was true. She {{would have}} been deserting two men instead of one--and so she stayed while <b>I</b> <b>worked</b> away <b>at</b> my story, finding comfort in the {{realization}} of her presence.|$|R

60|$|Every {{thing at}} last being in readiness, the pilot came on board, and all hands {{were called to}} up anchor. While <b>I</b> <b>worked</b> <b>at</b> my bar, I could not help observing how haggard the men looked, {{and how much they}} {{suffered}} from this violent exercise, after the terrific dissipation in which they had been indulging ashore. But I soon learnt that sailors breathe nothing about such things, but strive their best to appear all alive and hearty, though it comes very hard for many of them.|$|E
60|$|Her {{task was}} to hold the boat in {{position}} while <b>I</b> <b>worked</b> <b>at</b> the tangle. And such a tangle—halyards, sheets, guys, down-hauls, shrouds, stays, all washed about and {{back and forth and}} through, and twined and knotted by the sea. I cut no more than was necessary, and what with passing the long ropes under and around the booms and masts, of unreeving the halyards and sheets, of coiling down in the boat and uncoiling in order to pass through another knot in the bight, I was soon wet to the skin.|$|E
60|$|I {{had several}} visits of the like kind from him, {{but he never}} came into a settled way of maintenance, which was what I would have best pleased with. Once, indeed, he asked me how I did to live. I {{answered}} him pretty quick, that I assured him I had never taken that course that I took with him, but that indeed <b>I</b> <b>worked</b> <b>at</b> my needle, and could just maintain myself; that sometime it was as much as I was able to do, and I shifted hard enough.|$|E
25|$|<b>I</b> will {{continually}} <b>work</b> <b>at</b> developing love, {{happiness and}} loyalty in my family.|$|R
5000|$|Stewart Granger {{later said}} he [...] "didn't like" [...] the film {{because of its}} [...] "drippy characters" [...] but thought [...] "Asquith was much the best of those {{directors}} <b>I</b> <b>worked</b> with <b>at</b> Gainsborough." ...|$|R
5000|$|Gibbard is {{the subject}} of the song, [...] "Ben's My Friend", by indie folk act Sun Kil Moon. The track appears on the project's sixth studio album, Benji (2014). On Sun Kil Moon's {{follow-up}} album, Universal Themes (2015), primary recording artist Mark Kozelek again refers to his friendship with Gibbard on its closing track, [...] "This Is My First Day and I'm Indian and <b>I</b> <b>Work</b> <b>at</b> a Gas Station". Gibbard previously made a guest appearance on the band's third studio album, April (2008).|$|R
60|$|From dawn to dark {{each day}} Hans and <b>I</b> <b>worked</b> <b>at</b> trying to convert these Kendah into sharpshooters. It was {{no easy task}} with men, however willing, who till then had never held a gun, {{especially}} as I must be very sparing of the ammunition necessary to practice, of which of course our supply was limited. Still we taught them how to take cover, how to fire and to cease from firing at a word of command, also to hold the rifles low and waste no shot. To make marksmen of them was more than I could hope to do under the circumstances.|$|E
6000|$|<b>I</b> <b>worked</b> <b>at</b> Sullivan's {{place in}} Widnes, {{better known as}} the British [...] Alkali Chemical Works. I was working in a shed, and I had to cross [...] the yard. It was ten o'clock at night, and there was no light about. [...] While {{crossing}} the yard I felt something take hold of my leg and screw [...] it off. I became unconscious; I didn't know what became of me for a [...] day or two. On the following Sunday night I came to my senses, and [...] found myself in the hospital. I asked the nurse what was to do with [...] my legs, and she told me both legs were off.|$|E
6000|$|... "I picked {{most of it}} up when I was a boy. My {{grandfather}} was an Irish sailor with such a tremendous voice that a Neapolitan music master brought him out in opera as a buffo. When he had roared his voice away, {{he went into the}} chorus. My father was reared in Italy, and looked more Italian than most genuine natives. He had no voice; so he became first accompanist, then chorus master, and finally trainer for the operatic stage. He speculated in an American tour; married out there; lost all his money; and came over to England, when I was only twelve, to resume his business at Covent Garden. I stayed in America, and was apprenticed to an electrical engineer. <b>I</b> <b>worked</b> <b>at</b> the bench there for six years." ...|$|E
60|$|I {{have done}} {{no more to}} my fables. I find I must let things take their time. I am {{constant}} to my schemes; but <b>I</b> must <b>work</b> <b>at</b> them fitfully as the humour moves.|$|R
6000|$|I {{turned in}} my chair. The man-servant whom the Duke {{had put in}} charge of the [...] "Brand," [...] my present habitation, and who {{remained}} with me always in the room while <b>I</b> <b>worked,</b> stood <b>at</b> my elbow.|$|R
40|$|As music {{therapist}} <b>I</b> <b>work</b> <b>at</b> YDO {{one afternoon}} per week {{with an open}} group, with adolescents involved in assault cases.

I had a flip chart on which I transcribed the story as they presented different aspects of it. Before playing the CDs I asked the group what our story should be based on, and they decided that the story would be about Eersterust, their home-town...|$|R
