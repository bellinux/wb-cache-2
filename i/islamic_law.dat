5|$|The Oran fatwa was a responsum fatwa, or an Islamic legal opinion, {{issued in}} 1504 {{to address the}} crisis that {{occurred}} when Muslims in the Crown of Castile (now part of Spain) were forced to convert to Christianity in 15001502. The fatwa sets out detailed relaxations of the sharia (<b>Islamic</b> <b>law)</b> requirements, allowing the Muslims to conform outwardly to Christianity and perform acts that are ordinarily forbidden in <b>Islamic</b> <b>law,</b> when necessary to survive. It includes relaxed instructions for fulfilling the ritual prayers, the ritual charity, and the ritual ablution, and recommendations when obliged to violate <b>Islamic</b> <b>law,</b> such as worshipping as Christians, committing blasphemy, and consuming pork and wine.|$|E
5|$|The {{influence}} of the fatwa was limited to Spain. Outside the Iberian Peninsula, the predominant opinion continued to uphold the unbending requirements of <b>Islamic</b> <b>law</b> and required Muslims to leave any country, or even choose martyrdom, where approved observance of the religion became impossible.|$|E
5|$|The {{success and}} {{expansion}} of Islam brought it into contact with different cultures, societies and traditions, {{such as those of}} Byzantines and Persians. With such contact, new problems emerged for <b>Islamic</b> <b>law</b> to tackle. Moreover, there was a significant distance between Medina, the Islamic capital, and the Muslims on the periphery on the Islamic state. Thus far off jurists had to find novel Islamic solutions without the close supervision of the hub of <b>Islamic</b> <b>law</b> (back in Medina). During the Umayyad dynasty, the concept of qiyas was abused by the rulers. The Abbasids, who succeeded the Umayyads defined it more strictly, in an attempt to apply it more consistently.|$|E

5|$|Various {{sources of}} sharia {{are used by}} Islamic {{jurisprudence}} to elucidate the body of <b>Islamic</b> <b>law.</b> The primary source accepted universally by all Muslims is the Qur'an, the majority adhering also to the traditionally reported Sunnah, but rejected by others; Quranism. The Qur'an is the holy scripture of Islam, believed by Muslims to be the direct and unaltered word of God. The Sunnah consists of the alleged religious actions and quotations of the Islamic prophet Muhammad, narrated through his Companions and the Imams (per the beliefs of the Sunni and Shi'ite schools respectively).|$|E
40|$|In the Netherlands, where {{views of}} Muslims and <b>Islamic</b> family <b>law</b> are highly politicised, the {{application}} of <b>Islamic</b> family <b>laws</b> by Dutch courts is a topic of heated political debate.

In order to assess the gendered impact of <b>Islamic</b> family <b>laws</b> in a European context, this article takes a closer look at Dutch state courts’ decisions. It asks how {{the application of}} <b>Islamic</b> family <b>laws</b> can be understood against the background of Dutch political discourses on Islam, family law and women’s rights. While in public and political debates, <b>Islamic</b> family <b>laws</b> are frequently thought to be women-unfriendly, this article shows that the encounter between <b>Islamic</b> family <b>laws</b> and Dutch law often has severe impact on the position of Muslim men living in the Netherlands...|$|R

Prior to the British Mandate period, boys would {{normally}} receive education in a kuttab, an elementary-type school with <b>Islamic</b> <b>law</b> and tradition having {{a major influence on}} the curriculum. Today, there is one elementary school (Bani Zeid Elementary School) and one secondary school (Bashir al-Barghouti Secondary School) in the town of Bani Zeid, both run by the government. According to the Palestinian Ministry of Education and Higher Education, in the 2010-2011 academic year there were 26 classes occupied by 691 students, both male and female.

5|$|After its {{dedication}} in 972, {{and with}} the hiring by mosque authorities of 35 scholars in 989, the mosque slowly developed into what is today the second oldest continuously run university in the world after Al Karaouine in Umayyad Fes.

5|$|Although the mosque-school was {{the leading}} {{university}} in the Islamic world and had regained royal patronage, it did not overtake the madrasas as the favored place of education among Cairo's elite.
