5|$|The TGS with Tracy Jordan crew have {{finished}} taping their fiftieth episode {{and decide to}} celebrate. Their boss, Vice President of East Coast Television and Microwave Oven Programming for General Electric, Jack Donaghy (Alec Baldwin), goes to the writers' room and tells the show's head writer, Liz Lemon (Tina Fey), about <b>how</b> <b>the</b> <b>whole</b> company is undergoing cutbacks. After an unsuccessful presentation about TGS, Brad Halster (Roger Bart)—one of the consultants {{in charge of the}} cutbacks—informs Liz that she needs to cut her annual budget by 25 percent. Liz, anxious about her employees losing their jobs, decides to use sexual bartering to solve the problem and asks Brad on a date, which he accepts. Liz dresses in the trashiest outfit she can find, and goes on her date. The next day, she discovers that cutbacks are still taking place at TGS, and confronts Brad. Realizing that he was being used, Brad charges Liz with sexual harassment and she is suspended from work for two weeks. Jack tells Liz that the budget review process will start over again, this time under his supervision.|$|E
25|$|Several {{variants}} of democracy exist, {{but there are}} two basic forms, both of which concern <b>how</b> <b>the</b> <b>whole</b> body of all eligible citizens executes its will. One form of democracy is direct democracy, in which all eligible citizens have active participation in the political decision making, for example voting on policy initiatives directly. In most modern democracies, the whole body of eligible citizens remain the sovereign power but political power is exercised indirectly through elected representatives; this is called a representative democracy.|$|E

25|$|Zwicky also {{considered}} the possibility of rearranging the universe to our own liking. In a lecture in 1948 he spoke of changing planets, or relocating them within the solar system. In the 1960s he even considered <b>how</b> <b>the</b> <b>whole</b> solar system might be moved like a giant spaceship to travel to other stars. He considered this might be achieved by firing pellets into the Sun to produce asymmetrical fusion explosions, and by this means {{he thought that the}} star Alpha Centauri might be reached within 2500 years.|$|E
25|$|The {{historian}} Ibn Hawqal {{wrote about}} the invasion of 870, describing <b>how</b> <b>the</b> <b>whole</b> islands were depopulated. Modern scholars debate whether the invasion marked an outright “ethnic break and not merely a cultural and religious switch on the Maltese islands.” Little is known about Żejtun under Arab rule. Outside Mdina and possibly Birgu, hardly any village existed. However, a number of Late Medieval place-names in the general area of Żejtun, such as Bir id-Deheb, Ħajt il-Wied, Tal-Ħotba and Bulebel il-Kbir serve to highlight the intensity with which the area was used. One such name, il-Minżel, in Bulebel iż-Żgħir, can be translated as 'field at the descent' or the 'field at the house,' with the word manzil meaning a resting place, a place of alighting, settlement or abode. A large number of place-names implies the accessibility of the land, and therefore its use. Hence, the area was extensively used, with the Arabs using the established agroindustrial infrastructure {{as the basis for}} their presence in Malta and Gozo.|$|E

In his review of the second volume, Alexander wrote that [...] "so far, the story continues to be a fun examination of what life might be like from the cat's point of view, but I don't know <b>how</b> <b>the</b> <b>whole</b> Wild Cat storyline is going to be wrapped up in only one more volume". In his review of the third volume, Alexander felt that [...] "the story probably received an early ending", but concluded that [...] "despite the series only being three volumes, it really is a worthy read and quite funny if you've ever owned a cat".|$|E
500|$|... ere we have John Wayne, {{who was a}} major {{artistic and}} {{psychological}} figure on the American scene, ... who at one point used to make movies of soldiers who had a certain validity, ... {{a certain sense of}} honor [...] what the soldier was doing.... Even if it was a cavalry movie doing a historically dishonorable thing to the Indians, even as there was a feeling of {{what it meant to be}} a man, what it meant to have some sense of duty.... Now today we have the same actor making his new war movie in a war so hopelessly corrupt that, without seeing the movie, I'm sure it is perfectly safe to say that it will be an almost robot-view of soldiery, just by definition of <b>how</b> <b>the</b> <b>whole</b> country has deteriorated. And I think it would make a very interesting double feature to show a good old Wayne movie like, say, She Wore a Yellow Ribbon with The Green Berets. Because that would make a very striking comment on what has happened to America in general.|$|E

Of Natasha's rash decision, Novakovic explained [...] "She is hurt and the whole cheating thing has really crushed her. She feels like the fool, no one goes behind her back. And she feels they are pitying her because of her injury [...] and [...] really hates that." [...] Natasha wants Andrew and Summer to feel guilty about betraying her and she wants Andrew for herself. Andrew believes Natasha is pregnant and instead of being with Summer, he decides to stick by Natasha and their baby. Novakovic said that the new storyline is [...] "very exciting" [...] {{and she could not}} wait to discover the new developments. Novakovic insisted that Natasha is making the plan up as she goes along. She has not thought it out or <b>how</b> <b>the</b> <b>whole</b> situation might end. Her main goal is to keep Andrew and Summer apart because they betrayed and hurt her. Natasha and Andrew attend a pre-natal class together and they get on quite well. During an interview with Digital Spy, Novakovic explained that Natasha is reminded of why she fell for Andrew in the first place, especially when she sees his gentle side. Because Natasha is getting along well Andrew, there are times when she feels guilty for what she is doing. Natasha does not have any sort of plan to admit the truth as she knows Andrew will be angry.|$|E
