50|$|It is {{the longer}} {{of the only}} two 1.2 lenses Canon makes, other being the 50mm 1.2L USM. This lens is {{constructed}} with a metal body and mount, and with rubber gripping and plastic extremities. It features a wide rubber focusing ring and a <b>distance</b> <b>window</b> with infrared index.|$|E
50|$|The EF 50mm 1.8 is {{an economy}} level lens (discontinued in 1990), {{which has been}} {{replaced}} by the EF 50mm 1.8 II. The body is plastic but the lens mount is metal, and it features a <b>distance</b> <b>window</b> with infrared index. A 5 blade maximum aperture of 1.8 gives this lens the ability to create depth of field effects.|$|E
30|$|To {{quantify}} {{distortion of}} the apparent radiation pattern from double-couple point source predictions, we simply calculated the cross-correlation coefficient (CCC) between the observation and theoretical amplitude fluctuations using moving hypocentral <b>distance</b> <b>windows</b> (40 – 70, 50 – 80, 60 – 90, 70 – 100, 80 – 110, 90 – 120, and 100 – 130  km).|$|R
50|$|RMCProfile is a {{significantly}} developed {{version of the}} original RMC code, written in Fortran 95 with some Fortran 2003 features. It has maintained the ability to model liquids and amorphous materials using the pair distribution function, total scattering and EXAFS data, but also includes the capability of modelling crystalline materials by explicitly using the information contained within the Bragg diffraction data. RMCProfile gives users a range of constraints, including the inclusion of molecular potentials and <b>distance</b> <b>windows,</b> which exploit possibilities afforded {{by the lack of}} significant diffusion in crystalline materials. RMCProfile allows simulation of magnetic materials, using the magnetic component of total scattering data, and also allows simulation of materials where atoms are allowed to swap positions (as found in many solid solutions).|$|R
50|$|Based {{on similar}} dataset (21,477 {{occupants}}), in 2013, Schiavon and Altomonte, found that occupants have equivalent satisfaction levels in LEED and non-LEED buildings when evaluated independently {{from the following}} nine factors: (1) office type, (2) spatial layout, (3) <b>distance</b> from <b>windows,</b> (4) building size, (5) gender, (6) age, (7) type of work, (8) time at workspace, and (9) weekly working hours.|$|R
5000|$|First {{introduced}} in 1987, {{it is the}} oldest lens in Canon's current lineup (...) that is still available new. The lens is constructed with a plastic body and metal mount, and features a <b>distance</b> <b>window</b> with infrared index and magnification markings. The optional Life-Size Converter EF adapts the lens to produce a maximum magnification of 1:1. Attaching the converter increases the lens focal length to 70mm, reduces the maximum aperture to 3.5 and limits the focal range. Magnification markings for the converter are shown on the (extending) inner lens barrel.|$|E
50|$|The EF 35 mm 2 is an enthusiast-level lens. Like the {{original}} version of the 2 lens, it has a plastic body and a metal mount, but adds image stabilization. It also has an eight-blade diaphragm with rounded blades, {{as opposed to the}} eight non-rounded blades of the 1.4L lens and the five non-rounded blades of {{the original}} 2 model. This lens features a <b>distance</b> <b>window</b> with infrared index. The optical construction of this lens contains 10 elements in 8 groups, including one molded aspherical element. It uses a ring-type USM motor. The front of the lens neither rotates nor extends when focusing.|$|E
50|$|The EF 85mm 1.8 USM is a {{consumer}} level lens. It is the shorter sister to the EF 100mm 2.0 USM, {{and is designed}} very similarly. It is constructed with a plastic body and a metal mount. This lens features a <b>distance</b> <b>window</b> with infrared index. An 8 blade, maximum aperture of 1.8, gives this lens {{the ability to create}} depth of field effects. The optical construction of this lens contains 9 lens elements, without any special lens elements. It uses an internal focusing system (meaning that the front of the lens neither rotates nor extends when focusing), powered by a ring type USM motor. Auto focus speed of this lens is very fast.|$|E

40|$|The results {{obtained}} {{in a cell}} with a <b>distance</b> between <b>windows</b> {{on the order of}} several hundreds of nanometers (the so-called “nanocell”) are presented. The nanocell thickness L in the vertical direction changes from 100 to 900 nm. It is shown that the use of a nanocell with thickness L = λ/ 2, where λ is a laser wavelength resonant to the atomic transition D 2 in sodium atoms, provides sub-Doppler resolution of transmission and fluorescence spectra...|$|R

50|$|The EF 35 mm 2 is a {{prosumer}} level lens. It {{is constructed}} {{with a plastic}} body and a metal mount. This lens features a <b>distance</b> <b>window</b> with infrared index. The maximum aperture of 2 gives this lens {{the ability to create}} depth of field effects, but not to the same shallowness of the EF 35 mm 1.4L USM, while its five-blade diaphragm may produce background blur (bokeh). The optical construction of this lens contains seven lens elements, without any special lens elements. It uses a linear extension focusing system, powered by an AFD motor.

40|$|Frequently {{physical}} requirements related to luminous and thermal comfort conflict {{the ones with}} the others in the classrooms. In facts physical quantities values influencing comfort are sensibly variable from point to point, principally as function of the <b>distance</b> from <b>windows.</b> This work proposes a computer method aimed to forecast and to evaluate the effects of a movable solar control device and its control logic, with regard both to comfort conditions and to energy demand.

30|$|In the {{detection}} method, a moving window with {{the length of}} half cycle is considered. In the window, besides finding the fifth nearest neighbor for each point of the squared normalized currents, the distance between each point and its corresponding neighbor is found. By comparing the maximum <b>distance</b> in each <b>window</b> with an adaptive threshold, the fault is detected.|$|R

40|$|We {{present a}} {{computerized}} pattern recognition model used to speciate mycobacteria {{based on their}} {{restriction fragment length polymorphism}} (RFLP) banding patterns. DNA fragment migration distances were normalized to minimize lane-to-lane variability of band location both within and among gels through the inclusion of two internal size standards in each sample. The computer model used a library of normalized RFLP patterns derived from samples of known origin to create a probability matrix which was then used to classify the RFLP patterns from samples of unknown origin. The probability matrix contained the proportion of bands that fell within defined migration <b>distance</b> <b>windows</b> for each species in the library of reference samples. These proportions were then used to compute the likelihood that the banding pattern of an unknown sample corresponded to that of each species represented in the probability matrix. As a test of this process, we developed an automated, computer-assisted model for the identification of Mycobacterium species based on their normalized RFLP banding patterns. The probability matrix contained values for the M. tuberculosis complex, M. avium, M. intraceffufare, M. kansasii and M. gordonae species. Thirty-nine independent strains of known origin, not included in the probability matrix, were used to test the accuracy of the method in classifying unknowns: 37 of 39 (94. 9 %) were classified correctly. An additional set of 16 strains of known origin representing species not included in the model were tested to gauge the robustness of the probability matrix. Every sample was correctly identified as an outlier, i. e. a member of...|$|R

50|$|The EF 50mm 1.4 USM is a consumer- and professional-level lens. It is {{the least}} {{expensive}} 1.4 aperture lens that Canon currently manufactures. It is constructed with a plastic body and a metal mount. This lens features a <b>distance</b> <b>window</b> with infrared index. An 8-blade diaphragm and maximum aperture of 1.4 give this lens {{the ability to create}} shallow depth of field effects. The optical construction of this lens contains 7 lens elements including 2 high refraction elements, but no aspherical, high dispersion or calcium fluoride elements. The lens uses a front extension focusing system, powered by a micro USM motor. Even though this lens uses a micro USM motor, it still has FTM (full-time manual focus) available. Auto-focus speed of this lens is fast, but not as quick as most ring-USM-based lenses. The front of the lens does not rotate, but extends by up to about one centimeter when focusing.|$|E
50|$|The Sigma 50mm 1.4 EX DG HSM is {{constructed}} {{with a plastic}} body and a metal mount. This lens features a <b>distance</b> <b>window</b> with depth of field scale. A nine-blade, maximum aperture of 1.4 gives the lens {{the ability to create}} shallow depth-of-field effects. The optical construction of this lens contains eight lens elements, including one aspherical lens element. This lens uses a front extension focusing system, powered by a ring USM motor. Auto-focus speed of the lens is moderate; it is not as fast as most ring USM lenses. The front of the lens does not rotate, but does extend when focusing. The lens is designed so that the outer body barrel is longer than the inner lens barrel, when the inner lens barrel is at its longest extension. This results in the lens maintaining the same overall length no matter where the point of focus lies.|$|E

40|$|The {{advantage}} {{of very high}} resolution (VHR) TerraSAR-X imagery for cartographic applications is obvious. The real potential of this class of SAR data, however, lies in applications, where the coherent nature of SAR data is exploited, like interferometry or tomography. The 1 m resolution is particularly helpful {{when it comes to}} 2 D, 3 D, or 4 D imaging of buildings and urban structures. The inherent spatial scales of buildings are dominated by the typical height between floors of 3 – 3. 5 m, i. e. in slant range (@ 30 deg) 2. 6 – 3. 0 m, and the <b>distance</b> of <b>windows.</b> Hence, for imaging of urban structures we can expect a tremendous improvement in information content when we go from high to very high resolution...|$|R

5000|$|The {{discontinued}} EF 50mm 1.0L USM is {{a professional}} L series autofocus lens. On the used market sells {{for as much as}} double the original retail value. It was the fastest SLR lens in production during its lifetime. This lens has a metal body and mount, and plastic extremities. It also features a wide rubber focus ring that is damped, a <b>distance</b> <b>window</b> with infrared index, and the ability to set the focus range from 0.6m to infinity, or 1m to infinity. In common with the EF 85mm f/1.2L USM it uses an electronic [...] "focus by wire" [...] system and requires power from the camera in order to manual focus. The 8-blade diaphragm and maximum aperture of 1.0 give this lens the ability to create extremely shallow depth of field effects and to support low light situations.

40|$|Systems using text {{windows to}} model word {{contexts}} have mostly been using fixed-sized windows and uniform weights. The window size is often selected {{by trial and}} error to maximize task results. We propose a non-supervised method for selecting weights for each <b>window</b> <b>distance,</b> effectively removing the need to limit window sizes, by maximizing the mutual generation of two sets of samples of the same word. Experiments on Semeval Word Sense Disambiguation tasks showed considerable improvements. ...|$|R
50|$|The {{constraint}} solver is used {{to constrain}} window behavior. For example, one can constrain two windows to have equal height, or to force the <b>distance</b> between two <b>windows</b> to be constant. In real time, the Cassowary constraint solver re-solves the system of equalities and inequalities and applies the new mathematical solution to the on-screen layout, animating windows to their new positions. Other features include flexible GUI-driven customization and per window decoration settings (per window 'themes').|$|R
40|$|Sequences {{of events}} arise {{naturally}} in various applications. Such sequences consist of pairs of event type and occurrence time. The similarity search {{problem is the}} following: given a query window into the sequence, i. e., the subsequence consisting of the events occurring within a period of time, find all windows of the sequence such that they {{are similar to the}} query window. The similarity between two windows is defined by an edit distance notion. The edit <b>distance</b> between two <b>windows</b> in an event sequence can be computed using dynamic programming algorithms, but such computations are slow. We show how a fingerprinting approach can radically improve the performance. We map fixed-width windows of the data to k-dimensional real vectors by random projections, i. e., by assigning to each event type a random vector and combining the vectors corresponding to the events of a window in a sum, weighted by the relative positions of the events. Then, the ordinary Euclidean distance between k-vectors is used as the approximate <b>distance</b> between <b>windows.</b> We show that small variations in a window have a small expected effect in the feature space. Thus, if two windows have small edit distance, the random projections can be expected to have small distance, and vice versa. The time and space complexity of the mapping is O(kn), where n is the length of the input sequence. We give test results on telecommunications alarm data and the Entree Chicago data of the UCI KDD Archive, showing that the method indeed finds similar situations and works quite fast...|$|R
