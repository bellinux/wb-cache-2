5|$|Malaria {{vaccines}} {{have been}} an elusive goal of research.

5|$|Retrospectively, GoldenEye 007 is {{considered}} an important game {{in the history of}} first-person shooters for <b>demonstrating</b> <b>the</b> viability of game consoles as platforms for the genre, and for signalling a transition from the then-standard Doom-like approach to a more realistic style. It pioneered features such as atmospheric single-player missions, stealth elements, and a console multiplayer deathmatch mode.

A spiritual successor, Perfect Dark, was released in 2000, while a reimagining of the game, also titled GoldenEye 007, was released in 2010.|$|E
5|$|ASL {{is thought}} to have {{originated}} in the American School for the Deaf (ASD), founded in Hartford, Connecticut in 1817. Originally known as The American Asylum, At Hartford, For The Education And Instruction Of The Deaf And Dumb, the school was founded by the Yale graduate and divinity student Thomas Hopkins Gallaudet. Gallaudet, inspired by his success in <b>demonstrating</b> <b>the</b> learning abilities of a young deaf girl Alice Cogswell, traveled to Europe in order to learn deaf pedagogy from European institutions. Ultimately, Gallaudet chose to adopt the methods of the French Institut National de Jeunes Sourds de Paris, and convinced Laurent Clerc, an assistant to the school's founder Charles-Michel de l'Épée, to accompany him back to the United States. Upon his return, Gallaudet founded the ASD on April 15, 1817.|$|E
5|$|According to Pfälzner, a final burial stage can be noticed, {{which he}} calls the {{quaternary}} burial. Tomb VII, which most probably contained remains {{taken out of the}} royal hypogeum, seems to have worked as a storage for the remains of individuals whose Kispu cycle came to an end; very few bowls were found in that tomb. The Kispu was important for <b>demonstrating</b> <b>the</b> legitimacy of the king, thus it needed to be public and visible to a large crowd; Pfälzner suggests that hall A in the royal palace was the place for the public Kispu and that the antechamber of the royal hypogeum was dedicated for private Kispu that included only the king and the spirits of his ancestors.|$|E

5|$|Because of its higher {{susceptibility}} {{and lower}} reliance on fire for reproduction, the optimal fire interval for B.prionotes {{is higher than}} for other Banksia species with which it occurs. One simulation suggested an interval of 18 years was optimal for B.prionotes, compared to 15 years for B.hookeriana and 11 years for B.attenuata. The same model suggested that B.prionotes is quite susceptible to reductions in fire intervals. On the other hand, it shows little susceptibility to increases in fire interval: although senescence and death are often observed in plants older than about 30 years, healthy stands have been observed that have escaped fire for 50 years. These stands have a multi-aged structure, <b>demonstrating</b> <b>the</b> occurrence of successful inter-fire recruitment.|$|E
5|$|Because {{the kingdom}} was {{largely based on}} agriculture, the {{construction}} of irrigation works was a major achievement of the Anuradhapura Kingdom, ensuring water supply in the dry zone and helping the country grow mostly self-sufficient. Several kings, most notably Vasabha and Mahasena, built large reservoirs and canals, which created a vast and complex irrigation network in the Rajarata area throughout the Anuradhapura period. These constructions are {{an indication of the}} advanced technical and engineering skills used to create them. The famous paintings and structures at Sigiriya; the Ruwanwelisaya, Jetavana stupas, and other large stupas; large buildings like the Lovamahapaya; and religious works (like the numerous Buddha statues) are landmarks <b>demonstrating</b> <b>the</b> Anuradhapura period's advancement in sculpting.|$|E
5|$|By {{the time}} of the {{disintegration}} of the Soviet Union, Sukhoi had been <b>demonstrating</b> <b>the</b> Su-27M to senior defence and government officials. With its debut to a Western audience at the 1992 Farnborough Airshow, the company redesignated the aircraft as Su-35. The aircraft subsequently made flying demonstrations overseas in an effort to attract export orders, starting in November 1993 with Dubai, where Viktor Pugachev flew it in a mock aerial engagement with an Su-30MK in front of spectators. The aircraft thereafter flew in Berlin and Paris, and would be a regular feature at Moscow's MAKS Air Show. The Russian government cleared the aircraft for export during Sukhoi's unsuccessful sales campaign in South Korea during the late 1990s and early 2000s; the company also marketed the aircraft to Brazil, China and the United Arab Emirates.|$|E
