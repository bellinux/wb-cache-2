40|$|Molecular clouds have a {{hierarchical}} structure from few tens of parsecs for giants to few {{tenth of a}} parsec for proto-stellar cores. Nowadays, our observational techniques are so advanced {{that it has become}} possible to detect the small-scale substructures inside the molecular cores. The question that arises is how these small condensations are formed. In the present research, we study the effect of ambipolar <b>diffusion</b> <b>heating</b> on the ubiquitous perturbations in a molecular cloud and investigate the possibility of converting them to dense substructures. For this purpose, a small azimuthal perturbation is implemented on the density of an axisymmetric two-dimensional cylindrical cloud, and its evolution is simulated by the technique of two-fluid smoothed particle hydrodynamics. The self-gravity is not included and the initial state has uniform density, temperature and magnetic field, parallel to the axis of cylinder. In addition, all perturbed quantities are assumed to depend only on azimuth angle and time. Computer experiments show that if the ambipolar <b>diffusion</b> <b>heating</b> is ignored, the perturbation will be dispersed over the time. Including the heating due to ambipolar diffusion heats the matter in regions adjacent to the perturbation, thus, leading to the transfer of matter into the perturbed area. In this case, the density of perturbations can be increased. Also, the results of simulations show that an increase of the initial magnetic pressure leads to the intensification of difference between density of perturbations and their surroundings (i. e. increasing of density contrast). This effect is due to the direct relationship of the drift velocity to the intensity of the magnetic field and its gradient. Simulations with different initial uniform densities show that the growth of relative density contrast is more clear with a special density. This result {{can be explained by the}} intensification of thermal instability in this special density...|$|E

40|$|Giant {{molecular}} clouds contain supersonic turbulence and {{simulations of}} magnetohydrodynamic turbulence show that these supersonic motions decay in roughly a crossing time, {{which is less}} than the estimated lifetimes of molecular clouds. Such a situation requires a significant release of energy. We run models of C-type shocks propagating into gas with densities around 10 ^ 3 cm^(- 3) at velocities of a few km / s, appropriate for the ambient conditions inside of a molecular cloud, to determine which species and transitions dominate the cooling and radiative energy release associated with shock cooling of turbulent molecular clouds. We find that these shocks dissipate their energy primarily through CO rotational transitions and by compressing pre-existing magnetic fields. We present model spectra for these shocks and by combining these models with estimates for the rate of turbulent energy dissipation, we show that shock emission should dominate over emission from unshocked gas for mid to high rotational transitions (J > 5) of CO. We also find that the turbulent energy dissipation rate is roughly equivalent to the cosmic-ray heating rate and that the ambipolar <b>diffusion</b> <b>heating</b> rate may be significant, especially in shocked gas.

With - 2 kG the usual axial contraction and heating rates of 1 keV/ μsec were found.

The objective of this thesis is to develop a process by which semiconductor devices and circuits can be implemented completely in-house using spin-on dopants (SODs), and low-cost transparency masks, to significantly reduce the lead time, complexity, and cost associated with device fabrication. This will allow hands on fabrication experience for students at universities and colleges without the traditional expensive device fabrication facilities.

We formulate the physical basis for the streamline-by-streamline integration of the ionization and heat equations of the steady x-wind. In addition to the well-known processes associated with the interaction of stellar and accretion-funnel hot-spot radiation with the wind, we include X-ray heating and ionization, mechanical heating, and a revised calculation of ambipolar <b>diffusion</b> <b>heating.</b> The mechanical heating arises from fluctuations produced by star-disk interactions of the time dependent x-wind that are carried by the wind to large distances where they are dissipated in shocks, MHD waves, and turbulent cascades. We model the time-averaged heating by the scale-free volumetric heating rate, Γ_ mech = αρ v^ 3 s^- 1, where ρ and v are the local mass density and wind speed, respectively, s is the distance from the origin, and α is a phenomenological constant. When we consider a partially-revealed but active young stellar object, we find that choosing α∼ 10 ^- 3 in our numerical calculations produces temperatures and electron fractions that are high enough for the x-wind jet to radiate in the optical forbidden lines at the level and on the spatial scales that are observed. We also discuss a variety of applications of our thermal-chemical calculations that can lead to further observational checks of x-wind theory. Comment: 48 pages, 5 figures, ApJ in press.

40|$|The present work {{deals with}} the {{viability}} of a method for Si enrichment of conventional Fe- 3 %Si sheets, by means of physical vapour deposition of Si at its surface and subsequent <b>diffusion</b> <b>heating.</b> The aim is to obtain magnetic sheets with a Si content of 6. 5 wt%, for they show higher resistivity and null magnetostriction, leading to lower energy losses and solving the noise problems at high frequencies. The PVD deposited films, with ~ 5 μm thickness, show good adhesion to the substrate. Concerning the heat treatment, there is a critical heating rate between 5 and 15 °/min, above which delamination {{of the film is}} observed without formation of intermetallics at the interface. At 3 °/min the conditions for the formation of intermetallics are given. Direct heating up to 800 °C leads to the formation of a Fe 3 Si(α 1) surface layer, which, being brittle, does not delaminate during the heating process. Subsequent heating up to temperatures around 1200 °C allows the homogenisation of the sheet composition. There is evidence of Kirkendall effect in the diffusion couple Fe 3 Si(α 1) /Fe(α), {{due to the fact that}} the diffusion of Fe in Fe 3 Si(α 1) is faster than the diffusion of Si in Fe(α). El presente trabajo estudia la viabilidad de un método para enriquecer en Si chapas de Fe- 3 %Si convencionales, depositando Si en su superficie mediante PVD y sometiéndolas a un tratamiento térmico de difusión. Se trata de obtener chapas magnéticas con un contenido en Si de un 6, 5 % en peso, ya que éstas presentan mayor resistividad y magnetoestricción nula, reduciendo las pérdidas y solucionando los problemas de ruido a altas frecuencias. Las capas depositadas por PVD, de espesores ~ 5 μm, presentan buena adherencia al substrato. En cuanto al tratamiento térmico, se observa que hay una velocidad de calentamiento crítica entre 5 y 15 °/min, por encima de la cual la película se despega sin llegarse a formar intermetálicos en la intercara. A 3 °/min se dan las condiciones para la formación de intermetálicos. Calentando directamente hasta temperaturas de unos 800 °C se obtiene una capa superficial de Fe 3 Si(α 1) que, aun siendo frágil, no se despega durante el tratamiento. Un calentamiento posterior hasta temperaturas del orden de 1200 °C permite la homogeneización de la composición de la chapa.

40|$|Cool {{magnetohydrodynamics}} (MHD) disc wind {{physics is}} reviewed {{by means of}} a self-similar analytical model, putting special emphasis on the mathematical aspects of the solution. It is found that the key parameter of the theory (mu) measures the relation between magnetic and tidal forces. The generation of MHD winds from accretion discs requires a subtle tuning between both stresses because only a narrow range of mu values is allowed; this range is, indeed, close to the cut-off of the magnetic turbulence induced by the development of the Balbus-Hawley instability. The space of solutions can be separated into two quite distinct classes: low -musolutions generate magnetically dominated outflows and display a characteristic density change from horizontal to vertical stratification, while in high -musolutions the density decreases without any intermediate enhancement as the rotation axis is approached. These theoretical (dynamical) results have been used to study the properties of the base of the wind. Density and velocity laws have been derived directly from the dynamics. The effect of the propagation of the stellar X-ray radiation through the wind has been analysed to determine the temperature law {{at the base of the}} wind (polar angles theta > 45 degrees). It is shown that a cocoon of photoionized gas is generated around the star. The extent of the photoionized region is small (tenths of au) in dense outflows and close to the disc plane; however, it may cover the whole wind extent in diffuse winds, e. g. disc winds generated by small accretion rates (less than or equal to 10 (- 9) M-circle dot yr(- 1)). Photoionization also modifies the electron density in the plasma. As a consequence, the ambipolar <b>diffusion</b> <b>heating</b> decreases in the inner part of the wind by roughly one order of magnitude with respect to that derived by other authors. In fact, radiative heating controls the thermal properties of the inner 0. 3 and 1 au of the disc wind for accretion rates of 10 (- 7) and 10 (- 8) M-circle dot yr(- 1), respectively. The temperature of the densest region (base) of the wind is, at most, similar or equal to 10 000 K. Therefore, although densities as high as similar to 10 (9) cm(- 3) can be achieved by disc winds, the temperature is significantly smaller than the similar to 5 x 10 (5) - 8 x 10 (5) K derived from the ultraviolet (UV) observations of the base of the optical jets. Also, it is shown that densities as high as similar to 10 (9) cm(- 3) cannot be achieved at the jet recollimation point for the accretion rates observed in the T Tauri stars. In summary, we conclude that the flow traced by the UV semiforbidden lines is not associated with cold disc winds but, most likely, it is tracing the hot inner jet, postulated in cold disc wind theory, which prevents the radial collapse of the wind...|$|E
