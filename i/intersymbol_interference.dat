25|$|One key {{principle}} of OFDM {{is that since}} low symbol rate modulation schemes (i.e., where the symbols are relatively long compared to the channel time characteristics) suffer less from <b>intersymbol</b> <b>interference</b> caused by multipath propagation, it is advantageous to transmit a number of low-rate streams in parallel instead of a single high-rate stream. Since the duration of each symbol is long, it is feasible to insert a guard interval between the OFDM symbols, thus eliminating the <b>intersymbol</b> <b>interference.</b>|$|E
25|$|Some of the sub-carriers {{in some of}} the OFDM symbols {{may carry}} pilot signals for {{measurement}} of the channel conditions (i.e., the equalizer gain and phase shift for each sub-carrier). Pilot signals and training symbols (preambles) may also be used for time synchronization (to avoid <b>intersymbol</b> <b>interference,</b> ISI) and frequency synchronization (to avoid inter-carrier interference, ICI, caused by Doppler shift).|$|E
25|$|A simple example: If one sends {{a million}} symbols per second using {{conventional}} single-carrier modulation over a wireless channel, then {{the duration of}} each symbol would be one microsecond or less. This imposes severe constraints on synchronization and necessitates the removal of multipath interference. If the same million symbols per second are spread among one thousand sub-channels, the duration of each symbol can be longer {{by a factor of}} a thousand (i.e., one millisecond) for orthogonality with approximately the same bandwidth. Assume that a guard interval of 1/8 of the symbol length is inserted between each symbol. <b>Intersymbol</b> <b>interference</b> can be avoided if the multipath time-spreading (the time between the reception of the first and the last echo) is shorter than the guard interval (i.e., 125 microseconds). This corresponds to a maximum difference of 37.5 kilometers between the lengths of the paths.|$|E

25|$|The primary {{advantage}} of OFDM over single-carrier schemes {{is its ability}} to cope with severe channel conditions (for example, attenuation of high frequencies in a long copper wire, narrowband interference and frequency-selective fading due to multipath) without complex equalization filters. Channel equalization is simplified because OFDM may be viewed as using many slowly modulated narrowband signals rather than one rapidly modulated wideband signal. The low symbol rate makes the use of a guard interval between symbols affordable, making it possible to eliminate <b>intersymbol</b> <b>interference</b> (ISI) and utilize echoes and time-spreading (on analogue TV these are visible as ghosting and blurring, respectively) to achieve a diversity gain, i.e. a signal-to-noise ratio improvement. This mechanism also facilitates the design of single frequency networks (SFNs), where several adjacent transmitters send the same signal simultaneously at the same frequency, as the signals from multiple distant transmitters may be combined constructively, rather than interfering as would typically occur in a traditional single-carrier system.|$|E

It is to make the radio receiver aware of its environment and able to take decision to turn on or off the equalizer according to its necessity or not. When the equalizer is off, the computational complexity is reduced and the rate of reduction depends on the percentage of time during which this component is disabled. In order to achieve this scenario of adapting the use of the equalizer, we need to develop a decision-making technique that provides the receiver with the capacities of awareness and adaptability to the state of its environment. For this, we improve a technique based on a statistical modeling of the environment by defining two metrics as channel quality indicators to evaluate the effect of the <b>intersymbol</b> <b>interferences</b> and the channel fading.

40|$|Abstract—Several current {{applications}} {{related to}} signal compression and representation and high-speed transmission require very selective filter banks/transmultiplexers. A possible {{solution is to}} employ the cosine-modulated filter banks/transmultiplexers (CMFBTs) where the prototype filters satisfy demanding constraints with respect to both the total stopband energy and maximum stopband ripple. This work proposes an efficient procedure to design nearly-perfect reconstruction CMFBT prototype filters with peak-constrained least-squares characteristics using a modified weighted least-squares algorithm. Substantial flexibility is added {{in the design of}} the magnitude response of the prototype filter, ranging from minimum stopband energy to minimum stopband ripple, which may be required in many applications. Some constraints are imposed to the CMFBTs in order to control the direct transfer and aliasing distortion functions, related to the intercarrier and <b>intersymbol</b> <b>interferences.</b> Algebraic simplifications are also provided on the overall objective function and associated constraints, leading to substantial reduction on the computational burden of the optimization process. The procedure is proven to be very powerful in designing CMFBT systems satisfying multiple constraints as indicated by numerical examples.
