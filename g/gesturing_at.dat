5|$|The {{positioning}} of these figures closely {{resembles that of}} two persons depicted in the van Eyck panel. In that painting the right-hand figure turns to face his companion, <b>gesturing</b> <b>at</b> him to look outwards. In the van der Weyden, the equivalent figure seems protective of his friend, who here is female, while the left-hand figure in the earlier panel might represent {{a tribute to the}} artist's brother Hubert who had died in the 1420s. A red headdress was an indicator of self-portraiture for van Eyck. As in the van Eyck, the figures act as examples of repoussoir, in that they draw our attention to the picture's underlying theme – the painting's ability to visualize the infinity of the world in the landscape. The painting may allude to the concept of paragone; the man points to the landscape, perhaps highlighting the ability of painting, unlike sculpture, to supply its foreground with background.|$|E

The Wasp discovers the plan and begs Pym to stop, whereupon he strikes her. Jim Shooter, the writer of this story, says he intended only that Pym accidentally strike her while <b>gesturing</b> <b>at</b> her dismissively, and that artist Bob Hall misinterpreted. Pym is subsequently expelled from the Avengers, and Janet divorces him.|$|E

25|$|As {{the fourth}} day's play started with India still 20 runs behind with just 6 wickets {{in hand and}} two full days of play left, another convincing win for Australia looked inevitable. However, what transpired on Day 4 etched the names of Laxman and Dravid in history forever. Laxman and Dravid batted out the entire day without getting dismissed. Steve Waugh used 9 bowlers, but Laxman and Dravid kept McGrath-Warne and company at bay and scored at will, {{completely}} dominating the bowling. India's score which was 254/4 {{at the start of}} the day's play read 589/4 at the end of the day's play. The duo added 335 runs on day 4 tumbling many records on the way. Dravid, having been under severe criticism for his previous failures in the series, celebrated his hundred in an uncharacteristic fashion <b>gesturing</b> <b>at</b> the press box. He remained unbeaten at 155 and Laxman at 276 at the end of the day's play.|$|E
