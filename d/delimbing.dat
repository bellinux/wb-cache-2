40|$|The {{present study}} aims to {{evaluate}} the competitiveness of various supply systems of small-diameter wood harvested from young stands for fuel. Trees were harvested for the cost comparison either as (i) <b>delimbed</b> longwood or (ii) as whole trees or (iii) the harvesting was based on bundle-harvesting using the Fixteri II bundle harvester. The felling of whole trees and <b>delimbed</b> longwood was carried out using a conventional harvester head equipped with multi-tree-handling accessories. Forwarding was carried out using a standard medium-sized forwarder. The comparison of procurement costs was done at stand level {{as a function of}} breast height diameter (5 - 13 cm) and on-road transportation distance (5 - 160 km). The harvested wood was chipped either at a roadside landing or at a terminal using a trailer-mounted drum chipper. The comparison of the supply systems was done using recently published productivity parameters and data obtained from complementary field studies. According to the cost assessment, whole-tree harvesting and chipping at the roadside landing was almost invariably the most cost-efficient supply system. The cost of whole-tree and <b>delimbed</b> longwood chips was at the same level when the breast height diameter of the harvested trees was 11 cm (pine) or more. The felling of whole trees is cheaper, but the cost difference diminished as a function of tree size. The productivity of forwarding, transportation and chipping of <b>delimbed</b> longwood was significantly higher compared to that of whole trees. When applying roadside chipping in Finnish conditions with small and sparsely located forest holdings, acquiring large enough concentrations of wood for profitable production is a great challenge. Machine relocations can be reduced by transporting raw material to terminals or the end-use facility to be chipped. However, the low bulk density of the initial material restricts the operation radius unless the wood biomass is pre-processed. According to the results of our study, harvesting of <b>delimbed</b> energy wood is a promising way to simplify operations and to reduce transportation and chipping costs. In the case of whole-tree bundling, savings in transportation and chipping costs did not offset the high felling and compaction costs, and the bundling system was the least competitive alternative...|$|R
50|$|A {{harvester}} {{is a type}} {{of heavy}} forestry vehicle employed in cut-to-length logging operations for felling, <b>delimbing</b> and bucking trees. A forest harvester is typically employed together with a forwarder that hauls the logs to a roadside landing.|$|E

50|$|Cut-to-length logging (CTL) is a {{mechanized}} {{harvesting system}} in which trees are delimbed and cut to length directly at the stump. CTL is typically a two-man, two-machine operation with a harvester felling, <b>delimbing,</b> and bucking trees and a forwarder transporting the logs from the felling to a landing area close to a road accessible by trucks.|$|E
50|$|Trees are felled {{and then}} <b>delimbed</b> and topped at the stump. The log is then {{transported to the}} landing, where it is bucked and loaded on a truck. This leaves the slash (and the {{nutrients}} it contains) in the cut area, where it must be further treated if wild land fires are of concern.|$|R
5000|$|Around year 10-60 the {{plantation}} is now mature and (in economic terms) is {{falling off the}} back side of its growth curve. That is to say, it is passing the point of maximum wood growth per hectare per year, and so is ready for the final harvest. All remaining trees are felled, <b>delimbed,</b> and taken to be processed.|$|R
50|$|Bucking is {{the process}} of cutting a felled and <b>delimbed</b> tree into logs. This can be a {{complicated}} process because logs destined for plywood, lumber, and pulp each have their own price and specifications for length, diameter, and defects. Significant value can be lost by sub-optimal bucking. Cutting from the top down is overbucking and from the bottom up is underbucking.|$|R
50|$|When {{the tree}} is lying on the ground, {{branches}} may be storing enormous potential energy through mechanical strain. When a branch is cut, often with a chain saw, this energy can be released suddenly and the branch can jump dangerously. In addition, a branch may be supporting the tree, and the tree can fall or roll when the branch is cut. For these reasons, <b>delimbing</b> is a skilled operation requiring careful safety planning.|$|E
50|$|Feller is a {{traditional}} name for someone who cuts down trees, and bunching is the skidding and assembly {{of two or more}} trees. A feller buncher performs both of these harvesting functions and consists of a standard heavy equipment base with a tree-grabbing device furnished with a chain-saw, circular saw or a shear—a pinching device designed to cut small trees off at the base. The machine then places the cut tree on a stack suitable for a skidder or forwarder, or other means of transport (yarding) for further processing (e.g., <b>delimbing,</b> bucking, loading, or chipping).|$|E
50|$|Cut-to-length logging is {{the process}} of felling, <b>delimbing,</b> bucking, and sorting (pulpwood, sawlog, etc.) at the stump area, leaving limbs and tops in the forest. Harvesters fell the tree, delimb, and buck it, and place the {{resulting}} logs in bunks to be brought to the landing by a skidder or forwarder. This method is routinely available for trees up to 900 mm in diameter. Harvesters are employed effectively in level to moderately steep terrain. Harvesters are highly computerized to optimize cutting length, control harvesting area by GPS, and utilize price lists for each specific log to archive most economical results during harvesting.|$|E
40|$|Although {{based on}} limited {{empirical}} data, concerns {{have been raised}} that increased nutrient removals associated with full-tree harvesting on shallow-soiled sites may result in reduced productivity in subsequent rotations. The objective of this study, therefore, was to compare and contrast the soil nutrient status and early stand development that resulted {{from a range of}} harvest intensities (i. e., a gradient of biomass and nutrient removals), including a full-tree harvest treatment, to determine if such treatments did result in reduced site productivity. The sites (3) selected for the study were mature, fire-origin, black spruce-dominated stands with well-drained, shallow-to-bedrock (< 20 cm of mineral soil overtopped by a moderately thin Fibrimor humus layer), coarse loamy soils. Experimental harvests were conducted in 1995 that consisted of five, replicated (3) treatments: uncut (UC), tree-length (TL) [...] <b>delimbed</b> at the stump, full-tree chipping (FTC) [...] chipped debris was returned to the harvested plot, full-tree (FTH) [...] <b>delimbed</b> at roadside, whole-tree (WTH) [...] complete removal of vegetation and forest floor...|$|R
40|$|The authors {{tested a}} chipper {{prototype}} adopting a new comminution device, designed to produce high quality chips when processing <b>delimbed</b> logs. The machine was fitted with innovative tubular blades, {{mounted on a}} flywheel. The prototype was powered by a 55 kW farm tractor through the standard power take-off. The machine appeared as efficient as most conventional disc or drum chippers in the same size class, but offered a much better chip quality. Chips were free from any particles longer than 45 mm, and with a very limited content of fine particles (max. 2. 5 %). Of course, this was achieved when using premium wood raw material, such as <b>delimbed</b> small logs. Performance varied with tree species: poplar was the softest and easiest to chip, whereas robinia was the hardest and required a much larger effort. Diesel fuel consumption varied between 3. 4 and 4. 3 dm 3 per oven-dry tonne. © 2012 Elsevier B. V...|$|R
50|$|Trees {{and plants}} are felled and {{transported to the}} {{roadside}} with top and limbs intact.There have been advancements to the process which now allows a logger or harvester to cut the tree down, top, and <b>delimb</b> a tree in the same process. This ability {{is due to the}} advancement in the style felling head that can be used. The trees are then <b>delimbed,</b> topped, and bucked at the landing. This method requires that slash be treated at the landing. In areas with access to cogeneration facilities, the slash can be chipped and used for the production of electricity or heat. Full-tree harvesting also refers to utilization of the entire tree including branches and tops. This technique removes both nutrients and soil cover from the site and so can be harmful to the long term health of the area if no further action is taken, however, depending on the species, many of the limbs are often broken off in handling so the end result may not be as different from tree-length logging as it might seem.|$|R
50|$|All of {{this can}} be {{controlled}} by one operator sitting in the cab of the vehicle. A control computer can simplify mechanical movements and can keep records of the length and diameter of trees cut. Length is computed by either counting the rotations of the gripping wheels or, more commonly, using the measuring wheel. Diameter is computed from the pivot angle of the gripping wheels or <b>delimbing</b> knives when hugging the tree. Length measurement also can be used for automated cutting of the tree into predefined lengths. Computer software can predict the volume of each stem based on analysing stems harvested previously. This information when used in conjunction with price lists for each specific log specification enables the optimisation of log recovery from the stem.|$|E
5000|$|Chainsaws, harvesters, and feller bunchers are {{now used}} to cut or fell trees. The tree is turned into logs by {{removing}} the limbs (<b>delimbing)</b> and cutting it into logs of optimal length (bucking). The felled tree or logs are moved from the stump to the landing. Ground vehicles such as a skidder or forwarder can pull, carry, or shovel the logs. Cable systems [...] "cars" [...] can pull logs to the landing. Logs can also be flown to the landing by helicopter. Logs are commonly transported to the sawmill using trucks. Harvesting methods may include clear cutting or selective cutting. Concerns over the environmental impact have led to controversy about modern logging practices. In certain areas of forest loggers re-plant their crop for future generations.|$|E
50|$|Other {{machines}} were also introduced during this period. The first feller buncher {{was used by}} the Quebec North Shore Paper Company in 1957. Hydraulic tree shears were first used in 1966 by the Abitibi Pulp and Paper Company Limited (Abitibi-Consolidated). Snowmobiles and tracked machines replaced animals for the hauling of logs. In 1948 several Bombardier {{machines were}} employed to this end by the Ste. Anne Power Company Limited in Quebec. In 1959 Timberland Machines of Woodstock, Ontario developed the Timberbuncher, a self-propelled machine which could move through the forest, cut a whole tree at its base (a process known as full tree harvesting) and, using a hydraulic arm, place it into a pile for hauling. Machines that stripped the branches from felled trees, a process known as <b>delimbing,</b> were also introduced at this time.|$|E
50|$|Before modern {{harvesters}} {{were developed}} in Finland and Sweden, two inventors from Texas developed a crude tracked unit that sheared off trees at the base up to 30 inches in diameter {{was developed in the}} US called The Mammoth Tree Shears. After shearing off the tree, the operator could use his controls to cause the tree to fall either to the right or left. Unlike a harvester, it did not <b>delimb</b> the tree after felling it.|$|R
40|$|The {{main purpose}} of this study is to {{investigate}} the productivity effects of multiple tree handling in thinnings. Other important elements have been to investigate in which extent multi-tree handling is used in stands with different stem volumes and the impact of collecting partially <b>delimbed</b> fuelwood assortments has on harvesting performance. The study is based on data from thinnings in Sydved and contractors' operating activities. Collection and compilation of operating schedules, number of stems and surveyed volumes from several contractors and a large number of executed orders underlying the results. Multiple tree handling is used to a much greater extent at lower average stem volumes. Prediction models for productivity of the multiple-tree handling harvesters in the study differ from the productivity models for single-tree handling. In the model developed in this study productivity is not as dependent of stem volume as reference models. Productivity varies greatly between different machines and drivers, which in itself can be a basis to approach the training of drivers. Collection of fuelwood assortments that only needs to be partially <b>delimbed</b> have a certain positive impact on both the proportion of multi managed trees and productivity...|$|R
40|$|This {{study was}} aimed at {{determining}} the maximum cost level of artificial drying required for cost-efficient operation. This was done using a system analysis approach, in which the harvesting potential and procurement cost of alternative fuel chip production systems were compared at the stand and regional level. The accumulation and procurement cost of chipped <b>delimbed</b> stems from young forests were estimated within a 100 km transport distance from a hypothetical end use facility located in northern Finland. Logging and transportation costs, stumpage prices, tied up capital, dry matter losses and moisture content of harvested timber were considered in the study. Moisture content of artificially dried fuel chips made of fresh timber (55 %) was set to 20 %, 30 % and 40 % in the comparisons. Moisture content of fuel chips based on natural drying during storing was 40 %. Transporting costs were calculated according to new higher permissible dimensions and weight limits for truck-trailers. The procurement cost calculations indicated that with artificial drying and by avoiding dry material losses of timber, it could be possible to reduce current costs of the prevailing procurement system based on natural drying of timber at roadside landings. The maximum cost level of artificial drying ranged between 1. 2 – 3. 2 € MWh– 1 depending on the supply chain, moisture content and procurement volume of fuel chips. This cost margin corresponds to, e. g., organization, forwarding and transportation costs or stumpage price of <b>delimbed</b> stems...|$|R

Pinomäki coined the term [...] "harvester" [...] to describe his Model 75 machine, which differs from a tree length processor in that a harvester grips, fells, de-limbs and sections the tree on site, while a processor simply de-limbs a tree that has been felled by chain saws and dragged to the <b>delimbing</b> equipment. His designs and innovations have been subsequently copied by at least five other major manufacturers of heavy timber equipment, including Timberjack, Valmet and Ponsse, and were instrumental in developing the [...] "Scandinavian" [...] system of timber harvesting, which is far more sustainable and nature conserving than the methods employed up till the mid-20th century.

The reduced cost of flail/chipping would’not cover the additional cost of <b>delimbing</b> with the machine mix tested, but changes to equipment might improve the situation. In the test configuration, the delimber processed 175 trees per productive hour, about half as many as the DDC. <b>Delimbing</b> separated about 35 dry pounds per tree of limbs, which may have higher value than the mixture of limb and bark residues produced by the flail from whole trees...|$|E
30|$|Underestimation of the {{duration}} of a harvester work cycle, measured by the cumulative timing PSION method in thinned stands, was due to underestimation of {{the duration}} of {{nearly all of the}} activity categories (Table 3).

In the clear-cutting operation, {{the duration of}} <b>delimbing</b> and bucking activities was 5.3  s as determined by the cumulative timing PSION method in comparison with 26.2  s as determined by the cumulative VIDEO method. Large differences between timing methods were also observed for the duration of felling/pulling a tree onto a machine (cf. 4.1 and 19.3  s for CT VIDEO and CT PSION, respectively).

40|$|A field-based {{study was}} {{performed}} to broaden our knowledge of operational efficiency losses associated with the neglect of the proper maintenance of the <b>delimbing</b> and feeding mechanisms of a harvester. The post-harvest assessments of industrial round-wood (IRW) processing damage, fuel consumption and productivity were examined in clearcutting operations. Observations were made of seven combinations of wear levels of feed rollers (A—heavy, B—medium, C and C’—without wear) and sharpening states of <b>delimbing</b> knives (1 —incorrect, 2 —correct), depending {{on the degree of}} feed roller wear and matching of angles of knife blades to the technical requirements. The processing defects of IRW were broken down into unprocessed branches, bark stripping, and damage caused by feed roller spikes. The results were then compared with the effective quality requirements, and the IRW losses in terms of the reject rates (RR) were determined {{in the context of the}} technical condition. The most frequent damage was by unprocessed branches. The harvester with correctly sharpened knives produced the minimum RR (4 % of pine, 6 % of spruce and 6 % birch logs). The quality of IRW harvested under B 1 and C 1 resulted in 6 %, 6 % and 8 %. A 1 turned out to be the lowest (12 %, 10 % and 8 %). Improvement in the maintenance of <b>delimbing</b> knives can reduce the RR of IRW by 5 %.

5000|$|After {{the canopy}} closes, with the tree crowns {{touching}} each other, the plantation is becoming dense and crowded, and tree growth is slowing due to competition. This stage is termed 'pole stage'. When competition becomes too intense (for pine trees, when the live crown {{is less than}} a third of the tree's total height), it is time to thin out the section. There are several methods for thinning, but where topography permits, the most popular is 'row-thinning', where every third or fourth or fifth row of trees is removed, usually with a harvester. Many trees are removed, leaving regular clear lanes through the section so that the remaining trees have room to expand again. The removed trees are <b>delimbed,</b> forwarded to the forest road, loaded onto trucks, and sent to a mill. A typical pole stage plantation tree is 7-30 cm in diameter at breast height (dbh). Such trees are sometimes not suitable for timber, but are used as pulp for paper and particleboard, and as chips for oriented strand board.|$|R
40|$|The {{demand for}} {{renewable}} energy is increasing in Sweden. This consequently increases the pressure for and willingness to pay for forest fuels. One method to extract forest fuel from suitable commercial thinnings is the "long top method” (LT-method). With this method saw logs and non-delimbed tops are recovered, i. e. no pulpwood is recovered. Branches from <b>delimbed</b> sawlogs are not recovered and only long top (with branches and needles still attached) is hauled the landing site. To optimize income from the LT-method knowledge about the share of recovery of respectively saw logs and fuel wood at different stand conditions and top diameters are needed. The {{purpose of this study}} was to develop a decision support for the LT thinning method in Västerbotten and make an assumption of the outcome at stand level and the proportions of biomass in stem, branch and needles. Thinning outlet was 35 % of basal area. Four types of forests were formed for two regions in Västerbotten, Lapland and the coastal region. The forest types were pine, spruce, coniferous and mixed forests. Forest data (test area with associated sample tree) were retrieved from the national forest surveys database and then processed. Forests in need of commercial thinning were sorted out (average dbh 19 cm). Forest functions were compiled, a model was established and implemented to Microsoft Excel. The model estimates the outcome of non <b>delimbed</b> wooden parts per region and for each forest type at three different top diameters for saw logs; 10, 12 and 14 cm. A decision support for energy-suited thinning has been developed. Among the forest types the mixed forest yield the highest outcome in this type of thinning in both regions, in the coastal region between 25 and 29 tonnes dry matter/ha and in Lapland between 22 and 24 tonnes/ha depending on the diameter of the top saw log. The second largest outcome at the theoretical thinning were spruce forests and the coniferous forests in Lapland, these were calculated to an outcome between 10 and 17 tonnes dry matter/ha. The largest difference in percent between the coastal region and Lapland was in pine and coniferous forests located in the coastal area which had approximately 30 % lower outcome. This work can be used for prediction of biomass outcome under different conditions in Västerbotten, and consequently for optimization of income. The model should further be developed to cover, and be valid, in all regions of Sweden...|$|R
