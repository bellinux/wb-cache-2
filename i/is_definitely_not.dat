It {{is interesting to note}} that the Hortaya Borzaya, undoubtedly a very close relative, is traditionally raised on a meager diet of oats and table scraps. The Hortaya is also said to be intolerant of highly concentrated kibble feeds.

25|$|There {{were few}} health care {{facilities}} other than local General Practitioner surgeries within the Municipality of Clarence prior to the Tasman Bridge Disaster. The isolation caused by the severing of the bridge, and the inability of patients to travel across the river for treatment highlighted the need for local health care services on the eastern shore. The Bayfield Healthcare Centre (now known as the Clarence Community Health Centre) was developed at considerable cost to the state government, but soon became the City's primary health care provider. Whilst it <b>is</b> <b>definitely</b> <b>not</b> {{large enough to be}} considered a hospital, recent upgrading has seen the centre fall into the super clinic category.|$|E
25|$|Concerning {{the human}} soul, his {{epistemological}} theory required that, since the knower becomes what he knows, the soul <b>is</b> <b>definitely</b> <b>not</b> corporeal—if it is corporeal when it knows what some corporeal thing is, that thing {{would come to}} be within it. Therefore, the soul has an operation which does not rely on a body organ, and therefore the soul can exist without a body. Furthermore, since the rational soul of human beings is a subsistent form and not something made of matter and form, it cannot be destroyed in any natural process. The full argument for the immortality of the soul and Aquinas' elaboration of Aristotelian theory is found in Question 75 of the First Part of the Summa Theologica.|$|E
25|$|NATO’s {{success in}} the area was {{due in part to}} the {{cooperation}} of other foreign states with interests in the reason.

With NATO promoting co-operation amongst these foreign entities, Operation Ocean Shield could effectively protect the area. They also developed this innovative electronic network called Mercury which shared anti-piracy tactics with other task forces and operations.

[...] Ann Marlowe called the film [...] "the most neo-con movie ever made" [...] for its [...] "deeply conservative, pro-American message". [...] But Cameron {{admitted}} to some ambiguity on the issue, agreeing that [...] "the bad guys could be America in this movie, or the good guys could be America in this movie, depending on your perspective", and stated that Avatars defeat at the Academy Awards might {{have been due to}} the perceived anti-U.S. theme in it.|$|E

[...] However, analysts in the gymnastics community, including University of Georgia head coach Suzanne Yoculan, former Olympian John Roethlisberger and International Gymnast editor Paul Ziert, noted that the American team started the competition at a difficult point deficit to the Chinese and that mathematically, Sacramone could not have been personally or exclusively responsible for the U.S. team's results. Teammate Bridget Sloan also said in an interview, [...] "We've all made mistakes. It's just really hard to see her go and leave these Olympics knowing that she thinks it's her fault.

Waters joked, [...] "Turning it in the day Batman Forever opened {{may not have been}} my best logistical move, in that it's the celebration of the fun-for-the-whole-family Batman.

[...] In an August 1995 interview, Pfeiffer re-iterated her interest in the spin-off, but explained her priorities would be challenged as a mother and commitments to other projects. The film labored in development hell for years, with Pfeiffer replaced by Ashley Judd. The film ended up becoming the critically panned Catwoman (2004), starring Halle Berry.|$|E

500|$|The {{casting process}} {{continued}} into much of 2010, with the additions of Jeremy Renner, Mark Ruffalo, and Clark Gregg. Ruffalo replaced Edward Norton, whom Marvel declined to have back. [...] "We {{have made the}} decision to not bring Ed Norton back to portray the title role of Bruce Banner in The Avengers," [...] stated Feige. [...] "Our decision <b>is</b> <b>definitely</b> <b>not</b> one based on monetary factors, but instead rooted in the need for an actor who embodies the creativity and collaborative spirit of our other talented cast members. The Avengers demands players who thrive working as part of an ensemble, as evidenced by Robert, Chris H, Chris E, Samuel, Scarlett, and all of our talented casts. We are looking to announce a name actor who fulfills these requirements, and is passionate about the iconic role in the coming weeks." [...] In response, Norton's agent Brian Swardstrom decried Feige's statement, calling it [...] "purposefully misleading" [...] and an [...] "inappropriate attempt to paint our client in a negative light". In October 2014, Norton claimed it was his own decision never to play Hulk again because he [...] "wanted more diversity" [...] with his career, {{and did not want to}} be associated with only one character.|$|E

500|$|West {{collaborated with}} American film score {{composer}} Jon Brion, {{who served as}} the album's co-executive producer for several tracks. West had been exposed to Brion's work while watching the film Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind, for which Brion had composed music. West was also listening to songs Brion had produced for When the Pawn..., the second studio album of alternative singer-songwriter Fiona Apple, another one of West's favorite musicians and sources of musical inspiration for the album. Although Brion had no prior experience in creating hip-hop records, he and West found that they could productively work together after their first afternoon in the studio where they discovered that neither confined his musical knowledge and vision to one specific genre. When questioned if his presence made Late Registration any less hip-hop, Brion replied, [...] "There are colors and ideas that make [...] different from average hip-hop, but Kanye is already different from the average hip-hop guy. He's got this sense of pop record-making which is really solid, and he likes tracks with {{a lot of things going}} on in them — which is not necessarily common for hip-hop. He was already barking up that tree. This <b>is</b> <b>definitely</b> <b>not</b> just a hip-hop album. But it is also by no means overtly arty, or non-hip-hop. I don't think it's a weird record by any means." ...|$|E
500|$|In contrast, Tom Shales for The Washington Post criticized Morrison as Will, writing: [...] "Morrison <b>is</b> <b>definitely</b> <b>not</b> gleeful and doesn't seem {{particularly}} well equipped to be a high-school impresario; as pipers go, he's not even marginally pied." [...] Shales was more positive regarding Lynch's performance, and concluded that: [...] "Dramatic tension isn't exactly plentiful, but pleasingly staged songs {{and a general}} aura of retro ingenuousness come through, and seem awfully if fitfully refreshing". Variety Brian Lowry also highlighted acting and characterization issues with the show, writing that: [...] "It's among the adults, alas – who are mostly over-the-top buffoons – where Glee nearly sails off the rails, from Jane Lynch's tyrannical cheer matron to the salivating football coach, {{a bit like the}} Rydell High gang in Grease." [...] Lowry felt that: [...] "Modest redemption comes from the stammering Emma (Heroes Jayma Mays), who has a clear crush on Will, even though he's married to his high-school sweetheart. Perhaps to foster a rooting interest (or at least sympathy) for a Will-Emma pairing, said wife (Jessalyn Gilsig) is initially presented as a ditsy shrew." [...] Mary McNamara for the Los Angeles Times has called Glee: [...] "the first show in a long time that's just plain full-throttle, no-guilty-pleasure-rationalizations-necessary fun." [...] She praised Lynch as Sue, writing that [...] "Lynch alone makes Glee worth watching", and claimed that overall: [...] "The music, though by no means edgy, is energetic with a wide audience appeal, like the show itself.|$|E
500|$|By default, Aurora {{is usually}} {{considered}} to be the film's main character. Leigh Butler of Tor.com argues that the role of [...] "protagonist" [...] rightfully belongs to the three good fairies because they [...] "make all the critical decisions in the film, the ones which drive the action", while Aurora acts {{as little more than a}} pawn. Butler expounded that Aurora [...] "never grows as a character during the course of the film; she has no agency at all, in fact. She doesn’t act; she is acted upon. So she <b>is</b> <b>definitely</b> <b>not</b> the hero of the story." [...] Helping Writers Become Authors' K. M. Weiland agreed, writing, [...] "Sleeping Beauty has no arc. Prince Phillip has no arc. And, even more importantly, neither of them are present from start to finish in the story. Without the fairies to hold this thing together, the plot would have lacked any kind of impetus or cohesion." [...] Upon initial viewing of Sleeping Beauty, a writer for Anibundel originally dismissed Aurora as [...] "the ultimate Disney princess in the most negative and passive sense of the stereotype ... playing no part whatsoever in her own outcome." [...] However, in retrospect, the author's opinion eventually evolved upon subsequent viewings: [...] "Although Aurora has little to do with her own conclusion, it’s not a mark of her being a non-person. Instead it reflects how sometimes bad things just happen which we have no control over, a difficult but important lesson." [...] Anibundel does agree that although Aurora is Sleeping Beautys title character, she can hardly be considered the film's protagonist, instead believing instead that the film actually lacks one completely. Meanwhile, the author dubbed Aurora the film's most sympathetic character because she has [...] "thoughts, feelings, aspirations, and emotions," [...] elaborating, [...] "While most characters ... are overly focused on the plot and reacting to events, Briar Rose is unaware of the other events so we get to see a more authentic everyday side of her." [...] In his book Multiculturalism and the Mouse: Race and Sex in Disney Entertainment, author Douglas Brode wrote that the fairies' raising of Aurora mirrors [...] "precisely that sort of women's commune numerous feminists experimented with throughout the seventies." ...|$|E
