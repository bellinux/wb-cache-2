Becoming <b>human</b> <b>means</b> to have a soul, a Solar Astral Body, Solar Mental Body and Solar Causal Body. These bodies are constructed through a form of Tantra called White tantrism.|$|E

500|$|The Independent {{said that}} Insurrection [...] "never stops being familiarly jolly and antiquated", {{and called the}} entire Star Trek film {{franchise}} [...] "old-fashioned". The Washington Post also called the film old fashioned, but [...] "in the best sense of the word", {{and said that the}} film did what the [...] "doctor – make that Dr. 'Bones' McCoy – ordered". British journalist Simon Rose, writing for The Daily Mirror was more critical of the film, saying that it failed to break the odd-numbered Star Trek film curse, and that it was [...] "feeble", [...] "moribund" [...] and [...] "tedious". However, Josh Spiegel writing for The Buffalo News said that Insurrection broke the odd-numbered film rule. Further criticism came from the Birmingham Evening Mail, which said that it was [...] "an adult form of entertainment equivalent to Teletubbies for babies", and that there were [...] "lots of repetition, rubbery faces, gibberish dialogue, characters leaping up and down in funny suits and some very basic effects". The reviewer gave the film two stars for fans, and none for non-fans. In Folklore/Cinema: Popular Film as Vernacular Culture, the actions of Data and the Ba'ku child Artim in Insurrection are seen as [...] "a metamorphosis motif where a child becomes computerlike and a computer/android becomes more childlike". Data specifically [...] "is a metaphor for a child who seeks to understand what being <b>human</b> <b>means</b> and then, like the velveteen rabbit, wishes to become. From confronting his father and evil brother to finding his mother, Data also represents the potential within all of us to quest for a fuller humanity".|$|E
2500|$|The [...] "Dandy horse", {{also called}} Draisienne or Laufmaschine, {{was the first}} <b>human</b> <b>means</b> of {{transport}} to use only two wheels in tandem and was invented by the German Baron Karl von Drais.

Its rider sat astride a wooden frame supported by two in-line wheels and pushed the vehicle along with his or her feet while steering the front wheel.|$|E
