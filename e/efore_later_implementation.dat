40|$|Background: Abortion was legalized in Nepal in 2002, {{following}} advocacy efforts highlighting high {{maternal mortality}} from unsafe abortion. We sought {{to assess whether}} legalization led to reductions in the most serious maternal health consequences of unsafe abortion. Methods: We conducted retrospective medical chart review of all gynecological cases presenting at four large public referral hospitals in Nepal. For the years 2001 – 2010, all cases of spontaneous and induced abortion complications were identified, abstracted, and coded to classify cases of serious infection, injury, and systemic complications. We used segmented Poisson and ordinary logistic regression to test for trend and risks of serious complications for three time periods: before implementation (2001 – 2003), early implementation (2004 – 2006), and <b>later</b> <b>implementation</b> (2007 – 2010). Results: 23, 493 cases of abortion complications were identified.

50|$|Novell's {{original}} NetWare {{client was}} written for DOS. Initial versions required a hard-linked protocol stack, where a separate executable would be created by the network administrator for each network card configuration on the network. This executable would be loaded at boot time, and remain resident in memory until the system was shut down. <b>Later</b> <b>implementations</b> allowed the network stack to be loaded and unloaded dynamically, using pre-existing modules. This greatly simplified maintenance of client workstations on the network.|$|R
50|$|<b>Later</b> <b>implementations</b> are {{marketed as}} Nitro MX Xtreme which adds {{proprietary}} frame-bursting, compression and point-to-point side session technology for a claimed 140 Mbit/s throughput transmission speed. The point-to-point side session technology, called DirectLink, creates {{a connection between}} clients or from a client to a media source, such as a media server, and avoids the access point. It does this while staying in 802.11 Infrastructure mode so the client can continue to utilize access point-based security and power-savings.|$|R
5000|$|InformRequest: Acknowledged {{asynchronous}} notification. This PDU {{was introduced}} in SNMPv2 and was originally defined as manager to manager communication. <b>Later</b> <b>implementations</b> have loosened the original definition to allow agent to manager communications. Manager-to-manager notifications were already possible in SNMPv1 (using a Trap), but as SNMP commonly runs over UDP where delivery is not assured and dropped packets are not reported, delivery of a Trap was not guaranteed. InformRequest fixes this by sending back an acknowledgement on receipt.|$|R
50|$|DSL {{implementations}} {{may create}} bridged or routed networks. In a bridged configuration, {{the group of}} subscriber computers effectively connect into a single subnet. The earliest implementations used DHCP to provide network details such as the IP address to the subscriber equipment, with authentication via MAC address or an assigned host name. <b>Later</b> <b>implementations</b> often use Point-to-Point Protocol (PPP) to authenticate with a user ID and password, and to provide network details (Point-to-Point Protocol over Ethernet (PPPoE) or Point-to-Point Protocol over ATM (PPPoA)).|$|R

The first implementations gave each ramp its own number, even when two ramps existed for two directions of a road; <b>later</b> <b>implementations</b> used directional suffixes, as in 15N/15S or 15E/15W; current U.S. and Canadian practice is to use 15A/15B. In France and Japan, decimals are used, as in 15.1 and 15.2.|$|R

The rear biased torque distribution reduces understeer, which occurs in AWD vehicles. VTD AWD uses a multi-plate clutch in conjunction with planetary gears in the center differential and a viscous coupling rear differential to distribute torque up to a 50:50 ratio. With the addition of VDC, all torque can be sent to a single wheel.|$|R
