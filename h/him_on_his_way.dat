5|$|Another local {{man called}} Tom Austin was hanged in August 1694. He {{inherited}} a farm {{with an annual}} income of £80 and then married {{the daughter of a}} neighbouring farmer with a dowry of £800. He lived an extravagant lifestyle and spent all of his money. His farm, having been neglected could not provide sufficient income for him and he borrowed a lot of money from neighbours and friends. He then turned to highway robbery and was moderately successful for a time. He shot Sir Zachary Wilmott during a robbery on the road between Wellington and Taunton. The proceeds from his crimes supported him for a time but in the long term he was unable to clear his debts. In 1694, following a row with his wife, he went to visit his uncle. His uncle was not at home and he killed his aunt and her five children and took around £60 from the house. On returning home he was asked about the bloodstains on his clothes by his wife. He then killed her and his two children. His uncle who dropped in to visit <b>him</b> <b>on</b> <b>his</b> <b>way</b> home knocked Tom Austin unconscious and he was arrested and later hung at Exeter Jail.|$|E
5|$|Hanada and Kasuga {{pick up a}} car {{designated}} for the job which unexpectedly has a corpse in the back seat. They dispose of the body, then meet the client and proceed towards their destination. En route Hanada spots an ambush. He dispatches a number of gunmen while Kasuga panics and flails about in hysterics. Foaming at the mouth, Kasuga charges an ambusher, Koh, the fourth-ranked hitman, and they kill each other. Hanada leaves the client to secure Koh's car but hears three gunshots and rushes back to find the client is safe and three additional ambushers have been shot cleanly through the forehead. At a second ambush, Hanada kills more gunmen and sets Sakura, the second-ranked hitman, on fire. Sakura madly rushes towards the client but is shot dead by <b>him.</b> <b>On</b> <b>his</b> <b>way</b> home Hanada's car breaks down. Misako, a mysterious woman with a deathwish, stops and gives him a ride. At home, he has rough sex with his wife, fueled by his obsession with sniffing boiling rice.|$|E

5|$|Themistocles {{first went}} to live in exile in Argos. However, perceiving that they now had a prime {{opportunity}} to bring Themistocles down for good, the Spartans again levelled accusations of Themistocles's complicity in Pausanias's treason. They demanded that he be tried by the 'Congress of Greeks', rather than in Athens, although it seems {{that in the end}} he was actually summoned to Athens to stand trial. Perhaps realising he had little hope of surviving this trial, Themistocles fled, first to Kerkyra, and thence to Admetus, king of Molossia. Themistocles's flight probably only served to convince his accusers of his guilt, and he was declared a traitor in Athens, his property to be confiscated. It should be noted that both Diodorus and Plutarch considered that the charges were false, and made solely for the purposes of destroying Themistocles. The Spartans sent ambassadors to Admetus, threatening that the whole of Greece would go to war with the Molossians unless they surrendered Themistocles. Admetus, however, allowed Themistocles to escape, giving him a large sum of gold to aid <b>him</b> <b>on</b> <b>his</b> <b>way.</b> Themistocles then fled from Greece, apparently never to return, thus effectively bringing his political career to an end.|$|E
5|$|In 1552 Dudley {{was made}} a Knight of the Garter; {{at the end of}} the year he was sent on a {{diplomatic}} mission to discuss Edward VI's hopes to mediate for peace between the Empire and France. He first travelled to Brussels, where he was received by Mary of Hungary on 8 January 1553. Impatient to see the Emperor himself, he tried to intercept <b>him</b> <b>on</b> <b>his</b> <b>way</b> to Flanders. Sir Richard Morrison, the English resident ambassador with Charles V, knew nothing of this until he met Dudley at Treves. The ailing ruler was averse to be molested by diplomats while journeying, nevertheless Morrison arranged an interview at Luxembourg in which Charles referred them to a later occasion. On 11 February 1553 the Emperor gave the Englishmen an audience at Brussels. When Dudley offered to kiss his hand, he embraced him. The visitors noted that the chamber was hung with tapestries depicting the Emperor's victories at Tunis. Charles V was non-committal, declaring that he was well-disposed to peace if he only could trust the French king. On returning to England Dudley had an audience with Edward on 19 February. Jehan Scheyfve, the Emperor's agent, reported that Dudley was discreet, and only mentioned that Charles had given him a present. The French ambassador in London was not pleased. Dudley was elected MP for Oxfordshire in the March parliament of 1553, carrying Edward's train at the proceedings.|$|E

60|$|To Griffiths, a vast {{impotence}} {{seemed to}} descend upon him. He {{was overwhelmed by}} a profound disgust--disgust for the sunlands and the sun-sickness, for the futility of all his endeavour, for this blue-eyed, golden-tinted, superior man who defeated <b>him</b> <b>on</b> all <b>his</b> <b>ways.</b>|$|R

There are no other witnesses, while the community members, including the victims, refuse to assist the police to incriminate the gang members.|$|E
25|$|Afridi {{was charged}} on 8 February 2007 of {{bringing}} the game into disrepute after he was seen on camera thrusting his bat at a spectator who swore at <b>him</b> <b>on</b> <b>his</b> <b>way</b> up the steps after being dismissed. Afridi was given a four-game ODI suspension, the minimum possible ban for such an offence, meaning that he would miss Pakistan's first two 2007 World Cup matches. The PCB and Afridi chose not to appeal the ban, despite feeling that the punishment was excessively harsh.|$|E
25|$|On 17 October Lishansky found {{refuge in}} Petah Tikva with friends of Aaron Aaronsohn's, {{but they were}} {{reluctant}} to hide him and after two days sent <b>him</b> <b>on</b> <b>his</b> <b>way.</b> He travelled south in hopes of crossing the border in the Sinai Peninsula and reaching British lines. On the night of 19-20 October, Lishansky attempted to steal a camel from Bedouins in the Shephelah region. He was caught and {{turned over to the}} Ottoman authorities. The Ottomans held and interrogated him in Ramla and Jerusalem, and after ten days in Jerusalem he was moved to Damascus.|$|E
60|$|This did not {{suit the}} Stranger at all. From {{what he had}} heard he felt quite sure that if {{he went to the}} museum, he would soon be in jail; and so he hurried to propose a plan which had {{occurred}} to <b>him</b> while <b>on</b> <b>his</b> <b>way</b> to the palace.|$|R

25|$|Constantine's last slender hope faded {{when his}} last troops {{guarding}} the Rhine abandoned him to support Jovinus {{and he was}} forced to surrender.

25|$|The Fool {{does not}} follow any ideology. He rejects all appearances, of law, justice, moral order. He sees brute force, cruelty and lust. He has no illusions and does not seek {{consolation}} {{in the existence of}} natural or supernatural order, which provides for the punishment of evil and the reward of good. Lear, insisting on his fictitious majesty, seems ridiculous to him. All the more ridiculous because he does not see how ridiculous he is. But the Fool does not desert his ridiculous, degraded king, and accompanies <b>him</b> <b>on</b> <b>his</b> <b>way</b> to madness. The Fool knows that the only true madness is to recognize this world as rational.|$|E
25|$|Hook {{was born}} in London, the son of James Hook, a draper and one time Judge of the Mixed Commission Court in Sierra Leone. His mother was the second {{daughter}} of Bible scholar Dr Adam Clarke - hence the painter's second name. Young Hook's first taste of the sea was on board the Berwick smacks which took <b>him</b> <b>on</b> <b>his</b> <b>way</b> to Wooler. He drew with rare facility, and determined to become an artist, practiced his work, on his own initiative, {{for more than a}} year in the sculpture galleries of the British Museum. Still in his youth, he also had some advice by John Jackson and John Constable.|$|E
25|$|Raymond J. Place first aroused the {{suspicion}} {{of law enforcement}} officers as {{he was standing in}} line at the Miami airport waiting to buy a ticket to New York's LaGuardia Airport. The officers approached <b>him</b> <b>on</b> <b>his</b> <b>way</b> to the gate and asked him for identification. Place also agreed to let the officers search the luggage he had checked, but they declined to do so in light of the flight's imminent departure. Discrepancies between the two luggage tags on Place's two suitcases further aroused the officers' suspicions, and they confirmed that the addresses were false. The Miami officers alerted DEA agents at LaGuardia to their suspicions about Place.|$|E
50|$|One of the subplots {{within this}} novel {{involves}} Arkady Renko's improbable reunion {{with the one}} great love of his life, Irina Asanova.

25|$|The Williamses {{pulled away}} from the McLarens who were pulling away from the Ferraris (Prost had by now passed Alesi). On lap 18, Patrese waved Mansell through and decided to follow him. The McLarens stopped first and Senna got ahead of Berger. When Mansell stopped on lap 29, his crew had trouble fixing the wheelnut of his right rear properly. As the Williams {{mechanic}} went to get a spare nut, the lollipop man, unaware of the trouble signalled for Mansell to depart. Immediately, his right rear fell off and he stopped {{in the middle of the}} pitlane. The team retrieved the tyre, fixed it on Mansell's car and sent <b>him</b> <b>on</b> <b>his</b> <b>way</b> but he had dropped to 17th.|$|E
25|$|He {{reached the}} port of Chittagong in modern-day Bangladesh {{intending}} to travel to Sylhet to meet Shah Jalal, who became so renowned that Ibn Battuta, then in Chittagong, made a one-month journey through the mountains of Kamaru near Sylhet to meet <b>him.</b> <b>On</b> <b>his</b> <b>way</b> to Sylhet, Ibn Battuta was greeted by several of Shah Jalal's disciples {{who had come to}} assist him on his journey many days before he had arrived. At the meeting in 1345 CE, Ibn Battuta noted that Shah Jalal was tall and lean, fair in complexion and lived by the mosque in a cave, where his only item of value was a goat he kept for milk, butter, and yogurt. He observed that the companions of the Shah Jalal were foreign and known for their strength and bravery. He also mentions that many people would visit the Shah to seek guidance. Ibn Battuta went further north into Assam, then turned around and continued with his original plan.|$|E
25|$|In 1345, Ibn Battuta {{travelled}} on to Samudra Pasai Sultanate {{in present-day}} Aceh, Northern Sumatra, where he {{notes in his}} travel log that the ruler of Samudra Pasai was a pious Muslim named Sultan Al-Malik Al-Zahir Jamal-ad-Din, who performed his religious duties with utmost zeal and often waged campaigns against animists in the region. The island of Sumatra, according to Ibn Battuta, was rich in camphor, areca nut, cloves, and tin. The madh'hab he observed was Imam Al-Shafi‘i, whose customs {{were similar to those}} he had previously seen in coastal India, especially among the Mappila Muslims, who were also followers of Imam Al-Shafi‘i. At that time Samudra Pasai marked the end of Dar al-Islam, because no territory east of this was ruled by a Muslim. Here he stayed for about two weeks in the wooden walled town as a guest of the sultan, and then the sultan provided him with supplies and sent <b>him</b> <b>on</b> <b>his</b> <b>way</b> on one of his own junks to China.|$|E

25|$|NBC's {{requests}} {{became more}} unreasonable and the O'Brien camp refused them, {{such as the}} right to pull any of his final shows if the network objected to the content (i.e., a joke about the conflict/NBC). Jeffrey Immelt, GE chairman, questioned why they were paying so much for a performer destined to run to another network. Negotiations continued on into O'Brien's final week; he could not confirm on-air it was indeed his final week of shows, which produced difficulty in booking the guests he desired for his final show. On January 19, multiple media outlets reported that O'Brien and NBC were close to signing a deal between US$30 and US$40 million for the host {{to walk away from the}} network. Following his Wednesday, January 20 edition, O'Brien remained at the studio until the early hours of the morning, alongside Ross and the legal counsel, trying to finalize the settlement. O'Brien wandered off, playing his guitar alone and stepping out on the deserted Universal lot at midnight, attempting to make sense of the situation. Meanwhile, Ron Meyer passingly suggested to Zucker and Gaspin, based off the public outcry, that they should stick with O'Brien; the two executives agreed to send <b>him</b> <b>on</b> <b>his</b> <b>way.</b> O'Brien signed the agreement that night and the following day the terms were made public.|$|E
