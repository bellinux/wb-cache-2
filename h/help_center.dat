According to U.S. national taxpayer advocate Nina Olsen in regards to FATCA: [...] "This {{is a piece of}} legislation that is so big and so far-reaching, and [...] so many different moving pieces, and is rolling out in an incremental fashion (...) that you really won’t be able to know what its consequences are, intended or otherwise,’ Olson said. [...] "I don’t think we’ll know that for years. And by that point we’ll actually be a little too late to go, [...] "Oops, my bad, we shouldn’t have done this,’ and then try to unwind it." [...] Bloomberg reported in 2015 that the IRS <b>help</b> <b>center</b> is not able to provide adequate taxpayer customer service. In 2016, the Taxpayer Advocate reported that [...] "FATCA implementation has created significant compliance burdens and risk exposures" [...] for overseas Americans, and its [...] "heavy-handed approach, especially when combined with the complexity surrounding IRS requirements, has negative consequences, both for FFIs and the IRS".|$|E
