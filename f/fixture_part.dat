40|$|Abstract: Deburring is a {{critical}} step {{in the manufacture of}} a machined part. The two-pass control concept of this paper removes burrs and produces a consistent chamfer, even with <b>fixture,</b> <b>part,</b> and robot errors. The approach requires a robot for gross positioning of the cutter and an around-the-arm end effector capable of measuring orthogonal force between cutter and workpiece, measuring cutter position with respect to end-effector frame of reference, and actively controlling the cutter-applied orthogonal force. In the first pass, compliance control (orthogonal to workpiece) removes burrs by programming the cutter to act as a low-pass filter on the burrs, where the cutter bandwidth is less than burr time-frequency content, while complying to the <b>fixture,</b> <b>part,</b> and robot errors. In the second pass, chamfer depth variations are smoothed out using chamfer control, where chamfer depth is controlled by computing an estimated real-time chamfer depth, and using this estimate in a feedback loop that varies the cutter-workpiece force to maintain a commanded chamfer depth. The chamfer depth estimator removes repeatable <b>fixture,</b> <b>part,</b> and robot errors by using cutter position measurements from the first pass. Cutting experiments on edges with burrs show that compliance control improved on the force control approach in compensating for burrs, and chamfer control was able to produce a consistent chamfer depth. Key Words: Deburring, active control, robotic...|$|E
40|$|AbstractOver {{the last}} decades, {{manufacturing}} {{market has been}} characterized by small batch size, high variability in the part types and part type demand, continuous evolution of the products. In order to quickly answer the new and changing production requirements, the rapid redesign of the pallet in terms of number of parts and part types and the verification of physical mounted pallet became essential. Thus, this paper aims at (i) developing a dynamic process planning approach automatically providing multi-part pallet designs and (ii) identifying flexible techniques for the inspection of the physical pallet before its machining. Specifically, the approach analyzes the solution space generated by all the possible combination of part type setups in terms of number and position on the pallet. The number of produced part types per pallet is maximized, while the setup accessibility and {{an equal number of}} part types for each setup are granted. The 3 D design of the pallet is compared with the scanned pallet cloud of points in order to identify possible error sources, e. g. part missing, incorrectly closed <b>fixture,</b> <b>part</b> type in wrong position. A test case will be provided in order to show the advantages deriving from the approach employment...|$|E

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study is to develop a {{database}} for checking <b>fixtures</b> for automotive <b>parts.</b> The parts used in the fixture checking process were automotive parts such as clamper, stand and toggle. The goal of this project is to implement a database of checking <b>fixtures</b> <b>parts.</b> The project started with identifying the current problems that were faced by the designer at a design department, in a support service for automotive industries. Idle time has been the major problem that designer have to faced. All the data and information related to this project has been sought and explored in the literature review. Catia software is used as the CAD software to construct threedimensional models for the design of all the parts in the parts library. All the parts are organized in three different sizes which are determined by the size of car body panel. Referring to the result, new libraries were developed and created using the Catia software to aid designers in the checking fixture design process. The validation of the new libraries had been conducted with the company’s design engineer to test the effectiveness, usability and relevancy. In summary, this database and method can potentially accelerate the checking fixtures design process to be faster and more efficient...|$|R
