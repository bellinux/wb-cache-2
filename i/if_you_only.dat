500|$|Postmodern {{cultural}} critic bell hooks {{cited the}} interaction in the Memphis train station between Thomas and the Japanese couple {{as one of}} the few examples of nuanced, deconstructive and subversive treatment of blackness in American film. In his original review for the Chicago Sun-Times, Roger Ebert proclaimed that [...] "he best thing about Mystery Train is that it takes you to an America you feel you ought to be able to find for yourself, <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>only</b> knew where to look." [...] He later included the movie in his Great Movies collection, comparing the movie favorably to Jarmusch's later efforts like Dead Man and The Limits of Control. In an April 2000 retrospective of Jarmusch's work for Sight & Sound, Shawn Levy concluded that the film was [...] "as much a valentine to the allure of the American way of pop culture as it is a cheeky bit of structural legerdemain without terribly much resonating significance".|$|E
500|$|Producer Daniel Lanois became disoriented {{with the}} {{direction}} U2 took [...] "Acrobat" [...] during its recording. Bono noted [...] "Daniel had {{such a hard time}} on that... {{he was trying to get}} us to play to our strengths and I didn't want to. I wanted to play to our weaknesses. I wanted to experiment." [...] Bono noted that the end product [...] "doesn't quite get off the ground the way I'd hoped it would." [...] An early mix of the track was included on some versions of the 20th anniversary reissue of Achtung Baby. The mix, titled [...] "'Baby' Acrobat", contained lyrics that were later modified to a different perspective ("You know I'd hit out if I only knew who to hit" [...] instead of the final [...] "I know you'd hit out <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>only</b> knew who to hit") or scrapped entirely ("If the sky turns to purple and the moon turns to blood / Will you dig me out when I'm face down in the mud").|$|E
500|$|Each offense {{would face}} tough {{defense in the}} air and on the ground. The Virginia Tech defense, led by junior linebackers Vince Hall and Xavier Adibi, was {{expected}} to present a challenge for the Georgia offense. [...] "You try to find some kind of mismatch, but it's very difficult to do", Georgia head coach Mark Richt said before kickoff. [...] "That's why they're the best (defense) in the country. Their interior defensive linemen are very, very strong and physical, and, really, everybody else is built for speed. Their edge rushers are tremendous, and their linebackers are outstanding and physical. Their defensive backs can all run and hit. It's {{going to be a real}} challenge." [...] Of particular concern for quarterback Matt Stafford were Virginia Tech's cornerbacks, whom he would have to go through in order to complete passes to his receivers. [...] "They play kind of a different scheme than a lot of teams so it would be tough <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>only</b> had one week to try to prepare for these guys", Stafford said in an interview prior to the game. [...] "They trust their corners a lot, but they've got good ones and can. They lock up a lot of time single receiver side because they've got a good corner down there that plays on the boundary." ...|$|E

500|$|The Escapist gave Last Specter a {{score of}} four-and-a-half stars out of five, saying, [...] "Another Professor Layton game, another bit of puzzling brilliance. Some of the brain teasers feel a bit {{recycled}} - instead of foxes and chickens, you're shuttling dogs and cats across the river, for example - but there's more than enough variety to warrant doggedly tracking down every last one. But <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>only</b> solve the ones you need to move the story forward, that's ok, too." [...] The Guardian gave it four stars out of five, saying, [...] "If you've not {{been a fan of}} the series, this isn't the game that's going to change your mind. For everybody else though, Professor Layton & The Spectre's Call is several days of commute-improving, grey cell stimulation in a mostly effective package. [...] And bravo to Nintendo for keeping this franchise on the standard DS rather than – for the time being, at least – adding that third dimension." [...] However, The Daily Telegraph gave it two-and-a-half stars out of five, saying, [...] "The Layton charm is undoubtedly still present, but it's not enough to carry the series by itself. Upon solving certain puzzles, Layton exclaims 'I love the thrill of a good solution'. So do we, Hershel, so do we. And in this Layton game, sadly, that thrill is all too rare." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{original}} Dragon Quest game {{is often}} cited as the first console RPG. GameSpot called the original Dragon Quest one of the fifteen most influential games of all time and the [...] "most influential role-playing games of all time", stating that nearly all Japanese RPGs since then have drawn from its gameplay [...] "in some shape or form." [...] Next Generation said it was [...] "probably the first ever 'Japanese style' RPG", and listed the series collectively as number 56 on their [...] "Top 100 Games of All Time". They commented, [...] "While never as ambitious as Square's Final Fantasy series, later installments of Dragon Warrior can't be beaten for sheer size (<b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>only</b> had enough cash to buy you one game that had to last you a month, you bought a Dragon Warrior title)." [...] In response to a survey, Gamasutra cites Quinton Klabon of Dartmouth College as stating Dragon Warrior translated the D experience to video games and set the genre standards. Games such as Mother, Breath of Fire and Lufia & the Fortress of Doom were inspired by various Dragon Quest titles. Dragon QuestIIIs class-changing system would shape other RPGs, especially the Final Fantasy series. Dragon Quest IVs [...] "Tactics" [...] system, where the player can set the AI routines for NPCs, {{is seen as a}} precursor to Final Fantasy XIIs [...] "Gambits" [...] system. Dragon Quest V is cited as having monster recruiting and training mechanics that inspired monster-collecting RPGs such as Pokémon, Digimon, and Dokapon, and in turn the modern trend of collecting achievements. Dragon Quest V also introduced the concept of a playable pregnancy. The real world and dream world setting of Dragon Quest VI is considered an influence on the later Square RPGs Chrono Cross and Final FantasyX. The Dragon Quest series was recognized by Guinness World Records, with six world records in the Guinness World Records Gamer's Edition. These records include [...] "Best Selling Role Playing Game on the Super Famicom", [...] "Fastest Selling Game in Japan", and [...] "First Video Game Series to Inspire a Ballet".|$|E
