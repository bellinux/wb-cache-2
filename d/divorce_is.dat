5|$|The Demi-Virgin is a three-act play {{written by}} Avery Hopwood. Producer Albert H. Woods staged it on Broadway, {{where it was}} a hit during the 1921–22 season. The play is a bedroom farce about former couple Gloria Graham and Wally Deane, both movie actors, whose {{marriage}} was so brief that the press speculated about whether Gloria was still a virgin. She attempts to seduce Wally when {{they are forced to}} reunite for a movie, but after playing along he surprises her by revealing that their <b>divorce</b> <b>is</b> not valid.|$|E

50|$|This <b>divorce</b> <b>was</b> first not {{recognized}} {{for several years}} by Iran, but eventually an official <b>divorce</b> <b>was</b> obtained in Iran, on 17 November 1948, with Queen Fawzia successfully reclaiming her previous distinction of Princess of Egypt as well. A major condition of the <b>divorce</b> <b>was</b> that her daughter be left behind to be raised in Iran. Incidentally, Queen Fawzia’s brother, King Farouk, also divorced his first wife, Queen Farida, in November 1948.|$|R
5000|$|Prior to 1968, {{the only}} grounds for <b>divorce</b> <b>were</b> {{adultery}} or cruelty. However, in 1968, the <b>Divorce</b> Act <b>was</b> amended to permit divorce for other reasons, including {{physical and mental}} cruelty and separation for at least 3 years. The <b>Divorce</b> Act <b>was</b> amended in 1986 to reduce the separation period to one year, with no requirement to prove [...] "fault" [...] by either spouse. The fault grounds for <b>divorce</b> <b>are</b> also available.|$|R
5|$|The {{church does}} not {{recognise}} divorce as ending a valid marriage and allows state-recognised divorce {{only as a}} means of protecting the property and well being of the spouses and any children. However, consideration of particular cases by the competent ecclesiastical tribunal can lead to declaration of the invalidity of a marriage, a declaration usually referred to as an annulment. Remarriage following a <b>divorce</b> <b>is</b> not permitted unless the prior marriage was declared invalid.|$|E
5|$|Men have a {{unilateral}} right to divorce their wives (talaq) without needing any legal justification. The <b>divorce</b> <b>is</b> effective immediately. The husband's obligation is then to provide {{financial support for}} the divorced wife {{for a period of}} four months and ten days. A woman can only obtain a divorce with the consent of her husband or judicially if her husband has harmed her. In practice, it is very difficult for a Saudi woman to obtain a judicial divorce. The divorce rate is high, with 50% of marriages being dissolved. In the event of divorce, fathers have automatic custody of sons from the age of 7 and daughters from the age of 9. The right for men to marry up to four wives, combined with their ability to divorce a wife at any time without cause, can translate to unlimited polygamy. King Abdul Aziz, the founder of the country, reportedly admitted to marrying over two hundred women. However, his polygamy was considered extraordinary even by Saudi Arabian standards.|$|E

50|$|No-fault <b>divorce</b> <b>was</b> {{introduced}} by the Bolsheviks following the Russian Revolution of 1917. Before the Revolution, religious institutions tended to define family life. It was the ecclesiastical law of the various denominations that controlled the family, marriage, and divorce. For example, the official registration of birth, death, marriage, and <b>divorce</b> <b>was</b> {{the responsibility of the}} parish church. Under these non-secular laws, <b>divorce</b> <b>was</b> highly restricted (but always somewhat available, as no major religion in Russia completely disallowed divorce).|$|R

50|$|The Washoe County Courthouse, at 117 S. Virginia St. in Reno, Nevada, {{was built}} in 1910.

In 1931, more than 4,800 <b>divorces</b> <b>were</b> processed in northern Nevada, most processed through this courthouse; it was economically important, with $5,000,000 being spent per year in Reno by divorcing parties.|$|R

25|$|According to a 2004 study, Las Vegas {{has one of}} {{the highest}} divorce rates. The city's high divorce rate is not wholly due to Las Vegans {{themselves}} getting divorced.

But it has been argued as indicating a probable total of only 15% of marriages celebrated in an Orthodox church led to any form of divorce.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Divorce</b> <b>was</b> a legal but {{relatively}} informal affair which mainly involved a wife leaving her husband’s house and taking back her dowry. According to the historian Valerius Maximus, <b>divorces</b> <b>were</b> taking place by 604 BCE or earlier, {{and the law}} code as embodied in the mid-5th century BCE by the Twelve Tables provides for <b>divorce.</b> <b>Divorce</b> <b>was</b> socially acceptable if carried out within social norms (mos maiorum). By the time of Cicero and Julius Caesar, <b>divorce</b> <b>was</b> relatively common and [...] "shame-free," [...] the subject of gossip rather than a social disgrace. Valerius says that Lucius Annius was disapproved of because he divorced his wife without consulting his friends; that is, he undertook the action for his own purposes and without considering its effects on his social network (amicitia and clientela). The censors of 307 BCE thus expelled him from the Senate for moral turpitude.|$|R
