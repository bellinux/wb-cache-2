500|$|In September 1951, after {{a series}} of {{differences}} with Bradbury and other scientists, Teller resigned from Los Alamos, and returned to the University of Chicago. At about the same time, Ulam went on leave as a visiting professor at Harvard for a semester. Although Teller and Ulam submitted a joint report on their design and jointly applied for a patent on it, they soon became involved in a dispute over who deserved credit. [...] After the war, Bethe returned to Cornell University, but he was deeply involved in the development of thermonuclear weapons as a consultant. [...] In 1954, he wrote an article {{on the history of the}} H-bomb, which presents his opinion that both men contributed very significantly to the breakthrough. [...] This balanced view is shared by others who were involved, including Mark and Fermi, but Teller persistently attempted to downplay Ulam's role. [...] "After the H-bomb was made," [...] Bethe recalled, [...] "reporters started to call Teller the father of the H-bomb. For the sake of history, I think it is more precise to say that Ulam is the father, because he provided the seed, and Teller is the mother, because he remained with the child. As for me, <b>I</b> <b>guess</b> <b>I</b> <b>am</b> the midwife." ...|$|E
500|$|While experts found Bundy's precise {{diagnosis}} elusive, {{the majority}} of evidence pointed away from bipolar disorder or other psychoses, and toward antisocial personality disorder (ASPD). [...] Bundy displayed many personality traits typically found in ASPD patients (who are often identified as [...] "sociopaths" [...] or [...] "psychopaths"), such as outward charm and charisma with little true personality or genuine insight beneath the facade; the ability to distinguish right from wrong, but with minimal effect on behavior; and an absence of guilt or remorse. [...] "Guilt doesn't solve anything, really", Bundy said, in 1981. [...] "It hurts you ... <b>I</b> <b>guess</b> <b>I</b> <b>am</b> in the enviable position of not {{having to deal with}} guilt." [...] There was also evidence of narcissism, poor judgment, and manipulative behavior. [...] "Sociopaths", prosecutor George Dekle wrote, [...] "are egotistical manipulators who think they can con anybody." [...] "Sometimes he manipulates even me", admitted one psychiatrist. In the end, Lewis agreed with the majority: [...] "I always tell my graduate students that if they can find me a real, true psychopath, I'll buy them dinner", she told Nelson. [...] "I never thought they existed ... but I think Ted may have been one, a true psychopath, without any remorse or empathy at all." [...] Narcissistic personality disorder (NPD) has been proposed as an alternative diagnosis in at least one subsequent retrospective analysis.|$|E
2500|$|The {{difficulties}} encountered {{during the}} peace talks {{between the government and}} the Zapatistas were due mostly to the initiatives promoted by the Attorney General of Mexico (PGR). On 23 October 1995, in order to derail {{the peace talks}}, the PGR arrested and sent Fernando Yañez Muñoz to prison. These actions violated the governing peace talks law, which granted a guarantee of free passage to all Zapatistas during the negotiations and suspended outstanding arrest warrants against them. On 26 October, the Zapatista National Liberation Army denied any association with Muñoz and announced a Red Alert, while Marcos returned to the mountains. That same day, the PGR dropped all charges against the alleged Comandante German. The COCOPA agreed with the determination. On 27 October, Muñoz was freed from the Reclusorio Preventivo Oriente. He said: [...] "I was arrested for political reasons and <b>I</b> <b>guess</b> <b>I</b> <b>am</b> set free for political reasons, my arrest was with the objective purpose of sabotaging the peace talks." [...] On 29 October 1995 the Zapatistas lifted the Red Alert and negotiations were resumed.|$|E

2500|$|Though the game's {{director}} [...] "deliberately created Bayonetta from scratch" [...] and {{has called}} its story [...] "completely original", he has admitted using [...] "some names from Scandinavian mythology" [...] and playing [...] "about half of" [...] Devil May Cry 4 for research. [...] As {{a fan of}} folk music, he named Bayonetta's set of four handguns after the old English ballad [...] "Scarborough Fair", and its individual guns Parsley, Sage, Rosemary and Thyme. [...] Hiroshi Yamaguchi focused on composing music for the game that has a [...] "nice up-tempo beat" [...] and expresses femininity through female choirs, pianos, and other beautiful' instruments"—though some tracks also use pure orchestra or folk instruments—while Kenichiro Yoshimura transformed Shimazaki's Bayonetta design into a game model and used the digital sculpting tool ZBrush to create normal maps for its details. [...] He worked with Shimazaki on the model's makeup, referred to foreign models with similar bodies, and said [...] "I really wanted to get Bayonetta's backside perfect. <b>I</b> <b>guess</b> <b>I</b> <b>am</b> into that sort of thing..." [...] The language spoken by the Angels and for all Infernal Summons is Enochian.|$|E

6000|$|... "It's {{a terrible}} disgrace--to go to prison," [...] he answered, {{in a low}} tone. [...] "But my father {{had to go through}} it, and <b>I</b> <b>guess</b> <b>I</b> <b>am</b> worse than he is." [...] He heaved a deep sigh. [...] "Well, I'll try to stand it." ...|$|E

[...] "But, say--say, I wonder why--Somehow, I haven't enjoyed Oxford {{and the rest}} of the places like I ought to. See, I'd always thought I'd be simply nutty about the quatrangles and stuff, but I'm afraid they're too highbrow for me.

6000|$|... "If you are <b>I</b> <b>guess</b> <b>I</b> <b>am</b> too, Anne, for Rachel {{often has}} that very effect on me.

There {{should have been a}} special commandment against nagging. But there, I shouldn't talk so. Rachel is a good Christian woman and she means well.

Now, Saxon, you know I love you, and just say to yourself that you forgive me this time, and you won't never have to do it again.|$|E
6000|$|... "Who said it was?" [...] Billy snapped roughly. [...] "Can't I kick {{in general}} if I want to? Just the same {{it makes me}} sick.

If they think they can beat us down to our knees, let 'em go ahead an' try it, that's all. But it gets me just the same. The whole world's clean dippy. They ain't no sense in anything.

60|$|Wednesday, I believe, 8th June.--Lots of David, {{and lots}} of David, and the devil any other news. Yesterday we were startled by great guns firing a salute, and to-day Whitmee (missionary) rode up to lunch, and we learned it was the Curaçoa come in, the ship (according to rumour) in which I was to be deported. I went down to meet my fate, and the captain is to dine with me Saturday, so <b>I</b> <b>guess</b> <b>I</b> <b>am</b> not going this voyage. Even with the particularity with which I write to you, how much of my life goes unexpressed; my {{troubles}} with a madman {{by the name of}} ----, a genuine living lunatic, I believe, and jolly dangerous; my troubles about poor ----, all these have dropped out; yet for moments they were very instant, {{and one of them is}} always present with me.|$|E
5000|$|Tania commented in her {{writings}} {{about the}} difficulty of being a woman artist who painted geometric abstractions.

60|$|I knew that, but I {{must admit}} I didn't care much {{to go all}} the way down when I made the first dive. Just as I jumped, I thought of the hard sharp things at the bottom, and <b>I</b> <b>guess</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> a little too careful not to dive into them.|$|R
5000|$|The intruder, Chevy Chase, Maryland, {{teenager}} Benjamin Smith, 18, tells {{a different}} story. [...] "I {{was in my}} underwear," [...] he told a radio interviewer.

6000|$|The {{tears came}} to the old woman's eyes, and her voice broke as she replied: [...] "I knew you would say that, Lee Virginia, but all the same I don't intend to have you do any such thing. You've got to cut loose from me altogether, because some fine chap {{is going to come}} along one of these days, and he won't want me even as a step-mother-in-law. No, I have decided that you and me had better live apart. I'll get you a place to live up in Sulphur, where I can visit you now and again; but <b>I</b> <b>guess</b> <b>I</b> <b>am</b> elected to stay right here in the Fork.

6000|$|... "Just as if I didn't have {{troubles}} {{enough without}} having this white robber {{to add to}} them," [...] grumbled Whitefoot. [...] "Why doesn't he stay where he belongs, {{way up in the}} Far North? It must be that food is scarce up there. Well, now that I know he is here, he will have to be smarter than I think he is to catch me. I hope Jumper the Hare will have sense enough to keep perfectly still. I've sometimes envied him his long legs, but <b>I</b> <b>guess</b> <b>I</b> <b>am</b> better off than he is, at that. Once he has been seen by an enemy, only those long legs of his can save him, but I have a hundred hiding-places down under the snow.

'I {{might not}} have said so then, that is likely enough; one can't always tell whether a {{yearling}} {{is going to turn}} out a good horse, and a good many who think they are clever get sucked in over it; but a man who has an eye to horseflesh can tell whether a three-year-old is well bred or not, and <b>I</b> <b>guess</b> <b>I</b> <b>am</b> not far out with this one.

No, sir, I have seen pistols and knives out pretty often since I came here, and would use them myself if there was any occasion, and I guess that if we ever get into a mess you will find I shall play my part as well as you do; only I want it clearly understood that in this job we are going in for I am ready to go through it whatever comes; but I am fixed in my mind {{that we are going to}} act straight to that girl.' ...|$|E
