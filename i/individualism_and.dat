5|$|Alternatively, Suzanne Bergeron, for example, raises {{examples}} {{of studies that}} illustrate the multifaceted effects of globalization on women, including Kumudhini Rosa's study of Sri Lankan, Malaysian, and Philippine, workers in free trade zones {{as an example of}} local resistance to globalization. Women there use their wages to create women's centers aimed at providing legal and medical services, libraries and cooperative housing, to local community members. Such efforts, Bergeron highlights, allow women the chance to take control of economic conditions, increase their sense of <b>individualism,</b> <b>and</b> alter the pace and direction of globalization itself.|$|E
5|$|Until the mid-1970s, the Conservative Party {{was mostly}} {{controlled}} by one-nation conservatives. The {{rise of the}} New Right in conservative politics led to a critique of one-nation conservatism which contended that Keynesian economics and welfarism had damaged the economy and society. The Winter of Discontent of 1978–79 was portrayed by the New Right as illustrative of the overextension of the state. Figures such as Margaret Thatcher believed that to reverse the national decline, {{it was necessary to}} revive old values of <b>individualism</b> <b>and</b> challenge the dependency culture created by the welfare state.|$|E
5|$|In the 1930s Yeats {{was fascinated}} with the authoritarian, anti-democratic, {{nationalist}} movements of Europe, and he composed several marching songs for the far right Blueshirts, although they were never used. He was a fierce opponent of <b>individualism</b> <b>and</b> political liberalism, and saw the fascist movements as a triumph of public order {{and the needs of}} the national collective over petty individualism. On the other hand, he was also an elitist who abhorred the idea of mob-rule, and saw democracy as a threat to good governance and public order. After the Blueshirt movement began to falter in Ireland, he distanced himself somewhat from his previous views, but maintained a preference for authoritarian and nationalist leadership.|$|E

5|$|Hand {{had voted}} for Hoover in 1928, {{and he did}} so again in 1932; but in 1936, he voted for the Democrats and Franklin D. Roosevelt, as a {{reaction}} to the economic and social turmoil that followed the Wall Street Crash of 1929. With the Great Depression setting in, Hand favored a policy of interventionist central government. He came to accept Frankfurter's view that redistribution of wealth was essential for economic recovery. Hoover resisted this approach, favoring <b>individualism</b> <b>and</b> free enterprise. Roosevelt, on the other hand, promised the voters a New Deal. They elected him on a platform of strong executive leadership and radical economic reform. Hand voted for Roosevelt again in 1940 and 1944, but he remained vigilant on the constitutional dangers of big government. Like others, including Walter Lippmann, he sensed the dictatorial potential of New Deal policies. He had no hesitation in condemning Roosevelt's 1937 bill to expand the Supreme Court and pack it with New Dealers.|$|E
