25|$|Some {{parents want}} to try to <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>baby</b> very soon after the miscarriage. The {{decision}} of trying to become pregnant again can be difficult.

Some clinicians recommend that the women have one menstrual cycle before attempting another pregnancy. This is because the date of conception may be hard to determine.

Parents may be advised to wait even longer if they have experienced late miscarriage, molar pregnancy or are undergoing tests. Some parents wait for six months based upon recommendations from their health care provider.|$|E
