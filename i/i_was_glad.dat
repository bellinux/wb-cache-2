25|$|The {{music was}} {{performed}} by a choir of 430, a 65 piece orchestra and 10 State Trumpeters. At the 1838 coronation, the organist had attempted to play the instrument and conduct at the same time, {{with the result that}} neither function was satisfactory. Bridge not only delegated the organ to Walter Alcock, but also used two sub-conductors, and furthermore alternated with Parratt in conducting {{from the top of the}} organ screen. The only real musical error was that Bridge misjudged the timing of <b>I</b> <b>Was</b> <b>Glad</b> and had finished the anthem before the King had arrived, having to repeat it when the right moment came.

25|$|Soon after Purcell's marriage, in 1682, on {{the death}} of Edward Lowe, he was {{appointed}} organist of the Chapel Royal, an office which he was able to hold simultaneously with his position at Westminster Abbey. His eldest son was born in this same year, but he was short-lived. His first printed composition, Twelve Sonatas, was published in 1683. For some years after this, he was busy in the production of sacred music, odes addressed to the king and royal family, and other similar works. In 1685, he wrote two of his finest anthems, <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>glad</b> and My heart is inditing, for the coronation of King James II. In 1690 he composed a setting of the birthday ode for Queen Mary, Arise, my muse and four years later wrote one of his most elaborate, important and magnificent works – a setting for another birthday ode for the Queen, written by Nahum Tate, entitled Come Ye Sons of Art.|$|E
500|$|The project caused {{division}} in Blink-182, mostly between DeLonge and Hoppus. Hoppus {{was interested in}} {{being a part of}} the record, but DeLonge did not want it to turn into a Blink-182 album. DeLonge contended that the involvement of Barker was to refrain from having to pay a session musician. Regardless, Hoppus felt betrayed and unresolved tension dogged the band until their 2005 breakup. [...] "Nobody talked about it. It was this strange situation that nobody addressed," [...] DeLonge told Blender. Barker felt guilty when he told Hoppus they were going to tour in support of the album: [...] "I felt like I had let him down [...] but he was ultimately more upset at Tom because they had ten years of history together before me." [...] Despite this tension, Hoppus lent vocals to the track [...] "Elevator" [...] and shared early ideas for the next Blink-182 album. In a later Reddit AMA, Hoppus concluded, [...] "The whole situation sucked. But I sang on the track because, at the heart of it, Tom and Travis are my friends.

500|$|Early on, I {{realized}} {{that what this}} particular crew needed from me was not pressure but the light touch.

[...] My concern was about our performance in an emergency, being at the same time unable to predict what emergencies might be in store for us. [...] It was important, I thought, to hold back on the pressure until a really tough problem came up.

Ken Tucker of New York Magazine said she played the part [...] "in full va-va-voom blossom" [...] while LaSalle felt that she manages [...] "to convince us that Ava {{was one of the}} great broads of all time." [...] However, Clark described it as [...] "the one performance that doesn't come off (though Beckinsale has the requisite beauty)" [...] while Peter Bradshaw of The Guardian stated that [...] "Gardner's rich, voluptuous sexiness is completely absent as Beckinsale sleepwalks through the role as if she was advertising perfume."

500|$|After [...] "Slanderous" [...] and [...] "Beautiful Mourning" [...] "Aesthetics of Hate" [...] was {{the third}} song that was written for Machine Heads album The Blackening.

[...] In February 2005, Machine Head had penned a rough version of [...] "Aesthetics of Hate". A 13-track November 2005 demo featured the song, although it contained what Flynn described as a [...] "totally fucking lame 'Angel of Death' rip off.

500|$|Both {{the public}} and critics were unnerved {{by the sight of}} the work. Russell {{describes}} being shocked by [...] "images so unrelievedly awful that the mind shut with a snap at the sight of them. Their anatomy was half-human, half-animal, and they were confined in a low-ceilinged, windowless and oddly proportioned space. They could bite, probe, and suck, and they had very long eel-like necks, but their functioning in other respects was mysterious. Ears and mouths they had, but two at least of them were sightless." [...] Writing for Apollo magazine, Herbert Furst recalled, [...] "I, I must confess, was so shocked and disturbed by the Surrealism of Francis Bacon that <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>glad</b> to escape from this exhibition.

[...] The triptych caused a sensation, and overnight turned Bacon into the most controversial painter in the country.|$|E
500|$|TV Fanatic's Christina Tran {{gave the}} episode a {{positive}} review, awarding it 4 out of 5 stars.

[...] She also enjoyed {{the addition of the}} Ben character and hoped that the Renee character would receive her own storyline this season. John Griffiths of Us Weekly awarded the episode 3.5 out of 4 stars, writing, [...] "After last season's silly antics, the venerable dramedy pulls itself together for a clever final round." [...] He opined that Carlos and Susan's guilt helped keep the cover-up storyline compelling. The Hollywood Reporter Jethro Nededog was positive in his review of the episode, writing: [...] "It was a strong return, because it relied on the series’ strength, which is the bond these women have with each other."

She had been at Spithead on 1 May, when the 98-gun [...] caught fire and blew up, with Bellerophon rescuing twelve men.

The squadron had arrived on station on 7 June, and the following day captured a convoy of eight French merchants off Belle Île. The squadron remained in the area until 16 June, when a lookout on Bellerophon spotted a large fleet to the east-south-east. This was the Brest fleet, consisting of thirteen ships of the line, two frigates, two brigs and a cutter, under Admiral Villaret de Joyeuse. Heavily outnumbered, Cornwallis ordered a retreat, but the Bellerophon and [...] sailed unusually slowly {{and he found himself}} being steadily overhauled by the French. Keeping his ships together, Cornwallis ordered Bellerophon to take up position at the head of his line, later explaining that [...] "The Bellerophon <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>glad</b> to keep in some measure as a reserve, having reason at first to suppose there would be full occasion for the utmost exertions of us all...

500|$|In the 19thcentury, {{works by}} major European composers were often used, but when SirFrederick Bridge was {{appointed}} director of {{music for the}} 1902 coronation of King EdwardVII, he decided that {{it ought to be}} a celebration of four hundred years of British music. Compositions by Thomas Tallis, Orlando Gibbons and Henry Purcell were included alongside works by contemporary composers such as Arthur Sullivan, Charles Villiers Stanford and John Stainer. Hubert Parry's <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>glad</b> was written as the entrance anthem for the 1902 coronation, replacing an 1831 setting by Thomas Attwood; it contains a bridge section partway through so that the scholars of Westminster School can exercise their right to be the first commoners to acclaim the sovereign, shouting their traditional [...] "vivats" [...] as he or she enters the coronation theatre. This anthem and Charles Villiers Stanford's Gloria in excelsis (1911) have also been used regularly in recent coronations, as has the national anthem, God Save the Queen (or King). Other composers whose music featured in ElizabethII's coronation include SirGeorge Dyson, Gordon Jacob, SirWilliam Henry Harris, Herbert Howells, SirWilliam Walton, Samuel Sebastian Wesley, Ralph Vaughan Williams and the Canadian-resident but English-born Healey Willan. Ralph Vaughan Williams suggested that a congregational hymn be included. This was approved by the Queen and the Archbishop of Canterbury, so Vaughan Williams recast his 1928 arrangement of Old 100th, the English metrical version of Psalm 100, the Jubilate Deo ("All people that on earth do dwell") for congregation, organ and orchestra: the setting has become ubiquitous at festal occasions in the Anglophone world.|$|E

He's the optimist to her pessimist. When they get the photo of the boy, Derek pointed out that at least he's alive and not alone. Megan said yes, but he's sick and possibly coughing up blood.
