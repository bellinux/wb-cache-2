5|$|Applewhite {{believed}} in the ancient astronaut hypothesis, which claimed that extraterrestrials had visited humanity <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>past</b> <b>and</b> placed humans on Earth and would return to collect a select few. Parts of this teaching bear similarities to the Reformed Christian concept of election, likely owing to Applewhite's Presbyterian upbringing. He often discussed extraterrestrials using phrases from Star Trek and stated that aliens communicated with him through the show.|$|E
5|$|Both {{hunting and}} egging {{continue}} today, although {{not at the}} levels that occurred <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>past,</b> <b>and</b> generally in a more controlled manner. For example, the Māori of Stewart Island/Rakiura continue to harvest the chicks of the sooty shearwater as they have done for centuries, using traditional methods (called kaitiakitanga) to manage the harvest, but now work with the University of Otago in studying the populations. In Greenland, however, uncontrolled hunting is pushing many species into steep decline.|$|E
5|$|Deep sky {{surveys show}} that galaxies are often found in groups and clusters. Solitary galaxies that have not {{significantly}} interacted with another galaxy of comparable mass during the past billion years are relatively scarce. Only about 5% of the galaxies surveyed {{have been found to}} be truly isolated; however, these isolated formations may have interacted and even merged with other galaxies <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>past,</b> <b>and</b> may still be orbited by smaller, satellite galaxies. Isolated galaxies can produce stars at a higher rate than normal, as their gas is not being stripped by other nearby galaxies.|$|E

5|$|Filming {{commenced}} on August 2009, {{and concluded}} {{by the end}} of the same year. It was filmed on location primarily in the Johannesburg area in South Africa, as well as the same Province the city is located, Gauteng. Other filming locations in the series include Northern Cape, Augrabies Falls National Park, and the Kalahari Desert. Harries wanted to film the series in South Africa because he worked there several times <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>past,</b> <b>and</b> knew the country can replicate anywhere in the world.|$|E
5|$|Image {{provided}} David Brothers {{to serve}} as the series' editor. Unlike traditional comic editors who focus on coordinating schedules and pushing deadlines, Brothers only reviews the work and provides responses that help the team create better work with more internal consistency. Eric Trautman, who had previously edited two of Rucka's novels, was recruited to help with research, timelines, and design work. Lark wanted to work with a European colorist to provide a look distinct from traditional American comics. Rucka suggested Santi Arcas, a colorist he had worked with <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>past,</b> <b>and</b> Lark particularly liked Arcas' skies and textures.|$|E

5|$|Justice Hayne {{concluded}} that the detention scheme in the Migration Act did not contravene Chapter III because, fundamentally, it was not punitive. The Act did not make being in Australia without a visa an offence (although it had been <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>past),</b> <b>and</b> in reality he considered the mandatory detention scheme to be not that different from {{a system in which}} all people were prevented from entering Australia without permission at all.|$|E
5|$|Once {{computational}} {{power was}} readily available, it became possible to easily design filters to minimise any arbitrary parameter, for example time delay or tolerance to component variation. The {{difficulties of the}} image method were firmly put <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>past,</b> <b>and</b> even the need for prototypes became largely superfluous. Furthermore, the advent of active filters eased the computation difficulty because sections could be isolated and iterative processes were not then generally necessary.|$|E

5|$|Spencer Tracy {{had been}} {{cast as the}} male lead in the film just days after MGM {{purchased}} {{the rights to the}} novel.

Bronisław Kaper, who had come to MGM in 1935 from Nazi Germany, was assigned to compose the film score. William H. Daniels was named the cinematographer.|$|E
5|$|The Pacific blue-eye (Pseudomugil signifer) is {{a species}} of fish in the family Pseudomugilidae native to eastern Australia.
