At this time the business traded as millwrights but by 1813 [...] "engineers" [...] had been added to the description, and by 1817 there was the addition of [...] "ironfounders".

40|$|AbstractThe global crisis (2007 - 2009) and the European {{sovereign}} debt crises (2011 - 2013) {{have led to}} {{major changes in the}} SMEs financing. The recovery after the mentioned turbulences is slow and it requires the creation of new financial instruments that allow SMEs maintaining/ developing the existing business solution, but also the creation of new start-ups. In the emerging European countries the situation is even more critical because SMEs access to conventional financial solutions was seriously limited. Governments should respond more actively to solve the growing difficulties faced by SMEs in accessing finance (<b>injections</b> <b>of</b> <b>capital</b> in loan guaranteed programs, direct lending programs, micro-credit loans and other guaranties), but should be designed also other interesting innovative schemes (public-private partnership, special dedicated investment funds with flexible structure) ...|$|R

40|$|Hungary was the � rst {{transition}} economy {{to complete the}} process of privatisating state banks. This article outlines this process {{in the light of}} the economic and � nancial pressures after 1989, which had severely weakened the � nancial condition of these banks. It describes the ways in which bank balance sheets were consolidated by state-underwritten loan write-offs and <b>injections</b> <b>of</b> <b>capital</b> within a new legislative framework. The main privatisations are described in a set of mini-case studies. The process was effectively complete by end- 1997. The EBRD was closely involved as adviser and investor, signi � cant revenue was generated for the state (albeit much lower than the consolidation support required), foreign strategic investors were attracted and no major � nancial institution had to be liquidated. Despite the attendant controversy and scandal, the Hungarian experience offers useful lessons to other transition economies which have yet to seriously address this issue...|$|R

40|$|At {{the zero}} lower bound, {{the scale and}} scope of non-conventional {{monetary}} policies have become the key decision variables for monetary policy makers. In the UK, quantitative easing has involved {{the creation of a}} fund to purchase medium term dated government bonds with borrowed central bank reserves and so has increased the liquidity of the non-bank financial sector and temporarily eased the budget constraint of HMT. Some of these reserves have been used to increase the extent <b>of</b> <b>capital</b> held by banks and there have also been direct <b>injections</b> <b>of</b> <b>capital</b> into the banking system. We assess some of the issues arising from the three policies by using three separate DSGE models, which take seriously the role of financial frictions. We find {{that it is possible to}} correct the effects of a lower zero bound in DSGE models, by (i) offsetting the liquidity premium embedded in long term bonds and/or (ii) adopting countercyclical subsidies to bank capital able and/or (iii) the creation of central bank reserves that reduce the costs of loan supply.
