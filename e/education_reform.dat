5|$|Patton's opponent, Republican Larry Forgy, {{hurt his}} {{campaign}} by aligning {{himself with the}} Christian right, alienating moderates in both parties, particularly in Louisville. He also openly opposed the Kentucky <b>Education</b> <b>Reform</b> Act (KERA), passed in 1990 during the administration of Wallace G. Wilkinson. Republican supporters of <b>education</b> <b>reform</b> deserted his campaign and helped form a bi-partisan coalition supporting KERA. Traditional Democratic voting blocs such as organized labor and African-Americans turned out in force for Patton. To further undermine Forgy, Patton reminded voters of the budget cuts by Congressional Republicans to programs affecting the elderly. These issues ultimately delivered a Patton victory of 500,787votes to 479,227. It was the closest Kentucky gubernatorial election in 32years, and {{marked the first time}} an eastern Kentuckian had won the governorship since Bert T. Combs in 1959.|$|E

40|$|This {{paper is}} a means of {{exploring}} how neoliberal <b>education</b> <b>reforms</b> have been implemented and what issues remain in education development as a product of those reforms. To examine neoliberal <b>education</b> <b>reforms,</b> this paper explores how international organizations such as the World Bank and international discourses in the international community influence education development and require developing countries to implement neoliberal reforms. I look to the work of Martin Carnoy (1995) "Structural adjustment and the changing face of education," which categorizes the responses to neoliberal <b>education</b> reforms: competitiveness-driven <b>reform,</b> equity-driven reform, and financial-driven reform, as the theoretical framework. Chilean higher <b>education</b> <b>reforms</b> are analyzed as a case study. The paper concludes that neoliberal <b>education</b> <b>reforms</b> expanded the number of higher education institutions and achieve efficiency and effectiveness in higher education; however, public universities have lost their autonomy and access inequity and quality assurance of higher education have been remained...|$|R

5|$|Aware of the {{inadequacy}} of bureaucracy in Austria, and wishing to improve it, Maria Theresa reformed education in 1775. In a new school system based on the Prussian one, all children of both genders from the ages of six to twelve were required to attend school. <b>Education</b> <b>reform</b> was met with hostility from many villages; Maria Theresa crushed the dissent by ordering the arrest of all those opposed. Although the idea had merit, the reforms were not as successful as {{they were expected to}} be since no funding was offered from the state; in some parts of Austria, half of the population was illiterate well into the 19thcentury.|$|E

While Selfe would not be drawn again into the centre of the fray, he supported the efforts of his sister Maybanke and her second husband Francis Anderson towards <b>education</b> <b>reform.</b> Following the Knibbs-Turner Royal Commission into New South Wales Education in 1902, and the appointment of Peter Board as Director of Education in 1905, many of Selfe's ideas for technical education were implemented. Ultimately, in 1949, a separate Department of Technical Education was created, and the New South Wales University of Technology (later the University of New South Wales) was established at Kensington.|$|E
5|$|The basic {{principles}} of New Labour existed in the post-war socialist revisionism of Anthony Crosland. Crosland emphasised that Labour should not just focus on nationalisation and social welfare, but attempt to reform education, resolve wealth inequality, and pursue better industrial relations. His work The Future of Socialism stressed the idea that socialism is moral and should pursue liberty, fellowship, social justice, and equality. This required the redistribution of wealth through a progressive tax system, rendering public ownership {{of the means of}} production, enshrined in Clause IV of Labour's constitution, unnecessary. Crosland also proposed that <b>education</b> <b>reform</b> allow greater egalitarianism, proposing the abolition of the eleven plus exam.|$|E

5|$|Combs first {{attempted}} to gain legislative concessions that might preclude {{the need for}} a lawsuit. Governor Martha Layne Collins proposed an <b>education</b> <b>reform</b> agenda and called the legislature into special session in mid-1985 to consider it. The legislature enacted a corporate income tax to raise $300million aimed at reducing class sizes, but the Council was seeking more fundamental structural changes to the system and deemed the increased funds insufficient to equalize its members' standing with that of more affluent school districts. Dissatisfied with the results of the special session, Combs and the Council filed their suit, Rose v. Council for Better Education, on November 20, 1985. The governor, state superintendent, state treasurer, leaders of both houses of the state legislature, and every member of {{the state board of education}} were named as defendants in the case.|$|E
5|$|Following {{his term}} in office, Combs was {{appointed}} to the Sixth Circuit Court of Appeals by President Johnson. He served for three years before resigning and running for governor again in 1971. He lost in the Democratic primary to Wendell Ford, his former executive secretary. In 1984, Combs agreed to represent sixty-six of the state's poor school districts in a lawsuit challenging the state's system of financing public education. The suit, Rose v. Council for Better Education, resulted in the Kentucky Supreme Court declaring the state's entire system of public schools unconstitutional. In response, the Kentucky General Assembly drafted a sweeping education measure known as the Kentucky <b>Education</b> <b>Reform</b> Act in 1991. On December 3, 1991, Combs was caught in a flash flood while driving and was killed.|$|E

It provides lesser benefits to households with income over $41,000. The program will be gradually phased in over a three-year period and would be available to all state residents by 2014.|$|E

5|$|In the 1990s, primary <b>education</b> <b>reform</b> {{had become}} one of the top {{priorities}} in the People's Republic of China. About 160million Chinese people had missed all or part of their education because of the Cultural Revolution in the late 1960s and early 1970s, and in 1986 the National People's Congress enacted a law calling for nine years of compulsory education. By 1993, it was clear that much of the country was making little progress on implementing nine-year compulsory education, so the 1993–2000seven-year plan focused on this goal. One of the major challenges educators faced was the large number of rural schoolchildren dropping out to pursue work. Another issue was a large urban–rural divide: funding and teacher quality were far better in urban schools than rural, and urban students stayed in school longer.|$|E

40|$|The {{full text}} of this {{presentation}} is available via the links above. In England, {{there is a problem}} with regard to gaining consensus on the purposes of education and then developing <b>education</b> <b>reforms</b> to meet those purposes. The focus of this paper is to make a modest contribution to shedding light on this problem. To do this the paper has four aims. First, to explore a theory of state, participation and knowledge that will facilitate the rethinking of a shift in England from Government <b>reforms</b> in <b>education,</b> to structures and providers of <b>education</b> governance <b>reforms.</b> Second, to draw on Taysum (2012) to map <b>education</b> <b>reforms</b> in England from the Second World War to 2013. Third, to read the <b>education</b> <b>reforms</b> through the theory of state participation and knowledge. Finally to make a contribution to this symposium to gain new insights into common trends found in the characteristics and problems of <b>education</b> <b>reforms</b> in the U. K., the U. S., and South Korea, and Japan. Over the past few decades in England, the scope of <b>education</b> <b>reforms</b> has been characterized by government reforms, and shifts to governance reforms from ‘education for all’ to the commodification of education and a ‘strategy of separatism’. Education contents have moved from being redesigned, to public education being reframed in its structure and providers. <b>Education</b> <b>reforms</b> have been promoted in response to common social conditions. Ball (2004) suggests these might include the relationship between the state and the professions offering services, timing, naive research that on the whole ignores the messiness of school life, financial issues, and research that provides control mechanisms for policy makers. However these items do not consider a theory of the state that seeks to operationalize resources, and shift accountability away from Government, to governance of independent enterprises within the market. Such a theory of the state replicates social relations that sustain hegemonies in favour of those that hold power to ensure retention of power (Ball, 2004). Thus it is important to rethink Government, and governance systems with regard to <b>education</b> <b>reforms</b> and their relationship with three aspects. First economic conditions of economic growth or economic deficit. Second, power relations that do or do not facilitate stakeholder participation. Finally, the kind of knowledge that is produced, and/or exchanged, and/or 38 or transmitted. The paper takes Gale’s (2001) socio-historiographical approach to policy analyses to identify potential relationships between the socio-ed ucational present and the socio-educational past. This is achieved through the systematic and rigorous engagement with materials from the past and present. The approach enables historical stages to be revealed. A critical engagement with these stages may produce new knowledge about the public issues and private troubles (Taysum and Iqbal, 2012). To address the aims I ask four questions. First, what theories of the state and participation enable the rethinking of features, actors and backgrounds of educational reforms? Second, how can <b>education</b> <b>reforms</b> in England from the Second Worl d War to date be mapped? Third, how can these <b>education</b> <b>reforms</b> be understood in terms of a theory of the state and participation? Fourth, to what extent can this theorizing be applied to this symposium to gain new insights into common trends found in the characteristics and problems of <b>education</b> <b>reforms</b> in the U. K., the U. S., South Korea, and Japan?The 48 th Annual Conference of the Japan Educational Administration Society, half day International Symposium Supported by the Japan Educational Administration Society and the Korean Society for the Studies of Educational Administration, 12 th Oct 2013, Kyoto, Japa...|$|R
5|$|Frank {{meets with}} Walker's Chief of Staff, Linda Vasquez (Sakina Jaffrey), whom Frank {{recommended}} for the job. She reveals {{that she and}} Walker have decided to rescind their promise to nominate him as Secretary of State because {{they want him to}} remain in Congress and use his political expertise to get the President-elect’s <b>education</b> <b>reform</b> agenda passed. Frank is initially incensed, but when Linda asks if he will continue to be an ally to the future President he says that he will. Linda reveals that Senator Michael Kern (Kevin Kilner) has been chosen for the position instead. Despite his statement to the contrary, Frank feels personally betrayed and, with Claire’s encouragement, begins to formulate a plot for revenge, which he shares with his Chief of Staff, Doug Stamper (Michael Kelly). Mrs. Underwood, meanwhile, is forced to downsize the non-profit organization she manages, the Clean Water Initiative, which had been promised a large donation upon her husband’s confirmation as Secretary, without which the organization is forced to substantially curtail its budget.|$|E
5|$|Further {{indicative}} of the role cognitive flexibility plays in education is the argument that how students are taught greatly impacts the nature and formation of their cognitive structures, which in turn affect students’ ability to store and readily access information. A crucial aim of education is to help students learn as well as appropriately apply and adapt {{what they have learned}} to novel situations. This is reflected in the integration of cognitive flexibility into educational policy regarding academic guidelines and expectations. For example, as outlined in the , a standards-based <b>education</b> <b>reform</b> developed to increase high school graduation rates, educators are expected to present within the classroom “high level cognitive demands by asking students to demonstrate deep conceptual understanding through the application of content knowledge and skills to new situations.” This guideline within the Common Core Initiative is the essence of cognitive flexibility, and a teaching style focused on promoting it has been seen to foster understanding especially in disciplines where information is complex and nonlinear. A counterexample is evident in cases where such material is presented in an oversimplified manner and learners fail to transfer their knowledge to a new domain.|$|E
5|$|Though Patton had ambitions {{to enact}} <b>education</b> <b>reform</b> {{early in his}} administration, his {{financial}} adviser, James R. Ramsey, convinced him to propose a conservative budget in the first legislative session. The two developed a plan to modernize the state government, making it more efficient. State employees were leery of increased efficiency, believing it was a code word for cutting state jobs. Patton dispelled this notion by promising no involuntary layoffs. Patton also anticipated difficulty persuading legislators to invest an estimated $100million in equipment and processes to realize improved efficiency. However, when economists projected a budget surplus for 1996, Patton agreed to invest half of it in capital projects in exchange for using the other half for measures to improve government efficiency. Patton formed an Office for Technology and made improvements in the compatibility and interoperability of the state's computer systems that were recommended by his son, Chris. Investments of $23.3million yielded a return of $300million in state revenue. By the time Patton's efficiency program was fully implemented, the state was realizing an annual return of 75cents for every dollar initially invested.|$|E
