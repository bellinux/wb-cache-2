5|$|Presently, the {{porcupine}} ray {{is caught}} incidentally in trawls, tangle nets, and beach seines. Its skin {{continues to be}} highly valued, while the meat and cartilage may also be utilized. In the Farasan Islands and some {{other places in the}} Red Sea, its liver is eaten as a seasonal dish. However, the economic importance of this ray is limited by <b>how</b> <b>difficult</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> to handle. The multi-species coastal fisheries that catch the porcupine ray are largely unregulated, which seems to have resulted in its dramatic decline or local extinction in the Bay of Bengal, the Gulf of Thailand, and likely elsewhere in its range. Potential additional threats to this species include habitat degradation from coastal development, and depletion of its food supply from overfishing. As a result, the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) has assessed it as Vulnerable.|$|E

25|$|The {{concept of}} Turing degree is {{fundamental}} in computability theory, where sets of natural numbers are often regarded as decision problems.

25|$|Multiplexes {{can make}} use of {{statistical}} multiplexing at the MPEG video coder whereby the bitrate allocated to a channel within the multiplex can vary dynamically depending on <b>how</b> <b>difficult</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> to code the picture content at that precise time, and how much demand there is for bandwidth from other channels. In this way, complex pictures with much detail may demand a higher bitrate at one instant and this can result in the bitrate allocated to another channel in the same multiplex being reduced if the second channel is currently transmitting pictures which are easier to encode, with less fine detail.|$|E

25|$|The {{quality of}} sleep may be {{evaluated}} from an objective and a subjective point of view. Objective sleep quality refers to <b>how</b> <b>difficult</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> {{for a person}} to fall asleep and remain in a sleeping state, and how many times they wake up during a single night. Poor sleep quality disrupts the cycle of transition between the different stages of sleep. Subjective sleep quality in turn refers to a sense of being rested and regenerated after awaking from sleep. A study by A. Harvey et al. (2002) found that insomniacs were more demanding in their evaluations of sleep quality than individuals who had no sleep problems.|$|E

It feels like I'm a little off on things, a little slower. My left side is always numb, and my brain doesn't feel as sharp as it used to. And it's tough when people don't want to see or know about that. They draw a big X on you, and that's sad. It's like you're forgotten when you're out of the limelight. Nobody owes me anything, but somebody could maybe give me something (work-wise) to keep me involved. I used to make $5,000 for a two-hour appearance.

25|$|Using these variables, {{the optimal}} diet model can predict how predators choose between two prey types: big prey1 with energy value E1 and {{handling}} time h1, and small prey2 with energy value E2 and handling time h2. In order to maximize its overall rate of energy gain, a predator {{must consider the}} profitability of the two prey types. If {{it is assumed that}} big prey1 is more profitable than small prey2, then E1/h1 > E2/h2. Thus, if the predator encounters prey1, it should always choose to eat it, because of its higher profitability. It should never bother to go searching for prey2. However, if the animal encounters prey2, it should reject it to look for a more profitable prey1, unless the time it would take to find prey1 is too long and costly for it to be worth it. Thus, the animal should only eat prey2 if E2/h2 > E1/(h1+S1), where S1 is the search time for prey1. Since it is always favorable to choose to eat prey1, the choice to eat prey1 is not dependent on the abundance of prey2. But since the length of S1 (i.e. <b>how</b> <b>difficult</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> to find prey1) is logically dependent on the density of prey1, the choice to eat prey2 is dependent on the abundance of prey1.|$|E
25|$|Now, praise be to God that Dr. Zamenhof has {{invented the}} Esperanto language. It {{has all the}} {{potential}} qualities of becoming the international means of communication. All of us must be grateful and thankful to him for this noble effort; for in this way he has served his fellowmen well. With untiring effort and self-sacrifice {{on the part of}} its devotees Esperanto will become universal. Therefore every one of us must study this language and spread it as far as possible so that day by day it may receive a broader recognition, be accepted by all nations and governments of the world, and {{become a part of the}} curriculum in all the public schools. I hope that Esperanto will be adopted as the language of all the future international conferences and congresses, so that all people need acquire only two languages—one their own tongue and the other the international language. Then perfect union will be established between all the people of the world. Consider <b>how</b> <b>difficult</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> today to communicate with various nations. If one studies fifty languages one may yet travel through a country and not know the language. Therefore I hope that you will make the utmost effort, so that this language of Esperanto may be widely spread.|$|E

Reviewers also complained that it was extremely difficult to get enough stars to progress from one stage to the next, forcing players to replay the same levels over and over again.

Unsure how to approach the role, Morrissey was advised by his friend, director Paul Greengrass, to get Collins' job as politician right. Morrissey contacted State of Play producer Hilary Bevan Jones, who set up meetings between Morrissey and select committee members Kevin Barron and Fabian Hamilton. Both politicians educated Morrissey on <b>how</b> <b>difficult</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> to commute to London from a constituency outside the capital. Morrissey was also able to shadow Peter Mandelson around the House of Commons for a fortnight. He questioned Mandelson about his job as a cabinet minister but did not ask about his personal life.

500|$|On {{multiple}} occasions, numerous gaming magazines {{have chosen}} Sephiroth {{as one of}} the best villains from both the Final Fantasy series in specific and in all of video games in general. GameSpy placed him eighth in their 2014 list of top villains in games, commenting on <b>how</b> <b>difficult</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> to defeat him in Final Fantasy VII. In 2005, Sephiroth was the winner in a GameFAQs character battle involving only villains. IGN listed him at number two in its 2006 list of most memorable villains, as well as the fourth top video game villain. He has been named the number one villain in an episode of G4's Filter. PC World placed him second in their 2008 list of most diabolical video game villains of all time. That same year, Sephiroth was listed at the top of IGN's list of Final Fantasy VII top characters, with Dave Smith calling him the [...] "heavyweight champion of Final Fantasy villains," [...] and praising his appearance and backstory. He would take the same spot in the list of top 25 Final Fantasy characters by the same site. In IGN's Final Fantasy reader's choice, also written by Smith, Sephiroth was placed fourth, with commentary focusing on his activities in the game's plot. In a retrospective on Final Fantasy antagonists, GamesRadar listed Sephiroth as their top pick, citing his developed motives and acts of evil.
