5|$|Maddy had {{recently}} been transferred to Keller on surgical rotation. She continuely tried to impress Ric. But Ric kept taking his frustrations out on <b>her</b> <b>because</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> friends with Tom O' Dowd.

5|$|Upon recommissioning in mid-1914, she {{was briefly}} {{assigned}} to the 6th Cruiser Squadron in August before being {{assigned to the}} 4th Cruiser Squadron to reinforce Cradock's forces. He transferred his flag to <b>her</b> <b>because</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> faster than his previous flagship. Cradock's command {{was transferred to the}} coast of South America later that month at his own suggestion to better hunt for the German ships preying upon British merchant ships. His ships were generally unsuccessful in this and he moved his squadron further south in late September to search for the East Asia Squadron, under the command of Vice Admiral Graf Maximilian von Spee, in the vicinity of Cape Horn and the Strait of Magellan in accordance to his orders from the Admiralty.|$|E
5|$|The {{disaster}} left Henry with no legitimate son, {{his various}} nephews now the closest male heirs. Henry {{announced he would}} take a new wife, Adeliza of Louvain, opening up {{the prospect of a}} new royal son, and the two were married at Windsor Castle in January 1121. Henry appears to have chosen <b>her</b> <b>because</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> attractive and came from a prestigious noble line. Adela seems to have been fond of Henry and joined him in his travels, probably to maximise the chances of her conceiving a child. The White Ship disaster initiated fresh conflict in Wales, where the drowning of Richard, Earl of Chester, encouraged a rebellion led by Maredudd ap Bleddyn. Henry intervened in North Wales that summer with an army and, although the King was hit by a Welsh arrow, the campaign reaffirmed royal power across the region.|$|E

25|$|Caroline Elizabeth Sarah Norton (22 March 1808 – 15 June 1877) was an English social {{reformer}} {{and author}} {{active in the}} early and mid-nineteenth century. Caroline left her husband in 1836, following which her husband sued her close friend Lord Melbourne, the then Whig Prime Minister, for criminal conversation. The jury threw out the claim, but Caroline was unable to obtain a divorce and was denied access to her three sons. Caroline's intense campaigning led to {{the passing of the}} Custody of Infants Act 1839, the Matrimonial Causes Act 1857 and the Married Women's Property Act 1870. Caroline modelled for the fresco of Justice in the House of Lords by Daniel Maclise, who chose <b>her</b> <b>because</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> seen by many as a famous victim of injustice.|$|E
25|$|Scholars differ {{about why}} Dowager Queen Elizabeth {{spent the last}} five years of her life living at Bermondsey Abbey, to which she retired on 12 February 1487. Among her modern biographers, David Baldwin {{believes}} that Henry VII forced her retreat from the Court, while Arlene Okerlund presents evidence from July 1486 that she was already planning her retirement from court to live a religious, contemplative life at Bermondsey Abbey. Another suggestion is that her retreat to Bermondsey was forced on <b>her</b> <b>because</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> in some way involved in the 1487 Yorkist rebellion of Lambert Simnel, or at least was seen as a potential ally of the rebels, a curious role for her to take if she was convinced that both her sons had died in 1483.|$|E
25|$|Also {{during this}} time, Kelly's {{mother had a}} new baby, Erin, got married, and put Kelly's {{childhood}} home up for sale. Self-consciousness over her figure, along with the anxiety she began to feel, caused her to lash out emotionally, abuse diet pills, and briefly lose control over her life. The character's physical appearance is shown to {{play a part in}} her development. At various points of the series, she won the title of Spring Princess at a dance, and was voted her school's most beautiful girl. Kelly is aware of her appeal, but not to the point of conceit; instead, she is sometimes shown to be troubled by it. At one point, she entered a phase where she felt that no one took her seriously, which was heightened when Dylan gave his manuscript to Andrea for review instead of to her. During this time, she began to feel that people only liked <b>her</b> <b>because</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> physically attractive.|$|E

500|$|In 1822 {{at the age}} of 24, Beverley [...] "ran away" [...] from Monticello and was not pursued. His sister Harriet Hemings, 21, {{followed}} in the same year. The overseer Edmund Bacon said that he gave her $50 (US$ in [...] dollars) and put her on a stagecoach to the North, presumably to join her brother. In his memoir, published posthumously, Bacon said Harriet was [...] "near white and very beautiful", and that people said Jefferson freed <b>her</b> <b>because</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> his daughter. Madison Hemings said Beverley and Harriet each entered white society in Washington, DC, and each married well.|$|E
500|$|I {{needed to}} {{maintain}} a very strong relationship with Tommy [...] During that period, {{the beginning of their}} end, I had to stay away more than normal from <b>her</b> <b>because</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> going through a rough time. She felt that shutting her relationship with Tommy was also a cleansing of who she was. She felt that part of what she was dropping was the shmaltzy pop singer ballad kind of stuff he was adamant about. I had to make my exit and say 'Mariah, you need to redefine yourself, that's fine. I'm here doing what I do and if and when you want to come back and do it again, I'm here.|$|E
500|$|With {{the return}} of heavy metal in the charts {{worldwide}} and the diffusion on the internet of hundreds of webzines and fanzines dedicated to hard rock, Doro became again a star of the metal scene, highly requested {{all over the world}} and treated by the media as a revered veteran and inspiration for new female singers. Her career and commitment are held in high esteem by the new generation of female heavy metal singers. As Floor Jansen of After Forever stated in a 2007 interview, to duet with Doro [...] "was a huge honor and we chose <b>her</b> <b>because</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> a pioneer of the female fronted scene". Doro herself was apparently aware early in her career to have the role [...] "to give other women self-confidence" [...] in the metal world, acting as a pioneer for female fans and musicians.|$|E

500|$|In September 2013, Bennett {{explained}} {{that for the}} album, they recorded [...] "all great standards, quality songs; George Gershwin, Cole Porter, Jerome Kern, Irving Berlin, songs like that. With a big swingin' band and great, great, jazz artists playing." [...] He told Chicago Tribune that his main intention of recording the album with Gaga was to introduce the jazz standards to a younger audience, believing that the tracks had a [...] "universal appeal" [...] and [...] "timeless quality" [...] about them. Gaga told The Daily Telegraph that with her earlier releases like The Fame (2008), The Fame Monster (2009), and Born This Way (2011), she felt unable to achieve her full vocal potential. She described Cheek to Cheek as a [...] "rebellious" [...] and [...] "liberating" [...] album for <b>her</b> <b>because</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> able to sing without worrying about record producers engineering it for radio.|$|E
500|$|Observers {{regularly}} noted {{incidents of}} marital discord between Anne and James. The so-called Gowrie conspiracy of 1600, {{in which the}} young Earl of Gowrie, John Ruthven, and his brother Alexander Ruthven were killed by James' attendants for a supposed assault on the King, triggered the dismissal of their sisters Beatrix and Barbara Ruthven as ladies-in-waiting to Anne, with whom they were [...] "in chiefest credit." [...] The Queen, who was five months pregnant, refused {{to get out of}} bed unless they were reinstated and stayed there for two days, also refusing to eat. When James tried to command her, she warned him to take care how he treated <b>her</b> <b>because</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> not the Earl of Gowrie. James placated her for the moment by paying a famous acrobat to entertain her, but she never gave up, and her stubborn support for the Ruthvens over the next three years was taken seriously enough by the government to be regarded as a security issue. In 1602, after discovering that Anne had smuggled Beatrix Ruthven into Holyrood, James carried out a cross-examination of the entire household; in 1603, he finally decided to grant Beatrix Ruthven a pension of £200.|$|E
500|$|In April 2001, Toyah was {{the focus}} of one of Coronation Streets most {{controversial}} storylines. After enjoying a night out with her friend Sam Kingston (Scott Wright), Toyah was raped, beaten and left for dead in an alleyway by an unknown assailant as she walked home alone. The storyline began during a special 45-minute episode that was broadcast during the Easter weekend. It marked the first time in forty years that Coronation Street had included a rape. Viewers saw Toyah being grabbed by her attacker, but not the actual act of rape. Instead Toyah's [...] "bruised body" [...] was found by Jason Grimshaw (Ryan Thomas) just as he set out for an early morning run. Jason took a [...] "traumatised" [...] Toyah back to her house, where she told her mother what had happened. Toyah then had to repeat the story to the police and revealed that she did not know who raped <b>her</b> <b>because</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> semi-conscious during the attack. Toyah underwent an examination and counselling at the local hospital. The scenes were shot at the St Mary's Hospital Sexual Assault Centre in Manchester, where the writers spent four months researching victims' experiences and working with the clinical director and the staff to get the scenario right.|$|E

500|$|In 2000, the German Stern {{magazine}} {{published the}} results of its investigation of the asylum case. It asserted that several rejection letters which the woman had submitted {{as part of her}} asylum application– ostensibly from potential employers who were rejecting <b>her</b> <b>because</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> a Scientologist– had in fact been written by fellow Scientologists at her request and that of Scientology's Office of Special Affairs, and that she was in personal financial trouble and about to go on trial for tax evasion at the time she applied for asylum. On a 2000 visit to Clearwater, Florida, Ursula Caberta of the Scientology Task Force for the Hamburg Interior Authority likewise alleged that the asylum case had been part of an [...] "orchestrated effort" [...] by Scientology undertaken [...] "for political gain", and [...] "a spectacular abuse of the U.S. system". German expatriate Scientologists resident in Clearwater, in turn, accused Caberta of stoking a [...] "hate campaign" [...] in Germany that had [...] "ruined the lives and fortunes of scores of Scientologists" [...] and maintained that Scientologists had not [...] "exaggerated their plight for political gain in the United States." [...] Mark Rathbun, a (former) top Church of Scientology official, said that although Scientology had not orchestrated the case, [...] "there would have been nothing improper if it had." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{producers}} {{sought to}} cast unknowns. [...] Though many {{had played in}} previous Hammerstein or Rodgers works, only one, Jean Casto (cast as carousel owner Mrs. Mullin, and a veteran of Pal Joey), had ever played on Broadway before. [...] It proved harder to cast the ensemble than the leads, due to the war—Rodgers told his casting director, John Fearnley, that the sole qualification for a dancing boy was that he be alive. [...] Rodgers and Hammerstein reassembled much of the creative team that had made Oklahoma! a success, including director Rouben Mamoulian and choreographer Agnes de Mille. [...] Miles White was the costume designer while Jo Mielziner (who had not worked on Oklahoma!) was the scenic and lighting designer. [...] Even though Oklahoma! orchestrator Russell Bennett had informed Rodgers that he was unavailable to work on Carousel due to a radio contract, Rodgers insisted he do the work in his spare time. [...] He orchestrated [...] "The Carousel Waltz" [...] and [...] "(When I Marry) Mister Snow" [...] before finally being replaced by Don Walker. [...] A new member of the creative team was Trude Rittmann, who arranged the dance music. [...] Rittmann initially felt that Rodgers mistrusted <b>her</b> <b>because</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> a woman, and found him difficult to work with, but the two worked together on Rodgers' shows until the 1970s.|$|E
500|$|While {{working for}} the U.S. Steel Hour, a {{colleague}} left {{to work for the}} educational television station WGBH-TV in Boston; her reaction was life-changing: [...] "What?! [...] There is educational television?!" [...] She later stated, [...] "I knew that I was born to be in educational television; it was St. Paul on the highway". [...] In 1961, she began to track the progress of a court case in which a New York City nonprofit group was attempting to acquire Newark, New Jersey-based independent station WNTA-TV (channel 13), which would become the precursor of PBS station WNET, the first public television station in the New York area. [...] When channel 13 became non-commercial two years later as WNDT, Joan Ganz applied for a position as the station's publicist, but the general manager told her they needed producers. [...] "I can produce", she told him, even though she had no experience in producing television shows. [...] She later stated, [...] "I've never been qualified for any job I've been hired for". [...] According to television historian Cary O'Dell, WNDT hired her because of the ties she had made through her political activities and associations with Partisan Review. [...] Joan Ganz later said during an interview with the Archive of American Television that the transition to becoming a documentary producer was not difficult for <b>her</b> <b>because</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> well-read and aware of the issues of the day, adding, [...] "I felt like I'd died and gone to heaven, dealing with foreign policy and domestic policy and civil rights, which became the great passion in those years for me".|$|E

2500|$|In 1849 Daniel Maclise {{finished}} his fresco of Justice in the House of Lords, for which Norton had modelled. He chose <b>her</b> <b>because</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> {{seen by many}} as a famous victim of injustice. Caroline's old friend, Lord Melbourne, opposed the reforms she fought for. He was scolded for his opposition by Queen Victoria; the Queen wrote that he defended his actions, stating: [...] "I don't think you should give a woman too much right...there should not be two conflicting powers...a man ought to have the right in a family." ...|$|E
2500|$|Her natural {{intelligence}} {{and breadth of}} knowledge always impressed her teachers, who were nonetheless disappointed in <b>her</b> <b>because</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> a poor student. Her favorite subject was [...] "natural philosophy," [...] especially what later would become known as physics. In 1878, the eighteen-year-old enrolled in classes at the Rhode Island School of Design with the monetary help of her absent father, and subsequently supported herself as an artist of trade cards. She was a tutor, and encouraged others to expand their artistic creativity. She was also a painter.|$|E
2500|$|On September 11, 2014, African-American actress Danièle Watts was {{temporarily}} detained by the LAPD {{when she and}} her boyfriend were in Studio City. Watts accused the officers who stopped her of racially profiling <b>her</b> <b>because</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> African-American and her boyfriend was Caucasian, claiming that they treated her as if she was a [...] "prostitute" [...] and that the officers had been disrespectful to <b>her</b> <b>because</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> African-American. LAPD Sergeant Jim Parker {{who was one of the}} two officers accused by Watts of misconduct, released a personal audio recording of the entire incident to TMZ. The recording showed that police had received a 911 call about lewd acts in a car and the couple who were described to have committed the lewd acts fit Watts' and her boyfriend's description. It also showed that when officers arrived on the scene, Watts' boyfriend cooperated with police but Watts refused to cooperate and identify herself, accused the officers of racism, and ignored officers requests and walked away from them leading to her being handcuffed and temporarily detained. Following the release of the recording, local civil rights activists called for Watts to apologize to the LAPD for falsely accusing them of racial profiling but Watts refused. The two officers were cleared of any wrongdoing by the department shortly after the release of the audio recordings.|$|E
