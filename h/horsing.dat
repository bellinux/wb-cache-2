This however, is unsuccessful as the girls run up to Bieber; he then takes pictures and signs autographs with the girls. While this is happening Bieber takes an interest with one particular girl asking her to meet him later on, to which she agrees. As the song starts playing Bieber is seen sitting in an empty auditorium playing the piano and singing. When Bieber's date shows up they sneak into an empty theater where they are seen; holding hands, <b>horsing</b> around on the theater's seats, and sliding down banisters. At the ending of the video they are seen engaging in a playful back-alley water fight and eventually collapse into each other's arms while Bieber is playing the piano back inside the theater.|$|E

40|$|The {{welfare of}} {{recreational}} <b>horses</b> in Victoria, Australia {{has become an}} increasingly important issue, as evident by their high representation in welfare investigations. A substantial proportion of <b>horse</b> welfare problems appear due to recreational <b>horse</b> owner mismanagement, {{as a result of}} ignorance rather than intentional abuse. According to the Theory of Planned Behaviour (TPB), a recreational <b>horse</b> owner’s attitudes towards <b>horse</b> ownership are likely to influence their behaviour in terms of the implementation of <b>horse</b> husbandry and management practices. Subsequently, these recreational <b>horse</b> owner husbandry and management behaviours may impact on the welfare of the <b>horse.</b> This study examined recreational <b>horse</b> ownership in Victoria and investigated the relationships between <b>horse</b> owner attributes and <b>horse</b> welfare outcomes. The results of a random telephone survey reported the observed incidence of <b>horse</b> ownership to be 3. 5 %, suggesting that as many as 176, 000 people in Victoria may own recreational <b>horses.</b> Furthermore, on average each recreational <b>horse</b> owner owned four <b>horses,</b> which indicates there could potentially be in excess of 600, 000 recreational <b>horses</b> in Victoria. <b>Horse</b> owners typically provided their <b>horses</b> with their daily primary care. Consequently, it was the <b>horse</b> owner who was responsible for the welfare of these <b>horses.</b> <b>Horse</b> owners largely reported the appropriate performance of <b>horse</b> husbandry and management practices and a low incidence of <b>horse</b> injury and illness. However, on average, <b>horse</b> owners spent less than 30 minutes per day interacting with their <b>horses.</b> Furthermore, at least one quarter of <b>horse</b> owners who provided the daily primary care, failed to interact with their <b>horses</b> on a daily basis. These findings suggest that a limited degree of human-horse interaction rather than the inappropriate performance of other <b>horse</b> husbandry and management practices could potentially be the primary source of Victorian <b>horse</b> owner mismanagement. The observation-based results of on-site inspections provided evidence of relationships between <b>horse</b> owner attributes and <b>horse</b> welfare outcomes. The appropriate performance of <b>horse</b> husbandry and management behaviour by <b>horse</b> owners was associated with positive <b>horse</b> welfare outcomes. Furthermore, a <b>horse</b> owner’s appropriate performance of <b>horse</b> husbandry and management behaviour was predicted by favourable beliefs, which underlie <b>horse</b> owner attitudes towards <b>horse</b> husbandry and management behaviour. In addition, knowledge-based background factors appeared to influence <b>horse</b> owner beliefs about <b>horse</b> owner husbandry and management behaviour. These findings are in accordance with the literature and the TPB (Ajzen, 1985), and indicate the potential to predict a <b>horse</b> owner’s husbandry and management behaviour from their attitude towards the behaviour in question. In addition, a qualitative investigation identified <b>horse</b> owner opinions on the key issues associated with recreational <b>horse</b> ownership in Victoria. Consequently, the results from the three components of the study demonstrate the opportunity to manipulate the human-horse relationship via targeted education and training programs in order to potentially both improve the husbandry and management behaviour of recreational <b>horse</b> owners and reduce the incidence of poor welfare in recreational <b>horses.</b> Further research is, however, required to not only demonstrate the sequential nature of the human-horse relationship and provide evidence of causal relationships, but to determine the effectiveness of education and training programs in improving the welfare of recreational <b>horses.</b> The results reported in this thesis provide what {{is believed to be the}} first comprehensive account of recreational <b>horse</b> ownership. It offers a valuable insight into the human-horse relationship and its possible influence on recreational <b>horse</b> owner behaviour and <b>horse</b> welfare. <b>Horse</b> owners provide the primary care for their <b>horses</b> and consequently are the major determinants of the welfare of these <b>horses.</b> Although the results of this study are particularly relevant to Victoria, they also should be highly relevant to recreational <b>horse</b> ownership elsewhere. As in Australia, these results have implications for recreational <b>horse</b> welfare in any recreational <b>horse</b> population where recreational <b>horse</b> owners provide the primary care for their <b>horses...</b>|$|R

6000|$|This I proved pretty {{clearly at}} the age of thirteen, when my aunt Biddy Brady's legacy of L100 came in to mamma, who thought to employ the sum on my education, and sent me to Doctor Tobias Tickler's famous academy at Ballywhacket--Backwhacket, as my uncle used to call it. But six weeks after I had been {{consigned}} to his reverence, I suddenly made my appearance again at Castle Brady, having walked forty miles from the odious place, and left the Doctor in a state near upon apoplexy. The fact was, that at taw, prison-bars, or boxing, I was {{at the head of the}} school, but could not be brought to excel in the classics; and after having been flogged seven times, without its doing me the least good in my Latin, I refused to submit altogether (finding it useless) to an eighth application of the rod. 'Try some other way, sir,' said I, when he was for <b>horsing</b> me once more; but he wouldn't; whereon, and to defend myself, I flung a slate at him, and knocked down a Scotch usher with a leaden inkstand. All the lads huzza'd at this, and some or the servants wanted to stop me; but taking out a large clasp-knife that my cousin Nora had given me, I swore I would plunge it into the waistcoat of the first man who dared to balk me, and faith they let me pass on. I slept that night twenty miles off Ballywhacket, at the house of a cottier, who gave me potatoes and milk, and to whom I gave a hundred guineas after, when I came to visit Ireland in my days of greatness. I wish I had the money now. But what's the use of regret? I have had many a harder bed than that I shall sleep on to-night, and many a scantier meal than honest Phil Murphy gave me on the evening I ran away from school. So six weeks' was all the schooling I ever got. And I say this to let parents know the value of it; for though I have met more learned book-worms in the world, especially a great hulking, clumsy, blear-eyed old doctor, whom they called Johnson, and who lived in a court off Fleet Street, in London, yet I pretty soon silenced him in an argument (at 'Button's Coffeehouse'); and in that, and in poetry, and what I call natural philosophy, or the science of life, and in riding, music, leaping, the small-sword, the knowledge of a horse, or a main of cocks, and the manners of an accomplished gentleman and a man of fashion, I may say for myself that Redmond Barry has seldom found his equal. 'Sir,' said I to Mr. Johnson, on the occasion I allude to--he was accompanied by a Mr. Buswell of Scotland, and I was presented to the club by a Mr. Goldsmith, a countryman of my own--'Sir,' said I, in reply to the schoolmaster's great thundering quotation in Greek, 'you fancy you know a great deal more than me, because you quote your Aristotle and your Pluto; but can you tell me which horse will win at Epsom Downs next week?--Can you run six miles without breathing?--Can you shoot the ace of spades ten times without missing? If so, talk about Aristotle and Pluto to me.' ...|$|E
