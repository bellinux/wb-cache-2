5000|$|The simplest, {{and very}} ancient, valve {{is simply a}} freely hinged flap which drops to obstruct <b>fluid</b> (<b>gas</b> or liquid) flow in one direction, but is pushed open by flow in the {{opposite}} direction. This is called a check valve, as it prevents or [...] "checks" [...] the flow in one direction. Modern control valves may regulate pressure or flow downstream and operate on sophisticated automation systems.|$|E
50|$|Volume is the {{quantity}} of three-dimensional space enclosed by a closed surface, for example, the space that a substance (solid, liquid, gas, or plasma) or shape occupies or contains. Volume is often quantified numerically using the SI derived unit, the cubic metre. The volume of a container is generally understood to be {{the capacity of the}} container; i. e., the amount of <b>fluid</b> (<b>gas</b> or liquid) that the container could hold, rather than the amount of space the container itself displaces.|$|E
50|$|A {{fluidized}} bed reactor (FBR) {{is a type}} of reactor device {{that can be used to}} carry out a variety of multiphase chemical reactions. In this type of reactor, a <b>fluid</b> (<b>gas</b> or liquid) is passed through a solid granular material (usually a catalyst possibly shaped as tiny spheres) at high enough velocities to suspend the solid and cause it to behave as though it were a fluid. This process, known as fluidization, imparts many important advantages to the FBR. As a result, the {{fluidized bed}} reactor is now used in many industrial applications.|$|E

5000|$|Heat {{convection}} {{occurs when}} bulk flow of a <b>fluid</b> (<b>gas</b> or liquid) carries heat {{along with the}} flow of matter in the fluid. The flow of fluid may be forced by external processes, or sometimes (in gravitational fields) by buoyancy forces caused when thermal energy expands the fluid (for example in a fire plume), thus influencing its own transfer. The latter process is often called [...] "natural convection". All convective processes also move heat partly by diffusion, as well. Another form of convection is forced convection. In this case the fluid is forced to flow by use of a pump, fan or other mechanical means.|$|E
50|$|The Otto {{cycle is}} a {{description}} {{of what happens to}} a mass of gas as it is subjected to changes of pressure, temperature, volume, addition of heat, and removal of heat. The mass of gas that is subjected to those changes is called the system. The system, in this case, is defined to be the <b>fluid</b> (<b>gas)</b> within the cylinder. By describing the changes that take place within the system, it will also describe in inverse, the system's effect on the environment. In the case of the Otto cycle, the effect will be to produce enough net work from the system so as to propel an automobile and its occupants in the environment.|$|E

50|$|Archimedes' principle, {{physical}} law of buoyancy, {{stating that}} any body completely or partially submerged in a <b>fluid</b> (<b>gas</b> or liquid) at rest is acted upon by an upward, or buoyant, force {{the magnitude of}} which {{is equal to the}} weight of the fluid displaced by the body. The volume of displaced fluid is equivalent to the volume of an object fully immersed in a fluid or to that fraction of the volume below the surface for an object partially submerged in a liquid. The weight of the displaced portion of the fluid is equivalent to the magnitude of the buoyant force. The buoyant force on a body floating in a liquid or gas is also equivalent in magnitude to the weight of the floating object and is opposite in direction; the object neither rises nor sinks. If the weight of an object is less than that of the displaced fluid, the object rises, {{as in the case of}} a block of wood that is released beneath the surface of water or a helium-filled balloon that is let loose in air. An object heavier than the amount of the fluid it displaces, though it sinks when released, has an apparent weight loss equal to the weight of the fluid displaced. In fact, in some accurate weighing, a correction must be made in order to compensate for the buoyancy effect of the surrounding air. The buoyant force, which always opposes gravity, is nevertheless caused by gravity. Fluid pressure increases with depth because of the (gravitational) weight of the fluid above. This increasing pressure applies a force on a submerged object that increases with depth. The result is buoyancy.|$|E
