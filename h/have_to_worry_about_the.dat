25|$|Some {{governments have}} begun to {{approach}} slums as a possible opportunity to urban development by slum upgrading. This approach was inspired {{in part by the}} theoretical writings of John Turner in 1972. The approach seeks to upgrade the slum with basic infrastructure such as sanitation, safe drinking water, safe electricity distribution, paved roads, rain water drainage system, and bus/metro stops. The assumption behind this approach is that if slums are given basic services and tenure security – that is, the slum will not be destroyed and slum residents will not be evicted, then the residents will rebuild their own housing, engage their slum community to live better, and over time attract investment from government organizations and businesses. Turner argued to demolish the housing, but to improve the environment: if governments can clear existing slums of unsanitary human waste, polluted water and litter, and from muddy unlit lanes, they do not <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>worry</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> shanty housing. Squatters have shown great organizational skills in terms of land management and will maintain the infrastructure that is provided.|$|E

500|$|... "Secrets That I Never Want to Know" [...] {{was written}} by {{executive}} producer Bob Daily and directed by David Grossman. Filming for the episode began on July 11, 2011. The episode {{is only one of}} two season premieres Cherry did not write himself, as he took on a reduced production role for the eighth season in order to develop several new series while Daily was given more creative authority. According to Daily, the series' ending allowed the writers more artistic freedom while developing storylines. [...] "You get to do story lines that you wouldn't otherwise do because you don't <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>worry</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> ramifications," [...] he explained. [...] "So people can move, people can die, people can have babies and you don't <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>worry</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> babies growing up." [...] The episode introduced Bree's blackmail storyline, which recalls the first season's mystery storyline surrounding series narrator Mary Alice's suicide. Daily stated that the similarity between the storylines was intentional: [...] "We’re kind of just diving into the DNA of the series a little bit. Are there any unanswered questions floating around out there? Any characters we need to check in with one more time?" [...] Cherry noted that the [...] "mystery hearkens back to the first season, going back to the roots of Mary Alice [...] This feels right for that mystery to take us out this year." [...] Brenda Strong commented that [...] "It’s the smartest way to end the series, to finish where you began. I think it really cements it in the psyche of the audience and gives them a sense of completion." ...|$|E

500|$|Seattle Weeklys Joe Williams {{enjoyed the}} song, writing [...] "even with the slow, {{bubbling}} beat and energetic keyboards, topped with top-notch delivery by Jay and Kay, it's Redding {{in the background}} that gives the single its true life and flair." [...] Josiah Hughes of Exclaim! magazine commented that [...] "if the over-the-top aggression of [...] "H•A•M" [...] had you worried {{that this would be}} a Waka Flocka ripoff, fear not, as [...] "Otis" [...] makes the most of its Otis Redding sample with some soulful feel-good boom-bap." [...] Sam Gould The Independent remarked [...] "having seen oddball rap collective Odd Future become the talking point of the blogosphere, Eminem and old partner-in-crime Royce da 5'9" [...] start work on their own bruising , and hazy vibe rappers Wiz Khalifa and Curren$y take steps in the same direction, Jay and Ye have recognised the throne is far from unchallenged, and have come together in the most remarkable dual alliance since André 3000 and Big Boi became Outkast." [...] The New York Observer writer Foster Kamer mused, [...] "remember early Kanye? These guys finally do. 'Otis' is the perfect anti-single for this album, because it's a reminder that what we always loved about these two collaborating is still very much there. Not only do they not need hooks, neither of them need to remind us that they don't. There was that first line of My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy, 'I fantasized 'bout this back in Chicago,' and then, the relief after it, where you didn't <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>worry</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> rest of that album", and Billboard claimed [...] "Otis gets better with each play".|$|E
2500|$|The tone of Supernatural {{was heavily}} {{influenced}} by films such as Poltergeist—having the horror happen in a family setting rather than remote location—and Evil Dead II and An American Werewolf in London—having bits of comedy mixed in. Commenting on the former, Kripke said, [...] "It's the idea that horror can happen in your own backyard. How many viewers <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>worry</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> vampire in the gothic castle?" [...] "It's always been a show about family." [...] Other influences include The Two Sisters and Asian horror films The Eye, Ju-on, and Ring.|$|E

In 680, Constantine IV launched a naval expedition to drive them back— the expedition failed and the Bulgars grew even bolder. Unable to stop them by force, Constantine settled for a humiliating, but not disastrous treaty whereby [...] "protection" [...] money had to be paid to the Bulgar King. The greatest implication of this treaty was that Byzantium would no longer <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>worry</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> Bulgars for the rest of Constantine's reign.|$|E

2500|$|Casting {{began in}} early August 2009, with open auditions held in various states. Jesse Eisenberg was first {{announced}} to {{be attached to}} the project in September 2009. (Coincidentally, in an interview with Diane Sawyer on ABC's World News with Diane Sawyer, Zuckerberg revealed that Eisenberg's cousin, Eric Fisher, was a Facebook product designer.) Several days later, Justin Timberlake and Andrew Garfield were confirmed to portray the roles of Sean Parker and Eduardo Saverin, respectively. In October 2009, Brenda Song, Rooney Mara, Armie Hammer, Shelby Young, and Josh Pence were cast. Max Minghella and Dakota Johnson were also confirmed to star in the film. In a 2009 interview with The Baltimore Sun, Eisenberg said, [...] "Even though I've gotten to be in some wonderful movies, this character seems so much more overtly insensitive in so many ways that seem more real to me in the best way. I don't often get cast as insensitive people, so it feels very comfortable: fresh and exciting, as if you never <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>worry</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> audience.

60|$|Now that is {{just the}} way with a lot of people. The more they have and the less they <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>worry</b> <b>about,</b> <b>the</b> more discontented they become, and at last they are {{positively}} unhappy. There was little Danny Meadow Mouse, living out on the Green Meadows; he was happy all the livelong day, and yet he had no safe castle like the dear Old Briar-patch where he could always be safe. Every minute of every day Danny had to keep his eyes wide open and his wits working their very quickest, for any minute he was likely to be in danger. Old Man Coyote or Reddy Fox or Granny Fox or Digger the Badger or Mr. Blacksnake was likely to come creeping through the grass any time, and they are always hungry for a fat Meadow Mouse. And as if that weren't worry enough, Danny had to watch the sky, too, for Old Whitetail the Marsh Hawk, or his cousin Redtail, or Blacky the Crow, each of whom would be glad of a Meadow Mouse dinner. Yet in spite of all this, Danny was happy and never once lost his appetite.|$|E
