In total, on a typical order, StubHub earns 20-25% of the purchase price of every ticket sold: buyers typically pay 10% more than the listed price and sellers receive 10-15% less than their listed price depending on certain seller metrics and bonuses.

[...] It [...] "serves as a middleman between {{buyers and}} sellers, deriving revenue from commissions on ticket sales." [...] Local agencies may trade smaller profit margins from selling {{to a larger}} volume reseller rather than risk not finding a retail buyer for the same ticket. StubHub, described by The Wall Street Journal as [...] "far and away the biggest player in the $6 billion market for reselling live-event tickets", {{is a way for}} ticket sellers to gain a profit, but unlike eBay, there is no auctioning involved.Many sell their extra tickets on StubHub at a profit, often tickets which are in high demand which are difficult to find. While concert tickets can get expensive when the demand is high, {{more than half of all}} tickets sold on StubHub go for at or below face value. Tsakalakis has stated that he believes the ticket market is not a level playing field for the average person, in that before a ticket goes on sale, promoters have already sold the vast majority of seats to everyone from fan club members, American Express card holders and ticket brokers. He has said, [...] "There is this whole mentality within concerts that if it doesn't sell out right away it's not a hit. It just doesn't make sense. Nothing works that way. There isn't a supplier out there that says, 'The first day I put my product out there I want all of it to sell out and I don't want to have any more supply.' What business works that way?" [...] Sellers choose what they want to charge for the ticket. A range of tickets are listed, mainly sporting, concert, theater, and other live entertainment events. Music categories are divided into Classical and Vocal, Country and Folk, Dance and Electronica, Jazz, Blues and RnB, Rock, Pop and Hip-Hop, and World and New Age music. Theatre and comedy is organized by Cirque du Soleil, Classical music and opera, dance/ballet, family, festivals and fairs, film festival, museum, musicals, play, and other/miscellaneous.

40|$|We {{conducted}} 80 auctions on eBay. Forty {{of these}} auctions were for various popular music CDs while the remaining 40 auctions were for video games for Microsoft’s Xbox gaming console. The revenue equivalence theorem states that any auction form {{having the same}} effective reserve price yields the same expected revenue. The effective reserve price on eBay consists of three components: the opening bid amount, the secret reserve amount, and the shipping and <b>handling</b> <b>charge.</b> We set no secret reserve price and varied the opening bid and the shipping and <b>handling</b> <b>charge</b> to keep the overall reserve level fixed. When the effective reserve was $ 4, auctions with a low opening bid and high shipping charges attracted more bidders, earlier bidding, and yielded higher revenue than those with a high opening bid and low shipping charges. Under the effective reserve of $ 8 treatments, the same results hold only for Xbox games. Unlike the other treatments, where the reserve represents less than 30 % of the retail price of the item, for CDs, the $ 8 effective reserve represents over 50 % of the retail price of the item. In this treatment, we find no systematic difference {{in the number of}} bidders attracted to the auction or revenues as a function of how the effective reserve is allocated between opening bid and shipping charges.
