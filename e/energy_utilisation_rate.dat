40|$|Apart from air, {{water and}} food, energy {{is the most}} {{important}} item for human survival. It is essential for meeting various domestic, industrial and commercial obligations. Kerosene, electricity, gas and fuelwood are however, the major sources of domestic energy in Nigeria. The paper examines the role and challenges {{associated with the use of}} fuelwood in Nigeria. Desk research on <b>energy</b> <b>utilisation,</b> <b>rate</b> of deforestation and alternative sources of energy provided data for the paper. Content analysis of available data was used in the preparation of the paper. The paper revealed that domestic energy accounts for more than 50 per cent of the total energy consumed in Nigeria. The paper further shows that fuelwood provides energy for more than 60 per cent Nigerians and also responsible for meeting 80 per cent of domestic energy needs. Again, majority of Nigerians adopted fuelwood for meeting domestic energy needs due to the high level of poverty, inadequate infrastructure and lack of political-will to address the country’s energy challenges. The paper therefore recommends the use of gas, kerosene and electricity for domestic needs in order to conserve the nation’s forest resources, prevents loss of biodiversity and conserve the ground water...|$|E
40|$|Within the {{building}} sector, supermarkets {{are responsible for}} 3 - 5 % of the electricity consumed in developed countries. To mitigate the associated environmental impact of this consumption, a growing interest has been developed in local {{combined heat and power}} (CHP) systems, due to their higher total efficiencies. However, CHP efficiency is highly dependent on the thermal output utilisation. In food retail buildings, where refrigeration dominates {{the building}} energy use, a promising means for utilising the thermal output is by using this to operate absorption chillers. This paper reports on a technical feasibility and financial viability study of an ammoniawater absorption chiller, coupled to a CHP unit, that is also compared to a conventional electrically-driven vapour-compression equivalent. A typical distribution centre located in the UK is selected as a case-study. Three alternative systems are considered: i) a conventional grid connected system; ii) a CHP system; and iii) a trigeneration system. Typical daily cooling, heating and hot-water demand data are provided on an hourly basis, and the system’s ability to cover these loads is assessed. The results indicate that the trigeneration system can reduce the electricity demand by 16 % compared to the baseline system, while offering a 48 % annual energy cost saving. The system’s primary <b>energy</b> <b>utilisation</b> <b>rate</b> exceeds 60 %, while the power-to-heat ratio of the building demand improves from 7. 0 to 0. 9, thereby more closely matching the CHP system generation profile. Furthermore, the trigeneration system achieves CHPQA rating of 106, and it is qualified for enhanced capital allowance for the CHP plant. The results highlight the great energy and cost savings potentials of integrating trigeneration systems in energy-intensive buildings...|$|E

A research project {{has been carried out}} to provide BG plc with service life predictions of lithium primary batteries capable of supplying a continuous pulsed power supply to two new electronic domestic gas meters over a desired design life of 11. 5 years, in UK weather conditions. The paper study includes investigations of the range of suitable lithium technologies and test methods, and detailed reviews of the discharge processes, polarisation and self-discharge failure modes of the lithium thionyl chloride system. A new multi-channel load test rig and a high resolution measurement system, and software analysis tools were designed and constructed, and some 440 accelerated discharge tests were carried out at different stress levels on 4 cell types. The results provide a unique database of the voltage/temperature/load trends through discharge, and generate a ranking order of performance. Basic statistical analyses have been carried out to quantify the variability of performance trends. A hitherto unreported behaviour pattern is characterised. Qualitative models are postulated to account for deviations from normal behaviour exhibited by two cell types. The analysis suggests that catholyte additives could predispose a system to early failure (due to modification of the crystal structure of the reaction products), and that manufacturing tolerances define the degree of failure. Mathematical models of self-discharge rate for both low and medium rate discharge were developed from laboratory measurements. Meter load profiles were also measured, which together with the self-discharge model enabled prediction of operational <b>energy</b> <b>utilisation</b> <b>rates.</b> A sample of 50 batteries was extracted from customers homes, after operating in the field for periods of up to 2 years, and the battery capacity loss rates were measured by the residual capacity method. A comparison of predicted and actual capacity <b>utilisation</b> <b>rates</b> yielded a discrepancy of approximately 1. 28. Analysis implied that the source of the discrepancy could be adduced to an under estimate of the impact of self-discharge, but that a factor of up to six times the predicted value was required. Evidence was provided to show that self-discharge rate under operational stresses could be significantly higher than that under the steady-state laboratory measurement conditions, but that that the amplitude and time constant associated with a selfdischarge peak was unknown and not predictable. Mean service lives of 14 and 10 years for the respective battery types in the two types of meter are predicted, the worst case (probability of 0. 13...|$|R

40|$|This study {{examined}} the effect of including different dietary proportions of starch, protein and lipid, in diets balanced for digestible <b>energy,</b> on the <b>utilisation</b> efficiencies of dietary energy by barramundi (Lates calcarifer). Each diet was fed at one of three ration levels (satiety, 80 % of initial satiety and 60 % of initial satiety) for a 42 -d period. Fish performance measures (weight gain, feed intake and feed conversion ratio) were all affected by dietary energy source. The efficiency of <b>energy</b> <b>utilisation</b> was significantly reduced in fish fed the starch diet relative to the other diets, {{but there were no}} significant effects between the other macronutrients. This reduction in efficiency of utilisation was derived from a multifactorial change in both protein and lipid <b>utilisation.</b> The <b>rate</b> of protein <b>utilisation</b> deteriorated as the amount of starch included in the diet increased. Lipid utilisation was most dramatically affected by inclusion levels of lipid in the diet, with diets low in lipid producing component lipid <b>utilisation</b> <b>rates</b> well above 1 · 3, which indicates substantial lipid synthesis from other energy sources. However, the energetic cost of lipid gain was as low as 0 · 65 kJ per kJ of lipid deposited, indicating that barramundi very efficiently store energy in the form of lipid, particularly from dietary starch energy. This study defines how the utilisation efficiency of dietary digestible energy by barramundi is influenced by the macronutrient source providing that energy, and that the inclusion of starch causes problems with protein utilisation in this species...|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose was}} to study {{variations}} in <b>utilisation</b> <b>rates</b> of external beam radiotherapy (EBRT) and brachytherapy (BT) for prostate cancer patients. We calculated the proportion and number of EBRT and BT given or planned within 6 months of diagnosis in 4 Dutch regions, according to stage and age in a population-based setting including 47, 259 prostate cancer patients diagnosed from 1997 until 2008. During this study period, the overall <b>utilisation</b> <b>rate</b> of EBRT remained stable at around 25 %, while the rate of BT for non-metastasized patients increased from 1 % (95 % CI: 0 - 1 %) to 12 % (11 - 13 %) in 2006 and slightly decreased towards 10 % (9 - 11 %) in 2008. From 2001 on, the overall <b>utilisation</b> <b>rate</b> of EBRT decreased significantly in one region (p < 0. 05). In this region, a sharp rise in the <b>utilisation</b> <b>rate</b> of BT for non-metastatic patients was noted to 17 % (14 - 20 %) in 2008 after a peak of 24 % (21 - 27 %) in 2006.

Variation in {{chemotherapy}} <b>utilisation</b> <b>rates</b> is particularly marked in lung cancer, {{which is the}} major {{cause of cancer death}} in many developed countries including Australia. This study aims to estimate, using the best available evidence, the proportions of patients with cancers of the lung, colon, rectum, prostate, brain, testes and leukaemia that should ideally receive chemotherapy at least once at some time during the course of their disease (the optimal <b>utilisation</b> <b>rate).</b> These optimal <b>utilisation</b> <b>rates</b> can serve as benchmarks to evaluate chemotherapy service provision for the above cancers. Methods: Models of optimal chemotherapy utilisation (optimal utilisation trees) were constructed for each of the above seven cancer sites based on indications for chemotherapy identified from evidence-based treatment guidelines. Data on the proportion of patients with clinical attributes corresponding to each branch in the tree were identified, using Australian population-based data wherever possible. The treatment indications and epidemiological data were merged using TreeAge Pro 2007 to calculate an optimal chemotherapy <b>utilisation</b> <b>rate</b> for each cancer. Sensitivity analyses were conducted {{to assess the impact of}} controversial chemotherapy indications and variations in epidemiological data on the optimal <b>utilisation</b> <b>rates.</b> In those cancers where recent actual <b>utilisation</b> <b>rates</b> were identified, the reported actual rates were compared with the calculated optimal rates. Results: The proportion of cancer patients in whom chemotherapy is indicated at least once during the course of their illness is 73 % of all lung cancer patients, 55 % of all patients with colon cancer, 64 % of rectal cancer, 72 % of brain cancer, 15 % of prostate cancer, 70 % of testicular cancer patients and 86 % of patients with leukaemia. Chemotherapy is under-utilised in the initial management of patients with lung, colon and rectal cancers. Conclusions: This study has identified areas of significant under-utilisation of chemotherapy in some of the commonest cancers in Australia. The models of optimal chemotherapy utilisation developed in this study can easily be modified to take into account any future changes in cancer incidence, stage at presentation, or treatment recommendations...|$|R

Twenty infants (mean (SE) birthweight 1314 (65) g, mean (SE) gestation 30. 9 (0. 4) weeks) were recruited to the study. Immediately after birth they were randomised to a carbohydrate intake of 8 g/kg/day (5. 5 mg/kg/minute) or 12 g/kg/day (8. 3 mg/kg/minute). After 24 hours they were changed to the alternative regimen which was continued for a further 24 hours. Fat and protein intakes were kept constant throughout the study. Indirect calorimetry was performed during each of the regimens, urine was collected for urinary nitrogen, and substrate utilisation calculated for 12 infants. The carbohydrate <b>utilisation</b> <b>rate</b> was increased during the higher carbohydrate intake. Lipid <b>utilisation</b> <b>rates</b> were significantly different, with net lipid synthesis occurring during high carbohydrate intake.

40|$|This thesis {{investigates the}} {{determination}} of the <b>rates</b> of <b>utilisation</b> of Australian free trade agreements (FTAs). The topic is important and interesting because the <b>utilisation</b> <b>rates</b> show the usage of the agreements by traders. Low <b>utilisation</b> <b>rates</b> imply that trade agreements fail in their objective. Following a review of relevant literature, the study presents data on the <b>utilisation</b> <b>rates</b> of Australia’s preferential trade agreements (PTAs) over the time frame of 2000 - 9. This work requires some care in the definition of the <b>utilisation</b> <b>rate,</b> a matter which is discussed in detail in the presentation of this part of the empirical work. It is found that <b>utilisation</b> <b>rates</b> vary a lot. The variations appear to be related to low preferential tariff margins {{and the degree to which}} there are strict rules of origin (ROO). These rules are associated with FTAs to manage the problem of trade deflection (TD). The ROO schemes of five Australian FTAs are investigated and a ROO restrictiveness index is developed and applied to these five Australian trade agreements. The main findings are that all five ROO regimes differ significantly between the agreements, indicating that ROO are negotiated according to criteria beyond their role in managing TD. A question of interest therefore arises about the set of important determinants of ROO. One hypothesis in the literature is that more restrictive ROO are negotiated in tariff lines with relatively high preferential margins. To examine and test this hypothesis in detail, a political economy (PE) model is applied. PE and TD factors are taken into account in a test of the relative importance of these different factors. The results confirm that TD concerns in form of potential transshipment are reflected by ROO design; however this is the case only for the Australian agreements with its developing country partners. The results also show that more restrictive ROO are negotiated in tariff lines with high applied tariff rates and for commodities where a potential import penetration may occur. The higher the potential competition in the form of trade penetration and the higher market access in the form of low preferential tariff rats, the more restrictive are the negotiated ROO. Therefore, these results suggest that ROO are used as both a trade protection and as a tariff substitution tool. The research then returns to the question of the impact of ROO on the <b>utilisation</b> <b>rates</b> and trade development in Australia’s FTAs. An equation is estimated in which the relationship and impact of ROO and preferential tariff margins on the <b>utilisation</b> <b>rates</b> is tested. To avoid endogeneity between tariff rates and ROO as identified in this thesis, the study employs the instrumental variable method by using the results of the determinants of ROO as an instrument. Two main hypotheses are examined, namely (1) do more restrictive ROO increase trade costs and with that lower the application of preferential treatment in form of <b>utilisation</b> <b>rates,</b> and (2) do preferential tariff margins serve as an incentive to apply for preferential treatment. The results show a strong negative relationship between the degree of restrictiveness of ROO and the <b>utilisation</b> <b>rates</b> and a positive relationship between preferential tariff margins, and <b>utilisation</b> <b>rates.</b> Thesis (Ph.

We developed an evidence-based utilisation model to estimate the optimal proportion of new cases of cancer where chemotherapy is indicated at least once as a benchmark for measuring and improving the quality of care. Methods: The optimal <b>utilisation</b> <b>rate</b> was defined as the proportion of cancer patients for whom chemotherapy was the treatment of choice. We constructed an optimal chemotherapy utilisation model using indications for chemotherapy identified from evidence-based treatment guidelines. Population-based data on the proportion of patient and tumour-related attributes for which chemotherapy was indicated were obtained from Australian cancer registries where possible. Treatment indications and epidemiological data were merged using TreeAge Pro 2007 to calculate the optimal rate. Monte Carlo simulations and sensitivity analyses were used {{to assess the impact of}} controversial chemotherapy indications and variations in epidemiological data on our model. The optimal rate was compared with actual <b>utilisation</b> <b>rates</b> reported. Results: Chemotherapy was indicated at least once in 50. 8 % (95 % CI 50. 6 - 51 %) of all new cancer patients. The optimal chemotherapy <b>utilisation</b> <b>rates</b> by tumour sites ranged from a low of 13 % in thyroid cancers to a high of 94 % in myeloma. The estimated optimal chemotherapy <b>utilisation</b> <b>rates</b> by tumour sites (except for liver cancer) were well above the actual rates reported (see Table 1 below).

However, relatively {{little is known about}} the utilisation of cancer screening services for women with disabilities. This study addresses this gap by examining the utilisation of the Papanicolaou test and mammography for disabled women in Chile. Methods: We used cross-sectional data, taken from a 2015 nationally-representative survey. Initially, we employed logistic regressions to test for differences in <b>utilisation</b> <b>rates</b> for the Papanicolaou test (66, 281 observations) and the mammogram (35, 294 observations) between disabled and non-disabled women. Next, logistic regressions were used to investigate the demographic, socioeconomic, and health-related factors affecting <b>utilisation</b> <b>rates</b> for cancer screening services for disabled women (sample sizes: 5, 823 observations for the Papanicolaou test and 5, 731 observations for the mammogram). Results: Disabled women were less likely to undergo screening tests than non-disabled women. For the Papanicolaou test and mammography, the multivariable regression models showed that living in rural areas, having higher education, being affiliated with a private health insurance company, giving a good health self-assessment score, and being under medical treatment for other illnesses were associated with higher <b>utilisation</b> <b>rates.</b> On the other hand, being single, inactive with regard to employment, and having a better income were linked with lower <b>utilisation.</b> While <b>utilisation</b> <b>rates</b> for both disabled and non-disabled women have increased since 2006, the utilisation disparity has slightly increased. Conclusions: This study shows the influence of various factors in the <b>utilisation</b> <b>rates</b> of preventive cancer screening services for disabled women.

Apparent metabolisable energy (AME) {{is a measure of}} <b>energy</b> <b>utilisation</b> efficiency representing the difference between energy consumed and energy lost via the excreta. There are significant differences in the <b>energy</b> <b>utilisation</b> capability of individual birds that have a similar genetic background and are raised under identical conditions. It would be of benefit to poultry producers if the basis of these differences could be understood and the differences minimised. We analysed duodenal gene expression and microbiota differences in birds with different <b>energy</b> <b>utilisation</b> efficiencies. Using microarray analysis, significant differences were found in duodenal gene expression between high- and low-AME birds, indicating that level of cell turnover may distinguish different groups of birds. High-throughput sequencing of bacterial 16 S rRNA genes indicated that duodenal microbiota was dominated by Lactobacillus species and two operational taxonomic units, identified as lactobacilli species, were found to be more abundant (P < 0. 05) in low-AME birds. The present study has identified gene expression and microbiota properties that correlate with differences in AME; further studies will be required to investigate the causal relationships...|$|R

40|$|In {{this paper}} we propose a {{straightforward}} method to derive a non-accelerating inflation capacity <b>utilisation</b> <b>rate</b> (NAICU) based on micro data. We condition the current capacity utilisation of firms on their current and planned price adjustments. The non-accelerating inflation capacity <b>utilisation</b> <b>rate</b> is then defined as the rate where a firm feels no price adjustment pressure. One of the main advantages is that this methodology uses structural aspects and does not make it necessary to operate with –often rather arbitrary– statistical filters. We show that our aggregate NAICU performs remarkably well as an indicator of inflationary pressure in a Phillips curve estimation. prices, capacity utilisation, NAICU, Phillips curve...|$|R
40|$|Abstract—The power {{consumption}} of a data centre (DC) {{can be attributed}} to the power consumed for running the servers and to the computer room air conditioner (CRAC) power for cooling them. The challenge is to distribute the load among servers, controlling the number of active servers and optimally balancing IT and cooling power requirement. This goal demands integration of thermal, power and workload models that minimises a non-linear <b>energy</b> <b>utilisation</b> function. In this paper first we encode this problem using a non-linear objective function and use local search for solving it. We carry out simulation experiments using data provided by the Bluesim tool. The results encourage the effectiveness of our approach, showing that system-wide <b>energy</b> <b>utilisation</b> can be reduced using a holistic approach. I...|$|R

Specifically, {{the aim of}} this paper is to estimate whether there is an urban/rural differential in GP <b>utilisation</b> <b>rates.</b> We do this by simulating micro-level health care data. Using this synthetic data, simple logit models are employed to estimate the likelihood that individuals in different jurisdictions will attend a GP surgery. These individual logit estimates are then inputted into a spatial interaction model to highlight areas with low GP accessibility given their health status. The policy implications of these results are discussed in relation to both the health care literature and current Irish health care policy...|$|R
