5|$|In {{the case}} of '4 Minutes', Tim had a vision from the {{beginning}} of how things should go, especially sonically... When I opened up the session of '4 Minutes', there was so much going on that <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> <b>right</b> away that the hard part would be {{to make sure that the}} vocals would cut through and were right in the pocket. Beginning with working on the vocals was the only way to achieve this. After that I formed all the other parts around the vocals. The other challenge was to make sure that everything in the track sounded clear and that you could hear every instrument, every syllable, every breath. Also, I do almost always work linear in time on a track. It's easier, because when you're done, you're done. So I keep working on section after section, until I get to the end of the track and then I know the whole mix is pretty close.|$|E
500|$|There were initial {{fears that}} Richard's glamorous image {{would not work}} for the {{character}} and Smith also feared that Richard would be apprehensive about playing Pauline, who would be anything but glamorous, but these fears were swept aside when Richard announced that she was sick of glamour and wanted to play her own age. Richard has commented, [...] "although it would be such a huge transformation of my screen image, it was after all my twenty-fifth year in showbusiness, and I'd realised that I couldn't go on playing dolly birds forever... <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> <b>right</b> away I would be mad {{to turn down the}} part of Pauline." ...|$|E
500|$|While at high school, Miller {{formed a}} trio that played at {{cocktail}} parties. His elder brother recommended that he listen to pianist Oscar Peterson, {{but there was}} no way of doing this in Greenwood until Peterson appeared on The Joey Bishop Show on television when Miller was about 14. After watching Peterson's performance, Miller decided to become a pianist: [...] "It was a life changing event. <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> <b>right</b> then that I would be a jazz pianist". Miller later mentioned Art Tatum and Erroll Garner as piano influences during his teenage years. Miller reported years later that he always found that playing fast was easy, so playing slowly and with more control were what he had to work hardest on.|$|E

500|$|Despite an Alternative Press {{news report}} shortly after signing with Fueled by Ramen that {{the band was}} recording, they did not start the album until February 2006. Recording took place at Salad Days Studios in Beltsville, Maryland. The group made a brief list of {{producers}} they wished to work with, the first being Matt Squire. One of the band's main reasons for wanting to work with Squire was the label's rapport with him {{as a result of}} the success of Panic! at the Disco's debut, A Fever You Can't Sweat Out (2005). Janick sent Squire a demo of [...] "Teasing to Please (Left Side, Strong Side)." [...] Shaant Hacikyan recalls Squire was [...] "really excited about it. <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> <b>right</b> away that that we could make a great record together." ...|$|E
500|$|Another actress to {{join the}} show was Academy Award winner Whoopi Goldberg, {{who had been a}} long-time Star Trek fan. She {{credited}} Nichelle Nichols as Uhura in The Original Series as an inspiration, saying [...] "Well, when I was nine years old Star Trek came on, I looked at it and I went screaming through the house, 'Come here, mum, everybody, come quick, come quick, there's a black lady on television and she ain't no maid!' <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> <b>right</b> then and there I could be anything I wanted to be." [...] To appear on the show, Goldberg contacted the producers initially through LeVar Burton. The producers did not believe her as they felt that a movie star such as Goldberg would not want to appear in Star Trek, and ignored calls from her agent, until Goldberg called them personally. A meeting was arranged between her and Rick Berman, and she agreed to appear in six episodes of season two. Her character, Guinan, was named after Mary [...] "Texas" [...] Guinan, a prohibition-era speakeasy owner.|$|E
500|$|Several {{actors were}} cast in roles which recurred {{throughout}} the seven seasons {{on television and}} into the four feature films. Majel Barrett, referred to as [...] "The First Lady of Star Trek" [...] due to her marriage with Roddenberry, appeared both {{as the voice of}} Starfleet computers and as Lwaxana Troi. The part of Lwaxana was specifically created for her. She had appeared in The Original Series and two Star Trek films as Christine Chapel, and as Number One in the original pilot [...] "". John de Lancie was cast as Q despite missing his first audition as it conflicted with a play he was in at the time. A second audition was arranged, where de Lancie impressed Roddenberry, who told him that [...] "You make my words sound better than they are." [...] Colm Meaney was originally cast as an unnamed Ensign in [...] "Encounter at Farpoint", but was subsequently cast as the Transporter Chief Miles O'Brien, appearing in 52 episodes in that role. Whoopi Goldberg approached the producers and asked for a role in the show, resulting in Roddenberry writing her the part of Guinan. She credits Nichelle Nichols as Uhura in The Original Series as inspiring her, saying [...] "when I was nine years old Star Trek came on, I looked at it and I went screaming through the house, 'Come here, mom, everybody, come quick, come quick, there's a black lady on television and she ain't no maid!' <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> <b>right</b> then and there I could be anything I wanted to be."

2500|$|Afterwards Spinks said: [...] "I came {{to fight}} like I said I would. I {{just tried to}} do what I knew I had to do, and that was fight. Not that I stood toe to toe with him, but I tried to take the shot and I came up short." [...] Futch opined that Spinks was undone because he {{abandoned}} his gameplan of boxing and moving early on and instead tried to win Tyson's respect. Spinks later conceded that [...] "fear was knocking at my door big time." [...] Tyson said [...] "The first punch I threw, he wobbled a bit. <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> <b>right</b> there I had him," [...] adding [...] "my trainer told me before the fight that he bet both our purses that I would knock {{him out in the}} first round. So I went out and knocked him out in the first round. And later I found out he was fooling." [...] Tyson dedicated the win to Jimmy Jacobs, who had died in March.|$|E
2500|$|Blake’s {{internally}} braced hollow wooden surfboards {{were eventually}} superseded by laminated boards with an interior layer of balsa, then by foam-and-fiberglass designs, but {{another of his}} innovations remains a fixture of modern surf- and paddleboards, the [...] "skeg" [...] or fin. Traditional surfboards were flat-bottomed, but in 1935, Blake experimented by tearing the keel off an old speedboat and attaching it {{to the bottom of}} a surfboard. Blake later remembered, [...] "I finally put the fin on the board and went out in the surf, paddled out. In paddling out, the board had an entirely different feeling with the skeg on it, it wasn't entirely a likable feeling... But I got a pretty good wave and right away found the remarkable control you had over the board with the skeg on it. It didn't spin out, it steered easy, because the tail held steady when you put the pressure on the front. You could [...] turn it any way you wanted it. <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> <b>right</b> from that moment it was a success. I consider it as my good solid contribution to the sport. It gives me a lot of pleasure when I see the kids drive by in [...] their cars with a fin on their board." ...|$|E

6000|$|I {{remember}} clearly, at least, the shame, the despair, of {{the next}} morning, when I reviewed what I had done, and how I had swindled the poor honest porter: and, {{as if that were}} not enough, fairly burnt my ships, and brought bankruptcy home to that last refuge, my garret. The porter would expect his money; I could not pay him; here was scandal in the house; and <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> <b>right</b> well the cause of scandal would have to pack. [...] "What do you mean by calling my honesty in question?" [...] I had cried the day before, turning upon Myner.

You don't often see four such beauties together, and all with {{as much as they}} could carry, save only Chris, who is too leary a cove to drink when there's somethin' goin' forward. For my part, I showed 'em into the parlour, not 'cos they was worthy of it, but 'cos <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> <b>right</b> well they would start bashin' some of my customers, and maybe get my license into trouble if I left 'em in the bar.

"I {{take you}} to witness," [...] he said, [...] "that this has befallen to my great sorrow, and had I been where this gentleman was yesterday, and heard my cousin blaspheme, I would myself have drawn on him, but--" [...] And here, as I later heard, he fainted from loss of blood, my sword having cut a great vein; and I {{likewise}} lost sense and knowledge. Nor did I know more till they lifted me and laid me on a litter of poplar boughs, having stanched my wound as best they might. In the boat, as they ferried us across the river, I believe that I fainted again; and so, [...] "between home and hell," [...] as the saying is, I lay on my litter and was carried along the street beside the water. Folk gathered around us as we went. I heard their voices as in a dream, when lo! there sounded a voice that <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> <b>right</b> well, for Elliot was asking of the people [...] "who was hurt?" [...] At this hearing I hove myself up on my elbow, beckoning with my other hand; and I {{opened my mouth to}} speak, but, in place of words, came only a wave of blood that sickened me, and I seemed to be dreaming, in my bed, of Elliot and her jackanapes; and then feet were trampling, and at length I was laid down, and so seemed to fall most blessedly asleep, with a little hand in mine, and rarely peaceful and happy in my heart, though wherefore I knew not. After many days of tossing on the waves of the world, it was as if I had been brought into the haven where I would be. Of what was passing I knew or I remember nothing. Later I heard that a good priest had been brought to my bedside, and perchance there was made some such confession as the Church, in her mercy, accepts from sinful men in such case as mine. But I had no thought of life or death, purgatory or paradise; only, if paradise be rest among those we love, such rest for an unknown while, and such sense of blissful companionship, were mine. But whether it was well to pass through and beyond this scarce sensible joy, or whether that peace will ever again be mine and unending, I leave with humility to them in whose hands are Christian souls.|$|E
