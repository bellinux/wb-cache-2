Cattle sera were tested by enzyme-linked immunoassay to determine whether tick-borne viruses other than CCHF occur in the country. The prevalence of antibody in cattle sera was 905 / 2116 (42. 8 %) for CCHF virus, 70 / 1358 (5. 2 %) for Dugbe, 21 / 1358 (1. 5 %) for louping ill, 6 / 450 (1. 3 %) for West Nile, 7 / 1358 (0. 5 %) for Nairobi sheep disease, 3 / 625 (0. 5 %) for Kadam and 2 / 450 (0. 4 %) for Chenuda. No reactions were recorded with Hazara, Bahig, Bhanja, Thogoto and <b>Dhori</b> <b>viruses.</b> The CCHF findings confirmed previous observations that the virus is widely prevalent within the distribution range of ticks of the genus Hyalomma, while antibody activity to Dugbe antigen was detected only within the distribution range of the tick Amblyomma hebraeum. Cross-reactivity for the nairoviruses, Hazara, Nairobi sheep disease and Dugbe, was detected in serum samples from 3 / 72 human patients with confirmed CCHF infection, and serum from 1 / 162 other patients reacted monospecifically with Dugbe antigen.

50|$|Bourbon {{virus is}} a type of thogotovirus, which is in the RNA virus family Orthomyxoviridae. The virus {{particles}} show different morphologies, including filamentous and roughly spherical forms, and have projections from the surface. The spherical virions have a range of diameters, with broadly 100-130 nm being common. Virus was present at high levels in the extracellular space, with occasional particles being observed in the process of endocytosis. Like other members of the Orthomyxoviridae, the Bourbon virus genome is single-stranded, negative-sense RNA, which is segmented, or divided into a number of separate pieces. It has at least six segments. Bourbon virus is most similar in RNA sequence to <b>Dhori</b> <b>virus</b> and the closely related Batken virus, both members of the genus Thogotovirus, but has diverged substantially from these viruses. Dhori and Batken viruses have only been reported in the Eastern hemisphere.|$|E
50|$|Bourbon {{virus is}} an RNA virus in the genus Thogotovirus {{of the family}} Orthomyxoviridae, {{which is similar to}} <b>Dhori</b> <b>virus</b> and Batken virus. It was first {{identified}} in 2014 in a man from Bourbon County, Kansas, United States, who died after being bitten by ticks. The case is the eighth report of human disease associated with a thogotovirus globally, and the first in the Western hemisphere. As of May 2015, a case was discovered in Stillwater, Oklahoma (the patient fully recovered) and relatively {{little is known about the}} virus. No specific treatment or vaccine is available. The virus is suspected to be transmitted by ticks or insects, and avoidance of bites is recommended to reduce risk of infection. In June 2017 a 58-year old woman from Missouri died from an infection of the Bourbon virus after it had been misdiagnosed for a significant period of time.|$|E

Here, we show that <b>Dhori</b> <b>virus,</b> an influenza-like virus transmitted by ticks and known to infect small mammals, is sensitive to the Mx 1 resistance mechanism. Influenza virus-susceptible BALB/c and C 57 BL/ 6 mice (lacking a functional Mx 1 gene) developed severe disease symptoms and died within a few days after intraperitoneal infection with a lethal dose of <b>Dhori</b> <b>virus.</b> In contrast, Mx 1 -congenic, influenza virus-resistant BALB.

The Mx 1 resistance phenotype was expressed in cultured peritoneal macrophages and interferon-treated embryonic cells obtained from these mice. Moreover, stable lines of transfected mouse 3 T 3 cells constitutively expressing Mx 1 protein were protected from <b>Dhori</b> <b>virus</b> infection. The MxA protein of human cells shows a high degree of sequence similarity to Mx 1 but, unlike Mx 1, inhibits a broad range of RNA viruses. Transgenic mice that permanently express the human MxA protein in various organs became resistant to infection with Thogoto virus but remained fully susceptible to <b>Dhori</b> <b>virus.</b> These in vivo results show that DHO virus is unique in being resistant to human MxA but susceptible to mouse Mx 1 protein.

40|$|Thogoto and Dhori viruses are tick-borne orthomyxoviruses infecting {{humans and}} {{livestock}} in Africa, Asia, and Europe. Here, {{we show that}} human MxA protein is an efficient inhibitor of Thogoto virus but is inactive against <b>Dhori</b> <b>virus.</b> When expressed in the cytoplasm of stably transfected cell lines, MxA protein interfered with the accumulation of Thogoto viral RNA and proteins. Likewise, MxA(R 645), a mutant MxA protein known to be active against influenza virus but inactive against vesicular stomatitis virus, was equally efficient in blocking Thogoto virus growth. Hence, a common antiviral mechanism that is distinct from the antiviral action against vesicular stomatitis virus may operate against both influenza virus and Thogoto virus. When moved to the nucleus {{with the help of}} a foreign nuclear transport signal, MxA(R 645) remained active against Thogoto virus, indicating that a nuclear step of virus replication was inhibited. In contrast, <b>Dhori</b> <b>virus</b> was not affected by wild-type or mutant MxA protein, indicating substantial differences between these two tick-transmitted orthomyxoviruses.

As nucleic acid tests are playing increasingly prominent roles in diagnostics, the genetic characterization of molecularly uncharacterized agents is expected to significantly enhance detection and surveillance capabilities. We report the identification of two previously unrecognized members of the familyOrthomyxoviridae, which includes the influenza viruses and the tick-transmitted Thogoto and Dhori viruses. We provide morphological, serologic, and genetic evidence thatUpolu virus (UPOV) from Australia and Aransas Bay virus (ABV) from North America, both previously considered potential bunyaviruses based on electron microscopy and physicochemical features, are orthomyxoviruses instead. Their genomes show up to 68 % nucleotide sequence identity to Thogoto virus (segment 2; 74 % at the amino acid level) and a more distant relationship to <b>Dhori</b> <b>virus,</b> the two prototype vi-ruses of the recognized species of the genus Thogotovirus.

40|$|Tick-borne Thogoto virus (THOV) {{represents}} the prototype virus {{of a new}} genus in the Orthomyxoviridae family. Its genome consists of six segments of negative-sense, single-stranded RNA. We have cloned and sequenced the fifth genomic segment, which codes for the viral nucleoprotein (NP). The deduced amino acid sequence shows 43 % similarity to the NP of <b>Dhori</b> <b>virus,</b> a related tick-transmitted orthomyxovirus, and about 14 % sequence similarity {{to those of the}} influenza viruses. To reveal the mechanism by which THOV initiates mRNA synthesis, we characterized the 5 ' ends of the NP mRNAs. Transcripts were recognized by a cap-specific monoclonal antibody, indicating that THOV mRNAs are capped. Surprisingly, no large heterogeneous extensions were found at the 5 ' end, as would have been expected if THOV were using a classical "cap-stealing" mechanism. We therefore propose that THOV is stealing only the cap structure with one or two additional nucleotides from cellular mRNAs to generate appropriate primers for initiation of viral mRNA transcription...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. Mice {{infected}} with <b>Dhori</b> <b>virus</b> (DHOV) develop a fulminant, systemic, and uniformly fatal illness that has {{many of the}} clinical and pathologic findings seen in H 5 N 1 influenza A virus infection. However, the role of host’s immune response in DHOV infection remains unclear. In this study, the concentrations of 23 inflammatory cytokines and chemokines were measured in the liver, lungs, and sera of mice {{during the course of}} DHOV infection. Liver function, level of viremia, and hematologic response were also monitored. Infected animals exhibited significant leucopenia and lymphopenia, which directly correlated with the disease progression. High yields of infectious virus along with strikingly elevated expression of various inflammatory mediators, including tumor necrosis factor (TNF) -�, interleukin (IL) - 1, IL- 6, IL- 10, macrophage inflammatory protein (MIP) - 1 �, manocyte chemoattractant protein (MCP) - 1, and interferon (IFN) -�, indicate that these responses {{play an important role in}} the observed disease and pathology. The overall clinical, pathologic, and immunologic responses of ICR mice to DHOV infection closely resemble those described for highly virulent influenza A virus infection in humans, thereby offering a realistic, safe, and alternative anima...|$|E
40|$|To {{identify}} tickborne viruses {{circulating in}} Kenya {{and the surrounding}} region, we conducted surveillance at abattoirs in Nairobi, Kenya. Species of ticks collected included Rhipicephalus pulchellus (56 %), Amblyomma gemma (14 %), R. appendiculatus (8 %), A. variegatum (6 %), and others. A total of 56 virus isolates were obtained, 26 from A. gemma, 17 from R. pulchellus, 6 from A. variegatum, and 7 from other species. Virus isolates included Dugbe virus (DUGV), an unknown virus related to DUGV, Thogoto, Bhanja, Kadam, Dhori, Barur, and foot-and-mouth disease (FMDV) viruses. This is the first report of <b>Dhori</b> <b>virus</b> isolation in East Africa and the first known isolation of FMDV associated with tick collection. Our results demonstrate the potential for tickborne dissemination of endemic and emergent viruses and the relevance of A. gemma in the maintenance of tickborne viruses in this region. Viruses transmitted by blood-feeding arthropods (arboviruses) are responsible {{for some of the}} most serious emerging infectious disease problems facing the world today. Arthropodborne viruses constitute the largest biologic group of vertebrate viruses. Their considerable number and diversity suggest that arthropod vector transmission offers distinct survival benefits for the virus. Approximately 50 % of arbovirus isolations from field-collected arthropods are from mosquitoes, and 25 % are from ticks; however, this difference may represent a sampling bias, since many more mosquitoes are collected and tested for virus than ticks. To investigate the abundance of tickborne arboviruses in Kenya and the surrounding region...|$|E
40|$|Batken virus, {{isolated}} from mosquitoes and ticks, was tentatively {{classified as a}} member of the family Bunyaviridae. Here we show that Batken virus is inhibited by the interferon-induced Mx 1 protein of mice which selectively blocks the growth of orthomyxoviruses, including Thogoto and Dhori viruses. Furthermore, we show that Batken virus multiplication is characterized by accumulation of viral proteins in the nucleus and by budding of viral particles from the cell surface. Serological crossreactions between Batken and Dhori viruses revealed a phylogenetic relationship of these viruses, as previously also proposed by D. K. Lvov. Fragments of the Batken virus glycoprotein and nucleoprotein genes were amplified by RT–PCR. The deduced amino acid sequences were similar to the corresponding <b>Dhori</b> <b>virus</b> sequences. Therefore, Batken virus should be classified into the newly established genus Thogotovirus of the family Orthomyxoviridae. Finally, our results demonstrate that Mx 1 susceptibility of orthomyxoviruses is a reliable marker in the hunt for new family members. The first isolates of Batken virus (BKNV) including the prototype strain LEIV 306 K were obtained by Lvov et al. (1974) from Hyalomma plumbeum plumbeum ticks that were collected from sheep in the surroundings of Batken village, Kirghizia. An additional virus strain was {{isolated from}} mixed Aedes caspius caspius and Culex (Neoculex) hortensis mosquitoes which were caught in the Leninsk region, Kirghizia (Lvov et al., 1974).

40|$|Baculoviridae are {{a family}} of large double {{stranded}} DNA viruses that are exclusively pathogenic to arthropods. Baculoviruses have been studied i) with the aim to develop alternatives to chemical pest control, ii) for their application as an eukaryotic expression system to express heterologous proteins, and recently iii) as gene delivery vehicle in gene therapy. Baculoviruses cluster into two distinct genera {{on the basis of}} the occlusion body (OB) morphology: Nucleopolyhedrovirus (NPV) and Granulovirus (GV). The NPVs are further subdivided into a group I and a group II, based on the phylogeny of some of their genes. A feature, shared by all baculoviruses, is the production of two viral phenotypes during the infection cycle: the occlusion derived virus (ODV), which is responsible for the horizontal transmission of the virus in insect populations, and the budded virus (BV), which is responsible for the spread of the virus within the host and in cultured insect cells. A NPV infection starts with the uptake of OBs, which dissolve in the midgut, liberating numerous ODV particles. The nucleocapsid (NC) enters the midgut epithelial cells after fusion of the ODV envelope with the cellular membrane. Then the NCs are transported to the nucleus, where transcription, replication and assembly of progeny NCs occur. The progeny NCs are translocated to the plasma membrane, where they acquire an envelope containing, at least in group I NPVs, the virus encoded major envelope glycoprotein GP 64. After budding from the plasma membrane the progeny BV is responsible for the systemic infection of the insect beyond the initially infected midgut epithelium and enters other insect cells by the mechanism of receptor mediated endocytosis. The acidification of the endosome triggers the GP 64 -mediated fusion of the viral and endosomal membrane. The NCs are thereby released in the cytoplasm and transported to the nucleus. Determination of the genome sequence of the group II NPVs Lymantria dispar (Ld) MNPV and Spodoptera exigua (Se) MNPV led to new insights with regard to BV envelope structure. Neither LdMNPV nor SeMNPV contains a gp 64 gene. Instead, group II NPVs, or at least LdMNPV and SeMNPV, possess another BV envelope (glyco) protein that has a function analogous to GP 64. First it was investigated whether the SeMNPV BV enters the cell by direct membrane fusion or by the endocytotic pathway (chapter 2). The use of a lysosomothrophic reagent inhibited SeMNPV BVs infection, indicating that the virus enters by the endocytotic pathway. The major envelope protein of the SeMNPV BVs was sequenced and this appeared to be a C-terminal cleavage fragment of the primary translation product of ORF 8 in the SeMNPV genome. The Se 8 gene product as well as its homolog (Ld 130) was shown to be localized at the plasma membrane. Syncytium formation assays showed that these proteins alone were sufficient to mediate pH-dependent membrane fusion and were therefore named the fusion (F) protein. The fact that F was detected in BVs as a smaller fragment derived from a larger proprotein, suggested that upon maturation F was posttranslationally cleaved. Such cleavage is a general mechanism, found among vertebrate viruses to activate their fusion proteins. The occurrence of a conserved proprotein convertase cleavage site in the primary translation product of SeMNPV F as well as LdMNPV F suggested the possible involvement of a cellular furin in the cleavage reaction. The use of a specific inhibitor indicated that furin is indeed involved in the cleavage of SeMNPV F and that this cleavage is required for the fusiogenic activity of the protein (chapter 3). This was further confirmed by demonstrating that a mutant F protein with a dysfunctional cleavage site did not mediate membrane fusion in a syncytium formation assay. By means of Western analysis it was shown that F is a BV specific protein and that both its N-terminal (F 2) and C-terminal (F 1) cleavage product is present in BVs and presumably covalently linked by a disulfide-bridge. As far as its function as fusion protein, all results indicated that F was functionally analogous to GP 64. To investigate whether this analogy also held with respect to receptor binding and virion budding, an AcMNPV pseudotyping system was developed (chapter 4). A gp 64 -deficient AcMNPV bacmid was successfully pseudotyped with SeMNPV and LdMNPV F proteins, as infectious BVs were obtained upon transfection of the bacmids into insect cells. This pseudotyping also demonstrated once more that F has to be cleaved to release its fusiogenic capabilities, since an F protein with a dysfunctional cleavage site was not able to rescue the loss of the gp 64 gene. Western analysis showed that the mutated protein was incorporated in BVs, but in its uncleaved (F 0) conformation. The meantime available genome sequences of Xestia c-nigrum (Xecn) GV, Plutella xylostella (Plxy) GV and; mso-fareast-language:EN-US;layout-grid-mode:line'>Cydia pomonella (Cp) GV revealed that   also these granuloviruses do not contain a gp 64 gene. Therefore it was also examined whether the F protein homolog of PlxyGV was capable to pseudotype the gp 64 -null AcMNPV mutant. However, no infectious BVs were produced upon transfection of the bacmid in insect cells, although the PlxyGV F protein was demonstrated in the produced BVs.   In addition to a gp 64 gene group I NPVs have a remnant f gene in their genome. GP 64 homologs are also found on two tick-transmitted Orthomyxoviruses, Thogoto virus and <b>Dhori</b> <b>virus.</b> This suggests that an ancestral group I NPV may have acquired the gp 64 gene either from their host or from another virus, thereby acquiring a selective advantage in replication and obviating the need for a functional F protein. To experimentally address this hypothesis a SeMNPV f -null mutant was pseudotyped with GP 64 (chapter 5). However, no infectious BVs could be obtained in this experiment, indicating that the f gene is essential for viral propagation of SeMNPV. Reinsertion of the f gene of SeMNPV restored the wild-type phenotype of SeMNPV. These results suggest that F from group II NPVs might contain additional essential functions in producing infectious BVs. These functions are essential in group II NPVs, but not in group I NPVs.   The biological significance of the posttranslational cleavage of SeMNPV F was further investigated (chapter 6). In fusion proteins of vertebrate viruses this cleavage occurs just in front of a hydrophobic, called "fusion peptide". As the N-terminus of SeMNPV F 1 possesses common features to these vertebrate viral fusion peptides this sequence was studied by mutational analysis. SeMNPV F proteins with single point mutations at conserved positions as well as with a complete deletion of the fusion peptide domain were analyzed in the baculovirus pseudotyping system. Two of the F mutants, including the deletion mutant, were unable to rescue the propagation defect of the gp 64 -null bacmid, while other mutants were significantly reduced in their viral infectivity or viral propagation in cell culture. These results indicate that N-terminus of SeMNPV F 1 is most likely the "fusion peptide" involved in the viral entry mechanism. Finally the results obtained during the reported PhD study are discussed (chapter 7) with respect to baculovirus entry, evolution and taxonomy...|$|E
