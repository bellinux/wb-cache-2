The Composing Room employed advanced type-setting methods that boasted quick turnarounds and high-quality work for high-circulation magazines including Vogue, Vanity Fair, and House and Garden. The Composing Room worked directly with font foundries like Linotype and encouraged ligatures to be created for bad letter combinations.

40|$|The {{satisfaction}} I feel at {{the opportunity}} afforded me to add my homage {{to that of}} old colleagues who have preceded me in the commemoration of James Mackenzie and his work is of a special kind. Mackenzie {{was a man with}} a mission. He also had a vocation, and his life was rich in worth. If James Mackenzie sought to bring what might be called " physical " light to the dark and sick lives of the industrial workers of his time, he brought much spiritual light also. To have enlisted the cooperation {{of some of the most}} notable and busy men in public health and medicine through his Industrial Health Education Society required qualities which, when they impinge on other men's minds, raise them to heights they would never wish, to leave. These qualities of Mackenzie are those which every medical officer in industry requires. The workers and staff of an industry are in a real sense the flock of the <b>industrial</b> <b>doctor,</b> and he should be as preoccupied about their physical and mental well-being as the parson is presumed to be about the spiritual life of his flock. His factory is his industrial health education society, but there the people to be taught are not only the workers but the employers also. Thirty years ago, when James Mackenzie was founding his society, industrial medicine was in the stage of exhortation. The workman was suspicious of the " compo " doctor; the employer might employ a doctor to examine new entrants, for first-aid services, and in compensation cases. Many doctors thus appointed were not permitted to enter the factories at all. The health and well-being of a worker were then of consideration only as they might affect the employer's interests. Then, as now, the appointment of an industrial medical officer and what he was asked to do lay with the employer. * The Mackenzie Industrial Health Lecture delivered in Mancheste...|$|E

40|$|Atherosclerosis and its {{risk factors}} {{represent}} {{one of the}} most significant health problems of the western civilization; they are {{one of the most}} frequent causes of death and they limit significantly the quality and length of life. Atherosclerosis also causes invalidity. More than fifty thousand people die of heart and blood vessel related diseases in the Czech Republic every year. Non-pharmacological therapy, based on changing life habits, is an integral part of treating atherosclerosis. These measures include the reduction of body weight, suitable physical activities, changes of eating habits, preventing stressful situations, and absolute termination of smoking. The objective of the paper was to find out about the awareness and subsequent observance of non-pharmacological treatment measures in patients who have been diagnosed with at least one risk factor. Nurses play a very important role in non-pharmacological treatment. Their task is to inform patients about the non-pharmacological treatment, to provide assistance in acquiring required habits, to change behaviour of patients, and to help patients cope with the care of themselves. Therefore, it was necessary to find out about nurses? education, experience, potential, time and enthusiasm for educational activities at various departments. The data for this paper was collected using a quantitative research strategy by means of questionnaire method. A questionnaire for patients contained 31 questions and a questionnaire for nurses contained 23 questions. The results were processed in a graphic form. The research was carried out at the medical inpatient department and the specialized outpatient departments of cardiology, diabetology, internal, and <b>industrial</b> <b>doctor</b> at Mulač Hospital in Pilsen. Three hypotheses were formulated: 1 Patients know the principles of non-pharmacological treatment of atherosclerosis risk factors. 2 Patients observe the principles of non-pharmacological treatment of atherosclerosis risk factors. 3 There are differences in providing education at the inpatient and outpatient departments to patients with a confirmed atherosclerosis risk factor. The research resulted in the finding that patients with a confirmed atherosclerosis risk factor know the principles of non-pharmacological treatment but they do not observe these principles. The first hypothesis has been confirmed, the second one was disconfirmed. It has also been found out the there are differences in methods and means available to nurses to provide education as impatient and outpatient facilities. The third hypothesis has been confirmed. The results of our research obtained through the work on this paper will be used as background material for nurses? educational activities and thus they may contribute to increasing the preventive measures for patients with a confirmed atherosclerosis risk factor...|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT DEVELOPING INNOVATION CAPABILITY IN A MASS PRODUCTION ORGANIZATION by MARK DOLSEN May 2017 Advisor: Dr. Ratna Babu Chinnam Major: <b>Industrial</b> Engineering Degree: <b>Doctor</b> of Philosophy Auto parts {{manufacturing}} is a {{key element}} of the North American automotive supply chain, and a significant component of the economy of Ontario, Canada. Employment in this sector declined 40 % from 2003 to 2010 as the industry experienced a recession, and many firms relocated to lower wage jurisdictions as the Canadian currency strengthened against the US dollar. Experts contend that the solution for the industry lies in innovation; however, recommendations found in the current literature are general, with no clear guidance for mass production firms. This situation is urgent, because as manufacturing firms disappear, the potential for innovative opportunity is reduced as well. Mass production firms in high wage rate jurisdictions need to develop a capability of continuous innovation to survive and compete in the global marketplace. This dissertation addresses this problem through the study of an auto parts manufacturing firm in Ontario, Canada. Theory states that innovation is born of creative ideas from intrinsically motivated individuals, and that every employee in a firm is a potential source of ideas. Employee engagement, a proxy for intrinsic motivation, is defined as giving discretionary effort in achieving company goals, and literature indicates that performance of a firm is proportional to engagement levels of its employees. To investigate the firm’s potential for innovation, a survey was administered to the firm’s employees to measure engagement levels and theoretical constructs for engagement drivers. A structural equation model was used to analyze the significance of these relationships. Subsequently, factory performance data representative of innovative and improvement behavior was collected for the same time period as the survey, and correlations were examined between work group engagement levels, engagement drivers, and the performance data at the work group level. Following this, case study research was used to examine how the process of innovation actually happens in the firm. Literature defines creative thinking as a continuous process of problem finding, problem solving, and solution implementing. Three cases of process innovations implemented over a three year period were studied to reveal how the organization executed the creative thinking process, the significance of employee engagement levels and drivers in that execution, and how innovation capabilities improved through experiential learning. From the two components of the study, a recommendation is offered for how an auto parts firm in a high wage rate jurisdiction can compete with a differentiation strategy by developing a continuous innovation capability. Organizational elements must be aligned in the execution of the three step creative thinking process, so that problems are clearly identified, and the most highly engaged employees are focused on creative problem solving...|$|R
40|$|Focusing on {{ordinary}} citizens in Belgian health news, this study complements a broad {{content analysis of}} news sources in print, broadcast and online news collected in February 2015 (N= 1998) with {{a case study of}} pharmaceutical company Alexion’s attempts to use media coverage of patient stories to place the reimbursement of Soliris, their most expensive medicine (approx. 265, 000 USD per year per patient), on the political agenda. A literature review shows that in health news, citizen sources often occur as “exemplars” to complement expert interviews and dry statistical information (Hinnant, Len-Riós & Young, 2013). Exemplars are individual citizens’ subjective accounts of health and illness, e. g. cancer patients talking about how they experienced chemotherapy. In fact, exemplars serve as a highly valued journalistic tool. Their use is widespread among health journalists because they are considered a very powerful persuasive strategy in conveying complex and abstract medical information that is meant to bring about behavioral changes (Zillmann, 2006). In other words, drawing the audience’s attention through the use of exemplars seems a necessary prerequisite for effectively getting across public health messages to large proportions of the population. However, the increasingly commercial logic of many media companies could undermine the ‘ideal’ situation sketched above on two levels. Firstly, on an evaluative level, the use of emotional exemplars is often negatively associated with tabloidization (Gans, 2009). In order to reach wider audiences, journalists increasingly produce stories that hinge on news factors such as emotionality, exceptionality and drama (Verhoeven, 2008). According to some, this leads to a portrayal of health issues that is too sensational and over-simplified (Levi, 2001). Furthermore, the exploitation of emotional investment through exemplar-use may induce anxiety and incorrect assessments of actual health risks (Zillmann, 2006). Secondly, on a practical level, working conditions in the newsroom are under pressure because journalists are required to produce more content in less time. As a result, prevailing theories on journalistic sourcing practices suggest a greater reliance on elite sources, such as politicians, <b>industrial</b> elites and <b>doctors</b> or scientists (Franklin, 2011). However, while the use of elite sources saves time because it requires less journalistic effort than the use of citizen sources, the very same commercial logic encourages the use of citizen sources as exemplars in order {{to attract the attention of}} the widest possible audience through strong emotive appeals (Hinnant, Len-Riós & Young, 2013). Consequently, the reliance on elite sources combined with less time for fact-checking, may create circumstances in which orchestrated PR-strategies of resource-rich stakeholders directly find their way to news content. Health news is, therefore, a particularly interesting case in point for studying the appearance of citizen (and other types of) sources. The results of the content analysis confirm that – contrary to findings in other news beats (Reich, 2015; De Keyser & Raeymaeckers, 2012) – {{ordinary citizens}} are important sources in Belgian health news. In fact, ordinary citizens constitute the second largest source category in the sample (18. 6 %), only preceded by sources stemming from academia (20. 5 %). Yet this finding is a bit distorted as we have observed large differences across various media types, i. e. ordinary citizens are least frequent in online health news (2 %) but are very dominant on the small screen (42. 3 %). Overwhelmingly, ordinary citizens are represented by patients or friends and family of patients who - due to their illness - cannot appear as source directly, e. g. someone in an advanced stage of Alzheimer’s disease. A small minority is represented by vox pop-like contributions, e. g. opinionated tweets about a new health-policy measure, or man-on-the-street interviews to enliven televised news bulletins. Our case study approach, however, underlines that ordinary citizens in health news are not always what they seem. Mid 2013, the Belgian media unwittingly fell prey to the PR-strategy of pharmaceutical company Alexion. It came to light that, in order to get more leverage in negotiations with the Belgian Department of Health Care concerning the reimbursement of Soliris, Alexion had brought in the help of a PR-bureau (G+ Europe) to contact the parents of a young boy suffering from a rare disease (aHUS) that could only be effectively alleviated with a Soliris-treatment. Disguised as a Dutch patient organization, the PR-expert from G+ Europe hired by Alexion, encouraged the boy’s parents to contact the media and to tell their story to the world for this would help them get the government to pay for the medicine their son so desperately needed. Not only, did Alexion deceive Viktor’s parents, but also Belgian’s leading national media outlets fell into the trap of Alexion’s very proactive media strategy. Shortly after, through a fine example of investigative and collaborative journalism by two leading newspapers (De Standaard and Het Nieuwsblad), it came to light that the story of Viktor and his parents was not what it had seemed. In other words, while the content analysis of explicitly cited news sources demonstrates that industry sources are scarce (3. 3 %), our case study tells a different story. Very much aware of journalists’ healthy skepsis toward information subsidies stemming from commercial organizations, Alexion indirectly put the reimbursement of Soliris on the political agenda through the use of one very mediagenic young patient and his parents. Although the selected case is linked to the Belgian national context, the media strategy of Alexion, a global pharmaceutical stakeholder, to market Soliris can be observed worldwide (e. g., Australia, Canada, and the UK). This shows that the role of ordinary citizens in health news deserves special attention, not only from a public health communication perspective, but also from a journalism studies perspective. While human exemplars may aid audience understanding of particular issues by raising awareness, the selection of exemplars may reveal the hidden agenda of proactive sources and thus negatively influence health reporting.
