500|$|Johansson {{attended}} PS 41, {{an elementary}} school in Greenwich Village, Manhattan. Growing up, her family {{did not have much}} money. Her parents divorced when she was 13. Johansson was particularly close to her maternal grandmother, Dorothy Sloan, a bookkeeper and schoolteacher; they often spent time together and Johansson considered Sloan her best friend. Interested in a career in the spotlight from an early age, Johansson often put on song-and-dance routines for her family. She was particularly fond of musical theater and jazz hands. She took lessons in tap dance, and states that her parents were supportive of her career choice. Describing her childhood, she says it [...] "was filled with things that <b>I</b> <b>loved</b> <b>to</b> do, and also very normal things: I lived in New York, I have a family life and went to a regular school." ...|$|E
500|$|Schuur {{started singing}} {{when she was}} about three years old. Her mother, who died when Schuur was 13, loved jazz and had a Duke Ellington record collection. Her father, a police captain, was an amateur {{musician}} who often played piano with his daughter sitting by his side. Schuur stated, [...] "As far back as I can remember, singing was in my blood. My parents loved music, and <b>I</b> <b>loved</b> <b>to</b> sing. I was scatting at an early age". She has absolute pitch memory. Unlike the average person, in Schuur's mind every sound – musical or not – has a note value; for example, if she hears a humming motor, she knows the name that note has on a musical instrument. Schuur listened to the radio avidly in her youth; her early musical idols were Sarah Vaughan and Dinah Washington. She said that as a small child she would often retreat to a closet to sing.|$|E
500|$|The {{relationship}} {{was not an}} easy one. According to Northrup, Hubbard began beating her when they were in Florida in the summer of 1946. Her father had just died and her grief appeared to aggravate Hubbard, who was attempting to restart his pre-war career of writing pulp fiction. He was struggling with constant writer's block and leaned heavily on Northrup to provide plot ideas and even to help write some of his stories. She later recalled: [...] "I would often entertain him with plots so he could write. <b>I</b> <b>loved</b> <b>to</b> make plots. The Ole Doc Methuselah series was done that way." [...] One night while they were living beside a frozen lake in Stroudsburg, Hubbard hit her across the face with his [...]45 pistol. She recalled that [...] "I got up and left the house in the night and walked on the ice of the lake because I was terrified." [...] Despite her shock and humiliation, she felt compelled to return to Hubbard. He was severely depressed and repeatedly threatened suicide, and Northrup believed [...] "he must be suffering or he wouldn't act that way".|$|E

50|$|I {{have always}} made art, ever since I can remember. <b>I</b> <b>love</b> <b>to</b> sculpt with clay and wax, and I have been casting into bronze too. I also paint and draw, and <b>I</b> <b>love</b> <b>to</b> write stories, poetry and songs. <b>I</b> <b>love</b> <b>to</b> play music and I {{try to play}} every instrument, but mostly I play guitar. Skateboarding has given me the freedom {{to follow through on}} all my other {{interests}} and hobbies.|$|R
500|$|PewDiePie {{originally}} registered a YouTube account {{under the}} name [...] "Pewdie"; he explains that [...] "pew" [...] represents the sound of lasers and [...] "die" [...] means death. After forgetting the password to this account, he then registered the [...] "PewDiePie" [...] YouTube channel on 29 April 2010. After {{he dropped out of}} Chalmers, his parents refused to support him, and as a result he funded his early videos by selling prints of his Photoshop art, as well as working at a hot dog stand. On having to work at the stand, PewDiePie stated, [...] "the fact that I could make videos was so much more important to me than [...] I had to spend a few hours a day doing a job that wasn’t that prestigious." [...] Five years later, PewDiePie recalled, [...] "I knew people were big at other types of videos, but there was no one big in gaming, and I didn’t know you could make money out of it. It was never like a career that I could just quit college to pursue. It was just something <b>I</b> <b>loved</b> <b>to</b> do. And here we are five years later and it’s exploded." [...] By December 2011, PewDiePie's channel had around 60,000 subscribers. Around the time his channel earned 700,000 subscribers, PewDiePie spoke at Nonick Conference 2012. On 11 July 2012, the channel reached 1 million subscribers, and it reached 2 million subscribers in September. In October, OpenSlate ranked the PewDiePie channel as the #1 YouTube channel. That December, PewDiePie signed with Maker Studios.|$|E
2500|$|... 'Back in {{the early}} '90s, I was really into the Red Hot Chili Peppers and the Brothers Johnson, and <b>I</b> <b>loved</b> <b>to</b> slap. But {{it became clear that}} if I slapped with Rage, we'd sound like another Chili Peppers clone band. I wanted to be in a band that sounded unique, so when we got into the second record, I made the {{decision}} to put the thumb up on the shelf and never use it again. I used to be good, but now I suck at slapping.' ...|$|E
2500|$|This led to {{increased}} {{pressures on the}} two creators (and the team which they formed to help them), including a prolonged period (about a year) of artist's block in Laird. The [...] "incredible growth {{and complexity of the}} business" [...] that sprang up around their instantly-successful Turtles properties, led to Laird: [...] "suddenly discover to my horror that I no longer enjoyed drawing. It was a real shock, because if I ever had anything that I could rely on... it was that <b>I</b> <b>loved</b> <b>to</b> draw." ...|$|E

5000|$|Ho-Sang was {{selected}} by the Islanders {{in the first round}} (28th overall) of the 2014 NHL Entry Draft. The Toronto Sun described him in June 2014 as a [...] "singular hockey player of immense talent, caught on an island of discourse." [...] He said of himself: [...] "I'm more emotional than most people. That poses a problem for the hockey world. A lot of players are trained to hold their emotions.... <b>I</b> <b>love</b> <b>to</b> dangle. <b>I</b> <b>love</b> <b>to</b> play an offensive game. <b>I</b> <b>love</b> <b>to</b> celebrate when <b>I</b> score." ...|$|R
2500|$|During {{the three}} years I spent at school, I not only failed to learn a single thing, but what's more, I forgot what I had learned previously. [...] I forgot entirely how to speak Russian and I was a terrible student. [...] In my spare time, I would go fishing or steal fruit. [...] On a few {{occasions}} I was almost caught. [...] But when I reached high school, I grew fond of geography and history. [...] <b>I</b> <b>loved</b> <b>to</b> read about wars and heroes. [...] I was deeply religious and sang in the church choir.|$|E
2500|$|Casanova gambled {{throughout}} his adult life, {{winning and losing}} large sums. He was tutored by professionals, and he was [...] "instructed in those wise maxims without which games of chance ruin those who participate in them". He was not above occasionally cheating and at times even teamed with professional gamblers for his own profit. Casanova claims that he was [...] "relaxed and smiling when I lost, and I won without covetousness". However, when outrageously duped himself, he could act violently, sometimes calling for a duel. Casanova admits {{that he was not}} disciplined enough to be a professional gambler: [...] "I had neither prudence enough to leave off when fortune was adverse, nor sufficient control over myself when I had won." [...] Nor did he like being considered as a professional gambler: [...] "Nothing could ever be adduced by professional gamblers that I was of their infernal clique." [...] Although Casanova at times used gambling tactically and shrewdly—for making quick money, for flirting, making connections, acting gallantly, or proving himself a gentleman among his social superiors—his practice also could be compulsive and reckless, especially during the euphoria of a new sexual affair. [...] "Why did I gamble when I felt the losses so keenly? What made me gamble was avarice. <b>I</b> <b>loved</b> <b>to</b> spend, and my heart bled when I could not do it with money won at cards." ...|$|E

I used {{to stay in the}} cliff-dwellers' caves and wonder about them. <b>I</b> <b>loved</b> <b>to</b> be out in the wind. And my happiest time was in the summer storms with the thunder echoes under the walls. At evening it was such a quiet place--after the night bird's cry, no sound. The quiet made me sad but I loved it. <b>I</b> <b>loved</b> <b>to</b> watch the stars as I lay awake.|$|E

60|$|How <b>I</b> <b>loved</b> <b>to</b> sit in {{the holy}} hush of those brown old monastic aisles, {{thinking}} of Harry the Eighth, and the Reformation!

I could have sat there all the morning long, through noon, unto night. But at last the benediction would come; and appropriating my share of it, I would slowly move away, thinking how I should like to go home with some of the portly old gentlemen, with high-polished boots and Malacca canes, and take a seat at their cosy and comfortable dinner-tables. But, alas! there was no dinner for me except at the sign of the Baltimore Clipper.|$|E
