5|$|The Ideas <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>Deep</b> {{team could}} not afford to leave their jobs to work on the game full-time, so they {{continued}} to work at Softdisk, spending their time on the Gamer's Edge games during the day and on Commander Keen at night and weekends using Softdisk computers. The group split into different roles: Hall became the game designer and creative director, John Carmack and Romero were the programmers, and Wilbur the manager. They invited artist Adrian Carmack from Softdisk to join them late in development, while Roathe was soon removed from the group. Ideas <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>Deep</b> spent nearly every waking moment when they were not working at Softdisk from October through December 1990 working on Commander Keen, with Wilbur forcing them to eat and take breaks.|$|E

Scattered-extended objects have a Tisserand parameter (relative to Neptune) greater than 3 and have a time-averaged eccentricity greater than 0.2.|$|E
5|$|Breckinridge {{finished}} third in the popular vote with 849,781 votes to Lincoln's 1,866,452, Douglas's 1,379,957, and Bell's 588,879. He carried 12 of the 15 Southern states and the border states of Maryland, Delaware and North Carolina but lost his home state to Bell. His greatest support in the Deep South came from areas that opposed secession. Davis pointed out that only Breckinridge garnered nearly equal support <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>Deep</b> South, the border states, and the free states of the North. His 72 electoral votes bested Bell's 59 and Douglas's 12, but Lincoln received 180, enough to win the election.|$|E

5|$|During Strupper's {{three years}} playing for Georgia Tech, the team {{compiled}} {{a record of}} 24–0–2 and outscored its opponents by a combined score of 1,135 to 61. In Georgia Tech's record-setting 222–0 win over Cumberland College in 1916, Strupper scored eight touchdowns. For many years, 1917 Georgia Tech was considered the greatest football team the South ever produced. Strupper starred {{as part of a}} renowned backfield including also Joe Guyon, Judy Harlan, and Al Hill.

In October 1996, Australian Doctor Who fans Damian Shanahan and Ellen Parry discovered a collection in the records of the National Archives of Australia, provided as evidence by the Commonwealth Film Censorship Board (now the Classification Board). These clips include The Smugglers, episodes 1, 3-4; The Highlanders, episode 1; The Underwater Menace, episodes 2, 4; The Macra Terror, episode 3; Fury <b>From</b> <b>The</b> <b>Deep,</b> episodes 2, 4-5; and The Wheel In Space, episode 4.|$|E
5|$|Seibal {{was first}} settled around 900 BC in the Preclassic Period. It {{reached its peak}} {{population}} in the Late Preclassic around 200 BC, {{at the end of}} the Cantuse ceramic phase (300-200 CE). Ceramics <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>deep</b> Middle Preclassic levels at Seibal belong to the little-known Real/Xe phase, found in the western Petén region. A cruciform Olmec-style cache consisting of a bloodletter and jade celts is similar to those found in the Olmec heartland on the Gulf Coast of Mexico, and the artifacts were probably manufactured at La Venta. This cache dates to approximately 900 BC.|$|E

5|$|Upon {{transitioning}} into {{a tropical}} cyclone, the depression executed an elongated counter-clockwise loop to the northeast. Conditions favored further intensification, {{and based on}} ship reports, it is estimated the depression strengthened into Tropical Storm Bertha early on July28. Bertha quickly strengthened to attain hurricane status early on July29 about halfway between Cape Canaveral, Florida and Bermuda. The strengthening trend was brief, however, as increased vertical wind shear weakened it back to a tropical storm late on July29, with the center exposed <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>deep</b> convection. Bertha continued slowly northeastward to ridging from the Bermuda high extending westward to the United States.|$|E
5|$|Utica's {{location}} on the Erie and Chenango canals encouraged industrial development, allowing the transport of anthracite from northeastern Pennsylvania for local manufacturing and distribution. Utica's economy centered around the manufacture of furniture, heavy machinery, textiles and lumber. The combined effects of the Embargo Act of 1807 and local investment enabled further expansion of the textile industry. Like other upstate New York cities, mills in Utica processed cotton <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>Deep</b> South, a slave society. Much of the New York economy was closely involved with slavery; in the antebellum period, half of New York's exports were related to cotton.|$|E

5|$|Commander Keen in Invasion of the Vorticons is {{a three-part}} episodic side-scrolling {{platform}} video game developed by Ideas <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>Deep</b> (a precursor to id Software) {{and published by}} Apogee Software in 1990 for MS-DOS. It is {{the first set of}} episodes of the Commander Keen series. The game follows the titular Commander Keen, an eight-year-old child genius, as he retrieves the stolen parts of his spaceship from the cities of Mars, prevents a recently arrived alien mothership from destroying landmarks on Earth, and hunts down the leader of the aliens, the Grand Intellect, on the alien home planet. The three episodes feature Keen running, jumping, and shooting through various levels while opposed by aliens, robots, and other hazards.|$|E
5|$|Cyclone Jokwe {{remained}} {{over land}} for about 18hours before emerging into the Mozambique Channel, weakening quickly to tropical storm status. Upon reaching open waters, convection {{increased over the}} center, and late on March 9 Jokwe re-intensified to a tropical cyclone as an eye reappeared on satellite imagery. The cyclone turned to the south-southeast, around the periphery of a ridge to its east. An upper-level low to its south produced good outflow which, in combination with warm waters, allowed Jokwe to re-intensify. Late on March 10, the storm passed about 35km (21mi) east of Europa Island, and shortly thereafter the MFR upgraded Jokwe to intense tropical cyclone status with winds of 170km/h (105mph). Subsequently, an increase in wind shear caused a steady weakening trend, and by March 12 Jokwe weakened to tropical storm status as its center became partially exposed <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>deep</b> convection; at the same time, the storm turned to the southwest.|$|E
5|$|Ideas <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>Deep</b> convened {{to come up}} {{with the}} design for the game, and Hall {{suggested}} a console-style platformer in the vein of Super Mario Bros., as they had the technology made for it; he further recommended a science fiction theme. John Carmack added the idea of a genius child protagonist saving the world, and Hall quickly created a short summary for the game: a dramatic introduction about eight-year-old genius Billy Blaze, defending the Earth with his spaceship. When he read out the summary in an over-dramatic voice to the group, they laughed and applauded, and the group agreed to begin work on Commander Keen in the Invasion of the Vorticons.|$|E
