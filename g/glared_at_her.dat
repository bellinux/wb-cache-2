2500|$|Her {{dramatic}} and unexpected entrance drew stares from {{the residents of}} the courtroom. Victoria Price, brought out for Bates to identify, <b>glared</b> <b>at</b> <b>her.</b> Attorney General Knight warned Price to [...] "keep your temper." [...] Bates proceeded to testify, and explained that no rape had occurred. She said none of the defendants had touched her or even spoken to her. When asked if she had been raped on March 25, 1931, Bates said, [...] "No sir." [...] When asked why she had initially said she had been raped, Bates replied, [...] "I told it just like Victoria did because she said we might have to stay in jail if we did not frame up a story after crossing a state line with men." [...] Bates explained that Price had said [...] "she didn't care if all the Negroes in Alabama were put in jail." [...] This recantation seemed to be a severe blow to the prosecution.|$|E
6000|$|... "Damn you!" [...] Gombauld repeated, and stamped {{his foot}} again. He <b>glared</b> <b>at</b> <b>her</b> round the half-finished {{portrait}} on the easel.|$|E
60|$|It was unheard-of, this {{invasion}} of a man's argument by a woman, {{and by a}} young woman at that. He <b>glared</b> <b>at</b> <b>her</b> through his spectacles, took them off, wiped them, replaced them, and <b>glared</b> <b>at</b> <b>her</b> again. He did not like Janet; she was capable {{of what may be}} called a speaking silence, and he had never been wholly unaware of her disapproval and ridicule. Perhaps he recognized in her, instinctively, the potential qualities of that emerging modern woman who to him was anathema.|$|E
60|$|Napoleon <b>glares</b> <b>at</b> <b>her</b> in {{speechless}} fury; pockets the pistol; {{and produces}} a whistle.|$|R
60|$|He {{stopped as}} she bade him, and {{commenced}} to pace {{round and round}} her in a semicircle, <b>glaring</b> <b>at</b> <b>her</b> with wild eyes.|$|R
6000|$|The Queen turned crimson with fury, and, after <b>glaring</b> <b>at</b> <b>her</b> for {{a moment}} like a wild beast, screamed 'Off with her head! Off--' ...|$|R
60|$|Puss thereupon <b>glared</b> <b>at</b> <b>her</b> image, {{raised her}} hair in anger, and uttered a defiant mew. The wooden cat paid no attention, and Claus, much amused, laughed again.|$|E
60|$|He <b>glared</b> <b>at</b> <b>her</b> for a moment, then hastened {{after his}} hat which had bounded away to some distance. He came back {{looking at her}} face, which was very white.|$|E
60|$|So {{she went}} on, striding {{at the side}} of the pack-ox, and reviling Pereira in a ceaseless stream of language, until at length he thrust his thumbs into his ears and <b>glared</b> <b>at</b> <b>her</b> in {{speechless}} wrath.|$|E
6000|$|... "Mary Isabel," [...] she said, <b>glaring</b> <b>at</b> <b>her</b> {{sister and}} {{ignoring}} the doctor entirely, [...] "did you mean {{what you said}} in that letter?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Ah! ze lady--madame--ze signora--eh--she wantah me?" [...] {{continued}} Tournelli, {{leaning on}} the table with compressed fingers, and <b>glaring</b> <b>at</b> <b>her.</b> [...] "Perhaps SHE wantah Tournelli--eh?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "It nearly {{broke his}} heart, though, poor dear," [...] said Mrs. Chalk, <b>glaring</b> <b>at</b> <b>her.</b> [...] "He {{said he had}} never had such a time in his life." ...|$|R
60|$|Mrs Wilfer spake no word, but, having <b>glared</b> <b>at</b> <b>her</b> {{offspring}} for {{a minute}} or two in an awful silence, retired into her corner of state backward, and sat down: like a frozen article on sale in a Russian market.|$|E
6000|$|... "Didn't use to!" [...] I said slowly, repeating this twice. I glared up {{and down}} the gallery with short, sharp glances. [...] "We are alone," [...] I said swiftly. [...] "Listen!" [...] I poked my {{forefinger}} towards her, and <b>glared</b> <b>at</b> <b>her.</b> [...] "I am under a curse." ...|$|E
60|$|Mr. Jobling, past speech, {{stood and}} <b>glared</b> <b>at</b> <b>her.</b> Then, with an inarticulate cry, he {{rushed to the}} front door and flung it open. Miss Robinson, fresh and bright, stood smiling outside. Within easy {{distance}} a little group of neighbors were making conversation, while opposite Mr. Brown awaited events.|$|E
6000|$|... "H'm! You {{know best}} what has {{happened}}, madam, I suppose. What hath happened before in our family?" [...] cried the old Baroness, <b>glaring</b> <b>at</b> <b>her</b> niece with savage eyes.|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{came in with}} Mr. Rover; {{he wanted}} me to come," [...] was the answer. And as the teacher {{continued}} to <b>glare</b> <b>at</b> <b>her,</b> Nellie clung tightly to Tom's arm.|$|R
50|$|In the anime, {{the narrator}} tells the tale and {{regularly}} makes sarcastic and offensive {{remarks about the}} characters at which main characters often break the fourth wall to <b>glare</b> <b>at</b> <b>her.</b>|$|R
6000|$|Father stood {{straight}} and <b>glared</b> <b>at</b> <b>her.</b> There was in him {{nothing of the}} weary little man who was in awe of Miss Mitchin's. Even his daughter was impressed. She forgot {{for a moment that}} she was Mrs. Hartwig, now, and had the best phonograph in Saserkopee. But she took one more shot: ...|$|E
60|$|The marquis {{absolutely}} <b>glared</b> <b>at</b> <b>her,</b> as {{she went}} on with her domestic defence. The household at Hurst Staple had been creditably managed, considering the income; and it was natural that she should wish to set her patron right. But every word that she said carried her further away from her present object.|$|E
60|$|He {{stared at}} her from doorways, and <b>glared</b> <b>at</b> <b>her</b> from {{passages}} as she went about with her partners; and the more he stared, the more taken was he. He could scarcely {{believe that this was}} the woman with the red eyes and the black stuff gown who used to weep over the eggs at breakfast.|$|E
6000|$|The nomes {{were so much}} {{astonished}} at this speech that for a time they could only <b>glare</b> <b>at</b> <b>her</b> silently, not finding words to reply. The King finally recovered {{the use of his}} tongue and said: ...|$|R
6000|$|She obeyed, but sat up {{with the}} grey shawl round <b>her</b> lean shoulders, <b>glaring</b> <b>at</b> <b>her</b> sister. [...] "I'm better now," [...] she panted. [...] "Arthurs let me sit out too long. Where's Arthurs? The kettle." ...|$|R
60|$|Lenore became aware, as {{she passed}} the car, that Nash was <b>glaring</b> <b>at</b> <b>her</b> in no unmistakable manner. She had {{forgotten}} all about him. The sight of his jealous face somehow added to her strange exhilaration.|$|R
6000|$|... "In that I must." [...] He <b>glared</b> <b>at</b> <b>her,</b> {{almost as}} though he were going to strike her, but she bore his look without flinching. [...] "I have left all my old friends, Ferdinand, and have given myself heart and soul to you. No woman did so with a truer love or more devoted {{intention}} of doing her duty to her husband. Your affairs shall be my affairs." ...|$|E
60|$|Mrs. Chinnery, who {{was pouring}} out tea, <b>glared</b> <b>at</b> <b>her</b> in silence. She also spared a glance for Captain Trimblett, which made that gentleman seriously uneasy. With {{an idea of}} turning the {{conversation}} into safer and more agreeable channels, he called the old lady’s attention to a pencil drawing of a ruined castle which adorned the opposite wall. Mrs. Willett’s first remark was {{that it had no}} roof.|$|E
60|$|The poor child cried bitterly, calling herself cruel, thoughtless, presumptuous; and for {{the next}} few days Jumbo's eyes <b>glared</b> <b>at</b> <b>her</b> as he {{reported}} his master to be very ill; but, on the third day, he came for her as usual. She thought Mr. Belamour's tones unwontedly low and depressed, but no reference was made to the Sunday, and she was glad enough to plunge into the council of Olympus.|$|E
50|$|An old grey cat stumbles out {{and looks}} around. It is Grizabella. All the cats back away and <b>glare</b> <b>at</b> <b>her</b> with resentment. The cats sing of her saddened, unfortunate state (Grizabella: The Glamour Cat), with Demeter elaborating.|$|R
6000|$|... "YOU {{have made}} a curse of it!" [...] Dolores answered, rising and <b>glaring</b> <b>at</b> <b>her.</b> [...] "You have blighted my life for me. A good man and true {{was going to make}} me his wife. After this, how can I dare to palm myself off upon him?" ...|$|R
60|$|Mr. Beeton {{crossed the}} road under the noses of the omnibuses and arrested Bessie then {{on her way}} northward. She {{recognised}} him as the man in authority who used to <b>glare</b> <b>at</b> <b>her</b> when she passed up Dick"s staircase, and her first impulse was to run.|$|R
60|$|It was {{a moment}} of breathless interest. Who could say what an {{influence}} on her future life might be exercised by this quaint kindly uncouth little foreign man? How anxiously we watched those shaggy eyebrows, those piercing goggle eyes! And, oh, heavens, how disappointed we were at the first result! Lucilla suddenly gave a little irrepressible shudder of disgust. Herr Grosse drew back from her, and <b>glared</b> <b>at</b> <b>her</b> benignantly with his diabolical smile.|$|E
60|$|As soon as {{she went}} to her room, she got out her papers, and {{carefully}} reread every one of her stories. Being a little shortsighted, Mr. Bhaer sometimes used eye glasses, and Jo had tried them once, smiling to see how they magnified the fine print of her book. Now she seemed to have on the Professor's mental or moral spectacles also, for the faults of these poor stories <b>glared</b> <b>at</b> <b>her</b> dreadfully and filled her with dismay.|$|E
6000|$|Without a {{word she}} moved slowly towards the table, and, sitting down, leaned on her elbow, shading {{her eyes with}} her hand. All that time he <b>glared</b> <b>at</b> <b>her</b> watchfully as if expecting every moment to find in her {{deliberate}} movements an answer to his question. But he could not read anything, he could gather no hint of her thought. He tried to suppress his desire to shout, and after waiting awhile, said with incisive scorn: ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Like you," [...] {{repeated}} Razumov, <b>glaring</b> <b>at</b> <b>her</b> face, as {{devoid of}} all comeliness of feature and complexion {{as the most}} miserable beggar is of money. He smiled, still feeling chilly: a peculiar sensation which annoyed him. [...] "Disillusioned as to Peter Ivanovitch! Is that all you have lost?" ...|$|R
60|$|INSTANTLY Barbara Harding {{looked into}} the face of the mucker she read her danger. Why the man should hate her so she could not guess; but that he did was {{evidenced}} by the malevolent expression of his surly countenance. For a moment he stood <b>glaring</b> <b>at</b> <b>her,</b> and then he spoke.|$|R
50|$|Drifting on {{the open}} sea, Epps is found by a cruise ship and {{returned}} to land. As she is loaded into an ambulance, she sees the battered crates of gold being loaded onto the cruise ship by crewmen overseen by Ferriman, who <b>glares</b> <b>at</b> <b>her</b> and carries on; she screams as the ambulance doors close.|$|R
