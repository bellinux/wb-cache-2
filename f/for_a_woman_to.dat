5|$|Unlike the {{majority}} of Trollope's triangles, Mary is not called upon to judge between a good suitor and a bad one, but between two good men. Gilmore {{is presented as a}} sympathetic and admirable character; the reader learns far less about Captain Marrable's character, and is given no reason why Mary should prefer him to his rival. To Trollope, a woman does not necessarily fall in love because of a man's merits; and it is very wrong <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>woman</b> <b>to</b> marry where she does not love, regardless of her suitor's worthy qualities.|$|E
5|$|Elizabeth Rona {{was born}} on 20 March 1890 in Budapest, Hungary, to Ida, (née Mahler) and Samuel Róna. Her father was a prosperous Jewish {{physician}} who worked with Louis Wickham and Henri-August Dominici, founders of radium therapy, to introduce the techniques to Budapest, and installed {{one of the first}} x-ray machines there. Elizabeth wanted to become a physician like her father, but Samuel believed that it would be too difficult <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>woman</b> <b>to</b> attain. Though he died when she was in her second year of university, Rona's father had encouraged her and spurred her interest in science from a young age. She enrolled in the Philosophy Faculty at the University of Budapest, studying chemistry, geochemistry, and physics, receiving her PhD in 1912.|$|E
5|$|The Egyptians also {{interacted with}} deities through the {{donation}} of offerings, ranging from simple bits of jewelry to large and finely carved statues and stelae. Among their contributions were statues that sat in temple courts, serving as memorials to the donors after their deaths and receiving {{portions of the}} temple offerings to sustain the donors' spirits. Other statues served as gifts to the temple god, and inscribed stelae conveyed to the resident deity the donors' prayers and messages of thanks. Over the centuries, {{so many of these}} statues accumulated within a temple building that priests sometimes moved them out of the way by burying them in caches beneath the floor. Commoners offered simple wooden or clay models as votives. The form of these models may indicate the reason for their donation. Figurines of women are among the most common types of votive figures, and some are inscribed with a prayer <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>woman</b> <b>to</b> bear a child.|$|E

5|$|The House of Commons {{backed the}} {{proposals}} strongly, but {{the bill of}} supremacy met opposition in the House of Lords, particularly from the bishops. Elizabeth was fortunate that many bishoprics were vacant at the time, including the Archbishopric of Canterbury. This enabled supporters amongst peers to outvote the bishops and conservative peers. Nevertheless, Elizabeth was forced to accept the title of Supreme Governor of the Church of England rather than the more contentious title of Supreme Head, which many thought unacceptable <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>woman</b> <b>to</b> bear. The new Act of Supremacy became law on 8 May 1559. All public officials were {{to swear an oath}} of loyalty to the monarch as the supreme governor or risk disqualification from office; the heresy laws were repealed, to avoid a repeat of the persecution of dissenters practised by Mary. At the same time, a new Act of Uniformity was passed, which made attendance at church and the use of an adapted version of the 1552 Book of Common Prayer compulsory, though the penalties for recusancy, or failure to attend and conform, were not extreme.|$|E
5|$|The {{family moved}} to Berlin in 1811, leaving Hamburg in {{disguise}} fearing French revenge for the Mendelssohn bank's role in breaking Napoleon's Continental System blockade. Abraham and Lea Mendelssohn sought to give their children– Fanny, Felix, Paul and Rebecka– the best education possible. Fanny became a well-known pianist and amateur composer; originally Abraham had thought that she, rather than Felix, would be the more musical. But at that time, it was not considered proper, by either Abraham or Felix, <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>woman</b> <b>to</b> have a career in music, so Fanny remained an active but non-professional musician. Abraham was also disinclined to allow Felix to follow a musical career until {{it became clear that}} he seriously intended to dedicate himself to it.|$|E

25|$|Using {{synthetic}} hormones, it {{is possible}} <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>woman</b> <b>to</b> completely eliminate menstrual periods. When using progestogen implants, menstruation may be reduced to 3 or 4 menstrual periods per year. By taking progestogen-only contraceptive pills (sometimes called the 'mini-pill') continuously without a 7-day span of using placebo pills, menstrual periods do not occur. Some women do this simply for convenience in the short-term, while others prefer to eliminate periods altogether when possible.|$|E
25|$|After the holiday, eating {{from the}} etrog or etrog jam is {{considered}} a segula (efficacious remedy) <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>woman</b> <b>to</b> have an easy childbirth. A common Ashkenazi custom is to save the etrog until Tu Bishvat and eat it in candied form or as succade, accompanied by prayers that the worshiper will merit a beautiful etrog next Sukkot. Some families make jam or liqueur out of it, or stick cloves in the skin for use as besamim at the havdalah ceremony after Shabbat.|$|E

According to the United Nations, of women between the ages 15 and 19, 34 percent had already been married. Polygamy is forbidden, although it still happens.

The Hanafi school has thus obliged women to cover their faces in front of strangers.|$|E

50|$|Raknerud {{was raised}} in Kristiania (today's Oslo) where her father Hagbarth August Grøntoft (1847-84) was a merchant. She spent three years at the Christiania Kunst- og Haandværksskole, {{receiving}} training in architecture (1895-97). After completing her studies, she trained with Ove Ekman and Holger Sinding-Larsen. In 1898, she designed Sandsgården, a large house in Gjøvik complete with shops and offices. Her signed plans dated May 1898 are in the municipal archives.

25|$|Initially, {{the priesthood}} in the Episcopal Church was {{restricted}} to men only, as was true of most other Christian denominations prior to the mid-20th century and still true for some.

Some believe that it is fundamentally impossible <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>woman</b> <b>to</b> be validly ordained, while others believe it is possible but inappropriate. Considerations cited include local social conditions, ecumenical implications, or the symbolic character of the priesthood, an ancient tradition including an all male priesthood, as well as certain biblical texts.|$|E
