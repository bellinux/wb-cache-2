40|$|The {{inhalation}} {{of flour}} dust has {{been implicated in}} the induction of sensitisation and elici-tation of respiratory symptoms, such as asthma in bakers. In addition to the cereal allergens present in wheat flour, enzymes in <b>flour</b> <b>improvers,</b> in particular fungal alpha-amylase, are now {{known to be a}} significant cause of respiratory allergy in the baking industry. A monoclonal antibody based enzyme-linked immunoassay (ELISA) was developed using two monoclonal antibodies that recognised two distinct epitopes of the fungal alpha-amylase enzyme. The ELISA had an inter-assay variation of 12. 0 % at 1360 pg/ml and 12. 8 % at 564 pg/ml and intra-assay variation of 4. 9 % at 1340 pg/ml and 6. 1 % at 504 pg/ml. The assay had a sensitivity of 200 pg/ml. Competitive inhibition assays confirmed that the monoclonal antibodies had no cross reactivity with other enzymes used in the baking industry and could distinguish added fungal alpha-amylase from cereal amylase. We assessed the levels of exposure to dust, total protein and fungal alpha-amylase in four UK bakeries ranging in size and technical capabilities. Within the bakeries we surveyed, workers were exposed to variable levels of inhalable dust (0. 8 – 39. 8 mg/m 3), total protein (0 – 5. 7 mg/m 3) and fungal alpha-amylase (0 – 29. 8 ng/m 3).

40|$|In some of {{the more}} recent studies on the {{improver}} problem, one line of attack has been the determination of the rate of reduction or decomposition of the improvers by flours and doughs. Thus the decomposition of bromate in fermenting and nonfermenting doughs has been followed by Cunningham and Anderson (12) by means of amperometic titration, while Lee, Tkachuk and Finlayson (13) have measured the conversion of bromate to bromide in fermenting and nonfermenting doughs and in baked bread by use of radioactive bromine - 82 as tracer. Detailed studies on persulfate, however, are still lacking. A fluorometric method for the determination of persulfate in flour and dough has been reported (14). It was claimed to be sensitive for the quantitative determination of as little as 5 to 10 parts ammonium persulfate per million parts of flour or dough. The method involves the re-oxidation of leuco-fluorescein to fluorescein through the action of persulfate ion. Under controlled conditions, the intensity of the developed fluorescence bears a reproducible relationship to the persulfate content of the sample. Since persulfates are used only in the order of 200 p. p. m., the measurement by ordinary analytical means of such minute amounts of improver in relatively large quantities of flour is, at best, rather difficult. The application of radioactive tracers, with its high sensitivity and the ease of identification of the labeled compounds by the carrier technique, provides an excellent tool for determining the fate of <b>flour</b> <b>improvers</b> in dough systems. Conn and coworkers (15), for example, have used I 131 -labeled potassium iodate to investigate the decomposition of iodate during the baking of bread, and have shown the major decomposition product to be iodide. In the present work, the degrees of reduction of s 35 -labeled persulfate to sulfate are determined for water slurries of flour and of gluten, and for nonfermenting doughs prepared from ordinary and defatted flours...|$|E

40|$|KBrO 3 is {{registered}} by the FAO/OMS as a genotoxic and carcinogenic compound. In {{spite of}} this, KBrO 3 is still employed by Brazilian bakeries. Nowadays ion exchange chromatography (IEC) {{is the most}} rapid and trustful method for BrO 3 - analysis. When at high concentrations, chloride ions can interfere in the BrO 3 - analysis, if the detection is performed by electrical conductivity. On the other hand, spectrophotometric detection, presented here {{is based on the}} absorption of BrO 3 - in the ultraviolet region (210 - 230 nm) where the absortion of chloride ions is very low, thus making possible the qualitative and quantitative analysis of BrO 3 - in <b>flour</b> <b>improver</b> samples...|$|R
50|$|Although banned for use {{in foods}} by many countries, {{potassium}} bromate is typically used in the United States as a <b>flour</b> <b>improver</b> (E number E924). It acts to strengthen the dough and to allow higher rising. It is an oxidizing agent, and under the right conditions will be completely used up in the baking bread. However, if too much is added, or if the bread is not baked long enough or not at a high enough temperature, then a residual amount will remain, which may be harmful if consumed. Potassium bromate might also {{be used in the}} production of malt barley, for which application the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has prescribed certain safety conditions, including labeling standards for the finished malt barley product. It is a very powerful oxidizer (E° = 1.5 volts, comparable to potassium permanganate).|$|R
40|$|Abstract: In {{order to}} improve its {{stability}} and catalytic rate in flour, the immobilization of glucose oxidase (GOX) was investigated in this work. The enzyme was encapsulated in calcium alginate-chitosan microspheres (CACM) using an emulsification-internal gelation-GOX adsorption-chitosan coating method. The interaction between alginate and chitosan was confirmed by infrared spectroscopy (IR). The resultant CACM in wet state, whose morphology was investigated by scanning electron microscopy (SEM), was spherical with a mean diameter of about 26 μm. The GOX load, encapsulation efficiency and activity of the CACM-GOX were influenced by concentration of chitosan, encapsulation time and encapsulation pH. The highest total enzymatic activity and encapsulation efficiency was achieved when the pH of the adsorption medium was near the isoelectric point (pI) of GOX, approximately pH 4. 0. In addition, the molecular weight of chitosan also evidently influenced the encapsulation efficiency. Storage stabilities of GOX samples were investigated continuously over two months and the retained activity of CACM-GOX was 70. 4 %, markedly higher than the 7. 5 % of free enzyme. The results reveal the great potential of CACM-GOX as a <b>flour</b> <b>improver...</b>|$|R
40|$|Whey powder, {{due to its}} lactose {{and protein}} contents, {{can be used as}} an {{important}} <b>flour</b> <b>improver</b> to decrease the rate of staling. In the present investigation, whey powder was added at 5 levels (zero to 5 %, W/W) to the flour of Sangak bread. Bread was baked according to the formula and procedure used by traditional Sangak bakeries. Bread samples were kept at room temperature or under refrigeration for 36 hours. They were then evaluated for staling by a taste panel. They were also subjected to proximate analysis. The dough was examined for farinographic, amylographic, extensographic and fermentographic properties. The data of staling tests including color, texture, flavor and also proximate analysis data were analyzed by ANOVA. Finally, differences among treatments were examined by Ducan’s multiple range procedure. The results indicated that the best treatment was the use of 3 % whey powder, as far as staling and texture of bread are concerned. However, the best color of bread was achieved with 5 % whey powder; so was true of the protein, ash and fat contents. Viscosity, as tested by amylography, and also parameters of farinography reached their highest levels in the dough prepared from flour having 5 % whey powder in the formula. The best extensibility was observed with the flours containing 4 % whey powder and the highest dough energy was associated with the dough prepared from flour having 5 % whey powder. As for the loaf volume, best results were obtained with the dough prepared from flour having 3 % whey powder. Overall, it is concluded that the use of 3 % whey powder is the best treatment with regard to the delay in the rate of staling, increase in loaf volume, and color appeal of Sangak bread, and rheological properties of the dough...|$|R
40|$|White flour from {{soft and}} durum wheat cultivars {{produced}} in Saudi Arabia (Edwal and Yovaros respectively) {{were used to}} replace white flour from bread wheat cultivar (Yecorarojo) in bread at 0 %, 25 % and 50 % replacement levels. Breads were evaluated by volume measurement and sensory evaluation scores of external appearance, crust color, grain, texture, and color of the crumb. Before adding commercial bread <b>improver,</b> <b>flour</b> from soft and durum wheat cultivars were found to cause deterioration in bread volume, external appearance, gain, texture and color of the crumb, which increased with increasing concentration both soft and durum wheat flour, but to a larger extent with durum wheat flour. Results of chemical composition and rheological tests indicated that folour from soft and durum wheat cultivars contained weak or medium strong gluten respectively. In addition, both physical and chemical characteristics of after adding a commercial bread improver (containing ascorbic acid, lactic acid esters of mono and diglycerides of fatty acids and an amylase enzymes) at 0. 3 % of flour weight, breads containing 25 % soft or durum wehat flour were similar to the 100 % bread wheat flour control in all aspects except for being relatively smaller in volume...|$|R
5000|$|During World War II, the British {{government}} promoted [...] "National Flour"; it {{was adopted}} in 1942 both {{for health reasons}} and those concerned about the import of wheat into the UK and losses during the war. The flour is described as being of 85% extraction, i.e. containing more of the whole wheat grain than refined flour, generally described as 70% extraction at the time. Parliamentary questions on the exact constitution of National Flour in 1943 reveal that it was [...] "milled from a grist consisting of 90 per cent. wheat and 10 per cent. diluent grains. Authorised additions are calcium {{at the rate of}} 7 oz per 280 lb of flour and dried milk at the rate of 2 lb per 280 lb of <b>flour</b> and customary <b>improvers</b> in normal proportions." [...] The diluent grains were barley, oats and rye and customary improvers were [...] "certain oxidising agents which improve the quality of the bread baked from the flour, and their nature depends on the kind of grain used, whether hard or soft.". A survey of the composition of National Flour was conducted for the period 1946-1950 National Flour was discontinued in 1956 against the recommendations of the MRC as the government considered that the addition of nutritional supplements to refined flour removed the necessity for using National Flour on health grounds.|$|R
