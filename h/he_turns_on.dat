500|$|The {{songs on}} The High End of Low {{appear on the}} album in {{the order in which}} they were written. The album {{contains}} material which spans across a wide variety of genres, such as industrial metal, glam rock, garage rock, blues, country, and synthpop. Its first track, [...] "Devour", is a mid-tempo rock song which begins with an acoustic guitar, with heavy drums and distorted, screamed vocals becoming more prominent as it progresses. It was written in response to the [...] "Shakespearean ideal of romance" [...] presented on Eat Me, Drink Me. Lana Cooper of PopMatters said the song [...] "runs an emotional gauntlet", and could [...] "very well be the most depressing break-up song of all time. The lonely plink of guitar strings being tuned give way to Manson's soul-wrenching eruption of [...] "And I'll love you / If you'll let me". [...] <b>he</b> <b>turns</b> <b>on</b> a dime, and a few lines later is vowing revenge, spitting [...] "I will blow your heart to pieces." [...] Metal Hammer later included it on their list of the 10 most underrated Marilyn Manson songs.|$|E

Once he arrives at his house, <b>he</b> <b>turns</b> <b>on</b> the radio where Veronica plays [...] "No Sé Olvidar" [...] on the radio station. Fernández glances at the photos of him and Veronica and burns them at the fireplace. He steps outside but still cannot forget the time he spent with her and imagines Veronica next to him. He exercises as another attempt to forget but to no avail. Fernández takes a shower and hallucinates Veronica being next to him and holding him. Fernández begins to lose his mind and breaks the house furniture. He picks up another photo of him and Veronica, lits it on fire, and proceeds to set the house on fire. At the end of the song, Veronica asks Fernández for forgiveness on the radio. [...] "The video ends with a quote in Spanish, translating to [...] "Not even fire can consume the soul...".

500|$|On 2 July, {{the show}} publicised that the {{character}} would be killed off. The show's producers decided to keep detail of how Kylie would die a secret. But Kilkelly of Digital Spy described it as [...] "tragic". Kylie decides she can no longer {{live in the house}} where Callum died and convinces David that they must move away. The reporter added that the Platt family would not succeed in their move because Kylie would die in a [...] "storyline twist". The following day Coronation Street released promotional images depicting David mourning Kylie over her open coffin. Lane described Kylie's death as one of the [...] "most shocking" [...] ever featured on the show. Shepherd described it as a [...] "harrowing exit" [...] for the character, at which he and Lane cried uncontrollably. He added that writers warned him in advance that it would be [...] "very harrowing and emotional". Newspaper photographs later revealed Kylie would die on Coronation Street. The picture showed her body being clutched in David's arms. Kylie's death scenes occurred following her decision to defend Gemma after she is attacked by Clayton Hibbs (Callum Harrison). <b>He</b> <b>turns</b> <b>on</b> Kylie and stabs her and she dies in the street with David by her side. The death scene led many viewers to mourn the on-screen death of the fictional character, via social media website Twitter.

She began to push right through it with her 'Sir, how dare you?' manner--Honestly, sometimes when I look at her and see how she's always so made up and stinking of perfume and looking for trouble and kind of always yelping, 'I tell yuh I'm a lady, damn yuh!'--why, I want to kill her! Well, she keeps elbowing through the crowd, me after her, feeling good and ashamed, till she's almost up to the velvet rope and ready to be the next let in. But there was a little squirt of a man there--probably been waiting half an hour--I kind of admired the little cuss--and <b>he</b> <b>turns</b> <b>on</b> Zilla and says, perfectly polite, 'Madam, why are you trying to push past me?'

'You should have a man like the old heroes--you need to stand behind him as he goes into battle, you need to SEE his strength, and to HEAR his shout--. You need a man {{physically}} strong, and virile in his will, NOT a sensitive man--.' There was a break, as if the pythoness had uttered the oracle, and now the woman went on, in a rhapsody-wearied voice: 'And you see, Rupert isn't this, he isn't. He is frail in health and body, he needs great, great care. Then he is so changeable and unsure of himself--it requires the greatest patience and understanding to help him. And I don't think you are patient. You would {{have to be prepared to}} suffer--dreadfully. I can't TELL you how much suffering it would take to make him happy. He lives an INTENSELY spiritual life, at times--too, too wonderful. And then come the reactions. I can't speak of what I have been through with him. We have been together so long, I really do know him, I DO know what he is. And I feel I must say it; I feel it would be perfectly DISASTROUS for you to marry him--for you even more than for him.' Hermione lapsed into bitter reverie. 'He is so uncertain, so unstable--he wearies, and then reacts. I couldn't TELL you what his re-actions are. I couldn't TELL you the agony of them. That which he affirms and loves one day--a little latter <b>he</b> <b>turns</b> <b>on</b> it in a fury of destruction. He is never constant, always this awful, dreadful reaction. Always the quick change from good to bad, bad to good. And nothing is so devastating, nothing--' ...|$|E
6000|$|... [There is a {{long pause}} during which they are lurking in the shadows. At last they hear some movement, and they steal like ghosts from the room. We see DAVID turning out the lobby light; then the door closes and an empty room awaits the {{intruder}} with a shudder of expectancy. The window opens and shuts as softly {{as if this were}} a mother peering in to see whether her baby is asleep. Then the head of a man shows between the curtains. The remainder of him follows. He is carrying a little carpet bag. He stands irresolute; what puzzles him evidently is that the Wylies should have retired to rest without lifting that piece of coal off the fire. He opens the door and peeps into the lobby, listening to the wag-at-the-wall clock. All seems serene, and <b>he</b> <b>turns</b> <b>on</b> the light. We see him clearly now. He is JOHN SHAND, age twenty-one, boots muddy, as an indignant carpet can testify. He wears a shabby topcoat and a cockerty bonnet; otherwise he is in the well- worn corduroys of a railway porter. His movements, at first stealthy, become almost homely as he feels that he is secure. He opens the bag and takes out a bunch of keys, a small paper parcel, and a black implement that may be a burglar's jemmy. This cool customer examines the fire and piles on more coals. With the keys he opens the door of the bookcase, selects two large volumes, and brings them to the table. He takes off his topcoat and opens his parcel, which we now see contains sheets of foolscap paper. His next action shows that the 'jemmy' is really a ruler. He knows where the pen and ink are kept. He pulls the fine chair nearer to the table, sits on it, and proceeds to write, occasionally dotting the carpet with ink as he stabs the air with his pen. He is so occupied that he does not see the door opening, and the Wylie family staring at him. They are armed with sticks.] ...|$|E

6000|$|This eternal [...] "swowing of a flode" [...] was {{the sound}} made by the {{circling}} stream of Oceanus, as <b>he</b> <b>turns</b> <b>on</b> his bed, washing {{the base of the}} White Rock, and the sands of the region of dreams. So we fleeted onwards till we came to marvellous lofty gates of black adamant, that rose before us like the steep side of a hill. On {{the left side of the}} gates we beheld a fountain flowing from beneath the roots of a white cypress-tree, and to this fountain my guide forbade me to draw near. [...] "There is another yonder," [...] he said, pointing to the right hand, [...] "a stream of still water that issues from the Lake of Memory, and there are guards who keep that stream from the lips of the profane. Go to them and speak thus: 'I am the child of earth and of the starry sky, yet heavenly is my lineage, and this yourselves know right well. But I am perishing with thirst, so give me speedily of that still water which floweth forth of the mere of Memory.' And they will give thee to drink of that spring divine, and then shalt thou dwell with the heroes and the blessed." [...] So I did as he said, and went before the guardians of the water. Now they were veiled, and their voices, when they answered me, seemed to come from far away. [...] "Thou comest to the pure, from the pure," [...] they said, [...] "and thou art a suppliant of holy Persephone. Happy and most blessed art thou, advance to the reward of the crown desirable, and be no longer mortal, but divine." [...] Then a darkness fell upon me, and lifted again like mist on the hills, and we found ourselves in the most beautiful place that can be conceived, a meadow of that short grass which grows on some shores beside the sea. There were large spaces of fine and solid turf, but, where the little streams flowed from the delicate-tinted distant mountains, there were narrow valleys full of all the flowers of a southern spring. Here grew narcissus and hyacinths, violets and creeping thyme, and crocus and the crimson rose, as they blossomed on the day when the milk-white bull carried off Europa. Beyond the level land beside the sea, between these coasts and the far-off hills, was a steep lonely rock, on which were set the shining temples of the Grecian faith. The blue seas that begirt the coasts were narrow, and ran like rivers between many islands not less fair than the country to which we were come, while other isles, each with its crest of clear-cut hills, lay westward, far away, and receding into the place of the sunset. Then I recognized the Fortunate Islands spoken of by Pindar, and the paradise of the Greeks. [...] "Round these the ocean breezes blow and golden flowers are glowing, some from the land on trees of splendour, and some the water feedeth, with wreaths whereof they entwine their hands." [...] {124} And, as Pindar says again, [...] "for them shineth below the strength of the sun, while in our world it is night, and the space of crimson-flowered meadows before their city is full of the shade of frankincense-trees and of fruits of gold. And some in horses and in bodily feats, and some in dice, and some in harp-playing have delight, and among them thriveth all fair flowering bliss; and fragrance ever streameth through the lovely land as they mingle incense of every kind upon the altars of the gods." [...] In this beautiful country I took great delight, now watching the young men leaping and running (and they were marvellously good over a short distance of ground), now sitting in a chariot whereto were harnessed steeds swifter than the wind, like those that, Homer says, [...] "the gods gave, glorious gifts, to Peleus." [...] And the people, young and old, received me kindly, welcoming me in their Greek speech, which was like the sound of music. And because I had ever been a lover of them and of their tongue, my ears were opened to understand them, though they spoke not Greek as we read it. Now when I had beheld many of the marvels of the Fortunate Islands, and had sat at meat with those kind hosts (though I only made semblance to eat of what they placed before me), and had seen the face of Rhadamanthus of the golden hair, who is the lord of that country, my friends told me that there was come among them one of my own nation who seemed most sad and sorrowful, and they could make him no mirth. Then they carried me to a house in a grove, and all around it a fair garden, and a well in the midst.|$|E
