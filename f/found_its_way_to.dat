5|$|Instead, {{under the}} novel {{conditions}} of attrition warfare, war pigeons in their traditional role as pigeon post saw a renaissance. Neubronner's mobile dovecote <b>found</b> <b>its</b> <b>way</b> <b>to</b> the Battle of Verdun, where it proved so advantageous that similar facilities were {{used on a}} larger scale in the Battle of the Somme. After the war, the War Ministry responded to Neubronner's inquiry to the effect that the use of pigeons in aerial photography had no military value and further experiments were not justified.|$|E
5|$|Historian Luis Alberto Sánchez writes that, after Morris {{closed his}} bar, {{some of his}} {{bartender}}s left to work in other locales. Bruiget began working as a bartender for the nearby Grand Hotel Maury, where he continued to serve his pisco sour recipe. His success with the drink led local Limean oral tradition to associate the Hotel Maury as the original home of the pisco sour. As other former apprentices of Morris found other work, they also spread the pisco sour recipe. During the 1930s the drink made its way into California, reaching bars {{as far north as}} the city of San Francisco. By at least the late 1960s the cocktail also <b>found</b> <b>its</b> <b>way</b> <b>to</b> New York.|$|E
5|$|Local {{promoter}} Randy Hauser {{became aware}} of the band at a concert and offered to pay for demo recordings. However, one day before the band was due to record at the Music Bank studio in Washington, police shut down the studio during the biggest cannabis raid {{in the history of the}} state. The final demo, completed in 1988, was named The Treehouse Tapes and <b>found</b> <b>its</b> <b>way</b> <b>to</b> the music managers Kelly Curtis and Susan Silver, who also managed the Seattle-based band Soundgarden. Curtis and Silver passed the demo on to Columbia Records' A representative Nick Terzo, who set up an appointment with label president Don Ienner. Based on The Treehouse Tapes, Terzo signed Alice in Chains to Columbia in 1989. The band also recorded another untitled demo over a three-month period in 1989. This recording can be found on the bootleg release Sweet Alice.|$|E

5|$|Material {{assigned}} to Plateosaurus {{has been found}} at over 50 localities in Germany (mainly along the Neckar and Pegnitz river valleys), Switzerland (Frick) and France. Three localities are of special importance, because they yielded specimens in large numbers and of unusually good quality: near Halberstadt in Saxony-Anhalt, Germany; Trossingen in Baden-Württemberg, Germany; and Frick. Between the 1910s and 1930s, excavations in a clay pit in Saxony-Anhalt revealed between 39 and 50 skeletons that belonged to Plateosaurus, along with teeth and {{a small number of}} bones of the theropod Liliensternus, and two skeletons and some fragments of the turtle Proganochelys. Some of the plateosaur material was {{assigned to}} P.longiceps, a species described by palaeontologist Otto Jaekel in 1914 but now considered a junior synonym of P.engelhardti. Most of the material <b>found</b> <b>its</b> <b>way</b> <b>to</b> the Museum für Naturkunde in Berlin, where much of it was destroyed during World War II. The Halberstadt quarry today is covered by a housing development.|$|E
5|$|The {{depression}} had <b>found</b> <b>its</b> <b>way</b> <b>to</b> {{the southwestern}} quadrant {{of a large}} anticyclone aloft, allowing for continued strengthening. Both the JMA and the JTWC upgraded the system to a tropical storm midday on November 12, when it gained the name Nepartak from the JMA. Simultaneously, the cyclone entered the area of responsibility of the Philippine Atmospheric, Geophysical and Astronomical Services Administration, which named it Tropical Storm Weng. Meteorologically, the storm began to exhibit improved outflow and deepening convection as it neared the central Philippines. At around 1600 UTC on November 13, Nepartak made landfall on northern Samar Island in the Philippines before traversing {{the remainder of the}} archipelago from east to west. The cyclone emerged into the South China Sea briefly weakened and with reduced forward motion, but quickly resumed its intensification trend as it turned more toward the northwest.
