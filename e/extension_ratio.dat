An equation which defines the critical <b>extension</b> <b>ratio</b> for a given value of a parameter, &# 954;, was derived and the corresponding critical load, pc, is related to the critical cavity <b>extension</b> <b>ratio.</b> Plots for the <b>extension</b> <b>ratio</b> and normalized pressure were provided solving the appropriate equation derived from the analysis.

We find that checking compatibility is equivalent to inspecting whether every block on the diagonal has a rank one positive extension, and that the necessary and sufficient conditions of the uniqueness, if the given conditional densities are compatible, is that the ratio matrix itself is irreducible.

40|$|A {{method is}} {{developed}} for analyzing in a unified manner both uniaxial and uniform biaxial strain {{data obtained from}} nearly isotropic tissues. The formulation is a direct application of nonlinear elasticity theory pertaining to large deformations. The general relation between Eulerian stress (σ) and <b>extension</b> <b>ratio</b> (λ) in soft isotropic elastic bodies undergoing uniform deformation takes the simple form: σ = ((λ 3 - 1) /λ) f(λ), where f(λ) must be determined for each material. The <b>extension</b> <b>ratio</b> may be either greater than 1. 0 (uniaxial elongation), or lie between zero and 1. 0 (uniform biaxial extension). Simple analytical functions for f(λ) are most readily found for each tissue by plotting all data as (λ 3 - 1) /λσ vs. λ. Of those tissues investigated in this way (dog pericardium and pleura, and cat mesentery and dura), all but pleura could be adequately described by a parabola: 1 /f(λ) = 1 /k{[(λM - λ) (λ - λm) ]/[λM - λm}. In these instances, three material constants per tissue (K, λM, λm) served to predict approximately the stresses attained during both small and large deformations, in strips and sheets alike. It was further found that the uniaxial strain asymptote (λM) was linearly related to the biaxial strain asymptote (ΛM), thus effectively {{reducing the number of}} constants by one...|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT: Novel {{types of}} main-chain, lyotropic liquid-crystalline polymer {{networks}} consisting of polyisocyanate chains were prepared by hydrosilation cross-linking. The characteristic liquid-crystalline band texture generated by shearing these {{networks in the}} swollen state was found to persist much longer than {{in the case of}} solutions of the same polymer in the un-cross-linked state, suggesting preservation of increased chain orientation. A series of these gels were deformed by application of suitable stresses and then dried in the strained state, in an orientation technique developed to improve the properties of networks consisting of such semiflexible polymers. The mechanical properties of the oriented films were then carefully examined as a function of their processing history: curing temperature, curing time, sol fraction, equilibrium swelling ratio, cross-link length, and polymer concentration during deformation. In the case of uniaxial extension, the tensile strengths and moduli of these oriented films increased 5 - 7 fold in the orientation direction. As expected, however, their mechanical properties in the perpendicular direction were diminished. Equibiaxial extension was found to have the advantage of giving mechanical properties that were uniform in the plane of the films and gave more than 2 -fold increases in tensile strength and modulus at <b>extension</b> <b>ratios</b> during drying as small as 20 %! The conclusion that these improvements were due to long-range ordering of the chains was verified by birefringence measurements...|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT: The Nagai {{formulation}} of segmental orientation in stretched polymer chains {{is applied to}} segmental orientation in amorphous elastomeric networks under biaxial deformation. The orientation of a reference vector, m, rigidly affied to a chain of the biaxially drawn network is investigated. The orientation of m is characterized by two orientation functions, S, and S,, where x and y are the laboratory-fmed axes along which the macroscopic biaxial deformation is prescribed. Expressions for S, and S, are obtained {{in the form of}} a series expansion, grouped into terms depending on their order with respect to lln, and on the magnitude of applied deformation. Expressions including terms up to the fourth power of lln (n = number of chain repeat units) and eighth power of the <b>extension</b> <b>ratios</b> are derived. Configurational averages appearing in the coefficients of the expression for the orientation functions are obtained by Monte Carlo simulation for a poly(ethy 1 ene) -like model chain with 100 bonds. Different levels of approximation for S, and S, comprising terms linear and second order in l/n, are compared. The limits of validity of the expressions are discussed in relation to finite chain extensibility. Results of calculations show that the segmental orientation S, is strongly affected by finite extensions imposed along the transverse direction, y. When the strains are made infinitesimally small, however, S, is demonstrated to be uncoupled from the strain applied along the y-direction...|$|R
40|$|In Part I {{three types}} of {{symmetrical}} deformations of thin cylindrical rubber tubes are discussed. In the first type a rubber tube is deformed into another circular cylindrical tube of different length and diameter by simultaneous inflation and extension of the tube. This deformation is useful in determining the mechanical properties of tube-like material and {{it was found that}} Rivlin-Saunder form of strain-energy fitted a particular latex rubber used in our experiments. The second and third types of deformation are a tube deformed by a longitudinal stretching or an increase in internal pressure to a curved surface of revolution. A number of numerical examples were worked out with a view toward designing experiments to determine mechanical properties of short cylindrical tubes. In Part II experimental studies on the overall mechanical properties of large blood vessels are presented. Two Lagrangian stresses and two <b>extension</b> <b>ratios</b> are used to describe the stress and strain states of the vessels subjected to symmetrical deformations. The interested deformation range is about ten to twenty percent in the neighborhood of the natural state. Tests consisted of (1) a longitudinal stretching while the diameter of the vessels was maintained, (2) a lateral distension with the length of the vessels unchanged, and (3) repeated stretching of the vessels at low frequency. The first two tests show that the stress-strain law of the vessels tested is highly nonlinear and the vessels behave more rigidly in the longitudinal direction than in the lateral direction. The last test shows that the vessels are more likely to behave as a plastic elastic metal and a higher tangential modulus was observed for the vessels stretched at a smaller oscillation amplitude...|$|R

Four hundred and thirty-eight (n= 438) healthy South African males, between the ages of 16 and 29 years were used as subjects. A Cybex 340 isokinetic dynamometer was used to determine concentric peak torque of the non-dominant elbow's flexion and extension, using two different handgrip positions.

Nastran large-strain large-deformation analysis and the Blatz-Ko large deformation theory were {{used to calculate the}} equal-biaxial {{stress concentration}} factors K. The results show that the values of K calculated from the Blatz-Ko theory and Nastran are extremely close.

40|$|Achalasia is {{considered}} a primary motility disorder confined to the oesophagus. The lower oesophageal sphincter (LOS) in achalasia is frequently hypertonic and manifests absent or incomplete relaxation in response to deglution. On the other hand, the LOS and the proximal stomach act physiologically as a functional unit whereby relaxation of the LOS during deglution is associated with receptive relaxation of the proximal stomach. Thus, this study investigated the hypothesis that impaired LOS relaxation in patients with achalasia might be associated with impaired relaxation of the proximal stomach. The study consisted of 20 patients with achalasia and 10 healthy controls. Gastric tone variations were quantified using an electronic barostat. Firstly, the study established the basal gastric tone (intragastric volume at the minimal distending pressure+ 1 mm Hg) and gastric compliance (volume/pressure relation) during isobaric distension (increasing stepwise the intragastric pressure from 0 to 20 mm Hg up to 600 ml). Secondly, the gastric tone response to cold stress (hand immersion into ice water for five minutes) or to control stimuli (water at 37 degrees) was determined. Basal gastric tone mean (SEM) was similar in achalasia and in healthy controls (125 (9) ml v 138 (9) ml, respectively). Compliance was linear and similar in both groups, which also showed similar gastric <b>extension</b> <b>ratios</b> (58 (7) ml/mm Hg v 57 (6) ml/mm Hg). Cold stress induced a gastric relaxatory response that, as a group, was significantly lower in achalasia than in healthy controls (volume: 43 (20) ml v 141 (42) ml; p 100 ml) relaxatory responses whereas four of the 10 healthy controls did not. In conclusion, reflex gastric relaxation is impaired in most patients with achalasia showing that the proximal stomach, and not exclusively the oesophagus, may be effected by the disease...|$|R
40|$|Force {{relaxation}} and permanent deformation processes in erythrocyte membrane were investigated with two techniques: micropipette aspiration of {{a portion of}} a flaccid cell, and extension of a whole cell between two micropipettes. In both experiments, at surface <b>extension</b> <b>ratios</b> less than 3 : 1, the extent of residual membrane deformation is negligible when the time of extension is less than several minutes. However, extensions maintained longer result in significant force {{relaxation and}} permanent deformation. The magnitude of the permanent deformation is proportional to the total time period of extension and the level of the applied force. Based on these observations, a nonlinear constitutive relation for surface deformation is postulated that serially couples a hyperelastic membrane component to a linear viscous process. In contrast with the viscous dissipation of energy as heat that occurs in rapid extension of a viscoelastic solid, or in plastic flow of a material above yield, the viscous process in this case represents dissipation produced by permanent molecular reorganization through relaxation of structural membrane components. Data from these experiments determine a characteristic time constant for force relaxation, tau, which is the ratio of a surface viscosity, eta to the elastic shear modulus, mu. Because {{it was found that the}} concentration of albumin in the cell suspension strongly mediates the rate of force relaxation, values for tau of 10. 1, 40. 0, 62. 8, and 120. 7 min are measured at albumin concentrations of 0. 0, 0. 01, 0. 1, and 1. % by weight in grams, respectively.
