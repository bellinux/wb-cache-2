At the same time, the victim's face is depicted with [...] "the serene beauty of a fallen Siegfried, unimpressed by his humiliation, retaining a steadfast, and perhaps ultimately foolish, faith in cosmic justice". Maidman wrote: [...] "It is a scene of squalid and pervasive evil. It is an evil in collusion with a wicked metaphysics, and therefore an evil from which there is no <b>exit</b> <b>save</b> death." ...|$|E

Alerts will typically notify the investor {{to buy or sell}} a stock, or notify an investor when a stock enters or <b>exits</b> his/her <b>saved</b> strategy.

5000|$|Sigil {{is located}} atop the Spire in the Outlands. It has {{the shape of}} a torus; the city itself is located on the inner surface of the ring. There is no sky, simply an all-pervasive light that waxes and wanes to create day and night. Sigil cannot be entered or <b>exited</b> <b>save</b> via portals; {{although}} this makes it quite safe from any would-be invader, it also makes it a prison of sorts for those not possessing a portal key. Thus, sometimes Sigil is called [...] "The Cage". [...] Though Sigil is pseudo-geographically located [...] "at the center of the planes" [...] (where it is positioned atop the infinitely tall Spire), scholars argue that this is impossible since the planes are infinite in all dimensions, and therefore there can never truly be a center to any or all of them; thus, Sigil is of no special importance. Curiously, from the Outlands one can see Sigil atop the supposedly infinite Spire.|$|R

5000|$|In {{the years}} when it {{was known as the}} Indianapolis Transit System, its {{standard}} fleet consisted mostly of dark orange/silverside GM Old Looks and GM New Looks, the latter 40 foot coaches and air-conditioned. When it became the Indianapolis Public Transportation Corporation (adopting the Metro name) in 1975, the New Looks would become the workhorse of the fleet, with the agency adding AM General, GM's RTS-II series, GMDD Canada New Looks, and Orion I to the lineup as the New Looks were starting to show its age by the mid-1990s. These buses were painted white with brown-gold-brown stripes and the [...] "Metro" [...] name next to the <b>exit</b> door (<b>save</b> for the Canadian New Looks, which sported a bold black top around its windows) up until the change to the IndyGo branding in 1996.|$|R

5000|$|An exit {{strategy}} {{is a means}} of leaving one's current situation, either after a predetermined objective has been achieved, justifying premises or decision markers for any given operational planning changed substantially, or as a strategy to mitigate inminent or possible failure. An organisation or individual without an {{exit strategy}} may be in a quagmire. At worst, an <b>exit</b> strategy will <b>save</b> face; at best, an exit strategy will deliver an objective worth more than the cost of continuing the execution of a previous plan considered [...] "deemed to fail" [...] by weight of the present situation.|$|R
40|$|On modern processors, hardware-assisted {{virtualization}} outperforms binary translation {{for most}} workloads. But hardware virtualization has a potential problem: virtualization exits are expensive. While hardware virtualization executes guest instructions at native speed, guest/VMM transitions can sap performance. Hardware designers attacked this problem both by reducing guest/VMM transition costs and by adding architectural extensions such as nested paging support to avoid exits. This paper proposes complementary software techniques {{for reducing the}} exit frequency. In the simplest form, our VMM inspects guest code dynamically to detect back-to-back pairs of instructions that both exit. By handling a pair of instructions when the first one <b>exits,</b> we <b>save</b> 50 % of the transition costs. Then, we generalize from pairs to clusters of instructions that may include loops and other control flow. We use a binary translator to generate, and cache, custom translations for handling exits. The analysis cost is paid once, when the translation is generated, but amortized over all future executions. Our techniques have been fully implemented and validated in recent versions of VMware products. We show that clusters consistently {{reduce the number of}} exits for all examined workloads. When execution is dominated by exit costs, this translates into measurable runtime improvements. Most importantly, clusters enable substantial gains for nested virtual machines, delivering speedups as high as 1. 52 x. Intuitively, this result {{stems from the fact that}} transitions between the inner guest and VMM are extremely costly, as they are implemented in software by the outer VMM. ...|$|R
