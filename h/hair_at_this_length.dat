After tasting both efforts, Rocco indicates that he had a hard time choosing a winner. [...] "Im down to splitting <b>hairs</b> <b>at</b> <b>this</b> point," [...] he says. The Black Team wins the challenge, by providing a three-course meal for under 800 calories.

50|$|At least initially, {{the cult}} did not worship an {{abstraction}} or {{a spirit of}} a snake but an actual, physical serpent that was said to embody the god. According to the cult's mythology, the snake appeared after Alexander had foretold the coming of a new incarnation of Asclepius. When the people gathered in the marketplace of Abonutichus at noon, when the incarnation was supposed to occur, Alexander produced a goose egg and sliced it open, revealing the god within. Within a week it grew {{to the size of}} a man with the features of a man on its face, including long blond <b>hair.</b> <b>At</b> <b>this</b> point the figure resembling this description was apparently a puppet that appeared in the temple.

Measurements using secondary electron micrographs have a bias of a few nanometers and are therefore difficult to interpret in the sub- 10 -nm regime.

However, isometric force of the muscles with the mutation in TPM 3 was lower at lengths below optimum, with more impairment at decreasing length. As the muscles are active over a large range of different muscle lengths during daily activities, this finding may explain, at least in part, the muscle weakness experienced by patients with nemaline myopathy. © 2002 Elsevier Science B.
