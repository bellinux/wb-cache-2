40|$|The {{greatest}} {{opportunities to}} reduce the dwell car-hours of freight railway cars are in rationalization of organization of car-traffics. Therefore, the development of high-quality <b>train</b> <b>formation</b> plan {{is the most effective}} measure for saving of car-hours of accumulation. The presented calculation method for railway <b>train</b> <b>formation</b> plan is developed on the basis of stochastic optimization and uses accumulation parameter as probabilistic parameter.
