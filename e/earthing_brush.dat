5000|$|The two {{contra-rotating}} insulating discs (usually made of glass) have {{a number}} of metal sectors stuck onto them. The machine is provided with four small <b>earthed</b> <b>brushes</b> (two {{on each side of the}} machine on conducting shafts at 90° to each other), plus a pair of charge-collection combs. The conducting shafts, that hold the brushes on a typical Wimshurst machine, would form the shape of an [...] "X", if one could see through the insulating disks, as they are perpendicular to each other. The charge-collection combs are typically mounted along the horizontal and equally contact the outer edges of both front and back discs. The collection combs on each side are usually connected to respective Leyden jars.|$|R

50|$|In general, {{along the}} bayshore and valleys, the Ohlone {{constructed}} dome-shaped houses of woven or bundled mats of tules, 6 to 20 feet (1.8 to 6 m) in diameter. In hills where redwood trees were accessible, they built conical houses from redwood bark {{attached to a}} frame of wood. Residents of Monterey recall Redwood houses. One of the main village buildings, the sweat lodge was low into the ground, its walls made of earth and roof of <b>earth</b> and <b>brush.</b> They built boats of tule to navigate on the bays propelled by double-bladed paddles.|$|R
5000|$|Tortoises {{sometimes}} rest in mud wallows or rain-formed pools, {{which may}} be both a thermoregulatory response during cool nights, and a protection from parasites such as mosquitoes and ticks. Parasites are countered by taking dust baths in loose soil. Some tortoises have been noted to shelter at night under overhanging rocks. [...] - others have been observed sleeping in a snug depression in the <b>earth</b> or <b>brush</b> called a [...] "pallet". Local tortoises using the same pallet sites, such as on Volcán Alcedo, results {{in the formation of}} small, sandy pits.|$|R
50|$|Rock Creek Mill, or Lambrecht's {{combined}} saw and grist mill, {{driven by}} water power, {{was built in}} August 1865 by August Lambrecht. The mill stood about two miles northwest of the present-day Elkhorn River bridge, {{on the south side}} of the river and approximately 1000 feet southwest of the present-day 'Rock Creek Bridge' (41°54'53.91"N x 96°51'11.62"W). Lambrecht built an <b>earth</b> and <b>brush</b> dam to channel the water for the mill. Customers brought grain to the mill from as far away as the Platte River, some 200 miles, to be ground into flour. In 1891, Mr. Henry Lambrecht moved the flour and grinding mill to Beemer.|$|R
5000|$|The Zanja Madre {{was placed}} close to present-day Broadway {{at the foot}} of the Elysian Hills by the river. An <b>earth</b> and <b>brush</b> dam, called a toma, was created to pool up the water into the ditch which then ran along an {{elevated}} slope down to the pueblo after which it was split into multiple ditches which ran to the various portions of lowland. [...] A large water wheel, constructed in the 1850s, took water up to the Zanja Madre and onto the main brick reservoir that was located in what is now the Plaza at the end of Olvera Street. The wheel was susceptible to damage from floods. The toma was washed away several times before a wooden one was built in its place.|$|R
40|$|Abstract: Railway axles have {{typically}} {{been designed for}} an infinite life, with a normal maximum service life of 40 years. However, some axles have failed in service. This paper describes five axles that have failed in service {{and the consequences of}} the failures, and suggests causes of the failures. Most had resulted from the slow growth of fatigue cracks across the axles. Electrical arcing, corrosion and stress corrosion cracking had initiated the fatigue cracks. An axle containing small cracks has been returned to service and the crack sizes regularly monitored. It is concluded that more information on axles is required and it is recommended that information on the loads, stresses and materials data should be obtained so that guidance for the design of axles can be updated. It is also recommended that <b>earth</b> return <b>brush</b> seats should be regularly tested for cracks and all axles regularly visually inspected for corrosion...|$|R
50|$|There are {{virtually}} no contemporary {{records of the}} Esselen people's lives. Researchers believe that {{they lived in a}} manner very much like the Ohlone people to the north and the Costonoan people near present-day Monterey. Miguel Constanso, who traveled with Portola's expeditions 175 years later, wrote about the homes of the Indians who lived on the Santa Barbara Channel. He described how they lived in dome-shaped dwellings covered with bundled mats of tules. The homes were up to 55 ft across and three or four families lived in a single dwelling. They built a fire pit in the middle and left a vent or chimney {{in the center of the}} roof. In mountainous regions where redwood trees grew, they may have built conical houses from redwood bark attached to a frame of wood. One of the main village buildings, the sweat lodge was low into the ground, its walls made of earth and roof of <b>earth</b> and <b>brush.</b> They built boats of tule to navigate on the bays propelled by double-bladed paddles.|$|R
50|$|In August 1961 Ginther and Baghetti were {{teammates}} at the Pescara Grand Prix, a world auto manufacturers championship event. Their Ferrari {{was leading}} on the 10th lap when it stopped on a straight stretch {{with a flat}} tire. Ginther averaged more than 133 mi/h km/h on the 6.2 mi Autodromo Nazionale Monza in September 1961, to lead {{the first day of}} qualifying for the 1961 Italian Grand Prix. Von Trips qualified first with Ginther taking the third starting position after Ricardo Rodriguez. Ginther retired in the race. Von Trips died in a spectacular crash on the 2nd lap, which also killed eleven spectators, when his Ferrari climbed a 5 ft <b>earth</b> embankment. It <b>brushed</b> a wire fence employed to restrain a portion of the crowd and struck the spectators. Some who were injured eventually succumbed to number a total of fifteen deaths. The Ferrari team ceased competition until January 1, 1962, as a mark of respect to Von Trips.|$|R
60|$|Austin was {{slightly}} amused, {{though he would}} not for his life have shown it. It {{occurred to him that}} an excess of the qualities his companion admired in Miss Gascoyne might prove monotonous, especially if they were, as in her case, a little too obtrusive. He also fancied that {{this was the first time}} anybody had called her clever. Still, Jefferson's supreme belief in the woman he loved appealed to him in spite of its somewhat too vehement expression, and he reflected that there was probably some truth in Jacinta's observation that the woman whose lover credited her with all the graces might, at least, acquire some of them. It seemed that a simple and somewhat narrow-minded English girl, without imagination, such as Miss Gascoyne was in reality, might still hear what Jacinta called the celestial music, and, listening, become transformed. After all, it was not mere passion which vibrated in Jefferson's voice and had shone in Muriel Gascoyne's eyes, and Austin vaguely realised that the faith that can believe in the apparently impossible and the charity that sees no shortcomings are not altogether of this <b>earth.</b> Then he <b>brushed</b> these thoughts aside and turned to his companion with a little smile.|$|R
60|$|Noel {{heard the}} man's laugh. It {{seemed to her}} the most odious laugh she had ever heard. She thought swiftly and absurdly: 'I'll get away from all this.' The window {{was only a few}} feet up. She got out on to the ledge, let herself down, and dropped. There was a flower-bed below, quite soft, with a scent of geranium-leaves and <b>earth.</b> She <b>brushed</b> herself, and went tiptoeing across the gravel and the little front lawn, to the gate. The house was quite dark, quite silent. She walked on, down the road. 'Jolly!' she thought. 'Night after night we sleep, and never see the nights: sleep until we're called, and never see anything. If they want to catch me they'll have to run.' And she began running down the road in her evening frock and shoes, with nothing on her head. She stopped after going perhaps three hundred yards, by the edge of the wood. It was splendidly dark in there, and she groped her way from trunk to trunk, with a delicious, half-scared sense of {{adventure}} and novelty. She stopped at last by a thin trunk whose bark glimmered faintly. She felt it with her cheek, quite smooth--a birch tree; and, with her arms round it, she stood perfectly still. Wonderfully, magically silent, fresh and sweet-scented and dark! The little tree trembled suddenly within her arms, and she heard the low distant rumble, to which she had grown so accustomed--the guns, always at work, killing--killing men and killing trees, little trees perhaps like this within her arms, little trembling trees! Out there, in this dark night, there would not be a single unscarred tree like this smooth quivering thing, no fields of corn, not even a bush or a blade of grass, no leaves to rustle and smell sweet, not a bird, no little soft-footed night beasts, except the rats; and she shuddered, thinking of the Belgian soldier-painter. Holding the tree tight, she squeezed its smooth body against her. A rush of the same helpless, hopeless revolt and sorrow overtook her, which had wrung from her that passionate little outburst to her father, the night before he went away. Killed, torn, and bruised; burned, and killed, like Cyril! All the young things, like this little tree.|$|R
6000|$|One of {{the hunters}} {{detailed}} from Wayne's command {{to supply the}} officers with game while the army lay at Greenville in 1793 was the Indian fighter, Josiah Hunt, who died a peaceful Methodist many years afterwards. When he passed a winter in the woods he had to build a fire to keep from freezing, and yet guard against letting the slightest gleam of light be seen by a prowling foe. So he dug a hole six or seven inches deep with his tomahawk, filled it with the soft lining of dead oak bark, and with his flint started a fire. He left two holes at the edges to breathe the flame; then covered the pit with <b>earth,</b> spread <b>brush</b> over it, and seated himself on the heap, with his blanket drawn over his head, and dozed through the night. The Indians had a great honor and admiration for him, and {{when they came to}} make peace at Greenville, after Fallen Timbers, they all wanted to see Captain Hunt. [...] "Great man, Captain Hunt," [...] they said. [...] "Great warrior--good hunting man-Indian no can kill," [...] and they told him they had tried to find out the secret of his fire, and catch him off his guard so that they could get his scalp, which they felt would have been the highest distinction they could have achieved, next to getting General Wayne's scalp. He was indeed both hunted and hunter. He never fired at a deer without first putting a bullet in his mouth to reload for an Indian, who might be about to fire on him. When he skinned a deer, he planted his back against a tree, and stood his rifle by his side; from time to time he stopped and listened for the slightest noise that hinted danger. His life had its disappointments as well as its perils. Once he saw three Indians whom he might easily have killed at one shot if he could have got them in range, but they persisted in walking Indian file. If he fired and killed only one, the other two would have killed him; so he was obliged to let them all go. Captain Hunt was a quiet, modest man, very frank and sincere, and seems never to have boasted of his exploits; we have no means of knowing whether he was glad or sorry that those Indians got away in safety. Probably he was not very glad; for though the fighters on both sides could admire, they could never spare one another.|$|R
40|$|The two {{programmes}} identified about 1000 farmer innovators {{and concluded}} that innovation is a fairly common phenomenon in regions where there is high population pressure on available natural resources. This is not surprising as farmers have to adapt to changes in rainfall, soils, demographics and markets, for example, in order to survive. Farmers with their ´backs against the wall´ have no choice: innovate to improve their livelihoods, {{continue to live in}} poverty or leave the land and settle elsewhere. Farmer innovators Innovators were identified by extension agents or by field staff of NGOs as well as by researchers. They not only observed farmers who were doing things differently, but also asked villagers whether they knew of farmers who were achieving better results than others who were producing under similar conditions. In Tunisia, the partners created a special weekly programme on ´agriculture and innovation´ for a regional radio station. Farmers responded positively to this programme and some submitted reports on their innovations to the radio station. Farmers improved technologies in areas such as soil and water conservation, water harvesting, soil fertility management and agroforestry and tested new crops and new crop varieties in their farming systems. Not all of the innovations were technical in nature; some farmers also defined new rules for the management of a community resource, such as water for irrigation. The improved traditional planting pits used in the Sahel to rehabilitate seriously degraded land are a well-known example of farmer innovation in the early 1980 s. Farmers drew upon many sources of inspiration for their innovations. Many picked up ideas while working elsewhere, and upon return, tried the new techniques on their own fields. In other cases they experimented with ideas gleaned from extension agents, study visits to research stations or from projects in other regions. However, some were {{as a result of their}} own creativity. Most innovators were fairly old and experienced but some were young. In Cameroon, a small network of 15 innovators had four members aged 23 - 32 years. These were young men who, after losing their jobs in urban centres during the economic crisis in Cameroon in the 1990 s, returned to their home villages and took up farming. Most innovators were illiterate, but the ability to be innovative was not related to the level of formal education. Most were men, but an increase in the number of female innovators was noted when women were involved in the identification process. Most of the innovators had strong personalities and were capable of withstanding considerable social pressure. Tensue Gebremedhin, a widow in Tigray, Ethiopia, started to plough with an ox and a donkey and by doing so broke two taboos: a woman behind a plough with a donkey in front of it. In East Africa, 33 % of innovators identified were women and their innovations in land husbandry did not differ from those of men. In Tanzania, for example, Mrs Grace Bura built up barriers with <b>earth</b> and <b>brush</b> to block gullies, and Mrs Martha Mwaso reclaimed large sections of riverbed through labour-intensive efforts. In Kenya, Mrs Kalekye excavated large quantities of earth to reclaim gullies for agricultural production. All innovators increased their production and income, and were considered to be better off because of their innovations. Data from Tanzania and from Burkina Faso show that many innovators who were resource-poor 10 - 20 years ago are now resource-rich. By investing in land rehabilitation, innovators in Burkina Faso systematically expanded their resource base and produced sufficient food to feed their families even in drought years. Not only did they build up their assets, but they also became less vulnerable to drought. Chains of innovation Some innovations triggered others. Innovators in Babanki, Cameroon, for example, contributed to a significant increase in the production of nightshade (Solanum nigrum) as a result of improved soil fertility management and the construction of a network of irrigation canals. A farmer then devised a simple, low-cost harvesting tool to cut leaves quickly and efficiently without damaging the plants. Improving the marketing channels was their next project. Farmer innovation and formal research Both regional programmes emphasized that farmer innovations are not necessarily perfect. They can be improved and it is essential to build partnerships between researchers and innovators for joint experimentation based on agendas set by the farmers. The case of innovators in Cameroon who expressed their problems and their priorities clearly, and were accepted by researchers, is a good example. In Tunisia the programme of experimentation was more researcher-driven, but responded adequately to farmers´ priorities. Working with farmer innovators requires a change in attitudes for many researchers. They need to communicate with farmers as equals and should be willing and able to listen to and learn from farmers. Innovation and extension Top-down approaches to extension have failed to produce tangible results. It is still too often assumed that there are sufficient, readily available technologies that can be transferred to farmers. More participatory approaches to extension have not yet been mainstreamed. It has been repeatedly demonstrated and reported that farmers are keen to learn from fellow farmers, and that they often more readily accept innovations observed on the fields of other farmers working under similar conditions than messages transmitted by extension agents. When farmers from Niger went on a study tour to Burkina Faso in 1989, they were impressed by the improved traditional planting pits used to rehabilitate degraded land. Some applied this technique on their return [...] The results were surprisingly good, even in 1990, which was a drought year. This success led to the accelerated dissemination of this technique and, by 1992, the emergence of a farmers´ land market with farmers actively buying and selling degraded land. Building on farmer innovation implies a fundamental change in the roles of extension agents from transmitters of technical messages to facilitators of knowledge exchange between farmers and other farmers and between farmers and extension officers themselves. Recent initiatives The number of initiatives to promote farmer experimentation and innovation seems to be increasing. In March 2004 CTA and IFAD organized a regional workshop in West Africa on farmer innovation and extension. IFAD subsequently launched an Innovation Mainstreaming Initiative and ICRAF and partners developed a proposal to promote farmer experimentation and innovation in the Sahel. The creativity of farmers in Africa and other ACP regions remains a major untapped resource that can be used to realize the promise and potential of ACP agricultural and rural development. The challenge is for policymakers, researchers and extensionists to embrace farmer innovation as a valuable tool for transforming ACP agriculture.
