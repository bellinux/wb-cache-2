25|$|In late 1897 {{contracts}} were let for the signalling equipment; the <b>electric</b> <b>interlocking</b> was to {{be carried}} out by W R Sykes, who had a call-off contract with the LSWR; a supplement to their standard prices for the tunnel work was agreed.|$|E
50|$|Prompted by the accident, {{engineer}} Edward Tyer {{developed the}} tablet {{system in which}} a token {{is given to the}} train driver; this must be slotted into an <b>electric</b> <b>interlocking</b> device {{at the other end of}} the single-track section before another train is allowed to pass.|$|E
50|$|In July 2015, the {{reconstruction}} of Ledyanaya railway station was completed and included a garage, service and domestic building and treatment facilities, 20 new turnouts and communications systems. In the shortest possible time an extension was built to the post of <b>electric</b> <b>interlocking</b> and high loading platform, {{in addition to the}} construction of the railway stations Promishlenaya-1 (Промышленная-1) and Promishlenaya-2. They are located directly on the territory of the cosmodrome.|$|E
50|$|A {{train describer}} is {{originally}} an additional apparatus at British railways that {{ensures that the}} identity of each train is displayed on the signalbox panel together with the indication of that train's presence, usually offering routing information. This routing information would then be passed through to the platform display for passenger information. Technically the train reporting number was pushed from one signal box to the next. A series of interconnected signal boxes form a train describer system (TDS) transferring train describer data to be shown on the respective signalbox panel in a train describer display. The <b>electric</b> relay <b>interlocking</b> boxes were later replaced by electronic control boards where the train indication is just a text element on the video display.|$|R
50|$|The {{station was}} opened in 1876. In 1918, {{electric}} light {{was installed in}} the station, including platform lights. The middle platform was built in 1949. In 1953, a new electric signal box with <b>electric</b> <b>interlocking</b> and railway signaling were built. The current signal box is from the SRJ station Djursholms Ösby north of Stockholm, and the goods store house is from the former SRJ station Österbybruk. As the station currently includes the main signal control for the ULJ railroad, Marielund Station is always staffed during regular traffic hours.|$|E
50|$|During the World War II, {{the road}} was badly damaged. During the battles and the liberation of the {{territory}} from invaders, railroad workers carried out the supply to frontlines, the transport service, the restoration path and rolling stock. Thousands of railway workers participated in combat operations, worked in the underground. In the postwar years in the Cisdnieper railway Trade Union was not only restored, but also constructed, reconstructed, new stations, railway stations, artificial structures, including major bridges across the Dnieper. The main meridional direction Lozova — Zaporozhia transferred to electric traction; electrified main latitudinal direction and suburban areas. Electric traction is 77% of the total turnover, the rest is diesel. Up to 85% of the road sections equipped with automatic lock, up to 95% — <b>electric</b> <b>interlocking</b> of switches and signals. Built large marshalling yards, equipped with modern technical means of mechanization and automation. On loading and unloading operations are applied mechanization. High-performance track machines are used for current maintenance and repairs.|$|E
50|$|Entrance-Exit Interlocking (NX) was the {{original}} brand name {{of the first generation}} relay-based centralized traffic control (CTC) interlocking system introduced in 1936 by GRS (represented in Europe by Metropolitan-Vickers). The advent of all <b>electric</b> <b>interlocking</b> technology allowed for more automated route setting procedures as opposed to having an operator line each part of the route manually. The NX system allowed an operator looking at the diagram of a complicated junction to simply push a button on the known entrance track and another button on the desired exit track, and the logic circuitry handled all the necessary actions of commanding the underlying relay interlocking to set signals and throw switches in the proper sequence as required to provide valid route through the interlocking plant. The first NX installation was in 1937 at Brunswick on the Cheshire Lines, UK. The first US installation was on the New York Central Railroad (NYCRR) at Girard Junction, Ohio in 1937. Another NYCRR installation was on the main line between Utica, New York and Rochester, New York, and this was quickly followed up by three installations on the New York City Subway's IND Fulton Street Line in 1948.|$|E
50|$|In {{the post-war}} years, {{the amount of}} traffic carried {{continued}} its increase along with the reconstruction of transportation facilities and introduction of new technology. In 1948, the East Siberian Railway reached its pre-war loading and cargo-turnover level. In 1958, they commissioned the new Taishet-Bratsk-Lena railway, which connected the basins of the Angara and Lena Rivers {{with the rest of}} the Siberian railroad network, providing immediate access to mineral deposits in the Angara basin (e.g. the Korshunovskoye iron ore deposit) and abundant logging regions and ensuring an uninterrupted supply of cargo to the northern areas of Irkutsk Oblast and Yakutia. At the end of 1965, a 647 km long Abakan-Taishet section of the East Siberian Railway was commissioned, an electrified high-class railroad with modern means of communication, <b>electric</b> <b>interlocking</b> of railroad switches, and a remote dispatching system. This section of the railway provided a new access to the Kuzbass, Kazakhstan, and Central Asia from the regions of the Russian Far East and Siberia. The early 1970s saw the completion of construction of the northbound line from the Khrebtovaya railway station to Ust-Ilimsk Hydroelectric Powerplant (214 km).|$|E
50|$|The {{station was}} opened on 15 January 1873 by the East Gloucestershire Railway. It was a simple, single-platform station, built of honey-coloured local Cotswold stone which {{reflected}} {{the architecture of}} the nearby villages. It had a goods shed served by a single siding. By the late 1920s, a signalbox and a loading dock had been added. The signalbox was a standard Great Western model with 17 levers and the only one on the line to have track-circuiting installed. The goods yard contained a loop to allow trains to run-around but this was not signalled for use by passing trains. In 1933, a ground frame locked by an <b>electric</b> <b>interlocking</b> lever from the signal box was installed at the eastern entrance to the loop and a new inner home signal was erected. It was not until the Second World War, when the line was busy with traffic for RAF Fairford, that the Great Western Railway signalled and lengthened the loop to allow two goods trains or one passenger train and one goods service to cross. A second goods siding was also added by October 1944, by which time the ground frame had been removed.|$|E
