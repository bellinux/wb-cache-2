25|$|Passing {{laws that}} remove the few checks against mistreatment of prisoners {{will not help}} us win {{the battle for the}} hearts and minds of the {{generation}} of young people around the world being recruited by Osama bin Laden and al Qaeda. Authorizing indefinite detention of anybody the Government designates, without any proceeding and without any recourse—is what our worst critics claim the United States would do, not what American values, traditions and our rule of law would have us do. This is not <b>just</b> <b>a</b> <b>bad</b> bill, this is a dangerous bill.|$|E
500|$|Today, pygmy hippos breed well in captivity: since Billy's arrival, 58 pygmy hippos {{have been}} born at the National Zoo alone. As one of the {{earliest}} pygmy hippos in captivity in the U.S. zoo system, Billy {{went on to become the}} direct ancestor of nearly all pygmy hippos in American zoos. When Billy first came to the zoo, however, keepers did not know much about pygmy hippopotamus husbandry. [...] A mate for Billy, a female named Hannah, was acquired by the zoo on September 4, 1929. [...] Billy's and Hannah's first calf was born on August 26, 1931, but did not survive the week. [...] "Inability to survive the neglect of an errant mother was the cause given for baby Hippo's demise", eulogized The Washington Post. [...] Over the next two years, two more calves would follow, both of which died in infancy. [...] Billy's third calf was killed when Hannah rolled on top of the baby and crushed it. [...] "She's <b>just</b> <b>a</b> <b>bad</b> mother", said the zoo's long-time director Dr. William M. Mann to The Washington Post, upon the death of the third infant.|$|E

500|$|Craig has {{described}} {{his portrayal of}} Bond as an anti-hero: [...] "The question I keep asking myself while playing the role is, 'Am I the good guy or <b>just</b> <b>a</b> <b>bad</b> guy {{who works for the}} good side?' Bond's role, after all, is that of an assassin when you come down to it. I have never played a role in which someone's dark side shouldn't be explored. I don't think it should be confusing {{by the end of the}} film, but during the film you should be questioning who he is." [...] Craig has stated that his own favourite previous Bond actor is Sean Connery, but says, [...] "I'd never copy somebody else. I would never do an impression of anybody else or try and improve on what they did. That would be a pointless exercise for me." [...] His own favourite Bond film is From Russia with Love. On an episode of The South Bank Show, Connery divulged his thoughts on Craig's casting as Bond, whom he described as [...] "fantastic, marvellous in the part". When told that Craig had taken particular note of his performances, Connery said that he was [...] "flattered" [...] and that Craig really gets the [...] "danger element" [...] to Bond's character. Craig has remarked that Bond is [...] "...actually a misogynist... A lot of women are drawn to him chiefly because he embodies a certain kind of danger and never sticks around for too long." ...|$|E
500|$|James Caldwell, {{also of the}} Pro Wrestling Torch Newsletter, {{posted a}} review of the show in which he felt the main event was a [...] "slow, plodding match" [...] with an [...] "anticlimactic finish." [...] Caldwell stated that the Styles versus Angle contest was a [...] "fine {{spotlight}} singles match," [...] but was a [...] "bit underwhelming when the expectations were reasonably high for two of TNA's best wrestlers in a featured singles match." [...] He {{went on to say that}} he felt it was [...] "missing something" [...] and that it [...] "seemed like the match just never moved out of second gear. Caldwell felt the X Division Championship bout was a [...] "very good opening match," [...] which [...] "could have been a featured match to sell a few additional PPV buys, but TNA didn't give the X Division any focus until the final show before the PPV." [...] Caldwell stated the World Tag Team Championship was [...] "just a slow, plodding tag match." [...] Regarding the marriage segment during the show, Caldwell said [...] "it was <b>just</b> <b>a</b> <b>bad,</b> bad, bad segment that died slowly and painfully in front of the live audience." [...] Overall, Caldwell felt that [...] "TNA showcased the X Division in the opening match," [...] but needed more [...] "athleticism on the show to balance the slow, plodding former WWE heavyweight wrestlers in the main event slots." ...|$|E

2500|$|Taylor checked {{himself out}} of McLean before, at Kortchmar's urging, moving to New York City to form a band. They {{recruited}} Joel O'Brien, formerly of Kortchmar's old band King Bees, to play drums, and Taylor's childhood friend Zachary Wiesner (son of noted academic Jerome Wiesner) to play bass, and after Taylor rejected the notion of naming the group after him, they called themselves the Flying Machine. They played songs that Taylor had written at and about McLean, such as [...] "Knocking 'Round the Zoo", [...] "Don't Talk Now", and [...] "The Blues Is <b>Just</b> <b>a</b> <b>Bad</b> Dream". In some other songs, Taylor romanticized his life, but he was plagued by self-doubt. By summer 1966, they were performing regularly at the high-visibility Night Owl Cafe in Greenwich Village, alongside acts such as the Turtles and Lothar and the Hand People.|$|E
2500|$|On defense, the Wolverines {{became the}} first team to hold the Buckeyes {{scoreless}} since 1964. [...] They held Ohio State to 173 yards of total offense, including 101 rushing yards and only five pass receptions. [...] Defensive tackle Greg Morton led the team with 14 tackles, and Jim Pickens and Jerry Zuver each had an interception. [...] Late in the second quarter, with the game still scoreless, Ohio State drove the ball to the Michigan 10-yard line when Pickens intercepted a pass in the end zone. [...] After the game, Woody Hayes cited Pickens' interception as a turning point: [...] "The interception {{at the end of the}} first half was a costly error on our part. [...] It was my call all the way, and it was <b>just</b> <b>a</b> <b>bad</b> call. [...] If we had scored then, it might have affected the second half outcome." ...|$|E
