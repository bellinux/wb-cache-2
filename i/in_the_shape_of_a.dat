5|$|A new {{task of the}} Güell-López's for Comillas was {{the gazebo}} for Alfonso XII's visit to the Cantabrian town in 1881.

It was subsequently moved into the Güell Pavilions.|$|E
5|$|After {{advancing}} to the Imperial Age, players can also construct a Wonder, an extremely expensive non-military building. On many gameplay modes, building a Wonder triggers a victory countdown—unless it's destroyed within a certain timeframe, the building player wins. Every civilization's Wonder is <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>shape</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> landmark unique to that historical culture—the Temple of Heaven for the Chinese, for example, or Notre Dame for the Franks.|$|E
5|$|All four {{structures}} {{were built in}} a simplified Greek Cross floor plan to signify a religious purpose. Closest to Lake Danebod stands the Folk High School, a three-story wooden building with eight gables. Next to the Folk High School stands the multipurpose Stone Hall, and across the street stands the Gym Hall with its iconic twin towers. Danebod Lutheran Church {{is located on the}} town's main street, appropriately named Tyler Street, and is <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>shape</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> Greek cross on the outside.|$|E

5|$|In 1482, Leonardo, who {{according}} to Vasari was a talented musician, created a silver lyre <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>shape</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> horse's head. Lorenzo de' Medici sent Leonardo to Milan, bearing the lyre as a gift, to secure peace with Ludovico Sforza, Duke of Milan. At this time Leonardo wrote an often-quoted letter describing the many marvellous and diverse {{things that he}} could achieve {{in the field of}} engineering and informing Ludovico that he could also paint.|$|E

5|$|The National Space Society (NSS) {{gives the}} Gerard K.

5|$|The Phra Thinang Dusit Maha Prasat (พระที่นั่งดุสิตมหาปราสาท) {{dominates the}} Maha Prasat group. The throne hall {{was built on}} a {{symmetrical}} cruciform plan, the roof is topped with a tall gilded spire. The hall is considered an ideal archetype of Thai traditional architecture. Every aspect of the exterior decoration of the throne hall is imbuded with symbolism. The hall is built <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>shape</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> tall mountain to represent Mount Meru, the mythological centre of the universe.|$|E

5|$|The {{constant}} {{width of}} these shapes allows their use as coins {{that can be}} used in coin-operated machines. For instance, the United Kingdom has made 20-pence and 50-pence coins <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>shape</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> Reuleaux heptagon. The Canadian Loonie dollar coin uses another Reuleaux polygon with 11 sides.|$|E
5|$|Toroids : The fossil Vendoglossa tuberculata {{from the}} Nama Group, Namibia, has been {{interpreted}} as a dorso-ventrally compressed stem-group metazoan, with a large gut cavity and a transversely ridged ectoderm. The organism is <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>shape</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> flattened torus, with the long axis of its toroidal body running through the approximate center of the presumed gut cavity.|$|E
5|$|While {{designing}} the Creighton-Ward Mansion sets, Bell {{and his staff}} strove for authenticity, ordering miniature Tudor paintings, -scale Georgian- and Regency-style furniture and carpeting <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>shape</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> polar bear skin. This realism was enhanced by adding scrap items acquired from household waste and electronics shops. For example, a vacuum cleaner pipe serves as Virgil Tracy's launch chute.|$|E

5|$|A {{squall line}} (also {{known as a}} quasi-linear {{convective}} system or QLCS) is a line of thunderstorms forming along or ahead of a cold front. In the early 20th century, the term {{was used as a}} synonym for cold front. It contains heavy precipitation, hail, frequent lightning, strong straight-line winds, and possibly tornadoes and waterspouts. Strong straight-line winds can occur where the squall line is <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>shape</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> bow echo. Tornadoes can occur along waves within a line echo wave pattern (LEWP), where mesoscale low-pressure areas are present. Some bow echoes which develop within the summer season are known as derechos, and they move quite fast through large sections of territory. On the back edge of the rain shield associated with mature squall lines, a wake low can be present, sometimes associated with a heat burst.|$|E
5|$|Also in 1904 {{he built}} the Chalet de Catllaràs, in La Pobla de Lillet, for the Asland cement factory, owned by Eusebi Güell. It has a simple {{structure}} though very original, <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>shape</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> pointed arch, with two semi-circular {{flights of stairs}} leading to the top two floors. This building fell into ruin when the cement works closed, {{and when it was}} eventually restored its appearance was radically altered, the ingenious original staircase being replaced with a simpler metal one. In the same area he created the Can Artigas Gardens between 1905 and 1907, in an area called Font de la Magnesia, commissioned by the textile merchant Joan Artigas i Alart; men who had worked the Park Güell were also involved on this project, similar to the famous park in Barcelona.|$|E
5|$|Ceramics lend {{themselves}} to circular motifs, whether radial or tangential. Bowls or plates can be decorated inside or out with radial stripes; these may be partly figurative, representing stylised leaves or flower petals, while circular bands can run around a bowl or jug. Patterns of these types were employed on Islamic ceramics from the Ayyubid period, 13thcentury. Radially symmetric flowers with, say, 6 petals {{lend themselves}} to increasingly stylised geometric designs which can combine geometric simplicity with recognisably naturalistic motifs, brightly coloured glazes, and a radial composition that ideally suits circular crockery. Potters often chose patterns suited {{to the shape of}} the vessel they were making. Thus an unglazed earthenware water flask from Aleppo <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>shape</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> vertical circle (with handles and neck above) is decorated with a ring of moulded braiding around an Arabic inscription with a small 8-petalled flower at the centre.|$|E
