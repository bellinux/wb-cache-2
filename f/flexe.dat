40|$|We {{consider}} {{the problem of}} creating plane orthogonal drawings of 4 -planar graphs (planar graphs with maximum degree 4) with constraints {{on the number of}} bends per edge. More precisely, we have a flexibility function assigning to each edge e a natural number <b>flex(e),</b> its flexibility. The problem FlexDraw asks whether there exists an orthogonal drawing such that each edge e has at most <b>flex(e)</b> bends. It is known that FlexDraw is NP-hard if <b>flex(e)</b> = 0 for every edge e. On the other hand, FlexDraw can be solved efficiently if <b>flex(e)</b> > 1 and is trivial if <b>flex(e)</b> > 2 for every edge e. To close the gap between the NP-hardness for <b>flex(e)</b> = 0 and the efficient algorithm for <b>flex(e)</b> > 1, we investigate the computational complexity of FlexDraw in case only few edges are inflexible (i. e., have flexibility 0). We show that for any ε > 0 FlexDraw is NP-complete for instances with O(n^ε) inflexible edges with pairwise distance Ω(n^ 1 -ε) (including the case where they induce a matching).

Additionally, <b>FlexE</b> incorporates the concept of thermal energy, which provides a rational way to determine when two models are “the same”. <b>FlexE</b> provides a unique measure of the similarity between protein structures that is complementary to existing methods...|$|E

Our methodical contribution comprises a procedure for generating new potentials of mean {{force for the}} ROTA scoring function which we have introduced previously for optimizing side-chain conformations with the tool IRECS. The ROTA potentials are specially trained to tolerate small-scale positional errors of atoms that are characteristic of (i) side-chain conformations that are modeled using a sparse rotamer library and (ii) ligand conformations that are generated using a docking program. We generated both rigid and flexible protein models with our side-chain prediction tool IRECS and docked ligands to proteins using the scoring function ROTA and the docking programs FlexX (for rigid side chains) and <b>FlexE</b> (for flexible side chains). We validated our approach on the forty screening targets of the DUD database.

40|$|The {{procedure}} to determine evaporation in hydrological models {{is considered to}} be unsatisfactory by some researchers; ‘too’ accurate by others. In this procedure catchment scale evaporation is related to some form of potential evaporation, determined with point scale meteorological data. The main criticism is that the potential evaporation is not representative for the catchment and that spatio-temporal dynamics in vegetation cannot appropriately be expressed with the time-invariant, spatially lumped model parameters in the above mentioned procedure. Using remotely sensed observations, catchment scale estimates on evaporation and vegetation dynamics can be derived. It is hypothesized that by integrating remotely sensed evaporation estimates and additional information on vegetation dynamics in conceptual rainfall-runoff models, we can get more insight into the realism of the modelled evaporation flux and the role of vegetation dynamics. With a more realistic representation of evaporation, the water partitioning can be modelled more accurately, eventually improving our understanding of the catchment behaviour. The way the evaporation estimates can be used depends on the spatial and temporal resolution and the reliability of the products. The hypothesis is tested in the well studied Ourthe catchment, located in Belgium. The climate is Atlantic temperate, the streamflow is characterized by a quick response. Vegetation dynamics in both space and time are investigated in a principal component analysis on multi year MODIS Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) data. Areas with similar temporal dynamics are distinguished. The most important temporal dynamics are related to phenology and agricultural growing reasons. Areas with an increasing trend in NDVI are identified as well, but the spatial extent is too small to be relevant for hydrological applications. In a validation study three remotely sensed evaporation products are examined in terms of their reliability and applicability in conceptual models, namely EARS (daily, 4 km x 9 km), WACMOS (daily, clear days, 1 km x 1 km) and MOD 16 (8 -daily, 1 km x 1 km). EARS and WACMOS are surface energy balance models, based on land surface temperature observations. MOD 16 uses the Penman-Monteith equation, with distributed surface characteristics and a Jarvis-like approach to calculate the surface resistance. The remotely sensed products are validated with ground measurements of evaporation from five eddy covariance towers and - if applicable - with a multi year water balance analysis. Mainly based on the water balance analysis, we concluded that the EARS product gives relatively accurate evaporation estimates and can be used in the last step of the research. WACMOS (SEBS) was shown to have an extremely poor correlation between the remotely sensed evaporative fraction and the evaporative fraction determined from eddy covariance measurements and was not further considered. MOD 16, often criticized for not taking into account soil moisture constraints on evaporation, did deviate from EC measurements in the growing season, but this was shown not to be related to limited soil moisture. The main drawback of MOD 16 in relatively moist climates such as the Ourthe catchment, seems to be the application of constant canopy conductance and the large scale of the meteorological input data. Catchment scale evaporation appeared to be slightly underestimated, which may be attributed to the fact that interception is neglected in this version of the product. In the last step of the research, i. e. confronting a water balance model with the ancillary data on vegetation dynamics and remotely sensed evaporation, the hypothesis is further specified. Lead by the spatio-temporal resolution of the EARS product, EARS evaporation (ERS,EARS) is used as forcing of a daily lumped conceptual model. Disadvantage of the coarse spatial resolution and the lumped modelling approach, is that the link between vegetation dynamics and evaporation cannot be made. This is left for further research. In a comparative modelling approach i) the realism of the conventional {{procedure to}} determine evaporation is examined, and ii) we investigate whether by imposing ERS,EARS on the model, a more realistic representation of the water partitioning can be simulated. Three models are compared: FLEXEp with the conventional procedure to determine evaporation, FLEXEp,RS also forced with potential evaporation, but determined from the catchment average net radiation, and <b>FLEXE,</b> forced with RS,EARS. The hypothesis is that especially the seasonal dynamics in streamflow generation can be better simulated by <b>FLEXE.</b> This was not the case. It was shown that the evaporation modelled with the conventional conceptualization of the evaporation flux (FLEXEp), is fundamentally different from the EARS remotely sensed evaporation estimates (ERS,EARS). Yet in terms of streamflow simulation, FLEXEp outperforms (<b>FLEXE),</b> especially in spring and autumn. Furthermore, parameter identifiability was shown not to be better for <b>FLEXE</b> than for FLEXEp. These results indicate that either the EARS product is not as accurate as we expected, or that the lumped conceptual model does not represent the dominant processes occurring in the catchment. Assuming the latter, this can be explained by i) a too complex model with too many degrees of freedom as the limited parameter identifiability indicates, ii) an erroneous representation of the dominant processes or a wrong hypothesis on the occurring dominant processes and iii) the level of aggregation of evaporation and other hydrological processes is too high and the model too simple to be representative for the heterogeneous catchment. To look further into the latter, we suggest the combined use of topography driven semi-distributed models and the patterns in vegetation as derived by the PCA analysis. Although we assumed the EARS product to reliably estimate the catchment scale evaporation, there are some unexplained issues. Forest evaporation seems te be overestimated by the EARS product, whereas in the water balance analysis the catchment scale evaporation appears to be in the right order of magnitude. If the overprediction indeed is the case, somewhere in the catchment or at some time evaporation is underestimated. Furthermore on clear days in winter, evaporation tends to be zero according to the parametrization of the EARS product, which is not observed by the eddy covariance measurements. It is recommended to further look into the parameterization of the EARS algorithm especially during the changing seasons. HydrologyWater ManagementCivil Engineering and Geoscience...|$|E

40|$|The {{conflicting}} {{requirements of}} muscle to produce contractions {{that are both}} rapid and powerful has led to specialisations of joint mechanics or motor patterns when movements necessitating both these characteristics must be generated. Such muscular requirements are widespread in the behaviour of animals, but are exemplified in the prodigious jumping and kicking movements of locusts and grasshoppers. Rapid extension of the tibiae of both hind legs provides the propulsive force by which these insects jump to avoid predators and to initiate flight or, as larvae, to increase their speed of locomotion by hopping. Rapid and powerful extensions of individual hind legs are also used to kick at predators or conspecifics. During jumping, the hind tibiae are extended in 20 – 30 ms (Brown, 1967) so that a locust can take off at a velocity of 3. 1 m s− 1. Each extensor tibiae muscle in the hind legs can generate peak force only slowly, in 350 – 500 ms, but the power output of 0. 5 mW kg− 1 is high (Bennet-Clark, 1975). Kicking to repel adversaries involves an even more rapid extension of the hind tibiae, often independently, but with a tarsus lifted {{from the ground and}} the leg rotated at the coxa {{so that it can be}} aimed effectively. We do not, however, know the velocities of movements involved or the relationships between muscle actions and joint movements in kicking. The high velocity and power output required for these ballistic movements can only be produced if the leg muscles contract slowly before the movement to store force in deformations of the cuticle (Bennet-Clark, 1975; Brown, 1967; Godden, 1975; Heitler and Burrows, 1977 a). Successful kicks and jumps therefore result from a complex interplay between the neurally generated motor pattern and the mechanics of the joint, muscles and apodemes. Neither the neural nor the mechanical specialisations are present in the other two pairs of legs. The motor pattern consists of three phases (Burrows, 1995; Heitler and Burrows, 1977 a) : (i) an initial cocking phase during which the tibia is fully <b>flexe...</b>|$|E

40|$|BACKGROUND : Several studies {{concerning}} Nordic walking (NW) {{have been}} reported on however previous investigations have usually focused only on physiological variables or on the kinematics of a moving subject with poles. Until now, only one study that observed the generation of upper limb force acting on a pole has been presented. In our pilot study NW was observed in a more comprehensive manner by means of physiological and biomechanical methods. OBJECTIVE : The objective of the pilot study was to compare biomechanical and physiological variables during walking without and with poles on the different slopes of the ground. METHODS : One healthy man participated in the study. During treadmill walking, basic temporal, angle, force, energy expenditure and exercise intensity variables were observed. The subject completed two 9 minute tests (NW, normal walking) consisting of three periods of three minutes walking on various slopes of the ground (0 %, 5 %, 10 %). RESULTS : NW on all slopes of the ground, in comparison with walking without poles, the result was lesser hip flexion, knee flexion and ankle dorsal flexion and greater hip extension. Maximal plantar flexion during NW was not influenced by {{the slope of the}} ground (in contrast to walking without poles). During NW, frequency decreased on all slopes of the ground. Support impulse and maximal force utilization of the poles showed various differences for right and left limbs. The values of oxygen consumption and heart rate for NW were, in comparison with walking without poles, higher in all experimental situations. CONCLUSIONS : The slope of the ground influences both walking without poles and NW. The reason is greater moving of the centre of mass in a vertical direction. During NW the examined person solved increased energy demands at gentle increases in the slope only by an enhancement of the work of lower limbs, whereas during the overcoming of a major inclination, to maintain the stated speed, it was necessary to enhance the involvement of the upper limbs.

Až do současnosti byla prezentována pouze jedna studie, která zkoumala velikost síly, kterou při severské chůzi působí subjekt na hole. V naší pilotní studii je severská chůze posuzována komplexněji prostřednictvím fyziologických a biomechanických metod. CÍLE : Cílem pilotní studie bylo porovnat biomechanické a fyziologické parametry při chůzi s a bez holí při různém sklonu podložky. METODIKA : Studie se zúčastnil jeden muž. Při chůzi na běhátku byly sledovány základní časové, úhlové a silové parametry, spotřeba energie a intenzita zatížení. Subjekt absolvoval devíti minutové měření (severská chůze, chůze), které se skládalo ze tří tříminutových intervalů s různým sklonem podložky (0 %, 5 %, 10 %). VÝSLEDKY : Severská chůze se vzhledem k chůzi bez holí vyznačovala při všech sklonech podložky menší flexí v kyčelním a kolenním kloubu, menší dorzální flexí v hlezenním kloubu a větší extenzí v kyčelním kloubu.

METHODS : A group of players was further divided according to age into 3 subgroups – U 16 (n = 16); U 17 (n = 14); U 18 (n = 15). Unilateral strength was measured by the isokinetic dynamometer ISOMED 2000 (D. & R. Ferstl GmbH, Hemau, Germany) at angular speeds of 60 ° • s- 1, 180 ° • s- 1 and 360 ° • s- 1. The parameter evaluated was the isokinetic peak torque (PT; Nm). RESULTS : The ANOVA results demonstrate that there was a significant decrease in the PT within the entire group of players with an increase in speed during both flexion and extension (dominant extremity: p < 0. 001 resp. p < 0. 019; non-dominant extremity: p < 0. 001; resp. p < 0. 001). The difference in PT among the age categories was not significant for both flexors and extensors at the speed of 60 ° ∙ s- 1 (p = 0. 005; resp. p = 0. 036) and the speed of 180 ° ∙ s- 1 (p = 0. 036; resp. p = 0. 033). However, significant differences in PT among individual categories were confirmed only in some cases and, by contrast, an insignificant decrease was marked with nondominant leg extensors. CONCLUSIONS : The results of this study indicated the state of the strength readiness of the highly trained soccer players in the junior category and the potential shortcomings in the concept of strength preparation within a leading club in the Czech Republic. These results contributed to the deepening of knowledge about changes in strength with age and confirmed the importance of applying diagnostics during systematic long-term sport preparation. [VÝCHODISKA : Během dětství a dospívání dochází k nárůstu svalové síly. Dynamika změn svalové síly a její příčiny nejsou dosud plně objasněny a mohou se lišit mezi jednotlivci specifickými skupinami. Znalosti aktuální úrovně izokinetické síly u sportovců různého věku a disciplín představuje důležité informace z hlediska sportovního výkonu, stejně jako zdravotní prevence. CÍLE : Cílem studie je určit u skupiny elitních adolescentních fotbalistů (n = 45, věk = 17 ± 1, 2 let, tělesná výška 178, 4 ± 5, 3 cm, hmotnost 68, 5 ± 7, 6 kg) izokinetickou sílu flexorů a extenzorů kolena a posoudit, zda je významně ovlivněna věkem a rychlostí pohybu. METODIKA : Skupina hráčů byla dále rozdělena podle věku do 3 podskupin - U 16 (n = 16), U 17 (n = 14), U 18 (n = 15). Unilaterální síla byla měřena izokinetickým dynamometrem ISOMED 2000 (D. & R. Ferstl GmbH, Hemau, Německo) v úhlové rychlosti 60 ° • s- 1, 180 ° • s- 1 a 360 ° • s- 1. Hodnoceným parametrem byl maximální moment síly (PT, Nm). VÝSLEDKY : Výsledky ANOVY ukázaly, že v rámci celé skupiny hráčů došlo u <b>flexe</b> i extenze k výraznému poklesu PT se zvýšením rychlosti (dominantní končetina: p < 0, 001 resp. p < 0, 019, nedominantní končetina: p < 0, 001; resp. p < 0, 001). Rozdíl v PT mezi věkovými kategoriemi nebyl významný jak pro flexory, tak extenzory při rychlosti 60 ° ∙ s- 1 (p = 0, 005; resp. p = 0, 036) i při rychlosti 180 ° ∙ s- 1 (p = 0, 036; resp. p = 0, 033). Nicméně, významné rozdíly v PT mezi jednotlivými kategoriemi byly potvrzeny jen v některých případech a naopak byl zaznamenán nevýznamný pokles u extenzorů nedominantní končetiny. ZÁVĚRY : Výsledky studie ukazují na stav sílové připravenosti elitních mladých fotbalistů a na možné nedostatky v koncepci tréninku síly u předního klubu České republiky. Výsledky přispěly k prohloubení znalostí o změnách v síle s věkem a potvrdily důležitost uplatňování diagnostiky v rámci systematické dlouhodobé sportovní přípravy. ...|$|E
40|$|Termín "chůze" označuje základní pohyb, jehož pomocí se jednotlivec pohybuje z jednoho místa na druhé. U osob s postižením dolních končetin je tato aktivita částečně či zcela redukována. Během biomechanického šetření chůze u osob s různým postižením se také zkoumala symetrie zatížení dolních končetin. Určité množství biomechanických studií se zaměřuje na kinematické a dynamické proměnné cyklu chůze u osob s transtibiální amputací (Bateni & Olney, 2002; Thomas et al., 2000; Perry, 2004). Zajímavým problémem je hodnocení symetrie chůze mezi osobami s transtibiální amputací a skupinami zdravých jedinců (Winter & Sienko, 1988; Dingwell, Davis, & Frazier, 1996). Miff et al. (2005) srovnává dočasnou symetrii u zdravé skupiny s hodnotami u skupiny osob s transtibiální amputací během počáteční a konečné fáze chůze. Nolan et al. (2003) se zajímal o změny v symetrii chůze ovlivněné rychlostí chůze u osob s transtibiální a transfemorální amputací ve srovnání se zdravou skupinou. Symetrii chůze u osob s transtibiální amputací, které na počátku rehabilitace nosily dvě různé protetické nohy, zkoumal Marinakis (2004). Úplná symetrie chůze není vždy žádoucí. Lidský systém s velkou strukturální asymetrií v neuromuskulární kosterní soustavě (jedna končetina byla amputována) nemůže optimálně fungovat, když je chůze symetrická (Winter & Sienko, 1988). V tomto případě je lepší nesymetrická chůze s omezením reziduálního systému a mechaniky protézy. U osob, které podstoupily amputaci, může asymetrická chůze být nástrojem, jenž chrání pahýl postižené nohy. Lze říci, že asymetrie chůze je relevantním měřítkem pro zkoumání charakteristiky chůze osob s amputací a stanovení jejich sklonu k budoucí společné bolesti a degeneraci (Nolan et al., 2003). Pro chůzi osob s amputací je velmi důležitý výběr vhodné protézy. Vliv protetické nohy na proměnné chůze ve skupině těchto probandů zkoumal Gitter et al. (1991). Efektivnost chůze je také významně ovlivněna nastavením protézy nebo protetické nohy. Rehabilitaci osoby s amputací lze považovat za úspěšnou pouze tehdy, pokud tato osoba považuje protézu během chůze za estetickou a pohodlnou. Nastavení protézy musí vyhovovat potřebám postiženého (Fridman, Ona, & Isakov, 2003). Když protetická noha není optimálně vyladěna, může se tento fakt projevit v různých cyklech chůze. Během analýzy chůze je protéza úmyslně "neoptimálně" nastavena, aby se vyvolaly skryté následky. Fridman, Ona a Isakov (2003) pozorovali vliv protetické nohy umístěné ve vnější rotaci. Schmalz, Blumentritt a Jarasch (2002) použili sagitální posun nohy vpřed a vzad a nastavení nohy do plantární a dorzální <b>flexe.</b> Blumentritt et al. (1999) se zaměřil na účinky nastavení protézy v sagitální rovině na velikost zatížení kolenního kloubu u stojící osoby s transtibiální amputací. Nastavení protézy u osob s amputací dolní končetiny má pomoci zvýšit pohodlí zdravé nohy a maximalizovat možnosti chůze těchto osob. V rámci biomechanické analýzy chůze je důležité prošetřit nejen vztah mezi nastavením protetické nohy a protetické končetiny, ale také vztah mezi tímto nastavením a aktivitou druhé, zdravé končetiny (Pinzur et al., 1995). V jiných studiích se objevuje důraz na zdravou končetinu (Nolan & Lees, 2000; Hurley et al., 1990), ale v nich není řešena otázka různých nastavení protéz. Tento vztah mezi zdravou a protetickou končetinou může být kvantitativní, měřený dle symetrie nebo asymetrie měřených proměnných. The term "gait" {{refers to}} {{fundamental}} locomotion {{by means of}} which the individual moves him/herself {{from one place to}} another. For people afflicted by some involvement of the lower limbs, this activity is partially or completely reduced. In the course of the biomechanical investigation of gait in subjects with various afflictions, the symmetry of lower limb loading is also the object of research. A certain number of biomechanical studies are focussed on the kinematic and dynamic variables of the gait cycle in subjects with transtibial amputation (Bateni & Olney, 2002; Thomas et al., 2000; Perry, 2004). An interesting problem is the evaluation of gait symmetry between a transtibial amputee and groups of healthy persons (Winter & Sienko, 1988; Dingwell, Davis, & Frazier, 1996). Miff et al. (2005) compared temporal symmetries in a healthy group with the values in a transtibial amputee group during gait initiation and termination. Nolan et al. (2003) took an interest in changes in gait symmetry influenced by gait speed in transtibial and transfemoral amputees in comparison with a healthy group. The interlimb gait symmetry of transtibial amputees wearing two different prosthetic feet in the early rehabilitation stage was investigated by Marinakis (2004). Full symmetry in one's gait is not always desirable. The human system, with its major structural asymmetries in the neuromuscular skeletal system (one limb has been amputated) cannot perform optimally when the gait is symmetrical (Winter & Sienko, 1988). Non symmetrical gait performance, with constraints of its residual system and the mechanics of its prosthesis, is better in this case. For persons who have undergone amputation, asymmetrical gait may be the instrument which protects the stump of the disabled limb. We can say that gait asymmetry would be a relevant measure for investigating the gait characteristics of amputees and establishing their propensity for future joint pain and degeneration (Nolan et al., 2003). For amputee gait, the choice of a suitable prosthesis is very important. The influence of a prosthetic foot on gait variables in a group of these subjects was observed by Gitter et al. (1991). Efficiency of performance of the gait cycle is also markedly influenced by a prosthesis or prosthetic foot alignment. Rehabilitation of an amputee can be considered to be successful only when the amputee finds the prosthesis aesthetic and comfortable during walking. Prosthesis alignment has to correspond {{to the demands of the}} prosthetist (Fridman, Ona, & Isakov, 2003). When the prosthetic foot is not aligned optimally, this fact can show up in different levels of gait cycle performance. During gait analysis, the prosthesis is intentionally "not optimally" aligned in order to elicit the implied implications. Fridman, Ona and Isakov (2003) observed the influence of a prosthetic foot positioned in external rotation. Schmalz, Blumentritt and Jarasch (2002) used sagittal shifting of the foot to both anterior and posterior directions and foot alignment to both plantar a dorsal flexion. Blumentritt et al. (1999) focussed on the effects of sagittal plane prosthetic alignment to the magnitude of knee joint loads on a standing transtibial amputee. The objectives of prosthetic alignment in persons with lower limb amputation are the enhancement of the remaining limb's comfort and to maximize the individual's walking capabilities. In biomechanical gait analysis, it is important to investigate not only the relationship between prosthetic foot alignment and the prosthetic limb, but also the relationship between this alignment and activity of the contralateral, sound limb (Pinzur et al., 1995). An accent on the sound limb appears in other studies (Nolan & Lees, 2000; Hurley et al., 1990), but there the question of various prosthetic alignments is not considered. This relationship between the sound and the prosthetic limb can be quantitative, measured by the symmetry or asymmetry of the measured variables...|$|E
