His reign lasted for 46 years, longer than any Norwegian king since Harald I. Haakon was born into the troubled civil war era in Norway, but his reign eventually managed to put an <b>end</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> internal conflicts. At {{the start of his}} reign, during his minority, his later rival Earl Skule Bårdsson served as regent. As a king of the birkebeiner faction, Haakon defeated the uprising of the final bagler royal pretender, Sigurd Ribbung, in 1227. He put a definitive <b>end</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> civil war era when he had Skule Bårdsson killed in 1240, a year after he had himself proclaimed king in opposition to Haakon. Haakon thereafter formally appointed his own son as his co-regent.|$|E

Annebault landed a force near Newhaven, during which Camber Castle may have fired on the French fleet, and on 23 July they landed four detachments on the Isle of Wight, including {{a party that}} took the site of Sandown Castle, which was still under construction. The French expedition moved further on along the coast on 25 July, bringing an <b>end</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> immediate invasion threat.

A peace treaty was agreed in June 1546, bringing an <b>end</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> war. By the time that Henry died the following year, in total the huge sum of £376,000 had been spent on the Device projects.|$|E
