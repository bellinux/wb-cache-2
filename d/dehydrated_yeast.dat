Targeted profiling of immune-associated genes in whole blood is an effective platform for identification of a) novel molecular pathways and b) immune response markers to feed additives with immune-altering properties. The objectives {{of this study were}} to identify novel molecular pathways and immune response markers that are increased by dietary OG during a 28 -d supplementation period. We hypothesized that several immune-associated genes in whole blood are up- or down-regulated during a 28 d supplementation period. Thirty-seven healthy, unchallenged, 180 - 200 g male CD rats received a diet containing 0 (control; n = 5, only 28 days), 0. 5...|$|E
30|$|The {{majority}} of studies regarding {{the effect of}} nutrients on yeast derived aroma compounds have focused on nutrient addition to the grape juice immediately prior to or during alcoholic fermentation. The common oenological practice of using active dry yeast (ADY) for wine fermentation necessitates rehydration, since water availability in ADY is too low for yeast to maintain metabolic activity during storage (Rapoport et al. 1997). This step represents a further opportunity for nutrient supplementation. Previous studies have demonstrated the efficacy of nutrient supplementation {{at this point in}} time on yeast viability and vitality. Supplementation of organic nutrient in the form of inactive dry yeast (IDY) was found to increase fermentation rate, supposedly due to an incorporation of solubilised sterol present in IDY (Soubeyrand et al. 2005). Additions of fermentable carbon source and magnesium salts were also shown to enhance both viability and vitality of <b>dehydrated</b> <b>yeast</b> following rehydration (Kraus et al. 1981; Rodríguez-Porrata et al. 2008).|$|E
40|$|Cryptococcus gattii {{lives in}} the {{environment}} (1), usually in association with certain trees or soil around trees. Humans and animals can become infected with C. gattii after inhaling airborne, <b>dehydrated</b> <b>yeast</b> cells or spores (2), which travel through the respiratory tract and enter the lungs of the host (3). The small size of the yeast and/or spores allows them to become lodged deep in the lung tissue. The environment inside the host body signals C. gattii to transform into its yeast form, and the cells grow thick capsules to protect themselves (4). The yeasts then divide and multiply by budding. After infecting the lungs, C. gattii cells can travel through the bloodstream (5) 22 ̆ 0 ac 2 ̆ 01 deither {{on their own or}} within macrophage cells 22 ̆ 0 ac 2 ̆ 01 d to infect other areas of the body, typically the central nervous system (6).

5000|$|The use of steamed or boiled potatoes, {{water from}} potato boiling, or {{sugar in a}} bread dough {{provides}} food {{for the growth of}} yeasts; however, too much sugar will <b>dehydrate</b> them. <b>Yeast</b> growth is inhibited by both salt and sugar, but more so with salt than sugar. [...] Fats, such as butter or eggs, slow down yeast growth; however, others say the effect of fat on dough remains unclear, presenting evidence that small amounts of fat are beneficial for baked bread volume.|$|R
40|$|Life-threatening infections {{caused by}} the {{encapsulated}} fungal pathogen Cryptococcus neoformans have been increasing steadily over the past 10 years because of the onset of AIDS and the expanded use of immunosuppressive drugs. Intricate host-organism interactions make the full understanding of pathogenicity and virulence of C. neoformans difficult. We discuss the current knowledge of the characteristics C. neoformans must possess to enter the host and establish progressive disease: basic growth requirements and virulence factors, such as the polysaccharide capsule; shed products of the organism; melanin production; mannitol secretion; superoxide dismutase; proteases; and phospholipases. Cryptococcus neoformans is an encapsulated fungal organism (Figure 1) that can cause disease in apparently immunocompetent, as well as immunocompromised, hosts (1, 2). Most susceptible to infection are patients with T-cell deficiencies (1, 2). C. neoformans var. neoformans causes most cryptococcal infections in humans, so this review will focus on information from the neoformans variety of this basidiomycetous fungus. C. neoformans var. neoformans is found worldwide; its main habitats are debris around pigeon roosts and soil contaminated with decaying pigeon or chicken droppings (1, 3). Not part of the normal microbial flora of humans, C. neoformans is only transiently isolated from persons with no pathologic features (2, 4). It is generally accepted that the organism enters the host by the respiratory route {{in the form of}} a <b>dehydrated</b> haploid <b>yeast</b> or as basidiospores. After some time in the lungs, the organism hematogenously spreads to extrapulmonary tissues; since it has a predilection for the brain, infected persons usually contract meningoencephalitis (1). If untreated, cryptococcal meningoencephalitis is 100 % fatal, and even when treated with the most effective antifungal drugs, cryptococcal infections can be fatal if the host does not have adequate T-cell-dependent immune function (2) ...|$|R
40|$|The {{optimization}} of autolysis of Saccharomyces cerevisiae from brewery was studied {{aiming at}} the maximum ribo-nucleic acid extraction and yeast extract production. The best conditions for yeast autolysis was 55. 2 ºC, pH = 5. 1 and 9. 8 % NaCl for 24 h of processing, without the NH 3 use. In these conditions, the RNA yield was 89. 7 %, resulting in 51. 3 % of <b>dehydrated</b> <b>yeast</b> extract with 57. 9 % protein. The use of 12. 2 % NH 3 at 60 ºC after autolysis (8 h) and plasmolysis (8 h) was not viable {{due to the}} reduction in the RNA yield from 89. 7 to 78. 4 %. On the other hand, the thermal shock at 60 ºC for 15 minutes prior to autolysis provided an increase in the yield from 89. 7 to 91. 4 %. The autolysis, including NaCl plasmolysis in the optimized conditions was efficient, economic and with short time, thus usable for industrial purpose to obtain more valuable products such as yeast extract enriched in RNA and/or pro-tein, for different applications...|$|E
40|$|Aflatoxins are hepatotoxic {{metabolites}} {{produced by}} Aspergillus flavus and A. parasiticus {{on a number}} of agricultural commodities. This research was carried out to evaluate the ability of thermolysed and active Saccharomyces cerevisiae to attenuate liver damage caused by aflatoxin. Diets were prepared containing 0 aflatoxin; 400 mug kg- 1 aflatoxin; 400 mug kg- 1 aflatoxin plus 1 % of dehydrated active yeast, and 400 mug kg- 1 aflatoxin plus 1 % of thermolysed yeast. A bioassay with Wistar rats was conducted for 28 days, and body organs were weighted and analyses of the liver tissue of the animals were performed. The relative weight of heart, kidneys and liver from animals submitted to the different treatments did not show any difference, and liver tissue of animals feeding on the aflatoxin-free diet was adopted as a toxicity-free pattern. Hepatic tissue of animals feeding on diets containing 400 mug kg- 1 aflatoxin or the diet supplemented with 1 % thermolysed yeast showed clear signs of toxicity and damage. Hepatic tissue of animals feeding on the diet containing 1 % of dehydrated active yeast showed less toxicity signs and damage than those receiving the diet containing 400 mug kg- 1 aflatoxin. Active, <b>dehydrated</b> <b>yeast</b> had the ability to reduce toxic effects caused by aflatoxin, but thermolysed yeast was not able to alleviate the effects of aflatoxin toxicity...|$|E
40|$|The {{possibility}} of using raw glycerol {{as a substrate}} for yeast biomass production {{as a source of}} proteins was investigated. Biomass concentration, protein content and total protein content of four yeasts (Yarrowia lipolytica NRRL YB- 423, Candida lipolytica NRRL Y- 1095, Candida utilis NRRL Y- 900 and Candida rugosa NRRL Y- 95) were determinate, comparing analytical grade glycerol and raw glycerol. Y. lipolytica NRRL YB- 423 has been selected as promising for cultivation in a raw glycerol-based medium, mainly due to the higher biomass concentration in relation to the other strains. For this strain, four different culture media were tested. The best results were obtained with 50 g/L glycerol, 5. 5 g/L ammonium phosphate, 5. 5 potassium dihydrogen phosphate, 1 g/L ammonium sulphate, 0. 25 g/L magnesium sulphate, 0. 021 g/L calcium chloride <b>dehydrate,</b> 1 g/L <b>yeast</b> extract, 1 g/L peptone, pH adjusted to 5. 5. In these conditions, it was possible to obtain 17. 8 ± 0. 6 g/L maximum biomass concentration, 18. 2 ± 1. 0 % protein content and 3. 1 ± 0. 1 g/L total protein production. These results represent a 1. 2 -fold increase in biomass concentration, a 1. 5 -fold increase in protein content and a 1. 9 -fold increase in total protein production in relation to the results obtained with the previously medium composition...|$|R
40|$|Esta pesquisa teve por objetivo determinar a digestibilidade aparente de seis alimentos energéticos: silagem de milho úmido; aveia integral; urucum; raspa de {{mandioca}}; feno de alfafa e algaroba e cinco protéicos: soja integral,; farelo de coco; leucena; levedura de álcool e soro desidratado de leite. Foram confeccionadas 12 rações purificadas, peletizadas, contendo esses alimentos, sendo uma referência (purificada), a qual serviu de base para o estudo, sendo estas marcadas com 0, 10 % de óxido de crômio-III. Os peixes (240 juvenis de tilápia do Nilo com aproximadamente 100, 00 g) foram alojados em tanques-rede para o {{manejo de}} alimentação e coleta de fezes. Os tanques-rede, contendo esses peixes, foram mantidos durante o dia em aquários de alimentação (250 L), um para cada tratamento, onde receberam refeições à vontade das 8 às 17 h 30 min horas. Posteriormente, foram transferidos para aquários de coleta de fezes (300 L), também individuais aos tratamentos, onde permaneceram até a manhã do dia subseqüente. O coeficiente de digestibilidade aparente dos alimentos foi calculado com base no teor de óxido de crômio dos nutrientes nas rações e nas fezes. Pode-se concluir que: dentre os alimentos energéticos, a raspa de mandioca e a silagem de milho úmido destacam- se por apresentarem os melhores CDA para a MS e a PB, além de maiores valores de ED; embora a aveia tenha apresentado bom CDA para a MS e PB, não se revelou boa fonte energética para a tilápia do Nilo; a algaroba proporciona excelente valor de energia digestível; e; dentre os alimentos protéicos: o soro de leite, a levedura de álcool e o farelo de coco destacam- se por apresentarem os melhores CDA para a MS e a PB, além dos maiores valores de ED e que a leucena e a soja integral apresentam os piores CDA para a MS e PB e os menores valores de ED. This research aimed {{to determine the}} apparent digestibility of six energetic ingredients: ensiled high-moisture corn, raw oats, urucum, manioc flakes, algoroba and alfafa hay and, five proteic ones: soybean, coconut meal, leucena, alcohol <b>yeast</b> and <b>dehydrated</b> milk. 12 purified diets were formulated including these ingredients and one as a reference. All diets were supplemented with 0. 01 % of chromic oxide as marker. 240 Nile tilapia juveniles, with 100. 00 ± 10. 0 g average weight were stocked in cages (10 fish/cage) for feeding and feces collection. During the feeding time (0800 AM - 0530 PM) these tanks were kept in 250 L aquaria, one for each treatment, and fish were fed ad libitum. After that they were transferred to 300 L aquaria adapted for feces collection, where they stayed until next morning. The apparent digestibility coefficient (ADC) was determined based on chromic oxide concentration on diet and feces. It was concluded that, among the energetic ingredients, the manioc flakes and ensiled high-moisture corn showed the highest ADC for dry matter and crude protein and the best value for digestible energy; although the raw oats had showed good ADC for dry matter and crude protein. it did not {{prove to be a}} good energetic source for Nile tilapia; algaroba showed to be a good source of digestible energy; and, among proteic ingredients, the <b>dehydrated</b> milk, alcohol <b>yeast</b> and coconut meal showed the best ADC for dry matter and crude protein and also the highest values for digestible energy; leucena and soybean showed the worst ADC for dry matter and crude protein and the lowest values for digestible energy...|$|R
