50|$|A typical {{case where}} a RAID enters <b>degraded</b> <b>mode</b> is a simple two-drive mirror after a power failure - it is {{unlikely}} the drives are in sync. Every time blocks are written to the storage elements (physical drives, in this case), certain accounting information is updated after the write. The RAID controller will notice that the storage elements are not in sync, will place the array in <b>degraded</b> <b>mode,</b> and - generally - will start a background resync (rebuild) operation. Simple mirroring solutions will resynchronize the entire array, block by block, across both drives, which can be quite time-consuming; this time can be greatly reduced by the usage of a write intent bitmap.|$|E

A single-drive failure in a RAID 0+1 configuration results in one of the lower-level stripes completely failing, and the top-level mirror entering <b>degraded</b> <b>mode.</b> Which of the two setups is preferable depends on the details of the application in question, such as whether or not spare disks are available, and how they should be spun up.|$|E

50|$|When a RAID array {{experiences}} {{the failure of}} one or more disks, it can enter <b>degraded</b> <b>mode,</b> a fallback mode that generally allows the continued usage of the array, but either loses the performance boosts of the RAID technique (such as a RAID-1 mirror across two disks when one of them fails; performance will fall back to that of a normal, single drive) or experiences severe performance penalties due to the necessity to reconstruct the damaged data from error correction data.|$|E

50|$|The {{first flight}} of the S-97 {{occurred}} on 22 May 2015. It flew for 1 hour instead of the 30 minutes scheduled, completing three takeoffs and landings; forward, rearward and sideward. For this initial flight, the Raider was flown with its triplex {{fly-by-wire flight control system}} in backup <b>degraded</b> <b>mode</b> so as to focus on basic airworthiness in the low-speed regime. The flight begins a year-long test program of about 100 flight-hours to expand the flight envelope to meet Sikorsky’s key targets of 220-knot cruise speed carrying weapons, hover at 6,000 feet on a 95F day and 3g maneuverability at speed. Toward the end of Phase 1 testing, software will be upgraded to Block 2, bringing in the propulsor and articulating tail to increase speed and enable the full flight envelope. The second prototype (P2) was displayed to the public in October 2015. After two flight hours and a few months of testbench validation of the propulsion drivetrain, P1 is scheduled for higher speed around 2016.|$|E
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this paper is to propose an {{approach}} for assessing the risk of producing non-compliant drinking water (i. e. one of the quality parameter exceeds the standards fixed by legislation), taking into account the quality parameters of raw water and the process line of the treatment plant (technology, different failure modes and corresponding failure rates). Firstly, nominal and <b>degraded</b> <b>modes</b> of each step of the treatment line are analyzed, in order to obtain transfer functions (which give output concentration of parameters as a function of the input concentration) for each step of the treatment and each quality parameter, in nominal and degraded functioning. The transfer function of the whole treatment process can thereby be obtained by combination of transfer functions of each step, and failure conditions of the whole treatment process and corresponding degraded global transfer function could be determined. Secondly, an inversion of global functions (nominal <b>mode</b> and all <b>degraded</b> <b>modes)</b> enables estimation of probability for the resource to exceed thresholds fixed by regulation (in this case, a scenario of non-compliant drinking water exists), and to obtain a compliant water availability. Finally, this paper presents a software tool developed to evaluate the risk of non-compliant produced water, using the described methodology...|$|R

50|$|The {{primary risk}} of an {{electronic}} {{train control system}} {{is that if the}} communications link between any of the trains is disrupted then {{all or part of the}} system might have to enter a failsafe state until the problem is remedied. Depending on the severity of the communication loss, this state can range from vehicles temporarily reducing speed, coming to a halt or operating in a <b>degraded</b> <b>mode</b> until communications are re-established. If communication outage is permanent some sort of contingency operation must be implemented which may consist of manual operation using absolute block or, in the worst case, the substitution of an alternative form of transportation.As a result, high availability of CBTC systems is crucial for proper operation, especially if we consider that such systems are used to increase transport capacity and reduce headway. System redundancy and recovery mechanisms must then be thoroughly checked to achieve a high robustness in operation.With the increased availability of the CBTC system is very bad and it must also be considered the need for an extensive training and periodical refresh of system operators on the recovery procedures. In fact, one of the major system hazards in CBTC systems is the probability of human error and improper application of recovery procedures if the system becomes unavailable.|$|E
5000|$|In September 2010, the BEA {{published}} {{its final}} report into the accident. One of the contributing causes was incorrect maintenance procedures which allowed water {{to enter the}} angle of attack (AOA) sensors. The water then froze in flight, rendering the sensors inoperative and thus removing the protection they provided from the aircraft's flight management system. The primary cause of the accident was that when the crew attempted an improvised test of the AOA warning system (which was not functioning due to the blocked sensors) they {{lost control of the}} aircraft. (Some of the aircraft's computers received conflicting information and operated in <b>degraded</b> <b>mode</b> where some protections were not available. precisely: two out of three angle of attack sensors have been frozen and rendered inoperative. System logic has been designed to reject sensor values which deviate significantly from the others. In this specific case, this principle led to the rejection of the single operative angle of attack sensor, and to the acceptance of the two faulty ones, which provided similar values, but have been stuck since cruise flight. This in turn led to erratic limit speeds computations, moreover stall warning in normal law was not possible. All the above resulted in degraded functionality of automated systems, some stall protection functions were not available. However, stall warning was still available, and has been triggered during the last phase of the flight.) [...] The crew was unaware that the AOA sensors were blocked, but they also disregarded the proper speed limits for the tests they were performing, resulting in a stall. Five safety recommendations were made.|$|E

It reconfigures RAID- 5 to RAID- 0 in <b>degraded</b> <b>mode.</b> Using this scheme, the calculation of the failure data and the generation of parity in writing the new data to the failed disk can be reduced.

This paper discusses a prototype shoulder joint more appropriately described as a combinatorial mechanism which exhibits the features. Additional benefits in terms of modularity, self-calibration, reliability, self-test, and <b>degraded</b> <b>modes</b> of operation are briefly discussed in the conclusion. ...|$|R
