A questionnaire {{study was conducted to}} reveal possible correlations between viral findings on the conscripts' hands and their acute gastroenteritis symptoms. In addition to the swab samples, 14 fecal samples were obtained for viral analysis. In total, norovirus was present in 9. 0 % of the surface swabs in 2013, whereas enteric adenovirus was present in 0. 0 % and non-enteric adenovirus in 9. 4 %. In the same year, 2. 6 % of the <b>hand</b> <b>swabs</b> contained norovirus, 2. 6 % enteric adenovirus, and 40. 3 % non-enteric adenovirus. Norovirus GI. 6 was continually detected on the surfaces of garrison A, and identical virus was detected in some of the fecal samples.

Samples included raw pork, roasted pork, water, onions, tomatoes, cabbage, butcher’s <b>hands</b> (<b>swabs),</b> utensils (swabs) and fly midgut extracts. A total of 693 samples were collected from 77 pork butcheries from June- October 2014. Overall 53. 2 % pork joints had samples positive for Salmonella enterica subsp. enterica serovars. Isolation rates ranged from 31. 2 % (24 / 77) for raw pork, 1. 3 % (1 / 77) for roasted pork, 7. 8 % (6 / 77) for tomatoes, 2. 6 % (2 / 77) for onions, 5. 2 % (4 / 77) for cabbage, 9. 1 % (7 / 77) in water, and 22. 1 % (17 / 77) from fly midguts. Swab samples taken from utensil and butcher’s <b>hands</b> <b>swabs</b> were found negative (Heilmann et al., 2015). In the isolates obtained, resistance towards 22 antibiotics was tested. Resistances were found towards 11 out of the 22 antibiotics tested. High resistances were found to Cephazolin (97 %), Cefotixime (93 %), Gentamicin (88 %), and Ceftazidime (86 %). Intermediate resistance was found to Ciprofloxacin (59 %) and Amoxicillin-Clavulanic acid (57. 6 %). Most isolates (85 %) were susceptible to Levofloxacin, Ofloxacin, Sulfamethoxazole and Trimethoprim. Identification of plasmids by PCR-based replicon typing was performed recognizing FIA,FIB,FIC,HI 1,HI 2,I 1 - 1 ᵞ,L/M,N,P,W,T,A/C,K,B/O,X,Y,F and FIIA. Six incompatibility groups were identified: FIA, W, FIC, FIB, P, Y with more than one incompatibility group existing among different isolates. A high resistance rate among Salmonella strains was found while the total number of incompatibility groups detected was with approximation 2. 4. Thus, even though the total number of plasmids per strain is low, resistance rates detected remain high. The high resistance rates are probably resulting from intensified food animal production driving a greater use of antibiotics, which is a crucial aspect of public health concern.

40|$|Background: A {{previous}} {{study found that}} the prevalence of contamination with bacteria of faecal-origin on the hands of men differed across UK cities, with a general trend of increased contamination in northern cities. The aim {{of this study was to}} (1) confirm the north-south trend (2) identify causes for the trend. Methods: <b>Hand</b> <b>swabs</b> from commuters (n = 308) at train stations in 4 cities were tested for the presence of faecal bacteria. Results: The prevalence of hand contamination with faecal bacteria was again higher in cities in the north compared to the south (5 % in London, 4 % in Birmingham, 10 % in Liverpool and 19 % in Newcastle). Contamination risk decreased with age and better personal hygiene (self-reported). Soil contact and shaking hands increased contamination with faecal bacteria. However, in multivariable analysis, none of these factors fully explained the variation in contamination across cities. Conclusion: The study confirmed the north-south differences in faecal contamination of hands without finding a clear cause for the trend. Faecal contamination of hands was associated with personal hygiene indicators suggesting that microbiological testing may contribute to evaluating hygiene promotion campaigns. Backgroun...|$|R
40|$|Shiga toxin (Stx) -producing Escherichia coli (STEC) {{infections are}} {{implicated in the}} {{development}} of the life-threatening hemolytic-uremic syndrome (HUS). Despite the magnitude of the social and economic problems caused by HUS, no licensed vaccine or effective therapy is currently available for human use. Prevention of STEC infections continues being the most important measure to reduce HUS incidence. This is especially true for Argentina where HUS incidence among children is extremely high and shows an endemic pattern. The aim of this work was to investigate serologically adult staff of kindergartens in Buenos Aires city and suburban areas in order to detect possible carriers, and to educate personnel about good practices to reduce HUS transmission. We also assessed the microbiological quality of water and meal samples from the same kindergartens. We tested 67 healthy adults, 13 water supplies and 6 meals belonging to 6 public kindergartens. We analysed <b>hand</b> <b>swabs</b> for isolation of STEC and serum samples for the presence of antibodies against Stx and lipopolysaccharide (LPS) of O 157 serogroup. We identified 46 Stx 2 -positive individuals, but only 7 for O 157 LPS. No presence of STEC pathogens was detected in hands of staff, water or meal sample...|$|R
40|$|Background and objectives: Food {{handlers}} {{with poor}} personal hygiene could be {{potential sources of}} infections of many intestinal parasites and enteropathogenic bacteria. Infections in food handlers may pose a real threat {{to those who are}} more susceptible to infection like hospitalized patients especially those who suffered from immunodeficient conditions. Hence the present study was undertaken to assess the prevalence of intestinal parasites and bacteria among food handlers working in the dietary section of a tertiary care hospital. Materials and methods: <b>Swabs</b> from both <b>hands</b> and stool samples were collected from 84 food handlers working in dietary section in tertiary care hospital. The stool samples were examined microscopically for parasites by wet mount, iodine mount and modified acid fast staining directly and after the formalin ether concentration technique. All the samples were cultured on blood agar and MacConkey’s agar and organisms were identified according to standard procedure. Result: Apart from commensals, cultures from <b>hand</b> <b>swabs</b> were positive for Staphylococcus aureus (5. 9 %), Enterococcus fecalis (7 %), Klebsiella pneumoniae (22. 7 %), Escherichia coli (20. 5 %), Enterobacter species (1. 6 %) and Citrobacter species (1. 1 %). No enteropathogenic bacteria were isolated from the stool samples. Thirty four (40. 5 %) stool specimens were positive for different intestinal parasites...|$|R
40|$|Background: Antibiotic {{resistance}} is common among bacterial pathogens associated with both community acquired and nosocomial infections. In {{view of the}} present problem of drug resistance we investigated the prevalence of methicillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) and amplified the mecA gene in the isolates from the <b>hand</b> <b>swabs</b> of the hospital personnel. Methodology: The nuc gene was amplified to characterize these isolates at species level. The S. aureus isolates were analyzed for their susceptibility to different classes of antibiotics using the disk diffusion method. The spot inoculation test was performed to detect methicillinase production in these isolates. Results: In the screened isolates of S. aureus, 14. 2 and 15 kb of plasmids were present. These isolates showed pronounced resistance against â-lactam antibiotics including second- and third-generation cephalosporins, aminoglycosides, macrolides and fluoroquinolone. Some of the isolates {{included in this study}} were resistant to three or more antibiotics. Expression of methicillinase was detected by spot inoculation test, {{and a few of the}} isolates were found to produce methicillinase. Moreover, mecA gene was also amplified. Of 17 isolates only 7 showed presence of mecA gene. Conclusion: This study highlights the emerging trend of multiple drug resistance in S. aureus strains isolated from hospital personnel working in a premier hospital in North India...|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to {{investigate}} the bacteriological quality of strawberries at harvest and to study risk factors such as irrigation water, soil and picker’s hand cleanliness. Four farms were visited during the harvest season in 2012. Samples of strawberries, irrigation water, soil and <b>hand</b> <b>swabs</b> were collected and analyzed for E. coli, Campylobacter, Salmonella and STEC Although fecal indicators and pathogens were found in environmental samples, only one of 80 samples of strawberries was positive for E. coli (1. 0 log 10 cfu/g) and pathogens were not detected in any of the strawberry samples. The water samples from all irrigation sources were contaminated with E. coli in numbers ranging from 0 to 3. 3 log 10 cfu/g. Campylobacter (8 / 16 samples) and Salmonella (1 / 16 samples) were isolated from samples with high numbers of E. coli. The water samples collected from a lake had lower numbers of E. coli than the samples from rivers and a stream. The present study indicated continuous background contamination in the primary production environment. Although the background contamination was not reflected on the strawberries tested here, the results must be interpreted with caution due to the limited number of samples...|$|R
40|$|Institutional {{foodborne}} illness outbreaks continue {{to hit the}} headlines in the country, indicating the failure of food handlers to adhere to safe practices during food preparation. Thus, this study aimed to compare the knowledge, attitude, and self-reported practices (KAP) of food safety assessment and microbiological assessment of food handlers’ hands {{as an indicator of}} hygiene practices in food premises. This study involved 85 food handlers working in a university located in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia. The food safety KAP among food handlers (n = 67) was assessed using a questionnaire; while the <b>hand</b> <b>swabs</b> (n = 85) were tested for the total aerobic count, coliforms, and Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus aureus, Salmonella, Vibrio cholerae and Vibrio parahaemolyticus. The food handlers had moderate levels of food safety knowledge (61. 7 %) with good attitude (51. 9 / 60) and self-reported practices (53. 2 / 60). It is noteworthy that the good self-reported practices were not reflected in the microbiological assessment of food handlers’ hands, in which 65 % of the food handlers examined had a total aerobic count ≥ 20 CFU/cm 2 and Salmonella was detected on 48 % of the food handlers’ hands. In conclusion, the suggestion of this study was that the food handlers had adequate food safety knowledge, but perceived knowledge failed to be translated into practices at work...|$|R
40|$|Background: Methicillin {{resistant}} Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) {{is one of}} {{the most}} important pathogen in hospitals. Healthcare personnel are the main source of nosocomial infections and identification and control of MRSA carriers can reduce incidence of infections. The aim of this study was to determine the prevalence of MRSA and their antibiotic susceptibility profile among healthcare workers in Gorgan. Materials and Method: 333 healthcare workers were participated in this cross-sectional study in 2009. Samples were taken with sterile cotton swabs from both anterior nares and <b>hands.</b> <b>Swabs</b> were plated immediately on to the mannitol salt agar. Suspected colonies were confirmed as S. aureus by Gram staining, catalase, coagulase and DNase tests. Minimum inhibition concentration by micro dilution broth method was used to determine methicillin resistant strains. Antimicrobial susceptibility to other antibiotics was performed according to NCCLS guidelines by disc diffusion method. Result: Frequency of S. aureus and MRSA carriers among healthcare workers was 24 % and 3 % respectively. The highest rate of S. aureus and MRSA carriers were observed in operating room staff. Resistance to penicillin was seen in 97. 5 % of isolates and all strains were sensitive to vancomycin. Conclusions: Frequency of S. aureus and MRSA in healthcare workers was median and rather low respectively. Continual monitoring and control of carriers can reduce distribution of this organism and their infection...|$|R
40|$|A {{survey to}} {{establish}} environmental contamination {{was conducted at}} the Infectious Diseases Hospital (IDH) of Jakarta by taking swabs from 90 hospital personnels who are directly involved in patients care. These swabs were taken from their hands, nails, throat and rectum. Swabs and cultures were also obtained from 167 equipments, solid and liquid material, food from the hospital, and {{the air in the}} hospital wards. From total of 437 specimen obtained, 73. 7 % showed presence contaminated result. There was 100 % positive culture result noted in <b>hands</b> and nails <b>swabs,</b> 94. 8 % culture positive for any microorganism result was obtained from throat swabs while rectal swab indicated only 4. 4 % rate of contamination. Results of 167 swabs from material/equipments in the hospital, showed that 85. 1 % of them were not sterile, this included 59. 1 % of 54 liquid material, 37. 3 % from 35 liquid material which were supposed to be sterile, 100 % positive culture of 17 liquid material specimen that were supposed to be clean. From solid materials 66. 7 % of 51 specimen were not sterile. This included 76. 2 % from 21 specimen that were supposed to be sterile, and 100 % from 7 specimen that supposed to be clean. Also 100 % non sterility was obtained from 23 other material and 62 equipment.

Background. Black people in the USA is afflicted with {{a higher rate of}} methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) infection. is study determined the prevalence of MRSA carriage among black college students at a university setting. Methods. Hand and nasal swabswere collected and screened forMRSAbymannitol fermentation, coagulase, andDNase activities and their resistance to oxacillin. MRSA isolates were analyzed for antimicrobial resistance pattern, genetic pro�le for staphylococcal cassette chromosome mec (SCCmec) type, pulsed-�eld type, multilocus sequence type (ST), and the presence of Panton-Valentine leukocidin (PVL) gene. Results. MRSA was isolated from 1 of the 312 (0. 3 %) <b>hand</b> <b>swabs</b> and 2 of the 310 (0. 65 %) nasal swabs, respectively. All isolates lack multidrug resistance and have type IV SCCmec, characteristic of community-associated MRSA. ese isolates were a ST 8 -MRSA-IVa-PVL(+) (USA 300 strain), a ST 8 -MRSA-IVb-PVL(−), and a new MLST, ST 2562 -MRSA-IV-PVL(−), identi�ed in this study. ese isolates were thus not transmitted among students. Conclusion. We found a low rate of MRSA carriage among students in a black university.

30|$|In {{the second}} part of our study, {{antimicrobial}} resistance profile of isolates has been investigated. The World Health Organisation has divided antimicrobials in three categories as critically important, highly important and important according to their importance in human medicine (Collignon et al. 2009). In this study, six critically important antimicrobials (namely; gentamicin, netilmicin, imipenem, amikacin, erythromycine, ciprofloxacin), six highly important antimicrobials (cefazolin, trimethoprim, trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole, tetracycline and cefoxitin) and two important antimicrobials (clindamycin, mupirocin) were tested. One isolates found to be resistant to critically important antimicrobials and eight isolates were resistant to two highly important antimicrobials. Multi drug resistance (MDR) was determined from a mouth isolates, which was resistant to erythromycin and mupirocin but none of the isolates were methicillin resistant. Sepin-Özen et al. (2013) reported that percentage of MRSA as 5.3 among food handlers work in Antalya, Turkey. In other study, nasal carriage rate of MRSA reported as 18  % (6 out of 34 farm workers) among farm workers in Turkey (Hazımoğlu 2011). In a study conducted on food handlers it was reported that only one isolate out of 200 isolates (Udo et al. 2009) was methicillin resistant. Similarly, Kamal et al. (2013) also found that none of the <b>hand</b> <b>swabs</b> of S. aureus isolates from the dairy workers and food handlers was positive for the mecA gene. Collignon et al. (2009) reported that although it currently represents a low proportion of the total MRSA infections that occur in people, there are an increasing number of reports of animal-derived MRSA especially from pigs, causing community-onset infection in people.|$|R
