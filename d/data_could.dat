5|$|The {{satellite}} {{was also}} {{equipped with a}} data collection system (DCS) to collect information from remote, individually equipped ground stations and to relay the data to central acquisition stations. Due to the orbit of the satellite, <b>data</b> <b>could</b> be obtained at a minimum of every 12 hours. No data processing or signal multiplexing occurred on the satellite. The design of the DCS came from the Nimbus-3 platform, then known as the interrogation, recording, and location system (IRLS).|$|E
5|$|In a 2011 {{paper for}} the Conference on Human Factors in Computing Systems, authors Anna Eaglin and Shaowen Bardzell {{discussed}} the Magic Wand {{within the context}} of devices used in sexual behavior that were not originally created for that purpose. A 2012 study published in the journal Sexual and Relationship Therapy evaluated seven vibrators for use with clinical therapy for sexual stimulation. They found that the Magic Wand displayed a high degree of movement and oscillation. The researchers suggested that their <b>data</b> <b>could</b> be used by therapists to select the optimum vibrator which could deliver both effectiveness and sensitivity for their clients.|$|E

5|$|Kepler-10c was {{the first}} Kepler target to be {{observed}} using Spitzer {{with the hope of}} detecting a shallow transit dip in a light curve. At the time of Kepler-10c's discovery, Spitzer was the only facility capable of detecting shallow transits in the Kepler data to an extent at which the <b>data</b> <b>could</b> be meaningfully analyzed. The planet was also the third transiting planet that was validated through an analysis of statistical data (rather than actual observation), after the planets Kepler-9d and Kepler-11g. In Kepler-10c's confirmation paper, the Kepler team discussed how a large fraction of planets in Kepler's field of view would be confirmed in this statistical manner.|$|E
5|$|The {{developers}} redesigned {{the game}} engine, {{the software that}} handles rendering and much of gameplay. Bungie hired an expert in motion capture to develop more realistic character animations. Building a motion capture studio in-house saved Bungie time as motion capture <b>data</b> <b>could</b> {{be applied to the}} game models the same day it was shot. The developers sought to increase replay value by focusing on improving artificial intelligence. Rather than scripting enemy encounters, they focused on a more open world or sandbox approach to battles.|$|E
5|$|Reynolds and Reynolds {{first entered}} into the {{electronic}} accounting market with the acquisition of a Boston-based accounting software developer in 1960. The software division was doing well in the 1970s, but its products were out-of-date by the 1980s. At the time, <b>data</b> <b>could</b> not be shared between departments and only one user was allowed on the system at a time. Each computer came {{at a cost of}} more than $100,000. Even as the computer division grew, the company's overall business revenue declined due to paper business forms becoming obsolete. In 1986, the company acquired Arnold Corporation, which increased Reynolds' revenues 50 percent and expanded its market presence to other industries besides car dealerships. The head of the computers division, David Holmes, was appointed CEO in 1989. He led the company's first large-scale lay-off in the printing division, cutting headcount and manufacturing space in half. The employees resisted the changes he incorporated. According to Forbes, this move was necessary and led to increases in profit and revenues.|$|E

5|$|Type-0 was {{released}} on October 27, 2011, receiving both physical and digital releases. It was initially announced for release in summer of that year, but unspecified difficulties with development including the stoppage of PlayStation Network caused a delay. It was then announced for released on October 13, but was delayed by two weeks. While Square Enix stated it wanted to improve its quality, no other information was given. It was speculated {{to be due to}} complaints surrounding the camera control and other gameplay elements. The releases of the soundtrack and the theme song were also delayed. Type-0 was one of a few releases for the PSP to be released on two UMDs, as Tabata wanted to cut as little content as possible, which would have been impossible if they had settled for using one UMD. A demo for the original game {{was released}} in August 2011, featuring seven playable characters and four missions at locked difficulty levels. Sava <b>data</b> <b>could</b> be transferred to the full game, unlocking special costumes and items and keeping experience points. A second demo {{was released on}} November 22, a month after the full game's release. It replaced the original demo and gave players access to exclusive items and costumes. A collector's edition was released exclusively through Square Enix's online store, containing artwork, a limited edition version of the soundtrack, postcards and a booklet of character introductions. The title was later added to their Ultimate Hits budget title collection.|$|E
5|$|Walker {{resisted}} Kenney's {{proposals that}} the bombers conduct attacks from low level using bombs armed with instantaneous fuses. Kenney ordered Walker {{to try the}} fuses {{for a couple of}} months, so that <b>data</b> <b>could</b> be gained about their effectiveness; a few weeks later Kenney discovered that Walker had discontinued their use. In November, Kenney arranged for a demonstration attack on the SS Pruth, a ship that had sunk off Port Moresby in 1924 and was often used for target practice. After the attack Walker and Kenney took a boat out to the wreck to inspect the damage. As expected, none of the four bombs dropped had hit the stationary wreck, but the instantaneous fuses had detonated the bombs when they struck the water, so bomb fragments had torn holes in the sides of the ship. Walker reluctantly conceded the point. A few weeks later, Walker was shot down leading a daylight raid over Rabaul, an attack that Kenney had ordered to be conducted at night.|$|E

25|$|Inferences about regoliths from phase curves are {{frequently}} based on Hapke parameterization. However, in a blind test M. Shepard and P.

These tests included modeling the three-term Henyey-Greenstein phase functions and the coherent backscatter opposition effect. This negative finding suggests that the radiative transfer model developed by B. Hapke may be inadequate for physical modeling based on photometry.|$|E

5000|$|One {{possible}} {{algebraic specification}} may provide two constructor functions for the data-element: a true constructor and a false constructor. Thus, a boolean <b>data</b> element <b>could</b> be declared, constructed, and initialized to a value. In this scenario, all other connective elements, such as XOR and AND, would be additional functions. Thus, a <b>data</b> element <b>could</b> be instantiated with either [...] "true" [...] or [...] "false" [...] value, and additional functions {{could be used}} to perform any operation on the data element.|$|R
25|$|Buffers {{are areas}} of memory {{set aside to}} hold data, often while moving it from one section of a program to another, or between programs. Buffer {{overflows}} can often be triggered by malformed inputs; if one assumes all inputs will be smaller than a certain size and the buffer is created to be that size, then an anomalous transaction that produces more <b>data</b> <b>could</b> cause it to write past {{the end of the}} buffer. If this overwrites adjacent data or executable code, this may result in erratic program behavior, including memory access errors, incorrect results, and crashes.|$|E
25|$|Solving such {{problems}} {{is actually an}} easy task and it is simply to avoid using ASCII format and use binary format instead. Not only it preserves the machine accuracy but also writing and reading to file system is a lot faster. The computational overhead to dump the trajectories becomes negligible and the trajectory files become about two orders of magnitude smaller in size. The downside might be that programming and decoding the <b>data</b> <b>could</b> become very tricky, but once it’s done correctly and with care, the advantages of using binary format are well worth the extra effort. BioMOCA is now equipped with the tools to record the trajectory information in binary format.|$|E
25|$|American {{researcher}} William Thompson {{headed the}} research team for the IPSFC, which tagged fish at various upstream locations, from which <b>data</b> <b>could</b> be collected for analysis.

In 1938, the IPSFC discovered {{what appeared to be a}} blockage of Fraser sockeye salmon at Hells Gate. Fish were turning up in tagging nets more than once, being held up behind the narrow passage of river, and re-appearing far downstream after being tagged. Based on these findings, Thompson decided to place increased emphasis on Hells Gate beginning in 1939.|$|E
