40|$|The {{focus of}} this work is to {{evaluate}} the accuracy of methods for extracting <b>damping</b> <b>ratios</b> with respect to: three extraction methods, different <b>damping</b> <b>ratios,</b> added noisy data, separated modes and close modes. To achieve this goal, a simulated analytical signal is analyzed by estimating the modal parameters. The simulated analytic signal is useful because the exact values are known and the characteristic of the FRF can be varied in order to observe how the accuracy of <b>damping</b> <b>ratios</b> is affected. Results show that the Continuous Wavelet Transform method gives the most accurate estimations even for data corrupted by the noise. The Complex Exponential method presents better results in the cases with higher modes and higher <b>damping</b> <b>ratios</b> without the noise. Wavelet Packet method and Continuous Wavelet Transform method are more suitable in the cases for extracting lower <b>damping</b> <b>ratios</b> than those for higher <b>damping</b> <b>ratios</b> even for data corrupted by the noise. And in general, the estimation results are more accurate in the cases with separated modes than those with close modes. by Jiun-Yan Wu. Thesis (M. Eng.)

40|$|Aiming at {{improving}} low-speed performance of variable speed hydraulic systems, the leaking parallel valve control {{is applied to}} the system during low-speed period. This method increases system <b>damping</b> <b>ratios</b> by increasing leakage controlled by the valve. In addition, the increase of <b>damping</b> <b>ratios</b> just compensates the reduction of <b>damping</b> <b>ratios</b> due to the friction negative slop, which helps to improve low-speed stability and achieve lower critical speed. In the whole process of closed loop control, the system in leaking parallel valve control has good speed performance with more stable and suitable <b>damping</b> <b>ratios</b> and basically avoids pressure impact at start and stop stages and still keeps comparatively high efficiency because the pump provides total flow and the valve only leaks out few flows...|$|R

25|$|For example, {{calculating the}} FRF for a massndash&springndash&damper {{system with a}} mass of 1nbsp&kg, spring {{stiffness}} of 1.93nbsp&N/mm and a <b>damping</b> <b>ratio</b> of 0.1. The values of the spring and mass give a natural frequency of 7nbsp&Hz for this specific system. Applying the 1nbsp&Hz square wave from earlier allows the calculation of the predicted vibration of the mass. The figure illustrates the resulting vibration. It happens in this example that the fourth harmonic of the square wave falls at 7nbsp&Hz. The frequency response of the massndash&springndash&damper therefore outputs a high 7nbsp&Hz vibration even though the input force had a relatively low 7nbsp&Hz harmonic. This example highlights that the resulting vibration is dependent on both the forcing function and the system that the force is applied to.|$|E

40|$|The impact {{harshness}} of cars is {{an important}} factor in ride comfort. Traditionally, impact harshness is evaluated via subjective measurements based on the experience of test drivers.

2500|$|It is {{conventionally}} {{believed that}} SSI is a purely beneficial effect, {{and it can}} conveniently be neglected for conservative design. SSI provisions of seismic design codes are optional and allow designers to reduce the design base shear of buildings by considering soil-structure interaction (SSI) as a beneficial effect. The main idea behind the provisions is that the soil-structure system can be replaced with an equivalent fixed-base model with a longer period and usually a larger <b>damping</b> <b>ratio.</b> Most of the design codes use oversimplified design spectra, which attain constant acceleration {{up to a certain}} period, and thereafter decreases monotonically with period. [...] Considering soil-structure interaction makes a structure more flexible and thus, increasing the natural period of the structure compared to the corresponding rigidly supported structure. [...] Moreover, considering the SSI effect increases the effective <b>damping</b> <b>ratio</b> of the system. [...] The smooth idealization of design spectrum suggests smaller seismic response with the increased natural periods and effective <b>damping</b> <b>ratio</b> due to SSI, which is the main justification of the seismic design codes to reduce the design base shear when the SSI effect is considered. The same idea also forms the basis of the current common seismic design codes such as ASCE 7-10 and ASCE 7-16. Although, the mentioned idea, i.e. reduction in the base shear, works well for linear soil-structure systems, it is shown that it cannot appropriately capture the effect of SSI on yielding systems. More recently, Khosravikia et al. evaluated the consequences of practicing the SSI provisions of ASCE 7-10 and those of 2015 National Earthquake Hazards Reduction Program (NEHRP), which form the basis of the 2016 edition of the seismic design standard provided by the ASCE. They showed that SSI provisions of both NEHRP and ASCE 7-10 result in unsafe designs for structures with surface foundation on moderately soft soils, but NEHRP slightly improves upon the current provisions for squat structures. For structures on very soft soils, both provisions yield conservative designs where NEHRP is even more conservative. Finally, both provisions yield near-optimal designs for other systems.|$|E

One of the structures was a three-storey reinforced concrete (RC) frame building with a shear core, while the other was a three-storey RC frame building without a core. Both buildings are part of the same large complex but are seismically separated from the rest of it. Statistical analysis of the relationships between maximum free field accelerations and responses at different points on the buildings was conducted and demonstrated strong correlation between those. System identification studies using recorded accelerations were undertaken and revealed that natural frequencies and <b>damping</b> <b>ratios</b> of the building structures vary during different earthquake excitations. This variation was statistically examined and relationships between identified natural frequencies and <b>damping</b> <b>ratios,</b> and the peak response acceleration at the roof level were developed. A general trend of decreasing modal frequencies and increasing <b>damping</b> <b>ratios</b> was observed with increased level of shaking and response.
