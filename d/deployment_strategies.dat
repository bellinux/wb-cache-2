40|$|Abstract—In {{multihop}} wireless sensor {{networks that}} are often characterized by many-to-one (convergecast) traffic patterns, problems related to energy imbalance among sensors often appear. Sensors closer to a data sink are usually required to forward {{a large amount of}} traffic for sensors farther from the data sink. Therefore, these sensors tend to die early, leaving areas of the network completely unmonitored and reducing the functional network lifetime. In our study, we explore possible sensor network <b>deployment</b> <b>strategies</b> that maximize sensor network lifetime by mitigating the problem of the hot spot around the data sink. Strategies such as variable-range transmission power control with optimal traffic distribution, mobile-data-sink deployment, multiple-data-sink deployment, nonuniform initial energy assignment, and intelligent sensor/relay deployment are investigated. We suggest a general model to analyze and evaluate these strategies. In this model, we not only discover how to maximize the network lifetime given certain network constraints but also consider the factor of extra costs involved in more complex <b>deployment</b> <b>strategies.</b> This paper presents a comprehensive analysis on the maximum achievable sensor network lifetime for different <b>deployment</b> <b>strategies,</b> and it also provides practical cost-efficient sensor network deployment guidelines.

40|$|Deployable gossamer {{structures}} for solar sails {{need to be}} deployed in a controlled way. Several strategies present have the disadvantage that the sail membrane cannot always be tensioned during the deployment process. In combination with a slow deployment, this involves the risk of an entanglement of the sail. Slow deployments of at least several minutes are desirable {{in order to keep}} inertial loads low and to implement Fault-Detection, Fault-Isolation and Recovery Techniques (FDIR). This might further require completely stopping and resuming the deployment process. For gossamer spacecraft based on crossed boom configurations with triangular sail segments, a <b>deployment</b> <b>strategy</b> is described that is assumed to allow such a controlled deployment process. With a combination of folding and coiling, it is ensured that the deployed sail area can be held taut between the partly deployed booms. During deployment, four deployment units with two spools each on which the sail is mounted (a half segment stowed on each) moves away from the central bus unit, the center of the deployed sail. The development was made in the Gossamer- 1 project of the German Aerospace Center (DLR). The folding and coiling of the membrane is mathematically modelled. This allows an investigation of the deployment geometry. It provides the mathematical relation between the deployed boom length and the deployed sail membrane geometry. By modelling the coiled zig-zag folding lines it is possible to calculate the deployment force vector as function of the deployment time. The stowing and <b>deployment</b> <b>strategy</b> was verified by tests with an engineering qualification model of the Gossamer- 1 deployment unit.
