This research project examines the period that starts in 1964, when a selective and culturally inspired support mechanism for feature films was introduced in Flanders.

This study makes use of original archival research, policy <b>documents</b> <b>analysis,</b> expert interviews, qualitative press <b>documents</b> <b>analysis,</b> and a quantitative content and qualitative textual analysis of films.
