5|$|Scientific <b>jury</b> <b>selection,</b> often {{abbreviated}} SJS, {{is the use}} {{of social}} science techniques and expertise to choose favorable juries during a criminal or civil trial. Scientific <b>jury</b> <b>selection</b> is used during the <b>jury</b> <b>selection</b> phase of the trial—when lawyers have the opportunity to question jurors and they and the judge choose which people will be on the jury. It almost always entails an expert's assistance in the attorney's use of peremptory challenges—the right to reject a certain number of potential jurors without stating a reason—during <b>jury</b> <b>selection.</b> The practice is currently confined to the American legal system.|$|E
5|$|The {{effectiveness}} of scientific <b>jury</b> <b>selection</b> {{has also been}} comparison tested against other methods, such as attorney folklore and intuition. For trial attorneys, justifying the expense of SJS is contingent upon an improvement of their own <b>jury</b> <b>selection</b> abilities. Several empirical studies of traditional <b>jury</b> <b>selection</b> (by attorneys acting alone) have indicated that it and SJS are about equally effective.|$|E

5|$|Kinne's {{second trial}} {{for the murder of}} James Kinne began on March 23, 1964. As <b>jury</b> <b>selection</b> got {{underway}} that day, the public was initially barred from the proceedings, but the restriction was soon loosened and the media were allowed into the courtroom. An unusually long <b>jury</b> <b>selection</b> process made {{the first day of the}} trial last fourteen hours, beginning at 9 a.m. and not ending until nearly midnight the same day; presiding judge Paul Carver noted that due to the notoriety of the case, he had been forced to choose between sequestering the entire jury pool overnight and forcing the court into a long day. The eventual jury, all men, were immediately sequestered, but days later, a mistrial was declared after it emerged that a law partner of prosecutor Lawrence Gepford had once been retained by one of the jurors.|$|E
5|$|Though {{charged with}} both the murders of Patricia Jones and James Kinne, Sharon Kinne was tried {{separately}} for the two crimes. Her trial {{for the murder of}} Patricia Jones began in mid-June 1961, with <b>jury</b> <b>selection</b> beginning on or about June 13 and the trial commencing days later with an all-male jury.|$|E
5|$|Despite {{the uproar}} over the poll tax {{as a factor}} in <b>jury</b> <b>selection,</b> the tax {{remained}} in Virginia until the ratification of the Twenty-fourth Amendment to the United States Constitution outlawed it in 1964. Pauli Murray was deeply affected by her experience working on the case and was inspired to pursue her career in civil rights law. Governor Darden, influenced by the popular sentiment that the case had evoked, began a reform of the Virginia penal system, including the creation of an official Pardon and Parole Board with the authority to commute sentences.|$|E

5|$|In United States v. Shackleford (1855), the Court {{held that}} the section 30's {{allocation}} of peremptory challenges controlled, rather than an 1840 statute that required federal <b>jury</b> <b>selection</b> to generally follow state law (and, thus, the prosecutor was given no peremptory challenges in such cases). Ten years later, Congress abrogated Shackleford, granting prosecutors five peremptory challenges in treason and capital cases (and two in non-capital felony cases); the 1865 act left the defendant's number of peremptory challenges unchanged.|$|E
5|$|The {{trial judge}} has an {{obligation}} to ensure an impartial jury, especially vis-a-vis juror biases and media coverage by such means as <b>jury</b> <b>selection</b> (including voir dire and for-cause challenges), jury sequestration, and jury instructions. For example, this may require the court to permit voir dire {{on the subject of the}} juror's potential racial prejudice. In some circumstances, the Sixth Amendment even requires the trial judge to grant a defendant's change of venue motion if an impartial jury cannot be obtained otherwise.|$|E
5|$|A jury {{consultant}} helped {{pick the}} jury in the O. J. Simpson murder trial. Criminologist Jo-Ellan Dimitrius used surveys to determine the ideal defense juror demographic (black women) and analyzed and judged the prospective jurors' answers to a questionnaire and response and body language during voir dire (the stage of <b>jury</b> <b>selection</b> where lawyers are permitted to directly question the jury). Prosecutor Vincent Bugliosi gives more credit to the traditional change of venue. He argues that transferring the case to a section of Los Angeles with more blacks in the jury pool was most detrimental to the selection of a prosecution-friendly jury. Incidentally, the prosecutor fired her court-appointed jury consultant early in the process.|$|E

5|$|Although {{advocates and}} {{practitioners}} of scientific <b>jury</b> <b>selection</b> claim {{the practice is}} overwhelmingly effective at choosing juries that will render the desired verdict, its true effect is often more difficult to discern. Part of this difficulty is in duplicating the conditions of a real trial. In one experiment, two kinds of shadow juries watched a trial and rendered a verdict. The {{results indicated that the}} juries were substantially different, but that this difference was likely due to the two experimental juries’ knowledge that they were not deciding an actual verdict, prompting a lower burden of proof.|$|E
5|$|During <b>jury</b> <b>selection</b> in the United States, {{attorneys}} have two options for excluding potential jurors. The first option {{is a challenge}} for cause, in which attorneys must state the reason for a challenge (such as clear bias or a conflict of interest), the opposing party is allowed to respond, and the judge decides whether to exclude the juror. The second option is a peremptory challenge, where an attorney can exclude a juror without stating any reason. While challenges for cause are unlimited, {{attorneys have}} {{a limited number of}} peremptory challenges, sometimes as few as four, although 10 is more common in non-capital felony cases.|$|E
5|$|His {{trial for}} {{obstruction}} of justice was to have begun on March 2, 2009, but <b>jury</b> <b>selection</b> was postponed by 11th-hour appeals by the prosecution. The trial commenced on March 21, 2011, in U. S. District Court, Northern District of California, with Judge Susan Illston presiding. He was convicted on April 13, 2011 on the {{obstruction of justice}} charge, for giving an evasive {{answer to a question}} under oath. His sentence did not include prison. The conviction was initially upheld by a three judge panel of the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit in 2013, but a larger panel of the court voted 10-1 to overturn the conviction on April 22, 2015.|$|E

5|$|Martin's death largely {{took the}} air out of the federal perjury case against Webber. In July 2003, on the day before <b>jury</b> <b>selection</b> in the case was due to begin, Webber pleaded guilty to the reduced charge of {{criminal}} contempt in order to avoid a possible jail sentence. He admitted to having received and repaid $38,200. The deal was subject to a discretionary fine and possible classification of the infraction as a felony by the United States District Court Judge Nancy Edmunds who would rule in September 2003. In exchange for the plea all other charges were dropped against him as were all charges against his father. The charges against Webber's aunt had been dropped after Martin's death.|$|E
5|$|On July 28, {{the trial}} {{began at the}} Fulton County Superior Court (old city hall building). The judge, Leonard S. Roan, had been serving as a judge in Georgia since 1900.

Frank was represented {{by a team of}} eight lawyersincluding <b>jury</b> <b>selection</b> specialistsled by Luther Rosser, Reuben Arnold, and Herbert Haas. In addition to the hundreds of spectators inside, a large crowd gathered outside to watch the trial through the windows.

On October 25 and 26, Halle Shilling and Christy Wiegand testified about being attacked by Guandique while independently jogging in Rock Creek Park. Wiegand recounted that Guandique grabbed her from behind, dragged her down a ravine and held a knife against her face.|$|E
