5000|$|The SGH-D900 {{suffers from}} a number of {{software}} quirks. The Java implementation does not allow applications to access the network without repeatedly asking the user for permission - there is no [...] "always allow" [...] option. The handset also lacks the ability to use imported files as an SMS alert tone, leaving only the small default selection of sounds available to the user. The camera features also have a number of quirks, such as the shutter sound preceding the actual image capture by approximately half a second (leading to blurred and poorly aimed images as the user moves the phone after the <b>expected</b> <b>exposure</b> duration has passed.) In addition the camera does not take a photo if you hold down the camera button - the user must press and release quickly. Photos cannot be saved directly to the memory card, and moving the photos already taken leads to duplicate file names. Also, only images in [...] "My Photos" [...] folder can be zoomed, so any imported images must be moved to that folder before they can be zoomed.|$|E

50|$|Another {{growing problem}} in Tanzania is the {{stems from the}} {{mismanagement}} of chemical resources. An increasing {{number of studies have}} been done on the levels of toxic substances in the soil, water systems, and atmosphere of the region. In several instances, these results detected high levels of contamination. For instance, one of Tanzania’s main exports is gold, the mining of which requires excess amounts of mercury. It has been estimated that approximately 1.32 kg of mercury is lost to the environment for every 1 kg of gold mined. However, the actual values are likely higher. The unregulated use of mercury in the mines has led to high quantities of the element being released into the atmosphere, exposing the miners to harmful toxins. In one case study, 150 miners, 103 fishermen and their families, and 19 civilians from Mwanza City in Tanzania were tested for mercury exposure. Using a mercury detector test, each subject’s hair was examined to detect traces of the chemical. Fourteen of the subjects had extremely high readings, the highest being 953 ppm. On average, the mercury level found in these 14 subjects was 48.3 ppm per person. Keeping this information in context, the value considered critical for Minamata disease is 50 ppm. The <b>expected</b> <b>exposure</b> level for a typical person is about 10 ppm. The remaining 258 participants had levels at roughly 10 ppm suggesting no increase in mercury exposure.|$|E

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{investigate}} the relationship between glove use and acute traumatic occupational hand injury. We used a case-crossover, within-subject study design to control for differences between individuals such as occupation, injury history, age, gender, risk-taking behavior, manual dexterity, and muscle strength. A total of 1166 hand-injured workers were interviewed regarding the use of gloves at the time of the injury. The self-reported average duration of glove use in the previous work month was the measure of <b>expected</b> <b>exposure</b> to wearing gloves. Nineteen percent of subjects reported wearing gloves at the time of the injury. The <b>expected</b> <b>exposure</b> to glove use in the past work month was 27. 9 %. Glove use was associated with a lower risk of lacerations and punctures but not crush, fractures, avulsions, amputations, dislocations; the risk of the former two injury types was estimated to be 60 – 70...|$|E
40|$|Aim To {{investigate}} {{the quality of}} periapical radiographic images produced by two digital dental radiography systems, a charge-coupled device (CCD) and a photostimulable phosphor (PSP) image plate system, and to examine the overall radiation exposure when using these systems in a clinical setting. Methodology Patients were randomly allocated to both systems and the resultant radiographs rated for quality. The <b>expected</b> radiation <b>exposure</b> for an investigation was calculated. Results Overall, 98 images were acquired using the CCD system and 108 with the PSP system. The PSP system produced significantly higher quality (P < 0. 001) periapical images compared with the CCD system. The CCD system required significantly more (P < 0. 001) repeat exposures to obtain a diagnostic image than the PSP system but at a lower <b>expected</b> radiation <b>exposure.</b> Conclusions The image quality was superior using the phosphor plate system. Although more repeat radiographs were required using the CCD system, the images were produced with a lower <b>expected</b> radiation <b>exposure...</b>|$|R
40|$|Lomibao and Zhu (2005) {{proposed}} a conditional valuation approach for valuing at future of path-dependent instruments. Since their approach simulates value at future (VaF) 1 instead of future mark-to-market value, it is inappropriate {{to use for}} potential exposure calculations other than <b>expected</b> <b>exposures.</b> In this article, we propose a new and simple methodology to simulate correctly the future mark-to-market value of path-dependent instruments. Our approach is therefore more appropirate to use for computing all potential exposure statistics, such as Peak Exposure and Maximum Peak Exposure. We also suggest a modified Lomibao-Zhu approach to improve their simulation algorithm. For the numerical example on an up-and-out call option, {{we find that the}} Lomibao-Zhu’s approach underestimates the lower quantiles and overestimates the upper quantiles of the future exposure profile...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{provides}} a numerically accurate and computationally fast approximation to {{the prices of}} European options on coupon-bearing instruments that is applicable to the entire family of affine term structure models. Exploiting the typical shapes of the conditional distributions of the risk factors in affine diffusions, we show that one can reliably compute the relevant probabilities needed for pricing options on coupon-bearing instruments by the same Fourier inversion methods used in the pricing of options on zero-coupon bonds. We apply our theoretical results to the pricing of options on coupon bonds and swaptions, and the calculation of "expected exposures" on swap books. As an empirical illustration, we compute the <b>expected</b> <b>exposures</b> implied by several affine term structure models fit to historical swap yields.

40|$|In this paper, we derive {{a forward}} {{analytical}} formula for computing the <b>expected</b> <b>exposure</b> of financial derivatives. Under general {{assumptions about the}} underlying diffusion process, we give a convenient decomposition of the exposure into two terms: The first term is an intrinsic value part which is directly deduced from the term structure of the forward mark-to-market. The second term expresses the variability of the future mark-to-market and represents the time value part. Abstract In the spirit of Dupire's equation for local volatility, our representation establishes a differential equation {{for the evolution of}} the <b>expected</b> <b>exposure</b> with respect to the observation dates. Our results are twofold: First, we derive analytically an integral formula for the exposure's expectation and we highlight straightforward links with local times and the co-area formula. Second, we show that from a numerical perspective, our solution can be significantly efficient when compared to standard numerical methods. The accuracy and time-efficiency of the forward representation are of special interest in benchmarking XVA valuation adjustments at the trade level...|$|E

30|$|When a NOAEL and its {{associated}} AUC from non-clinical EFD studies is available, a margin of at least 300 is requested relative to the <b>expected</b> <b>exposure</b> (AUC) in the female partner for small molecules and of at least 100 for mAbs. The smaller margin for mAbs appears justified because the exposure in the female partner is more predictable than for small molecules, given the more generalizable PK of mAbs. If the seminal concentration for a small molecule is not estimated, but has been measured, we propose to reduce the required safety margin from 300 to 100.|$|E

40|$|The {{electromagnetic}} field leakage levels of nonionizing radiation from {{a microwave oven}} have been estimated within a complex indoor scenario. By employing a hybrid simulation technique, based on coupling full wave simulation with an in-house developed deterministic 3 D ray launching code, estimations of the observed electric field values can be obtained for the complete indoor scenario. The microwave oven can be modeled as a time- and frequency-dependent radiating source, in which leakage, basically from the microwave oven door, is propagated along the complete indoor scenario interacting {{with all of the}} elements present in it. This method can be of aid in order {{to assess the impact of}} such devices on <b>expected</b> <b>exposure</b> levels, allowing adequate minimization strategies such as optimal location to be applied...|$|E

5|$|A {{percentage}} {{of each group}} working in less contaminated areas was badged. Eventually, 18,875 film-badge dosimeters were issued to about 15% of the total work force. On {{the basis of this}} sampling, a theoretical total exposure was calculated for each person who did not have a personal badge. As <b>expected,</b> <b>exposures</b> for target ship crewmen who reboarded their ships after Baker were higher than those for support ship crews. The hulls of support ships that entered the lagoon after Baker became so radioactive that sleeping quarters were moved toward the center of each ship. Of the total mass of radioactive particles scattered by each explosion, 85% was unfissioned plutonium which produces alpha radiation not detected by film badges or Geiger counters. There was no method of detecting plutonium in a timely fashion, and participants were not monitored for ingestion of it.|$|R

40|$|We {{have carried}} out a {{comprehensive}} analysis of all Betelgeuse calibration observations obtained to date with the HRC. Betelgeuse is undetected {{in all of the}} individual observations as well as cumulatively. We find that the <b>expected</b> <b>exposure</b> time for detection is> 1 Ms for aimpoint observations for both HRC-I and HRC-S, and therefore recommend discontinuing them. We also find that the predicted count rate due to the UV/optical flux is sufficient to have already resulted in a detection for observations carried out over the thin filter regions at large off-axis angles of the HRC-S. The non-detections therefore suggest that the out-of-band response must be decreased, by a factor < 0 : 3. We also recommend consolidating the observations over the outer wing plate into a single one at an off-axis angle of − 250. ...|$|E
40|$|We {{address the}} problem of allocating the counterparty-level credit {{valuation}} adjustment (CVA) to the individual trades composing the portfolio. We show that this problem can be reduced to calculating contributions of the trades to the counterparty-level <b>expected</b> <b>exposure</b> (EE) conditional on the counterparty's default. We propose a methodology for calculating conditional EE contributions for both collateralized and non-collateralized counterparties. Calculation of EE contributions can be easily incorporated into exposure simulation processes that already exist in a financial institution. We also derive closed-form expressions for EE contributions under the assumption that trade values are normally distributed. Analytical results are obtained for the case when the trade values and the counterparty's credit quality are independent as well as when there is a dependence between them (wrong-way risk).

30|$|LAs are not peer tutors and {{typically}} {{do not work}} one-on-one with students. They do not provide direct answers to questions or systematically work out problems with students. Instead, LAs facilitate discussion about conceptual problems among groups of students and they focus on eliciting student thinking and helping students make connections between concepts. This is typically done both in the larger lecture section of the course as well as smaller meetings after the weekly lectures, {{often referred to as}} recitation. LAs guide students in learning specific content, but also in developing and defending ideas—important skills for higher-order learning in general. The model for training LAs and the design of the LA program at large are aimed at making a difference in the ways students think and learn in college overall and not just in specific courses. That is, we <b>expect</b> <b>exposure</b> to the program to influence student success in college generally.|$|R

40|$|Active Pixel Sensor (APS) {{technology}} has shown promise for next-generation vertex detectors. This paper discusses {{the design and}} testing of two generations of APS chips. Both are arrays of 128 by 128 pixels, each 20 by 20 {micro}m. Each array is divided into sub-arrays in which different sensor structures (4 in the first version and 16 in the second) and/or readout circuits are employed. Measurements of several of these structures under Fe{sup 55 } exposure are reported. The sensors have also been irradiated by 55 MeV protons to test for radiation damage. The radiation increased the noise and reduced the signal. The noise {{can be explained by}} shot noise from the increased leakage current and the reduction in signal is due to charge being trapped in the epi layer. Nevertheless, the radiation effect is small for the <b>expected</b> <b>exposures</b> at RHIC and RHIC II. Finally, we describe our concept for mechanically supporting a thin silicon wafer in an actual detector...|$|R
30|$|In most cases, chemical-risk related {{policies}} {{are based on}} some form of risk assessment and prioritisation of individual chemical substances prior to their marketing and use, which then provides the basis for managing through labelling, restricting or banning {{the use of the}} most hazardous chemicals, preventing exposure or setting limit values for, e.g. contents in products or emissions to air and water. The procedures to identify which chemicals need to be restricted differ between legislative frameworks. Common principles include that they are based on utilising knowledge on their potential ecological or human health hazards, that the assessment is performed most often on single substances and that the final step is a combination of <b>expected</b> <b>exposure</b> and effects insights, with a political or administrative process where other priorities (e.g. socio economic or technical issues) may have an influence.|$|E
40|$|International audienceOBJECTIVE: We {{sought to}} study the {{association}} between occupational sun exposure and mycosis fungoides (MF), a peripheral T-cell lymphoma. SUBJECTS AND METHODS: A European multicenter case-control study including seven rare cases (one being MF) was conducted between 1995 and 1997. From the 118 accepted cases, 104 were interviewed, of which 76 were definite cases. Population controls were selected randomly from the regions of case ascertainment. Information based on occupational experiences was coded according to industry types. A job exposure matrix was created according to the <b>expected</b> <b>exposure</b> to sunlight. RESULTS: Once exposures to aromatic halogenated hydrocarbons were eliminated (odds ratio = 2. 3; 95 % confidence interval = 0. 9 - 6. 2), a high MF risk was associated with exposures to solar radiation. CONCLUSION: It would appear that workers exposed to sunlight have {{a higher risk of}} MF. However, this factor {{is not the only one}} involved...|$|E
40|$|An {{increasing}} number of studies shows that exposure to thin ideal bodies in the media has negative effects on young women's body images, {{at least in the}} short-term. However, this research has (a) consistently confounded the effects of thinness and attractiveness, and (b) not investigated the potential use of alternative images in advertising that do not decrease women's body esteem. This study examines the impact of three types of advertisements—featuring thin models, average-size models, or no models—on adult women's body-focused anxiety, and on advertising effectiveness. As <b>expected,</b> <b>exposure</b> to thin models resulted in greater body-focused anxiety among women who internalize the thin ideal than exposure to average-size models or no models. Yet, advertisements were equally effective, regardless of the model's size. This implies that advertisers can successfully use larger, but attractive, models and perhaps avoid increasing body-focused anxiety in a large proportion of women...|$|E
40|$|We discuss {{prospects}} for probing Z-prime and non-standard neutrino interactions using neutrino-nucleus coherent scattering with ultra-low energy (~ 10 eV) threshold Si and Ge detectors. The analysis is {{performed in the}} context of a specific and contemporary reactor-based experimental proposal, developed in cooperation with the Nuclear Science Center at Texas A&M University, and referencing available technology based upon economical and scalable detector arrays. For <b>expected</b> <b>exposures,</b> we show that sensitivity to the Z-prime mass is on the order of several TeV, and is complementary to the LHC search with low mass detectors in the near term. This technology is also shown to provide sensitivity to the neutrino magnetic moment, at a level that surpasses terrestrial limits, and is competitive with more stringent astrophysical bounds. We demonstrate the benefits of combining silicon and germanium detectors for distinguishing between classes of models of new physics, and for suppressing correlated systematic uncertainties.
