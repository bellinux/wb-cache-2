3000|$|... (1) The Person: A fictional {{older person}} named Bob lives alone. He has several {{close friends and}} a son who visits several times a month. Bob is a keen baker and has an {{interest}} in history and genealogy. Bob has mild memory issues and has difficulty reading small text and therefore wears glasses. (2) The Environment: Bob’s home, a single story dwelling has been fitted with several types of sensors including door contact sensors that are attached to the back, cupboard and <b>fridge</b> <b>doors</b> and these generate door opening and closing events. PIR sensors are located in the hall, kitchen, living room, WC, master and guest bedrooms and these generate ‘room visited events’. Bed-chair pressure sensors have been placed in Bob’s bed, generating bed-chair in and out events. These sensors are used together to detect changes of context in the environment. Touch screen interfaces are located in the kitchen and beside the bed {{in the living room and}} each touch screen has a microphone and speakers. (3) Issues (DAY): Due to several health issues Bob sleeps in a bed in the living room and does not sleep in the Master bedroom and on occasion Bob will have trouble waking and may spend most of the day in bed. During the course of a typical day, Bob may forget to close the back door and this can sometimes result in security issues occurring as in the past a stray dog has wandered in and made a mess of the kitchen. On occasion he will open <b>fridge</b> and cupboard <b>doors</b> and forget to close them, resulting in several food items spoiling and an increase in energy use. When Bob visits the downstairs WC, he sometimes forgets to flush the WC and wash his hands. Bob likes to keep in contact with his primary care contact on a Monday, Wednesday and Saturday so that they can arrange any activities and outline any issues that he is having. Bob may forget to eat regular meals during the day and this has led to increased weight loss. (4) Issues (NIGHT) Bob often goes to bed at 10 : 00  pm and during the night he usually has several restless periods were he moves about a lot in the bed. In the early hours of the morning he may sit up in bed and feel disorientated and distressed. If Bob gets up and leaves the bed, he will go to the kitchen. While Bob is in the kitchen he will sit for a long period of time and drink cups of tea. When Bob eventually returns to the bedroom and goes back to bed he will often awake again after a short period of time and have to get out of bed and go to the downstairs WC.|$|R

However, the commonly used deconvolutional layers for upsampling intermediate representations to the full-resolution output still show different failure modes, like imprecise segmentation boundaries and label mistakes in particular on large, weakly textured objects (e. g. <b>fridge,</b> whiteboard, <b>door).</b> We attribute these errors {{in part to}} the rigid way, current network aggregate information, that can be either too local (missing context) or too global (inaccurate boundaries). Therefore we propose a data-driven pooling layer that integrates with fully convolutional architectures and utilizes boundary detection from RGBD image segmentation approaches. We extend our approach to leverage region-level correspondences across images with an additional temporal pooling stage. We evaluate our approach on the NYU-Depth-V 2 dataset comprised of indoor RGBD video sequences and compare it to various state-of-the-art baselines. Besides a general improvement over the state-of-the-art, our approach shows particularly good results in terms of accuracy of the predicted boundaries and in segmenting previously problematic classes...|$|R
40|$|This essay {{presents}} a study into {{the domain of}} architecture meeting new interaction design principles. The paper discusses future transparent surfaces to become programmable kinetic user interfaces, usable as information and communication channels to simplify our everyday environment. Based on the approach of using the five methodologies: Cultural Probes, Research Through Design, Grounded Theory, Star Life Cycle Model and Wizard of Oz; consistent data was collected to design and iterate on a visionary interface prototype to bridge the use of freehand gestures through motion sensing and moreover supported by RFID in a building structure on a see-through background. The objective {{of this paper is}} to unravel the main research question of how can people through kinetic interaction use organic interfaces on transparent surfaces? Several possible uses were ideated such as multiple shared user access, collaborative interaction on both sides. The primary research was answered through a final presented prototype combining a CV system with RFID for multiple and collaborative usages. User experiences and feedback makes an array of applications possible how a transparent interfaces with kinetic interaction can be applied to the interior and exterior such as <b>fridge,</b> mirror, <b>doors,</b> glass panels, alarm systems, games and the home entertainment. In today’s norm screens in the shape of a square are obsolete and support of new patterns, forms and materials are needed. Fieldwork concluded that kinetic interaction could flawlessly unite real world conditions with computer-generated substance, and become the design environment for future interactions to communicate with the user. We no longer seek to be bound to stiff shaped Graphical User Interfaces. Adding a transparent surface as background for such kinetic motion is underlying paradigm for the content to be projected into any ambience and surroundings...|$|R
30|$|ALLFI offers {{flexible}} assistance strategies {{through a}} context aware interface in an AAL environment. The flexibility {{is made possible}} through the use different interaction technologies including touch screen, speech recognition and synthesised speech. The older person is able to choose the interaction technology by setting their individual interaction requirements and therefore personalise their interaction experience and how they receive assistance. These requirements may be updated at any time by the older person or their care provider so that future changing interaction requirements may be accounted for. To achieve interaction flexibility, AALFI is controlled and updated by a MAS that displays context aware attributes; sensor event data from sensors placed in the AAL environment is consumed to determine what has occurred and to choose the appropriate assistance. It is this consumption of sensor data that {{is key to the}} correct assistance being offered to the older person. Context awareness is an important and essential characteristic of the MAS. Context awareness in relation to a MAS is illustrated by [15] and MAS systems are shown to exhibit context aware attributes by [16] as they are able to decipher contextual changes that occur in an AAL environment. Without these context aware attributes and characteristics, the correct assistance would not be offered and AALFI {{would not be able to}} provide flexible assistance in relation to different situations that occur in the environment ranging from safety issues such as leaving cupboard, <b>fridge,</b> or back <b>doors</b> open to health issues such as not getting enough sleep, reminding a person to consume regular meals and offering advice based assistance at key times during the day.|$|R
5000|$|Converged Identities:An {{operational}} issue emerges with 3G IMS and SIP and converged services.

This flexibility means that a SIP call can be made from just about anything to any other thing providing it is entitled to do so. As SIP can apply a mixture of these Internet and Telephone system identifiers in the call process, it follows that the SDP must tightly couple its SIP processing with the DHCP/DNS system, the HSS mobile database, the User authorization system, the presence event system, the user's address book, telephone call feature processing and the operator's service/product management with its entitlement system - all in real time.

5000|$|Roberta [...] "Bobby" [...] Marshall (née Simpson; {{previously}} Morgan) is {{a fictional}} character from the Australian Channel Seven soap opera Home and Away, played by Nicolle Dickson. She {{was introduced in}} the pilot episode by executive producer Alan Bateman. Nearly four hundred actresses auditioned to play Bobby, with Dickson taking the role. Bobby is described as a trouble-making teen who is rebellious and a loner. Bobby became a popular character because of her confronting attitude. Bobby's story lines have focused on finding her biological parents, her feud with Roo Stewart, adoption and her marriage to foster brother Frank Morgan. Bobby's marriage to Frank was only implemented when script writers were sure viewers approved of it. At certain points in Bobby's duration, Dickson disapproved of her actions, for instance she became frustrated with her because she decided to find her biological parents without thinking about her foster parents' feelings. Dickson decided to leave the serial in 1993, and the character was subsequently killed off in a boat accident. In 1995 Dickson made a cameo appearance when Ailsa Stewart has hallucinations of Bobby in her <b>fridge</b> <b>door.</b> Dickson has received a Logie Award for her portrayal of Bobby and she has been referred to as a [...] "Summer Bay icon".|$|E
40|$|One {{consequence}} of current technological advances {{is that we}} can imbue everyday objects such as our <b>fridges,</b> ovens, fires, <b>doors,</b> thermostats, tvs and stereos with processing power. Not only will this enable them to make decisions based on their current state and model of the world about their current behaviour (the oven may automatically turn itself off when there is an excess of smoke) it will also allow communication with others to make decisions (the fridge may choose to defrost some vegetables when the phone communicates that there is a recent message from a friend who is, unexpectedly, intending to show for some dinner). This leads to the notion of Ambient Intelligence where intelligent computational entities are interwoven into the very fabric of our lives. We envisage a scenario where music devices can not only make intelligent, sympathetic decisions about sound generation in order to satiate the particular sound requirements of a user, but would also interact with other devices both musical and otherwise in a massively dynamic and unpredictable environment. We also envisage {{that there will be a}} massive shift in the pattern of behaviour relating to music consumption; a move from the passive consumer to the active creator. The emerging field of computer science which is concerned with building systems which are inherently distributed, dynamic, open and social in this sense is know as intelligent agents.

40|$|Abstract- Nowadays {{the people}} are very busy in their work schedule. Because of this they are {{careless}} while handling their home appliances. They consume so much amount of power due to their careless. In refrigerator also people consume (waste energy) more power due to their carelessness while handling it. This paper deals with reducing the power consumption in refrigerator. This paper comes under the domain of embedded system and wireless sensor network. The aim {{of this paper is}} to reduce the power consumption and to control the global warming. Presently, refrigerator ranks second in the overall power consumption (13. 7 %). The modern energy efficient model uses only 350 kWh. It can save up to $ 158 a year in electricity costs. If the <b>fridge</b> <b>door</b> opens for a long time, it absorbs heat from outside thus increasing the power consumption. The global warming is one of the major concerns for the world. The refrigerator is one of the major causes for global warming because it also releases Chloro-fluoro carbon in the atmosphere. Often opening and closing the door will release more amount of Chloro-fluoro carbon. This project is going to give the solutions for the above problems. The sensor signal is used to trace the object in the device space. If there is no change in the signal flow, then the door will close automatically. The modification in the circuit & the microcontroller chips are performing their operation in the new version. Thus by using this project we can save the power and control the global warming...|$|E
40|$|At {{the end of}} {{the episode}} “Crowd Pleasers,” from her {{television}} series Nigella Feasts, we see British food writer and television cook Nigella Lawson in her nightgown opening her fridge in the dark. The fridge light reveals the remnant dishes of chili con carne that she prepared earlier on in the programme. She scoops up a dollop of soured cream and chili onto a spoon and shovels it into her mouth, nods approvingly and then picks up the entire chili dish. She eats another mouthful, utters a satisfied “umm” sound, closes the <b>fridge</b> <b>door</b> and walks away, taking the dish of chili with her. This recurring scenario at the end of Nigella’s programmes is paradoxically constructed as a private moment to be witnessed by many viewers. It resembles acts of secret eating, personal food habits and offers a glimpse of the performed self, adding to Nigella’s persona. Throughout Nigella’s programmes there is a conscious tension between the private and public. This tension is confounded by Nigella’s acknowledgement of, and direct address to, the viewers, characterised by the knowing look she gives to the camera when she tastes her food, licks her fingers as she cooks, or reveals her secret chocolate stash in her store cupboard; the overt performance of supposedly surreptitious gestures. Through her look-back at the camera Nigella performs both sin and confession, communicating her guilty-pleasure as she self-consciously reveals this pleasure to the viewers. At the start of her performance Table Occasions (2000), solo artist Bobby Baker explains that there are strict rules that she must follow, the most important being that she must not walk on the floor. Baker then hosts a dinner party (for imaginary guests), balancing on top of the table and chairs wearing high-heeled shoes. When the ‘meal’ is finished Baker breaks her rule; she gets down from the table and walks freely across the performance space, giving the audience a knowing look of mock-surprise, as if everyone was seduced into believing in the compulsory nature of her rule (Table Occasions). In this performance Baker confesses her anxiety and discomfort in the act of playing the host. By breaking rules of common etiquette as well as her own abstract rules, she performatively constructs her “sins” and her “confessions. ” Baker’s look-back at the audience reveals her self-conscious “confessing self. ...|$|E
40|$|The current {{article is}} based on {{material}} from the file of conundrums of the Estonian Literature Museum's archive, containing approximately 20 000 texts and 1500 types. The material has been stored by the archive since {{the second half of the}} 19 th century. Conondrums are quizzes of a relatively certain form (ie. a certain starting formula - an interrogative noun or expression). (For instance How do you understand there is an elephant in the fridge? There are slippers behind the <b>fridge</b> <b>door.)</b> The aim of asking these questions is to make the other a fool and pull his nose, as well as being entertaining. The neccessity to treat conundrums in a separate study has come forth in present day as the classical quizzes are less known, while its successros - conundrums, word games, puzzles, etc. - are becoming more popular. Currently the oldest known traditional conundrum originates from the third volume of Rosenplänter's "Beiträge" in 1814. The term conundrums originates probably in M. J. Eisen's 1914 book of puzzles "Mõista, mõista, mis see on [...] . " ("Guess, Guess What, This Is [...] . «), where the author names conundrums and word games under the name difficult questions. Throughout history, conundrums have been called with very different names: puzzles, short questions, funny questions, intersting questions, questions by the Armenian radio, joke questions, tricky questions, contemporary puzzles, legpulling questions. The three more important steps in treating conundrums are: 1. Mattias Johann Eisen discriminates them with a special term difficult questions (Eisen 1914, p 19); 2. Vaina Mälk (Mälk 1959, p 449) and Eduard Laugaste (Laugaste 1975, pp 291) discriminate them as a subtype of puzzles on the theoretical level; 3. Arvo Krikmann in his lecture material treats conundrums as a peripheral part of puzzles (Krikmann 1993, p 3). Currently, puzzles are treated as a separate genre with some certain characteristics ad teh subgenres of real puzzle, conundrum, etc. The problems are, that 1) the term puzzle has gained two meanings, where the general term has remained puzzle and puzzle in the classical sense is called now simple, classical or real puzzle; 2) conundrums, which used to be in the periphery, has reached the central with the developnt of folklore. (While in the Hurt collection, in the material from the end of the last century, there are only a few conundrums, then the 1992 schoollore competition resulted in only a few classical puzzles. Thus the problem: are conundrums a subtype of puzzles or something entirely different? Contemporary Estonian folklore treats conundrums as a subtype of puzzles. Probably it is not impossible that it will soon be treated as a separate genre...|$|E
40|$|Australia {{is set to}} be the world’s most {{connected}} continent following {{the completion of the}} NBN rollout in 2020, according to new research released today. Developed by Western Sydney University, this report provides an in-depth analysis into how advancements in technology and nationwide access to fast broadband will transform all aspects of the Australian way of life. It predicts ‘gen nbn™’, Australia’s newest and most connected generation, will benefit from better business opportunities and flexible-working arrangements as well as access to leading education and healthcare services.  The report predicts: 	The internet of everything – Increased connectivity and digital innovation is rapidly penetrating every facet of day-to-day life. By 2020, technologies such as drones, 3 D printers, Virtual and Augmented Reality as well as home automation will become deeply entrenched in homes and workplaces. These technologies will help transform our lives and enable better connectivity with family and friends as well as provide access to a range of new entertainment options. By 2025 - 2030, there are likely to be well over 50 billion devices or apps connecting everything from our <b>fridge</b> <b>door</b> to our home security systems, which will be enabled to run concurrently over the nbn™ network. 	Rapid growth in medical innovations – Digital technology in health care is increasing exponentially with the advent of big data, advanced video conferencing systems and 3 D printing. By 2020, telehealth services, enabled by the nbn™ network will be able to connect regional, rural and remote areas with access to affordable and convenient GP and specialist healthcare appointments, saving up to $ 3 billion in annual health costs. By 2025, {{it may be possible to}} use big data to predict widespread disease outbreaks and by 2030 we are likely to see 3 D printing drastically enhance the ability to produce medical aids and prosthetics. 	E-change movement will continue – Access to fast broadband in regional towns and rapid adoption of teleworking is leading people to migrate away from the major cities to regional hotspots. From now to 2030, the nbn™ network will be a critical enabler to the success of home-grown start-ups across the country and will help to facilitate access to new markets and business opportunities while still enjoying their country or coastside lifestyles. Close to 400, 00 Australians workforce currently work from home; as fast broadband becomes more widespread, these figures could as much as double by 2025. 	Jobs of the future – Connectivity is driving innovation in Science, Technology, Engineering, Arts and Maths (STEAM) disciplines spurring a transformation of the Australian job market. Health, education and technical services are expected to employ over 4. 3 million Australians by 2030, up from the current 3. 5 million jobs. From now until 2030, we will see a huge increase in online educational resources and services offering better teaching facilities to upskill our nation in key areas such as health and technical services, to harness careers in data science, coding and bio-chemistry...|$|E
