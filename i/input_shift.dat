40|$|It is {{well known}} that in a {{hydraulic}} servomechanism the ram exhibits in the open-loop a linear motion in addition to its usual oscillatory motion for a sinusoidal input. This phenomenon, called drift, gives rise to an apparent instability of the system and the study of the dynamic behaviour becomes difficult. A theoretical investigation into the causes and remedy of this phenomenon is made on a loaded system with an asymmetric linear hydraulic motor controlled by an open-centre three-way spool valve. The original non-linear system equation in dimensionless form is derived taking into account the effects of leakage, compressibility (both fixed and varying) and area ratio, and solved numerically by the fourth-order Runge-Kutta method. It is shown that the determination of the reverse flow boundary is essential prior to the study of drijt, since the rate of drift will be maximum near the boundary frequency. I t is also shown that while the effect of compressibility due to the change in initial volume is mainly responsible for driji for an area ratio of I: 2, the effect of area ratio itself is predominant for an area ratio not equal to I: 2. I t is observed that in most of the cases the drift can be removed by giving a proper <b>input</b> <b>shift</b> to the valve.

40|$|Abstract: Iterative {{learning}} control (ILC) {{is a technique}} to realize system inversion in a run-to-run manner. Though most of the techniques presented in the literature consider zero tracking error between the desired and achieved outputs, perfect inversion is often not feasible {{and in many cases}} not even desirable. Approximate inversion with good convergence and robustness properties (at the cost of a nonzero tracking error) has been proposed by using a forgetting factor on the input of the previous run. In this paper, approximate inversion is achieved by shifting the input of the previous run backwards in time. In addition, anticipatory ILC and current cycle feedback are used. The advantage of <b>input</b> <b>shift</b> over the use of a forgetting factor is that, when the reference trajectory is constant and the system stable, the tracking error decreases with run time. The proposed scheme is illustrated in simulation on a batch distillation system...|$|E

40|$|Abstract: A high frequency, {{low power}} 1 : 16 {{deserializer}} {{has been developed}} using the 0. 25 µm BiCMOS SiGe technology from ST Microelectronics to meet the ALMA project requirements. The <b>input</b> <b>shift</b> register is clocked at 4 GHz and the output data are transferred at 250 MHz. Nominal operation has been observed up to 8 GHz. With 2. 5 V supply, the circuit dissipates around 650 mW an especially low value compared to existing similar circuits. The chip is available in an industrial package and exhibits low thermal resistance (about 25 °C/W) thus implying long lifetime as required for the ALMA project. Functional tests including those performed with a self-test block embedded in the deserializer are briefly described. Our deserializer is integrated in a prototype ALMA Digitizer assembly which includes a 3 -bit (8 -level), 4 GS/s sampler developed with the same SiGe process. Based on Digitizer state counts measurements, Allan variance tests and long term operation in the laboratory environment, we conclude that the prototype Digitizer assembly is operational.

The root cause of the failure must be initially narrowed down to the failing vectors and also the scan cells at which mismatches occurred. In this work, we propose a method for accurately determining the first cycle at which incorrect responses were captured in the scan chains along with the scan cells that captured the incorrect responses. We define a diagnosis methodology that describes a simple way of diagnosing one chain at a time and further shows that accurate diagnosis is possible with the aliasing nature of the MISR having no impact on diagnosis. The proposed technique results in identifying the failing vectors along with the mismatching scan cells. After determining the failing vectors and mismatching scan cells, we extend the method to identify potential faults in the circuit that may have resulted in the scan cells capturing incorrect responses. The method presented in this paper can be applied to diagnose multiple failing vectors also. ...|$|E

40|$|The {{abundance}} {{and composition of}} total organic carbon, aliphatic and aromatic hydrocarbons including biomarkers, and the δ¹³C composition of total organic matter and individual compounds in core samples of the Nenjiang Formation from the SK- 1 borehole of the Songliao Basin provide information on the paleoenvironmental conditions of lacustrine sediments formed during the Upper Cretaceous. The distribution of n-alkanes, and their δ¹³C composition, and 4 -methylsteranes and dinosteranes in {{the first member of}} the Nenjiang Formation (K₂n¹) indicate that the organic matter largely originated from algal organisms and is dominated by types I and II kerogen. The occurrence of gammacerane, aryl isoprenoids isorenieratane and low pristane/phytane and diasterane/sterane ratios further suggest a salinity stratified water column associated with anoxic bottom waters, as well as possible photic zone oxygen depletion conditions during major source rock deposition of the K₂n¹. The organic geochemical data also indicate significantly different depositional environments for the second member of the Nenjiang Formation (K₂n²) sediments, which are interpreted to have been deposited under a uniform salinity (non-stratified) oxic water column. Consequently, although the organic matter in the K₂n² sediments was largely derived from algal and bacterial sources, the kerogen types are dominantly IIb and III due to the oxidative degradation of organic matter, combined with a gradual increase in land-plant input. Furthermore, the occurrence and shift of two saw-toothed distribution patterns of the δ¹³C composition of C₂₉ to C₃₃ n-alkanes, with "W" and "M" patterns being isotopically heavy odd- and even-numbered alkanes, respectively, is suggestive of organic <b>input</b> <b>shift</b> or an unknown mechanism of carbon uptake or isotopic fractionation.
