25|$|White Americans {{have the}} second highest median {{household}} income and personal income levels in the nation, by cultural background. The median income per <b>household</b> <b>member</b> was also the highest, since White Americans had the smallest households of any racial demographic in the nation. In 2006, the median individual income of a White American age 25 or older was $33,030, with those who were full-time employed, and of age 25 to 64, earning $34,432. Since 42% of all households had two income earners, the median household income was considerably higher than the median personal income, which was $48,554 in 2005. Jewish Americans rank first in household income, personal income, and educational attainment among White Americans. In 2005, White households had a median household income of $48,977, which is 10.3% above the national median of $44,389. Among Cuban Americans, with 86% classifying as White, those persons born in the US have a higher median income and educational attainment level than most other Whites.|$|E

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to {{determine}} the long-term carriage rates and transmission dynamics of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) in pig farmers and their <b>household</b> <b>members.</b> During a 6 -month period in 2009 - 2010, 4 pig farms in Denmark, Belgium, and the Netherlands, respectively, were studied for the presence of MRSA. The proportion of persistent carriers was significantly higher among farmers than among <b>household</b> <b>members</b> (87 % vs. 11 %) and significantly higher in <b>household</b> <b>members</b> from Belgium compared to those from Denmark and the Netherlands (29 % vs. 0 % vs. 6 %). Determinant analysis of MRSA carriage revealed that pig contact was the most important determinant for MRSA carriage among <b>household</b> <b>members</b> and that the increased MRSA carriage rate observed among <b>household</b> <b>members</b> from Belgium is linked to country-specific differences in pig exposure. These findings demonstrated that even in pig farms with very high carriage rates of MRSA both in livestock and farmers, the risk for <b>household</b> <b>members</b> to acquire MRSA is limited and still depends strongly on pig exposure. By restricting access to the stables and exposure to pigs, MRSA acquisition by <b>household</b> <b>members</b> could be greatly reduced. Journal ArticleResearch Support, Non-U. S.

25|$|Scabies may be {{diagnosed}} clinically in geographical areas {{where it is}} common when diffuse itching presents along with either lesions in two typical spots or itchiness is present in another <b>household</b> <b>member.</b> The classical sign of scabies is the burrow made by a mite within the skin. To detect the burrow, the suspected area is rubbed with ink from a fountain pen or a topical tetracycline solution, which glows under a special light. The skin is then wiped with an alcohol pad. If the person is infected with scabies, the characteristic zigzag or S pattern of the burrow will appear across the skin; however, interpreting this test may be difficult, as the burrows are scarce and may be obscured by scratch marks. A definitive diagnosis is made by finding either the scabies mites or their eggs and fecal pellets. Searches for these signs involve either scraping a suspected area, mounting the sample in potassium hydroxide and examining it under a microscope, or using dermoscopy to examine the skin directly.|$|E

To investigate the household transmission pattern of infectious illness and etiology, we thus initiated a prospective case and household study. Methods: We enrolled KD cases and their <b>household</b> <b>members</b> from February 2004 to September 2008. The KD cases and their <b>household</b> <b>members</b> accepted questionnaire-based interviews of the contact history, signs of infection, and symptoms to check whether clusters of infectious illness occurred. Results: A total of 142  KD cases and 561 <b>household</b> <b>members</b> were enrolled. Among the 142  KD cases, 136 cases (96 %) were typical KD, and six (4 %) were atypical KD. Of the 561 <b>household</b> <b>members,</b> 17 % were siblings, 46 % were parents, 18 % were grandparents, and the others were cousins or babysitters. Prior to the onset of their KD illness, 66 % (94 / 142) KD cases had contact with ill <b>household</b> <b>members.</b> On the same day of the onset of KD cases' illness, 4 % (6 / 142) KD cases had <b>household</b> <b>members</b> with illness.
