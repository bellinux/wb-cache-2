25|$|For the {{remainder}} of 2002, Austin kept a low profile and did not make any public appearances. It was reported, however, {{by the end of}} the year, Austin and McMahon met and resolved their differences. He then agreed to return to the company in early 2003. In an interview with WWE Raw Magazine, he announced deep regret over the situation that led to his departure and the way in which he had left, and deeper regret over inaccurate speculation regarding his alleged grudges held against other WWE wrestlers, claiming he had no problem with Scott Hall rejoining the company. However, he admitted he still held strong reservations about <b>his</b> <b>singles</b> <b>match</b> with Hall at WrestleMania only lasting seven minutes and felt the build-up to the match did not live up to his or Hall's fans expectations, and was angered by speculation suggesting he disagreed with Kevin Nash re-joining the company, insisting he and Nash have always been good friends. In an interview with Vince McMahon on his podcast in 2014, Austin revealed for the first time that McMahon had fined him $650,000 upon his return, but he was able to lower the amount to $250,000.|$|E

25|$|Roddick's reign at No. 1 {{ended the}} {{following}} February, when Roger Federer ascended {{to the top}} position, after winning his first Australian Open; the 2004 Australian Open {{would be the only}} time in Roddick's career that he was the No. 1 seed in a Grand Slam. In April, Roddick again beat world No. 6 Moyá. In June, Roddick advanced to his first Wimbledon final, and after taking the first set from defending champion Federer, lost in four sets. Roddick was knocked out during the 2004 US Open in a five-set quarterfinal against another big server, Joachim Johansson. Later in September in Bangkok, he beat world No. 9 Marat Safin of Russia. At the 2004 Summer Olympics, Roddick lost to Chilean Fernando González, the eventual bronze medal winner, in the third round. In November he beat world No. 7 Tim Henman of Great Britain, world No. 4 Safin, and world No. 6 Guillermo Coria.

Roddick lost <b>his</b> <b>singles</b> <b>match</b> against Rafael Nadal, who would in the following year win the French Open. Towards the end of 2004, Roddick fired his coach of 18 months, Brad Gilbert, and hired assistant Davis Cup coach Dean Goldfine. Roddick finished 2004 ranked as the world No. 2, the U.S. No. 1, and the player with the most aces (2,017). In 2004, Roddick saved fellow tennis player Sjeng Schalken and other guests (including close friends Ben Campezi and Dean Monroe) from a hotel fire.|$|E
25|$|At the World Cup of Darts, Van Barneveld and Van Gerwen {{produced}} a sensational 117.88 average in their doubles decider against Northern Ireland to whitewash them 4–0 and meet England's Taylor and Lewis in the final. Van Gerwen defeated Taylor 4–0 and Van Barneveld recorded the same scoreline against Lewis. Van Gerwen went into <b>his</b> <b>singles</b> <b>match</b> versus Lewis knowing a win would earn the Dutch pair {{the title and}} he did so with a 4–2 success. Early on in his second round match against Mervyn King at the World Grand Prix, Van Barneveld was visibly struggling with a back problem but battled to trail 2–1 in sets. However, in the fourth set he missed 30 starting doubles and began throwing at the bullseye. King duly won the match, with Van Barneveld issuing an apology to the PDC and the television viewers for giving up. At the next major event, the European Championship, Van Barneveld wore glasses during a match {{for the first time}} in his career and explained after his 6–4 first round win over Simon Whitlock that his diabetes can occasionally blur his vision. He won through to the semi-finals, but was beaten 11–6 by Van Gerwen who threw a nine darter during the game. The pair also met in the next televised event the Masters, in a first round match which went to a deciding leg with Van Gerwen leaving 32 after nine darts and edging Van Barneveld 10–9. He lost to newcomer Keegan Brown 10–7 in the last 16 of the Grand Slam and was drawn to face Van Gerwen in the first round again this time at the Players Championship Finals where he was defeated 6–2.|$|E
25|$|Hoad, seeded {{first among}} the foreign players at the U.S. Championships, failed {{to live up}} to his seeding when he lost to Ham Richardson in a five-set quarterfinal. His lackluster form {{continued}} when he was defeated by unseeded Luis Ayala in the quarterfinal of the Pacific Southwest Championships in mid-September. After returning to Australia at the end of September Hoad scheduled extra practice to work on his serve and volley but subsequently lost to Don Candy in the semifinal of the Sydney Metropolitan Championships. In early November matters briefly improved as he consolidated the Queensland title in Brisbane. In the final he overcame a sunstroke and the loss of sets three and four by 0–6 to defeat Hartwig in five sets. In mid November he was upset by veteran John Bromwich who better exploited the windy conditions in the quarterfinal of the N.S.W. Championships. At the Victorian Championships, the last significant tournament before the Davis Cup Challenge Round, Hoad was defeated in straight sets in the semifinal by Seixas. As in the previous match against Sven Davidson he showed such poor form and at times an apparent lack of interest that he was jeered by the crowd and several left after he smashed a ball into the stands. The 1954 Davis Cup Challenge Round was played on 27–29 December on the grass courts at the White City Stadium in Sydney between title holders Australia and the United States. Hoad played the first rubber, in front of a record crowd of 25,000, which he lost to world No.1 Trabert in a high-quality four-set match. Rosewall also lost <b>his</b> <b>singles</b> <b>match</b> and the United States won back the cup after Seixas and Trabert defeated Hoad and Rosewall in four sets in the doubles rubber. At the end of an erratic and ultimately disappointing season Hoad's world ranking slipped to No.7. In a 1956 interview Hoad admitted that especially in 1954 he often got fed-up with tennis and didn't care whether he played or not.|$|E
50|$|The 23-year-old {{reached a}} career-high ranking of 149, {{becoming}} British No 2, and consequently Evans was picked as Britain's second singles {{player in the}} Davis Cup World Group play-off against Croatia in Umag on clay. Evans lost <b>his</b> Friday's <b>singles</b> <b>match</b> against Croatia's No 1 Ivan Dodig, ranked 35, but Andy Murray, playing in his first Davis Cup tie for two years, won both <b>his</b> <b>singles</b> <b>matches</b> and the doubles with Colin Fleming.|$|R
50|$|In 1931 the VFL {{appointed}} one field umpire to each senior match as {{a boundary}} umpire {{in case the}} appointed field umpire became incapacitated.

500|$|The 1981 {{match was}} {{originally}} {{scheduled to take}} place at The Belfry, but construction of the course was not completed on time and Walton Heath Golf Club was used instead. The United States, containing a team that had won 36 major championships between them, dominated the match winning 18½–9½. The 1983 match at PGA National Golf Club was the closest in recent years. After {{the first two days}} the match was tied at 8–8. Europe fell short in the singles match, winning four out of the twelve matches and lost the contest 14½–13½. The 1985 match held at the now completed Belfry, saw Europe win the trophy {{for the first time in}} 28 years. Leading 9–7 going into the final day, they won six singles matches to secure a 16½–11½ victory. Europe retained the Ryder Cup in 1987, beating the United States 15–13 at Muirfield Village, to win in the United States for the first time. The 1989 match was only the second time the contest ended in a tie. Europe were in commanding position when José Maria Cañizares won <b>his</b> <b>singles</b> <b>match,</b> but defeat in the last four matches meant the match finished 14–14. The 1991 match at Kiawah Island Golf Resort, known as the [...] "War on the Shore", saw the United States regain the Cup. The scores were tied at 8–8 going into the final day and the match came down to the last singles match between Europe's Bernhard Langer and American golfer Hale Irwin. Langer missed a [...] putt at the last hole, which meant the United States won 14½–13½. The United States retained the Cup in 1993, winning 15–13 at The Belfry. Europe regained the trophy in 1995, defeating the United States 14½–13½ at Oak Hill Country Club.|$|E
2500|$|Despite his {{outstanding}} {{success on}} the PGA Tour, Woods had little success in the Ryder Cup early in his career. In his first Ryder Cup in 1997, he earned only 1½ points competing in every match and partnering mostly with Mark O'Meara. Costantino Rocca defeated Woods in <b>his</b> <b>singles</b> <b>match.</b> In 1999, he earned 2 points over every match {{with a variety of}} partners. In 2002, he lost both Friday matches, but, partnered with Davis Love III for both of Saturday's matches, won two points for the Americans, and was slated to anchor the Americans for the singles matches, both squads going into Sunday with 8 points. However, after the Europeans took an early lead, his match with Jesper Parnevik was rendered unimportant and they halved the match. In 2004, he was paired with Phil Mickelson on Friday but lost both matches, and only earned one point on Saturday. With the Americans facing a 5–11 deficit, he won the first singles match, but the team was not able to rally. In 2006, he was paired with Jim Furyk for all of the pairs matches, and they won two of their four matches. Woods won <b>his</b> <b>singles</b> <b>match,</b> one of only three Americans to do so that day. Woods missed the 2008 Ryder Cup competition altogether, as he was recovering from reconstructive surgery on his left knee. Despite Woods' absence, the United States team posted its largest margin of victory in the event since 1981. In 2010, Woods had a successful Ryder Cup going 3-1-0. He played all team matches with Steve Stricker and defeated Francesco Molinari 4&3 in <b>his</b> <b>singles</b> <b>match</b> where he made 9 birdies. However, Europe won in a very close match, 14.5 to 13.5. In 2012, paired again with Stricker, both players struggled going 0-3-0 together for the week. For {{the first time in his}} career, Woods would sit out a session in the Ryder Cup. Himself and Stricker were the only Americans who did not have a point going into the Sunday singles. In <b>his</b> <b>singles</b> <b>match</b> against Francesco Molinari, Woods was 1 up on the 18th fairway. After seeing Martin Kaymer clinch the Ryder Cup for Europe, Woods conceded the hole after missing his par putt. He would halve the match giving Europe the outright victory, and finish his week at 0-3-1.|$|E
2500|$|Kaymer {{struggled}} {{for most of}} the 2012 season dropping to 32nd in the world golf rankings. [...] Kaymer had only 6 top tens with no worldwide victories. During the 2012 Ryder Cup, European Captain Jose Maria Olazabal played the struggling Kaymer in only one team match before the Sunday singles matches. The European team completed a historic comeback from 10-6 down {{at the start of the}} final day. Kaymer won <b>his</b> <b>singles</b> <b>match</b> of the Ryder Cup against Steve Stricker by one hole. His putt on the 18th retained the cup for Europe and completed the historic comeback.|$|E
