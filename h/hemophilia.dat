5|$|Symptomatic {{carriers}} of the gene, while not hemophiliacs themselves, can have symptoms of <b>hemophilia</b> including a {{lower than normal}} blood clotting factor {{that can lead to}} heavy bleeding. DNA testing on the remains of the royal family proved conclusively in 2009 that Alexei suffered from <b>Hemophilia</b> B, a rarer form of the disease. His mother and one sister, identified alternatively as Maria or Anastasia, were carriers. Therefore, had Anastasia lived to have children of her own, they may have been afflicted by the disease as well. Alexei's <b>hemophilia</b> was chronic and incurable; his frequent attacks caused permanent disability.|$|E
5|$|Maria, {{like her}} mother, was likely a carrier of the <b>hemophilia</b> gene {{and might have}} passed on the disease to another {{generation}} if she had survived to have the children she dreamed of. One of Alexandra's brothers and two of her nephews, {{as well as one}} of her maternal uncles and two children of one of her first cousins were all hemophiliacs, as was Maria's brother Alexei. Maria herself reportedly hemorrhaged in December 1914 during an operation to remove her tonsils, according to her paternal aunt Grand Duchess Olga Alexandrovna of Russia, who was interviewed later in her life. The doctor performing the operation was so unnerved that he had to be ordered to continue by Maria's mother, Tsarina Alexandra. Olga Alexandrovna said she believed all four of her nieces bled more than was normal and believed they were carriers of the <b>hemophilia</b> gene like their mother. Symptomatic carriers of the gene, while not hemophiliacs themselves, can have symptoms of <b>hemophilia</b> including a lower than normal blood clotting factor that can lead to heavy bleeding during childbirth or surgical procedures such as a tonsillectomy. DNA testing on the remains of the royal family proved in 2009 that Alexei suffered from <b>hemophilia</b> B, a rarer form of the disease. The same testing proved that his mother and one of the four Grand Duchesses were carriers. Russians identify the grand duchess who carried the gene as Anastasia, but American scientists identified the young woman as Maria.|$|E
5|$|Ryan White {{was born}} at St. Joseph Memorial Hospital in Kokomo, Indiana, to Hubert Wayne and Jeanne Elaine (Hale) White. When he was circumcised, the {{bleeding}} would not stop. When he was three days old, doctors diagnosed him with severe <b>hemophilia</b> A, a hereditary blood coagulation disorder associated with the X chromosome, which causes even minor injuries to result in severe bleeding. For treatment, he received weekly infusions of Factor VIII, a blood product created from pooled plasma of non-hemophiliacs, an increasingly common treatment for hemophiliacs at the time.|$|E
5|$|Aspirin {{should not}} be taken by people who are {{allergic}} to ibuprofen or naproxen, or who have salicylate intolerance or a more generalized drug intolerance to NSAIDs, and caution should be exercised in those with asthma or NSAID-precipitated bronchospasm. Owing to its effect on the stomach lining, manufacturers recommend people with peptic ulcers, mild diabetes, or gastritis seek medical advice before using aspirin. Even if none of these conditions is present, the risk of stomach bleeding is still increased when aspirin is taken with alcohol or warfarin. People with <b>hemophilia</b> or other bleeding tendencies should not take aspirin or other salicylates. Aspirin is known to cause hemolytic anemia in people who have the genetic disease glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase deficiency, particularly in large doses and depending on the severity of the disease. Use of aspirin during dengue fever is not recommended owing to increased bleeding tendency. People with kidney disease, hyperuricemia, or gout should not take aspirin because it inhibits the kidneys' ability to excrete uric acid, thus may exacerbate these conditions. Aspirin {{should not be}} given to children or adolescents to control cold or influenza symptoms, as this has been linked with Reye's syndrome.|$|E
25|$|Factor VIII {{turned out}} to be {{deficient}} in the clinically recognised but etiologically elusive <b>hemophilia</b> A; it was identified in the 1950s and is alternatively called antihemophilic globulin due to its capability to correct <b>hemophilia</b> A.|$|E
25|$|In 1986, four Chinese <b>hemophilia</b> {{patients}} are found HIV positive after blood transfusions. The blood products were imported.|$|E
25|$|Hematologic {{disorders}} {{linked to}} osteoporosis are multiple myeloma and other monoclonal gammopathies, lymphoma, leukemia, mastocytosis, <b>hemophilia,</b> sickle-cell disease and thalassemia.|$|E
25|$|<b>Hemophilia,</b> {{although}} statistically {{associated with}} higher risk of HCC, {{this is due to}} coincident chronic viral hepatitis infection related to repeated blood transfusions over lifetime.|$|E
25|$|Type 3 is {{the most}} severe form of vWD (homozygous for the {{defective}} gene) and is characterized by complete absence of production of vWF. The von Willebrand factor is undetectable in the vWF antigen assay. Since the vWF protects coagulation factor VIII from proteolytic degradation, total absence of vWF leads to extremely low factor VIII level, equivalent to that seen in severe <b>hemophilia</b> A with its clinical manifestations of life-threatening external and internal hemorrhages. The inheritance pattern of vWD type 3 is autosomal recessive, while the inheritance pattern of <b>hemophilia</b> A is X-linked recessive.|$|E
25|$|Clotting factors {{synthesized}} {{by modern}} recombinant methods {{are now in}} routine clinical use for <b>hemophilia,</b> as the risks of infection transmission that occur with pooled blood products are avoided.|$|E
25|$|Moor-Jankowski was {{the author}} and editor of many books, monographs and periodicals, and more than 200 papers on human genetics, <b>hemophilia,</b> blood groups, {{immunology}} and primate medical experimentation.|$|E
25|$|Chemistry {{professor}} Raymond Lemieux was {{the first}} to synthesize sucrose. The breakthrough laid the groundwork for new antibiotics and blood reagents, anti-rejection drugs for organ transplants, and better treatments for leukemia and <b>hemophilia.</b>|$|E
25|$|Deficiencies of {{platelet}} function may require platelet transfusion while deficiencies of clotting factors may require transfusion of either {{fresh frozen plasma}} or specific clotting factors, such as Factor VIII for patients with <b>hemophilia.</b>|$|E
25|$|Immunoadsorbtion with Staphylococcal protein A-agarose column – {{removal of}} allo- and autoantibodies (in {{autoimmune}} diseases, transplant rejection, <b>hemophilia)</b> by directing plasma through protein A-agarose columns. Protein A is a cell wall component produced by several strains of Staphylococcus aureus which binds to the Fc region of IgG.|$|E
25|$|He {{has brought}} other celebrities {{to support the}} event, {{including}} his father, actor Martin Sheen. Sheen's interest in AIDS was first reported in 1987 with his support of Ryan White, an Indiana teenager who became a national spokesperson for AIDS awareness after being infected with AIDS through a blood transfusion for his <b>hemophilia.</b>|$|E
25|$|To date, AAV vectors {{have been}} used in over 117 {{clinical}} trials worldwide, approximately 5.6% of virus-vectored gene-therapy trials. Recently, promising results have been obtained from Phase 1 and Phase 2 trials for a number of diseases, including Leber's congenital amaurosis, <b>Hemophilia,</b> congestive heart failure, spinal muscular atrophy, lipoprotein lipase deficiency, and Parkinson's disease.|$|E
25|$|Coagulation factor {{concentrates}} {{are used}} to treat <b>hemophilia,</b> to reverse the effects of anticoagulants, and to treat bleeding in patients with impaired coagulation factor synthesis or increased consumption. Prothrombin complex concentrate, cryoprecipitate and fresh frozen plasma are commonly used coagulation factor products. Recombinant activated human factor VII is increasingly popular {{in the treatment of}} major bleeding.|$|E
25|$|It {{is unclear}} when Rasputin first learned of Alexei's <b>hemophilia,</b> {{or when he}} first acted as a healer for Alexei. He may {{have been aware of}} Alexei's {{condition}} as early as October 1906 and was summoned by Alexandra to pray for Alexei when he had an internal hemorrhage in the spring of 1907. Alexei recovered the next morning.|$|E
25|$|Four {{adverse events}} {{associated}} with moxibustion were bruising, burns and cellulitis, spinal epidural abscess, and large superficial basal cell carcinoma. Ten adverse events {{were associated with}} cupping. The minor ones were keloid scarring, burns, and bullae; the serious ones were acquired <b>hemophilia</b> A, stroke following cupping {{on the back and}} neck, factitious panniculitis, reversible cardiac hypertrophy, and iron deficiency anemia.|$|E
25|$|Ailes {{was born}} {{and grew up in}} the factory town of Warren, Ohio, the son of Donna Marie (née Cunningham) and Robert Eugene Ailes, a factory {{maintenance}} foreman. Ailes suffered from <b>hemophilia</b> and was often hospitalized as a youth. He attended the Warren city schools, and later was inducted into Warren High School's Distinguished Alumni Hall of Fame. His father was abusive, and his parents divorced in 1960.|$|E
25|$|Factor IX was {{discovered}} in 1952 in a young patient with <b>hemophilia</b> B named Stephen Christmas (1947–1993). His deficiency was described by Dr. Rosemary Biggs and Professor R.G. MacFarlane in Oxford, UK. The factor is, hence, called Christmas Factor. Christmas lived in Canada, and campaigned for blood transfusion safety until succumbing to transfusion-related AIDS at age 46. An alternative name for the factor is plasma thromboplastin component, given by an independent group in California.|$|E
25|$|During the 1980s, {{molecular}} {{and cellular}} studies distinguished <b>hemophilia</b> A and vWD more precisely. Persons who had vWD had a normal FVIII gene on the X chromosome, and some had an abnormal vWF gene on chromosome 12. Gene sequencing identified {{many of these}} persons as having a vWF gene mutation. The genetic causes of milder forms of low vWF are still under investigation, and these forms {{may not always be}} caused by an abnormal vWF gene.|$|E
25|$|Although {{genetics}} has {{its roots}} back in the 19th century {{with the work of}} the Bohemian monk Gregor Mendel and other pioneering scientists, human genetics emerged later. It started to develop, albeit slowly, {{during the first half of}} the 20th century. Mendelian (single-gene) inheritance was studied in a number of important disorders such as albinism, brachydactyly (short fingers and toes), and <b>hemophilia.</b> Mathematical approaches were also devised and applied to human genetics. Population genetics was created.|$|E
25|$|Subject to {{overriding}} medical considerations, the circumcision {{must take}} place eight {{days after the}} birth of the child, even when this falls on Shabbat. The child must be medically fit for a circumcision to be performed, and Jewish law prohibits parents having their son circumcised if medical doctors hold that the procedure may unduly threaten the child's health (e.g. because of <b>hemophilia).</b> If by reason of the child's debility or sickness the ceremony is postponed, it cannot take place on Shabbat.|$|E
25|$|Her {{siblings}} included Princess Victoria of Hesse and by Rhine, wife of Prince Louis of Battenberg, Grand Duchess Elizabeth Feodorovna of Russia, wife of Grand Duke Sergei Alexandrovich of Russia, Ernest Louis, Grand Duke of Hesse and by Rhine, and Empress Alexandra Feodorovna of Russia, wife of Tsar Nicholas II of Russia. Like {{her younger}} sister, the empress, Irene was a carrier of the <b>hemophilia</b> gene, and Irene would lose her sisters Alix and Elisabeth in Russia to the Bolsheviks.|$|E
25|$|Research {{has shown}} a fairly limited side effect profile for honokiol and {{it appears to be}} fairly well tolerated. However, its {{antithrombotic}} effects could cause hemorrhage especially in patients with conditions that would put them at a higher risk like <b>hemophilia</b> or Von Willebrand disease. Additionally, patients already taking anticoagulants should talk to their doctor before taking honokiol supplements. Honokiol is also neurotoxic at high concentrations. In a 2002 study, researchers induced cell death in fetal rat cortical neurons by directly applying 100μM in vitro.|$|E
25|$|The {{identification}} of fetal sex {{for women who}} are carriers of X-linked diseases is advantageous for the family. X-linked diseases occur at a rate of 5 in 10,000 live births. The most commonly published sex-linked diseases include Duchenne muscular dystrophy and <b>hemophilia.</b> Ultrasonography is unreliable during the first trimester of pregnancy, as the genitalia are not fully developed. Other methods for sex determination before the use of cffDNA are invasive and performed at 11 weeks of gestation. There is a small risk of miscarriage. The main method is to target the SRY gene on the Y chromosome and DYS14 sequence.|$|E
25|$|If a {{coagulation}} factor {{is part of}} the contact activation or tissue factor pathway, a deficiency of that factor will affect only one of the tests: Thus <b>hemophilia</b> A, a deficiency of factor VIII, which {{is part of the}} contact activation pathway, results in an abnormally prolonged aPTT test but a normal PT test. The exceptions are prothrombin, fibrinogen, and some variants of FX that can be detected only by either aPTT or PT. If an abnormal PT or aPTT is present, additional testing will occur to determine which (if any) factor is present as aberrant concentrations.|$|E
25|$|Many useful {{proteins}} {{are currently}} available as recombinant products. These include--(1) medically useful proteins whose administration can correct a defective or poorly expressed gene (e.g. recombinant factor VIII, a blood-clotting factor deficient in {{some forms of}} <b>hemophilia,</b> and recombinant insulin, used to treat some forms of diabetes), (2) proteins that can be administered to assist in a life-threatening emergency (e.g. tissue plasminogen activator, used to treat strokes), (3) recombinant subunit vaccines, in which a purified protein {{can be used to}} immunize patients against infectious diseases, without exposing them to the infectious agent itself (e.g. hepatitis B vaccine), and (4) recombinant proteins as standard material for diagnostic laboratory tests.|$|E
25|$|In late 1906, Rasputin began {{acting as}} a healer for the Tsar and his wife Alexandra's son Alexei, who {{suffered}} from <b>hemophilia</b> and was Nicholas' only heir (Tsarevitch). At court, he was a divisive figure, seen by some Russians as a mystic, visionary, and prophet, and by others as a religious charlatan. The high point of Rasputin's power was in 1915, when Nicholas II left St Petersburg to oversee Russian armies fighting World War I, increasing both Alexandra and Rasputin's influence. As Russian defeats in the war mounted, however, both Rasputin and Alexandra became increasingly unpopular. In the early morning of , Rasputin was assassinated {{by a group of}} conservative noblemen who opposed his influence over Alexandra and the Tsar.|$|E
25|$|Acupuncture is {{generally}} safe when administered by an experienced, appropriately trained practitioner using clean-needle technique and sterile single-use needles. When improperly delivered {{it can cause}} adverse effects. Accidents and infections are associated with infractions of sterile technique or neglect {{on the part of}} the practitioner. To reduce the risk of serious adverse events after acupuncture, acupuncturists should be trained sufficiently. People with serious spinal disease, such as cancer or infection, are not good candidates for acupuncture. Contraindications to acupuncture (conditions that should not be treated with acupuncture) include coagulopathy disorders (e.g. <b>hemophilia</b> and advanced liver disease), warfarin use, severe psychiatric disorders (e.g. psychosis), and skin infections or skin trauma (e.g. burns). Further, electroacupuncture should be avoided at the spot of implanted electrical devices (such as pacemakers).|$|E
25|$|Transposon {{silencing}} {{is a form}} of transcriptional {{gene silencing}} targeting transposons. Transcriptional gene silencing is a product of histone modifications that prevent the transcription of a particular area of DNA. Transcriptional silencing of transposons is crucial to the maintenance of a genome. The “jumping” of transposons generates genomic instability and can cause extremely deleterious mutations. Transposable element insertions have been linked to many diseases including <b>hemophilia,</b> severe combined immunodeficiency, and predisposition to cancer. The silencing of transposons is therefore extremely critical in the germline in order to stop transposon mutations from developing and being passed on to the next generation. Additionally, these epigenetic defenses against transposons can be heritable. Studies in Drosophila, Arabidopsis thaliana, and mice all indicate that small interfering RNAs are responsible for transposon silencing. In animals, these siRNAS and piRNAs are most active in the gonads.|$|E
25|$|In 1929, Infanta Beatriz turned {{twenty years}} old. She {{fell in love}} with Miguel Primo de Rivera y Sáenz de Heredia, the {{youngest}} son of Miguel Primo de Rivera, who served as Prime Minister of Spain from 1923 to January 1930 with dictatorial powers. They were seen taking horse rides together, but a marriage between them was out of the question. When the dictator found out about their romance, he sent his son abroad. Because Beatriz and her sister could be carriers of <b>hemophilia,</b> like their mother, King Alphonso XIII was reluctant to follow the tradition of finding husbands for them among Catholic royal princes. The two sisters' constant companions were their cousins Alvaro, Alonso and Ataúlfo de Orleans y Borbón, the three sons of Infante Alfonso de Orleans y Borbón. It was expected that Infanta Beatriz would marry Alonso and Maria Cristina, Alvaro, but nothing came out of it as their companionship was interrupted when the turbulent political situation in Spain derailed their lives.|$|E
25|$|Severe {{monogenic}} diseases {{for which}} prenatal diagnosis is more commonly applied to include cystic fibrosis, beta-thalassemia, sickle cell anemia, spinal muscular atrophy, myotonic dystrophy, fragile-X syndrome, Duchenne muscular dystrophy and <b>Hemophilia.</b> Both autosomal dominant and recessive disorders {{have been detected}} noninvasively by analyzing paternally inherited DNA. Limitations to single gene disorders are autosomal recessive mutation or when the fetal autosomal dominant mutation is maternally inherited. There are also large sequence mutations that include duplication, expansion, insertion of DNA sequences. cffDNA is fragmented with 200-300bp in length, thus these are harder to detect. One example is achondroplasia, a common autosomal dominant form of dwarfism, caused by FGFR3 gene point mutations. Two pregnancies were examined in this study, one fetus {{was found to have}} the paternally inherited G1138A mutation and the other with a G1138A de novo mutation. Another example is the Huntington's disease. It is currently diagnosed at 10–13 weeks at gestation with chronic villus sampling for polymorphic repeats. With qRT-PCR, there has been detection of CAG repeats at 17, 20 and 24, all normal levels.|$|E
25|$|Grand Duke Michael {{was second}} {{in the line of}} {{imperial}} succession after his nephew, Tsarevich Alexei, but Alexei suffered from <b>hemophilia</b> and it was feared that he would not live long enough to inherit the throne. Under Russian House Law, Michael, {{as a member of the}} imperial family, could not marry without the consent of the ruling monarch, Nicholas II. Nicholas would not grant permission for Michael to marry Natalia, however, because Natalia was twice divorced and not of royal blood. In 1912, Alexei suffered a life-threatening hemorrhage in the thigh and groin while the family was at Spala, Poland. Michael feared that Alexei would not survive, which would make him heir and the possibility of his marriage to Natalia even more remote. Consequently, Michael decided to marry Natalia anyway. They married in a Serbian Orthodox Church in Vienna on 16 October 1912. A few days later George, his newly-wed parents, and Natalia's daughter from her first marriage met up in Cannes. From there, Michael wrote to his mother and brother to inform them of the marriage. The imperial family was shocked, seeing it as a betrayal of duty, especially as it was done while the Tsarevich was so close to dying. Michael and his family were exiled from Russia. They stayed in grand hotels in Cannes, Paris, Chexbres, Bad Kissingen and London before settling in England in September 1913.|$|E
25|$|In {{the case}} of {{families}} at risk for X-linked diseases, patients are provided with a single PGD assay of gender identification. Gender selection offers a solution to individuals with X-linked diseases {{who are in the}} process of getting pregnant. The selection of a female embryo offspring is used in order to prevent the transmission of X-linked Mendelian recessive diseases. Such X-linked Mendelian diseases include Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD), and <b>hemophilia</b> A and B, which are rarely seen in females because the offspring is unlikely to inherit two copies of the recessive allele. Since two copies of the mutant X allele are required for the disease to be passed on to the female offspring, females will at worst be carriers for the disease but may not necessarily have a dominant gene for the disease. Males on the other hand only require one copy of the mutant X allele for the disease to occur in one's phenotype and therefore, the male offspring of a carrier mother has a 50% chance of having the disease. Reasons may include the rarity of the condition or because affected males are reproductively disadvantaged. Therefore, medical uses of PGD for selection of a female offspring to prevent the transmission of X-linked Mendelian recessive disorders are often applied. Preimplantation genetic diagnosis applied for gender selection can be used for non-Mendelian disorders that are significantly more prevalent in one sex. Three assessments are made prior to the initiation of the PGD process for the prevention of these inherited disorders. In order to validate the use of PGD, gender selection is based on the seriousness of the inherited condition, the risk ratio in either sex, or the options for disease treatment.|$|E
