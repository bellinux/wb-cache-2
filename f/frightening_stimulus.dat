5000|$|Characters in Unknown Armies have [...] "passions", {{specific}} stimuli {{that bring}} out certain behavior and reflect the character's deepest personality traits. Every character has one [...] "fear passion" [...] {{that gives the}} character a bonus chance to escape a specific kind of <b>frightening</b> <b>stimulus,</b> one [...] "rage passion" [...] that helps the character lash out against a particular frustrating stimulus, and one [...] "noble passion" [...] that provides a bonus to selfless behavior {{for the sake of}} some greater cause. Passions are invented freeform during character creation, but each fear passion is tied to one of the five types of psychological stress in UA: Violence, Helplessness, Isolation, Self, or the Unnatural.|$|E
40|$|Fear is {{generally}} considered to be an undesirable emotional state that may reduce welfare, growth and reproductive performance in animals. Fear in horses is additionally problematic, because fear reactions can cause serious injury to both horse and human. Horses are primarily used for sports and leisure for a large number of children and young women. Unfortunately, horse riding ranks {{as one of the most}} dangerous sports in terms of the number and seriousness of accidents, and the ability of a horse to habituate to a range of otherwise frightening stimuli greatly increases safety in the horse-human relationship. However, there is a lack of research on fear reactions and no published research on basic habituation processes in horses. This licentiate project aimed to investigate the types of fear responses horses show towards novel stimuli acting on different senses, and to study how horses learn to be confident with an otherwise <b>frightening</b> <b>stimulus</b> using classical learning theory techniques. The experiments were conducted on two different groups of naïve stallions (n= 24 and n= 27). The first experiment showed that horses responded differently towards an olfactory stimulus compared to auditory and visual stimuli. The heart rate responses correlated between tests and probably reflected a non-differentiated activation of the sympathetic nervous system, while the behavioural responses were linked to the type of stimulus. The second experiment showed that gradual habituation was the most effective training method for horses to learn to react calmly to an otherwise <b>frightening</b> <b>stimulus,</b> compared to classic habituation and associative learning. Heart rate data revealed that horses may show physiological responses even when their behavioural response towards the stimulus has ceased. Choice of training method is likely to be especially important for the most fearful horses...|$|E
40|$|Fear is {{a natural}} {{response}} and is strongly connected with survival. Through domestication we have managed to reduce fear {{but it is still}} prominent in many animals. In dogs, living with us, fear can be very problematic and result in big problems for both dog and owner. There are many things that can affect the occurrence of fear and as many things as the dog may exhibit fear of. It can sometimes be difficult for the owner to know what the best way is to deal with the dog in these situations. This work intends to look at fear in dogs, to see how common it is and what dogs exhibit fear against. The work will also provide a picture of what the owner does when the dog exhibits fear and how the owners affect their dog both positively and negatively. A survey was sent out and a literature review was conducted to answer these questions. The results of this study show that the fear are very common in dogs and that the most common fears is the fear of sudden noises, other dogs, strangers and new objects. The most common reactions from the owner when the dog shows fear is to ignore the dog or to encourage the dog to approach the <b>frightening</b> <b>stimulus.</b> The owner can influence the dog both intentionally and unintentionally, depending on how they act and feel when the dog exhibits fear. The owner’s attitude to the dog, emotions such as stress and even training methods the owner uses can also affect the dog’s behaviour. Further research is needed in this area to get a more clear picture of how the owner influence the dog in different situations...|$|E
40|$|Various <b>frightening</b> <b>stimuli,</b> {{primarily}} {{visual and}} acoustic, {{have been used}} to prevent or alleviate damage by depredating mammals (e. g., deer (Odocoileus spp.), raccoons (Procyon lotor), tree squirrels (Sciurus spp.), coyotes (Canis latrans). Frightening methods are most appropriate for use where a crop or situation needs protection from pest mammals for only a period of a few days or weeks. The ability of animals to habituate to such stimuli limits their long-term usefulness. Against nocturnal species, various types of lights and noisemakers are the most useful. Combining acoustic and visual stimuli can enhance effectiveness, while varying the techniques used, the placement of frightening devices, and/or the timing sequence can delay habituation. Other types of physical <b>frightening</b> <b>stimuli</b> are also reviewed...|$|R
5000|$|The best {{treatment}} {{strategy for}} this type of needle phobia has historically been desensitization or the progressive exposure of the patient to gradually more <b>frightening</b> <b>stimuli,</b> allowing them to become desensitized to the stimulus that triggers the phobic response. In recent years, a technique known as [...] "applied tension" [...] has become increasingly accepted as an often effective means for maintaining blood pressure to avoid the unpleasant, and sometimes dangerous, aspects of the vasovagal reaction.|$|R
50|$|There is {{controversy}} over various techniques. Some training methods advocate putting only slight {{pressure on the}} horse, allowing it to gradually become accustomed to a frightening object, while other methods sometimes advocate techniques {{that are based on}} the operant conditioning principle of flooding, for example, waving a large blanket on and over a horse tied to a sturdy post so that it cannot escape -- the latter methods often being quicker at first, but also far more dangerous because rapid exposure to <b>frightening</b> <b>stimuli</b> can cause a horse to panic, and, if tied or confined, to risk injury to the animal or handler in an attempt to free itself.|$|R
40|$|In {{polygynous}} mammals, {{the adult}} sex ratio is often female-biased due to higher male mortality. Sex-biased mortality may begin during the juvenile period if sex-specific growth rates or behavior result in differential mortality. I examined {{the causes of}} male-biased mortality in juvenile thirteen-lined ground squirrels, a polygynous species with a strongly female-biased adult sex ratio (1 M: 7 F) and little adult size dimorphism. Average litter size at emergence was 6. 9 ± 0. 4 juveniles and the sex ratio was even. Mothers left their litters 17. 0 ± 1. 3 days after emergence, and all juveniles slept alone 28. 9 ± 2. 6 days after emergence. There was no juvenile size or growth rate dimorphism. On average, only 26 % of all juvenile males survived their first summer in contrast to 34 % of juvenile females. Three weeks after emergence the number of juvenile males that disappeared increased dramatically, {{and by the end}} of the summer, the sex ratio was 1 M: 1. 7 F. Radio-tracking of 33 males and 33 females confirmed that 71. 2 % of all juvenile deaths were due to predation. Natal dispersal did not substantially contribute to the large proportion of males that disappeared over the summer. There was no significant difference between distances males and females were active from their burrows, their home range size, or home range overlap with maternal and sibling ranges. The rate of range expansion did not differ between the sexes at any time during the summer. Behavioral observations indicated a tendency for males to spend more time in social interactions, particularly play, than females. An experimental test of fearlessness indicated that males were less wary than females. Males had significantly shorter flight initiation distances and resurfaced significantly faster than did females after a <b>frightening</b> <b>stimulus.</b> Resurfacing times were not significantly different between the sexes in a second experiment, but the overall behavioral pattern was similar to the first. Reduced fear could increase exposure to predation and therefore elevate mortality of juvenile males. ...|$|E
40|$|Exposure {{therapy is}} a widely used {{treatment}} for patients with post-traumatic stress dis-order. It involves reduction of fear through pro-gressive exposure to <b>frightening</b> <b>stimuli</b> in a therapeutic environment. Here we propose a new method designed to improve the effective-ness of exposure therapy. We hypothesized that device-guided breathing during exposure therapy can increase the capability of the patient to undergo effective exposure. The suc-cessful application of the method is described for a single patient. Using a device to slow and regularize breathing, the patient was calmed and experienced {{a greater sense of}} control and a profound effect of the exposure. The use of the breathing-guiding device is believed to reduce arousal level and excitability of sympa-thetic “fight-flight ” behaviors. The present study suggests that device-guided breathing integrated with exposure therapy may provide a practically feasible and potentially promising non-pharmacological treatment after trauma...|$|R
50|$|People with Williams {{syndrome}} {{are often}} affable and hyperverbal, demonstrating the decreased inhibition ability that stems from dorsal-frontal deficits. Some {{studies suggest that}} the amygdala of a person with Williams syndrome has greater volume than the average person's (though it is smaller than average in childhood).In general, neuroimaging studies demonstrate that individuals with Williams syndrome have diminished amygdala reactivity in response to socially <b>frightening</b> <b>stimuli</b> (such as disapproving faces), but demonstrate hyperreactivity in the amygdala when presented with nonsocial fear <b>stimuli</b> (such as <b>frightening</b> animals). This may partially account for the apparent absence of social inhibition observed in individuals with the syndrome, as well as the prevalence of anxious symptoms (but see fear for details on the relationship between the amygdala and fear response). There is also evidence that individuals with Williams exhibit hyper amygdala activity when viewing happy facial expressions.|$|R
5000|$|Cerebellum - Recently, {{there has}} been a {{considerable}} amount of work that describes the role of the cerebellum in emotion as well as cognition, and a [...] "Cerebellar Cognitive Affective Syndrome" [...] has been described. Both neuroimaging studies as well as studies following pathological lesions in the cerebellum (such as a stroke) demonstrate that the cerebellum has a significant role in emotional regulation. Lesion studies have shown that cerebellar dysfunction can attenuate the experience of positive emotions. While these same studies do not show an attenuated response to <b>frightening</b> <b>stimuli,</b> the stimuli did not recruit structures that normally would be activated (such as the amygdala). Rather, alternative limbic structures were activated, such as the ventromedial prefrontal cortex, the anterior cingulate gyrus, and the insula. This may indicate that evolutionary pressure resulted {{in the development of the}} cerebellum as a redundant fear-mediating circuit to enhance survival. It may also indicate a regulatory role for the cerebellum in the neural response to rewarding stimuli, such as money, drugs of abuse, and orgasm.|$|R
40|$|This {{handbook}} is {{a comprehensive}} reference of North American vertebrate species that can cause economic damage to resources or become a nuisance at various times and places. It is intended for use by extension agents and specialists, wildlife biologists, animal control officers, public health personnel, pest control operators, teachers and students of wildlife biology, and others who deal with wildlife damage problems. Wildlife damage management {{is an essential part}} of contemporary wildlife management. During the past decade there has been significant research and development in this field. This publication is a condensation of current, research-based information on wildlife that cause problems and the control of damage that they cause. While it emphasizes prevention of damage as being desirable when possible, it does not neglect the necessity of population reduction in those cases where animals must be removed to solve problems. It stresses an integrated approach to damage management and includes treatment of materials and techniques such as exclusion, habitat modification, repellents, <b>frightening</b> <b>stimuli,</b> toxicants, fumigants, trapping, shooting, and others. All of the major vertebrate pesticides that are currently federally registered are included. Since pesticide registrations change from time to time and new materials become available, users are advised to check with appropriate federal and state authorities for updated information...|$|R
500|$|The horses {{who have}} served as Thunder {{have been trained to}} remain calm in {{situations}} that would normally cause a horse to respond with a fight-or-flight response, such as the flashing explosions of a pyrotechnic display, or items suddenly landing on the field including skydivers with parachutes and various objects thrown by spectators, or loud music and the sounds associated {{with tens of thousands of}} cheering fans at Mile High. Ann Judge has explained that because so many unexpected things can happen, it is important that the people working with him remain calm; it is trust in his rider and handlers, not just desensitization, that helps the horse remain steady: [...] "You want them to look to you for the appropriate response and for confidence and faith so that the flight response doesn’t get initiated." [...] She describes the process by saying, [...] "if something is fearful to him, as long as he looks to me, and I tell him he’s OK, he’s OK." [...] The only <b>frightening</b> <b>stimuli</b> that was an ongoing problem for both Thunder Sr. and Thunder II was when the crowd would perform the wave; Thunder Sr. would stand still, but tremble. Thunder II would become tense, requiring ground handlers and his rider to help steady him. Thunder III is the first of the mascots to tolerate wearing earplugs, which help protect his hearing from loud noises during games.|$|R
40|$|The study aims at {{identifying}} {{patterns of}} mother-toddler emotion regulation and testing {{whether they are}} related to mothers' attachment. An Italian community sample (N =  38; 66 % males) was followed longitudinally, with mothers' attachment collected through the Adult Attachment Interview at 14  months of child's age and mothers' and children's emotion regulation behaviors assessed through a fear-eliciting lab procedure when the child turned two years old. Two dyadic regulatory patterns were identified through a two-phased cluster analytic plan. Children characterized by one pattern approached, explored and played with the threatening stimulus, whereas children characterized by the other pattern tended to become <b>frightened</b> by this <b>stimulus</b> and avoided the object. The majority of children whose mothers were classified as secure displayed the first regulatory pattern. This finding contributes to extending understanding of how parental factors can influence the development of self-regulation...|$|R
40|$|The {{present study}} {{examined}} the effects of imposed monitoring and blunting coping strategies on emotional reactivity in 40 subjects who prepared themselves for upcoming neutral and aversive slides. Besides subjective indices, electrodermal measures and eye blink startle responses were used to evaluate the effect of preparatory strategies. In order to investigate whether effects of strategies are modulated by individual differences in coping style, habitual monitoring was assessed with the Miller Behavioral Style Scale (MBSS; Miller, 1987). It was found that monitoring instructions resulted in higher levels of subjective anxiety during the anticipation of aversive slides than blunting instructions. In addition, when confronted with the <b>frightening</b> and neutral <b>stimuli,</b> monitoring instruction subjects showed smaller electrodermal reactivity than blunting instruction subjects. These effects were not found to be modulated by habitual coping style. Overall, the startle measure yielded no meaningful effects. Taken together, the results seem to indicate that emotional reactivity under threatening conditions is more affected by imposed coping strategies than by habitual coping styles as indexed by the MBSS...|$|R
40|$|Wildlife {{is often}} {{responsible}} for causing extensive damage to personal property, {{human health and}} safety concerns, and other nuisance problems because of their feeding, roosting, breeding, and loafing habits. Frightening devices are tools used in integrated wildlife damage management to reduce the impacts of animals, but the effectiveness of such devices is often variable. An animal’s visual and auditory capabilities affect how the animal will respond to a <b>stimulus.</b> <b>Frightening</b> devices include pyrotechnics, gas exploders, effigies, lights, lasers, reflective objects, guard animals, bioacoustics, and ultrasonic devices. We examined scientific literature {{on the use of}} frightening devices to reduce bird and mammal depredation and compiled results to determine the effectiveness of such devices. When used in an integrated system, frightening devices may be more effective than when used alone. We conclude that the total elimination of damage may be impossible, but frightening devices and/or combinations of devices are useful in reducing wildlife damage. Ultrasonic frightening devices are ineffective in repelling birds and mammals whereas other devices offer some protection. The timely use of a variety of frightening devices can be part of a cost-effective integrated system to reduce wildlife damage to tolerable levels...|$|R
40|$|Background and objectives:Modern {{learning}} theories {{suggest that}} particularly strong associative learning {{contributes to the}} etiology and maintenance of anxiety disorders, thus explaining why some individuals develop an anxiety disorder after a frightening (conditioning) event, whereas others do not. However, associative learning has rarely been investigated experimentally in specific phobias. The current study investigated associative learning in patients with flying phobia and healthy controls using {{a modified version of}} Olson and Fazio’s associative learning paradigm (Olson & Fazio, 2001). Methods:Under the guise of an attention task, patients with flying phobia (n = 33), and healthy controls (n = 39) viewed a series of distracters interspersed with pairings of novel objects (counterbalancedconditioned <b>stimuli,</b> CSs) with <b>frightening</b> and pleasant <b>stimuli</b> (unconditioned stimuli, USs). Results:After the conditioning procedure patients with flying phobia rated both CSs more frightening and showed stronger discrimination between the CSs for valence compared to healthy controls. Conclusions:Our findings indicate a particularly stronger conditioning effect in flying phobia. These results contribute {{to the understanding of the}} etiology of specific phobia and may help to explain why only some individuals develop a flying phobia after an aversive event associated with flying...|$|R
