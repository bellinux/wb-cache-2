5|$|Activated B cells {{differentiate}} {{into either}} antibody-producing cells called plasma cells that secrete soluble antibody or memory cells that {{survive in the}} body for years afterward {{in order to allow}} the <b>immune</b> <b>system</b> <b>to</b> remember an antigen and respond faster upon future exposures.|$|E
5|$|Both innate and {{adaptive}} immunity {{depend on the}} ability of the <b>immune</b> <b>system</b> <b>to</b> distinguish between self and non-self molecules. In immunology, self molecules are those components of an organism's body that can be distinguished from foreign substances by the immune system. Conversely, non-self molecules are those recognized as foreign molecules. One class of non-self molecules are called antigens (short for antibody generators) and are defined as substances that bind to specific immune receptors and elicit an immune response.|$|E
50|$|Infection occurs {{more easily}} as one ages, as the <b>immune</b> <b>system</b> starts <b>to</b> slow and become less effective. Aging also changes how the <b>immune</b> <b>system</b> reacts <b>to</b> infection, making new infections harder {{to detect and}} attack. Essentially, the <b>immune</b> <b>system</b> has a higher chance of being {{compromised}} the older one gets.|$|R
50|$|Allergies {{are caused}} by an oversensitive <b>immune</b> <b>system,</b> leading <b>to</b> a {{misdirected}} immune response. The <b>immune</b> <b>system</b> normally protects the body against harmful substances such as bacteria and viruses. Allergy occurs when the <b>immune</b> <b>system</b> reacts <b>to</b> substances (allergens) that are generally harmless and in {{most people do not}} cause an immune response.|$|R
50|$|Another study {{published}} in the Journal of Infectious Diseases proved that varicella zoster immune globulin (VZIG) can be administered to children with suppressed <b>immune</b> <b>systems</b> <b>to</b> protect them against severe chicken pox.|$|R
5|$|Investigations on neuroprotection {{are at the}} {{forefront}} of PD research. Several molecules have been proposed as potential treatments. However, none of them have been conclusively demonstrated to reduce degeneration. Agents currently under investigation include anti-apoptotics (omigapil, CEP-1347), antiglutamatergics, monoamine oxidase inhibitors (selegiline, rasagiline), promitochondrials (coenzyme Q10, creatine), calcium channel blockers (isradipine) and growth factors (GDNF). Preclinical research also targets alpha-synuclein. A vaccine that primes the human <b>immune</b> <b>system</b> <b>to</b> destroy alpha-synuclein, PD01A (developed by Austrian company, Affiris), has entered clinical trials in humans.|$|E
5|$|Immunodeficiencies {{occur when}} {{one or more}} of the {{components}} of the immune system are inactive. The ability of the <b>immune</b> <b>system</b> <b>to</b> respond to pathogens is diminished in both the young and the elderly, with immune responses beginning to decline at around 50 years of age due to immunosenescence. In developed countries, obesity, alcoholism, and drug use are common causes of poor immune function. However, malnutrition is the most common cause of immunodeficiency in developing countries. Diets lacking sufficient protein are associated with impaired cell-mediated immunity, complement activity, phagocyte function, IgA antibody concentrations, and cytokine production. Additionally, the loss of the thymus at an early age through genetic mutation or surgical removal results in severe immunodeficiency and a high susceptibility to infection.|$|E
5|$|The {{immune system}} protects organisms from {{infection}} with layered defenses of increasing specificity. In simple terms, physical barriers prevent pathogens such as bacteria and viruses {{from entering the}} organism. If a pathogen breaches these barriers, the innate immune system provides an immediate, but non-specific response. Innate immune systems are found in all plants and animals. If pathogens successfully evade the innate response, vertebrates possess a second layer of protection, the adaptive immune system, which is activated by the innate response. Here, the immune system adapts its response during an infection to improve its recognition of the pathogen. This improved response is then retained after the pathogen has been eliminated, {{in the form of}} an immunological memory, and allows the adaptive <b>immune</b> <b>system</b> <b>to</b> mount faster and stronger attacks each time this pathogen is encountered.|$|E
50|$|The {{respiratory}} tract antimicrobial defense {{system is a}} layered defense mechanism which relies on components of both the innate and adaptive <b>immune</b> <b>systems</b> <b>to</b> protect the lungs {{and the rest of}} the {{respiratory tract}} against inhaled microorganisms.|$|R
50|$|According to the hygiene hypothesis, {{high levels}} of {{cleanliness}} expose children to fewer antigens than in the past, causing their <b>immune</b> <b>systems</b> <b>to</b> become overactive {{and more likely to}} misidentify own tissues as foreign, resulting in autoimmune conditions such as asthma.|$|R
40|$|Bacteria and archaea {{have evolved}} {{sophisticated}} adaptive <b>immune</b> <b>systems</b> that reply on CRISPR loci and a diverse cassette of Cas genes that are classified into three main types {{and at least}} eleven subtypes. All CRISPR-Cas <b>immune</b> <b>systems</b> operate through three main stages: acquisition, biogenesis, and interference. This SnapShot summarizes our current knowledge of these fascinating <b>immune</b> <b>systems.</b> <b>To</b> view this SnapShot, open or download the PDF...|$|R
5|$|The main {{response}} of the <b>immune</b> <b>system</b> <b>to</b> tumors is to destroy the abnormal cells using killer T cells, sometimes {{with the assistance of}} helper T cells. Tumor antigens are presented on MHC class I molecules in a similar way to viral antigens. This allows killer T cells to recognize the tumor cell as abnormal. NK cells also kill tumorous cells in a similar way, especially if the tumor cells have fewer MHC class I molecules on their surface than normal; this is a common phenomenon with tumors. Sometimes antibodies are generated against tumor cells allowing for their destruction by the complement system.|$|E
5|$|Ultimately, HIV causes AIDS by {{depleting}} CD4+ T cells. This {{weakens the}} immune system and allows opportunistic infections. T cells are essential to the immune response and without them, the body cannot fight infections or kill cancerous cells. The mechanism of CD4+ T cell depletion differs in the acute and chronic phases. During the acute phase, HIV-induced cell lysis and killing of infected cells by cytotoxic T cells accounts for CD4+ T cell depletion, although apoptosis may also be a factor. During the chronic phase, the consequences of generalized immune activation coupled with the gradual loss of the ability of the <b>immune</b> <b>system</b> <b>to</b> generate new T cells appear to account for the slow decline in CD4+ T cell numbers.|$|E
5|$|In {{the early}} 1880s, Wallace was {{drawn into the}} debate over {{mandatory}} smallpox vaccination. Wallace originally saw the issue {{as a matter of}} personal liberty; but, after studying some of the statistics provided by anti-vaccination activists, he began to question the efficacy of vaccination. At the time, the germ theory of disease was very new and far from universally accepted. Moreover, no one knew enough about the human <b>immune</b> <b>system</b> <b>to</b> understand why vaccination worked. When Wallace did some research, he discovered instances where supporters of vaccination had used questionable, in a few cases completely phony, statistics to support their arguments. Always suspicious of authority, Wallace suspected that physicians had a vested interest in promoting vaccination, and became convinced that reductions in the incidence of smallpox that had been attributed to vaccination were, in fact, due to better hygiene and improvements in public sanitation.|$|E
5000|$|Allergies are an {{abnormal}} immune reaction. The human <b>immune</b> <b>system</b> is designed <b>to</b> protect {{the body from}} potential harm and in people who have allergies the <b>immune</b> <b>system</b> will react <b>to</b> allergens (substances that trigger an immune response).|$|R
50|$|Clinical immunologists also study ways <b>to</b> {{prevent the}} <b>immune</b> <b>system's</b> {{attempts}} <b>to</b> destroy allografts (transplant rejection).|$|R

5|$|Inflammation {{is one of}} {{the first}} {{responses}} of the <b>immune</b> <b>system</b> <b>to</b> infection. The symptoms of inflammation are redness, swelling, heat, and pain, which are caused by increased blood flow into tissue. Inflammation is produced by eicosanoids and cytokines, which are released by injured or infected cells. Eicosanoids include prostaglandins that produce fever and the dilation of blood vessels associated with inflammation, and leukotrienes that attract certain white blood cells (leukocytes). Common cytokines include interleukins that are responsible for communication between white blood cells; chemokines that promote chemotaxis; and interferons that have anti-viral effects, such as shutting down protein synthesis in the host cell. Growth factors and cytotoxic factors may also be released. These cytokines and other chemicals recruit immune cells to the site of infection and promote healing of any damaged tissue following the removal of pathogens.|$|E
5|$|One area of {{clinical}} research {{is focused on}} treating the underlying disease pathology. Reduction of beta-amyloid levels is a common target of compounds (such as apomorphine) under investigation. Immunotherapy or vaccination for the amyloid protein is one treatment modality under study. Unlike preventative vaccination, the putative therapy {{would be used to}} treat people already diagnosed. It is based upon the concept of training the <b>immune</b> <b>system</b> <b>to</b> recognise, attack, and reverse deposition of amyloid, thereby altering the course of the disease. An example of such a vaccine under investigation was ACC-001, although the trials were suspended in 2008. Another similar agent is bapineuzumab, an antibody designed as identical to the naturally induced anti-amyloid antibody. However, immunotherapeutic agents have been found to cause some concerning adverse drug reactions, such as amyloid-related imaging abnormalities. Other approaches are neuroprotective agents, such as AL-108, and metal-protein interaction attenuation agents, such as PBT2. A TNFα receptor-blocking fusion protein, etanercept has showed encouraging results.|$|E
5|$|Though {{the general}} {{structure}} of all antibodies is very similar, a small region {{at the tip}} of the protein is extremely variable, allowing millions of antibodies with slightly different tip structures, or antigen-binding sites, to exist. This region is known as the hypervariable region. Each of these variants can bind to a different antigen. This enormous diversity of antibody paratopes on the antigen-binding fragments allows the <b>immune</b> <b>system</b> <b>to</b> recognize an equally wide variety of antigens. The large and diverse population of antibody paratope is generated by random recombination events of a set of gene segments that encode different antigen-binding sites (or paratopes), followed by random mutations in this area of the antibody gene, which create further diversity. This recombinational process that produces clonal antibody paratope diversity is called V(D)J or VJ recombination. Basically, the antibody paratope is polygenic, made up of three genes, V, D, and J. Each paratope locus is also polymorphic, such that during antibody production, one allele of V, one of D, and one of J is chosen. These gene segments are then joined together using random genetic recombination to produce the paratope. The regions where the genes are randomly recombined together is the hyper variable region used to recognise different antigens on a clonal basis.|$|E

25|$|A second {{category}} of tactics for fighting viruses involves encouraging the body's <b>immune</b> <b>system</b> <b>to</b> attack them, rather than attacking them directly. Some antivirals {{of this sort}} do not focus on a specific pathogen, instead stimulating the <b>immune</b> <b>system</b> <b>to</b> attack a range of pathogens.|$|E

50|$|Malaria, a {{preventable}} and curable {{disease that}} is heavily prevalent in Africa and is detrimental to African children, is prevalent in Mali. Mali's children especially are susceptible {{not only to}} malaria but also other diseases and parasites, which prompts their <b>immune</b> <b>systems</b> <b>to</b> generate an unusually high number of responses and mechanisms for defense.|$|R
50|$|Soft-boiled {{eggs are}} not {{recommended}} for people who may be susceptible to salmonella, such as very young children, the elderly, and those with weakened <b>immune</b> <b>systems.</b> <b>To</b> avoid the issue of salmonella, eggs can be pasteurised in shell at 57 ºC {{for an hour and}} 15 minutes.

25|$|Cancer {{immunotherapy}} (Immuno-oncology or Immunooncology) {{is the use}} of the <b>immune</b> <b>system</b> <b>to</b> treat cancer. Immunotherapies can {{be categorized}} as active, passive or hybrid (active and passive). These approaches exploit the fact that cancer cells often have molecules on their surface that can be detected by the immune system, known as tumour-associated antigens (TAAs); they are often proteins or other macromolecules (e.g. carbohydrates). Active immunotherapy directs the <b>immune</b> <b>system</b> <b>to</b> attack tumor cells by targeting TAAs. Passive immunotherapies enhance existing anti-tumor responses and include the use of monoclonal antibodies, lymphocytes and cytokines.|$|E
