5000|$|In her solo exhibition, Theory of Flight and Painting (2000) at Woodward Gallery, Morrison's surreal figures {{expressed}} flight {{on several}} levels. The predominant {{figure in the}} paintings is {{man in a white}} lab coat. Morrison's [...] "professor" [...] served as a visual mentor who elucidated flight as a metaphor for life. In her 2003 exhibition, Centricity, Morrison's characters <b>gained</b> <b>life</b> <b>experience.</b> They turned inward, exploring their unique natures while contemplating the paths before them. The white lab coat became a symbol of self-awareness. Morrison's subjects were at different stages of their awakening. Morrison incorporated the rich, early encounters with art history in her body of work entitled, Patron Saints and Rituals (2005). Each of these paintings invited the viewer into a mysterious and complex world where ancient rituals, religious symbolism and contemporary concerns intermingled.|$|E

This is not unique to Germans in the UK: both Scott (2004) and Conradson and Latham (2007), writing respectively about the British in Paris and New Zealanders in London, find the same syndrome: the career is put on hold in favour of broader objectives of enjoying a ‘different’ way of life at a particular life-stage.|$|R

In early 2000, the NUCB Graduate School relocated to a satellite campus in front of Nagoya Station. That same year, Japan's first one-year graduate school in Information Technology was established by the university. In the following year NUCB opened a dedicated graduate school campus at Fushimi, in the heart of the Nagoya financial business district.

Librarians as information professionals are required to play its part in developing this competency. For librarians themselves, this competency become a twofold obligation. First, they have to be information literate so that they can make the most use of information for their own need, for any purposes. Second, they have the obligation to teach this competency to library users, so that they can access, evaluate and use information critically and wisely. The competency itself can be gained through various ways (Bruce, 1997) : including information literacy education. However, in Indonesia, information literacy education for librarians has not been widely available. While information resources proliferate, librarians have not been formally armed with skills to critically harness new formats of information resources. Therefore their information literacy competency development rely more on the knowledge of information skills <b>gained</b> through <b>life</b> <b>experiences.</b> This phenomena can be analyzed by using the sociological perspective of human capital. Through the lens of human capital theory, information literacy is the accumulation of one’s knowledge through general education, training (either general or specific) and other <b>life</b> <b>experiences</b> related to information handling, such as technology use, access to sources of information, etc. These three factors will help individuals develop their information literacy.

40|$|This study {{centers on}} the {{development}} of identity of the Cervantine female and how she comes to form a sense of who she is. The development of identity is accomplished through social interaction and is not inherent in the individual. It is a process that begins early in life, and is ongoing. An individual modifies her own sense of self as she <b>gains</b> different <b>life</b> <b>experiences</b> through interactions with those around her. The development of identity of the Cervantine female is understood by the comments she makes about herself, the comments others make about her, as well as the comments made by the narrator. While Cervantes allows a number of his female protagonists a great deal of freedom to make their own life choices, the patriarchal system of the time places limitations upon the level of autonomy each woman is able to achieve. Another aspect of the female experience that influences her interactions with society is beauty [...] -found both in the physical body as well as in her clothing. Beauty both aids and hinders the level of autonomy each woman is able to claim for herself. Finally, while Cervantes gives a great deal of freedom to some women in his texts, in large part this autonomy is shortlived. There is a direct correlation with the use of voice and the level of autonomy each character is able to maintain for herself. ...|$|R
