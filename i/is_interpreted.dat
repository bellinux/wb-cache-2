5|$|Although many Anahim volcanoes are {{surrounded}} by Chilcotin Group basalt flows, {{the exact nature of}} their relationship is unknown. It is unlikely that the Anahim volcanoes ever were a source area for the Chilcotin basalts as they have distinct transitional geochemistries. The Chilcotin Group <b>is</b> <b>interpreted</b> to be related to back-arc extension behind the Cascadia subduction zone.|$|E
5|$|Ardhanarishvara <b>is</b> <b>interpreted</b> as {{an attempt}} to syncretise the two {{principal}} Hindu sects, Shaivism and Shaktism, dedicated to Shiva and the Great Goddess.

5|$|Franklin {{opposed the}} {{creation}} of the Society because he viewed it, with its hereditary membership, as a noble order unwelcome in the newly independent Republic, contrary to the ideals of Lucius Quinctius Cincinnatus, for whom the Society was named; his reference to the two kinds of birds <b>is</b> <b>interpreted</b> as a satirical comparison between the Society of the Cincinnati and Cincinnatus.|$|E

5|$|The Dinosaur Park Formation <b>is</b> <b>interpreted</b> as a low-relief {{setting of}} rivers and {{floodplains}} that became more swampy and influenced by marine conditions {{over time as}} the Western Interior Seaway transgressed westward. The climate was warmer than present-day Alberta, without frost, but with wetter and drier seasons. Conifers were apparently the dominant canopy plants, with an understory of ferns, tree ferns, and angiosperms.|$|E

5|$|A model {{suggests}} that Enceladus's salty ocean (-Na, -Cl, -CO3) has an alkaline pH of 11 to 12. The high pH <b>is</b> <b>interpreted</b> to be {{a consequence of}} serpentinization of chondritic rock {{that leads to the}} generation of H2, a geochemical source of energy that can support both abiotic and biological synthesis of organic molecules such as those that have been detected in Enceladus's plumes.|$|E

5|$|Allosaurus was {{the most}} common large {{theropod}} in the vast tract of Western American fossil-bearing rock known as the Morrison Formation, accounting for 70 to 75% of theropod specimens, and as such was at the top trophic level of the Morrison food web. The Morrison Formation <b>is</b> <b>interpreted</b> as a semiarid environment with distinct wet and dry seasons, and flat floodplains. Vegetation varied from river-lining forests of conifers, tree ferns, and ferns (gallery forests), to fern savannas with occasional trees such as the Araucaria-like conifer Brachyphyllum.|$|E
5|$|Drones {{can also}} mate with {{existing}} queens by entering a foreign colony. When the drone is initially {{attacked by the}} workers, it releases a mating pheromone. If recognized as a mate, it will be carried to the queen to mate. Males may also patrol the nest and fight others by grabbing them with their mandibles, piercing their exoskeleton and then marking them with a pheromone. The marked male <b>is</b> <b>interpreted</b> as an invader by worker ants and is killed.|$|E
5|$|In biology, a hybrid, or crossbreed, is {{the result}} of {{combining}} the qualities of two organisms of different breeds, varieties, species or genera through sexual reproduction. Hybrids are not always intermediates between their parents (such as in blending inheritance), but can show hybrid vigour, often growing larger or taller than either parent. The concept of a hybrid <b>is</b> <b>interpreted</b> differently in animal and plant breeding, where there is interest in the individual parentage. In genetics, attention is focused on the numbers of chromosomes. In taxonomy, a key question is how closely related the parent species are.|$|E
