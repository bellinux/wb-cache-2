5|$|McQuarrie wrote nine {{drafts of}} his {{screenplay}} over five months, until Singer {{felt that it}} was ready to shop around to the studios. None were interested except for a European <b>financing</b> <b>company.</b> McQuarrie and Singer had a difficult time getting the film made because of the non-linear story, the large amount of dialogue and the lack of cast attached to the project. Financiers wanted established stars, and offers for the small role of Redfoot (the L.A. fence who hooks up the five protagonists with Kobayashi) went out to Christopher Walken, Tommy Lee Jones, Jeff Bridges, Charlie Sheen, James Spader, Al Pacino and Johnny Cash. However, the European money allowed the film's producers to make offers to actors and assemble a cast. They were only able to offer the actors salaries that were well below their usual pay, but they agreed because of the quality of McQuarrie's script and the chance to work with each other. That money fell through, however, and Singer used the script and the cast to attract PolyGram to pick up the film negative.|$|E

Even by 2013, {{nearly half of all}} home mortgages in the city were [...] "underwater", with owners owing more than their houses were worth. On average, homeowners with mortgages were indebted for about 45% more than the original value of their homes. McLaughlin mounted a unique and highly controversial effort to gain control of the mortgages. The city, in partnership with a private <b>financing</b> <b>company,</b> would seek to purchase mortgages from banks at fair market value and then allow the homeowners to refinance for a minimal fee. If the banks refused, the city would seize the mortgages using the legal power of eminent domain.|$|E

40|$|The aims of {{the paper}} are to study the {{financial}} performance between the independent <b>finance</b> <b>companies</b> and the integrated <b>finance</b> <b>companies</b> over the period 2001 - 2011. From total 194 <b>finance</b> <b>companies</b> in the industry, the <b>finance</b> <b>companies</b> who affiliate with bank or automotive manufacturer are 65 companies that contribute to 71 % of total asset of the industry. The banking industry that provides majority of funding, has made <b>finance</b> <b>companies</b> {{as part of their}} integration business model. The automotive manufacturers and dealers that provide the products of financing, have the similar strategy. The acquisition of <b>finance</b> <b>companies</b> has reached more than 30 transactions from 2002 until 2012. We analyzed seven micro key financial ratios (profitability, efficiency, growth, firm size, liquidity, solvability and risk). We use non parametric Mann Whitney and parametric Panel Data Dummy Regression. Our sample consists of 100 <b>finance</b> <b>companies</b> which continuously published their financial statement from 2001 until 2011. The empirical results show that the integrated <b>finance</b> <b>companies</b> are better in efficiency, profitability, size and growth.

2500|$|Scarfo also {{allegedly}} {{was involved}} in the financial takeover FirstPlus Financial Group and the embezzlement of millions of dollars from the company. FirstPlus Financial is a Texas-based mortgage <b>financing</b> <b>company</b> which was very active in the mortgage industry until a financial downturn left it mostly moribund in the late 1990s. The company drew federal attention in 2006 when it suddenly became very active again. On May 8, 2008, the Federal Bureau of Investigation conducted a series of raids on the company, its subsidiaries, several other companies, a number of FirstPlus' corporate officers, and several private citizens. The financial records of Nicky Scarfo Jr., his ex-wife, Michele Scarfo-Winkler, his infant son Nicodemo Scarfo III, and Salvatore Pelullo (a businessman with convictions for bank and wire fraud) were also seized. Law enforcement officials also found two handguns at Scarfo's home; as a convicted felon, Scarfo could be charged with felony unlawful possession of a firearm. Based on the seized documents, federal prosecutors alleged that Scarfo and Pelullo took control of FirstPlus Financial Group in June 2007 and [...] "transferred several million dollars between June 2007 and May 2008 to corporate entities controlled by Pelullo and Scarfo Jr." [...] A later estimate put the amount of stolen money at $4.86 million. Federal prosecutors believe that Scarfo, Pelullo, and FirstPlus Financial officers engaged in bank fraud, mail fraud, wire fraud, interstate transportation of stolen property, and money laundering. They also accused Scarfo of using the bank to make numerous real estate deals, including the purchase of his Egg Harbor Township home. Scarfo's close friend and associate, Andrew Merola, was sentenced in late October 2010 to 10 to 12 years in prison for fraud, extortion, labor racketeering, loan-sharking, and sports betting. Law enforcement authorities revealed that some of the 39,000 wiretapped conversations in the Merola case include discussions of Scarfo's allegedly illegal activities concerning FirstPlus.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{examines}} whether auditors bear {{any negative}} {{consequence of the}} failures of <b>finance</b> <b>companies</b> in New Zealand. More than 60 <b>finance</b> <b>companies</b> failed since 2006 and these failures imposed massive financial loss on the investors. There is a wide perception of audit failure {{in the case of}} these failed <b>finance</b> <b>companies.</b> Therefore, it is important to examine whether there is evidence of poor audit quality in the case of failed <b>finance</b> <b>companies.</b> It is also important to investigate, from the perspective of audit theory and public policy, whether the auditors of these failed <b>finance</b> <b>companies</b> were punished after the failures. The study examines two consequences for the auditors – disciplinary actions against the auditors by Chartered Accountants Australia and New Zealand and client loss. The paper also examines whether the auditor has been sued after the failure of any <b>finance</b> <b>company.</b> The sample is comprised of 37 failed <b>finance</b> <b>companies</b> for which annual reports were available on the website of Companies Office New Zealand. The study finds that auditors who gave unmodified audit opinions are not more likely to face disciplinary actions than those who gave unmodified audit opinions with going concern explanation paragraphs and modified audit opinions. Furthermore, the study utilizes auditor turnover of public listed companies in New Zealand to test another consequence of <b>finance</b> <b>company</b> failures for the auditors – client loss. While there is no significant relationship between disciplinary actions and auditor turnover, a statistically significant relationship is observed between <b>finance</b> <b>company</b> failure and auditor turnover. The study also analyses litigation effect on auditors who involved with <b>finance</b> <b>company</b> failures. Under the primary liability rule – joint and several liability – in New Zealand, auditor is held liable for the loss of the client. The results of this study will be of interest to practitioners, standard setters and law makers, and will fill the literature gap on the impacts of corporate failures on auditors...|$|R
