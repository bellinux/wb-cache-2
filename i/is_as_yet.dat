5|$|A twelfth {{specimen}} {{had been}} discovered by amateur collectors in 2010 at the Schamhaupten quarry, but the finding was only announced in February 2014. It <b>is</b> <b>as</b> <b>yet</b> not scientifically described.|$|E
5|$|Nothing {{is known}} of the {{conditions}} that affect its distribution, as its biogeography <b>is</b> <b>as</b> <b>yet</b> unstudied. An assessment of {{the potential impact of}} climate change on this species found that its range is likely to contract by half in the face of severe change, but unlikely to change much under less severe scenarios.|$|E
5|$|There <b>is</b> <b>as</b> <b>yet</b> no {{explanation}} for why similar abnormal parenting may produce the two distinct forms of the disorder, inhibited and disinhibited. The issue of temperament and its influence {{on the development of}} attachment disorders has yet to be resolved. RAD has never been reported in the absence of serious environmental adversity yet outcomes for children raised in the same environment vary widely.|$|E

5|$|There <b>is</b> <b>as</b> <b>yet</b> no universally {{accepted}} diagnostic protocol for reactive attachment disorder. Often {{a range of}} measures is used in research and diagnosis. Recognized assessment methods of attachment styles, difficulties or disorders include the Strange Situation Procedure (devised by developmental psychologist Mary Ainsworth), the separation and reunion procedure and the Preschool Assessment of Attachment, the Observational Record of the Caregiving Environment, the Attachment Q-sort {{and a variety of}} narrative techniques using stem stories, puppets or pictures. For older children, actual interviews such as the Child Attachment Interview and the Autobiographical Emotional Events Dialogue can be used. Caregivers may also be assessed using procedures such as the Working Model of the Child Interview.|$|E
5|$|A {{study of}} coastal heaths on Pleistocene sand dunes around the Myall Lakes found B.aemula grew on ridges (dry heath) and B. oblongifolia on slopes (wet heath), {{and the two}} species did not overlap. Manipulation of {{seedlings}} in the same study area showed that B. aemula grows longer roots seeking water and that seedlings do grow in wet heath, but it <b>is</b> <b>as</b> <b>yet</b> unclear why the species does not grow in wet heath as well as dry heath. Unlike similar situations with banksia species in Western Australia, the two species {{did not appear to}} impact negatively on each other. A field study on seedling recruitment conducted at Broadwater National Park and Dirrawong Reserve on the New South Wales North Coast showed that generally Banksia aemula produced seedlings in low numbers but the attrition rate was low, and that seedlings had a greater survival rate on dry rather than wet heaths. Field work including the experimental planting out of seedlings at Crowdy Bay National Park showed that Banksia aemula seedling roots reach the water table within six months of germination, and that they can germinate in {{the presence or absence of}} recent bushfire. The reasons for bradyspory (that is fewer seeds with greater percentage of survival) is unclear, but may be a defence against seed-eating animals. Similarly in field work on North Stradbroke Island, B.aemula was noted to shed its winged seeds over time between (as well as after) fire, and germinate and grow readily with little predation by herbivores.|$|E
5|$|Some {{authors have}} {{proposed}} a broader continuum of definitions of attachment disorders ranging from RAD through various attachment difficulties to the more problematic attachment styles. There <b>is</b> <b>as</b> <b>yet</b> no consensus, on this issue but {{a new set of}} practice parameters containing three categories of attachment disorder has been proposed by C.H. Zeanah and N. Boris. The first of these is disorder of attachment, in which a young child has no preferred adult caregiver. The proposed category of disordered attachment is parallel to RAD in its inhibited and disinhibited forms, as defined in DSM and ICD. The second category is secure base distortion, where the child has a preferred familiar caregiver, but the relationship is such that the child cannot use the adult for safety while gradually exploring the environment. Such children may endanger themselves, cling to the adult, be excessively compliant, or show role reversals in which they care for or punish the adult. The third type is disrupted attachment. Disrupted attachment is not covered under ICD-10 and DSM criteria, and results from an abrupt separation or loss of a familiar caregiver to whom attachment has developed. This form of categorisation may demonstrate more clinical accuracy overall than the current DSM-IV-TR classification, but further research is required. The practice parameters would also provide the framework for a diagnostic protocol. Most recently, Daniel Schechter and Erica Willheim have shown a relationship between some maternal violence-related posttraumatic stress disorder and secure base distortion (see above) which is characterized by child recklessness, separation anxiety, hypervigilance, and role-reversal.|$|E

25|$|Within {{mainstream}} practice, disorders {{of attachment}} are classified in DSM-IV-TR and ICD-10 as reactive attachment disorder (generally known as RAD), and Disinhibited attachment disorder.

25|$|Bristles are stiff, {{tapering}} feathers {{with a large}} rachis but few barbs. Rictal bristles {{are found}} around the eyes and bill.
