500|$|Stay Trippy {{was ranked}} number 20 on Spins {{list of the}} 40 best hip hop albums of 2013. They commented saying, [...] "this is {{basically}} what the Juiceman's been doing for 20 years — self-producing albums of bellowing bass, eerie synths, and shouted slogans. <b>It</b> <b>helps</b> <b>that</b> his sound helped spawn wildly popular things like Atlanta trap and Chicago drill; <b>it</b> <b>helps</b> <b>that</b> Wiz Khalifa helped him acquire the budget to get an absolutely monstrous low end; and <b>it</b> <b>helps</b> <b>that</b> we're not sick of [...] "Bandz a Make Her Dance." [...] It was also positioned at number 27 on Complexs list of the 50 best albums of 2013. They said, [...] "armed with an endless barrage of rattling beats, {{and a host of}} just-so-over-the-top-ridiculous-you-have-to-laugh punchlines, and enough believable gangsta talk to separate himself from the good kids of today's rap scene, Stay Trippy is the perfect explanation for why Juicy has been rich since the '90s." [...] XXL ranked it at number 13 on their list of the best albums of 2014.|$|E
500|$|Both {{episodes of}} [...] "Lecture Circuit" [...] {{received}} generally positive reviews. Whitney Pastorek of Entertainment Weekly described them as [...] "nearly perfect", calling them {{the two best}} episodes of the season so far: [...] " [...] nailed the characterizations, the interactions, the tossed-off one-liners, the weird-yet-realistic scenarios...I wonder how much <b>it</b> <b>helps</b> <b>that</b> she's out on the acting floor every day, getting attuned to her costars' rhythms?" [...] Josh McAuliffe of The Times-Tribune of Scranton, Pennsylvania, said the first [...] "Lecture Circuit" [...] episode was his favorite episode of the fifth season so far, which he said provided several laugh-out-loud moments and a poignancy with Michael's decision to find Holly. McAuliffe described the second episode as a [...] "satisfying wrap-up" [...] and said Michael's outburst during the lecture was [...] "one of the most painful Michael meltdown moments in the show's history". Alan Sepinwall of The Star-Ledger said the first episode perfectly balanced drama and comedy. He particularly complimented the chemistry between both Carell and Fischer and between Krasinski and Wilson, {{and said he was}} particularly pleased to receive closure over the Karen character. But Sepinwall said the second episode felt padded with [...] "material I would have been fine seeing as deleted scenes". Although he said Carell's reaction to the news that Holly still has feelings for him as a [...] "wonderful performance", Sepinwall also said the subplot involving Angela's cat was particularly unfunny and that subplot with Jim and Dwight, [...] "so brilliant last week, ran out of steam quickly here." ...|$|E
500|$|Stankonia {{received}} widespread acclaim {{from contemporary}} music critics. At Metacritic, which assigns a normalized rating out of 100 to reviews from mainstream critics, the album received an average score of 95, based on 20 reviews. Derek A. Bardowell of NME noted that with Stankonia, OutKast [...] "hit that rare balance of creative eccentricity and mass appeal" [...] and {{wrote that the}} album contains [...] "eternal qualities that will unravel in time on an emotional, intellectual and spiritual level." [...] Nathan Brackett of Rolling Stone called the record [...] "one of the best albums of the year" [...] noting {{that all of the}} tracks contain [...] "a down-home generosity and accessibility" [...] and that [...] "even the most street-oriented songs have some sort of commentary in them." [...] Tony Green of The Village Voice praised OutKast's [...] "feel for sonics and structure" [...] and stated, [...] "they've moved toward harder, darker textures, in service of song designs that are often disarmingly subtle." [...] Steve Huey of AllMusic commented that, [...] "given the variety of moods, <b>it</b> <b>helps</b> <b>that</b> the album is broken up by brief, usually humorous interludes, which serve as a sort of reset button. It takes a few listens to pull everything together, but given the immense scope, it's striking how few weak tracks there are". Aishah Hight of PopMatters stated, [...] "Within Stankonia, Outkast successfully presented a southern perspective of life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness. But on the surface, phat beats and pure funk should suffice." [...] Alternative Press commented that [...] "experienced, acclaimed groups rarely make albums as bold and confrontational as Stankonia, because they have too much to lose", but felt that [...] "OutKast don't care", writing that they [...] "coalesced the political and societal challenges of hip hop's past into what is one of the genre's most artistically unorthodox releases so far." ...|$|E
50|$|Serious' key {{collaborators}} in {{the movie}} were co-writer David Roach, co-producer Warwick Rodd and associate producer Lulu Pinkus. He has said <b>it</b> <b>helped</b> <b>that</b> they all shared the same vision for the movie which got them through the long production process.|$|R
50|$|Barney {{estimated}} {{that on this}} voyage he had captured 3698 tons of British shipping, worth US$1.5 million. He also had captured 217 prisoners. Of course, <b>it</b> <b>helped</b> <b>that</b> many of the vessels that he captured {{did not know that}} the war had begun.|$|R
50|$|Dragonlance: Fifth Age was {{met with}} mixed feeling as {{there were a lot}} of changes to the setting. <b>It</b> <b>helped</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> was using an entirely new system, but most of the {{complaints}} seem to have been about the setting changes. There were those who liked it because it moved the setting forward.|$|R
2500|$|However, our {{dependence}} on fossilized skeletons also significantly limits our understanding of evolution. Only the parts of organisms that were already mineralized are usually preserved, such as the shells of molluscs. <b>It</b> <b>helps</b> <b>that</b> exoskeletons often contain [...] "muscle scars", marks where muscles have been attached to the exoskeleton, which may allow the reconstruction of much of an organism's internal parts from its exoskeleton alone. The most significant limitation is that, although there are 30-plus phyla of living animals, two-thirds of these phyla have never been found as fossils, because most animal species are soft-bodied and decay before they can become fossilized.|$|E
2500|$|Then Guardian {{features}} editor Ian Katz asserted in 2004 that [...] "it is {{no secret}} we are a centre-left newspaper". In 2008, Guardian columnist Jackie Ashley said that editorial contributors were a mix of [...] "right-of-centre libertarians, greens, Blairites, Brownites, Labourite but less enthusiastic Brownites, etc," [...] and that the newspaper was [...] "clearly left of centre and vaguely progressive". She also said that [...] "you can be absolutely certain that come the next general election, The Guardian stance will not be dictated by the editor, still less any foreign proprietor (<b>it</b> <b>helps</b> <b>that</b> there isn't one) but will {{be the result of}} vigorous debate within the paper". The paper's comment and opinion pages, though often written by centre-left contributors such as Polly Toynbee, have allowed some space for right-of-centre voices such as Sir Max Hastings and Michael Gove. Since an editorial in 2000, The Guardian has favoured abolition of the British monarchy. [...] "I write for the Guardian," [...] said Max Hastings in 2005, [...] "because it is read by the new establishment," [...] reflecting the paper's then-growing influence.|$|E
2500|$|Ceremonials {{was named}} the best album of 2011 by Q {{magazine}}. Time magazine ranked it as the second best album of 2011, stating, [...] "Despite her penchant for emotive gloom, Welch's tales of heartache can be oddly uplifting; when she sings about darkness and demons, we know she will ultimately conquer them." [...] Entertainment Weekly, on its list of the 10 Best Albums of 2011, listed the album at number five and wrote, [...] "A big believer in Red Sea-parting melodrama, she's got the orchestral grandeur to pull it off. Of course, <b>it</b> <b>helps</b> <b>that</b> she attacks the harp {{as if she were}} wielding an ax." [...] Billboard placed it at number eight on its list of the 10 Best Albums of 2011, noting that [...] "Shake It Out" [...] and [...] "What the Water Gave Me" [...] "possess an anthemic quality, but they're far from the only epic moments on the rock-tinged record, which finds Welch channeling avant-pop luminaries like Annie Lennox and Kate Bush." [...] Slant Magazine included Ceremonials at number 22 on its list of The 25 Best Albums of 2011, commenting that the album is [...] "steeped in melodrama, with pump organs, choirs, and strings expertly deployed as pure pomp on already rousing singles like 'Shake It Out' and 'No Light, No Light.' But Welch is perfectly capable of doing delicate too, as evidenced by the gorgeously textured lead single 'What the Water Gave Me' and 'Never Let Me Go,' while tracks like [...] "Lover to Lover" [...] are reminiscent of the Eurythmics at their most soulful." [...] PopMatters ranked the album at number 25 on its list of The 75 Best Albums of 2011, calling it [...] "an expansive album, haunted by tragedy but boldly offering a comforting embrace in reply." ...|$|E
50|$|Eventually, {{the name}} of Zurdok Movimento began to make the rounds and had a buzz going within the {{different}} transnational label companies. <b>It</b> <b>helped</b> <b>that</b> the executives of the companies started {{to care about the}} music of the north of Mexico and signing to Zurdok Movimento with Discos Manicomio, then a subdivision of Polygram.|$|R

50|$|Though some Marx Brothers {{fans were}} appalled at these changes, Thalberg was vindicated {{when the film}} became a solid hit. <b>It</b> <b>helped</b> <b>that</b> the film {{contained}} some of what fans {{consider to be the}} brothers' funniest routines. These routines were honed on stage, as the brothers performed the new material on the road before filming began.|$|R
2500|$|However, {{some critics}} viewed the album's sound as unoriginal and dated. Johnny Dee of Virgin Media said [...] "Flesh Tone marks a thrilling {{comeback}} ... The only complaint {{is that at}} 9 tracks it feels a little light." [...] Slant Magazine's Sal Cinquenmani was more critical of Kelis' direction towards dance music, stating that the album [...] "sounds dated in {{the worst kind of}} way—that is, not enough to sound retro-cool, but enough to sound totally uncool. <b>It</b> <b>helps</b> <b>that</b> the album ... segued together with interludes that are more interesting than the actual songs. Flesh Tone should sound desperate, but it often sounds inspired instead. Kelis seems electrified by her new genre shift, and the result is an album that's one of her most consistent to date." [...] Kaya Burgess of The Times pointed out that 'Acapella' and 'Home' are the only tracks which [...] "stand out from an otherwise rather copy-and-paste collection of electronic numbers". Magaret Wappler of Los Angeles Times expressed that Kelis has managed to [...] "make a spirited but disciplined set of classic Euro-club bangers. Sometimes they're darkly contemplative, slipping into trance; other times they nearly rip at the seams ... it's clear that Kelis has carved out a new niche for herself, dancing in front of the turntables till the lights come on, if they dare." [...] Sam Richards of Uncut complimented its fusion of [...] "R sass to thumping club beats" [...] and stated [...] "most everything Kelis touches drips with class". Gavin Haynes of the NME felt that [...] "Flesh Tone has already filled out an application form for pop record of the year" [...] and stated, [...] "Her ability to appear unimpeachably cool hasn't wavered either. But these are as nothing. What's important here is simply her direction: a genuinely innovative bearing that breaks new ground for pop without sounding any less pop for it. Kelis. Genius. Pop auteur." ...|$|E

50|$|Silly's first notable concert {{appearances}} outside East Germany were in Romania, {{where the}} band gained a strong following; <b>it</b> <b>helped</b> <b>that</b> Fritzsching and Danz could speak Romanian fluently.

50|$|With Ninoy and {{his wife}} Cory Aquino in exile in Boston, the {{remaining}} children took drastic steps in ensuring that the hacienda continued to exist and operate. To maximize the productivity of sugar and therefore profitability, {{a certain level of}} economy must be reached. Thus the Jose Cojuangcos tried their best to keep the Luisita in one piece. They refurbished and re-used old 1950s era farm machines and tools, doubled capacity production and maintained low expenses. There were a lot of reasons why Luisita remained in the hands of Jose Cojuangco's children. One, <b>it</b> <b>helped</b> <b>that</b> their cousin Danding Cojuangco was the de facto kingpin of Tarlac and his kind mother Josephine Murphy-Cojuangco was still cordial to them. For Marcos to touch Hacienda Luisita he also would have to force Agrarian Reform into the Ysidra Cojuangco haciendas which were under the supervision of Danding Cojuangco. Thus, many haciendas around Luisita were hacked to smaller pieces such as those of the De Leóns, Escalers, Urquicos, Arrastrias, Quiasóns and Gonzálezes but not those of the Cojuangcos. Two, <b>it</b> <b>helped</b> <b>that</b> the price of sugar spiraled so high because of President Marcos and Roberto Benedicto manipulating the sugar prices primarily in Negros Occidental. Third, Ninoy Aquino was not in the Philippines lambasting Marcos in the underground movements. For as long as the Marcoses heard less of Don Pepe’s son-in-law, the less government pressure there was on the José Cojuangcos. Most importantly, <b>it</b> <b>helped</b> <b>that</b> most of the farm workers who remember Pepe understood the frugality measures his children had to implement.|$|R

50|$|Micklin is a tough-as-nails {{maintenance}} {{line chief}} {{who has the}} unenviable job of keeping the squadron's 20 Chance Vought F4U Corsair fighter planes operational, despite a constant shortage of parts and supplies. Micklin is ill-tempered, gruff, loud and occasionally violent. His commanding officer, Pappy Boyington (Conrad) tolerates this because Micklin is a master at his job and keeps the planes in good repair. <b>It</b> <b>helps</b> <b>that</b> Pappy is just as visceral as Micklin.|$|E
50|$|Kat {{has been}} the victim of {{repeated}} sexual assault and has had enough. Along with her group of mates, she has decided that since the law won't hand out any justice, then it's time to take matters into her own hands and distribute some payback on her own terms. <b>It</b> <b>helps</b> <b>that</b> one of her friends has a disused barn on her isolate property that should afford some privacy from prying eyes.|$|E
50|$|Tsou {{language}} is {{recognized by the}} government. The government has allocated money dedicated to bring language programs to elementary and junior high schools, but the funds are sometimes inconsistent, which negatively affects the programs. <b>It</b> <b>helped</b> <b>that</b> the Martial law was lifted in 1987 and that people could freely speak their native languages again, however, so many other dominant languages were used that several native indigenous languages disappeared.|$|R

5000|$|Mark Kennedy of The Associated Press {{wrote in}} his review, [...] "This is a musical that hits all the right spots, {{achieving}} something close to Broadway grace. <b>It</b> <b>helps</b> <b>that</b> the musical has great original tunes by songwriter Alan Menken and lyricist Glenn Slater that skitters from Motown, to soul and funk, to disco and even a little jokey Barry White.

In theory too much ice means running out of liquid water while the bladder still has ice occupying space that could have been filled by more water (so it helps to take account of how temperature and humidity affect the balance between consumption rate and melting rate), but <b>it</b> <b>helps</b> <b>that</b> most people's tendency seems to be to put in less ice than would last through the hike.|$|E

5000|$|In the book, Huxley tackles {{the subject}} of {{evolution}} at full length, in what became the defining work of his life.

50|$|When {{the creators}} {{introduced}} Tom as a recurring character, {{they were already}} suspecting, that Russell Tovey (George Sands) would leave the series at some point. Being Human was a show with a low budget and people responsible for other, bigger productions would notice the actors. They wanted to prepare themselves for the inevitability of Tovey leaving the series. Introducing another werewolf character before Tovey thought of leaving the show would <b>help</b> to move <b>that</b> character in. When Tovey actually left the show the production team decided that Tom {{should be one of}} the main characters in the new series, taking over Russell's role. <b>It</b> <b>helped</b> <b>that</b> the dynamic between Socha, Crichlow (Annie Sawyer) and Molony (Hal Yorke) was good. At first When Socha got the main role he was nervous about being compared to his predecessor Russell Tovey. <b>It</b> <b>helped</b> <b>that</b> Tom was a completely different character from Tovey’s George. In an interview with Young Hollywood at 21 November 2013 Socha said that playing Tom was a challenge for him because Tom is very different from himself, but he really enjoyed it. For Socha, it was his favourite role to play.|$|R
