5|$|In the B story, April (Aubrey Plaza) {{is working}} as Chris' (Rob Lowe) {{assistant}} until <b>he</b> <b>goes</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> Indianapolis. April's cynical personality clashes with Chris' relentless optimism and happiness. In {{an attempt to}} get fired, April purposely neglects to tell Ann (Rashida Jones) that Chris cannot make a lunch date. When Ann arrives to confront Chris, she quickly realizes April's ploy. Ann reveals she is very happy dating Chris, and would even probably move with him to Indianapolis if asked. Andy (Chris Pratt), who is still trying to win back April's affections, gives Chris an obviously forged letter from the FBI claiming April must immediately return to the parks department. Chris sees through the ruse and tells April she can go back, but that remaining his assistant may provide her career opportunities. He invites her to return with him to Indianapolis and she seems interested, leaving both Ann and Andy stunned and jealous.|$|E

The hotel room explodes behind him. <b>He</b> <b>goes</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> the wrecked room, {{assuming}} Selma is dead, {{but she is}} unscathed and the Simpsons are waiting for him along with the police. Bart explains how he deduced Sideshow Bob's plot: Sideshow Bob opened the gas valve in the room knowing Selma would not smell the leak, then left while she watched MacGyver, knowing that Selma would light a cigarette afterwards and cause an explosion. Sideshow Bob asks why the room still exploded if Bart foiled his plot, to which Chief Wiggum explains that he absent-mindedly threw a match into the room after smoking a celebratory cigar. Sideshow Bob is taken away by the police, vowing revenge.|$|E

Although he does have some wonderful moments earlier in the episode, when he goes back inside he turns into this incredibly fearful, stuttering fellow that we saw when we first met him.

500|$|Though {{the film}} is presumed lost, a {{synopsis}} survives in The Moving Picture World from September 10, 1910. It states: [...] "The play deals with Will Allen, a country lad, who is unhappy at home, owing {{to the fact that}} he is a studious little chap and prefers his books to farm work, which incurs the displeasure and enmity of his stepfather, a rough and surly farmer, to whom book learning does not appeal. Will runs away from home, and although his mother keeps a light in the window, hoping to guide her boy home, he never returns. Twenty years later, when the boy has made a place for himself in the world as a successful lawyer, <b>he</b> <b>goes</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> the farm, only to find that his little mother, who has been left a widow, has gone away, whither, no one knows. The mother, in the meantime, being left alone in the world, goes to the city and there supports herself by dressmaking. While shopping in a department store she is unjustly accused of shoplifting. The only person who believes in her innocence is a salesgirl, who is discharged for her presumption and daring to correct her superiors. The girl, in her efforts to help the friendless old lady, enlists the aid of Will, whom she knows to be a lawyer of great ability. Will is about to refuse the case, as the dry goods company is a client of his, when the girl describes the lonely old lady, and begs him for the sake of his mother to befriend her. Will consents. Will's clear statement of the case to the judge, together with May's testimony, frees the mother. When her counsel approaches to offer his congratulations, mutual recognition results." ...|$|E

500|$|... 808s & Heartbreak {{received}} generally positive {{reviews from}} critics. At Metacritic, which assigns a normalized rating out of 100 to reviews from mainstream publications, the album received an average score of 75, based on 36 reviews. Chris Richards from The Washington Post called it [...] "an information-age masterpiece", while USA Today critic Steve Jones said [...] "West deftly uses the 808 drum machine and Auto-Tune vocal effect to channel his feelings of hurt, anger and doubt through his well-crafted lyrics". Dan Cairns from The Times stated, [...] "This so should not work...Yet 808s & Heartbreak is a triumph, recklessly departing from the commercially copper-bottomed script and venturing far beyond West’s comfort zone." [...] Rolling Stones Jody Rosen commended West's {{incorporation of the}} Roland TR-808 drum machine and described the album as [...] "Kanye's would-be Here, My Dear or Blood on the Tracks, a mournful song-suite that swings violently between self-pity and self-loathing". In the Chicago Tribune, Greg Kot called it West's [...] "most radical yet" [...] and said while West's fans may be disappointed, [...] "this one is for him. It {{remains to be seen}} if <b>he</b> <b>goes</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> making records for everybody else. For now, this is one fascinatingly perverse detour." [...] PopMatters critic Dave Heaton was impressed by West's [...] "song and album construction, and with the way he captures a particular feeling through unusual, evocative, carefully crafted music that’s both simple and complex, cold and warm, mechanical and human, melodic and harsh". Writing for MSN Music, Robert Christgau found it [...] "brilliant" [...] with a unique [...] "dark sound" [...] and [...] "engaging tunes", despite a second-half drop-off, and praised West's use of Auto-Tune, which he felt [...] "both undercuts his self-importance and adds physical reality to tales of alienated fame that might otherwise be pure pity parties".|$|E

[...] Cass's last paper, [...] "Utility-based utility" [...] was under revision {{at the time of his}} death. [...] This paper is also conceptual in nature in showing that sunspot equilibria could exist under weaker specifications of preferences than the standard von Neumann-Morgenstern specification.|$|E
