25|$|Bhagavad Gita As <b>It</b> <b>Is</b> <b>is</b> a Russian {{version of}} the International Society for Krishna Consciousness (ISKCON) founder A. C. Bhaktivedanta Swami Prabhupada's {{translation}} and commentaries on the Bhagavad Gita, a revered scripture for nearly one billion Hindus. The book, a central scripture for Hare Krishna followers, was first published by the Bhaktivedanta Book Trust in 1968 and has been translated into 80 languages, with over 100 million copies distributed globally till date. According to scholars, the book has never been accused of fomenting extremism before. According to ISKCON, in 2004 and 2005 Moscow state prosecutors found no extremism in the previous edition Bhagavad Gita As It Is, which had only slight stylistic differences from the one on trial.|$|E
25|$|According to tradition, Jewish men, {{married or}} not, must cover their heads. The most common head {{covering}} is the kippah (Hebrew: skull cap), known as yarmulke in Yiddish. Orthodox men wear something {{on their heads}} at almost all times, while non-Orthodox men may cover their heads only when performing some religious act, or when eating. Few cover the entire head. Almost all will bathe with the head uncovered, but sleeping varies by community or family practice. The exact nature of this practice, and how binding <b>it</b> <b>is,</b> <b>is</b> a matter of dispute among halakhic authorities. Wearing a hat is not required by Jewish law, and those who wear a hat always wear a kippah underneath; however, there are some rabbis, especially in Hasidic Judaism, who require a double head covering - of kippah and hat or tallis - during prayer.|$|E
500|$|Putnam has {{clarified}} {{that his}} real target in this argument was never skepticism, but metaphysical realism. Since realism {{of this kind}} assumes {{the existence of a}} gap between how man conceives the world and the way the world really is, skeptical scenarios such as this one (or Descartes' Evil demon) present a formidable challenge. Putnam, by arguing that such a scenario is impossible, attempts to show that this notion of a gap between man's concept {{of the world and the}} way <b>it</b> <b>is,</b> <b>is</b> in itself absurd. Man cannot have a [...] "God's eye" [...] view of reality. He is limited to his conceptual schemes. Metaphysical realism is therefore false, according to Putnam.|$|E

500|$|I cannot {{withhold}} my compliments {{from the}} government for the policy of complete non interference adopted by them throughout the march .... I wish I could believe this non-interference was due to any real change of heart or policy. The wanton disregard shown by them to popular feeling in the Legislative Assembly and their high-handed action leave no room for doubt that the policy of heartless exploitation of India is to be persisted in at any cost, and so the only interpretation I can put upon this non-interference is that the British Government, powerful though <b>it</b> <b>is,</b> <b>is</b> sensitive to world opinion which will not tolerate repression of extreme political agitation which civil disobedience undoubtedly is, so long as disobedience remains civil and therefore necessarily non-violent .... It {{remains to be seen whether}} the Government will tolerate as they have tolerated the march, the actual breach of the salt laws by countless people from tomorrow.|$|E

2500|$|He {{has been}} {{described}} as a charismatic leader, in the sense used by sociologist Max Weber, as he was successful in acquiring followers in the United States, Europe, India and elsewhere. His mission was to propagate, throughout the world, Krishna Consciousness that had been taught to him by his guru, Bhaktisiddhanta Sarasvati. After his death in 1977, ISKCON, the society he founded based on Bhagavad-Gītā As It Is of Bhagavata Purana as a central scripture, continued to grow. In February 2014, ISKCON's news agency reported reaching a milestone of distributing over half a billion of his books since 1965. [...] His translation and commentaries of the Bhagavad-Gītā As <b>It</b> <b>Is</b> <b>is</b> considered by adherents to the ISKCON movement and many Vedic scholars as one of the finest literary works of Vaishnavism translated into the English Language.|$|E
2500|$|According to Dr. Kieser, {{a lot of}} work on Henneguya salminicola {{was done}} by {{scientists}} at the Pacific Biological Station in Nanaimo in the mid-1980s, in particular, an overview report which states, [...] "the fish that have the longest fresh water residence time as juveniles have the most noticeable infections. Hence in order of prevalence coho are most infected followed by sockeye, chinook, chum and pink." [...] As well, the report says, at the time the studies were conducted, stocks from the middle and upper reaches of large river systems in British Columbia such as Fraser, Skeena, Nass and from mainland coastal streams in the southern half of B.C., [...] "are {{more likely to have a}} low prevalence of infection." [...] The report also states, [...] "It should be stressed that Henneguya, economically deleterious though <b>it</b> <b>is,</b> <b>is</b> harmless from the view of public health. It is strictly a fish parasite that cannot live in or affect warm blooded animals, including man".|$|E
2500|$|Not all metal {{required}} fire {{to obtain}} it or work it. Isaac Asimov speculated that gold was the [...] "first metal". His reasoning {{is that by}} its chemistry it is found in nature as nuggets of pure gold. In other words, gold, as rare as <b>it</b> <b>is,</b> <b>is</b> sometimes found in nature as the metal that it is. [...] There are a few other metals that sometimes occur natively, {{and as a result}} of meteors. Almost all other metals are found in ores, a mineral-bearing rock, that require heat or some other process to liberate the metal. Another feature of gold is that it is workable as it is found, meaning that no technology beyond a stone hammer and anvil to work the metal is needed. [...] This is a result of gold's properties of malleability and ductility. The earliest tools were stone, bone, wood, and sinew, all of which sufficed to work gold.|$|E

2500|$|He {{attributed}} the [...] "great {{break in the}} organic chain between man and his nearest allies" [...] to extinction, and as spreading civilisation wiped out wildlife and native human cultures, the gap would widen to somewhere [...] "between man in a more civilised state, as we may hope, than the Caucasian, and some ape as low as a baboon, instead of as at present between the negro or Australian and the gorilla." [...] While there [...] "can {{be no doubt that}} the difference between the mind of the lowest man and that of the highest animal is immense", the [...] "difference in mind between man and the higher animals, great as <b>it</b> <b>is,</b> <b>is</b> certainly one of degree and not of kind." [...] At the same time, all human races had many mental similarities, and early artefacts showing shared culture were evidence of evolution through common descent from an ancestral species which was likely to have been fully human.|$|E
2500|$|Chinese {{mathematics}} made early contributions, {{including a}} place value system. [...] The geometrical theorem {{known to the}} ancient Chinese were acquainted was applicable in certain cases (namely the ratio of sides). It is that geometrical theorems which can be demonstrated in the quasi-experimental way of superposition were also known to them. In arithmetic their knowledge {{seems to have been}} confined to the art of calculation by means of the swan-pan, and the power of expressing the results in writing. Our knowledge of the early attainments of the Chinese, slight though <b>it</b> <b>is,</b> <b>is</b> more complete than in the case of most of their contemporaries. It is thus instructive, and serves to illustrate the fact, that it can be known a nation may possess considerable skill in the applied arts with but our knowledge of the later mathematics on which those arts are founded can be scarce. Knowledge of Chinese mathematics before 254 BC is somewhat fragmentary, and even after this date the manuscript traditions are obscure. Dates centuries before the classical period are generally considered conjectural by Chinese scholars unless accompanied by verified archaeological evidence.|$|E
2500|$|After {{these three}} novels, Beckett {{struggled}} {{for many years}} to produce a sustained work of prose, a struggle evidenced by the brief [...] "stories" [...] later collected as Texts for Nothing. In the late 1950s, however, he created one of his most radical prose works, Comment c'est (1961; How It Is. An early variant version of Comment c'est, L'Image, was published in the British arts review, [...] (1959), and is the first appearance of the novel in any form.). This work relates the adventures of an unnamed narrator crawling through the mud while dragging a sack of canned food. It was written as a sequence of unpunctuated paragraphs in a style approaching telegraphese: [...] "You are there somewhere alive somewhere vast stretch of time then it's over you are there no more alive no more than again you are there again alive again it wasn't over an error you begin again all over more or less in the same place or in another as when another image above in the light you come to in hospital in the dark" [...] Following this work, it was almost another decade before Beckett produced a work of non-dramatic prose. How <b>It</b> <b>Is</b> <b>is</b> generally considered to mark the end of his middle period as a writer.|$|E
