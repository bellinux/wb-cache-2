5|$|Hillingdon Council {{provided}} a £150,000 grant in September 2010 {{for the restoration}} of the buildings. In April 2011, the council joined with the Friends to seek funding of up to £1million from the Heritage Lottery Fund, to support restoration work. It is planned that the coach <b>house</b> <b>could</b> be converted into a tea room.|$|E
5|$|Since Minnesota had divided governments {{for decades}} before 2010, {{a number of}} past budgets had brought the state close to a {{shutdown}}, {{and there had been}} one shutdown before in state history. After Governor Pawlenty and the Republican-majority <b>House</b> <b>could</b> not agree on a budget with the DFL-majority Senate in 2005, the state government went through a nine-day shutdown.|$|E
5|$|Although {{the oldest}} of the Stanley girls, Mimi was the last of them to die. Cynthia, Sean and Ono {{attended}} her funeral on 12 December 1991: McCartney, Harrison, and Starr all sent floral arrangements. Despite the animosity between Cynthia and Mimi, Varcoe remembered Cynthia crying throughout the whole funeral, and said that Mimi had always spoken positively about her. Mimi was cremated at the Poole Crematorium and the reception was at the Harbour Heights Hotel. The whereabouts of her ashes is unknown. Ono put Mimi's house up for sale on the same day as the cremation, but it was demolished in 1994, so a four-bedroomed <b>house</b> <b>could</b> be built on the site.|$|E

5|$|Citrus was {{distributed}} primarily in a regional market {{and was a}} luxury in northern cities; oranges in New York sold for about 50 cents per fruit. The acreage attached to the house Stowe purchased could produce an income of $2,000 a month ($ in 2009). Stowe wrote to author George Eliot to update her {{on the progress of}} improvements to the house in Mandarin, putting up wallpaper, improving plaster, and building a veranda that wrapped around the structure. She took pains not to disturb a giant oak and instead built the veranda around the tree. The <b>house</b> <b>could</b> accommodate as many as 17 family members and friends.|$|E
5|$|Mulgrew Miller {{was born}} in Greenwood, Mississippi, to parents who had been raised on plantations. He had three {{brothers}} and four sisters. His family was not musical, {{but they had a}} piano, which no-one in the <b>house</b> <b>could</b> play. Miller, however, played tunes on the piano from the age of six, playing by ear. He had piano lessons from the age of eight. As a child, he played blues and rhythm and blues for dances, and gospel music in a church. His family was Methodist, but he played in churches of various denominations. His principal influence on piano at this stage was Ramsey Lewis.|$|E
5|$|The {{development}} of the Palladian country house {{in the seventeenth century}} separated the family of the householder from the servants. Previously sharing the hall, and bedding down at a master's feet, or door, servants were now given separate small chambers. Sometimes these were placed on a mezzanine floor, as at Kinross. Servants were less visible, using backstairs that kept them away from members of the family and guests and they fulfilled necessary and sometimes unpleasant tasks. They were also fewer in number, of lower social status and predominately female. A country <b>house</b> <b>could</b> have 10 to 20 servants and large houses had more. A hierarchy of positions developed from the butler and housekeeper to footmen and maids. The sexes were increasingly segregated into their own quarters.|$|E
50|$|A {{few days}} later, then-Councilman Zev Yaroslavsky {{introduced}} {{a proposal that}} the city stop enforcing its anti-camping laws on Skid Row until adequate <b>housing</b> <b>could</b> be found for all its residents. The council rejected Yaroslavsky's proposal, but after hearing testimony from Assistant Police Chief David Dotson describing the LAPD's intended crackdown methodology, the council passed a motion asking Gates not to enforce the anti-camping laws until adequate <b>housing</b> <b>could</b> be found for the area's residents.|$|R

5|$|Despite the {{recommendation}} for demolition, in late 1995, the councillors {{of the newly}} formed City of Perth had a feasibility study carried out into whether Council <b>House</b> <b>could</b> be refurbished. This feasibility study {{was carried out by}} Architects Cox Howlett and Bailey, of which one of the partners was the son of original designer Jeffrey Howlett, and cost $100,000. The study indicated that the building could be economically refurbished, and in December 1996 the Council unanimously agreed to press ahead with refurbishment plans, removing its asbestos and building an underground car park {{at the rear of the}} site. The decision to refurbish was helped by the fact that interest rates at the time were so low that it was cheaper to service a loan than to pay rent. At the time, the refurbishment was expected to cost around $26 million.|$|E
5|$|Stacy Warner is {{a fictional}} {{recurring}} character portrayed by Sela Ward on the Fox Broadcasting Company's medical drama House. She {{was in a}} relationship with Dr. Gregory House (Hugh Laurie), when a clotted aneurysm in his right thigh led to an infarction during a game of golf, causing his quadriceps muscle to become necrotic. Regarding House's treatment, Stacy acted against House's wishes when he was put into a chemically induced coma. She authorized a safer surgical middle-ground procedure by removing just the dead muscle, leaving House with a lesser, but serious, level of pain {{for the rest of his}} life. <b>House</b> <b>could</b> not forgive her and they broke up. The two meet again, five years later, at the end of season one; Stacy wants House to treat her husband, Mark. House correctly diagnoses Mark with acute intermittent porphyria, and so he has to remain at the hospital for close monitoring. Stacy becomes the hospital's lawyer, and she and House grow closer together. When she is ultimately willing to leave Mark for him, House tells her to go back to Mark, which devastates her and causes her and Mark to leave the city.|$|E
5|$|The same Senate {{that had}} {{rejected}} the Tyler–Calhoun treaty {{by a margin}} of 2:1 in June 1844 reassembled in December 1844 in a short lame-duck session. (Though pro-annexation Democrats had made gains in the fall elections, those legislators – the 29th Congress – would not assume office until March 1845.) Lame-duck President Tyler, still trying to annex Texas in the final months of his administration, wished to avoid another overwhelming Senate rejection of his treaty. In his annual address to Congress on December 4, he declared the Polk victory a mandate for Texas annexation and proposed that Congress adopt a joint resolution procedure by which simple majorities in each <b>house</b> <b>could</b> secure ratification for the Tyler treaty. This method would avoid the constitutional requirement of a two-thirds majority in the Senate. Bringing the House of Representatives into the equation boded well for Texas annexation, as the pro-annexation Democratic Party possessed nearly a 2:1 majority in that chamber.|$|E
50|$|The {{community}} grew {{when the}} district {{was developed for}} housing. In the 1930s, the Warringah Council declared that only brick <b>houses</b> <b>could</b> be built there {{and many of these}} still exist today.|$|R
25|$|The Violano Virtuoso was {{designed}} for public places, and can {{be considered to be}} a beautiful work of craftsmanship. The wooden cabinet in which the mechanism was <b>housed</b> <b>could</b> be oak or mahogany.|$|R
50|$|From Period III to V {{there are}} fairly rich {{dwelling}} complexes with houses {{of stone and}} mud bricks. The full plans of the <b>houses</b> <b>could</b> not be exposed owing to the vertical nature of excavations carried out.|$|R
5|$|The {{temple and}} villa {{remained}} {{in the hands of}} Garrick's wife until her death in 1822 at the age of 98. It was subsequently bought by her solicitor, Thomas Carr, who preserved it as a monument to Garrick and even erected a statue of him in the temple to replace the Roubiliac Shakespeare. It changed hands several more times until, in 1923, the villa was converted into apartments. The riverside lawn was sold separately along with the temple and was bought by a Paul Glaize, who built a three-storey house alongside the temple. This caused such controversy and public outcry that in 1932 the site was bought by Hampton Urban District Council so that Glaize's Temple <b>House</b> <b>could</b> be demolished. The lawn and temple were subsequently opened to the public. They have remained in public ownership ever since.|$|E

25|$|Few people {{doubted that}} Barton, {{as the leading}} federalist in the oldest state, {{deserved}} {{to be the first}} Prime Minister of the new federation. However, since no federal Parliament had yet been established, the usual convention of appointing the leader of the largest party in the lower <b>house</b> <b>could</b> not apply. The newly arrived Governor-General, Lord Hopetoun, instead invited Sir William Lyne, the premier of New South Wales, to form a government.|$|E
50|$|Such {{houses were}} often also freihauses. There were {{frequent}} disputes {{between the people}} of the burglehn and the adjacent town, about whether the inhabitants of these <b>houses</b> <b>could</b> exercise crafts that were otherwise regulated by the town's guilds.|$|R
50|$|Eden Gardens, Eden Lands, Eden Lands Extension. Projects {{proved to}} be failed. Thousands people paid million rupees but Eden <b>housing</b> <b>could</b> not deliver their houses/plots. Effecties are stills waiting and struggling. It seems Government is agnoring the issue deliberately.|$|R
50|$|Increasing {{motor car}} {{ownership}} meant that <b>houses</b> <b>could</b> be sold easily {{even if they}} were remote from shops and other services. It was attractive to developers because {{they did not have to}} waste money or plot space constructing roads.|$|R
25|$|In Gaelic law, a 'sanctuary' {{called a}} maighin digona {{surrounded}} each person's dwelling. The maighin digona's size varied {{according to the}} owner's rank. In {{the case of a}} bóaire it stretched as far as he, while sitting at his <b>house,</b> <b>could</b> cast a cnairsech (variously described as a spear or sledgehammer). The owner of a maighin digona could offer its protection to someone fleeing from pursuers, who would then have to bring that person to justice by lawful means.|$|E
25|$|On this {{occasion}} Ali did not replace Abu Bakr as Amir-ul-Hajj. Ali was merely assigned a special mission {{to read the}} proclamation as according to Muhammad only a man from his own <b>house</b> <b>could</b> communate the revelation. We can thus say that on {{this occasion}} Abu Bakr represented the temporal side, while Ali represented the spiritual side. After the death of Muhammad {{there was no longer}} the question of any spiritual representation; the issue was only temporal representation, and for this Abu Bakr was the best choice as he had thus represented Muhammad even in his lifetime.|$|E
25|$|The {{difference}} in the 20th century was that the acts of demolition were often acts of desperation and last resort; a demolished <b>house</b> <b>could</b> not be valued for probate duty. A vacant site was attractive to property developers, who would pay a premium for an empty site that could be rebuilt upon and filled with numerous small houses and bungalows, which would return a quick profit. This was especially true {{in the years immediately}} following World War II, when Britain was desperate to replace the thousands of homes destroyed. Thus, in many cases, the demolition of the ancestral seat, strongly entwined with the family's history and identity, followed the earlier loss of the family's London house.|$|E
50|$|Through {{the twentieth}} century, {{more and more}} houses in the complex emptied. The {{increasing}} price {{appeared to be a}} barrier. Thus in 1954 it was decided that the <b>houses</b> <b>could</b> also be hired, after which the vacancy quickly disappeared.|$|R
40|$|It {{is widely}} {{believed}} that unaffordable <b>housing</b> <b>could</b> drive businesses away and thus impede job growth. However, {{there is little evidence}} to support this view. This paper presents a simple model to clarify how housing affordability is linked to employment growth and why unaffordable <b>housing</b> <b>could</b> negatively affect employment growth. The paper then investigates this effect empirically using data on California municipalities. For various reasons, a simple correlation between unaffordable housing and employment growth cannot be interpreted as causal. Several empirical strategies are employed to identify the causal effect of unaffordable housing on employment growth. The estimation results provide consistent evidence that unaffordable housing indeed slows local employment growth. Policy implications of these findings are briefly discussed...|$|R
50|$|Designed by Joseph Corson Llewellyn (1855-1932), {{this house}} was {{constructed}} in 1917 not of wood, the most common building material, but instead of hollow tile and blue-gray stucco. This was done to show that <b>houses</b> <b>could</b> be built of fire-proof materials without incurring additional expense.|$|R
25|$|Earl A. Young (born March 31, 1889 – May 24, 1975) was an American architect, realtor and {{insurance}} agent. Over {{a span of}} 52 years, he designed and built 31 structures in Charlevoix, Michigan but was never a registered architect. He worked mostly in stone, using limestone, fieldstone, and boulders he found throughout Northern Michigan. The homes are {{commonly referred to as}} gnome homes, mushroom houses, or Hobbit houses. His door, window, roof and fireplace designs were very distinct because of his use of curved lines. Young's goal was to show that a small stone <b>house</b> <b>could</b> be as impressive as a castle. Young also helped make Charlevoix the busy, summer resort town that it is today.|$|E
25|$|Although most burials {{initially}} occurred {{near the}} freedmen's cemetery {{in the northeast}} corner of the estate, Meigs ordered in mid-June 1864 that burials commence immediately on the grounds of Arlington House. The first officer burial had occurred next to the main flower garden on May 17, but with Meigs' order another 44 officers were buried along the southern and eastern sides of this area within a month. In December 1865, Robert E. Lee's brother, Sydney Smith Lee, visited Arlington House and observed that the <b>house</b> <b>could</b> be made livable again if the graves around the flower garden were removed. Meigs hated Lee for betraying the Union, and ordered that more burials occur near the house {{in order to make it}} politically impossible for disinterment to occur.|$|E
25|$|Tabloids {{from the}} time claimed that, at some point after her infant {{daughter}} and husband both died, a Boston medium told her (while supposedly channeling her late husband) that she should leave her home in New Haven and travel West, where she must continuously build a home for herself and the spirits {{of people who had}} fallen victim to Winchester rifles. Winchester left New Haven and headed for California. Though it is possible she was simply seeking a change of location and a hobby during her lengthy depression, other sources claim that Winchester came to believe her family and fortune were haunted by ghosts, and that only by moving West and continuously building them a <b>house</b> <b>could</b> she appease these spirits.|$|E
50|$|The {{area was}} struck by a {{destructive}} earthquake of 7.8 magnitudes on October 8, 2005.
