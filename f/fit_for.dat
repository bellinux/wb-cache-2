5|$|Schlachtgeschwader 4 and Jagdgeschwader 2 (SG 4 and JG 2) were {{to strike}} at Sint-Truiden airfield. JG 2 was {{commanded}} by Kurt Bühligen. I./JG 2's ground crews managed to make ready 35 of 46 Fw 190s, 29 of which were Fw 190D. Only 33 pilots were <b>fit</b> <b>for</b> operations. So the Gruppe reported only 33 Fw 190s ready. II./JG 2 could field 20 of 29 Bf 109s. Stab./JG 2 had three Fw 190s ready for the mission. It {{is not clear whether}} Bühligen took part in the mission. III./JG 2 reported 40 Fw 190s operational, 34 of them Fw 190Ds. However, only 28 of the 43 pilots in the unit were <b>fit</b> <b>for</b> operations and the formation fielded only 28 fighters. In total, 84 aircraft were ready on 31 December, including 28 Fw 190D-9s.|$|E
5|$|The crews {{found the}} {{aircraft}} difficult to fly, and its top speed was reduced significantly. Production {{was shut down}} after the pilots reports reached the Ministry of Aviation. However, a Chinese delegation was visiting Germany and they considered the He 111 A-0 <b>fit</b> <b>for</b> their needs and purchased seven machines.|$|E

Afterward she tells Mulder that she said it was Folie à deux, and describes it as 'a madness shared by two'. But she does not specify who the two were.|$|E
5|$|Brandon later {{returned}} to active service, commanding his regiment through the Battle of Gettysburg. General William Barksdale {{was killed in}} the battle; Colonel Humphreys became brigadier general to replace him, and Brandon was in turn promoted to colonel. He went on to see action in the Chickamauga Campaign. In September 1863, after the Battle of Chickamauga, Brandon resigned from active duty. Because of his artificial leg, age and the recurrence of an ailment from 1862, he did not feel <b>fit</b> <b>for</b> military service at the time.|$|E
5|$|But as Hohoff saw it, the {{manuscript}} {{was by no}} means <b>fit</b> <b>for</b> publication.

5|$|But {{the player}} {{primarily}} responsible for elevating the Modern Benoni {{to the status of}} a major opening was Mikhail Tal, who took up the opening in 1953 after seeing one of Nezhmetdinov's games. The tactical positions it led to were a perfect <b>fit</b> <b>for</b> Tal's combinatorial gifts and he crushed many opponents in brilliant style. Famous examples include his game against Bukhuti Gurgenidze at the 1957 USSR championship, excerpted below, and his win against Yuri Averbakh at the same tournament the following year.|$|E
5|$|During the 1989 season, 11–year veteran Ottis Anderson, a Plan B Free Agent, {{emerged as}} the Giants new {{featured}} running back.

Dave Meggett also emerged as a threat on third downs and special teams, catching 34 passes for 531yards and making the Pro Bowl.|$|E
5|$|Frank Oz said The Land of Gorch {{experiment}} had its positives and negatives. Oz said {{he thought}} the routine was not a good <b>fit</b> <b>for</b> Saturday Night Live, and that the cartoon-style humor of their characters did not work well with the comedy of Saturday Night Live, much of which was initially derived from the Second City environment. Oz said he generally enjoyed working on Saturday Night Live and witnessing the skill of performers such as Andy Kaufman, Albert Brooks, John Belushi, Chevy Chase, and Dan Aykroyd.|$|E

After the story was transitioned to a more upbeat story of five female superhumans, the character designs were redone to have a lighter, more colorful feel. The main series characters were praised for being a perfect <b>fit</b> <b>for</b> the overall story, {{as well as for}} their cute appearances. The characters introduced in a la Mode were also praised for their visual appearances, but criticized as being repeats of the original series.|$|E
5|$|In August 2014, Bolt set {{the indoor}} 100m {{world record in}} Warsaw {{with a time of}} 9.98 seconds. This was his sole {{individual}} outing of the 2014 season.

In Bolt's absence, Justin Gatlin had dominated the sprints, holding the year's fastest times, including seven of the top ten 100m runs that season.|$|E

5|$|Miller's career started {{during the}} reign of behaviorism in psychology. Behaviorists {{questioned}} whether mental thought processes were <b>fit</b> <b>for</b> scientific study, not being observable.

He, Jerome Bruner, and Noam Chomsky are considered the founders of the field of Cognitive Psychology that replaced behaviorism as the framework for analyzing the mind.|$|E
