500|$|Fiennes {{was cast}} as Amon Göth after Spielberg viewed his {{performances}} in [...] and Emily Brontë's Wuthering Heights. Spielberg said of Fiennes' audition that [...] "I saw sexual evil. It {{is all about}} subtlety: there were moments of kindness that would move across his eyes and then instantly run cold." [...] Fiennes put on [...] to play the role. He watched historic newsreels and talked to Holocaust survivors who knew Göth. In portraying him, Fiennes said [...] "I got close to his pain. Inside him is a fractured, miserable human being. I feel split about him, sorry for him. He's like some dirty, battered doll <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>given</b> and that I came to feel peculiarly attached to." [...] Doctors Samuel J. Leistedt and Paul Linkowski of the Université libre de Bruxelles describe Göth's character in the film as a classic psychopath. Fiennes looked so much like Göth in costume that when Mila Pfefferberg (a survivor of the events) met him, she trembled with fear.|$|E

When Tarantino declined, Roger Christian, a protégé of George Lucas, was recruited as the director on the advice of Lucas. Christian had most recently been the second unit director on Lucas' [...] Patrick Tatopoulos was signed to develop the production design and costumes, including the design of the alien Psychlos, and Czech-American composer Elia Cmiral was signed to provide the film's score. Travolta and Krane also signed the cinematographer and most of the principal actors. Corey Mandell, a screenwriter who had previously worked with Ridley Scott on Blade Runner, signed on to write the script for the film, which had previously gone through 10 revisions. Mandell stated in an interview, [...] "I am not a Scientologist… I came on board because John asked me to read the book and said, 'It's not a religious book. It's a science-fiction story. There's nothing sacred about the story, nothing of the religious philosophy. <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>given</b> this to read purely as science fiction – to see whether it was intriguing as a movie.

500|$|Initially, Reitman {{had wanted}} to direct but had made only one film, Cannibal Girls, for $5,000. The film's {{producers}} approached Richard Lester and Bob Rafelson before considering John Landis, who got the director job based on his work on Kentucky Fried Movie. That film's script and continuity supervisor was the girlfriend of Sean Daniel, an assistant to Mount. Daniel saw Landis' movie and recommended him. Landis then met with Mount, Reitman and Simmons and got the job. Landis remembers, [...] "When <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>given</b> the script, it was the funniest thing I had ever read up to that time. But it was really offensive. There {{was a great deal}} of projectile vomiting and rape and all these things". There was also friction between Landis and the writers early on because Landis was a high-school dropout from Hollywood and they were college graduates from the East Coast. Ramis remembers, [...] "He sort of referred immediately to Animal House as 'my movie.' We'd been living with it for two years and we hated that". According to Landis, he drew inspiration from classic Hollywood comedies featuring the likes of Buster Keaton, Harold Lloyd, and the Marx Brothers.|$|E
