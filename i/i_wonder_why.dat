6000|$|... "Poppy Tyrell," [...] {{he said to}} himself, slowly. [...] "Poppy Tyrell! <b>I</b> <b>wonder</b> <b>why</b> {{the skipper}} has never {{mentioned}} her. <b>I</b> <b>wonder</b> <b>why</b> she took his arm. I wonder whether she knows that he’s engaged to be married." ...|$|E
6000|$|PURDIE. No, nor the jewels. I {{think she}} has some sort of idea now that when I give her {{anything}} nice {{it means that you}} have been nice to me. She has rather a suspicious nature, Mabel; she never used to have it, but it seems to be growing on her. <b>I</b> <b>wonder</b> <b>why,</b> <b>I</b> <b>wonder</b> <b>why?</b> ...|$|E
5000|$|Example: <b>I</b> <b>wondered</b> <b>why</b> {{the ball}} was getting bigger. Then it hit me.|$|R
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>wondered</b> <b>why</b> Strickland {{had done}} that. But I made no remark, {{and for some}} time we kept silence.|$|R
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>wondered</b> <b>why</b> she was {{so anxious}} to see me. Perhaps she knew of her husband's {{approaching}} banishment, {{and the cause of}} it.|$|R
6000|$|<b>I</b> <b>wonder</b> <b>why</b> {{the head}} {{coppersmith}} in an Italian town, always {{lives next door}} to the Hotel, or opposite: making the visitor feel as if the beating hammers were his own heart, palpitating with a deadly energy! <b>I</b> <b>wonder</b> <b>why</b> jealous corridors surround the bedroom on all sides, and fill it with unnecessary doors that can't be shut, and will not open, and abut on pitchy darkness! <b>I</b> <b>wonder</b> <b>why</b> it is not enough that these distrustful genii stand agape at one's dreams all night, but there must also be round open portholes, high in the wall, suggestive, when a mouse or rat is heard behind the wainscot, of a somebody scraping the wall with his toes, in his endeavours to reach one of these portholes and look in! <b>I</b> <b>wonder</b> <b>why</b> the faggots are so constructed, as to know of no effect but an agony of heat when they are lighted and replenished, and an agony of cold and suffocation at all other times! I wonder, above all, why it is the great feature of domestic architecture in Italian inns, that all the fire goes up the chimney, except the smoke! ...|$|E
60|$|MYRRHINA. How strangely he spake to me. And {{with what}} scorn did he regard me. <b>I</b> <b>wonder</b> <b>why</b> he spake {{to me so}} strangely.|$|E
6000|$|... "Hush!" [...] the Princess said. [...] "There are {{too many}} people about to talk of these things. <b>I</b> <b>wonder</b> <b>why</b> the Duke took Jeanne off." ...|$|E
60|$|All this I {{heard as}} I dashed for the lee door and as <b>I</b> <b>wondered</b> <b>why</b> <b>I</b> {{did not hear}} the Samurai's voice.|$|R
6000|$|Again <b>I</b> <b>wondered</b> <b>why</b> the Basutos {{should look}} upon this {{particular}} spot as sacred, but thinking it wisest to ask no questions, I only answered-- ...|$|R
6000|$|... "By George, <b>I</b> <b>wondered</b> <b>why</b> {{you came}} down here. Who {{are you going}} to take out in a sleigh? There's a girl in it, is there?" ...|$|R
6000|$|She went, and Miss Pritty, {{opening the}} letter, exclaimed, [...] "From my nephew, Edgar! I knew it. Dear fellow! <b>I</b> <b>wonder</b> <b>why</b> he writes to me." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'I've {{noticed that}} too,' said Bat. 'But {{the odd thing}} is you mustn't give the public {{straight}} Dickens--not in My business. <b>I</b> <b>wonder</b> <b>why</b> that is.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "He {{was afraid}} {{when he was}} ill; <b>I</b> <b>wonder</b> <b>why.</b> The fellow has no {{religious}} or moral code. But he drinks hard and perhaps he's superstitious." ...|$|E
60|$|Then I {{noticed that}} a big, blue-checked cloth was spread on the parapet before me, over the parapet of heaven. <b>I</b> <b>wondered</b> <b>why</b> it hung there.|$|R
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>wondered</b> <b>why</b> Mariani had not returned, only to {{remember}} that the soldier who had locked me in had carried the key of my prison-chamber to Ramiro.|$|R
60|$|Lucille Haldane's {{voice was}} low and very {{pleasant}} to listen to, but <b>I</b> <b>wondered</b> <b>why</b> <b>I</b> should feel such a thrill of pleasure as I heard it.|$|R
6000|$|... “There goes Lucy, {{taking a}} ride. Uncle almost always takes her, {{when he goes}} any where. <b>I</b> <b>wonder</b> <b>why</b> father does not take me as often.” ...|$|E
6000|$|... "It is untrue," [...] said Bell; [...] "quite untrue. If {{you hear}} it repeated, you should {{contradict}} it. <b>I</b> <b>wonder</b> <b>why</b> people should say such things." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "After all, I don't {{think the}} subject is of very great interest. <b>I</b> <b>wonder</b> <b>why</b> you went to so much trouble to explain the thing to me." ...|$|E
60|$|He chuckled, {{but did not}} move. He smoked on in silence, {{taking no}} further notice of me, and {{apparently}} was absorbed in thought. <b>I</b> <b>wondered</b> <b>why</b> he had come.|$|R
60|$|Vaguely <b>I</b> <b>wondered</b> <b>why,</b> till <b>I</b> {{perceived}} {{that three of}} those courageous Fung were following across it, resting their hands upon each other's shoulders, while their companions cheered them.|$|R
60|$|I did {{not doubt}} it, yet I dared not make so bold as to confess it, and <b>I</b> <b>wondered</b> <b>why</b> they should laugh {{to hear her}} earnest censure of them.|$|R
6000|$|... "Quite so, Baas. He will be angry. <b>I</b> <b>wonder</b> <b>why</b> he did it?" [...] {{he added}} suspiciously, [...] "seeing {{that he is}} such a friend of yours." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "But," [...] he {{continued}} sadly, [...] "I {{do not understand}} him, he whispers so softly that, though I hear, I cannot comprehend. <b>I</b> <b>wonder</b> <b>why</b> this is so." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "It's all in {{that paper}} Sankey {{left in his}} {{overcoat}} pocket. Get it an' you have the whole story. <b>I</b> <b>wonder</b> <b>why</b> they don't put you in jail?" ...|$|E
60|$|So I went to bed. The {{hotel was}} {{on the edge of}} a steep declivity. <b>I</b> <b>wondered</b> <b>why</b> the whole hills did not slide down, in some great natural catastrophe.|$|R
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>wondered</b> <b>why</b> it {{was that}} Colonel Gansevoort delayed in the coming, and could see, without looking in any {{direction}} save at my foe, {{that the number of}} savages inside the stockade was increasing each moment.|$|R
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>wondered</b> <b>why</b> Tony Dibble did {{not manage}} {{to send me}} word of some kind. I {{did not know that}} the honest old sailor was at this minute on the dock at New Bedford, speculating on what had become of the Spitfire.|$|R
6000|$|... "They'll be dirty now," [...] he said. [...] "You {{should have}} taken them. <b>I</b> <b>wonder</b> <b>why</b> you didn't. I meant to have told you I wanted you to." ...|$|E

60|$|<b>I</b> <b>wondered</b> <b>why</b> {{the retreat}} was not begun, {{if we were}} to make one, and felt as if I had a {{personal}} grievance against the lieutenant because he failed to give that order which would permit of our getting away from such a disagreeable situation.|$|R
5000|$|... "Often {{looking at}} her asleep, or eating, or trying to assume a naïve expression, <b>I</b> <b>wondered</b> <b>why</b> that {{extraordinary}} beauty, grace, and intelligence had been given her by God. Could it simply be for lolling in bed, eating and lying, lying endlessly?" [...] (Shamokhin of Ariadne) ...|$|R
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>wondered</b> <b>why</b> the {{envelope}} {{was to be}} left open, and why Lucilla looked a little confused when she forbade me to close it. Another unexpected revelation {{of the influence of}} their affliction on the natures of the blind, was waiting to enlighten me on those two points.|$|R
