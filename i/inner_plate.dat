40|$|Abstract: For an <b>inner</b> doubler <b>plate</b> {{reinforced}} tubular joint, the {{doubler plate}} is welded onto the inner {{surface of the}} chord by using fillet weld, and {{the position of the}} doubler plate is placed under the brace/chord intersection. Through this reinforcement, the radial stiffness of the chord is improved, and hence the strength is increased. Finite element model is built by using software ABAQUS to analyze the ultimate load and failure mode of <b>inner</b> doubler <b>plate</b> reinforced tubular T-joints. Overall 432 models with different geometrical parameters and doubler plate sizes are analyzed. The effect of all the parameters on improving the static strength is discussed.

40|$|A high-gradient linear {{accelerator}} comprises a solid-state stack {{in a vacuum}} of five sets of disc-shaped Blumlein modules each having a center hole through which particles are sequentially accelerated. Each Blumlein module is a sandwich of two outer conductive plates that bracket an <b>inner</b> conductive <b>plate</b> positioned between two dielectric plates with different thicknesses and dielectric constants. A third dielectric core {{in the shape of}} a hollow cylinder forms a casing down the series of center holes, and it has a dielectric constant different that the two dielectric plates that sandwich the <b>inner</b> conductive <b>plate.</b> In operation, all the <b>inner</b> conductive <b>plates</b> are charged to the same DC potential relative to the outer conductive plates. Next, all the <b>inner</b> conductive <b>plates</b> are simultaneously shorted to the outer conductive plates at the outer diameters. The signal short will propagate to the inner diameters at two different rates in each Blumlein module. A faster wave propagates quicker to the third dielectric core across the dielectric plates with the closer spacing and lower dielectric constant. When the faster wave reaches the inner extents of the outer and <b>inner</b> conductive <b>plates,</b> it reflects back outward and reverses the field in that segment of the dielectric core. All the field segments in the dielectric core are then in unipolar agreement until the slower wave finally propagates to the third dielectric core across the dielectric plates with the wider spacing and higher dielectric constant. During such unipolar agreement, particles in the core are accelerated with gradients that exceed twenty megavolts per meter...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{gives an}} {{approach}} to the probabilistic corrosion rate estimation model for <b>inner</b> bottom <b>plates</b> of bulk carriers. Firstly, by using the data from thickness measurements for <b>inner</b> bottom <b>plates</b> for considered 25 bulk carriers, the related best fitted linear model for the corrosion wastage is obtained {{as a function of}} ship’s age. In this model it is assumed that life of coating is 4 years. The obtained related corrosion rate is equal to mm/year. Notice that the obtained linear model is a particular case of a power model proposed in some earlier investigations. In {{view of the fact that}} the corrosion rate of ship hull structures is influenced by many factors, many of an uncertain nature, in recent studies several authors investigated a probabilistic model as more appropriate to describe the expected corrosion. Motivated by these investigations, and using 2926 thickness measurements for corrosion wastage of <b>inner</b> bottom <b>plates</b> of considered 38 special ships surveys, this paper examines the cumulative density function for the corrosion rate involved in the mentioned linear model, and considered here as a continuous random variable. The obtained statistical, numerical and graphical results show that the logistic distribution or normal distribution would be well appropriate for the probabilistic corrosion rate estimation model for <b>inner</b> bottom <b>plates</b> of bulk carriers. It is believed that this fact will be confirmed with greater statistical reliability in our future investigations including many more data collected on the considered corrosion...|$|R
