5|$|The {{causes of}} plantar {{fasciitis}} {{are not entirely}} clear. Risk factors include overuse such as from long periods of standing, an increase in exercise, and obesity. It is also associated with inward rolling of the foot and a lifestyle that involves little exercise. While heel spurs are frequently found it is unclear {{if they have a}} role in causing the condition. Plantar fasciitis is a disorder of the <b>insertion</b> <b>site</b> of the ligament on the bone characterized by micro tears, breakdown of collagen, and scarring. As inflammation plays a lesser role, many feel the condition should be renamed plantar fasciosis. The diagnosis is typically based on signs and symptoms with ultrasound sometimes used to help. Other conditions with similar symptoms include osteoarthritis, ankylosing spondylitis, heel pad syndrome, and reactive arthritis.|$|E

40|$|In many crop species, DNA {{fingerprinting}} {{is required}} for the precise identification of cultivars {{to protect the rights of}} breeders. Many families of retrotransposons have multiple copies throughout the eukaryotic genome and their integrated copies are inherited genetically. Thus, their insertion polymorphisms among cultivars are useful for DNA fingerprinting. In this study, we conducted a DNA fingerprinting based on the insertion polymorphisms of active retrotransposon families (Rtsp- 1 and LIb) in sweet potato. Using 38 cultivars, we identified 2024 <b>insertion</b> <b>sites</b> in the two families with an Illumina MiSeq sequencing platform. Of these <b>insertion</b> <b>sites,</b> 91. 4 % appeared to be polymorphic among the cultivars and 376 cultivar-specific <b>insertion</b> <b>sites</b> were identified, which were converted directly into cultivar-specific sequence-characterized amplified region (SCAR) markers. A phylogenetic tree was constructed using these <b>insertion</b> <b>sites,</b> which corresponded well with known pedigree information, thereby indicating their suitability for genetic diversity studies. Thus, the genome-wide comparative analysis of active retrotransposon <b>insertion</b> <b>sites</b> using the bench-top MiSeq sequencing platform is highly effective for DNA fingerprinting without any requirement for whole genome sequence information. This approach may facilitate the development of practical polymerase chain reaction-based cultivar diagnostic system and could also be applied to the determination of genetic relationships...|$|R

That procedure is usually delayed for at least 6 months after enucleation to allow time for implant vascularization. Technetium bone or gadolinium-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging scans are not now universally used, {{but they have been}} used to conﬁrm vascularization before peg insertion.

25|$|For hemorrhagic strokes, a CT or MRI scan with {{intravascular}} contrast {{may be able}} {{to identify}} abnormalities in the brain arteries (such as aneurysms) or other sources of bleeding, and structural MRI if this shows no cause. If this too does not identify an underlying reason for the bleeding, invasive cerebral angiography could be performed but this requires access to the bloodstream with an intravascular catheter and can cause further strokes as well as complications at the <b>insertion</b> <b>site</b> and this investigation is therefore reserved for specific situations. If there are symptoms suggesting that the hemorrhage might have occurred as a result of venous thrombosis, CT or MRI venography can be used to examine the cerebral veins.|$|E
25|$|Following λ-red operon {{activity}} induction, a linear, double-stranded cassette encoding a selectable marker, such as antibiotic resistance, {{is transformed}} into the cells {{in place of the}} target gene and incorporated into the DNA behind a specific inducible promoter. This allows for growth selection of the recombinant cells with proper insertion location verified using polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Specific incorporation can be achieved by including flanking PCR primers around the inserted linear DNA that are complement to the targeted <b>insertion</b> <b>site.</b> After selection of the recombinants, a second transformation is needed to remove the selective marker. A plasmid expressing flippase (FLP) can be transformed into the recombined cells, which can specifically cleave FLP recognition target sites (FRTs) flanking the antibiotic resistance gene. While this successfully removes the selective marker from the genome, it leaves FRT scars in place of the target gene.|$|E
40|$|Motivation: It {{is known}} that {{nucleosomal}} organization of chromatin {{plays an important role}} in regulation of gene expression. Changes in nucleosome positioning and the consequent changes in expression of genes in the region of insertions are a possible aftermath upon insertion of retrotransposons (REs) into the host genome. This aspect of the interactions between the genome and retrotransposons yet remains vague. The goal of this work is to clarify, first, whether the nucleosome potential profile is specific of the genomic regions housing potential <b>insertion</b> <b>sites</b> for various retrotransposons and, second, whether the nucleosome potential profiles of LTRs of retrotransposons belonging to different families and the corresponding genomic regions encompassing the <b>insertion</b> <b>sites</b> are different. Results: Nucleosome potential profiles of <b>insertion</b> <b>sites</b> (genomic regions where insertions were detected) for retrotransposons from eleven families were for the first time studied using computer tools and compared with the corresponding profiles of potential <b>insertion</b> <b>sites</b> (native sequences obtained by in silico reconstruction). It was demonstrated that (1) potential <b>insertion</b> <b>sites</b> of several REs displayed specific nucleosome profiles correlating with nucleotide compositions of both the target sites themselves and the inverted terminal repeats (ITRs), forming the 5 and 3 ends of each retrotransposon LTR, and (2) the profiles of nucleosome potentials of retrotransposon LTRs from different RE families differed from one another as well as from the profiles of the genomic regions encompassing these inserts...|$|R

40|$|Abstract Background Gene {{knockouts}} are {{a critical}} resource for functional genomics. In Arabidopsis, comprehensive knockout collections were generated by amplifying and sequencing genomic DNA flanking insertion mutants. These Flanking Sequence Tags (FSTs) map each mutant {{to a specific}} locus within the genome. In maize, FSTs have been generated using DNA transposons. Transposable elements can generate unstable insertions {{that are difficult to}} analyze for simple knockout phenotypes. Transposons can also generate somatic insertions that fail to segregate in subsequent generations. Results Transposon <b>insertion</b> <b>sites</b> from 106 UniformMu FSTs were tested for inheritance by locus-specific PCR. We confirmed 89 % of the FSTs to be germinal transposon insertions. We found no evidence for somatic insertions within the 11 % of <b>insertion</b> <b>sites</b> that were not confirmed. Instead, this subset of <b>insertion</b> <b>sites</b> had errors in locus-specific primer design due to incomplete or low-quality genomic sequences. The locus-specific PCR assays identified a knockout of a 6 -phosphogluconate dehydrogenase gene that co-segregates with a seed mutant phenotype. The mutant phenotype linked to this knockout generates novel hypotheses about the role for the plastid-localized oxidative pentose phosphate pathway during grain-fill. Conclusion We show that FSTs from the UniformMu population identify stable, germinal <b>insertion</b> <b>sites</b> in maize. Moreover, we show that these sequence-indexed mutations can be readily used for reverse genetic analysis. We conclude from these data that the current collection of 1, 882 non-redundant <b>insertion</b> <b>sites</b> from UniformMu provide a genome-wide resource for reverse genetics. </p...|$|R
25|$|Reproductive system: Vagina {{is short}} to very short. Oviduct is {{measuring}} about 2/3 {{of the length}} of the proximal part of the pedunculus, which is clearly shorter than its much narrower distal segment. Proximal part of the pedunculus about as broad as the proximal half of the oviduct, which is twice as broad as the distal half; the much narrower diverticulum reaches somewhat further than the bursa of the bursa copulatrix, which is separate from the spermoviduct. Male part of the genitalia forming a loop because the vas deferens and a short, most proximal part of the penis are united by a common sheath; with a single retractor muscle, inserting rather close {{to the beginning of the}} vas deferens, without a flagellum or caecum. The luminal structure, as far as visible in the transparent genital slides, enables the distinction of three segments: (1) a short broadest part with a relatively simple, longitudinal, luminal structure, (2) a much longer part, with a more complicated luminal surface of many protuberances that very gradually decrease in size towards segment (3), which has a wall structure with very small, irregular protuberances and changes into the epiphallus near the <b>insertion</b> <b>site</b> of the retractor muscle, without an obvious boundary.|$|E
25|$|CT {{scanning}} {{is preferred}} {{to assess the}} extent of the tumor in the abdominopelvic cavity, though magnetic resonance imaging can also be used. CT scanning can also be useful for finding omental caking or differentiating fluid from solid tumor in the abdomen, especially in low malignant potential tumors. However, it may not detect smaller tumors. Sometimes, a chest x-ray is used to detect metastases in the chest or pleural effusion. Another test for metastatic disease, though it is infrequently used, is a barium enema, which can show if the rectosigmoid colon is involved in the disease. Positron emission tomography, bone scans, and paracentesis are of limited use; in fact, paracentesis can cause metastases to form at the needle <b>insertion</b> <b>site</b> and may not provide useful results. However, paracentesis can be used in cases where there is no pelvic mass and ascites is still present. A physician suspecting ovarian cancer may also perform mammography or an endometrial biopsy (in the case of abnormal bleeding) to assess the possibility of breast malignancies and endometrial malignancy, respectively. Vaginal ultrasonography is often the first-line imaging study performed when an adnexal mass is found. Several characteristics of an adnexal mass indicate ovarian malignancy; they usually are solid, irregular, multilocular, and/or large; and they typically have papillary features, central vessels, and/or irregular internal septations. However, SCST has no definitive characteristics on radiographic study.|$|E

40|$|Background: Transposable {{elements}} {{constitute an}} important part of the genome and are essential in adaptivemechanisms. Transposition events associated with phenotypic changes occur naturally or are induced in insertionalmutant populations. Transposon mutagenesis results in multiple random insertions and recovery of most/all theinsertions is critical for forward genetics study. Using genome next-generation sequencing data and appropriatebioinformatics tool, it is plausible to accurately identify transposon <b>insertion</b> <b>sites,</b> which could provide candidatecausal mutations for desired phenotypes for further functional validation. Results: We developed a novel bioinformatics tool, ITIS (Identification of Transposon <b>Insertion</b> <b>Sites),</b> for localizingtransposon <b>insertion</b> <b>sites</b> within a genome. It takes next-generation genome re-sequencing data (NGS data), transposonsequence, and reference genome sequence as input, and generates a list of highly reliable candidate <b>insertion</b> <b>sites</b> aswell as zygosity information of each insertion. Using a simulated dataset and a case study based on an insertional mutantline from Medicago truncatula, we showed that ITIS performed better in terms of sensitivity and specificity than othersimilar algorithms such as RelocaTE, RetroSeq, TEMP and TIF. With the case study data, we demonstrated the efficiencyof ITIS by validating the presence and zygosity of predicted <b>insertion</b> <b>sites</b> of the Tnt 1 transposon within a complex plantsystem, M. truncatula.

Integration preferentially {{occurs in the}} proximity of active genes, and may in some case disturb their activity, with adverse toxic consequences. To efficiently analyze high numbers of lentiviral <b>insertion</b> <b>sites</b> in the DNA of transduced cells, we developed an improved high-throughput method called vector integration tag analysis (VITA).
