When they defeat Wizeman and Reala, peace is returned to Nightopia {{and the world of}} Nightmare is suppressed. The next day, back in Twin Seeds, a centenary ceremony begins. Elliot is seen walking through the parade until he has a vision of Nights looking at him through a billboard. Realizing that Claris is performing in a hall, Elliot runs through the crowd and sees Claris on stage in front of a large audience, singing well. The two look at each other, and are transitioned to a spring valley in Nightopia, which leaves ambiguity as to whether what they achieved was real or <b>just</b> <b>a</b> <b>dream.</b>|$|E

Mario suddenly awakes and decides to tell Luigi, Toad and Princess Peach, who all report experiencing the same dream.

500|$|The final {{segment is}} based on the Halloween cartoon It's the Great Pumpkin, Charlie Brown. It could not be titled [...] "It's the Great Pumpkin, Milhouse" [...] to exactly match its namesake because of a [...] "big legal issue", {{according}} to Al Jean. However, the characters were redesigned to resemble the style of Peanuts, and they also obtained rights to use Vince Guaraldi's music. Jean said in 2011 that [...] "For years we {{had never been able to}} parody Charlie Brown's Halloween special, which is one of the all-time top three animated shows ever. The Vince Guaraldi music is such a huge part of it, so we got to clear it. It was <b>just</b> <b>a</b> <b>dream</b> come true to satirize it.

500|$|Such was the {{likelihood}} of Manchester United going on to retain the title, bookmaker Fred Done paid out on punters with two months of the season left. Arsenal steadily closed the gap, however, and victory against Wimbledon in March 1998 set up a title clash between themselves and the reigning champions. Wenger in the lead up to the game maintained {{it was possible for}} Arsenal to win the league, stating [...] "two or three weeks ago, the title was <b>just</b> <b>a</b> <b>dream</b> for us and people laughed when I said we could still do it". He suggested Manchester United were responsible for making the title race [...] "interesting". At Old Trafford, Overmars scored the decisive goal to give Arsenal a 1–0 win. The victory was followed by nine consecutive league wins, the last of which was a home fixture against Everton that secured Arsenal's status as champions. Wenger became the first foreign manager to win the double, when his team beat Newcastle United in the 1998 FA Cup Final.|$|E

He subsequently denied being angry with the coaching, saying that he was actually [...] "irritated with himself". He scored his first goal of the tournament in Spain's next game, a 2–1 win over Sweden. Torres scored the winner and was named the man of the match in the final against Germany in a 1–0 victory. He said, [...] "It's <b>just</b> <b>a</b> <b>dream</b> come true. This is my first title and I hope it's the first of many. Victory in a Euro, it is almost as big as a World Cup.

500|$|Like Percy Bysshe Shelley’s [...] "To a Skylark", Keats’s narrator {{listens to}} a bird song, but {{listening}} to the song within “Ode to a Nightingale” is almost painful and similar to death. The narrator seeks {{to be with the}} nightingale and abandons his sense of vision in order to embrace the sound in an attempt to share in the darkness with the bird. As the poem ends, the trance caused by the nightingale is broken and the narrator is left wondering if it was a real vision or <b>just</b> <b>a</b> <b>dream.</b> The poem reliance on the process of sleeping common to Keats's poems, and [...] "Ode to a Nightingale" [...] shares many of the same themes as Keats's Sleep and Poetry and Eve of St. Agnes. This further separates the image of the nightingale's song from its closest comparative image, the urn as represented in [...] "Ode on a Grecian Urn". The nightingale is distant and mysterious, and even disappears {{at the end of the}} poem. The dream image emphasizes the shadowiness and elusiveness of the poem. These elements make it impossible for there to be a complete self-identification with the nightingale, but it also allows for self-awareness to permeate throughout the poem, albeit in an altered state.|$|E

2500|$|Vladimir Kosmich Zworykin {{was born}} in Murom, Russia, in 1888, on July 29 (old style July 17), {{to the family of}} a prosperous merchant. He had a {{relatively}} calm upbringing, and he rarely saw his father except on religious holidays. He studied at the St. Petersburg Institute of Technology, under Boris Rosing. He helped Rosing with experimental work on television in the basement of Rosing's private lab at the School of Artillery of Saint Petersburg. [...] They worked on the problem of [...] "electrical telescopy," [...] something Zworykin had never heard of before. [...] At this time, electrical telescopy (or television as it was later called) was <b>just</b> <b>a</b> <b>dream.</b> [...] Zworykin did not know that others had been studying the idea since the 1880s, or that Professor Rosing had been working on it in secret since 1902 and had made excellent progress. Rosing had filed his first patent on a television system in 1907, featuring a very early cathode ray tube as a receiver, and a mechanical device as a transmitter. Its demonstration in 1911, based on an improved design, was the first world's demonstration of TV of any kind.|$|E
