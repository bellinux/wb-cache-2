40|$|Commercial {{samples of}} wheat, rye and potato flour and flaked oats, {{as well as}} ground flaked oats and fresh {{potatoes}} were gamma-irradiated (20 or 30 kGy dose). The products and appropriate control samples were inves tigated by small-angle X-ray scattering (SAXS) {{in the range of}} 28 from 0. 357 to 6. 46 degree (CuKa radiation). The results were compared with those obta ined for pure potato starch. Effects of grinding and heating at 100 ° Con SAXS results were also examined. Different scattering curves were obtained for various unirradiated products. Refl ect ions derived from starch were de tected for some uni rradiated :ls well as irradiated products. A reflection connected with long-range ordering in sta rch (co rresponding to the distance d =: 10 nm) was observed for potato, wheat, rye flour and potato powde r. A reflection corresponding to the distanced = 1. 6 nm (due to short-range ordering) was observed in the cases of potato flour and potato powder. Comparison of diffractograms of gamma- irradiated and unirradiated products, <b>have</b> <b>revea</b> led changes of the reflection corresponding to d = 10 nm intensity and elevation of scattering curves, connected with changes of long-range ordering in starch gra nules. The effect of gamma-irradiation on long-range ordering in starch was also observed aft er heating of starch at 100 °C. Heating at 100 °C as well as grinding, cause diminution of long-range ordering m starch granules...|$|E

Using Regge theory it is then pre-dicted that G 2 (W) would be a constant for large co, and is estimated to be approximately- 0. 06. These pre-dictions, in part icular the constancy of the slopes for v W 2 versus 1 /Q 2 plots for large co (w> 8), compare very well with the recent experimental data.
