Brian Krebs of The Washington Post {{reported that a}} quick scan on a Windows 7 computer took about 10 minutes and a <b>full</b> <b>scan</b> about 45 minutes.

5|$|In PC Magazine testing, Norton {{completely}} detected {{most of the}} malware samples. For {{two-thirds of}} the samples, all traces were removed. Norton found and removed all the commercial keyloggers. A <b>full</b> <b>scan</b> took nearly an hour to complete though, {{twice as long as}} the 2007 version. The suite blocked most of the malware from installing and all the commercial keyloggers, regardless of any modifications made to the samples. PC World noted that Norton removed 80 percent of malware-associated files and Registry entries.|$|E
5|$|Running a <b>full</b> <b>scan</b> {{complies}} {{a list of}} Internet-enabled applications. Users set permissions {{or accept}} Norton's default settings. The firewall detects and blocks port scans and logs intrusion attempts. This version does not run a trace on attackers, however Symantec is planning an online tool to do so. To ensure rogue programs can not masquerade as trustworthy applications, Norton verifies programs against a list of digital signatures for known programs, update Tracker warns users if hackers attempt {{to gain access to}} users' computers. The firewall blocked all access attempts from Shields Up and Port Checker. This version includes a wizard to simplify firewall setup to accommodate for multiple computers sharing an Internet connection. With this release, Norton can prevent specified personal information from being transmitted via a compatible instant messenger client, e-mail, and websites. Ad-blocking includes the Ad Trashcan, where users can place ads that slipped past ad-filtering.|$|E

40|$|Abstract—Wi-Fi based {{localization}} {{has proven}} to be a com-pelling alternative to GPS for mobile devices. But Wi-Fi scanning consumes a large amount of energy on smartphones because they perform <b>full</b> <b>scans,</b> i. e. all the channels in their band(s) are visited. This inefficient behavior greatly reduces battery life, raising the threshold for user acceptance. We propose a novel, incremental approach that reduces the energy consumption of Wi-Fi localization by scanning just a few selected channels. We evaluate our incremental scanning approach on eight Android devices using traces from five test subjects. Our results show that, compared to <b>full</b> <b>scans,</b> incremental scanning can reduce the energy consumption between 20. 64 % and 57. 79 %. The modern smartphones included in our study all show an energy reduction of at least 40 %. I...|$|R

500|$|Symantec {{introduced}} Version 2005 on August 17, 2004. This {{version is}} {{sometimes referred to}} with the tagline of [...] "AntiSpyware Edition", since spyware detection is integrated with Norton and is by default enabled. Found threats are listed, separating the ones already dealt with and the ones requiring user interaction. More detailed information is provided through a link to Symantec's website. However, PC Pro and PC Magazine noted lengthy scan times. A <b>full</b> <b>scan</b> took 24 minutes to over half an hour, respectively. In PC Pro testing, Norton detected 61 percent of the spyware samples, compared {{to an average of}} 68 percent for all the tested products. Removal rates were above average, 72 percent versus the average of 68 percent. Norton blocked reinstallation with a score of 48 percent, compared to the group average of 43 percent. Overall, Norton ranked fifth among the tested products. In PC Magazine testing, Norton installed slowly on infected systems and failed to install on one altogether. Contacting Symantec did not resolve the issue.|$|E

2500|$|Two {{major issues}} with {{development}} of the reference phantoms are difficulty in obtaining useful images and handling {{the large amount of}} data created from these images. [...] CT scans give the human body a large dose of ionizing radiation – something the computational phantom was designed to circumvent in the first place. [...] MRI images {{take a long time to}} process. [...] Furthermore, most scans of a single subject cover only a small portion of the body, whereas a <b>full</b> <b>scan</b> series is needed for useful data. [...] Handling this data is also difficult. [...] While the newer computers had hard drives large enough to store the data, the memory requirements for processing the images to the desired voxel size were often too steep.|$|E
2500|$|When {{collecting}} {{data in the}} <b>full</b> <b>scan</b> mode, a target range of mass fragments is determined and put into the instrument's method. [...] An example of a typical broad range of mass fragments to monitor would be m/z 50 to m/z 400. [...] The determination of what range to use is largely dictated by what one anticipates being in the sample while being cognizant of the solvent and other possible interferences. [...] A MS should not be set to look for mass fragments too low or else one may detect air (found as m/z 28 due to nitrogen), carbon dioxide (m/z 44) or other possible interference. [...] Additionally if one {{is to use a}} large scan range then sensitivity of the instrument is decreased due to performing fewer scans per second since each scan will have to detect a wide range of mass fragments.|$|E
