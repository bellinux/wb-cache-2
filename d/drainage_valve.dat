40|$|Aim of the study: The {{purpose of}} the present study was to compare the use of a conven-tional {{underwater}} seal device with suction and a flutter <b>valve</b> <b>drainage</b> bag for pleural drainage after lung surgery. Patients and Methods: Altogether 59 patients undergoing elective lung surgery ex-cept pneumonectomy between February 2001 and April 2002 were prospectively rand-omized to receive postoperative pleural drainage by 28 F chest tube(s) attached to un-derwater seal device placed on negative pressure of 15 cm of water or flutter valve drain-age bag. Following withdrawal of four patients from the study, 55 patients were evalu-ated (31 patients in the underwater seal device group and 24 patients in the flutter <b>valve</b> <b>drainage</b> bag group). Results: In the conventional underwater seal device group the mean drainage time was 2. 6 (SD ± 2. 0) days and in the flutter <b>valve</b> <b>drainage</b> bag group the mean drainage time was 3. 3 days (SD ± 4. 0); difference – 0. 8, 95 % confidence interval (CI) – 2. 4 to 0. 9.

There are situations in which classical surgery-trabeculectomy- has no theoretical chance of success (in cases of neovascular glaucoma, secondary glaucoma, and inflammatory glaucoma post vitreoretinal surgery), [5, 6].

Design: Prospective interventional case series. Patient and methods: Eleven eyes of 11 patients with iris and anterior chamber angle neovascularization with refractory intraocular pressure were treated with intravitreal injection of 1. 25 mg bevacizumab (Avastin&reg;). The study group included eight males and three females aged 23 to 77 years (average, 62 years). Out of the 11 cases, five had proliferative diabetic retinopathy, of whom two had undergone vitrectomy for tractional retinal detachment and vitreous hemorrhage, and six were secondary to ischemic central retinal vein occlusion (CRVO). All patients were followed for eight to 16 months (average, 10 months). Results: Iris and anterior chamber angle neovascularization receded in all eyes after one to three injections at monthly intervals. In five eyes, neovascularization recurred during the follow-up period. The intraocular pressure normalized in one eye. Four eyes were controlled with antiglaucoma drops. A cyclodestructive procedure was required in two eyes. An Ahmet <b>drainage</b> <b>valve</b> was implanted in four eyes, including one controlled with additional antiglaucoma drops and {{one in which the}} intraocular pressure remained high while on maximum antiglaucoma medication and a cyclodestructive procedure was scheduled.

40|$|Irrigation of high-value {{vegetable}} crops on sandy soils {{with poor}} waterretention capacities {{may result in}} fertilizer nitrogen (N) displacement below the effective root zone prior to complete crop uptake. As a result, fertilizer N-uptake efficiency (FUE) of vegetable crops is often relatively low, thereby increasing the potential risk of groundwater contamination. The objective {{of this study was}} to determine how time of exposure of the root zone to the N fertilizer (which is referred to as "fertilizer residence time'' or t(R)), as related to irrigation management, affects N uptake, FUE, growth, and yield of bell pepper (Capsicum annuum L.). Plants were grown in PVC columns with 45 kg of soil equipped with a <b>drainage</b> <b>valve</b> in the bottom of the column. Weekly irrigation with dissolved fertilizers (potassium nitrate; KNO 3) was applied 1, 3, or 7 d before weekly removal of residual soil N by leaching. Weekly N uptake rates were calculated by comparing total N recovery between unplanted (reference) and planted columns. At 77 d after planting, increasing the t(R) from 1 to 3 or 7 d increased the weekly N uptake from 1. 4 to 10. 8 and/or 13. 3 kg N ha(- 1), respectively. Total calculated plant N accumulations were 19, 72, and 106 kg N ha(- 1) for the 1 -, 3 -, and 7 d t(R) treatments, with overall FUE values being 8, 31, and 45 %, respectively. It is concluded that during initial growth crop, uptake capacity is limiting, and more frequent (daily) fertilizer injection into the irrigation water may be required to enhance FUE. It is proposed also that via sound or innovative irrigation management practices, fertilizer retention in the root zone can be enhanced, thereby improving crop growth, yield, and FUE while reducing production cost and potential environmental impacts...|$|E

40|$|In {{many parts}} of the world, and {{particularly}} in semi-arid and arid regions, shallow foundations are located above the ground water table where the soil is typically in a state of unsaturated conditions. The capillary stresses (i. e., matric suction or negative pore water pressure) above the ground water table contribute significantly towards the bearing capacity of unsaturated soils. However, the bearing capacity contribution due to the capillary stresses is routinely ignored in the conventional engineering design of shallow foundations. The bearing capacity of unsaturated soil is also estimated using conventional approaches that are used for saturated soils ignoring the influence of matric suction. This is a conservative approach used in the design of shallow foundations for unsaturated soils. For this reason, {{it is important to understand}} the influence of matric suction on the bearing capacity of unsaturated soils. In addition, a framework to interpret the bearing capacity of unsaturated soils that takes account of the influence of matric suction will be useful. In the present research program, an extensive experimental study is undertaken to investigate the bearing capacity of a compacted coarse-grained soil under both saturated and unsaturated conditions. Two different series of tests were carried out in a bearing capacity tank using two different sizes of square shaped model footings (i. e. 100 mm x 100 mm and 150 mm x 150 mm). The bearing capacity tank of the size 900 mm x 900 mm and 750 mm height was specially designed and fabricated in the University of Ottawa, Faculty of Engineering Student Workshop to undertake the present research program. The first series of tests were conducted to determine the bearing capacity of the compacted sand in the tank under fully saturated conditions. The second series of tests were conducted to study the influence of matric suction on the bearing capacity of compacted sand under different unsaturated conditions. The ground water table level in the bearing capacity tank was varied using the <b>drainage</b> <b>valves</b> to achieve different values of matric suction below the model footings. The variation of the matric suction with respect to depth below the model footing was measured using four commercial Tensiometers. These Tensiometers were located at different depths in the proximity of the expected stress bulb (i. e., 1. 5 times the width of the footing) below the loaded footing. In addition, piezometers were also placed in the tank to monitor the ground water table levels. The model footings were loaded using a loading frame until failure to measure the bearing capacity. The sand used in the bearing capacity tank was compacted to achieve a density index value of approximately equal to 65 % such that the failure of the footing will be in accordance with the general shear failure criteria. The experimental results of the test program demonstrated that the bearing capacity of unsaturated soils is approximately 5 to 7 times higher than the bearing capacity of the same soil under saturated conditions. As expected, there was a non-linear increase in the bearing capacity of the compacted sand with an increase in the matric suction under the model footings. In addition, it was also observed that there is a relationship between the soil-water retention curve (SWRC) and the bearing capacity of unsaturated soils. Terzaghi's bearing capacity theory for saturated soils was extended to interpret the bearing capacity of unsaturated soils using the saturated shear strength parameters and taking account of the influence of the matric suction. In addition, a simple technique was proposed for predicting the variation of the bearing the capacity of unsaturated soils using the soil-water retention curve (SWRC) and the saturated shear strength parameters. The proposed prediction procedure was similar to the procedure used for predicting the shear strength of unsaturated soils by Vanapalli et al. (1996). The procedure proposed for predicting the bearing capacity of unsaturated soils was extended for another four soils, of which two of them were coarse-grained and the other two were fine-grained in nature. The data for the four soils was obtained from the literature. The results of the study suggest that the variation of the bearing capacity of unsaturated soils can be reasonably well predicted using the SWRC and the saturated shear strength parameters. The framework of the research program developed based on the studies undertaken on model footings shows considerable promise for extending it to field studies...|$|R

Tuberculosis lesions are mainly localized in the lungs, but other organs can also be affected.

Patients and methods. We observed 44 patients (44 eyes) with secondary neovascular glaucoma on the background of post-thrombotic and proliferative diabetic retinopathy. Patient age averaged 60, 84 ± 1, 29 years. Males — 19, females — 25. The patients were divided into two groups depending on the used drainages and drainage devices. In Group I the standard sinus trabeculectomy with Glautex drainage was performed in 23 patients. The II group included 21 patients who were implanted Ahmed valve. Results. According to the results of our research the relative hypotensive effect was in groups I and II, respectively, 52. 2 % (12 / 23) and 79. 4 % (17 / 21) 1 year after surgery; 43. 5 % (10 / 23) and 71. 4 % (15 / 21) — 2 years after surgery; 39. 1 % (9 / 23) and 66. 7 % (14 / 21) — after 3 years of follow up. The maximum decrease in IOP was observed immediately after surgery in the analyzed groups, 66. 8 % and 64. 5 %, respectively. There was no surgical treatment effect for 3 years in Group I in 60. 8 % (14 / 23), in group II — 33. 3 % (7 / 21) of the cases. Conclusion. The analysis of clinical and functional results of surgical treatment of patients with neovascular glaucoma in terms of 3 years follow up showed that the most lasting preservation of visual function and the hypotensive effect was achieved after implantation of the Ahmed valve — in 66. 7 % of the cases.

40|$|Actuality. Glaucoma is an {{expected}} complication of many congenital eyeball malformations, such as aniridia, microcornea, consequence of mesenchymal dysgenesis with {{the formation of}} Frank — Kamenetz or Rieger syndromes, on the background of postoperative aphakia or after implantation of the «artificial iris — IOL» complex in children with congenital aniridia. Antihypertensive drug therapy gives only a partial effect in these cases, but excessive post-operative scarring nullifies results of fistulizing surgery even with antimetabolites and requires, as a rule, of numerous surgical procedures with transient hypotensive effect and following inexorable decrease of visual function. Purpose. To assess the level and duration of the hypotensive effect and nature of the complications of Ahmed valve system implantation with various forms of glaucoma in children. Patients and methods. Retrospective analysis of the effectiveness of implanted Ahmed valve system in 22 children (27 eyes) from 2008 to  2014 was made. 17 of them had previous antiglaucomatous surgery, such as trabeculectomy, cryo- and laser destruction of ciliary body. In 4 patients with congenital aniridia after implantation of the complex «artificial iris — IOL» and in one patient with postoperative aphakia the drainage surgery was the primary intervention and performed on both eyes. Results. As a result of Ahmed valve implantation in 25 cases the IOP compensation was achieved within 15 ‑ 17 mmHg by Maklakov, 23 — without additional medication. In 6 % of cases, the formation of fibrous capsule {{around the base of the}} drainage was the indication for needling, which was accompanied by a successful activation of the drainage system. In one case, the epithelial ingrowth with occlusion of the capillary was observed in the course of the wound channel, it required the implantation of a second drainage in free quadrant of the eyeball. Reduced visual function after surgery was observed in only one patient as a result of hemorrhagic choroidal detachment, the cause of it can bea post-operative hypotension and absence of forming structures on the background of aphakia and avitria. Conclusion. Thus, the implantation of the Ahmed <b>valve</b> <b>drainage</b> is sufficiently safe and effective method of surgical treatment of glaucoma in children and can be recommended as the operation of choice in such forms as secondary aphakic glaucoma and glaucoma in children with aniridia after implantation of the «artificial iris — IOL complex». </p...|$|R

The accumulated eye fluid inside the anterior chamber causes high intraocular pressure (IOP), which is transmitted onto the retina in the back of the eyeball (globe), continuously suppressing and damaging the patient’s optic nerves; this may lead to total blindness if not treated properly. The current most-popular IOP monitoring technique is to use applanation tonometry, which applies applanation force onto the cornea and measures the resulting deformation in order to calculate the IOP. Even though applanation tonometry can provide quite useful information about patients’ IOP, continuous monitoring of IOP is required for ophthalmologists to understand the IOP fluctuation of the patients, something which still cannot be achieved via current applanation approach. In addition, applanation tonometry requires skillful operation performed by well-trained professionals, such as ophthalmologists, making continuous IOP monitoring impractical. In this work, we have developed a telemetric IOP sensor that is capable of monitoring IOP wirelessly and continuously. As the quality factor drops when a telemetric IOP sensor is implanted in the anterior chamber, due to the high loss tangent of the saline-based aqueous humor (0. 2) compared to air (0. 0), a modified IOP sensor is developed to monitor IOP with sensing coil that is left exposed after implantation in order to avoid interruption from the eye fluid. Another approach is also proposed and tested to demonstrate that the quality factor can also be recovered by covering the sensing coil with low loss tangent materials. Currently glaucoma is treated mostly by taking oral medications or applying eye drops. However, some glaucoma patients do not respond to those medications. Therefore, another physical approach, using a glaucoma drainage device (GDD), is necessary in order to drain out excessive eye fluid and serve as a long-term way to manage the increased IOP. Current commercially available glaucoma drainage devices do not have reliable valve systems to stop the drainage when the IOP falls into the normal range. Therefore, we have developed a dual-valved GDD to fulfill the “band-pass” flow regulation which drains out eye fluid only when IOP is higher than 20 mmHg, and stops <b>drainage</b> (closes the <b>valve)</b> when IOP is lower than 20 mmHg to prevent hypotony. The key component of GDD is a normally closed (NC) check-valve, which only opens to drain away the excess fluid when the pressure is higher than 20 mmHg. The proposed paradigm of our NC check-valve is to have a couple of parylene-C pre-stressed slanted tethers to provide the desired cracking pressure. The slanted tethers are achieved in this thesis by: 1) slanted photoresist generated by gray-scale photolithography, 2) pop-up mechanism, and 3) self-stiction bonding mechanism. The built-in residual tensile stress can be controlled by mechanical stretching or thermal annealing. The protecting mechanism preventing the unwanted drainage when the eyes experience sudden unpredicted high IOP is achieved by utilizing a normally open (NO) check-valve. A “minimally invasive implantation” procedure is proposed in the thesis to implant the GDD subconjunctivally. The small size of the device allows its insertion using a # 19 -gauge needle. To accurately design the desired cracking pressure and also predict the lifetime of the NC check-valve, parylene-C’s mechanical, thermal, and polymer properties are investigated. The results show that the properties of parylene-C are highly process-temperature-dependent and therefore can be tailored by adjusting the thermal annealing process. </p...|$|R
