500|$|Jesse Hassenger of PopMatters {{found the}} finale to be [...] "breathlessly paced". However, the writer was also {{dissatisfied}} with the cliffhanger, and hoped that the second season would not increase the series' focus on Veronica's relationships. Hassenger wrote, [...] "so far, the series has eschewed the relationship angst so common in other teen-centric shows; Neptune hearts get broken, yes, but the show never stoops to that will-they-or-won't-they dynamic. Veronica is that rare television character who's too interesting for love triangles." [...] Filip Vukcevic of IGN thought that while {{the resolution of the}} murder was satisfying, it could have been better; [...] "I liked the way everything played out, but I didn't get the Sixth Sense moment I was hoping for. I wanted the season finale to blow my mind, instead all <b>it</b> <b>got</b> <b>out</b> of me was, 'Ah, I see. That's cool.'" [...] Vukcevic wrote that the pace of the season increased exponentially, and was at its best during the final episode. Both reviewers praised Rob Thomas's use of red herrings. Vukcevic felt that [...] "as the finale approaches you are led to believe that the murderer could be any one of several different people - not any easy thing to pull off convincingly. What makes good TV is audience participation. If you feel for a character or are puzzling out a mystery, you're involved. And when you're involved, you're having a good time." [...] Hassenger cited Lianne, Duncan and Logan as the main red herrings.|$|E
2500|$|Jeremy Morlock, a 22-year-old Army {{specialist}} from Wasilla, Alaska, {{was sentenced}} to 22 years in prison, reduction to the lowest enlisted grade and a dishonorable discharge by a military tribunal. Morlock pleaded guilty to three counts of premeditated murder, conspiracy, obstruction of justice and illegal drug use. He will become eligible for parole after serving 7 years in federal prison. He has agreed to testify against the other soldiers allegedly involved. During his hearing he was asked by Judge Lieutenant Colonel Kwasi Hawks [...] "Were you going to shoot at (civilians) to scare them and <b>it</b> <b>got</b> <b>out</b> of hand?". Morlock replied: [...] "The plan was to kill people, sir". Morlock challenged his guilty plea, but the Army Court of Criminal Appeals affirmed the conviction and sentence.|$|E
2500|$|In {{the early}} 1970s, an American nurse {{committed}} suicide and the Paranoid album {{was found on}} her turntable. The album's possible influence in her decision to commit suicide was mentioned in the inquest, but ultimately {{it was decided that}} Black Sabbath were not to blame for her death. [...] "A lot of the words in the songs a lot of the moods of the songs are aggressive," [...] Iommi acknowledged. [...] "Especially in the early days Satanic, if you like... That was the way it felt, so that was the way we played. But <b>it</b> <b>got</b> <b>out</b> of hand. With Paranoid in England, for instance. There was a girl found dead a nurse she was: dead in her room with our album on the turntable going round. And it was taken to court saying that {{it was because of the}} album that she was depressed and killed herself, which was totally ridiculous, I think." ...|$|E

2500|$|By 2006, Dobson {{returned}} to the studio to finish her second album, Sunday Love. [...] Musicians and songwriters she collaborated with during the recording process include Holly Knight, Nina Gordon, Kay Hanley, John 5, Billy Steinberg, Matthew Wilder, Cyndi Lauper, Courtney Love, Joan Jett, and Rancid's Tim Armstrong. Sunday Love was not released at the time, due to Dobson being terminated by Island Records {{just days before the}} album was scheduled for release. The album was reviewed favorably in both Spin and Vibe magazine. [...] "My real good fans, my hardcore fans, have it, so that's most important," [...] Dobson says. [...] "At least <b>it</b> <b>got</b> <b>out</b> there to a few hands, and now it's time to make a record on my own terms." [...] "It was sad," [...] says Dobson. [...] "But instead of sitting there and being depressed and begging people for the record, I went back to the studio, got people that I knew, friends that I knew, and I started again." ...|$|E
2500|$|The city {{suffered}} a large {{fire in the}} night from 22 October to 23 October 1576. The fire started in brewery het Ankertje, near the weighhouse at the Spaarne, which was used by mercenaries as a guarding place. When they were warming themselves at a fire <b>it</b> <b>got</b> <b>out</b> of control. The fire was spotted by farmers, who sailed [...] their ships on the river. However, the soldiers turned down all help, saying that they would {{put out the fire}} themselves. This failed, and the fire destroyed almost 500 buildings, among them St-Gangolf's church and St-Elisabeth's hospital. Most of the mercenaries were later arrested, {{and one of them was}} hanged on the Grote Markt in front of a large audience. Maps from that era clearly show the damage done by the fire: a wide strip through the city was destroyed. The combined result of the siege and the fire was that about a third of the city was destroyed.|$|E

However, the [...] "much-quoted claims that she taught him the joys of oral sex is viewed with skepticism by other lovers of the King." [...] In an interview, Shepherd reveals that Presley kissed her all over her naked body – but refused to have oral sex with her. His slow tender kisses ended at her bellybutton. Elvis explained to her, [...] "Me and the guys talk and, well, we don't eat pussy." [...] She always knew their relationship was doomed and they wouldn't last as a couple. She says, [...] "The fact is, Elvis got hooked on speed in the army. ... Then <b>it</b> <b>got</b> <b>out</b> of control. Did I {{want to be with}} someone who would have dragged me down?

2500|$|Although {{employment}} in Birmingham's restricted manufacturing sector shrank by 10% between 1951 and 1966, {{this was more}} than made up during the early post-war period for by {{employment in}} the service sector, which grew from 35% of the city's workforce in 1951 to 45% in 1966. As the commercial centre of the country's most successful regional economy, Central Birmingham was the main focus outside London for the post-war office building boom. Service sector employment in the Birmingham conurbation grew faster than in any other region between 1953 and 1964, and the same period saw 3 million sq ft of office space constructed in the city centre and Edgbaston. The city's economic boom saw the rapid growth of a substantial merchant banking sector, as major London and international banks established themselves within the city, and professional and scientific services, finance and insurance also grew particularly strongly. However this service sector growth itself attracted government restrictions from 1965. Declaring the growth in population and employment within Birmingham to be a [...] "threatening situation", the incoming Labour Government of 1964 sought [...] "to control the growth of office accommodation in Birmingham {{and the rest of the}} Birmingham conurbation before <b>it</b> <b>got</b> <b>out</b> of hand, in the same way as they control the growth of industrial employment". Although the City Council had encouraged service sector expansion during the late 1950s and early 1960s, central government extended the Control of Office Employment Act 1965 to the Birmingham conurbation from 1965, effectively banning all further office development for almost two decades.|$|E
2500|$|When {{asked whether}} the members {{consider}} Believer a [...] "Christian band" [...] Daub replies {{in an interview with}} Metal Covenant in 2009: [...] "Well, yes, and no... this is a difficult subject to approach for us. Ever since we formed Believer, Kurt Bachman and myself despised being limited to a certain belief or style of music. We did not like to be labeled or numbered. Whether it was our personal spiritual journey, or the type of music we played. We were called thrash, death metal, technical death metal etc. The key focus for us then and now is to just encourage people to think for themselves." [...] Daub comments about the lyrics that [...] "We always wrote about what was near and dear to our heart. On Extraction, we used Bible based themes and stories to express our intentions, but {{we did not want to}} preach." [...] "Well we never wanted to be known as a Christian band for one [...] It was one of these things where <b>it</b> <b>got</b> <b>out</b> of control. With promoting records it was one of those things where the record company was like “Hey, here’s a slant. Something different. [...] Something new and unique. Let’s go for that”. I’ve always tried to stay away from labeling the band. For me it’s a band, it’s entertainment. We even get called death metal some times even though I don’t think we resemble anything death metal-ish out there, but then again I have my own opinions on what death metal is. We just don’t want it to be one of those things where someone’s like “oh I hate thrash music, so I won’t like Believer”. You get labeled and we’re going to have to go through labels but we’re not really comfortable with any." [...] says Bachman in an interview on MetalSucks.|$|E
