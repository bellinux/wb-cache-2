40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to clarify the effects of {{compression}} by means of sports socks (CG socks) on the ankle knesthesia. Thirteen subjects were participated. In order to accomplish the purpose, we assessed a position <b>sense,</b> movement <b>sense,</b> <b>force</b> <b>sense,</b> and sensorymotor function during under three different conditions: subjects wore the normal socks that are distributed generally (normal socks condition), wore the CG socks (CG socks condition), and did not wear any socks (barefoot condition). The position <b>sense</b> and <b>force</b> <b>sense</b> were assessed in a reproduction task of ankle joint angle and force output during plantar/dorsiflexion, respectively. The movement sense was assessed by the threshold of detection for passive movement. The sensory motor function was assessed during our original Kinetic–Equilibrating task. The results showed that the movement <b>sense,</b> <b>force</b> <b>sense,</b> and sensorymotor function significantly improved in the CG socks condition compared to the other two conditions. These results suggested that the compression by means of the CG socks might improve the perception of the changes of joint angle and the extent of force output.

Design: A randomised, double-blind controlled trial. Participants: 48 healthy women aged 22. 6 ± 0. 4 years with a mean body mass index of 22. 8 ± 0. 37 kg/m 2 and percentage of body fat of 15. 4 ± 1. 5 %. Methods: In the experimental group, a crushed-ice pack was applied to the shoulder for 15 min, whereas participants in the control group applied a sand of bag at skin temperature, also for 15 min. An isokinetic dynamometer was used to assess maximal voluntary contraction, <b>force</b> <b>sense,</b> joint position sense, and the threshold for detecting passive movement. Results: Paired sample t-tests revealed that maximal voluntary isometric contraction decreased significantly after cryotherapy (p ≤. 001), or approximately 10 % of the reduction found in both muscular groups assessed. Shoulder position sense (p <. 001) and the threshold for detecting passive movement (p =. 010 and p=. 009 for lateral and medial shoulder rotator muscles, respectively) also suffered significant impairment. Nevertheless, no significant differences emerged in <b>force</b> <b>sense</b> at 20 % and 50 % of maximal force reproduction (p =. 410 and p =. 097 for lateral rotator muscles at 20 % and 50 %, respectively; and, p =. 197 and p =. 090 for medial rotator muscles at 20 % and 50 %, respectively).

The underlying principle of the biofeedback consisted of supplying subjects with supplementary information about the force developed by the plantar-flexor muscles through electrical stimulation of the tongue. Measures of the overall accuracy and the variability of the force ankle-matching performances were determined using the absolute error and the variable error, respectively. Results showed that (1) the Fatigue condition yielded increased absolute and variable errors relative to the No fatigue condition in the No biofeedback condition, whereas (2) {{no significant difference between the}} two No fatigue and Fatigue conditions was observed in the Biofeedback condition.

The objective of this study is to investigate the effects of local and general fatigue on <b>sense</b> of <b>force</b> and their comparison in healthy young men. Material & Methods: this Quasi-Experimental study by cross over design was conducted on 20 healthy young men recruited by simple convenient sampling from 20 - 40 years old staffs in national Iranian oil company.

The minifactory is a high-precision assembly system that makes use of low DOF robots to cooperatively perform higher DOF tasks.

In particular, methods were sought which would allow the extension of simple robot capabilities from the "pick and place" function to the less ordered domain of assembly. Three approaches towards correcting the gross misalignment of a peg and hole are described. An established method of facilitating assembly involves the vibration of the contacting misaligned components. This technique was studied {{with respect to the}} behaviour of an elastically constrained peg under the action of a rotating force. The study was limited initially to a relatively straightforward analysis of simplified situations, then, in order to allow the prediction of the behaviour of practical systems a program was developed which simulated the behaviour of a general nine degree-of-freedom assembly system. This work led to the second approach where the possibility of using the vibrational motion of the contacting components as feedback for position sensing was investigated.
