50|$|Foreclosure by {{power of}} sale, {{also known as}} nonjudicial foreclosure, is {{authorized}} by many states if a power of sale clause {{is included in the}} mortgage or if a deed of trust with such a clause was used, instead of an actual mortgage. In some states, like California and Texas, nearly all so-called mortgages are actually deeds of trust. This process involves the sale of the property by the mortgage holder without court supervision (as elaborated upon below). This process is generally much faster and cheaper than foreclosure by judicial sale. As in <b>judicial</b> sale, the <b>mortgage</b> holder and other lien holders are respectively first and second claimants to the proceeds from the sale.|$|R

It highlights the key legislative and institutional reforms leading {{to the development of}} primary and secondary mortgage markets and reports the main features and valuation practices of the RMBS markets. The paper identifies areas warranting close attention to improve the outlook for the Mexican RMBS market and draws some lessons from the recent U. S. subprime mortgage market problems.

40|$|We {{show that}} the lightly {{regulated}} non-bank mortgage originators contributed disproportionately to the recent boom-bust housing cycle. Using comprehensive data on mortgage originations, which we aggregate at the county level, we first establish that the market share of these independent non-bank lenders increased in virtually all US counties during the boom. We then exploit the heterogeneity in the market share of independent lenders across counties as of 2005 and show that higher market participation by these lenders is associated with increased foreclosure filing rates {{at the onset of}} the housing downturn. We carefully control for counties'' economic, demographic, and housing market characteristics using both parametric and semi-nonparametric methods. We show that this relation between the pre-crisis market share of independents and the rise in foreclosure is more pronounced in less regulated states. The macroeconomic consequences of our findings are significant: we {{show that the}} market share of these lenders as of 2005 is also a strong predictor of the severity of the housing downturn and subsequent rise in unemployment. Overall our findings lend support to the view that more stringent regulation could have averted some of the volatility on the housing market during the recent boom-bust episode.

40|$|Today, {{virtually}} all mortgages contain acceleration clauses permitting the mortgagee {{to accelerate the}} mortgage indebtedness upon default by the mortgagor as defined in the mortgage loan documentation. Section 8. 1 of the new Restatement (Third) of Property: Mortgages [hereinafter Mortgages Restatement] 1 endorses the view that these mortgage acceleration provisions are generally enforceable after default {{in accordance with their}} terms. Following default and acceleration, the mortgagor may prevent foreclosure only by redeeming the property from the mortgage debt, i. e., “only by paying or tendering to the mortgagee the full accelerated mortgage obligation. ” Section 8. 1 (d) (3), however, places certain constraints upon the mortgagee 2 ̆ 7 s right to accelerate, permitting the mortgagor to reinstate (after curing any existing defaults) if “the mortgagee has engaged in fraud, bad faith, or other conduct making acceleration unconscionable. ” This standard has a significant <b>judicial</b> pedigree in <b>mortgage</b> law decisions, but its use of the elusive term “bad faith” [...] a term often understood in the context of its more honorable twin, “good faith” [...] creates the potential for uncertainty in the evaluation of disputes over the enforcement of acceleration provisions...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: In {{a recent}} set of {{influential}} papers, researchers {{have argued that}} residential mortgage foreclosures reduce the sale prices of nearby properties. We revisit this issue using a more robust identification strategy combined with new data that contain information on the location of properties secured by seriously delinquent mortgages and information {{on the condition of}} foreclosed properties. We find that while properties in virtually all stages of distress have statistically significant, negative effects on nearby home values, the magnitudes are economically small, peak before the distressed properties complete the foreclosure process, and go to zero about a year after the bank sells the property to a new homeowner. The estimates are very sensitive to the condition of the distressed property, with a positive correlation existing between house price growth and foreclosed properties identified as being in “above average ” condition. We argue that the most plausible explanation for these results is an externality resulting from reduced investment by owners of distressed property. Our analysis shows that policies that slow the transition from delinquency to foreclosure likely exacerbate the negative effect of mortgage distress on house prices.
