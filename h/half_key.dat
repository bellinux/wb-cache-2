40|$|Computer {{security}} {{is one of}} the most important parameters considered in any computer system to prevent any data misuse by an unauthorized / outside intrusion. Cryptography is one technique for data / computer security. In this paper, we have proposed a technique for a more secure data transfer which is a alteration to the classical public key crytogarphy method known as Unique Information Based Secure RSA. This method is based on public key cryptography scheme. In Unique Information Based Secure (UI SECURE) RSA public key of a user is derived from his/her unique identity such as email id, phone number. With the use of UI SECURE RSA, there is no need of public key certificates. It has a special entity called SEM. SEM is an on-line partially trusted server. For using services of SEM, a user needs to obtain an identity based token from SEM. A message cannot be encrypted or decrypted without this token. UI SECURE RSA divides the private key of the user in two parts: one part is given to the user and the other to the SEM. Both parts of the key are used to encrypt/decrypt the message. This technique is very secure as the key cannot be derived using <b>half</b> <b>key...</b>|$|E
40|$|BACKGROUND: Mammalian conceptuses {{typically}} have an approximately regular tetrahedral shape at the 4 -cell stage. In the rabbit, {{this has been}} attributed to both 2 -cell blastomeres dividing meridionally, but with the animal– vegetal axis of the second blastomere to divide rotating through roughly 90 ° before or during cytokinesis. The aim {{of the present study was}} to ascertain whether this was also true for the mouse. METHODS AND RESULTS: First, the distribution in regular tetrahedral 4 -cell conceptuses of fluorescent microspheres applied to the vegetal polar region of one or both blastomeres at the 2 -cell stage was analysed. Second, the ability of 2 -cell stages to form regular tetrahedral 4 -cell conceptuses after the previtelline space had been gelated to prevent blastomeres from rotating was also investigated. Neither experiment yielded evidence supporting blastomere rotation during second cleavage. Rather, the findings were consistent with the regular tetrahedral form of 4 -cell conceptus resulting from meridional division of one blastomere and approximately equatorial division of the other. CONCLUSIONS: Second cleavage in the mouse typically yields 4 -cell conceptuses with three distinct types of blastomere. While both products of the meridional division include all axial levels of the zygote, those of the equatorial division acquire only its vegetal or animal <b>half.</b> <b>Key</b> words: equatorial division/meridional division/mouse conceptuses/regular tetrahedral 4 -cell/second cleavag...|$|E

40|$|Abstract. A {{combination}} of analytical and statistical methods {{is used to}} improve a tablet coating process guided by quality by design (QbD) principles. A solid dosage form product was found to intermittently exhibit bad taste. A suspected cause was the variability in coating thickness {{which could lead to}} the subject tasting the active ingredient in some tablets. A number of samples were analyzed using a laserinduced breakdown spectroscopy (LIBS) -based analytical method, and {{it was found that the}} main variability component was the tablet-to-tablet variability within a lot. Hence, it was inferred that the coating process (performed in a perforated rotating pan) required optimization. A set of designed experiments along with response surface modeling and kriging method were used to arrive at an optimal set of operating conditions. Effects of the amount of coating imparted, spray rate, pan rotation speed, and spray temperature were characterized. The results were quantified in terms of the relative standard deviation of tablet-averaged LIBS score and a coating variability index which was the ratio of the standard deviation of the tablet-averaged LIBS score and the weight gain of the tablets. The data-driven models developed based on the designed experiments predicted that the minimum value of this index would be obtained for a 6 % weight gain for a pan operating at the highest speed at the maximum fill level while using the lowest spraying rate and temperature from the chosen parametric space. This systematic application of the QbD-based method resulted in an enhanced process understanding and reducing the coating variability by more than <b>half.</b> <b>KEY</b> WORDS: kriging; LIBS; quality by design; response surface; tablet coating...|$|E
