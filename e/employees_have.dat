5|$|The company {{focuses on}} {{creating}} video games that provoke emotional responses from players. Its <b>employees</b> <b>have</b> stated that, {{while they are}} not opposed to making action-oriented games, they believe that enough such titles are released by the established video game industry. When designing a game, Thatgamecompany employees start by mapping out what they want the player to feel, rather than by establishing game mechanics. <b>Employees</b> <b>have</b> stated that the company does not plan to produce large, blockbuster titles, due to their belief that the pressure for high sales would stifle innovation.|$|E
5|$|Portia de Rossi as Veronica Palmer: Veronica is Ted's {{boss and}} {{immediate}} supervisor at Veridian Dynamics. She maintains a fierce and unapproachable workplace demeanor, and many <b>employees</b> <b>have</b> a deep fear of her. She seems cold and calculating, {{but it is}} also clear that she has more than grudging respect for Ted, and often recognizes what moral action is necessary to maintain balance in the workplace. An ongoing subplot touched on sporadically in the first season but more frequently in the second sees Veronica becoming a mentor to Linda and, to a lesser degree, Rose.|$|E

5|$|Calhoun regains {{consciousness}} at {{the bottom}} of the shaft and begins to fight his way to the surface to escape. Emerging near Black Mesa's classification yards, Calhoun learns that Dr. Rosenberg and his colleagues plan to escape the facility using teleportation technology. After freeing Rosenberg from the captivity of the US Marines detachment sent to silence the facility, Calhoun escorts him to a decommissioned prototype teleportation laboratory, where several Black Mesa <b>employees</b> <b>have</b> already gathered. Rosenberg then teleports Calhoun to the Xen border world to calibrate research equipment needed to pinpoint a teleport destination outside of Black Mesa. Upon his return, Rosenberg informs Calhoun that the teleporter's battery power has been exhausted, and contact has been lost with a team sent to acquire a new power cell.|$|E
5|$|During {{the casino}} {{shutdown}}, 36,000 casino workers were given leave. The shutdown of casinos resulted in lost {{revenue for the}} state, as an estimated $1.3 million per day was collected in gambling taxes plus an additional $2 million per day due to {{the closure of the}} lottery system. However, the sum of revenue not collected during the shutdown from gambling amounted to just {{a small fraction of the}} state's annual budget. Atlantic City's 12 casinos suffered losses estimated at $16–20 million per day during the shutdown. Revenue losses to lottery vendors and casino <b>employees</b> <b>have</b> not been calculated. Legislation signed by Governor Corzine in June 2008 would keep casinos and racetracks open in the event of a future budget showdown, with the Governor noting that the casino industry is vital to the New Jersey economy and that it should not operate under the threat of closure as it did in 2006.|$|E
5|$|Schools {{have been}} the center of {{controversy}} over both the anthem and the national flag. The Tokyo Board of Education {{requires the use of}} both the anthem and flag at events under their jurisdiction. The order requires school teachers to respect both symbols or risk losing their jobs. Some have protested that such rules violate the Constitution of Japan, but the Board has argued that since schools are government agencies, their <b>employees</b> <b>have</b> an obligation to teach their students how to be good Japanese citizens. As a sign of protest, schools refused to display the Hinomaru at school graduations and some parents ripped down the flag. Teachers have unsuccessfully brought criminal complaints against Tokyo Governor Shintarō Ishihara and senior officials for ordering teachers to honor the Hinomaru and Kimigayo. After earlier opposition, the Japan Teachers Union accepts the use of both the flag and anthem; the smaller All Japan Teachers and Staffs Union still opposes both symbols and their use inside the school system.|$|E
