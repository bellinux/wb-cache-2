Freshwater habitats {{were not the}} only places to find water filled with organic matter and dense vegetation near the water's edge. Swampy habitats like shallow wetlands, coastal lagoons and large brackish river deltas also existed at this time, and there is much to suggest that this is the <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> <b>environment</b> in which the tetrapods evolved. Early fossil tetrapods have been found in marine sediments, and because fossils of primitive tetrapods in general are found scattered all around the world, they must have spread by following the coastal lines — they could not have lived in freshwater only.|$|E
25|$|During the Heian period Buddhism {{became even}} more infused with Japanese elements: It met and assimilated local beliefs {{concerning}} ghosts and spirits (the so-called onrei and mitama), developing traits close to magic and sorcery which allowed it to penetrate {{a wide spectrum of}} social classes. Its merging with indigenous religious belief was then accelerated by the systematization of the syncretism of Buddhism and local religious beliefs (see the article on the honji suijaku theory, which claimed that Japanese kami were simply Buddhist gods under a different name). It was in this <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> <b>environment</b> that Fujiwara no Michinaga and retired Emperor Shirakawa competed in erecting new temples, in the process giving birth to the Jōdo-kyō architecture and the new wayō architectural style.|$|E

2500|$|The Wii Vitality Sensor was a {{cancelled}} peripheral; a fingertip {{pulse oximeter}} sensor that connected through the Wii Remote. According to Nintendo, the device [...] "will initially sense the user's pulse {{and a number}} of other signals being transmitted by their bodies, and will then provide information to the users about the body’s inner world." [...] The Wii Vitality Sensor was announced by President and CEO Satoru Iwata at Nintendo's E3 2009 media briefing on June 2, 2009. No specific applications were revealed for the device, but when presenting the device Iwata suggested that video games may soon be used for relaxation. According to Nintendo of America president Reggie Fils-Aime, more details concerning the Wii Vitality Sensor were to be showcased during E3 2010, although no mention of the device occurred. Reggie told GameTrailers, [...] "(E3) was not the <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> <b>environment</b> for a game based on relaxation", mentioning they are saving news on the device for another time and place.

Shigeru Miyamoto said that the Wii Vitality Sensor has a difficult time performing consistently across a variety of situations but still may be released.|$|E
