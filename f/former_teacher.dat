The practicing teachers, retired <b>teachers,</b> and <b>former</b> <b>teachers</b> who left for reasons other than retirement generally expressed job satisfaction. Each group disagreed with certain job satisfaction indicator statements. The factor analysis resulted in nine factors being identified: public perceptions, school support, self-perception, expectations, job satisfaction, job challenge, job effectiveness, effort, and status.

5|$|Among the enthusiasms of the Apaches was {{the music}} of Debussy. Ravel, twelve years his junior, had known Debussy {{slightly}} since the 1890s, and their friendship, though never close, continued {{for more than ten}} years. In 1902 André Messager conducted the premiere of Debussy's opera Pelléas et Mélisande at the Opéra-Comique. It divided musical opinion. Dubois unavailingly forbade Conservatoire students to attend, and the conductor's friend and <b>former</b> <b>teacher</b> Camille Saint-Saëns was prominent among those who detested the piece. The Apaches were loud in their support. The first run of the opera consisted of fourteen performances: Ravel attended all of them.|$|E

5|$|For {{the first}} two years of her contract, Bush spent more time on school work than making an album. She left school after doing her mock A-levels and having gained ten GCE O-Level qualifications. In 2005, Bush stated in an {{interview}} with Mark Radcliffe on BBC Radio 2 that she believed EMI signed her before she was ready to make an album so that no other record company could offer her a contract.

5|$|Johansson {{learned some}} Russian from a <b>former</b> <b>teacher</b> {{on the phone}} for her role of Black Widow in The Avengers (2012), another entry from the MCU.

For her performance, she was nominated for two Teen Choice Awards and three People's Choice Awards. Later that year, Johansson portrayed the actress Janet Leigh in Sacha Gervasi's Hitchcock, a behind-the-scenes drama about the making of Alfred Hitchcock's 1960 film Psycho. Roger Ebert believed that Johansson did not look much like Leigh, but conveyed her spunk, intelligence, and sense of humor.|$|E

5|$|The series {{focuses on}} a high school show choir, {{also known as a}} glee club, in the fictional William McKinley High School in Lima, Ohio.

With a rag-tag group of misfit teenagers, Will attempts to restore the glee club to its former glory while tending to his developing feelings for his co-worker, guidance counselor Emma Pillsbury (Jayma Mays), as well as defending the glee club's existence from the conniving cheerleading coach Sue Sylvester (Jane Lynch). A major focus of the series is the students in the glee club: their relationships as couples, their love of singing and desire for popularity coming into conflict due to their membership in the low-status club, and the many vicissitudes of life in high school and as a teenager.|$|E
5|$|Banjo-Kazooie {{is set in}} the Spiral Mountain {{and follows}} the story of Banjo, a male brown honey bear, and Kazooie, a female red-crested Breegull who is always kept in Banjo's backpack. The game begins when a foul-tempered witch named Gruntilda learns from her {{cauldron}} Dingpot that Tooty, Banjo's younger sister, is more beautiful than her. Jealous, Gruntilda creates a machine that can transfer a person's level of beauty to another, which she intends to use with Tooty. She then abducts Tooty from Banjo's house while he is sleeping. In response to the kidnapping, Kazooie wakes Banjo up and the two set out to rescue her. Banjo and Kazooie learn from Tooty's friend, Bottles the mole, that she was captured by Gruntilda and suggests they need some training to collect musical notes and jigsaw pieces to progress through Gruntilda's lair. Along the way, they are aided by Mumbo Jumbo, a shaman and Gruntilda's <b>former</b> <b>teacher.</b>|$|E
5|$|Because Stuyvesant was {{so close}} to the World Trade Center site, there were {{concerns}} of asbestos exposure. The US EPA indicated at that time that Stuyvesant was safe from asbestos, and conducted a thorough cleaning of the Stuyvesant building, but the Stuyvesant High School Parents' Association has contested the accuracy of the assessment. Some problems, including <b>former</b> <b>teacher</b> Mark Bodenheimer's respiratory problems, have been reported—he accepted a transfer to The Bronx High School of Science after having difficulty continuing his work at Stuyvesant. Other isolated cases include Stuyvesant's 2002 Class President Amit Friedlander, who received local press coverage in September 2006 after he was diagnosed with cancer. While there have been other cases linked to the same dust cloud that emanated from Ground Zero, a spot precariously close to Stuyvesant, there is no definitive evidence that such cases have directly affected the Stuyvesant community. Stuyvesant students did spend a full year in the building before the theater and air systems were cleaned, however, and a group of Stuyvesant alumni is currently lobbying for health insurance as a result.|$|E
40|$|The {{teaching}} profession is losing {{some of the}} most talented and experienced teachers to other careers. Understanding why teachers leave the profession is important if one values students encountering teachers with talent and experience. Information from the review of related research indicated that individuals were motivated to enter teaching to serve mankind and because they love the interaction with children. However, with more career opportunities open to women and minorities than ever before, many choose other professions after teaching a few years. Identifying career patterns and combating stereotyped notions of career teachers may help reduce attrition in the {{teaching profession}}. The {{purpose of this study was}} to examine and describe the experiences of <b>former</b> <b>teachers</b> and compare their experiences with what was described in the literature for experienced teachers who are still in teaching positions. This study provided an examination of the factors associated with teacher turnover and the consequences for individual teachers who left the profession. The major emphasis of the study was on identifying the factors which motivated <b>former</b> <b>teachers</b> to teach and factors which influenced <b>former</b> <b>teachers</b> to resign from teaching. ^ The population of the study consisted of <b>former</b> <b>teachers</b> employed by an urban school district in Nebraska during the period. of 1965 - 1985. A complete list of teachers who resigned was secured from a review of the minutes of school board meetings. From this population of sixty-one <b>former</b> <b>teachers</b> who were contacted, thirty-two <b>former</b> <b>teachers</b> agreed to participate. ^ An interview schedule and the Minnesota Satisfaction Questionnaire (MSQ) were used for data collection. Data collected were analyzed to describe demographic characteristics of the sample. Percentages were used to compare demographic information. For the MSQ, scores of the subjects were used to compute group means and standard deviations. The data were reported in narrative and tabular form. ...|$|R

5|$|Chagall also invited other Russian artists, {{most notably}} the painter and art {{theoretician}} Kazimir Malevich and Lissitzky's <b>former</b> <b>teacher,</b> Yehuda Pen. However, {{it was not until}} October 1919 when Lissitzky, then on an errand in Moscow, persuaded Malevich to relocate to Vitebsk. The move coincided {{with the opening of the}} first art exhibition in Vitebsk directed by Chagall. Malevich would bring with him a wealth of new ideas, most of which inspired Lissitzky but clashed with local public and professionals who favored figurative art and with Chagall himself. After going through impressionism, primitivism, and cubism, Malevich began developing and advocating his ideas on suprematism aggressively. In development since 1915, suprematism rejected the imitation of natural shapes and focused more on the creation of distinct, geometric forms. He replaced the classic teaching program with his own and disseminated his suprematist theories and techniques school-wide. Chagall advocated more classical ideals and Lissitzky, still loyal to Chagall, became torn between two opposing artistic paths. Lissitzky ultimately favoured Malevich's suprematism and broke away from traditional Jewish art. Chagall left the school shortly thereafter.|$|E
5|$|Delaney had {{a lifelong}} history of helping others, and once {{paid for the}} funeral of a <b>former</b> <b>teacher</b> whose family could not afford a proper service. On June 29, 1983, Delaney, who was living in nearby Ruston, went with friends to Critter's Creek, an {{amusement}} center at Chennault Park in Monroe, Louisiana. While reportedly discouraging swimming children from venturing too far out in a pond, Delaney dove in to save three children who were screaming for help, floundering in a water hole left by recent construction work. The water hole, which covered two acres and was six feet deep, was not intended for swimming but {{to add to the}} park's aesthetics. Despite his inability to swim, Delaney nevertheless tried to rescue the children. One child managed {{to get out of the}} water without harm and another was taken to an emergency room where he later died; police recovered the body of Delaney and the remaining child. The amusement park has since been closed to the public.|$|E
5|$|Following the Unilateral Declaration of Independence by {{the mostly}} white {{minority}} government of Rhodesia (or Southern Rhodesia) from the United Kingdom in 1965, the southern African country entered {{a period of}} international isolation as an unrecognised state under Ian Smith. Black nationalist movements, backed by communist powers and themselves variously Marxist–Leninist, launched military campaigns to overthrow Rhodesia's government and bring majority rule to the country; the main nationalist groups were the Zimbabwe African National Union (ZANU), which was Chinese-backed, mostly Shona and influenced by Maoism, and the rival Zimbabwe African People's Union (ZAPU), which was largely Ndebele, more orthodoxly Marxist–Leninist {{and supported by the}} Warsaw Pact and associated nations, prominently Cuba. Each nationalist group fielded a guerrilla army—ZANU's was called the Zimbabwe African National Liberation Army (ZANLA), while ZAPU's was the Zimbabwe People's Revolutionary Army (ZIPRA). ZAPU was led by Joshua Nkomo, a trade unionist from Bulawayo in Matabeleland, while ZANU was headed from 1975 by a <b>former</b> <b>teacher</b> from Mashonaland, Robert Mugabe.|$|E

5|$|Following {{the example}} of several of his stage colleagues, Gielgud joined tours of {{military}} camps. He gave recitals of prose and poetry, and acted in a triple bill of short plays, including two from Coward's , but he found at first that less highbrow performers like Beatrice Lillie were better than he at entertaining the troops. He returned to filming in 1940, as Disraeli in Thorold Dickinson's The Prime Minister. In this morale-boosting film he portrayed the politician from ages thirty to seventy; this was, in Morley's view, {{the first time he}} seemed at home before the camera. Gielgud made no more films for the next ten years; he turned down the role of Julius Caesar in the 1945 film of Shaw's Caesar and Cleopatra with Vivien Leigh. He and Leigh were close friends, and Shaw tried hard to persuade him to play the part, but Gielgud had taken a strong dislike to the director, Gabriel Pascal. Caesar was eventually played by Gielgud's <b>former</b> <b>teacher,</b> Claude Rains.|$|E
5|$|In 1882 he {{designed}} a Benedictine monastery and a church {{dedicated to the}} Holy Spirit in Villaricos (Cuevas de Vera, Almeria) for his <b>former</b> <b>teacher,</b> Joan Martorell. It was of neo-Gothic design, similar to the Convent of the Salesians that Gaudí also planned with Martorell. Ultimately it was not carried out, and the project plans were destroyed in the looting of the Sagrada Família in 1936. The same year he was tasked with constructing a hunting lodge and wine cellars at a country residence known as La Cuadra, in Garraf (Sitges), property of baron Eusebi Güell. Ultimately the wine cellars, but not the lodge, were built some years later. With Martorell he also collaborated on three other projects: {{the church of the}} Jesuit School in Carrer Caspe; the Convent of the Salesians in Passeig de Sant Joan, a neo-Gothic project with an altar in the centre of the crossing; and the facade project for Barcelona cathedral, for the competition convened by the cathedral chapter in 1882, ultimately won by Josep Oriol Mestres and August Font i Carreras.|$|E
5|$|Nkomo {{remained}} unchallenged at {{the head}} of ZAPU, but the ZANU leadership had become contested between its founding president, the Reverend Ndabaningi Sithole, and Robert Mugabe, a <b>former</b> <b>teacher</b> from Mashonaland who had recently won an internal election in prison. When they were released in December 1974 under the détente terms, Mugabe went to Mozambique to consolidate his leadership of the guerrillas, while Sithole joined Muzorewa's delegation. It had been agreed that the talks would take place within Rhodesia, but the black nationalists refused to meet on ground they perceived as not neutral. The Rhodesians insisted on abiding by the accord and negotiating inside the country. To please both camps the conference was held on a train halfway across the Victoria Falls Bridge on the border between Rhodesia and Zambia; the delegations sat {{on opposite sides of the}} frontier. The conference, which took place on 26 August 1975 with Kaunda and Vorster as mediators, failed to produce a settlement; each side accused the other of being unreasonable. Smith afterwards held direct talks with Nkomo and ZAPU in Salisbury, but these also led nowhere; Nkomo proposed an immediate transition to an interim government headed by himself, which Smith rejected. Guerrilla incursions picked up strongly in the first months of 1976.|$|E
