5000|$|Concrete cannot {{by itself}} {{withstand}} severe hydrocarbon fires. In the Channel tunnel {{that connects the}} United Kingdom and France, an intense fire broke out and reduced the concrete lining in the undersea tunnel down to about 50 mm. In ordinary building fires, concrete typically achieves excellent fire-resistance ratings, unless it is too wet, which can cause it to crack and explode. For unprotected concrete, the sudden endothermic reaction of the hydrates and unbound humidity inside the concrete generates pressure high enough to spall off the concrete, which falls in small pieces {{on the floor of}} the tunnel. Humidity probes are inserted into all concrete slabs that undergo fire testing to test for this, even for the less severe building elements curve (DIN4102, ASTM E119, BS476, or ULC-S101). The need for fireproofing was demonstrated, among other fire protection measures, in the European [...] "Eureka" [...] Fire Tunnel Research Project, which gave rise to in building codes for the trade to avoid the effects of such fires upon traffic tunnels.

40|$|Concrete {{spalling}} {{can cause}} severe damage to concrete structure {{when exposed to}} fire. The spalling mechanisms are not very well understood. For the testing of spalling, full-scale structural members should be used, as spalling tests are sensitive to size effects. Full-scale testing in large furnace is costly and is not suitable for testing large number of concrete mixture trials. The standard and <b>hydrocarbon</b> <b>fire</b> time temperature curves have rapid temperature rise during the initial phase. This temperature rise requires a gas furnace with high heating capacity and cannot be generated by electric muffle furnace commonly available in many laboratories. This paper presents a method to carry out spalling test in small-scale specimens with exposure to rapid temperature rise using a commonly available electric furnace in the laboratories. The tests are based on 150 mm diameter cylinders that are laterally confined to simulate full-scale structural members. The cylinder surface is exposed to rapid temperature rise by exposing through vertical and/or horizontal holes in pre-heated small electric furnace. Some unconfined 100 mm diameter cylinders were also exposed horizontally to test the performance of confinement.

30|$|As {{noted by}} authors {{going back to}} (at least) 1970, the {{standard}} temperature-time curve is not representative of a real fire in a real building. In order to truly understand the response of real buildings in real fires, tests of structures and structural elements are required under credible worst case natural fire exposures. Depending on the type and geometry of structure and the occupancy under consideration, this may require experimental consideration of localized, compartmentalized, horizontally and/or vertically travelling, smouldering, or <b>hydrocarbon</b> <b>fires,</b> {{all of which have}} the potential to introduce structural actions or interactions which are not captured by standard fires. In particular, the true dynamics of travelling or spreading fires in large compartments has received only limited attention within the research literature (e.g. Stern-Gottfried and Rein 2012), and essentially zero attention in large scale structural fire tests. There appears to be no facility in the world which is capable of producing (or reproducing) truly natural fire exposures on structures of realistic scale and construction, although the new NIST facility (Section 4.3) will go some way towards making this a reality.|$|R

40|$|Ordinary Portland Cement (OPC) {{concrete}} can {{be classified}} as a fire resistant construction material. However, spalling may occur in fire especially in high strength concretes. The need to address this spalling problem in fire has intensified since the use of high rise buildings. Geopolymer is a cementless concrete binder {{which is based on}} aluminosilicate reaction of fly ash, a power plant by-product and activated by alkaline solution. Recent research has shown that geopolymer concrete has great potential in resisting fire. In addition, without the presence of Portland cement in the concrete has led to more sustainable construction material since cement is the second highest CO 2 emitter after fossil fuels. In this research, the severity of large scale high strength concrete spalling under <b>hydrocarbon</b> <b>fire</b> was investigated. The results show that high strength OPC concrete severely spalled during the first 30 minutes of fire exposure in explosive manner. There is a thermal diffusivity drop when the temperature is between 110 oC and 155 oC due to water in concrete changing phase to steam. Maximum steam pressure corresponds to 155 oC temperature is 0. 44 MPa which shows that steam pressure alone is not a critical factor for concrete spalling. Further investigations on factors affecting concrete spalling show that larger specimen spalled more than smaller scale specimen based on 3 m x 3 m walls, 1 m x 1 m walls, columns and cylinders. Aggregates size effect was also observed with increasing spalling with decreasing aggregate size. No obvious trend observed for different aggregate types (granite and basalt). For making geopolymer, fly ashes from Gladstone, Tarong and Microash were examined for physical properties. Gladstone fly ash demonstrated the best workability compared with Tarong and Microash. The reasons for workability differences were investigated and the conclusion was agglomerated particle size distribution was the cause Effect of dry and wet condition on strength of geopolymer was investigated. Strength reduction of 17 % was observed. The high strength geopolymer 1 m x 1 m wall panels and two sizes of cylinders (150, 100 mm) were tested. From <b>hydrocarbon</b> <b>fire</b> test, high strength geopolymer concrete exhibited good fire resistance performance due to no explosive spalling observed. Two iii panels and all cylinders remained un-spalled. Less than 1 % spalling (excluding moisture loss) observed on 2 spalled panels.

To investigate aggregate and geopolymer binder thermal incompatibility factor on spalling, aerated geopolymer panels were tested. From <b>hydrocarbon</b> <b>fire</b> test, no spalling observed was further proof of thermal incompatibility was the cause of spalling.

40|$|Fire, {{as one of}} {{the most}} severe load conditions, has an {{important}} impact on concrete structures. It does not only affect the material strength, but also the structural stiffness and stability. A concrete column, compared to other structural members, has most often to cope both with vertical forces and bending moments transmitted by slabs and beams. Consequently, it is essential to find a reliable and practical way to establish interaction curves for the overall structural behaviour of concrete columns subjected to fire. In this paper, a cross-section calculation method based on the material models of Eurocode 2 is explained and adopted to calculate interaction curves for a typical rectangular column exposed to the ISO 834 standard fire. Subsequently, an iterative approach is introduced to develop interaction curves taking into account second order effects in case of four-side heated fire exposure. The maximum permitted slenderness ratios of columns under different fire durations are obtained and compared with Eurocode 2 provisions.

40|$|Current {{models for}} {{evaluating}} the exclusion (hazard) zones around LNG fires in both US Regulations and NFPA- 59 A standard are prescriptive and require the consideration of large LNG releases. These models do not consider {{the effects of the}} combustion dynamics associated with large size pool burning. Oxygen starvation in the core of LNG fires of diameters larger than about 35 m leads to the formation of non-luminous, cold soot (smoke) resulting in a reduction of thermal energy radiated by the fire to the surroundings. The net effect is a smaller (calculated) thermal hazard distances for people exposure (by factors of 2 or 3 compared to results ignoring this phenomenon). Available large scale LNG fire test information is reviewed to quantify the effect of this phenomenon. This paper also discusses the common mistakes made in calculating the thermal radiation hazard distances around large fires by using, for the energy radiated from the fire, a constant percent of energy generated by combustion. The criteria for setting thermal radiation hazard zones around large <b>hydrocarbon</b> <b>fires</b> are also reviewed...|$|R
40|$|Portland cement {{concrete}} is a world-wide used construction material. However, when Portland {{cement concrete}} {{is exposed to}} fire, its mechanical properties are deteriorated. The deterioration of concrete is generally caused by the decomposition of the Portland cement hydrate or the thermal incompatibility between cement paste and aggregate. Spalling, which is a violent or non-violent breaking off of layers or pieces of concrete {{from the surface of}} a structural element, may also occur when the concrete is exposed to rapidly rising temperatures. It is generally believed that spalling is influenced by the build-up of pore water pressure and thermal gradient in the concrete when exposed to elevated temperatures. Geopolymer is an alternative cementitious material which has ceramic-like properties. Geopolymer belongs to the family of inorganic polymers. The chemical composition of geopolymer is similar to natural zeolite, but the microstructure is amorphous. It is suggested that geopolymer processes a potential superior fire resistance due to its amorphous and ceramic-like properties. The objective of this thesis is to study the fire resistance of geopolymer material and to explore the spalling behaviour of geopolymer material when exposed to elevated temperatures. In this thesis, a method was presented to carry out spalling test in small scale specimen with exposure to rapid temperature rise using a commonly available electric furnace. <b>Hydrocarbon</b> <b>fire</b> and standard fire exposure can be simulated by manipulating the exposure location of the surface of the concrete cylinder. Ordinary Portland cement concrete cylinders with different strengths were tested. The results demonstrated that this method was an effective and convenient technique to predict the spalling risk of a concrete. The spalling behaviour of geopolymer concrete by using the surface exposure test and standard gas furnace fire test was studied. It was shown that 100 % fly ash based geopolymer concrete had a better spalling resistance to rapidly rising temperature exposure than that of Portland cement concrete. The study of sorptivity test of geopolymer concretes results showed that the geopolymer concrete specimen's structure is more porous and more continuous pore structure than Portland cement concrete specimen. The more porous structure of geopolymer than OPC concrete facilitates the release of the internal steam pressure during heating. Hence, less tensile stress is imposed in the geopolymer concrete than Portland cement concrete during heating, reducing the geopolymer's risk of spalling. When slag was used as a replacement to fly ash in the geopolymer binder, geopolymer paste and concrete specimens developed considerably high strength at room temperature. It was showed that the magnitude of shrinkage of fly ash and slag based geopolymer is significantly higher than that of 100 % fly ash based geopolymer and Portland cement concrete. The residual strength of fly ash based geopolymer concrete with slag replacement after exposure to elevated temperature was studied. It was found that the residual strength of 100 % fly ash based geopolymer concrete after elevated temperature exposure increased in the temperature range of 200 ~ 500 °C compared with OPC concretes. Fly ash based geopolymer concrete with slag replacement experienced a strength loss at the temperature range of 200 ~ 300 °C, then followed by a strength gain at 300 ~ 400 °C, and another strength loss after 500 °C. When slag was used as an additive to fly ash based geopolymer concrete, the overall strength loss of geopolymer concretes with slag replacement after exposure to elevated temperatures ranging from 200 ~ 800 °C was higher compared with 100 % fly ash based geopolymer concrete, however, it was significantly lower than that of the Portland cement concrete specimens. The investigation of fire resistance property of fly ash and slag based geopolymer material when exposed to <b>hydrocarbon</b> <b>fire</b> was followed. After <b>hydrocarbon</b> <b>fire,</b> no spalling was observed on geopolymer concretes when using varying factors as binder, slag replacement, cation type of alkaline liquid activator, room temperature and elevated temperature curing. Residual strength testing of geopolymer concretes after <b>hydrocarbon</b> <b>fire</b> exposure showed a similar residual strength percentage compared with the result of Portland cement concrete. However, it is noted that high strength Portland cement concrete spalled, while high strength geopolymer concrete still had a considerably high residual strength after fire exposure...|$|E

40|$|Fire {{exposure}} of tanks {{used for the}} storage and transportation of liquefied gases under pressure may cause complex heat- and mass-transfer phenomena that may contribute to compromise {{the integrity of the}} vessels in accident scenarios. Heat transfer through vessel lading results in the heat-up of the internal fluid and the increase of vessel internal pressure. However, local temperature gradients in the liquid phase cause liquid stratification phenomena that result in a more rapid vaporization and pressure build-up in the liquid phase. These fundamental phenomena were analyzed by a computational fluid dynamic model. The model was specifically focused on the early steps of vessel heat-up, when liquid stratification plays a relevant role in determining the vessel internal pressure.

40|$|A {{review of}} {{research}} into the burning behavior of large pool fires and fuel spill fires is presented. The features which distinguish such fires from smaller pool fires are mainly associated with the fire dynamics at low source Froude numbers and the radiative interaction with the <b>fire</b> source. In <b>hydrocarbon</b> <b>fires,</b> higher soot levels at increased diameters result in radiation blockage effects {{around the perimeter of}} large fire plumes; this yields lower emissive powers and a drastic reduction in the radiative loss fraction; whilst there are simplifying factors with these phenomena, arising from the fact that soot yield can saturate, there are other complications deriving from the intermittency of the behavior, with luminous regions of efficient combustion appearing randomly in the outer surface of the fire according the turbulent fluctuations in the fire plume. Knowledge of the fluid flow instabilities, which lead to the formation of large eddies, is also key to understanding the behavior of large-scale fires. Here modeling tools can be effectively exploited in order to investigate the fluid flow phenomena, including RANS- and LES-based computational fluid dynamics codes. The latter are well-suited to representation of the turbulent motions, but a number of challenges remain with their practical application.
