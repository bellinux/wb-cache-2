5|$|The Euthanasia Coaster {{would kill}} its {{passengers}} through prolonged cerebral hypoxia, or insufficient supply of oxygen to the brain. The ride's seven inversions would inflict 10 g on its passengers for 60 seconds – causing <b>g-force</b> related symptoms starting with gray out through tunnel vision {{to black out}} and eventually g-LOC (<b>g-force</b> induced loss of consciousness). Subsequent inversions would serve as insurance against unintentional survival of particularly robust passengers.|$|E
5|$|Hornish began {{driving in}} the IndyCar Series in 2000 for PDM Racing in the No. 18 <b>G-Force</b> GF05-Oldsmobile Aurora L47 V8. He debuted at the season-opening race at Walt Disney World Speedway, {{starting}} in 19th place and finishing in 20th (28 laps behind). In the season's third race, the Vegas Indy 300 at Las Vegas Motor Speedway, Hornish started 18th and had his first career podium finish (third place, one lap behind). He qualified for his first Indianapolis 500 in 14th place, after his team replaced the <b>G-Force</b> with a Dallara IR00. In mid-race, Hornish was involved in an accident which relegated him to 24th place. Starting 20th at Kentucky Speedway, he led for a series career-high 38 laps and finished ninth. Hornish ended his season with a 27th- (and last-) place finish at Texas Motor Speedway, finishing his rookie season with 110 points (21st in the point standings).|$|E
5|$|The SpongeBob SquarePants Rock Bottom Plunge {{features}} vertical lifts and 90-degree turns {{providing the}} riders a 60-plus foot drop, a maximum speed of over 40 {{miles per hour}} and a 4.4 maximum <b>G-force</b> rating. The ride time is approximately two minutes and is the shortest Gerstlauer roller coaster built yet.|$|E

50|$|Aircraft pilots (in particular) sustain <b>g-forces</b> {{along the}} axis {{aligned with the}} spine. This causes {{significant}} variation in blood pressure {{along the length of}} the subject's body, which limits the maximum <b>g-forces</b> that can be tolerated.|$|R
40|$|The bioelectric {{activity}} of the musculature of animals and man was studied during alternating <b>g-forces</b> and weightlessness. The appropriate conditions were reproduced in flight along a parabolic curve; in this case, weightlessness lasting 25 - 30 sec alternated with <b>g-forces</b> of about 2 g magnitude. Quite regular changes in the bioelectric {{activity of}} various groups of muscles were disclosed under <b>g-forces</b> and in weightlessness. Thus, muscle biopotential amplitudes of 130 - 180 microvolt in horizontal flight, increased to 190 - 330 microvolt under <b>g-forces.</b> In the subsequent weightlessness, an abrupt reduction in oscillation voltage was observed and, {{in a number of}} cases, phenomena, similar to the picture of bioelectric silence were noted...|$|R
5|$|During the {{following}} off-season, Kings Dominion widened the first high-speed turn {{to lower the}} amount of <b>G-force</b> experienced on the ride. The park's goal was {{to reduce the number}} of blackouts some riders were experiencing. The modification allowed them to remove the trim brakes on the ride's first drop, making it possible for the roller coaster's maximum speed to return to original specifications.|$|E
5|$|It {{was also}} doubted that fast fighter {{aircraft}} could engage in dogfights. The <b>g-force</b> {{effect on the}} human body also seemed to suggest the prospect of air-to-air combat between fighters was impractical anyway. The threat they saw related only to the return-fire of the bomber's gunners. Before the war the effectiveness of return, or cross-fire, from bombers had been exaggerated by the Air Staff and Air Ministry.|$|E
5|$|A {{key feature}} of the F-16's cockpit is the {{exceptional}} field of view. The single-piece, bird-proof polycarbonate bubble canopy provides 360° all-round visibility, with a 40° look-down angle {{over the side of}} the aircraft, and 15° down over the nose (compared to the common 12–13° of preceding aircraft); the pilot's seat is elevated for this purpose. Furthermore, the F-16's canopy lacks the forward bow frame found on many fighters, which is an obstruction to a pilot's forward vision. The F-16's ACES II zero/zero ejection seat is reclined at an unusual tilt-back angle of 30°; most fighters have a tilted seat at 13–15°. The tilted seat can accommodate taller pilots and increases <b>G-force</b> tolerance; however it has been associated with reports of neck ache, possibly caused by incorrect head-rest usage. Subsequent U.S. fighters have adopted more modest tilt-back angles of 20°. Due to the seat angle and the canopy's thickness, the ejection seat lacks canopy-breakers for emergency egress; instead the entire canopy is jettisoned prior to the seat's rocket firing.|$|E
50|$|Another common {{occurrence}} of greyouts is in roller coaster riders. Many roller coasters put riders through positive <b>g-forces,</b> particularly in vertical loops and helixes. Roller coasters rarely have high enough negative <b>g-forces</b> to induce redouts, as most low-g elements {{are designed to}} simulate weightlessness.|$|R

5|$|HSV E Series 3 or E3 {{commenced}} {{sales in}} 2011. Model {{changes for the}} E series 3 include an option for LPI system (for an extra $5990) allowing the vehicle to run on LPG and unleaded petrol; the LPI system is not available on the ClubSport R8 Tourer. Cosmetic changes include a new spoiler and revised exhaust tips. HSV E Series 3 models reach 0-100kmp in 5.8 seconds. The HSV E Series 3 introduced the new HSV Enhanced Driver Interface; {{it has the same}} interface as the Holden IQ (found in VE Series II Commodores) but with added function. The system allows users to access the car's computer and monitor fuel consumption, stability, <b>g-force</b> and vehicle dynamics. Other functions include data logging options, digital gauge displays, stopwatch, driver and racing options, along with controls for the Grange's Bi-Modal exhaust and Side Blind-Zone Alert. The HSV Enhanced Driver Interface and satellite navigation is standard across the E series 3 range.|$|E
25|$|Rocket packs can {{be useful}} for spacewalks. While near Earth a jet pack has to produce a <b>g-force</b> of at least 1g (a smaller <b>g-force,</b> {{providing}} only some deviation from free fall is of little use here), for excursions outside a free falling spaceship, a small <b>g-force</b> providing a small deviation from free fall is quite useful. Hence much less delta-v is consumed per unit time, and not during the whole EVA. With only small amounts of thrust needed, safety and temperature are much more manageable than in the atmosphere in Earth's gravity field.|$|E
25|$|For a takeoff {{from the}} surface of the earth using thrust and no {{aerodynamic}} lift, the thrust-to-weight ratio for the whole vehicle must be more than one. In general, the thrust-to-weight ratio is numerically equal to the <b>g-force</b> that the vehicle can generate. Take-off can occur when the vehicle's <b>g-force</b> exceeds local gravity (expressed as a multiple of g0).|$|E

5000|$|As <b>g-forces</b> increase, {{visual effects}} include loss of colour vision ("grey-out"), {{followed}} by tunnel vision (where peripheral vision is lost, retaining only the centre vision). If <b>g-forces</b> increase further, complete {{loss of vision}} will occur, while consciousness remains. These effects are due to a reduction of {{blood flow to the}} eyes before blood flow to the brain is lost, because the extra pressure within the eye (intraocular pressure) counters the blood pressure. The reverse effect is experienced in advanced aerobatic maneuvers under negative <b>g-forces,</b> where excess blood moves towards the brain and eyes [...] "red out".|$|R
