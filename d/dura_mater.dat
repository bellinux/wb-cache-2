5|$|TBI {{is usually}} {{classified}} based on severity, anatomical {{features of the}} injury, and the mechanism (the causative forces). Mechanism-related classification divides TBI into closed and penetrating head injury. A closed (also called nonpenetrating, or blunt) injury occurs when the brain is not exposed. A penetrating, or open, head injury occurs when an object pierces the skull and breaches the <b>dura</b> <b>mater,</b> the outermost membrane surrounding the brain.|$|E

40|$|Loss of {{function}} of the mouse forkhead/winged helix transcription factor Foxc 1 induces congenital hydrocephalus and impaired skull bone development due to failure of apical expansion of the bone. In this study we investigated meningeal development in the congenital hydrocephalus (ch) mouse with spontaneous loss {{of function}} mutant of Foxc 1, around the period of initiation of skull bone apical expansion. In situ hybridization of Runx 2 revealed active apical expansion of the frontal bone begins between embryonic day 13. 5 and embryonic day 14. 5 in the wild type, whereas expansion was inhibited in the mutant. Ultrastructural analysis revealed that three layers of the meninges begin to develop at E 13. 5 in the basolateral site {{of the head and}} subsequently progress to the apex in wild type. In ch homozygotes, although three layers were recognized at first at the basolateral site, cell morphology and structure of the layers became abnormal except for the pia mater, and arachnoidal and dural cells never differentiated in the apex. We identified meningeal markers for each layer and found that their expression was down-regulated in the mutant arachnoid and <b>dura</b> <b>maters.</b> These results suggest that there is a close association between meningeal development and the apical growth of the skull bones...|$|R
40|$|In the {{modeling}} of brain mechanics subjected to primary blast waves, {{there is currently}} no consensus on how many biological components {{to be used in}} the brain–meninges–skull complex, and what type of constitutive models to be adopted. The objective of this study is to determine the role of layered meninges in damping the dynamic response of the brain under primary blast loadings. A composite structures composed of eight solid relevant layers (including the pia, cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), <b>dura</b> <b>maters)</b> with different mechanical properties are constructed to mimic the heterogeneous human head. A hyper-viscoelastic material model is developed to better represent the mechanical response of the brain tissue over a large strain/high frequency range applicable for blast scenarios. The effect of meninges on the brain response is examined. Results show that heterogeneous composite structures of the head have a major influence on the intracranial pressure, maximum shear stress, and maximum principal strain in the brain, which is associated with traumatic brain injuries. The meninges serving as protective layers are revealed by mitigating the dynamic response of the brain. In addition, appreciable changes of the pressure and maximum shear stress are observed on the material interfaces between layers of tissues. This may be attributed to the alternation of shock wave speed caused by the impedance mismatch...|$|R
5|$|The {{hypoglossal}} nerve arises {{as a number}} of small rootlets {{from the front of the}} medulla, the bottom part of the brainstem, in the preolivary sulcus, which separates the olive and the pyramid. The nerve passes through the subarachnoid space and pierces the <b>dura</b> <b>mater</b> near the hypoglossal canal, an opening in the occipital bone of the skull.|$|E
5|$|Cerebrospinal fluid is {{produced}} by the choroid plexus in the ventricles {{of the brain and}} contained by the dura and arachnoid layers of the meninges. The brain floats in CSF, which also transports nutrients to the brain and spinal cord. As holes form in the spinal <b>dura</b> <b>mater,</b> CSF leaks out into the surrounding space. The CSF is then absorbed into the spinal epidural venous plexus or soft tissues around the spine. Due to the sterile conditions of the soft tissues around the spine there is no risk of meningitis.|$|E
5|$|Hematomas, also focal lesions, are {{collections}} {{of blood in}} or around the brain that can result from hemorrhage. Intracerebral hemorrhage, with bleeding in the brain tissue itself, is an intra-axial lesion. Extra-axial lesions include epidural hematoma, subdural hematoma, subarachnoid hemorrhage, and intraventricular hemorrhage. Epidural hematoma involves bleeding into the area between the skull and the <b>dura</b> <b>mater,</b> the outermost of the three membranes surrounding the brain. In subdural hematoma, bleeding occurs between the dura and the arachnoid mater. Subarachnoid hemorrhage involves bleeding into {{the space between the}} arachnoid membrane and the pia mater. Intraventricular hemorrhage occurs when there is bleeding in the ventricles.|$|E
30|$|Chronic {{subdural}} hematoma (CSDH) is an encapsulated {{collection of}} old blood or blood breakdown products, partially or completely liquefied and located between the <b>dura</b> and arachnoid <b>mater</b> present {{at least for}} 3 [*]weeks [1].

30|$|Anterior pseudomeningocele after {{trauma is}} a rare entity [6]. Pseudomeningocele is an {{extradural}} collection of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) that results from a dural breach [7]. The causes may be classified into three categories: iatrogenic (the most common), traumatic, and congenital. The incidence of iatrogenic pseudomeningocele ranges from 0.3 to 13 %. Trauma-related pseudomeningoceles are rare and the true incidence is unknown [8]. Traumatic pseudomeningoceles are usually associated with a nerve root stretch injury with possible avulsion of the nerve root itself [9, 10]. The dural tear is walled off by proliferation of <b>dura</b> and arachnoid <b>mater,</b> and the cyst enlarges because of a pressure differential [9].|$|R
5|$|Black {{wildebeest}} act as hosts to {{a number}} of external and internal parasites. A study of the animal in Karroid Mountainveld (Eastern Cape Province, South Africa) revealed the presence of all the larval stages of the nasal bot flies Oestrus variolosus and Gedoelstia hässleri. The first instar larvae of G hässleri were found in large numbers on the <b>dura</b> <b>mater</b> of wildebeest calves, specially between June and August, and these later migrated to the nasal passages. Repeated outbreaks of mange (scab) have led to large-scale extinctions. The first study of the protozoa in blue and black wildebeest showed the presence of 23 protozoan species in the rumen, with Diplodinium bubalidis and Ostracodinium damaliscus common in all the animals.|$|E
5|$|Cerebral veins drain deoxygenated {{blood from}} the brain. The brain has two main {{networks}} of veins: an exterior or superficial network, {{on the surface of}} the cerebrum that has three branches, and an interior network. These two networks communicate via anastomosing (joining) veins. The veins of the brain drain into larger cavities the dural venous sinuses usually situated between the <b>dura</b> <b>mater</b> and the covering of the skull. Blood from the cerebellum and midbrain drains into the great cerebral vein. Blood from the medulla and pons of the brainstem have a variable pattern of drainage, either into the spinal veins or into adjacent cerebral veins.|$|E
5|$|Magnetic {{resonance}} imaging is less effective than CT at directly imaging sites of CSF leak. MRI studies may show pachymeningeal enhancement (when the <b>dura</b> <b>mater</b> looks thick and inflamed), sagging of the brain, pituitary enlargement, subdural hygromas, engorgement of cerebral venous sinuses, and other abnormalities. For 20% of patients, MRIs present as completely normal. There is disagreement over whether MRI {{should be the}} study of choice. MRIs performed with the patient seated upright (vs. laying supine) are not better for diagnosing CSF leaks, but are {{more than twice as}} effective at diagnosing cerebellar tonsillar ectopia, also known as Chiari malformation. Cerebellar tonsillar ectopia shares many of the same symptoms as CSF leak, but originates either congenitally or from trauma, including whiplash strain to the dura.|$|E
40|$|A {{brush of}} 64 microwires was chronically {{implanted}} in the ventral premotor cortex of a macaque monkey. Contrary to common approaches, the wires were inserted from the white matter side. This approach, by avoiding mechanical pressure on the <b>dura</b> and pia <b>mater</b> during penetration, disturbed only minimally the cortical recording site. With this approach isolated potentials and multiunit activity were recorded for more than 7 [*]years in about one-third of electrodes. The indirect insertion method also provided an excellent stability within each recording session, {{and in some cases}} even allowed recording from the same neurons for several years. Histological examination of the implanted brain region shows only a very marginal damage to the recording area. Advantages and problems related to long-term recording are discussed...|$|R
40|$|History {{of present}} illness: A 21 -year-old female with no past medical history {{presented}} to the ED after multiple tonic-clonic seizures over the previous 12 hours, the longest lasting 20 seconds. She returned to baseline after each seizure, had no obvious signs of trauma, and did not exhibit any focal neurologic deficits. She denied illicit drugs or new medications.

25|$|A form {{of surgery}} is the {{so-called}} fronto-supraorbital advancement and remodelling. Firstly, the supraorbital bar is remodelled by a wired greenstick fracture to straighten it. Secondly, the supraorbital bar is moved 2cm. forward and fixed only to the frontal process of the zygoma without fixation to the cranium. Lastly, the frontal bone is divided into two, rotated and attached to the supraorbital bar causing a nude area (craniectomy) between the parietal bone and frontal bone. Bone will eventually regenerate since the <b>dura</b> <b>mater</b> lies underneath (the <b>dura</b> <b>mater</b> has osteogenic capabilities).

40|$|Background: Intracranial {{subdural}} empyema (ISDE) is a pyogenic infection {{located in the}} space between the <b>dura</b> and arachnoid <b>mater.</b> Early diagnosis, prompt initiation of antimicrobial therapy, and surgical drainage are essential to reduce morbidity and mortality. This case series analyzes the presentation and management of ISDE in Queensland, Australia, over a 10 -year period. Methods: Thirty-six patients with ISDE were treated at Gold Coast University Hospital, Princess Alexandra Hospital, Townsville Hospital, and Royal Brisbane Hospital. The patients' medical records were analyzed to ascertain patient demographics, etiology, presentation, and management. Results: A slight male preponderance occurred in the cohort of 36 patients with ISDE. The most common source of infection was a neurosurgical procedure, followed by sinusitis and otogenic sources. Headache, fever, and altered sensorium were the most common clinical triad of symptoms, present in 19 (53 %) patients. Craniotomy was performed as the initial surgical procedure in 28 (88 %) of the 32 patients who required surgery. Seizure prophylaxis was given to 25 (69 %) patients, with 8 (32 %) of those patients having seizures during their hospitalizations despite this therapy. Five (14 %) patients required readmission and a second craniotomy because of failed resolution of the ISDE. Conclusion: Altered sensorium, fever, vomiting, and headache should alert the clinician to the possibility of ISDE. A history of neurosurgery, sinusitis, otitis media, or skull trauma increases the likelihood of this differential. Management includes sensitive antibiotic therapy and surgical drainage. Compared with burr hole, craniotomy is associated with less recurrence of ISDE. Full Tex...|$|R
40|$|Authors: Noel Derecki & Jonathan Kipnis ### Abstract Presented is {{a method}} for removal of {{meninges}} from the brain and interior skull of the mouse yielding tissue suitable for preparing a single-cell suspension amenable to downstream applications such as flow cytometric analysis or short-term cell culture. ### Materials 1. Nembutal (or similar, as approved by your governing body) - Perfusion apparatus suitable for transcardial mouse perfusion - Perfusion Buffer (0. 1 M PBS/ 5 u/ml sodium heparin) - FACS Buffer (0. 1 M PBS (pH 7. 4) / 2 mM EDTA/ 1 % BSA) ### Equipment 1. Ice bucket - Ice - Dumont # 5 Forceps - Dumont # 7 Forceps - Angled Dissector Scissors - 10 mm Petri dish - Dissecting microscope - 50 ml Falcon tubes - 70 um nylon cell strainer - Centrifuge ### Procedure 1. Mouse preparation - a. Anesthetize mouse with lethal dose of appropriate pharmacological agent (e. g. Nembutal) to render amenable to surgical manipulation. - b. Perfuse transcardially with ice-cold Perfusion Buffer until mouse is exsanguinated. - Skull preparation and brain removal - a. Using large scissors, sever mouse head just above shoulders. - b. Using angled dissection scissors, beginning at caudal aspect, carefully detatch skin and flesh from skull, working rostrally until all skin is removed. - c. Sever eyes at the optic nerve and remove. - d. Turn head over so that ventral aspect of the jaw is facing up. Slide angled dissection scissors through the oral cavity until you feel {{the resistance of the}} mandibular junction. Sever the large muscles connecting the lower jaw to the skull; remove. - e. Using angled dissection scissors, remove the lower orbits {{on each side of the}} skull (the squamosae, zygomatic and maxillae). - f. Working quickly, use scissors to all clean flesh from all aspects of skull. - g. With large scissors, remove the nasal bone with a coronal cut along the suture that defines its most caudal point, thus preserving the olfactory lobes. - h. With the tips of the angled dissection scissors, carefully cut shallowly around the skull, being careful to leave the brain within undamaged. Begin and end superior to the external acoustic meatus (the “earholes”). - i. Remove the lower portion of the skull; discard. Scoop the brain out of the upper half of the skull, and place both brain and skull-cap in a 50 mL falcon tube with 10 mL ice-cold FACS buffer (or suitable cell culture medium, e. g. DMEM- 10, RPMI 1640). - Removal of meninges - a. Place brain and skull-cap, with medium, in petri dish under a dissecting microscope. With a scalpel, separate brainstem/cerebellum from cerebrum. - b. Hemisect the cerebrum with scalpel along the longitudinal fissure. Working from medial to lateral, peel meninges (pia and arachnoid mater) from the surface of the brain. - Pay special attention to the ventral aspect of the brain, as it is a rich source of meningeal tissue. Choroid plexus epithelium and associated leukocytes also lie within the lateral and third ventricles, and can be removed easily if so desired. When the cerebral hemispheres are fully stripped of meninges and choroid plexus, remove from the petri dish, leaving dissected material in the medium. - c. Separate the cerebellum from the brainstem; the space between houses the fourth ventricle, another source of meningeal tissue. The ventral aspect of the brainstem can generally be peeled off in a single section. The dorsal cerebellar meninges must be removed piecewise, as with the cerebral meninges. When the cerebellum and brainstem are fully stripped of meninges and choroid plexus, remove from the petri dish, leaving dissected material in the medium. - d. Beginning at the rostral-most interior point of the skull-cap, carefully score meninges with the tip of a Dumont # 5 forceps, moving along the edge of the interior of the skull-cap until meninges (<b>dura</b> and arachnoid <b>mater)</b> are scored 360 º. If meninges have been completely scored, they can then be peeled whole from the inside of the skull. Remove skull from media and discard - Single cell suspension - a. Place a nylon cell screen (70 μm) atop a 50 mL Falcon tube in ice. Pipette dissected tissue and media directly onto screen. With the wide tip a plastic plunger (from a 1 ml syringe), gently but firmly press meningeal tissue with a circular motion (~ 40 x) through the screen. Connective tissue will not pass through the screen well and will remain; lymphocytes, any glial cells or neurons, and debris will pass through. Do not mash too quickly or heat will be generated by friction of the plunger against the screen. With a clean pipette, pass 20 mL additional media through the screen while continuing to mash with plunger; this will dislodge any cells caught in the screen. - b. Centrifuge at 300 RCF for 10 m at 4 ºC. Decant supernatant and resuspend in desired medium for downstream applications. Triturate gently to break up pellet. Yield should be ~ 5 X 105 viable nucleated cells including T lymphocytes, myeloid cells, and granulocytes per meninges, with ~ 10 % purity for leukocytes (CD 45 -high cells). Non-leukocytes can be easily gated out in FACS by scatter properties and/or negativity for CD 45 -high labeling and a viability dye; further purity for cell culture can be achieved by benchtop (e. g. magnetic columns) or flow cytometric sorting or by ficoll paque gradient. However, we routinely label crude preparations with excellent success–CD 45 and live/dead labeling is sufficient to gate out unwanted debris and ensures that as few cells are lost between dissection and analysis as possible. ### Timing - Perfusion: 3 - 5 minutes - Skull-cap and brain removal: 5 minutes - Meninges removal: 10 - 15 minutes ### Troubleshooting Be careful to thoroughly exsanguinate mouse prior to dissection. If this is not done, peripheral immune cells will contaminate the preparation. ### References This protocol has been used in the following primary research papers: 1.

25|$|In {{this part}} of its course, the artery is {{situated}} between the layers of the <b>dura</b> <b>mater</b> forming the cavernous sinus, but covered by the lining membrane of the sinus. It at first ascends toward the posterior clinoid process, then passes forward {{by the side of}} the body of the sphenoid bone, and again curves upward on the medial side of the anterior clinoid process, and perforates the <b>dura</b> <b>mater</b> forming the roof of the sinus. The curve in the cavernous segment is called the carotid siphon.

25|$|In contrast, {{epidural}} hematomas {{are usually}} caused by tears in arteries, {{resulting in a}} build-up of blood between the <b>dura</b> <b>mater</b> and skull.

25|$|The fourth (intradural or intracranial) part pierces the <b>dura</b> <b>mater</b> and {{inclines}} medialward to {{the front}} of the medulla oblongata; it is placed between the hypoglossal nerve and the anterior root of the first cervical nerve and beneath the first digitation of the ligamentum denticulatum. At the lower border of the pons it unites with the vessel of the opposite side to form the basilar artery.|$|E
25|$|Risks {{for late}} PTS include hydrocephalus, reduced {{blood flow to}} the {{temporal}} lobes of the brain, brain contusions, subdural hematomas, a torn <b>dura</b> <b>mater,</b> and focal neurological deficits.

25|$|In some patients, {{subsequent}} leakage of CSF {{through the}} <b>dura</b> <b>mater</b> puncture causes reduced CSF {{levels in the}} brain and spinal cord, leading to the development of post-dural-puncture headache (PDPH) hours or days later.

It occurs so rarely immediately after puncture that other possible causes should be investigated when it does.|$|E
25|$|The base of skull {{was found}} intact. The {{back of the}} skull cavity {{contains}} the shrunken and desiccated brain and <b>dura</b> <b>mater</b> of the Lady.

It is located in {{the central part of the}} frontal bone, in front of the coronal suture. The defect has sharp, beveled, and festooned edges. The lack of evidence for attempted healing or sclerosis indicate that the defect was caused by a postmortem alteration of the body, probably during the embalming process. The embalmers likely used a sharp instrument on the skull.|$|E
25|$|Electrocorticography (ECoG) {{measures}} the electrical {{activity of the}} brain taken from beneath the skull {{in a similar way}} to non-invasive electroencephalography (see below), but the electrodes are embedded in a thin plastic pad that is placed above the cortex, beneath the <b>dura</b> <b>mater.</b> ECoG technologies were first trialled in humans in 2004 by Eric Leuthardt and Daniel Moran from Washington University in St Louis. In a later trial, the researchers enabled a teenage boy to play Space Invaders using his ECoG implant. This research indicates that control is rapid, requires minimal training, and may be an ideal tradeoff with regards to signal fidelity and level of invasiveness.|$|E
25|$|Surgical {{treatments}} {{date back}} to the prehistoric era. The oldest for which there is evidence is trepanation, in which a hole is drilled or scraped into the skull, thus exposing the <b>dura</b> <b>mater</b> in order to treat health problems related to intracranial pressure and other diseases. Prehistoric surgical techniques are seen in Ancient Egypt, where a mandible dated to approximately 2650 BC shows two perforations just below the root of the first molar, indicating the draining of an abscessed tooth. Surgical texts from ancient Egypt date back about 3500 years ago. Surgical operations were performed by priests, specialized in medical treatments similar to today, and used sutures to close wounds. Infections were treated with honey.|$|E
25|$|When the {{internal}} carotid artery enters the canal in the petrous portion of the temporal bone, it first ascends a short distance, then curves anteriorly and medially. The artery lies at first {{in front of the}} cochlea and tympanic cavity; from the latter cavity it is separated by a thin, bony lamella, which is cribriform in the young subject, and often partly absorbed in old age. Farther forward it is separated from the trigeminal ganglion by a thin plate of bone, which forms the floor of the fossa for the ganglion and the roof of the horizontal portion of the canal. Frequently this bony plate is more or less deficient, and then the ganglion is separated from the artery by fibrous membrane. The artery is separated from the bony wall of the carotid canal by a prolongation of <b>dura</b> <b>mater,</b> and is surrounded by a number of small veins and by filaments of the carotid plexus, derived from the ascending branch of the superior cervical ganglion of the sympathetic trunk.|$|E
25|$|If {{a patient}} with {{epilepsy}} is being considered for resective surgery, it is often necessary to localize the focus (source) of the epileptic brain activity with a resolution greater than what is provided by scalp EEG. This is because the cerebrospinal fluid, skull and scalp smear the electrical potentials recorded by scalp EEG. In these cases, neurosurgeons typically implant strips and grids of electrodes (or penetrating depth electrodes) under the <b>dura</b> <b>mater,</b> through either a craniotomy or a burr hole. The recording of these signals {{is referred to as}} electrocorticography (ECoG), subdural EEG (sdEEG) or intracranial EEG (icEEG)--all terms for the same thing. The signal recorded from ECoG is on a different scale of activity than the brain activity recorded from scalp EEG. Low voltage, high frequency components that cannot be seen easily (or at all) in scalp EEG can be seen clearly in ECoG. Further, smaller electrodes (which cover a smaller parcel of brain surface) allow even lower voltage, faster components of brain activity to be seen. Some clinical sites record from penetrating microelectrodes.|$|E
