40|$|BACKGROUND—Hallucinosis is a {{complication}} {{of the treatment}} of <b>idiopathic</b> Parkinson's <b>disease</b> commonly thought to afflict older, chronically medicated, cognitively impaired patients. However, patients with <b>idiopathic</b> Parkinson's <b>disease</b> of short duration experiencing hallucinosis on relatively low doses of dopaminergic medication have been found. The aim, therefore, {{was to investigate the}} homogeneity of a population of patients with <b>idiopathic</b> Parkinson's <b>disease</b> and hallucinosis.  METHODS—The clinical, demographic, and cognitive correlates of hallucinosis were investigated in a sample of 129 patients with <b>idiopathic</b> Parkinson's <b>disease.</b>  RESULTS—There were two subgroups of patients with <b>idiopathic</b> Parkinson's <b>disease</b> experiencing hallucinosis. In patients with a disease duration of five years or less, hallucinosis was associated with rapid progression of the motor component of the disease but not cognitive impairment. In patients with <b>idiopathic</b> Parkinson's <b>disease</b> of longer than five years duration, hallucinosis was associated with postural instability, global cognitive impairment, and lack of depressive affect. In all patients with <b>idiopathic</b> Parkinson's <b>disease,</b> hallucinosis was more prevalent when they were treated with a direct acting dopamine receptor agonist. Hallucinosis was not associated with age at onset of <b>idiopathic</b> Parkinson's <b>disease</b> or dosage of dopaminergic medication.  CONCLUSION—Hallucinosis in <b>idiopathic</b> Parkinson's <b>disease</b> is heterogeneous, falling into two groups. The difference in the pathophysiological basis of hallucinosis in these two groups of patients is discussed. ...|$|R

In this study, we use [13 C 2]oxalate absorption under standardized dietary conditions to assess intestinal oxalate absorption and its impact on urinary oxalate excretion. Tests were conducted in age-matched pediatric patients that included 60 with idiopathic calcium oxalate urolithiasis, 13 with primary hyperoxaluria, and 35 healthy children. In the idiopathic stone formers, median oxalate absorption was significantly higher than that in the controls or in patients with primary disease. From standardized values obtained in control patients, oxalate hyperabsorption was detected in 23 patients with <b>idiopathic</b> <b>disease</b> but not in any patients with primary hyperoxaluria; therefore, a significant correlation between intestinal absorption and urinary excretion was found only in those with the <b>idiopathic</b> <b>disease.</b> We have shown that increased intestinal oxalate absorption {{is an important}} risk factor of idiopathic calcium oxalate urolithiasis.

To our knowledge, there is no published data concerning the neuropsychological evaluation of patients diagnosed with <b>idiopathic</b> Parkinson's <b>disease</b> related with C 9 ORF 72 repeat expansions. CASE PRESENTATION: We report the results of the comprehensive neuropsychological evaluation in a newly described case in the literature (the sixth) of a patient presenting isolated <b>idiopathic</b> Parkinson's <b>disease</b> associated with C 9 ORF 72 repeat expansions. The decrease in the patient's prefrontal functions resulted in a slight decrease in global efficiency. These abnormalities did not appear to be different, with respect to the deficit observed and the intensity of the cognitive impairment, from those classically observed in cases of sporadic <b>idiopathic</b> Parkinson's <b>disease.</b> Our patient also exhibited a significant impairment in visual gnosis. CONCLUSIONS: If confirmed in other patients, visuoperceptive deficits in <b>idiopathic</b> Parkinson's <b>disease</b> could represent a red flag that should prompt the clinician to perform addition diagnostic procedures.
