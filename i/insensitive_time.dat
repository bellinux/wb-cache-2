40|$|The {{efficient}} {{handling of}} both the persisting and newly emerging pollutants is a must, since they are continuously defiling the limited fresh water resources, seriously affecting the terrestrial, aquatic, and aerial flora and fauna. The 3, 4 -Dihydroxybenzoic Acid (3, 4 -DHBA) is a major phenol-type toxic water pollutant having detrimental effects on animal and human health. It causes oxidative stress, neurotoxicity, hepatotoxicity and skin cancer when ingested at high levels by animals (≥ 1. 0 μmole) and humans (≥ 5. 0 mM). Currently, 3, 4 -DHBA is handled by a few methods such as adsorption, chemical oxidation and microbial decontaminations which are non-specific, <b>insensitive,</b> <b>time</b> consuming, costly and generating chemical masses to the environment. Recently, immobilized enzymes onto nanomaterial supports have been evolved {{a new generation of}} Nanobiohybrid catalysts which have versatile applications in waste water purifications. Protocatechuate 3, 4 -dioxygenase (3, 4 -POD) has long been used for the degradation of 3, 4 -DHBA. However, immobilizing 3, 4 -POD onto nanomaterial for enhancing its stabilities, reusability and reduced cost has remained unexplored. Here we filled up this gap by developing a novel Nanobiohybrid catalyst through covalent immobilization of 3, 4 -POD onto multi-walled carbon nanotube (MWCNT) surfaces. MWCNTs were selected since they are low-cost materials with large surface area, high aspect ratio, greater chemical reactivity, and less chemical mass and adverse environmental impact. Unfortunately, pristine MWCNTs are hydrophobic and often contaminated with various impurities such as amorphous carbons, metals and ashes which hinder its conjugation with biomolecules. Here we attempted to develop simple methods for MWCNT purification and functionalization with bio-conjugating functionalities with added water dispersion properties. We observed that HCl/H 2 O 2 treatment annihilated more amorphous carbons and metals from the MWCNTs compared with HCl alone and KOH/H 2 O 2 methods. On the other hand, H 2 SO 4 /HNO 3 functionalized MWCNTs (F-MWCNTs) were more soluble in water because of their higher number of -COOH functionalities than those of HNO 3 /H 2 O 2 and KMnO 4 functionalizations. Thus HCl/H 2 O 2 purified and H 2 SO 4 /HNO 3 F-MWCNT was used as support matrix for 3, 4 -POD immobilization. Convincing results from scanning electron microscopy, transmission electron microscopy, atomic force microscopy, attenuated total reflectance infrared and ultraviolet-visible spectroscopy studies confirmed that the 3, 4 -POD was successfully immobilized onto F-MWCNT surfaces, and maximum loading was found 1060 μg of 3, 4 -POD/mg of F-MWCNTs. Circular dichroism spectra showed that the Nanobiohybrid could experience with 44...|$|E

In this research the authors use the xSonify Java-based tool, developed to explore space data using sound, to analyze radio data at 20. 1 MHz for the formation of irregularities in the ionosphere. The data was audified in real time, and the power spectra sonified to expose discrete resonances, combs and bands.

An existing approach based on the wave transformation technique can make a two-channel teleoperation system <b>insensitive</b> to <b>time</b> delays by making the time-delayed communication channel passive. In this paper, we propose a novel method for incorporating this technique in a four-channel architecture, which is the optimal architecture from a transparency point of view, and derive the corresponding absolute stability condition. It is analytically demonstrated that the proposed teleoperation architecture is capable of providing ideal transparency when transmission delays are present, and criteria for its stable operation are derived. We also show that a three-channel variant of the proposed four-channel control architecture can offer a comparable performance with less implementational complexity.

40|$|Transport {{time scales}} such as {{flushing}} time and residence time {{are often used}} to explain variability in phytoplankton biomass. In many cases, empirical data are consistent with a positive phytoplankton–transport time relationship (i. e., phytoplankton biomass increases as transport time increases). However, negative relationships, varying relationships, or no significant relationship may also be observed. We present a simple conceptual model, in both mathematical and graphical form, to help explain why phytoplankton may {{have a range of}} relationships with transport time, and we apply it to several real systems. The phytoplankton growth–loss balance determines whether phytoplankton biomass increases with, decreases with, or is <b>insensitive</b> to transport <b>time.</b> If algal growth is faster than loss (e. g., grazing, sedimentation), then phytoplankton biomass increases with increasing transport time. If loss is faster than growth, phytoplankton biomass decreases with increasing transport time. If growth and loss are approximately balanced, then phytoplankton biomass is relatively <b>insensitive</b> to transport <b>time.</b> In analyses of several systems, portions of an individual system, or time periods, apparent insensitivity of phytoplankton biomass to changes in transport time could arise due to the superposition of cases with different phytoplankton–transport time relationships. Thus, in order to understand or predict responses of phytoplankton biomass to changes in transport time, the relative rates of algal growth and loss must be known...|$|R

40|$|A {{previously}} derived {{analytical model}} for the small-scale structure of turbulence is reformulated {{in such a way}} that the energy spectrum may be computed. The model is an ensemble of two-dimensional (2 D) vortices with internal spiral structure, each stretched by an axially symmetric strain flow. Stretching and differential rotation produce an energy cascade to smaller scales in which the stretching represents the effect of instabilities and the spiral structure is the source of dissipation at the end of the cascade. The energy spectrum of the resulting flow may be expressed as a time integration involving only the enstrophy spectrum of the time evolving 2 D cross section flow, which may be obtained numerically. Examples are given in which a k exp - 5 / 3 spectrum is obtained by this method. The k exp - 5 / 3 inertial range spectrum is shown to be related to the existence of a self-similar enstrophy preserving range in the 2 D enstrophy spectrum.

The study employed maximum entropy bootstrap (Meboot) approach to examine the causal nexus between energy consumption and carbon dioxide emission using bivariate as well as multivariate framework for Malaysia, {{over a period of}} 1975 - 2013.

Thus, it provides more reliable and robust inferences which are <b>insensitive</b> to <b>time</b> span as well as lag length used.
