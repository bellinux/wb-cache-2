5|$|The {{government}} rested {{its case}} on February 26. Judge Stone denied the defense's motion for a <b>directed</b> <b>verdict.</b>|$|E
25|$|He {{repeated}} {{this defense}} at trial, while prosecutors introduced Louisville Courier-Journal articles showing {{that he knew}} very well which party investigators were concerned about. In September he was convicted, and sentenced to 15 months in prison. After his motion for a <b>directed</b> <b>verdict</b> failed, he filed an appeal.|$|E
25|$|The {{brothers}} {{were charged with}} eight counts of mail fraud, since TDOT mailed copies of the CCO applications to the agency's headquarters in Austin. One pleaded guilty and the other opted for trial. After the jury convicted him, he successfully moved for a <b>directed</b> <b>verdict</b> of not guilty. The government appealed.|$|E
50|$|Black {{argued that}} <b>directed</b> <b>verdicts</b> {{should only be}} used, if at all, when without {{weighing}} {{the credibility of the}} witnesses, there is no room in the evidence for honest difference of opinion over the factual issue in controversy.|$|R
50|$|Initially, in {{the lower}} court the case was non-suited through a <b>direct</b> <b>verdict</b> because the {{plaintiff}} could provide no evidence.Subsequently the appellate court concluded that under the conditions, {{the fact of the}} accident itself provided sufficient circumstantial evidence to establish the breach of a duty of care. Baron Pollock said the following.|$|R

25|$|The {{case was}} remanded to {{district}} court, where Judge Alexander Bicks {{presided over a}} trial. Bicks broke the case down into seven questions for the jury to answer. They were able to answer three but not the other four. In 1955, Bicks ruled on the issue himself in denying the defense motion for dismissal of several charges or a <b>directed</b> <b>verdict</b> and ordering a new trial.|$|E
25|$|The Marshall Court heard thirty-one {{criminal}} cases under the certificate of division procedure authorized by § 6 of the Judiciary Act of 1802. However, the Court had {{held that the}} sufficiency of the evidence could not be certified—whether on a motion {{for a new trial}} or a motion for a <b>directed</b> <b>verdict.</b> In United States v. Briggs (Briggs I) (1847), the Court further limited its jurisdiction to hear criminal certificates of division by holding that the question of whether a demurrer to an indictment should be sustained was to general to be certified.|$|E
25|$|Milkovich filed suit, {{alleging that}} the {{suggestion}} that he had lied had defamed him. Since perjury is a felony in Ohio, the statements {{were found to be}} defamatory and Milkovich was ruled a private figure, both of which were helpful to his case. However, the trial court granted a <b>directed</b> <b>verdict</b> in favor of the newspaper since it found Diadiun's column to be a statement of opinion, which cannot be libelous, {{and that there was no}} actual malice, per Sullivan. Milkovich appealed to the Ohio Eleventh District Court of Appeals, which found that there was actual malice. In turn, the newspaper appealed to the state Supreme Court, which dismissed it on the grounds that there were no significant constitutional issues. In 1979 the U.S. Supreme Court denied certiorari.|$|E
25|$|The second phase, against 107 {{defendants}} {{consisting of}} suppliers and other product liability parties, {{went to trial}} about 45 days later. After nine months of trial, the Court <b>directed</b> <b>verdicts</b> of no liability in favor of three defendants: Johnson Controls, Inc., represented by Chicago’s Arnstein & Lehr, LLP; Barber Colman, Inc., represented by Boston’s Cooley, Manion, Moore & Jones; and Quantum Chemical, represented by Louisville, Kentucky’s Brown, Todd & Heyburn. A number of the other defendants had settled and trial resumed against 36 remaining defendants on May 14, 1990.|$|R
50|$|As {{a federal}} judge in the Western District of Arkansas Arnold presided over a {{conspiracy}} involving sedition and plotted murder of federal officials. Fourteen defendants were tried, Arnold <b>directed</b> a <b>verdict</b> of acquittal for one and the other thirteen were acquitted by the jury.|$|R
40|$|In Nebraska a <b>directed</b> <b>verdicts</b> {{based on}} circumstantial {{evidence}} {{leading to an}} inference presents a difficult problem. Even the Supreme Court of the United States has hedged when called upon to formulate a rule to help guide trial judges in federal courts when they are considering what degree of circumstantial evidence is needed to allow a case {{to go to the}} jury. The court stated “... the essential requirement is that mere speculation be not allowed to do duty for probative facts, after making due allowance for all reasonably possible inferences favoring the party whose case is attacked. ” The majority of the Court in refusing to adopt a general rule concluded that the problem is one that must be solved in particular situations...|$|R
25|$|Three {{employees}} of the Radio Corporation of America, an Air Force contractor, were killed when a B-29 Superfortress crashed in 1948 in Waycross, Georgia. Their widows brought an action in tort seeking damages in federal court, under the Federal Tort Claims Act. As part of this action, they requested production of accident reports concerning the crash, but were told by the Air Force that the release of such details would threaten national security. Because {{of the failure of}} the government to produce the documents, a <b>directed</b> <b>verdict</b> in favor of the plaintiffs was granted by the trial court. The judgment was affirmed by the United States Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit. The United States Supreme Court reversed the decision, and remanded it to the trial court. After this, a settlement was reached with the widows, who received an aggregate sum of $170,000 in exchange for a release of liability to the Government.|$|E
500|$|The {{government}} is not permitted to appeal or try again after the entry of an acquittal, whether a <b>directed</b> <b>verdict</b> before the case is submitted to the jury, a <b>directed</b> <b>verdict</b> after a deadlocked jury, an appellate reversal for sufficiency (except by direct appeal to a higher appellate court), or an [...] "implied acquittal" [...] via conviction of a lesser included offense. In addition, the {{government is}} barred by collateral estoppel from re-litigating against the same defense a fact necessarily found by the jury in a prior acquittal, even if the jury hung on other counts.|$|E
500|$|This {{principle}} {{does not}} prevent the government from appealing a pre-trial motion to dismiss or other non-merits dismissal, or a <b>directed</b> <b>verdict</b> after a jury conviction, [...] Nor does it prevent the trial judge from entertaining a motion for reconsideration of a <b>directed</b> <b>verdict,</b> if the jurisdiction has so provided by rule or statute. Nor does it prevent the government from retrying the defendant after a deadlocked jury, an appellate reversal other than for sufficiency, including habeas, or [...] "thirteenth juror" [...] appellate reversals notwithstanding sufficiency {{on the principle that}} jeopardy has not [...] "terminated." [...] There may also be an exception for judicial bribery, but not jury bribery.|$|E
5000|$|At the {{conclusion}} of the evidence the trial judge granted the defendants' motions for nonsuit on several of the causes of action, and <b>directed</b> a <b>verdict</b> in favor of the university on the remaining causes of action. Thus, only the blood bank remained as a defendant, and the following questions were submitted to the jury: ...|$|R
5000|$|Gardner discredits the {{evidence}} against Foyle, and the judge <b>directs</b> a <b>verdict</b> of not guilty, but Gardner becomes increasingly unsure when Foyle begins stalking her. Burton follows Foyle to Scotland and confronts him, beginning a sequence of events leading to Foyle's death. Burton is charged with murder and elects to defend himself in court. While the jury is deliberating, Gardner confronts Burton with her theory that he committed [...] "the perfect crime". The jury comes back with a verdict of not proven and Burton is released.|$|R
5000|$|The {{district}} court concluded {{that as a}} matter of applicable Pennsylvania law, the driver of an automobile is presumed to have the permission of the owner. Although the defendants sought to introduce testimony by Dutcher (the car's owner) concerning the restrictions he had imposed on Cionci's use of the automobile, the court held that under Pennsylvania's [...] "Dead Man Rule" [...] Dutcher was incompetent to testify, because his interests were adverse to that of Lynch's estate. Since there was no other evidence controverting the presumption of permission by Dutcher, the {{district court}} <b>directed</b> a <b>verdict</b> in favor of the Provident Tradesmens Bank.|$|R
500|$|The {{trial was}} held in San Francisco in September 1886. [...] The {{prosecution}} called four witnesses, including Iyouse's wife and {{a witness to the}} murder named [...] "Charlie". [...] The defense called one witness, John B. Treadwell. [...] Treadwell testified that the murder was outside the boundaries of the reservation. [...] Based on Treadwell's position within the General Land Office, the judge believed him and ordered a <b>directed</b> <b>verdict</b> of not guilty.|$|E
500|$|The {{reasonable}} doubt standard is primarily effectuated by jury instructions, but it retains its relevance when {{the trial judge}} considers a motion for a <b>directed</b> <b>verdict</b> of acquittal and when an appellate court reviews the sufficiency of the evidence. On federal habeas review of a state conviction for sufficiency of the evidence, to grant relief, the reviewing court must find that [...] "upon the record evidence adduced at the trial no rational trier of fact could have found proof of guilt beyond a {{reasonable doubt}}." [...] In a successive, abusive, or defaulted federal habeas review of a state conviction, a defendant claiming [...] "actual innocence" [...] must show that [...] "it is {{more likely than not}} that no reasonable juror would have found petitioner guilty beyond a reasonable doubt." ...|$|E
2500|$|In November 2013, Servin {{was charged}} with [...] "involuntary" [...] manslaughter, but was cleared of all charges on April 20, 2015, by Judge Dennis J. Porter in a rare <b>directed</b> <b>verdict.</b>|$|E
25|$|The most {{important}} precedent {{in the case}} was recent. Three years earlier, in United States v. Galloway, a panel of the Seventh Circuit had sustained a mail-fraud conviction in United States v. Galloway, another case involving odometer tampering. Crabb had also presided over that case's trial, and had <b>directed</b> a not-guilty <b>verdict</b> after the jury convicted.|$|R
50|$|Jury nullification in the United States has {{its origins}} in colonial British America. Similar to British law, in the United States jury nullification occurs when a jury in a {{criminal}} case reaches a verdict contrary to the weight of evidence, sometimes because of a disagreement with the relevant law. The American jury draws its power of nullification from its right to render a general verdict in criminal trials, the inability of criminal courts to <b>direct</b> a <b>verdict</b> no matter how strong the evidence, the Fifth Amendment’s Double Jeopardy Clause, which prohibits the appeal of an acquittal, and the fact that jurors can never be punished for the verdict they return.|$|R
5000|$|Rantoul’s efforts, however, were greatly {{undermined}} by Judge Thacher’s emotional charge to the jury. Thacher {{told the jury}} that if societies such as the Bootmaker’s Society were justified by the law and became common, it would “render property insecure, and make it the spoil of the multitude, would annihilate property, and involve society in a common ruin.” [...] Thacher also specifically rebutted Rantoul {{with regard to the}} status of the common law, stating that “conspiracy is an offence at common law, as adopted in Massachusetts, and by this decision and that of this court you must abide.” [...] Levy wrote that Thacher’s charge, “practically <b>directed</b> a <b>verdict</b> of guilty.” ...|$|R
2500|$|The {{government}} is not permitted to appeal or try again after the entry of an acquittal, whether a <b>directed</b> <b>verdict</b> before the case is submitted to the jury, a <b>directed</b> <b>verdict</b> after a deadlocked jury, an appellate reversal for sufficiency (except by direct appeal to a higher appellate court), or an [...] "implied acquittal" [...] via conviction of a lesser included offense.

2500|$|On September 12, 1928, Jack Alfred, a crewman on Cowlitz, {{was injured}} while making fast {{a line from}} a log raft. [...] Alfred brought an action against Smith Transportation Company, {{the owners of the}} Cowlitz, in the U.S. District Court, seeking $15,000 in damages. [...] On April 16, 1929, Judge George M. Bourquin gave a <b>directed</b> <b>verdict</b> for Smith Transportation Company, ruling that no {{negligence}} had been established by Alfred and the only negligence that had been shown was that of Alfred himself.|$|E
5000|$|Returned to Cincinnati on {{the grand}} larceny charge, Ryan delayed the trial {{for almost two}} years. During this time Ed, who had {{sometimes}} run Ryan's operations in his absence, died, apparently leaving the State without the means of proving its case. At his trial in 1927, the judge <b>directed</b> a <b>verdict</b> in Jack's favor {{on the basis of}} the state's failure to prove its case. (The only trial Ryan lost occurred in 1910 when a civil action was brought by a man he had attacked in a rage in a Cincinnati bar, resulting in the man suffering an eye injury. The jury awarded the man $3,000.) ...|$|R
5000|$|Stone {{concluded}} that the NLRB's decision was {{not supported by the}} evidence. The NLRB agents' proposals to the employer did not constitute a request for bargaining under the NLRA, and so the employer's refusal to respond to them was not a violation of the law. The NLRB's conclusions, Stone said, were not based on [...] "substantial" [...] evidence. The majority defined substantial evidence as evidence which [...] "must do more than create a suspicion of the existence of the fact to be established. It is such relevant evidence as a reasonable mind might accept as adequate to support a conclusion, and it must be enough to justify, if the trial were to a jury, a refusal to <b>direct</b> a <b>verdict</b> when the conclusion sought to be drawn from it is one of fact for the jury.|$|R
5000|$|His {{principal}} opponents were {{prisoners who}} had lived comfortably within the system before his reforms, by intimidating others or using their financial resources to bribe guards for privileges. One of these, a former Manhattan banker in prison for larceny, used his financial and political connections to instigate a rigged [...] "investigation" [...] of Osborne's administration. When he was indicted for perjury, neglect of duty, and [...] "unlawful sexual acts with inmates," [...] Osborne fought back with a speaking tour of the state. Carnegie Hall saw two mass meetings supporting his defense, one attended by the retired president of Harvard University Charles William Eliot. The prison guards wrote a letter in support as well. After {{the judge in the}} case <b>directed</b> a <b>verdict</b> of acquittal, Osborne returned to Sing Sing in triumph. The front page of the New York Times described the celebration at the prison: [...] "Convicts' Carnival Welcomes Osborne; Prisoners, in Costume and Wild with Joy, Give Pageant for Him at Sing Sing, Hundreds of Spectators." ...|$|R
2500|$|The Coll {{trial began}} in December 1931. He {{retained}} famed defense lawyer Samuel Leibowitz. Coll {{claimed that he}} was {{miles away from the}} shooting scene and was being framed by his enemies. He added that he would love to tear the throat out of the person who killed Vengalli. [...] The prosecution case soon fell apart. Their sole witness to the shooting, George Brecht, admitted on the witness stand to having a criminal and mental health record, and to making similar testimony in a previous murder case in St Louis, Missouri. At the end of December, the judge issued a <b>directed</b> <b>verdict</b> of not guilty for Coll.|$|E
2500|$|Flaum {{pointed to}} Schmuck's motion for a <b>directed</b> <b>verdict</b> after the {{prosecution}} finished its case. One of the defendant's arguments {{had been that}} the mailings were not only not necessary to the fraud, they were actually counterproductive to his scheme because they increased the chance that his crime would be discovered. The district judge had denied it as properly {{a question for the}} jury to decide, a decision Flaum called correct. But that denial, he continued, was exactly why the jury needed to be able to consider odometer tampering as a lesser included charge. [...] "Because this rational possibility existed based on the record assembled at trial, the defendant was entitled to a lesser instruction on odometer tampering." ...|$|E
2500|$|Goetz {{was tried}} before a Manhattan jury of 10 whites and 2 blacks, of whom 6 had {{been victims of}} street crime. He was acquitted of the {{attempted}} murder and first-degree assault charges and convicted of criminal possession of a weapon in the third degree – carrying a loaded, unlicensed weapon in a public place. He was sentenced to six months in jail, one year's psychiatric treatment, five years' probation, 200 hours community service, and a $5,000 fine. An appellate court affirmed the conviction and changed the sentence to one year in jail without probation. The order of the appellate court was affirmed because the trial court had not erred in instructing the jury that, if it found the People had proved each {{of the elements of}} the crime beyond a reasonable doubt, it [...] "must" [...] find the defendant guilty. This was not a <b>directed</b> <b>verdict.</b> Goetz served eight months.|$|E
2500|$|Jack [...] "the Dandy" [...] Parisi {{was acquitted}} of two murders, Teamsters {{official}} Morris Diamond in Brooklyn and music-publishing executive Irving Penn in the Bronx. Penn was killed by mistaken identity, as the intended target, Philip Orlofsky, a Cutters Union official, left his home early to get a shave the day his killers waited for him. Parisi was a fugitive for 10 years, until he was captured in Pennsylvania in 1949. Albert Tannenbaum was brought in from Atlanta, where he was reportedly living, to testify for the prosecution. One accomplice in the Penn murder, Jacob [...] "Kuppy" [...] Migden, who provided the erroneous identification of Penn and {{who was also a}} fugitive for several years, pleaded guilty to attempted first-degree assault {{in the middle of his}} murder trial and was sentenced to a term of 5–10 years. Each of Parisi's murder trials ended with an acquittal, as the judges <b>directed</b> a <b>verdict</b> of not-guilty due to the lack of corroborating evidence, since the chief witnesses for the prosecution were accomplices. He died at home of natural causes on December 27, 1982, at the age of 85.|$|R
40|$|Plaintiff, city housing authority, invited {{bids for}} {{construction}} work reserving {{the right to}} reject any and all bids. Defendant surety’s principal submitted the low bid along with the requisite bid bond, the bond being conditioned upon {{the withdrawal of the}} bid within thirty days, failure to enter the contract and perform. The Commissioners of the plaintiff adopted a motion to award the contract to the principal “subject to the approval of the Public Housing Administration. ” The next day the principal notified the plaintiff of a mistake in computation of his bid and withdrew. Almost three weeks later, plaintiff approved the bid and the principal declined to execute the contract. Plaintiff sues defendant surety for the difference between bid price and next lowest bid. The trial court <b>directed</b> a <b>verdict</b> for the plaintiff. Held, reversed with directions to enter judgment for defendant. The defendant surety offered two defenses to the action on the bond contract: (1) An offer may be withdrawn at any time before it is accepted; and (2) Even if the offer was accepted, mistake vitiated the contract. The second point was never reached because the court allowed the defense in point one. An elementary rule of contract law is that an offer may be withdrawn at any time before acceptance...|$|R
5000|$|Judge Henry Clay McDowell was {{presiding}} and, after a strenuous {{trial of}} several days, <b>directed</b> a <b>verdict</b> {{in favor of}} the defendant. The lawyer representing the plaintiff was Dan Trigg, a giant of the bar and the leading lawyer in Western Virginia. Judge McDowell bent over to tie his shoe, and the bench, at that time being elevated some two feet above the floor of the courtroom, screened him from the sight of everyone in the room. [...] "Damn a federal judge anyhow," [...] Mr. Trigg exclaimed, being audible to all. Judge McDowell, of course, heard the remark, but remained stooped over and left the courtroom by a door just behind the judge's chair so that no one knew he was in the room. He later summoned all the other lawyers in the courtroom to his chambers and said that he had heard Mr. Trigg's remark. He asked the lawyers if anyone in the room knew that he had heard it. When the lawyers advised him that no one had, he stated the rule that lawyers had a constitutional right to cuss the judge and, since Mr. Trigg didn't know he had been heard, {{he was not going to}} be fined.|$|R
