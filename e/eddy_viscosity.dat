40|$|This report {{presents}} {{the use of}} a time-marching three-dimensional compressible Navier-Stokes equation numerical solver with a one-equation turbulence model to simulate the flow fields developed along concave wall surfaces without and with a downstream extension flat wall surface. The 3 -D Navier- Stokes numerical solver came from the NASA Glenn-HT code. The one-equation turbulence model was derived from the Spalart and Allmaras model. The computational approach was first calibrated with the computations of the velocity and Reynolds shear stress profiles of a steady flat plate boundary layer flow. The computational approach was then used to simulate developing boundary layer flows along concave wall surfaces without and with a downstream extension wall. The author investigated the computational results of surface friction factors, near surface velocity components, near wall temperatures, and a turbulent shear stress component in terms of turbulence modeling, computational mesh configurations, inlet turbulence level, and time iteration step. The computational results were compared with existing measurements of skin friction factors, velocity components, and shear stresses of the developing boundary layer flows. With a fine computational mesh and a one-equation model, the computational approach could predict accurately the skin friction factors, near surface velocity and temperature, and shear stress within the flows. The computed velocity components and shear stresses also showed the vortices effect on the velocity variations over a concave wall. The computed <b>eddy</b> <b>viscosities</b> at the near wall locations were also compared with the results from a two equation turbulence modeling technique. The inlet turbulence length scale was found to have little effect on the <b>eddy</b> <b>viscosities</b> at locations near the concave wall surface.

40|$|This paper {{deals with}} the {{numerical}} analysis for a finite element approximation of a steady coupled two-fluid RANS turbulence equations, used to model, for example, air-ocean flow interaction. Each fluid is modeled by the coupled steady Stokes equations with the equation for the turbulent kinetic energy TKE. The <b>eddy</b> <b>viscosities</b> for velocity and TKE depend on the energy. The production (source) term for the TKEs is only in L 1, and the boundary condition for the TKEs on the interface between the two flows depends quadratically on the difference of velocities. To overcome the lack of regularity, we approximate the initial system by a regularized one, in which the <b>eddy</b> <b>viscosities</b> and source terms for the TKEs are regularized by convolution. We perform its finite element discretization, combined with a decoupled iterative lin-earization procedure. We prove that the discrete scheme converges to the continuous one for large enough <b>eddy</b> <b>viscosities</b> in natural norms. Finally, we present some numerical tests where we study {{the accuracy of the}} procedure, and simulate a realistic flow in which an imposed wind in the upper atmosphere generates an upwelling in the oceanic flow. 1. Introduction. We consider the numerical analysis for finite element approximation of RANS (Reynolds-Averaged Navier-Stokes) turbulence models, and more precisely of a coupled two-fluid RANS models. This system can model the coupled atmosphere-ocean system, whose accurate numerical simulation is crucial to analyze the main issues related to climate change. From the practical point of view, RANS models are rather diffusive and provide overall predictions of many flows of engineering interest (Cf. Davidson [21]). However, from the mathematical point of view RANS equations are more singular than the Navier-Stokes equations. The main mathematical difficulties comes from the source term (the production term) for the TKE equations which has a L 1 (Ω) regularity only, implying that the TKE equations do not make sense in H − 1 (Ω). Their solution must be understood in the renormalized –or entropy– sense (Cf. [1, 7, 6, 8, 9, 10]) ...|$|R

40|$|In {{the present}} paper, we use {{numerical}} simulation to investigate currents, mixing and water renewal in Barcelona harbour under typical conditions of wind forcing {{for the winter}} season. This site is of particular importance due to the interplay between touristic and commercial activities, requiring detailed and high-definition studies of water quality within the harbour. We use Large Eddy Simulation (LES) which directly resolves the anisotropic and energetic large scales of motion and parametrizes the small, dissipative, ones. Smallscale turbulence is modelled by the anisotropic Smagorinsky model (ASM) to be employed in presence of large cell anisotropy. The complexity of the harbour is modelled {{using a combination of}} curvilinear, structured, non-staggered grid and the immersed boundary method. Boundary conditions for wind and currents at the inlets of the port are obtained from in-situ measurements. Analysis of the numerical results is carried out based on both instantaneous and time-averaged velocity fields. First- and second-order statistics, such as turbulent kinetic energy and horizontal and vertical <b>eddy</b> <b>viscosities,</b> are calculated and their spatial distribution is discussed. The study shows the presence of intense current in the narrow and elongated part of the harbour together with sub-surface along-shore elongated rolling structures (with a time scale of a few hours), and they contribute to the vertical water mixing. Time-averaged velocity field reveals intense upwelling and downwelling zones along the walls of the harbour. The analysis of second-order statistics shows strong inhomogeneity of turbulent kinetic energy and horizontal and vertical <b>eddy</b> <b>viscosities</b> in the horizontal plane, with larger values in the regions characterized by stronger currents. The water renewal within the port is quantified for particular sub-domain regions, showing that the complexity of the harbour is such that certain in-harbour basins have a water renewal of over five days, including the yacht marina area. The LES solution compares favourably with available current-meter data. The LES solution is also compared with a RANS solution obtained in literature for the same site under the same forcing conditions, the comparison demonstrating a large sensitivity of properties to model resolution and frictional parametrization...|$|R
