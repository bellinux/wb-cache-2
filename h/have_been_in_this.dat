500|$|Tickets for the Best of Both Worlds Tour {{were selling}} out quite rapidly. Nevertheless, ticket {{scalping}} {{was one of}} the primary reasons for it. Many tickets were immediately found for purchase on secondary markets, such as eBay or StubHub, selling for well over the face value of the tickets. Broker prices ranged from $350 to $2,000 for the tickets originally sold for $29 to $66. The shortage of tickets for the tour became so pronounced it gained national attention, with parents frequently expressing their outrage, discontent, and disappointment on behalf of their children. Vice president of Ticketmaster, Joe Freeman commented, [...] "Hell hath no fury like the parent of a child throwing a tantrum. People who <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>in</b> <b>this</b> business for a long time are watching what's happening, and they say there hasn't been a demand of this level or intensity since The Beatles or Elvis [...]" [...] In an instance, a girl was unable to undergo a surgery she needed due to monetary issues, so she sold her tickets to a show of the tour for enough money to pay for the surgery. Debra Rathwell, senior vice president of AEG Live said the tickets were priced and sold as fairly as possible and assured there as no conspiracy between those who handled the tour and brokers. [...] "We do everything in our power to stop brokers from getting tickets, but it's impossible", she concluded. However, some brokers denied the allegations of purchasing most tickets for the shows. Brian Posey, owner of The Ticket Machine, an online broker based in East Lansing, Michigan, commented, [...] "I've never seen this as far as availability for any show. It's never been that hard to get tickets for us. You don't see seats anywhere. Parents shouldn't blame brokers for snapping up loads of tickets." [...] He continued to complain that the company was only able to purchase 28 tickets, while they usually averaged hundreds of tickets for hot tours.|$|E

2500|$|The first {{written record}} of the herd dates from 1645 but the Chillingham herd is claimed by some to <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>in</b> <b>this</b> site for at least seven centuries.

[...] Since 2009, this species has now become a common breeder in Lake County, Florida, with adult pairs with offspring seen by lakes and in wetlands near Eustis, Tavares, Leesburg, and other municipalities; large wintering flocks of 30+ birds can be seen throughout the county, even up to Lake Norris in the NE central portion of the county (Ralph Risch, Biologist II, Florida Forest Service, Lake Forestry Station; personal observation). There has been a large flock noted for about two years in the River Plantation area of Parrish in Manatee County, Florida.

2500|$|If {{we begin}} at the stable {{retracted}} position {{at the end of}} a tidewater glacier cycle the glacier will have a moderate calving rate and a high AAR, above 70. [...] The glacier will build a terminus shoal of sediment further reducing the calving rate. [...] This will improve the glacier mass balance and the glacier can begin to advance due to this change or an increase in ice flux to the terminus due to increasing snowfall or reduced snow melt. [...] As the advance proceeds the terminus shoal will be pushed in front of the glacier and continue to build, keeping the calving rate low. [...] In the case of the most glaciers such as the Taku Glacier the glacier will eventually build a terminus shoal that is above water and calving will essentially cease. This will eliminate this loss of ice from the glacier and the glacier can continue to advance. Taku Glacier and Hubbard Glacier <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>in</b> <b>this</b> phase of the cycle. Taku Glacier which has been advancing for 120 years no longer calves. Hubbard Glacier still has a calving front. The glacier will then expand until the AAR is between 60 and 70 and equilibrium of the non-calving glacier is achieved. [...] The glacier is not very sensitive to climate during the advance as its AAR is quite high, when the terminus shoal is limiting calving.|$|E

2500|$|Once it is {{established}} that a dismissal took place, the employer must show that its reason for dismissing the employee was [...] "fair". Dismissal {{on grounds of}} union membership, or {{one of a number}} of grounds set out in sections 99 to 107 of the Employment Rights Act 1996, will be automatically unfair. Otherwise the employer has the opportunity to show the dismissal is fair if it falls within five main categories listed in ERA 1996 section 98. The dismissal must have been because of the employee's capability or qualifications, because of conduct, because the employee was redundant, because continued employment would contravene a law, or because of [...] "some other substantial reason". If the employer has an argument based on one of these categories, then the tribunal evaluates whether the employer's actual decision fell within a [...] "reasonable range of responses", i.e. that a reasonable employer could have acted the same way. Thus the review standard lies in between an outright perversity, or [...] "Wednesbury unreasonableness" [...] test and a forthright reasonable person test. The test arguably requires Tribunals to evaluate the employer's conduct according to good enterprise practice, by analogy to the Bolam test in tort. The [...] "proportionality test" [...] (requiring the employer's action is appropriate, necessary and reasonable in pursuit of a legitimate aim) has also been proposed as an alternative, which would have the advantage of deferring to the employer's aim, if legitimate, but scrutinising whether its actions were proportionate. In practice, the Court of Appeal has given conflicting judgments and remains unable to articulate what the test means, begging the question of how a [...] "hypothetical reasonable employer" [...] standard under section 98(4)(a) should actually be applied. It has been repeated that Tribunals should not substitute their judgment for the employer's. However, there is considerable room for Tribunals to assess the facts and come to their own conclusions, which can only be appealed on legal grounds, and not on their judgment of good workplace relations. For example, in a conduct case, HSBC Bank plc v Madden, the Court of Appeal held that it was acceptable for a Tribunal to have decided that dismissing an employee for potential involvement in theft of credit cards was fair, even though an actual police investigation turned up no evidence. By contrast, in Bowater v Northwest London Hospitals NHS Trust, an employer argued a nurse who, while physically restraining a naked patient who was unconscious and having a seizure, said [...] "It's been a few months since I <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>in</b> <b>this</b> position with a man underneath me" [...] was lewd and deserved dismissal for her misconduct. The Tribunal said the dismissal was unfair and the Court of Appeal held the Tribunal had competently exercised its discretion in granting the unfair dismissal claim. The absence of a role for elected worker representatives in assessing the fairness of the employer or manager's conduct in the UK contrasts to many EU member states. While courts act as a final check, it is often thought that the parties best placed to resolve disputes would be representatives of all staff members, who (unlike an employer or manager) usually have fewer conflicts of interest in dismissal disputes.|$|E
