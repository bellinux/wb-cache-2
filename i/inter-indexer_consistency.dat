50|$|An {{alternative}} is assignment indexing where index terms {{are taken from}} a controlled vocabulary. This {{has the advantage of}} controlling for synonyms as the preferred term is indexed and synonyms or related terms direct the user to the preferred term. This means the user can find articles regardless of the specific term used by the author and saves the user from having to know and check all possible synonyms. It also removes any confusion caused by homographs by inclusion of a qualifying term. A third advantage is that it allows the linking of related terms whether they are linked by hierarchy or association, e.g. an index entry for an oral medication may list other oral medications as related terms on the same level of the hierarchy but would also link to broader terms such as treatment. Assignment indexing is used in manual indexing to improve <b>inter-indexer</b> <b>consistency</b> as different indexers will have a controlled set of terms to choose from. Controlled vocabularies do not completely remove inconsistencies as two indexers may still interpret the subject differently.|$|E

This paper {{seeks to}} report a project to {{investigate}} the degree of <b>inter-indexer</b> <b>consistency</b> in the assignment of controlled vocabulary topical subject index terms to identical graphical images by different indexers at the National Library of Wales (NLW). Design/methodology/approach ? An experimental quantitative methodology was devised to investigate <b>inter-indexer</b> <b>consistency.</b> Additionally, the project investigated the relationship, if any, between indexing exhaustivity and consistency, and the relationship, if any, between indexing consistency/exhaustivity and broad category of graphic format. Findings ? <b>Inter-indexer</b> <b>consistency</b> in the assignment of topical subject index terms to graphic materials at the NLW {{was found to be}} generally low and highly variable. <b>Inter-indexer</b> <b>consistency</b> fell within the range 10. 8 per cent to 48. 0 per cent. Indexing exhaustivity varied substantially from indexer to indexer, with a mean assignment of 3. 8 terms by each indexer to each image, falling within the range 2. 5 to 4. 7 terms. The broad category of graphic format, whether photographic or non-photographic, was found to have little influence on either <b>inter-indexer</b> <b>consistency</b> or indexing exhaustivity. Indexing exhaustivity and <b>inter-indexer</b> <b>consistency</b> exhibited a tendency toward a direct, positive relationship. The findings are necessarily limited as this is a small-scale study within a single institution. Originality/value ? Previous consistency studies have almost exclusively investigated the indexing of print materials, with very little research published for non-print media. With the literature also rich in discussion of the added complexities of subjectively representing the intellectual content of visual media, this study attempts to enrich existing knowledge on indexing consistency for graphic materials and to address a noticeable gap in information theory.

Professional indexers too exhibit convergence and divergence in indexing behaviour, which has been measured in <b>inter-indexer</b> <b>consistency</b> studies. Leonard (1977) and Markey (1984) examined the results of multiple <b>inter-indexer</b> <b>consistency</b> studies examining not only the levels of inconsistency which varied widely but also the level of indexing exhaustivity (number of terms assigned to each document), method of collecting indexing data and vocabulary size. The majority of <b>inter-indexer</b> <b>consistency</b> studies show high levels of inconsistency between indexers (Leonard 1977; Markey 1984). While <b>inter-indexer</b> <b>consistency</b> studies have traditionally compared the indexing terms used by {{a small group of}} indexers, it is possible to adapt some of the more common measures to be used with large groups of indexers. A number of measures were examined in this study to determine which measures provide the most ability to distinguish between different indexers. This study used Salton's Cosine measure, the Jaccard measure [...] also known as Hooper and Rolling's measures (Markey 1984), Wolfram and Olsen's <b>Inter-indexer</b> <b>Consistency</b> Density (Wolfram and Olsen 2007) and a Pairwise Jaccard measure (compares all indexers to each other without the need for a centroid or known good set of index terms). This study {{is part of a larger}} study examining measures of convergence and divergence in tagging systems. One goal of the larger study is to examine different ways of analysing tag data to see which methods provide the most useful analyses of the structures which develop in tagging. By calculating a number of different <b>inter-indexer</b> <b>consistency</b> measures it may be possible to make distinctions between tag lists to provide predictive analysis of tagging patterns...|$|E
40|$|When {{professional}} indexers independently assign {{terms to}} a given document, the term sets generally differ between indexers. Studies of <b>inter-indexer</b> <b>consistency</b> measure the percentage of matching index terms, {{but none of them}} consider the semantic relationships that exist amongst these terms. We propose to represent multiple-indexers data in a vector space and use the cosine metric as a new consistency measure that can be extended by semantic relations between index terms. We believe that this new measure is more accurate and realistic than existing ones and therefore more suitable for evaluation of automatically extracted index terms...|$|E
40|$|Consistency in the {{assignment}} of indexing terms has been studied on the small scale for many years. As opportunities increase for {{large numbers of people}} to contribute to indexing of public documents on the World Wide Web, consistency on the large scale becomes problematic. This pilot study examines <b>inter-indexer</b> <b>consistency</b> on a larger scale than other studies. Consistency in {{the assignment}} of indexing terms to a document follows an inverse shape, although it is not strictly power law-based, as has been observed for many social phenomena. The authors discuss the challenges and potential benefits of having this diversity of indexing access points to documents and their implications for effective information architecture...|$|E
40|$|This study {{measures}} <b>inter-indexer</b> <b>consistency</b> {{as determined}} by the number of identical terms assigned to the same documents by two different indexing organizations using the same thesaurus as a source for the entry vocabulary. The authors derive consistency figures of 24 percent and 45 percent for two samples. Factors in the consistency failures include variations in indexing depth, differences in choice of concepts for indexing, different indexing policies, and a highly specific indexing vocabulary. Results indicate that broad search strategies are often necessary for adequate search yields. he {{purpose of this study is}} to determine how well subject authority lists control index-ing vocabulary. Successful re-trieval of stored information depends, to a significant extent, on consistent-and therefore predictable-representation o...|$|E
40|$|Conventional {{methods for}} {{retrieving}} {{information from the}} medical literature are imprecise and inefficient. Information retrieval systems employ unmanageable indexing vocabularies or use full-text representations that overwhelm the user with irrelevant information. This paper describes a document representation designed to improve the precision of searching in textual databases without significantly compromising recall. The representation augments simple text word representations with contextual models that reflect recurring semantic themes in clinical publications. Using this representation, a searcher may indicate both the terms of interest and the contexts in which they should occur. The contexts limit the potential interpretations of text words, and thus {{form the basis for}} more precise searching. In this paper, we discuss the shortcomings of traditional retrieval systems and describe our context-based representation. Improved retrieval performance with contextual models is illustrated by example, and a more extensive study is proposed. We present an evaluation of the contextual models as an indexing scheme, using a variation of the traditional <b>inter-indexer</b> <b>consistency</b> experiments, and we demonstrate that contextual indexing is reproducible by minimally trained physicians and medical students...|$|E
40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{evaluate}} a new system, ISAID (Internet-based Semi-automated Indexing of Documents), and to generate textbook indexes {{that are more}} detailed and more useful to readers. DESIGN: Pilot evaluation: simple, nonrandomized trial comparing ISAID with manual indexing methods. Methods evaluation: randomized, cross-over trial comparing three versions of ISAID and usability survey. PARTICIPANTS: Pilot evaluation: two physicians. Methods evaluation: twelve physicians, each of whom used three {{different versions of the}} system for a total of 36 indexing sessions. MEASUREMENTS: Total index term tuples generated per document per minute (TPM), with and without adjustment for concordance with other subjects; inter-indexer consistency; ratings of the usability of the ISAID indexing system. RESULTS: Compared with manual methods, ISAID decreased indexing times greatly. Using three versions of ISAID, <b>inter-indexer</b> <b>consistency</b> ranged from 15 % to 65 % with a mean of 41 %, 31 %, and 40 % for each of three documents. Subjects using the full version of ISAID were faster (average TPM: 5. 6) and had higher rates of concordant index generation. There were substantial learning effects, despite our use of a training/run-in phase. Subjects using the full version of ISAID were much faster by the third indexing session (average TPM: 9. 1). There was a statistically significant increase in three-subject concordant indexing rate using the full version of ISAID during the second indexing session (p < 0. 05). SUMMARY: Users of the ISAID indexing system create complex, precise, and accurate indexing for full-text documents much faster than users of manual methods. Furthermore, the natural language processing methods that ISAID uses to suggest indexes contributes substantially to increased indexing speed and accuracy...|$|E
