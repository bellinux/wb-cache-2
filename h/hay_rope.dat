50|$|The play, {{in three}} acts, was {{dedicated}} to Henry Wood, and its first performance was by Frank Benson's English Shakespearean Company at the Gaiety Theatre, Dublin on 21 October 1901; it appeared in a double bill, being followed by Douglas Hyde's Casadh an tSugáin (The Twisting of the <b>Hay</b> <b>Rope)</b> performed by Irish-speaking amateurs supplied by the Gaelic League (the first Irish-language play ever seen on a regular stage). The part of Diarmuid was played by Benson, Grania by his wife Constance, and Laban by Lucy Franklein.|$|E
5000|$|Deois {{was finally}} {{captured}} at the Cúinne Geal {{in the following}} circumstances: [...] "A man and his son {{were on their way}} from Galway after selling a cart of hay. Jocye, knowning they had the price of the hay, attacked, but they put up a great struggle. The father, who didnt want to part with his money, grappled with Joyce and succeeded in getting him around {{to the rear of the}} horse cart. The son then hit him on the head with a loaded butt. A loaded butt was a leadfilled stick used at that time in faction fighting. While he was still stunned they tied him with the <b>hay</b> <b>ropes</b> (Súgán) which were normally tied around the shafts at the back of the cart. They then dragged him after the cart to Oranmore police station." ...|$|R
5000|$|Once the tedding {{process had}} finished, the hay {{was made into}} a ruck. In Boho, {{depending}} on the moisture of the ground, it was traditional to place some branches on the ground or old hay to stop the bottom of the new ruck getting wet. The ruck was constructed by two or three people pitching up hay to a person on top of the ruck (sometimes a child) who tramped the hay down so that it was compact. When the ruck was high enough, usually the height of the person pitching the hay plus the length of their pitchfork, somebody would pull out the bottom circumference of the ruck and pitch that hay up on top as well. Two <b>hay</b> <b>ropes</b> made with a twister were usually thrown {{over the top of the}} ruck at right angles to each other and secured by pulling out a piece of hay at the bottom of the ruck and making another short attachment, so that the ropes and the bottom of the ruck could be connected. After this was done, the ruck would be [...] "dressed" [...] by raking down the outside so that water would run off the top during the rain. The surrounding ground was raked for hay, which was transferred over to the next ruck.|$|R
5000|$|The {{earliest}} surviving {{reference is}} in a charter of Bishop Gilbert of London in 1100-07, as [...] (All Saints {{that is called}} Seamen's church, in London). Other early records refer to the church {{by a number of}} names, including All Hallows the More, All Hallows Thames Street, All Hallows in the Hay and All Hallows in the Ropery. According to John Stow, the latter descriptions were given because hay was sold at the nearby <b>Hay</b> Wharf and <b>ropes</b> were made in the high street.|$|R
6000|$|It was {{not long}} after that the two women came in again, each of them having a bundle of hay in her apron. Hanrahan was not singing now, but he was talking to Oona very fast and soft, and he was saying: 'The house is narrow but the world is wide, and there is no true lover that need be afraid of night or morning or sun or stars or shadows of evening, or any earthly thing.' 'Hanrahan,' said the mother then, {{striking}} him on the shoulder, 'will you give me a hand here for a minute?' 'Do that, Hanrahan,' said the woman of the neighbours, 'and help us to make this <b>hay</b> into a <b>rope,</b> for you are ready with your hands, and a blast of wind has loosened the thatch on the haystack.' ...|$|R
50|$|At random, {{they spotted}} Michael Donald {{while he was}} walking home after buying his sister a pack of cigarettes. They lured him over to their car by asking him for {{directions}} to a local club, and then forced Donald into the car at gunpoint. The men then drove out to another county {{and took him to}} a secluded area in the woods. At this moment, Donald attempted to escape, knocking away Hays' gun and trying to run into the woods. The men pursued Donald, attacked him and beat him with a tree limb. <b>Hays</b> wrapped a <b>rope</b> around Donald's neck and pulled on it to strangle him while Knowles continued to beat Donald with a tree branch. Once Donald had stopped moving, Hays slit his throat three times {{to make sure he was}} dead. The men left Donald's body hanging from a tree in a mixed-race neighborhood in Mobile. The tree was on Herndon Street, across from a house owned by Klan leader Bennie Jack Hays, the father of Henry Hays.|$|R
