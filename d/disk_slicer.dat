40|$|The {{effects of}} methods used for peeling and {{physiological}} age (over-wintering) {{on the quality}} and storage life of carrot disks packaged in modified atmosphere were examined. Commercial mechanical abrasion peeling using fine or coarse carborundum plates, was compared with carrots peeled by hand, before <b>slicing</b> into <b>disks.</b> <b>Slices</b> which had been peeled by abrasion had higher respiration rates, greater microbial contamination and growth rates, higher pH values, higher rates of weight loss and shorter microbiological shelf-lives than those which had been hand peeled. These results reflected the higher quality of the manually peeled carrots. Micrographs of the peeled surfaces confirmed that abrasion peeling inflicted greater damage. Carrots lifted in the autumn produced slices with longer shelf-lives than carrots lifted in the spring after over-wintering in the ground for four months...|$|R

40|$|Bimetallic rolls {{are widely}} used in steel rolling {{industries}} because of the excellent hardness, wear resistance and high temperature properties. Controlling the residual stress distribution is necessary since the compressive residual stress at the surface may improve fatigue life though the tensile residual stress at the center may reduce the strength. Therefore, {{it is necessary to}} measure the residual stress distribution from the surface to center correctly to ensure the roll quality. The disk method has been widely used in predicting the roll residual stress by measuring the stress of the thin <b>sliced</b> <b>disk</b> from the roll. In this study, therefore, the relation between the original roll residual stress and the <b>sliced</b> <b>disk</b> residual stress is investigated for the single material roll and bimetallic roll on the basis of thermo-elastic-plastic FEM analysis.

40|$|The thesis {{presents}} {{development of}} a <b>disk</b> <b>slice</b> bearingless motor. Such a motor belongs to the magnetic bearings technique. There are practical experiences with radial magnetic bearing (homopolar type) at the CTU Prague. The idea {{is based on the}} elimination of physical contacts between the shaft and its housing. It employs magnetic forces between the stator and the rotor to keep the rotor in a defined position inside the stator. There are industrial applications using all magnetic bearing advantages as no friction, almost no vibrations, no material fatigue, low service costs. A fully levitated shaft with two radial bearings and one thrust bearing is the classical conception of a bearingless motor. The idea of a disc slice bearingless motor is a simplified classical conception. Once we shorten the shaft to a disk, the stabilizing (radial) forces are big enough to ensure axial stabilization passively.

5000|$|Disk {{partitioning}} or <b>disk</b> <b>slicing</b> is {{the creation}} of one or more regions on a hard disk or other secondary storage, so that an operating system can manage information in each region separately. Partitioning is typically the first step of preparing a newly manufactured disk, before any files or directories have been created. The disk stores the information about the partitions' locations and sizes in an area known as the partition table that the operating system reads before any other part of the disk. Each partition then appears in the operating system as a distinct [...] "logical" [...] disk that uses part of the actual disk. System administrators use a program called a partition editor to create, resize, delete, and manipulate the partitions.When a hard drive is installed in a computer, it must be partitioned before you can format and use it. Partitioning a drive is when you divide the total storage of a drive into different pieces. These pieces are called partitions. Once a partition is created, it can then be formatted {{so that it can be}} used on a computer.|$|R

We give a characterization of fibered homotopy-ribbon disks and give analogues of the Stallings twist for fibered disks and 2 -knots.

40|$|We {{show that}} a {{decorated}} knot concordance C from K to K' induces a homomorphism F_C on knot Floer homology that preserves the Alexander and Maslov gradings. Furthermore, it induces a morphism of the spectral sequences to HF(S^ 3) Z_ 2 that agrees with F_C on the E^ 1 page and is the identity on the E^∞ page. It follows that F_C is non-vanishing on HFK_ 0 (K, τ(K)). We also obtain an invariant of <b>slice</b> <b>disks</b> in homology 4 -balls bounding S^ 3. If C is invertible, then F_C is injective, hence HFK_j(K,i) <HFK_j(K',i) for every i, j ∈Z.

40|$|The {{kinematics}} and morphology of {{the broad}} emission line region (BELR) of quasars {{are the subject of}} significant debate. The two leading methods for constraining BELR properties are microlensing and reverberation mapping. Here we combine these two methods with a study of the microlensing behaviour of the BELR in Q 2237 + 0305, as a change in continuum emission (a "flare") passes through it. Beginning with some generic models of the BELR - sphere, bicones, <b>disk</b> - we <b>slice</b> in velocity and time to produce brightness profiles of the BELR over the duration of the flare. These are numerically microlensed to determine whether microlensing of reverberation mapping provides new information about the properties of BELRs. We describe our method and show images of the models as they are flaring, and the unlensed and lensed spectra that are produced. Qualitative results and a discussion of the spectra are given in this paper, highlighting some effects that could be observed. Our conclusion is that the influence of microlensing, while not strong, can produce significant observable effects that will help in differentiating the properties of BELRs.

40|$|Abstract. In [FT 05, Figure 1. 5] an {{incorrect}} example for [FT 05, Theorem 1. 3] was given. In this note {{we present a}} correct example. We first recall the satellite construction for knots. Let K,C be knots. Let A ⊂ S 3 K be a curve, unknotted in S 3. Then S 3 νA is a solid torus. Now let ψ: ∂(νA) → ∂(νC) be a diffeomorphism which sends a meridian of A to a longitude of C, and a longitude of A to a meridian of C. The space (S 3 νA) ∪ψ (S 3 νC) is a 3 -sphere {{and the image of}} K is denoted by S = S(K,C,A). We say S is the satellite knot with companion C, orbit K and axis A. Note that by doing this construction we replaced a tubular neighborhood of C by a knot in a solid torus, namely K ⊂ S 3 νA. We now consider the knot K in Figure 1. Note that K is just the knot 61. The K Figure 1. The knot K 1. knot K clearly bounds an immersed band, pushing this band into D 4 we can resolve the singularities to get a smooth <b>slice</b> <b>disk</b> D for K.

40|$|Abstract. If the Bing double of a knot K is slice, then K is algebraically slice. In {{addition}} the Heegaard–Floer concordance invariants τ, {{developed by}} Ozsváth-Szabó, and δ, developed by Manolescu and Owens, vanish on K. For a knot K ⊂ S 3, the Bing double, denoted B(K), is the two component link illustrated schematically in Figure 1. Within the box the two strands run parallel along a diagram for K, {{and for this}} to be well-defined, independent of the choice of diagram of K, the strands are twisted so that their algebraic crossing number within the box is zero. K Figure 1. Bing doubling, B(K) A link in S 3 is called slice if its components bound disjoint locally flat disks in the 4 –ball, a notion that is sometimes called strongly slice. The slicing of links formed via the construction of Bing doubling has been a focus of recent research, in part because of its connection to topological surgery in dimension four; see for instance [11, 12, 13]. Specifically, Bing doubling plays an essential role in the study of link theory, and especially in link concordance [7, 14, 22]. Harvey [8] and Teichner (unpublished) proved that if B(K) is slice, then the integral of the signature function of K over the unit circle is zero. Cimasoni [6] recently extended this in the case that B(K) is boundary slice (that is, the <b>slice</b> <b>disks</b> along with Seifert surfaces for the components of B(K) bound disjoint embedded 3 –manifolds in the 4 –ball), showing that this added assumption implies then K is algebraically slice.
