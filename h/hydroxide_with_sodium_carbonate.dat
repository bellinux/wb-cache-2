50|$|Some {{think that}} {{spodumene}} {{will become a}} less important source of lithium due {{to the emergence of}} alkaline brine lake sources in Chile, China and Argentina, which produce lithium chloride directly. Lithium chloride is converted to lithium carbonate and lithium <b>hydroxide</b> by reaction <b>with</b> <b>sodium</b> <b>carbonate</b> and calcium <b>hydroxide</b> respectively. However, pegmatite-based projects benefit from being quicker to move into production than brines, which can take 18 months to 3 years, depending on evaporation rates. With pegmatites, once a mill is built, the production of lithium carbonate takes only a matter of days.|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to {{evaluate}} the possibilities for chemical consumption reduction in P-P-Paa-P bleaching (P alkaline peroxide stage, Paa peracetic stage) of hot water treated straw and the effect of the wheat straw variability on the process. Papermaking fibre production from wheat straw using such a process could be implemented on a small scale if chemical consumption was low enough to eliminate the need for chemical recovery. The pulp properties obtained with this process are equal to or even superior to the properties of wheat straw soda pulp. The possibility of enhancing the first peroxide stage with oxygen and pressure was studied. The possibility for substitution of <b>sodium</b> <b>hydroxide</b> partially <b>with</b> <b>sodium</b> <b>carbonate</b> was also investigated. The objective was to achieve International Standardization Organization (ISO) brightness of 75 %, <b>with</b> minimal <b>sodium</b> <b>hydroxide</b> consumption, whilst maintaining the pulp properties. The optimization of the peroxide bleaching is challenging if the final brightness target cannot be reduced. Results indicate that up to 25 % of the sodium hydroxide could be substituted <b>with</b> <b>sodium</b> <b>carbonate</b> without losing brightness or affecting pulp properties. Another possibility is a mild alkali treatment between the hot water treatment and the bleaching sequence...|$|R

40|$|Objective: To {{describe}} {{the use of}} <b>sodium</b> <b>carbonate</b> and apomorphine in a historical cohort of dogs, compare the occurrence of emesis and report any adverse effects recorded. Methods: This historical, observational study included information from medical records of dogs that received an emetic agent. The occurrence of emesis <b>with</b> apomorphine or <b>sodium</b> <b>carbonate</b> was calculated and the association between emesis and agent was explored, with the odds ratio and 95 % confidence interval (CI) reported. A non-inferiority analysis of the occurrence of emesis for <b>sodium</b> <b>carbonate</b> was performed against an equivalence range of ± 7 % of the estimated occurrence of emesis with apomorphine. Owners were emailed a short survey about their dog's health after their visit {{to the hospital for}} induced emesis. Results: Records for 787 dogs seen from January 2007 to December 2013 were included. For apomorphine, 382 / 392 dogs showed emesis (97 %, 95 % CI 95 – 100 %). For <b>sodium</b> <b>carbonate,</b> 320 / 395 dogs showed emesis (81 %, 95 % CI 77 – 85 %), which fell below the equivalence range for apomorphine (97 ± 7 %, 90 – 100 %) and was considered inferior. The odds ratio of emesis <b>with</b> apomorphine to <b>sodium</b> <b>carbonate</b> was 9. 0 (95 % CI 4. 6 – 17. 6). Of 18 responses to the survey, 5 reported abnormalities after emesis (3 <b>with</b> <b>sodium</b> <b>carbonate,</b> 2 <b>with</b> apomorphine). Conclusion: The occurrence of emesis <b>with</b> <b>sodium</b> <b>carbonate</b> was high but inferior to apomorphine. However, the advantages of <b>sodium</b> <b>carbonate,</b> including less expense and ease of accession compared with apomorphine, make it a viable choice in emergency medicine...|$|R
40|$|Proteinases {{have the}} {{potential}} to effect partial solubilization of the proteinaceous gum sericin involved in binding the silk strands together in cocoon, an essential step in the silk cocoon cooking and reeling. Therefore, pineapple extract rich in cysteine proteinases was enzymologically characterized for its potential application in oak tasar (Antheraea proylei J.) silk cocoon cooking and reeling. Optimum <b>sodium</b> <b>carbonate</b> concentration (9. 8 mM) and optimum temperature (60 ºC) for the proteinase activity were determined. Though relatively thermostable, an enhanced activity loss was observed when the extract was incubated in the temperature range 70 - 90 ºC <b>with</b> <b>sodium</b> <b>carbonate.</b> Bulk of the activity (80 - 83 %) remained after 1 hr of time-dependent inactivation at 60 ºC. The tasar cocoon extract neither caused inhibition of the activity nor enhanced its time-dependent loss by incubation at 60 ºC.
