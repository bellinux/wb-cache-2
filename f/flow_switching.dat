A common method for <b>flow</b> <b>switching</b> in a centrifugal device is {{to utilize the}} Coriolis force within a Y-shaped structure. When the rotating speed is too low, the liquid flow will follow the original path; when the rotating speed is high enough, which is at almost {{the same level as}} centrifugal force, the liquid flow will be routed into another chamber.|$|E

50|$|Overflow {{affects the}} ability of the control system to achieve the set temperature. It need not be inevitable. Some {{pressure}} independent control valves enable fan coils and air handling units to have the maximum flow set exactly at design <b>flow.</b> <b>Switching</b> a traditional control valve to a pressure independent type should not be seen as only benefiting the mechanical contractor, by reducing installation cost. It benefits the systems integrator and most importantly the client, ensuring both improved comfort levels with reduced energy consumption. Pressure independent control valves are {{an essential part of the}} hydronic control in chilled water applications. They are simple to select and easy to set. They enable a steady pressure, a steady flow and most importantly a steady room temperature.|$|E

40|$|Introduction One of the {{principal}} design considerations in a <b>flow</b> <b>switching</b> network {{is the definition of}} a flow. <b>Flow</b> <b>switching</b> uses a network of connection oriented switches that allow flows to be cut-through on their own connection. The granularity of a flow can vary over a wide range from the very fine, for example an individual application level transaction, to the very coarse, such as the aggregated traffic on the next hop between adjacent routing nodes. There are technical trade-offs to be considered together with the constraints of current technology when addressing the question of the appropriate level of aggregation. It appears that all the levels of aggregation have their place in <b>flow</b> <b>switching</b> and that the aggregation level should be a parameter available to network designers for optimization.

40|$|In this study, {{a volume}} of fluid (VOF) model was {{employed}} for microfluidic switch design. The VOF model validity in predicting the interface between fluid streams with different viscosities co-flowing in a microchannel was first verified by experimental observation. It was then extended to microfluidic flow switch design. Two specific flow switches, one with a guided fluid to one of five desired outlet ports, and another with a guided fluid flows into one, two, or three outlet ports equally distributed along the outlet channel of a Y-shaped channel. The <b>flow</b> <b>switching</b> was achieved by controlling the flow rate ratios between tested and buffer fluids. The numerical {{results showed that the}} VOF model could successfully predict the <b>flow</b> <b>switching</b> phenomena in these flow switches.

40|$|Manipulating fluids in {{microchips}} {{remains a}} persistent {{challenge in the}} development of inexpensive and portable point-of-care diagnostic tools. Flow in microfluidic chips can be controlled via frequency tuning, wherein the excitation frequency of a pressure source is matched with the characteristic frequencies of network branches. The characteristic frequencies of each branch arise from coupling between fluid in the channels and passive deformable features, and can be programmed by adjusting the dimensions and stiffness of the features. In contrast to quasi-static ‘on–off’ valves, such networks require only a single active element and relatively small dynamic displacements. To achieve effective <b>flow</b> <b>switching</b> between different pathways in the chip, well-separated peak frequencies and narrow bandwidths are required (such that branches are independently addressable). This paper illustrates that high selectivity can be achieved in fluidic networks that exploit fluidic inertia, with flow driven selectively at peak frequencies between 1 – 100 Hz with bandwidths less than 25 % of the peak frequency. Precise frequency-based <b>flow</b> <b>switching</b> between two on-chip microchannels is demonstrated. A simple theoretical framework is presented that predicts the characteristic frequencies in terms of feature properties, thus facilitating the design of networks with specific activation frequencies. The approach provides a clear pathway to simplification and miniaturization of flow-control hardware for microchips with several fluidic domains...|$|E
40|$|Classical {{two-dimensional}} separations in {{gas chromatography}} (GC) require switching systems {{to transfer the}} flow stream of carrier gas from the first to second dimension. This {{can be accomplished by}} valve systems, but is more suitably effected by pneumatic <b>flow</b> <b>switching,</b> such as the Deans&# 039; switch method. Recent developments in microfluidics and related micro-technologies should make gas phase switching much more effective.

Methods: Bilateral femoral arteriovenous fistulas were placed in baboons to increase the blood flow in the external iliac arteries. At 2 months, the fistula was ligated on one side to restore normal <b>flow</b> (<b>flow</b> <b>switch).</b> Results: In response to <b>flow</b> <b>switch</b> {{and a decrease in}} shear stress, iliac artery lumenal area decreased and SMC proliferation was induced. A decline in NO production, cNOS messenger RNA (mRNA), and protein were associated with these biological effects. In a subset of animals with iliac arteries under high flow, infusion of Nω-nitro-l-arginine, an inhibitor of cNOS, did not induce proliferation. Conclusion: Shear stress can regulate cNOS, vasoconstriction, and SMC proliferation. A decrease in nitric oxide may be necessary, but is not sufficient to induce SMC proliferation in response to a decrease in blood flow. (J Vasc Surg 1998 : 28 : 514 - 21. ...|$|R
