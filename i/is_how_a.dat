5|$|Readers of Aristotle {{have found}} the four causes that he uses in his {{biological}} explanations opaque, something not helped by many centuries of confused exegesis. For a biological system, these are however straightforward enough. The material cause is simply what a system is constructed from. The goal (final cause) and formal cause are what something is for, its function: to a modern biologist, such teleology describes adaptation {{under the pressure of}} natural selection. The efficient cause <b>is</b> <b>how</b> <b>a</b> system moves and develops: to a modern biologist, those are explained by developmental biology and physiology. Biologists continue to offer explanations of these same kinds.|$|E

25|$|In computing, {{a system}} call <b>is</b> <b>how</b> <b>a</b> process {{requests}} a service from an operating system's kernel {{that it does}} not normally have permission to run. System calls provide the interface between a process and the operating system. Most operations interacting with the system require permissions not available to a user level process, e.g. I/O performed with a device present on the system, or any form of communication with other processes requires the use of system calls.|$|E

Moreover, the results reported in the study I’m No Longer Torn After Choice: How Explicit Choices Implicitly Shape Preferences of Odors (2010) contradict such an explanation, by showing the occurrence of revaluation of material items, after the person chose and decided, even after having forgotten the choice.|$|E

25|$|Further, Blanc {{had written}} a book in 1867, which Seurat read the year he began his studies at the École, and which was to {{strongly}} influence him during his formative years—the Grammaire des arts du dessin. Near {{the beginning of this}} book, Blanc had claimed that Nicolas Poussin’s The Finding of Moses was an exemplary case of how art should idealise nature, concluding his passage, ‘This <b>is</b> <b>how</b> <b>a</b> scene from everyday life suddenly becomes raised to the dignity of a history painting.’ This remark seems pertinent to the Bathers, which certainly shares a number of compositional elements with Poussin’s masterpiece of 1638. Both works show to the right a lowered male figure, and to the left a reclining male figure painted from behind. The horizon in both paintings is punctured just off-centre with a head, and in both paintings the river is spanned with a distant bridge, with block-like buildings on the left bank and trees on the other. And both pictures have a flat-bottomed boat at the centre-right.|$|E
25|$|All robots {{contain some}} level of {{computer}} programming code. A program <b>is</b> <b>how</b> <b>a</b> robot decides when or how to do something. In the caterpillar track example, a robot that needs to move across a muddy road may have the correct mechanical construction and receive the correct amount of power from its battery, but would not go anywhere without a program telling it to move. Programs are the core essence of a robot, it could have excellent mechanical and electrical construction, but if its program is poorly constructed its performance will be very poor (or it may not perform at all). There are three different types of robotic programs: remote control, artificial intelligence and hybrid. A robot with remote control programing has a preexisting set of commands that it will only perform if and when it receives a signal from a control source, typically a human being with a remote control. It is perhaps more appropriate to view devices controlled primarily by human commands as falling in the discipline of automation rather than robotics. Robots that use artificial intelligence interact with their environment on their own without a control source, and can determine reactions to objects and problems they encounter using their preexisting programming. Hybrid {{is a form of}} programming that incorporates both AI and RC functions.|$|E

That <b>is</b> <b>how</b> <b>a</b> superior race must behave and the film is a compulsory viewing for the SS." [...] Besides Hitler's enthusiasm, the film also became popular in Nazi Germany where all forms of entertainment were censored.

500|$|Presley and his wife, meanwhile, {{had become}} {{increasingly}} distant, barely cohabiting. In 1971, an affair {{he had with}} Joyce Bova resulted—unbeknownst to him—in her pregnancy and an abortion. He often {{raised the possibility of}} her moving into Graceland, saying that he was likely to leave Priscilla. The Presleys separated on February 23, 1972, after Priscilla disclosed her relationship with Mike Stone, a karate instructor Presley had recommended to her. Priscilla relates that when she told him, Presley [...] "grabbed... and forcefully made love to" [...] her, declaring, [...] "This <b>is</b> <b>how</b> <b>a</b> real man makes love to his woman." [...] Five months later, Presley's new girlfriend, Linda Thompson, a songwriter and one-time Memphis beauty queen, moved in with him. Presley and his wife filed for divorce on August 18. Presley became depressed after the break up of his marriage. According to Joe Moscheo of the Imperials, the failure of Presley's marriage [...] "was a blow from which he never recovered." [...] During a press conference in 1972, a reporter asked Presley {{whether or not he was}} satisfied with his image, Presley replied [...] "Well, the human being is one thing. The image is another.

500|$|Madonna first {{performed}} [...] "Living for Love" [...] at the 57th Annual Grammy Awards on February 8, 2015. She confirmed {{her appearance}} at the ceremony, by uploading {{an image of the}} Grammy trophy wrapped with black strings like the Internet memes for the cover art of Rebel Heart. The singer was dressed in a one-piece outfit in matador red, surrounded by male dancers as Minotaurs similar to the song's music video. It was developed by designer Riccardo Tisci for Givenchy and styled by Akerlund. The performance was described as a [...] "beautiful story for why the matadors fight the bulls and that also reflects life". After being introduced by singers Miley Cyrus and Nicki Minaj, the performance began with images of Madonna on a kabuki screen talking about starting a revolution. She emerged from the screen and started singing, surrounded by the dancers. Near the end, the singer encouraged the audience to sing-along with her, finally being pulled atop the stage on a wire. Dina Gachman from Forbes reported that Madonna's performance was the most-watched moment of the night. Brittany Spanos from Rolling Stone described it as [...] "the legendary singer was out for blood with her first live performance [...] ". Shauna Murphy from MTV News observed Illuminati symbolism with the performance, including rituals, organized religion homage and a metaphor for death. MuuMuse's Bradley Stern listed it as the best performance of the Grammys, saying that [...] "this <b>is</b> <b>how</b> <b>a</b> major pop performance should really look". Her effort to sing live without Auto-Tune during the choreographed performance was also heavily praised.|$|E
500|$|In August, Stefani {{filed for}} divorce from her husband Gavin Rossdale after almost {{thirteen}} years of marriage. In October, Stefani revealed to Entertainment Weekly that she scrapped the album and started again, since [...] "t didn't feel right. [...] I didn't feel fulfilled. That record with Benny was done that way because I had just given birth and had just started on The Voice and felt like I should do something in music, but what was I going to do? There wasn't enough time. So I {{tried to make a}} record where I was just kind of involved—which <b>is</b> <b>how</b> <b>a</b> lot of people do it, but it didn't work for me". She later told Zane Lowe that she had attempted to curate an entire album, but it did not feel right and she needed to write her own material. She also revealed that she felt inspired again and started writing a lot of songs in a rapid progression, revealing: [...] "I think I have enough for probably two albums. [...] I have to write a few more songs, because I feel like, might as well keep going while it's there. [...] I got 20 songs. I have a whole record in eight weeks, but I want to keep writing." [...] Stefani also revealed she had worked with musicians Justin Tranter, Julia Michaels, Greg Kurstin, in addition to production duo Mattman & Robin and the Stargate production team. The album was completed in January 2016. Stefani revealed in an interview with Ellen DeGeneres on February 25 that [...] "'four of five' songs" [...] were written in the previous month.|$|E
