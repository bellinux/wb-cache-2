40|$|Purpose: This {{in vitro}} study {{evaluated}} {{the influence of}} zinc oxide-eugenol temporary cement(ZOE-TC) on the sealing ability of composite restorations using two adhesive systems. Methods: Standard Class V cavities were prepared in 20 bovine incisors and restored with either ZOE-TC (IRM) or eugenol-free cement (Cavit??) (n= 10 /temporary cement type). After 7 days, five teeth per material group were restored using Single Bond(SB) and five using Adper Prompt(AP). The cavities were filled with composite (Filtek Z- 250), thermal cycled (500 cycles),immersed in basic <b>fuchsine</b> <b>solution,</b> and longitudinally sectioned. Dye penetration was evaluated using optical-microscopy and scored. Data were analyzed by Kruskal-Wallis test (P = 0. 05). Results: Overall, leakage in dentin {{was similar to that}} in enamel. In enamel margins, only the group with Cavit cement associated with AP presented significant higher leakage. In dentin margins, AP exhibited higher leakage than the groups restored with SB; {{there was no significant difference}} between eugenol-free cement and ZOE-TC. Conclusion: In general, SB showed better marginal sealing than AP, and ZOE-TC did not increase dye leakage. Eugenol in the temporary cement did not affect the marginal sealing of adhesive restorations...|$|E
40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to {{evaluate}} the influence of thermal stress on the marginal integrity of restorative materials with different adhesive and thermal properties. Three hundred and sixty Class V cavities were prepared in buccal and lingual surfaces of 180 bovine incisors. Cervical and incisal walls were located in dentin and enamel, respectively. Specimens were restored with resin composite (RC); glass ionomer (GI) or amalgam (AM), and randomly assigned to 18 groups (n= 20) according to the material, number of cycles (500 or 1, 000 cycles) and dwell time (30 s or 60 s). Dry and wet specimens served as controls Specimens were immersed in 1 % basic <b>fuchsine</b> <b>solution</b> (24 h), sectioned, and microleakage was evaluated under x 40 magnification. Data were analyzed by Kruskal-Wallis and Mann-Whitney tests: Thermal cycling regimens increased leakage in all AM restorations (p< 0. 05) and its effect on RC and GI restorations was only significant when a 60 -s dwell time was used (p< 0. 05). Marginal integrity was more affected in AM restorations under thermal cycling stress, whereas RC and GI ionomer restoration margins were only significantly affected only under longer dwell times...|$|E
40|$|This {{in vitro}} study {{evaluated}} the marginal gap, cement thickness, and microleakage of glass-ionomer cement (GIC) and phosphate monomer-containing resin cement (MDP-RC) under 2 zirconia crown systems (Cercon and DC-Zirkon). Forty human premolars {{were prepared for}} all-ceramic zirconia crowns with a 1 mm circumferential finish line and a 1. 5 mm occlusal reduction. The crowns (n = 10 per group) from each zirconia system were randomly divided into 2 groups and cemented either with GIC (Vivaglass CEM) or MDP-RC (Panavia F 2. 0) cement. The cemented crowns were thermocycled 5000 times (5 °- 55 °C). The crowns were immersed in 0. 5 % basic <b>fuchsine</b> dye <b>solution</b> for 24 hours and sectioned buccolingually and mesiodistally. Specimens were examined under optical microscope (100 X). Data were analyzed using Student t-test and chi-square tests (α = 0. 05). Mean marginal gap values for Cercon (85 ± 11. 4 μm) {{were significantly higher than}} for DC-Zircon (75. 3 ± 13. 2 μm) (P = 0. 018). The mean cement thickness values of GIC (81. 7 ± 13. 9 μm) and MDP-RC (78. 5 ± 12. 5 μm) were not significantly different (P = 0. 447). Microleakage scores did not demonstrate significant difference between GIC (P = 0. 385) and MDP-RC (P = 0. 631) under Cercon or DC-Zircon. Considering the cement thickness values and microleakage scores obtained, both zirconia crown systems could be cemented in combination with either GIC or MDP-RC...|$|R
40|$|Objectives: The {{purpose of}} this in vitro study was to {{evaluate}} the microleakage in "deep" Class II composite restorations with gingival cavosurface margin below the CEJ (cemento-enamel junction) and restored with different techniques. Study Design: Fifty human teeth were used. In each tooth two standardized Class II slot cavities (on mesial and on distal surfaces) were prepared: the buccolingual extension of the cavities was 4 mm; the gingival wall was located in dentin/cementum (2 mm beyond the CEJ). The prepared teeth {{were randomly assigned to}} 5 experimental groups (of 10 specimens and 20 cavities each) and restored. Group 1 : Filtek TM Supreme XTE Flowable (3 MESPE) + Universal Filtek Supreme XTE (3 MESPE), Group 2 : GrandioSO Heavy Flow (Voco) + GrandioSo (Voco), Group 3 : SDRTm (Dentsply Caulk) + Esthet-X® HD (Dentsply Caulk), Group 4 : SonicFill (Kerr), Group 5 : Grandio (Voco). After thermocycling, the specimens were immersed in a 0. 5 % basic <b>fuchsine</b> dye <b>solution</b> and incubated at 37 °C for 24 hours. The teeth were subsequently sectioned mesiodistally. All specimens were examined at 25 × in a stereomicroscope and standardized digital images were obtained. Dye penetration was measured from gingival margins. Results: The results demonstrated no significant leakage differences between Group 4 and Group 5, that both showed significantly higher frequency distribution of Score 0. Group 2 and Group 3 showed a significant prevalence of Score 1, whereas Group 1 showed significantly higher frequency of Score 2. Conclusions: None of the restorative techniques tested completely eliminated microleakage dye penetration in dentin margins; marginal adaptation in Class II composite restorations with gingival wall below the CEJ varied in both substrates and from different restorative techniques used...|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to {{determine}} the effect of a softstart polymerization method from Quartz-Tungsten-Halogen (QTH) and Plasma Arc (PAC) curing units on microleakage of Class V composite resin restorations with dentin cavosurface margins. Seventy-five bovine incisors received standardized class V cavities in all dentin margins. Teeth were divided into 5 equal groups according to the curing cycle. The cavities were incrementally restored with a composite resin (Single Bond/Z- 100, 3 M). Light curing was applied as follows: Group I: PAC light continuous-cycle curing at 1600 mW/cm² for 3 s; Group II: PAC light step-cycle curing (2 s at 800 mW/cm² then 4 s at 1600 mW/cm²); Group III: QTH light continuous-cycle curing at 400 mW/cm² for 40 s; Group IV: QTH light ramp-cycle curing (from 100 to 600 mW/cm² in 15 s followed by 25 s at 600 mW/cm²); Group V: QTH light pulse-delay curing (200 mW/cm² for 3 s followed by 3 min delay then 600 mW/cm² for 30 s). Teeth were stored in distilled water at 37 ºC for 30 days and then subjected to thermocycling for 500 cycles at 5 and 55 ºC. Root apices were sealed and teeth coated with nail varnish before they were immersed in 0. 5 % <b>fuchsine</b> red dye <b>solution.</b> Teeth were then sectioned and slices were scanned with a computer scanner to determine the area of dye leakage using a computer program (Image Tools). Images of tooth slices were also visually examined under magnification and dye penetration along the tooth/restoration interface was scored. Significant differences in the degree of dye penetration and leakage were detected between groups (p<. 05). Groups I and II had significantly higher values of dye penetration and leakage than groups III, IV and V. In conclusion, the use of PAC light curing in a continuous or step cycle modes resulted in increased microleakage of Class V resin composite restorations compared with medium intensity QTH light curing. Pulse, ramp and continuous-cycle curing modes with QTH light resulted in similar degrees of microleakage...|$|R

40|$|Introduction: Sealing {{pits and}} {{fissures}} was introduced as {{an approach to}} prevent occlusal caries {{for more than two}} decades. The aim {{of this study was to}} compare the microleakage of flow able resin reinforced glass ionomer (Ionoseal) with other materials used as fissure sealants. Methods: In this in vitro study, 50 premolar teeth of human free of any caries were selected. Fissurotomy was done with fissure bur. The samples were randomly categorized into five groups (Fissurit FX, Fuji II light-cured,Grandio flow, Ionoseal). Ionoseal was assessed by using two methods: with and without etching and bonding agent prior to sealant application. After sealant placement, all surfaces of the teeth except 2 mm area around the sealant margins were covered with two layers of nail polish. The specimens were thermocycled, and they were sectioned after immersing into a 0. 5 % basic <b>fuchsine</b> <b>solution.</b> The amount of microleakage was examined by stereomicroscope. Results: The microleakage comparisons of groups indicated that Ionoseal without etching and bonding application had significantly greater microleakage than the other groups (p 0. 05). Conclusions: By considering isolation difficulties in children and observing high amount of Ionoseal microleakage (without etching and bonding application), the samples need to be etched and bonded like other resin-based materials before Ionoseal placement in order to achieve clinically desirable microleakage outcomes...|$|E
40|$|To {{evaluate}} {{the influence of}} two resin cements on microleakage of ceromer inlays. Methods Twenty recently extracted human third molars were selected. Standard inlay mesio-occluso-distal cavities were prepared, with cervical margin in enamel (mesial) or dentin (distal). The specimens were randomly {{divided into two groups}} (n= 10) and indirect restorations were made with Belleglass HP system (Kerr, Romulus, MI, USA). The cavities in the first group were treated with adhesive system Single Bond and restorations were cemented with dual curing cement RelyX ARC (3 M ESPE, St. Paul, MN, USA). In the second group, the ED Primer (Kuraray, Tokyo, Japan) was applied and indirect restorations were cemented with Panavia 21 EX (Kuraray, Tokyo, Japan). The specimens were coated with varnish, except for the restorations and 1 mm around them and submitted to thermal cycling and then immersed in 2 % basic <b>fuchsine</b> <b>solution</b> for 24 hours. Teeth were sectioned longitudinally and leakage scores were evaluated using a stereomicroscope at 40 x magnification. Data were submitted to statistical analysis (Mann-Whitney test). Results Enamel showed lower dye penetration than dentin (p< 0. 05). Statistical difference between cements was only observed in enamel, with RelyX exhibiting less leakage (p< 0. 05). Conclusion Within the limitations of the study, the substrate had a significant effect for sealing ability and RelyX ARC performed better than Panavia 21 EX only in enamel...|$|E
40|$|Objective: Microleakage is a {{major factor}} {{affecting}} longevity of composite restorations. This study evaluated the effect of polymerization mode of bonding agent on microleakage of composite restorations. Materials and Methods: Forty-eight Class V cavities were prepared on buccal and lingual surfaces of 24 extracted human premolars. Occlusal and gingival margins were placed in the enamel and dentin, respectively. Teeth were divided into four groups as follows: Group I: Optibond Solo Plus (light-cured); Group II: Optibond Solo Plus (dual-cured); Group III: Prime & Bond NT (light-cured), Group IV: Prime & Bond NT (dual-cured). Teeth were restored using Z 250 composite in three increments. After polishing the restorations, samples were thermocycled for 1000 cycles and stored in distilled water for 3 months. Then they were placed in 2 % <b>fuchsine</b> <b>solution</b> for 48 hours. The samples were sectioned longitudinally and evaluated for microleakage under a stereomicroscope at × 40 magnification. Dye penetration was scored on a 0 - 3 ordinal scale. Data were analyzed using Kruskal-Wallis, Bonferroni and Wilcoxon signed ranks test. Results: Microleakage was significantly lower in enamel margins compared to dentin margins (P 0. 05). Prime & Bond NT had less microleakage compared to Optibond SoloPlus, but the difference was not significant (P> 0. 05). Conclusion: There was no difference in the amount of microleakage in Class V composite restorations using light-cured and dual-cured bonding systems. Dentinal margins of restorations exhibited more microleakage than enamel margins...|$|E
40|$|The present {{investigation}} observed the sealing ability of low shrinkage composite resins in large and deep cavities, placed and photocured in one increment. Large, deep cavities (5. 0 mm diameter and 2. 5 mm deep) surrounded by enamel were prepared in bovine teeth, {{which were then}} divided into five groups. Groups 1, 2, 3 and 4 : acid conditioning + Adper Single Bond (3 M/ESPE, St Paul, MN, USA) and restoration with Aelite LS Posterior (BISCO Inc. Schaumburg, IL, USA) (G 1); Filtek Z- 350 (3 M/ESPE,St Paul, MN, USA) (G 2); Filtek Z- 350 Flow (3 M/ESPE, St Paul, MN, USA) (G 3); Premisa (KERR Corporation, Orange, CA, USA) (G 4). Group 5 : Silorane Adhesive system (3 M/ESPE, St Paul, MN, USA) + restoration with Filtek Low Shrinkage Posterior P 90 (3 M/ESPE, St Paul, MN, USA). After polymerization, the teeth were immersed in 0. 5 % basic <b>fuchsine</b> <b>solution</b> and immediately washed. Using the Imagetool Software, the extent of dye along the margins was calculated {{as a percentage of}} total perimeter. The restorations were then transversally sectioned and the depth of dye penetration was calculated in mm, using the same software. Kruskal-Wallis analysis for all groups showed no statistical differences for extent (p = 0. 54) or depth (p = 0. 8364) of dye penetration.

40|$|Background: Marginal leakage is the {{important}} factor influencing the maintenance of dental esthetic. Aim: The {{purpose of this study}} was to evaluate the relationship between the preparation techniques and type of polymerization techniques on microleakage of composite laminate veneers. Materials and Methods: Ninety-one same sized, caries-free human maxillary central incisors were randomly assigned to 13 groups (n = 7) and were designed with four different preparation techniques (window type, feather type, bevel type, and incisal overlap type). One group determined as control group and any preparation was applied. Nanohybrid resin composite was used for restoration. Composite laminate veneers polymerized with three different techniques (direct light curing, indirect polymerization with a combination of pressure, light and heat using a light cup and heat cup, direct polymerization, and additionally heat cured in an oven). The specimens were thermocycled, and then immersed in 5 % basic <b>fuchsine</b> <b>solution.</b> Following 24 h, all specimens were immersed in 65 % nitric acid solutions for volumetric dye extraction test. Samples diluted with distilled water and centrifuged and microleakage determined by a spectrophotometer. Statistical Analysis Used: Data were analyzed with two-way ANOVA and Tukey honest significant difference post hoc multiple comparisons test (P < 0. 05). Results: For comparing the microleakage value of preparation and polymerization techniques, Window type preparation showed a significant difference in direct polymerization + additional cured group (P < 0. 05). Control group was statistically different from the other groups (P < 0. 05). Conclusions: Window type laminate preparation can be preferred in indirect polymerization technique because it caused less leakage in this present study...|$|E
40|$|AbstractObjectiveThe {{purpose of}} this study is to {{investigate}} the effect of three resin cements on the adaptation of CEREC III (Ceramic Reconstruction) and to measure the degree of microleakage between resin cement and tooth structure and also between resin cement and CEREC III restorations which fabricated by using CAD/CAM system and luting them at the same time. Materials and methodsTwenty-four cavities were prepared (Inlay) on the mesial-occlusal-distal surfaces of twenty-four human freshly extracted premolars. CEREC III (Sirona) is used to prepare ceramic restorations by milling blocs (Vita Blocs Esthetic Line for CEREC/inlab German made) with 1 M 1 shade and K 12. Suitable Ceramic restorations for cavities were obtained. All samples of ceramic restorations were divided into three groups and were cemented with three types of luting resin cement as the following: Bistite II DC, Perma Flo DC and Multilink Automix, then the Plasma Arc light cure unit was used to cure cement. All restorations were finished and immersed in 0. 5 % basic <b>fuchsine</b> <b>solution</b> for 24 h. The specimens were cut in the mesio-distal direction and then evaluated for microleakage. ResultsThe data were analyzed using chi-square statistical test with significance 0. 05. A relationship between the degree of microleakage and the type of cement at interface tooth structure/luting cement has been found. No statistical difference was found between the type of cement and microleakage degree at interface luting cement/CEREC III restoration. ConclusionIt was concluded that the degree of microleakage at interface CEREC III restoration/resin cement was less than microleakage at interface resin cement/tooth structure...|$|E
40|$|Background and Aim: Novel dental {{materials}} including nanocomposites {{have been}} introduced in recent years. It is claimed that they have superior properties such as high esthetic., low wear, increased filler content resulting in better mechanical properties, and releasing ions i. e. fluoride and amorphous calcium phosphate that are important for enamel remineralization. Considering these features, if they have retention and microleakage rates comparable with conventional sealants, these materials can be appropriate alternatives to conventional resin sealants in future. The current study aimed at comparing. microleakage of a flowable nanocomposite, a flowable composite, and a conventional sealant in fissure sealant therapy of the permanent teeth. Materials and Methods: First of all, 42 extracted sound human maxillary first premolars were collected and were randomly divided into 3 equal groups. Then the teeth were embedded in self-cure acrylic resin. Occlusal fissures of the samples were cleaned using explorer, enameloplasty with &frac 14; round diamond bur and water/air spray was done. The prepared surfaces were etched using 36 % phosphoric acid gel for 15 s, rinsed and dried. Bonding agent {{was placed in the}} pits and fissures, cured for 10 s after thinning with air. In the first, second, and the third group conventional sealant, flowable composite, and flowable nanocomposite were placed, respectively; and light cured for 40 s. The samples were thermocycled (1000 cycles between 5 - 55 ºC) and then immersed in 2 % basic <b>Fuchsine</b> <b>solution</b> for 24 hs. They were then cut bucculingually and microleakage evaluation was done using stereomicroscope. The obtained data was analyzed using Kruskal wallis tests. Results: There {{was no significant difference in}} microleakage rate of the study groups. (P> 0. 05). Conclusion: Considering the condition of the study, it can be concluded that flowable composite and flowable nanocomposite can be used as suitable alternatives to conventional sealants in fissure sealant therapy of the permanent teeth...|$|E
