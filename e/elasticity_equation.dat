The contact problem is arranged as one full system of equations [2] - including Reynolds equation with cavitation condition, <b>elasticity</b> <b>equation</b> and force balance [...] and solved directly. The full system is solved iteratively by a Newton method with an active set procedure accounting for the unilateral constraints related to the chosen cavitation model. The reduction procedure is executed {{not only on the}} linear part representing the <b>elasticity</b> <b>equation</b> of the EHD contact problem [3] but also on the strongly nonlinear and parametric part given by the Reynolds equation. To cope with the cavitation condition within the reduced system, the cavitational area is separated from the computational area and the boundary between those two areas is adapted iteratively. Furthermore the costs of constructing the reduced system are cut by approximating the reduced system function and its J acobian using only a few distinguished nodes We will investigate accuracy and eﬂiciency of the partially reduced system (only linear part), the fully reduced system and the fully reduced system with system approximation (SA) compared to the full system...|$|E

40|$|When the <b>equations</b> {{of linear}} <b>elasticity</b> are solved by the {{standard}} Galerkin method the equations become stiff for nearly incompressible materials. This results in a per-turbed numerical approximation. To avoid this problem a well known technique em-ploys a saddle-point formulation of the equations.

The original second order <b>elasticity</b> <b>equations</b> are rewritten as a first order system and the least-squares functional arises from this system. Numerical examples are presented to show the difference between this method and the Galerkin method.

40|$|Interface {{problems}} occur frequently {{when two}} or more materials meet. Solving <b>elasticity</b> <b>equations</b> with sharp-edged interfaces in three dimensions is a very complicated and challenging problem for most existing methods. There are several difficulties: the coupled elliptic system, the matrix coefficients, the sharp-edged interface, and three dimensions. An accurate and efficient method is desired. In this paper, an efficient nontraditional finite element method with nonbody-fitting grids is proposed to solve <b>elasticity</b> <b>equations</b> with sharp-edged interfaces in three dimensions. The main idea is to choose the test function basis to be the standard finite element basis independent of the interface and to choose the solution basis to be piecewise linear satisfying the jump conditions across the interface. The resulting linear system of equations is shown to be positive definite under certain assumptions. Numerical experiments show that this method is second order accurate in the L∞ norm for piecewise smooth solutions. More than 1. 5 th order accuracy is observed for solution with singularity (second derivative blows up) ...|$|R

40|$|Elastic {{materials}} are ubiquitous {{in nature and}} indispensable components in man-made devices and equipments. When a device or equipment involves composite or multiple elastic materials, elasticity interface problems come into play. The solution of three dimensional (3 D) elasticity interface problems is significantly more difficult than that of elliptic counterparts due to the coupled vector components and cross derivatives in the governing <b>elasticity</b> <b>equation.</b> This work introduces the matched interface and boundary (MIB) method for solving 3 D elasticity interface problems. The proposed MIB method utilizes fictitious values on irregular grid points near the material interface to replace function values in the discretization so that the <b>elasticity</b> <b>equation</b> can be discretized using the standard finite difference schemes {{as if there were}} no material interface. The interface jump conditions are rigorously enforced on the intersecting points between the interface and the mesh lines. Such an enforcement determines the fictitious values. A number of new technique are developed to construct efficient MIB schemes for dealing with cross derivative in coupled governing equations. The proposed method is extensively validated over both weak and strong discontinuity of the solution, both piecewise constant and position-dependent material parameters, both smooth and nonsmooth interface geometries, and both small and large contrasts in the Poisson's ratio and shear modulus across the interface. Numerical experiments indicate that the present MIB method is of second order convergence in both L_∞ and L_ 2 error norms. Comment: 40 pages, 23 page...|$|E
