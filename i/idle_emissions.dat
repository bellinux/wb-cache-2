The program included a biennial and change of ownership testing, [...] "BAR 84" [...] <b>idle</b> <b>emissions</b> test plus a visual and functional inspection of various emission control components, a $50 repair cost limit, licensing shops to perform smog checks and mechanic certification for emissions repair competence. The program is generally known as “BAR 84” program. During the BAR 84 program, the first acceleration simulation mode (ASM) test was implemented which tests for 2 gases, HC and CO (hydrocarbons and carbon monoxide). Motor vehicles from the 1966 model year and beyond were subjected to Smog Check I. Also automobiles with a motor swap performed prior to the March 19, 1984 mandate which was older than the model year of the vehicle e.g. a 1970 LT-1 350 swapped into a 1975 Chevrolet with the 1970 smog gear intact (with documentation e.g. receipts) are considered noncompliant illegal engine swaps - this means that the engine swap performed after the date of enactment must be the same model year or newer. Engine swaps which are the same year or newer where the vehicle class did not have it as a manufacturer option (from a Chevrolet S-10 with a late model LSx powertrain transplant with the associated smog gear intact salvaged from the donor vehicle which includes the OBDII diagnostic connections) must be approved by a 'referee' smog test station where the engine/transmission package is certified where a silver tag is stickered to the door jamb. Although the engine may be newer than the vehicle model year even with an OBDII upgrade the automobile must be tested based on the model year using the test criteria based on the VIN and registration.|$|E

40|$|In {{order to}} {{maintain}} cab comfort truck drivers have to idle their engine to obtain the required power for accessories, such as the air conditioner, heater, television, refrigerator, and lights. This idling of the engine has {{a major impact on}} its fuel consumption and exhaust <b>emission.</b> <b>Idling</b> <b>emissions</b> can be as high as 86. 4 g/h, 16, 500 g/h, 5130 g/h, 4 g/h, and 375 g/h for HC, CO 2, CO, PM, and NOx, respectively. Idling fuel consumption rate can be as high as 1. 85 gal/h. The accessory loading, truck model, fuel-injection system, ambient temperature, idling speed, etc., also affect significantly the emission levels and fuel consumption rate. An increase in accessory loading and ambient temperature increases the emissions and fuel consumption. During idling, electronic fuel-injection systems reduce HC, PM, and CO emission, but increase NOx emissions compared with a mechanical fuel-injection system. An increase of idling speed increases fuel consumption rate. There are many systems available on the market to reduce engine idling and improve air quality and fuel consumption rate, such as an auxiliary power unit (APU), truck stop electrification, thermal storage systems, fuel cells, and direct fire heaters. A direct fire heater reduces fuel consumption by 94 - 96 % and an APU reduces consumption by 60 - 87 %.

Technology improvements such as electronic engine management, adoption of four valves per cylinder, variable valve timing, direct injection of petrol/Gasoline and diesel, hybrid power, and smoother, more powerful diesel engines with very high pressure electronic injection, have dramatically improved fuel economy and performance. The latest technologies to improve efficiency are engine downsizing and automatic engine stop-start. Automatic engine stop-start systems like VWs BlueMotion, shut the engine down when the car is stopped to reduce <b>idling</b> <b>emissions</b> and boost economy, and it is now mandatory not to idle unnecessarily in cities in Germany. It is an updated version of the 1980s VW 'Formel E' system that was developed into the 1990s VW 'Ecomatic' system. The application of turbo-charging to down-sized engines is one way to achieve efficiency benefits into fuel economy and emission benefits instead of for performance. The recent Fiat 'Multiair' system, is an electro-hydraulic development of variable valve timing that allows the engine management computer to control valve timing, improving engine efficiency, giving better torque, power, economy, and emissions. Safety design is a particular challenge in a small, lightweight car. This is an area where Renault has been particularly successful.

In this study {{the effects of}} traffic signal coordination on fuel cost and gas emissions were investigated by comparing the amount of idling time on streets with coordinated signals to those with uncoordinated signals during the off peak period. It was found that signal coordination can reduce the idling fuel cost by more than 25 cents per kilometre in the CBDs. The possible reductions in <b>idling</b> gas <b>emissions</b> were found to be 80 % for CO 2 and 77 % for both CO and HC. These are significant reductions if the whole CBD network and all the vehicles within the network per annum are taken in to account.

40|$|The {{depletion}} {{of fossil fuels}} together with growing environmental concerns have created incitement for developing a more energy-efficient and environmentally-friendly vehicle fleet. The development towards cleaner heavy-duty vehicles started already in the 80 ’s {{with the introduction of}} emission legislations. Initially, engine optimization was enough for reaching the legislated levels of emissions. However, at present engine optimization is not enough but exhaust aftertreatment has become an essential part of heavy-duty vehicles, {{in order to meet the}} emission standards. Today, the total emissions are targeted which means that there is an interest in decreasing the <b>idling</b> <b>emissions</b> as well as the emissions during operation. To reduce the overall emissions several states in the USA have introduced idling legislations. Due to the limitations in idling time alternative solutions for power generation during rests are requested. A possible alternative is a fuel cell auxiliary power unit, combining a fuel cell with a fuel reformer (FC-APU).   The focus of this thesis is the development of the fuel reformer for an FC-APU, in which the hydrogen to the fuel cell is generated from diesel in a high-temperature catalytic process. The produced hydrogen can also be used in other heavy-duty vehicle applications i. e. selective catalytic reduction of NOx (HC-SCR), where addition of hydrogen is essential for reaching high conversion at low temperatures. The effect of using hydrogen from a fuel reformer in HC-SCR is included in this work. The catalytic material development is focused on developing promoted materials with lower rhodium content but with catalytic activity comparable to that of materials with higher rhodium content. This includes evaluation and extensive characterization of both fresh and aged promoted materials. The work also includes reactor design where a micro reactor with multiple air inlets is evaluated. This work has contributed to increased knowledge of catalytic materials suitable for reforming of diesel. By changing the support material from the traditionally used alumina to ceria-zirconia, increased H 2 yield was achieved. In addition, the ceria-zirconia supported material was less prone to coke. By promoting the material with cobalt or lanthanum it was possible to decrease the rhodium content by 2 / 3 with enhanced catalytic performance. It was also discovered that promotion with lanthanum decreased the tendency for coking even further. Additionally, the lanthanum-promoted material had higher thermal stability as well as a stable highly dispersed rhodium phase. Furthermore, the work has contributed to an increased knowledge concerning the fuel reformer’s effect on HC-SCR. The work displays clear evidence of benefits with using hydrogen-rich gas from a fuel reformer instead of pure hydrogen. The benefits are derived from the content of low molecular weight hydrocarbons present in the hydrogen-rich gas, which are strong reducing agents increasing the NOx reduction. This finding proves that fuel reforming in combination with HC-SCR is a viable option for NOx abatement. QC 20150202 </p...|$|R
