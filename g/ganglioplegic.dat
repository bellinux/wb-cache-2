2500|$|Pancuronium is {{a typical}} non-depolarizing curare-mimetic muscle relaxant. It {{competitively}} inhibits the nicotinic acetylcholine receptor at the neuromuscular junction by blocking the binding of acetylcholine. It has slight vagolytic activity, causing an increase in heart rate, [...] but no <b>ganglioplegic</b> (i.e., blocking ganglions) activity. It is a very potent muscle relaxant drug, with an ED95 (i.e., the dose that causes 95% depression of muscle twitch response) of only 60µg/kg body weight. Onset of action is relatively slow compared to other similar drugs, {{in part due to}} its low dose - an intubating dose takes 3–6 minutes for full effect. Clinical effects (muscle activity lower than 25% of physiological) last for about 100 minutes. The time needed for full (over 90% muscle activity) recovery after single administration is about 120–180 minutes in healthy adults.|$|E
50|$|A ganglionic blocker (or <b>ganglioplegic)</b> {{is a type}} of {{medication}} that inhibits transmission between preganglionic and postganglionic neurons in the Autonomic Nervous System, often by acting as a nicotinic receptor antagonist. Nicotinic acetylcholine receptors are found on skeletal muscle, but also within the route of transmission for the parasympathetic and sympathetic nervous system (which together comprise the autonomic nervous system). More specifically, nicotinic receptors are found within the ganglia of the autonomic nervous system, allowing outgoing signals to be transmitted from the presynaptic to the postsynaptic cells. Thus, for example, blocking nicotinic acetylcholine receptors blocks both sympathetic (excitatory) and parasympathetic (calming) stimulation of the heart. The nicotinic antagonist hexamethonium, for example, does this by blocking the transmission of outgoing signals across the autonomic ganglia at the postsynaptic nicotinic acetylcholine receptor.|$|E

40|$|T he {{adverse effects}} of smoking onthe {{cardiovascular}} system have beenstudied both in extensive epidemio-logical studies and on a basic research le-vel. The conclusions of these studies are in such close agreement that smoking has been identified by the American Heart Association (AHA) as the most signifi-cant modifiable risk factor of coronary artery disease in the USA 1. One of the mechanisms by which smoking impairs the cardiovascular fun-ction is its effect on Autonomic Nervous System (ANS) control 2 - 4. Out of all the biologically active substances detected in cigarettes and tobacco products, nicotine, tar and carbon monoxide have been most widely studied. Nicotine acts as an ago-nist of nicotine receptors in the central and peripheral nervous system exerting a <b>ganglioplegic</b> effect and causing suppres-sion of vagal (predominantly) and sympa-thetic control. However in the latter the-re {{seems to be a}} direct enhancing effect at the central nuclei level resulting in an overall increase of sympathetic tone.

40|$|AIM: A brief {{survey is}} given of the {{development}} of the drug therapy of essential hypertension over five decades, followed by a discussion on newer antihypertensive drugs and principles. DRUGS THAT MODULATE THE SYMPATHETIC NERVOUS SYSTEM: Virtually all levels and elements of the sympathetic nervous system can be modulated by drugs in such a manner that elevated blood pressure is lowered, for instance with the use of central alpha 2 -adrenoceptor agonists (clonidine, alpha-methyldopa), <b>ganglioplegic</b> drugs, peripheral adrenergic neurone blockers, and alpha- and beta-adrenoceptor antagonists. The beta-blockers have been maintained as a very major group of antihypertensive therapeutics. Among alpha-adrenoceptor antagonists, only the selective alpha 1 -blockers are useful as antihypertensive drugs, although some interest has developed in newer alpha 2 -adrenoceptor antagonists which are selective for postsynaptic alpha 2 -adrenoceptors. DIURETICS: Diuretics, in spite of some criticism, are still a cornerstone in antihypertensive drug treatment. Their position has been reinforced by the results of the recent Systolic Hypertension in the Elderly Program, Swedish Trial in Old Patients with Hypertension and Medical Research Council (Elderly) trials. CALCIUM ANTAGONISTS: Calcium antagonists have been extended by several new dihydropyridines which appear to be more vasoselective than the classical compounds. ANGIOTENSIN CONVERTING ENZYME (ACE) INHIBITORS: Various new ACE inhibitors have been introduced, but so far they have not clearly offered major advantages over the established compounds. NEW POTENTIAL ANTIHYPERTENSIVE DRUGS: Renin inhibitors and angiotensin II-receptor antagonists are being studied for their potential as antihypertensive drugs and they are also important because they may modulate the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system. Inhibitors of neutral endopeptidase will cause an accumulation of endogenous atrial natriuretic peptide, and hence lower blood pressure by counteracting several effects of the renin-angiotensin-system. Potassium channel openers are vasodilators and potential antihypertensive drugs with additional anti-ischaemic activit...|$|E
40|$|There is {{no doubt}} that the {{sympathetic}} nervous system (SNS) plays an important role in the pathogenesis and maintenance of hypertensive disease, although many details concerning this association remain to be clarified. Over the years, several types of antihypertensive drugs have been developed that can impair SNS activity at virtually all levels of the system. Alpha and beta-adrenoceptor antagonists, postganglionic sympathetic neuron blockers and <b>ganglioplegic</b> agents are well-known examples of drugs with a predominantly peripheral activity. The CNS regulation of peripheral sympathetic activity offers a further possibility to counteract the influence of SNS activity. In particular, central catecholaminergic neurons and alpha-adrenoceptors have been analyzed in detail and are recognized as important targets for the classic centrally acting antihypertensives clonidine, guanfacine, and alpha-methyldopa. Initially, these drugs were assumed to reduce elevated blood pressure via the stimulation of central alpha-adrenoceptors in the brainstem, thus leading to peripheral sympathoinhibition and a reduction of elevated blood pressure, heart rate, and plasma catecholamines. In a later stage it has been recognized that central imidazoline (I 1) receptors may also be involved in the central regulation of peripheral sympathetic activity and that they act as a target for centrally acting antihypertensives. Moxonidine and rilmenidine are the prototypes of such agents. Accordingly, the receptor profile of the various types of centrally acting antihypertensives can be characterized as follows: alpha-methyl-DOPA (through alpha-methyl-norepinephrine) alpha 2; clonidine (mixed agonist), alpha 2 + I 1; moxonidine, rilmenidine, I 1 > alpha 2. The various compounds mentioned will thus cause peripheral sympathoinhibition, initiated by different receptor targets in the CNS. Because most of the adverse reactions to clonidine and related drugs are mediated by central alpha-adrenoceptors, is is hoped that the imidazoline receptor agonists (moxonidine, rilmenidine) will show a more favorable pattern of side effect...|$|E
40|$|Starting {{from the}} {{structure}} of an old 4 -oxystilbene derivate with <b>ganglioplegic</b> activity (MG 624), we synthesized two further derivates (F 2 and F 3) and two stereoisomers of F 3 (F 3 A and F 3 B), and studied their selective effect on neuronal nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (AChR) subtypes. MG 624, F 3, F 3 A and F 3 B inhibited of 125 I-αBungarotoxin (αBgtx) binding to neuronal chick optic lobe (COL) membranes, with nM affinity, but inhibited 125 I-αBgtx binding to TE 671 cell-expressed muscle-type AChR only at much higher concentrations. We immobilized the α 7, β 2 and β 4 containing chick neuronal nicotinic AChR subtypes using anti-subunit specific antibodies. MG 624, F 3, F 3 A and F 3 B inhibited 125 I-αBgtx binding to the α 7 -containing receptors with nM affinity, but inhibited 3 H-Epi binding to β 2 -containing receptors only at very high concentrations (more than 35 [*]μM); their affinity for the β 4 -containing receptors was ten times more than for the β 2 -containing subtype. Both MG 624 and F 3 compounds inhibited the ACh evoked currents in homomeric oocyte-expressed chick α 7 receptors with an IC 50 of respectively 94 and 119 [*]nM. High doses of both MG 624 and F 3 depressed the contractile response to vagus nerve stimulation in guinea pig nerve-stomach preparations although at different IC 50 s (49. 4 vs 166. 2 [*]μM) The effect of MG 624 on rat nerve-hemidiaphragm preparations was 33 times less potent than that of F 3 (IC 50 486 vs 14. 5 [*]μM). In conclusion, MG 624 and F 3 have {{a high degree of}} antagonist selectivity for neuronal nicotinic αBgtx receptors containing the α 7 subunit...|$|E
