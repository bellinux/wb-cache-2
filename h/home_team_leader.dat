40|$|The International Thermonuclear Experimental Reactor (ITER) {{project is}} unique in that the work is divided among an {{international}} Joint Central Team and four Home Teams, with the overall responsibility {{for the quality of}} activities performed during the project residing with the ITER Director. The ultimate responsibility for the adequacy of work performed on tasks assigned to the U. S. Home Team resides with the U. S. <b>Home</b> <b>Team</b> <b>Leader</b> and the U. S. Department of Energy Office of Fusion Energy (DOE-OFE). This document constitutes the quality assurance plan for the ITER U. S. Home Team. This plan describes the controls exercised by U. S. Home Team management and the Performing Institutions to ensure the quality of tasks performed and the data developed for the Engineering Design Activities assigned to the U. S. Home Team and, in particular, the Research and Development Large Projects (7). This plan addresses the DOE quality assurance requirements of 10 CFR 830. 120, "Quality Assurance. " The plan also describes U. S. Home Team quality commitments to the ITER Quality Assurance Program. The ITER Quality Assurance Program is based on the principles described in the International Atomic Energy Agency Standard No. 50 -C-QA, "Quality Assurance for Safety in Nuclear Power Plants and Other Nuclear Facilities. " Each commitment is supported with preferred implementation methodology that will be used in evaluating the task quality plans to be submitted by the Performing Institutions. The implementing provisions of the program are based on guidance provided in American National Standards Institute/American Society of Mechanical Engineers NQA- 1 1994, "Quality Assurance. " The individual Performing Institutions will implement the appropriate quality program provisions through their own established quality plans that have been reviewed and found to comply with U. S. Home Team quality assurance plan commitments to the ITER Quality Assurance Program. The extent of quality program provisions applied to any specific task is proportional to, and appropriate for, the safety and/or project success significance of the task, as determined by the cognizant Technical Manager and the U. S. Home Team Quality Coordinator. In general, the research and development activities will have only those controls appropriate to ensure the quality of the manufacturing activity and validate the resultant data...|$|E

(The United States of America was an ITER Party until September 30 th 1999). The activities are conducted {{under the auspices}} of the IAEA by the ITER Joint Central Team and by the <b>Home</b> <b>Teams</b> (HT). The JCT is composed of qualified persons made available by each of the Parties in approximately equal numbers. The JCT members are located at the ITER Joint Work Sites (JWS) in Naka (Japan), Garching (Germany), and formerly in San Diego (USA). The <b>Home</b> <b>Teams</b> are established and organized by each Party for performing the tasks of the work programme for the EDA, assigned to them in approximately equal shares. <b>Home</b> <b>Teams</b> in each of the Parties perform specific design tasks, and perform research and development in technology (physics R&D is contributed voluntarily). The <b>Home</b> <b>Team</b> <b>Leaders</b> (HTL) are responsible to the Director for the execution of tasks. All activities are directed and supervised by the ITER Council (IC). The ITER Technical Advisory Committee (TAC), upon request of the Council, advises it on technical matters.

40|$|In {{the current}} study, the {{relative}} importance of different resources for psychological resilience of service members is investigated. The study employs a model of psychological resilience developed for the Netherlands Armed Forces, which identifies 25 resources for resilience at 5 different levels (individual, <b>home</b> front, <b>team,</b> <b>leader,</b> organization). To assess {{the relative importance}} of 5 of these resources (one for each of the levels), measured pre and during military deployment, in predicting psychological resilience post deployment, regression analyses were conducted on data collected from three Dutch Task Forces part of the NATO mission ISAF. Results indicated that {{the relative importance of}} the resources differed pre and during deployment. The most important pre deployment resources for post-deployment resilience (operationalized as the absence of fatigue complaints) were self-efficacy, home front support, leadership, and information provision by the organization. During deployment group cohesion became the most important resource whereas information provision did no longer predict post-deployment resilience. These analyses illustrate that the relative importance of resources at different organizational levels varies with the phases of the operational cycle. This knowledge can be used to decide which resources should be targeted at what moment to get the maximum return on investment...|$|R

The board was also infuriated by the contestants not owning up to the task they were doing. The board determined that the team lost because of poor message delivery, a task done by Roy Muriuki who was in charge of creative thus he had to go. The board also decided that Sylvanus was in charge of Market briefing as well as defining the target market which led to them losing the task.

40|$|This paper {{focuses on}} the {{performance}} of IDB projects between 1996 and 2011 disbursements. We present evidence on the evolution of disbursements with respect to the available funds and the evolution of disbursements with respect to the historic disbursement curve of IDB projects. We also identify the main factors driving disbursements. Our findings show that disbursements improved in the last 10 years; in particular, they improved after the organizational changes instituted after 2006. With respect to the factors driving disbursements, we find that: (i) Country is more important than sector in understanding performance. (ii) Most of the remaining variance in project performance can be explained by variance within each country. (iii) The <b>team</b> <b>leader</b> {{plays an important role in}} understanding project performance. (iv) The effect of <b>team</b> <b>leader</b> location on disbursement performance has not been constant over time. The effect is negative for projects approved after 1996. However, if we focus on projects approved after 2009 the effect is positive. This result also provides evidence on the success of the organizational changes undertaken after 2006. (v) Projects that underwent a change in <b>team</b> <b>leader</b> show an improvement in performance after one year of the change. (vi) <b>Team</b> <b>leader</b> characteristics related to the experience or seniority of the <b>team</b> <b>leader</b> are non-significant, though in the expected direction. <b>Team</b> <b>leader</b> may be pointing to other non-observable characteristics of the individual or characteristics of the larger team that supports that <b>team</b> <b>leader</b> in execution and supervision of the project.

40|$|One of the {{important}} elements in building effective teamwork is <b>team</b> <b>leader</b> selection. In a team, leadership {{is the most significant}} role which contributes to the success of a software project. During <b>team</b> <b>leader</b> selection, there are several criteria that should be considered for decision makers. With regard to this problem, selecting <b>team</b> <b>leader</b> can be considered as Multi Criteria Decision Making (MCDM) problem. One of the most popular techniques of MCDM that can be employed in selecting the suitable <b>team</b> <b>leader</b> is Analytical Hierarchy Process (AHP). AHP techniques consists of three key principles which are hierarchy framework, priority analysis and consistency verification. Thus, this paper presents AHP steps to select suitable <b>team</b> <b>leader</b> based on four criteria which are personality type, academic achievement, teamwork experience, and previous programming grade. Result illustrates that AHP technique can assist decision maker to effectively evaluate the alternatives in order to select suitable <b>team</b> <b>leader,</b> particularly for Software Engineering (SE) education community...|$|R
40|$|This {{research}} {{sought out}} {{to establish the}} extent to which first line managers - <b>team</b> <b>leaders,</b> supervisors, foremen - are considered part o f the management structure and. therefore, carry the attendant responsibilities. Secondly, the research aimed to ascertain whether supervisors are adequately developed and prepared to effectively manage all aspects of the workplace. To achieve these aims, the researcher studied the roles played by first line managers, and the attitudes of middle managers and shopfloor employees towards first line managers. So too. the competencies required b first line managers for effective workplace management were studied. The research was a case study conducted at Amalgamated Beverages Industries (ABI). Interviews were conducted with the following people: » the Human Resources Manager who provided information on the changes that had taken place in the company: • the Training Manager who gave insight into training attended by team leaders: and • the employees who offered their views on die role of <b>team</b> <b>leader.</b> <b>Team</b> <b>leaders</b> and middle managers completed a questionnaire on various issues such as the competencies required by <b>team</b> <b>leaders,</b> the role of <b>team</b> <b>leaders,</b> and others. A research conducted by the National Productivity Institute (NPD among some South African companies on similar issues' was used in this research. The researcher discovered that <b>team</b> <b>leaders</b> at ABI were generally regarded as part of management by both middle managers and shopfloor employees. However, the role of <b>team</b> <b>leaders</b> was n. 't clear to many employees. It was recognised that there were certain activities that should be carried out by <b>team</b> <b>leaders</b> but were currently not. Some of these activities are performance management, goal setting, and budget control. Concerning the development of <b>team</b> <b>leaders,</b> the researcher found that ABI had offered a variety of courses to <b>team</b> <b>leaders,</b> yet lacked a cohesive development approach and programme. The researcher concluded that the status of <b>team</b> <b>leaders,</b> as well as their motivation, could be enhanced by allowing them to take full responsibility for shopfloor employee management. Also, it was concluded that the development of <b>team</b> <b>leaders</b> would be more effective if it was holistic and located within a planned programme. Recommendations for A BI's consideration have been made on some of these aspects...|$|R
