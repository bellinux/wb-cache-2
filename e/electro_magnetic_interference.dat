30|$|ADCs using {{synchronous}} modulators, {{sample the}} input with minimum Nyquist rate {{decided by the}} maximum signal variation. As a result, most of the power is wasted; in signal processing terms, the signal is non-stationary and therefore the optimal sampling rate should be adapted based on the signal characteristics [3]. As many real-world signals vary irregularly, and asynchronous circuit processes only these relevant brief periods. It reduces the circuit activity and thus the dynamic power consumption. Also, the asynchronous modulator implementation is clockless and eliminates clock jitter as well the high-frequency injection problems. Since the restrictions imposed by a regular clock are not present in Asynchronous Sigma-Delta Modulator (ASDM), the requirements on the settling (bandwidth) and slew rate of the op-amps are significantly reduced [4]. Compared to synchronous modulators, it has other advantages like low susceptibility to <b>Electro</b> <b>Magnetic</b> <b>Interferences</b> (EMI), immunity to metastability, low power dissipation and recursive signal reconstruction etc. [5 – 7]. Thus, ASDM {{proved to be an}} efficient implementation.|$|R
40|$|Advanced power {{electronics}} systems {{are increasingly being}} used for AC motor drives, due to their numerous advantages in terms of performance and flexibility; however, due to their switching behaviour, they introduce significant harmonic content. To reduce any interaction with other appliances suitable EMI filters need to be designed and implemented. The focus of this thesis is on the characterization of a matrix converter induction motor drive for aerospace application {{from the point of}} view of EMI interference and on the design and implementation of suitable filtering systems. Concerns about <b>Electro</b> <b>Magnetic</b> <b>Interferences</b> are particularly justified in the light of the fact that high reliability is sought after in such applications. The main interest in this work lies in the electromagnetic regulations defining the allowable conducted emissions in the frequencies between 150 kHz and 30 MHz. The first goal achieved by this work is to characterize the EMI signature of a matrix converter induction motor drive using common and differential mode measurements of the converter and motor impedances separately. Based only on these measurements the project aims to synthesize accurate HF models for the Induction Motor and the Matrix Converter in common and differential mode, without the need of deep level studies that may involve long Finite Elements (FE) simulations of the physical system characteristics. This thesis proposes two general novel HF models for Matrix Converters and Induction Motors that could also be applied in any other application or operating condition. These models are automatically tuned and optimized by a suitably developed Genetic Algorithm (GA) routine capable to match those models with real experimental measurements. This thesis reports the methodologies used for both input and output filter design, together with description and analysis of some issues encountered during the process...|$|R

40|$|Traditionally Voltage Source Inverter (VSI) and Current Source Inverter (CSI) fed {{induction}} motor drives {{have a limited}} output voltage range. Conventional VSI and CSI support only current buck DC-AC power conversion and need a relatively complex modulator. The limitations of VSI and CSI are overcome by Z-source inverter. The Z-source inverter system employs a unique LC network in the DC link and a small capacitor on the AC side of the diode front end. By controlling the shoot-through duty cycle, the Z-source can produce any desired output AC voltage, even greater than the line voltage (i. e. 325 V for 230 V AC) regardless of the input voltage. The proposed Z-source inverter system provides ridethrough capability during voltage sags, reduces line harmonics, improves power factor and reliability, and extends the output voltage range. Analysis, simulation, and experimental results were presented to demonstrate these features. This system reduces harmonics, electromagnetic interference noise and it has low common mode noise.

Traditionally, IC- sorting machine is controlled by industry personal computer (IPC), which bears disadvantages such as large size and high cost.

First, we gave an outline of the configuration and operation principle of the sorting machine. Second, the input and output (I/O) signals that should be controlled were classified. Last but not least, the control strategy was presented both from the hardware side and the software side.

40|$|AbstractDependability is an {{important}} requirement in hard real-time applications due to the potentially catastrophic consequences of failures. In these systems, fault tolerance mechanisms like temporal redundancy are adopted to improve reliability. Most {{of these types of}} systems are increasingly moving towards integrating critical and non-critical functionalities on the same platform to, e. g., better utilize resources and further reduce cost, and are commonly deployed in environments where errors typically occur in the form of bursts e. g., due to <b>Electro</b> <b>Magnetic</b> <b>Interference</b> (EMI). Consequently, in mixed criticality real-time systems, the designer must guarantee that critical tasks are feasible even under the presence of the error burst, while ensuring the feasibility of the non-critical tasks that are not affected by the burst. We refer to this as Fault Tolerance feasibility (FT-feasibility) of mixed-criticality real-time systems. In this paper, we build on the well established results on Earliest Deadline First (EDF) scheduling, to derive a sufficient test that determines the FT-feasibility of a set of mixed criticality real-time tasks under the assumption that the inter-arrival time between two consecutive error bursts is at least equal to the hyper-period of the taskset...|$|E

In order to suppress the Common Mode (CM) conducted EMI, different possibilities of connecting the Y- capacitor in a two wire universal input half bridge converter are discussed and the conducted EMI is measured and analyzed by connecting the Y- capacitor at different points. The line filters are designed, characterized and implemented in order to suppress conducted EMI.

However, {{it is difficult to}} measure vertical displacements of bridges and yet they are among the most important indicators of structural behaviour. Therefore, it prompts a need to develop a simple, inexpensive and yet more practical method to measure vertical displacements of bridges.
