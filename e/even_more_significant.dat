5|$|In {{a number}} of von Neumann's papers, the methods of {{argument}} he employed are considered <b>even</b> <b>more</b> <b>significant</b> than the results. In anticipation of his later study of dimension theory in algebras of operators, von Neumann used results on equivalence by finite decomposition, and reformulated the problem of measure in terms of functions. In his 1936 paper on analytic measure theory, he used the Haar theorem in the solution of Hilbert's fifth problem {{in the case of}} compact groups. In 1938, he was awarded the Bôcher Memorial Prize for his work in analysis.|$|E
5|$|During {{the era of}} the {{collodion}} process, {{before the}} arrival of less demanding photographic technology (the gelatin silver process, photographic film, and smaller cameras) and the consequent rise of amateur photography, commercial photographers like Farsari had a particular importance for recording events and views. In Japan before 1899 such photographers were <b>even</b> <b>more</b> <b>significant</b> because the government required foreigners to obtain passes to journey to the interior, and commercial photographers based in Japan could more easily gain access and provide rare images of restricted areas. By 1889, however, Farsari estimated that about half of all visitors to Yokohama were amateur photographers; even if this was an exaggeration, the presence of increasing numbers of amateur photographers was obviously affecting the commercial photography business. To encourage amateur photographers to visit his studio and possibly buy his merchandise, Farsari provided free use of a darkroom.|$|E
5|$|The 1499 Madonna {{panel is}} a free adaption, in that the artist has changed and repositioned a number of elements. However, art historians usually agree that they are to the {{detriment}} of the balance and impact of the composition. The panel attributed to Gossaert shows <b>even</b> <b>more</b> <b>significant,</b> though perhaps more successful, alterations, including shifting the centre of balance by adding a section to the right-hand side, dressing the Virgin entirely in dark blue and changing her facial features. Both copies omit the two pools of bright light on the floor across from her, thus removing the mystical element of van Eyck's original, perhaps because its significance was not grasped by the later artists. That Gossaert followed other aspects of the original so closely, however, is evidence of the high regard he held for van Eyck's technical and aesthetic ability, and his version has been seen by some as a homage. The Master of 1499's admiration for van Eyck can be seen in his left-hand panel, which contains many features reminiscent of van Eyck's Arnolfini Portrait, including the rendering of the ceiling beams and the colour and texture of the red fabrics.|$|E

5|$|Recently, {{several studies}} have shown that archaea exist not only in {{mesophilic}} and thermophilic environments but are also present, sometimes in high numbers, at low temperatures as well. For example, archaea are common in cold oceanic environments such as polar seas. <b>Even</b> <b>more</b> <b>significant</b> are the large numbers of archaea found throughout the world's oceans in non-extreme habitats among the plankton community (as part of the picoplankton). Although these archaea can be present in extremely high numbers (up to 40% of the microbial biomass), almost none of these species have been isolated and studied in pure culture. Consequently, our understanding of the role of archaea in ocean ecology is rudimentary, so their full influence on global biogeochemical cycles remains largely unexplored. Some marine Crenarchaeota are capable of nitrification, suggesting these organisms may affect the oceanic nitrogen cycle, although these oceanic Crenarchaeota may also use other sources of energy. Vast numbers of archaea are also found in the sediments that cover the sea floor, with these organisms making up the majority of living cells at depths over 1 meter below the ocean bottom. It has been demonstrated that in all oceanic surface sediments (from 1000- to 10,000-m water depth), the impact of viral infection is higher on archaea than on bacteria and virus-induced lysis of archaea accounts for up to one-third of the total microbial biomass killed, resulting in the release of ~0.3 to 0.5 gigatons of carbon per year globally.|$|E

50|$|The {{distinction}} between Reformed and Catholic, and the coherence of the two, is routinely {{a matter of}} debate both within specific Anglican churches and throughout the Anglican Communion by members themselves. Since the Oxford Movement of the mid-19th century, many churches of the communion have revived and extended liturgical and pastoral practices similar to Roman Catholicism. This extends beyond the ceremony of High Church services to <b>even</b> <b>more</b> theologically <b>significant</b> territory, such as sacramental theology (see Anglican sacraments). While Anglo-Catholic practices, particularly liturgical ones, have resurfaced and become more common within the tradition over the last century, there remain many places where practices and beliefs remain on the more Reformed or Evangelical side (see Sydney Anglicanism).|$|R
40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{the effect of}} governmental environmental taxes on greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions using a panel data set of 19 EU countries for the time period 1995 - 2010. We estimate both direct and indirect effects of governmental environmental taxes on GHG emissions in industrial processes. The indirect effect in particular operates through the effect of environmental expenditure for reduction of GHG emissions in industry. To {{take into account the}} dynamic nature and to properly address the potential endogeneity, adequate econometric methods are applied. We have shown that the direct effect of environmental taxes on GHG emissions is negative, while the indirect effect through environmental expenditures is also negative and <b>even</b> <b>more</b> statistically <b>significant.</b> Consequently, some policy implications may be derived from the results. </p...|$|R

The hint was taken: in all provinces where serfdom existed, emancipation committees were formed.|$|E
25|$|Evidence of {{that fact}} came in 1939, when Newport {{reported}} to the Bureau that the exploder was giving unexplained prematures.

30|$|Comparing {{the results}} of the non{{parametric}} tests and the parametric procedures for unequal variances one sees similarity in the treatment comparisons.

50|$|The {{standardization}} of living (i.e. {{hot and cold}} running water, electricity, access to medicine and education, etc.) between the workers in the urban-cityscape {{and those in the}} rural-farming lands was an important piece of foundational Marxism-Leninism in the Soviet Union.

25|$|The caged rats (Groups CC and PC) {{took to the}} {{morphine}} instantly, {{even with}} relatively little sweetener, with the caged males drinking 19 times more morphine than the Rat Park males {{in one of the}} experimental conditions. The rats in Rat Park resisted the morphine water. They would try it occasionallywith the females trying it more often than the malesbut they showed a statistically significant preference for the plain water. He writes that the most interesting group was Group CP, the rats who were brought up in cages but moved to Rat Park before the experiment began. These animals rejected the morphine solution when it was stronger, but as it became sweeter and more dilute, they began to drink almost as much as the rats that had lived in cages throughout the experiment. They wanted the sweet water, he concluded, so long as it did not disrupt their normal social behavior. <b>Even</b> <b>more</b> <b>significant,</b> he writes, was that when he added a drug called Naloxone, which negates the effects of opioids, to the morphine-laced water, the Rat Park rats began to drink it.|$|E
25|$|Despite India {{finishing}} {{second in}} Group A, they began the Super Six stage with no points {{due to the}} controversial Byzantine points system which gave a team 2 points {{at the start of}} the Super Six stage for beating a team in the Group stage which had also qualified for the Super Six stage (India did not win against fellow qualifiers South Africa and Zimbabwe). India's first match in the Super Six stage was against Australia at The Oval in London, which they lost badly by 77 runs, with only Jadeja (100 not out from 138 balls, 7 fours, 2 sixes) and Robin Singh (75 from 94 balls, 5 fours, 3 sixes) putting up any resistance. Mark Waugh's 83 and Glenn McGrath's 3/34 took the match away from India. Due to this loss, India, in order to reach the semifinals, now not only had to beat Pakistan and New Zealand, they also had to depend on other results. India beat Pakistan in their next match at Old Trafford in Manchester by 47 runs, maintaining their all-win record over their arch-rivals in the World Cup. Dravid (61 from 89 balls, 4 fours) and Azharuddin (59 from 77 balls, 3 fours, 1 six), led the way as India posted a total of 227/6 in their 50 overs. Prasad then ripped through the Pakistani batting line-up, taking 5/27 as Pakistan were bowled all out for 180. The match was <b>even</b> <b>more</b> <b>significant</b> than usual as the two nations were at war with each other (see 1999 Kargil Conflict). Unfortunately, despite the win against Pakistan, India were soon eliminated from the tournament due to other results and their handicap in terms of points in the Super Six stage. India's last match in the Super Six stage against New Zealand at Trent Bridge in Nottingham was also the team's last match in the tournament. The match, reduced to a dead rubber since New Zealand had already qualified for the semifinals, was a thriller, with India losing in the end by 5 wickets as New Zealand achieved the target of 252 with just 8 balls to spare, despite a strong performance from Jadeja (76 from 103 balls, 6 fours, 2 six).|$|E
30|$|The {{evidence}} of Americanization {{can be found}} even in interwar Lithuania as worldwide acknowledged brands, such as Ford Motors, Wrigley, Chevrolet, Chrysler, Gillette and others, were well known at that time (Minkevičius, 2015).
