5|$|Legend <b>has</b> <b>it</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> Cailleach {{was tired}} {{from a long}} day herding deer. Atop Ben Cruachan she fell asleep on her watch and a well she was tending overflowed, running down from the {{highlands}} and flooding the valleys below, forming first a river and then the loch. The overflowing well is a common motif in local Gaelic creation tales - {{as seen in the}} goddess Boann's similar creation of the River Boyne in Ireland. Other connections to the region include her above-mentioned strong ties with the fierce whirlpool in the Gulf of Corryvreckan.|$|E
5|$|Mythology <b>has</b> <b>it</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> {{forests of}} Vajjabhumi (west Birbhum) were hot-spots of Hindu and tantric activities. Some authors have called Birbhum {{by the name}} Kamkoti which relates to its tantric heritage. Tantrics, {{including}} the Vajrayana, the Shaktas, and the Buddhists established many temples for tantra sadhana rituals and Shakti worship. Birbhum has many Shakti Peethas such as Tarapith, Bakreshwar, Kankalitala, Fullara near Labhpur, Sainthia and Nalhati. One of the famous Shakti worshippers of Tarapith was Bamdev, popularly known as Bama Khyapa.|$|E
5|$|Once {{again in}} Buenos Aires, San Martín {{and his wife}} {{attended}} to the first official performance of the Argentine National Anthem, on 28 May 1813 at the Coliseo Theater. Oral tradition <b>has</b> <b>it</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> premiere took place on 14 May 1813 {{at the home of}} aristocrat Mariquita Sánchez de Thompson, with San Martín also attending, but there is no documentary evidence of that. The lyrics of the new anthem included several references to the secessionist will of the time.|$|E
500|$|Her father {{refused to}} comment, {{saying that his}} {{interest}} in the Lody case was [...] "only a passing one". A rumour <b>had</b> <b>it</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> German government paid Louise Storz $15,000 in compensation for her ex-husband's death, but she denied this in 1915.|$|R
5|$|Over the years, {{the name}} has {{attracted}} many mythicising explanations. The earliest attested appears in Geoffrey of Monmouth's Historia Regum Britanniae, written around 1136. This <b>had</b> <b>it</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> name originated from a supposed King Lud, who had allegedly {{taken over the}} city and named it Kaerlud.|$|R
50|$|Guimbaolibot {{was born}} in Guiuan on December 5, 1866, the second child of Tomas Guimbaolibot and Narcisa Bago. He had three sisters: Felipa, the eldest, Faustina and Maria. Local {{accounts}} <b>had</b> <b>it</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> Guimbaolibot children were raised in a simple but religious life at home.|$|R
5|$|One account <b>has</b> <b>it</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> Germans paid Bogdan-Pitești {{the cost}} of paper and printing, which had been {{hitherto}} provided, for free, by Cantacuzino. Bogdan-Pitești (and German funds) were probably involved in financing a new platform, Cronica, launched by Arghezi and Gala Galaction in February 1915. In October of that year, with probable German support, Bogdan-Pitești, Arghezi and Galaction set up another Germanophile newspaper, Libertatea ("Freedom"), presided upon, for a short while, by N. Fleva. According to one account, Fleva had earlier been approached to take over as Seara manager by German envoys Brociner and Hilmar von dem Bussche-Haddenhausen, but, realizing the implications, had refused.|$|E
5|$|Prior to {{the eighteenth}} century, the Russian Orthodox Church did not assign any {{particular}} symbolism to the exterior {{shape of a}} church. Nevertheless, onion domes are popularly believed to symbolise burning candles. In 1917, noted religious philosopher Prince Yevgeny Trubetskoy argued that the onion shape of Russian church domes may not be explained rationally. According to Trubetskoy, drums crowned by tapering domes were deliberately scored to resemble candles, thus manifesting a certain aesthetic and religious attitude. Another explanation <b>has</b> <b>it</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> onion dome was originally regarded as a form reminiscent of the edicula (cubiculum) in the Church of the Holy Sepulchre in Jerusalem.|$|E
5|$|Several legends about Jovan Vladimir {{have been}} {{recorded}} in western Macedonia. One has it that, after he was beheaded, he brought {{his head to the}} Monastery of StJohn of Bigor. On a hill above the village of Pesočani in the Municipality of Debarca, there is a locality called Vladimirovo, at which some ruins can be seen. The locals claimed that Vladimir was born there, and brought his severed head there. The Church of StAthanasius near Pesočani, now in ruins, is reputed to have been built by Vladimir. People from the region gathered there each year {{on the eve of his}} feast day. They lit candles on the remains of the church's walls, and prayed to the saint. Tradition <b>has</b> <b>it</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> Monastery of StNaum had a bell tower named after the saint, in the foundation of which a portion of his relics was placed.|$|E
50|$|According to Roman {{historian}} Tacitus, this work, {{together with}} the Pro Milone, In Catilinam, and In Verrem, made Cicero famous, and much of his political career sprang from {{the effect of these}} works. Others would <b>have</b> <b>it</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> Pro Ligario, in which Cicero defends Ligarius before Caesar, was the vehicle of his renown.|$|R
2500|$|The common {{stereotype}} on {{the issues}} of love and sex <b>had</b> <b>it</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> hippies were [...] "promiscuous, having wild sex orgies, seducing innocent teenagers and every manner of sexual perversion." [...] The hippie movement appeared concurrently {{in the midst of a}} rising sexual revolution, in which many views of the status quo on this subject were being challenged.|$|R
5|$|During the war the {{chancellery}} was destroyed, {{except for}} the exterior walls, by air raids and in the Battle of Berlin in 1945. It was eventually dismantled by the Soviets and rumors <b>have</b> <b>it,</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> remains <b>have</b> been used for other building projects like the Humboldt University, Mohrenstraße metro station or Soviet war memorials in Berlin, {{but none of these}} are true.|$|R
5|$|Since {{classical}} antiquity, {{the area}} around Kvarner Bay has been characterized as a meeting point of diverse cultures—from Hellenic and Roman cultures, through the Middle Ages and a succession of various rulers, to the present day. This blending {{is reflected in the}} folklore of the area, including Zvončari—bell-ringers best known for annual pageant in Kastav, listed on UNESCO's Representative List of the Intangible Cultural Heritage of Humanity. Crossbowmen from Rab are a living history company reenacting an arbalest tournament first held in 1364 to commemorate the successful defence of the island using that weapon. A typical decorative motif used in the region is morčić (plural: morčići)—a dark skinned Moor used as a centerpiece on jewelry, usually earrings. Legend <b>has</b> <b>it</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> motif is related to a hypothesized battle between Croatian and Ottoman armies on Grobnik north of Rijeka, but {{it is more likely that}} it is of Venetian origin, as it is similar to the Venetian moretti motif, used mostly on brooches and pins.|$|E
5|$|St Nicholas Church, {{near the}} river Thames, has a 15th-century tower, {{although}} {{the remainder of the}} church was rebuilt by J.L. Pearson in 1882–84. Monuments in the churchyard mark the burial sites of the 18th-century English artist William Hogarth and William Kent, the architect and landscape designer; the churchyard also houses a mausoleum (for Philip James de Loutherbourg) designed by John Soane, and the tomb of Josiah Wedgwood's business partner, Thomas Bentley, designed by Thomas Scheemakers. One of Oliver Cromwell's daughters, Mary Fauconberg, lived at Sutton Court and is buried in the churchyard. Enduring legend <b>has</b> <b>it</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> body of Oliver Cromwell was also interred with her, though as the Fauconbergs did not move to Sutton Court until 15 years after his disinterment, it is more likely he was reburied at their home at Newburgh Priory. Private Frederick Hitch VC, hero of Rorke's Drift, is also buried there.|$|E
5|$|For {{several years}} both Colla Ciotach and the Macfie chief lived on Colonsay, with Colla Ciotach {{residing}} at Kiloran and Macfie at Dùn Eibhinn. During {{this time the}} two feuded. Judging by the many hiding places which bear his name, such as leab' fhalaich Mhic a Phì ("MacPhee's Hiding Place"), Macfie was chased {{from one to another}} for quite sometime. Finally, in 1623, Malcolm Macfie was chased from Colonsay and pursued to Eilean nan Ròn (south-west of Oronsay). There, on the south-western corner of Eilean nan Ròn, called an t Eilean Iarach, he was spotted and taken by the MacDonalds. Popular lore <b>has</b> <b>it</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> Macfie chief was finally discovered when his hiding place amongst the seaweed was given away by a gull. As it hovered over Macfie's position, Colla Ciotach's men were alerted by its cry and spotted the clan chief on a ledge of rock {{at the edge of the}} sea. After being apprehended, the chief was then tied to a stone and summarily shot. Colla Ciotach, and several of his followers, appear in the Council Records in 1623 as being accused of killing the Macfie chief. Because of the death of their chief the Macfies finally lost control of Colonsay. The island then passed to the Macdonalds, as Colla Ciotach took the island for himself, and held it peacefully for many years.|$|E
25|$|Village {{tradition}} <b>had</b> <b>it</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> current St Catherine's Church was predated by {{an older}} building which {{was destroyed by}} fire. There is little evidence of this, except for the occasional burnt stonework included in more recent buildings. One such example was burnt ancient stonework re-used {{at the back of}} the old village school. (This is now a private residence and not visible).|$|R

50|$|Attachment theory would <b>have</b> <b>it</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> fantasy selves {{projected}} onto others in parataxic distortion are informed by our long-term attachment patterns. Not only are these imagined traits the resultant of our earliest bonds and unresolved emotional issues from past relationships, {{but they are}} recreated in these fantasy selves {{for the purpose of}} recreating that past attachment in the present.|$|R

25|$|During the Second World War, {{the colleges}} of the {{university}} (with the exception of Birkbeck) and their students left London for safer parts of the UK, while Senate House {{was used by the}} Ministry of Information, with its roof becoming an observation point for the Royal Observer Corps. Though the building was hit by bombs several times, it emerged from the war largely unscathed; rumour at <b>the</b> time <b>had</b> <b>it</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> reason the building had fared so well was that Adolf Hitler had planned to use it as his headquarters in London.|$|R
50|$|A legend <b>has</b> <b>it</b> <b>that</b> during <b>the</b> creation, {{the demons}} Madhu-Kaitabha stole the Vedas from Brahma, and Vishnu {{then took the}} Hayagriva form to recover them. The two bodies of Madhu and Kaitabha {{disintegrated}} into twelve pieces (two heads, two torsos, four arms and four legs). These are considered to represent the twelve seismic plates of the Earth. Yet another legend <b>has</b> <b>it</b> <b>that</b> during <b>the</b> creation, Vishnu compiled the Vedas in the Hayagrīva form.|$|R
50|$|By 1800 he {{had removed}} to Dutchess County, New York, and on June 21, 1800, he married Sarah Van Kleek (1779-1833) at the Dutch Reformed Church in Poughkeepsie, New York. Before 1810, he settled in Albany, New York where he sold hats made {{by his brother}} Timothy in Guilderland, New York.

25|$|Legend <b>has</b> <b>it</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> {{historical}} Buddha himself {{created the}} first depiction of the bhavacakra, {{and the story of}} how he gave the illustration to King Rudrāyaṇa appears in the anthology of Buddhist narratives called the Divyāvadāna.|$|E
25|$|Another interpretation, {{found for}} example in the account {{presented}} by Anthony Kenny <b>has</b> <b>it</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> problem with a private ostensive definition {{is not just that}} it might be misremembered, but that such a definition cannot lead to a meaningful statement.|$|E
25|$|Legend <b>has</b> <b>it</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> {{people who}} mated with the {{indigenous}} people in the eastern coastal area of South Africa arrived in strange ships carrying men in white headdresses and long flowing robes.

50|$|Ettumanoor Mahadeva temple is {{an ancient}} Shiva temple in Kottayam, Kerala, India. <b>It</b> <b>has</b> brought glory and fame to <b>the</b> place. Myths <b>have</b> <b>it</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> Pandavas and the sage Vyasa had worshipped at this temple. The name of the place has its origin from the word 'manoor', which means the land of deer. The temple {{is one of the}} major Shiva temples in Kerala counted along with the Shiva temples of Chengannur Mahadeva Temple, Kaduthruthy Mahadeva Temple, Vaikom Temple, Ernakulam Shiva Temple and Vadakkunathan temple.|$|R
50|$|His {{descendant}} Tobias Van Steenburgh was {{the owner}} of record {{at the time of the}} Revolution. Why the house was not burned in 1777 is not known. Legend <b>has</b> <b>it</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> was <b>the</b> home of a Mrs. Hammersly, a woman with Loyalist sympathies, who was in love with a British officer who spared <b>the</b> house. Others <b>have</b> <b>it</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> British began to burn the house, but the order to withdraw was sounded soon after and slaves who were hiding in the nearby woods quickly extinguished what little fire there was after the troops left. A variant on that tale says <b>that</b> since <b>the</b> house was used as an inn at the time, the slaves rolled a barrel of rum they had tapped and treated the soldiers to free drink until the order came to leave.|$|R
25|$|Church lore <b>has</b> <b>it</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> first {{bell was}} made from copper and silver brought by congregants as gifts upon the baptism of their children.

25|$|The Cathedral Cave {{was long}} {{thought to be}} buttless, making St. Michael's Cave the subject of one of Gibraltar's most famous legends.

2500|$|Even {{before his}} {{adherence}} to radical modernism, {{with its own}} political undertones, Aderca was a respected social critic. His support for World War I neutrality, outlined in his Sânge închegat essays and in his Seara articles, emerged as a countercritique of anti-German sentiment. Aderca <b>had</b> <b>it</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> German Empire was morally justified in destroying the cultural patrimony of enemy nations, short of being [...] "barbaric". That claim was controversial, and criticized by Aderca's fellow Germanophile, Constantin Rădulescu-Motru.

50|$|Folklore <b>has</b> <b>it</b> <b>that</b> when <b>the</b> Gikuyu {{ancestors}} Ndemi and Mathathi were subdiving their land, {{that piece}} of land was given by Ndemi to his son Waithanji and thus the place became known as Kiawaithanji or Waithanji's land.|$|R
