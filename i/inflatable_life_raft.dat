25|$|Second Officer MacIsaac took {{command of}} the after part of the ship. He got a covered <b>inflatable</b> <b>life</b> <b>raft</b> {{launched}} and ordered Third Officer Meurig Caffery and two other men into it. Teti cast a line to the raft, towed it to safety and transferred {{two of the men}} to another pilot boat. Third Officer Caffery asked Santagata to let him remain aboard Teti to help with the rescue. Caffery looked to be in good condition so Santagata agreed.|$|E
25|$|The boat’s navigational and {{communications}} {{systems have been}} damaged by saltwater intrusion. The man tries to repair the marine radio and connects {{it to one of}} the boat's batteries but is unsuccessful. When he climbs the mast to repair an antenna lead, he sees an oncoming tropical storm. When the storm arrives, he runs before the wind. He intends to bring the boat into a hove-to position, but when crawling to the bow to hoist the storm jib, he is thrown overboard and regains the deck after a long struggle. The boat capsizes, turtles after a further 180-degree roll and is dis-masted, and most of the equipment is destroyed. With the boat badly holed and sinking, the man abandons ship in an <b>inflatable</b> <b>life</b> <b>raft,</b> salvaging whatever he can to survive.|$|E

5000|$|On 20 September 1999, a JAS 39A Gripen (serial no 39-156) from [...] Airwing F 7 Såtenäs {{crashed into}} Lake Vänern during a dogfight exercise. After {{passing through the}} wake vortex of the other {{aircraft}}, the aircraft abruptly changed course, and the pilot, Capt. Rickard Mattsson, got a highest-severity warning from the ground-collision warning system. He ejected from the aircraft, and landed safely by parachute in the lake, where his colleague observed him getting into the <b>inflatable</b> <b>life</b> <b>raft.</b> He {{was picked up by}} a rescue helicopter 27 minutes later.|$|E
2500|$|... 21 November 2006 – A Eurocopter AS332 L2 {{search and}} rescue {{helicopter}} ditched in the North Sea. The aircraft was equipped with two automatic <b>inflatable</b> <b>life</b> <b>rafts,</b> but both failed to inflate. The Dutch Safety Board afterwards issued a warning.|$|R
50|$|Emergency {{evacuation}} systems include <b>inflatable</b> <b>life</b> <b>rafts</b> and manually extendable canvas evacuation slides. Most {{aircraft are}} now retrospectively fitted with emergency floor lighting strips and some aircraft equipped with automatically inflatable evacuation slides. Fire extinguishers are sited in engine nacelles, flightdeck compartment, cabin crew rest areas and toilets.|$|R
50|$|On May 17, 2011, {{the ship}} {{sustained}} considerable damage to several lifeboats when a fuel loading barge {{collided with the}} side of the ship while in the port of St Petersburg, Russia. After inspection by authorities, it was determined the ship still had enough passenger space in an emergency using <b>inflatable</b> <b>life</b> <b>rafts,</b> and the ship continued on her planned itinerary.|$|R
50|$|Roddenberry and Volpe {{gathered}} what equipment {{they could}} {{from the burning}} wreckage, including several first aid kits, {{a number of the}} passengers' coats and an <b>inflatable</b> <b>life</b> <b>raft.</b> As the only surviving flight officer, Roddenberry took command of the situation, but did so without knowing if the plane's position had been radioed to authorities. First aid was conducted, and after sunrise, the raft was inflated and propped up to provide shade and shelter. Shortly afterwards, a number of desert tribesmen approached the survivors. Roddenberry approached them, and later stated he had influenced them {{to the extent that they}} only robbed the dead and spared the survivors.|$|E
50|$|Unable to stay aboard Napoleon Solo as {{it filled}} with water and was {{overwhelmed}} by breaking seas, Callahan escaped into a six-person Avon <b>inflatable</b> <b>life</b> <b>raft,</b> measuring about six feet across. He stood off in the raft, but managed to get back aboard several times to dive below and retrieve a piece of cushion, a sleeping bag, and an emergency kit containing, among other things, some food, navigation charts, a short spear gun, flares, torch, solar stills for producing drinking water {{and a copy of}} Sea Survival, a survival manual written by Dougal Robertson, a fellow ocean survivor. Before dawn, a big breaking sea parted the life raft from Napoleon Solo and Callahan drifted away.|$|E

50|$|The Coast Guard {{discovered}} {{numerous other}} violations: No fire doors were closed during the blaze. Lifejackets were not stored in every cabin. The ship did not carry three <b>inflatable</b> <b>life</b> <b>rafts,</b> {{which it was}} required to have by law. There was only one radio operator on board, while the law required two. Passengers had also never been informed of evacuation procedures.|$|R
50|$|Tower Belle {{is powered}} by a diesel engine which drives a single propeller. Her overall length is 67.97 ft and her beam is 13 ft. The draught is 2.83 ft and the air draught is 12 ft. The ship is {{licensed}} to carry 95 passengers and is equipped with <b>life</b> rings, <b>inflatable</b> <b>life</b> <b>rafts</b> and <b>life</b> jackets. There is a small bar and toilet facilities.|$|R
50|$|A {{lifeboat}} is a small, rigid or {{inflatable boat}} carried for emergency evacuation {{in the event}} of a disaster aboard a ship. Lifeboat drills are required by law on larger commercial ships. Rafts (liferafts) are also used. In the military, a lifeboat may double as a whaleboat, dinghy, or gig. The ship's tenders of cruise ships often double as lifeboats. Recreational sailors usually carry <b>inflatable</b> <b>life</b> <b>rafts,</b> though a few prefer small proactive lifeboats that are harder to sink and can be sailed to safety.|$|R
50|$|In December 1995, Chuck Noland is a time-obsessed systems engineer, {{who travels}} {{worldwide}} resolving productivity problems at FedEx depots. He is {{in a long-term}} relationship with Kelly Frears, with whom he lives in Memphis, Tennessee. Although the couple wants to get married, Chuck's busy schedule interferes with their relationship. A Christmas with relatives is interrupted when Chuck is summoned to resolve a problem in Malaysia. While flying through a violent storm, his plane crashes into the Pacific Ocean. Chuck escapes the sinking plane and is saved by an <b>inflatable</b> <b>life</b> <b>raft,</b> but loses the emergency locator transmitter. He clings to the life raft, loses consciousness, and floats all night before being washed up on an island. After he awakens, he explores the island and soon discovers that it is uninhabited.|$|E
50|$|Military {{operators}} would commonly {{operate the}} type {{at a very}} low altitude to minimise visibility to enemies, the Bo 105 being well matched to such operations, as the helicopter's flight qualities effectively removed or greatly minimised several of the hazards such a flight profile could pose to pilots. When outfitted with optional auxiliary fuel tanks, a basic model Bo 105 had a flight endurance of roughly five hours under load. In {{the event of a}} single engine failure, the Bo 105 could typically continue its flight, albeit with a reduction in cruise speed and range. Besides the two pilots, the cabin can be configured to accommodate up to three passengers on a single rear bench, which can be removed to make room for cargo or a stretcher, which can be loaded and unloaded via the large clamshell doors located {{at the rear of the}} fuselage. In a maritime context, the BO 105 can be equipped with auxiliary fuel tanks, emergency flotation equipment, an <b>inflatable</b> <b>life</b> <b>raft,</b> folding rotor blades and high skid landing gear.|$|E
5000|$|Also used {{to effect}} was {{announcer}} Douglas Smith's stuffy BBC vocal style. Smith would be {{cast as a}} car, an <b>inflatable</b> <b>life</b> <b>raft,</b> a shark, a lion, a river boat, a gun, a volcano, and in the fourth series, in the Bona Prince Charlie sketch, as England, and even more improbably, in the Round The World sketch, as the world ("... and it'll take Mr Williams more than 80 days to get around me!"). These roles would require such inane phrases as [...] "snap snap", [...] "rumble rumble", [...] "roar roar snarl slaver", or [...] "chug chug futt", preceded by portentous announcements such as [...] "...and I, Douglas Smith, play the volcano". He would also slip in spoof commercials and sponsor's announcements for [...] "Dobbiroids", the wonder horse rejuvenator, or [...] "Dobbimist" [...] horse deodorant (a cure for UFO: under-fetlock odour), or [...] "Dobbitex" [...] horse cummerbunds - he would claim that he'd been [...] "got at": paid money to plug the product, because he claimed to be only paid a pittance as a senior BBC announcer, [...] "I want things, I need things, things the other radio announcers have got!" [...] At times, his announcements lapse into something approaching terminal narcissism - [...] "this is strangely attractive, leggy gamin Douglas Smith, the one whose skin you love to touch..." ...|$|E
50|$|Provision of {{products}} and services in this segment is primarily dealt with by Fujikura Parachute and Fujikura Rubber Ltd. This includes but {{is not limited to}} survival equipment, emergency life-saving devices such as <b>life</b> vests & <b>inflatable</b> <b>life</b> <b>rafts,</b> parachutes for emergency (e.g. bailing out of a stricken aircraft via Ejection seat or other means, insertion into remote/cut off areas by emergency personnel such as smokejumpers), airborne and sporting (including Paragliding) usage, and aircraft braking systems (e.g. for the Japan Air Self-Defense Force's F-2 fighter).|$|R
5000|$|On November 4, 1993, China Airlines Flight 605, {{a brand-new}} 747-400 from Taipei to Hong Kong Kai Tak Airport, landed 2000 feet past the {{threshold}} on runway 13, with insufficient braking power. Unable to stop {{before the end}} of the runway, the captain steered the aircraft into the Victoria Harbour. All passengers were evacuated via <b>inflatable</b> <b>life</b> <b>rafts.</b> The vertical fin was blown off with explosives, as it disrupted airport operations. The aircraft was recovered from the harbor days later and was written off.|$|R
50|$|The United States Navy uses five {{types of}} custom <b>inflatable</b> <b>life</b> <b>rafts</b> {{as well as}} a number of commercially {{available}} Coast Guard approved <b>life</b> <b>rafts.</b> The 25-person MK-6 and MK-7 are used on surface ships, the 50-person MK-8 on aircraft carriers and LRU-13A and LRU-12A on aircraft and submarines respectively. Smaller combatant craft often use 6, 10 or 15-person commercial <b>life</b> <b>rafts.</b> The number of <b>life</b> <b>rafts</b> carried on USN ships is determined based on the maximum number of personnel carried aboard plus 10% as a safety margin. Aircraft carriers carry either 254 MK7 <b>life</b> <b>rafts</b> or 127 MK8 <b>life</b> <b>rafts.</b> While both are similar to heavy-duty commercial <b>life</b> <b>rafts,</b> USN <b>life</b> <b>rafts</b> use breathable air as the inflation gas rather than carbon dioxide to ensure full inflation within 30 seconds in Arctic environments.|$|R
