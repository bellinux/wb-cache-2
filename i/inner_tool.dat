A pioneer effort to interrelate mental states and psychological job demands, ranked using the WAI questionnaire, was made as well. Subjects and methods: Upon informed consent, the tools were tested on a sample of 300 members of the operative fire-fighting squad of the City of Zagreb, all men (average age 43; average years of fire-fighting service 18. 5). The participation was voluntary and anonymous. Results: The average BDI score was 2. 34, revealing a low representation of depression in the target population. The score indicating severe depression was seen in 0. 7 % of examinees only. Cronbach alpha of 0. 92 showed satisfactory <b>inner</b> <b>tool</b> consistency. As for DSQ- 40, mature, neurotic and immature defence mechanisms were evaluated. The highest mean score of 75. 24 (± 26. 07) was obtained with immature defence (Cronbach alpha 0. 87). Self-assessed current working capacity was revealed to be strongly dependent on total years of service (r=- 0. 134; p= 0. 021), while the representation of neurotic defence positively correlated with the respondents’ age and total years of service. Immature defence strongly positively correlated with the total years of firefighting service. Conclusions: The employed tools were shown to be appropriate for use in Croatian professional fire-fighting population. Nevertheless, the interrelations disclosed by this pioneer research should be investigated further...|$|E

40|$|AbstractThe PanDA (Production and Distributed Analysis) {{workload}} {{management system}} (WMS) {{was developed to}} meet the scale and complexity of LHC distributed computing for the ATLAS experiment. PanDA currently distributes jobs among more than 100, 000 cores at well over 120 Grid sites, supercomputing centers, commercial and academic clouds. ATLAS physicists submit more than 1. 5 M data processing, simulation and analysis PanDA jobs per day, and the system keeps all meta-information about job submissions and execution events in Oracle RDBMS. The above information is used for monitoring and accounting purposes. One of the most challenging monitoring issues is tracking errors that has occurred during the execution of the jobs. Current meta-data storage technology doesn’t support <b>inner</b> <b>tools</b> for data aggregation, needed to build error summary tables, charts and graphs. Delegating these tasks to the monitor slows down the execution of requests. We will describe a project aimed at optimizing interaction between PanDA front-end and back-end, by meta-data storage segmentation into two parts – operational and archived. Active meta-data are remained in Oracle database (operational part), due to the high requirements for data integrity. Historical (read-only) meta-data used for the system analysis and accounting are exported to NoSQL storage (archived part). New data model based on usage of Cassandra as the NoSQL backend has been designed as a set of query-specific data structures. This allowed to remove most of data preparation workload from PanDA Monitor and improve its scalability and performance. Segmentation and synchronization between operational and archived parts of jobs meta-data is provided by a Hybrid Meta-data Storage Framework (HMSF). PanDA monitor was partly adopted to interact with HMSF. The operational data queries are forwarded to the primary SQL-based repository and the analytic data requests are processed by NoSQL database. The results of performance and scalability tests of HMSF-adopted part of PanDA Monitor shows that presented method of optimization, in conjunction with a properly configured NoSQL database and reasonable data model, provides performance improvements and scalability...|$|R

40|$|Thesis (Ph. D.) [...] University of Washington, 2015 - 12 Cellular core tooling {{is a new}} {{technology}} which has the capability to manufacture complex integrated monolithic composite structures. This novel tooling method utilizes thermoplastic cellular cores as <b>inner</b> <b>tooling.</b> The semi-rigid nature of the cellular cores makes them convenient for lay-up, and under autoclave temperature and pressure they soften and expand providing uniform compaction on all surfaces including internal features such as ribs and spar tubes. This process has the capability of developing fully optimized aerospace structures by reducing or eliminating assembly using fasteners or bonded joints. The technology is studied {{in the context of}} evaluating its capabilities, advantages, and limitations in developing high quality structures. The complex nature of these parts has led to development of a model using the Finite Element Analysis (FEA) software Abaqus and the plug-in COMPRO Common Component Architecture (CCA) provided by Convergent Manufacturing Technologies. This model utilizes a “virtual autoclave” technique to simulate temperature profiles, resin flow paths, and ultimately deformation from residual stress. A model has been developed simulating the temperature profile during curing of composite parts made with the cellular core technology. While modeling of composites has been performed in the past, this project will look to take this existing knowledge and apply it to this new manufacturing method capable of building more complex parts and develop a model designed specifically for building large, complex components {{with a high degree of}} accuracy. The model development has been carried out in conjunction with experimental validation. A double box beam structure was chosen for analysis to determine the effects of the technology on internal ribs and joints. Double box beams were manufactured and sectioned into T-joints for characterization. Mechanical behavior of T-joints was performed using the T-joint pull-off test and compared to traditional tooling methods. Components made with the cellular core tooling method showed an improved strength at the joints. It is expected that this knowledge will help optimize the processing of complex, integrated structures and benefit applications in aerospace where lighter, structurally efficient components would be advantageous...|$|R

40|$|Milling {{is widely}} used in the {{manufacturing}} industry. Numerous efforts {{have been made to}} improve the efficiency of milling. For the efficiency of the milling process, high demands on the material removal rate and the surface generation rate. The process parameters determining the two rates are restricted by the occurrence of regenerative chatter. This project deals with reduction of chatter vibration in end milling tool by introducing the dampers. The main objective of the present work is to design a damped milling tool. A mechanical damper has been introduced to reduce tool vibration in milling tool. The mechanical damper is composed of multi-fingered cylindrical inserts placed in a matching cylindrical hole in center of standard end mill cutter. Centrifugal forces during high speed rotation press the flexible fingers against the inner surface of the tool. Bending of the tool and damper assembly due to cutting forces causes relative axial sliding between the <b>tool</b> <b>inner</b> surface and damper fingers dissipates in the form of friction work simple numerical analysis using ANSYS is performed to estimate the amount of friction work during bending.

40|$|Traditionally seen a {{construction}} company starts {{working on a}} project the moment the design phase is finished and the specifications of the project are defined. At {{this point in the}} building process the company has to decide, in a rather short period of time, how, with what and with whom they are going to produce the specified design. Also traditionally, these actions of the construction company are regarded to be rather banal and they carry with them the image to prepare a production process in which a lot of errors occur. Earlier research indicated a different approach to this planning process to be successful. This design approach however asks for new theoretical concepts and new working methods. In this paper we will present the temporary results of an ongoing research project in which we will develop a theoretical concept of designing construction processes and a design tool for the planning engineer with which it becomes easier to monitor internal cohesion of the construction plan.

40|$|Sheet-bulk {{metal forming}} {{is a new}} {{production}} process capable of performing deep-drawing and massive forming steps in a single operation. However, due to the high forming forces of the forming process, continuous process control is {{required in order to}} detect wear on the forming tool before production quality is impacted. To be able to measure the geometry of the forming tool in the limited space of forming presses, a new inspection system is being developed within the SFB/TR 73 collaborative research center. In addition to the limited space, the process restricts the amount of time available for inspection. Existing areal optical measurement systems suffer from shadowing when measuring the <b>tool's</b> <b>inner</b> elements, as they cannot be placed in the limited space next to the tool, while tactile measurement systems cannot meet the time restrictions for measuring the areal geometries. The new inspection system uses the fringe projection optical measurement principle to capture areal geometry data from relevant parts of the forming tool in short time. Highresolution image fibers are used to connect the system's compact sensor head to a base unit containing both camera and projector of the fringe projection system, which can be positioned outside of the moving parts of the press. To enable short measurement times, a high intensity laser source is used in the projector in combination with a digital micro-mirror device. Gradient index lenses are featured in the sensor head to allow for a very compact design {{that can be used in}} the narrow space above the forming tool inside the press. The sensor head is attached to an extended arm, which also guides the image fibers to the base unit. A rotation stage offers the possibility to capture measurements of different functional elements on the circular forming tool by changing the orientation of the sensor head next to the forming tool. During operation of the press, the arm can be travelled out of the moving parts of the forming press. To further reduce the measurement times of the fringe projection system, the inverse fringe projection principle has been adapted to the system to detect geometry deviations in a single camera image. Challenges arise from vibrations of both the forming machine and the positioning stages, which are transferred via the extended arm to the sensor head. Vibrations interfere with the analysis algorithms of both encoded and inverse fringe projection and thus impair measurement accuracy. To evaluate the impact of vibrations on the endoscopic system, results of measurements of simple geometries under the influence of vibrations are discussed. The effect of vibrations is imitated by displacing the measurement specimen during the measurement with a linear positioning stage. The concept of the new inspection system is presented within the scope of the TR 73 demonstrational sheet-bulk metal forming process. Finally, the capabilities of the endoscopic fringe projection system are shown by measurements of gearing structures on a forming tool compared to a CAD-reference. © 2015 SPIE...|$|R
