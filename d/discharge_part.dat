30|$|In our opinion, {{the success}} of our program was based on a {{combination}} of three elements: (1) focus on the transition, (2) a structured approach for the collection of medication history and discrepancy analysis, combined with (3) the ICU pharmacist knowledge and skills. We assume that this program can be as successful in other ICUs. Although we do not know the single impact of the different elements of our program, we think for the medication reconciliation part at ICU admission this could probably be performed by trained pharmacy technicians as well. However, as we found the <b>discharge</b> <b>part</b> far more complicated to properly perform (e.g., being able to interpret all ICU protocols, continuation of high risk medication, restarting a patientâs medication), we find that a pharmacist with specific ICU knowledge and understanding of the discharge process is necessary for the discharge process. As we found our intervention to have a positive costâbenefit ratio, we recommend hospitals to consider having an ICU pharmacist for medication reconciliation at the ICU.|$|E

With the PCR mechanism, {{a part of the}} charge on the output nodes of associate IECRL gate coming into the <b>discharge</b> <b>part</b> is reused to charge the output nodes of another IECRL gate on the brink of value, reducing the energy dissipation needed to complete the analysis of associate IECRL gate.

40|$|A {{systematic}} {{search for}} evidence of high-temperature hydrous alteration within the gabbros of the Samail ophiolite (Oman) shows {{that most of the}} gabbros have been affected by successive stages of alteration, starting above 975 C and ending below 500 C. Sr and O isotopic analyses provide constraints on the nature and origin of the fluids associated with these alteration events. Massive gabbros, dykes and veins and their associated minerals depart from mid-ocean ridge basalt (MORB) -source magma signatures (87 Sr/ 86 Sr 407032 and depleted d 18 O 56 %). These isotopic characteristics identify seawater as the most likely hydrothermal contaminant. Samples affected by low-temperature alteration during greenschist-facies metamorphism are characterized by high water/rock ratios (410). A second group of samples, including massive gabbros and high-temperature dykes and veins, is characterized by lower water/rock ratios, in the range of 3 [...] - 5. These samples display a high-temperature hydrothermal alteration related to seawater ingression. The main fluid channels may be sub-millimetre-sized microcracks with a dominantly vertical attitude, which constitute the recharge hydrothermal system, whereas the dykes and veins represent the <b>discharge</b> <b>part.</b> This model requires that these dykes have been generated by hydration of the crystallizing gabbros via seawater penetration, near the internal wall of the magma chamber.
