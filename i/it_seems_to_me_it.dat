If the fans saw {{that kind of behavior}} in a football coach, they'd be repelled by it. Isn't it funny that one kind of behavior is expected from a football coach and another from a baseball manager? And they both have essentially the same job. <b>It</b> <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>it</b> takes a certain amount of mental toughness to keep control of your emotions. You owe it to management, your players and the fans to keep yourself under control at critical moments." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "He is {{certainly}} {{up to something}} out of the ordinary," [...] thought Sam. [...] "I wonder if he is fishing? If he is, <b>it</b> <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>it</b> is a queer way to go at it." ...|$|E
60|$|<b>It</b> <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> that George harped {{too much}} on the getting-upset idea. <b>It</b> <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> the wrong spirit to go about the trip in.|$|R
60|$|At least, so <b>it</b> <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> <b>me,</b> {{the first}} day that I went, awe struck, into the High Woods; and so <b>it</b> <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> <b>me,</b> the last day that I came, even more awe-struck, out of them.|$|R
60|$|I {{should be}} a fool <b>to</b> be that. <b>It</b> <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> so natural, so horribly natural. He's young and nice-looking and cheery. <b>It</b> <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> now {{inevitable}} {{that you should have}} fallen in love with him. You might be made for one another.|$|R
6000|$|... "There's only {{a little}} of the powder left," [...] {{announced}} Tip, looking within the box." [...] And <b>it</b> <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>it</b> is more important to bring the legs of the sofas to life than the head." ...|$|E
6000|$|The {{other man}} {{appeared}} reflective. [...] "I was watching Saxton, and {{he kind of}} woke up when Brooke let out about Devine. Now, <b>it</b> <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> <b>me,</b> <b>it</b> wasn't without a reason he put him on to that survey." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes," [...] {{said his}} grandmother; [...] "that is a round-about way. But {{it was very}} rough and stony. Presently, Samuel stopped and said, 'Father, <b>it</b> <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>it</b> is pretty stony; haven't {{we got out of}} the path?' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "It is {{the most}} terrible thing in likenesses I have ever seen," [...] the woman {{continued}} slowly. [...] "When you entered the room a few seconds ago, <b>it</b> <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> that a miracle had happened. <b>It</b> <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> that the dead had come to life." ...|$|R
6000|$|This moment yearning and thoughtful, sitting alone, <b>It</b> <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> {{there are}} other men in other lands, yearning and thoughtful; <b>It</b> <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> I can look over and behold them in Prussia, Italy, France, [...] Spain--or far, far away, in China, or in Russia or India--talking [...] other dialects; And <b>it</b> <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> <b>me,</b> if I could know those men, I should become {{attached}} to [...] them, as I do to men in my own lands. O I know we should be brethren and lovers; I know I should be happy with them.|$|R
6000|$|... "A balloon?" [...] said Bernard. [...] "Nay, <b>it</b> <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> that {{till they}} were over, I never thought at all except {{how to get}} the most rollicking and the finest rowing out of life. <b>It</b> <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> that I had about as much sense as a green monkey." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I read such {{a pretty}} story {{in one of}} Aunt Olivia's books last night," [...] she said. [...] "It was called 'The Christmas Harp.' Would you like to hear it? <b>It</b> <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>it</b> would just suit {{this part of the}} road." ...|$|E
6000|$|Madame Merle {{smiled with}} her usual grace. [...] "It's a weighty question--let me think. <b>It</b> <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>it</b> would please your father {{to see a}} careful little {{daughter}} making his tea. It's the proper duty of {{the daughter of the}} house--when she grows up." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh, Diana," [...] breathed Anne, {{squeezing}} Diana's mittened {{hand under}} the fur robe, [...] "isn't it all like a beautiful dream? Do I really look the same as usual? I feel so different that <b>it</b> <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>it</b> must show in my looks." ...|$|E
60|$|I may be mistaken, but <b>it</b> does <b>seem</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> that Deerslayer {{is not a}} work of art in any sense; <b>it</b> does <b>seem</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> that <b>it</b> is {{destitute}} {{of every}} detail that goes to the making of {{a work of art}}; in truth, <b>it</b> <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> that Deerslayer is just simply a literary delirium tremens.|$|R
6000|$|This moment yearning and {{thoughtful}} sitting alone, [...] <b>It</b> <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> {{there are other}} men in other lands yearning {{and thoughtful}}, [...] <b>It</b> <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> I can look over and behold them in Germany, Italy, [...] France, Spain, [...] Or far, far away, in China, or in Russia or talking other dialects, [...] And <b>it</b> <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> if I could know those men I should become [...] attached to them as I do to men in my own lands, [...] O I know we should be brethren and lovers, [...] I know I should be happy with them.|$|R
60|$|I refuse <b>to</b> answer that. <b>It</b> <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> {{excessively}} impertinent.|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes," [...] replied Mr. George, [...] "so far as {{efficiency}} in the government, and order, safety, and {{peace in the}} community, are concerned, the plan certainly succeeds admirably well. But there is another very important point in which <b>it</b> <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>it</b> does not succeed at all." ...|$|E
6000|$|Wilfrid {{coloured}} and laughed. [...] "I don't {{know that}} we are as far advanced as that; but I do hope that some day it may be as you say. But about this other affair. What do my father and mother say? <b>It</b> <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>it</b> would be a splendid arrangement." ...|$|E
6000|$|O father, it is alive--it {{is full of}} people--it has children! O now <b>it</b> <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>it</b> {{is talking}} to its children!

60|$|THE ELDER MISS WETHERELL. <b>It</b> <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> so wicked: {{painting}} God's work.|$|R
60|$|There was, <b>it</b> <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> <b>me,</b> a reluctantly admiring note in his voice.|$|R
60|$|<b>It</b> <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> {{that young}} Bingo must have boosted <b>me</b> <b>to</b> some purpose.|$|R
60|$|I {{have put}} the story {{together}} as <b>it</b> <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>it</b> must have happened. The incidents, at all events, are facts. Things have since occurred to those concerned affording me {{hope that they will}} never read it. I should not have troubled to tell it at all, but that it has a moral.|$|E
6000|$|As soon as I knew That {{his spirit}} was gone I thought this his due, And spoke thereupon. [...] "I think," [...] said the vicar, [...] "A read service quicker Than viols out-of-doors In these frosts and hoars.

60|$|This Is Conington's translation, but <b>it</b> <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> be {{a little}} flat.|$|R

60|$|DR. JONATHAN. <b>It</b> <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> you've come {{a little}} late, Rench,--after the event.|$|R
6000|$|... "Well," [...] I said, [...] "the fellows seem {{to think}} it's not a bad bonne femme for a beginner. I don't think it's entirely bad myself.

60|$|I commend to Congress such economy, {{and point}} out two sources where <b>It</b> <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>it</b> might commence, to wit, in the {{appropriations}} for public buildings in the many cities where work {{has not yet been}} commenced; in the appropriations for river and harbor improvement in those localities where the improvements are of but little benefit to general commerce, and for fortifications.|$|E
6000|$|... "Well," [...] said Rollo, after a moment's pause, [...] "what {{you say is}} very true. But <b>it</b> <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>it</b> was {{a little}} artful in you to do that; and you always tell me that I must not be artful, but must be {{perfectly}} honest and open in all that I do.
