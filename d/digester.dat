25|$|The solid, fibrous {{component}} of the digested material {{can be used as}} a soil conditioner to increase the organic content of soils. <b>Digester</b> liquor {{can be used as a}} fertiliser to supply vital nutrients to soils instead of chemical fertilisers that require large amounts of energy to produce and transport. The use of manufactured fertilisers is, therefore, more carbon-intensive than the use of anaerobic <b>digester</b> liquor fertiliser. In countries such as Spain, where many soils are organically depleted, the markets for the digested solids can be equally as important as the biogas.|$|E
25|$|An {{example of}} a project using an {{anaerobic}} <b>digester</b> {{can be found in}} Chile where in December 2000, the largest pork production company in Chile, initiated a voluntary process to implement advanced waste management systems (anaerobic and aerobic digestion of hog manure), in order to reduce greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions.|$|E
25|$|Anaerobic digesters can be {{designed}} and engineered to operate using {{a number of different}} configurations and can be categorized into batch vs. continuous process mode, mesophilic vs. thermophilic temperature conditions, high vs. low portion of solids, and single stage vs. multistage processes. More initial build money and a larger volume of the batch <b>digester</b> is needed to handle the same amount of waste as a continuous process <b>digester.</b> Higher heat energy is demanded in a thermophilic system compared to a mesophilic system and has a larger gas output capacity and higher methane gas content. For solids content, low will handle up to 15% solid content. Above this level is considered high solids content and can also be known as dry digestion. In a single stage process, one reactor houses the four anaerobic digestion steps. A multistage process utilizes two or more reactors for digestion to separate the methanogenesis and hydrolysis phases.|$|E

25|$|Concentrated {{black liquor}} {{contains}} organic dissolved wood residue {{in addition to}} sodium sulfate from the cooking chemicals added at the <b>digester.</b> Combustion of the organic portion of chemicals produces heat.

25|$|Biogas from {{sewage sludge}} {{treatment}} is sometimes {{used to run}} a gas engine to produce electrical power, {{some or all of}} which can be used to run the sewage works. Some waste heat from the engine is then used to heat the <b>digester.</b> The waste heat is, in general, enough to heat the <b>digester</b> to the required temperatures. The power potential from sewage works is limited – in the UK, there are about 80MW total of such generation, with the potential to increase to 150MW, which is insignificant compared to the average power demand in the UK of about 35,000MW. The scope for biogas generation from nonsewage waste biological matter – energy crops, food waste, abattoir waste, etc. - is much higher, estimated to be capable of about 3,000MW. Farm biogas plants using animal waste and energy crops are expected to contribute to reducing CO2 emissions and strengthen the grid, while providing UK farmers with additional revenues.|$|E
40|$|The {{effects of}} mesothermic {{anaerobic}} or aerobic sludge digestion on survival of eggs from the roundworms Ascaris suum, toxocara canis, Trichuris vulpis, and Trichuris suis {{and from the}} rat tapeworm Hymenolepis diminuta were studied. Destruction of eggs throughout a 15 -day treatment period, {{as well as their}} viabilities after reisolation, was analyzed. The laboratory model <b>digesters</b> used in this study were maintained at a 15 -day retention schedule, partially simulating a continuously operating system. Ascaris eggs were destroyed in the anaerobic (23 %) or aerobic (38 %) <b>digesters,</b> and 11 % Trichuris eggs were destroyed in the aerobic <b>digesters.</b> Trichuris eggs in anaerobic <b>digesters</b> and Toxocara eggs in either anaerobic or aerobic <b>digesters</b> were not destroyed. Destruction of eggs in <b>digesters</b> was correlated with the state of the eggs before subjection to the treatment processes; i. e., some Ascaris and Trichuris eggs were already embryonated in host intestinal contents or feces and hence past their most resistant stage. The viabilities of Ascaris and Toxocara eggs that survived the digestion processes were greater in anaerobically treated than in aerobically treated material. Eggs from Hymenolepis were nonviable before use in the experiments. However, they were more effectively destroyed in aerobic <b>digesters</b> than in anaerobic <b>digesters...</b>|$|R

25|$|After sorting or {{screening}} {{to remove}} any physical contaminants from the feedstock, the material is often shredded, minced, and mechanically or hydraulically pulped to increase the surface area available to microbes in the digesters and, hence, increase the speed of digestion. The maceration of solids {{can be achieved by}} using a chopper pump to transfer the feedstock material into the airtight <b>digester,</b> where anaerobic treatment takes place.|$|E
25|$|The {{anaerobic}} digestion {{process can be}} inhibited by several compounds, affecting {{one or more of}} the bacterial groups responsible for the different organic matter degradation steps. The degree of the inhibition depends, among other factors, on the concentration of the inhibitor in the <b>digester.</b> Potential inhibitors are ammonia, sulfide, light metal ions (Na, K, Mg, Ca, Al), heavy metals, some organics (chlorophenols, halogenated aliphatics, N-substituted aromatics, long chain fatty acids), etc.|$|E
25|$|A second {{consideration}} {{related to}} the feedstock is moisture content. Drier, stackable substrates, such as food and yard waste, are suitable for digestion in tunnel-like chambers. Tunnel-style systems typically have near-zero wastewater discharge, as well, so this style of system has advantages where the discharge of <b>digester</b> liquids are a liability. The wetter the material, the more suitable {{it will be to}} handling with standard pumps instead of energy-intensive concrete pumps and physical means of movement. Also, the wetter the material, the more volume and area it takes up relative to the levels of gas produced. The moisture content of the target feedstock will also affect what type of system is applied to its treatment. To use a high-solids anaerobic <b>digester</b> for dilute feedstocks, bulking agents, such as compost, should be applied to increase the solids content of the input material. Another key consideration is the carbon:nitrogen ratio of the input material. This ratio is the balance of food a microbe requires to grow; the optimal C:N ratio is 20–30:1. Excess N can lead to ammonia inhibition of digestion.|$|E
40|$|The {{increasing}} {{volume of}} wastewater {{in urban areas}} often leads the wastewater treatment plants to intensify their process using existing equipment capacity. This usually results in the digestion of concentrated sludge in anaerobic <b>digesters</b> employed in these plants. This could often lead to ineffective mixing in <b>digesters</b> and ultimately their failure. Therefore, {{it is important to}} understand the hydrodynamics of anaerobic <b>digesters</b> so as to improve their mixing efficiency...|$|R

25|$|Additional {{pre-treatment}} {{can be used}} {{to reduce}} the necessary retention time to produce biogas. For example, certain processes shred the substrates to increase the surface area or use a thermal pretreatment stage (such as pasteurisation) to significantly enhance the biogas output. The pasteurisation process {{can also be used to}} reduce the pathogenic concentration in the digesate leaving the anaerobic <b>digester.</b> Pasteurisation may be achieved by heat treatment combined with maceration of the solids.|$|E
25|$|High solids (dry) digesters are {{designed}} to process materials with a solids content between 25 and 40%. Unlike wet digesters that process pumpable slurries, high solids (dry – stackable substrate) digesters {{are designed}} to process solid substrates without the addition of water. The primary styles of dry digesters are continuous vertical plug flow and batch tunnel horizontal digesters. Continuous vertical plug flow digesters are upright, cylindrical tanks where feedstock is continuously fed {{into the top of}} the <b>digester,</b> and flows downward by gravity during digestion. In batch tunnel digesters, the feedstock is deposited in tunnel-like chambers with a gas-tight door. Neither approach has mixing inside the <b>digester.</b> The amount of pretreatment, such as contaminant removal, depends both upon the nature of the waste streams being processed and the desired quality of the digestate. Size reduction (grinding) is beneficial in continuous vertical systems, as it accelerates digestion, while batch systems avoid grinding and instead require structure (e.g. yard waste) to reduce compaction of the stacked pile. Continuous vertical dry digesters have a smaller footprint due to the shorter effective retention time and vertical design. Wet digesters can be designed to operate in either a high-solids content, with a total suspended solids (TSS) concentration greater than ~20%, or a low-solids concentration less than ~15%.|$|E
25|$|The {{residence}} {{time in a}} <b>digester</b> varies with the amount and type of feed material, and with {{the configuration of the}} digestion system. In a typical two-stage mesophilic digestion, {{residence time}} varies between 15 and 40days, while for a single-stage thermophilic digestion, residence times is normally faster and takes around 14days. The plug-flow nature of some of these systems will mean the full degradation of the material may not have been realised in this timescale. In this event, digestate exiting the system will be darker in colour and will typically have more odour.|$|E

25|$|High solids (wet) <b>digesters</b> {{process a}} thick slurry that {{requires}} more energy input {{to move and}} process the feedstock. The thickness of the material may also lead to associated problems with abrasion. High solids <b>digesters</b> will typically have a lower land requirement due to the lower volumes associated with the moisture. High solids <b>digesters</b> also require correction of conventional performance calculations (e.g. gas production, retention time, kinetics, etc.) originally based on very dilute sewage digestion concepts, since larger fractions of the feedstock mass are potentially convertible to biogas.|$|R
25|$|Low solids (wet) <b>digesters</b> can {{transport}} material {{through the}} system using standard pumps that require significantly lower energy input. Low solids <b>digesters</b> require a larger amount of land than high solids due to the increased volumes associated with the increased liquid-to-feedstock ratio of the <b>digesters.</b> There are benefits associated with operation in a liquid environment, as it enables more thorough circulation of materials and contact between the bacteria and their food. This enables the bacteria to more readily access the substances on which they are feeding, and increases the rate of gas production.|$|R

25|$|Anaerobic digesters were {{originally}} designed for operation using sewage sludge and manures. Sewage and manure are not, however, the material {{with the most}} potential for anaerobic digestion, as the biodegradable material has already had much of the energy content taken out by the animals that produced it. Therefore, many digesters operate with codigestion {{of two or more}} types of feedstock. For example, in a farm-based <b>digester</b> that uses dairy manure as the primary feedstock, the gas production may be significantly increased by adding a second feedstock, e.g., grass and corn (typical on-farm feedstock), or various organic byproducts, such as slaughterhouse waste, fats, oils and grease from restaurants, organic household waste, etc. (typical off-site feedstock).|$|E
25|$|Substrate {{composition}} {{is a major}} factor in determining the methane yield and methane production rates from the digestion of biomass. Techniques to determine the compositional characteristics of the feedstock are available, while parameters such as solids, elemental, and organic analyses are important for <b>digester</b> design and operation. Methane yield can be estimated from the elemental composition of substrate along with an estimate of its degradability (the fraction of the substrate that is converted to biogas in a reactor). In order to predict biogas composition (the relative fractions of methane and carbon dioxide) it is necessary to estimate carbon dioxide partitioning between the aqueous and gas phases, which requires additional information (reactor temperature, pH, and substrate composition) and a chemical speciation model.|$|E

The type of feed may also affect the washing process. The belt filter needs to be washed frequently which consumes large amount of water and time.
