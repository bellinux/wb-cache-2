5000|$|An all-new YZF-R1 for the 2007 {{model year}} was {{announced}} on 8 October 2006. It had an all-new inline four-cylinder engine, {{going back to}} a more conventional four-valves per cylinder, rather than Yamaha's trade mark five-valve Genesis layout. It also had the Yamaha Chip Control Intake (YCC-I) electronic variable-length <b>intake</b> <b>funnel</b> system, Yamaha Chip Control Throttle (YCC-T) fly-by-wire throttle system, slipper-type clutch, all-new aluminum Deltabox frame and swingarm, six-piston radial-mount front brake calipers with 310 mm discs, a wider radiator, and M1 styling on the new large ram-air ports in the front fairing. There were no major changes for 2008. Power at the rear wheel was [...] @ 10,160 rpm.|$|E
5000|$|The <b>intake</b> <b>funnels</b> on the Weber carburetors on 23B (and the 23C) were {{housed in}} a [...] "cold air box" [...] which {{received}} fresh air from two oval holes cut out on the top side of the rear body behind the driver.|$|R
5000|$|Air is {{released}} through 10 distinctive hexagonal {{holes in the}} engine cover, while two <b>intakes</b> <b>funnel</b> cool air into the mid-mounted engine compartment. Lamborghini claims a 0-100 km/h (0-62 mph) acceleration time of just 2.5 seconds, and top speed of over 210 mph. Lamborghini sources said that [...] "...they will sell it in very small numbers, in 2013." ...|$|R
50|$|For 2009, Kawasaki {{dramatically}} {{changed the}} appearance of the ZX-6R to match the more angular look of the ZX-10R. Kawasaki claims the new ZX-6R is 10 kg lighter than the previous model. The greatest changes for 2009 were the redesign of the exhaust, now carried low and not requiring the thick under-seat construction of 2008 and especially the introduction of the Showa Big Piston Fork (BPF) suspension for a more progressive brake-dive. The 2010 ZX-6R is changing once more with an improved engine and slipper clutch. The exhaust pre-chamber has more space and also limits exhaust noise giving the rider a smoother ride. New double bore <b>intake</b> <b>funnels</b> features two available heights which gives performance upgrades in both high and low engine speeds. The front seat is now lower.|$|R
25|$|The luxurious {{interiors}} {{were designed}} in Art DÃ©co and Streamline Moderne style. Many sculptures and wall paintings made allusions to Normandy, {{the province of}} France for which Normandie was named. Drawings and photographs show a series of vast public rooms of great elegance. Normandies voluminous interior spaces were made possible by having the <b>funnel</b> <b>intakes</b> split to pass {{along the sides of}} the ship, rather than straight upward. French architect Roger-Henri Expert {{was in charge of the}} overall decorative scheme.|$|R
50|$|SheerWind's INVELOX {{technology}} {{was developed by}} Dr. Daryoush Allaei. The invention is really not a turbine, rather a wind capturing and delivery system to a turbine. In a sense, INVELOX is a wind injection system, much like a fuel injection system for cars. It works by accelerating the wind. A large <b>intake</b> captures wind, <b>funnels</b> it down using tapered pipes leading to a concentrator that ends in a Venturi section and finally wind exits from a diffuser. Turbine(s) are placed inside the Venturi section of the INVELOX. Inside the Venturi the dynamic pressure is very high while the static pressure is low. The Turbine converts dynamic pressure or kinetic energy to mechanical rotation and thereby to electrical power using a generator. The device has been constructed and tested, but also criticized for lack of efficiency. , prototypes are being installed, while another is inoperable.|$|R
5000|$|Strasbourg, {{on which}} the {{commanding}} officer, Captain Louis Edmond Collinet, had previously ordered to carefully prepare to cast off, was luckily near missed by the 15 in shells of the British guns. At 18.00, a 15-inch salvo fell where her stern had been one minute previously. Escorted by five destroyers, she headed to the pass, then steered northeast. Strasbourg was then increasing speed from 15 knots to 28 knots but was hampered by damage to an air <b>intake</b> on the <b>funnel,</b> which had been blocked by a piece of flying masonry from the jetty. However she escaped the pursuit by [...] and Fairey Swordfish torpedo bombers of [...] until about 21.30. At this moment, all thirty boiler room 2 personnel were found lying unconscious, overcome by {{the heat and the}} toxic fumes, and three petty officers and two seamen had died. Passing alongside the western coast of Sardinia, Strasbourg reached Toulon, in the evening of the following day.|$|R
