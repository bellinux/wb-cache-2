40|$|In most {{northern}} {{temperate climate}} anchor ice is common during winter time and {{plays a key}} role when considering in stream winter conditions. The underlying mechanisms that <b>form</b> <b>anchor</b> ice and the effect of anchor ice on the flow regime is not very well known for steep streams. This paper presents results from studies on anchor ice development in two Norwegian rivers with different hydraulic characteristics. Two rivers in middle Norway have been selected as study sites. River Stavilla is a small, steep unregulated stream with coarse substrate and river Orkla is a larger river with lower gradient. River Orkla is regulated for hydro power and thereby provides an unstable ice regime with frequent anchor ice episodes during winter. In river Stavilla we found anchor ice dams as an important mechanism for ice cover formation. The anchor ice dams formed in areas with large substrate/shallow water and reduced the water velocity in the steep section which trigged ice cover formation. In river Orkla anchor ice was produced at several locations over the study reach linked to local hydraulic and topographical conditions. The overall extent of the ice was controlled by climatic conditions with large carpets forming both in riffles and runs during the coldest nights. Most of the ice was released during mid day through the entire study period. Both studies show that anchor ice can be extensive and an important factor when analyzing ice formation, ice regime and flow conditions in small and large streams and that it should be included in winter time in-stream flow analysis in rivers in cold climate. ...|$|E

40|$|Uridine insertion/deletion RNA editing in kinetoplastid {{mitochondria}} corrects encoded frameshifts in mRNAs. The {{genetic information}} for editing resides in small guide RNAs (gRNAs), which <b>form</b> <b>anchor</b> duplexes just downstream of an editing site and mediate editing {{within a single}} editing “block. ” Many mRNAs require multiple gRNAs; the observed overall 3 ′ to 5 ′ polarity of editing {{is determined by the}} formation of upstream mRNA anchors by downstream editing. Hel 61, a mitochondrial DEAD-box protein, was previously shown to be involved in RNA editing, but the functional role was not clear. Here we report that down-regulation of Hel 61 [renamed REH 1 (RNA editing helicase 1) ] expression in Trypanosoma brucei selectively affects editing mediated by two or more overlapping gRNAs but has no effect on editing within a single block. Down-regulation produces an increased abundance of the gRNA/edited mRNA duplex for the first editing block of the A 6 mRNA. Recombinant REH 1 has an ATP-dependent double strand RNA unwinding activity in vitro with a model gRNA-mRNA duplex. These data indicate that REH 1 is involved in gRNA displacement either directly by unwinding the gRNA/edited mRNA duplex or indirectly, to allow the 5 ′ adjacent upstream gRNA to form an anchor duplex with the edited mRNA to initiate another block of editing. Purified tagged REH 1 is associated with the RNA editing core complex by RNA linkers and a colocalization of REH 1, REL 1, and two kinetoplast ribosomal proteins with the kinetoplast DNA was observed by immunofluorescence, suggesting that editing, transcription, and translation may be functionally linked...|$|E
40|$|BACKGROUND:Sequencing of cDNA {{libraries}} for {{the development}} of expressed sequence tags (ESTs) {{as well as for the}} discovery of simple sequence repeats (SSRs) has been a common method of developing microsatellites or SSR-based markers. In this research, our objective was to further sequence and develop common bean microsatellites from leaf and root cDNA libraries derived from the Andean gene pool accession G 19833 and the Mesoamerican gene pool accession DOR 364, mapping parents of a commonly used reference map. The root libraries were made from high and low phosphorus treated plants. RESULTS:A total of 3, 123 EST sequences from leaf and root cDNA libraries were screened and used for direct simple sequence repeat discovery. From these EST sequences we found 184 microsatellitesthe majority containing tri-nucleotide motifs, many of which were GC rich (ACC, AGC and AGG in particular). Di-nucleotide motif microsatellites were about half as common as the tri-nucleotide motif microsatellites but most of these were AGn microsatellites with a moderate number of ATn microsatellites in root ESTs followed by few ACn and no GCn microsatellites. Out of the 184 new SSR loci, 120 new microsatellite markers were developed in the BMc (Bean Microsatellites from cDNAs) series and these were evaluated for their capacity to distinguish bean diversity in a germplasm panel of 18 genotypes. We developed a database with images of the microsatellites and their polymorphism information content (PIC), which averaged 0. 310 for polymorphic markers. CONCLUSIONS:The present study produced information about microsatellite frequency in root and leaf tissues of two important genotypes for common bean genomics: namely G 19833, the Andean genotype selected for whole genome shotgun sequencing from race Peru, and DOR 364 a race Mesoamerica subgroup 2 genotype that is a small-red seeded, released variety in Central America. Both race Peru and Mesoamerica subgroup 2 (small red beans) have been understudied in comparison to race Nueva Granada and Mesoamerica subgroup 1 (black beans) both with regards to gene expression and as sources of markers. However, we found few differences between SSR type and frequency between the G 19833 leaf and DOR 364 root tissue-derived ESTs. Overall, our work adds to the analysis of microsatellite frequency evaluation for common bean and provides a new set of 120 BMc markers which combined with the 248 previously developed BMc markers brings the total in this series to 368 markers. Once we include BMd markers, which are derived from GenBank sequences, the current total of gene-based markers from our laboratory surpasses 500 markers. These markers are basic for studies of the transcriptome of common bean and can <b>form</b> <b>anchor</b> points for genetic mapping studies in the future...|$|E
40|$|Streams in cold {{regions are}} {{characterized}} by unique hydrological processes that control flow regime and water levels. One {{of the most important}} processes is the formation, growth and melting of different types of ice in and around the stream channel during winter. River ice controls major hydrologic events such as winter floods with magnitudes and frequencies often greater than those created by open-water conditions. While river management in northern countries has already recognized high risk of ice damages, the focus of the risk assessment has been mostly aimed towards the local economy; the ecological role of river ice has been less acknowledged. Along rivers in boreal Sweden, riparian vegetation has developed specific zonation with height and age of the plants increasing the further away they are from the stream channel. On lower levels the vegetation is often comprised of short-lived plants, such as annuals and biennials whereas more permanent woody vegetation is found at higher levels. This zonation has most often been explained by the resilience of different growth forms to the inundation regimes, such as the spring flood in northern systems. Within this framework, I investigated which factors drive the ice formation and how ice and ice-induced floods affect riparian and in-stream vegetation. A 3 -year survey was conducted of ice formation and vegetation along 25 stream reaches and a set of experiments were used to evaluate ice as a disturbance agent. Reaches far away from lake outlets which had a low input of groundwater and a high velocity and stream power were most prone to <b>form</b> <b>anchor</b> ice, but many other factors also influenced ice formation. Streams with anchor ice experienced more frequent flooding of the riparian vegetation during winter. Our findings suggests that ice and winter floods favour diversity and create habitat heterogeneity for riparian species. On a community level, woody plants such as evergreen dwarf shrubs are eliminated when flooded during winter, opening up patches for other species to colonize, creating a dynamic riparian understory community. Significant changes in river ice conditions could develop with projected changes in climate which would have important geomorphologic, ecological and socio-economic impacts. One implication of climate change could be less ice disturbance and consequently a riparian vegetation in cold regions that slowly changes from forb to dwarf-shrub dominated with a subsequent decrease in species richness. Changes in species diversity and abundance of groups of species related to changes in ice formation could potentially cascade into riparian and in-stream processes such as nutrient cycling, litter decomposition and organism dispersal...|$|E
