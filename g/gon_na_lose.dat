The analysis {{is based on a}} set of 600 years long experiments performed with a state-of-the-art coupled general circulation model (CGCM) with the 1990 reference value of atmospheric CO 2 multiplied by 4, 8 and 16. Extreme increases in atmospheric CO 2 concentration have been applied to force the climate system towards stable states with different thermo-dynamical properties and analyze how the different resulting oceanic stratification and diffusion affect the Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation (AMOC). The AMOC weakens in response to the induced warming with distinctive features in the extreme case: a southward shift of convective sites and the formation of a density front at mid-latitudes. The analysis of the density fluxes reveals that <b>NA</b> <b>loses</b> density at high latitudes and gains it southward of 40 °N mainly due to the haline contribution. Our results indicate that the most important processes that control the AMOC are active in the high latitudes and are related to the stability of the water column. The increased ocean stratification stabilizes the ocean interior leading to a decreased vertical diffusivity, a reduction in the formation of deep water and a weaker circulation. In particular, the deep convection collapses mainly in the Labrador Sea {{as a consequence of the}} water column stratification under high latitudes freshening...|$|R

40|$|Abstract [...] Infrared (IR) spectra in the {{fundamental}} and near-IR regions {{were obtained for}} Na-saturated Wyoming montmoriUonite and reduced-charge Na/Li-saturated Wyoming montmorillonites hydrated un-der water vapor at 50 % RH and dehydrated under vacuum. For the Na-montmorillonite, changes in the intensities ofthe structural OH-bending modes, particularly that of the MgA 1 OH group, were observed as the clay was dehydrated. This result was interpreted as evidence that exchangeable <b>Na</b> ions <b>lose</b> solvation water and settle into the ditrigonal cavities on the clay surface as it becomes desiccated. For the Na/Li-montmorillonites, the structural OH-bending modes also decreased inIR intensity because of Li § migration into the octahedral sheet. The fundamental IR spectra of D 20 adsorbed by the montmorillonites showed characteristic absorptions at 2685, 2510, 2400, and 1205 cm 1 that decreased in intensity proportionally to the cation-exchange capacity. This result, along with corroborating data from X-ray powder diffractograms and from near-IR diffuse reflectance spectra of H 20 adsorbed by the clays, suggest that he exchangeable cations on Na-montmoriUonite dissociated from the clay surface as it hydrated and {{played a significant role}} in organizing the structure of adsorbed water at low water contents...|$|R

40|$|Fruits of {{persimmon}} (Diospyros kaki Thunb.) accumulate {{large amounts}} of proanthocyanidins (PAs) {{in the early stages}} of development. Astringent (A) -type fruits remain rich in soluble PAs even after they reach full-mature stage, whereas non-astringent (<b>NA)</b> -type fruits <b>lose</b> these compounds before full maturation. As a first step to elucidate the mechanism of PA accumulation in this non-model species, we used suppression subtractive hybridization to identify transcripts accumulating differently in young fruits of A- and NA-type. Interestingly, only a few clones involved in PA biosynthesis were identified in A–NA libraries. Represented by multiple clones were those encoding a novel 1 -Cys peroxiredoxin and a new member of family 1 glycosyltransferases. Quantitative RT-PCR analyses confirmed correlation of the amount of PAs and accumulation of transcripts encoding these proteins in young persimmon fruits. Furthermore, the new family 1 glycosyltransferase was produced in Escherichia coli and shown to efficiently catalyze galactosylation at 3 -hydroxyl groups of several anthocyanidins and flavonols. These findings suggest a complex mechanism of PA accumulation in persimmon fruits...|$|R
40|$|Proanthocyanidins (PAs) are {{secondary}} metabolites {{that contribute}} to the protection of the plant and also to the taste of the fruit, mainly through astringency. Persimmon (Diospyros kaki) is unique in being able to accumulate abundant PAs in the fruit flesh. Fruits of the nonastringent (<b>NA)</b> -type mutants <b>lose</b> their ability to produce PA at an early stage of fruit development, while those of the normal astringent (A) type remain rich in PA until fully ripened. The expression of many PA pathway genes was coincidentally terminated in the NA type at an early stage of fruit development. The five genes encoding the Myb transcription factor were isolated from an A-type cultivar (Kuramitsu). One of them, DkMyb 4, showed an expression pattern synchronous to that of the PA pathway genes in A- and NA-type fruit flesh. The ectopic expression of DkMyb 4 in kiwifruit (Actinidia deliciosa) induced PA biosynthesis but not anthocyanin biosynthesis. The suppression of DkMyb 4 in persimmon calluses caused a substantial down-regulation of the PA pathway genes and PA biosynthesis. Furthermore, analysis of the DNA-binding ability of DkMyb 4 showed that it directly binds to the MYBCORE cis-motif in the promoters of the some PA pathway genes. All our results indicate that DkMyb 4 acts as a regulator of PA biosynthesis in persimmon and, therefore, suggest that the reduction in the DkMyb 4 expression causes the NA-type-specific down-regulation of PA biosynthesis and resultant NA trait...|$|R
40|$|Krajem šezdesetih godina 20. stoljeća na ulazu u ninsku luku pronađeni su dobro očuvani ostatci dviju srednjovjekovnih brodica. Na inicijativu voditelja istraživanja Zdenka Brusića i konzervatora Božidara Vilhara oba su plovna objekta izvađena iz mora, konzervirana i izložena u Muzeju ninske baštine, čime je projekt zadobio sustavni karakter te donedavno predstavljao jedini arheološki projekt usmjeren na sustavno istraživanje i obradu podmorskih nalaza. Unatoč stručnim i znanstvenim radovima u kojima su brodovi sumarno obrađeni, detaljna objava nalaza tek predstoji. Stoga je 2008. započeo rad na dopuni postojeće dokumentacije, a jedan od prvih koraka bio je određivanje vrsta drvene građe korištene za izradu brodskih konstrukcija. U radu se ukratko iznose rezultati dosadašnjih istraživanja i provedenih analiza, te upozorava <b>na</b> alarmantno <b>loše</b> stanje nalaza. Two boats (Nin 1 and Nin 2) were {{discovered}} in the 1960 s {{at the entrance to}} Nin harbor, fifteen km northwest of Zadar. In 1974 the boats were lifted from the sea bed, were preserved in PEG and presented to the public in the Museum of Nin Heritage. According to radiocarbon evidence the boats date to the eleventh/twelfth century. They were about 8 m long and were built in skeleton first technique. The frames and planks were fastened together with nails and treenails. Instead of a central keel they were provided with a keel plank and two parallel bilge keels, which run below the garboards. A wooden base for the mast step was also found. A sampling of the wooden elements to identify wood species was realized in 2008. Sixty-one samples were taken from various elements of the Nin 1 frames, futtocks, stem post, bilge keel, planks and central plank), and 91 samples were taken from Nin 2 (frames, planks, bilge keel and central plank). The majority of the components from both wrecks were made of Quercus petraea. In Nin 1, 43 of 61 samples were of Quercus petraea, and 12 samples were of Quercus cerris. One plank was made of Platanus orientalis, another of Ulmus campestris. Four analyzed components were identified as Abies alba and are probably modern insertions in the reconstruction. In Nin 2, 84 of 91 samples were made of Quercus petraea, 6 of Quercus cerris. One plank was identified as Ulmus campestris. The native distribution area of Quercus petraea and Quercus cerris coincide. Both oak species are very common in Croatia and the Balkans. Anatomical features indicate that both species of oak that were used as construction timber for the Nin boats grew in a region characterized by high mountains and very cold winters, resulting in trees which are better fit for shipbuilding because of their strength and lack of insect and fungal damage. While it is logical to assume that local boatyards building small boats would have exploited local timber sources, or whatever was locally available, it is possible that such timbers were depleted in this region, thus forcing the procurement of timber from mountainous areas...|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT The {{membrane}} potential of frog sartorius muscle fibers in a C 1 - and Na-free Ringer's solution when sucrose replaces NaC 1 {{is about the}} same as that in normal Ringer's solution. The K + efflux is also about the same in the two solutions but muscles lose K and PO 4 in sucrose Ringer's solutions. The {{membrane potential}} in sucrose Ringer's solution is equal to that given by the Nernst equation for a K + electrode, when corrections are made for the activity coefficients for K + inside and outside the fiber. For a muscle in normal Ringer's solution, the measured membrane potential is within a few millivolts of Ex. This finding is incompatible with a 1 :I coupled Na-K pump. It is consistent with either no coupling of Na efflux to K influx, or a coupling ratio of 3 or greater. The resting potential of frog sartorius muscle fibers, equilibrated with normal Ringer's solution (2. 5 mM K +) is about 10 mv below the value deduced from the ratio of K + concentrations inside and outside the membrane (Nastuk and Hodgkin, 1950; Nastuk, 1953). It has been suggested that the membrane potential fails to reach E~, the potassium equilibrium potential, because the fiber is not in a steady-state with respect to Na + and K+. This tendency of fibers to gain <b>Na</b> + and <b>lose</b> K + has been treated by Hodgldn and Katz (1949) by applying the constant field theory of Goldman (1943) and leads to an expression for membrane potential given as Equation 1.
