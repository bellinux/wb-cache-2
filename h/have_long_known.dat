25|$|Cormac Ó Gráda, {{referencing}} {{the work}} of W. A. MacArthur, writes that specialists <b>have</b> <b>long</b> <b>known</b> that the Irish death tables were inaccurate. As a result, Ó Gráda says that the tables undercount the number of deaths, because information was gathered from surviving householders having to look back over the previous 10 years, and death and emigration had cleared away entire families, leaving few or no survivors to answer the census questions.|$|E
25|$|The Koine Greek terms {{used in the}} New Testament of the {{structure}} on which Jesus died are stauros (σταυρός) and xylon (ξύλον). Those words, which can refer to many different things, do not indicate the precise shape of {{the structure}}. Scholars <b>have</b> <b>long</b> <b>known</b> that the Greek word stauros and the Latin word crux did not uniquely mean a cross. They have known too that the words had that meaning also, and so have not considered necessarily incorrect the traditional picture of a cross with transom.|$|E
25|$|A {{magnetic}} compass points to magnetic north pole, which is approximately 1,000 {{miles from the}} true geographic North Pole. A {{magnetic compass}}'s user can determine true North by finding the magnetic north and then correcting for variation and deviation. Variation {{is defined as the}} angle between the direction of true (geographic) north and the direction of the meridian between the magnetic poles. Variation values for most of the oceans had been calculated and published by 1914. Deviation refers to the response of the compass to local magnetic fields caused by the presence of iron and electric currents; one can partly compensate for these by careful location of the compass and the placement of compensating magnets under the compass itself. Mariners <b>have</b> <b>long</b> <b>known</b> that these measures do not completely cancel deviation; hence, they performed an additional step by measuring the compass bearing of a landmark with a known magnetic bearing. They then pointed their ship to the next compass point and measured again, graphing their results. In this way, correction tables could be created, which would be consulted when compasses were used when traveling in those locations.|$|E

2500|$|Researchers <b>have</b> <b>long</b> <b>known</b> that astrocytes express water {{channels}} called aquaporins.

Aquaporins are membrane-bound channels that play critical roles in regulating the flux of water into and out of cells. [...] Relative to simple diffusion, the presence of aquaporins in biological membranes facilitates a 3–10 fold increase in water permeability.|$|E
2500|$|Winemakers <b>have</b> <b>long</b> <b>known</b> {{that some}} fermentations ran more {{predictable}} and [...] "healthier" [...] if pomace (the solid skins, seeds and remains left after pressing) from another wine {{was added to}} the batch. This is a method still used today to make the Italian wine Ripasso. In 14th century Tuscany, the technique of governo used in some of the earliest Chiantis involved adding dried grapes to the batch. While that also added sugar both methods provided extra nitrogen and other nutrients still available in the skins and seeds.|$|E

2500|$|While medieval history testifies amply to {{the intense}} {{persecution}} of Jews by Christians {{at the time}} of the Crusades, there are difficulties with the legend that it was composed by Amnon. Not least of these is its portrayal of Amnon as an illustrious Torah giant, while Jewish history of that period provides no record of a 'Rav Amnon of Mainz' at all. It seems unlikely that a person of such tremendous stature would be remembered only in a single legend. Scholars <b>have</b> <b>long</b> <b>known</b> that there is no historical foundation for the story of Rabbi Amnon and that this story may have been inspired or derived from the Christian legend associated with Saint Emmeram of Regensburg. Moreover, the discovery of the Unetaneh Tokef prayer within the earliest strata of the Cairo Geniza materials, dating well before the 11th century, makes it almost impossible that the prayer could have been composed as the legend claims.|$|E

[...] At the banquet, however, they got into an argument, with Emperor Liezu accusing Song of being ungrateful and of comparing the emperor to the vicious King Goujian of Yue, and Song admitting to making such a remark and commenting that the emperor could kill him if the emperor wanted. [...] The next day, Emperor Liezu wrote a personal letter to Song, stating, [...] "You, Zisong, <b>have</b> <b>long</b> <b>known</b> our temper. [...] How can it {{be the case that}} when we were young we were so close to each other, but in old age we hate each other?" [...] He subsequently made Song the military governor of Zhennan. [...] After Song arrived at Zhennan, he built a large mansion for himself and lived luxuriously, purportedly at the people's detriment. [...] He often ruled on matters while wearing a silk robe that Emperor Liezu gave him.|$|E

2500|$|By 1860, {{conditions}} at Pohick Church had deteriorated {{to such a}} state that {{it is unclear whether}} or not the building remained a consecrated house of worship {{at the dawn of the}} American Civil War. With its proximity to Washington, D.C., the building was quickly embroiled in the fighting that rocked Northern Virginia. although in that year a plan was formed by a clergyman from Fairfax, Reverend R. T. Brown, to return the building to active service, a plan which was quashed by the beginning of the conflict. The 2nd Michigan Volunteers, under the command of General Samuel P. Heintzelman, raided the church on November 12, 1861. Lieutenant Charles B. Haydon was outraged at the men's behavior, describing it thus: At 8 ½ A.M. we reached the church 12 miles out. Pohick Church is a brick building built in 1773. Gen. Washington contributed to building it & was a frequent attendant. It has a very ancient look & one would suppose that it might be sacred enough to be secure. I <b>have</b> <b>long</b> <b>known</b> that the Mich 2nd had no fear or reverence as a general thing for God or the places where he is worshiped but I had hoped that the memory of Gen. Washington might protect almost anything with which it was associated. I believe our soldiers would have torn the church down in 2 days. They were all over it in less than 10 minutes tearing off the ornaments, splitting the woodwork and pews, knocking the brick to pieces & everything else they could get at. They wanted pieces to carry away [...] [...] [...] A more absolute set of vandals than our men can not be found on the face of the earth. As true as I am living I believe they would steal Washington's coffin if they could get to it. Private Robert Sneden visited the church in January 1862. He painted a watercolor of the encampents around the building and described its condition in his journal:We reached Pohick Church about 4 pm in a snow storm [...] [...] [...] It was a substantial two story brick structure with white marble, quoins and trimmings and old colonial gambrel roof [...] [...] [...] Here Washington attended service, with all the old first families of the time [...] [...] [...] He drove from Mount Vernon to church in his coach with four horses, tandem fashion as did the others. Now the church was in ruinous condition. Windows were all broken out, doors gone, pews nearly gone, being used for firewood by our pickets. The ceilings broken by the rain coming through the roof, walls discolored black by smoke, etc. The mahogany pulpit was half cut away and carried off for relics, while the cornerstones had been unearthed and the contents carried off. Washington had lain this stone in 1765 [...] and the soldiers who got it out must have found valuable relics. There was not much left for the relic hunters now even the sconces and door knobs and hinges were gone.Confederate General J. Johnston Pettigrew also recorded visiting Pohick Church in his wartime journal.|$|E
