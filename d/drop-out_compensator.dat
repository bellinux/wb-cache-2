5000|$|A <b>drop-out</b> <b>compensator</b> is {{an error}} {{concealment}} device that was {{commonly used in}} the analog video era to hide brief RF signal [...] "drop-outs" [...] on videotape playback caused by imperfections in or damage to the tape's magnetic coating. Most compensators worked by repeating earlier video scan-lines over short periods of signal loss; one early such system, [...] "Mincom" [...] {{was developed in the}} 1960s by the Minnesota Mining and Manufacturing Company, the company now known as 3M. Because of the high cost of the 3M device at the time, BBC R&D engineers developed a simpler, less expensive unit based on a sample-and-hold technique for in-house use.|$|E
5000|$|In March 1984, Pioneer {{introduced}} the first consumer player with a solid-state laser, the LD-700. It {{was also the}} first LD player to load from the front and not the top. One year earlier Hitachi introduced an expensive industrial player with a laser diode, but the player, which had poor picture quality due to an inadequate <b>drop-out</b> <b>compensator,</b> was made only in limited quantities. After Pioneer released the LD-700, gas lasers were no longer used in consumer players, despite their advantages, although Philips continued to use gas lasers in their industrial units until 1985. Helium-Neon gas lasers had a shorter-wavelength laser that created a much smaller spot on the disc, leading to better tracking of imperfectly manufactured discs, such as an off-center hole punch or slightly eccentric tracks. The use of a solid state laser diode necessitated the introduction of the tilt-servo mechanism in LD players; this physically tilted the entire laser table, keeping it parallel with the disc, thus ensuring the larger laser beam spot was always perfectly circular and helping to reduce or eliminate crosstalk on warped CLV discs. In addition, the gas laser was less sensitive to external vibration, a must in certain industrial environments, and generated less photon-shot noise than the solid-state laser diode, resulting in a cleaner, less [...] "busy" [...] on-screen image.|$|E
5000|$|Dedicated <b>drop-out</b> <b>compensators</b> were {{eventually}} superseded by {{the incorporation of}} drop-out compensation functionality into timebase correctors based on analog-to-digital conversion and digital line stores.|$|R
50|$|The {{advent of}} {{compressed}} digital video systems finally eliminated {{the need for}} line-based <b>drop-out</b> <b>compensators.</b> Most low-level media errors, such as those caused by tape damage or imperfections, are now dealt with by forward error correction techniques, and those which overwhelm the FEC layer are typically too severe to remedy using simple line-based error concealment techniques, because damage to the compressed bitstream will often damage {{large parts of the}} video image. However, since occasional signal drop-outs can still occur, either through severe tape damage or because of packet loss in packetized video transmission, modern error concealment techniques that are aware {{of the structure of the}} compressed video format have been developed to deal with these.|$|R
