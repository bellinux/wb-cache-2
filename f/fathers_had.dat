5|$|Maria Komnene {{conducted}} the negotiations for {{the marriage of}} Alice to Hugh I of Cyprus, Aimery of Lusignan's eldest surviving son and successor, {{in accordance with the}} agreement their <b>fathers</b> <b>had</b> reached. Since the marriage of Alice's mother and Hugh I's father made them step-sister and step-brother, a special dispensation was needed. This was granted by Pope Innocent III. Blanche of Navarre supplied Alice's dowry as she sought to ensure that Alice would stay in Cyprus rather than attempting to lay claim to Champagne and Brie. To strengthen her son's position, Blanche also persuaded Philip II of France in 1209 to promise that he would not allow anyone to challenge Theobald IV's right to the two counties before Theobald reached the age of majority.|$|E
5|$|Life {{under the}} Japanese changed rapidly {{as many of}} the {{traditional}} structures were replaced by a military power. Aborigines who wished to improve their status looked to education rather than headhunting as the new form of power. Those who learned to work with the Japanese and follow their customs would be better suited to lead villages. The Japanese encouraged aborigines to maintain traditional costumes and selected customs that were not considered detrimental to society, but invested much time and money in efforts to eliminate traditions deemed unsavory by Japanese culture, including tattooing. By the mid-1930s as Japan's empire was reaching its zenith, the colonial government began a political socialization program designed to enforce Japanese customs, rituals and a loyal Japanese identity upon the aborigines. By the end of World War II, aborigines whose <b>fathers</b> <b>had</b> been killed in pacification campaigns were volunteering to serve in Special Units and if need be die for the Emperor of Japan. The Japanese colonial experience left an indelible mark on many older aborigines who maintained an admiration for the Japanese long after their departure in 1945.|$|E

25|$|Milwaukee's {{founding}} <b>fathers</b> <b>had</b> {{a vision}} for the city: they knew it was perfectly situated as a port city, a center for collecting and distributing produce. Many of the new immigrants who were pouring into the new state of Wisconsin {{during the middle of the}} 19th century were wheat farmers. By 1860, Wisconsin was the second ranked wheat-growing state in the country and Milwaukee shipped more wheat than any place in the world. Railroads were needed to transport all this grain from the wheat fields of Wisconsin to Milwaukee's harbor. Improvements in railways at the time made this possible.|$|E
25|$|When in Ateneo Larramendi {{embarked}} on Catholic propaganda, trying {{to confront the}} growing secularization tide. In 1906 he addressed Cortes with legal note, aimed against the plan to introduce civil marriages; in 1910 he published Cómo defendernos de las escuelas laicas, a booklet aimed against the concept of public, secular, free and obligatory school, launched by the republican groupings; Larramendi claimed that <b>fathers</b> <b>had</b> the right to bring up their children the way they wanted. Campaigning against secular education carried him {{as far as to}} Andalusia, though his principal battleground were various public fora of the capital; apart from the Ateneo he spoke also in theatres and apart from education discussed also Catholic syndicalism and episodes of public blasphemy, soon growing to president of the Madrid branch of Juventud Jaimista.|$|E
25|$|The first {{priority}} when beginning a settlement was {{the location and}} construction of the church (iglesia). The majority of mission sanctuaries were oriented on a roughly east–west axis to {{take the best advantage}} of the sun's position for interior illumination; the exact alignment depended on the geographic features of the particular site. Once the spot for the church was selected, its position would be marked and the remainder of the mission complex would be laid out. The priests' quarters, refectory, convento, workshops, kitchens, soldiers' and servants' living quarters, storerooms, and other ancillary chambers were usually grouped around a walled, open court or patio (often {{in the form of a}} quadrangle) inside which religious celebrations and other festive events often took place. The cuadrángulo was rarely a perfect square because the <b>Fathers</b> <b>had</b> no surveying instruments at their disposal and simply measured off all dimensions by foot. In the event of an attack by hostile forces the mission's inhabitants could take refuge within the quadrangle.|$|E

25|$|Most Luftwaffe {{leaders were}} born {{well before the}} First World War and the army {{preferred}} officer candidates from the Real Gymnasien high school, that emphasized sciences and modern languages. However, because {{of the social and}} political situation, they looked for candidates from the Humanistische Gymnasien, a high school enrolled with sons of families of the higher classes, of the bourgeoisie and aristocracy, and which stood against the egalitarian and democratic ideas of the lower, more technical-minded worker and craftsmen. The Humanistische Gymnasien produced graduates with a classical and all-round education, that was less focused on specialisation and technology. However, many of those graduates from the Humanistische Gymnasien eventually became famous scientists. 75 percent of the later Luftwaffe generals came from upper middle class officer families, and only 17 percent of the generals’ <b>fathers</b> <b>had</b> technical professions. About 5 percent of Luftwaffe generals and general staff officers obtained technical degrees during their academic training. Most of these officiers could not familiarise themselves with higher technology, because Germany was not allowed to have aircraft and heavy weapons {{during the time of the}} Weimar Republic.|$|E

500|$|In {{the early}} 4th century, Constantine I {{became the first}} emperor to convert to Christianity.

The emperor Julian made a short-lived attempt to revive traditional and Hellenistic religion and to affirm the special status of Judaism, but in 380 (Edict of Thessalonica), under Theodosius I Christianity became the official state church of the Roman Empire, to the exclusion of all others. From the 2nd century onward, the Church <b>Fathers</b> <b>had</b> begun to condemn the diverse religions practised throughout the Empire collectively as [...] "pagan." [...] Pleas for religious tolerance from traditionalists such as the senator Symmachus (d. 402) were rejected, and Christian monotheism became a feature of Imperial domination. Christian heretics as well as non-Christians were subject to exclusion from public life or persecution, but Rome's original religious hierarchy and many aspects of its ritual influenced Christian forms, and many pre-Christian beliefs and practices survived in Christian festivals and local traditions.|$|E
