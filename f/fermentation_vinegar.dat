40|$|In industry, vinegar {{is widely}} {{produced}} by submerged <b>fermentation.</b> Although <b>vinegar</b> production is established {{on the large}} scale, small scale culture methods, in which bioprocesses are typically developed or optimized nowadays, are missing. To reinvestigate the established fermentation process, {{the aim of this}} thesis was the development of suitable small scale culture methods and systems for submerged <b>vinegar</b> <b>fermentation.</b> Since obligatory aerobic acetic acid bacteria in vinegar production suffer even from short oxygen depletion during traditional precultivation steps, the reproducibility of results in the main culture is insufficient. A reproducible small scale cultivation method for obligatory aerobic acetic acid bacteria at industrially relevant high ethanol and acetic acid concentrations was established by ensuring constant oxygen transfer in the whole inoculation procedure. An acetic acid bacteria preculture was drained off from a laboratory-scale bioreactor into an aerated mobile bubble column and transferred to an already shaking RAMOS shake flask device. Whereas the respiration curves of the traditionally processed acetic acid bacteria cultures were low and greatly diverged, those of the preculture transferred first into the bubble column and then into the already shaking flasks were high and coincided with one another. Shutting off aeration in the mobile bubble column led to a rapid decrease in bacterial activity. In conclusion, traditional precultivation steps are not suitable for obligatory aerobic acetic acid bacteria in <b>vinegar</b> <b>fermentation.</b> Maintaining constant oxygen transfer is necessary to guarantee the reproducibility of main culture experiments with such bacteria. In industry, vinegar is produced in repeated batch or repeated fed-batch processes. As yet, there was no small scale culture system for repeated batch bioprocesses. Therefore, a new shaken culture system for parallel repeated batch <b>vinegar</b> <b>fermentation</b> was explored. A new operation mode – the flushing repeated batch – was developed. Parallel repeated batch <b>vinegar</b> <b>fermentation</b> could be established in shaken overflow vessels in an automated operation with only one pump per reactor. This flushing repeated batch was theoretically investigated and empirically tested. The ethanol concentration was monitored during repeated batch fermentation by semiconductor gas sensors. The switch from one ethanol substrate lot to different ethanol substrate lots resulted in prolonged lag phases and durations of the first batches. In the subsequent batches the length of the fermentations decreased considerably. This decrease in the respective lag phases indicates an adaptation of the acetic acid bacteria mixed culture to the specific ethanol substrate lot. Consequently, flushing repeated batch fermentations on small scale are valuable for screening fermentation conditions and, thereby, improving bioprocesses in terms of robustness, stability and productivity. To improve the shaken repeated batch system, the system was expanded with electrochemical oxygen sensors. The measurement of the oxygen partial pressure in the headspace of the shaken reactors allowed the compensation of the oxygen partial pressure dependency of the semiconductor ethanol gas sensors. Furthermore, the oxygen transfer rate in the repeated batch fermentation system could be determined during cultivation. The oxygen transfer rate was with 28 mmol/L/h in the same range as in batch cultivations in the RAMOS device. To calibrate the oxygen sensors online during cultivation, a method applying gas flow change was theoretically considered and practically implemented. After the <b>vinegar</b> <b>fermentation</b> was accomplished in milliliter shake flask scale in batch as well as repeated batch mode, the <b>vinegar</b> <b>fermentation</b> was scaled-down to microliter scale in microtiter plates of this thesis. In order to minimize evaporation losses of ethanol and acetic acid in a 48 -well microtiter plate during <b>vinegar</b> <b>fermentation</b> a new custom-made lid was developed. A diffusion model was used to calculate the dimensions of a hole in the lid to guarantee a suitable oxygen supply and level of ventilation. A reference fermentation was conducted in a 9 L-bioreactor to enable the calculation of the proper cultivation conditions in the microtiter plate. The minimum dissolved oxygen tensions in the microtiter plate were between 7. 5 % and 23 % of air saturation and in the same range as in the 9 L-bioreactor. Evaporation losses of ethanol and acetic acid were less than 5 % after 47 h and considerably reduced compared to those of microtiter plate fermentations with a conventional gas-permeable seal. Furthermore, cultivation times in the microtiter plate were with about 40 h as long as in the 9 L-bioreactor. In conclusion, microtiter plate cultivations with the new custom-made lid provide a platform for high-throughput studies on <b>vinegar</b> <b>fermentation.</b> Results are comparable to those in the 9 L-bioreactor...|$|R

40|$|Availability of {{efficient}} starters {{is one of}} {{the most}} important elements during fermentation technology. Acetic acid bacteria (AAB) face extreme conditions (low pH, high acetic acid concentration (> 7 %), ethanol and high temperature) during <b>vinegar</b> <b>fermentation.</b> In spite of introduction of broth media contained viable AAB as starter by some companies; traditional methods for initiation of <b>vinegar</b> <b>fermentation</b> are still used even in modern factories, therefore there is a long Lag phase for initiation of fermentation. In recent studies in CWBI, a kind of lyophilized starter has been produced by using an isolated thermotolerant bacterium: Acetobacter senegalensis. The aim of this study is to determine the best media for revitalization and the optimum temperature for preservation of the freeze-dried cells. To produce biomass, glucose was used as carbon source in batch culture under regulated conditions. The cells harvested when they reached to stationary phase. Harvested cells suspended in spent growth medium (final supernatant of fermentation). Maltodextrin (10 %), manitol (20 %) and spent growth medium were used as protestants. After freeze-drying they were subjected to storage test at - 20 ° C, 4 ° C and 35 ° C for six months. The viability of cells determined by using spread plate technique using three different media: YG (yeast extract, glucose) and YGE (yeast extract, glucose, ethanol) and YGEA (yeast extract, glucose, ethanol, acetic acid). According to residual viable cells, manitol and maltodextrin showed higher protective functions rather than spent growth medium (92. 3 %, 88. 2 % and 82. 1 % survival, respectively) during freeze-drying process. Viability of cells during rehydration is completely dependent to the composition of the broth media used for this purpose. Adding ethanol (> 0. 5 %) or acetic acid (> 1 %) to rehydration medium caused 40 - 45 % reduction in viable cell numbers in comparison to YG broth. The composition of culture media can also influence the growth of bacteria after rehydration. In YG, much higher cell growth (about 1 log unit) was observed in comparison to YGE and YGEA. Addition of glucose (20 g/l) to YGE can neutralize the adverse effect of ethanol considerably but it cannot improve the growth in YGEA. This can be partially explained according to the activity of alcohol dehydrogenase and acetaldehyde dehydrogenase. It was revealed that freeze-dried cells had very low activities for these two enzymes. Analysis of total soluble protein contents of lyophilized cells during storage at different conditions revealed that the soluble protein content of cells reduced by increasing the storage temperature. At 35 ° C after 15 days, there were 4. 87 log units reduction in the viability of cells, and also about 14 % less soluble protein was detectable under this condition whereas keeping of cells at - 20 or + 4 ° C had no influences on protein and viability of cells. Storage of cells at + 4 ° C in darkness for six month showed that about 79. 2 % and 68. 3 % viability of cells remained for cells protected by manitol and maltodextrin, respectively. To assess the real activity of lyophilized cells as starters, they were introduced to broth media (YGE contained 20 g/l of glucose). It was seen that 6 months old lyophilized cells (with maltodextrin or manitol as protectants) were able to grow and consume 5 v/v of ethanol in 48 hr in the presence of initial acetic acid concentration (0. 5 %) at 30 ° C.

Automatic annotation of the complete genome revealed 2, 786 protein-coding genes and 73 RNA genes. The comparative genome analysis among A. pasteurianus strains revealed that A. pasteurianus Ab 3 possesses many unique genes potentially involved in acetic acid resistance mechanisms. In particular, two-component systems or toxin-antitoxin systems may be the signal pathway and modulatory network in A. pasteurianus to cope with acid stress. In addition, {{the large numbers of}} unique transport systems may also be related to its acid resistance capacity and cell fitness. Our results provide new clues to understanding the underlying mechanisms of acetic acid resistance in Acetobacter species and guiding industrial strain breeding for <b>vinegar</b> <b>fermentation</b> processes...|$|R
40|$|AbstractChinese cereal vinega {{represented}} the east vinegar, {{is well known}} to the world. In {{order to understand the}} Chinese cereal vinegar further, its characteristic flavour should be researched. The purpose of the work is to find out the characteristic flavour compounds and analyze the dynamic variation trend in the process of Chinese cereal <b>vinegar</b> <b>fermentation.</b> HS- SPME fibered with polyacrylate (PA) was used in detecting aromatic compounds. It was found that in the ethanol fermentation, ethanol increased rapidly, and other aromatic compounds accumulated slowly; in the acetic acid fermentation, acetic acid and esters increased fast with reduction of alcohol, while phenols, aldehyde, ketones, hydrocarbons and heterocyclic were still slowly accumulated. The characteristic aromatic compounds were ethyl acetate, isoamyl acetate, phenylethyl acetate, β-phenylethyl alcohol and 4 -Vinylguaiacol. The contents of organic acids reached 6. 79 ± 0. 11 g/ 100 g sample finally, and acetic acid, succinic acid, malic acid and lactic acid were the main organic acids. The variation trend of the characteristic flavour compounds had been found out preliminarily, which could be the symbol of Chinese cereal vinegar and the basis of further study. Here, the foundation for improving flavour and quality of Chinese cereal vinegar was established...|$|R
40|$|Two {{thermoresistant}} {{acetic acid}} bacteria (TAAB) were previously isolated and selected for a sustainable development of <b>vinegar</b> <b>fermentation</b> in Subsaharan Africa. Their {{use as a}} starter culture in vinegar manufactures in such regions could reduce considerably water cooling expenses. For optimising biomass preservation, the effect of 20 % w/w mannitol as cryoprotectant on the cells viability after freeze-drying process and during storage was evaluated. Results showed that freeze-dried cells could be conserved at 4 degrees C for at least 6 months without loss of viability. The main reasons were that cryoprotectant tends {{to lower the water}} activity (a(w)) and to maintain a temperature of product weaker than that of the glass transition temperature T-g. Furthermore, the heat resistance of freeze-dried cells during storage was all the more increased that strains were cryoprotected. In addition, intrinsically, an increase of saturated fatty acids with the temperature is the essential modification in the lipidome level of membrane cells when the fermentation occured at a temperature of 30 degrees C. Tolerance to heat during storage was significantly enhanced under such mechanisms. (c) 2006 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved. Peer reviewe...|$|R
40|$|Background and Objective: Garlic, in {{different}} types, {{is a very}} common food ingredient all over the world. Traditionally, garlic is fermented in grape vinegar to produce garlic pickles; in this study, to produce a novel fermented food, garlic was fermented in kombucha beverage; then, antibacterial and chemical properties and color changes of garlics fermented in kombucha and vinegar were compared {{with each other and}} those of fresh garlic. Material and Methods: Folin-Ciocalteu assay was performed to evaluate total phenolic contents; free radical scavenging activity was evaluated using 2, 2 - diphenyl- 1 -picrylhydrazyl. Disk diffusion method was performed to measure inhibitory activity against testing bacteria. A digital method was designed for color analysis. All data were statistically analyzed by ANOVA test at significant level of (p≤ 0. 05). Results and Conclusion: Fresh garlic extract had the highest inhibitory effect (mean 27. 7 mm) against tested bacteria; kombucha fermented garlic showed bigger inhibition zone (mean 21. 7 mm) than vinegar fermented garlic (mean 17. 9 mm). Anti-staphylococcus aureus activity of fresh garlic was stronger than gentamycin and amoxicillin; inhibitory effect of garlic extracts against tested bacteria was significant in comparison with standard antibiotics. Fresh-garlic extract contained highest amount of phenolic contents; fermentation of garlic in kombucha decreased phenolic content of garlic bulbs by 1. 92 % and IC 50 factor for antioxidant activity was 10. 25 % higher than fresh garlic; <b>fermentation</b> in <b>vinegar</b> reduced 21 % of phenolic contents and IC 50 obtained 47. 4 % higher than fresh garlic. Fermentation of garlic reduces the density of colors and luminosity, but the reduction in garlics fermented in vinegar is more than in kombucha. Appearance of vinegar fermented garlic changed to yellowish and kombucha inclined the color to reddish. Fermentation of garlic in kombucha provides better preservation of biological properties of garlic than in grape vinegar.

40|$|Abstract The {{objectives}} {{of this study}} were to investigate the alcohol and acetic acid fermentations using the sterile onion(Allium cepa L.) juice as raw material and performed by traditional static cultivation system. This included screening of yeast strain and acetic acid bacteria strain, and establishment of the conditions for onion <b>vinegar</b> <b>fermentation</b> process. Allysine compounds present in onion have a keen, stimulating smell and an anti-bacterial property, which inhibits the growth of yeast. In preliminary experiments, difficulty was experienced in fermenting the raw onion juice using yeast. However, since the allysine compounds are volatile and they can be removed by autoclaving. Alcohol and acetic acid fermentations using the sterile onion juice were thus performed successfully by batch culture. Saccharomyces cerevisiae CCRC 21551 was chosen for its best alcohol producing capability, up to 14. 1 %(v/v) was obtained, while S. cerevisiae 20262 was best for its special fruit flavor. These two strains were chosen to study the subsequent determination of optimum condition of alcohol fermentation. Acetobacter sp. CCRC 12326 was chosen to study the optimum condition of acetic acid fermentation. The acetic acid producing capability of this strain was up to 4. 86 % (v/v) in mannitol medium containing 5 % ethanol. The juice from the onion CAL 505 cultivar, which contain 8. 4 Brix soluble solid, was converted by yeast to onion wine containing 3. 92 % (v/v) ethanol; and then fermented further to onion vinegar with 3. 43 % (v/v) acetic acid. Evaluations of the fermentation efficiencies for Acetobacter sp. CCRC 12326 on fermenting onion wines (OWs) with different concentrations of ethanol, and OWs with or without supplementing with 1 % acetic acid was performed. The highest acidity of onion acidity vinegar in the 6 th day was 3. 44 % (v/v) from the OW containing 5 % ethanol, and the highest one in the 8 th day was 3. 61 % from the OW with 7 % alcohol. However, supplementing the OW with 1 % acetic acid did not enhance the <b>vinegar</b> <b>fermentation</b> rate. The acidity of onion vinegar was 3. 48 % at day 15 if the fresh OW was added during fermentation, and accompanied by the increase of final volume of broth to 2. 25 times. Both acetic acid production rate and acidity increased if a modified two-stage <b>vinegar</b> <b>fermentation</b> method which comprised four operation modes(A 1, A 2, B 1, B 2) was used. The highest acetic acid production rate was obtained for the <b>vinegar</b> <b>fermentation</b> performed according to A 1 mode (starter-making 3 days, mother vinegar-making 3 days); the concentration of acetic acid was 4. 97 % after 24 days. However, the final acidity was higher, 6. 02 %, for that of using B 2 mode (starter-making 5 days and mother vinegar-making 5 days). The contents of major organic acids except acetic acid in the onion vinegar were glucuronic acid 0. 43, gluconic acid 0. 91, tartaric acid 0. 16, pyroglutamic acid 0. 097, and malic acid 0. 80 g/ 100 ml. 摘要 本研究以滅菌的洋蔥(Allium cepa L.) 汁為材料，依序進行酒精 和醋酸的批式發酵試驗，包括篩選出二株最適合洋蔥酒發酵的酵母菌與醋酸發酵的醋酸菌及建立洋蔥醋的發酵模式與相關技術的探討。 洋蔥含有Allysine的成分具有辛辣而刺激性的味道，且有抑菌作用。在預實驗時，酵母菌幾乎無法在生洋蔥汁中行酒精發酵。然而，Allysine的成分具有揮發性，可在殺菌釜滅菌過程去除，故以滅菌 的洋蔥汁即可成功進行酒精發酵。 酵母菌株之篩選以Saccharomyces cerevisiae CCRC 21551 株之最終酒精濃度最高，達 14. 1 %(v/v) ，而Saccharomyces cerevisiae CCRC 20262 具有特殊的水果香味，故以這兩株酵母菌進行最適酒精發酵條件之探討。 醋酸菌的篩選以Acetobactor sp. CCRC 12326 產醋效率最高，可在含 5 %酒精的Mannitol medium中發酵五天產出 4. 86 %(v/v) 的醋酸，故以之進行最適醋酸發酵條件之探討。選用洋蔥品種CAL 505 的洋蔥汁為原料，其可溶性固形物為 8. 4 ∘Brix，可發酵成酒精濃度 3. 92 %(v/v) 的洋蔥酒，再發酵為醋酸濃度 3. 43 %(v/v) 的洋蔥醋。 在不同濃度洋蔥酒及添加醋酸與否的醋酸發酵比較試驗中，發酵第六天以 5 %洋蔥酒產醋酸較高，為 3. 44 %(v/v) ，而發酵第八天以 7 %洋蔥酒產醋酸較高，為 3. 61 %(v/v) ；添加 1 %醋酸的洋蔥酒其醋酸發酵效率並未增加。 在以添酒方式行醋酸發酵之試驗中，經二次添酒後到第十五天其滴定醋酸達 3. 4829 %，而其體積因二次添酒而增加為 2. 25 倍。而以二階段馴化方式行醋酸發酵，可使產醋效率提高及酸度增加，其中以菌酛及種醋培養各三天的方式，經 24 天發酵之實際產醋量最高為 4. 97 %；而菌酛及種醋培養各五天者，最終醋酸濃度可達 6. 02 %(v/v) 。 洋蔥醋的其它有機酸成分為每一百毫升含葡萄糖醛酸 0. 43 克、葡萄糖酸 0. 91 克、酒石酸 0. 16 克、焦麩胺酸 0. 097 克及蘋果酸 0. 80 克。目錄 壹、前言 [...] 1 貳、文獻整理 [...] 3 【壹】洋蔥的相關介紹……………………………………… [...] . 3 一、洋蔥的組成分………………………………………… [...] . 3 二、洋蔥的抑菌性………………………………………… [...] . 3 三、洋蔥的保健功效……………………………………… [...] . 5 (一) 洋蔥中含硫成分的保健功效……………………… [...] . 5 (二) 洋蔥中類黃酮的保健功效………………………… [...] . 9 四、洋蔥的加工製品………………………………… [...] 13 【貳】醋酸發酵之相關介紹………………………………… [...] . 16 一、醋的定義及功能…………………………………… [...] . 16 (一) 醋的定義……………………………………………… [...] 16 (二) 醋的功能…………………………………………… [...] 16 二、醋酸菌之研究…………………………………………… [...] 17 (一) 醋酸菌的分離與培養………………………… [...] 18 (二) 醋酸菌的種類……………………………………… [...] 18 三、食醋之釀造方法……………………………………… [...] 19 (一) 傳統的靜置發酵…………………………………… [...] 19 (二) 深部培養法(Submerged culture) ………………… [...] 20 四、影響醋酸發酵的因素………………………………… [...] 22 (一) 氧氣………………………………………………… [...] 23 (二) 溫度………………………………………………… [...] 23 (三) 發酵基質成份比例…………………………………… [...] 23 (四) 醋酸發酵的促進因子…………………………………… [...] 25 參、材料與方法……………………………………………… [...] . 26 【壹】實驗材料………………………………………………… [...] 26 一、洋蔥……………………………………………………… [...] . 26 二、實驗菌株……………………………………………… [...] . 26 三、培養基………………………………………………… [...] 26 四、化學藥劑……………………………………………… [...] 27 五、儀器設備……………………………………………… [...] 28 六、電腦套裝軟體 [...] . 29 【貳】實驗方法…………………………………………… [...] . 30 一、實驗大綱……………………………………………. … [...] 30 二、實驗方法……………………………………………… [...] . 30 (一) 洋蔥汁的製備……………………………………… [...] . 30 (二) 酒精發酵條件之探求………………………………… [...] . 31 (三) 醋酸發酵條件之探求 [...] ………………………………… [...] 32 三、分析方法……………………………………………… [...] 33 四、統計分析及圖形繪製………………………………… [...] 35 肆、結果與討論……………………………………………… [...] . 36 【壹】最適酵母菌株之篩選…………………………………… [...] . 36 【貳】最適醋酸菌菌株之篩選………………………………… [...] . 49 【參】醋酸發酵條件之探討…………………………………… [...] . 56 (一) 不同酒精濃度洋蔥酒及添加醋酸與否之醋酸發酵比較… [...] 56 (二) 以 12 o與 14 oBrix SSOJ發酵之洋蔥酒行醋酸發酵比較…… 59 (三) 以添酒方式行醋酸發酵試驗。…………………………… [...] 62 (四) 二階段馴化方式醋酸發酵比較試驗。…………………… [...] 64 【肆】其他成份分析結果……………………………………… [...] . 73 (一) 糖類分析……………………………………………… [...] 73 (二) 其他有機酸分析(除醋酸外) …………… [...] . 79 伍、結論………………………………………………………… [...] . 82 參考文獻………………………………………………………… [...] . 84 圖目錄 圖次 圖一、不同酵母菌菌株於滅菌洋蔥汁中培養生菌數之變化 [...] 37 圖二、不同酵母菌菌株於滅菌洋蔥汁中培養生菌數之變化 [...] 38 圖三、不同酵母菌菌株於滅菌洋蔥汁中培養生菌數之變化 [...] 39 圖四、不同酵母菌菌株於滅菌洋蔥汁中培養生菌數之變化 [...] 40 圖五、不同酵母菌菌株於補糖洋蔥汁(SOJ) 靜置發酵時第三 和第五天之產酒精變化 [...] 43 圖六、六株優勢酵母菌株於補糖洋蔥汁(SSOJ) 中靜置發酵 時之產酒精變化 [...] 44 圖七、三株優勢酵母菌株於補糖洋蔥汁(SSOJ) 中靜置發酵 時之生菌數變化 [...] 45 圖八、三株優勢酵母菌株於補糖洋蔥汁(SSOJ) 中靜置發酵 時之生菌數變化 [...] 46 圖九、兩株選定酵母菌個別或混合於滅菌洋蔥汁靜置發酵 之產酒精變化 [...] 47 圖十、兩株選定酵母菌個別或混合於滅菌洋蔥汁靜置發酵 之生菌數變化 [...] 48 圖十一、不同醋酸菌發酵過程產醋量與殘存酒精的變化 [...] 51 圖十二、不同醋酸菌發酵過程生菌數變化 [...] 52 圖十三、不同醋酸菌發酵過程pH值變化 [...] 54 圖十四、Acetobacter sp.

Technically, the main objective of the research is to study behavior of the purification of fermentation products of local nira by utilizing batch distillation. The major product from the fermentation process is ethanol. The scope of study includes the investigation of composition profile of the distillate and the others parameter to the composition profile. Nira is a fermentation product that to be expected to produce ethanol by undergo the separation process using batch distillation. The result shows the concentration {{can be obtained by}} using the standard curve. By utilizing batch distillation, the optimun condition in separation components in vinegar from nypa palm can be determine. For the effect of time the concentration of ethanol become concentrated as increasing the time. At 74 ̊C- 76 ̊C the optimum product can be collected because in this stage the particle of ethanol have been nearly reached the boiling point which means the particle have enough energy to escape from the liquid form to the vapors form. The concentration of acetic acid is higher than ethanol because most of ethanol particle have been converted to the acetic acid. The highest ethanol concentration should be after 20 hours <b>fermentation,</b> however the <b>vinegar</b> solution that has been used in this experiment is more than 1 days...|$|R

Strain typing of 103 {{acetic acid}} {{bacteria}} isolates from vinegars elaborated by the submerged method from ciders, wines and spirit ethanol, was carried {{on in this}} study. Two different molecular methods were utilised: pulsed field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) of total DNA digests {{with a number of}} restriction enzymes, and enterobacterial repetitive intergenic consensus (ERIC) – PCR analysis. The comparative study of both methods showed that restriction fragment PFGE of SpeI digests of total DNA was a suitable method for strain typing and for determining which strains were present in <b>vinegar</b> <b>fermentations.</b> Results showed that strains of the species Gluconacetobacter europaeus were the most frequent leader strains of fermentations by the submerged method in the studied vinegars, and among them strain R 1 was the predominant one.

40|$|Microorganisms {{have had}} a long and {{surprising}} history. They were “invisible” until invention of microscope in the 17 th century. Until that date, although they were extensively (but inconsciously) employed in food preservation, beer and wine <b>fermentation,</b> cheese, <b>vinegar,</b> yogurt and bread making, {{as well as being}} the causative agents of infectious diseases, they were considered as “not-existing”. The work of Pasteur {{in the middle of the}} 19 th century revealed several biological activities performed by microorganisms including fermentations and pathogenicity. Due to the urgent issue to treat infectious diseases (the main cause of death at those times) the “positive potential” of the microbial world has been neglected for about one century. Once the fight against the “evil” strains was fulfilled also thanks to the antibiotics, industry began to appreciate bacteria’s beneficial characteristics and exploit selected strains as starters for both food fermentations and aroma, enzyme and texturing agent production. However, it was only at the end of the 20 th century that the probiotic potential of some bacteria such as lactic acid bacteria and bifidobacteria was fully recognized. Very recently, apart from the probiotic activity of in toto bacteria, attention has begun to be directed to the chemical mediators of the probiotic effect. Thanks also to the improvement of techniques such as transcriptomics, proteomics and metabolomics, several bioactive compounds are continuously being discovered. Bioactive molecules produced by bacteria, yeasts and virus-infected cells proved to be important for improving or impairing human health. The most important result of last years’ research concerns the discovery that a very complex network of signals allows communication between organisms (from intra-species interactions to inter-kingdom signaling). Based on these findings a completely new approach has arisen: the system biology standpoind. Actually, the different organisms colonizing a certain environmental niche are not merely interacting with each other as individuals but should be considered as a whole complex ecosystem continuously exchanging information at the molecular level. In this context, this topic issue explores both antagonistic compounds (i. e. antibiotics) and “multiple function” cooperative molecules improving the physiological status of both stimulators and targets of this network. From the applicative viewpoint, these molecules could be hopefully exploited to develop new pharmaceuticals and/or nutraceuticals for improving human health...|$|R
