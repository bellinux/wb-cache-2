5|$|Sundanese or Priangan Batik <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>term</b> for batik {{from the}} Priangan region of West Java and Banten. Although Priangan batiks {{can use a}} wide range of colours, a {{preference}} for indigo is seen in some of its variants.

Noted Priangan batik is produced in Ciamis, Garut, and Tasikmalaya. Other traditions include Batik Kuningan influenced by batik Cirebon, batik Banten that developed quite independently, and an older tradition of batik Baduy.|$|E
