25|$|The Prius is a {{power-split}} or series-parallel (full) hybrid, {{sometimes referred}} to as a combined hybrid, a vehicle that can be propelled by gasoline or electric power or both.

40|$|Photovoltaic (PV) powered {{submersible}} <b>electric</b> <b>water</b> <b>pumps</b> {{are becoming}} popular in remote rural areas, {{due to the}} nonavailability of grid connectivity. However, the initial cost of a PV system is high. Permanent magnet (PM) brushless dc (BLDC) motors are efficient compared to existing induction motors, which {{reduce the cost of}} PV array. However, steep increase in the cost of rare-earth magnets like NdFeB and SmCo makes the use of PM motor uneconomical for PV systems. Thus, the design of PM motors with ferrite magnets is gaining interest. These magnets have low remanence flux density and are brittle. Thus, flux concentration rotor topologies are desirable. The conventional spoke-type (ST) rotor is one such topology. However, flux leakage is one of its prime concerns. To negotiate this, a novel "semi-modular dual-stack" ST BLDC motor along with its parametric aided three-dimensional finite element method analysis is proposed for a PV-based 100 mm deep bore-well submersible <b>water</b> <b>pump.</b> The motor features minimum flux leakage irrespective of rotor bridge width.

5000|$|Cold-side heat removal with air: In {{air-cooled}} thermoelectric applications, {{such as when}} harvesting {{thermal energy}} from a motor vehicle's crankcase, {{the large amount of}} thermal energy that must be dissipated into ambient air presents a significant challenge. As a thermoelectric generator's cool side temperature rises, the device's differential working temperature decreases. As the temperature rises, the device's electrical resistance increases causing greater parasitic generator self-heating. In motor vehicle applications a supplementary radiator is sometimes used for improved heat removal, though the use of an <b>electric</b> <b>water</b> <b>pump</b> to circulate a coolant adds an additional parasitic loss to total generator output power. Water cooling the thermoelectric generator's cold side, as when generating thermoelectric power from the hot crank case of an inboard boat motor, would not suffer from this disadvantage.

40|$|Abstract—Presently, {{engine cooling}} pump {{is driven by}} toothed belt. Therefore, the pump speed is {{dependent}} on engine speed which varies their output. At normal engine operating conditions (Higher RPM and low load, Higher RPM and high load), mechanical water pumps in existing engines are inevitably oversized and so {{the use of an}} <b>electric</b> <b>water</b> <b>pump</b> together with state-of-the-art thermal management of the combustion engine has measurable advantages.

The lack of dependence on a mechanical drive also results in considerable flexibility in component packaging within the engine compartment.

50|$|In {{the winter}} between 1922 and 1923, the Water Commission {{constructed}} a sandstone pump {{house in the}} park to house the two <b>electric</b> <b>water</b> <b>pumps.</b> The building, now used for storage, has the design that would be featured in all buildings within the park. After the pump house was created, the Stevens Point citizens began discussing the plan to develop some of the 43 acres into a municipal swimming beach and park. The city attempted to create a bird refuge, but this did not gain traction. After this, in April 1926, the Stevens Point Water Commission began improvement projects around {{the area of the}} pump house to create a public park area. By August of the same year, the construction crew had cleared both sides of the river, leaving some trees on either side for shade. A beach with shallow water was created for younger children, with a deeper area approximately 200 yards away for older children. By the summer of 1927, two bath houses along with a parking area were constructed, and several picnic tables were placed under the trees surrounding the water. Stone pillars on the entrance were created, as well as a wall along the bank of the river to prevent erosion of the soil. A bridge was created to span the river, and two spring boards were attached to it. At this time the beach had its first employed lifeguard by the name of William Rellaban. Electric flood lights and lampposts were also constructed. All of the constructed buildings have been renovated and are still currently maintained.|$|R
