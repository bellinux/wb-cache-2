5000|$|Joseph Breck had a firm {{understanding}} {{and appreciation for}} not only design but how objects should be displayed. In 1912 {{at a meeting of}} the American Association of Museums held at the Metropolitan Museum, Breck, Museum Secretary Henry W. Kent and curator Durr Friedley set up cases and created displays demonstrating two methods: “good” and “bad”. These <b>installation</b> <b>guidelines</b> which featured less crowding, goodlight, clear lines and glass display cases with muted backgrounds, became the standard for art museum installation. Breck wrote extensively on display and installation with the “purpose of benefitting both historical and visitor point of view.” [...] Breck was associated with many exhibitions at the Museum, including the popular Industrial Arts Exhibitions. His philosophy was that by showing the public well-designed, everyday objects - chairs, tables, curtains - [...] "good taste" [...] could be taught. He stated that these “touch a person more nearly and while a person may not be able to afford a good picture, that it is possible to purchase a good lamp by seeing these examples.” [...] Though somewhat conservative in his taste, Breck displayed for the first time at the Metropolitan examples of Art Deco and Art Nouveau objects. His acquisitions as a curator were considered “remarkably fine.” [...] Breck wrote more than two hundred articles covering the fields of Renaissance art and sculpture, design of objects, and display and installation techniques. He was the author of catalogues for those subjects as well as on individual artists (such as Rodin), exhibitions (the Swedish exhibition) and collections (handbooks on J.P. Morgan & Ballard). He was also a frequent contributor to The Metropolitan Museum of Art Bulletin.|$|E

40|$|Although grid {{electrification}} drastically increased {{during the}} past two decades up to about almost 75 % of the total households in Sri Lanka, it is noted that attempting to electrify the rest of the approximately 25 % of the households is very expensive. This is due to the fact that these households are situated in very remote areas which do not permit the normal low voltage (230 V Phase to Neutral / 415 V Phase to Phase) transmission since the losses would make it unusable to the end user point. Thus, in order to avoid this losses medium voltage line should be drawn at a very expensive cost which is not justified by the measly amount of end users. The cost benefit analysis would not be feasible. Thus, the rest of these 25 % of un-electrified households stands the risk of not having accessibility to grid power even in another 20 to 30 years. Therefore, for such rural house holds the solution for the moment is alternative energy sources. Up to about decade or so back the solution that they had was kerosene fuel to light up their lamps, thereafter they obtained the accessibility to solar photovoltaic (PV) electricity through private sector vendors and government intervention. This solution was widely accepted by this community since the end result was the next best thing to grid power. Further it was safe in usage than kerosene fuel and even grid power. The government and world bank also subsidized the purchase of such systems from vendors. However, the supply of solar PV home systems (SHS) became very competitive, amongst the vendors who supplied them. As a result quality of these systems as well as their installation was compromised by the vendors. As result the poor rural folks who purchased these systems went through severe hardships due to malfunctioning systems. Considering that the investment for these systems would be the largest or the second largest investment in their lives it was unacceptable for them, Therefore, author of this dissertation had set out to develop a solar PV <b>installation</b> <b>guideline</b> and has managed to develop same in order to be utilized and to be educated by, the end users or their financing institutions.

40|$|Abstract:- With the {{dramatic}} increases in desktop computing power driven by Intranet-based operations {{and the growing}} demands for time-sensitive delivery between networked users, office and production-level Ethernet LAN technology has rapidly evolved from a coaxial cable running at 10 megabits per second to twisted pair running data rates up to 1 gigabit per second. As {{a side effect of}} this evolution, the higher the transmission rate grows the more sensitive the communication system will be to external noise inducted by Electromagnetic Interference (EMI). Consequentially, the designers, installers and users of Ethernet networks must consider the effects of EMI as a key factor in cabling design, setup and operation. Operating and environmental conditions in terms of Electromagnetic compatibility, should be seriously taken into account when choosing materials and designing cable routing layouts especially in industrial plants and high density computer rooms. In this paper we performed a detailed analysis on the disruptive effects of EMI on the most common state-ofthe-art copper twisted pair Ethernet cabling technologies. Transmission parameters, noise/disturbance levels and network errors have been extensively examined and compared under varying EMC environmental condition to provide clear and up-to-date <b>installation</b> practice <b>guidelines</b> in terms choice of materials and separation requirements from suspected sources of interference, aiming to optimize communication channel characteristics and yield the maximum possible throughput...|$|R

40|$|Abstract — Reflective {{cracking}} {{has been}} a major issue in pavement rehabilitation for many decades, due in part to shrinkage, constant expansion and contraction of pavement. These cracks result in uncomfortable rides and further deteriorate highways and local streets. Because of these problems, the application of paving fabrics systems to reduce reflective cracking is being investigated. If applied correctly, these paving fabrics should control moisture protruding to the base, provide tensile reinforcement, and prevent or reduce the propagation of cracks to the new overlay. The performance of paving fabrics is related to several factors including proper installation procedure. To assure the performance record for paving fabrics, the <b>installation</b> specification, and <b>guidelines</b> must be strictly enforced and proper installation and equipment is critical for optimum performance.

For decades artists such as Jenny Holzer have sought to provoke the public with art installations by repurposing public displays and exploring ambiguous messaging.

The relevance of scientific findings to <b>installation</b> permitting <b>guidelines</b> (IPG) for small stationary hydrogen and fuel cell systems is discussed. A key aim of the activities was to generate new knowledge in the field of hydrogen safety, and, where possible, use this data as a basis to support the recommendations in the IPG. The structure of the paper mirrors the HYPER research programme in that the work is described in terms of the following relevant scenarios: 1) high pressure releases, 2) small foreseeable releases, 3) catastrophic releases, and 4) the effects of walls and barriers. Within each scenario the key objectives, activities and results are presented.

40|$|Moisture control {{analysis}} of building envelope components by hygrothermal simulation is state-of-theart today and widely applied by architects and engineers. Compared to simple dew-point calculations, transient simulations according to existing standards (e. g. EN 15026 - 2009) have greatly improved {{the possibilities of}} moisture {{control analysis}}. However, the underlying assumption of building components without imperfections have remained a weak point, because unintended moisture sources due to e. g. rain-water penetration or air convection may have significant effects in real life. The new draft of the WTA guideline 6 - 2, whose original version served as blue-print for EN 15026, takes hygrothermal simulations a step further by introducing auxiliary models that account for unintended moisture sources {{likely to occur in}} building components, assembled and installed in best practice manner. Because bad workmanship is ruled out, applying these models offers the opportunity to differentiate between design errors and <b>installation</b> failures. Other <b>guideline</b> improvements include new boundary condition aspects such as safety margins for indoor climate conditions and consideration of envelope shading.

In several other studies strip design is usually not controlled for, which might partly account for some differences between their results and the present results.

It might be useful to develop <b>installation</b> <b>guidelines</b> covering aspects such as: in-ground profile; rumble strip width, length, and depth; and milled versus pressed and conventional versus sinusoidal rumble strips.

40|$|This {{research}} study presents findings from abutment clear-water experiments on erodible uniform bed material and Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) composite roughness models used to investigate distribution of flow velocity, unit discharge, and boundary shear stress associated with different riprap installation geometries based on field <b>installations</b> and design <b>guidelines</b> from HEC 23. The data {{apply for the}} case of bridges crossing narrow river channels and vertical-wall GRS abutments extending into the main channel. CFD composite roughness models with different riprap geometries show how abutment flow fields, dominated by flow contraction around the abutment, adjust in response to variations of bed roughness and cross-section geometry due to riprap placement. These adjustments increase the magnitudes of bed shear stress on the unprotected channel bed leading to underestimated contraction scour depths. Consequently, the increase in erosion of the unprotected bed may undermine the riprap mattress creating instability, and ultimately causing edge failure of the countermeasure around the abutment. A preliminary relationship for the maximum contraction scour depth is suggested to illustrate the riprap installation geometry and bed roughness effects on contraction scour for bridges crossing narrow waterways.

Methods: First, evidence-based pain guidelines were developed via the web in a tertiary hospital. Second, a special educational program on evidence-based pain guidelines for nurses was developed after validation of content by experts. Third, diverse strategies were adopted in order to facilitate incorporation of evidence-based pain guidelines in practice. Fourth, nurses in the study units were educated on evidence-based guidelines using the developed educational program for 3 weeks before their implementation of evidence-based pain guidelines to patients. Patients were assigned to the control group (from July 29 to August 20, 2011) and the experimental group (from September 24 to October 25, 2011) according to interrupted time interval.
