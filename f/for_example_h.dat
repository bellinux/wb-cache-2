2500|$|After its {{original}} production, The Grand Duke was not revived by the D'Oyly Carte Opera Company until 1975 (and then only in concert), and performances by other {{companies have been}} less frequent {{than most of the}} other Gilbert and Sullivan operas. [...] 20th century critics dismissed the work. [...] <b>For</b> <b>example,</b> <b>H.</b> M. Walbrook wrote in 1921, [...] "It reads like the work of a tired man. ... There is his manner but not his wit, his lyrical fluency but not his charm. ... the most part, the lyrics were uninspiring and the melodies uninspired." [...] Of Gilbert's work in the opera, Isaac Goldberg opined, [...] "the old self-censorship has relaxed", and of Sullivan's he concludes, [...] "his grip upon the text was relaxing; he pays less attention to the words, setting them with less regard than formerly to their natural rhythms".|$|E

2500|$|Solovay's result {{shows that}} it is not {{necessary}} to assume that all infinite-dimensional vector spaces admit discontinuous linear maps, and there are schools of analysis which adopt a more constructivist viewpoint. [...] <b>For</b> <b>example,</b> <b>H.</b> G. Garnir, in searching for so-called [...] "dream spaces" [...] (topological vector spaces on which every linear map into a normed space is continuous), was led to adopt ZF + DC + BP (dependent choice is a weakened form and the Baire property is a negation of strong AC) as his axioms to prove the Garnir–Wright closed graph theorem which states, among other things, that any linear map from an F-space to a TVS is continuous. [...] Going to the extreme of constructivism, there is Ceitin's theorem, which states that every function is continuous (this is to be understood in the terminology of constructivism, according to which only representable functions are considered to be functions). [...] Such stances are held by only a small minority of working mathematicians.|$|E
