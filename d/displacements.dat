5|$|The International Criminal Court {{investigation}} in Kenya or {{the situation in}} the Republic of Kenya is an ongoing investigation by the International Criminal Court (ICC) into the responsibility for the 2007–2008 post-election violence in Kenya. The 2007–2008 Kenyan crisis followed the presidential election that was held on 27 December 2007. The Electoral Commission of Kenya officially declared that the incumbent President Mwai Kibaki was re-elected; supporters of the opposition candidate Raila Odinga accused the government of electoral fraud and rejected the results. A series of protests and demonstrations followed, and fighting—mainly along tribal lines—led to many deaths, injuries and <b>displacements.</b>|$|E

A positioning apparatus with a fine-positioning mechanism attached to the <b>displacement</b> extension mechanism was developed.

Fine positioning is obtained with cooperative positioning that is performed by combining extended <b>displacement</b> positioning and reduced <b>displacement</b> positioning. As a fundamental experiment, the positioning characteristics of extended <b>displacement</b> positioning and reduced <b>displacement</b> positioning were examined individually. A value of 4. 63 times the <b>displacement</b> magnification in extended <b>displacement</b> positioning and a value of 0. 19 times the <b>displacement</b> magnification in reduced <b>displacement</b> positioning were obtained in comparison with <b>displacement</b> of an actuator unit alone. Cooperative positioning using <b>displacement</b> feedback with PI control was then examined.

25|$|To {{appreciate}} how this quadrature phase shift corresponds to an electric field that rotates {{while maintaining a}} constant magnitude, imagine a dot traveling clockwise in a circle. Consider how the vertical and horizontal <b>displacements</b> of the dot, relative {{to the center of}} the circle, vary sinusoidally in time and are out of phase by one quarter of a cycle. The <b>displacements</b> are said to be out of phase by one quarter of a cycle because the horizontal maximum displacement (toward the left) is reached one quarter of a cycle before the vertical maximum displacement is reached. Now referring again to the illustration, imagine the center of the circle just described, traveling along the axis from the front to the back. The circling dot will trace out a helix with the displacement toward our viewing left, leading the vertical displacement. Just as the horizontal and vertical <b>displacements</b> of the rotating dot are out of phase by one quarter of a cycle in time, the magnitude of the horizontal and vertical components of the electric field are out of phase by one quarter of a wavelength.|$|E
