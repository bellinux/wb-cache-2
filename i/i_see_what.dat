25|$|When I am in my painting, I'm {{not aware}} of what I'm doing. It is only after a sort of 'get acquainted' period that <b>I</b> <b>see</b> <b>what</b> I have been about. I have no fear of making changes, {{destroying}} the image, etc., because the painting has {{a life of its}} own. I try to let it come through. It is only when I lose contact with the painting that the result is a mess. Otherwise there is pure harmony, an easy give and take, and the painting comes out well.|$|E

[...] McCay gave the gathered group of animators some technical advice, but when he felt the audience was not giving him attention, he berated his audience, saying, [...] "Animation is an art. [...] That is how I conceived it. [...] But as <b>I</b> <b>see,</b> <b>what</b> you fellows have done with it, is making it into a trade. [...] Not an art, but a trade. [...] Bad Luck!" [...] That September he appeared on the radio at WNAC, and on November 2 he was interviewed by Frank Craven for The Evening Journals Woman's Hour. [...] During both appearances he complained about the state of contemporary animation.|$|E

2500|$|By late June, {{there had}} been {{considerable}} progress and, in a letter copied into one written to Florimo on 25 July, Bellini writes in reply to Alesandro Lanari, now {{the director of the}} Royal Theatres of Naples. Because Lanari had written to him on 10 April 1834 regarding an opera for Naples, Bellini tells him that the first act of Puritani is finished and that he expects to complete the opera by September, in order that he may then have time to write for Naples. In this letter to Lanari, the composer lays down some very strict terms, some of which received counter-offers in August, but none of which were accepted by the composer. Finally, Bellini stated {{that he did not want}} [...] "to negotiate with anybody until <b>I</b> <b>see</b> <b>what</b> success my opera will have". This included a proposal from the Opéra-Comique for a new opera for them.) ...|$|E
