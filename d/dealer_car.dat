40|$|Car {{prices in}} Europe are {{characterized}} by large and persistent differences across countries. The {{purpose of this paper}} is to document and explain this price dispersion. Using a panel data set extending from 1980 to 1993, the authors first demonstrate two main facts concerning car prices in Europe: (1) The existence of significant differences in quality adjusted prices across countries; (2) substantial year-to-year volatility that is to a large extent accounted for by exchange rate fluctuation and the incomplete response of local currency prices to these fluctuations. These facts are analyzed within the framework of a multi-product oligopoly model with product differentiation. The model identifies three potential sources for the international price differences: price elasticities generating differences in markups, costs, and import quota constraints. The authors find that the primary reason for the higher prices in Italy is the existence of a strong bias for domestic brands that generates high markups for the domestic firm. In the UK higher prices are mainly attributed to better equipped cars and/or differences in the <b>dealer</b> <b>car</b> practices. The import quota constraints are found to have a significant impact on Japanese car pricesstatus: publishe...|$|E

50|$|In {{order to}} recover its losses, Royscot sued the <b>car</b> <b>dealer,</b> Maidenhead Honda Centre Ltd, {{alleging that the}} company's {{reliance}} upon the garage's innocent misrepresentation (fraud was not mentioned) induced it {{to enter into the}} hire purchase contract. It argued that, had the <b>car</b> <b>dealer</b> not given the wrong figures, it would never have entered the credit agreement, and therefore the subsequent loss was the <b>car</b> <b>dealer's</b> fault. The <b>car</b> <b>dealer</b> countered that the real cause of Royscot's loss was Mr Rogerson's dishonest sale of the car, because if he had not sold it, they would be entitled to repossession and discharge of their debt that way. The <b>car</b> <b>dealer</b> argued that Mr Rogerson's independent wrongful act broke the chain of causation between its misrepresentation and Royscot's loss.|$|R

It shows that the project allowed <b>car</b> <b>dealers</b> managers to understand that financial metrics in use did not control compliance standards for Car Brands, in warranty services, or assure a good cash-flow for the <b>car</b> <b>dealers.</b> Necessary changes and new metrics (% time compliance to do the service and bill it, % time compliance reception, % time to find a defective part in an audit) generated time benefits and consequently a more controlled cash flow. These new metrics may be common to any <b>car</b> <b>dealer</b> with warranty services...|$|R
