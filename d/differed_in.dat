5|$|Elaborate body {{structures}} of many modern-day animals usually serve to attract {{members of the}} opposite sex during mating. It is quite possible that the sails or humps of these dinosaurs were used for courtship, in a way similar to a peacock's tail. Stromer speculated that males and females may have <b>differed</b> <b>in</b> the size of the neural spine.|$|E
5|$|For some historians, the War of the Bavarian Succession was {{the last}} of the old-style Cabinet Wars (Kabinettskriege) of the Ancien Régime in which troops maneuvered while diplomats {{traveled}} between capitals to resolve their monarchs' complaints. The subsequent French Revolutionary Wars and Napoleonic Wars <b>differed</b> <b>in</b> scope, strategy, organization, and tactics.|$|E
60|$|Lights which <b>differ</b> <b>in</b> Colour, <b>differ</b> also <b>in</b> Degrees of Refrangibility.|$|R
50|$|Just as {{individual}} people <b>differ</b> <b>in</b> scalp hair color, {{they can also}} <b>differ</b> <b>in</b> pubic hair color. Differences in thickness, growth rate, and length are also evident.|$|R
40|$|In {{this paper}} we {{investigate}} {{the implications of}} permitting parallel imports of pharmaceuticals produced by a monopoly, {{from one country to}} another. We use a model where countries <b>differ</b> <b>in</b> the patients' level of co-payment for buying pharmaceuticals, and patients <b>differ</b> <b>in</b> the utility obtained from the consumption of pharmaceuticals. We show that the effects of parallel imports on total welfare are as follows: On the one hand, when countries <b>differ</b> <b>in</b> their health system only, parallel imports decrease total welfare; On the other hand, when countries <b>differ</b> <b>in</b> the health needs of their patients only, parallel imports enhance total welfare. ...|$|R
5|$|Horses in the Middle Ages <b>differed</b> <b>in</b> size, {{build and}} breed from the modern horse, and were, on average, smaller. They {{were also more}} central to society than their modern counterparts, being {{essential}} for war, agriculture, and transport.|$|E
5|$|The 2010 Portuguese teen series Lua Vermelha (Red Moon) had {{a similar}} premise of vampire romance but <b>differed</b> <b>in</b> the story. A parody film {{released}} that same year titled, Vampires Suck spoofed the film series. A television show within the canon of Canadian teen vampire film My Babysitter's a Vampire and the television series sequel called Dusk is a parody of Twilight.|$|E
5|$|The writing {{staff of}} Saturday Night Live and Henson's team did share some qualities; each group formed a {{separate}} social clique and were independently opinionated and creative. They <b>differed</b> <b>in</b> age and lifestyleproducer Lorne Michaels was 31 {{years old in}} 1975, and Henson was nearly 40. Most of the writers were single and Henson was married with five children at the time.|$|E
50|$|Despite marked size, {{different}} brands often <b>differ</b> <b>in</b> actual size. Even if both {{front and}} rear are the same brand, and marked with the same size they may still <b>differ</b> <b>in</b> actual size.|$|R
50|$|The {{species is}} {{relatively}} similar to A. clarivida, but <b>differs</b> <b>in</b> the mesofemur hairs {{and development of}} the subpetiolarprocess. Additionally, these species <b>differ</b> <b>in</b> the shape of the aedeagus and the palpal formula.|$|R
50|$|Federal and non-federal {{countries}} <b>differ</b> <b>in</b> {{the manner}} in which such principles are applied. Application differs because unitary and federal governments <b>differ</b> <b>in</b> their political and legislative context and thus provide different opportunities for fiscal decentralization.|$|R
5|$|After half an hour's play Lycett Green {{once again}} became {{convinced}} that Gordon-Cumming was cheating. He left the table and sent a note to his mother-in-law—still at the table—recounting his suspicions: she took no action. By the time the game was finished Mary Wilson, the two Lycett Greens and Stanley Wilson—all {{of whom had been}} watching Gordon-Cumming closely—were convinced that he had been cheating, although they <b>differed</b> <b>in</b> their versions of what they saw. Others saw nothing, including people sitting closer to him, such as the prince, Lady Coventry (sitting next to Gordon-Cumming) and Levett (sitting opposite him). Over the two nights' play Gordon-Cumming won a total of £225.|$|E
5|$|By {{this time}} work {{had already begun}} on MAR-II on Kwajalein; built by General Electric, it <b>differed</b> <b>in</b> form and in its beam {{steering}} system. The prototype MAR-II was built on reclaimed land {{just west of the}} original Zeus site. MAR-II was built into a pyramid with its back half removed. Like MAR-I, to save money MAR-II would be equipped with only one set of transmitter and receiver elements, but with all the wiring in place in case it had to be upgraded in the future. Nike-X was canceled before MAR-II was complete, and the semi-completed building was instead used as a climate-controlled storage facility.|$|E
5|$|Coffelt's {{account was}} {{reviewed}} by the FBI, which concluded that it <b>differed</b> <b>in</b> significant details from information {{that had not been}} made public, and was therefore a fabrication. Brown, undeterred, continued peddling the story long after Coffelt died in 1975. Multiple media venues, including the television news program 60 Minutes, considered and rejected it. In a 2008 book about Lincoln's descendants, author Charles Lachman revisited Coffelt's tale although it had been discredited 36 years before.|$|E
50|$|Treatment {{modalities}} <b>differ</b> <b>in</b> the elderly.|$|R
5|$|The Asian subspecies, the {{relatively}} large intermedius also <b>differs</b> <b>in</b> structure and voice, and {{may represent a}} distinct species. Alternatively, {{it has been suggested}} that they should be considered subspecies of T. maximus, but they <b>differ</b> <b>in</b> structure, voice and the appearance of the eye-ring.|$|R
25|$|In Japanese, {{there are}} many pairs of transitive/intransitive verbs, some of which <b>differ</b> <b>in</b> the last mora, other of which <b>differ</b> <b>in</b> the second to last mora, as in this example. This is the case {{illustrated}} here in , though the rule also addresses other points.|$|R
5|$|Designs were {{submitted}} {{in response to}} the Navy's specifications by Vought-Sikorsky and Curtiss-Wright. The Vought design, designated Model 403 by the company, was similar to the company's OS2U Kingfisher, which was then under development to replace the SOC aboard U.S. Navy battleships, but had its monoplane wing moved higher on the fuselage than that of the Kingfisher, and <b>differed</b> <b>in</b> the attachment method used by its single-float landing gear. In addition, the radial engine of the OS2U was replaced by an inline Ranger V-770 in a squared-off cowling.|$|E
5|$|Near {{the end of}} the war, No.11 Group {{was formed}} on Morotai in the Dutch East Indies, using {{elements}} of Northern Command and the First Tactical Air Force; this freed the latter from garrison duties following the liberation of Borneo. In recommending the Morotai garrison's establishment, Bostock explained that while it shared the static characteristic of an area command, it <b>differed</b> <b>in</b> that the area commands were part of the permanent structure of the Air Force and situated within the borders of Australia's mainland and overseas territories, whereas the new formation was a temporary wartime measure, headquartered on foreign territory.|$|E
5|$|New Thought and Christian Science <b>differed</b> <b>in</b> that Eddy saw {{her views}} {{as a unique}} and final revelation. Eddy's idea of {{malicious}} animal magnetism marked another distinction (that people can be harmed by the bad thoughts of others), introducing an element of fear that was absent from the New Thought literature. Most significantly, she dismissed the material world as an illusion, rather than as merely subordinate to Mind, leading her to reject the use of medicine, or materia medica, and making Christian Science the most controversial of the metaphysical groups. Reality for Eddy was purely spiritual.|$|E
50|$|The Asian subspecies, the {{relatively}} large intermedius also <b>differs</b> <b>in</b> structure and voice, and {{may represent a}} distinct species. Alternatively, {{it has been suggested}} that they should be considered subspecies of T. maximus, but they <b>differ</b> <b>in</b> structure, voice and the appearance of the eye-ring.|$|R
50|$|The two dialects also <b>differ</b> <b>in</b> the {{diminutive}} suffix (-daŋ in Santee, and -na in Yankton-Yanktonai and in Sisseton) {{and in a}} number of other phonetic issues that are harder to categorize. The following table gives examples of words that <b>differ</b> <b>in</b> their phonology.|$|R
60|$|Numerous {{analogous}} facts {{could be}} given. The silk-moth, perhaps, {{offers the best}} instance; for in the breeds which transmit their characters truly, the eggs <b>differ</b> <b>in</b> size, colour, and shape: the caterpillars <b>differ,</b> <b>in</b> moulting three or four times, in colour, even in having a dark-coloured mark like an eyebrow, and {{in the loss of}} certain instincts;--the cocoons <b>differ</b> <b>in</b> size, shape, and in the colour and quality of the silk; these several differences being followed by slight or barely distinguishable differences in the mature moth.|$|R
5|$|Stegosaurus was the first-named genus of {{the family}} Stegosauridae. It is the type genus that gives {{its name to the}} family. The Stegosauridae are one of two {{families}} within the infraorder Stegosauria, with the other being the Huayangosauridae. The infraorder Stegosauria lies within the Thyreophora, or armored dinosaurs, a suborder which also includes the more diverse ankylosaurs. The stegosaurs were a clade of animals similar in appearance, posture, and shape that mainly <b>differed</b> <b>in</b> their array of spikes and plates. Among the closest relatives to Stegosaurus are Wuerhosaurus from China and Kentrosaurus from East Africa.|$|E
5|$|The English and Danish editions <b>differed</b> <b>in</b> several {{significant}} ways. The English edition {{was somewhat}} shorter and more concise, and included newer information that Heilmann had acquired {{by studying the}} actual fossils of Archaeopteryx in Berlin, {{as well as from}} foreign scientists who sent him photographs and plaster casts. It also contained considerably less harsh language towards Boas and others with whom he disagreed. Curiously, the English edition did not contain the transformational sequences inspired by D'Arcy Thompson, though Heilmann still briefly acknowledged the use of his methods in reconstructing his Proavis.|$|E
5|$|The {{original}} Metroid {{was influenced}} by two other major Nintendo franchises: Mario, from which it borrowed extensive areas of platform jumping, and The Legend of Zelda, from which it borrowed non-linear exploration. The game <b>differed</b> <b>in</b> its atmosphere of solitude and foreboding. Metroid {{was also one of}} the first video games to feature an exploration to the left as well as the right, and backtracking to already explored areas to search for secret items and paths.|$|E
25|$|Resonator modes can {{be divided}} into two types: {{longitudinal}} modes, which <b>differ</b> <b>in</b> frequency from each other; and transverse modes, which may <b>differ</b> <b>in</b> both frequency and the intensity pattern of the light. The basic, or fundamental transverse mode of a resonator is a Gaussian beam.|$|R
50|$|Annuloceras is a heteromorph ammonite {{similar in}} form to other heteroceratids {{except that the}} early helix is more loosely wound. Macroscaphites <b>differs</b> <b>in</b> that the early portion is planispiral and tightly wound. Contemporary Shastoceras, found the same strata <b>in</b> California, <b>differs</b> <b>in</b> lacking a coiled {{juvenile}} section.|$|R
50|$|Resonator modes can {{be divided}} into two types: {{longitudinal}} modes, which <b>differ</b> <b>in</b> frequency from each other; and transverse modes, which may <b>differ</b> <b>in</b> both frequency and the intensity pattern of the light.

5|$|Viz Media {{licensed}} Fairy Cube for an English-language {{release in}} North America. It previewed the series in its manga anthology Shojo Beat and released the series from May 2008 to November 2008. A digital edition {{was published in}} 2011. Another English translation has been published by Chuang Yi in Singapore, and the series has been translated into several other languages. The series received a range of reviews: reviews of the first volume were generally positive, although the reviewers <b>differed</b> <b>in</b> their thoughts on the conclusion. The final volume placed in ICv2's list of the top 300 bestselling graphic novels for November 2008.|$|E
5|$|A later {{study by}} paleontologists Andrew B. Heckert and Spencer G. Lucas in 1999 {{expanded}} {{the number of}} synapomorphies that diagnose Aetosauria to 18. New synapomorphies included temporal fenestrae, or holes, that opened {{on the side of}} the skull rather than the top, lateral osteoderms articulating with the paramedians, and osteoderms covering the limbs. Aetosaurus was still found to be the most basal member, but the phylogeny of more derived aetosaurs <b>differed</b> <b>in</b> that Typothorax and Paratypothorax were split into two different clades with their sister taxa being Desmatosuchus and Longosuchus, respectively. More importantly, a new aetosaur called Coahomasuchus was included in the analysis. Coahomasuchus was found to be a basal aetosaur closely related to Stagonolepis, and also appeared early in the fossil record of aetosaurs. Previously, basal members were only known from later times, occurring after more advanced aetosaurs.|$|E
5|$|After 1066, William did {{not attempt}} to {{integrate}} his separate domains into one unified realm with one set of laws. His seal from after 1066, of which six impressions still survive, was made for him after he conquered England and stressed his role as king, while separately mentioning his role as Duke. When in Normandy, William acknowledged that he owed fealty to the French king, but in England no such acknowledgement was made– further evidence that the various parts of William's lands were considered separate. The administrative machinery of Normandy, England, and Maine continued to exist separate from the other lands, with each one retaining its own forms. For example, England continued the use of writs, which were not known on the continent. Also, the charters and documents produced for the government in Normandy <b>differed</b> <b>in</b> formulas from those produced in England.|$|E
