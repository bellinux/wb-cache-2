5|$|Fossils of Argentinean ferugliotheriids {{come from}} the Los Alamitos (Ferugliotherium), La Colonia (Ferugliotherium and Argentodites), and Allen Formations (Trapalcotherium). All three are {{approximately}} the same age, dating to the Campanian (84–71mya) or more likely the Maastrichtian (71–66mya), but the La Colonia Formation <b>is</b> <b>perhaps</b> <b>a</b> little younger. The Los Alamitos and Allen Formations may have been deposited in a marshy environments, and the depositional environment of the La Colonia Formations {{may have been an}} estuary, tidal flat, or coastal plain.|$|E
5|$|On August28, 1869, {{three men}} deserted the expedition, {{convinced}} {{that they could not}} possibly survive the trip through the Grand Canyon. They were killed by Native Americans after making it to the rim of the canyon; two days later, the expedition ran the last of the Grand Canyon rapids and reached St. Thomas. Powell led a second expedition in 1871, this time with financial backing from the U.S. government. The explorers named many features along the Colorado and Green rivers, including Glen Canyon, the Dirty Devil River, Flaming Gorge, and the Gates of Lodore. In what <b>is</b> <b>perhaps</b> <b>a</b> twist of irony, modern-day Lake Powell, which floods Glen Canyon, is also named for their leader.|$|E
5|$|The vault of {{the nave}} rises steeply {{in a simple}} quadripartite form, {{in harmony with the}} nave arcade. The eastern end of the choir was {{extended}} and the whole upper part elaborated {{in the second quarter of}} the 14th century by William Joy. The vault has a multiplicity of ribs in a net-like form, which is very different from that of the nave, and <b>is</b> <b>perhaps</b> <b>a</b> recreation in stone of a local type of compartmented wooden roof of which examples remain from the 15th century, including those at St Cuthbert's Church, Wells. The vaults of the aisles of the choir also have a unique pattern.|$|E

5|$|Umbrella: In all written records, {{the oldest}} {{reference}} to a collapsible umbrella dates to the year 21 AD, when Wang Mang (r. 9–23) had one designed for a ceremonial four-wheeled carriage. The 2nd-century commentator Fu Qian added that this collapsible umbrella of Wang Mang's carriage had bendable joints which enabled them to be extended or retracted. A 1st century collapsible umbrella has since been recovered from the tomb of Wang Guang at Lelang Commandery in the Korean Peninsula, illustrated in a work by Harada and Komai. However, the Chinese collapsible umbrella <b>is</b> <b>perhaps</b> <b>a</b> concept that is yet centuries older than Wang's tomb. Zhou Dynasty bronze castings of complex bronze socketed hinges with locking slides and bolts—which {{could have been used}} for parasols and umbrellas—were found in an archeological site of Luoyang, dated to the 6th century BC.|$|E
5|$|The costa (C) is {{the leading}} {{marginal}} vein on most insects, although sometimes {{there is a small}} vein above the costa called the precosta, although in almost all extant insects, the precosta is fused with the costa; The costa rarely ever branches because it is at the leading edge, which is associated at its base with the humeral plate. The trachea of the costal vein <b>is</b> <b>perhaps</b> <b>a</b> branch of the subcostal trachea. Located after the costa is the third vein, the subcosta, which branches into two separate veins: the anterior and posterior. The base of the subcosta is associated with the distal end of the neck of the first axillary (see section below). The fourth vein is the radius (R), which is branched into five separate veins. The radius is generally the strongest vein of the wing. Toward the middle of the wing, it forks into a first undivided branch (R1) and a second branch, called the radial sector (Ra), which subdivides dichotomously into four distal branches (R2, R3, R4, R5). Basally, the radius is flexibly united with the anterior end of the second axillary (2Ax).|$|E

The ballet has also been staged at Sadler's Wells, London and the Metropolitan Opera House, New York.|$|E
25|$|Sometimes the {{restoration}} of the cover is a matter of surgically strengthening the original cover by lifting the original materials and applying new materials for strength.

25|$|It is {{also thought}} there <b>is</b> <b>perhaps</b> <b>a</b> genetic {{predisposition}} for some alcoholics {{that results in}} increased frequency of alcoholic polyneuropathy in certain ethnic groups. During the body’s processing of alcohol, ethanol is oxidized to acetaldehyde mainly by alcohol dehydrogenase; acetaldehyde is then oxidized to acetate mainly by aldehyde dehydrogenase (ALDH). ALDH2 is an isozyme of ALDH and ALDH2 has a polymorphism (ALDH2*2, Glu487Lys) that makes ADLH2 inactive; this allele is more prevalent among Southeast and East Asians and results in a failure to quickly metabolize acetaldehyde. The neurotoxicity resulting from the accumulation of acetaldehyde {{may play a role}} in the pathogenesis of alcoholic polyneuropathy.|$|E

25|$|It {{may have}} been out of this {{atmosphere}} that there was formed a tradition which, going underground for centuries and suffering transformations in the process, appeared in the Middle Ages as the Ars Notoria, a magical art of memory attributed to Apollonius or sometimes to Solomon. The practitioner of the Ars Notoria gazed at figures or diagrams curiously marked and called 'notae' whilst reciting magical prayers. He hoped to gain in this way knowledge, or memory, of all the arts and sciences, a different 'nota' being provided for each discipline. The Ars Notoria <b>is</b> <b>perhaps</b> <b>a</b> descendant of the classical art of memory, or of that difficult branch of it which used the shorthand notae. It was regarded as a particularly black kind of magic and was severely condemned by Thomas Aquinas.|$|E
25|$|John Conolly took up {{residence}} as the third superintendent on 1 June 1839. In April 1839, Serjeant-at-law John Adams, one of the Visiting Justices of the asylum and a founding member and first chairman of Legal & General, suggested that Conolly visit the Lincoln Asylum and see the system operated by Robert Gardiner Hill. He was so impressed by this {{that he decided to}} abolish mechanical restraints at Hanwell. This must have taken enormous powers of persuasion: the existing staff would have to change their work practices and learn how to nurse more effectively those patients with troubling behaviour. However, the reform seemed to avoid the patient suffering further trauma as a result of restraint and being made to feel completely helpless. Conolly succeeded in introducing the reform by 21 September 1839, less than 3 months after he took charge. This <b>is</b> <b>perhaps</b> <b>a</b> testament to the earlier work of Ellis.|$|E
25|$|There are two {{principal}} reasons for concern about Ashton's {{translation of the}} title. Firstly, 'Judaism' in English carries the meaning of 'the profession or practice of the Jewish religion; the religious system or the polity of the Jews', a topic on which Wagner does not touch. 'Judentum' however in 19th-century Germany carried a much broader meaning—roughly analogous to the nonce English word 'Jewdom' (cf. Christendom) and including {{the concept of the}} social practices of the Jews. In particular it carried the pejorative sense of 'haggling' or 'marketeering'—it was used in this sense for example by Karl Marx. Undoubtedly Wagner wished to refer to this sense, in effect using the word as a pun, as the commercialism implied forms the topic of the essay as a whole. It is therefore important to bear in mind the full range of implications of the title-word 'Judentum' in considering the essay as a whole. 'Jewishness', whilst not ideal, <b>is</b> <b>perhaps</b> <b>a</b> closer English approximation to 'Judentum' than 'Judaism'.|$|E
