40|$|Abstract. Applying light {{structure}} of railway vehicle car body is the {{effective way to}} reduce energy consumption and the dynamic forces between rail and wheel. However, light structure will directly reduce the modal frequency of car body and thus increases the possibility of resonant vibration. It is known that increasing the modal frequency of a fully-equipped car body through structure optimization is barely effective. In this paper, three equations to evaluate the <b>bending</b> <b>frequency</b> of a fully-equipped car body are proposed firstly, then {{an effective way to}} enhance the <b>bending</b> <b>frequency</b> of a fully-equipped car body is presented, i. e. elastically suspended the equipment under car body chassis.

40|$|The {{stiffness}} and damping moments that are transmitted by intervertebral joints during sinusoidal bending were determined {{in the blue}} marlin, Makaira nigricans Lac 6 pede. Using a dynamic bending machine, the angular stiffness (Nmrad " 1) and damping coefficient (kgm 2 rad ~ 2 s ~ 1) of the intervertebral joints were measured over a range of <b>bending</b> <b>frequencies,</b> amplitudes and positions along the backbone. Angular stiffness increases with increasing bending amplitude, but, for some joints, {{the rate at which}} it changes with increasing <b>bending</b> <b>frequency</b> is negative. The precaudal intervertebral joints are less stiff than the caudal joints. The damping coefficient, which also shows regional variation, does not change with amplitude but does decrease with increasing <b>bending</b> <b>frequency</b> in joint positions three and five. Stiffness moments along the vertebral column, given the same amount of bending at each joint, are always greater than the damping moments. However, damping moments increase by an order of magnitude with an increase in <b>bending</b> <b>frequency</b> from 0. 5 to 5. 0 Hz. The {{stiffness and}} damping moments determine the work that an external moment, such as muscle, must do over a complete cycle of bending. The external moments and work needed to bend an intervertebral joint are determined largely by the stiffness moments of the intervertebral joints...|$|R

This thesis provides a MATLAB (copyright) code and {{graphical user interface}} (GUI) which rapidly estimates the <b>bending</b> <b>frequencies</b> of rotating beams from the knowledge of <b>bending</b> <b>frequencies</b> of nonrotating beams. The approach {{is based on the}} Rayleigh energy method developed by Yntema. The beams may be rotating or nonrotating, cantilever or hinged, uniform or with linear mass and stiffness distributions, with or without root offsets from the axis of rotation; or uniform with or without tip mass. Especially, the frequencies of both nonrotating and rotating cases can be estimated for (a) beams with and without offset which have mass and stiffness distributions which can be approximated by linear relations and (b) beams with uniform mass and stiffness distributions plus a concentrated mass at the tip.

40|$|This {{dissertation}} describes fundamental extensions to the hinge-spring {{model used}} {{to simulate the}} first mode of blade vibration in wind turbine dynamics. Complete equations of motion are developed while allowing for both bending of the blade perpendicular to its chord and overall motion of the rotor in azimuth and yaw. The model examines {{the relationship between the}} natural rotation frequency of the rotor ω and the fundamental natural <b>bending</b> <b>frequency</b> of the blades without including the <b>bending</b> <b>frequency</b> of the tower. In the case of no yaw motion, perturbation analysis and iteration lead to analytical solutions for the bending and azimuth equations of motion that involve as little simplification of these equations as possible. The natural <b>bending</b> <b>frequency</b> is “stiffened” by the rotor rotation and is expressed as a multiple of the rotor rotation, ω∗ ω. While the <b>bending</b> <b>frequency</b> is used in models using the hinged blade, the solutions found in this work contain more detail than can be found in prior investigations. These analytical solutions reveal that the harmonics with frequencies Nω∗ω (ω ∗ + 1) ω and (ω∗ − 1) ω are involved with the coupling between bending motion and azimuth motion with N = 1, 2, 3,…. Subsequent derivation of the power output for the condition of a relatively large amplitude of blade vibration predicts a noticeable contribution to power generation for the ω∗ ω response, which is verified in the data. ^ Glauret 2 ̆ 7 s momentum transfer theory as extended by Wilson and Lissaman [1974] and de Vries [1979] is modified to allow for blade bending, variations of wind speed with time and position, and variations in wind direction with time. No vertical wind is considered. It is concluded that: (1) the <b>bending</b> <b>frequency</b> and linear combinations with the rotor rotation frequency provide an important contribution under {{at least some of the}} expected operating conditions of the turbine, (2) the dynamic mass imbalance produced by the effects of blade bending is not important for an otherwise balanced rotor, and (3) modest non-symmetric effects to the dynamics such as basic wind shear or changing wind speed and direction enhance the Nω frequencies much more readily than the Nω∗ω frequencies. ...|$|R

3000|$|As a {{critical}} component of the railway vehicle, underframe equipment has a great influence on the ride comfort of railway vehicles due to their big mass and active vibration. Therefore, study on the relationship between suspension parameters of underframe equipment and the modal frequency of carbody is extremely crucial for controlling the ride quality of railway vehicles. In this paper, a finite element model of the carbody was developed to investigate the effects of the suspension location, the mass of the suspension equipment, and the suspension frequency on the mode of the carbody. Then, the matching relationship between the suspension parameters and the modal frequency of the carbody was studied through the transfer function. In addition, roller rig tests were performed to verify the numerical simulation model of the carbody. The results show that the suspension parameters of the underframe equipment have a great influence on the mode of the carbody, especially for the frequency of the first bending mode. To improve the frequency of carbody high-frequency bending and reduce energy transfer, equipment with a large mass should be suspended toward the middle of the carbody. The weight of the equipment strongly affects the first <b>bending</b> <b>frequency</b> and energy transfer of the carbody. The frequency of heavy suspended equipment should be sufficiently low to increase the transmissibility of high frequencies and improve the vibration characteristics of the carbody.

In this paper, the bending-rotation fatigue (BRF) {{test was used to}} study the bending fatigue behavior of NiTi wire laser weldment in the small-strain regime. The fracture mechanism, which includes crack initiation, crack growth and propagation of the weldment in the BRF test, was investigated with the aid of SEM fractography and discussed in terms of the microstructure.
