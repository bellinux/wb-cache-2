40|$|This paper {{investigates the}} role of {{regional}} supranational courts in advancing integration within regional organizations by analyzing three courts. Over {{the course of the}} last decades the design of the European Court of Justice has been emulated by several other supranational courts, two of which are studied in this paper. The court of the Southern African Development Community (SADC), the SADC Tribunal (SADCT), as well as the court of the Andean Community (CAN), the Andean Court of Justice (ACJ), both share the design features of the ECJ. Knowing that the ECJ has significantly contributed to integration within the European Coal and Steel Community and later the European Communities, it could be assumed that an emulated design may engender a similar effect on integration in other regional settings. Empirically, this has been the case neither in SADC nor in CAN. This paper considers several explanatory factors extracted from theory and literature in order to establish reasons for this failure of the organizations to integrate. The analysis shows that legitimacy and problem pressure are the two main variables that indicate the effective advancement of integration. The paper argues that while the SADCT failed to <b>foster</b> <b>regional</b> <b>integration</b> due to its suspension on grounds of it lacking legitimacy before having the opportunity to fully unfold its strengths, the ACJ failed to advance integration because it remained passive due to lacking problem pressure...|$|E

40|$|In Central Africa, non-timber forest {{products}} (NTFP) are traded between Cameroon and neighbouring countries. kola nut (Cola acuminata) is traded between Cameroon, Nigeria and the Central African Republic. Wild mango (Irvingia gabonensis) is traded between Cameroon, Gabon and Equatorial Guinea. Okok (Gnetum africanum) is traded between Cameroon and Nigeria. As for bush butter tree (Dacryodes edulis), there is some trade between Cameroon, Gabon and Congo. Transborder trade of NTFP is based on linguistic, cultural, environmental and monetary complementarities of the countries involved. This survey shows that the quantity of NTFP sold on export markets in the wet tropical forest zone of Cameroon is quite significant, and their value is assessed at 3. 099 million French francs in 1995 and 5. 033 million in 1996. This gives {{an indication of the}} importance of transborder trade between Cameroon and its neighbour countries, and the need to better assess the role of NTFP in diversification of exports. Profit margins of traders are higher for bush butter than for other NTFP. Main markets for bush butter fruit are New-Bell (Douala) and Mfoundi (Yaounde), where traders' margins are higher than the SMIG (guaranteed minimum wage). In addition, the survey shows that the merchants selling wild mango kernels in Abang-Minko border market (Gabon border) in 1995 and 1996 and in Kye-Ossi border market (Equatorial Guinea border) in 1996 also earned margins higher than the SMIG.

30|$|Limited {{integration}} in regional disaster management system causes further vulnerability. Brunei Darussalam is generally praised for {{its efforts to}} <b>foster</b> <b>regional</b> <b>integration</b> of disaster issues in ASEAN. The country actively participates {{in dealing with the}} region’s trans-boundary haze issues as well as addresses health issues by developing a pandemic preparedness and response system such as the Influenza-like Surveillance System operated by the Ministry of Health (MOH). This system gives warning of emerging threats from novel strains of viruses such as Influenza A (H 1 N 1) and (H 5 N 1), which increases the nation’s capacity to prepare the community for prevalent haze and infectious diseases hazards (Brunei Darussalam Government 2011 b). But the country’s disaster management system is very simplistic and inadequately integrated. Vital stakeholders are either left out or are not sufficiently consulted in the disaster management process or framework. There appears to be a strong mismatch between the urban management and the civil engineering services and the country’s environmental/climatic realities. Research institutions in academia as well as the national media appear to be only loosely affiliated with the disaster management framework—they are consulted from time to time, but are not key actors. Regular weather reports {{are an integral part of}} news reporting, but media outlets only go abuzz with disaster-related information during the onset of a major natural hazard event. Based on these dynamics, disaster management needs exceed the capabilities of Brunei’s Civil Engineering Department and National Disaster Management Council, or any other single institution/agency, individually, or even in their current loosely integrated and poorly coordinated way. Moreover, DRR has not been incorporated into school curricula (Brunei Darussalam 2011 b Government) and thus does not constitute a systematic strategic effort compared with disaster response mechanisms in place in Brunei.|$|E
40|$|A Doctoral Thesis. Submitted in partial {{fulfillment}} of the requirements for the award of Doctor of Philosophy of Loughborough University. The post-Cold War era has seen a restructuring of the institutions of global governance and an intensification of international relations, to {{which one of the}} most important responses has been a reinvigoration of regionalism and regionalisation. The proliferation of regionalism has led to increased relations between regional groups in different world regions, and the EU has been central to the development of this new interregional phenomenon. This thesis sets out to test the theory of interregionalism by looking at how the EU has strategically pursued interregionalism, and at how this has subsequently worked in practice. To best achieve this objective the thesis develops a more sophisticated framework of analysis; complex interregionalism. This framework allows for a detailed investigation of how the EU has simultaneously engaged in bilateral and interregional relations in Latin America. The thesis explores the tensions between interregionalism as a strategy and interregionalism in action, principally by drawing lessons from the EU's relations with Latin America, and Mercosur in particular. The most general foundation for this analysis is the study of International Political Economy (IPE), particularly the extensive literature on regional integration and the emerging literature that deals specifically with interregionalism. The thesis starts by presenting a comprehensive framework for analysis of interregional relations using the theory of interregionalism. The theory of interregionalism, ascribes a series of motivations and impacts that interregionalism. should exhibit, all of which are replicated in EU complex interregional strategy. The EU is found to have a consistent and coherent complex interregional strategy that it employs across three world regions: Asia, Africa and Latin America. The EU, notably the Commission, is pursuing an ambitious complex interregional strategy in each region that encompasses different levels of relations with different actors, but a strategy that always centers on the pursuit of pure interregionalism. Whilst the thesis details the EU's pursuit of this consistent complex interregional strategy with all three of the aforementioned world regions, it is the presence of the Andean Community, Central American Common Market and Mercosur in Latin America that marks the region out for deeper analysis. Complex interregional strategy in Latin America is applied consistently to all three regional integration vehicles, confirming the EU desire to pursue pure interregionalism, most notably with Mercosur. Analysis of EU relations with Mercosur reveals a core tension between strategy and action, notably that Commission strategy is not translated into action, as witnessed by the change towards bilateral relations with Brazil in 2007. The thesis finds that more important than the EU inability to translate strategy into action, is its inability to <b>foster</b> <b>regional</b> <b>integration</b> in its partners and encourage more coherent counterparts for the future pursuit of pure interregionalism...|$|E

40|$|Evidence abounds {{to support}} the view that economy of sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) has been growing in recent times, but there is {{considerable}} concern that the growth has not been accompanied by economic transformation. The lack of economic transformation is traceable to low level of investment in transformation activities especially raw material processing industries occasioned, at least in part, by the fact that sub-Saharan Africa has the highest cost of doing business in the world with cost of infrastructure services making up a disproportionately large part of production and trade costs. This is a reflection of serious deficit in the three dimensions of infrastructure, namely quality, quantity and access. Against this background, it was considered topical to devote the plenary session of December 2007 to the issue of infrastructure and economic development in Africa. This volume, therefore, contains the three papers presented at that plenary session. The first paper by César Calderón and Luis Servén on infrastructure and economic development in SSA focused on analysing the linkages between infrastructure and economic development pointing out that the literature on effects of infrastructure on economic development is inconclusive. Noting that physical infrastructures are rarely homogenous and analysing a large panel data for 136 countries, they found that infrastructure development is associated with both higher growth and lower inequality. They also found that while infrastructure made a large contribution to reducing inequality in East and South Asia, the impact was relatively modest in SSA due to poor quality of infrastructure. They concluded that corruption adversely affect impact of infrastructure on productivity and growth stressing, among other things, the importance of independent regulation agencies in offsetting some of the consequences of corruption on infrastructural services. Kennedy K. Mbekeani, in the second paper, presented a review of international experience in infrastructure, trade expansion and regional integration and lessons for Africa. Delving into the relationships between trade, infrastructure and regional expansion, he asserted that improvements in productivity lead to increased trade and can <b>foster</b> <b>regional</b> <b>integration</b> through improved intra-regional trade and industrial relocation. There is persuasive evidence that adequate infrastructure provision is a key requirement for trade liberalisation to achieve its intended objective of efficient resource reallocation and export growth. The paper concluded by providing a summary of some Africa's infrastructure programmes that have the potential to lead to trade expansion and regional integration. Finally, the paper by Mthuli Ncube on financing and managing infrastructure in Africa presents arguments on the relationship between infrastructure investments and economic growth in Africa. Infrastructure encompasses transport, telecommunications, water and sanitation, power and gas, and major water works, and also focuses on quantity versus quality of infrastructure. Ncube also found that, in the literature, the causal nexus between infrastructure capital and economic growth and development, in general, has been ambiguous. However, it does seem one thing is clear, namely that sustainable high economic growth often occurs in an environment where there is a meaningful infrastructure development, although it is not obvious which leads the other. The paper presents the various financing strategies, around Public [...] Private partnerships (PPPs) and examples of PPP-type arrangements in Africa. Ncube concluded the paper by exploring policy implications of the state of infrastructure and economic growth in Africa. Copyright The author 2010.

40|$|The {{impetus for}} {{regional}} integration {{has increased in}} recent years. The 2002 launch of negotiations for the Economic Partnership Agreements (EPA) between the EU and ACP countries on a regional rather than a national basis, has helped promote the cause of regional integration, an issue which has long featured on the agenda for discussions on economic development strategies for these countries. The oldest ACP regional economic communities date back more than 30 years. They were designed to encourage and strengthen trade between member countries, especially for agricultural and agro-alimentary products, their main resources. However, the results have fallen far short of expectations. According to the United Nations Economic Commission for Africa (UNECA), intra-regional trade accounts for 9 % of total trade in West Africa and just 4 % in Central Africa. In the case of West Africa s economic and monetary union, the Union économique et monétaire ouest-africaine (UEMOA), the continent s most advanced region in this sense, the figure is 12 %. By contrast, in the EU {{more than half of}} all trade is conducted between member states. Within the Central African economic community, the Communauté économique d Afrique centrale (CEMAC) and the area covered by the Indian Ocean Commission (IOC), intra-regional trade has actually declined in the past 10 years, according to official figures. Trade also remains weak within the Caribbean Community (CARICOM), since many of the islands produce similar products. Everywhere, international trade has the upper hand over regional trade, even though official figures do not cover all transactions in countries where a sizeable share of commerce remains informal. Fewer taxes, more headaches In some cases, customs duties have been scrapped within regional groupings which, like the UEMOA, have set up customs unions. In others, they are on the verge of being eliminated, as planned by the Southern African Development Community (SADC) and the Pacific Island Country Trade Agreement (PICTA). However, non-tariff barriers often prove to be the most serious obstacles to regional trade, especially for fresh perishable products. The increase in red tape to be negotiated for road transport there are about 30 checkpoints between Dakar and Bamako the pitiful state of the roads themselves, and their complete absence in some countries, go far towards explaining these poor results. Very often, progress towards free trade is hampered by a lack of political will. Many countries are reluctant to abolish customs duties which make an important contribution to their national budgets. The ACP countries are also concerned about the prospect of lower customs duties on imports from Europe, which will come into effect together with the EPAs in 2008. Neither seasonal differences in production schedules nor differing levels of food security are enough to stimulate trade between countries of the same region. Only differences in trade or monetary policies have any real influence, as in the case of trade between Benin and Nigeria. Even so, considerable progress has been made to liberalise trade within regional ACP blocs, at least at the institutional level. In Africa, the goal is to establish a single common market on the continent by 2028. At the same time, other initiatives to <b>foster</b> <b>regional</b> <b>integration</b> are under way, in an effort to improve living conditions for rural dwellers and boost agricultural productivity. Regional information systems make it easier to sound the alarm quickly, for example in cases of livestock epidemics. Exchanges of data, be it on food security or pest control efforts, have the same effect. Other plans are in hand, including an information system for markets in West Africa, which should encourage trade by publishing information on prices and on the availability of products in the region. Common agricultural policies One of the most striking developments of the past few years is the progress made towards regional integration through the creation of common agricultural policies. The most recent example is that of the West African common agricultural policy, the Politique agricole commune ouest africaine (ECOWAAP), adopted in January 2005 by the conference of West African heads of state and government. It is a wide-ranging initiative which seeks to harmonise procedures for land access, natural resource management, assistance for farmers and access to credit. The improvement of regional infrastructures is another crucial element. In CEMAC countries, a number of new roads are being built to improve transport in the region. In East Africa, work will soon be starting on the Mombasa-Nairobi-Addis-Ababa Road Corridor Development Project. The African Development Fund (ADF) estimates that the scheme will increase trade in the region by 500 %. Whilst these efforts towards integration are undoubtedly needed, the regional markets appear to be lacking enough sufficiently remunerative outlets to develop the economic fabric of ACP countries. That is why these countries also seek to maintain or win export markets as a source of foreign currency, in Europe, America and Asia. For them, it is not so much a question of choosing between regional and international markets as establishing solid regional markets before liberalising trade with the rest of the world, and especially with trading blocs of the North. This is the main focus of current discussions between the EU and Africa, since the EU believes the EPAs will be a driving force for regional integration. A mushrooming of regional blocs But the choice of regional communities is a delicate issue. In Africa, there are 14 regional groupings half the countries belong to two groups and 20 belong to three. In southern Africa, the countries of the SADC are divided into two distinct groups which negotiate separately. In the Caribbean, the EU negotiates with the Organisation of Eastern Caribbean States (OECS), which represents eight countries and is itself part of CARICOM, which has 15 member states and also takes part in negotiations for the Free Trade Area of the Americas (FTAA). In the Pacific region, the EU is supporting development of the PICTA free trade zone and is also conducting EPA negotiations with it, since PICTA is an ACP-Pacific grouping. The Pacific Islands also belong to the Pacific Agreement on Closer Economic Relations (PACER) group, which includes Australia and New Zealand, on which they are economically dependent to a large extent. Differences in levels of economic development within regional groupings pose further problems. The least developed countries already have tariff-free access to the European market. Once the EPAs have been concluded, there is a risk that these may no longer be able to protect themselves against competition from imported products. Already, a number of farmers belonging to the Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS) claim that the Common External Tariff (CET) set up by UEMOA is too low. As a result, some countries are reluctant to adopt it. According to a recent UK parliamentary report on international development, the timetable envisaged by the EU for the opening up of ACP markets less than 3 years is too rushed to enable regional groupings to become sufficiently strong to withstand outside competition. The flood of Chinese textiles, which dealt a blow to local European industries after the market was opened up at the beginning of January 2005, shows how hard it is for even the best organised regional groupings to protect themselves. But do ACP countries have any choice? Photographic credits: © Jade Sénégal; © Syfia International.

Different liberalisation scenarios are compared. We find that EPAs with the EU are welfare-enhancing for SADC overall, in particular if reductions in unemployment are considered. Results are robust to variations in key model parameters. For most countries, further gains arise from intra-SADC liberalisation. The possibility of the EU entering an free trade agreement with other countries, such as Mercosur, reduces estimated gains, but they still remain largely positive. Similarly, estimated gains need to be revised downwards if agriculture liberalisation is not as far reaching as a reduction of import barriers for manufactures. At the sectoral level, the largest expansion in SADC economies takes place in the animal agriculture and processed food sectors, while manufacturing becomes comparatively less attractive following EU [...] SADC liberalisation. Results also show the need for the Southern African Customs Union tariff pooling formula to be adjusted to reflect new import patterns as tariffs are removed. Copyright 2008 The author 2007.

40|$|Will {{the current}} wave of <b>regional</b> <b>integration</b> {{arrangements}} {{lead to the}} world being divided into competing inward-looking trading blocs? Or will it {{lead to a more}} open multilateral trading system? Using a multi-country political economy model, and after having shown that global free trade is optimal, the author investigates the possibility of achieving it through regionalism. An outsider country considering entering a trading bloc must weight the tradeoff between the costs of opening its own market to more foreign competition and the gains from getting better access to the bloc's preferential market. The gain of access is always larger, so an outsider would always want to apply for membership in the existing bloc. If the bloc policy is open membership, its expansion would result in global free trade. But if member countries can accept or reject new members, expansion of the bloc is unlikely to yield global free trade. When deciding whether to accept or reject new member, an insider compares the gains from getting preferential access to the new member's market with the losses from having to share its original preferential market with the new member. When the bloc is small, the gains are large enough to offset the losses, so insiders are willing to accept new members. As the bloc expands, the insiders'incentive for expanding decreases, eventually to zero. If only one <b>regional</b> <b>integration</b> arrangement were allowed to form, insiders would stop accepting new members when half the world belonged to the bloc. The remaining outsiders would probably form a bloc of their own, which would lead members of the original bloc to increase its size in anticipation of the creation of the second bloc. The threat of regionalism by outsiders would <b>foster</b> larger <b>regional</b> <b>integration</b> arrangements. In this model, the typical sub-game perfect equilibrium would be two blocs, one of them containing roughly two-thirds of the world, the other containing roughly one-third. Even if blocs form and merge simultaneously, yielding progressively larger symmetrical blocs, they would fail to converge in a single bloc unless the external tariff were low enough. In other words, global free trade could be achieved through bloc expansion if trading blocs lowered their external tariffs when abolishing their internal tariffs.

40|$|This Commission {{background}} note {{sets out}} how the EU proposes to support <b>regional</b> <b>integration</b> amongst ACP countries and promote a differentiated approach {{to the creation of}} free-trade areas based on each region's needs. The Commission sees five dimensions to <b>regional</b> economic <b>integration</b> in ACP countries: trade in goods; trade in services; trade-related areas; enforcement mechanisms; and regional co-operation in a wider sense. The note then goes on to elaborate on the European Commission's view of the issues to be addressed in each of these areas. Comment: In its approach to <b>regional</b> <b>integration</b> the European Commission as a regional organisation itself focuses largely on the creation of regional structures. It almost entirely neglects the development of national capacity to effectively relate to and control, at the policy level, the work of regional structures. This is a major weakness in the EU's approach since it tends to <b>foster</b> <b>regional</b> organisations which float free from national control. This can lead to agreements being concluded, which are left largely un-implemented since there is no strong national commitment to their implementation. This is a direct consequence of there being no strong national input into their formulation. This Commission background note sets {{out how the}} EU proposes to support [...] ...|$|R
40|$|In 1980, the Southern African Development Coordination Conference (SADCC) was estab-lished {{with the}} major {{objectives}} of decreasing economic dependence on the apartheid regime and <b>fostering</b> <b>regional</b> development.
