5|$|The {{lanthanides}} and actinides, in {{the metallic}} state, can exist as either divalent (such as europium and ytterbium) or trivalent (most other lanthanides) metals. The former have fn+1s2 configurations, whereas the latter have fnd1s2 configurations. In 1975, Johansson and Rosengren examined the measured and predicted {{values for the}} cohesive energies (enthalpies of crystallization) of the metallic lanthanides and actinides, both as divalent and trivalent metals. The conclusion was that the increased binding energy of the 5f136d17s2 configuration over the 5f147s2 configuration for nobelium {{was not enough to}} compensate for the energy needed to promote one 5f electron to 6d, as is true also for the very late actinides: thus einsteinium, fermium, mendelevium, and nobelium were expected to be divalent metals, although for nobelium this prediction has not yet been confirmed. The increasing predominance of the divalent state well before the actinide series concludes is attributed to the relativistic stabilization of the 5f electrons, which increases with increasing atomic number: an effect of this is that nobelium is predominantly divalent instead of trivalent, unlike all the other lanthanides and actinides. In 1986, nobelium metal was estimated to have an enthalpy of sublimation between 126kJ·mol−1, a value close to the values for einsteinium, fermium, and mendelevium and supporting the theory that nobelium would form a <b>divalent</b> <b>metal.</b> Like the other divalent late actinides (except the once again trivalent lawrencium), metallic nobelium should assume a face-centered cubic crystal structure. Divalent nobelium metal should have a metallic radius of around 197pm. Nobelium's melting point has been predicted to be 827°C, the same value as that estimated for the neighboring element mendelevium. Its density is predicted to be around 9.9±0.4g·cm−3.|$|E

40|$|Macrophages play a {{key role}} in iron {{metabolism}} by recycling iron through erythrophagocytosis. Ferroportin- 1 (FPN 1) is a transporter protein that is known to mediate iron export from macrophages. Since <b>divalent</b> <b>metals</b> often interact with iron metabolism, we examined if <b>divalent</b> <b>metals</b> could regulate the expression of FPN 1 in macrophages. J 774 macrophage cells were treated with copper, manganese, zinc, or cobalt at 10, 50, or 100 µM for 16 to 24 h. Then, FPN 1 mRNA and protein levels were determined by quantitative real-time PCR and Western blot analyses, respectively. In addition, effects of <b>divalent</b> <b>metals</b> on FPN 1 promoter activity were examined by luciferase reporter assays. Results showed that copper significantly increased FPN 1 mRNA levels in a dose-dependent manner. The copper-induced expression of FPN 1 mRNA was associated with a corresponding increase in FPN 1 protein levels. Also, copper directly stimulated the activity of FPN 1 promoter-driven reporter construct. In contrast, manganese and zinc had no effect on the FPN 1 gene expression in J 774 cells. Interestingly, cobalt treatment in J 774 cells decreased FPN 1 protein levels without affecting FPN 1 mRNA levels. In conclusion, our study results demonstrate that <b>divalent</b> <b>metals</b> differentially regulate FPN 1 expression in macrophages and indicate a potential interaction of <b>divalent</b> <b>metals</b> with the FPN 1 -mediated iron export in macrophages...|$|R

The sequence of predicted transitions between crystal structures, and the volume compression ratios V/V 0 at which these transitions are predicted, are determined largely by the valence z.

40|$|Luminal {{amino acids}} {{and lack of}} luminal acidity {{as a result of}} acid {{neutralization}} by intragastric foodstuffs are powerful signals for acid secretion. Although the hormonal and neural pathways underlying this regulatory mechanism are well understood, the nature of the gastric luminal pH sensor has been enigmatic. In clinical studies, high pH, tryptic peptides, and luminal <b>divalent</b> <b>metals</b> (Ca 2 + and Mg 2 +) increase gastrin release and acid production. The calcium-sensing receptor (CaSR), first described in the parathyroid gland but expressed on gastric G cells, is a logical candidate for the gastric acid sensor. Because CaSR ligands include amino acids and <b>divalent</b> <b>metals,</b> and because extracellular pH affects ligand binding in the pH range of the gastric content, its pH, metal, and nutrient-sensing functions are consistent with physiologic observations.

25|$|Metallothioneins have diverse metal-binding preferences, {{which have}} been {{associated}} with functional specificity. As an example, the mammalian Mus musculus MT1 preferentially binds <b>divalent</b> <b>metal</b> ions (Zn(II), Cd(II),...), while yeast CUP1 is selective for monovalent metal ions (Cu(I), Ag(I),...). Strictly metal-selective MTs with metal-specific physiological functions were discovered by Dallinger et al. (1997) in pulmonate snails (Gastropoda, Mollusca). The Roman snail (Helix pomatia), for example, possesses a Cd-selective (CdMT) and a Cu-selective isoform (CuMT) involved in Cd detoxification and Cu regulation, respectively. While both isoforms contain unvaried numbers and positions of Cys residues responsible for metal ligation, metal selectivity is apparently achieved by sequence modulation of amino acid residues not directly involved in metal binding (Palacios et al. 2011).|$|E
25|$|A common {{technique}} involves engineering {{a sequence}} of 6 to 8 histidines into the N- or C-terminal of the protein. The polyhistidine binds strongly to <b>divalent</b> <b>metal</b> ions such as nickel and cobalt. The protein can be passed through a column containing immobilized nickel ions, which binds the polyhistidine tag. All untagged proteins pass through the column. The protein can be eluted with imidazole, which competes with the polyhistidine tag for binding to the column, or by a decrease in pH (typically to 4.5), which decreases the affinity of the tag for the resin. While this procedure is generally used for the purification of recombinant proteins with an engineered affinity tag (such as a 6xHis tag or Clontech's HAT tag), {{it can also be}} used for natural proteins with an inherent affinity for divalent cations.|$|E
40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to compare the {{efficiency}} of siderophore desferrioxamine B (DFOB) and EDTA in increasing the phytoextraction of metals in sunflower. A 28 -day pot experiment was conducted in a metal-contaminated soil supplied with 200 μmolkg(- 1) of DFOB or EDTA. Pore water was collected and pseudo-polarographic analyses were conducted to assess the impact of the two chelators on the mobility and speciation of metals in the liquid phase. Our results showed that DFOB is not an efficient mobilizing agent of <b>divalent</b> <b>metals</b> in soil. Adding DFOB selectively increased the mobility of trivalent metals while the supply of EDTA simultaneously increased the mobility of both trivalent and <b>divalent</b> <b>metals.</b> EDTA significantly reduced the labile fractions of Cd, Cu, (Pb) and Zn measured in the porewater. The labile concentration of Cd and Zn measured in presence of EDTA was even less than that measured in the control. As expected from the pore water analysis, the addition of DFOB did not affect the phytoextraction of any <b>divalent</b> <b>metals.</b> In contrast, the addition of EDTA enhanced Cu and Ni phytoextraction in sunflower 2. 0 to 2. 8 fold for Cu and 1. 3 to 2. 3 fold for Ni, depending on the cultivar. This result supports different hypotheses regarding the forms and the related pathways in which metals are taken up in presence of EDTA. Based on the results obtained for Ni, whose uptake is rate limited by its internalization across the cell membrane, the direct uptake of metal-EDTA complexes via the non-selective apoplastic pathway is hypothesized to contribute the most to the overall uptake of metals in presence of EDTA, even added at "low" concentrations...|$|R

Recent developments in Cd isotope mass spectrometry have revealed that Cd uptake by phytoplankton causes isotopic fractionation in the open ocean and in culture. Here we investigate the physiochemical pathways that fractionate Cd isotopes by performing subcellular Cd isotope analysis on genetically modified microorganisms.
