40|$|Acquired {{tracheoesophageal fistula}} through esophageal {{diverticulum}} is infrequent. We report tracheoesophageal fistula through esophageal diverticulum in a 55 -year-old male {{who had a}} prolonged tracheostomy tube during 6 months, and a NG tube during 18 months. He suffered from recurrent pneumonia. He complained of a cough associated with eating, and production of sputum mixed with food. To help evaluate the aspiration to the lung {{and the cause of}} aspiration, he was tested using <b>gastrointestinal</b> <b>scintigraphy</b> (gastric emptying study), a chest CT scan (pre & post contrast), and esophagoduodenoscopy. The chest CT scan revealed an acquired tracheoesophageal fistula through esophageal diverticulum, and esophagoduodenoscopy revealed a 3 mm sized fistula that was located - 33 cm from the upper incisor. We treated the tracheoesophageal fistula by clipping under esophagoduodenoscopy. The symptoms of fever, cough, and aspiration were no long observed after the clipping was completed...|$|E
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this {{guideline}} is to assist nuclear medicine practitioners in recommending, performing, interpreting, and reporting the results of gastrointestinal bleeding and Meckel’s diverticulum scintigraphy. Background Information and Definitions <b>Gastrointestinal</b> bleeding <b>scintigraphy</b> is performed in patients suspected of active gastrointestinal bleeding using Tc- 99 m labeled red blood cells (RBCs). Sites of active bleeding are identified by the accumulation and movement of labeled Red Blood Cells within the bowel lumen. Since activity within the lumen of the bowel can move antegrade and retrograde, frequent images (1 image every 10 – 60 sec) will increase the accuracy of localizin...|$|R
25|$|A CT {{angiography}} {{is useful}} for determining {{the exact location of}} the bleeding within the <b>gastrointestinal</b> tract. Nuclear <b>scintigraphy</b> is a sensitive test for detecting occult gastrointestinal bleeding when direct imaging with upper and lower endoscopies are negative. Direct angiography allows for embolization of a bleeding source, but requires a bleeding rate faster than 1mL/minute.|$|R
40|$|The {{results of}} indium- 111 tropolonate {{leucocyte}} scintigraphy in 105 patients with known {{inflammatory bowel disease}} are reviewed. Scintigraphy is as sensitive as radiology in detecting and assessing the extent of active colonic disease, and probably more sensitive in assessing small bowel disease. In a further 40 patients scintigraphy was successfully used as a screening test to identify, or exclude, bowel inflammation in patients with <b>gastrointestinal</b> symptoms. <b>Scintigraphy</b> has advantages over barium studies, being safe, non-invasive, more sensitive than small bowel radiology and giving additional information such as the bowel identification of intra-abdominal abscesses. The time required to label the leucocytes (about 2 hours) and the higher unit cost, unless many scintigrams are performed, are disadvantages...|$|R
40|$|A 59 -year-old man {{had been}} {{admitted}} to our hospital three times with tarry stool, hematemesis, and abdominal discomfort. His medical history included no abdominal operation. Repeated upper endoscopy, colonoscopy, and computed tomography (CT) had been negative. <b>Gastrointestinal</b> bleeding <b>scintigraphy</b> and Meckel scintigraphy had been also negative. In the last admission, he presented abrupt and sharp abdominal pain. An abdominal radiograph showed dilations and air-fluid levels of small intestine and colon. An abdominal CT revealed dilation of small intestine {{with the lack of}} contrasts, mesenteric and bowel wall edema, and “clockwise ” rotation of the mesentery around the mesenteric vessels (whirl sign) (Figure, arrow). The exploratory laparotomy showed a volvulus of the small intestine {{at the base of the}} mesentery, and an edematou...|$|R

Hemangiolymphangioma (HL) is a congenital anomaly and histologically benign tumor, which was composed of both the lymphatic and the blood vessels. We report an adult case of HL complicated by chronic thromboembolic pul-monary hypertension (CTEPH) in a 20 -year-old female. <b>Gastrointestinal</b> bleeding <b>scintigraphy</b> and operative findings elucidate a close rela-tionship between CTEPH and residual HL. This case indicates that HL survivors with remaining left-to-right shunt might lead to CTEPH during the long-term follow-up...|$|R
40|$|Aim. Lower {{gastrointestinal}} (GI) hemorrhage is {{a complex}} clinical problem that requires disciplined evaluation for successful management. This {{study was conducted to}} evaluate the applicability of single photon emission computed tomography/ccomputed tomography (SPECT/CT) in patients with acute lower <b>gastrointestinal</b> bleeding undergoing <b>scintigraphy</b> with Tc- 99 m-labelled red blood cells (RBC), and to assess the additional clinical value of fused images when compared to the standard radionuclide scan. Methods. Twenty-seven patients presenting with acute lower GI tract hemorrhage were studied with conventional dynamic and planar Tc- 99 m-RBC imaging. In 19 patients with positive findings on scans taken within 6 hours, a SPECT/CT study was immediately performed using a hybrid system composed of a dual-head, variable angle gamma camera and an X-ray tube. The number of patients in whom SPECT/CT changed the scintigraphic interpretation with regard to the presence or site of GI blood loss as confirmed by other diagnostic or therapeutical procedures was recorded. Results. I mage fusion was easy and successful in all patients showing perfect correspondence between SPECT and CT data and allowing precise anatomical localization of the sites of Tc- 99 m-RBC extravasation. SPECT/CT had significant impact 011 L the scintigraphic results in 7 / 19 patients (36. 8 %) : in 6 patients it precisely localized the bleeding foci whose location could not be identified in standard scans and in one it excluded the presence of an active GI hemorrhage. Conclusion. SPECT/CT with a hybrid system is feasible and useful for facilitating imaging interpretation and improving the accuracy of Tc- 99 m-RBC scintigraphy in patients with acute lower GI bleeding...|$|R
40|$|OBJECTIVE. There is {{disagreement}} over {{the reliability of}} technetium Tc 99 m (99 mTc) -labeled erythrocyte scintigraphy in the localization of active lower gastrointestinal hemorrhage. A previous study at The New York Hospital-Cornell Medical Center that showed a superior sensitivity for localization of scintigraphy versus angiography in surgical patients led the authors to emphasize scintigraphy as the diagnostic test of first choice in the clinical diagnostic algorithm. The authors hypothesized that tagged erythrocyte scintigraphy can be used accurately as the primary diagnostic modality in localizing acute bleeding and guiding surgical intervention. METHODS. The authors conducted a 5 -year, retrospective analysis of 224 inpatients who underwent scintigraphic imaging for diagnosis and localization of active lower <b>gastrointestinal</b> bleeding. Using <b>scintigraphy</b> as the primary diagnostic test, with colonoscopy, upper endoscopy, and angiography as adjunctive studies, 99 mTc-labeled erythrocyte scans were performed at the clinician's discretion and were reviewed again for study purposes by two nuclear radiologists who were blinded to clinical outcome. Adjunctive diagnostic tests also were ordered for clinical indications. RESULTS. Using delayed periodic scintigraphic imaging, results of 115 scans (51. 3 %) demonstrated bleeding, with 96 scans (42. 9 %) localizing to a specific anatomic site. Patients with positive scans were five {{times more likely to}} require surgery (p < 0. 005) than patients with negative scans, and surgical patients were twice as likely to localize by scintigraphy (p < 0. 0001). Fifty patients (22. 3 %) required surgical intervention to control hemorrhage and had a bleeding site confirmed by both clinical and pathologic examinations. Forty-eight of those patients (96 %) had a bleeding site determined preoperatively. For 37 patients with bleeding sites localized preoperatively by scintigraphy, 36 (97. 3 %) had correct localization based on surgical pathology. Only one patient required a subtotal colectomy solely because of nonlocalized bleeding. No patient bled postoperatively, and there was no mortality in either operated or nonoperated patients. The mean volume of transfused erythrocytes was similar in both scan-localized and nonlocalized surgical patients. CONCLUSION. When performed correctly and interpreted conservatively, scintigraphy is a useful and safe means of guiding segmental resection, and should be the primary tool used in the diagnosis of patients with active lower gastrointestinal bleeding...|$|R
