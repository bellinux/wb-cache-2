5|$|After {{undergoing}} a coronary bypass {{operation in the}} United States in 2000, close aides reported that Sultan Iskandar slowed down somewhat in <b>his</b> <b>pace</b> of life and took to playing golf only on an occasional basis. About with bronchitis in January 2008 saw the Sultan being briefly admitted and treated in a local hospital.|$|E
5|$|Tijani Babangida (born 25 September 1973 in Kaduna) is {{a retired}} Nigerian footballer, who played as a winger. Known for <b>his</b> <b>pace,</b> his playing style was {{sometimes}} {{compared to that of}} Marc Overmars. Babangida spent the majority of his playing career at Ajax. Overall, he played in five different countries on three different continents. At club level, Babangida spent nine years in Netherlands, playing for VVV-Venlo, Roda JC and Ajax, winning the Eredivisie plus KNVB Cup double with the latter side.|$|E
5|$|With <b>his</b> <b>pace</b> {{and high}} field goal percentage, Parker {{has been named}} to six NBA All-Star games, three All-NBA Second Teams, and an All-NBA Third Team. He was also the 2007 NBA Finals MVP. A severe injury to his left {{quadriceps}} tendon in Game 2 {{in the second round}} of the 2017 playoffs ended his season.|$|E
60|$|He counted <b>his</b> <b>paces,</b> and had set to {{work with}} his notebook, when Flora interrupted.|$|R
60|$|Bashford ceased from <b>his</b> <b>pacing</b> up and down, {{and when}} he spoke, his voice was resigned.|$|R
60|$|The king resumed <b>his</b> <b>pacing</b> for a moment, {{coming to}} a halt once more before the two.|$|R
5|$|A {{very fast}} Schumacher {{took the lead}} on track on lap 12 when Berger ran wide, before relinquishing the race lead overall to Berger {{when he made his}} first pitstop, {{confirming}} that <b>his</b> <b>pace</b> {{both before and after the}} red flag was down to him running a three-stop strategy, therefore racing with a lighter car. Berger pitted at the end of lap 15 for his first of two scheduled stops, before retiring a lap later with handling problems. Häkkinen led his first ever laps of a Formula One World Championship race, before pitting at the end of lap 18. Following the first series of pit stops, Schumacher resumed the race lead.|$|E
5|$|During {{the summer}} of 194041, Miller was granted leave {{so that he could}} play interstate cricket. In a season {{shortened}} due to war, Miller played in three matches and scored 140 runs at 28.00. In the second match, which was against South Australia, Miller scored 63, his only fifty of the summer, and bowled {{for the first time at}} first-class level, conceding three runs from a solitary over. In the third match he took his maiden first-class wicket, in a war fundraising match for Stan McCabe's XI against Don Bradman's XI, that of Ken Ridings, caught behind with wicket-keeper Don Tallon. <b>His</b> <b>pace</b> was noticed by Bradman.|$|E
5|$|In Ronaldo's absence, however, Nani's {{style has}} {{developed}} into {{that of a}} more traditional winger; while being able to play on both wings, he is more comfortable on the right, {{where he has been}} known to utilise <b>his</b> <b>pace,</b> ball control, technical skills and trickery to create space and provide crosses for teammates. While capable of cutting off both wings to strike at goal from distance, Nani has substantially fewer goals, yet a substantially higher proportion of assists than his former colleague. Due to his offensive movement, he can also play in a more offensive role, as a forward, inverted winger, second striker, or even in a more central position, as a main striker.|$|E
60|$|Hodder, who had resumed <b>his</b> <b>pacing,</b> {{glanced at}} her involuntarily, and fought an {{inclination}} to agree with her.|$|R
50|$|Okto is {{well known}} for <b>his</b> {{blistering}} <b>pace</b> and could easily exposed the opponent's defender via <b>his</b> powerful <b>pace</b> and speed.|$|R
60|$|All {{this came}} out deadened in tone, {{as if the}} speaker's face had been buried in the pillow. D'Alcacer resumed <b>his</b> <b>pacing.</b>|$|R
5|$|Johnson was {{contracted}} {{to finish the}} edition in 18 months but as the months passed, <b>his</b> <b>pace</b> slowed. He told Charles Burney in December 1757 {{that it would take}} him until the following March to complete it. Before that could happen, in February 1758 he was arrested again for an unpaid debt of £40. The debt was soon repaid by Tonson, who had contracted Johnson to publish the work; this motivated Johnson to finish the edition to repay the favour. Although it took him another seven years to finish, Johnson completed a few volumes of his Shakespeare to prove his commitment to the project.|$|E
5|$|Nurmi's {{trip to the}} 1924 Summer Olympics was {{endangered}} by a knee injury {{in the spring of}} 1924, but he recovered and resumed training twice a day. On 19 June, Nurmi tried out the 1924 Olympic schedule at the Eläintarha Stadium in Helsinki by running the 1500 m and the 5000 m inside an hour, setting new world records for both distances. In the 1500 m final at the Olympics in Paris, Nurmi ran the first 800 m almost three seconds faster. His only challenger, Ray Watson of the United States, gave up before the last lap and Nurmi was able to slow down and coast to victory ahead of Willy Schärer, H. B. Stallard and Douglas Lowe, still breaking the Olympic record by three seconds. The 5000 m final started in less than two hours, and Nurmi faced a tough challenge from countryman Ville Ritola, who had already won the 3000 m steeplechase and the 10,000 m. Ritola and Edvin Wide figured that Nurmi must be tired and tried to burn him off by running at world-record pace. Realizing that he was now racing the two men and not the clock, Nurmi tossed his stopwatch onto the grass. The Finns later passed the Swede as <b>his</b> <b>pace</b> faded and continued their duel. On the home straight, Ritola sprinted from the outside but Nurmi increased <b>his</b> <b>pace</b> to keep his rival a metre behind.|$|E
5|$|Persistently {{hampered}} by ankle and back injuries, Meckiff aggregated only 19 first-class wickets at 40 for the summer. His best innings performance was 4/39 against Queensland {{and he was}} unable to claim more than five wickets in any single match. In one match against arch-rivals New South Wales, the Victorian took a total of 5/155, all of his wickets being Test batsmen. Meckiff was not selected for the Ashes tour. His lack of form saved the Australian selectors the difficult choice of whether to omit him because of his action and avoid a potential run-in with umpires in England. Critics claimed that his new bowling action adopted in 1959–60 had made him legitimate but reduced <b>his</b> <b>pace</b> and effectiveness.|$|E
60|$|He began <b>his</b> <b>pacing</b> again. <b>His</b> {{mother had}} not said one {{word about the}} money. Neither had he. Once more he stopped before her.|$|R
6000|$|... "Complicity," [...] {{he muttered}} faintly, and resumed <b>his</b> <b>pacing,</b> keeping <b>his</b> {{eye on the}} hands as they crept on slowly {{to the time of}} his return.|$|R
6000|$|... "Didn't {{think he}} would have the grace to be ashamed," [...] grunted D'Hubert, who had stood still for a moment. He resumed <b>his</b> <b>pacing</b> while the doctor murmured.|$|R
5|$|A leading {{member of}} the Yorkshire team which {{achieved}} {{a high level of}} success in the time he played, Macaulay was a volatile character who played aggressively. He left a job at a bank to become a professional cricketer, making his first-class debut aged 23 as a fast bowler. Meeting limited success, he altered style to deliver off spin in addition to <b>his</b> <b>pace</b> bowling. This proved so effective that he was chosen to play for England in Test matches. However, his perceived poor attitude towards the game, and an unsuccessful match in the 1926 Ashes probably prevented him playing more Tests. His form slumped following injuries in the late 1920s, but a recovery in the early 1930s led to a recall by England, although he broke down in his second match back. Another injury in 1934 made cricket difficult for him and his first-class career ended in 1935, although he continued playing club cricket until the Second World War. A pilot officer in the Royal Air Force, he died of pneumonia on active service in the Second World War.|$|E
5|$|Arsenal began {{dominating}} in {{the second}} half, and increased their lead after 57 minutes. From the left wing, Overmars used <b>his</b> <b>pace</b> to {{get the better of}} Gary Neville and passed the ball to Anelka, who turned and passed to an unmarked Christopher Wreh. Schmeichel blocked the Liberian's initial shot with his feet, but he was unable to stop the second attempt or Wreh's acrobatic celebration. Despite the setback, United continued to press Arsenal; defender Martin Keown almost put the ball into his own goal from Ryan Giggs's corner. Both teams made mass substitutions in the final third of the game, notably Teddy Sheringham and Luís Boa Morte coming on for Cole – who rarely threatened – and Petit, respectively. Arsenal scored their third in the 72nd minute – Parlour's pass found Anelka, who got around Stam and shot the ball past Schmeichel from a narrow angle, inside the goalkeeper's near post. Near the end, Sheringham wasted a goal-scoring opportunity, shooting wide.|$|E
5|$|As a player, Shearer {{was often}} styled {{as a classic}} English centre-forward, owing to his strength, {{physical}} stature, heading ability and strong shot, which enabled him to be highly prolific goalscorer. Of his 206 Newcastle goals, 49 were scored with his head. Earlier in his career, especially at Southampton, Shearer played a more creative role: providing chances for fellow strikers, and making runs into space, owing to his early development as a midfielder. Later on in his career, Shearer played a more forward role, after his age robbed him of some of <b>his</b> <b>pace.</b> Able to hold the ball up well, he often functioned as a target man, providing balls for other players. Although his strength allowed him {{to hold on to}} the ball, his playing style sometimes brought him criticism – most commonly that his play was too physical, and that he used his elbows too aggressively. It was this which contributed to both of his sendings off, although one was later rescinded on appeal.|$|E
6000|$|... 'Let him go {{out with}} his Red Lama,' said the horse-dealer with visible effort. 'He is fond of the old man. He can learn <b>his</b> <b>paces</b> by the rosary at least.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Stephen," [...] she began, [...] "do {{you mean}} to say--?" [...] There she stopped, utterly unable to speak. He ceased <b>his</b> <b>pacing</b> and sat down beside her and took her hand.|$|R

5|$|As {{opportunities}} for slow bowling became infrequent, he contemplated retirement. Although he dismissed Cyril Washbrook {{in the first}} over of Victoria's match against Wally Hammond's touring England team of 1946–47, he was skeptical about <b>his</b> <b>pace</b> bowling. After that match {{he did not take}} a wicket for the next two months. It took further encouragement from Australian captain Don Bradman after he played against Bradman's South Australians. Bradman told Johnston that the selectors thought highly of his potential as a medium-fast bowler to reinforce the short bursts of pace spearheads Ray Lindwall and Keith Miller and that pace bowlers were in short supply, whereas spinners were plentiful. In the same season, Colin McCool, Ian Johnson, Bruce Dooland and George Tribe had all played in Tests as specialist spinners. Johnston ended the season with only 12 wickets at 33.16 from six matches.|$|E
5|$|At {{the end of}} {{the first}} racing lap, Vettel led by 2.8 seconds from Webber, who was {{followed}} by Alonso, Rosberg, Hamilton, Massa, Button, Schumacher, Kubica, Hülkenberg, Sutil, Barrichello, Kobaysahi, Heidfeld, Alguersari, Liuzzi, Buemi, Glock, Petrov, Kovalainen, Yamamoto, Trulli, Senna and di Grassi. Alonso chose a cautious approach and lost four to five seconds while building up <b>his</b> <b>pace</b> slowly in the early stages. Sutil ran off the circuit but continued after losing his position to both Williams drivers. Webber lost grip on the next lap after running across the outside kerbing and spinning across the track onto the wall between turns twelve and thirteen; he slid back onto the circuit and collected Rosberg, forcing both drivers to retire. The debris on-track from the accident called the safety car to be deployed. Kobayashi, Petrov, Heidfeld and Buemi all made pit stops for intermediate tyres during the safety car period.|$|E
5|$|Bradman's {{relentless}} use of <b>his</b> <b>pace</b> {{attack and}} fieldsmen also raised eyebrows. At the time, Lindwall and Miller were groundbreaking fast bowlers, with high pace {{and the ability}} to deliver menacing short-pitched bowling at the upper body of the English batsmen. Prior to the Second World War, pace bowlers were generally much slower and did not often bowl at the body. England had yet to develop bowlers such as Lindwall and Miller, and as a result, Australia were able to pepper the upper body of the opposition without fear of retaliation. At times, the public found Lindwall and Miller's short-pitched bowling to be excessive and booed the Australians. On the fielding front, Barnes was deployed as close to the bat as possible at either forward short-leg or point, with one foot on the pitch. This had an intimidatory effect on the batsmen and led many to question whether it was {{in the spirit of the}} game.|$|E
6000|$|And {{only the}} priest {{continued}} <b>his</b> <b>pacing,</b> flinging round the skirt of his soutane {{at each end}} of his beat. Decoud murmured to him ironically: [...] "Those gentlemen talk about their gods." ...|$|R
60|$|I {{gave him}} so square {{a look that}} he bent {{his head to the}} ground. My {{grandfather}} stopped in <b>his</b> <b>pacing</b> and <b>his</b> eye rested upon me, in sorrow rather than in anger, I thought.|$|R
6000|$|... "I'm quite {{satisfied}} with <b>his</b> <b>paces,</b> I know," [...] said Fred, who required all {{the consciousness of}} being in gay company to support him; [...] "I say his trot is an uncommonly clean one, eh, Horrock?" ...|$|R
5|$|He {{returned}} to Australia in 1984 and after training in Brisbane, {{he was selected}} for the 1984 Summer Olympics in Los Angeles despite winning neither backstroke event at the Australian Championships. Arriving in the United States, Kerry was scheduled {{to compete in the}} 100m backstroke and 4100m medley relay. Kerry swam quickly to win his heat in the 100m in a time of 57.15s, qualifying third fastest for the final. However, he was unable to improve <b>his</b> <b>pace</b> in the final, finishing fifth in a time of 57.18s, 0.69s from the bronze medal. In the medley relay, Kerry and Evans joined Glenn Buchanan and Mark Stockwell, who swam the butterfly and freestyle respectively. They were no match for the Americans, who had three of the four gold medallists in the corresponding individual events and finished almost four seconds ahead. Kerry had Australia in third place at the first change, finishing his leg in a time of 57.12s, but by this point the Americans were already 1.71s ahead. Australia remained third at every change and were beaten by the second-placed Canadians by just 0.02s.|$|E
5|$|However, in an {{unexpected}} return, Cissé {{was able to}} come on as a 75th-minute substitute in the second leg of Liverpool's Champions League quarter-final tie with Juventus on 13 April 2005. He went on to score both Liverpool goals in their last Premiership match of the season, a 2–1 win over Aston Villa and also converted a penalty in Liverpool's penalty shootout win over AC Milan in the Champions League final. During the 2005–06 season, Liverpool manager Rafael Benítez deployed Cissé on the right wing on numerous occasions. While <b>his</b> <b>pace</b> made him well suited to such a role, it was doubtful whether he {{would be happy to}} continue in this role rather than in his preferred position as striker. He scored two goals as Liverpool won the 2005 UEFA Super Cup. Cissé also scored Liverpool's opening goal in the 2006 FA Cup Final with a sliding shot past West Ham United keeper Shaka Hislop. Liverpool went on to win 3–1 on penalties. He ended the 05/06 season with 19 goals in all competitions.|$|E
5|$|In 1990, Monaco sent scout Arnold Catalano {{to watch}} Henry, {{then at the}} age of 13 in a match. Henry scored all six goals as his side won 6–0. Catalano asked him to join Monaco without even {{attending}} a trial first. Catalano requested that Henry complete a course at the elite Clairefontaine academy, and despite the director's reluctance to admit Henry due to his poor school results, he was allowed to complete the course and joined Arsène Wenger's Monaco as a youth player. Subsequently, Henry signed professional forms with Monaco, and made his professional debut on 31 August 1994, in a 2–0 loss against Nice. Although Wenger suspected that Henry should be deployed as a striker, he put Henry on the left wing because he believed that <b>his</b> <b>pace,</b> natural ball control and skill would be more effective against full backs than centre-backs.|$|E
60|$|Away in {{the room}} under the Lion's Tower, the Count of Aquila, too, <b>paced</b> <b>his</b> chamber ere he sought his couch, and in <b>his</b> <b>pacing</b> caught sight of {{something}} that arrested his attention, and provoked a smile. In a corner, among his harness which Lanciotto had piled there, his shield threw back the light, displaying the Sforza lion quartered with the Aquila eagle.|$|R
6000|$|... "His claim?" [...] quoth he, checking, {{to give me}} a long, cool stare. He laughed shortly {{and resumed}} <b>his</b> <b>pacing,</b> I keeping step with him. [...] "Why, is he not the Pope's son, and is not that claim enough?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Didn't {{think he}} would have the grace to be ashamed!" [...] mumbled D'Hubert, {{resuming}} <b>his</b> <b>pacing</b> while the doctor murmured, [...] "It's very amusing. Ashamed! Shame was not exactly his frame of mind. However, you may look at the matter otherwise." ...|$|R
