5|$|The manga was {{not popular}} initially. Although he {{suspected}} the fighting genre would appeal more to its shōnen audience, Toriyama tried {{to stick to}} the Journey to the West adventure aspect which he himself enjoyed. Such as having the setting change each chapter, different enemies popping up, and different locations. It was only after he became tired of Torishima nagging about its popularity that Toriyama gave in and developed more battles with the first shown Tenkaichi Budōkai. Despite his reluctance, the author said <b>it</b> <b>felt</b> <b>good</b> when the series picked up in popularity at that point. However, he said he still tried to resist by returning to the adventure aspect with the Red Ribbon Army arc, and visiting Penguin Village from Dr. Slump to add comedy. When that did not work out, fighting became the main theme for the manga.|$|E

500|$|One of Lex's key {{characteristics}} is his curiosity for the unexplained. Lex's primary motive for his [...] "shady" [...] actions derives from his curiosity, specifically beginning {{from the moment}} he and Clark meet after Lex hits Clark with his Porsche. Clark always appearing when something strange happens in Smallville does nothing but fuel Lex's curiosity. Rosenbaum believes that Lex's only sees two options: [...] "For Lex, it's either take a nice ride to Metropolis and work with his dad, or find out what's going on with this strong, strange fellow, Clark Kent." [...] Another characteristic of Smallville 's Lex Luthor—one that is being developed {{over the course of the}} series—is his evilness. Rosenbaum believes that what the audience sees in Lex's dark side in the early seasons is merely a taste of what the character is truly capable of. In the season two premiere [...] "Vortex", Rosenbaum requested Greg Beeman to shoot a close-up of him after he shoots Nixon, in an effort to open a window into Lex's darker side. Rosenbaum intended to leave the interpretation of whether Lex enjoyed killing Nixon open to the audience. As Beeman explains Rosenbaum's thoughts, [...] "...either Lex is horrified and appalled, or he liked it, and <b>it</b> <b>felt</b> <b>good</b> to him". According to Rosenbaum, when Lex reaches that point where he uses all of his mind, and [...] "really flips out", that is the point where the [...] "world needs to hide". Television reviewer Brian Byun felt that it was this struggle between good and evil inside Lex that not only made him an anti-hero, but also, given that the audience familiar with Lex's mythology and the knowledge that he will end up being Superman's greatest enemy, make Smallvilles Lex Luthor a [...] "tragic figure [...] almost Shakespearean grandeur".|$|E
