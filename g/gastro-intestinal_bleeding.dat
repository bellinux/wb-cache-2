40|$|Abstract Background Colo-duodenal fistula {{is a rare}} {{complication}} of malignant and inflammatory bowel disease. Cases with malignant colo-duodenal fistulae can present with symptoms from the primary, from the fistula or from metastatic disease. The fistula often results in diarrhoea and vomiting with dramatic weight loss. Upper abdominal pain is usually present as is general malaise both from {{the presence of the}} disease and from the metabolic sequelae it causes. The diarrhoea relates to colonic bacterial contamination of the upper intestines rather than to a pure mechanical effect. Vomiting may be faeculant or truly faecal and eructation foul smelling but in the case reports this 'classic' symptomatology was often absent despite a fistula being present and patent enough to allow barium through it. Occasionally patients will present with a <b>gastro-intestinal</b> <b>bleed.</b> Case presentation We present an unusual case of colorectal carcinoma, where a 65 year old male patient presented with diarrhoea and vomiting secondary to a malignant colo-duodenal fistula near the hepatic flexure. Adenocarcinoma was confirmed on histology from a biopsy obtained during the patient's oesophageogastroduodenoscopy, and the fistula was demonstrated in his barium enema. Staging computed tomography showed a locally advanced carcinoma of the proximal transverse colon, with a fistula to the duodenum and regional lymphadenopathy. The patient was also found to have subcutaneous metastasis. Following discussions at the multidisciplinary meeting, this patient was referred for palliation, and died within 4 months after discharge from hospital. Conclusion We present the case, discuss the management and review the literature. Colo-duodenal fistulae from colonic primaries are rare but early diagnosis may allow curative surgery. This case emphasises the importance of accurate staging and repeated clinical examination. </p...|$|R

Medical interventions are acting {{at different levels}} of medical care and a range of specialist are involved in the process, starting from family practitioners to surgeons, as well as highly trained specialist in interventional endoscopy or radiology. This review is trying to establish the landmarks in the early assessment and care of patients with upper <b>gastro-intestinal</b> <b>bleeding,</b> irrespective of the morphological cause of the bleeding. We propose a protocol for the management both of portal and non-portal upper-gastrointestinal bleedings, prior to endoscopic diagnosis.

The protocol is marking the essential gestures with their relevance for the bleeding patient but also reminds the significance of clinical evaluation and safety in transportation of the patient to the nearest emergency room. A battery of simple test should be performed in every patient and data interpreted with care, as results vary according to the level of haemodynamic compensation. Standard empiric therapy for upper <b>gastro-intestinal</b> <b>bleeding</b> is not yet been established but a couple of alternatives emerge as possible solutions.

40|$|BackgroundMesenteric {{angiography}} {{is commonly}} {{employed in the}} modern‐day investigation of <b>gastro‐intestinal</b> <b>bleeding</b> if the bleeding sites cannot be identified by endoscopic means.

Therefore, mesenteric angiography was arranged. ResultsThe initial angiography failed to demonstrate the bleeding site, which only became obvious on a repeat study, when embolisation was performed to achieve haemostasis. DiscussionVasospasm probably accounted for the initial negative study, as the second angiography was able to demonstrate contrast extravasation without the use of any anticoagulant or thrombolytic agent.

40|$|Background: Amongst others, cocaine {{consumption}} has a {{detrimental effect}} in the vascular supply to the mesenteric area causing abdominal ischemic changes. Early recognition of these changes and adequate treatment are essential to avoid serious complications and possible death of the patient from sepsis. Case report: In this case study, the subject is a 40 -years-old gentleman presenting with acute abdominal pain due to multiple ischemic changes in both small bowel and sigmoid loops. The patient required emergency surgical intervention consisting of bowel resection and anastomosis. The pathologic analysis of the segment showed transmural necrosis and necrotizing phlebitis caused by the ingestion of drugs or toxic agents. The patient later confirmed the habitual consumption of cocaine. Discussion: The increase in cocaine consumption and other recreational toxins substructed from erythroyilon coca alcaloids amongst young people have generated {{a large number of}} admissions to Hospital Accident and Emergency Departments with patients complaining of acute abdominal pain. In many of these cases, surgical intervention is required and in some cases patients will sadly die without a proper diagnosis. Some of the most common effects of cocaine and its compounds includes; hollow viscus perforation, <b>gastro-intestinal</b> <b>bleed,</b> and other vascular problems such as enteritis and ischemic colitis. It appears clear that there is a great need for an advance history taking of these patients and their habit to cocaine and other drugs together with a urine test for drug screening. These together with a suspicion of a non- occlusive ischemic bowel caused by the effects of cocaine in young adults with no cardiac risk factors will guide clinicians and establish, and plan the correct treatment for these categories of patients...|$|R

40|$|Abstract Background Deaths from liver {{cirrhosis}} have increased at least 8 fold since the 1970 's in the UK and further increases are anticipated, {{whereas in the}} rest of Europe liver deaths are decreasing. In the UK, we urgently need strategies to detect those who misuse alcohol and are at risk of developing alcoholic liver disease before they get to that point. One potential strategy is to screen admissions to hospital with alcohol related conditions for evidence of alcohol misuse. Surprisingly, there has been no research into the important question of where the opportunities are to detect those who misuse alcohol – primary or secondary care. We attempted to answer this firstly by conducting a retrospective analysis of the medical notes of 94 patients diagnosed with alcohol induced {{liver cirrhosis}} between 1 st January 1995 and 31 st December 2000 at Southampton General Hospital with the purpose of identifying admissions to hospital prior to a diagnosis of alcoholic liver disease. In {{the second part of the}} study, we interviewed patients with alcoholic liver disease about their contact with health services. Results Before diagnosis of alcoholic liver disease, 33 % (31 / 94) of the patients had had an admission to hospital for an alcohol related condition. There was a mean of 7 years and 1 month (SD 6 years 3 months) between the first alcohol-related admission and presentation with alcoholic liver disease (in those who had had admissions). The commonest reason for alcohol related admission was falls/fractures/injuries, followed by non-variceal <b>gastro-intestinal</b> <b>bleeds.</b> Patients with alcoholic liver disease who were interviewed had seen their General Practitioner on average at least 2 times per year. Conclusion Most patients who develop alcohol-induced cirrhosis do not have an admission to hospital with an alcohol related condition before developing alcoholic liver disease. Therefore, if we screen patients admitted to hospital with alcohol related conditions for evidence of alcohol misuse, we could potentially detect around a third of those at risk of developing cirrhosis. Although secondary care has an important role to play in detecting those at risk, the main opportunity for detection is in primary care. </p...|$|R

40|$|Potentially {{inappropriate}} prescribing is {{a common}} problem, especially in elderly care. To tackle this problem, Irish medical experts have developed a list of criteria when medication should be added or omitted based upon the patient's physical condition and medication use, known as the STOPP and START criteria. The STOPP and START criteria have been formulated to identify the prescribing of potentially inappropriate medicines (PIMs) and potential prescribing omissions (PPOs). One {{of the most common}} problems of inappropriate prescribing is gastro-intestinal track bleedings. For this purpose, nine of the 87 STOPP and START criteria are designed to prevent this. However, the prevalence of gastro-intestinal track bleedings has not been established when these nine STOPP and START criteria are violated.

40|$|BACKGROUND: The {{course of}} acute {{pancreatitis}} (AP) is unpredictable and {{can vary from}} mild to lethal. Mortality varies from low (< 2 %) in mild cases to high (20 %- 70 %) {{in the case of}} infected pancreatic necrosis. Surgical management has not been investigated in well-designed trials. Based on literature review and retrospective results from our institution, recent insights are summarized and recommendations concerning surgical treatment of AP are given. METHODS: Data of patients who underwent necrosectomy for AP in our hospital in the period 1988 - 2001 were reviewed. Surgical treatment strategy was divided into open abdomen strategy (OAS) and primary closure with continuous postoperative lavage (CPL). An extensive database literature search was performed to obtain articles on surgical management of AP. Level 5 evidence articles were excluded. RESULTS: In our institution, 38 patients were treated with OAS and 21 with CPL. Mortality was high (47 % in the OAS group and 33 % in the CPL group). The primary cause of mortality was multiorgan failure. Only 50 manuscripts from the literature search contained useful data. Mortality of patients with OAS and CPL treatment was 27 % and 15 %. respectively. Fewer cases of <b>gastro-intestinal</b> fistulas. <b>bleeding</b> and re-interventions were reported with CPL.

40|$|BACKGROUND: There {{has been}} much debate {{recently}} on the best type of thromboprophylaxis following elective total joint replacement surgery. OBJECTIVE: This study aims to compare rates of venous thromboembolism (VTE), <b>gastro-intestinal</b> (GI) <b>bleeding</b> and mortality events, with use of new oral anticoagulants (NOAC) or low-molecular-weight heparins (LMWHs) compared with aspirin in patients undergoing total joint replacement. METHODS: A population-based retrospective cohort study was performed using the Clinical Practice Research Datalink. Patients >/= 18 years of age who had undergone total knee (n = 3261) or hip replacement (THR (n = 4016)) between 2008 and 2012 were included. Within this population, three cohorts were selected, based on their first prescription within the 35 -day period after surgery: use of NOACs only, LMWHs only and aspirin only. Incidence rates were calculated, and Cox proportional hazard models were fitted to estimate the risk of VTE, GI bleeding and all-cause mortality {{with the use of}} NOACs and LMWHs compared with aspirin use after total knee replacement and THR. We statistically adjusted our analyses for lifestyle factors, comorbidities and concomitant drug use. RESULTS: Total knee replacement and THR patients currently on LMWHs had higher risk of VTE (HR = 17. 2 (6. 9 - 43. 0) and HR = 39. 5 (18. 0 - 87. 0), respectively), GI bleeding (HR = 20. 9 (1. 9 - 232. 3) and HR = 2. 0 (0. 2 - 17. 2), respectively) and all-cause mortality (HR = 4. 3 (1. 7 - 12. 4) and HR = 4. 0 (2. 4 - 6. 7), respectively). NOAC use was associated with an increased risk of GI bleeding in patients undergoing THR surgery. CONCLUSIONS: In contrast to previous studies, we found an increased risk of VTE, GI bleeding and all-cause mortality with the use of LMWHs compared with aspirin. Risk of GI bleeding was increased with the use of NOACs compared with aspirin use after THR surgery. Copyright (c) 2016 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd...|$|R

We previously classified the severity of clinical presentation and course of all major bleeding events from the EINSTEIN, AMPLIFY and HOKUSAI-VTE trials separately. The current aim was to combine these findings in order to increase precision, assess a class effect and analyse presentation and course for different types of bleeding, i. e. intracranial, gastro-intestinal, and other. We classified the clinical presentation and course of all major bleeding events using pre-defined criteria. Both classifications comprised four categories; one being the mildest, and four the most severe. Odds ratios (OR) were calculated for all events classified as category three or four between fXa-inhibitors and VKA recipients. Also, ORs were computed for different types of bleeding. Major bleeding occurred in 111 fXa-inhibitor recipients and in 187 LMWHNKA recipients. The clinical presentation was classified as category three or four in 35 % and 48 % of the major bleeds in fXa inhibitor and VKA recipients, respectively (OR 0. 59, 95 % CI 0. 36 - 0. 97). For intracranial, <b>gastro-intestinal</b> and other <b>bleeding</b> a trend towards a less severe presentation was observed for patients treated with fXa inhibitors.
