5|$|Despite their {{relatively}} smaller brains {{compared to}} other primates, lemurs have demonstrated levels of technical intelligence <b>in</b> <b>problem</b> solving that are comparable to those seen in simians. However, their social intelligence differs, often emphasizing within-group competition over cooperation, which {{may be due to}} adaptations for their unpredictable environment. Although lemurs have not been observed using objects as tools in the wild, they can be trained to use objects as tools in captivity and demonstrate a basic understanding about the functional properties of the objects they are using.|$|E

5|$|Of {{the many}} studies on behavior-based early {{intervention}} programs, most are case reports {{of up to}} five participants and typically examine a few problem behaviors such as self-injury, aggression, noncompliance, stereotypies, or spontaneous language; unintended side effects are largely ignored. Despite the popularity of social skills training, its effectiveness is not firmly established. A randomized controlled study of a model for training parents <b>in</b> <b>problem</b> behaviors in their children with AS showed that parents attending a one-day workshop or six individual lessons reported fewer behavioral problems, while parents receiving the individual lessons reported less intense behavioral problems in their AS children. Vocational training is important to teach job interview etiquette and workplace behavior to older children and adults with AS, and organization software and personal data assistants can improve the work and life management of people with AS.|$|E

Therefore, one bad Strowger selector could block many calls until subscriber complaints alerted staff to the problem.|$|E
25|$|Following a phenomenological {{study of}} nine {{individuals}} involved in sexual masochistic sessions who regarded pain {{as central to}} their experience, sexual masochism was described as an addiction-like tendency, with several features resembling that of drug addiction: craving, intoxication, tolerance and withdrawal. It was also demonstrated how the first masochistic experience is placed on a pedestal, with subsequent use aiming at retrieving this lost sensation, much {{as described in the}} descriptive literature on addiction. The addictive pattern presented in this study suggests an association with behavioral spin as found <b>in</b> <b>problem</b> gamblers.|$|E
25|$|In {{industrial}} statistics, simplices arise <b>in</b> <b>problem</b> formulation and in algorithmic solution. In {{the design}} of bread, the producer must combine yeast, flour, water, sugar, etc. In such mixtures, only the relative proportions of ingredients matters: For an optimal bread mixture, if the flour is doubled then the yeast should be doubled. Such mixture problem are often formulated with normalized constraints, so that the nonnegative components sum to one, {{in which case the}} feasible region forms a simplex. The quality of the bread mixtures can be estimated using response surface methodology, and then a local maximum can be computed using a nonlinear programming method, such as sequential quadratic programming.|$|E

25|$|While {{dealing with}} crisis, both {{personal}} and societal, there are five basic principles outlined for intervention. Victims are initially {{at high risk for}} maladaptive coping or immobilization. Intervening as quickly as possible is imperative. Resource mobilization should be immediately enacted in order to provide victims with the tools they need to return to some sort of order and normalcy, in addition to enable eventual independent functioning. The next step is to facilitate understanding of the event by processing the situation or trauma. This is done in order to help the victim {{gain a better understanding of}} what has occurred and allowing him or her to express feeling about the experience. Additionally, the counselor should assist the victim(s) <b>in</b> <b>problem</b> solving within the context of their situation and feelings. This is necessary for developing self-efficacy and self-reliance. Helping the victim get back to being able to function independently by actively facilitating problem solving, assisting in developing appropriate strategies for addressing those concerns, and in helping putting those strategies into action. This is done in hopes of assisting the victim to become self-reliant.|$|E
25|$|In {{computational}} complexity theory, computer algorithms of exponential complexity {{require an}} exponentially increasing amount of resources (e.g. time, computer memory) {{for only a}} constant increase <b>in</b> <b>problem</b> size. So for an algorithm of time complexity 2x, if a problem of size x=10 requires 10 seconds to complete, and a problem of size x=11 requires 20 seconds, then a problem of size x=12 will require 40 seconds. This kind of algorithm typically becomes unusable at very small problem sizes, often between 30 and 100 items (most computer algorithms {{need to be able}} to solve much larger problems, up to tens of thousands or even millions of items in reasonable times, something that would be physically impossible with an exponential algorithm). Also, the effects of Moore's Law do not help the situation much because doubling processor speed merely allows you to increase the problem size by a constant. E.g. if a slow processor can solve problems of size x in time t, then a processor twice as fast could only solve problems of size x+constant in the same time t. So exponentially complex algorithms are most often impractical, and the search for more efficient algorithms is one of the central goals of computer science today.|$|E
