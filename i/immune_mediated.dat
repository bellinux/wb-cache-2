5|$|Autoimmune {{disorders}} {{can often}} be traced to antibodies that bind the body's own epitopes; many can be detected through blood tests. Antibodies directed against red blood cell surface antigens in <b>immune</b> <b>mediated</b> hemolytic anemia are detected with the Coombs test. The Coombs test is also used for antibody screening in blood transfusion preparation and also for antibody screening in antenatal women.|$|E
5|$|In rare cases, beagles {{may develop}} <b>immune</b> <b>mediated</b> {{polygenic}} arthritis (where {{the immune system}} attacks the joints) even at a young age. The symptoms can sometimes be relieved by steroid treatments. Another rare disease in the breed is neonatal cerebellar cortical degeneration. Affected puppies are slow, have lower co-ordination, fall more often and don't have a normal gait. It has an estimated carrier rate of 5% and affected rate of 0.1%. A genetic test is available.|$|E
25|$|The direct Coombs test is used {{to confirm}} that the fetus or neonate has an <b>immune</b> <b>mediated</b> {{hemolytic}} anemia.|$|E

25|$|Central neuropathic pain {{is found}} in spinal cord injury, {{multiple}} sclerosis, and some strokes. Aside from diabetes (see diabetic neuropathy) and other metabolic conditions, the common causes of painful peripheral neuropathies are herpes zoster infection, HIV-related neuropathies, nutritional deficiencies, toxins, remote manifestations of malignancies, <b>immune</b> <b>mediated</b> disorders and physical trauma to a nerve trunk. Neuropathic pain is common in cancer {{as a direct result}} of cancer on peripheral nerves (e.g., compression by a tumor), or as a side effect of chemotherapy (chemotherapy-induced peripheral neuropathy), radiation injury or surgery.|$|E
2500|$|This {{has led to}} {{the recent}} {{proposal}} that the spectrum of autoimmunity should be viewed along an “immunological disease continuum,” with classical autoimmune diseases at one extreme and diseases driven by the innate immune system at the other extreme. [...] Within this scheme, the full spectrum of autoimmunity can be included. [...] Many common human autoimmune diseases can be seen to have a substantial innate <b>immune</b> <b>mediated</b> immunopathology using this new scheme. [...] This new classification scheme has implications for understanding disease mechanisms and for therapy development.|$|E

2500|$|The Nutritional Immunology and Molecular Medicine Laboratory (NIMML) {{was founded}} in 2002 to {{investigate}} fundamental mechanisms of gut enteric immunity, and identifying biomarkers and therapeutic targets for inflammatory and immune-mediated diseases. The center has [...] discovered the mechanism of action underlying the anti-inflammatory actions of [...] Conjugated linoleic acid in inflammatory bowel disease, [...] and the insulin sensitizing and anti-inflammatory effects of abscisic acid. [...] Its Center for Modeling Immunity to Enteric Pathogens [...] Program is applying high performance computing techniques to model and simulate human immunology systems and help immunologists conduct quick in silico experiments to narrow down experimental design, validate their hypotheses and save significant time and laboratory cost. [...] The NIMML is collaborating with the Center for Global Health at University of Virginia, the Department of Gastroenterology and University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill and other medical schools and leading several human clinical trials on safer therapies for inflammatory and <b>immune</b> <b>mediated</b> diseases.

40|$|Plants {{and animals}} have evolved {{intracellular}} nucleotide-binding (NB) domain and leucine-rich repeat (LRR) -containing immune receptors (NLRs) to perceive non-self and trigger immune responses. Plant NLRs detect strain-specific pathogen effectors and activate immune signaling leading to extensive transcriptional reprogramming and termination of pathogen infection. Here we review the recent findings in barley MLA <b>immune</b> receptor <b>mediated</b> <b>immune</b> responses against the barley powdery mildew fungus.
