40|$|In {{classical}} risk theory, {{the surplus}} {{process is a}} very important model for understand-ing how the capital or surplus of an insurance company evolve over time. By adding to the previous surplus the current premium flow and deducting the claims made during the period, the process gives the value of the capital that is available to the insurer at each point in time. Each period is tracked so that the surplus never gets below zero because if it does, it provides an indication of ruin, that is, the company is in a position of negative cash flow. However, the first time that ruin occurs is im-portant and the company must ensure this does not happen because it can leave the company <b>inoperable.</b> This <b>time</b> to ruin is so much a function of the initial capital and the pricing structure of the insurer’s book of business, although how claims evolve over time can also directly impact the level of surplus. Claims generally are out of the company’s control, but it can manage its surplus so that it can predictably estimate the level of claims that will emerge over time. One distinguishing feature of a typi-cal mathematical structure of the surplus process is the assumption that individual claims do arise independently. We know that this assumption of independence is no longer realistic and reasonable because individual risks, are usually homogeneous and share common characteristics that claims from one can induce claims of another. In other words, the risks do not exhibit independence. In this paper, we investigate the effects of dependent claims on the probability of ruin and the time-to-ruin, given ruin occurs. However, unlike the case of independence where there may be a more tractable solution, it is not straightforward to get closed form solutions to the proba-bility of ruin. Instead, we apply simulation procedures to provide us insight into the statistical distribution of the time to ruin when claims are dependent. We find that in the presence of dependent claims, the time to ruin occurs faster. ...|$|R
40|$|Summary The {{epidermal}} {{growth factor}} receptor is homologous to the oncogene erb-,B and is the receptor for a class of tumour growth factors (TGF-ca). The clinical correlations with its expression were studied in 77 nonsmall cell lung cancers (NSCLC). They were stained for {{epidermal growth factor}} receptor (EGFr) {{by means of an}} indirect immunoperoxidase technique using a monoclonal antibody against the receptor. Normal lung tissue and normal bronchus were stained for comparison. Cancer tissue showed significantly increased staining compared to normal lung (P < 0. 05). Staining for EGFr in 40 squamous carcinomas was significantly stronger than in 37 specimens of other types of NSCLC (P< 0. 05), and staining in stage three NSCLC was stronger than in stage 1 and 2 (P< 0. 05). These results suggest that the presence of a high intensity of staining for EGF receptor is associated with spread of human non-small cell lung cancer and this receptor may be a suitable target for therapy. Non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) comprises predominantly squamous, adenocarcinomas and large cell undifferentiated tumours. Only 5 % of such tumours are curable by surgery (Crofton & Douglas, 1981), and up to 60 % are <b>inoperable</b> at the <b>time</b> of diagnosis (Crofton & Douglas...|$|R

We have reported the usefulness of endobronchial ultrasound-guided transbronchial needle aspiration (EBUS-TBNA) for the lymph node staging of lung cancer.

40|$|Hepatocellular {{carcinoma}} (HCC) occurs commonly {{and with}} increasing frequency in developing countries, where it also carries an especially grave prognosis. The major risk factor for HCC in these regions is chronic hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection, although dietary exposure to aflatoxin B 1 also plays an important etiological role. Prevention of HCC in developing regions is unlikely in the foreseeable future. Although an effective vaccine against HBV is available, the percentage of babies born in developing countries that receive the full course of immunization remains low. Moreover, the usually long interval between infection with HBV {{and the development of}} HCC means that 30 to 50 years will elapse before the full effect of the vaccine will be realized. Practical measures to prevent aflatoxin B 1 exposure are not in place. Serum &#x 3 B 1;-fetoprotein levels are a useful pointer to the diagnosis of HCC in low-income countries, but definitive diagnosis is hampered both by the lack of the sophisticated imaging equipment now available in developed countries and by obstacles to obtaining histological proof.

40|$|Background: 50 % of esophageal cancers are <b>inoperable</b> at the <b>time</b> of diagnosis, {{and around}} 15 % involve the {{cervical}} esophagus. The hypopharynx is often involved by these malignancies as well. Palliation of cervical esophageal malignancies through stent insertion is considered limited due to technical challenges, poor patient tolerance and high complication rate. The {{aim of this}} study is to review our experience with stent insertion in the cervical segment of the esophagus and to evaluate outcome differences between stent insertions involving or sparing the hypopharynx. Methods: We retrospectively reviewed data on 69 consecutive patients that underwent stent insertion for malignant strictures in the cervical esophagus at our Department. Patients were divided according to involvement or sparing of the lower hypopharynx. Dysphagia severity was measured with the Mellow-Pinkas scale before the procedure and on monthly follow-ups. Any complication and its management were recorded. The main outcome parameters were as follows: dysphagia improvement, rate of successful dysphagia palliation (i. e., a reduction of the score to 0 or 1 after stent insertion) and complication rate. Multivariable analysis was carried out to assess the influence of patient- and procedure-related factors on the outcome of the procedure. Results: Stent insertion was achieved in 100 % patients. At 4  weeks, dysphagia score improved from a median of 3 - 0 (p < 0. 001), and a successful palliation was achieved in 76. 8 % patients. The 30 -day mortality rate was 14. 5 %. Successful palliation throughout the follow-up was achieved in 72. 9 % of the surviving patients. Complications occurred in 31. 9 % patients. Dilation before stent insertion was associated with a less efficient short-term dysphagia palliation (OR 6. 77, 95 % CI 1. 46 - 31. 29, p = 0. 02). Conclusions: Stent insertion is a safe and effective palliative treatment for malignant cervical esophageal strictures. Results are consistent even in patients with hypopharyngeal lesions.

The study aims to give a complete overview of the surgical treatment of gastric cancer in the First Service of General Surgery UHC “Mother Theresa” in Tirana, Albania. Methods: Our study presents extensive evidence of 624 patients, operated in the First Service of General Surgery UHC “Mother Theresa” in Tirana, Albania with the diagnosis of gastric cancer in the last eleven years. The study analyses demographic, clinic, operative and pathologic data of the patients obtained from clinical, operative and pathologic records. Results: M : F ratio was 2 : 1. The average age of all patients was 59. 5 +/- 11. 6 (18 – 90) years: in the age-group 51 – 70 years were 61. 2 % of all patients. The patients were divided in three groups according to the localization of the tumor: gastric cardia and fundus tumors were found in 105 (17 %) patients, gastric corpus tumors were found in 279 (44. 7 %) patients and gastric antrum and pylorus tumors were found in 240 (38. 3 %) patients. The UICC/AJCC (TNM) classification was as follows: stage 1 were 49 (8 %) patients; stage 2 were 174 (28 %) patients; stage 3 were 213 (34 %) patients and stage 4 were 188 (30 %) patients. Overall operability index was 70 %; 188 (30 %) patients resulted <b>inoperable</b> at the <b>time</b> of intervention. In gastric cardia and fundus tumors, the most performed operation was total gastrectomy (70. 5 % of operable patients). In gastric corpus tumors, the most performed operation was distal gastrectomy (54 %), followed by total gastrectomy (42 % of operable patients). In gastric antrum and pylorus tumors, all operable patients (100 %) were treated with distal gastrectomy. In the histopatologic aspect, most of the tumors were adenocarcinoma (74. 7 %). Overall postoperative morbidity and mortality were respectively 26. 8 % and 1. 8 %.
