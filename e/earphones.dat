5|$|The iPhone 5S was {{the first}} Apple device to ship with iOS 7, which {{introduced}} a revamped visual appearance and other new features. Designed by Jonathan Ive, iOS 7 departed from skeuomorphic elements used by previous versions of iOS {{in favor of a}} flat, colorful design. Among new software features introduced to the iPhone 5S were AirDrop, an ad-hoc Wi-Fi sharing platform; Control Center, a control panel containing a number of commonly used functions; and iTunes Radio, an internet radio service. <b>Earphones</b> known as EarPods were included with the 5S, and Apple released accessories including a case and a dock.|$|E
5|$|The iPhone 4S {{can play}} music, movies, {{television}} shows, ebooks, audiobooks, and podcasts and can sort its media library by songs, artists, albums, videos, playlists, genres, composers, podcasts, audiobooks, and compilations. Options are always presented alphabetically, except in playlists, which retain their order from iTunes. The iPhone 4S uses a large font that allows users {{plenty of room}} to touch their selection. Users can rotate their device horizontally to landscape mode to access Cover Flow. Like on iTunes, this feature shows the different album covers in a scroll-through photo library. Scrolling is achieved by swiping a finger across the screen. Alternatively, headset controls can be used to pause, play, skip, and repeat tracks. On the 4S, the volume can be changed with the included Apple <b>Earphones,</b> and the Voice Control feature can be used to identify a track, play songs in a playlist or by a specific artist, or create a Genius playlist.|$|E

40|$|Includes bibliographical {{references}} (pages [45]- 48) Hearing thresholds {{were assessed}} using a standard supra-aural <b>earphone</b> (SSE) and a muffed insert <b>earphone</b> (MIE) {{in an environment}} of specially shaped noise. Eleven women with normal hearing sensitivity were the subjects of this project and were evaluated under four test conditions: supra-aural <b>earphone</b> in quiet, supraaural <b>earphone</b> in noise, muffed insert <b>earphone</b> in quiet, muffed insert <b>earphone</b> in noise. Results of an analysis of variance revealed significantly higher thresholds with the SSE compared to the MIE in the noise test condition. Essentially no threshold shift occurred with the muffed insert <b>earphone</b> in any condition. It was concluded that the MIE is more appropriate than the SSE for testing hearing sensitivity in the presence of moderate amounts of ambient noise. Hearing levels can be accurately assessed using the MIE system in levels of noise that are equal to OSHA maximum permissible levels. Subjective comfort ratings of each <b>earphone</b> revealed no difference between the two systems. M. A. (Master of Arts...|$|R

40|$|Although {{previous}} studies have reported that frequent <b>earphone</b> use and lead exposure are risk factors for hearing loss, most of these studies were limited to small populations or animal experiments. Several studies that presented the joint effect of combined exposure of noise and heavy metal on hearing loss were also mainly conducted on occupational workers exposed to high concentration. We investigated both the individual and joint effects of <b>earphone</b> use and environmental lead exposure on hearing loss in the Korean general population. We analyzed data from 7, 596 Koreans provided by the Korea National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (KNHANES) during the period 2010 - 2013. The pure-tone average (PTA) of hearing thresholds at 2, 3, and 4 kHz frequencies was computed, and hearing loss {{was defined as a}} PTA ≥ 25 dB in one or both ears. A dose-response relationship in hearing loss with <b>earphone</b> use time and blood lead level is observed after adjustment for confounding factors. With a 1 -hour increase in <b>earphone</b> use time and 1 μg/dL increase in blood lead concentration, the odds of hearing loss increased by 1. 19 and 1. 43 times, respectively. For hearing loss, the additive and multiplicative effect of <b>earphone</b> use and blood lead level were not statistically significant. <b>Earphone</b> use and environmental lead exposure have an individual effect on hearing loss in the general population. However, the estimated joint effect of <b>earphone</b> use and lead exposure was not statistically significant...|$|R

25|$|The {{usual way}} of {{limiting}} sound volume on devices driving headphones is by limiting output power. This has the additional undesirable effect of being dependent of {{the efficiency of}} the headphones; a device producing the maximum allowed power may not produce adequate volume when paired with low-efficiency, high-impedance equipment, while the same amount of power can reach dangerous levels with very efficient <b>earphones.</b>|$|E

25|$|Shure Incorporated is an American audio {{products}} corporation. It {{was founded}} by Sidney N. Shure in Chicago, Illinois in 1925 as a supplier of radio parts kits. The company became a consumer and professional audio-electronics manufacturer of microphones, wireless microphone systems, phonograph cartridges, discussion systems, mixers, and digital signal processing. The company also manufactures listening products, including headphones, high-end <b>earphones,</b> and personal monitor systems.|$|E
25|$|Many {{accessories}} {{have been}} made for the iPod line. A large number are made by third party companies, although many, such as the iPod Hi-Fi, are made by Apple. Some accessories add extra features that other music players have, such as sound recorders, FM radio tuners, wired remote controls, and audio/visual cables for TV connections. Other accessories offer unique features like the Nike+iPod pedometer and the iPod Camera Connector. Other notable accessories include external speakers, wireless remote controls, protective case, screen films, and wireless <b>earphones.</b> Among the first accessory manufacturers were Griffin Technology, Belkin, JBL, Bose, Monster Cable, and SendStation.|$|E

25|$|The most {{complete}} expression to date of his multisensory philosophy, however, {{is probably the}} dish ‘Sound of the Sea’, which first appeared on the Fat Duck menu in 2007. In this, ingredients with a distinctly oceanic character and flavour – dried kelp, hijiki seaweed, baby eels, razor clams, cockles, mussels, sea urchins – are fashioned into a course that has {{the appearance of the}} shore’s edge, complete with sea ‘spume’ and edible sand. It is served on a glass-topped box containing real sand, and accompanied by headphones relaying the sounds of seagulls and the sea by means of a small iPod (placed in a conch shell) and <b>earphones.</b> The idea, according to Blumenthal, was one ‘of creating a world, of transporting the diner – through sound, through food, through an integrated appeal to the senses – to another place’.|$|E
25|$|One issue {{treated as}} {{secondary}} at the inquiry was the {{presence in the}} flight deck observer's seat of Captain Collins. The Lane report recommended greater caution in allowing off-duty flight crew members to occupy flight deck seats, and aired speculation that Collins might have been distracting his colleagues. The report noted that Collins' body {{was found to be}} holding a can of aerosol air freshener in its right hand. Sources close to the events of the time suggest that Collins played an altogether more positive role by attempting to lower the leading-edge devices in the final seconds of the flight; Eric Pritchard, a Trident captain who happened to be the first airman at the accident site, recalled that a fireman had stated that Collins was lying across the centre pedestal and noted himself that his <b>earphones</b> had fallen into the right-hand-side footwell of the flight deck, diagonally across from the observer's seat, as might be expected if he had attempted to intervene as a last resort.|$|E
25|$|Test: Finally, infants {{are tested}} in the lab using the Headturn-preference procedure, a {{behavioral}} data-collection tool that measures preferences for one kind of auditory stimulus over another. The Headturn-preference procedure maintains that an infant will turn its head towards a stimulus it prefers. This procedure is conducted in a testing booth, with the infant sitting on the lap {{of his or her}} mother. A light is located {{on either side of the}} infant. The trial begins when the infant is looking straight ahead. Mother and experimenter are required to wear tight-fitting <b>earphones</b> which deliver masking music for the duration of the entire procedure. This is done to guarantee that neither mother, nor experimenter bias the infant's response. During each trial, one sidelight flashes, urging the infant to look at it. Once the infant turns his or her head and looks at the light, the sound stimulus is played. The stimulus continues to play until the sound finishes or the infant looks away. When the infant turns away from the source for at least two seconds, sound and light turn off and the trial ends. A new trial begins when the infant looks at the center panel again.|$|E
