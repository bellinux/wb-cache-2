5|$|The plot follows four characters, Karen, Rick, Luke, and Rachel, as {{they arrive}} in the lounge of an airport bar, as they {{interact}} with one another, and as they cope with chaos that erupts as cataclysmic events occur. The story addresses their motivations and perceptions, {{as well as their}} thoughts on certain themes. There are several minor characters and a fifth main character, Player One, who retells the events that the four main characters experience but from the perspective of an outside observer, like someone <b>exploring</b> <b>a</b> video game environment.|$|E
5|$|According to the author, {{he began}} {{writing the book}} {{in the same way}} he began most of his books: by <b>exploring</b> <b>a</b> {{question}} that was unresolved for him. In this case, the question became the book's title. In What's So Amazing About Grace?, Yancey answers this question by writing that God gives grace to people unconditionally, without their need to earn it. His book includes Bible stories, anecdotes from Yancey's life and accounts of historical events. Similar to his other works, What's So Amazing About Grace? has a self-deprecating tone. It describes Yancey's upbringing in a judgmental church, a theme Yancey previously explored in The Jesus I Never Knew and later returned to in Reaching for the Invisible God and Soul Survivor.|$|E

5|$|After <b>exploring</b> <b>a</b> {{number of}} the game's locations, the {{apprentice}} gains access to a guarded tunnel and is astonished to discover what lies {{on the other side}}. Whereas the valley where Drypeak is located is a dustbowl devoid of vegetation, the lands {{on the other side of}} the tunnel are lush and green, meaning highly illegal shaping is taking place in secret. Serviles, the Shapers' slaves created from life essence, show abnormal intelligence and self-awareness. While still reeling from the revelation of what lies beyond Drypeak, the Shaper apprentice discovers that Shanti has disappeared during one of her escapes from her armed escorts, her necklace lay broken on the grass outside the tunnel. At this point, approximately a quarter of the way through the game, the player's choices expand considerably.|$|E
5|$|Chatwin's {{case was}} unusual {{as he had}} a fungal infection, Penicillium marneffei, {{which at the time}} had rarely been seen and only in South Asia. It is now known as an AIDS-defining illness, but in 1986 little was known about HIV and AIDS. Doctors were not certain if all cases of HIV {{developed}} into AIDS. The rare fungus gave Chatwin hope that he might be different and served as the basis of what he told most people about his illness. He gave various reasons for how he became infected with the fungus—ranging from eating a 1,000-year-old egg to <b>exploring</b> <b>a</b> bat cave in Indonesia. He never publicly disclosed that he was HIV-positive because of the stigma at the time. He wanted to protect his parents, who were unaware of his homosexual affairs.|$|E
5|$|Fossils now {{attributed}} to Dimetrodon were first studied by American paleontologist Edward Drinker Cope in the 1870s. Cope had obtained the fossils {{along with those}} of many other Permian tetrapods (four-limbed vertebrates) from several collectors who had been <b>exploring</b> <b>a</b> group of rocks in Texas called the Red Beds. Among these collectors were Swiss naturalist Jacob Boll, Texas geologist W. F. Cummins, and amateur paleontologist Charles Hazelius Sternberg. Most of Cope's specimens went to the American Museum of Natural History or to the University of Chicago's Walker Museum (most of the Walker fossil collection is now housed in the Field Museum of Natural History).|$|E

While <b>exploring</b> <b>a</b> seemingly abandoned house, Ethan finds Mia imprisoned in the basement. During their escape, Mia suddenly becomes extremely violent and attacks Ethan, forcing him to kill her. After receiving a call from a woman named Zoe offering assistance, Ethan is attacked by a revived Mia, who cuts his left hand off. Jack Baker, the patriarch of the Baker family, captures Ethan; he is dragged to another house and Zoe staples his hand back on. Ethan is held captive by Jack, his wife Marguerite, their son Lucas, and a catatonic, wheelchair-bound elderly woman. After escaping his restraints, he is repeatedly attacked by Jack, who is infected with powerful regenerative abilities.|$|E
5|$|The episode {{opens with}} the Doctor and Donna <b>exploring</b> <b>a</b> {{marketplace}} on the Asian styled planet Shan Shen. Donna is {{approached by a}} fortune teller who convinces her to get a free reading. The fortune teller helps Donna recall the event that led to her meeting the Doctor. Donna remembers when she was driving along with her mother, Sylvia, through London {{to get a new}} job; at an intersection, Donna wanted to turn left to get to the security firm H.C. Clements for a well-paid temp position, while Sylvia wanted her to turn right as to take a job as a PA at a friend's business. Donna ultimately turned left. The fortune teller gives Donna the chance to choose again and encourages her to turn right this time. As she makes this new choice, a large beetle attaches itself to her back.|$|E
5|$|The theory {{describes}} {{five major}} biological processes, namely metabolism, temperature regulation, information processing, embryogenesis, and inheritance. Each was defined in some detail, {{in some cases}} sufficient to enable modern biologists to create mathematical models of the mechanisms described. Aristotle's method, too, resembled the style of science used by modern biologists when <b>exploring</b> <b>a</b> new area, with systematic data collection, discovery of patterns, and inference of possible causal explanations from these. He did not perform experiments in the modern sense, but made observations of living animals and carried out dissections. He names some 500 species of bird, mammal, and fish; and he distinguishes dozens of insects and other invertebrates. He describes the internal anatomy of over a hundred animals, and dissected around 35 of these.|$|E

5|$|The {{world of}} Human Revolution was {{designed}} to parallel the Greek myth of Icarus; in the myth, Icarus was flying with artificial wings, but flew {{too close to the}} sun and destroyed his wings, causing his fatal fall. The world's new reliance on and experimentation with augmentation technology mirrored the myth, with the game's narrative taking place at a crucial tipping point, the outcome of which would be decided by the player. The general focus on technology and its effect on human society also tied into the game's visual themes. The development team used multiple sources as references while creating the world and scenario. The Children of Men was used to capture the setting and resultant chaotic drama, Bioshock gave them a reference for the handling of mature themes, while the television series Rome showed how powerful people's ambitions shaped history. The sense of tension between augmented and normal humans was inspired by the similar tension between humans and mutants in the X-Men franchise. For the conspiracy elements of the plot, the team used novels Deception Point, The Firm, and Frank Herbert's Dune saga as inspiration. The desired quality of cutscenes and dialogue were directly inspired by the Grand Theft Auto and Mass Effect franchises. DeMarle termed the final product as a study in contrasts, as the implementation of augmentation technology had created a new form of divided social class system when other social barriers had fallen. Other themes used earlier in Deus Ex, such as <b>exploring</b> <b>a</b> culture of fear; the workings of a surveillance state; and the exploitation created by economic inequality, were paralleled in Human Revolution. To add more depth to the world and narrative, the team created supplementary written material such as emails, e-books, and cell phone-like devices called pocket secretaries.|$|E
5|$|Walt Disney Productions {{first began}} <b>exploring</b> <b>a</b> {{possible}} live action/animation biography film of author and poet Hans Christian Andersen sometime in late 1937 before the December premiere of its film Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs, the first feature-length hand-drawn animated film ever made. In March 1940, Walt Disney suggested a co-production to film producer Samuel Goldwyn, where Goldwyn's studio would shoot the live-action sequences of Andersen's life and Disney's studio would animate Andersen's fairy tales. The animated sequences {{would be based}} on some of Andersen's best known works, such as The Little Mermaid, The Little Match Girl, The Steadfast Tin Soldier, The Snow Queen, Thumbelina, The Ugly Duckling, The Red Shoes, and The Emperor's New Clothes. However, the studio encountered difficulty with The Snow Queen, as it could not find a way to adapt and relate the Snow Queen character to modern audiences. Even {{as far back as the}} 1930s and 1940s, it was clear that the source material contained great cinematic possibilities, but the Snow Queen character proved to be too problematic. After the United States entered World War II, the studio began to focus on making wartime propaganda, which caused development on the Disney–Goldwyn project to grind to a halt in 1942. Goldwyn went on to produce his own live-action film version in 1952, entitled Hans Christian Andersen, with Danny Kaye as Andersen, Charles Vidor directing, Moss Hart writing, and Frank Loesser penning the songs. All of Andersen's fairy tales were, instead, told in song and ballet in live-action, like the rest of the film. It went on to receive six Academy Award nominations the following year. Back at Disney, The Snow Queen, along with other Andersen fairy tales (including The Little Mermaid), were shelved.|$|E
