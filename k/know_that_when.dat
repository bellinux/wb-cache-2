So wearing make-up, smelling delicious and having suckable, kissable, edible things between your limbs is something I find strengthening because I <b>know</b> <b>that</b> <b>when</b> I pick the right guy, I can let him have it. Some women feel oppressed by make-up and clothing, and here’s to them, they {{have every right to}} feel that way as well.|$|E
500|$|In April 2007 Danough {{left the}} band. [...] "We {{felt that we}} had grown apart {{and it was time}} for both parties to move on", the band wrote in a statement. After his {{departure}} he wrote on his MySpace blog: [...] "..Just <b>know</b> <b>that</b> <b>when</b> this all comes out don't think you've seen the last of Scott. I'm on to the next chapter very soon and I'm excited to see what the future brings." [...] After Danough's departure he was quickly replaced by Jona Weinhofen of Australian band I Killed The Prom Queen – one of several factors that led that band to split up.|$|E
500|$|Barrowman {{spent his}} senior year shovelling coal for an Illinois power company. His father had {{arranged}} the job (and similar jobs for his brother and sister) to give Barrowman the experience of manual labour. His father told him: [...] "If {{you want to do}} manual labour {{for the rest of your}} life you'll <b>know</b> <b>that</b> <b>when</b> you do it; it's a choice. But if you don't like it, you'll understand the importance of educating yourself and – if you decide what you want to do – being good at your craft or your skill." [...] Barrowman worked for the power company for the entire summer, but did not like the job. Eventually, he convinced the company to move him to work in the storeroom.|$|E

500|$|Douglas soon dragged Wilde {{into the}} Victorian {{underground}} of gay prostitution and Wilde {{was introduced to}} a series of young working-class male prostitutes from 1892 onwards by Alfred Taylor. These infrequent rendezvous usually took the same form: Wilde would meet the boy, offer him gifts, dine him privately and then take him to a hotel room. Unlike Wilde's idealised, pederastic relations with Ross, John Gray, and Douglas, all of whom remained part of his aesthetic circle, these consorts were uneducated and knew nothing of literature. Soon his public and private lives had become sharply divided; in De Profundis he wrote to Douglas that [...] "It was like feasting with panthers; the danger was half the excitement... I did not <b>know</b> <b>that</b> <b>when</b> they were to strike at me it was to be at another's piping and at another's pay." ...|$|E
500|$|Jay Carr of The Boston Globe wrote, [...] "Boys Don't Cry {{not only}} revisits the crime, but convinces us we're being taken inside it". Stephanie Zacharek of Salon gave a {{positive}} review, singling out the directing and acting. She wrote, [...] "Peirce ... covers an {{extraordinary amount of}} territory, not just in terms of dealing with Brandon’s sexual-identity and self-fulfillment issues, but also in trying to understand the lives of those around him". Zacharek described Swank's performance as [...] "a continual revelation" [...] and Sevigny's performance as [...] "transformative". She said, [...] "When Brandon dies, [...] "Boys Don’t Cry" [...] reaches an emotional intensity that’s almost operatic. The saddest thing, though, is seeing Sevigny’s Lana crumpled over his corpse—the way she plays it, you <b>know</b> <b>that</b> <b>when</b> Brandon went, he took a part of her with him, too". David Edelstein of Slate was also very positive towards the film, calling it [...] "a meditation on the irrelevance of gender." [...] He went on to praise Swank, Sevigny, and Sarsgaard in their roles, especially Sevigny, writing that she [...] "keeps the movie tantalizing".|$|E
500|$|In an {{interview}} on The John and Ken Show on KFI, Headley {{was asked if he}} experienced retaliation from Scientology for speaking critically about the organization. He said that he had been issued a declaration that he was to be considered a [...] "Suppressive Person" [...] by members of the organization, and explained, [...] "That's basically the thing that goes out to anyone and everyone who is in Scientology, saying, 'This person is a Suppressive Person, and you can no longer speak to him ever again.' If you are in Scientology, and you speak to somebody who is a Suppressive Person, you yourself can be declared a Suppressive Person." [...] Headley said when he left Scientology the organization gave him a [...] "freeloader statement", a bill for US$62,000, for courses he had received in Scientology. [...] "It's actually illegal, because they are basically charging me for on-the-job training – in California you can't charge somebody for on-the-job training. It's of no real value, but you don't <b>know</b> <b>that,</b> <b>when</b> you're in Scientology. You think, 'Are they going to garnish my wages, are they going to sue me?' You don't know," [...] said Headley.|$|E

500|$|House {{is often}} filmed using the [...] "walk and talk" [...] filming technique, popularized on {{television}} by series such as St. Elsewhere, ER, Sports Night, and The West Wing. The technique {{involves the use}} of tracking shots, showing two or more characters walking between locations while talking. Executive producer Katie Jacobs said that the show frequently uses the technique because [...] "when you put a scene on the move, it's a... way of creating an urgency and an intensity". She noted the significance of [...] "the fact that Hugh Laurie spans 6'2" [...] and is taller than everybody else because it certainly makes those walk-and-talks pop". Nancy Franklin of The New Yorker described the show's [...] "cool, Fantastic Voyage–like special effects of patients' innards. I'll bet you didn't <b>know</b> <b>that</b> <b>when</b> your kidneys shut down they sound like bubble wrap popping." [...] "Cameras and special effects travel not only down the throat" [...] of one patient, another critic observed, [...] "but up her nose and inside her brain and leg". Instead of relying primarily on computer-generated imagery, the interior body shots tend to involve miniature effects and motion control photography. Many of the sets are dressed with a variety of unscripted props that allow Laurie to physically improvise, revealing aspects of his character and the story.|$|E
500|$|Peter Buck's {{style of}} playing guitar has {{been singled out}} {{by many as the}} most {{distinctive}} aspect of R.E.M.'s music. During the 1980s, Buck's [...] "economical, arpeggiated, poetic" [...] style reminded British music journalists of 1960s American folk rock band The Byrds. Buck has stated [...] " [...] Roger McGuinn was a big influence on me as a guitar player", but said it was Byrds-influenced bands, including Big Star and The Soft Boys, that inspired him more. Comparisons were also made with the guitar playing of Johnny Marr of alternative rock contemporaries The Smiths. While Buck professed being a fan of the group, he admitted he initially criticized the band simply because he was tired of fans asking him if he was influenced by Marr, whose band had in fact made their debut after R.E.M. Buck generally eschews guitar solos; he explained in 2002, [...] "I <b>know</b> <b>that</b> <b>when</b> guitarists rip into this hot solo, people go nuts, but I don't write songs that suit that, and I am not interested in that. I can do it if I have to, but I don't like it." [...] Mike Mills' melodic approach to bass playing is inspired by Paul McCartney of The Beatles and Chris Squire of Yes; Mills has said, [...] "I always played a melodic bass, like a piano bass in some ways [...] [...] [...] I never wanted to play the traditional locked into the kick drum, root note bass work." [...] Mills has more musical training than his bandmates, which he has said [...] "made it easier to turn abstract musical ideas into reality." ...|$|E

2500|$|President Richard Nixon did not {{publicly}} {{comment about the}} decision.

[...] However, Nixon was also concerned that greater access to abortions would foster [...] "permissiveness," [...] and said that [...] "it breaks the family." ...|$|E

2500|$|In {{the modern}} {{understanding}} of quantum mechanics, Schrödinger's equation may be derived as follows. If the wave-function {{at time t}} is given by , then by the linearity of quantum mechanics the wave-function at time t' must be given by , where [...] is a linear operator. Since time-evolution must preserve the norm of the wave-function, it follows that [...] must {{be a member of}} the unitary group of operators acting on wave-functions. We also <b>know</b> <b>that</b> <b>when</b> , we must have [...] Therefore, expanding the operator [...] for t' close to t, we can write [...] where H is a Hermitian operator.

2500|$|To {{understand}} the concept better, consider the case sketched in the figure. We <b>know</b> <b>that</b> <b>when</b> an object moves in a flow, it causes pressure disturbances (which travel {{at the speed of}} sound, also known as Mach waves). The figure shows an object moving from point A to B along the line AB at supersonic speeds (...) [...] By the time the object reaches point B, the pressure disturbances from point A have travelled a distance c·t and are now at circumference of the circle (with centre at point A). There are infinite such circles with their centre on the line AB, each representing the location of the disturbances due to the motion of the object. The lines propagating outwards from point B and tangent to all these circles are known as Mach lines.|$|E
2500|$|A {{number of}} former Károlyi gymnasts, both {{supporters}} and detractors, have acknowledged {{that some of}} the allegations about Károlyi were true, but have also claimed that the ends — medals — justified the means. In Joan Ryan's Little Girls in Pretty Boxes, 1992 Olympian Betty Okino said: [...] "What Béla did worked. He motivated me by getting me mad." [...] Some have claimed that Károlyi stopped treating gymnasts harshly when parents directly requested that he do so. In a column she wrote rebutting many of the claims of Little Girls in Pretty Boxes, Okino wrote: [...] "Károlyi structured his training in a way that built your physical and mental strength to such a remarkable level that even he couldn't tear you down. Béla wanted to <b>know</b> <b>that</b> <b>when</b> push came to shove, his athletes could handle any situation thrown at them." ...|$|E
