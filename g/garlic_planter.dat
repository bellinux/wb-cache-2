40|$|The main {{concept of}} design and {{development}} of <b>garlic</b> <b>planter</b> is fabrication the drilling planter and its metering device is simple in their structure and easy to manufacture. This study followed research after the 3 types of <b>garlic</b> <b>planter</b> was fabricated in 2001 which included; 1) inclined metering plate <b>garlic</b> <b>planter</b> 2) vertical metering plate <b>garlic</b> <b>planter</b> and 3) spring plate <b>garlic</b> <b>planter.</b> In this study, 2 model were constructed which included; 1) the vertical metering plate with triangular grooves and 2) the bucket type <b>garlic</b> <b>planter.</b> The uniformity of metering system test for the 2 models, the bucket type <b>garlic</b> <b>planter</b> presented the most impressive results. The percentage of broken was very low, about 0. 23 %. The new prototype <b>garlic</b> <b>planter</b> had 12 rows and was attached to 5 HP power tiller. The <b>garlic</b> <b>planter</b> was tested under actual field conditions at Maetang district, Chiengmai province. The result indicated that the optimum width of <b>garlic</b> <b>planter</b> was 0. 8 meter or 8 rows. The suitable soil condition was dry soil. Farmer should apply water after planting. The maximum forward speed was 2. 63 km/hr and wheel skid was high about 23. 32 %. The average depth and width of planting was 2. 62 cm. and 4. 66 cm. Time for turning at head land was 37 seconds. The field capacity was 0. 31 ha/hr and there were three operators. Hence, the capacity of planter was 0. 83 ha. /man/day...|$|E
