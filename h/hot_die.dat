40|$|This paper {{describes}} {{the effect of}} renitriding for <b>hot</b> work <b>die</b> steel. We noticed a decrease of compressive residual stress on the nitrided die surface during thermal fatigue process. X-ray stress measurement was used to detect the decomposition of nitride layer on <b>hot</b> work <b>die</b> steel (H 13). As a result, compressive residual stress decreased gradually during the thermal fatigue test, almost restoring to the pre-test level by renitriding. The number of cracks decreased with the frequency of test by surface removal effect of shot peening while renitriding. Comparing the renitrided specimen with non renitrided specimen (single nitride), the number of cracks had decreased. On the surface of <b>hot</b> work <b>die,</b> such as die-casting die, heat cycles are applied during the operation. Then, the cracks occurred due to thermal stresses caused by thermal cycles. To extend die-casting die life, nitriding is often applied to the die surface 1). Even with nitriding, the nitride layer is damaged by heat during the die-casting operation. Thus, i...|$|R
