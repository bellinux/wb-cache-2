500|$|In {{the same}} interview, Gates said: [...] "I agree {{with people like}} Richard Dawkins that mankind felt the need for {{creation}} myths. Before we really began to understand disease and the weather and things like that, we sought false explanations for them. Now science has filled {{in some of the}} realm– not all– that religion used to fill. But the mystery and the beauty of the world is overwhelmingly amazing, and there's no scientific explanation of how it came about. To say that it was generated by random numbers, that does seem, you know, sort of an uncharitable view [...] <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>it</b> <b>makes</b> sense to believe in God, but exactly what decision in your life you make differently because of it, I don't know." ...|$|E
500|$|Bruckheimer {{said the}} {{decision}} to film in 3D was made due to its being [...] "immersive filmmaking; <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>it</b> <b>makes</b> you part of the actual filming because you're part of the screen." [...] Bruckheimer described it as the first major [...] "exterior movie" [...] to be shot in 3D, as Avatar was mostly done in sound stages. At first Marshall was not much interested in 3D, but the director eventually considered it a film that could benefit from the format. [...] "You are on an adventure and with the 3D experience you are inside that adventure." [...] While the original plan was to add 3D effects during post-production, {{the decision was made}} to shoot digitally with 3D cameras. Only one sequence was shot conventionally and needed a 3D conversion. The cameras were improved versions of the ones James Cameron developed for Avatar, which were made more compact for extra mobility. This meant the cameras could be brought into locations such as the Hawaiian jungle.|$|E
500|$|Astrophysicist Adam Frank {{served as}} a {{scientific}} consultant on the film, having already known Derrickson and been a Marvel fan since childhood. Frank advised on [...] "the human experience of space and time", helping Marvel conceive ideas for their cinematic multiverse, and suggesting dialogue for characters based on their beliefs, whether they were materialist, rationalist, reductionist, or [...] "had this enlarged perspective." [...] He noted that modern movie goers may not necessarily understand these complex scientific ideas, but do appear to appreciate [...] "amazing things happen from science. So by grounding your stories enough in science to not so much make them plausible, but to allow that science to open up new possibilities—people are used to that in their lives. So <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>it</b> <b>makes</b> sense to them, and it's exciting to them". This was an aspect of previous MCU films that Frank called a [...] "great thing ... speaking as a scientist", saying that [...] "they build a coherent and consistent universe that respects the scientific process and that uses enough of real science to make things plausible or build off them." ...|$|E

500|$|Case {{said she}} was unconcerned about the storyline because the writers had a plan to explain Sharon's behavior. New head writer Josh Griffith told TV Guide that the {{character}} would reach a [...] "total mental breakdown", which would {{take her to the}} edge and beyond before being rebuilt. Griffith said the breakdown would help her find salvation, with a [...] "stronger, more together, more evolved Sharon" [...] emerging. Sharon breaks down at the main house of the Newman ranch, burning it down while under the influence of alcohol. Griffith stated that the damage Sharon has done to the Newman family is [...] "physical, professional and emotional". After seeing a doctor, Sharon is diagnosed with bipolar disorder and begins treatment; however, she is alarmed after discovering she must take prescribed medication, possibly {{for the rest of her}} life. Case was happy with the outcome of the storyline, as were viewers of the show. In January 2013, she told Soap Opera Uncensored, [...] "When Sharon battled her emotional problems, that also took a lot of work but in a different way. Playing someone who is bipolar is very exhausting but it worked out perfectly and explained all of Sharon’s past behavior. I applaud Josh for making that decision because <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>it</b> <b>makes</b> the most sense considering her history." [...] The actress in addition was pleased that she didn't have to continue justifying Sharon's questionable actions.|$|E
2500|$|At a later {{point in}} the season, Lisa Todorovich of Zap2it chastised Naomi for being [...] "all about herself" [...] while failing to support Liam during a series of troubles. While {{acknowledging}} Naomi's faults, which eventually lead to a break-up with Liam, Krista Navin of MassLive.com stated that [...] "it is totally consistent with her character that she would {{want to try to}} be there for Liam, but just be too into her own drama to really be able to be. Also, <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>it</b> <b>makes</b> sense that someone like Liam would think he would want to be with someone like Naomi, and then be pretty disillusioned by the reality." ...|$|E
2500|$|Dennis Lim of The New York Times {{stressed}} that [...] "there {{is virtually no}} music on the soundtrack of this tense, methodical thriller. Long passages are entirely wordless. In {{some of the most}} gripping sequences what you hear mostly is a suffocating silence." [...] Skip Lievsay, the film's sound editor called this approach [...] "quite a remarkable experiment," [...] and added that [...] "suspense thrillers in Hollywood are traditionally done almost entirely with music. The idea here was to remove the safety net that lets the audience feel like they know what's going to happen. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>it</b> <b>makes</b> the movie much more suspenseful. You're not guided by the score and so you lose that comfort zone." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "It {{would not}} make her much trouble, I know," [...] said Wallace, [...] "if you were only {{considerate}} and careful. As <b>it</b> is <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>it</b> may <b>make</b> her a great deal." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I can't cry," [...] {{she said}} drearily. [...] "I wish I could. I've a dreadful feeling here--" [...] {{she touched her}} slender throat--"and if I could cry <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>it</b> would <b>make</b> <b>it</b> better. But I can't." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Woman," [...] {{replied the}} King, with much kindness, [...] "thou art gentle by sex, and shouldst be pitiful even by thy affliction; {{for our own}} {{calamity}} ought to <b>make</b> us--nay, <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>it</b> doth <b>make</b> us--merciful to others. Thy husband hath only trodden the path appointed to us all." ...|$|R
2500|$|Hansis and Silbermann cited their offscreen {{friendship}} as {{the reason}} for their ease when portraying intimate scenes between Luke and Noah. [...] "It makes them easier. Jake is a good friend. I know he's got my back and {{is not going to make}} me look like an ass onscreen. I hope I return the favor," [...] said Hansis. [...] "I think we work well together and I couldn't have asked for a cooler person to play opposite. Jake is just very down to earth and funny and open to different ideas. It makes every scene very comfortable." [...] Silbermann added, [...] "I think we had become friends before the first kiss... If anything, <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>it</b> <b>makes</b> it more comfortable." ...|$|E
2500|$|The Royal Coachman {{was first}} made by John Haily a {{professional}} fly dresser living in New York City. In writing of other matters, he enclosed this fly {{for us to}} see, saying [...] "A gentleman wanted me to tie up some Coachman {{for him to take}} to the north woods and to make them extra strong, so I have tied them with a little band of silk in the middle to prevent the peacock bodies from fraying out. I have also added a tail of the barred feathers of the wood-duck, and <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>it</b> <b>makes</b> a very handsome fly." [...] A few evenings later, a circle of us were together [...] "disputing the fly in question", one of the party claiming that numbers were [...] "quite as suitable to designate the flies as so many nonsensical names". The others did not agree with him, but he said: [...] "What can you do? Here is a fly intended to be a Coachman; {{but it is not the}} true Coachman; it is quite unlike it and what can you call it?" [...] Mr. L. C. Orvis, brother of Mr. Charles Orvis, who was present said: [...] "Oh that is easy enough; call it the Royal Coachman it is so finely dressed!" [...] And this name in time came to be known and used by all who are familiar with the fly.|$|E

6000|$|A whisper followed, and {{the deeper}} voice returned: [...] "And you drifted as far apart as that! <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>it</b> <b>makes</b> us quits now, doesn't it? Oh, can't we drop this folly {{once and for}} all? Is it worth it, darling?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "She very {{possibly}} wants nothing--but I'm to that beastly degree, you see," [...] his visitor patiently explained, [...] "in the cleft {{stick of}} my fearfully positive mother's wants. Those are her 'terms,' and I don't mind saying that they're most disagreeable to me--I quite hate 'em: there! Only <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>it</b> <b>makes</b> a jolly difference that I wouldn't touch 'em {{with a long}} pole if my personal feeling--in respect to Lady Grace--wasn't so immensely enlisted." ...|$|E
6000|$|When {{they came}} in sight of the brook, George {{saw that there was}} a narrow log across it, in guise of a bridge. He called out to Egbert, who had gone on before him, not to go over the log until he came. But Egbert called back in reply that there was no danger, that he could go across alone, and so went boldly over. George, on {{arriving}} at the brook, and finding that the log was firm and strong, followed Egbert over it. [...] "I told you I could go across it," [...] said Egbert. [...] "Yes," [...] replied George, [...] "and you were right in that. You did cross it. The log is very steady. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>it</b> <b>makes</b> quite a good bridge." ...|$|E

[...] He took a stalk fringed with rich red bloom and laid it across the dark green fruit, which was packed among glossy leaves. [...] "Now, perhaps, you'll see why I bought <b>it.</b> <b>I</b> rather <b>think</b> <b>it</b> <b>makes</b> a dainty offering." ...|$|R

5000|$|The discs are {{organized}} chronologically {{up until the}} first half of disc five. The rest of disc five is unreleased live tracks. Disc six is entirely made up of unreleased tracks, acapella tracks, demos, backing tracks etcetera. Rather than sticking the rarities in where they would have been organized in a chronological fashion, <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>it</b> <b>makes</b> more sense this way and it plays better as well. —Mark Linett ...|$|E
50|$|I {{think what}} the {{exhibition}} centers on {{is the idea of}} photography rather than the more literal approach of a photograph being a physical manifestation or illustration of an idea. As a result, it’s quite a cerebral experience—even if you come from a very classical understanding of photography—to have photographs that you may already know be contextualized by their connections with contemporary works and the curation of real-time media streams. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>it</b> <b>makes</b> the meaning of photography aptly malleable.|$|E
5000|$|The song premiered on Idolator on March 9. Upon {{the release}} of the song Grand has commented “I’ve been looking forward to {{releasing}} ‘Whiskey Crime’ to my fans for a long time. There {{are a lot of things}} about this song I think people will love,” Grand says about the tune. “I wrote the drum part note for note, and <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>it</b> <b>makes</b> for a really unique groove that will catch the listener’s attention, in addition to making actual drummers scratch their heads.” ...|$|E

5000|$|According to the Suburban Chicago News, Plainfield, Illinois {{passed a}} local law {{to keep the}} fines from the smoking ban {{violations}} this month, instead of sharing them with the state. Joan Myers, a village attorney, said that the town only receives fifteen dollars from a one-hundred and fifty dollar fine, and the rest goes towards court costs. According to Jeff Jurgens, an attorney with Ancel-Glick, localizing this law is entering uncharted territory. He then said that his firm represents over 20 Illinois municipalities on the matter. Jurgens went on to say, “In most communities, it’s {{going to be the}} local police department that will incur the expense of enforcing the law.” “So <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>it</b> <b>makes</b> sense that the community keep whatever income it generates.” ...|$|E
