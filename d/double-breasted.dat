5|$|The Confederate Infantry, {{the largest}} Corps of the Army, {{had a large}} variety of uniforms, and the greater amount of records. The initial Confederate Army uniform {{consisted}} of a kepi, <b>double-breasted</b> tunic, trousers, and Jefferson bootees/brogans. The kepi was not specified until the 1862 Regulations, as a sky-blue kepi, reflecting the Infantry Corps, with a dark blue band, and leather visor. The tunic was to be of cadet gray, with two rows of yellow-metal (brass or gold) buttons, 'solid' cuff and collar facings in sky-blue, and lined with a lighter gray fabric. The coat was of the same pattern specified as regulation for the field and company officers, {{as well as for}} the artillery and cavalry enlisted men.|$|E
25|$|Frock coats (in French redingotes) {{were worn}} for {{informal}} day wear, were calf length, {{and might be}} <b>double-breasted.</b> Shoulders were narrower and slightly sloped. Waistcoats or vests were single- or <b>double-breasted,</b> with shawl or notched collars, and might be finished in double points at the lowered waist.|$|E

25|$|Grey {{all-weather}} coat (which is a <b>double-breasted</b> trenchcoat with removable liner) {{is authorized}} for wear with all uniforms during inclement and cold weather (ceremonial units at Marine Barracks, 8th {{have their own}} special Dress-blue trenchcoat with red piping).|$|E
25|$|With a single-breasted suit, it {{is proper}} {{to have the}} buttons unfastened while sitting down to avoid an ugly drape. A good <b>double-breasted</b> suit is usually able to be left buttoned, to avoid the {{difficulty}} of constantly redoing inner buttons when standing up.|$|E
25|$|Lapels {{also have}} a buttonhole, {{intended}} to hold a boutonnière, a decorative flower. These are now only commonly seen at more formal events. Usually <b>double-breasted</b> suits have one hole on each lapel (with a flower just on the left), while single-breasted suits have just one on the left.|$|E
25|$|<b>Double-breasted</b> suit coats {{are almost}} always kept buttoned. When {{there is more than}} one button to fasten (as in a {{traditional}} six-on-two arrangement), only the top one need be fastened; in some configurations, the wearer may elect to fasten only the bottom button, in order to present a longer line (a style popularised by Prince George, Duke of Kent).|$|E
25|$|Waistcoats (called vests in American English) {{were almost}} always worn with suits {{prior to the}} 1940s. Due to {{rationing}} during World War II, their prevalence declined, but their popularity has gone {{in and out of}} fashion from the 1970s onwards. A pocket watch on a chain, one end of which is inserted through a middle buttonhole, is often worn with a waistcoat; otherwise, since World War I when they came to prominence of military necessity, men have worn wristwatches, which may be worn with any suit except the full evening dress (white tie). Although many examples of waistcoats worn with a <b>double-breasted</b> jacket can be found from the 1920s to the 1940s, that would be unusual today (one point of a <b>double-breasted</b> jacket being, it may be supposed, to eliminate the waistcoat). Traditionally, the bottom button of a waistcoat is left undone; like the vents in the rear of a jacket, this helps the body bend when sitting. Some waistcoats can have lapels, others do not.|$|E
25|$|On the East Coast, {{members of}} the hip hop {{community}} looked back to the gangsters of the 1930s and 1940s for inspiration. Mafioso influences, especially and primarily inspired by the 1983 remake version of Scarface, became popular in hip hop. Many rappers set aside gang-inspired clothing in favor of classic gangster fashions such as bowler hats, <b>double-breasted</b> suits, silk shirts, and alligator-skin shoes ("gators").|$|E
25|$|The cut of a {{frock coat}} with a waist seam flatters a man's figure, {{as opposed to}} a sack coat, and such frock coats {{remained}} part of some 20th century military uniforms. They can either be single-breasted as in army uniforms, or <b>double-breasted</b> as in navy uniforms. The British Army currently retains the frock coat for ceremonial wear by senior officers of Lieutenant-General rank and above, by officers of the Household Division, by some bandmasters and by holders of certain Royal appointments.|$|E
25|$|He {{led them}} to the garage workshop, where they found his lathe. Back in the house they found pipes and {{connectors}} suitable for bombs hidden in the pantry, as well as three cheap pocket watches, flashlight batteries, brass terminal knobs, and unmatched wool socks of the type used to transport the bombs. Metesky had answered the door in pajamas; after he was ordered to get dressed for the trip to Waterbury Police Headquarters, he reappeared wearing a <b>double-breasted</b> suit, buttoned.|$|E
25|$|Traditionally this garment is <b>double-breasted</b> with 10 front buttons, has wide lapels, a storm flap and pockets that button-close. The coat is belted at {{the waist}} with a self-belt, as well as having straps around the wrists that also buckle (to keep water from running down the forearm when using {{binoculars}} in the rain). The coat often has shoulder straps that button-close; those were a functional feature in a military context. The traditional color of a trench coat was khaki, although newer versions come in many colors.|$|E
25|$|Semi-dress/walking-out uniform (Ausgangsuniform) – With a few details, the semi-dress uniform was {{the same}} for all ranks and was worn for walking-out {{purposes}} (i.e. off-duty and off-post). It consisted of a single-breasted tunic without belt, a silver-gray shirt with dark-gray tie, the service cap, long trousers, and black low-quarter shoes. Officers also wore the tunic with a white shirt. During periods of warm weather, there was the option of omitting the tunic, and furthermore omitting the tie. A <b>double-breasted</b> jacket was optional for officers and warrant officers.|$|E
25|$|The {{directing}} staff has worn uniforms of differing style to the marching band since its inception. The uniforms {{took on a}} style similar to the U.S. Navy’s <b>double-breasted</b> dress jacket in the 1940s and 1950s. Directing staff had two thin golden stripes running around the circumference of the cuff area of the sleeves, similar to the U.S. Navy’s ranking system stripes. Directing staff also wore two lapel lyre-shaped insignia. These were gold along {{with all of the}} buttons on the uniforms. The directors wore the same hat as the marching band minus the plume.|$|E
25|$|The first {{military}} frock coats {{were issued}} {{late in the}} Napoleonic Wars to French line infantry and Prussian Landwehr troops. Unwilling to soil the expensive tail coats on campaign, the French adopted a loose fitting single-breasted coat with contrasting collar and cuffs. The Germans, having been devastated by years of war, were unable to afford elaborate uniforms like the British line infantry and chose a peaked cap and <b>double-breasted</b> blue coat, again with contrasting collar and cuffs, as these were cheaper to produce for {{the large numbers of}} recruits, smart enough for full dress, and more practical for campaigns.|$|E
25|$|The peaked lapel (American English), peak lapel, double breasted style lapel or pointed lapel (British English), is {{the most}} formal, {{featuring}} on <b>double-breasted</b> jackets, all formal coats such as a tailcoat or morning coat, and also commonly with a tuxedo (both single and double breasted). In the late 1920s and 1930s, the single breasted peaked lapel jacket was considered a very stylish design. The feature was carried into day clothing by the increasing popularity of the peaked dinner jacket. The ability to cut peak lapels properly on a single-breasted suit {{is one of the}} most challenging tailoring tasks, even for very experienced tailors.|$|E
25|$|These {{relations}} {{can be seen}} {{in similar}} foreign terms. The modern word for a dress coat in Italian, French, Romanian and Spanish is frac; in German Frack; and Portuguese fraque, used in the late 18th century to describe a garment very similar to the frock, being a single or <b>double-breasted</b> garment with a diagonally cutaway front {{in the manner of a}} modern morning coat. Even coats with horizontally cut away skirts like a dress coat were referred to as a frock in the late eighteenth and very early 19th century, before being renamed to dress coat.|$|E
25|$|Waistcoats were high-waisted, and {{squared off}} at the bottom, but came in a broad variety of styles. They were often <b>double-breasted,</b> with wide lapels and stand collars. Around 1805 large lapels that {{overlapped}} those of the jacket began {{to fall out of}} fashion, as did the 18th century tradition of wearing the coat unbuttoned, and gradually waistcoats became less visible. Shortly before this time waistcoats were commonly vertically striped but by 1810 plain white waistcoats were increasingly fashionable, as did horizontally striped waistcoats. High-collared waistcoats were fashionable until 1815, then collars were gradually lowered as the shawl collar came into use toward the end of this period.|$|E
25|$|The {{abnormal}} {{enlargement of}} the breast tissues to a volume {{in excess of the}} normal bust-to-body proportions can be caused either by the overdevelopment of the milk glands or of the adipose tissue, or by a combination of both occurrences of hypertrophy. The resultant breast-volume increases can range from the mild (<300 gm) to the moderate (ca. 300–800 gm) to the severe (>800 gm). Macromastia can be manifested either as a unilateral condition or as a bilateral condition (single-breasted enlargement or <b>double-breasted</b> enlargement) that can occur in combination with sagging, breast ptosis that is determined by {{the degree to which the}} nipple has descended below the inframammary fold (IMF).|$|E
25|$|The Governor-General is {{entitled}} to a special court uniform, consisting of a dark navy wool <b>double-breasted</b> coatee with silver oak leaf and fern embroidery on the collar and cuffs trimmed with silver buttons embossed with the Royal Arms and with bullion edged epaulettes on the shoulders, dark navy trousers with a wide band of silver oak-leaf braid down the outside seam, silver sword belt with ceremonial sword, bicorne cocked hat with plume of ostrich feathers, black patent leather Wellington boots with spurs, etc., that is worn on ceremonial occasions. There is also a tropical version made of white tropical wool cut in a typical military fashion worn with a plumed helmet.|$|E
25|$|During the 1840s, men wore tight-fitting, calf length frock {{coats and}} a {{waistcoat}} or vest. The vests were single- or <b>double-breasted,</b> with shawl or notched collars, {{and might be}} finished in double points at the lowered waist. For more formal occasions, a cutaway morning coat was worn with light trousers during the daytime, and a dark tail coat and trousers was worn in the evening. The shirts were made of linen or cotton with low collars, occasionally turned down, and were worn with wide cravats or neck ties. Trousers had fly fronts, and breeches were used for formal functions and when horseback riding. Men wore top hats, with wide brims in sunny weather.|$|E
25|$|As {{depicted}} in the pulps, The Shadow wore a wide-brimmed black hat and a black, crimson-lined cloak with an upturned collar over a standard black business suit. In the 1940s comic books, the later comic book series, and the 1994 film starring Alec Baldwin, he wore either the black hat or a wide-brimmed, black fedora and a crimson scarf just below his nose and across his mouth and chin. Both the cloak and scarf covered either a black <b>double-breasted</b> trench coat or a regular black suit. As seen {{in some of the}} later comics series, The Shadow would also wear his hat and scarf with either a black Inverness coat or Inverness cape.|$|E
25|$|Through {{most of the}} Victorian era until {{towards the}} end, the lapels were cut {{separately}} and sewn on later, apparently because it made the lapel roll more elegantly. The revers {{from the inside of}} the coat wrapped over to the front, creating a small triangle of silk, while the outer half was cut from two strips of the body fabric. This was a feature of <b>double-breasted</b> frock coats used on all such coats, but morning and dress coats, which had previously followed this practice, began to be made with attached lapels (wholecut) around the end of the Edwardian era. Through the Victorian era, a row of decorative button holes was created down the lapel edge, but by Edwardian period these were reduced down to just the one lapel boutonnière button hole.|$|E
25|$|The Lapels: Neapolitan jackets {{are famous}} for their wide lapels, which oftentimes are peaked (“a punta”) for <b>double-breasted</b> jackets, formal jackets, and coats. The “risvolto dentellato” (the “classic” style of lapels – not peaked) are {{notoriously}} wider in Neapolitan jackets: they can be as wide as 4 inches, compared to the 3 inches of a regular lapel width). Just {{as is the case}} for the pockets, the Neapolitan lapel features double stitching running along the sides – a stunning detail that’s peculiar of a Neapolitan creation – although reserved for the less formal pieces. The “scollo a martiello” (literally “hammer neck”) is the opening of the jacket over the shirt, which in Neapolitan tailoring is perfectly parallel to the lapels. The cran is the space that separates the lapel and the neck, and it is usually higher in Neapolitan tailoring to create the illusion of a more slender figure.|$|E
25|$|As {{one of the}} World's {{great powers}} {{together}} with Great Britain, France did not only exercise its influence by conquest {{but also by the}} prestige of its military. At the height of European colonial expansion in the 19th century, France's army and Britain's navy were each regarded as the most powerful forces ever on land and at sea. This lead many a military to copy both powers' military and naval cultures. As most navies in the World adopted the British naval looks (<b>double-breasted</b> navy blue jacket and peaked cap for officer, blue jean collar for ratings, etc.), numerous land armies adopted French-inspired uniforms during the 1860s and 1870s (both Union and Confederate armies during the American Civil War, the Chilean Army of the War of the Pacific, the Russian Imperial Army, etc.) and even sometimes imported types of French units (e.g. Zouave regiments). France's influence on military fashion dimmed for the time being after the most unexpected French defeat ending the Franco-Prussian War of 1870–1871 and many armies then changed to adopt Prussian military style (as a perfect example of this trend, Chilean soldiers traded their kepis for pickelhauben).|$|E
25|$|Officers were {{responsible}} for providing (and paying for) their own uniforms. Consequently, variable styles and decorations were present, according to the officer's private means. Officers in the Infantry wore scarlet coattees with long tails fastened with turnbacks. Close-fitting white pantaloons, tucked into tall Hessian or riding boots were worn, often covered with grey wool and leather overalls on campaign, {{in addition to a}} dark blue, later grey, <b>double-breasted</b> greatcoat. After 1811, officers were permitted to wear a short tailed coatee, grey pantaloons or trousers and low field boots on campaign. Officers generally wore silver or gold epaulettes (depending on regimental colours), with regimental badge to designate rank. An 1810 order stipulated that subalterns wore one epaulette, on the right shoulder, while captains wore one of a more ornate pattern on the right shoulder. Field officers wore one on each shoulder, badged with a star (for majors), a crown (lieutenant colonels) or star and crown (colonels). Grenadier, fusilier and light infantry officers wore more ornate versions of the shoulder wings their men wore on both shoulders; trimmed with lace, chain or bullion. Generals, from 1812, wore an aiguillette over the right shoulder, and rank was denoted by the spacing of buttons on the coatee: Major generals wore their buttons in pairs, lieutenant generals in threes and full generals wore their buttons singly spaced.|$|E
500|$|In September 2014, Whigham {{was cast}} as Dooley, {{for the first}} seven episodes of the series, since the {{character}} is killed off during the first season's penultimate episode. This {{decision was made to}} help build stakes for the series given that [...] "everyone knows Peggy lives". The costumes for the SSR agents in the series are meant to be distinctive to help explain their characters: Dooley wears [...] "the classic 1940s <b>double-breasted</b> looks. Many of his closet pieces are sourced 1940s vintage suits." ...|$|E
500|$|While Wainwright did not {{dress in}} drag {{at any of}} the tribute shows in New York or Europe, he did return to the stage in [...] "Judy drag" [...] for an encore at the Hollywood Bowl performance, [...] "bedecked in a <b>double-breasted</b> tuxedo jacket sans pants, black stockings, high heels, earrings, {{lipstick}} and a tilted fedora". He also took [...] "Get Happy" [...] from the set and performed the tune [...] "Summer Stock"-style during part of his Release the Stars tour to mimic the look of Garland during her performance (pictured on right).|$|E
500|$|The poor knights {{originally}} wore red mantles, each {{of which}} bore St George's Cross, but did not depict the Garter. Queen Elizabeth I replaced the mantles in the 16th and 17th centuries with blue and purple gowns, but the red mantles returned in the 17th century under King Charles I. When the knights were renamed, the mantles were abandoned. The military knights now wear the old military uniform of an [...] "army officer on the unattached list": black trousers with red stripe, a red <b>double-breasted</b> swallow-tailed coat, gold epaulets and brushes, a cocked hat with a plume, and a sword on a white sash.|$|E
500|$|The New York Dramatic Mirror review {{contained}} {{specific details}} about the costumes {{and the production of}} the film, allowing for a view into the lost film. Apparently, Frank H. Crane wore white tights that were bagged at the knees and elbows. Violet Heming wore white gauzy robes, likened to those of fictional fairy princess'. The French gentleman sported a [...] "Prince Albert", referring to the <b>double-breasted</b> Frock coat, and a silk hat. This contrast in gown was unusual, and the other characters wore colonial clothing. The scene containing the tempest which shipwrecks Virginia was described as being ineffective, but reviews in the Mirror were known to be strongly slanted towards Edison Trust companies. This included acting as a spoiler for Ten Nights in a Bar Room to bolster another Licensed company.|$|E
500|$|Zurich Opera's 2008 production, {{directed}} by Jens-Daniel Herzog and conducted by William Christie, threw aside all convention by representing {{the action in}} a 21st-century airport lounge and conference centre, with Rinaldo dressed in a <b>double-breasted</b> navy blazer and needing a drink. [...] "Characters {{go up and down}} on-stage escalators, and the set spins to show various areas of the lounge and terminal. There is a dissection of a small, white furry animal, a large snake, some allusions to Bond girls and character transformations. The Christians pull guns on the Muslims at a signing ceremony". It was, wrote Associated Press critic Ronald Blum, [...] "outrageous – and entertaining". A concert version of Rinaldo was given at the 2009 Edinburgh Festival, by the Bach Collegium Japan conducted by Masaaki Suzuki, with the Japanese soprano Maki Mori as Almirena.|$|E
500|$|On the Blond Ambition World Tour, {{the song}} was {{performed}} as the third song of the set list. The outfit she wore for the performance was described by Carol Clerk, author of Madonnastyle, [...] as the [...] "perfect visual combination of masculine and feminine". It consisted of a <b>double-breasted</b> suit with a tight jacket, which was cut in slits, allowing her conical bra to point through. She also wore her characteristic monocle chain. Madonna wore heavy makeup with thick, blackened eyebrows and heavy application of dark liner. As she finished the performance of [...] "Open Your Heart", Madonna opened the jacket and started to simulate sexual intercourse {{with one of her}} dancers while playing the dominant role. It was followed by an exhibitionist dance routine with a chair as a prop and Madonna singing the song. The performance ended with Madonna wrestling with her female backup singers. Two different performances [...] were released on video: the Blond Ambition Japan Tour 90, taped in Yokohama, Japan, on April 27, 1990, and the Blond Ambition World Tour Live, taped in Nice, France, on August 5, 1990.|$|E
500|$|The pre-war Australian Army uniform {{formed the}} basis of that worn by the AIF, which adopted the broad-brimmed slouch hat and rising sun badge. Peak caps were {{initially}} also worn by the infantry, while light horsemen often wore a distinctive emu plume in their slouch hats. A standard khaki [...] was worn by all arms. From 1916 steel helmets and gas masks were issued for use by infantry on the Western Front. A loose-fitting four-pocket service dress jacket was worn, along with baggy knee breeches, puttees, and tan ankle-boots. A heavy woollen greatcoat was worn during cold weather. The uniform was a drab [...] "pea soup" [...] or khaki colour, while all buttons and badges were oxidised to prevent shine. All personnel wore a shoulder title bearing the word [...] "Australia". Rank insignia followed the British Army pattern and were worn on the upper arms (or shoulders for officers). Identical hat and collar badges were worn by all units, which were initially only distinguished by small metal numerals and letters on the shoulder straps (or collars for officers). However, in 1915 a system of Unit Colour Patches was adopted, worn on the upper arm of a soldier's jacket. Wound stripes of gold braid were also authorised to be worn to denote each wound received. Other distinguishing badges included a brass letter [...] "A" [...] which was worn on the colour patch by men and nurses who had served at Gallipoli, blue chevrons representing each year of overseas service, and a red chevron to represent enlistment {{during the first year of}} the war. Uniforms worn by the AFC were similar to those of the rest of the AIF, although some officers wore the <b>double-breasted</b> [...] "maternity jacket" [...] which had been worn at the pre-war Central Flying School. AFC [...] "wings" [...] were worn on the left breast, while an AFC colour patch and standard rising sun badges were also worn.|$|E
500|$|On October 31, 2013, Gaga {{revealed}} via Twitter that [...] "Dope" [...] {{would be}} the final song available for purchase before the release of Artpop, accessible for digital download from November 4. The single's cover art was also revealed, depicting Gaga wearing a black floppy hat with her brunette hair falling over her shoulders, an oversized [...] "boxy" [...] <b>double-breasted</b> blazer, sheer underwear, one black leather boot and a grill that made her teeth appear larger. Her eyes are covered by a scarf and she has bruises on her belly and around her crotch area. Idolator writer Mike Wass named the cover art [...] "a cross between Frankenstein and Michael Jackson". Matthew Jacobs from The Huffington Post found the cover relatively modest compared to the previous single covers of songs from Artpop. John Walker from MTV News compared the cover to director Tim Burton's works and called it [...] "terrifying". He described Gaga's face and the grills as [...] " [...] the gum-less teeth of a long-buried skull cast in titanium" [...] and believed that the hands and legs were prosthetic. Walker concluded {{by saying that the}} cover reminded him of a [...] "bizarro world" [...] version of singer Janet Jackson's [...] for a 1993 Rolling Stone issue. Lily Harrison from E! Online complimented Gaga for taking the fashion of grills to a [...] "whole new level". She commended the singer's ability to portray her toned figure in spite of the [...] "odd ensemble". A writer for Metro felt that the singer was as [...] "peculiar as ever" [...] on the artwork. Emma Kelly from Daily Star called the cover [...] "creepier" [...] than any horror film and felt that the wide jacket made the singer appear as a rugby player. She compared the digitally altered smile on the single cover to the cover of electronic musician Aphex Twin's EP, Come to Daddy (1997) which features similar inflated grills. Fashion website Refinery29's Leila Brillson felt that the artwork was more of a surrealist move which made Gaga look like a [...] "nightmarish" [...] version of virtual band Gorillaz. Brillson was also unclear if the bruises were related to the song.|$|E
