5|$|Sheep {{are largely}} grazing herbivores, unlike {{browsing}} {{animals such as}} goats and deer that prefer taller foliage. With a much narrower face, sheep crop plants {{very close to the}} ground and can overgraze a pasture much faster than cattle. For this reason, many shepherds use managed intensive rotational grazing, where a flock is rotated through multiple pastures, giving plants time to recover. Paradoxically, sheep can both cause and solve the spread of invasive plant species. By disturbing the natural state of pasture, sheep and other livestock can pave the way for invasive plants. However, sheep also prefer to eat invasives such as cheatgrass, leafy spurge, kudzu and spotted knapweed over native species such as sagebrush, making grazing sheep effective for conservation grazing. Research conducted in Imperial County, California compared lamb grazing with herbicides for weed control in seedling alfalfa fields. Three trials demonstrated that grazing lambs were <b>just</b> <b>as</b> <b>effective</b> as herbicides in controlling winter weeds. Entomologists also compared grazing lambs to insecticides for insect control in winter alfalfa. In this trial, lambs provided insect control as effectively as insecticides.|$|E

40|$|Abstract: The authors {{report on}} their {{qualitative}} study of eight {{students in a}} class on writing for publication {{and the nature of}} the writing process in academia. While the participants found value and purpose in writing and scholarly writing, they had great difficulty with criticism and using feedback in constructive ways. A distinguished speech communication scholar once commented that "an article published in a major journal early in a career could be worth about $ 25, 000 in pay and benefits. [It] can mean a better job [and] higher pay with increased retirement and other benefits " (Phillips, 1982, p. 95). Twenty years later, this statement is <b>just</b> <b>as</b> astounding. <b>Effective</b> writing is an essential skill-now more than ever. The advent of instant worldwide communication has heightened the need for individuals who can access, analyze, and produce clear written communication. Thus, the importance of providing writing instruction in colleges and universities is essential. Requiring students to write papers to a "publishable " standard acquaints students with the scholarly writing process (Shaw, 1999), training them in the conventions, formats, and unique rhetorical styles of their disciplines (Jeske, 1985). Many inside and outside of academia lament the quality and substance of writing (Rankin, 1998). Journal editors observe numerous grammatical and structural errors and frequently find a clear thesis absent in manuscripts (Judy, 1982; O'Donnell, 1982) ...|$|R

40|$|Numerical {{models have}} been {{developed}} to adequately simulate three dimensional flow around obstructions, such as bridge piers, in the flow field. Previously, however, sediment transport formulas available for predicting scour were developed for general scour in unobstructed flow. The capability for numerical models to predict local scour around bridge piers was severely restricted by the sediment transport formulas. This paper describes a new effective Sediment Transport Capacity (STC) formula which accounts for the dominate factors-diving currents, strong vortices and high turbulence-which characterize the local scour process. The new formula adds a new term to a classic sediment transport formula from the Chinese literature. Coefficients for the added term were derived from physical laboratory experimental data and it becomes zero when there is no flow obstruction. That means that the new formula can be used for both general scour and local scour when incorporated into a reliable numerical flow model. The new formula has been tested against independent physical model results and applied to a fill scale study of the proposed Woodrow Wilson replacement bridge. Results from the Woodrow Wilson bridge study are presented in this paper. This paper presents an analogy between the Sediment Transport Capacity and StreamPower and shows that they are directly related. <b>Just</b> <b>as</b> an <b>effective</b> Sediment Transport Capacity is needed to predict local scour with a numerical model, an effective Stream Power is needed to analyze local scour with empirical methods...|$|R

40|$|Although our {{previous}} studies found Pre-B-cell colony-enhancing factor (PBEF) {{as a highly}} up-regulated gene in acute lung injury that could stimulate expressions of other inflammatory cytokines, the underlying molecular mechanisms remain to be fully elucidated. Growing evidence indicates that PBEF is a nicotinamide phosphoribosyltransferase involved in the mammalian salvage pathway of NAD synthesis. This {{study was designed to}} determine whether the effect of PBEF to stimulate expressions of inflammatory cytokines depends on its enzymatic activity. We prepared two human PBEF mutant (H 247 E and H 247 A) recombinant proteins and overexpressing constructs for their overexpressions in A 549 cells and confirmed that enzymatic activities of both mutants were nearly or completely abolished. Two mutants stimulated interleukin- 8 (IL- 8) expression at both the mRNA level and protein level <b>just</b> <b>as</b> equally <b>effective</b> <b>as</b> the wild-type PBEF did. These effects were due to the increased transcription, not the mRNA stability, of the IL- 8 gene. Reporter gene assays and gel shift experiments indicated that AP- 1 transcription factor is required to mediate these effects. SB 203580, a p 38 MAPK pathway inhibitor, and JNK inhibitor 1 can attenuate these effects. Both PBEF mutants similarly stimulated the expression of two other inflammatory cytokines: IL- 16 and CCR 3. These results indicate that PBEF stimulated expression of IL- 8, IL- 16, and CCR 3 via its non-enzymatic activity. This effect is AP- 1 -dependent, in part via the p 38 MAPK pathway and the JNK pathway. This finding reveals a new insight, which may manifest a novel role of PBEF in the pathogenesis of acute lung injury and other inflammatory disorders...|$|R
