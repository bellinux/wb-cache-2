40|$|Objective: Peer {{socialization}} may be {{an important}} contributor to the rising prevalence of diet and muscle gain behaviors (i. e., body change behaviors) in adolescence. The present study longitudinally examined body change behaviors in preadolescents' <b>friendship</b> <b>groups</b> as predictors of preadolescents' own body change behaviors. It was predicted that peer socialization effects would vary according to the gender composition of preadolescents' <b>friendship</b> <b>group.</b> Method: Participants (N = 648, 48. 8 % female) were in grades 6 through 8 at Time 1 and reported their dieting and muscle-gaining behavior at three time points approximately 1 year apart. <b>Friendship</b> <b>groups</b> were identified from preadolescents' friendship nominations. Body mass index and pubertal timing were included in analyses as control variables. A multiple group latent growth curve model was used to examine hypotheses. Results: Socialization of body change behaviors in preadolescent <b>friendship</b> <b>groups</b> was observed only under certain conditions. For members of all-male <b>friendship</b> <b>groups,</b> preadolescents' dieting trajectories were predicted from friends' average level of dieting. Conclusion: Peer socialization effects are associated with trajectories of preadolescents' body change behaviors, particularly among all-male groups. Future research would benefit from incorporating the <b>friendship</b> <b>group</b> context into the study of health risk behaviors in preadolescents...|$|R
40|$|Purpose: Although {{some studies}} among {{adolescent}} girls found that friends within <b>friendship</b> <b>groups</b> were rather similar on dieting and/or body image constructs, these studies were limited by their cross-sectional designs. The current prospective {{study is the}} first to examine <b>friendship</b> <b>group</b> influences on eating disorder risk factors, including body dissatisfaction, weight concerns, dietary restraint, and dieting in adolescent girls. Methods: Design was a two-wave prospective study with 1 -year interval. Of 863 girls (mean age 13. 8, SD =. 7), 344 were members of one of the 103 reciprocal <b>friendship</b> <b>groups</b> identified using social network analysis. Results: Reciprocal friends were similar with respect to body image and dieting constructs. However, initial <b>friendship</b> <b>group</b> levels of body dissatisfaction, weight concerns, dietary restraint, and dieting did not predict individual body image and dieting variables 1 year later. Conclusions: The current findings attest to the significance of reciprocal <b>friendship</b> <b>group</b> correlates of eating disorder risk factors, but suggest that during early-to-mid-adolescence, levels of body image concerns and dieting within reciprocal <b>friendship</b> <b>groups</b> do not influence adolescents' own body image concerns and dieting over 1 year of time...|$|R
