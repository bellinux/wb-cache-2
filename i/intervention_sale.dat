40|$|Abstract: This paper {{investigates the}} intraday effects of unannounced foreign {{exchange}} intervention on bid-ask exchange rate spreads using official intraday intervention {{data provided by}} the Danish central bank.

To test these hypotheses we estimate weighted least squares (WLS) time-series models of the intraday bid-ask spread. Our main result is that <b>intervention</b> purchases and <b>sales</b> both exert a significant influence on the exchange rate spread, but in opposite directions: intervention purchases of the smaller currency, on average, reduce the spread while <b>intervention</b> <b>sales,</b> on average, increase the spread. We also show that intervention only affects the exchange rate spread when {{the state of the}} market is not abnormally volatile.

This paper estimates an FX intervention function for Barbados using a dynamic complementary log-log model. Three general findings emerged: (i) dynamics {{play an important role}} in the Central Bank’s intervention function, meaning that the probability that an intervention takes place today is conditional upon an intervention taking place at least one day prior. This most likely reflects the fact that deficits/surpluses on the FX market tend to be persistent, resulting in intervention over a consecutive number of days; (ii) there appears to be some differences in the response of Central Bank interventions to the other key variables. Particularly, seasonal fluctuations in tourism and interest rate spreads are likely to impact the probability of a <b>sale</b> <b>intervention,</b> but don’t seem to affect the likelihood of a purchase intervention. Moreover, an influx of real estate flows is likely to increase the probability that a purchase intervention takes place, but might have limited impact on the marginal propensity of a <b>sale</b> <b>intervention.</b> Finally, (iii) ‘oil price shocks’ is the only exogenous variable which appears to impact both <b>sale</b> and purchase <b>interventions.</b> ...|$|R

The first objective deals with analyzing the effectiveness of RBI intervention on exchange rate level and volatility. And the second deals with the relevance of asymmetric intervention on exchange rate level and volatility. Using monthly data from July 1995 to July 2013 and GARCH methodology, the thesis empirically estimates two models. First model estimates the effect intervention on the exchange rate level and volatility by measuring intervention as net purchases of US dollar by the RBI. In second model included both purchases and sales of US dollar as a proxy the intervention to analyze the effect of asymmetric intervention on exchange rate level and volatility. The empirical {{findings suggest that the}} RBI intervention is not effective in influencing the level of Rupee/USD exchange rate. However, the study found that the RBI intervention is effective in reducing the volatility. The empirical findings also show that intervention by purchase of USD by RBI significantly reduces volatility whereas <b>intervention</b> by <b>sales</b> significantly increases volatility in exchange rate.

The financial importance of njansang to household livelihoods between 2005 and 2010 was investigated through semi-structured questionnaires with retrospective questions, focus group discussions, interviews and wealth-ranking exercises. The importance of njansang increased strongly in the entire study region and the increase was significantly larger in project households. Moreover, absolute numbers of income from njansang commercialization as well as relative importance of njansang in total cash income, increased significantly more in project households (p < 0. 05). Although the lower wealth class households could increase their income through njansang trade, the upper wealth class households benefited more from the projects' <b>interventions.</b> Group <b>sales</b> as conducted in project villages {{did not lead to}} significantly higher prices and should be reconsidered.

Using a time varying Markov switching model we separate periods of relatively stable market conditions from volatile periods and look at the dynamic of the causality effect under different market conditions. The analysis is conducted for three developing markets, namely Croatia, Iceland and Jamaica and one developed market, Australia, for comparative purposes. We show that direct intervention affects the probability of switching between states in the developed market but has little or no effect in the developing markets reviewed. We argue that this is due to specific intervention practices rather than market characteristics. Additionally, we find that <b>intervention</b> purchases and <b>sales</b> tend to have different effects. Monetary policy is also found to impact the probability of transitioning from one market state to another, sometimes detracting from the strength of the influence of direct intervention on the transition probabilities. ...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Background The {{widespread}} use of in-store marketing strategies to induce unhealthy impulsive purchases has implications for shopping experience, food choice and possibly adverse health outcomes. The {{aim of this study}} was to examine consumer attitudes and evaluate sales effects of a healthy checkout supermarket intervention. The study was part of Project Sundhed & Lokalsamfund (Project SoL); a Danish participatory community-based health promotion intervention. Methods Consumer attitudes towards unhealthy snack exposure in supermarkets were examined in a qualitative pre-intervention study (29 short in-store interviews, 11 semi-structured interviews and three focus group interviews). Findings were presented to food retailers and informed the decision to test a healthy checkout intervention. Sugar confectionery at one checkout counter was substituted with fruit and healthy snacking items in four stores for 4  weeks. The intervention was evaluated by 48 short exit interviews on consumer perceptions of the intervention and by linear mixed model analyses of supermarket sales data from the intervention area and a matched control area. Results The qualitative pre-intervention study identified consumer concern and annoyance with placement and promotion of unhealthy snacks in local stores. Store managers were willing to respond to local consumer concern and a healthy checkout intervention was therefore implemented. Exit interviews found positive attitudes towards the intervention, while intervention awareness was modest. Most participants believed that the intervention could help other consumers make healthier choices, while fewer expected to be influenced by the intervention themselves. Statistical analyses suggested an <b>intervention</b> effect on <b>sales</b> of carrot snack packs when compared with <b>sales</b> before the <b>intervention</b> in Bornholm control stores (P[*]<[*] 0. 05). No significant <b>intervention</b> effect on <b>sales</b> of other <b>intervention</b> items or sugar confectionery was found. Conclusions The present study finds that the healthy checkout intervention was positively evaluated by consumers and provided a ‘responsible’ branding opportunity for supermarkets, thus representing a win-win strategy for store managers and consumers in the short term. However, the intervention was too modest to draw conclusions on long-term sales and health implications of this initiative. More research is needed to assess whether retailer-researcher collaborations on health promotion can be a winning strategy for public health...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Background Away-from-home {{eating is}} an {{important}} dietary behavior with implications on diet quality. Thus, it {{is an important}} behavior to target to prevent and control childhood obesity and other chronic health conditions. Numerous studies have been conducted to improve children’s dietary intake at home, in early care and education, and in schools; however, few studies have sought to modify the restaurant food environment for children. This study adds to this body of research by describing the development and launch of an innovative <b>intervention</b> to promote <b>sales</b> of healthy children’s menu items in independent restaurants in Southern California, United States. Methods This is a cluster randomized trial with eight pair-matched restaurants in San Diego, California. Restaurants were randomized to a menu-only versus menu-plus intervention condition. The menu-only intervention condition involves manager/owner collaboration on the addition of pre-determined healthy children’s menu items and kitchen manager/owner collaboration to prepare and plate these items and train kitchen staff. The menu-plus intervention condition involves more extensive manager/owner collaboration and kitchen staff training to select, prepare, and plate new healthy children’s menu items, and a healthy children’s menu campaign that includes marketing materials and server training to promote the items. The primary outcome is sales of healthy children’s menu items over an 18 -week period. In addition, dining parties consisting of adults with children under 18  years of age are being observed unobtrusively while ordering and then interviewed throughout the 18 -week study period to determine the impact of the intervention on ordering behaviors. Manager/owner interviews and restaurant audits provide additional evidence of impact on customers, employees, and the restaurant environment. Our process evaluation assesses dose delivered, dose received, and intervention fidelity. Discussion Successful recruitment of the restaurants has been completed, providing evidence that the restaurant industry is open to working on the public health challenge of childhood obesity. Determining whether a restaurant <b>intervention</b> can promote <b>sales</b> of healthy children’s menu items will provide evidence for how to create environments that support the healthy choices needed to prevent and control obesity. Despite these strengths, collection of sales data that will allow comprehensive analysis of intervention effects remains a challenge. Trial registration NCT 0251193...|$|R

We conducted a pre-post study to evaluate how a cafeteria-initiated grill menu redesign influenced sales, revenue, and nutrient content of foods purchased. Secondly, we evaluated consumer opinions about menu changes to inform practices for worksite environment <b>interventions.</b> Monthly <b>sales</b> data (2012 – 2015) {{were used to}} compute gross sales and revenue of entrées and side dishes pre-post menu changes. Alternative protein sources replaced red meat; nutrient composition and nutrients purchased were compared using Food Pro software. Consumer responses were queried using online surveys; open-ended responses were analyzed using NVivo. Differences in sales and nutrient content pre-post menu redesign were tested with Wilcoxon Rank Sum tests. Gross sales of entrées (61 vs. 222  servings/month; p =  0. 01) and side dishes (120 vs. 365  servings/month; p =  0. 001) increased more than three-fold post-menu changes. Revenue from entrées (312 vs. 1144  USD/month; p =  0. 01) and side dishes (238 vs. 914  USD/month; p =  0. 001) also increased; per entrée, consumers purchased significantly more unsaturated fat (5  g), and less saturated fat (3  g) and sodium (100  mg). For side dishes, they purchased fewer calories (48  kcal) and unsaturated fat (2. 9  g), but more fiber (1. 8  g), and sodium (260  mg). Four themes emerged from consumer responses: the importance of 1) variety, novelty, choice; 2) cost, affordability, value; 3) health; and 4) food quality, taste. Menu redesign can improve nutrient content, while also increasing sales and revenue. Multi-dimensional assessment of the nutritional, consumer, and retailer implications is desirable practice for enacting similar environmental changes...|$|R

The Czech farmers (vine-growers) can operate in stabilized business environment on the basis of definite rules of economic competition. The Czech Republic within a regulation of an agrarian trade must manage common regulations of a horizontal character and vertical regulations for the sectors of commodities after the integration into the EU. The regulation is executed through the common organization of the market. The common organization of the market in wine is based on three principles – regulation of the supply, regulation of the wine quality and regulation of the market. These rules are concerned with domestic market, when the commodities move within European Union and within foreign trade, when commodities are transported a frontier. The regulation of external agrarian trade, which is concerned with conditions of import and conditions of export, is executed through the so-called trade mechanisms.

The intervention on the $US/$A exchange rate market by the Reserve Bank of Australia in the post-floating period (since 1983 - 97) can be broken into five distinct phases. This paper investigates the changing effectiveness of the RBA’s daily intervention on the exchange rate by decomposing the exchange rate response to the intervention into various separate components and finds that the overall effects of intervention on the days of intervention seemed to be destabilizing. However, we argue that lower (or higher) values of the $A and higher conditional volatility on the days of <b>intervention</b> purchases (or <b>sales)</b> of the $A reflect the simultaneity issue; with sustained and large interventions, the foreign exchange market is stabilised to some extent in terms of direction and volatility. Without these interventions, the market would have moved further and exhibited more volatility...|$|R
40|$|Repetitive {{performance}} of a task can result in learning. The neural mechanisms underpinning such use-dependent plasticity are influenced by several neuromodulators. Variations in neuromodulator levels {{may contribute to the}} variability in performance outcomes following training. Circulating levels of the neuromodulator cortisol change throughout the day. High cortisol levels inhibit neuroplasticity induced with a transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) paradigm that has similarities to use-dependent plasticity. The present study investigated whether performance changes following a motor training task are modulated by time of day and/or changes in endogenous cortisol levels. Motor training involving 30 minutes of repeated maximum left thumb abduction was undertaken by twenty-two participants twice, once in the morning (8 [*]AM) and once in the evening (8 [*]PM) on separate occasions. Saliva was assayed for cortisol concentration. Motor performance, quantified by measuring maximum left thumb abduction acceleration, significantly increased by 28 % following training. Neuroplastic changes in corticomotor excitability of abductor pollicis brevis, quantified with TMS, increased significantly by 23 % following training. Training-related motor performance improvements and neuroplasticity were unaffected by time of day and salivary cortisol concentration. Although similar neural elements and processes contribute to motor learning, training-induced neuroplasticity, and TMS-induced neuroplasticity, our findings suggest that the influence of time of day and cortisol differs for these three <b>interventions.</b> Martin V. <b>Sale,</b> Michael C.

40|$|As {{property}} lawyers, {{we are all}} {{familiar with}} the general principle that a contract {{for the sale of}} land, which is capable of specific performance, operates in equity so as to confer a trust on the purchaser pending completion of the sale. Although some controversy exists as to the exact nature of the trust, it is well established that, upon exchange of contracts, equity will ‘‘treat that as done which ought to be done’’ 1 with the consequence that the purchaser acquires equitable ownership even though full (legal) title to the land will not pass until completion (and registration). As land is unique, specific performance is readily available in the context of sales of land where damages would, clearly, not be an adequate remedy. The same cannot be said for contracts for the purchase of personal property where invariably the subject matter is not unique and where a substitute can easily be acquired in the open market. In circumstances, however, where the property is unique or scarce (for example, a rare painting or vintage car), the maxim that ‘‘equity treats as done that which ought to be done’’ may be invoked so as to confer on the seller an equitable obligation to transfer the property to the purchaser in fulfilment of the contract. Where, therefore, the contract is specifically enforceable in this way, the seller, it is submitted, will again hold the property on trust for the purchaser where, as in a contract for the sale of land, there is an interval between the date of the contract and completion of the sale. The notion that a seller holds personal property upon trust for the purchaser pending completion of the sale is admittedly controversial, but this article seeks to argue that the same principles governing equity’s <b>intervention</b> in <b>sales</b> of land should apply in the context of sales of personalty. It is submitted that equity’s role in imposing a trust on the vendor both in relation to sales of land and personalty may be important in safeguarding the interests of the purchaser prior to, as well as after, completion of the transaction...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Background Sugar-sweetened {{beverage}} {{consumption is}} associated with morbidity and mortality. The retail food environment influences food and beverage purchasing and consumption. This study assesses {{the impact of a}} community pharmacy’s removal of sweet beverages on overall community sales of carbonated soft drinks (CSD) in a rural setting. We also examined whether the pharmacy <b>intervention</b> affected CSD <b>sales</b> in the town’s other food stores. Methods Weekly CSD sales data were acquired from the three food retailers in the town of Baddeck, Nova Scotia (January 1, 2013 to May 8, 2015, n[*]=[*] 123  weeks). Autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA) analysis was used to analyse the interrupted time series data and estimate the impact of the pharmacy intervention (September 11, 2014) on overall CSD sales at the community level. Data were analysed in 2015. Results Before the intervention, the pharmacy accounted for approximately 6  % of CSD sales in the community. After the intervention, declines in total weekly average community CSD sales were not statistically significantly. CSD sales at the other food stores did not increase after the pharmacy intervention. Conclusions This study {{was among the first to}} examine the impact of a restrictive retail food environment intervention, and found a non-significant decline in CSD sales at the community level. It is the first study to examine a retail food environment intervention in a community pharmacy. Pharmacies may have an important role to play in creating healthy retail food environments...|$|R
40|$|Approved {{for public}} release, {{distribution}} is unlimitedA decision by leaders to initiate or join {{a civil war}} is fundamentally a political decision, as is the decision to continue fighting in one. Since the processes by which wars are generally fought are highly influenced by political choices, the United States' decisions to sell military arms to Taiwan {{have been a major}} factor in deterring the PRC from attacking the ROC on Taiwan. Thus, the U. S. goal as defined in section 2 b of the 1979 Taiwan Relations Act (TRA) of a peaceful resolution of the Taiwan issue may be furthered by significantly increasing the economic, military and political cost of reunification by any means other than a peaceful resolution. Consequently, in the post-Cold War environment, the U. S. -ROC relationship has changed very little. In spite of the vast amount of weaponry purchased from the U. S., ROC armed forces do not possess the military hardware required to endure a long-term (more than 90 days) military engagement with the PRC without U. S. <b>intervention.</b> Although arms <b>sales</b> have increasingly been used for political purposes, as well as military ones, experience suggests that such sales are no substitute for solid diplomacy and policy- making with friends as well as foes. Finally, the United States has a strong interest in encouraging both sides to re-energize the political and diplomatic aspects of their relationship and de-emphasize the military dimension.
