25|$|Induced DMT <b>experiences</b> <b>can</b> include {{profound}} time-dilation, {{visual and}} auditory illusions, and other experiences that, by most firsthand accounts, defy verbal or visual description.

25|$|Other writers {{interested}} in regional differences and dialect were George W. Cable, Thomas Nelson Page, Joel Chandler Harris, Mary Noailles Murfree (Charles Egbert Craddock), Sarah Orne Jewett, Mary E. Wilkins Freeman, Henry Cuyler Bunner, and William Sydney Porter (O. Henry). A version of local color regionalism {{that focused on}} minority <b>experiences</b> <b>can</b> {{be seen in the}} works of Charles W. Chesnutt (African American), of María Ruiz de Burton, one of the earliest Mexican American novelists to write in English, and in the Yiddish-inflected works of Abraham Cahan.|$|E
25|$|What we call {{religious}} <b>experiences</b> <b>can</b> differ greatly. Some reports exist of supernatural happenings that {{it would}} be difficult to explain from a rational, scientific point of view. On the other hand, there also exist the sort of testimonies that simply seem to convey a feeling of peace or oneness – something which most of us, religious or not, may possibly relate to. In categorizing religious experiences it is perhaps helpful to look at them as explicable through one of two theories: the Objectivist thesis or the Subjectivist thesis.|$|E

25|$|Some synesthetes often {{report that}} they were unaware their {{experiences}} were unusual until they realized other people did not have them, while others report feeling {{as if they had}} been keeping a secret their entire lives. The automatic and ineffable nature of a synesthetic experience means that the pairing may not seem out of the ordinary. This involuntary and consistent nature helps define synesthesia as a real experience. Most synesthetes report that their experiences are pleasant or neutral, although, in rare cases, synesthetes report that their <b>experiences</b> <b>can</b> lead to a degree of sensory overload.|$|E
25|$|The Innate Knowledge {{thesis is}} similar to the Intuition/Deduction thesis in the regard that both theses claim {{knowledge}} is gained a priori. The two theses go their separate ways when describing how that knowledge is gained. As the name, and the rationale, suggests, the Innate Knowledge thesis claims knowledge is simply part of our rational nature. <b>Experiences</b> <b>can</b> trigger a process that allows this knowledge to come into our consciousness, but the experiences don't provide us with the knowledge itself. The knowledge has been with us since the beginning and the experience simply brought into focus, in the same way a photographer can bring the background of a picture into focus by changing the aperture of the lens. The background was always there, just not in focus.|$|E
25|$|After The Tipping Point, Gladwell {{published}} Blink in 2005. The book {{explains how}} the human unconscious interprets events or cues and how past <b>experiences</b> <b>can</b> lead {{people to make}} informed decisions very rapidly, using examples like the Getty kouros and psychologist John Gottman's research on the likelihood of divorce in married couples. Gladwell's hair was the inspiration for Blink. He stated that he started to get speeding tickets all the time, an oddity considering that he had never gotten one before, and that he started getting pulled out of airport security lines for special attention. In a particular incident, he was accosted by three police officers while walking in downtown Manhattan, because his curly hair matched the profile of a rapist, {{despite the fact that the}} suspect looked nothing like him otherwise.|$|E

500|$|Despite a {{demonstrated}} {{appearance of}} blunted affect, recent {{findings indicate that}} many individuals diagnosed with schizophrenia are emotionally responsive, particularly to stressful or negative stimuli, and that such sensitivity may cause vulnerability to symptoms or to the disorder. Some {{evidence suggests that the}} content of delusional beliefs and psychotic <b>experiences</b> <b>can</b> reflect emotional causes of the disorder, and that how a person interprets such <b>experiences</b> <b>can</b> influence symptomatology. The use of [...] "safety behaviors" [...] (acts such as gestures or the use of words in specific contexts) to avoid or neutralize imagined threats may actually contribute to the chronicity of delusions. Further evidence for the role of psychological mechanisms comes from the effects of psychotherapies on symptoms of schizophrenia.|$|E
500|$|Sustainability {{is central}} to {{underpinning}} feelings of authenticity in tourism. <b>Experiences</b> <b>can</b> be enhanced when substituting the contrived for the genuine, {{and at the same}} time inspire a potentially deleterious appetite for follow-up visits to the real thing: objectively authentic sites untouched by repair or rejuvenation. Feelings of authenticity at a tourist site are thus implicitly linked to sustainable tourism; as the maximisation of existential [...] "felt" [...] authenticity at sites of limited historical provenance increases the likelihood of return visits.|$|E
500|$|Some restaveks do receive proper {{nutrition}} and education, {{but they are}} in the minority. [...] Restaveks' labor includes hauling water and wood, grocery shopping, laundry, house cleaning, and childcare. [...] Restaveks work long hours (commonly 10 to 14 a day) under harsh conditions, are frequently denied schooling, and are at severe risk of mal{{nutrition and}} verbal, physical, and sexual abuse. [...] Beatings are a daily occurrence for most restaveks, and most of the girls are sexually abused, [...] which puts them at an elevated risk for HIV infection. Those who are thrown out or run away from their host homes become street children, vulnerable to exploitation including forced prostitution. [...] Those who return to their families may be unwelcome as an added economic burden or shamed and stigmatized for having been a restavek. [...] The trauma of abuse and the deprivation of free time and normal childhood <b>experiences</b> <b>can</b> stunt a child's development and have long-lasting effects.|$|E

40|$|Throughout life, {{experience}} {{shapes and}} selects {{the most appropriate}} brain functional connectivity {{to adapt to a}} changing environment. An ideal system to study experience-dependent plasticity is the visual cortex, because visual <b>experience</b> <b>can</b> be easily manipulated. In this paper, we focus on the role of interhemispheric, transcallosal projections in experience-dependent plasticity of the visual cortex. We review data showing that deprivation of sensory <b>experience</b> <b>can</b> modify the morphology of callosal fibres, thus altering the communication between the two hemispheres. More importantly, manipulation of callosal input activity during an early critical period alters developmental maturation of functional properties in visual cortex and modifies its ability to remodel in response to experience. We also discuss recent data in rat visual cortex, demonstrating that the corpus callosum plays a role in binocularity of cortical neurons and is involved in the plastic shift of eye preference that follows a period of monocular eyelid suture (monocular deprivation) in early age. Thus, <b>experience</b> <b>can</b> modify the fine connectivity of the corpus callosum, and callosal connections represent a major pathway through which <b>experience</b> <b>can</b> mediate functional maturation and plastic rearrangements in the visual cortex...|$|R
500|$|While Polygon Danielle Riendeau {{praised the}} puzzle design, other critics noted {{its lack of}} {{difficulty}} and short length. Riendeau wrote that the puzzles solutions always felt intuitive and never felt frustrating. She found [...] "everything" [...] about the game to be [...] "soothing, almost hypnotic". Edge thought that the game did not present a [...] "genuine" [...] challenge, and that the puzzles did not [...] "find fresh ways to confound and delight" [...] until the final levels. The magazine compared the game to [...] "assembling flat-pack furniture": straightforward in its process, but rewarding in its transformation. Harry Slater of Pocket Gamer wrote that the game was [...] "almost breathtakingly unique". Riendeau said she finished the game in under three hours, and TouchArcade Shaun Musgrave, who could not [...] "even begin to imagine anyone getting stuck on ... the puzzles", put the game's length at [...] "an hour and change". Jeff Marchiafava of Game Informer wanted more content. He was also unsatisfied with the game's narrative, which he found [...] "obtuse" [...] and [...] "vague" [...] to a fault. Musgrave of TouchArcade thought that while games that focus on <b>experiences</b> <b>can</b> be shorter, Monument Valley {{did not last long}} enough [...] "for the mechanics to reach their full potential", though the time was [...] "just about right" [...] for the story.|$|E
2500|$|Terence Hines (2003) {{has written}} that {{spontaneous}} out-of-body <b>experiences</b> <b>can</b> be generated by artificial stimulation {{of the brain and}} this strongly suggests that the OBE experience is caused from [...] "temporary, minor brain malfunctions, not by the person’s spirit (or whatever) actually leaving the body." [...] In a study review of neurological and neurocognitive data (Bünning and Blanke, 2005) wrote that OBEs are due to [...] "functional disintegration of lower-level multisensory processing and abnormal higher-level self-processing at the temporoparietal junction." [...] Some scientists suspect that OBEs are the result of a mismatch between visual and tactile signals.|$|E
2500|$|The human infant is {{considered}} by attachment theorists to have {{a need for a}} secure relationship with adult caregivers, without which normal social and emotional development will not occur. However, different relationship <b>experiences</b> <b>can</b> lead to different developmental outcomes. Mary Ainsworth developed a theory of a number of attachment patterns or [...] "styles" [...] in infants in which distinct characteristics were identified; these were secure attachment, avoidant attachment, anxious attachment and, later, disorganized attachment. In addition to care-seeking by children, peer relationships of all ages, romantic and sexual attraction, and responses to the care needs of infants or sick or elderly adults may be construed as including some components of attachment behavior.|$|E

2500|$|The Fifth Key {{takes the}} form of a bright silver mirror. Using it, one can travel to any {{reflective}} surface in existence, provided the owner of the Fifth Key has been there before by other means. So far, it is the only Key that has been used in a way other than to accomplish a mundane task; it is able to drain the experiences from mortals, which Friday can then absorb, enabling her to experience mortal emotions for a short time. <b>Experiences</b> <b>can</b> also be returned to mortals (as shown in Lady Friday, wherein Arthur does so), within a time limit, by one who can control the Key's power. [...] It gives dominion over the Middle House and Friday.|$|E
2500|$|Logical positivists such as Rudolf Carnap and A. J. Ayer viewed {{any talk}} of gods as literal nonsense. For the logical positivists and adherents of similar schools of thought, {{statements}} about religious or other transcendent <b>experiences</b> <b>can</b> not have a truth value, and are deemed to be without meaning, because such statements {{do not have any}} clear verification criteria. As the Christian biologist Scott C. Todd put it [...] "Even if all the data pointed to an intelligent designer, such a hypothesis is excluded from science because it is not naturalistic." [...] This argument limits the domain of science to the empirically observable and limits the domain of God to the unprovable.|$|E
2500|$|Adopted {{children}} also often {{find it hard}} to form comfortable and meaningful relationships. These relationships can be friendly, familial or romantic. Because many adoptees feel that their biological parents left them, they may be afraid to form new relationships in fear that those involved may [...] "leave" [...] them as well. This can lead to holding back and withdrawing from relationships when they feel like they are becoming too attached as well as not forming relationships at all. The fear of being left or forgotten is what often holds adoptees back from creating such relationships. Many adoptees feel that they can never truly relate to or trust anybody because their family <b>experiences</b> <b>can</b> be so vastly different from those of people who have not been adopted. It is because of such fears that so many adoptees {{find it hard to}} create relationships in their lives.|$|E
