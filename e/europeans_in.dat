5|$|The {{site was}} {{discovered}} by <b>Europeans</b> <b>in</b> the 17th century, though it was likely earlier explored by aboriginals. It was initially used for storehouses before being purchased by the British, who built a prisoner-of-war camp to hold captives from the Napoleonic Wars and later the War of 1812. The burial ground for prisoners was on the adjacent Deadman's Island.|$|E
5|$|As {{with many}} types Asian and African megafauna, the Javan rhino was relentlessly hunted by trophy and big-game hunters for decades {{following}} {{the arrival of}} <b>Europeans</b> <b>in</b> its range. The rhinos being easy targets, this was as severe a contributor to its decline as was poaching for its horns. Such was the toll of big-game hunting {{that by the time}} the rhino's plight was made known to the world, only the Javan and the (then unknown) Vietnamese populations remained.|$|E
5|$|Contact with Americans and <b>Europeans</b> <b>in</b> {{the early}} 19th century brought more {{settlers}} to the island, {{and had a}} lasting negative ecological effect. On lower slopes, vast tracts of koa–ōhia forest were converted to farmland. Higher up, feral animals that escaped from ranches found refuge in, and damaged extensively, Mauna Kea's native māmane–naio forest. Non-native plants are the other serious threat; there are over 4,600 introduced species on the island, whereas the number of native species is estimated at just 1,000.|$|E

5|$|For years, <b>Europeans</b> <b>in</b> Africa {{had heard}} of an animal that they came to call the 'African unicorn'.

5|$|Home to Aboriginal {{groups for}} over 40,000 years, the Riverina was {{originally}} settled by <b>Europeans</b> <b>in</b> {{the mid-19th century}} as a pastoral region providing beef and wool to markets in Australia and beyond.

The Riverina has strong cultural ties to Victoria, and the region was the source of much of the impetus behind the federation of Australian colonies.|$|E

5|$|The Fourth Crusade {{resulted}} in the disruption of Byzantine manufacturing and the commercial dominance of the Western <b>Europeans</b> <b>in</b> the eastern Mediterranean, events that amounted to an economic catastrophe for the Empire. The Palaiologoi tried to revive the economy, but the late Byzantine state would not gain full control of either the foreign or domestic economic forces. Gradually, it also lost its influence on the modalities of trade and the price mechanisms, and its control over the outflow of precious metals and, according to some scholars, even over the minting of coins.|$|E
5|$|The Late Woodland era is {{generally}} considered to have begun about 600 AD and lasted until the arrival of <b>Europeans</b> <b>in</b> Indiana. It {{was a period of}} rapid cultural change. One of the new developments—which has yet to be explained—was the introduction of masonry, shown by the construction of large, stone forts, many of which overlook the Ohio River. Romantic legend used to attribute the forts to Welsh Indians who supposedly arrived centuries before Christopher Columbus reached the Caribbean. Archaeologists and other scholars have found no evidence for that theory and believe that the cultural development was engendered by the Mississippian culture.|$|E

40|$|Previous {{research}} has characterized European news coverage as mainly domestic in focus, hampering {{the emergence of}} a European public sphere. This study analyses the European nature of the news coverage of the 2009 European Parliamentary elections. We not only describe the level of Europeanness in news coverage but also propose a comprehensive model to explain differences across countries. We employ a cross-national media content analysis (N= 52, 009) conducted in all 27 EU member states. Findings show that especially public TV channels and broadsheet newspapers are more <b>European</b> <b>in</b> coverage than their private and tabloid counterparts. Newspapers are also more <b>European</b> <b>in</b> focus in general compared to television. Furthermore, coverage is more <b>European</b> <b>in</b> countries with higher public EU support, the coverage gets more European during the campaign and is more <b>European</b> <b>in</b> countries that are geographically closer to Brussels, and in which no other elections take place at the same time...|$|R

5|$|Author Jeremy Rifkin had {{previously}} written several books that, like The Empathic Civilization, {{have attempted to}} extrapolate trends in the economy, technology, and society. For example, his 1995 book The End of Work concerns the changes that tele-commuting {{would have on the}} workplace, his 1998 book The Biotech Century concerns the expected impacts of genetic engineering, and his 2002 book The Hydrogen Economy concerns the economic and social effects that will result from the expected replacement of fossil fuels with hydrogen as an energy storage medium. His last book before writing The Empathic Civilization was The European Dream, published in 2004, comparing the American Dream with the values expressed by <b>Europeans</b> <b>in</b> the post-industrial economy. At the time of publication, the 64-year-old Rifkin was working as an advisor to the European Union concerning issues relating to the economy, climate change, and energy security, as well as president of the American non-profit organization the Foundation on Economic Trends.|$|E
5|$|Before European {{settlement}} of North America, Minnesota was populated by a subculture of Sioux called the Dakota people. As Europeans settled the east coast, Native Americans {{moved away from}} them causing migration of the Anishinaabe (also known as Ojibwe) and other Native Americans into the Minnesota area. The first <b>Europeans</b> <b>in</b> the area were French voyageur fur traders who arrived in the 17th century and began using the Grand Portage to access trapping and trading areas further inland. Late that century, Anishinaabe migrated westward to Minnesota, causing tensions with the Dakota people. Explorers such as Daniel Greysolon, Sieur du Lhut, Father Louis Hennepin, Jonathan Carver, Henry Schoolcraft, and Joseph Nicollet mapped out the state.|$|E
5|$|Before {{the arrival}} of <b>Europeans</b> <b>in</b> the area, {{wildebeest}} used to roam widely, probably in relation to {{the arrival of}} the rains and the availability of good forage. They never made such extensive migrations as the blue wildebeest but at one time, they used to cross the Drakensberg Range, moving eastwards in autumn, searching for good pastures. Then they returned to the highvelds in the spring and moved towards the west, where sweet potato and Karoo vegetation were abundant. They also moved from north to south as the sourgrass found north of the Vaal River matured and became unpalatable, the wildebeest only consuming young shoots of sourgrass. Nowadays, almost all black wildebeest are in reserves or on farms and the extent of their movements is limited.|$|E

5|$|Cantonese people, {{like the}} Hakka, were well known {{throughout}} Southeast Asia as mineworkers. Their migration in the 19th century was largely {{directed toward the}} tin mines of Bangka, off {{the east coast of}} Sumatra. Notable traditionally as skilled artisans, the Cantonese benefited from close contact with <b>Europeans</b> <b>in</b> Guangdong and Hong Kong by learning about machinery and industrial success. They migrated to Java {{about the same time as}} the Hakka, but for different reasons. In Indonesia's cities they became artisans, machine workers, and owners of small businesses such as restaurants and hotel-keeping services. The Cantonese are evenly dispersed throughout the archipelago, and number far less than the Hokkien or the Hakka. Consequently, their roles are of secondary importance in the Chinese communities.|$|E
5|$|First {{settled by}} <b>Europeans</b> <b>in</b> the 1790s, Scarborough {{has grown from}} a {{collection}} of small rural villages and farms to become fully urbanised with a diverse cultural community. Incorporated in 1850 as a township, Scarborough became part of Metropolitan Toronto in 1953 and was reconstituted as a borough in 1967. Scarborough rapidly developed as a suburb of Old Toronto over the next decade and became a city in 1983. In 1998, Scarborough and the rest of Metropolitan Toronto were amalgamated into the present city of Toronto. Scarborough is an administrative district in Toronto and has its own community council. The Scarborough Civic Centre, the former city hall, is still used by the municipal government of Toronto.|$|E
