Looking into what domestic institutions {{have to do with}} the global economy, this Article argues that the privatization of governmental services is very much a piece with deregulatory trends in the United States and elsewhere in which state-centered approaches to a variety of regulatory problems increasingly have given way to markets and market discourses at all levels of government. This Article then considers the effects of such privatization trends on the public/private distinction itself, and its implications for democracy in general. This Article comes to the conclusion that we must reform our domestic legal procedures and approaches to issues in order to ensure democratic participation in decisions that have broad societal effects and that involve public and private aspects. The local politics of administrative governance can help shape and transform the law, locally and globally, in important ways.

40|$|Economic {{development}} {{implies that}} the <b>efficiency</b> of firms <b>in</b> developing countries starts approaching that of firms from advanced economies. Various development policies have been pursued to achieve this convergence. We test for this convergence in two economies that represent alternative models of implementing market-oriented development policies: the Czech Republic and Russia. Using 1992 – 2000 panel data on virtually all medium and large industrial firms in each country and accounting for endogeneity of ownership, we find that foreign ownership markedly improved the efficiency of firms, whereas domestic private ownership did not; domestic firms are not catching up to the (world) efficiency standard given by foreign-owned firms. This {{is due in part}} to a slower growth of <b>efficiency</b> <b>in</b> <b>domestic</b> firms over time. However, foreigners' acquisitions of more efficient domestic firms are also contributing to the gap. Domestic firms closer to the frontier are not more likely to catch up than firms farther from the frontier, although foreign firms do exhibit this behavior. The distance of Russian firms to the efficiency frontier is much larger than that of Czech firms. Nevertheless, after nearly a decade of reforms, neither model of development has resulted <b>in</b> convergence of <b>domestic</b> firms to the world standard...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: Energy {{labelling}} {{and minimum}} efficiency performance standards {{have proved to}} be very effective <b>in</b> stimulating energy <b>efficiency</b> improvement <b>in</b> the <b>domestic</b> appliance sector. But standards suffer from long and often difficult implementation periods because of the resistance of the industrial sector. As a consequence, the question has been raised as to whether similar results could not be obtained more easily and at lower cost with voluntary agreements, which offer flexibility margins in the achievement of commitments. This paper analyses the specific advantages of voluntary agreements compared with <b>efficiency</b> standards <b>in</b> the <b>domestic</b> appliance sector. We conclude that voluntary agreements may be an effective instrument in this respect but in certain conditions. The alternative of regulatory measures must remain a credible, realistic threat if voluntary agreements are to have a really significant impact on performance improvement. 1...|$|R

Non-growing oocytes isolated from the ovaries of newborn BDF 1 (C 57 BL/ 6 × DBA/ 2) pups were divided to four culture groups. Five days after culture, the oocytes in 14 μmol/l bpV only, 14 μmol/l bpV plus 100 ng/ml Kit Ligand (KL), and 100 ng/ml KL groups showed significantly (P< 0. 05) growth (19. 3 ± 0. 55, 25. 8 ± 0. 53 and 21. 6 ± 0. 29 μm, respectively) {{compared with that of}} the control (no additive) (16. 9 ± 0. 53 μm).
