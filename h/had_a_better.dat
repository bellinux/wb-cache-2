Along the way, the Spurs {{compiled}} a 12-game winning streak to go 13–2 after 15 games. On November 30, 2010, Duncan recorded his third career triple-double against the Golden State Warriors. 12 days later, {{in a game}} against the Portland Trail Blazers, Duncan became the 94th player in NBA history to play 1,000 games.

The Spurs were 29–4 after 33 games—one of the ten best starts in NBA history–and led the league at 35–6 halfway through the season. Although Duncan produced career-lows in points and rebounds per game, the Spurs ended the regular season as the first seed in the West for the 2011 NBA Playoffs, and were second in the league (to Chicago). Despite finishing with a 61–21 record, however, the Spurs could not avoid being upset in the first round, 4–2, by the eighth-seeded Memphis Grizzlies.|$|E

The threetouchdowns also tied {{the record for the}} most in an ACC Championship Game. Taylor also carried the ball 11times for 24yards and onetouchdown. Taylor's MVP award was his second, and he became the first player to win the honor multiple times. On {{the opposite side of the}} ball, Florida State quarterback E. J.

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this research was}} to investigate the difference of learning achievement in Mathematics on the learning of Cubes and Cuboids in each learning model viewed from the spatial abilities and the cognitive styles. This research used the quasi experimental research with the factorial design of 3 x 3 x 2.

The results of the research are as follows. 1) The students instructed with the NHT learning model with guided discovery method <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>better</b> learning achievement in Mathematics than those instructed with the NHT learning model and those with the direct learning model, and the students instructed with the NHT learning model <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>better</b> learning achievement in Mathematics than those with the direct learning model. 2) The students with the high, moderate, and low spatial abilities have the same good learning achievement in Mathematics. 3) The students with the cognitive style of field independent <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>better</b> learning achievement in Mathematics than those with the cognitive style of field dependent. 4). In each category of the spatial abilities, the students instructed with the NHT learning model with guided discovery method <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>better</b> learning achievement in Mathematics than those instructed with the NHT learning model and those with the direct learning model, and the students instructed with the NHT learning model <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>better</b> learning achievement in Mathematics than those with the direct learning model. 5) In each category of the spatial abilities, the students instructed with the NHT learning model with guided discovery method <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>better</b> learning achievement in Mathematics than those instructed with the NHT learning model and those with the direct learning model, and the students instructed with the NHT learning model <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>better</b> learning achievement in Mathematics than those with the direct learning model...|$|R

At Caltech Bacher attended lectures by Robert Oppenheimer, but spent most of his time at the Mt. Wilson Observatory, which <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>better</b> library. Bacher decided to create a work listing the energy, coupling constant, parity and electron configurations of all the known atoms and ions, working with Goudsmit back in Ann Arbor. The result was a book, Atomic Energy States as Derived from the Analysis of Optical Spectra (1932), which they dedicated to Randall.|$|E
5|$|Returning to Canada, Roberts {{signed a}} three-year {{contract}} with the Toronto Maple Leafs worth $8 million.

A 48-point season followed in 2001–02 and he assumed leadership of the Maple Leafs during the 2002 Stanley Cup Playoffs after team captain Mats Sundin suffered a season-ending injury. Roberts led Toronto past their first round opponent, the New York Islanders, in an occasionally violent seven game series. The Maple Leafs reached the Eastern Conference final, where they ultimately lost to Carolina. Roberts led Toronto in playoff scoring with 19 points in 19 games.|$|E

Ruffing defeated the St. Louis Cardinals in Game One, his seventh World Series victory. This set a record that was surpassed by Ford in 1960.
