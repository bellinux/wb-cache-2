25|$|The T95 and the T95E1 are {{equipped}} with a T208 90mm smooth-bore gun. The T95 equipment was installed on a <b>fixed</b> <b>mount</b> and was stabilized in two axes. The T95E1 equipment was installed on a recoil mount, but lacked stabilization systems. All T95 models were equipped with T320 armor-piercing rounds, which had a tungsten core, a diameter of 40mm, and a muzzle velocity of 1520 meters per second. These rounds could successfully penetrate a 127mm armor plate when fired at a 60-degree angle from 2000 yards. A standard T95 was equipped with 50 rounds.|$|E
25|$|The rear COW gun {{mounting}} {{was installed}} immediately aft of the wing, in a <b>fixed</b> <b>mount</b> that only {{allowed for a}} limited adjustment of the angle. A special sight for this gun was installed in the pilot's cockpit. This armament would be aimed by the pilot from a position below the aircraft attacked, {{in the manner of}} the Schräge Musik installation used by the Germans during WWII. However, the concept was based on the theory of no allowance sighting, which sought to install the gun at an angle at which the body lift of the projectile, due to the forward motion of the aircraft, would compensate for the effect of gravity, straightening the trajectory. The first firing trials resulted in several broken wing ribs, and a special rubber-spring shield was developed to protect the upper wing.|$|E

500|$|The Second World War sparked new {{developments}} in cannon technology. Among them were sabot rounds, hollow-charge projectiles, and proximity fuses, all of which increased the effectiveness of cannon against specific target. The proximity fuse emerged on the battlefields of Europe in late December 1944. Used to great effect in anti-aircraft projectiles, proximity fuses were fielded in both the European and Pacific Theatres of Operations; they were particularly useful against V-1 flying bombs and kamikaze planes. Although widely used in naval warfare, and in anti-air guns, both the British and Americans feared unexploded proximity fuses would be reverse engineered leading to them limiting its use in continental battles. During the Battle of the Bulge, however, the fuses {{became known as the}} American artillery's [...] "Christmas present" [...] for the German army because of their effectiveness against German personnel in the open, when they frequently dispersed attacks. Anti-tank guns were also tremendously improved during the war: in 1939, the British used primarily 2 pounder and 6 pounder guns. By the end of the war, 17 pounders had proven much more effective against German tanks, and 32 pounders had entered development. Meanwhile, German tanks were continuously upgraded with better main guns, in addition to other improvements. For example, the Panzer III was originally designed with a 37mm gun, but was mass-produced with a 50mm cannon. To counter the threat of the Russian T-34s, another, more powerful 50mm gun was introduced, only to give way to a larger 75mm cannon, which was in a <b>fixed</b> <b>mount</b> as the StuG III, the most-produced German World War II armoured fighting vehicle of any type. Despite the improved guns, production of the Panzer III was ended in 1943, as the tank still could not match the T-34, and was replaced by the Panzer IV and Panther tanks. In 1944, the 8.8cm KwK 43 and many variations, entered service with the Wehrmacht, and was used as both a tank main gun, and as the PaK 43 anti-tank gun. One of the most powerful guns to see service in World War II, it was capable of destroying any Allied tank at very long ranges.|$|E
2500|$|In {{the early}} 1950s, work {{began in the}} US to develop an {{eventual}} replacement to the M48 tank, the operational medium tank at the time. [...] A series of relatively simple upgrades to the T48 were considered {{as part of the}} T54 project, but these were considered to offer too little advantage to be worth it. Examples of more radical upgrades were also called for. In September 1954, out of many submitted plans, two main examples were chosen – one of them, the T95; the other, the T96, which used a heavier gun and a 105mm round. Both tanks used smooth-bore barrels with a <b>fixed</b> <b>mount</b> and no recoil system. In November 1956, it was finally decided that nine tanks would be produced. Four of them would be original T95s. One would be a T95 with a 90mm gun on a mount with a recoil system, receiving the designation T95E1. The remaining four would use the T95 chassis and the T96 turret, and were designated the T95E4.|$|E

It was the only version with a buttstock. The 12.5 lb. tripod-mounted version was considered a medium machine gun. The vehicle mounted version was a pintle-mounted machine gun for use by soldiers in land vehicles. The <b>fixed</b> <b>mount</b> version was fired by a solenoid allowing for remote operation {{so it could be}} mounted in a helicopter or other aircraft.|$|E

50|$|A pintle mount is a <b>fixed</b> <b>mount</b> {{that allows}} the gun to be freely traversed and/or {{elevated}} while keeping the gun in one fixed position.

5000|$|Ice cleats or {{crampons}} are {{a type of}} spikes {{that usually}} are attachable under the soles of shoes (in such cases also called [...] "shoe chains") to prevent slipping, especially on ice.

50|$|A <b>fixed</b> <b>mount</b> is not {{moveable}} {{with respect}} to the vehicle. The vehicle must move in order to change direction of fire.

40|$|The {{folowing}} master thesis {{has focused}} on the optimisation and analysis of <b>fixed</b> <b>mounting</b> systems for solar parks. It has been done in colaboration with Hilti Corp., {{one of the most important}} designers and producers of <b>fixed</b> <b>mounting</b> systems for solar power farms worldwide. The current paper compares two existing Hilti's <b>fixed</b> <b>mounting</b> systems each of them made of different material. This comparison shows the differences between two products with the same flexibility, ease of mounting and design concept but made of different materials and produced through different manufacturing processes. At the same time, the analysis aims not to only compare but also to find the optimum utilization point for both systems, in terms of span and cost. The span, or the distance between two support structures determines significantly the output cost of the system overal. As a result the "optimum span" has been also a target of the study. Al the results found have been based on a cost model designed within Hilti specialy for this report which embraces, concurrently, al load data calculated by other Hilti software and other hot topics with regards to design. Although plenty of load calculations and redesigning have been done the ultimate tool used has been the mentioned cost model. This powerful tool has permitted the comparison of both <b>fixed</b> <b>mounting</b> systems in terms of costs, performance and optimisation. Nevertheless, the three concepts just mentioned are aforementioned and they can be described using a performance ratio given by the cost model. This ratio which relates the system cost with the power output from the instalation and has been used as the main assessment variable is Euro/Wp. Thus, a comparison valid not only in the engineering field but also in the marketing can be obtained from the model drawing conclusion whether it is better to design a <b>fixed</b> <b>mounting</b> system for solar parks in aluminium or steel and what are their optimum utilisation points...|$|R

5000|$|Many 3-D {{printers}} of {{the type}} that extrude plastic filament use a [...] "Bowden extruder" [...] to feed the filament through a tube, typically PTFE ('Teflon') to minimize friction, to the 'hot-end' where it is melted and deposited through a nozzle.

40|$|ABSTRACT: In close {{cooperation}} with the University of Cyprus, the Universität Stuttgart operates two identical sets of 13 similar photovoltaic (PV) systems of different technologies at the locations Stuttgart (Germany) and Nicosia (Cyprus). This paper presents the PV and data acquisition systems, and analyses the annual energy yield over {{the first year of}} operation. The average annual yield of <b>fixed</b> <b>mounted</b> PV systems amounts to 1003 kWh/kWprated in Stuttgart, and to 1646 kWh/kWprated in Nicosia. In Cyprus, an additionally installed two-axis tracking system produces 28 % more electricity than the fixed one. The performance ratio of the systems is 80 %. The yield of a concentrating system is in the same range as the one of the <b>fixed</b> <b>mounted</b> systems...|$|R
