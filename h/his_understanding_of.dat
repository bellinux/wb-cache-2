5|$|Much of {{the novel}} emphasises Brooke's {{sexuality}} and <b>his</b> <b>understanding</b> <b>of</b> love. Additionally, the novel contrasts the various elements of English upper- and lower-class life during the Edwardian period. Other notable elements {{of the novel}} include the vivid descriptions of the life in Grantchester and the borrowing of themes from Brooke's poetry such as beekeeping.|$|E
5|$|A passionate {{advocate}} of evolutionary theory, Gould wrote prolifically on the subject, {{trying to communicate}} <b>his</b> <b>understanding</b> <b>of</b> contemporary evolutionary biology to a wide audience. A recurring theme in his writings is the history and development of pre-evolutionary and evolutionary thought. He was also an enthusiastic baseball fan and sabermetrician (analyst of baseball statistics), and made frequent reference to the sport in his essays. Many of his baseball essays were anthologized in his posthumously published book Triumph and Tragedy in Mudville (2003).|$|E
5|$|Four Quartets {{are four}} {{interlinked}} meditations {{with the common}} theme being man's relationship with time, the universe, and the divine. In describing <b>his</b> <b>understanding</b> <b>of</b> the divine within the poems, Eliot blends his Anglo-Catholicism with mystical, philosophical and poetic works from both Eastern and Western religious and cultural traditions, with references to the Bhagavad-Gita and the Pre-Socratics as well as St. John of the Cross and Julian of Norwich.|$|E

5|$|He {{was educated}} in the Episcopal Church, to which he always adhered; and my {{conviction}} is, that he believed in the fundamental doctrines of Christianity as usually taught in that Church, according to <b>his</b> <b>understanding</b> <b>of</b> them; but without a particle of intolerance, or disrespect for the faith and modes of worship adopted by Christians of other denominations.|$|E

5|$|Riley's school {{attendance}} was sporadic, and {{he graduated from}} grade eight at age twenty in 1869. In an 1892 newspaper article, Riley confessed that he knew little of mathematics, geography, or science, and <b>his</b> <b>understanding</b> <b>of</b> proper grammar was poor. Later critics, like Henry Beers, pointed to his poor education {{as the reason for}} his success in writing; his prose was written in the language of common people which spurred his popularity.|$|E

5|$|Andy Harries {{was born}} in Inverness, Scotland on 7 April 1954 {{and grew up in}} Peterborough, England, {{receiving}} primary education at West Town Primary School until 1961, and secondary education at the public Oakham School. He grew up aspiring to be a war correspondent in Vietnam, or an investigative journalist; his idols were Harold Evans, Jon Swain and John Pilger. He left college at the age of 17 with poor A Level results and became a trainee reporter on the Peterborough Evening Telegraph newspaper. His time on the newspaper raised his awareness of politics, and he sought to further <b>his</b> <b>understanding</b> <b>of</b> it by studying at university. He applied to various northern universities to break away from his southern middle-class lifestyle, and was accepted at Hull University.|$|E
5|$|Blake {{claimed to}} have seen visions {{throughout}} his life, and he claimed {{that they were a}} common aspect of life. <b>His</b> <b>understanding</b> <b>of</b> these events was, as he explained, similar to the experiences of biblical prophets. In the commentary to A Vision of the Last Judgement, Blake claimed that the image originated in a particular vision he experienced that allowed him to see the host of Heaven praising God. The actual design of A Vision of the Last Judgement was created in 1808 as an expansion of his 1805 work The Day of Judgement. Blake created this work to be used in Blair's The Grave, which was published 1808.|$|E
5|$|Consequently, and at {{the urging}} of Shufeldt, Heilmann devoted much of the next few years {{attempting}} to find an English–language publisher willing to undertake a translation of his work. None of the larger publishers he approached were willing to do so unless Heilmann himself was prepared to finance it, which he was unable to do. In the meantime, Heilmann took the opportunity to revise and improve his manuscript, which included information he acquired from examining the Berlin specimen of Archaeopteryx {{for the first time in}} 1923 at the invitation of Josef Felix Pompeckj, a professor at the Natural History Museum in Berlin. Examining this important specimen in person allowed Heilmann to add some additional details and revisions to <b>his</b> <b>understanding</b> <b>of</b> the hip, the skull, and the flight feathers. With the help of the English paleontologist Arthur Smith Woodward of the British Museum, he finally met success in finding a small London publisher willing to produce an English version of his manuscript in 1926.|$|E

She first attended Lane College in Jackson, Tennessee, graduating in sociology. Two years later she moved to Fisk University in Nashville earning two master's degrees, first in sociology and then in anthropology in 1944. She assisted her professor, Mark Hanna Watkins, in <b>his</b> <b>understanding</b> <b>of</b> the Vai language, cooperating with him in compiling a Vai dictionary. She agreed to accept a fellowship as a linguistic advisor, after her father died in 1938. She taught French and German at Fisk and also paid her way by giving instruction in African and European folk dancing, as well as teaching the violin, thanks to her own competence on the instrument.|$|E
5|$|Shortly {{before his}} death, {{when he was}} already quite ill, von Neumann headed the United States government's top secret ICBM committee, and it would {{sometimes}} meet in his home. Its purpose was {{to decide on the}} feasibility of building an ICBM large enough to carry a thermonuclear weapon. Von Neumann had long argued that while the technical obstacles were sizable, they could be overcome in time. The SM-65 Atlas passed its first fully functional test in 1959, two years after his death. The feasibility of an ICBM owed as much to improved, smaller warheads as it did to developments in rocketry, and <b>his</b> <b>understanding</b> <b>of</b> the former made his advice invaluable.|$|E
5|$|Sullivan's version added {{women to}} the story; there were no {{significant}} female characters in Stevenson's original. The presence of women (especially Jekyll's fiancée, Agnes Carew) placed Jekyll in traditional social relationships, which made him seem more normal by contemporaneous standards. Hyde behaved lecherously towards Agnes and cruelly towards his landlady, and his behavior towards women in this and later adaptations led to new interpretations of the character. In Stevenson's novella and Sullivan's play, Hyde is said to have committed unspecified crimes. Interpreters began to identify the crimes as sexual, positing sexual repression as a factor in Hyde's characterization. However, Stevenson denied that this was <b>his</b> <b>understanding</b> <b>of</b> the character in his original story.|$|E
5000|$|His {{explanations}} of music theory were heavily {{indebted to the}} theories of musicologist Heinrich Schenker, and <b>his</b> <b>understandings</b> <b>of</b> musical perception owed much to Gestalt psychology, as well as German phenomenology. Zuckerkandl believed music {{was part of the}} [...] "mystical aspect of human existence", and sought to explain its existence in all cultures as a universal phenomenon. He was not well known until his works were rediscovered by scholars in the 1990s.|$|R

5|$|The main {{character}} of Redemption is French crusader Christof Romuald, a once-proud, religious church knight who {{is transformed into}} a Brujah vampire. With his religious faith destroyed, Christof is forced to reassess <b>his</b> <b>understanding</b> <b>of</b> good and evil as he acclimates to his new life. Christof's anchor to humanity is the nun Anezka, a human with a pure soul who loves Chrisof even after his transformation. As a member of the Brujah under Ecaterina the Wise, Christof allies with Wilhem Streicher, the Gangrel Erik, and the Cappadocian Serena during his journeys through 12th century Prague. Other characters in this era include the slaver Count Orsi, the Tremere Etrius, and the Ventrue Prince Brandl.|$|E
5|$|Van Meegeren {{showed his}} first {{paintings}} publicly in The Hague, {{where they were}} exhibited from April to May 1917 at the Kunstzaal Pictura. In December 1919, he was accepted as a select member to the Haagse Kunstkring, an exclusive society of writers and painters who met weekly on the premises of the Ridderzaal. He painted the tame roe deer belonging to Princess Juliana in his studio at The Hague, opposite the Royal Palace Huis ten Bosch. He made many sketches and drawings of the deer, and painted Hertje (The fawn) in 1921, which became quite popular in the Netherlands. He undertook numerous journeys to Belgium, France, Italy, and England, and acquired {{a name for himself}} as a talented portraitist. He earned stately fees through commissions from English and American socialites who spent their winter vacations on the Côte d'Azur. His clients were impressed by <b>his</b> <b>understanding</b> <b>of</b> the 17th-century techniques of the Dutch masters. Throughout his life, van Meegeren signed his own paintings with his own signature.|$|E
5|$|Weber {{joined the}} worker and soldier council of Heidelberg in 1918. He then {{served in the}} German {{delegation}} to the Paris Peace Conference and as advisor to the Confidential Committee for Constitutional Reform, which drafted the Weimar Constitution. Motivated by <b>his</b> <b>understanding</b> <b>of</b> the American model, he advocated a strong, popularly elected presidency as a constitutional counterbalance {{to the power of}} the professional bureaucracy. More controversially, he also defended the provisions for emergency presidential powers that became Article 48 of the Weimar Constitution. These provisions were later used by Adolf Hitler to subvert the rest of the constitution and institute rule by decree, allowing his regime to suppress opposition and gain dictatorial powers.|$|E
