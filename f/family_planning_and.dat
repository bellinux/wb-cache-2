5|$|Human rights {{agreements}} require most {{governments to}} provide <b>family</b> <b>planning</b> <b>and</b> contraceptive information and services. These include {{the requirement to}} create a national plan for family planning services, remove laws that limit access to family planning, ensure that {{a wide variety of}} safe and effective birth control methods are available including emergency contraceptives, make sure there are appropriately trained healthcare providers and facilities at an affordable price, and create a process to review the programs implemented. If governments fail to do the above it may put them in breach of binding international treaty obligations.|$|E
5|$|In the U.S., the National Organization for Women (NOW) {{began in}} 1966 to seek women's equality, {{including}} through the Equal Rights Amendment (ERA), {{which did not}} pass, although some states enacted their own. Reproductive rights in the U.S. centred on the court decision in Roe v. Wade enunciating a woman's right to choose whether to carry a pregnancy to term. Western women gained more reliable birth control, allowing <b>family</b> <b>planning</b> <b>and</b> careers. The movement started in the 1910s in the U.S. under Margaret Sanger and elsewhere under Marie Stopes. In the final three decades of the 20th century, Western women knew a new freedom through birth control, which enabled women to plan their adult lives, often making way for both career and family.|$|E
5|$|Many Western Catholics and non-Catholics have voiced {{disagreement}} on the Church's support for natural <b>family</b> <b>planning,</b> <b>and</b> contend {{it contributes to}} overpopulation and poverty. The Church's rejection of condom use is widely criticized, in particular with regard to countries where the incidence of AIDS and HIV has reached epidemic proportions. In its defense, Catholics cite countries such as Kenya and Uganda, where behavioral changes are encouraged instead of condom use, and where greater progress in controlling the disease has been made than in countries that promote condom use alone.|$|E

25|$|Cantwell has {{expressed}} support for making Plan B contraceptives available to girls 16 and under. In 2007, she cosponsored the Prevention First Act, a bill that sought to increase national access to <b>family</b> <b>planning</b> <b>and</b> preventative methods {{as a means to}} reduce unwanted pregnancies. It included providing women with access to Plan B as well as expanding family planning to be covered under Medicaid. As an advocate of increasing access to <b>family</b> <b>planning</b> <b>and</b> sexual health education, Cantwell argues that these venues for increased education are necessary {{to reduce the number of}} unwanted pregnancies. She received criticism from her Republican challenger, State Senator Michael Baumgartner, who suggested that Cantwell was too extreme and too far to the left of most Washington voters on this issue, and expressed concern about 11-year-olds getting these drugs without a prescription.|$|E

40|$|Introduction: In Nepal, by tradition, {{family life}} and {{marriage}} are generally controlled by patriarchal norms, sanctions, values and gender differences. Women in Nepal have limited possibilities to make decisions regarding their sexual and reproductive health, as the husbands and other elders in the family make most of the decisions regarding <b>family</b> <b>planning,</b> pregnancy <b>and</b> childbirth. Aim: To describe the perceptions of Nepali men regarding {{the role of the}} man with respect to <b>family</b> <b>planning,</b> pregnancy <b>and</b> childbirth. Methods: A qualitative study was conducted with 15 Nepali men in both urban and rural areas. The material was analyzed through inductive content analysis. Findings: One main category and two generic categories were identified. One generic category contained six subcategories and the other five subcategories. The main category was labeled: “He leads – She follows” and the generic categories were labeled: “Supporting women in <b>family</b> <b>planning,</b> during pregnancy <b>and</b> childbirth” and “Withdrawal from supporting women in <b>family</b> <b>planning,</b> during pregnancy <b>and</b> childbirth”. Conclusion: The role of the Nepali men with respect to <b>family</b> <b>planning,</b> pregnancy <b>and</b> childbirth, was identified as a conflicted approach. This study highlights the importance of understanding the influence of culture and tradition when developing strategies for promoting sexual and reproductive health during <b>family</b> <b>planning,</b> pregnancy <b>and</b> childbirth among families in Nepal...|$|R

40|$|Background Unsafe {{abortion}} imposes heavy {{burdens on}} both individuals and society, particularly in low-income countries, {{many of which}} have restrictive abortion laws. Providing <b>family</b> <b>planning</b> counseling <b>and</b> services to women following an abortion has emerged as a key strategy to address this issue. Study Design This systematic review gathered, appraised and synthesized recent research evidence on the effects of postabortion <b>family</b> <b>planning</b> counseling <b>and</b> services on women in low-income countries. Results Of the 2965 potentially relevant records that were identified and screened, 15 studies satisfied the inclusion criteria. None provided evidence on the effectiveness of postabortion <b>family</b> <b>planning</b> counseling <b>and</b> services on maternal morbidity and mortality. One controlled study found that, compared to the group of nonbeneficiaries, women who received postabortion <b>family</b> <b>planning</b> counseling <b>and</b> services had significantly fewer unplanned pregnancies and fewer repeat abortions during the 12 -month follow-up period. All 15 studies examined contraception-related outcomes. In the seven studies which used a comparative design, there was greater acceptance and/or use of modern contraceptives in women who had received postabortion <b>family</b> <b>planning</b> counseling <b>and</b> services relative to the no-program group. Conclusions The current evidence on the use of postabortion <b>family</b> <b>planning</b> counseling <b>and</b> services in low-income countries {{to address the problem of}} unsafe abortion is inconclusive. Nevertheless, the increase in acceptance and/or use of contraceptives is encouraging and has the potential to be further explored. Adequate funding to support robust research in this area of reproductive health is urgently needed...|$|R

25|$|Cultural/traditional {{practices}} do not favour girl’s education. Girls only represent 20% {{of pupils}} in {{primary and secondary}} schools (forced and early marriage plays important role).

However girls {{are more willing to}} partake in learning because education is a means to free themselves from family oppression. There is a rule requiring boys and girls to eat together at school.

From 1972 to 1973, the total amount of individual aids granted by Guarantee Fund for the integration of young immigrants increased from 17 million DM to 26 million DM. Under a law passed in April 1974, the protection hitherto granted to the victims of war or industrial accidents for the purpose of their occupational and social reintegration was extended to all handicapped persons, whatever the cause of their handicap, provided that their capacity to work had been reduced by at least 50%.|$|E
25|$|Although it {{has been}} Thailand's largest {{population}} centre since its establishment as capital city in 1782, Bangkok grew only slightly throughout the 18th and early 19th centuries. British diplomat John Crawfurd, visiting in 1822, estimated its population at no more than 50,000. As a result of Western medicine brought by missionaries as well as increased immigration from both within Siam and overseas, Bangkok's population gradually increased as the city modernized in the late 19th century. This growth became even more pronounced in the 1930s, following the discovery of antibiotics. Although <b>family</b> <b>planning</b> <b>and</b> birth control {{was introduced in the}} 1960s, the lowered birth rate was more than offset by increased migration from the provinces as economic expansion accelerated. Only in the 1990s have Bangkok's population growth rates decreased, following the national rate. Thailand had long since become highly centralized around the capital. In 1980, Bangkok's population was fifty-one times that of Hat Yai and Songkhla, the second-largest urban centre, making it the world's most prominent primate city.|$|E
