5|$|The {{script for}} Part 3 called for Jason {{to wear a}} mask to cover his face, having worn a bag over his head in Part 2; what no one <b>knew</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> time was that the mask chosen would become a {{trademark}} for the character, and one instantly recognizable in popular culture {{in the years to}} come. During production, Steve Miner called for a lighting check. None of the effects crew wanted to apply any make-up for the light check, so they decided to just throw a mask on Brooker. The film's 3D effects supervisor, Martin Jay Sadoff, was a hockey fan, and had a bag of hockey gear with him on the set. He pulled out a Detroit Red Wings goaltender mask for the test. Miner loved the mask, but it was too small. Using a substance called VacuForm, Doug White enlarged the mask and created a new mold to work with. After White finished the molds, Terry Ballard placed red triangles on the mask to give it a unique appearance. Holes were punched into the mask and the markings were altered, making it different from Sadoff's mask. There were two prosthetic face masks created for Richard Brooker to wear underneath the hockey mask. One mask was composed of approximately 11 different appliances and took about six hours to apply to Brooker's face; this mask was used for scenes where the hockey mask was removed. In the scenes where the hockey mask is over the face, a simple head mask was created. This one-piece mask would slip on over Brooker's head, exposing his face but not the rest of his head.|$|E

25|$|Princess Paola of Belgium {{was never}} {{turned away from}} an {{audience}} with Pope John XXIII. While on a private trip to Rome as a tourist whose identity was unknown she went to St. Peter's Basilica. An attendant declined her admittance because her arms were uncovered. Vatican protocol did not allow women with uncovered arms to enter the basilica. Neither the attendant nor the Vatican <b>knew</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> time that the tourist {{was a member of}} the Belgian Royal Family (and future queen). When the Pope discovered what had happened he apologised and invited her to an audience.|$|E
25|$|Euclid (c. 325-265 BC), of Alexandria, {{probably}} {{a student at}} the Academy founded by Plato, wrote a treatise in 13 books (chapters), titled The Elements of Geometry, in which he presented geometry in an ideal axiomatic form, which {{came to be known as}} Euclidean geometry. The treatise is not a compendium of all that the Hellenistic mathematicians <b>knew</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> time about geometry; Euclid himself wrote eight more advanced books on geometry. We know from other references that Euclid’s was not the first elementary geometry textbook, but it was so much superior that the others fell into disuse and were lost. He was brought to the university at Alexandria by Ptolemy I, King of Egypt.|$|E
25|$|Giuliani met local {{television}} personality Donna Hanover sometime in 1982, {{and they began}} dating when she was working in Miami. Giuliani filed for legal separation from Peruggi on August 12, 1982. The Giuliani-Peruggi marriage legally ended in two ways: a civil divorce was issued {{by the end of}} 1982, while a Roman Catholic church annulment of the Giuliani-Peruggi marriage was granted at the end of 1983 reportedly because Giuliani had discovered that he and Peruggi were second cousins. Giuliani biographer Wayne Barrett reports that Peruggi's brother believes that Giuliani <b>knew</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> time of the marriage that they were second cousins. Alan Placa, Giuliani's best man, later became a priest and helped get the annulment. Giuliani and Peruggi did not have any children.|$|E

500|$|The family {{remained}} in Paris for two months. No concerts were given by {{them in this}} period although, according to Grimm, there were performances of Wolfgang's symphonies. Grimm was effusive {{about the development of}} both children; Nannerl, he wrote, [...] "had the finest and most brilliant execution on the harpsichord", and: [...] "no-one but her brother can rob her of supremacy". Of Wolfgang he quoted a Prince of Brunswick as saying that many Kapellmeisters at the peak of their art would die without knowing what the boy <b>knew</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> age of nine. [...] "If these children live," [...] wrote Grimm, [...] "they will not remain in Salzburg. Monarchs will soon be disputing about who should have them".|$|E
500|$|David Gautreaux {{was cast}} as Xon on September 26, after {{approaching}} the casting director himself, having no agent. He {{had heard about}} the part, as he was dating the employee of an agent at the time. The final audition for the role had eight actors, including Gautreaux, of various ages and sizes. Gautreaux later said that the one thing they all had in common was a slightly alien appearance. He was hired to a $15,000 fee for the pilot, a guaranteed payment for the 13 episodes {{whether or not they were}} filmed, and a six-year option on his contract. Despite this, he was required to return for a further audition within a couple of weeks. Majel Barrett was due to return as Christine Chapel, this time as a doctor, and the actress was concerned that the romantic chemistry she shared with Nimoy might not work with a younger actor. She instead wanted an older British actor to play the role. Gautreaux, now with an agent, secured a further $2,500 fee to return and audition again, since it would cause him to miss out on a guest appearance for the same fee on the television series Fantasy Island. He retained the part, saying that the other actor was [...] "absolutely abominable". It was only after this further audition that he was told what few others <b>knew</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> time: that Phase II had already been cancelled, and they were instead going to make a feature film.|$|E
500|$|In Oedipus Rex, Oedipus is the protagonist. Oedipus' {{infanticide}} {{is planned}} by his parents, Laius and Jocasta, to avert him from fulfilling a prophecy; in truth, the servant entrusted with the infanticide passes the infant on {{through a series}} of intermediaries to a childless couple, who adopt him not knowing his history. Oedipus eventually learns of the Delphic Oracle's prophecy of him, that he would kill his father and marry his mother; Oedipus attempts to flee his fate without harming those he knows as his parents (at this point, he does not know that he is adopted). Oedipus meets a man at a crossroads accompanied by servants; Oedipus and the man fight, and Oedipus kills the man (who was his father, Laius, although neither <b>knew</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> time). He becomes the ruler of Thebes after solving the riddle of the sphinx and in the process, [...] marries the widowed queen, his mother Jocasta. [...] Thus the stage is set for horror. When the truth comes out, following from another true but confusing prophecy from Delphi, Jocasta commits suicide, Oedipus blinds himself and leaves Thebes. At the end of the play, order is restored. This restoration is seen when Creon, brother of Jocasta, becomes king, and also when Oedipus, before going off to exile, asks Creon {{to take care of his}} children. [...] Oedipus's children will always bear the weight of shame and humiliation because of their father's actions.|$|E

He traveled back home with another Sharkey trainee, Rick Rude. In 1983 fate struck these two again. Animal's partner for the night would find himself in legal trouble. Needing a quick replacement, Ole Anderson gave Hawk a call. They would be paired together again, this time as tag team partners. Anderson gave them the name the Road Warriors.

2500|$|Hogan {{is thought}} to have {{developed}} a [...] "secret" [...] which made his swing nearly automatic. There are many theories as to its exact nature.

However, many believed Hogan did not reveal all that he <b>knew</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> time. It has since been alleged in Golf Digest magazine, and by Jody Vasquez in his book [...] "Afternoons With Mr Hogan", that the second element of Hogan's [...] "secret" [...] was the way in which he used his right knee to initiate the swing and that this right knee movement was critical to the correct operation of the wrist.|$|E
