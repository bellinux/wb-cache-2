500|$|Lydia Hand was an {{involved}} and protective mother, {{who had been}} influenced by a Calvinist aunt as a child; and she passed on {{a strong sense of}} duty and guilt to her only son. Learned Hand eventually came to understand the influences of his parents as formative. After his father's death, he looked to religion to help him cope, writing to his cousin Augustus Noble Hand: [...] "If you could imagine one half the comfort my religion <b>has</b> <b>given</b> <b>to</b> me in this terrible loss, you would see that Christ never forsakes those who cling to him." [...] The depth of Hand's early religious convictions was in sharp contrast to his later agnosticism.|$|E

[...] Sullivan's only wholly serious opera, Ivanhoe (1891), received generally favourable reviews, although J. A. Fuller Maitland, in The Times, expressed reservations, writing that the opera's [...] "best portions rise so far above anything else that Sir Arthur Sullivan <b>has</b> <b>given</b> <b>to</b> the world, and have such force and dignity, that {{it is not difficult to}} forget the drawbacks which may be found in the want of interest in much of the choral writing, and the brevity of the concerted solo parts."

500|$|The future {{location}} of the statue was a contentious issue from the outset, with Fox's proposal of a site in Hyde Park being sidelined in favour of leaving the site open for future consideration. The appropriateness of its theme {{in relation to the}} Great Exhibition was also questioned. The Art Journal pointed out the contradiction between [...] "the effigy of a valiant crusader" [...] and [...] "the great Peace congress of 1851" [...] and asked why [...] "a foreign sculptor alone" [...] was being selected to commemorate a British exhibition. The Lord Mayor of London, Thomas Challis, was similarly critical, declaring that the statue depicted [...] "muscular power and the almost savage ferocity of war ..., while ... the Great Exhibition afforded an example of the cordial amity of nations." [...] His criticism was perhaps not unrelated {{to the fact that he}} was promoting a rival scheme to commemorate the Exhibition. Others criticised the statue's lack of realism. As The Times observed after the statue's installation, the sculptor [...] "sacrificed probabilities in the close fit he <b>has</b> <b>given</b> <b>to</b> Richard's mail shirt, which is made to display the swelling biceps and folded mass of pectoral muscle as accurately as a knitted woollen jersey." ...|$|E

500|$|As in {{previous}} seasons, filming {{of the third}} season of the series included {{a large amount of}} improvisation from the cast. For example, during one scene in [...] "The Fight" [...] in which almost the entire cast becomes intoxicated at the Snakehole Lounge bar, each actor spent about two days on their own filming their own individual scenes. Much of the filming was improvised, including shots used in a montage sequence that showed how drunk each character had become {{by the end of the}} night. Amy Poehler described the filming as [...] "the most fun I've ever had". Nick Offerman and Megan Mullally also improvised a great deal of their scenes during the filming of [...] "Ron & Tammy: Part Two". The third season continued to use several visual and camera techniques that had been introduced in past seasons. In the past, Poehler would improvise several different jokes during a take, and they would be intermingled into a montage of jump cuts featuring many of the jokes. That technique was used prominently in [...] "Indianapolis" [...] during a scene in which Leslie comforts Ann with stories about multiple times Leslie was dumped in the past. The same technique was used by Aziz Ansari in [...] "Soulmates", during a scene in which Tom describes many slang nicknames he <b>has</b> <b>given</b> <b>to</b> foods, and in [...] "The Fight", in which Tom describes many strange entrepreneurial idea he has come up with.|$|E
500|$|In 1935, Sadler {{concluded}} that the papers found in the sleeping patient's house were not a hoax, citing their [...] "genuineness and insight", and arguing that the sleeping man was not a medium for the dead, but was used by living beings to communicate. Papers ceased appearing in the sleeping man's house in the 1930s; Sadler then took a clear role {{as leader of the}} discussion group. The forum discontinued their discussion meetings in 1942, and The Urantia Book was published in 1955; it purportedly contained information from the celestial beings who had spoken through the sleeping man. The Urantia Book presents itself as the fifth [...] "epochal" [...] revelation God <b>has</b> <b>given</b> <b>to</b> humanity, and states that its purpose is to help humanity evolve to a higher form of life. It has four sections. The first section covers the nature of God and the universe, the second describes the portions of the universe nearest to Earth and Lucifer's rebellion, the third details the history of Earth and human religions, and the fourth provides an account of Jesus's life and accompanying doctrines. Sadler maintained that the teachings of the book were [...] "essentially Christian" [...] and [...] "entirely harmonious with ... known scientific facts". Although Sadler had left the Adventist church by the time The Urantia Book was published, its teachings are broadly consistent with some aspects of Adventist theology, such as soul sleep and annihilationism. Journalist Brook Wilensky-Lanford argues in her 2011 profile of the Urantia movement that Sadler's departure from the Adventist church gave him the desire to build a new religious movement, citing the emphasis that Sadler placed on the discussion of the Garden of Eden in The Urantia Book as evidence of his desire to start anew. Sadler hoped that the content of the revelation would convince people of its worth, and did not attempt to win supporters by emphasizing its author. Wilensky-Lanford argues that Sadler attempted to avoid placing an individual at the center of his beliefs owing to his disappointment in Ellen White; however, Gardner believes that Sadler placed his faith in Wilfred Kellogg as he had in White.|$|E
500|$|According to Weinstein, [...] "Viking metal has {{travelled}} {{further than}} any Viking ship. Self-defined pagan metal bands who describe their music as Viking metal {{can be found}} in the United States, Brazil and Uruguay, among other places." [...] The sensationalism of the early Norwegian black metal scene might be responsible for some of this popularity, but Weinstein considers the genre's greatest influence to be [...] "the inspiration it <b>has</b> <b>given</b> <b>to</b> others to explore their own roots". This impact was particularly strong in the Baltic states, where Viking metal influenced the development of a distinct pagan metal scene known as [...] "Baltic war metal". The Lithuanian band Obtest, formed as a black metal band in 1993 with Lithuanian lyrics, birthed the war metal scene with the 1997 album Tūkstantmetis. Michael F. Strmiska comments that despite the claim that Scandinavia was home to the last pagans in Europe, within the scene: [...] "A point of particular pride is the knowledge that Lithuania was the last country in all of Europe to officially abandon its native Pagan traditions and convert to Christianity in 1387." [...] Another Baltic band influenced by Viking metal is the Latvian project Skyforger, which composes its lyrics in the Latvian language. A third example of the influence of Viking metal on pagan metal is the national socialist black metal band Graveland from Poland, which on its second album, Thousand Swords, released in 1995, featured a variety of folk styles mixed in with the band's black metal sound, and introduced lyrics about Polish history and Slavic gods. Viking metal has also influenced the Russian Rodnoverie movement, particularly the texts of Varg Vikernes, many of which have been translated into Russian. Though some of his readers within Rodnoverie distance themselves from the racism and political statements within Vikernes' work, other followers have embraced racist and National Socialist ideas. [...] Contemporaneous to the rise of Viking metal has been the emergence of Celtic metal in Ireland, France, and even Germany, a style which sounds essentially like Viking metal, apart from the addition of harps, but with lyrics celebrating Celtic gods and myths.|$|E
