50|$|In Japan and Europe, {{regulations}} {{have come into}} effect {{in recent years that}} place a limit on the severity of pedestrian head injury when struck by a motor vehicle. This is leading to more advanced hood designs, as evidenced by multicone <b>hood</b> <b>inner</b> <b>panel</b> designs as found on the Mazda RX-8 and other vehicles. Other changes are being made to use the hood as an active structure and push its surface several centimeters away from the hard motor components during a pedestrian crash. This may be achieved by mechanical (spring force) or pyrotechnic devices.|$|E
40|$|Abstract: Car- Pedestrian {{accidents}} cause a loss {{of thousands}} of lives annually in addition to injuries. Therefore, pedestrian protection is one of the important issue in the design of friendly cars. This study shows the performance of finite element head model (FEM) to study and foretelling the extent of injury that occurs at pedestrian accidents and tests the design of the front of vehicle according to European Enhanced Vehicle-Safety Committee (EEVC WG 17) regulations of bonnet test. The FE models are powerful tools and effective method to understand how to reduce the sever ity of the fatalities of injuries in road pedestrian collision incidents. In this study, the finite element head model impactor has been built by using Soldworks program and simulated the impact process in LS-DYNA program to examine the four engine-hoods have been designed. All of the hood plates and inner hood panel were considered. Head Injury Criterion (HIC), internal energy time history generated in the head and hood, displacement occurred in the <b>hood</b> <b>inner</b> <b>panel</b> and weights of the complete hood are investigated. The results of the study concluded that modification of headform design of the car hood contributes in achieving low HIC and lead to a pedestrian friendly car. The results show that the structural design of the inner hood panel {{is one of the key}} factors affecting the design and specifications of car hood...|$|E
40|$|To improve safety {{performance}} of the investigated vehicle for child pedestrian protection, a finite element model of child pedestrian head-form impact with hood was developed. The validity of the proposed model was evaluated based on the test data of a similar car in literature. A comparison of protective performance between steel and aluminum hoods with the same initial structure was conducted for pedestrian protection. Two types of alloy aluminium <b>hoods</b> with wavilness <b>inner</b> <b>panel</b> <b>hood</b> and sandwich structure hood were designed to protect pedestrian head. The energy absorber structure between hood-side-edges and wings was investigated to increase energy absorption and minimize the head impact acceleration. The results show that a significant mitigation of the head injury risk is achieved by the proposed hood design during the child head-form impact with hood in the test zones of the investigated car. The two types of proposed hoods have a comparable bending static stiffness with that of original hood, and increased lateral bending and torsion stiffness can be achieved...|$|R

It was a mid wing cantilever monoplane with gull wings of strongly straight tapered, elliptically tipped plan. The <b>inner</b> <b>panels</b> extended over rather more than one third span and were mounted with about 10° of dihedral; there was no dihedral outboard but the trailing edges of these outer panels was completely occupied with ailerons.

40|$|This article {{presents}} research {{motivated by the}} prospect of imminent implementation of the new regulatory requirement for pedestrian protection GTR- 9 (Global Technical Regulation- 9). A new methodology has been developed for optimisation of the hood panel of passenger cars to ensure that the pedestrian Head Injury Criterion (HIC) falls below the threshold values specified by both the GTR- 9 and the consumer metric, the Australian New Car Assessment Program (ANCAP). To meet the performance criteria for pedestrian protection head impact, it is vital to incorporate the associated design parameters into the hood design process at an early stage. These parameters are architectural in nature whereby changing them later in the vehicle design process would be very expensive and difficult to implement. The developed methodology for the design of a hood configuration aims to provide a robust and homogeneous HIC for different impact positions in the central area of the hood of a large sedan, taking into consideration the limited space available for deformation. The non-linear Finite Element Analysis (FEA) software LS-DYNA was used in this research to simulate the GTR- 9 /ANCAP pedestrian head impact testing procedures. The efficiency of a hood design was calculated as the ratio of the theoretical optimal deformation of hood assemblyfor a given value of HIC to the actual deformation calculated for the same HIC value of the corresponding numerical test. The efficiency and HIC value were derived for each configuration and compared to obtain the optimal solution for homogeneous performance and minimal deformation of outer and <b>inner</b> <b>hood</b> <b>panels.</b> The Kriging response surface and the Monte Carlo method were used in the design of numerical experiments. The outcomes of this study provide a clear indication that an optimum configuration of the hood panel of a passenger car can be developed to minimize the hood deformation while meeting the requirement for HIC value...|$|R

30|$|The {{relative}} {{density of the}} cytoskeleton panel in the probing volume may be expressed as the ratio of At% to Ad%, represented as D. As shown in Table  1, the cancerous CaSki cells showed at least a threefold increase in elastic density (D%) of the inner panels; however, the elastic density of the cortical panel decreased by 82  % compared with its normal counterparts. These finding may be attributable to the depolymerization of F-actin at the cell cortex [33] and upregulation of the expression of microtubulin in the <b>inner</b> <b>panels</b> [37]. Changes in cell stiffness are important for initial adhesive interactions during cell migration in vivo. Disruption of F-actin increases cell adhesion, whereas disruption of tubulin reduces adhesive interactions in vivo [34]. Therefore, lower cortical tension and higher elastic density of the <b>inner</b> <b>panels</b> may increase the adhesive properties of CaSki, thereby facilitating migration and transformation.|$|R

5000|$|The Circe {{is built}} from {{composite}} materials, with flying surfaces and fuselage shells made from glass-balsa-glass sandwiches. The wings {{have a single}} spar with flanges of aligned glass fibre (uni-directional rovings) and a glass-balsa sandwich web. The fuselage has GRP-balsa stiffening cross-members. The wing is tapered in two sections, with more taper on the outer 40% of the span. Such double taper plans can provide lift/drag ratios close {{to that of the}} ideal elliptical wing, and have benign stall characteristics.

40|$|We {{identified}} and quantified {{the effect of}} season, depth, and <b>inner</b> and outer <b>panel</b> mesh size on the trammel net catch species composition and catch rates in four southern European areas (Northeast Atlantic: Basque Country, Spain; Algarve, Portugal; Gulf of Cádiz, Spain; Mediterranean: Cyclades, Greece), {{all of which are}} characterised by important trammel net fisheries. In each area, we conducted, in 1999 – 2000, seasonal, experimental fishing trials at various depths with trammel nets of six different inner/outer panel mesh combinations (i. e., two large outer panel meshes and three small <b>inner</b> <b>panel</b> meshes). Overall, our study covered some of the most commonly used <b>inner</b> <b>panel</b> mesh sizes, ranging from 40 to 140 mm (stretched). We analysed the species composition and catch rates of the different inner/outer panel combinations with regression, multivariate analysis (cluster analysis and multidimensional scaling) and other ‘community’ techniques (number of species, dominance curves). All our analyses indicated that the outer panel mesh sizes {{used in the present study}} did not significantly affect the catch characteristics in terms of number of species, catch rates and species composition. Multivariate analyses and seasonal dominance plots indicated that in Basque, Algarve and Cyclades waters, where sampling covered wide depth ranges, both season and depth strongly affected catch species compositions. For the Gulf of Cádiz, where sampling was restricted to depths 10 – 30 m, season was the only factor affecting catch species composition and thus group formation. In contrast, the <b>inner</b> <b>panel</b> mesh size did not generally affect multidimensional group formation in all areas but affected the dominance of the species caught in the Algarve and the Gulf of Cádiz. Multivariate analyses also revealed 11 different métiers (i. e., season–depth–species–inner panel mesh size combinations) in the four areas. This clearly indicated the existence of trammel net ‘hot spots’, which represent essential habitats (e. g., spawning, nursery or wintering grounds) of the life history of the targeted and associated species. The number of specimens caught declined significantly with <b>inner</b> <b>panel</b> mesh size in all areas. We attributed this to the exponential decline in abundance with size, both within- and between-species. In contrast, the number of species caught in each area was not related to the inner mesh size. This was unexpected and might be a consequence of the wide size-selective range of trammel nets...|$|R
