5|$|As a {{response}} to the cancellation, fans created online petitions, called Netflix, and tweeted #RenewSense8 and other hashtags, in an attempt to bring back the show. On June 8, 2017, the show's social media accounts acknowledged the fans' efforts, and wrote that Netflix looked into the renewal of Sense8 a second time, however they concluded it wasn't possible. Smith released a letter to the fans reiterating the reason for the cancellation was low viewership, and explaining that the reason he rallied them to voice their support before the show was officially cancelled, was that once that happens, there is no going back. He praised Netflix for their support while making the show, and thanked the fans for putting up a great <b>fight</b> <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> it alive. On June 10, 2017, Chief Content Officer of Netflix Ted Sarandos during his talk on Produced By Conference, explicitly commented the show was cancelled because its audience, despite being very passionate, wasn't large enough to support the high production costs to travel and film around the globe.|$|E

The dams would store water, which would be used to reclaim over 6,000,000 acres of arid land through irrigation. The proposal was supposed to pay for itself through the sale of the power generated by the dams. In December 1921, the Arizona Fish and Game was formed, with Colter serving on its executive committee. In 1922, under doctor's orders, Colter booked an around-the-world cruise to recover his health.

500|$|One month later, Nintendo of America {{contacted}} Lucasfilm Games {{to request}} {{the removal of}} offensive text and nude graphics.

Unable to comply without simultaneously removing the hint, the team simply shortened it. Sexually suggestive and otherwise [...] "graphic" [...] dialogue was edited, including a remark from Dr. Fred about [...] "pretty brains [...] sucked out".

500|$|The Colour of Magic is {{the second}} live-action {{adaptation}} of Terry Pratchett's Discworld series, following the highly successful Hogfather, which was broadcast over Christmas 2006 {{to an audience of}} 2.6 million. After the success of Hogfather, Pratchett was easily persuaded to release the rights for The Colour of Magic and The Light Fantastic. Vadim Jean was employed to adapt the two literary works into a three-hour, two-part screenplay. [...] While Pratchett was given [...] "carte blanche" [...] to [...] "turn up whenever [...] wanted", he was happy to see a more liberal interpretation of his first two works than he had been for Hogfather. Speaking to Sky Magazine, Pratchett said that, [...] "There [...] not so much emotional baggage... riding on The Colour of Magic and The Light Fantastic. It was just this book of mine that suddenly started selling incredibly well". Jean's main challenge was to streamline the plot and remove the many irrelevant, but highly amusing, tangents that are an iconic feature of Pratchett's work, without destroying the appeal of the books. [...] Jean said that [...] "there [...] a real danger, with this story, that one could strip out the 'Pratchett-ness'... I had to <b>fight</b> <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> [...] in". Pratchett was pleased with the final script, saying [...] "it wasn't the slaughter job I thought it would have to be", and [...] " [...] to keep the soul... it's still recognisably [...] book".|$|E

Among his first contacts was Arturo Guzmán Decena, an Army lieutenant who was reportedly asked by Osiel Cárdenas to look for the [...] "best men possible." [...] Consequently, Guzmán Decenas deserted from the Armed Forces and brought more than 30 army deserters to form part of Cárdenas’ new [...] criminal paramilitary wing. They were enticed with salaries much higher than those of the Mexican Army. Among the original defectors were Jaime González Durán, Jesús Enrique Rejón Aguilar, Miguel Treviño Morales, and Heriberto Lazcano, who would later become the supreme leader of the independent cartel of Los Zetas. The creation of Los Zetas brought a new era of drug trafficking in Mexico, and little did Cárdenas know that he was creating the most dangerous drug cartel in the country. Between 2001 and 2008, the organization of the Gulf Cartel and Los Zetas was collectively known as La Compañía (The Company).|$|E
