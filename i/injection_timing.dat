2500|$|Fuel {{systems on}} the modern diesel engine were not {{designed}} to accommodate biodiesel, while many heavy duty engines are able to run with biodiesel blends e.g. B20. Traditional direct injection fuel systems operate at roughly 3,000 psi at the injector tip while the modern common rail fuel system operates upwards of 30,000 PSI at the injector tip. Components are designed to operate at a great temperature range, from below freezing to over [...] Diesel fuel is expected to burn efficiently and produce as few emissions as possible. As emission standards are being introduced to diesel engines the need to control harmful emissions is being designed into the parameters of diesel engine fuel systems. The traditional inline injection system is more forgiving to poorer quality fuels {{as opposed to the}} common rail fuel system. The higher pressures and tighter tolerances of the common rail system allows for greater control over atomization and <b>injection</b> <b>timing.</b> This control of atomization as well as combustion allows for greater efficiency of modern diesel engines as well as greater control over emissions. Components within a diesel fuel system interact with the fuel in a way to ensure efficient operation of the fuel system and so the engine. If an out-of-specification fuel is introduced to a system that has specific parameters of operation, then the integrity of the overall fuel system may be compromised. Some of these parameters such as spray pattern and atomization are directly related to <b>injection</b> <b>timing.</b>|$|E
2500|$|The Series II Land Rover was a sales success, {{but there}} was still room for improvements. In 1962 the {{slightly}} altered Series IIA was launched. As well as some suspension and steering system changes, the biggest update was an improved diesel engine. This shared many parts with its petrol-fuelled sibling, including the block, valve gear, cooling systems and lubrication systems. A forged crankshaft was used for added strength, and different pistons were needed. The cylinder head used the same basic casting, but was very different internally, being in essence an updated version of that used on the original 2-litre engine, to which the new diesel bore a strong external resemblance. Like the 2.25-litre petrol, the 2.25-litre diesel was a dry-liner design. It was built on the same production line as the petrol engine and the flexibility of the basic design was much in evidence- for example, where the diesel engines had their fuel injector pumps, the petrol engine had its distributor fitted. Although it offered a modest improvement in power and a useful jump in torque, the main benefit of the new diesel engine was that it was much quieter and more efficient than the older unit. It also proved to be much more reliable in service. Like the petrol engine, the diesel was upgraded to a 5-bearing crankshaft in 1980. The engine was fitted to the Austin FX4 Black Cab between 1982 and 1985. FX4s fitted with the engine were designated 'FX4R' ('R' for 'Rover'). In this application the engine gained a reputation for very short service life and unreliability. This was caused by the significantly greater times spent at idle speed in the Black Cab than in the Land Rover. Solihull engineers had warned Carbodies, builders of the FX4R that this would cause problems as at idle speed the engine's oil pressure dropped, causing the automatic tensioner unit for the timing chain to not operate fully. At the high number of hours spent at idle speed (taxi drivers tended to leave the engines idling for long period whilst waiting for passengers or when off-duty as well as all the time spent in stationary traffic in London) this caused the timing chains to stretch, causing incorrect fuel <b>injection</b> <b>timing</b> which greatly reduced engine life. [...] The 10J engine was also adapted into a marine engine by Mercury of the USA and sold under the Mercruiser 165 name.|$|E

By regulating <b>injection</b> <b>timings</b> and proportions of DFI, the air-fuel mixture stratification was significantly improved and the expected lean burn was implemented. The experimental results showed that the reduction of fuel consumption with DFI could be above 10 per cent over quite a wide load range, compared to single fuel injection.

The mixture in the cylinder was divided into different regions that distribute spherically around the spark plug and consist of a central region of stoichiometric air-fuel mixture and a gradually leaner outside region.

40|$|The {{problem of}} {{designing}} robust and noise-insensitive PI controllers for pressure-sensor based combustion-timing control was studied through simulation. Different primary reference fuels (PRF) and operating conditions were studied. The simulations were done using a physics-based, control-oriented model with an empirical ignition-delay correlation. It {{was found that}} the controllable region, in-between the zero-gain region for early <b>injection</b> <b>timings</b> and the misfire region for late <b>injection</b> <b>timings</b> is strongly PRF dependent. As a result, it was necessary to adjust intake temperature to compensate for the difference in fuel reactivity prior to the controller design. With adjusted intake temperature, PRF dependent negative-temperature coefficient behavior gave different system characteristics for the different fuels. The PI-controller design was accomplished by solving the optimization problem of maximizing disturbance rejection and tracking performance subject to constraints on robustness and measurement-noise sensitivity. Optimal controller gains were found to be limited by the high system gain at late combustion timings and high-load conditions, furthermore, the measurement-noise sensitivity was found to be higher at the low-load operating points where the ignition delay is more sensitive to variations in load and intake-conditions. The controller-gain restrictions were found to vary for the different PRFs, the optimal gains for higher PRFs were lower due to a higher system gain, whereas the measurement-noise sensitivity was found to be higher for lower PRFs...|$|R
40|$|To run a Diesel {{engine in}} Homogeneous Charge Compression Ignition (HCCI) mode {{has proved to}} be a highly {{promising}} approach towards reduced engine-out emissions of NOx and particulate matter. A crucial issue when utilizing HCCI is the degree of charge homogeneity that is required to achieve the desired low temperature combustion. A very well mixed charge can be created through the use of traditional port injection. This approach would most often result in low emissions of NOx and soot. However, this strategy might also see a penalty in the form of high levels of unburned hydrocarbons due to incomplete combustion, especially under low load conditions. A proposed solution to this is to utilize stratified charge in the lower load range. The creation of a stratified charge imposes no major problems in modern DI engines. The important parameter is the degree of stratification that can be tolerated. If the charge gets too highly stratified, the combustion will become more diesel-like with dramatically increased levels of NOx and soot as a result. This paper presents simultaneous laser based measurements of formaldehyde and OH-radical distributions in an HCCI engine. Formaldehyde is formed as an intermediate species when combusting hydrocarbons. The formation occurs through low temperature reactions in an early phase of the combustion process. Later in the process formaldehyde is being consumed. Formaldehyde is, therefore, used as indicator of the first stage of combustion and a marker of zones with low-temperature reactions. The OH radical is formed as an intermediate during the high temperature reactions, and is used as a marker of zones where the combustion is ongoing. The purpose of the investigation was to study how the combustion process is affected by the change in homogeneity that arises from early and late injection, respectively. A 0. 5 liter single-cylinder optical engine equipped with a DI common rail fuel system was operated with a number of different <b>injection</b> <b>timings,</b> resulting in various levels of charge stratification. A blend of iso-octane and n-heptane was used as fuel. The measurement technique used was planar laser-induced fluorescence where formaldehyde was excited at 355 nm and OH at 283 nm. Two separate ICCD units were used to detect the resulting fluorescence from formaldehyde and OH. Measurement series covering the process from the start of injection until late in the expansion stroke is presented for different <b>injection</b> <b>timings</b> as well as pressure traces and emission analysis. A homogeneity index is calculated and used to compare the level of homogeneity resulting from <b>injection</b> <b>timings.</b> From early <b>injection</b> until about 50 CAD BTDC the time, between onset of low temperature reactions and start of the high temperature reactions, is long enough for the formaldehyde to form an almost homogeneous distribution before it is being consumed. For later <b>injection</b> <b>timings</b> the high temperature reactions starts before this mixing is completed and therefore the formaldehyde distribution is not longer homogeneous and the combustion is more diesel like...|$|R

Electrification offers a medium to long term solution, but there remains a need to significantly reduce internal combustion engine emissions in the short and medium term, and potentially {{in the long term}} for long range inter city transportation. Late injection low temperature combustion (LTC) has the potential to achieve ultra-low emissions levels in a compression ignition engine by increasing the lean pre-mixed burn fraction. However, significant quantities of diluent are normally required to achieve the required delay in ignition and pre-mixing to achieve LTC. This results in high boost requirements, increased pumping work and the complexity of the air handling system and potentially adversely impacting fuel economy.
