40|$|The {{goal of this}} {{research}} is to investigate the present situation for <b>front</b> <b>of</b> <b>pack</b> labeling in Korea and the perception of consumers for the new system of labeling, <b>front</b> <b>of</b> <b>pack</b> labeling, based on the consumer survey. We investigated the number of processed foods with <b>front</b> <b>of</b> <b>pack</b> labeling in one retailer in Youngin-si. And we also surveyed 1, 019 participants nationwide whose ages were from 20 to 49; the knowledge of nutrition labeling, the knowledge of ‘front of pack labeling’, and the opinion about the labeling system. The data were analyzed using SAS statistics program. The results were as follows: 13. 4 % of processed foods had <b>front</b> <b>of</b> <b>pack</b> labeling, and 16. 8 % of the consumers always checked the nutrition labeling, while 32. 7 % of the consumers seldom checked it. In addition, 44. 3 % of the consumers think that ‘front of pack labeling ’ is necessary, and 58. 3 % of the consumers {{think it is important to}} show the percentage of daily value as a way of ‘front of pack labeling’. However, 32 % of the consumer think the possibility of ‘front of pack labeling ’ is slim. Meanwhile, 58. 3 % of the consumers think that it is important to have the color difference according to contents. The number of favorite nutrients in the <b>front</b> <b>of</b> <b>pack</b> was four or five. It seems that the recognition of current nutrition labeling has the influence on the willingness of using the future ‘front of pack labeling’. Along with our study, the policy for ‘front of pack labeling ’ has to be updated and improved constantly since ‘front of pack labeling ’ helps consumer understand nutrition facts.

40|$|Encouraging {{people to}} make {{healthier}} food choices will make {{an important contribution to}} preventing non-communicable diseases. Most groceries purchased by UK households are from supermarkets, potentially making this an important setting where consumers might consider the nutritional quality of foods. While it is possible to purchase healthy food in supermarkets, the retail environment actively promotes the selection of less healthy items. Gaps remain in our understanding about which store based interventions - including providing on-pack nutrition information - can assist shoppers to make healthy food selections. Considerable evidence exists around consumer engagement with nutrition labelling, but there is a paucity of research conducted in real-life contexts. This thesis describes a qualitative study which explored factors which influence decision making at point-of-choice and sought to understand whether and how shoppers use the <b>front</b> <b>of</b> <b>pack</b> nutrition information panel during routine supermarket shopping. The study also investigated whether wearable cameras were useful research tools to understand how shoppers use the <b>front</b> <b>of</b> <b>pack</b> nutrition information panel, compared to a 'Think aloud' method. In this research, participants paid little attention to the <b>front</b> <b>of</b> <b>pack</b> nutrition information as they shopped. Food shopping was characterised as a complex, involved activity with priority given to a range of different issues over health and/or nutrition concerns. Although the <b>front</b> <b>of</b> <b>pack</b> nutrition information panel could offer support to shoppers, this study suggests that its presence is currently overwhelmed by commercially driven factors. Shoppers appear to need specific health or nutrition-related purchasing goals, be sufficiently informed and motivated to spend time attending to the <b>front</b> <b>of</b> <b>pack</b> nutrition information panel. Future interventions should raise awareness of the presence of nutrition information on pack and be clear about how this information can be used in different circumstances to guide consumers towards healthier choices. The study suggests that while data collected via 'Think aloud' or from viewing wearable camera images provides general information about food shopping decisions, eye-tracker technology can provide objective evidence of nutrition information use. Data capture was greatly strengthened by the use of a post-shop interview, where interviews generated specific and important contextual information relating {{to the use of the}} <b>front</b> <b>of</b> <b>pack</b> nutrition information panel. </p...|$|E

40|$|Background Evidence {{supporting}} {{the link between}} diet and health has prompted policy makers to develop nutrition related food labelling as an established communication medium of health messages. However, several studies have demonstrated the difficulty consumers face in understanding and using food labelling information. The recent introduction of <b>Front</b> <b>Of</b> <b>Pack</b> (FOP) labelling schemes, aim to aid consumers in making informed food choices. Whilst there has been substantial research on the perceived need of these systems, there is limited research on the impact they may be having to the consumer and how they may be affecting food choice. Purpose To develop an appreciation of consumers’ current attitudes to and understanding of food labelling, with particular reference to nutritional information. The study aims to assess if the <b>Front</b> <b>of</b> <b>Pack</b> voluntary nutritional labelling schemes are {{having an impact on}} consumer understanding of nutrition information and healthy food choice and if these labelling schemes are influencing food purchase decisions. Methods Participants were recruited from the general public. Four focus groups were conducted involving 22 people in total. Thematic analysis was used to analyse the data and build an understanding of consumer interest, perception knowledge and use of food labelling. Results Knowledge and understanding of food label varied across participant groups and within individuals. Use of FOP nutrition labels were used for one off meal purchases but rarely {{in the context of a}} whole diet. Consumers were generally confused and distrusting of the variety of different FOP nutrition labelling systems currently in use. Conclusions Individuals who have more of an interest in food labels and a belief in the ability of the information to aid food choice are more likely to use FOP labelling. FOP labelling improved general awareness of food and food choice, limited understanding shown of the relationship between food and health and the ability of FOP labelling to aid food choices that can be part of a healthy, balanced diet...|$|E

Plos One, 10 (10), 20. doi: 10. 1371 /journal. pone. 0139732 Background <b>Front</b> <b>of</b> <b>pack</b> (FOP) {{nutrition}} {{labels are}} concise labels {{located on the}} front of food packages that provide truncated nutrition information. These labels are rapidly gaining prominence worldwide, presumably because they attract attention and their simplified formats enable rapid comparisons of nutritional value. Methods Eye tracking was conducted as US consumers interacted with actual packages with and without FOP labels to (1) assess if the presence of an FOP label increases attention to nutrition information when viewers are not specifically tasked with nutrition-related goals; and (2) study the effect of FOP presence on consumer use of more comprehensive, traditional nutrition information presented in the Nutritional Facts Panel (NFP), a mandatory label for most packaged foods in the US. Results Our results indicate that colored FOP labels enhanced the probability that any nutrition information was attended, and resulted in faster detection and longer viewing of nutrition information. However, for cereal packages, these benefits were at the expense of attention to the more comprehensive NFP. Our results are consistent with a potential short cut effect of FOP labels, such that if an FOP was present, participants spent less time attending the more comprehensive NFP. For crackers, FOP labels increased time spent attending to nutrition information, but we found no evidence that their presence reduced the time spent on the nutrition information in the NFP. Conclusions The finding that FOP labels increased attention to overall nutrition information by people who did not have an explicit nutritional goal suggests that these labels may have an advantage in conveying nutrition information to a wide segment of the population. However, for some food types this benefit may come with a short-cut effect; that is, decreased attention to more comprehensive nutrition information. These results have implications for policy and warrant further research into the mechanisms by which FOP labels impact use of nutrition information by consumers for different foods...|$|E
40|$|Despite policy efforts, consumers' well-informed healthful {{choice is}} a challenge.

Further, one third of the products carried health benefit claim, one third taste benefit claim, and one third no additional claim FOP. Attention to information and its effect on experienced taste, health perception and the buying intention were measured. The results show that the message displayed FOP altered consumers evaluation and choice. The effectiveness of the FOP message further depended on consumers' health motivation and the healthfulness perception of carrier products. The outcomes are summarized in a framework of health-pleasure trade-off. Current findings call for the establishment of standards to avoid the use of misleading information FOP...|$|E

40|$|The {{variety and}} choice of {{packaged}} foods available in supermarkets is vast {{and it has}} become increasingly difficult to make healthy food choices. Knowing what nutrients are contained in foods is vital not just for those already diagnosed with high blood pressure, cardiovascular disease, cancer, obesity and diabetes but it as important for maintaining good health and preventing problems developing. Food labelling aims to deliver clear and informative general food and nutrition information on all packaged food products. Different countries across Europe use different food labelling systems. To standardise food labelling across Member States the European Commission has published a proposal for a Regulation on the provision of food information to consumers (i. e. the new food labelling regulation) on January 30 th 2008. A key component is to include proposals on nutrition labelling to provide information to consumers in a clear, consistent and evidence-based way to support health conscious food choices.

40|$|To {{identify}} the key determinants of consumer attention to nutrition labels, visual search tasks (present – absent; one – two targets) {{were used as}} an effective experimental tool. The main manipulation concerned: set size (number of labels on front of pack); label characteristics (display size, position of the label on frontof-pack, colour scheme); and familiarity with type of the label and its location on the <b>front</b> <b>of</b> <b>pack.</b> Attention capture was faster and more accurate when the label was present rather than absent, with doubled rather than standard display size, and with mono- rather than polychromatic colouring. There was performance benefit when the type of label and its location on the package did not change in two consecutive exposures, suggesting that nutrition logos should be printed in a consistent location on the package. The results confirm our hypotheses that display size, colour scheme, familiarity with the label and its location {{on the front of}} the pack are key determinants of consumer attention to labels. These findings are crucial to better understanding consumer attention to labels and thus the impact of nutrition information on healthy food choice...|$|E
40|$|This article {{describes}} an experiment {{to measure the}} impact of the Australasian “Health Star Rating” <b>front</b> <b>of</b> <b>pack</b> nutritional label system on consumer choice behaviour. This system presents a one-half to five star rating of nutritional quality via the front facings of food product packages. While this system has been recently rolled out across Australasia, no test of its impact on food choice has been conducted. A sample of 1200 consumers was recruited on exit from supermarkets in New Zealand. A 2 × 2 factorial design was used with two levels of cold cereal product nutritional status (high, five star/low, two star) and two levels of the Health Star Rating label (present/absent). The dependent variable was revealed choice behaviour. The results indicated that the presence of the label had a significant depressive effect on consumer preference, but that this impact was not moderated in any way by the nutritional status expressed by the label. The result represents a significant functional failure of the Health Star Rating label in this research environment. The nature of the failure is consistent with the consumers processing the label {{in much the same way}} as the nominal brand cues that dominate the retail food packaging...|$|E

40|$|Many {{countries}} are now permitting health claims on foods and Food Standards Australia New Zealand is developing new regulations to permit {{their use in}} Australia. However {{there is no clear}} understanding of how consumers use health claims and their likely impact on consumer food behaviour or health. More research is needed, but a review of previous studies allows some common conclusions can be drawn. Health claims on foods are seen by consumers as useful, and when a product features a health claim they view it as healthier and state {{they are more likely to}} purchase it. Consumers are sceptical of health claims from food companies and strongly agree that they should be approved by government. Consumers do not make clear distinctions between nutrition content claims, structure-function claims and health claims. Consumers generally don’t like long and complex, scientifically worded claims on foods; they prefer split claims – with a short succinct statement of the claim on the <b>front</b> <b>of</b> <b>pack</b> and more detail provided elsewhere. At present about 8 % of Australian products carry a health or related claim, a level not much less than in the US, where more high-level claims are permitted. It may be that manufacturers will continue to prefer to use nutrient content or structure function claims in Australia and New Zealand, which will be easier to substantiate and more consumer-friendly than high-level disease-related health claims...|$|E

The overall aim of this study was to determine Irish consumer’s perceptions of beef eating quality and to use this information as a basis for the development of a total quality management system for the production of consistent eating quality which can be easily and accurately identified in a retail situation. In order to do this it is important to gain insight in to consumer’s perception of beef quality. Consumers (n = 780) participated in sensory panels which were carried out according to the Meat Standards Australia guidelines. They consumed and evaluated 7 beef pieces of varying quality and cut. Each piece was scored on a scale of 1 to 100 for four palatability attributes and ranked as either unsatisfactory, good everyday eating quality, better than everyday eating quality or premium quality. Mean palatability scores increased significantly (P< 0. 001) with increasing quality from unsatisfactory to premium. Consumers were able to differentiate between cuts, 38 % of consumers ranked fillet as premium quality whereas 4 % ranked topside as premium quality.

However, consumer perception of the HSR {{is yet to be}} investigated. Therefore, the aim of this qualitative study was to explore perceptions of the HSR through focus group discussions. A purposive sample of Australian grocery shoppers (n = 15) was recruited using supermarket intercept. Four focus groups were held between January and August 2015. Seven overarching themes emerged from thematic analysis of the data. The primary theme was related to a general lack of trust in the HSR due to incongruence between the perceived healthiness of food products and the ratings, which was related to the lack of transparency in the criteria used to determine the number of stars. Ratings on highly processed foods were widely seen as being too high, which was suggested to encourage consumption of these products. There was greater trust in the nutrient information panel due to familiarity. There was a general feeling that an absence of negative imagery would limit the dissuasive impact that the HSR has for lower rated foods. In contrast, the HSR was predicted to be useful for ‘at-aglance’ comparisons across similar products due to its easily understood, familiar interpretive design. The {{results of this study suggest}} that consumers require increased transparency in the governance, function and ratings calculation of the HSR.
