500|$|Despite {{his many}} heroics, Sparrow is a pirate and a morally {{ambiguous}} character. When agreeing to trade 100 souls, including Will, to Davy Jones {{in exchange for}} his freedom, Jones asks Sparrow whether he can, [...] "condemn an innocent man—a friend—to a lifetime of servitude <b>in</b> <b>your</b> <b>name</b> while you roam free?" [...] After a hesitation Sparrow merrily replies, [...] "Yep! I'm good with it!" [...] He carelessly runs up debts with Anamaria, Davy Jones, and the other pirate lords. Sao Feng, pirate lord of Singapore, is particularly hateful towards him. In a cowardly moment, Sparrow abandons his crew during the Kraken's attack, but underlying loyalty and morality compel him to return and save them. Sparrow claims to be a man of his word, and expresses surprise that people doubt his truthfulness; there is no murder on his criminal record.|$|E
