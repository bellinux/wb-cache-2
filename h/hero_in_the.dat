5|$|He did not {{immediately}} join the Communist Party after the consolidation of the October Revolution, becoming a member only in 1941, a move atypical for a Soviet military officer. After the war, {{he served as a}} deputy member of the Supreme Soviets of the Latvian Soviet Socialist Republic and Armenian Soviet Socialist Republic and was a regular attendee of the Party Congresses. In 1952, he became a candidate for entry into the Central Committee and, in 1961, was inducted as a full member. For his contributions during the war, he was widely regarded as a national <b>hero</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Soviet Union, and continues to hold such esteemed status among Armenians.|$|E

Ortiz had two sons he had been using for waste collection and five daughters he had been committing incest with. Bilheimer accompanies IJM representatives Pablo Villeda, Amy Roth, and Gary Haugen as they and the local police arrest Ortiz; he is charged with exploitation of children and violence against women. Ortiz looks surprised as he is handcuffed. Haugen, President of IJM, went on to be named a Trafficking in Persons (TIP) <b>Hero</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> 2012 US DoS TIP Report.|$|E
5|$|Orion served several {{roles in}} ancient Greek culture. The {{story of the}} adventures of Orion, the hunter, is the one on which {{we have the most}} {{evidence}} (and even on that not very much); he is also the personification of the constellation of the same name; he was venerated as a <b>hero,</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Greek sense, in the region of Boeotia; and there is one etiological passage which says that Orion was responsible for the present shape of the Strait of Sicily.|$|E
5|$|Punk's matches with Cabana led him {{to being}} hired by the Ring of Honor promotion. From February 2003 until May 2004, Punk refused to wrestle for IWA Mid-South, {{explaining}} this as a protest to Ian Rotten's mistreatment of Chris <b>Hero</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> company. Hero, however, has stated he believes there were other reasons, and Rotten's treatment of him was just an excuse by Punk to stop working for the company. Eventually Punk returned to IWA Mid-South and continued to perform as a wrestler and commentator for them until 2005 when he was signed to World Wrestling Entertainment. His last appearance in IWA Mid-South was on July 2, 2005 in which he competed in a 60-minute time limit draw against Delirious.|$|E

5|$|Toward {{the end of}} September 1941, Sorge {{transmitted}} information that Japan would not initiate hostilities against the USSR in the East, thereby freeing Red Army divisions stationed in Siberia for the defence of Moscow. In October 1941 Sorge was unmasked and arrested by the Japanese. Apparently, he was entirely trusted by the German ambassador Eugen Ott, and was allowed access to top secret cables from Berlin in the embassy in Tokyo. Eventually, this involvement would lead to Heinrich Georg Stahmer replacing Ott in January 1943. Sorge {{on the other hand}} would be executed in November 1944 and elevated to a national <b>hero</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Soviet Union.|$|E
5|$|Alexander's legacy {{includes}} the cultural diffusion and syncretism which his conquests engendered, such as Greco-Buddhism. He founded some twenty cities that bore his name, most notably Alexandria in Egypt. Alexander's settlement of Greek colonists {{and the resulting}} spread of Greek culture in the east resulted in a new Hellenistic civilization, aspects of which were still evident in {{the traditions of the}} Byzantine Empire in the mid-15th century AD and the presence of Greek speakers in central and far eastern Anatolia until the 1920s. Alexander became legendary as a classical <b>hero</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> mold of Achilles, and he features prominently in the history and mythic traditions of both Greek and non-Greek cultures. He became the measure against which military leaders compared themselves, and military academies throughout the world still teach his tactics. He is often ranked among the most influential people in history.|$|E
5|$|Belgicas voyage {{marked the}} {{beginning}} of {{what became known as the}} Heroic Age of Antarctic Exploration, and was rapidly followed by expeditions from the United Kingdom, Sweden, Germany and France. However, on his return to Norway in 1899, Amundsen turned his attention northwards. Confident in his abilities to lead an expedition, he planned a traversal of the Northwest Passage, the then-uncharted sea route from the Atlantic to the Pacific through the labyrinth of north Canadian islands. Having earned his master's ticket, Amundsen acquired a small sloop, Gj√∏a, which he adapted for Arctic travel. He secured the patronage of King Oscar of Sweden and Norway, the support of Nansen, and sufficient financial backing to set out in June 1903 with a crew of six. The voyage lasted until 1906 and was wholly successful; the Northwest Passage, which defeated mariners for centuries, was finally conquered. At the age of 34 Amundsen became a national <b>hero,</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> first rank of polar explorers.|$|E

5|$|In 1707, Zahir was {{involved}} in a brawl in Tiberias in which he killed a man. As a result, Sa'd opted to move the family to Arraba after being offered safe haven there by the Bani Saqr tribe. In Arraba, Zahir received a degree of formal education from a certain Muslim scholar, Abd al-Qadir al-Hifnawi. During his youth, Zahir also learned how to hunt and fight. When the village of Bi'ina was attacked by forces dispatched by the governor of Sidon Eyalet sometime between 1713 and 1718, Zahir {{played an important role in}} defending the village and managed to evade the governor's troops. According to chroniclers of the time, this event, along with Zahir's moderation, turned Zahir into a folk <b>hero</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> area. His martial talents gained him further respect among the local peasantry throughout the 1720s.|$|E
5|$|In 1963, Egyptian {{director}} Youssef Chahine {{produced the}} film El Nasser Salah El Dine ("Saladin The Victorious"), which intentionally drew parallels between Saladin, considered a <b>hero</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Arab world, and Nasser and his pan-Arabist policies. Nasser {{is played by}} Ahmed Zaki in Mohamed Fadel's 1996 Nasser 56. The film set the Egyptian box office record at the time, and focused on Nasser during the Suez Crisis. It is also considered a milestone in Egyptian and Arab cinema as the first film to dramatize {{the role of a}} modern-day Arab leader. Together with the 1999 Syrian biopic Gamal Abdel Nasser, the films marked the first biographical movies about contemporary public figures produced in the Arab world. He is portrayed by Amir Boutrous in the Netflix television series The Crown.|$|E
5|$|In 1984, Auerbach relinquished {{his general}} {{managing}} duties and became president and later vice-chairman of the Boston Celtics. In a surprising move after winning their 15th title, he traded popular guard Gerald Henderson, the game 2 <b>hero</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> finals against the Lakers, for Seattle's first round draft pick in 1986. Two years later, after the Celtics defeated Houston {{in the finals}} for their 16th championship, he used the second overall pick in the 1986 draft, the pick acquired from Seattle, to take college prodigy Len Bias from Maryland, arguably the most brilliant coup in Auerbach's stellar career. With the team's star players still in their prime, the defending champions appeared set to compete at the top for years. However, tragedy struck just two days later, when Bias died of a cocaine overdose. Several years later, Celtics star player Reggie Lewis died suddenly in 1993, and without any league compensation for either loss, the team fell into decline, not seeing another Finals in Auerbach's lifetime.|$|E

5|$|On {{the night}} of 10 March 1826 {{and in the midst}} of the siege of Sacramento, Joaquim In√°cio boarded a small, unarmed boat {{accompanied}} by a single army officer and passed unnoticed through a line of nineteen enemy ships under cover of darkness. He reached the main Brazilian fleet on the morning of the next day and requested assistance from Vice-Admiral Rodrigo Jos√© Ferreira Lobo, the commander-in-chief of the naval forces operating in the war. Joaquim In√°cio returned to Sacramento two days later under heavy enemy fire along with three boats carrying supplies and arms. Although welcomed as a <b>hero</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> besieged town, he was passed over for a promotion. Disregard for this achievement was due to his lack of wealth and family connections, a burden which continued to thwart his career for years to come.|$|E
