5|$|Plans for a {{realignment}} of the Glaven channel {{meant that}} the Eye would be left unprotected {{to the north of}} the river, and would eventually be destroyed by coastal change. It was decided that the only practical course of action was to investigate the site while it still existed, and a preliminary evaluation was carried out in 2003 as preparation for a full survey in 2004–05. The surveyed area covered 10ha (25acre), significantly more than the 0.4ha (1acre) of the 1998 investigations. 50 trenches were excavated in a <b>herringbone</b> pattern outside the buildings, each 50m long and 1.80m wide (194 by 5.9ft), and six trenches of varying dimensions were created inside the chapel. The latter equated in total area to two of the standard trenches. The geology was investigated with eight boreholes, and geophysics (magnetometry and metal detection) were used to locate subsurface anomalies.|$|E
5|$|While {{only a few}} {{artifacts}} were recovered, historians {{said the}} dig offered a clearer view of early 19th-century life at Colross. Discoveries included an underground domed brick cistern {{that served as a}} water purification system and evidence that slaves lived in outbuildings on the Colross estate. Archaeologists also discovered the mansion's original basement floor, which was laid in a <b>herringbone</b> bond. Evidence of the estate's exterior walls, the foundations of the smokehouse, stables, and a burial vault were also unearthed. In the northwestern portion of the property, what is thought to have been the foundation of a rectangular burial vault was found. No burial remains were discovered. All interments were presumably removed in the early 20th century. Thomson Francis Mason was originally interred at the Colross graveyard in 1838, as were two of his daughters. Subsequent residents had their remains reinterred at Christ Church Episcopal Cemetery in Alexandria. According to the Alexandria Economic Development Partnership, the delay in construiction caused 79 condominium buyers to abandon their purchases.|$|E

40|$|The {{objective}} of this work is to study experimentally and theoretically novel multiphase microreactors and characterize them in relation to hydrodynamics and mass transfer, in order to evaluate, understand and improve their performance. In order to achieve this CO 2 absorption in sodium hydroxide and amine solutions {{an example of a}} fast gas-liquid reaction has been investigated in a single microstructured metallic mesh reactor, CRL reactor, PTFE single channel membrane reactor and the silicon nitride mesh reactor. CO 2 absorption in sodium hydroxide solution was initially studied experimentally and theoretically in a metal microstructured mesh reactor. The differential mass balances to describe the concentration profiles of components in the three domains (gas/membrane/liquid), were solved with Comsol Multiphysics (modeling software for finite element analysis of partial differential equations). The model indicated that the carbon dioxide is consumed within few microns from the gas – liquid interface, and the dominant resistance for mass transfer is located in the mesh because it is wetted by the liquid reactant. In order to overcome the limitation of the extra resistance to the mass transfer in the metallic mesh, PTFE membranes were used in the single channel reactor, which are considered as hydrophobic to aqueous solutions of NaOH and amines. Monoethanolamine solution (MEA) absorbed more CO 2 than diethanolamine (DEA) since the reaction rate constant for MEA is higher than DEA. 8 channel (PTFE) microreactor showed much higher CO 2 removal efficiency than the metallic mesh microreactor. Furthermore the model indicated partial-wetting of the PTFE membrane when NaOH solution was used as an absorbent. In order to enhance mass transfer staggered <b>herringbones</b> were used {{on the floor of the}} liquid side of the single channel PTFE microreactor. No enhancement of mass transfer was observed with the use of staggered <b>herringbones.</b> A possible reason for that is that a limit for the fast second-order reaction is reached for enhancement and that the apparent reaction rate is independent from mass transfer for our case, or that the <b>herringbones</b> are far away from the reaction zone and cannot create the appropriate stirring for enhancement. In order to increase throughput, carbon dioxide absorption in sodium hydroxide solution was performed in the metallic mesh ‘scale-out’ reactor (with 4 meshes). CO 2 removal efficiency for the ‘scale-out’ reactor was significantly lower than the single mesh reactor, which is probably due to breakthrough of liquid in the gas phase (stagnant liquid) or uneven flow distribution in each plate of the ‘scale-out’ reactor. Finally a silicon nitride mesh reactor developed by Bayer Technology Services and FluXXion was used for CO 2 absorption in aqueous solutions of NaOH and DEA. The silicon nitride mesh reactor showed better performance than the PTFE single channel reactor, the metallic 8 channel reactor and the CRL mesh reactor when NaOH was used, due to the very thin membrane of 1 μm thickness, which makes the resistance to mass transfer very small...|$|R

40|$|The {{usefulness}} of electromagnetic (EM) methods for mineral exploration is severely restricted {{by the presence}} of a conductive overburden. Approximately 80 % of the Australian continent is covered by regolith that contains some of the most conductive clays on Earth. As a result, frequency-domain methods are only effective for near surface investigations and time-domain methods, that are capable of deeper exploration, require the measurement of very small, late-time signals. Both methods suffer {{from the fact that the}} currents in the conductive Earth layers contribute a large portion of the total measured signal that may mask the signal from a conductive target. In the search for non-layered structures, this form of geological noise is the greatest impediment to the success of EM surveys in conductive terrains. Over the years a range of data acquisition and processing techniques have been used in an effort to enhance the response of the non-layered target and thereby increase the likelihood of its detection. The combined use of a variety of survey configurations to assist exploration and interpretation is not new and is practiced regularly. The active nature of EM exploration means that the measured response is determined to a large degree by the way in which the Earth is energised. Geological structures produce different responses to different stimuli. In this work, two new methods of data combination are used to transform the measured data into a residual quantity that enhances the signature of non-layered geological structures. Based on the concept of data redundancy and tested using the results of numerical modelling, the new combinations greatly increase the signal to noise ratio for targets located in a conductive environment by reducing the layered Earth contribution. The data combinations have application to frequency-domain and time-domain EM surveys and simple ++interpretive rules can be applied to the residuals to extract geological parameters useful in exploration. The new methods make use of inductive loop sources and can therefore also be applied to airborne surveys. Airborne surveys present special difficulties due to the data acquisition procedures commonly used. Flight-line related artefacts such as <b>herringbones</b> detract from the appearance of maps and make boundary definition more difficult. A new procedure, based on the Radon transform, is used to remove <b>herringbones</b> from airborne EM maps and locate the conductive boundaries correctly, making interpretation more reliable and easier. In addition, selective filtering of the Radon transform data enables the enhancement or attenuation of specific linear features shown in the map to emphasise features of interest. Comparison of the Radon transform procedures with the more conventional Fourier transform methods shaves the Radon transform processing to be more versatile and less prone to distortion of the features in a map. The procedures developed in this work are applied to field data with good results...|$|R
40|$|Dashing Tweeds is a {{woven textile}} and {{menswear}} brand {{set up in}} 2006; its philosophy based on the reinvention of tweeds, suitings and traditional luxury woollen fabrics for fashion. Fabrics are sold by the metre or bespoke designed. The company takes inspiration from the functional and aesthetic heritage of traditional British wool whilst embracing innovation in luxury textiles. Early Burberry and McIntosh are inspirational in their adoption of fabric innovation in conjunction with classic British design. The company {{is dedicated to the}} evolution of traditional aesthetics and production methods. It embraces the links between heritage and contemporary design innovation in the form of hardwearing, functional, luxury products. This paper will focus on international client case studies that have chosen to work with Dashing Tweeds, exploring the market demand and desire for UK produced heritage inspired, innovative products in luxury menswear. Tweed is a traditional British woollen fabric woven in variations of a twill structure from rough spun blended wool, traditionally used for outdoor activities such as fishing and hunting due to its moisture resistance and durability. Harris Tweed has been hand woven in the Western Isles for many years and is synonymous with British textiles. This method of hand production, high quality materials and durability seals its status as a luxury fabric {{in the context of the}} current fast moving fashion cycle. It is imbued with the emotive notion of the landscape and culture which inspires it. It evokes a response in menswear that appeals to memory and nostalgia of less ephemeral and disposable fashion. Much of its appeal is bound up in its association with home spun production, ‘authenticity’, melange of colour and functionality. Dashing tweeds combines the heritage of tweed and the use of technical yarn to produce fabrics which have a sense of tradition with an innovative function. Fine reflective filaments are woven into woollen suiting using a variety of new and traditional structures that allude to the tweed aesthetic. A current project is exploring the use of carbon nanotube/polymer composites imbedded in wool textiles with a view to creating fabrics that are recognisable as tweed but possesses hidden function. Designs are based around traditional checks, twills and <b>herringbones.</b> Colour inspiration comes from the surrounding changing environment, much in the same way as traditional tweeds were inspired by the landscape of rural Scotland and Ireland. Dashing Tweeds colour comes from the urban environment of double yellow lines, wet pavements and the parks and architecture of London. Dashing Tweeds appeals to a menswear market that doesn’t want an obviously innovative looking aesthetic but enjoys the technical aspect through hidden innovation in a heritage inspired textile. Through analysing the relationship between Dashing Tweeds and their client base, the paper will address market demand and relevance of such a company and discuss the importance of heritage inspired cloth, innovation in materials and sustainable production to the brand strategy and future of Dashing Tweeds and their clients.

40|$|Pattern formation, i. e. {{the outcome}} of self-organization, has fascinated {{scientists}} for centuries. A large effort was devoted to understand the formation of regular patterns in dissipative structures. More recently, it appears that self-organized structures could also be achieved near equilibrium. There is {{a great variety of}} physical and chemical systems that, near equilibrium, exhibit periodic patterns. For instance, stripes or bubbles could be observed in thin films of magnetic garnet, superconducting materials, block copolymers, liquid crystals, phospholipids, and ferrofluids. Wrinkling instability of compressed rigid membranes on soft elastic substrates leads also to the formation of periodic patterns near equilibrium. Since the seminal paper of Bowden et al. (Nature 1998), various systems were proposed to generate nano- and micrometric wrinkles via the application of compressive stresses to multilayers. In addition to its purely fundamental interest, these instabilities also offer a new route to build in a simple, cost-effective, and well-defined way nano- and microstructured surfaces without the use of the traditional, robust techniques developed in the microelectronics industry. In this thesis, we develop a new system, metal-polymer-substrate trilayers, that exhibit wrinkling when heated above the glass transition temperature of the polymer. We explain in detail the mechanism at the origin of wrinkling and expand existing models to obtain a complete description of the relevant parameters that govern both the amplitude and the wavelength of the obtained pattern. In light of this, we show that by playing with the rheological properties of the polymer we are able to control precisely the geometry of the wrinkles. Furthermore, to generate surfaces with a tailor-made buckling pattern, we develop an original variant of the experiments. We tune the boundary conditions at the polymer-substrate interface by chemically patterning the substrates with regions of high and low adhesion. In this way, we obtain patterns with wrinkles being oriented differently above the sticky and the slippery regions. This last result is very surprising since it seems, at first sight, unrealistic to imagine that the chemical nature of the substrate could affect the elastic instability of the skin through a micron-thick polymer film. To explore wrinkled patterns with complex morphologies, we couple the wrinkling instability with solvent diffusion. Molecular diffusion in the polymer layer triggers the transition from an unwrinkled to a wrinkled state, provided that stimuloresponsive mutlilayers are used. The wrinkled pattern obtained is determined by the geometry of the diffusion process. To understand this surprising observation, we explain in detail how the scalar field related to the solvent concentration affects so strongly the elastic instabilities usually determined by the tensorial stress field. This mechanism allows us thus to grant exotic stress distributions which lead to very intriguing patterns (e. g. parallel or radial folds, <b>herringbones).</b> Interestingly, we find that under specific conditions, a hierarchical wrinkled morphology, i. e. pattern of wrinkles branching into generations of ever-higher folds, develops. We study other manifestations of hierarchical structures existing around us. In this frame, we derive a general concept that a plate constrained at one edge (with a fixed wavelength) but free at the opposite one evolves naturally to larger wavelengths to minimize its bending energy. We show theoretically that the evolution results from a compromise between the gain in bending energy and the energetic penalties related to the change of wavelength. We demonstrate the universality of these concepts by showing that our commonplace suspended curtain behaves like nanometer-thick polystyrene films deposited on water and further compressed. We close this thesis by making a short review of the main applications related to wrinkling that are already described in literature and develop in detail one of them, the use of wrinkling to investigate cell contact guidance.
