5|$|Additionally, {{the award}} system from Corruption was {{incorporated}} into the first two games. Players earn credits by accomplishing certain tasks, allowing them to unlock in-game items such as artwork, music, a screenshot feature, decorative items for Samus' ship in Corruption and the Fusion Suit in Prime, in which the latter was previously unlocked by connecting the Game Boy Advance title Metroid Fusion to the game. Credits could also be shared with registered Wii friends, who also <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>copy</b> of Trilogy, via WiiConnect24 which used the Wii's own 16-digit number {{as opposed to a}} separate Friend Code. Save files from the original version of Corruption cannot be transferred to the Trilogy version due to changes made to the source code. Trilogy also features the multiplayer mode from Echoes, but is limited to a local four-player game and does not feature online play, which is faithful to the original. In response to complaints from players and critics about Echoess high difficulty during some of the boss battles, the difficulty of the encounters was lowered.|$|E
5|$|On {{board the}} Normandy, Tali is {{initially}} {{excited to be}} there, intrigued by the advanced technology used to power the Normandy, and stays in the engine room as a result. The next time Shepard speaks to her, though, Tali now seems saddened and withdrawn. She tells Shepard that she's losing sleep, since the Normandy's engines run so quietly compared to ships in her home flotilla, where quiet ships indicate a bad engine or a malfunctioning air filter, plus the ship, due to how it's spread out, seems emptier. This results in Tali feeling slightly homesick and she ponders if the true purpose of the Pilgrimage is to remind her people what they still have. The next time Shepard speaks to her, Tali's spirits are back up, having adjusted to living on the Normandy, plus how the crew has been treating her like one of their own, especially Shepard. She thanks Shepard for this, saying that Quarians are treated as second-class citizens by other races and Shepard {{is the first to}} treat her as an equal. If the player completes a particular side-mission involving the geth and then speak to Tali afterwards, she will ask if she can <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>copy</b> of the geth data that Shepard recovered, explaining that it is exactly what she needs to complete her Pilgrimage. If the player allows her to <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>copy,</b> Tali is overly happy, promising to pay back Shepard by helping them defeat Saren. If the player declines, Tali will still promise to stay to fight Saren, but will then leave afterwards so she can finish her Pilgrimage.|$|E
5|$|The design {{specifications}} were completed in February 1945, and contracts were let {{to build the}} components. Three different plants were used {{so that no one}} would <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>copy</b> of the complete design. The gun and breech were made by the Naval Gun Factory in Washington, D.C.; the target case and some other components were by the Naval Ordnance Plant in Center Line, Michigan; and the tail fairing and mounting brackets by the Expert Tool and Die Company in Detroit, Michigan. The bomb, except for the uranium payload, was ready at the beginning of May 1945. The uranium-235 projectile was completed on 15 June, and the target on 24 July. The target and bomb pre-assemblies (partly assembled bombs without the fissile components) left Hunters Point Naval Shipyard, California, on 16 July aboard the heavy cruiser , arriving on 26 July. The target inserts followed by air on 30 July.|$|E

25|$|Adrenoleukodystrophy, a {{rare and}} fatal {{disorder}} that is carried by the mother on the x-cell. It affects only boys {{between the ages of}} 5 and 10 and destroys the protective cell surrounding the nerves, myelin, in the brain. The female carrier hardly shows any symptoms because females <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>copy</b> of the x-cell. This disorder causes a once healthy boy to lose all abilities to walk, talk, see, hear, and even swallow. Within 2 years after diagnosis, most boys with Adrenoleukodystrophy die.|$|E

25|$|The early Christians {{had no way}} to <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>copy</b> of {{the works}} that later became the canon and other church works {{accepted}} but not canonized. Much of the original church liturgical services functioned as a means of learning these works. Orthodox Church services today continue to serve this educational function. The issue of collecting the various works of the eastern churches and compiling them into a canon, each being confirmed as authentic text was a long protracted process. Much of this process was motivated by a need to address various heresies. In many instances, heretical groups had themselves begun compiling and disseminating text that they used to validate their positions, positions that were not consistent with the text, history and traditions of the Orthodox faith.|$|E
25|$|On June 16, 2009, The New York Times {{reported}} that Sosa supposedly {{was on a}} list of players who tested positive for performance-enhancing drugs in 2003, including Sosa in baseball's steroids scandal. The paper did not identify the drug nor the source of the information. Sosa's agent, Adam Katz, told The Associated Press he had no comment on the report. Rich Levin, commissioner Bud Selig's office spokesman, {{declined to comment on the}} situation, claiming that MLB did not <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>copy</b> of the test results. Michael Weiner, the union general counsel, also declined comment. The union, while fighting to get the list back from the government, has mostly refused to discuss reports. Likewise, Sosa never admitted to using performance-enhancing drugs nor did he ever fail an MLB drug test throughout his professional career.|$|E

500|$|Little Boy was {{developed}} by Lieutenant Commander Francis Birch's group of Captain William S. Parsons's Ordnance (O) Division at the Manhattan Project's Los Alamos Laboratory during World War II. Parsons flew on the Hiroshima mission as weaponeer. The Little Boy was a development of the unsuccessful Thin Man nuclear bomb. Like Thin Man, it was a gun-type fission weapon, but derived its explosive power from the nuclear fission of uranium-235, whereas Thin Man was based on fission of plutonium-239. Fission was accomplished by shooting a hollow cylinder of enriched uranium (the [...] "bullet") onto a solid cylinder of the same material (the [...] "target") {{by means of a}} charge of nitrocellulose propellant powder. It contained [...] of enriched uranium, of which less than a kilogram underwent nuclear fission. Its components were fabricated at three different plants so that no one would <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>copy</b> of the complete design.|$|E
500|$|There {{have been}} {{attempts}} by several artists to play cover versions of songs from Tago Mago. The Flaming Lips album In a Priest Driven Ambulance contains {{a song called}} [...] "Take Meta Mars", which was an attempt at covering the song [...] "Mushroom". However, the band members had only heard the song once and didn't <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>copy</b> {{of it at the}} time, so the song is only similar-sounding and not a proper cover. The Jesus and Mary Chain have covered the song more faithfully to the original; it was performed live and included on the CD version of Barbed Wire Kisses. British band The Fall recorded a song indebted to the Tago Mago track [...] "Oh Yeah" [...] entitled [...] "I Am Damo Suzuki", named after the Can singer, on their seminal 1985 LP This Nation's Saving Grace. New York band The Mooney Suzuki were named after Can vocalists Malcolm Mooney and Damo Suzuki.|$|E
500|$|Two {{types of}} gun design were produced: Type A was of high alloy steel, and Type B of more {{ordinary}} steel. Type B {{was chosen for}} production because it was lighter. The primers and propellant {{were the same as}} those previously chosen for Thin Man. Scale test firing of the hollow projectile and target insert was conducted with the 3-inch/50 caliber gun and a [...] Hispano cannon. Starting in December, test firing was done full-scale. Amazingly, the first test case produced {{turned out to be the}} best ever made. It was used in four test firings at the Anchor Ranch, and ultimately in the Little Boy used in the bombing of Hiroshima. The design specifications were completed in February 1945, and contracts were let to build the components. Three different plants were used so that no one would <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>copy</b> of the complete design. The gun and breech were made by the Naval Gun Factory in Washington, D.C.; the target, case and some other components were by the Naval Ordnance Plant in Center Line, Michigan; and the tail fairing and mounting brackets by the Expert Tool and Die Company in Detroit, Michigan.|$|E

500|$|Retrospective reviews on Impossible Princess—both from European and Australasian areas—have {{been much}} more positive, with AllMusic's Chris True {{labelling}} it a [...] "pretty damn good record", and openly criticised the critical reception around the album's early release, deeming it a [...] "shame". Nevertheless, he believed that [...] "Unlike Minogue's early work, this album sounds stronger and has a more natural feel. Her songwriting abilities {{have come a long}} way, and Impossible Princess actually flows together as an album." [...] Slant Magazine editor Sal Cinquemani awarded it four stars, and was impressed with the album's [...] "starkly personal and unified cord", saying it [...] "is the work of an artist willing to take risks, not a pop queen concerned with preserving her reign." [...] Cinquemani added it to the staff choices of their Vital Pop: 50 Essential Pop Albums lists. Awarding four stars, Nick Levine from British tabloid Digital Spy commended the mixture of genres and Minogue's input. Although he noticed the material's lack of commercial appeal, he concluded, [...] "Brave, revealing and rarely less than surprising, it's a key piece in the trickier-than-you-think jigsaw puzzle that is Kylie Minogue's recording career." [...] While reviewing her tenth album X (2007), Evan Sawdey from PopMatters commented [...] "For those who still <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>copy</b> of her Manic Street Preachers-assisted Impossible Princess, then you have one of the most crazed, damn-near perfect dance-pop albums ever created." ...|$|E
500|$|Chao {{have also}} {{appeared}} in the series as minor characters and gameplay elements. Two Chao—one Normal and one Dark—who drive Chao-styled mechas are playable characters in the two-player battle mode of Sonic Adventure 2: Battle. On the Sonic the Hedgehog-styled pinball board in Sonic Pinball Party, one of the player's objectives is to hatch several Chao eggs. Each world in the 2004 GBA game Sonic Advance 3 features Chao-inspired minigames to earn extra lives for the player, and a sidequest that involves finding Chao to obtain Chaos Emeralds. 2007's PlayStation Portable installment Sonic Rivals 2 hides Chao throughout levels {{to be found in}} a free play mode. In the 2008 Nintendo DS role-playing game , Chao eggs are hidden throughout the in-game universe for the player to find and hatch. The resulting infant Chao can be equipped to characters. This affects the characters' performance in battle; for example, one kind will increase the character's hit points. The game features a multiplayer mode in which Chao can be traded between players who each <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>copy</b> of the game. Chao take the form of an item in the [...] "Panel Flip" [...] party game of the 2009 Wii and DS game Mario & Sonic at the Olympic Winter Games. Each player's object is to claim as many panels as possible in a six-by-six grid; finding a Chao upon flipping a panel claims all panels in a given row or column for the player. One mission in Sonic Generations (2011) involves racing against Cream the Rabbit to collect lost Chao in a city location.|$|E
