5|$|A Markov {{chain is}} a type of Markov process that has either <b>discrete</b> state space or <b>discrete</b> index set (often {{representing}} time), but the precise definition of a Markov chain varies. For example, it is common to define a Markov chain as a Markov process in either <b>discrete</b> or continuous time with a countable state space (thus regardless of the nature of time), but it is also common to define a Markov chain as having <b>discrete</b> time in either countable or continuous state space (thus regardless of the state space).|$|E
5|$|Fourier {{series are}} used to solve {{boundary}} value problems in partial differential equations. In 1822, Fourier first used this technique to solve the heat equation. A <b>discrete</b> version of the Fourier series {{can be used in}} sampling applications where the function value is known only at a finite number of equally spaced points. In this case the Fourier series is finite and its value is equal to the sampled values at all points. The set of coefficients is known as the <b>discrete</b> Fourier transform (DFT) of the given sample sequence. The DFT {{is one of the key}} tools of digital signal processing, a field whose applications include radar, speech encoding, image compression. The JPEG image format is an application of the closely related <b>discrete</b> cosine transform.|$|E

25|$|In applied mathematics, <b>discrete</b> {{modelling}} is the <b>discrete</b> analogue {{of continuous}} modelling. In <b>discrete</b> modelling, <b>discrete</b> formulae are fit to data. A common method {{in this form}} of modelling is to use recurrence relation.|$|E
25|$|<b>Discrete</b> {{geometry}} and combinatorial geometry are about combinatorial properties of <b>discrete</b> collections of geometrical objects. A long-standing topic in <b>discrete</b> geometry is tiling of the plane. Computational geometry applies algorithms to geometrical problems.|$|E
25|$|Algebraic {{structures}} {{occur as}} both <b>discrete</b> examples and continuous examples. <b>Discrete</b> algebras include: boolean algebra used in logic gates and programming; relational algebra used in databases; <b>discrete</b> and finite versions of groups, rings and fields {{are important in}} algebraic coding theory; <b>discrete</b> semigroups and monoids appear {{in the theory of}} formal languages.|$|E
25|$|As {{well as for}} <b>discrete</b> events, {{there are}} Petri nets for {{continuous}} and hybrid discrete-continuous processes that are useful in <b>discrete,</b> continuous and hybrid control theory, and related to <b>discrete,</b> continuous and hybrid automata.|$|E
25|$|Research in <b>discrete</b> {{mathematics}} {{increased in}} the latter half of the twentieth century partly due to the development of digital computers which operate in <b>discrete</b> steps and store data in <b>discrete</b> bits. Concepts and notations from <b>discrete</b> mathematics are useful in studying and describing objects and problems in branches of computer science, such as computer algorithms, programming languages, cryptography, automated theorem proving, and software development. Conversely, computer implementations are significant in applying ideas from <b>discrete</b> mathematics to real-world problems, such as in operations research.|$|E

25|$|In group theory, {{a branch}} of mathematics, the baby-step giant-step is a meet-in-the-middle {{algorithm}} for computing the <b>discrete</b> logarithm. The <b>discrete</b> log problem is of fundamental importance {{to the area of}} public key cryptography. Many of the most commonly used cryptography systems are {{based on the assumption that}} the <b>discrete</b> log is extremely difficult to compute; the more difficult it is, the more security it provides a data transfer. One way to increase the difficulty of the <b>discrete</b> log problem is to base the cryptosystem on a larger group.|$|E
25|$|A Markov {{chain is}} a type of Markov process that has either <b>discrete</b> state space or <b>discrete</b> index set (often {{representing}} time), but the precise definition of a Markov chain varies. For example, it is common to define a Markov chain as a Markov process in either <b>discrete</b> or continuous time with a countable state space (thus regardless of the nature of time), but it is also common to define a Markov chain as having <b>discrete</b> time in either countable or continuous state space (thus regardless of the state space).|$|E
25|$|A {{function}} defined on {{an interval}} of the integers is usually called a sequence. A sequence {{could be a}} finite sequence from a data source or an infinite sequence from a <b>discrete</b> dynamical system. Such a <b>discrete</b> function could be defined explicitly by a list (if its domain is finite), or by a formula for its general term, {{or it could be}} given implicitly by a recurrence relation or difference equation. Difference equations are similar to a differential equations, but replace differentiation by taking the difference between adjacent terms; they can be used to approximate differential equations or (more often) studied in their own right. Many questions and methods concerning differential equations have counterparts for difference equations. For instance, where there are integral transforms in harmonic analysis for studying continuous functions or analogue signals, there are <b>discrete</b> transforms for <b>discrete</b> functions or digital signals. As well as the <b>discrete</b> metric there are more general <b>discrete</b> or finite metric spaces and finite topological spaces.|$|E
25|$|These two {{approaches}} can each be further {{divided into three}} families of protocols: <b>discrete</b> variable, continuous variable and distributed phase reference coding. <b>Discrete</b> variable protocols {{were the first to}} be invented, and they remain the most widely implemented. The other two families are mainly concerned with overcoming practical limitations of experiments. The two protocols described below both use <b>discrete</b> variable coding.|$|E
25|$|Although {{the analogy}} between both {{functions}} is suggestive, {{the following question}} must be set: is the differential entropy a valid extension of the Shannon <b>discrete</b> entropy? Differential entropy lacks a number of properties that the Shannon <b>discrete</b> entropy hasnbsp&– it can even be negativenbsp&– and thus corrections have been suggested, notably limiting density of <b>discrete</b> points.|$|E
25|$|Any {{class can}} be viewed as a {{category}} whose only morphisms are the identity morphisms. Such categories are called <b>discrete.</b> For any given set I, the <b>discrete</b> category on I is the small category that has the elements of I as objects and only the identity morphisms as morphisms. <b>Discrete</b> categories are the simplest kind of category.|$|E

25|$|The Zipf {{distribution}} {{is sometimes called}} the <b>discrete</b> Pareto distribution because it {{is analogous to the}} continuous Pareto distribution {{in the same way that}} the <b>discrete</b> uniform {{distribution is}} analogous to the continuous uniform distribution.|$|E
25|$|<b>Discrete</b> {{valuation}} {{rings are}} equipped with a function which assign an integer to any element r. This number, called the valuation of r can be informally {{thought of as a}} zero or pole order of r. <b>Discrete</b> valuation rings are precisely the one-dimensional regular local rings. For example, the ring of germs of holomorphic functions on a Riemann surface is a <b>discrete</b> valuation ring.|$|E

25|$|The <b>discrete</b> Fréchet distance, {{also called}} the {{coupling}} distance, is an approximation of the Fréchet metric for polygonal curves, defined by Eiter and Mannila. The <b>discrete</b> Fréchet distance considers only positions of the leash where its endpoints are located at vertices of the two polygonal curves and never {{in the interior of}} an edge. This special structure allows the <b>discrete</b> Fréchet distance to be computed in polynomial time by an easy dynamic programming algorithm.|$|E
25|$|Complex-valued {{functions}} on {{a finite}} abelian group have <b>discrete</b> Fourier transforms which are functions on the dual group, {{which is a}} (non-canonically) isomorphic group. Moreover, any function on a finite group can be recovered from its <b>discrete</b> Fourier transform.|$|E
