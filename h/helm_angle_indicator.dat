Ship flow simulations are performed by using a hybrid RANSE/BEM model. Numerical predictions by RANSE and BEM solvers are validated through comparisons against ex- perimental data for the ship considered in the study. The com- parative analysis of untwisted and twisted rudders is carried out by fully–appended ship flow simulations at uniform ship speed and rudder angles between 0 and 20 degrees. Numerical results predict comparable manoeuvring capabilities for the alternative layouts, whereas the twisted design allows to mitigate negative pressure peaks observed on the untwisted rudder surface over a range of <b>helm</b> <b>angles...</b>|$|R

40|$|The early X-ray light {{curve of}} Gamma Ray Bursts (GRBs) is complex, and shows a typical steep-flat-steep behaviour. The time T_a {{at which the}} flat (plateau) part ends may bear some {{important}} physical information, especially if it plays the same role of the so called jet break time t_jet. To this aim, stimulated by the recent analysis of Willingale et al., we have assembled a sample of GRBs of known redshifts, spectral parameters of the prompt emission, and T_a. By using T_a as a jet <b>angle</b> <b>indicator,</b> and then estimating the collimation corrected prompt energetics, we find a correlation between the latter quantity and the peak energy of the prompt emission. However, this correlation has a large dispersion, similar to the dispersion of the Amati correlation {{and it is not}} parallel to the Ghirlanda correlation. Furthermore, we show that the correlation itself results mainly from the dependence of the jet opening angle on the isotropic prompt energy, with the time T_a playing no role, contrary to what we find for the jet break time t_jet. We also find that for the bursts in our sample T_a weakly correlates with E_iso of the prompt emission, but that this correlation disappears when considering all bursts of known redshift and T_a. There is no correlation between T_a and the isotropic energy of the plateau phase. Comment: 10 pages, 8 figures, 2 tables. Title changed. Accepted for publication in MNRA...|$|R
50|$|Tarpon got {{underway}} on 25 January for {{her second}} patrol which {{took her to}} the Moluccas. On the 30th, she sighted a convoy; but, since the enemy ships were well escorted, the submarine abandoned the chase. On 1 February, Tarpon fired a spread of four torpedoes at a freighter. One hit. She then fired two more; both hit. Her victim was apparently sinking when the submarine left the scene of the attack, but postwar analysis of Japanese records did not confirm the kill. On 11 February, while investigating a surface contact. Tarpon was illuminated by the enemy's searchlight. She dived and went deep but was severely jolted by four depth charges that knocked out her bow planes, rudder <b>angle</b> <b>indicator,</b> and port annunciator. On the night of 23 February - 24 February, Tarpon ran aground while attempting to navigate Boling Strait, west of Flores Island. Jettisoning ammunition, fresh water, fuel, and torpedoes failed to lighten the ship enough to float her off. A native boat then took an officer ashore on the island of Adunara, later returning with the only white man on the island, a Dutch missionary, Pastor H. von Den Rulst. He informed Wallace the next high tide would occur between 16:00 and 18:00. His warning that Japanese planes had been over the island during each of the past four days caused the crew a bit of uneasiness until flood tide. Then, with three engines backing, she slid off the bottom, returning to Fremantle on 5 March.|$|R

50|$|The Mountwood and her {{identical}} sister Woodchurch {{originally had}} bright orange funnels {{with a black}} base and black soot buffer. On the main deck, there was a forward, heated shelter and also a main saloon, aft of this was the toilets and machine space. Below was a saloon bar. On the top deck was a large open promenade and a forward shelter beneath the bridge, although this shelter was open beneath the bridge so it was often breezy and cold. They had a main central wheelhouse and two side cabs, and power came from two medium speed Crossley 8-cylinder diesel engines. Upon the bridge deck, in the wheelhouse, one would find the large brass helm, the hydraulic steering telemotor. a binnacle, and two conjoined Chadburn Synchrostep engine order telegraphs. These were linked {{to the other two}} identical telegraphs in the docking cabs so they moved in tandem. There was also whistle controls and lighting controls. In the docking cabs or navigation boxes was another binnacle, a whistle control, telegraphs and also various indicators for engine/speed etc. Originally all ferries had a simple ship to shore communicating radio, but did not have radar or sonar. The wheelhouses of the two ferries differed slightly due to different positioning of rudder <b>angle</b> <b>indicators</b> and engine RPM gauges in the bridge wings. The telegraphs were designed to give the captain direct control of the engines (although they could still be used in the traditional signal / response manner) and as such were marked with commands such as brakeand start. They also had more speed settings ahead and astern. The original engines could reach full speed within 3 seconds once run had been passed.|$|R

Consequently, the current method to define the viewing cone, with a fixed contrast ratio, does not represent perceived performance differences between displays. Our previous study, with two LCDs and a plasma display, revealed that changes in image quality with viewing angle are predicted by combining luminance variations and white-point shifts for an intermediate grey level. In this paper, we show that, for viewers comparing the viewing angle dependent quality between displays, that same relation holds.

5000|$|Egremont {{differed}} externally to Leasowe in {{that she}} had a canvas awning fitted around her funnel. Early photographs of Leasowe and Egremont show them carrying what look like binnacle shrouds (the brass lids that sit atop of a binnacle) on the roof of their wheelhouses and wing cabs. It is not understood what these were. Some people have said that they were in fact ventilation devices. Upon the bridge there were numerous modern devices. Chadburn synchrostep telegraphs and rudder <b>angle</b> <b>indicators,</b> hydraulic steering telemotor and an automatic whistle control could be found in both the wheelhouse and the navigation boxes. There was also an internal communication system, a ship to shore radio and PA system and three binnacles on the bridge. Similar types of navigation equipment and deck fittings used on these vessels are extant on the Edmund Gardner Pilot Boat at Merseyside Maritime Museum. The Leasowe and Egremont were popular ferries with their crews as they had much improved crew accommodation compared to the earlier steamers, where much of the lower deck space was taken up with boilers and machinery. When the ferries entered service they all had Wallasey white and black funnel liveries. There was, however, a major design fault with Leasowe and Egremont. In order to reach the bows of the ship when casting off etc., crew members were required to either push through the hordes of commuters and climb down a ladder from the forward promenade deck or walk along the rubbing strake and climb over. In flat calm conditions this was not a problem, but in a force 8 gale with the vessel bobbing around wildly, it could be considerably dangerous. The simple reason for such problems was because there was no door leading from the main saloon to the bow area of the ships! ...|$|R
50|$|This graph {{shows the}} stall angle, yet in {{practice}} most pilot operating handbooks (POH) or generic flight manuals describe stalling {{in terms of}} airspeed.

40|$|The Federal Aviation Administration {{recently}} {{released a statement}} that personal and homemade aircraft accidents could be reduced significantly {{with the addition of}} Angle of Attack information for the pilot. Installing most available devices on modern aircraft requires extensive fitting and modification at great expense. Furthermore, modification of older and vintage aircraft may not be desirable. The introduction of a simple, non-invasive device that provides the same information would increase safety and be marketable. Utilizing this opportunity and setting a range of requirements including cost, weight, ease of installation, and reliability, analysis was performed on different methods purposed to accomplish the stated design requirements. The solution selected uses a Hall Device switch (a magnetically actuated electronic switch), a 100 decibel buzzer contained by an interior component, and a vane assembly with magnetic base for position reference on the exterior component. The device transmits airflow information outside the cockpit to the pilot and mounts non-invasively. Adhering the two components to opposite sides of the canopy provides reliable data to the pilot in glider type aircraft, multiengine aircraft, and some single engine aircraft. The Icarus <b>angle</b> of attack <b>indicator</b> proves that the concept of a non-invasive <b>angle</b> of attack <b>indicator</b> is viable and serves its purpose as an experimental aviation device. Further development of the concept should strive to reduce size, increase adjustability, and decrease manufacturing difficulty...|$|R
40|$|A {{leading cause}} for {{extension}} ladder fall incidents is a slide-out event usually related to suboptimal ladder inclination. An improved ladder positioning method or procedure {{could reduce the}} risk of ladder stability failure and the related fall injury. The objective {{of the study was to}} comparatively evaluate the effectiveness of a multimodal <b>angle</b> <b>indicator</b> with other existing methods for extension ladder angular positioning. Twenty experienced and 20 inexperienced ladder users participated in the study. Four ladder positioning methods were tested in a controlled laboratory environment with 4. 88 m (16 ft) and 7. 32 m (24 ft) ladders in extended and retracted positions. The positioning methods included a no-instruction method, the current standard anthropometric method, and two instrumental methods - a bubble level indicator, and a multimodal indicator providing direct feedback with visual and sound signals. Performance measures included positioning angle and time. The results indicated that the anthropometric method was effective in improving the extension ladder positioning angle (p < 0. 001); however, it was associated with considerable variability and required 50 % more time than no-instruction. The bubble level indicator was an accurate positioning method (with very low variability), but required more than double the time of the no-instruction method (p < 0. 001). The multimodal indicator improved the ladder angle setting as compared to the no-instruction and anthropometry methods (p < 0. 001) and required the least time for ladder positioning among the tested methods (p < 0. 001). An indicator with direct multimodal feedback is a viable approach for quick and accurate ladder positioning. The main advantage of the new multimodal method is that it provides continuous feedback on the angle of the device and hence does not require repositioning of the ladder. Furthermore, this indicator can be a valuable tool for training ladder users to correctly apply the current ANSI A 14 standard anthropometric method in ladder angular positioning. The multimodal indicator concept has been further developed to become a hand-held tool in the form of a smart phone application.

40|$|Part 4 : Modelling and Simulation SystemsInternational audienceThe {{purpose of}} this paper is to {{simulate}} the designed physical Particle Image Velocimetry (PIV) system, as a simulation platform to physically build and implement a system for residential building and housing research. The focus is on the angle filter; the filter used to process the images of a laser progressively scanning through a space by adjusting its <b>angle.</b> An <b>indicator</b> of heat escape and ventilation in buildings is the airflow itself. Conventional airflow measurement techniques are typically intrusive, interfering with the data or the environment. For small flows such as that in residential housing, the error introduced can sometimes be large relative to the measured data. In contrast, PIV is a relatively a non-intrusive measurement tool that measures flows. However, there are a few problems with standard PIV techniques, for implementation in an attic space. The proposed solution is to use dust particles, already present in the air, as tracers for the PIV system. In conclusion, our PIV system with a non-diverging laser beam produces a velocity field of similar quality to a velocity field of a standard PIV system...|$|R
