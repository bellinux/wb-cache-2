5|$|Commentary on {{the album}} has {{included}} discussion of its minimal instrumentation and the interjection of unexpected sounds. Reviewers <b>have</b> <b>described</b> <b>the</b> lyrics on the songs as unconventional and dark, and noted the prominence of vocal harmonies between the Deal sisters. The reception of Title TK has been generally positive; appraisal has included commendation for Albini's contributions {{to the sound of}} the album, and for how the recordings isolate individual instruments.|$|E
5|$|Environmentalists, urban {{planners}} and cycling enthusiasts {{around the world}} have expressed interest in the Cycle Center, and want to emulate {{what they see as a}} success story in urban planning and transit-oriented development.

5|$|Leccinum manzanitae is edible, and its {{taste is}} {{sometimes}} rated highly, although others <b>have</b> <b>described</b> <b>the</b> flavor as bland. Drying the mushroom may improve the flavor. One field guide advises caution when selecting this species for the table, as {{there have been}} poisonings reported with similar-looking mushrooms found in the Rocky Mountains and Pacific Northwest region of the United States.|$|E
5|$|Stylistically, many {{commentators}} <b>have</b> <b>described</b> <b>The</b> Oceanides {{as either}} an outright example of Impressionism or somehow derivative of that art movement. Others have countered that Sibelius's active {{development of the}} two subjects, his sparing use of scales favored by Impressionists, and his prioritization of action and structure over ephemeral, atmospheric background distinguish the piece from quintessential examples, such as Debussy's La mer.|$|E
5|$|The Master Chief is a {{video game}} icon, a {{relative}} newcomer among more established franchise characters, such as Mario, Sonic the Hedgehog and Lara Croft. The character has received a mostly positive reception. While some <b>have</b> <b>described</b> <b>the</b> Chief's silent and faceless nature as a weakness of the character, other publications have suggested these attributes better allows players to assume his role.|$|E

5|$|The US 24th Infantry Regiment of the 25th Division was {{ineffective}} {{in its first}} showing. The regiment, composed mostly of black troops, was criticized by the Army for being quick to panic and retreat. Some historians <b>have</b> <b>described</b> <b>the</b> Army's statements as biased, downplaying the regiment's successes and overstating its failures.|$|E
5|$|Journalists <b>have</b> <b>described</b> <b>the</b> episode as a satire on both American {{politics}} and environmentalism. It won an Environmental Media Award in 1991 {{for being the}} best television episode of the year with an environmental message. Since the episode first aired, the three-eyed fish Blinky has been mentioned several times in news articles regarding nuclear waste and mutation. The episode was positively received by television critics for its satire on American politics. It acquired a Nielsen rating of 15.8, and was the highest-rated show on the Fox network the week it aired.|$|E
5|$|On 15 April, Hitler issued Operational Order No. 6, {{which called}} for the Kursk {{offensive}} operation, codenamed Zitadelle ("Citadel"), to begin on 3 May or shortly thereafter. The directive was drafted by Kurt Zeitzler, the OKH Chief of Staff. For the offensive to succeed it was deemed essential to attack before the Soviets {{had a chance to}} prepare extensive defences or to launch an offensive of their own. Some military historians <b>have</b> <b>described</b> <b>the</b> operation using the term blitzkrieg (lightning war); other military historians do not use the term in their works on the battle.|$|E

5|$|The CNSA {{became a}} major part of {{everyday}} life and culture in occupied Belgium. The organization fulfilled much of the day-to-day running of a welfare system and generally prevented famine, although food and material shortages were extremely common throughout the occupation. At its height, the CNSA had more than 125,000 agents and distributors across the country. Historians <b>have</b> <b>described</b> <b>the</b> CNSA itself, with its central committee and local networks across the country, as paralleling the actions of the official Belgian government in peacetime. In the eyes of contemporaries, the CNSA became a symbol of national unity and of passive resistance.|$|E
5|$|The {{second game}} was {{initially}} postponed, but was forfeited by the White Sox {{the next day}} by order of American League president Lee MacPhail. Disco Demolition Night preceded, and may have helped precipitate, the decline of disco in late 1979; some scholars and disco artists <b>have</b> <b>described</b> <b>the</b> event as expressive of racism and homophobia while others have denied this connection. Disco Demolition Night remains well {{known as one of}} the most extreme promotions in major league history.|$|E
5|$|The seductive details {{effect has}} {{primarily}} been demonstrated {{at the point}} of knowledge acquisition (initial learning); its impact on transfer performance has not been clearly shown. Theory in text comprehension suggests that seductive details might be detrimental for recall but advantageous for transfer performance because of the schematic representation of information that trainees form during instruction. Researchers <b>have</b> <b>described</b> <b>the</b> seductive details effect as having a damaging effect on recall because it distracts trainees from learning and they tend to form inappropriate schemas to organize information. However, when learners are applying knowledge, empirical studies suggest that the distortion of the macro structure or schema of the instructional material is beneficial.|$|E

5|$|Under {{pressure}} from the League of Nations, Poland agreed to negotiate, hoping to buy time and divert attention from the upcoming Żeligowski's Mutiny. The Lithuanians sought to achieve as much protection for Vilnius as possible. The agreement resulted in a ceasefire and established a demarcation line running through the disputed Suwałki Region up to the Bastuny railway station. The line was incomplete and did not provide adequate protection to Vilnius. Although neither Vilnius or the surrounding region was explicitly addressed in the agreement, numerous historians <b>have</b> <b>described</b> <b>the</b> agreement as allotting Vilnius to Lithuania.|$|E
5|$|Different {{subspecies}} of plains zebra were recognised {{as members}} of Equus quagga by early researchers, though there was much confusion over which species were valid. Quagga subspecies were described {{on the basis of}} differences in striping patterns, but these differences were since attributed to individual variation within the same populations. Some subspecies and even species, such as E. q. danielli and Hippotigris isabellinus, were only based on illustrations (iconotypes) of aberrant quagga specimens. Some authors <b>have</b> <b>described</b> <b>the</b> quagga as a kind of wild horse rather than a zebra, and one craniometric study from 1980 seemed to confirm its affiliation with the horse (Equus caballus). It has been pointed out that early morphological studies were erroneous; using skeletons from stuffed specimens can be problematical, as early taxidermists sometimes used donkey and horse skulls inside their mounts when the originals were unavailable.|$|E
5|$|In 1958, Nathaniel Branden {{established}} Nathaniel Branden Lectures, later incorporated as the Nathaniel Branden Institute (NBI), {{to promote}} Rand's philosophy. Collective members gave lectures for NBI and wrote articles for Objectivist periodicals that she edited. Rand later published {{some of these}} articles in book form. Critics, including some former NBI students and Branden himself, <b>have</b> <b>described</b> <b>the</b> culture of NBI as one of intellectual conformity and excessive reverence for Rand, with some describing NBI or the Objectivist movement itself as a cult or religion. Rand expressed opinions {{on a wide range}} of topics, from literature and music to sexuality and facial hair, and some of her followers mimicked her preferences, wearing clothes to match characters from her novels and buying furniture like hers. However, some former NBI students believe the extent of these behaviors has been exaggerated, with the problem being concentrated among Rand's closest followers in New York. Rand was unimpressed with many of the NBI students and held them to strict standards, sometimes reacting coldly or angrily to those who disagreed with her.|$|E

5|$|Some space opera {{doctrines of}} Scientology are only {{provided}} by the church to experienced members, who church leaders maintain {{are the only ones}} able to correctly understand them. Several former members of the church have exposed these secret documents, leading to lengthy court battles with the church, which failed to keep the secret. Critics of the church have noted that some of the narratives are scientifically impossible, and have thus assailed the church as untrustworthy for teaching them. The space opera teachings have also been satirized in popular culture. Scholars of religion <b>have</b> <b>described</b> <b>the</b> space opera narratives as a creation myth designed to encourage reverence of Hubbard as a supreme messenger. Several academics have drawn attention to the similarity of the space opera myths to themes of the 1950s Cold War culture in which they were constructed.|$|E
5|$|Many authors <b>have</b> <b>described</b> <b>the</b> prey items taken under natural circumstances. Although {{fish and}} frogs are their most common prey, they eat almost any small vertebrate.
