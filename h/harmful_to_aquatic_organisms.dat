Transported smolts (T) released 10 - 13 kilometers below Bonneville Dam had lower maximum exposure levels (126 percent) and experienced no difference in daily survival rates relative to unexposed smolts. River temperature levels and trends in turbidity and disease prevalence between releases of high and low exposure smolts were not consistent with the observed effects on survival rates.

40|$|Ionic liquids (ILs) {{have been}} {{reported}} to be toxic and <b>harmful</b> <b>to</b> <b>aquatic</b> and terrestrial <b>organisms,</b> thus it is imperative to remove the residual ILs in various effluents. In this work, a three-dimensional (3 D) electrocatalytic system with synthesized AuPd/Fe 3 O 4 nanoparticles (NPs) as particle electrodes (PEs) was established for the degradation of typical 1 -butyl- 3 -methylimidazolium ([BMIM]) based ILs. The assynthesized AuPd/Fe 3 O 4 possessed preferable electrochemical properties for in situ supplement of H 2 O 2 and renewable Fe species. This 3 D electrocatalytic system exhibited excellent performance with 100 % removal rate of BMIM in 90 min under 120 mA, pH 3, and 1 g/L dosage of AuPd/Fe 3 O 4 NPs. Kinetics study revealed that the degradation rule of BMIM well followed the anodic Fenton treatment (AFT) model, in which the variation of the degradation rate was positively correlated with that of dissolved Fe 2 +, while significantly differed from the evolution of H 2 O 2. Particularly, the appearance of the H 2 O 2 inflection point suggested the optimal effectiveness of AuPd/Fe 3 O 4 -based 3 D electrocatalysis. During this electrocatalytic process, the active HO center dot was produced over the AuPd/Fe 3 O 4 PEs, thereby initiated the highly efficient degradation of BMIM into 1 -butyl- 3 -methyl- 2, 4, 5 -trioxoimidazolidine, 1 -butyl- 3 -methylurea and N-butyl-formamide as main intermediates. The electrocatalytic stability of the AuPd/Fe 3 O 4 PEs over seven times further indicated the potential applicability for organic wastewater treatment. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

40|$|Introduction: Cyanides as carbon-nitrogen {{radicals}} are very toxic compounds and highly <b>harmful</b> <b>to</b> humans and <b>aquatic</b> <b>organisms.</b> The efficacy of eggshells (ES) {{was investigated in}} this research work as an adsorbent {{for the elimination of}} cyanide from polluted streams. Material and Methods: In this experimental study, the capability of ES to adsorb cyanide ions was conducted using a series of batch tests in a shaker-incubator instrument. For each batch run, 100 mL of solution containing a known initial concentration of cyanide and with the preferred level of pH was shacked. The effects of selected parameters such as pH (3 - 11), reaction time (5 – 60 min) cyanide concentrations (50 – 150 mg/L) and the adsorbent dosage (0. 25 – 2 g/L) were investigated on the removal cyanide as a target contaminate. Chemical composition ES were analyzed using a Philips model XL- 30 scanning electron microscope (SEM) with energy-dispersive X-ray microanalysis (EDX). The specific surface and pore size distributions of ES were measured via Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET) isotherm and Barrett-Joyner-Halenda (BJH) methods using a Micrometrics particle size analyzer. The concentration of cyanide in solution before and after treatment was determined using the titrimetric method as described in the standard methods. Results: Analysis of the ES component using the EDX technique showed that the main part of it consisted of calcium and its other components were magnesium, iron, aluminum and silicate. The experimental data showed that the maximum cyanide removal occurred at pH of 11, adsorbent dose (0. 5 g/L) and 40 min contact time. The kinetic evaluation indicated that the pseudo-second-order kinetic had the best fit to the experimental results predicting a chemisorption process. The equilibrium adsorption of cyanide onto ES was well represented by the Langmuir equation. Conclusion: As a result, ES as waste materials was revealed as a very efficient and low-cost adsorbent and a promising option for removing cyanide from industrial wastewaters...|$|R

While it has been demonstrated that exposure to UV (280 - 400 nm) affects the UV absorbance of fish mucus, whether the effects of UV exposure vary between UVB and UVA wavelengths is not known. Therefore, we investigated whether the UVB, UVA, or photosynthetically active radiation (PAR, 400 - 700 nm) portions of the spectrum affected the UV absorbance of epithelial mucus and Fulton 2 ̆ 7 s body condition index of the cleaner fish Labroides dimidiatus. We also compared field-measured UV absorbance with laboratory based high-performance liquid chromatography measurements of mycosporine-like amino acid concentrations. After 1 week, we found that the UV absorbance of epithelial mucus was higher in the UVB+UVA+PAR treatment compared with the UVA+PAR and PAR only treatments; after 2 and 3 weeks, however, differences between treatments were not detected. After 3 weeks, Fulton 2 ̆ 7 s body condition index was lower for fish in the UVB+UVA+PAR compared with PAR and UVA+PAR treatments; furthermore, all experimentally treated fish had a lower Fulton 2 ̆ 7 s body condition index than did freshly caught fish. Finally, we found a decrease with depth in the UV absorbance of mucus of wild-caught fish. This study suggests that the increase in UV absorbance of fish mucus in response to increased overall UV levels {{is a function of the}} UVB {{portion of the}} spectrum. This has important implications for the ability of cleaner fish and other fishes to adjust their mucus UV protection in response to variations in environmental UV exposure...|$|R

40|$|Abstract—Room-temperature ionic liquids (ILs) are {{considered}} to be green chemicals that may replace volatile organic solvents currently used by industry. However, IL effects on aquatic organisms and ecosystems are currently unknown. We studied the acute effects of imidazolium-based ILs on survival of the crustacean Daphnia magna and their chronic effects on number of first-brood neonates, total number of neonates, and average brood size. Lethal concentrations of imidazolium ILs with various anions (X 2) ranged from a median lethal concentration (LC 50) of 8. 03 to 19. 91 mg L 21, whereas salts with a sodium cation (Na 1 X 2) were more than an order of magnitude higher (NaPF 6 LC 50, 9, 344. 81 mg L 21; NaBF 4 LC 50, 4765. 75 mg L 21). Thus, toxicity appeared {{to be related to the}} imidazolium cation and not to the various anions (e. g., Cl 2, Br 2,, and). The toxicity of imidazolium- 2 2 PF BF 6 4 based ILs is comparable to that of chemicals currently used in manufacturing and disinfection processes (e. g., ammonia and phenol), indicating that these green chemicals may be more <b>harmful</b> <b>to</b> <b>aquatic</b> <b>organisms</b> than current volatile organic solvents. We conducted 21 -d chronic bioassays of individual D. magna exposed to nonlethal IL concentrations at constant food-resource levels. Daphnia magna produced significantly fewer total neonates, first-brood neonates, and average neonates when exposed to lower concentrations (0. 3 mg L 21) of imidazolium-based ILs than in the presence of Na-based salts at higher concentrations (400 mg L 21). Such reductions in the reproductive output of Daphnia populations could cascade through natural freshwater ecosystems.

Overall, degradation rate constants increased with increasing initial H 2 O 2 level (0 mM, 1 mM and 3 mM) and increasing pH values (at pH= 3, k = 0. 0016 sec- 1 for NXP and k = 0. 0015 sec- 1 for IBP; at pH = 9, k = 0. 0036 sec- 1 for NXP and k = 0. 0029 sec- 1 for IBP). The presence of nitrate increased the photolysis rate constants of both NXP and IBP slightly due to hydroxyl radical formation from irradiation of nitrate. The rate constants were decreased because of screening light effect from the addition of natural organic matter (NOM) : the rate constants were reduced by 18 % and 36 %for NXP and by 30 % and 46 % for IBP degradation with fulvic acid (FA) and humic acid (HA), respectively. To understand the mechanism of degradation under the UV 254 nm/H 2 O 2 with NOM, a model was constructed to predict the phototransformation rate constants of NXP and IBP. From the model results, it could be seen that there was a concentration of H 2 O 2 corresponding to the maximum enhancement of photolysis of select PPCPs. The mineralization of NXP and IBP was 30 % and 32 %, respectively. ^ The degradation behaviors of TYL under UV 254 nm and UV 254 nm/H 2 O 2 were quite different from the degradation of NXP and IBP. TYL was present as a mixture of two compounds: TYLA and TYLB. Photoisomerization and photodegradation proceeded at the same time, and photoisomerization reactions predominated. A kinetic model was constructed for determining the kinetic data. Under UV 254 nm condition and at pH = 7, for TYLA, kf = 0. 066 sec- 1 kr = 0. 016 sec- 1 kd = 0. 00057 sec- 1, and for TYLB, rate constant for forward reaction kf = 0. 067 sec- 1, rate constant for backward reaction kr = 0. 022 sec- 1 and degradation rate constant kd = 0. 00040 sec - 1. Solution pH values and the presence of nitrate and NOM did not have any significant influences on the direct photolysis (UV 254 nm) of TYL. Also at pH = 7, the addition of H 2 O 2 did not dramatically affect the photoisomerization reaction, but accelerated the photodegradation of TYL. ^ Selected major photochemical reaction by-products were identified by Gas Chromatography/Mass Spectroscopy (GC/MS) and Liquid Chromatography/Mass Spectroscopy (LC/MS). For both UV 254 nm and UV 254 nm/H 2 O 2 conditions, the first step of NXP and IBP photodegradtion is decarboxylation, then the intermediates were oxidized to ketone and other products. Possible pathways of NXP and IBP degradation are proposed. For TYL, photoisomerization results from the / rotation of bond of the ketodiene on the TYL ring. ...|$|E
