40|$|Abstract—The primary {{objective}} {{of this paper was}} to construct a “kinematic parameter-independent modeling of three-axis machine tools for <b>geometric</b> <b>error</b> measurement ” technique. Improving the accuracy of the <b>geometric</b> <b>error</b> for three-axis machine tools is one of the machine tools ’ core techniques. This paper first applied the traditional method of HTM to deduce the <b>geometric</b> <b>error</b> model for three-axis machine tools. This <b>geometric</b> <b>error</b> model was related to the three-axis kinematic parameters where the overall errors was relative to the machine reference coordinate system. Given that the measurement of the linear axis in this model should be on the ideal motion axis, there were practical difficulties. Through a measurement method consolidating translational errors and rotational errors in the <b>geometric</b> <b>error</b> model, we simplified the three-axis <b>geometric</b> <b>error</b> model to a kinematic parameter-independent model.

The design of the new standard allows to extract 3 intrinsic parameters for each position of the MFB: 1 linear positioning error and 2 straightness errors. To ensure the metrology traceability chain to the SI metre definition, the calibration of the MFB is carried out using an accurate traceable coordinate measuring machine (CMM) when applying the reversal technique.

In particular, <b>geometric</b> <b>errors</b> will directly affect the calculation of transfer matrix A in the linear system equation AX = B. In this paper, we have applied the truncated total least squares (TTLS) method to reconstruct EPs from BSPs. This method accounts for the noise/errors {{on both sides of the}} system equation and treats <b>geometric</b> <b>errors</b> in a new fashion. The algorithm is tested using a realistically shaped heart-lung-torso model with inhomogeneous conductivities. The h-adaptive boundary element method [h-BEM, a BEM mesh adaptation scheme which starts from preset meshes and then refines (adds/removes) grid with fixed order of interpolation function and prescribed numerical accuracy] is used for the forward modeling and the TTLS is applied for inverse solutions and its performance is also compared with conventional regularization approaches such as Tikhonov and truncated single value decomposition (TSVD) with zeroth-, first-, and second-order.
