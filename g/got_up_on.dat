5|$|The fifth {{match was}} a Triple Threat {{match for the}} WWE Championship between {{champion}} John Cena, Christian, and Chris Jericho. The match saw all three wrestlers take the advantage over one another. A spot in the match included Jericho applying the Walls of Jericho on Cena, but he released the move and performed a springboard dropkick on Christian, after Christian <b>got</b> <b>up</b> <b>on</b> the ring apron. Late in the match, Jericho reversed an Unprettier attempt by Christian by tossing Christian directly to Cena. Cena performed an FU on Christian and pinned Christian to retain the WWE title.|$|E
25|$|In {{the fifth}} round, Mayweather {{connected}} {{with a series of}} straight rights and lefts; when N'dou would not go down, Mayweather gave a little smile and continued the barrage. He dominated his opponent, before flooring him with a series of rights in the seventh round. N'dou <b>got</b> <b>up</b> <b>on</b> shaky legs, forcing a stoppage at 1:50. At times during the fight, Mayweather (in black trunks outlined with fur) seemed to toy with N'dou. By the end of 2003, Mayweather was still The Ring's lightweight champion and the #5-ranked best pound-for-pound boxer in the world.|$|E
25|$|On 1 December 1905, signalled by {{the arrival}} whistle of a locomotive's engine, the Malacca branch of the F.M.S. Railway was {{declared}} open, Acting Resident Councillor Bland having arrived at 6.30 a.m. at Kubu Station where he met R. C. Fryer, Firmstone, Lupton and Darbishire (the constructing engineer), after which they proceeded to Tampin, arriving there at 7.40. With the extension of rail services to Malacca, it was now possible to leave there at 1 p.m. and arrive at Penang at 6.21 a.m. the following day, instead of taking {{two or three days}} by steamer. The project had pushed ahead with speed. The first sod was cut on 9 June 1901 and plate laying commenced October 1904. Malacca's first engine was put together at the Malacca Yard, and steam was <b>got</b> <b>up</b> <b>on</b> 9 November 1904. The rails were joined to the trunk line on 15 May and the laying of 2.5 miles of railway track completed by 1 December.|$|E

500|$|In 1987, {{during a}} Fitzroy Football Club benefit concert, the other cast members of Neighbours {{put on their}} own talent stage show. Minogue had not {{prepared}} anything so she <b>got</b> <b>up</b> <b>on</b> stage and performed a cover version of [...] "Loco-Motion" [...] - she was then immediately signed to a recording contract with Mushroom Records. The song was released as a single in Australia, and became the highest-selling single of the 1980s. Its success resulted in Minogue travelling to London with Mushroom Records executive Gary Ashley to work with Stock, Aitken and Waterman. They knew little of Minogue and had forgotten that she was arriving; as a result, they wrote [...] "I Should Be So Lucky" [...] while she waited outside the studio. Minogue recorded the song {{in less than an}} hour, and returned home to Australia to work on Neighbours. The song became a huge chart success, and Mike Stock travelled to Melbourne to apologize to Minogue for forgetting about her previous recording session. [...] While Stock was there, Kylie recorded her next single, [...] "Got to Be Certain" [...] along with album track, and the Japan-only single release, [...] "Turn It into Love", and Stock successfully convinced Minogue to return to London in the beginning of 1988 to record songs for her debut album.|$|E

2500|$|At {{the first}} ever SummerSlam, The Mega Powers teamed up against André the Giant and Ted DiBiase, The Mega Bucks with Savage's former tag-team partner Jesse [...] "The Body" [...] Ventura as the special guest referee. Most of the pre-match {{build-up}} centered on Elizabeth, who by this time was {{at the peak of}} her popularity. The tease for the match was that if things got bad, Elizabeth, billed as the secret weapon of The Mega Powers, was going to wear sexy red panties under her fancy clothes. Towards the end of match, André and Dibiase were in control, so Elizabeth <b>got</b> <b>up</b> <b>on</b> the apron and ripped her skirt off to reveal her underwear which distracted André, Dibiase and Ventura, giving Savage and Hogan time to recover after being knocked out of the ring. The Mega Powers quickly took advantage of the situation and won the match after Ventura made a reluctant three-count (Savage rode Ventura's arm down to the mat to finalize the count).|$|E
2500|$|Going {{along with}} the tour's satirical theme of consumerism, U2 {{announced}} their tour on 12 February 1997 by holding {{a news conference at}} a Kmart discount store in New York City. [...] Hundreds of reporters from record companies, radio stations, television networks, newspapers, and magazines were in attendance at the conference, whose location was not revealed until the night before. Upon their arrival at the store, U2 <b>got</b> <b>up</b> <b>on</b> the stage assembled in the store's lingerie department, and performed [...] "Holy Joe", a B-side from the [...] "Discothèque" [...] single, which had been released nine days prior. [...] The entire event was broadcast live through various sources on television, radio, and the Internet. [...] Following the performance, the band answered questions for a half hour. [...] It was announced that the beginning of the PopMart Tour was to feature stadium shows in 62 cities throughout North America and Europe, beginning in Whitney, Nevada, on 25 April, and ending in Seattle, Washington, on 12 December. [...] They would tour an additional 12 cities in 1998 throughout Africa, Asia, Australia, and South America. [...] Tickets went on sale for the announced dates several days after the tour's announcement, and were priced at an average of $50 worldwide. [...] Due to the lack of sponsors for the tour, ticket prices were almost 50% higher for this tour than Zoo TV. [...] In markets where the average income was low, tickets were sold for a lower price, which was enough for the band to break even, but not lose any money in the process.|$|E
