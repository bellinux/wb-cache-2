50|$|Color {{photography}} {{begins with}} any standard camera. Special magazines or adapters {{must be provided}} to accommodate two separate rolls of film. Two films are loaded, passing through the photographing aperture with the emulsions towards each other. The <b>front</b> <b>film</b> is orthochromatic, to record the blue-green portion of the picture. On the surface of its emulsion is a red-dye layer equivalent to a Wratten 23A filter. The rear film is panchromatic, and being photographed through the red coating of the <b>front</b> <b>film,</b> records only the red-orange components of the picture. No filtering is necessary either for exterior or interior photography, as all necessary color corrections are made by adjusting {{the development of the}} two negatives during printing.|$|E
50|$|The {{foreground}} {{action is}} lighted with yellow light only {{in front of}} a uniform, strongly lighted blue backing. Panchromatic negative film is used in the camera as the rear component of a bipack in which the <b>front</b> <b>film</b> is a positive yellow dye image of the background scene. This yellow dye image is exposed on the negative by the blue light from the backing areas, but the yellow light from the foreground passes through it and records an image of the foreground at the same time.|$|E
50|$|The {{film was}} part of a cycle of home <b>front</b> <b>films</b> {{produced}} in Germany during the war. The film was intended to fan anti-British sentiment and prepare Germans psychologically for the destruction of their cities by Allied bombing raids and invasions. It premiered in Lübeck on 6 July 1944.|$|R

5000|$|Though celebrated at the time, {{the film}} has largely fallen into obscurity, {{possibly}} due to accusations of subversive Communism leveled against its director and star after World War Two. Fredric March vigorously and publicly defended himself and his wife Florence against the charges; though not officially blacklisted, his career, never recovered its momentum. [...] John Cromwell, after a long and prolific career helming such classics as Of Human Bondage (1934) and the Oscar-winning home <b>front</b> <b>film,</b> Since You Went Away (1944), was blacklisted from 1951 to 1958, never to return to Hollywood.|$|E
5000|$|The Technicolor Process 4 camera, {{manufactured}} to Technicolor's {{detailed specifications}} by Mitchell Camera Corporation, contained color filters, {{a beam splitter}} consisting of a partially reflecting surface inside a split-cube prism, and three separate rolls of black-and-white film (hence the [...] "three-strip" [...] designation). The beam splitter allowed ⅓ of the light coming through the camera lens {{to pass through the}} reflector and a green filter and form an image on one of the strips, which therefore recorded only the green-dominated third of the spectrum. The other ⅔ was reflected sideways by the mirror and passed through a magenta filter, which absorbed green light and allowed only the red and blue thirds of the spectrum to pass. Behind this filter were the other two strips of film, their emulsions pressed into contact face to face. The <b>front</b> <b>film</b> was a red-blind orthochromatic type that recorded only the blue light. On the surface of its emulsion was a red-orange coating that prevented blue light from continuing on to the red-sensitive panchromatic emulsion of the film behind it, which therefore recorded only the red-dominated third of the spectrum.|$|E
40|$|This paper {{considers}} {{the propagation of}} a liquid plug driven by a constant pressure within a rigid axisymmetric tube whose inner surface is coated by a thin liquid film. The Navier–Stokes equations are solved using the finite-volume method and the SIMPLEST algorithm. The effects of precursor film thickness, initial plug length, pressure drop across the plug, and constant surface tension on the plug behavior and tube wall mechanical stresses are investigated. As a plug propagates through a liquid-lined tube, the plug gains liquid from the leading <b>front</b> <b>film,</b> and it deposits liquid into the trailing film. If the trailing film is thicker (thinner) than the precursor film, the plug volume decreases (increases) as it propagates. For a decreasing volume, eventually the plug ruptures. Under {{a specific set of}} conditions, the trailing film thickness equals the precursor film thickness, which leads to steady state results. The plug speed decreases as the precursor film thins because the resistance to the moving front meniscus increases. As the pressure drop across the plug decreases, the plug speed decreases resulting in thinning of the trailing film. As the plug length becomes longer, the viscous resistance in the plug core region increases, which slows the plug and causes the trailing film to become even thinner. The magnitude of the pressure and shear stress at the tube inner wall is maximum in the front meniscus region, and it increases with a thinner precursor film. As the surface tension increases, the plug propagation speed decreases, the strength of the wall pressure in the front meniscus region increases, and the pressure gradient around the peak pressure becomes steeper...|$|E

40|$|Film boiling on spheres in single- and {{two-phase}} flows was studied experimentally and theoretically with {{an emphasis}} on establishing the film boiling heat transfer closure law, which is useful in the analysis of nuclear reactor core melt accidents. Systematic experimentation of film boiling on spheres in single-phase water flows was carried out to investigate the effects of liquid subcooling (from 0 to 40 C), liquid velocity (from 0 to 2 m/s), sphere superheat (from 200 to 900 C), sphere diameter (from 6 to 19 mm), and sphere material (stainless steel and brass) on film boiling heat transfer. Based on the experimental data a general film boiling heat transfer correlation is developed. Utilizing a two-phase laminar boundary-layer model for the unseparated <b>front</b> <b>film</b> region and a turbulent eddy model for the separated rear region, a theoretical model was developed to predict the film boiling heat transfer in all single-phase regimes. The film boiling from a sphere in two-phase flows was investigated both in upward two-phase flows (with void fraction from 0. 2 to 0. 65, water velocity from 0. 6 to 3. 2 m/s, and steam velocity from 3. 0 to 9. 0 m/s) and in downward two-phase flows (with void fraction from 0. 7 to 0. 95, water velocity from 1. 9 to 6. 5 m/s, and steam velocity from 1. 1 to 9. 0 m/s). The saturated single-phase heat transfer correlation was found to be applicable to the two-phase film boiling data by making use of the actual water velocity (water phase velocity), and an adjustment factor of (1 - {alpha}) {sup 1 / 4 } (with a being the void fraction) for downward flow case only. Slight adjustments of the Reynolds number exponents in the correlation provided an even better interpretation of the two-phase data. Preliminary experiments were also conducted to address the influences of multi-sphere structure on the film boiling heat transfer in single- and two-phase flows...|$|E

40|$|The {{impact of}} total {{war on the}} British home front from 1939 to 1945 was profound. In particular, {{military}} and economic mobilization disrupted gender relations. Men and women of different class and national backgrounds encountered each other, sometimes forming romantic relationships that strained the institutions of marriage and family. This disruption was heavily depicted in wartime British cinema, especially in feature films devoted to the home front experience. Differences of class, gender, and nationality were downplayed in order to construct a solidaristic meaning for wartime social experience, fitting for “the People’s War. ” My thesis examines romantic relationships and marriages depicted in numerous British home <b>front</b> <b>films.</b> While many films featured unconventional couples of mixed class or nationality, they did not always offer happy endings. I argue that these films evince the problems of marriage in wartime Britain and foreshadow the rise in divorce that came with peace in 1945 - 46...|$|R
