Bolt's {{personal best}} of 19.19 s in the 200 metres is the world record. This was recorded at the 2009 World Championships in Athletics in Berlin against a headwind of −0.3m/s. This performance broke his previous world record in the event, his 19.30 s clocking in winning the 2008 Olympic 200 metres title.|$|E

He lost to 20-year incumbent Democrat Jack Flynt by 2,770 votes. Gingrich ran up huge margins in the suburban areas of the district, {{but was unable to}} overcome Flynt's lead in the more rural areas. Gingrich's relative success surprised political analysts. Flynt had never faced a serious challenger; Gingrich was the second Republican to <b>ever</b> <b>run</b> against him. He did well against Flynt although 1974 was a disastrous year for Republican candidates nationally due to fallout from the Watergate scandal of the Nixon administration.|$|E

5|$|At {{the end of}} the 1995–96 season, {{shortly after}} Watford's relegation from the First Division, Hessenthaler signed for Gillingham for £235,000, a record fee at the time for the club. He quickly became a key player at Priestfield Stadium. In the 1998–99 season, he {{returned}} to his best form, and he played in the Gills' first ever match at Wembley Stadium. This match was the final of the play-offs against Manchester City, which Gillingham lost after a penalty shoot-out. Shortly afterwards, Gillingham manager Tony Pulis, who had signed Hessenthaler, was dismissed from his post. He was replaced by Peter Taylor, who appointed Hessenthaler as player-coach. In his first season in this new role, he was once again a regular in the Gillingham team, making a total of 47 appearances as the club recorded its highest position to date in the English football league system and best <b>ever</b> <b>run</b> in the FA Cup. Although the cup run came to an end with a 5–0 defeat at the hands of Chelsea of the Premier League, Hessenthaler's high-energy performance prompted Chelsea chairman Ken Bates to joke that he had been keen to sign the player until he discovered to his surprise that he was 35 years old (although Hessenthaler was in fact only 34 at the time). Gillingham once again qualified for the play-off final, with Hessenthaler making his second appearance at Wembley as the Gills beat Wigan Athletic 3–2 after extra time to secure promotion to the Football League First Division {{for the first time in}} the club's history.|$|E

At the 2009 London Marathon he posted his third sub-2:07 time, but again this left him in fourth place in the perennially fast race while Samuel Wanjiru broke the course record. He gained his first international selection that year as he was chosen for the marathon at the 2009 World Championships in Athletics. He remained among the leading pack and the race came down to a duel between Mutai and Abel Kirui in the latter stages. It was Kirui who took the lead to claim the title, but Mutai took the silver medal in a time of 2:07:48 hours, which was the second fastest <b>ever</b> <b>run</b> at the event.

Batsman Chris Davies took charge for the 2015 season and managed to bring in quality players like Luke Camden and the Sri Lankan all-rounder Ian Daniel. The latter showed his class with both bat and ball as he scored over 900 runs in all competitions and took 50 wickets. Park were involved in some thrilling games that year which included a memorable away win at National T20 champions Chester Boughton Hall in the Liverpool Echo Knockout Competition. They also pulled off their highest <b>ever</b> <b>run</b> chase victory as they chased down Lytham's total of 258 to seal a sensational win. Records continued to tumble in {{the final game of}} the season as the departing Rob Houghton pulled off the remarkable feat of taking his 1000th Liverpool Comp wicket in a defeat by Highfield.

25|$|Then, on lap 8, Pierluigi Martini {{spun off}} into the wall and his front wing, which {{separated}} from his car, was hit by Patrese and got stuck in Patrese's undertray. At the front, Mansell was no longer attacking Senna but Senna was unable to pull away. The conditions became better but after another seven laps, the weather started to become worse and more drivers began to spin off, including Mansell who smashed into a wall- which allowed McLaren to win the Constructors' Championship. Berger also spun off twice on the next lap as Senna gestured to the marshals {{to try to get}} the race stopped. Patrese followed suit and finally it was stopped after Senna had finished lap 16. However, the officials had decided to count the results back 2 laps to lap 14 which meant that Senna won from Mansell, Berger, Piquet, Patrese and Morbidelli. Only half points were awarded because the race was stopped before 75% of the distance was over. This particular Grand Prix set a record (that still stands as of today) as the shortest Grand Prix <b>ever</b> <b>run.</b>|$|E

At {{the end of the first}} day Ennis had scored 4,158points, her highest ever first-day total, and was 184points ahead of her nearest competitor Austra Skujyte. Ennis' first-day score included two personal bests: 12.54seconds in the 100metres hurdles and 22.83seconds in the 200metres. Her time in the 100metres hurdles was a new British record and also the fastest time <b>ever</b> <b>run</b> in a heptathlon. It also equalled Dawn Harper's winning time for the women's 100metres hurdles final in the 2008 Olympics. Ennis achieved another personal best of 47.49metres in the javelin and won the final event, the 800metres, in a time of 2:08.65. The following day Ennis announced she would not compete in the 100metres hurdles individual event. Her time in the heptathlon 100metres hurdles would have gained her fourth place in the individual final, and her time in the 200metres would have placed her seventh in the individual event.|$|E

On her next appearance, Miss Jummy took part in the inaugural running of the Eclipse Stakes at Sandown Park, which, with a first prize of £10,000, was the most valuable race <b>ever</b> <b>run</b> in Britain. The race was run over ten furlongs at weight-for-age, although the winners of certain major races, including the Oaks, had to carry a seven pound penalty. She started a 40/1 outsider and finished sixth of the twelve runners behind the six-year-old Bendigo. Miss Jummy was sent to Goodwood in late July and ran twice: after running second to the Duke of Westminster's colt Whitefriar in the Gratwicke Stakes she won the ten furlong Nassau Stakes from three opponents at odds of 11/4, beating Argo Navis into second place for the fourth time.|$|E
