50|$|<b>Fluid</b> <b>shifts</b> {{occur when}} the body's fluids move between the fluid compartments. Physiologically, this occurs by a {{combination}} of hydrostatic pressure gradients and osmotic pressure gradients. Water will move from one space into the next passively across a semi permeable membrane until the hydrostatic and osmotic pressure gradients balance each other. Many medical conditions can cause <b>fluid</b> <b>shifts.</b> When <b>fluid</b> moves out of the intravascular compartment (the blood vessels), blood pressure can drop to dangerously low levels, endangering critical organs such as the brain, heart and kidneys; when it shifts out of the cells (the intracellular compartment), cellular processes slow down or cease from intracellular dehydration; when excessive fluid accumulates in the interstitial space, oedema develops; and <b>fluid</b> <b>shifts</b> into the brain cells can cause increased cranial pressure. <b>Fluid</b> <b>shifts</b> may be compensated by fluid replacement or diuretics.|$|R

40|$|Reports of astronauts' visual {{changes have}} raised concern about ocular health during long-duration spaceflight. Some of these {{findings}} include globe flattening with hyperopic shifts, choroidal folds, optic disc edema, retinal nerve fiber layer (RNFL) thickening, and cotton wool spots. While the etiology remains unknown, it is hypothesized that, in predisposed individuals, hypertension in the brain may follow cephalad <b>fluid</b> <b>shifts</b> during spaceflight. This possible mechanism of ocular changes may also apply to analogous cases of idiopathic intracranial hypertension (IIH) or pseudotumor cerebri on Earth patients. Head-down t ilt (HDT) bed rest is a spaceflight analog that induces cephalad <b>fluid</b> <b>shifts.</b> Previous studies of the HDT position demonstrated body <b>fluid</b> <b>shifts</b> associated with changes in intraocular pressure (IOP) but the conditions of bed rest varied among experiments, {{making it difficult to}} compare data and draw conclusions. For these reasons, vision evaluation of bed rest subjects was implemented for NASA bed rest studies since 2010, in an attempt to monitor vision health in subjects subjected to bed rest. Vision monitoring is thus currently performed in all NASA-conducted bed rest campaign...|$|R
5000|$|Although {{the exact}} cause {{is not known}} at this time, it is {{suspected}} that microgravity-induced cephalad <b>fluid</b> <b>shift</b> and comparable physiological changes {{play a significant role}} in these changes. [...] Other contributing factors may include pockets of increased CO2 and an increase in sodium intake. It seems unlikely that resistive or aerobic exercise are contributing factors, but they may be potential countermeasures to reduce intraocular pressure (IOP) or intracranial pressure (ICP) in-flight.|$|E
50|$|It {{is widely}} {{believed}} that excessive sweating due to strenuous exercise can lead to muscle cramps. Deficiency of sodium and other electrolytes may lead to contracted interstitial fluid compartments, which may exacerbate the muscle cramping. According to this theory, the increased blood plasma osmolality from sweating sodium losses causes a <b>fluid</b> <b>shift</b> from the interstitial space to the intervascular space, which causes the interstitial fluid compartment to deform and contributes to muscle hyperexcitability and risk of spontaneous muscle activity.|$|E
50|$|The {{excessive}} {{absorption of}} fluid will rapidly dilute the serum sodium concentration. This fall in sodium concentration will create an osmotic gradient between intra- and extra- fluid within the brain, leading to net <b>fluid</b> <b>shift</b> away from intra-vascular compartment resulting in cerebral oedema and raised intra-cranial pressure.

The increased respiratory and cardiac workload causes increased blood flow to the cardiac and respiratory muscles.

40|$|It {{is known}} that {{micro-gravity}} has a strong influence on the human musculoskeletal system. A {{number of studies have}} shown that significant changes in skeletal muscles occur in both space flight and bedrest simulation. In our 5 week bedrest study, the cross-sectional area of soleus-gastrocnemius decreased about 12 % while the cross-sectional area of anterior calf muscles decreased about 4 %. Using volume measurements, these losses increased after 17 weeks to approximately 30 % and 21 % respectively. Significant muscle atrophy was also found on the SL-J crew members after only 8 days in space. It is important that these effects are fully understood so that countermeasures can be developed. The same knowledge might also be useful in preventing muscle atrophy related to other medical problems. A major problem with anatomical measurements of muscle during bed rest and microgravity is the influence of <b>fluid</b> <b>shifts</b> and water balance on the measurement of muscle volume, especially when the exposure duration is short and the atrophy is relatively small. <b>Fluid</b> <b>shifts</b> were documented in Skylab by visual observations of blood vessel distention, rapid changes in limb volume, center of mass measurements and subjective descriptions such as puffy faces and head fullness. It has been reported that the muscle water content of biopsied soleus muscles decreased following 8 hours of head down tilt bed rest. Three aspects of <b>fluid</b> <b>shifts</b> that can affect volume measurements are: first, the <b>shift</b> of <b>fluid</b> that occurs whenever there is a change from upright to a recumbent position and vice versa; second, the potential for fluid accumulation in the lower limbs resulting from muscle damage caused by overextending atrophied muscle or swelling caused by deconditioned precapillary sphincter muscles during reambulation; third, the net change of hydration level during and after bed rest or spaceflight. Because of these transitory <b>fluid</b> <b>shifts,</b> muscle protein is expected to represent muscle capacity better than does muscle volume.
