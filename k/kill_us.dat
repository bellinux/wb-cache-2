The document contained a brief list of talking points that were designed to warn Sudan's top government officials about any involvement in alleged plots to <b>kill</b> <b>U.S.</b> diplomats working in Sudan. The alleged threats were based on evidence gathered by a foreign agent retained by the C.I.A., data which {{would be used to}} justify Petterson's reduction of American embassy personnel in Khartoum.

500|$|... "Jump the Shark" [...] {{was written}} by Vince Gilligan, John Shiban, and Frank Spotnitz; it was {{directed}} by Cliff Bole. The episode proved difficult to make.

Executive producer and co-writer Frank Spotnitz had to fight to get the episode made; the studio informed Spotnitz {{that they did not}} want to bring the characters back in any capacity in the ninth season.

[...] Co-writer Gilligan later recalled [...] "The Lone Gunmen was still kind of an open wound for me." [...] Thus, the episode was crafted as a way to wrap up the series.

[...] Nguyen Thong, a former mandarin who fought alongside Định and corresponded with many other guerrilla leaders, agreed with the court records. According to Thong, Định's continued resistance resulted from local initiatives contrary to Huế's explicit instructions. Định's supporters implored him to disobey the edicts of 1862 that directed the partisans to end hostilities: [...] "Our people forced the Westerners to retreat many times, and now that the court has made peace with them, they will surely <b>kill</b> <b>us....</b> Since the court has settled with them, who will support us?

[...] Allmusic reviewer Marisa Brown wrote that the album [...] "doesn't always {{make a lot of}} sense, but that's the beauty of it. It's a kind of concept album that concentrates more on the actual overall sound than the concepts.

500|$|Like Berardinelli, USA Todays Mike Clark thought Bale {{performed}} {{the role of}} Batman {{as well as he}} did Patrick Bateman in American Psycho, but that the relationship between Bruce Wayne and Rachel Dawes was [...] "frustratingly underdeveloped". Kyle Smith thought Bale exhibited [...] "both the menace and the wit he showed in his brilliant turn in American Psycho", and that the film works so well because of the realism, stating, [...] "Batman starts stripping away each layer of Gotham crime only to discover a sicker and more monstrous evil beneath, his rancid city simultaneously invokes early '90s New York, when criminals frolicked to the tune of five murders a day; Serpico New York, when cops were for sale; and today, when psychos seek to <b>kill</b> <b>us</b> all at once rather than one by one." [...] In contrast, Salon.com's Stephanie Zacharek felt Nolan did not deliver the emotional depth expected of [...] "one of the most soulful and tortured superheroes of all"; she thought Bale, unlike Michael Keaton whom she compared him to, failed to connect with the audience underneath the mask, but that Gary Oldman succeeded in [...] "emotional complexity" [...] where the rest of the movie failed.|$|E

[...] Narendra said, [...] "We will appeal in High Court for death penalty to the main accused, Ganga Raj. We respect the court's decision but he should be punished so that the instigators of the crime get the punishment. Also it is important that it is a very clear message so that no khap gives such directions, ever." [...] Seema seconded Narendra's concerns, [...] "We would have been happier if the main accused was also given the death sentence.

500|$|While the Doctor alters part of {{the command}} module of Apollo 11, Canton and Amy visit a nearby orphanage, hoping to find where {{the girl in the}} {{spacesuit}} was taken from. Amy discovers a nest of the Silence, and a photograph of her and a baby amongst pictures of the little girl from the space suit. The girl enters with the Silence, and Amy is abducted and taken to their time engine control room. Arriving too late, the Doctor and his allies find Amy's recording device, through which Rory still can hear Amy's voice confessing her love for one of the group. Canton is able to shoot and wound one of the creatures, and from it the Doctor discovers the creatures are the Silence, a group he was warned about by several of his foes in his recent adventures. Analysing the now-empty space suit, River realises that the girl possesses incredible strength to have forced her way out of it, and that the suit's advanced life-support technology would have called the President as the highest authority figure on Earth when the girl got scared. The Doctor realises why the Silence have been controlling humanity— by guiding their technological advances, they have influenced humanity into the Space Race for purposes of building a spacesuit, which must somehow be crucial to their intentions. Meanwhile, Canton interrogates the captured Silent in the Area 51 prison, who mocks humanity for treating him when [...] "...you should <b>kill</b> <b>us</b> all on sight". Canton records this using Amy's mobile phone.|$|E
500|$|Originally titled as [...] "What Doesn't Kill You", [...] "Stronger" [...] {{was written}} by Jörgen Elofsson, Ali Tamposi, David Gamson, and Greg Kurstin in September 2010. In an {{interview}} with American Songwriter, Tamposi revealed that the song {{was inspired by the}} Friedrich Nietzsche adage ("That which does not <b>kill</b> <b>us</b> makes us stronger") that her mother told her as advice. Although Tamposi found the phrase as saccharine, she submitted it as an idea to Elofsson and Gamson during their writing sessions. Elofsson originally intended [...] "Stronger" [...] for Leona Lewis, who turned it down in the process. Tamposi's manager, Tom Maffei, then had one of his producers, Matty Trump, to produce a demo track later to be pitched to RCA A executive Jeff Aldrich, who later gave the song to Clarkson. Tamposi revealed that Clarkson had also altered a lyric from the track. Aldrich had then commissioned Greg Kurstin, whom Clarkson wanted to collaborate with, to produce and add additional writing to the final version. Kurstin recalled, [...] "I rethought the music part of it, I guess. It had a different tempo, beat, chords, and I kinda just came up with that guitar riff that goes into the verse, {{and that was the first}} thing that I kinda contributed just changed the feel of the song." [...] The song's uplifting theme of empowerment led Clarkson to name her fifth studio album Stronger. saying that it is one of her favorite songs in the album, she said, [...] "Everybody loves the message 'What doesn't kill you makes you stronger.' It's a perfect representation of my life." ...|$|E
