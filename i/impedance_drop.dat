40|$|Intraluminal impedance, a nonradiological {{method for}} {{assessing}} bolus flow within the gut, may {{be suitable for}} investigating pharyngeal disorders. This study evaluated an impedance technique {{for the detection of}} pharyngeal bolus flow during swallowing. Patterns of pharyngoesophageal pressure and impedance were simultaneously recorded with videofluoroscopy in 10 healthy volunteers during swallowing of liquid, semisolid, and solid boluses. The timing of bolus head and tail passage recorded by fluoroscopy was correlated with the timing of <b>impedance</b> <b>drop</b> and recovery at each recording site. Bolus swallowing produced a drop in impedance from baseline followed by a recovery to at least 50 % of baseline. The timing of the pharyngeal and esophageal <b>impedance</b> <b>drop</b> correlated with the timing of the arrival of the bolus head. In the pharynx, the timing of impedance recovery was delayed relative to the timing of clearance of the bolus tail. In contrast, in the upper esophageal sphincter (UES) and proximal esophagus, the timing of impedance recovery correlated well with the timing of clearance of the bolus tail. Impedance-based estimates of pharyngoesophageal bolus clearance time correlated with true pharyngoesophageal bolus clearance time. Patterns of intraluminal impedance recorded in the pharynx during bolus swallowing are therefore more complex than those in the esophagus. During swallowing, mucosal contact between the tongue base and posterior pharyngeal wall prolongs the duration of pharyngeal <b>impedance</b> <b>drop,</b> leading to overestimation of bolus tail timing. Therefore, we conclude that intraluminal impedance measurement does not accurately reflect the bolus transit in the pharynx but does accurately reflect bolus transit across the UES and below.

40|$|AIM: To {{assess the}} impact of bolus volume on the {{characteristics}} of small intestinal (SI) impedance signals. METHODS: Concurrent SI manometry-impedance measurements were performed on 12 healthy volunteers to assess the pattern of proximal jejunal fluid bolus movement over a 14 cm-segment. Each subject was given 34 boluses of normal saline (volume from 1 to 30 mL) via the feeding tube placed immediately above the proximal margin of the studied segment. A bolus-induced impedance event occurred if there was > 12 % <b>impedance</b> <b>drop</b> from baseline, over ≥ 3 consecutive segments within 10 s of bolus injection. A minor or major impedance event was defined as a duration of <b>impedance</b> <b>drop</b> < 60 s or ≥ 60 s, respectively. RESULTS: The minimum volume required for a detectable SI impedance event was 2 mL. A direct linear relationship between the SI bolus volume and the occurrence of impedance events was noted until SI bolus volume reached 10 mL, a volume which always produced an impedance flow event. There was a moderate correlation between the bolus volume and the duration of <b>impedance</b> <b>drop</b> (r = 0. 63, P < 0. 0001) and the number of propagated channels (r = 0. 50, P < 0. 0001). High volume boluses were associated with more major impedance events (≥ 10 mL boluses = 63 %, 3 mL boluses = 17 %, and < 3 mL boluses = 0 %, P = 0. 02). CONCLUSION: Bolus volume {{had an impact on the}} type and length of propagation of SI impedance events and a threshold of 2 mL is required to produce an event.

40|$|The {{ability to}} record {{signals from the}} brain has wide {{reaching}} applications in medicine {{and the study of}} the brain. Currently long term neural recording is precluded by the formation of scar tissue around the electrodes inserted into the brain. Conducting polymers present a possible solution to this problem as their biocompatibility and low stiffness could improve the quality of the interface between the electrode and the brain. In order to assess the long term stability of conducting polymers, electrodes are fabricated from polypyrrole using a variety of dopants to improve conductivity. These electrodes are then immersed in artificial cerebrospinal fluid while impedance measurements are taken over a period of days. The impedance of the electrodes increases rapidly for the first 40 hours before leveling off with only a slow increase in impedance being observed over the next 80 hours. When the ends of the electrodes are trimmed the <b>impedance</b> <b>drops</b> and then undergoes an accelerated rise and levels off. An experiment on the dimensional changes of the polypyrrole reveals that the polymer shrinks when placed into the solution. This may affect the integrity of the electrode and contribute to the increasing impedance.

METHODS: We studied 20 patients (30 - 95 years old) with suspected aspiration who were referred for videofluoroscopy, along with controls (ages 24 - 47 years). The pharyngeal phase of liquid bolus swallowing was recorded with manometry and impedance. Data from the first swallow of a bolus and subsequent clearing swallows were analyzed. We scored fluoroscopic evidence of aspiration and investigated a range of computationally derived functional variables. Of these, 4 stood out as having high diagnostic value: peak pressure (PeakP), pressure at nadir impedance (PNadImp), time from nadir impedance to peak pressure (TNadImp-PeakP), and the interval of <b>impedance</b> <b>drop</b> in the distal pharynx (flow interval). RESULTS: During 54 liquid, first swallows and 40 clearing swallows, aspiration was observed in 35 (13 patients). Compared to those of controls, patient swallows were characterized by a lower PeakP, higher PNadImp, longer flow interval, and shorter TNadImp-PeakP. A Swallow Risk Index (SRI), designed to identify dysfunctions associated with aspiration, was developed from iterative evaluations of variables. The average first swallow SRI correlated with the average aspiration score (r = 0. 846, P <. 00001 for Spearman Rank Correlation). An average SRI of 15, when used as a cutoff, predicted aspiration during fluoroscopy for this cohort (kappa = 1. 0).

However, the development of ceramic electrolyte batteries faces several challenges at the electrode/electrolyte interfaces, which need to withstand high current densities to enable competing C-rates. In this work, we investigate {{the limits of the}} anode/electrolyte interface in a full cell that includes a Li-metal anode, LiFePO 4 cathode, and garnet ceramic electrolyte. The addition of a liquid interfacial layer between the cathode and the ceramic electrolyte is found to be a prerequisite to achieve low interfacial resistance and to enable full use of the active material contained in the porous electrode. Reproducible and constant discharge capacities are extracted from the cathode active material during the first 20 cycles, revealing high efficiency of the garnet as electrolyte and the interfaces, but prolonged cycling leads to abrupt cell failure. By using a combination of structural and chemical characterization techniques, such as SEM and solid-state NMR, as well as electrochemical and impedance spectroscopy, it is demonstrated that a sudden <b>impedance</b> <b>drop</b> occurs in the cell due to the formation of metallic Li and its propagation within the ceramic electrolyte. This degradation process is originated at the interface between the Li-metal anode and the ceramic electrolyte layer and leads to electromechanical failure and cell short-circuit.

This pa-per introduces a new method for measuring the maximum pressure that can be withstood by BLMs formed over a porous substrate. This quantity, re-ferred to as the failure pressure, has not been re-ported in the literature previously. In this series of experiments a BLM is formed across a single pore and is then pressurized until failure. This experiment is performed on 1 -Stearoyl- 2 -Oleoyl-sn-Glycero- 3 -Phosphocholine (SOPC) lipid bilayers formed over a polycarbonate substrate with a sin-gle pore ranging from 5 to 20 µm in diameter. A trend of increasing failure pressure with decreasing pore size is observed, with failure pressures falling between 67 and 19 kPa, respectively. The same set of experiments is repeated for BLMs that are formed from a mixture of SOPC and 50 mol % cholesterol (CHOL) and this is found to increase the failure pressure by 56 % on average. A plate model, a planar membrane model, and a spherical membrane model are used to show that the behavior of the BLMs is more membrane-like than plate-like, with a rela-tionship between failure pressure Pf and pore size a of Pf ∝ 1 /a. Also a quantitative model of the characteristic pressure curve from this experiment is developed based on the pressurization and flow of fluid in the test fixture. This model accurately re-produces the pressure curve of a BLM which includes an initial increase in pressure when the BLM is well formed across a pore, followed by a sharp drop in pressure after the BLM fails.

The aim {{of this study was to}} evaluate impedance flow interval, a novel parameter, in relation to bolus residue and the occurrence of aspiration. The effect of catheter configuration was also assessed. METHODS: We studied 12 children (1. 8 - 13. 5 years) with cerebral palsy, who were all referred for a videofluoroscopy due to suspected aspiration risk. Pharyngeal impedance patterns during bolus swallowing were recorded simultaneously with fluoroscopy. Two different catheter configurations were used: Catheter 1, 1. 9 mm diameter with 1 cm electrodes and Catheter 2, 3. 2 mm diameter with 2 cm electrodes. The flow interval was based on the objective assessment of <b>impedance</b> <b>drop</b> and recovery across multiple impedance segments and was correlated with fluoroscopic evidence of postswallow bolus residue and deglutitive aspiration. KEY RESULTS: One hundred and thirty two liquid swallows were evaluated. Patient swallows with aspiration compared to those without aspiration had a longer flow interval (Cath 1 P= 0. 005; Cath 2 P< 0. 001). Patient swallows with residue had a longer flow interval, however this was only significant for swallows recorded using Catheter 2 (P= 0. 004). Multiple logistic regressions showed that higher flow interval was a better marker of the presence of aspiration [odds ratio (OR) 13. 4 (3. 0, 59. 2); P< 0. 001] than the presence of residue [OR 3. 8 (1. 4, 10. 3); P= 0. 01].

METHODS: We studied 23 adult and pediatric dysphagic {{patients who were}} all referred for a videofluoroscopy, and compared these patients with 10 adult controls. The pharyngeal phase of swallowing of semisolid boluses was recorded with manometry and impedance. Fluoroscopic evidence of postswallow bolus residue was scored. Pharyngeal pressure impedance profiles were analyzed. Computational algorithms measured peak pressure (Peak P), pressure at nadir impedance (PNadImp), time from nadir impedance to PeakP (PNadImp–PeakP), the duration of <b>impedance</b> <b>drop</b> in the distal pharynx (flow interval), upper esophaghageal sphincter (UES) relaxation interval (UES-RI), nadir UES pressure (NadUESP), UES intrabolus pressure (UES-IBP), and UES resistance. A swallow risk index (SRI) was derived by the formula: SRI=(FI × PNadImp) /(PeakP × (TNadImp-PeakP+ 1)) × 100. RESULTS: In all, 76 patient swallows (35 with residue) and 39 control swallows (12 with residue) were analyzed. Different functional variables {{were found to be}} altered in relation to residue. In both controls and patients, flow interval was longer in relation to residue. In controls, but not patients, residue was associated with an increased PNadImp (suggestive of increased pharyngeal IBP). Controls with residue had increased UES-IBP, NadUESP, and UES resistance compared with patients with residue. Residue in patients was related to a prolonged UES-RI. The SRI was elevated in relation to residue in both controls and patients and an average SRI of 9 was optimally predictive of residue (sensitivity 75 % and specificity 80 %). CONCLUSIONS: We present novel findings in control subjects and dysphagic patients showing that combined manometry and impedance recordings can be objectively analyzed to derive pressure-flow variables that are altered in relation to the bolus residual and can be combined to predict ineffective pharyngeal swallowing.

50|$|In {{digital and}} radio {{frequency}} PCBs, {{the major reason}} for using large ground planes is to reduce electrical noise and interference through ground loops and to prevent crosstalk between adjacent circuit traces. When digital circuits switch state, large current pulses flow from the active devices (transistors or integrated circuits) through the ground circuit. If the power supply and ground traces have significant <b>impedance,</b> the voltage <b>drop</b> across them may create noise voltage pulses that disturb {{other parts of the}} circuit (ground bounce). The large conducting area of the ground plane has much lower impedance than a circuit trace, so the current pulses cause less disturbance.|$|R
40|$|AIM: To apply a new method, {{pharyngeal}} automated impedance manometry (AIM), as {{an objective}} assessment tool of swallow function relevant to aspiration in {{a cohort of}} pediatric patients with dysphagia. Methods: We studied 20 children (mean age 6 yrs (5 mo- 13. 4 yrs)) referred for videofluoroscopy to assess aspiration risk with simultaneous manometry-impedance. Fluoroscopic evidence of aspiration was scored using a validated aspiration-penetration score (PAS). Swallowing of 5 ml and/or 10 ml saline boluses was recorded with a solid state pressure-impedance catheter. AIMplot software was used to derive the swallow risk index (SRI) and other functional variables (Omari et al 2011) : peak pressure, pressure at nadir impedance, time from nadir impedance to peak pressure, the interval of <b>impedance</b> <b>drop</b> in the distal pharynx (flow interval, UES relaxation interval, nadir UES pressure, UES intrabolus pressure and UES resistance. In addition UES nadir impedance was measured as a correlate of UES diameter and the integrated ratio of nadir impedance to impedance was measured as a marker of post swallow residue. Data for all recorded liquid swallows were averaged for each individual. Non-parametric grouped data are presented as medians [IQrange] or as mean±standard deviation and compared using Mann-Whitney Rank Sum Test. For multiple comparisons Kruskal-Wallis ANOVA on ranks with pair-wise multiple analysis procedures (Dunn's method) was used. Correlation was determined using a Spearman Rank Order Correlation. Results: Six of twenty children presented with deglutitive aspiration on videofluoroscopy. Of 58 liquid swallows analysed, in 9 aspiration was observed. Multiple logistic regression identified longer flow interval (p< 0. 05) and higher SRI (p< 0. 05) and increased pressure in the UES during maximal bolus flow (p< 0. 05) as the dominant risk variables predictive of aspiration in children. Each of these non-radiologically derived pressure-flow variables correlated with higher aspiration scores on videofluoroscopy (p< 0. 01). Conclusions: We present novel, preliminary findings in children with deglutitive aspiration suggesting that pharyngeal AIM can non-radiologically detect alterations in pressure-flow characteristics of swallowing that predispose to aspiration risk. status: publishe...|$|E
40|$|AbstractEpilepsy affects {{approximately}} 50 {{million people}} worldwide, and 20 – 30 % {{of these cases}} are refractory to antiepileptic drugs. Many patients with intractable epilepsy can benefit from surgical resection of the tissue generating the seizures; however, difficulty in precisely localising seizure foci has limited {{the number of patients}} undergoing surgery as well as potentially lowered its effectiveness. Here we demonstrate a novel imaging method for monitoring rapid changes in cerebral tissue impedance occurring during interictal and ictal activity, and show that it can reveal the propagation of pathological activity in the cortex. Cortical impedance was recorded simultaneously to ECoG using a 30 -contact electrode mat placed on the exposed cortex of anaesthetised rats, in which interictal spikes (IISs) and seizures were induced by cortical injection of 4 -aminopyridine (4 -AP), picrotoxin or penicillin. We characterised the tissue impedance responses during IISs and seizures, and imaged these responses in the cortex using Electrical Impedance Tomography (EIT). We found a fast, transient drop in impedance occurring as early as 12 ms prior to the IISs, followed by a steep rise in impedance within ~ 120 ms of the IIS. EIT images of these impedance changes showed that they were co-localised and centred at a depth of 1 mm in the cortex, and that they closely followed the activity propagation observed in the surface ECoG signals. The fast, pre-IIS <b>impedance</b> <b>drop</b> most likely reflects synchronised depolarisation in a localised network of neurons, and the post-IIS impedance increase reflects the subsequent shrinkage of extracellular space caused by the intense activity. EIT could also be used to picture a steady rise in tissue impedance during seizure activity, which has been previously described. Thus, our results demonstrate that EIT can detect and localise different physiological changes during interictal and ictal activity and, in conjunction with ECoG, may in future improve the localisation of seizure foci in the clinical setting...|$|E
40|$|Duodenal acid {{clearance}} {{appears to}} be involved {{not only in the}} pathogenesis of duodenal ulcer disease but also in functional dyspepsia. Duodenal contractile activity can help to maintain neutral pH in the duodenum by mixing acid with bicarbonate or by aborally transporting the acid load. Intraluminal impedance recording, allowing the detection of nonacid liquid boluses, can be carried out concomitantly with antroduodenal manometry and pH recording and may thus provide useful information about the mechanisms involved in duodenal clearance of endogenous acid and volume boluses. Eight H. pylori-negative healthy volunteers were studied with two catheters positioned across the pylorus, allowing the recording of five impedance signals (one antral, one pyloric, and three duodenal) simultaneously with six pressure signals (two antral, one pyloric, and three duodenal) as well as distal antral and proximal duodenal pH. During phase II of the migrating motor complex, which is known {{to be associated with the}} highest duodenal acid exposure, each duodenal acidification event (defined as a pH drop > 2 pH units) was characterized by its maximal amplitude, duration, temporal relationship with antroduodenal manometric events, and relation to impedance variations. Acid was considered to have been cleared from the duodenum when the preacidification pH was restored (+/- 0. 2 unit). A total of 164 duodenal pH drops were recorded during the 323 min of phase II recordings. Eleven percent of the duodenal acidification events were short-lived (< 10 sec). All of these events were temporally associated with a propagated antroduodenal contraction and a short-lived drop in impedance, suggesting rapid aboral passage of the acid bolus. The long-lived duodenal acidification events lasted a mean of 32 sec (range, 25 - 66 sec). In 90 % of these events an antroduodenal propagated contraction was recorded at the time of onset. Repetitive duodenal contractions followed the onset of the long-lived acidification events in 34 % of the cases. These remained present until complete clearance of the acid. In 81 % of the long-lived acidification events, recovery of the associated <b>impedance</b> <b>drop</b> occurred simultaneously with the pH recovery, suggesting a complete clearance of the bolus. Less frequently (19 %), the duodenal pH recovered while the impedance remained low, suggesting that the bolus was not cleared but neutralized. Interdigestive duodenal acidification events usually last about 30 sec. They evoke duodenal contractions in only one-third of cases. Combined pH and impedance recording makes it possible to distinguish between neutralization of acid boluses and their complete total clearanc...|$|E
30|$|Oedema {{indicates}} a malfunction of the circulatory system. Arterial pressure causes blood to {{flow to the}} arm, and a pumping mechanism is needed for the return flow of venous blood and lymphatic fluid [2]. Simons et al. [10] demonstrated three synergistic independent venous pumping systems in the hand: the superficial palmar, deep palmar and dorsal veins, which are activated by palm compression, isometric intrinsic muscle contraction and dorsal compression. Normal movements of the hand and arm provide the impetus to push the fluid towards the axilla, through numerous valves in the afferent vessels. Postoperatively, these normal movements cease or are inhibited, and the pneumatic compression device mimics the natural physiological process that maintains the blood circulation. Kilgour et al. [11] demonstrated that the forearm vascular resistance measured by electrical <b>impedance</b> plethysmography <b>drops</b> after local hand cooling during the first 30 s of cooling, and then gradually rises to reach peak levels between 5 and 6 min of cooling. This study shows that the A-V impulse system is significantly more effective than cryotherapy {{in the treatment of}} postoperative oedema of the hand. Berlin et al. [12] showed in a retrospective analysis of a large population the acute volume reduction in the affected hand and arm in postmastectomy lymphoedema.|$|R
40|$|Abstract. A sandwich-type bipolar {{membrane}} (BPM) was prepared by a paste method, consisted of an anionic layer, a cationic layer and a catalytic intermediate layer. Carboxymethylcellulose (CMC) and chitosan (CS) were modified by Fe 3 + and glutaraldehyde respectively {{to prepare the}} mCMC/mCS BPM. Semiconductor photocatalyst combined with photosensitizes was applied to improve the water dissociation at the intermediate layer of the {{bipolar membrane}}, using nanometer-sized titanium dioxide (TiO 2) as a photocatalyst and anthraquinone (Anth) as a photosensitize. The impedance of bipolar membrane {{and the performance of}} hydrolysis influenced by the composite catalytic center were studied. The sandwich-type BPM exhibited several good properties, such as higher efficiency for the water splitting at the intermediate layer, protons and hydroxyl ions permeabilities, higher operational current density as well as lower <b>impedance</b> and potential <b>drop.</b> Under the UV illumination, the corresponding voltage reached as low as 5. 0 V when the operational current density was 125 mA/cm...|$|R
40|$|In {{the dairy}} industry, raw milk samples {{collected}} for quality testing {{should be tested}} or refrigerated immediately to control bacterial growth. A thermistor cryoscope is used to accurately determine the freezing point depression (FPD) of raw milk. Milk containing extraneous amounts of water will have a grossly elevated FPD. Milk that has been spoiled or adulterated with other sources, such as sugar, salt, or milk powder, will depress the freezing point, potentially masking the addition of added water. The pH of milk is a general measure of acidity in the sample. Lower pH values indicate an acidification process such as bacterial spoilage. Impedance methods monitor changes in the metabolic processes and will measure lactic acid as a by-product of lactose, for example. The {{purpose of this study}} was to show the effects that storage conditions have on FPD, pH, and impedance of raw milk. In two identical experiments, 20 raw milk samples were stored at 20 - 25 °C, and 20 at 2 - 8 °C, for 168 hours. All samples were tested at numerous intervals throughout this time period. Spoiled and unspoiled milk samples generated similar results using all 3 methods up to 24 hours of storage. Between 24 and 48 hours, the FPD of the spoiled milk was erroneously depressed by an average of 102. 4 m°C, the pH was lowered by an average of 1. 19 units, and the <b>impedance</b> measurement <b>dropped</b> by an average of 19. 1 ohms. The FPD, pH, and impedance data collected generally indicate that raw milk samples with or without refrigeration can be tested up to 24 hours without showing an appreciable shift in response due to bacterial spoilage...|$|R
