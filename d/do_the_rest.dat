On the way home, a {{sturgeon}} falls from the sky (implicitly from the space station Mir) onto the family car's hood, which is severely damaged. Homer and Bart start their magic show {{as a way to}} make money, but the act becomes a failure, and Homer leaves Bart to <b>do</b> <b>the</b> <b>rest</b> of the act on his own.

500|$|In May 2012, Malcolm Young {{confirmed}} that the band were working on a potential follow-up to 2008's Black Ice. But he warned that fans were in for a longer wait than expected, after lead singer Brian Johnson suggested there would be new material the next year. Malcolm stated, [...] "You know what Brian's like. He just says things and then walks away. It'll be a little while– {{a year or two}} anyway. I've been doing some jamming on some song ideas but I do that all the time, as <b>do</b> <b>the</b> <b>rest</b> of the band. We are still working.

Ross photographed all the series' sets as reference footage to work from in case a visual effect shot was ultimately required, explaining, [...] "Sometimes while looking at the assembly I’ll realize we need another shot but there isn’t any coverage that works.

With engineer Doug Grean, Weiland rearranged the music to fit his vocals, eventually coming out with the songs [...] "Big Machine" [...] and [...] "Dirty Little Thing". The band worked on new material for songs such as [...] "You Got No Right", [...] "Slither", [...] "Sucker Train Blues", and [...] "Do It for the Kids", among others. It was during this time that Weiland was arrested at {{the parking lot of}} his studio for drug possession. Upon release from jail, he wrote lyrics to material he was given previously, writing the lyrics to the song [...] "Fall to Pieces". Velvet Revolver soon began recording their debut album. Initially, they recorded [...] "Slither" [...] with producer Bob Ezrin at Henson Studios, but were dissatisfied with the result.

South Africa, under Wessels' leadership, controlled {{most of the}} match but fell for 148 chasing 201 for victory in the final innings. This was blamed on remarkable bowling from the West Indian pacemen, with one reporter commenting; 'They [...] pitched everything on off stump and let a pitch stricken by multiple-personality disorder <b>do</b> <b>the</b> <b>rest.</b> Each perfect delivery was followed by another perfect delivery. It was as if Richie Richardson had found a loophole in the laws {{that allowed him to}} unleash the same unplayable bowler from both ends. Fittingly, that Wambrose bloke ended up with 10 wickets.' Wessels contributed 59 and 74 in this Test.|$|E
2500|$|The lead single, had an on air, on sale release, Roberts {{stated that}} Universal Records wanted {{to release the}} track that way, {{as it was the}} way they were {{releasing}} all of their new work. The release of this nature, was due to illegal downloading, and the record label was attempting to avoid illegal downloads as much as possible as Roberts stated, [...] "it's now harder for artists". Talking of Girls Aloud, Roberts stated she was used to releasing a song after around six weeks of promotion, including radio, television and press promotion, and commented that it was [...] "very scary" [...] to release a song without this publicity. She also noted the effect of this kind of release against chart positions, she said, [...] "I think it's harder for the public now because it's always been about the chart position. I also think it takes the excitement out of the charts because it's not a competition anymore." [...] The album artwork and track-listing were confirmed on 22 August 2011 on Roberts official website, the announcement came with confirmation that fans who pre-ordered the album on Play.com would receive a signed poster, and those who pre-ordered the song from digital store iTunes would have an exclusive highlight video montage of her webisode series Through Nicola's Eyes. Roberts performed at G-A-Y, after rehearsing the entire day prior to the event during which time she changed her set-list around, performing the track [...] "Everybody's Got to Learn Sometime" [...] with a drum and bass edit, in addition to performing a remix of her single [...] "Lucky Day". For the performance Roberts wore five-foot hair extensions that touched the ground, which proved restricting for her movements, in addition to wearing shorts with [...] "big pompoms on the back". Writing as a guest blogger for site Holy Moly, Roberts discussed the event saying [...] "the crowd was incredible. I had to take my in-ears out because they were so loud I thought, ‘They’re gonna deafen me and I’m not gonna be able to <b>do</b> <b>the</b> <b>rest</b> of my set’. I was so taken aback, it was amazing. Such a good atmosphere; everyone wanted to have a good time".|$|E
