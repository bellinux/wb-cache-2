25|$|A Snyder {{column is}} an {{extremely}} effective air-cooled column used in selected fractional distillations. It is a single glass tube {{with a series of}} circular indentations/restrictions in the walls of the cylinder (e.g., 3 or 6) in which rest, inverted, the same number of roughly tear-shaped, hollow, sealed glass stoppers; above each point where an inverted tear-shaped stopper rests, the cylinder has further Vigreux-type indentations, in this case serving to limit how high the <b>glass</b> <b>stopper</b> can be raised (by vapor flow) above its resting place, where, when not raised, it seals the circular opening created by the circular indentation. These floating glass stoppers act as check valves, closing and opening with vapor flow, and enhancing vapor-condensate mixing. A standard application of Snyder columns, is as the condenser/fractionation column above a Kuderna-Danish concentrator, used to efficiently separate a low boiling extraction solvent such as methylene chloride from volatile but higher boiling extract components (e.g., after the extraction of organic contaminants in soil).|$|E

Was it not this thick, reeking liquid with which jealous women had been known to mar the beauty of their rivals? My heart stood still as I held the bottle to the light. Thank God, it was full! No mischief had been done as yet. But had Agatha come in a minute sooner, was it not certain that the hellish parasite within me would have dashed the stuff into her---- Ah, it will not bear to be thought of! But {{it must have been}} for that. Why else should I have brought it? At the thought of what I might have done my worn nerves broke down, and I sat shivering and twitching, the pitiable wreck of a man.|$|E
60|$|He {{opened an}} old cabinet, {{and took out}} a long narrow bottle of dark-blue glass. In form, it was quaintly and remarkably unlike any modern bottle that I had ever seen. The <b>glass</b> <b>stopper</b> was {{carefully}} secured by a piece of leather, for the better preservation, I suppose, of the liquid inside. Down one side of the bottle ran a narrow strip of paper, notched at regular intervals to indicate the dose that was to be given. No label appeared on it; but, examining the surface of the glass carefully, I found certain faintly-marked stains, which suggested that the label might have been removed, and that some traces of the paste or gum by which it had been secured had not been completely washed away. I held the bottle up to the light, and found that it was still nearly half full. Mr. Engelman forbade me to remove the stopper. It was very important, he said, that no air should be admitted to the bottle, except when there was an actual necessity for administering the remedy.|$|E
50|$|The Flower-in-the-Bottle line bore Blocki's unique {{presentation}} style {{but he also}} produced several lines of perfume that followed the popular style of the times. His Regal and Bouquet lines of perfume that debuted in the early nineteen hundreds were typical of the Belle Epoque style. They were presented in classic flacons with cut <b>glass</b> <b>stoppers</b> and colorful, embossed labels depicting bold and beautiful women. Many of these perfumes were named after famous operas or historical figures; particularly Prussian and Polish noble families given his heritage.|$|R

60|$|Here, {{after more}} consideration, he took down {{one out of}} the row of large {{chemical}} bottles before him, filled with a yellow liquid; placing the bottle on the table, he returned to the cabinet, and opened a side compartment, containing some specimens of Bohemian glass-work. After measuring it with his eye, he took from the specimens a handsome purple flask, high and narrow in form, and closed by a <b>glass</b> <b>stopper.</b> This he filled with the yellow liquid, leaving a small quantity only {{at the bottom of the}} bottle, and locking up the flask again in the place from which he had taken it. The bottle was next restored to its place, after having been filled up with water from the cistern in the Dispensary, mixed with certain chemical liquids in small quantities, which restored it (so far as appearances went) to the condition in which it had been when it was first removed from the shelf. Having completed these mysterious proceedings, the doctor laughed softly, and went back to his speaking-tubes to summon the Resident Dispenser next.|$|E

And while the late steamer Big Missouri worked and sweated in the sun, the retired artist sat on a barrel in the shade close by, dangled his legs, munched his apple, and planned the slaughter of more innocents. There was no lack of material; boys happened along every little while; they came to jeer, but remained to whitewash. By the time Ben was fagged out, Tom had traded the next chance to Billy Fisher for a kite, in good repair; and when he played out, Johnny Miller bought in for a dead rat and a string to swing it with--and so on, and so on, hour after hour. And when {{the middle of the}} afternoon came, from being a poor poverty-stricken boy in the morning, Tom was literally rolling in wealth. He had besides the things before mentioned, twelve marbles, part of a jews-harp, a piece of blue bottle-glass to look through, a spool cannon, a key that wouldn't unlock anything, a fragment of chalk, a <b>glass</b> <b>stopper</b> of a decanter, a tin soldier, a couple of tadpoles, six fire-crackers, a kitten with only one eye, a brass doorknob, a dog-collar--but no dog--the handle of a knife, four pieces of orange-peel, and a dilapidated old window sash.|$|E
6000|$|... "My Dear Miss Hannay: Rujub, the juggler, and I {{will do what}} we can {{to rescue}} you. We are {{powerless}} to effect anything as long as you remain where you are. The bearer, Rujub's daughter, will give you the bottles, one containing lunar caustic, the other nitric acid. The mistress of the zenana, who wants to get rid of you, as she fears you might obtain influence over the Nana, has asked the girl to obtain from her father a philter which will make you odious to him. The large bottle is perfectly harmless, and you can drink its contents without fear. The caustic is for applying to your lips; it will be painful, but I am sure you will not mind that, and the injury will be only of a temporary nature. I cannot promise as much for the nitric acid; pray apply it very carefully, merely moistening the <b>glass</b> <b>stopper</b> and applying it with that. I should use it principally round the lips. It will burn and blister the skin. The Nana will be told that you have a fever, which is causing a terrible and disfiguring eruption. I should apply it also to the neck and hands. Pray be very careful with the stuff; for, besides the application being exceedingly painful, the scars may possibly remain permanently. Keep the two small bottles carefully hidden, in order to renew the application if absolutely necessary. At any rate, this will give us time, and, from what I hear, our troops are likely to be here in another ten days' time. You will be, I know, glad to hear that Wilson has also escaped.|$|E

5000|$|In chemistry, bungs made of {{hardened}} rubber {{are frequently}} used {{in high school}} level demonstrations, or in small-scale experimental set-ups involving non-corrosive gases. Some chemistry bungs may also include one or more holes so a glass tube or laboratory funnel may be inserted through the bung and into the container or another piece of apparatus. The rubber bung {{may be used to}} seal a flask because the user may require the contents to be mixed via shaking the flask or may require that the contents be kept inside the flask and prevented from leaking out. In all cases, the bung keeps the experimentation environment sealed so that liquids or gases cannot escape (or enter).For applications that place higher demand on the bung in terms of temperature and mechanical stability or solvent resistance, standardized <b>glass</b> <b>stoppers</b> and connectors are preferred (see above).|$|R
50|$|Ground {{glass joint}} (or ground <b>glass</b> <b>stoppers)</b> are {{commonly}} used with laboratory glassware, mainly because of their nonreactivity. Some stoppers used in labs have holes in them to allow the insertion of glass or rubber tubing.

For instance, if one were to boil water in a test tube and wanted to collect the water vapor, one could seal the test tube with a stopper with holes in it. With tubing inserted into the hole(s), when the tube is heated, water vapor will rise through the hole, make its way through the tubing, and into the collection chamber of choice.

40|$|ISOHE (1) HAS DESCRIBED a color {{reaction}} {{produced by}} the addi-tion of alcoholic carbazole to uronic acids previously heated in 87 % sulfuric acid. The {{purpose of the present}} report is to apply a modifi-cation of this method to the determination of hyaluronic acid in synovial fluid. The concentration of mucin in synovial fluid has been determined by the turbidity of the mucin clot (2) or by the chemical estimation of the nitrogen or glucosamine content of the precipitated mucin (3). Inconstancy of the coprecipitating protein makes a direct estimate of hyaluronic acid unreliable by this method. Hyaluronic acid has been determined directly from the concentration of glucosamine in protein-free filtrates of synovial fluid (4) but has been reported on relatively few patients.
