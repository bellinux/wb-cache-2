5|$|The Peshwa's {{territory}} {{was in an}} {{area called}} the Desha, {{now part of the}} modern state of Maharashtra. The region consists of the valleys of the Krishna and Godavari rivers and the plateaus of the Sahyadri Mountains. Shinde's territory around Gwalior and Bundelkhand was a region of rolling hills and fertile valleys that slopes <b>down</b> <b>toward</b> the Indo-Gangetic Plain to the north. The Pindari territory was the valleys and forests of the Chambal, the north western region of the modern state of Madhya Pradesh. It was a mountainous region with a harsh climate. The Pindaris also operated from Malwa, a plateau region in the north west of the state of Madhya Pradesh, north of the Vindhya Range. Holkar was based in the upper Narmada River valley.|$|E

25|$|In curved sections, {{the outside}} {{edge of the}} road is superelevated above the centerline. Since the road is sloped <b>down</b> <b>toward</b> the inside of the curve, gravity draws the vehicle toward the inside of the curve. This causes a greater {{proportion}} of centripetal force to supplant the tyre friction that would otherwise be needed to negotiate the curve.|$|E

25|$|Ramifications (1968–69), {{completed}} {{a year before}} the Chamber Concerto, is scored for an ensemble of strings in twelve parts—seven violins, two violas, two cellos and a double bass—each of which may be taken by one player or several. The twelve are divided into two numerically equal groups but with the instruments in the first group tuned approximately a quarter-tone higher (four violins, a viola and a cello). As the group play, the one tuned higher inevitably tends to slide <b>down</b> <b>toward</b> the other, and both get nearer each other in pitch.|$|E

25|$|The last phases {{involved}} {{several major}} lobes: the Des Moines lobe, which flowed <b>down</b> <b>toward</b> Des Moines on the west; the Superior lobe and its sublobes on the north; and the Green Bay lobe and Lake Michigan lobes on the east. The northern and eastern lobes were in part diverted {{around the area}} by the Watersmeet Dome, an ancient uplifted area of Cambrian rock underlain by basalt. The Green Bay and Lake Michigan lobes were also partially blocked by the bedrock of the Door Peninsula, which presently separates Green Bay from Lake Michigan. In earlier phases of the Wisconsinan, the Driftless Area was totally surrounded by ice, with eastern and western lobes joining together {{to the south of}} it.|$|E
25|$|Faced {{with such}} a drastic social experiment, and stunned by its arrest once the President dies, humans are faced with {{complete}} annihilation, as the cold wave progresses <b>down</b> <b>toward</b> the ocean floor. Scientists have to acknowledge yet another threat: that of biological devolution, turning men and women into oversized mollusks. Decision-makers are incapable of finding a global solution, but coalesce into competing factions. Two engineers personify that trend: Whitt suggests moving civilization closer to the inner molten regions; Xavier, inventor of nuclear propulsion, wants spacecraft to resettle humans on another planet. While Whitt and his secretary dig into the seafloor, Xavier and his concubine Olivia (collectively dubbed X-O) make a solitary escape into the cosmos.|$|E
25|$|The {{fight was}} signed for May 22, 1993, and was staged at RFK Stadium in Washington, DC. Ferguson {{came into the}} fight below 230 pounds {{for the first time}} in years and was {{considered}} to be in the best shape of his career. Because the IBF did not consider Ferguson to be a legitimate contender, they would not sanction the defense for Bowe and only the WBA and lineal championships were on the line. Ferguson thought he had a legitimate chance to knock the champion out, but Bowe disregarded his boasts. Ferguson was knocked <b>down</b> <b>toward</b> the end of the first round and barely made it back to his feet at the bell, then was dropped again as the second round began and knocked out.|$|E

25|$|On December 21, 1866, Crazy Horse and {{six other}} warriors, both Lakota and Cheyenne, decoyed Capt. William Fetterman's 53 {{infantry}}men and 27 cavalry troopers under Lt. Grummond into an ambush. They had been sent out from Fort Phil Kearny {{to follow up on}} an earlier attack on a wood train. Crazy Horse lured Fetterman's infantry up a hill. Grummond's cavalry followed the other six decoys along Peno Head Ridge and <b>down</b> <b>toward</b> Peno Creek, where several Cheyenne women taunted the soldiers. Meanwhile, Cheyenne leader Little Wolf and his warriors, who had been hiding {{on the opposite side of}} Peno Head Ridge, blocked the return route to the fort. The Lakota warriors swept over the hill and attacked the infantry. Additional Cheyenne and Lakota hiding in the buckbrush along Peno Creek effectively surrounded the soldiers. Seeing that they were surrounded, Grummond headed his cavalry back to Fetterman.|$|E
25|$|From the {{north-western}} {{corner of}} the pyramid the connecting ridge to Kirk Fell runs out across the col of Beck Head (2,050ft). There is a small tarn in the depression, and sometimes a second after heavy rain. Both are blind, having no apparent inlet or ouflow. Gable Beck runs south from Beck Head, while an unnamed tributary of the Liza flows northward. The main spine of the Western Fells continues along the north east ridge to Green Gable, dropping to Windy Gap (2,460ft) as it rounds the end of Gable Crag. This ridge is rough and rocky, further worn by the boots of countless walkers. Stone Cove lies on the Ennerdale side while the rough gully of Aaron Slack runs <b>down</b> <b>toward</b> Styhead Tarn. The south-eastern ridge provides the connection to the Southern Fells, across the pass of Sty Head. This is a major crossroads for walkers and climbers, the summit being at around 1,560ft. On the opposite slope is Great End in the Scafells. Kern Knotts lies on this south-east ridge, as does the small pool of Dry Tarn. The south-western ridge gives to high level connection, dropping down Gavel Neese in the angle between Lingmell Beck and Gable Beck.|$|E
500|$|Mr. Perfect {{served as}} [...] "executive consultant" [...] to Ric Flair in 1992, but the {{relationship}} broke <b>down</b> <b>toward</b> {{the end of the}} year. The partnership split up when Perfect teamed with Randy Savage to face Flair and Razor Ramon at Survivor Series 1992. Flair legitimately requested a release from his contract, as he felt he would be more successful if he returned to World Championship Wrestling (WCW). WWF owner Vince McMahon agreed and set up a feud between Flair and Perfect to create a storyline for Flair's departure from the company. Many wrestlers were scheduled to compete at the 1993 Royal Rumble but were either replaced or had left the company before the event. Those who were scheduled to compete were Doink the Clown, Crush, Hacksaw Jim Duggan, The Mountie, and Kamala.|$|E

500|$|The {{position}} where Cornwallis hid his army was well-chosen. [...] To the left, impassable swampy terrain sloped <b>down</b> <b>toward</b> the river. [...] To the right, {{there was more}} marshy ground and a few ponds. [...] The access {{from the rest of}} the mainland toward the ferry was via a [...] causeway from the Green Spring Plantation that was surrounded by marshlands that an advancing army would have to negotiate. [...] The earl arranged his army in two lines, with the 76th and 80th regiments along with part of the 43rd and Banastre Tarleton's British Legion on the left, and the Brigade of Guards, and Hessian auxiliaries on the right. [...] Both wings also included light infantry companies. [...] Cornwallis left a small company of German jägers and a few men from the Legion to give the appearance of a rear guard picket, and gave them specific orders to resist the American advance as much as possible.|$|E
500|$|Resembling a brown wooden top, the {{epigeous}} (aboveground) {{fruit body}} may {{be up to}} 6cm (2.4in) high. The cap, initially convex then more funnel-shaped (infundibuliform) with a depressed centre and rolled rim (hence the common name), may be reddish-, yellowish- or olive-brown in colour and typically 4–12cm (1.6–5in) wide; the cap diameter does not get larger than [...] The cap surface is initially downy and later smooth, becoming sticky when wet. The cap and capmargin initially serve to protect the gills of young fruit bodies: this is termed pilangiocarpic development. The narrow brownish yellow gills are decurrent and forked, and can be peeled easily from the flesh (as {{is the case with}} the pores of boletes). Gills further <b>down</b> <b>toward</b> the stipe become more irregular and anastomose, and can even resemble the pores of bolete-type fungi. The fungus darkens when bruised and older specimens may have darkish patches. The juicy yellowish flesh has a mild to faintly sour or sharp odor and taste, and has been described as well-flavored upon cooking. Of similar colour to the cap, the short stipe can be crooked and tapers toward the base.|$|E
500|$|The Furnace Creek Fault system, {{located in}} what is now the {{northern}} part of Death Valley, started to move about 14 Ma and the Southern Death Valley Fault system likely began to move by 12 million years ago. Both fault systems move with a right-lateral offset along strike-slip faults; these type of faults rub past each other so that a theoretical observer standing on one side facing the other side sees it move right. Both fault systems run parallel to and {{at the base of the}} ranges. Very often the same faults move laterally and vertically, simultaneously making them strike-slip and normal (i.e. oblique-slip). These two systems are also offset from each other; the area between the offset is thus put under enormous oblique tension, which intensifies subsidence there; Furnace Creek Basin opened in this area and the rest of Death Valley followed in stages. [...] One of the last stages was the formation of Badwater Basin, which occurred by about 4 Ma. [...] Data from gravimeters show that Death Valley's bedrock floor tilts <b>down</b> <b>toward</b> the east and is deepest under Badwater Basin; there is [...] of fill under Badwater. By about 2 Ma Death Valley, Panamint Valley and their associated ranges were formed.|$|E

500|$|The train departs {{the station}} {{to the right and}} climbs a small lift leading to a short drop, then circles around to the [...] lift hill, {{carrying}} the riders into the [...] mountain. It is the tallest attraction at Walt Disney World, beating The Twilight Zone Tower of Terror by 6 inches. Disney keeps it just under 200 feet because law requires structures 200 feet or taller to have a blinking red light as a beacon for low-flying planes, which Disney feels would take parkgoers out of the experience. On the way up it passes through a ransacked temple with murals of the yeti, warning the riders that the mountain is his territory. At {{the top of the mountain}} the train curves around the main peak and goes through a cave. When it emerges, it draws to a halt in front of track that has been torn apart, presumably by the yeti. The train itself is held in place by a series of rubber tires while an automatic switch rotates the piece of track directly behind the train. The train then rolls backwards along a new route that spirals down through the mountain, coming to a halt in a large cave, where riders see the yeti's shadow on the wall as he tears up more track. This effect distracts riders from noticing another automatic track switch rotates in front of them. As the shadow moves away, the train rolls forward out of the mountain and down the main [...] drop. It enters a 250° turn and speeds back up through another cave in the mountain, where the roars of the yeti are heard once more. The train exits from the rear of the mountain and enters a large helix before being lifted back into the mountain a final time. The train drops through a cave, where the yeti is reaching <b>down</b> <b>toward</b> it. On reaching the bottom of this drop, riders return to the unloading dock and depart into a gift shop. One ride takes about 2 minutes and 50 seconds.|$|E
