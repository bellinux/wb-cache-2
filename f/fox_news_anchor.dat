25|$|In November 2016, <b>Fox</b> <b>News</b> <b>anchor</b> Megyn Kelly {{wrote in}} her book {{about the details of}} her sexual abuse {{allegations}} against Ailes. According to Kelly, when she first joined Fox News, Ailes would have meetings with her, during which he would make sexual remarks. He also tried to kiss her several times during a closed-door meeting, but she was able to get away and leave the office. After that incident in 2006, Kelly says that Ailes did not sexually harass her again. Then, in 2016, when Gretchen Carlson first made her sexual abuse allegations, Fox pressured Kelly to defend Ailes, which she refused to do.|$|E
