50|$|Half {{of human}} disease {{involving}} Fusarium {{is caused by}} F. solani and it is involved in most cases of systemic <b>fusariosis</b> and corneal infections. F. solani has been implicated in the following diseases: disseminated disease, osteomyelitis, skin infection, fungemia, and endophthalmitis. In immunocompromised patients, F. solani {{is one of the}} most common agents in disseminated and cutaneous infections. Fungal keratitis in the southern USA is most commonly caused by F. solani, as well as F. oxysporum. Cases of fungal keratitis occur most frequently during harvest season as a result of corneal trauma from dust or plant material. Fungal spores come into contact with the damaged cornea and grow. Without treatment, the hyphae can grow into the cornea and into the anterior chamber of the eye. F. solani is also a major cause of fungal keratitis in HIV positive patients in Africa. F. solani was implicated in cases of fungal keratitis involving the Bausch and Lomb ReNu contact lens solution. Some strains of F. solani can produce a biofilm on soft contact lenses. However, when lenses are cleaned correctly with solution, these biofilms are prevented. Prevention also includes leaving lenses in polyhexanide biguanide solution overnight to inhibit F. solani. Other risk factors of contact lens-related Fusarium keratitis include use of daily-wear lenses beyond the recommended timeline and overnight wear.|$|E

40|$|The {{objective}} of this work was to evaluate Fusarium guttiforme inoculation methods and genetic resistance of pineapple accessions. Thus, three experiments were conducted: pathogen inoculation of different leaf types (B, D and F) of pineapple (1), pathogen inoculation of pineapple cuttings and detached D leaves (2), and identification of resistance to <b>fusariosis</b> in 19 pineapple accessions (3) sampled in the State of Mato Grosso, Brazil. The cultivars Pérola (susceptible to <b>fusariosis)</b> and BRS - Vitória (resistant to <b>fusariosis)</b> were used as controls. The <b>fusariosis</b> severity was evaluated at 10, 15, 20, 25 and 30 days after inoculation with F. guttiforme.

40|$|Fusarium is {{the second}} most {{frequent}} mold involved in fungal infections and is particularly important among immunocompromised patients. Culture methods and microscopy are still routinely used in clinical laboratories to identify Fusarium spp., and more sophisticated, timely, and effective methods for detecting Fusarium spp. in laboratory samples could improve the outcome for the patient. These investigational diagnostic approaches include serological assays and specific nested PCR assays that can yield positive and negative predictive values of over 90 %. Other assays in development, such as mass spectroscopy techniques, can provide accurate and consistent results. The treatment of <b>fusariosis</b> in immunocompromised patients remains a challenge and the prognosis of systemic <b>fusariosis</b> in this population remains poor. Successful treatment is highly dependent on the particular Fusarium species involved in the infection. High dose intravenous amphotericin B formulation is recommended as the first line of therapy in management of <b>fusariosis</b> in patients. Voriconazole is also effective in treating <b>fusariosis.</b> Intolerance, contraindication, or failure of the amphotericin B formulation warrants the use of voriconazole as an alternative agent, and posaconazole is licensed as salvage therapy against invasive <b>fusariosis.</b> Adjunctive therapies such as surgical debridement of infected tissue, granulocyte colony stimulating factor (G-CSF) or granulocyte-macrophage colony stimulating factor (GM-CSF) infusions, or granulocyte transfusions are also tools for managing <b>fusariosis.</b> In conclusion, Fusarium infection is considered an emerging problem and should be suspected in immunocompromised patients experiencing systemic infection and should be treated accordingly...|$|E

40|$|AbstractThe fungus Fusarium guttiforme (Syn. F. subglutinans f. sp. ananas) is {{responsible}} for <b>fusariosis,</b> {{one of the main}} phytosanitary threats to pineapple (Ananas comosus var. comosus). A structural study comparing epidermal differences in pineapple cultivars resistant and susceptible to <b>fusariosis</b> was performed, relating properties of the epidermis to known susceptibility to the disease. The basal, non-chlorophylled, portions of mature leaves of pineapple plants were analyzed by light and electron microscopy. All cultivars showed common morpho-anatomic aspects characteristic of Bromeliaceae, such as scutiform scales and unstratified epidermis. However, cultivar Vitoria (resistant) had less scales than cultivars Smooth Cayenne (susceptible, intermediate severity) and Perola (susceptible, with extreme severity of <b>fusariosis</b> symptoms). Inoculation of conidia suspension (105 conidiaml− 1) of the fungus F. guttiforme to leaves and harvesting 24 h later yielded numbers of viable colonies related to the density of leaf scales. This suggests that scales can act as havens for fungal conidia and favour the epiphytic stage of the fungus on pineapple plants, and are involved in the interaction of plant and pathogen. A reduction in scale numbers was related to lower infection levels and is relevant to the future breeding programme for development of new pineapple cultivars resistant to <b>fusariosis</b> and their involvement in integrated control strategies...|$|E
40|$|We have {{evaluated}} and compared the efficacies of {{high doses of}} amphotericin B (AMB; 3 mg/kg of body weight/day), voriconazole (60 mg/kg), and posaconazole (PSC; 100 mg/kg) alone and combined in a murine model of disseminated infection by Fusarium oxysporum. The combination of AMB with PSC showed the best results, prolonging the survival of mice and reducing their organ fungal loads. This combination might constitute a therapeutic option for those infections where monotherapies fail. Disseminated disease is the most frequent and challenging clinical form of <b>fusariosis</b> (13), showing a poor response to antifungals (3, 8, 13, 14). For a long time, conventional therapy for invasive <b>fusariosis</b> has consisted of an amphotericin B (AMB) -based regimen (2, 4, 12). However, clinical practice has demonstrated that this drug has poor activity and shows renal toxicity. Other treatment options include voriconazole (VRC) and posaconazole (PSC), which are indicated for patients with refractory disease or those who are intolerant to certain anti-fungal agents (15, 16). However, {{the use of a}} drug alone to treat systemic <b>fusariosis</b> has not been completely satisfactory (13). Combined therapy could be another option, although its usefulness for the treatment of <b>fusariosis</b> has not yet been investigated. The combination of AMB with VRC has demon-strated some beneficial effects in a murine infection by Fusar-ium solani (19). Clinical data confirmed the usefulness of that combination since it led to clinical improvement before neu-tropenia was reduced in two clinical cases (9, 18).

40|$|AbstractFusarium species {{frequently}} {{implicated in}} human infections include F. solani, F. oxysporum and F. moniliforme. Among immunocompetent patients, tissue breakdown (as caused by trauma, severe burns or foreign body) {{is the risk}} factor for <b>fusariosis.</b> Infections include keratitis, onychomycosis and occasionally peritonitis and cellulitis. Treatment is usually successful and requires removal of the foreign body as well as antifungal therapy. Among immunocompromised patients, mainly patients with haematological malignancies, Fusarium spp. are {{the second most common}} pathogenic mould. Risk factors for disseminated <b>fusariosis</b> include severe immunosuppression (neutropenia, lymphopenia, graft-versus-host disease, corticosteroids), colonisation, tissue damage, and receipt of a graft from an HLA-mismatched or unrelated donor. Clinical presentation includes refractory fever (> 90 %), skin lesions and sino-pulmonary infections (∼ 75 %). Type of skin lesions includes ecthyma-like, target, and multiple subcutaneous nodules. Skin lesions lead to diagnosis in > 50 % of patients and precede fungemia by ∼ 5 days. In contrast to disseminated aspergillosis, disseminated <b>fusariosis</b> can be diagnosed by blood cultures in 40 % of patients.
