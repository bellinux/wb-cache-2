5|$|Rowland ran wide while de Jong {{reversed}} {{onto the}} run-off area. This {{was caused by}} both drivers not gaining optimum brake temperature. De Jong dropped to fifth while Rowland fell to third after the latter was passed by Sirotkin. Armand spun in the seventh corner, triggering the safety car's second appearance. It remained on the track {{for the next three}} laps. On the restart, Matsushita utilised a tactic of backing the field up before driving away. However some drivers accelerated away after passing the safety car line, while others remained at the pace dictated by Matsushita. This resulted in Malja colliding with the rear-end of Evans's car, removing his front wing, and sending debris from it airborne. Malja then hit Rowland in the first corner. He spun but managed to continue. Gelael was forced to collide with the barrier, causing him to retire. The incident resulted in the safety car's third deployment which remained on track for the next two laps. At the lap 13 restart, Marciello got away faster than Matsushita and drove around the <b>inside</b> <b>of</b> <b>him</b> but locked his tyres. The two made contact when they steered into turn one. The incident allowed Gasly to inherit the lead, with teammate Giovinazzi moving into second.|$|E

25|$|Hamilton gained on Rosberg {{and was in}} {{the range}} to use DRS by lap 22 and on the {{following}} lap lined up an pass on his teammate on the back straight but was unable to get ahead. On lap 24, Rosberg selected a setting intended to provide him with additional power to defend against Hamilton of which he did not receive. Hamilton slipstreamed Rosberg on the backstraight, used DRS, and drove alongside his teammate going into turn 12. Rosberg attempted to defend his position but Hamilton steered to the <b>inside</b> <b>of</b> <b>him</b> and overtook him for the lead of the race. Hamilton forced Rosberg onto the turn's run-off area and both drivers narrowly avoided hitting each other and Hamilton began to pull away from his teammate. Alonso batted Button over the previous two laps and overtook him around the outside for seventh place on the same lap. Vergne attacked Grosjean on lap 25 after the latter could not overtake Vettel's slower car. Grosjean attempted a second overtaking manoeuvre on Vettel on the following lap and passed him for ninth at the first turn. Alonso moved into sixth after overtaking Magnussen with a switchback manoeuvre at the first corner. Button lost eighth and ninth positions after Grosjean and Vergne passed him over the next two laps and Button made a pit stop for medium compound tyres on lap 29.|$|E

Thousand Dragon uses this trick to fool Gin and the others into thinking the wolf head is the entrance to Gaia's domain. When Gin tries to enter, Noroi sacrifices himself to leap <b>inside</b> ahead <b>of</b> <b>him,</b> and show them it's a trap. He is torn apart, and the others realize that the 'cave' is in fact made of wolves, saving them.

25|$|In the 2016 {{video game}} , the {{character}} Sorin Sprocket is eventually revealed to have anterograde amnesia, which he developed after unintentionally causing {{a car accident}} which killed his sister. This causes his memories to completely reset every time he wakes up from sleeping, {{to the day after}} this accident. This depiction is notable for demonstrating the relationship issues that arise between Sorin and his fiancee, Ellen Wyatt, {{as a result of this}} disorder, most noticeably with how Sorin's feelings towards her to coming across as distant and cold. As the storyline continues, however, the player comes to uncover that Sorin in fact deeply loves his fiancee, and is able to maintain this love despite his disorder, but in fact feels a sense of guilt over the fact that he has to constantly remind himself of the fact that this love exists <b>inside</b> <b>of</b> <b>him</b> every day, due to his disorder. It is also noticeable in that it depicts how Sorin deals with his disorder, by keeping a journal where he writes down every minuet detail of every day after his sister's death. He carries this journal around everywhere he goes as a substitution to his memories, and uses what is written in the notebook to become aware each time he wakes up of the fact that he he his condition, what the current date apparently is, and everything important that have apparently occurred on every day since he first developed the condition. The episode also deals with legal issues concerning the disorder, when it is debated during Ellen Wyatt's trial as to whether Sorin's journal can be considered a proper substitution to his memories for the sake of viable witness testimony. Danger's imposed by this also come into play when it is revealed that a page in Sorin's journal had been altered by someone, which causes him to go into mental collapse that any of his other memories and thoughts could also have arisen from someone else's manipulation.|$|E
500|$|NASCAR {{officials}} reviewed video {{evidence of}} Smith's pass of Stewart {{on the final}} lap with Smith and Dale Earnhardt, Inc. president Max Siegel in attendance, and declared the manoeuvre illegal; Smith was issued a pass-through penalty which dropped him from second to 18th. Smith argued that he was forced down below the yellow line: [...] "I was always told that the rule is if you get forced down there, then you are {{the winner of the}} race, and on the last lap, anything goes. That’s what I was going with. I had a nose <b>inside</b> <b>of</b> <b>him</b> and I could have piled up the whole field." [...] Ninth-place finisher Johnson said there were rumors that drivers were allowed to go below the yellow line on the last lap of the previous day's Craftsman Truck Series race which were circulated {{on the day of the}} AMP Energy 500: [...] "I didn’t know what to really think about it, or understood it, or had seen it.

500|$|A lone [...] "Zero" [...] {{emerged from}} the cloud cover below Air Group 18, {{attempting}} to sneak up on the formation from behind. Harris spotted the enemy early on and led his division down in pursuit, chasing the Japanese fighter away from the air group {{and back into the}} cloud cover from which it had appeared. Harris and company followed him down through the clouds into the open skies above Fabrica airfield, where a [...] "hornets nest" [...] of enemy planes was waiting for them. A melee ensued, causing one Zero to break ranks {{in the face of an}} attack by Burley. Burley hit his target but did not have time to verify the kill—another Zero came in from behind, forcing him to take evasive action. Fortunately, Harris was behind this second Japanese fighter and shot him down just a moment later. Flying back toward the bombers, Harris spotted a single Zero Type 32 [...] "Hamp" [...] climbing in front of him, headed in the same direction and apparently intent on attacking the bomber squadrons. Harris pulled up above the enemy and turned <b>inside</b> <b>of</b> <b>him,</b> putting a burst into the plane from 7 o'clock. It went down in flames. Harris then observed the pilots from his division fighting hard over the air strip, so he doubled back to render assistance. As he headed down, he was jumped from 7 o'clock, by two Hamps. He pulled up hard and swung left, allowing his pursuers to overshoot their runs before he tacked back to the right, putting himself above and behind them. Harris dove on his former pursuers with his guns firing, causing one plane to explode and the other to flee the scene. Once more seeking out his division, Harris approached a cluster of planes that turned out to be still more Zero 32s. Harris's Hellcat had no problem outpacing them. After he'd put enough distance between himself and the group, he looped back and approached the enemy formation head on in a low side run. His target, the last Zero in formation, exploded a mere [...] from Harris, who finally spotted some fellow Hellcats. He broke off his engagement to follow the other VF-18 pilots to the rendezvous point.|$|E

60|$|Mr. Brumley did {{his best}} to resist the {{influence}} of these darkening ideas. He tried to keep it up that everything was going well and that most of these shadows and complaints were the mischief of a few incurably restless personalities. He tried to keep it up that to belong to the working class was a thoroughly jolly thing--for those who were used to it. He declared that all who wanted to alter our laws or our ideas about property or our methods of production were envious and base and all who wanted any change between the sexes, foolish or vicious. He tried to go on disposing of socialists, agitators, feminists, women's suffragists, educationists and every sort of reformer with a good-humoured contempt. And he found an increasing difficulty in keeping his contempt sufficiently good-humoured. Instead of laughing down at folly and failure, he had moments when he felt that he was rather laughing up--a little wryly--at monstrous things impending. And since ideas are things of atmosphere and the spirit, insidious wolves of the soul, they crept up to him and gnawed the <b>insides</b> out <b>of</b> <b>him</b> even as he posed as their manful antagonist.|$|R

So I cooked, trapped, freighted, wrangled dudes, trained horses, lambed sheep - just anything there was to do. I learned to do lots of things, but some of the things aren't of much use to me now - for example, how to put a six- or eight-horse team around a sharp bend. But some are real useful. What you learn from horses helps in dealing with humans. A horse is good for a boy or a man.
