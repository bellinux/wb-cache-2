40|$|We {{report the}} results of an {{experiment}} that demonstrates that market experience is not necessary to eliminate bubbles in the type of asset markets studied in Smith et�al. (1988). We introduce a pre-market phase in which subjects experience a <b>dividend</b> <b>flow</b> themselves by literally observing and receiving dividends for 12 periods. The robust bubble-crash phenomenon never occurs in our experiment. Our results provide strong evidence that so long as a majority of the subjects have full understanding {{of the structure of the}} dividend, market efficiency can be ensured.

40|$|We model {{an economy}} where {{stocks and bonds}} (consols) are traded by two types of agents: speculators, {{expected}} utility maximizers always present in the market, and infrequent traders, whose trading motives are not explicitly modeled. A solution technique for equilibrium prices is developed when trades are triggered by stock prices reaching some threshold level, corresponding to a specific value of the <b>dividend</b> <b>flow.</b> Across trade scenarios we find expectations of stock sales to depress stock prices relative to the no-trade case, while expectations of stock purchases tend to inflate them. both effects bring about heteroskedasticity and predictability of stock returns. Our analysis yields insights as to the equilibrium effects {{of a variety of}} trading strategies, which mechanically generate market orders in response to changes in stock prices. ...|$|E
40|$|I {{examine a}} model where {{monetary}} exchange is necessary. Inside money constitutes a claim against the stochastic <b>dividend</b> <b>flow</b> of a durable asset. The long-horizon expected return on this asset remains constant over time. An exogenous and high-frequency flow {{of new information}} (news), however, induces volatility in short-horizon expected returns. An informationally efficient asset market implies {{that the value of}} inside money will fluctuate accordingly. I demonstrate that an informationally efficient asset market is not nec-essarily consistent with an efficient allocation of resource when the asset in question is a monetary instrument. The efficacy of equity as a high-velocity payment instrument is hindered by unanticipated movements in its short-term value that occasionally leave consumers “cash-constrained. ” When this is so, I show that the nondisclosure of high-frequency news items can improve ex ante welfare. If nondisclosure is not possible, then the introduction of a fiat currency may improve ex ante welfare. ...|$|E

A particular {{emphasis is placed on}} the question of whether and how the impact of future accounting rates-of-returns on current price-to-book ratios decays within a finite time horizon. Our results reveal that any current price-to-book ratio is significantly related to both current and future accounting rates-of-returns over the five subsequent years.

40|$|This paper {{introduces}} an information-based {{model for}} the pricing of storable commodities such as crude oil and natural gas. The model makes use {{of the concept of}} market information about future supply and demand as a basis for valuation. Physical ownership of a commodity is regarded as providing a stream of "convenience dividends" equivalent to a continuous cash flow. The market filtration is assumed to be generated jointly by (i) current and past levels of the dividend rate, and (ii) partial information concerning the future of the <b>dividend</b> <b>flow.</b> The price of a commodity is given by the expectation of the totality of the discounted risk-adjusted future convenience dividend, conditional on the information provided by the market filtration. In the situation where the dividend rate is modelled by an Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process, the prices of options on commodities can be derived in closed form, both in the case when underlying is the spot price, and in the case when underlying is a futures price. The approach presented can be applied to other assets that can yield potentially negative effective cash flows, such as real estate, factories, refineries, mines, and power generating plants.

40|$|Asset pricing {{models have}} only {{partially}} captured the true inflation risk of equities. The contribution {{of this paper}} is to identify and quantify the extra inflation tax on equities that results when ownership of physical capital is separated from nominal ownership of the firm in a production economy with money. We add money to the standard stochastic growth model with production and explicitly distinguish firm ownership of physical capital from household ownership of stock certificates. We prove that the effect of this distinction is to make the value of the firm equal to the firm's capital stock divided by inflation. We then derive the standard asset-pricing conditions from the consumer's Euler equations and show that the effect of inflation on asset returns differs from the effects found in other papers by the addition of a wealth tax. The wealth tax reflects the government's ability to tax the entire future dividend stream at once by taxing the real value of stock certificates, rather than taxing the <b>dividend</b> <b>flow</b> period by period. We show analytically as well as in simulations that the wealth tax effect is significant. This suggests that the presence of the wealth tax is responsible for the greater inflation anxiety in the stock market...|$|E
40|$|We study a Bayesian-Nash {{equilibrium}} {{model of}} insider trading in continuous time. The {{supply of the}} risky asset {{is assumed to be}} stochastic. This supply can be interpreted as noise from nonrational traders (noise traders). A rational informed investor (the insider) has private information on the growth rate of the <b>dividend</b> <b>flow</b> rewarded by the risky asset. She is risk averse and maximizes her inter-temporal utility rate over an infinite time-horizon. The market is cleared by a risk neutral market maker who sets the price of the risky asset competitively as the conditional present value of future dividends, given the information supplied by the dividend history and the cumulative order flow. Due to the presence of noise traders, the market demand does not fully reveal the insider's private information, which slowly becomes incorporated in prices. An interesting result of the paper is that a nonstandard linear filtering procedure gives an a priori form for the equilibrium strategy to be postulated. We show the existence of a stationary linear equilibrium where the insider acts strategically by taking advantage of the camouflage provided by the noise which affects the market maker's estimates on private information. In this equilibrium, we find that the insider's returns on the stock are uncorrelated over long periods of time. Finally, we show that the instantaneous variance of the price under asymmetric information lies between the instantaneous variance of the price under complete and incomplete information. The converse inequalities hold true for the unconditional variance of the price. Â© Springer-Verlag 2009...|$|E

However, after extending the original model to a small open economy in which firms can borrow from overseas lenders but may have to pay a default risk premium on interest payments, simulated results show that financial shocks have contributed heavily to the dynamics of aggregate debt and <b>dividend</b> <b>flows.</b> This is consistent with Jermann and Quadrini's (2012) finding on the U.

The information about cash flow department is surely useful for the reporter user as a base to value the department ability in creating cash and considered as cash, also valuing the department’s needs to use that cash flow. Cash is the most liquid active since it is used to pay credits, change tools, wide facilities, and pay dividend, instead of profits. Therefore, the analysis of income cash and outcome cash flow including the operation source, investment, and the fund {{is one of the most}} important investigations because the investor could analyze the ability of cash flow to predict the dividend either the advanced cash flow to never make mistakable investigations. This study is aimed to test the ability of cash flow in predicting the dividend and the advanced cash flow. Besides, it was aimed to prove whether there were some differences or not.

40|$|The {{theme of}} my {{dissertation}} is emerging capital markets behavior. I utilize three approaches: institutional, experimental and econometric {{to study the}} impact of reforms on capital allocation and stock market operation. In Chapter one, using a unique data set on Chinese provincial savings and investment, I prove that the torrent of reports about the inadequacies of the Chinese financial system, accompanied by studies claiming product and capital market segmentation, overlooks real achievements. While my aggregate results parallel those of Boyreau-Debray and Wei (2002) and others, I am able {{to assess the impact}} of financial innovation on capital flows outside the government allocation mechanism. Stripping out foreign funds, government appropriations, and officially influenced bank loans, I discover that inter-provincial commercial capital flows present a strong trend toward market integration and their mobility pattern starts to bear resemblance to interstate flows in the U. S. and other advanced nations. This result undercuts the widespread view of China's economy as lacking in domestic integration. Several emerging capital markets have adopted legally separated share markets (LSSM) in which local firms market separate claims to the same underlying <b>dividend</b> <b>flow</b> to two distinct sets of investors, domestic shareholders trading "A" shares with domestic currency and foreign investors trading "B" shares with foreign currency. I utilize an experimental approach to show that information transference across these segmented markets may have caused the covariance in A and B shares' price movements. Our hypothesis is that. My results not only suggest that there is indeed information transmission across LSSM, but also indicate that the quality and clarify of signals sent out by the market with more information directly impacts the success of information transference. Chapter 3 takes an empirical approach to study the risk and return relationships of A and B shares with a standard CAPM model. I utilize CAPM models to directly estimate the betas of A and B shares listed in the Shanghai Stock Exchange. I find that domestic investors price asset risk as predicted by CAPM models, but foreign investors do so only for large and prominent Chinese firms with significantly better performance...|$|E
40|$|PURPOSE OF THE STUDY: Regardless of the {{extensive}} body of literature examining firms' payout policies, the theoretical and empirical evidence on why companies pay dividends and what determines the amounts paid out has proved contradictory. One aspect of the dividend puzzle is managers' tendency to keep the <b>dividend</b> <b>flow</b> stable; a phenomenon also known as dividend smoothing. The objective {{of this study is}} to examine the cross-sectional differences in the dividend smoothing behavior of European companies. Although the phenomenon of dividend smoothing is unanimously agreed and the empirical evidence is rather consistent, there is little agreement on what are the characteristics of these firms that determine the propensity to smooth and what are the reasons behind the smoothing behavior. By examining the differences in firm characteristics and smoothing behavior I intend to shed light on possible reasons for this behavior. The objective is to examine whether the firm characteristics driving smoothing behavior can be linked to the prevailing theories of information asymmetries, agency considerations, dividend clienteles and external financing constraints. DATA AND METHODOLOGY: The sample consists of 1, 221 publicly listed European companies that have continuously paid dividends for at least 8 consecutive years during the sample period of 1985 - 2011. The sample firms are also required to have at least 5 years of data for each of the firm characteristic variables examined in this study. The sample includes companies from 20 European countries. The data is retrieved from Thomson One Banker. Dividend smoothing is measured by speed of adjustment and univariate t-tests of equal means as well as basic multivariate cross-sectional regressions are used to examine the link between firm characteristics and speed of adjustment measure. RESULTS: According to my results, a clear conclusion on the underlying driving force behind dividend smoothing behaviour cannot be made. I find that larger firms with less growth opportunities, shorter investor investment horizon, that pay less dividends and do have bond ratings have smoother dividends. Moreover, 'cash cow firms' and firms with weaker shareholder rights smooth less. These results partly support both information asymmetry and agency conflict explanations. Investor clientele and external financing constraints explanations, instead, are more clearly rejected. Differences between European countries may effect this inconclusivity of the results or several market factors may drive the behaviour simultaneously...|$|E

40|$|The {{current account}} deficit of the United States {{has been growing}} {{steadily}} {{as a share of}} GDP for more than a decade. It is now at an all-time high, over 5 percent of GDP (see Figure 1). This steady deterioration has been greeted with an increasing amount of concern (U. S Trade Deficit Review Commission 2000; Brookings Papers 2001; Godley 2001; Mann 2002). At The Levy Economics Institute, we have long argued that this burgeoning deficit is unsustainable. A current account deficit implies a growing external debt, which in turn implies a continuing shift in net income received from abroad (net interest and <b>dividend</b> <b>flows)</b> in favor of foreigners. We have also noted that with the private sector headed toward balance, a growing current account deficit implies a corresponding growing "twin" deficit for the government sector (Papadimitriou, et al 2002; Godley 2003). This latter scenario has already come to pass: the latest figures show that the general government deficit rose to an annual rate of more than 4 percent of GDP {{in the first quarter of}} 2003 and will certainly rise even more in the near future, since the federal deficit alone is officially projected to reach 4 percent by the end of this fiscal year (CBO 2003). ...|$|R
40|$|The {{successful}} implementation of the Renewable Energy Independent Power Producer Procurement Program) by the Department of Energy has cemented the importance of renewable energy as an integral component of South Africa's energy mix going into the future. The program sought to intentionally introduce the previously disadvantaged blacks into {{being a part of}} this private sector participation through equity shareholding in the project companies awarded generation contracts. The study sought to understand the financing context of the minority Broad-Based Black Economic Empowerment equity shareholders, their existing loan terms, potential refinancing terms, requirements and conditions and ultimately to assess whether there would be a substantial benefit from undertaking such refinancing. This research question was responded to through a detailed review of the literature and field research. An exploratory research design was chosen for this study and began the academic enquiry into the refinancing of Broad-Based Black Economic Empowerment equity investments in the Renewable Energy Independent Power Producer Procurement Program. The theoretical framework chosen to underpin the study was the Simple interest computation model. Semi-structured interviews were conducted with senior managers of the development finance institutions, commercial banks, institutional investors as well as project developers, which were selected through the judgemental and snowball sampling approach. The general inductive approach was used to analyse the records of the interviews into codes, which were then grouped into relevant themes. Key findings were that the funding given to Broad-Based Black Economic Empowerment equity shareholders to participate in the Renewable Energy Independent Power Producer Procurement Program was sub-optimally structured. The Development Funding Institutes that provided most of the funding priced their funding at a significant risk premium over senior project debt. The reasons why those market players who declined to fund Broad-Based Black Economic Empowerment equity shareholders that emerged could inform the better structuring of future deals. Numerous possible refinancing options were identified from the review of existing literature and respondents' contributions, chief among them was negotiation of a significant reduction in the risk premium attached to the current funding, given that the underlying projects were now past the risk construction phase and were now generating cash inflows from operations. This would enable a more substantial <b>dividend</b> <b>flow</b> to them in the initial years as opposed to the trickle dividend they are currently receiving under the original funding terms. Institutional investors such as pension funds have very deep capital pools that other industries like the property sector have aligned with and tapped into with great success. The main points to align would be asset classes, inflation linked return profile to match their future liability profile and studying the credit rating agency criteria to steadily improve the credit rating of the borrowing entities. Potential barriers to the success of refinancing were identified as mainly to do with the illiquidity of the Broad-Based Black Economic Empowerment equity shareholding that brings a significant discount to its security value. The original funders also placed some barriers in the form of limited refinancing windows, after which breakup penalties become so penal to make refinancing unviable. The examples of successful refinancing transactions that have been finalised by some of the Respondents to date objectively show that refinancing is a win-win solution for all parties involved in the funding of Broad-Based Black Economic Empowerment equity investments in the past, present or future...|$|E
40|$|Capitalization {{rates for}} all {{commercial}} real estate are affected by changes in the general level of interest rates. Hotel capitalization rates should respond more quickly to interest rate changes than those of other property types because hotels do not experience the “lease friction” found in other commercial properties, with their lengthy leases. This analysis estimates the statistical connection between interest rate changes and cap rates. Holding other important factors constant, the model estimates that at current levels a 100 -basis-point increase in the 10 -year U. S. Treasury rate will produce a 28 -basis-point uptick in hotel capitalization rates. Continuing improvement in the U. S. economy should eventually result in higher interest rates, but any improvement should also bring both compression of the hotel risk premium and stronger NOI growth, each of which place downward pressure on capitalization rates. With hotel capitalization rates currently {{in a range of}} 7. 0 to 8. 5 percent and an expected slow pace of interest-rate changes, the modelled outcome suggests that hotel property values will remain stable for the foreseeable future.

The power of Australia 2 ̆ 7 s big four banks is unmistakable. Their underlying profits equate to almost three per cent of GDP, up from less than one per cent {{a quarter of a}} century ago. Of every 100 spent in Australia, nearly 3 ends up as underlying profit for the banks. Profits are so high because the banking market is highly concentrated. The big four banks now control more than 75 per cent of all bank assets and banks account for over 90 per cent of all lending by financial institutions in Australia. This level of concentration has distorted competition, allowing the big banks to reap underlying profits of around 35 billion per year, including 20 billion in 2 ̆ 7 super-profits 2 ̆ 7 attributable to their market power. Most Australians believe that the banking market is overly concentrated: three in four survey respondents (72 per cent) said that the big four banks in Australia have too much market power. But is the extreme profitability of Australia 2 ̆ 7 s banks in the public interest?

40|$|Purpose – The {{purpose of}} this paper is to compare the {{relative}} power of operating cash flow and earnings in the prediction of dividends. Design/methodology/approach – A linear mixed effects model is used in terms of selected model fit criteria. Findings – Based on the selected model fit criteria, cash flow per share is shown to produce a better fit than earnings per share, but it cannot be said how much better. Research limitations/implications – Quarterly CRSP and Compustat data from 2000 to 2006 for 1, 902 dividend-paying firms are analyzed. Future work would need a different methodology to determine how much better cash flow is as a predictor of dividends. Practical implications – Both earnings per share and cash flow per share are found to be reasonable dividend predictors. Social implications – Additional insight is provided on modeling factors that contribute to a firm's decision to engage or disengage in a dividend payment policy. Originality/value – The study described in this paper continues work on predicting dividends per share. Results show cash flow per share is a better predictor than earnings per share.

40|$|This thesis {{identifies}} a gap {{in existing}} theories of corporate finance. This gap is an implication of a Keynesian-Minskian analysis of markets and market-based economies. From a founding theoretical perspective rooted in the view that markets are not reliably efficient the case is developed that past price trend extrapolation {{is an important factor}} in corporate financing decisions. At a macro-financial level, companies repurchase equity over periods of strong market rises, while increasing debt at the same time. During periods of sustained, substantial market decline debt is retired and large new equity issues occur. This change in corporate financing is implicitly expensive as relatively low prices are realised for the new stock issued at these times. These factors suggest that conventional theories of corporate financing decisions that rely on corporate rationality and optimisation do not provide a compelling fit with observations in the period 1980 - 2012. Moreover, inference to Minsky’s (1986) argument that companies are compelled through market declines to shore up their balance sheets provides a better fit with the evidence. These arguments form the basis for the development of the ‘extrapolative expectations’ theory of corporate finance. The second major development in this thesis draws on the theoretical development outlined above to create market movement description and prediction models. These models operate on data drawn from the US Standard & Poors 500 index over the period 1980 - 2012. Two primary models are developed using binomial logistic regressions. The dichotomous dependent variables are drawn as quarters of market rise (1) or no rise (0), and market falls (1) or no fall (0), respectively for the ‘buy’ model and the ‘sell’ model. Variables tested and those found to add to an explanation of the dependent variables include: corporate debt flows, corporate equity <b>flows,</b> corporate <b>dividend</b> <b>flows,</b> interest rates, market volumes, and historical market levels. Each variable is tested for up to ten lags (two-and-a-half years). Collectively, the variables add to our understanding of those factors influencing (or at the least, signalling) market levels, enabling quarter ahead market forecasts to be made with greater accuracy than arises from an assumption of a random walk. This conclusion crystallises the view that company macro-financial flows and prices are an important cause or signal of future market direction...|$|R

These dummies found to have great impact in excess returns {{and seemed to be}} very significant. The results of our analysis appear to be in contrast with the existing literature. ...|$|R
40|$|This article {{examines}} whether the overall market risk, along with risks reflecting uncertainty {{related to the}} long–run dynamics of market cash <b>flows</b> (<b>dividends)</b> and discount rates (returns), price average returns on single–sorted portfolios in the Greek stock market. Our results suggest that a two–beta intertemporal capital asset pricing model explains half of the cross–sectional variation in average returns and delivers an economically and statistically acceptable estimate of the coefficient of relative risk aversion. Despite {{the relative importance of}} market discount–rate risk, it is market dividend–growth risk {{that turns out to be}} far more significant in determining average returns on Greek portfolios...|$|R
40|$|The {{problem of}} insider trading and other illegal {{practices}} in financial markets {{is an important}} issue in the field of financial regulatory policies. Market control bodies, such as the US SEC or the Italian CONSOB [1], regularly perform statistical analyses on security prices in order to unveil clues of fraudulent behaviour within the market. Fraudulent behaviour is connected to the more general problem of information asymmetries, which had already been addressed in the field of experimental economics (see, for instance, refs. [2, 3, 4]). Recently, interesting conclusions were drawn thanks to a computer-simulated market at MIT where agents had different pieces of information about the future <b>dividend</b> cash <b>flow</b> of exchanged securities [5]. In particular, in the MIT simulated market, the intelligent agents can replicate various findings of human-based experiments. Here, by means of an agent-based artificial market: the Genoa Artificial Stock Market (GASM) [6, 7], the more specific problem of fraudulent behavi our in a financial market is studied. A simplified model of fraudulent behaviour is implemented...|$|R
40|$|When {{determining}} {{the value of}} the stocks with different stock discount valuation models, one of the important inputs is expected growth rate of <b>dividends,</b> earnings, cash <b>flows</b> and other relevant parameters of the company. Growth rate can be determined by three basic ways, and those are: on the basis of extrapolation of historical data, on the basis of professional assessment of the analytics who follow business of the company and on the basis of fundamental indicators of the company. Aim {{of this paper is to}} depict theoretical basis and practical application of stated methods for growth rate determination, and to indicate their advantages, or deficiencies...|$|R
40|$|Bubbles {{are often}} precipitated by {{perceptions}} of real {{improvements in the}} productivity and underlying profitability of the corporate economy. But as history attests, investors then too often exaggerate {{the extent of the}} improvement in economic fundamentals. — Greenspan (2002) The magnitude of short-term movements in asset prices remains a challenge to explain within a framework of rational, efficient markets. Numerous empirical studies have shown that stock prices appear to exhibit “excess volatility, ” that is, prices move too much to be explained by changes in the underlying fundamentals, such as <b>dividends</b> or cash <b>flows.</b> Another prominent feature of asset prices is the intermittent occurrence of sustained run-ups above estimates o...|$|R
40|$|Given the {{increasing}} importance of liquidity, factors affecting cash holdings have attracted many researchers. In this study, {{using data from}} the financial statements of companies listed in Tehran Stock Exchange (TSE), 76 companies are selected as samples. The impact of accruals quality on cash holdings are evaluated using 11 control variables for the period between the years 2003 to 2009 through multivariate linear regression. The results show that the effect of discretionary accrual quality, leverage, capacity to generate cash <b>flows,</b> <b>dividend,</b> debt maturity structure, growth options and financial distress on cash holdings is not statistically significant. On the other hand, non-discretionary accruals quality, size, bank debt...|$|R
