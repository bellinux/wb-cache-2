50|$|He teaches his {{students}} a practical approach to understanding alternative investments {{along with a}} theoretical one, having them run a simulated version of a hedge fund to learn practical lessons, particularly from hedge funds that blew up in 2008. His own <b>investment</b> <b>portfolio</b> <b>management</b> philosophy {{is to focus on}} the downside risk rather than the upside. Professor Lhabitant also says that the hedge fund world is getting riskier due to two factors. The first is the huge political risk in Europe and the US against hedge funds and financial strategies in general. These mounting political pressures pose a huge threat to development. The second is the transition since 2008 from a market crisis, to a liquidity crisis, and now shifting to state solvency crisis, where economies of countries like Greece and Ireland are on the brink of failure. He says that these solvency risks brought on by massive debt are likely not captured and embedded correctly in investment strategies of many US based hedge funds.|$|E

40|$|Abstract This study proposes an {{analysis}} of non-operational mechanisms that can impact the effectiveness of information technology governance in the Brazilian public administration. A questionnaire was sent to information technology managers and experienced professionals {{in the area of}} information technology governance, who work in public organizations. Based on the collected data, we used the structural equations technique to verify the impact of the following mechanisms on the effectiveness of information technology governance: top management support; performance of the information technology steering committee; use of information technology strategic planning; performance of the information technology <b>investment</b> <b>portfolio</b> <b>management.</b> The study indicates that the first three mechanisms do not influence the perceived effectiveness of information technology governance in the Brazilian public sector. However, the performance of the information technology <b>investment</b> <b>portfolio</b> <b>management</b> has a direct and positive consequence on effectiveness; also, as a mediating variable, it significantly affects the performance of the information technology steering committee, increasing the effectiveness of Brazilian public information technology governance. Through the achieved results and the analysis of these effects, this study aims to contribute theoretically to the literature on information technology governance, as there are few studies that examine which mechanisms assist to establish this effectiveness in public organizations, and even less {{when it comes to the}} Brazilian public sector...|$|E
