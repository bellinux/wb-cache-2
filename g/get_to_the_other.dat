5|$|I've {{always tried}} to insert {{positivity}} into my songs wherever I can, to inspire other people who go through stuff. I mean the stuff they talked about in tabloids {{and the things that}} were so overly exaggerated, that's one aspect. I also went through a lot of personal stuff, a lot of family stuff this year. Losing a parent is an intense thing for anybody. It's brought me to another place. People are going to read into it as, 'This is Mariah and her struggle'. But the way I try to word it is, 'It's OK once you say I can make it through the rain.' Not just me going, 'I can make it through the rain,' it's me telling people that if you believe you can get through whatever you're going through, you can <b>get</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>other</b> side.|$|E

25|$|In April 2004, {{construction}} {{began on}} what was rumoured to be a Teen Market Thrill Ride to open later in the year. To aid in the construction, {{the northern end of}} Ocean Parade was closed off to the public forcing guests to detour through Nickelodeon Central to <b>get</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>other</b> rides that area, including the Cyclone and the Wipeout. In July 2004, Dreamworld announced that the ride {{was going to be an}} Intamin Gyro Swing, a duplicate of Maelstrom at Drayton Manor in the United Kingdom. On 18 September 2004, The Claw officially opened to the public.|$|E

50|$|After death, {{the human}} soul leaves the body. The body is buried by {{relatives}} on <b>the</b> <b>other</b> bank of a river, looking towards east. If the soul had been good, it <b>gets</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>Other</b> World (Túlvilág), for eternal peace. If it had been bad, it must suffer in the underworld (Alsó Világ / Alvilág), where Ördög ("the devil") and numerous evil ghosts live.|$|R
25|$|In {{classical}} physics, when a ball is rolled {{slowly up}} a large hill, it will {{come to a stop}} and roll back, because it doesn't have enough energy to get {{over the top of the}} hill to the other side. However, the Schrödinger equation predicts that there is a small probability that the ball will <b>get</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>other</b> side of the hill, even if it has too little energy to reach the top. This is called quantum tunneling. It is related to the distribution of energy: although the ball's assumed position seems to be on one side of the hill, there is a chance of finding it on the other side.|$|E

2500|$|Along the Bunog River, {{downstream}} from Bunog Falls below Tulgao West, are numerous hot sulfurous springs. The first spring is visible from Bunog Falls, about [...] {{downstream from}} the Bunog Falls' hot freshwater springs. According to Tulgao and Tinglayan locals, {{there was a}} hot salt water spring on the Bunog River {{which used to be}} harvested and the water 'cooked' (evaporated) to produce salt, before the Cordillera Highway was first blazed. Also, according to them, one of the springs is poisonous killing animals and birds which drink from it. There are no paths along the Bunog River to <b>get</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>other</b> springs.|$|E

50|$|One {{device for}} {{measuring}} burning rate is a V shaped metal channel about 1-2 feet long wherein a sample is placed, with a cross-sectional dimension of approximately 6 mm or 1/4". The sample is ignited {{on one end}} and time is measured until <b>the</b> flame front <b>gets</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>other</b> end. Burn rate (typically expressed in 'mm/s' or 'in/s') is the sample length over time at a given pressure and temperature. For solid fuel propellant, the most common method of measuring burn rate is the Crawford Type Strand Burning Rate Bomb System (also known as the Crawford Burner or Strand Burner), as described in MIL-STD-286C.|$|R
2500|$|Several critics liked how {{the game}} blended the {{gameplay}} styles of Persona and Etrian Odyssey; Meghan Sullivan of IGN particularly noted the battle system, praising the strategic possibilities {{offered by the}} arrangement of the party in rows, the additional Personas each character had, and the leader skills. Kyle MacGregor of Destructoid found navigating the labyrinths the weakest aspect of the game because of situations like backtracking in search for a key or a puzzle solution, but enjoyed drawing maps and making notes. Sullivan also found this tedious at times, but overall enjoyed the exploration and puzzles. Game Informer Kimberly Wallace said that some might find it tedious to draw maps, but that she found it [...] "thrilling" [...] to <b>get</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>other</b> side of a labyrinth by finding the correct path on her own. Megan Farokhmanesh at Polygon, too, liked drawing maps, calling it fun, personal and rewarding.|$|E

50|$|The rest of {{the group}} {{soldiers}} on, heading towards the ocean. Cockney is killed when the group accidentally stumbles upon a nest of rattlesnakes, and he trips and falls into them. Plunkett becomes increasingly strained and paranoid out of fatigue. The remaining trio is forced to cross a river filled with alligators, which they successfully do. Upon <b>getting</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>other</b> side, Plunkett offers the Sergeant his gold (as he has provided his safety {{for the duration of the}} trip) and finds only rocks in his satchel. Concluding that Cockney stole his gold, he dives back into the river and is eaten by the alligators.|$|R
50|$|Madariaga {{realized}} that <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>the</b> enemy <b>to</b> <b>the</b> trap, he had <b>to</b> <b>get</b> Urquiza <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>other</b> side of <b>the</b> province, leaving all of Corrientes in the enemy's hands, with thesubsequent {{suffering of the}} local population, {{so he decided to}} fight a guerrilla war instead.|$|R
2500|$|Shortly after departure, the {{traveling}} twin sees the stay-at-home twin {{with no time}} delay. At arrival, the image in the ship screen shows the staying twin as he was 1year after launch, because radio emitted from Earth 1year after launch <b>gets</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>other</b> star 4years afterwards and meets the ship there. During this leg of the trip, {{the traveling}} twin sees his own clock advance 3years and the clock in the screen advance 1year, {{so it seems to}} advance at [...] the normal rate, just 20image seconds per ship minute. This combines the effects of time dilation due to motion (by factor ε=0.6, five years on earth are 3years on ship) and the effect of increasing light-time-delay (which grows from 0 to 4years).|$|R

60|$|Dick and Tom {{walked down}} to the stream. It was not very deep and they {{concluded}} that they could easily <b>get</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>other</b> side, by leaping from one bit of wreckage to another,--thus keeping from getting wet,--for at that season of the year the water was decidedly cold.|$|E

He had been travelling back and forth through those woods long enough, and he declared that he would not vote to go through them again, if he had to go round the world to <b>get</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>other</b> side of them.|$|E
