40|$|Ultraviolet B {{radiation}} can suppress cellular immunity. One of {{the mechanisms}} {{related to this}} immunosuppression is the disappearance of Langerhans cells from the epidermis. The {{aim of this study}} was to establish the mechanism of ultraviolet B-induced Langerhans cell disappearance in healthy individuals. The two most likely mechanisms for Langerhans cell disappearance are apoptosis and migration. Apoptosis was assessed in vivo by exposing buttock skin of 10 healthy volunteers to six minimal <b>erythema</b> <b>doses</b> of ultraviolet B. Only very few apoptotic Langerhans cells could be observed in sections from the ultraviolet B-exposed skin. Migration of Langerhans cells cannot be established in skin sections and suction blisters were therefore raised in an attempt to trap migrating Langerhans cells in the sub-basal membrane blister fluid. Blisters were raised on the flexor side of the lower arm of 30 healthy volunteers at several time points after exposure of the skin to six minimal <b>erythema</b> <b>doses</b> of ultraviolet B. Blister fluid was collected and blister roofs were removed to check for Langerhans cell disappearance. Langerhans cells were detected in the blister fluid of the ultraviolet B-exposed skin and not of the unexposed skin. The number of Langerhans cells in the blister fluid peaked at about 18 h after ultraviolet exposure, which coincided with the largest depletion of Langerhans cells in the blister roof. A fraction (20 – 30 %) of the Langerhans cells in the blister fluid stained positive for DNA damage (cyclobutyl pyrimidine dimers), showing that they originated from the epidermis. Ultraviolet B-induced Langerhans cell disappearance appears to be mainly attributable to migration...|$|R

Tumor necrosis factor α, interleukin- 1, and interleukin- 10 are key mediators in the mouse, but less {{is known about}} cytokine synthesis and function in ultraviolet-irradiated human skin. We exposed human skin to 3 [*]minimal <b>erythema</b> <b>doses</b> of solar-simulated radiation and raised suction blisters at intervals to 72 [*]h. Alloantigen presentation was suppressed in a mixed epidermal cell-lymphocyte reaction by 69 % from 4 to 15 [*]h post-solar-simulated radiation, but recovered to control values by 24 [*]h. Tumor necrosis factor α was raised at 4 [*]h after solar-simulated radiation, reached a maximum 8 -fold increase at 15 [*]h, then rapidly declined to control values. Interleukin- 1 α and interleukin- 1 β were first increased at 15 [*]h, and remained raised to 72 [*]h, although interleukin- 1 β declined from its 15 [*]h maximum. Interleukin- 10 increased a maximum 2 -fold between 15 and 24 [*]h, coincident with recovery of mixed epidermal cell-lymphocyte reaction responses and downregulation of tumor necrosis factor α and interleukin- 1 β. Solar-simulated radiation differentially affected soluble tumor necrosis factor α receptors; soluble tumor necrosis factor-RI was suppressed 33 % at 8 – 15 [*]h whereas soluble tumor necrosis factor-RII increased 2 -fold from 15 to 48 [*]h. Interleukin- 1 receptor antagonist was raised at all times post-irradiation. Interleukin- 12 was not detectable in control or irradiated skin. These kinetics suggest the tumor necrosis factor α network has primary importance in ultraviolet-damaged human skin. The small increase in interleukin- 10 implies that 3 [*]minimal <b>erythema</b> <b>doses</b> of solar-simulated radiation is the threshold dose for its induction and local, rather than systemic, functions for interleukin- 10 in immunosuppression and regulation of other cytokines...|$|R
40|$|The cytochromes P 450 {{belong to}} a multigene {{superfamily}} and {{are responsible for the}} metabolic activation of both xenobiotics and endobiotics. The expression of cytochrome P 450 genes in target cells is an important determinant of human susceptibility to cancers and other chemically initiated diseases. In this study using immunohistochemistry, reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction, and western blot analysis, we investigated the cellular distribution and localization of cytochrome P 450 1 A 1 and cytochrome P 450 1 B 1 in human skin, and their induction by ultraviolet-B. Through the use of immunohistochemistry, cytochrome P 450 1 A 1 was found to be primarily localized in the basal cell layer of the epidermis in non-ultraviolet-B exposed skin, whereas cytochrome P 450 1 B 1 was localized in the epidermal cells other than the basal cell layer. Thus, localizations of cytochrome P 450 1 A 1 and cytochrome P 450 1 B 1 in human skin are different and may be related to keratinocyte differentiation. Ultraviolet-B exposure to solar-ultraviolet-protected skin (buttock site) resulted in an ultraviolet-B dose-dependent (0 - 4 minimal <b>erythema</b> <b>doses)</b> and time-dependent (0 - 48 [*]h) induction of both cytochrome P 450 1 A 1 and cytochrome P 450 1 B 1 in the epidermis. Reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction and western blot analyses revealed that exposure of human skin to ultraviolet-B (4 minimal <b>erythema</b> <b>doses)</b> resulted in enhanced expression of mRNA and protein of both cytochrome P 450 1 A 1 and cytochrome P 450 1 B 1 in the epidermis. Ultraviolet-B induction of both cytochrome P 450 1 A 1 and cytochrome P 450 1 B 1 in human skin will probably result in enhanced bioactivation of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons and other environmental pollutants to which humans are exposed, which in turn could make the human skin more susceptible to ultraviolet-B-induced skin cancers or allergic and irritant contact dermatitis...|$|R

40|$|Sunscreens prevent sunburn and {{may also}} prevent skin cancer by {{protecting}} from ultraviolet-induced DNA damage. We assessed the ability of two sunscreens, with different spectral profiles, to inhibit DNA photodamage in human epidermis in situ. One formulation contained the established ultraviolet B filter octyl methoxycinnamate, whereas the other contained terephthalylidene dicamphor sulfonic acid, a new ultraviolet A filter. Both formulations had sun protection factors of 4 when assessed with solar simulating radiation in volunteers of skin type I/II. We tested the hypothesis that sun protection factors would indicate the level of protection against DNA photodamage. Thus, we exposed sunscreen-treated sites to four times the minimal <b>erythema</b> <b>dose</b> of solar simulating radiation, whereas vehicle and control sites were exposed to one minimal <b>erythema</b> <b>dose.</b> We used monoclonal antibodies against thymine dimers and 6 – 4 photoproducts and image analysis to quantify DNA damage in skin sections.

In each subject there were fewer polymorphonuclear leukocytes and less endothelial cell prominence and vessel wall necrosis in the UVA tanned control and tanned UVA-irradiated skin there was a prominent mononuclear cell inflammatory infiltrate that was much greater than in untanned skin. In immunoperoxidase stained tissue sections, the mononuclear cells were predominantly T cells, and {{in all of the}} specimens the number of phenotypic helper/inducer cells exceeded the phenotypic cytotoxic/suppressor cells.

40|$|We have {{investigated}} the photoprotective properties of induced pigmentation using erythema and epidermal DNA photodamage as endpoints. Previously unexposed buttock skin of 12 young, healthy adults (six skin type II and six skin type IV) was exposed daily (Monday to Friday) for 2 wk (days 1 – 12) with 0. 65 minimal <b>erythema</b> <b>dose</b> of solar simulated radiation. Mean skin type IV minimal <b>erythema</b> <b>dose</b> was 1. 8 -fold greater than for skin type II. Compared to skin type II, solar simulated radiation treatments produced less erythema and more tanning in skin type IV. To assess DNA photodamage, biopsies were taken and prepared for paraffin sections that were stained with a monoclonal antibody for thymine dimers. Thymine dimers were quantified by image analysis. The single exposure data (0. 65 and 2 minimal <b>erythema</b> <b>dose)</b> showed that DNA damage was related to physical dose (J per cm 2) independent of skin type. Our data also showed that DNA photodamage accumulates in both skin types with repeated, suberythemal doses of solar simulated radiation. On day 12, there were more thymine dimers in skin type IV than skin type II, again indicating that physical rather than biologic dose determines the level of DNA damage. Comparisons on days 12 and 19, however, showed a much greater loss of thymine dimers in skin type IV, suggesting better thymine dimer repair. Protection factors for erythema and thymine dimers were calculated and shown to be about 2 in both skin types.

Results have shown that MED values obtained at 60 cm from the lamp were higher than at 30 cm with a medium average of 60 mJ/cm 2. Moreover, the MPD values at 60 cm were higher than at 30 cm with a medium average of 2 J/cm 2...|$|E
40|$|Repeated skin {{exposure}} to ultraviolet radiation leads to increased tolerance for erythema. Whether this tolerance {{is accompanied by}} a significant protection against epidermal DNA injury has never been thoroughly investigated. In a first set of experiments we irradiated 25 healthy volunteers three times a week for 3 wk using solar-simulating tanning lamps. In addition, all individuals were exposed to a (challenge) dose of three times the initial minimal <b>erythema</b> <b>dose</b> on a small area of skin before the first and after the final exposure. On both occasions, cyclobutane pyrimidine dimers were quantified in biopsies. As expected, repeated ultraviolet exposures resulted in increased epidermal pigmentation and thickness. The ultraviolet sensitivity for erythema decreased on average by 75 %. The cyclobutane pyrimidine dimer formation was reduced on average by 60 %. In a second set of experiments, with a group of 13 subjects, DNA repair kinetics were assessed. Within a period of 5 d after a single, slightly erythemal dose (1. 2 minimal <b>erythema</b> <b>dose),</b> levels of cyclobutane pyrimidine dimer and p 53 -expressing cells were determined in skin biopsies. Both markers of DNA damage were elevated upon the single ultraviolet exposure and returned to background levels after 3 – 4 d. This information is important when trying to minimize the risk of DNA damage accumulation after repeated exposures during a tanning course...|$|E
40|$|Skin cancer {{incidence}} {{is highest}} in white-skinned people. Within this group, skin types I/II (sun sensitive/tan poorly) are {{at greater risk}} than skin types III/IV (sun tolerant/tan well). Studies in mice demonstrate that ultraviolet radiation (UVR) -induced suppression of cell-mediated immune function {{plays an important role in}} the development of skin cancer and induces a susceptibility to infectious disease. A similar role is suspected in humans, but we lack quantitative human data to make risk assessments of ambient solar exposure on human health. This study demonstrates that ambient levels of solar UVR, typically experienced within 1 h of exposure to noonday summer sunlight, can suppress contact hypersensitivity (CHS) responses in healthy white-skinned humans in vivo (n � 93). There was a linear relationship between increase in erythema and suppression of CHS (P � 0. 001), and a moderate sunburn (two minimal <b>erythema</b> <b>doses</b> [2 MED]) was sufficient to suppress CHS in all volunteers by 93 %. However, a single suberythemal exposure of either 0. 25 or 0. 5 MED suppressed CHS responses by 50 and 80 %, respectively, in skin types I/II, whereas 1 MED only suppressed CHS by 40 % in skin types III/ IV. The two- to threefold greater sensitivity of skin types I/II for a given level of sunburn ma...|$|R
40|$|Cumulative {{lifetime}} {{ultraviolet radiation}} (UVR) {{is an important}} factor in the development of squamous cell carcinoma. This study examines the impact of UVR exposure pattern on tumor development. Hairless C 3. Cg/TifBomTac immunocompetent pigmented mice (n = 351) were irradiated with 12 standard <b>erythema</b> <b>doses</b> (SED) /week, given as 2 SED × 6, 3 SED × 4, 4 SED × 3, or 6 SED × 2 (dose–delivery study) or 0, 0. 6, 1. 2, 2, 3 or 4 SED × 3 /week (dose–response study). All mice were irradiated until development of 3 tumors of 4 mm each. Pigmentation was measured once monthly. In the dose–delivery study, the median time until tumor development was independent of dose fractions. In the dose–response study, higher UVR doses resulted in faster tumor appearance. When the weekly UVR dose was decreased from 12 to 6 SED, the cumulative UVR dose needed for tumor development was reduced by 40 %. In conclusion, delivery schedules of a fixed weekly UVR dose did not affect tumor development. When using different weekly UVR doses, longer time to tumor development was observed using lower UVR doses. Lower weekly UVR doses however resulted in lower cumulative UVR doses to induce tumors in hairless pigmented mice...|$|R
40|$|We {{assessed}} the in situ time-dependent loss of epidermal thymine dimers and 6 - 4 photoproducts in skin types I and H after exposure to two minimal <b>erythema</b> <b>doses</b> of solar-simulating radiation on previously unexposed buttock skin. Using quantitative image analysis, we evaluated biopsy sections stained with monoclonal antibodies. We then made comparisons, {{in the same}} volunteers, with unscheduled DNA synthesis, which is a direct marker of overall excision repair. Removal of thymine dimers was slow (half-life = 33. 3 h), {{with high levels of}} lesions still present 24 h post-irradiation; some lesions were still present at 7 d. In contrast, removal of 6 - 4 photoproducts was rapid (half-life = 2. 3 h), the decay kinetics of which correlated better with the decline in epidermal unscheduled DNA synthesis (half-life = 7. 1 h). These data show that as in mouse, monkey, and in vitro models, the 6 - 4 photolesion is repaired preferentially in human epidermis in situ. They also raise the possibility that poor thymine dimer repair may be a feature of skin types I and II, who are more prone to skin cancer than are types III and IV. There was an inverse relationship between the onset of erythema and 6 - 4 photoproduct repair, suggesting that this repair process initiates erythema...|$|R
