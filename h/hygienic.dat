5|$|Following {{the success}} of Mom and Dad, Babb renamed his company Hallmark Productions, {{continuing}} the marketing approaches of <b>Hygienic</b> Productions while going beyond health and sex education films. He would later set up a larger distribution company, named Hallmark's Big-6.|$|E
5|$|In 2015, Gardein was {{assessed}} by Clear Food {{as one of the}} top five most <b>hygienic</b> brands of hot dog and sausage manufacturers.|$|E
5|$|In the Victorian period, {{pamphlets}} started {{circulating in}} favour of {{the removal of the}} livestock market and its relocation outside of the City, due to its extremely poor <b>hygienic</b> conditions as well as the brutal treatment of the cattle.|$|E
5|$|Despite the disappointments {{regarding}} Agnetapark, it was {{an important}} model for the cooperative development and construction of garden cities for workers. The park is considered the first social housing scheme which cared about providing <b>hygienic</b> living conditions in a green environment for a high quality of life.|$|E
5|$|In 1785, he {{was asked}} by the cabildo (town council) to write about smallpox, the worst medical problem the Audiencia faced. Espejo used the {{opportunity}} to write his most complete and best-written work, Reflexiones acerca de un método para preservar a los pueblos de las viruelas (Reflections about a method to preserve the people from smallpox), denouncing the way the Audiencia handled sanitation. This work is a valuable historical source as a description of the <b>hygienic</b> and sanitary conditions of colonial America.|$|E
5|$|Louis-René Villermé (10 March 1782 – 16 November 1863) was a French {{economist}} and physician. He {{was known for}} his early studies of social epidemiology, or the effects of socioeconomic status on health, in early industrial France, and was an advocate for <b>hygienic</b> reform in factories and prisons. His work is considered pivotal {{in the history of the}} fields of sociology and statistical inquiry, and he is considered a founder of epidemiology.|$|E
5|$|Most of {{the basic}} laws of kashrut are derived from the Torah's Books of Leviticus and Deuteronomy. Their details and {{practical}} application, however, are set down in the oral law (eventually codified in the Mishnah and Talmud) and elaborated on in the later rabbinical literature. Although the Torah does not state the rationale for most kashrut laws, some suggest that they are only tests for man's obedience, while others have suggested philosophical, practical and <b>hygienic</b> reasons.|$|E
5|$|Chronic Chagas disease {{remains a}} major health problem in many Latin American countries, despite the {{effectiveness}} of <b>hygienic</b> and preventive measures, such as eliminating the transmitting insects. However, several landmarks have been achieved {{in the fight against}} it in Latin America, including a reduction by 72% of the incidence of human infection in children and young adults in the countries of the Southern Cone Initiative, and at least three countries (Uruguay, in 1997, and Chile, in 1999, and Brazil in 2006) have been certified free of vectorial and transfusional transmission. In Argentina, vectorial transmission has been interrupted in 13 of the 19 endemic provinces, and major progress toward this goal has also been made in both Paraguay and Bolivia.|$|E
5|$|In {{the early}} 1940s Babb joined Cox and Underwood, {{a company that}} {{obtained}} the rights to poorly made or otherwise unmarketable films of subjects that were potentially controversial or shocking. It would often remove entire sections of these films and add material such as medical reels that lent itself to sensational promotion. Babb went {{on the road with}} a Cox and Underwood concoction titled Dust to Dust, a reworking of High School Girl with a childbirth scene added to the end. Its profits allowed Cox and Underwood to retire from the business, leaving Babb to start his own company, <b>Hygienic</b> Productions. He opened it near his childhood home in Wilmington, Ohio, and hired booking agents and advance salesmen along with out-of-work actors and comedians to present repackaged films and new features.|$|E
5|$|The Spanish Crown {{was deeply}} {{concerned}} with public health. Diseases had always troubled the colonies, and town councils spent money to bring physicians or sanitary equipment {{from other parts}} of the Americas. Reports by doctors about the sanitary and <b>hygienic</b> conditions of various neighborhoods of the cities were frequent. As a man of science, Eugenio Espejo demonstrated his knowledge of the latest scientific advances in Europe and the Americas. Most of the arguments and recommendations he made in his medical works can be found in contemporary sources, such as the Mémoires of the French Academy of Sciences.|$|E
5|$|Evidence for a virus {{as a cause}} {{include the}} {{presence}} of oligoclonal bands {{in the brain and}} cerebrospinal fluid of most people with MS, the association of several viruses with human demyelination encephalomyelitis, and the occurrence of demyelination in animals caused by some viral infections. Human herpes viruses are a candidate group of viruses. Individuals having never been infected by the Epstein–Barr virus are at a reduced risk of getting MS, whereas those infected as young adults are at a greater risk than those having had it at a younger age. Although some consider that this goes against the hygiene hypothesis, since the non-infected have probably experienced a more <b>hygienic</b> upbringing, others believe that there is no contradiction, since it is a first encounter with the causative virus relatively late in life that is the trigger for the disease. Other diseases that may be related include measles, mumps and rubella.|$|E
5|$|SS {{officers}} {{told the}} victims {{they were to}} take a shower and undergo delousing. The victims undressed in an outer chamber and walked into the gas chamber, which was disguised as a shower facility. Some were even issued soap and a towel. The Zyklon B was delivered by ambulance to the crematoria by a special SS bureau known as the <b>Hygienic</b> Institute. The actual delivery of the gas to the victims was always handled by the SS, on the order of the supervising SS doctor. After the doors were shut, SS men dumped in the Zyklon B pellets through vents in the roof or holes {{in the side of the}} chamber. The victims were dead within 20 minutes. Despite the thick concrete walls, screaming and moaning from within could be heard outside. In one failed attempt to muffle the noise, two motorcycle engines were revved up to full throttle nearby, but the sound of yelling could still be heard over the engines.|$|E
5|$|By {{about two}} days after the passage of Hurricane Wilma, 800residents on Grand Bahama {{remained}} in shelters, including 65 families who lost their homes and stayed in a hotel set up as a government shelter in Freeport. On Bimini, most residents who evacuated to shelters returned to their homes within two days of the hurricane. The Bahamian Red Cross quickly assessed the damage on Grand Bahama and Bimini, and successfully requested to be included under the federation's hurricane appeal for Central America. Local Red Cross chapters mobilized all available resources to assist the residents most affected. The Bahamian Red Cross began a three-month program to distribute food and other items to 1,000 of the 3,500affected families, primarily on Grand Bahama; the remaining 2,500families received assistance from the government and other organizations. Volunteers delivered building materials and provided water vouchers to those affected. In Nassau, the Red Cross disaster contingency stock sent a boat with food items, blankets, health kits, tarpaulins and water. About a week after the hurricane, the United States Agency for International Development began providing $50,000 (2005USD) to the Bahamian National Emergency Management Agency for the purchase and distribution of emergency supplies. The agency also provided $9,000 (2005USD) for locally contracted helicopter assessments in the affected areas. Red Cross agencies throughout the Caribbean Sea provided <b>hygienic</b> kits, plastic sheeting, blankets, and jerry cans.|$|E
5|$|Methamphetamine (meth), {{a highly}} {{addictive}} drug {{that produces a}} dramatic increase in energy and euphoria, can have negative health effects that include serious dental problems. , it is the most discussed illegal drug in dental literature. The most notable effect of long-term use of methamphetamine on dental health is the development of caries (tooth decay); the teeth of some drug users appear to be dark and in the process of disintegrating. Caries often occur in the cervical regions of teeth, where the tooth surface narrows at the junction of the crown and the root. It is usually found on the buccal (cheek) side of the teeth and on tooth surfaces that are adjacent to incisors and canines; eventually, the coronal tooth area, near the crown, can be affected by the decay and erosion. The dental caries of meth mouth often progress slowly, perhaps because their advancement is hindered by intermittent <b>hygienic</b> practices. The decay can lead to tooth fractures and severe pain. In some cases, teeth are permanently damaged and must be removed. Along with malnutrition and weight loss, the dental effects of methamphetamine use contribute to the appearance of premature aging seen in some users. The effects of meth mouth {{are similar to those of}} Sjögren's syndrome, an autoimmune disease that causes a lack of saliva, which results in tooth decay.|$|E
25|$|Food handlers, {{professionals}} and at home, should observe <b>hygienic</b> rules during food preparation.|$|E
25|$|It is not {{recommended}} to share toothbrushes with others since besides general <b>hygienic</b> concerns {{there is a risk}} of transmitting diseases that are typically transmittable by blood, such as Hepatitis C.|$|E
25|$|After foraging, pharaoh ants will wash {{themselves}} when a worker enters the cell. Pharaoh ants will also wash {{after a long}} feed. It has been proposed that washing has a <b>hygienic</b> value, keeping the nest area clean, staving off disease and disorder. Right before workers leave to forage, they also may wash themselves. However, in this instance the behavior is extremely violent, often causing the ants to fall over. It is thought that here, the washing behavior has no <b>hygienic</b> value and instead may be a displacement activity, {{a sign that the}} ants are deliberating whether or not to exit the nest.|$|E
25|$|Globally 2.6 {{billion people}} remain {{without access to}} any kind of {{improved}} sanitation, and sanitation-related diseases and poor <b>hygienic</b> conditions cause approximately 2.2 million annual deaths, mostly of {{children under the age of}} five years.|$|E
25|$|Under <b>hygienic</b> {{conditions}} and without other treatment, meat {{can be stored}} at above its freezing point (–1.5°C) for about six weeks without spoilage, during which time it undergoes an aging process that increases its tenderness and flavor.|$|E
25|$|It is {{socially}} more accepted and more environmentally <b>hygienic</b> {{for those who}} are able, to urinate in a toilet. Public toilets may have urinals, usually for males, although female urinals exist, designed to be used in various ways.|$|E
25|$|The {{purpose of}} this meeting were the {{establishment}} of a national association, and to introduce technical and <b>hygienic</b> standards. At that time, Kohrs and Streckenbach were the only German tattoo artists who used an autoclave for the sterilisation of equipment.|$|E
25|$|Restaurant and canteen kitchens {{found in}} hotels, hospitals, {{educational}} and work place facilities, army barracks, and similar establishments are generally (in developed countries) subject {{to public health}} laws. They are inspected periodically by public-health officials, and forced to close {{if they do not}} meet <b>hygienic</b> requirements mandated by law.|$|E
25|$|Crunican oversaw {{replacement}} of the BART train seats to vinyl ones that were more <b>hygienic</b> and easy to clean, and the award of a contract to Bombardier Transportation in 2012 for the delivery of new train cars. During her tenure, BART opened the Oakland International Airport station and Warm Springs/South Fremont station.|$|E
25|$|Effective drying of {{the hands}} is an {{essential}} part of the hand hygiene process, but there is some debate over the most effective form of drying in public washrooms. A growing volume of research suggests paper towels are much more <b>hygienic</b> than the electric hand dryers found in many washrooms.|$|E
25|$|In March 1965 Le Figaro {{noted that}} dishwashers {{seemed to have}} finally become {{accepted}} after fifteen years of false starts, with about thirty brands shown at the SAM. They were still expensive items, {{but according to the}} newspaper they were much more <b>hygienic</b> than hand washing, more economical of water and soap and produced brighter results.|$|E
25|$|The mission {{statement}} of the Mission Hill Health Movement prioritizes understanding health conditions and long-term outcomes in terms of 'social determinants of health', while many interventionists whom they host in various forums and venues emphasize the roles of individual and social responsibility for health: healthful living and health-supporting diet, smoking cessation, and regular exercise and <b>hygienic</b> living.|$|E
25|$|Various metals were {{evaluated}} for their antimicrobial efficacies, including copper alloys, zinc, nickel, tin, silver, and gold. Antimicrobial efficacies generally followed Lewis acidity {{values of the}} various metals. Silver, a prohibitively expensive precious metal, had the highest bactericidal activity; copper came in second. The {{study also found that}} contact dermatitis allergies rarely occur if copper is used as a <b>hygienic</b> touch material.|$|E
25|$|The Second Empire renovations left such {{a mark on}} Paris' urban {{history that}} all {{subsequent}} trends and influences were forced to refer to, adapt to, or reject, or to reuse some of its elements. By intervening only once in Paris's ancient districts, pockets of insalubrity remained which explain the resurgence of both <b>hygienic</b> ideals and radicalness of some planners of the 20th century.|$|E
25|$|In 1926, Herty began a {{professional}} relationship with U.S. Senator Joseph Ransdell {{based on their}} mutual interest in public health issues and protectionism. Herty was instrumental in assisting the Senator in the four-year struggle to gain the 1930 passage of the Ransdell Act which created the National Institute of Health from the existing <b>Hygienic</b> Laboratory within the United States Public Health Service.|$|E
25|$|Prevention {{and control}} {{measures}} to prevent soil-transmitted helminthiasis are the following: availability {{of clean water}} for personal and domestic uses, improved access to sanitation which includes the use of properly functioning and clean toilets by all community members, education on personal hygiene such as hand washing and <b>hygienic</b> and safe food preparation; eliminating the use of untreated human faeces as fertilizer.|$|E
25|$|Fecal sludge {{management}} (FSM) requires {{safe and}} <b>hygienic</b> septic tank and pit latrine emptying services, {{along with the}} effective treatment of solids and liquids and the reuse of treated produce where possible. It may include a range of options including on-site and offsite treatment, and the dispersal or capture and further processing of {{the products of the}} treatment process into such as biogas, compost and energy.|$|E
25|$|Typhus {{has been}} {{increasingly}} discovered in homeless populations in developed nations. Typhus among homeless populations is especially prevalent as these populations tend to migrate across states and countries, spreading {{the risk of}} infection with their movement. The same risk applies to refugees, who travel across country lines, often living in close proximity and unable to maintain necessary <b>hygienic</b> standards to avoid being at risk for catching lice possibly infected with typhus.|$|E
25|$|UDDTs can be {{built as}} sitting or as {{squatting}} versions to accommodate the users' preference of defecation posture. Some people prefer squatting UDDTs in public places (thought to be more <b>hygienic)</b> but sitting UDDTs for households (thought to be more comfortable). It may be preferable to squat instead of sit for colon health, although this is not specific for UDDTs but may refer to any type of squat toilet.|$|E
25|$|A 2001 comic book, Neo Gomanism Manifesto Special – On Taiwan by Japanese author Yoshinori Kobayashi, depicts kimono-clad women {{lining up}} {{to sign up for}} duty before a Japanese soldier. Kobayashi's book {{contains}} an interview with Taiwanese industrialist Shi Wen-long, who stated that no women were forced to serve and that the women worked in more <b>hygienic</b> conditions compared to regular prostitutes because the use of condoms was mandatory.|$|E
25|$|Lack of {{sanitation}} {{refers to}} the absence of sanitation. In practical terms it usually means lack of toilets or lack of <b>hygienic</b> toilets that anybody would want to use voluntarily. The result of lack of sanitation is usually open defecation (and open urination but this is of less concern) with associated serious public health issues. It is estimated that 2.4 billion people still lacked improved sanitation facilities as of 2015.|$|E
25|$|The {{great number}} {{of people living in}} such a small area, {{together}} with the poverty of the population, caused terrible <b>hygienic</b> conditions. The district, lying very low and near the Tiber, was often flooded. During the plague of 1656, 800 of 4,000 inhabitants died because of the epidemic. Sant'Angelo, which was the rione with the smallest area, was also, {{because of the presence of}} the Ghetto, the one having the highest population density.|$|E
