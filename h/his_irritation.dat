25|$|His annual {{shows at}} Seattle's Woodside/Braseth Gallery became major events; on one occasion, all of Horiuchi's works sold {{before the show}} even {{opened to the public}} - much to <b>his</b> <b>irritation.</b>|$|E
25|$|Fish {{is a major}} figure {{associated}} with postmodernism, at times to <b>his</b> <b>irritation.</b> Instead he views himself as an advocate of anti-foundationalism. He is also viewed as being a major influence in the rise and development of reader-response theory.|$|E
25|$|Hobbs {{missed a}} large part of the 1927 season; after {{beginning}} in good form, he missed five weeks of cricket with a skin infection. When he returned, he was left out of the Gentlemen v Players game, to <b>his</b> <b>irritation</b> as he believed he had been dropped owing to his age. He responded with a series of large scores, in which he played very aggressively, but then tore a thigh muscle. He resumed cricket at the end of the season and scored his sixth and seventh centuries of the year. He scored 1,641 runs at 52.93, but his absences led to speculation that age was catching up with Hobbs. Hobbs began the 1928 season with four centuries in the first month, but another leg injury kept him out of cricket for six weeks. When he recovered, he played in the last two of three Tests played against West Indies, playing in their first Test series. In his first game, he and Sutcliffe shared another century partnership before Hobbs was out, playing casually, for 53. In the third Test, Hobbs scored 159, having opened with a 155-run partnership with Sutcliffe. England won both matches in which Hobbs played, and won the series 3–0; Learie Constantine, the West Indian bowler, was very impressed with Hobbs' batting, but Hobbs did not consider West Indies up to international standard and did not take the series very seriously. Hobbs maintained his batting form until the end of the season. Even though many batsmen were successful that year, given very favourable batting pitches throughout the season, Hobbs finished second in the batting averages, scoring 2,542 runs at an average of 82.00 and hitting 12 centuries. Critics believed that he remained the best batsman in England.|$|E

60|$|But Amanda {{was more}} {{prepared}} for human inconsecutiveness than Benham, because {{she herself was}} inconsecutive, and her dissatisfaction with <b>his</b> <b>irritations</b> and preoccupation broadened to no general discontent. He had seemed perfect and he wasn't. So nothing was perfect. And {{he had to be}} managed, just as one must manage a dog or a cousin or a mother or a horse. Anyhow she had got him, she had no doubt that she held him by a thousand ties, the spotless leopard had him between her teeth, he was a prisoner in the dusk of her hair, and the world was all one vast promise of entertainment.|$|R
500|$|Ferrari {{team was}} unhappy with its {{performance}} over the weekend, with Vettel summing up: [...] "Overall it was not our day, not quick enough simple as that." [...] He also expressed <b>his</b> <b>irritation</b> at receiving a five-second time penalty and two penalty points on his FIA Super Licence for an overtaking manoeuvre on Massa. Kimi Räikkönen on the other had declared that Ferrari's poor showing {{would prove to be}} a one-time incident, saying: [...] "I'm sure in the next races will be much more normal for us." ...|$|E

[...] Harvard announces his intention to return home and attempt a reconciliation with his disappointed parents. [...] Despite <b>his</b> <b>irritation</b> at Ta, Wang allows him to marry Mei-li at the club (which now features Ta's Chinese opera one day a week), as the company celebrates how Chinese and American cultures have converged to create this happy moment (Finale: [...] "A Hundred Million Miracles").|$|E
500|$|Although many of {{the lyrics}} on the album are {{intended}} to be humorous, several songs depict Eminem's frustrations with living in poverty. When discussing The Slim Shady LP, Anthony Bozza of Rolling Stone described Eminem as [...] "probably the only MC in 1999 who boasts low self-esteem. [...] His rhymes are jaw-droppingly perverse, bespeaking a minimum-wage life devoid of hope, flushed with rage and weaned on sci-fi and slasher flicks." [...] Eminem was inspired to write [...] "Rock Bottom" [...] after being fired from his cooking job at a restaurant days before his daughter's birthday. [...] The song bemoans human dependency on money, discussing its ability to brainwash an individual. [...] He illustrates his struggles to provide for his daughter, describing himself as [...] "discouraged, hungry, and malnourished." [...] "If I Had" [...] follows a similar theme, as he describes living on minimum wage and remarks that he is [...] "tired of jobs starting off at $5.50 an hour". [...] In the song, he expresses <b>his</b> <b>irritation</b> with fitting the [...] "white trash" [...] stereotype.|$|E
60|$|He glanced {{with half}} a smile, in spite of <b>his</b> gloomy <b>irritation,</b> at <b>his</b> sister. She looked, as usual, {{as if she were}} {{weighing}} one thing with another, and balancing them together before she made up her mind.|$|R
6000|$|... "But why {{on earth}} didn't he say he was innocent?" [...] Captain Bayley repeated, with {{something}} of <b>his</b> old <b>irritation.</b> [...] "What possessed him to run away {{as if he were}} guilty without making one protest to us that he was innocent?" ...|$|R
50|$|He is {{an atheist}} and sceptic, and has {{expressed}} that <b>his</b> major pseudoscientific <b>irritations</b> are astrology {{and climate change}} denial.|$|R
500|$|Biographers in the 20th century have, however, rehabilitated his reputation, {{seeking to}} explain how and why he came to be demonized in this way. [...] In recent decades historians have {{typically}} portrayed Hutchinson as a tragic figure torn between his rulers in London and his people in Massachusetts. Barbara Tuchman, for example, portrays Hutchinson as an [...] "ill-fated" [...] and [...] "tragic figure." [...] British scholar David Kenneth Fieldhouse says his tragedy emerged because he was “a victim of the clash of two ideologies, his own archaic and static, that of his opponents contemporary and dynamic." [...] Carl L. Becker, a prominent American historian wrote: [...] "Nothing would have pleased him [...] more than that New England should have shown its emancipation from provincialism by meriting the good will of the King. <b>His</b> <b>irritation</b> with America in general and Boston in particular was the irritation of a proud and possessive father with a beloved but wayward child who fails to do him credit in high places." [...] Bailyn has changed his own interpretation over the years. In the 1970s he saw Hutchinson as a bewildered pragmatist. [...] By 2004 he portrayed Hutchinson as a premodern thinker locked in an old mindset {{at a time when}} Enlightenment ideas were taking hold thanks to thinkers such as Adam Smith and Tom Paine.|$|E
2500|$|After {{finishing}} his role for East of Eden, {{he took a}} brief trip to New York in October 1954. While he was away, Angeli unexpectedly announced her engagement to Italian-American singer Vic Damone. The press was shocked and Dean expressed <b>his</b> <b>irritation.</b> Angeli married Damone the following month. Gossip columnists reported that Dean watched the wedding from across the road on his motorcycle, even gunning the engine during the ceremony, although Dean later denied doing anything so [...] "dumb." ...|$|E
2500|$|Kilkenny manager Brian Cody {{called the}} victory [...] "very special", saying it felt [...] "outstanding, terrific". However, {{he spoke of}} his {{annoyance}} at a question put to him by RTÉ's Marty Morrissey in his post-match interview which questioned the decision-making of the referee when he gave the penalty. While later appearing on Newstalk show Off the Ball, Cody reiterated <b>his</b> <b>irritation</b> with the RTÉ interview and also suggested there was a media [...] "witch-hunt" [...] against Kilkenny hurler Tommy Walsh—"The Tommy Walsh witch-hunt went on and Tommy Walsh rose above everything and proved the kind of player he is".|$|E

2500|$|For many, {{the only}} {{justification}} for the 'flank march' was an immediate assault upon Sevastopol. George Cathcart, commander of the British 4th Division, pleaded with Raglan for instant action. [...] "I am sure I could walk into it, with scarcely {{the loss of a}} man," [...] wrote Cathcart to Raglan on 28 September from the heights above the eastern approach to the city. [...] "We could leave our packs, and run into it even in open day … We see people walking about the streets in great consternation ..." [...] But caution prevailed, and plans by Burgoyne for a formal siege, backed by Canrobert, were prepared. When Raglan told Cathcart that nothing would happen until the Allied siege trains had been landed, Cathcart could not hide <b>his</b> <b>irritation,</b> [...] "Land the siege trains! But my dear Lord Raglan, what the devil is there to knock down?" ...|$|E

5000|$|First {{broadcast}} on 16 October 1958, Blue Peter {{had originally been}} devised by John Hunter Blair, but it was Baxter and her deputy Edward Barnes, later head of BBC children's television, who developed the format into a successful programme, initially on a budget of only £180 per edition. When they were first introduced, Barnes was told: [...] "You'll have to look after Biddy - she doesn't know very much", to <b>his</b> considerable <b>irritation.</b>|$|R
6000|$|He had {{a longing}} to say: 'Part {{of one of}} my {{families}} under the rose.' As a fact it was {{the best part of the}} only one, but the temptation to multiply exceedingly was almost overpowering. He checked himself, however, and went on eating partridge, <b>his</b> secret <b>irritation</b> crimsoning <b>his</b> cheeks; and he watched her eyes, those cold precise and round grey eyes, noting it, and knew she was thinking: 'He eats too much.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Then go to Amram, or to Pluto, {{and ask for}} the key of Hades for aught I care!" [...] replied <b>his</b> {{superior}} with <b>irritation.</b> [...] "He lives about {{a league}} off {{at the other end}} of the town." ...|$|R

6000|$|... "Shall {{we proceed}} {{to settle the}} {{conditions}} of the fight, Sir Percy?" [...] said Chauvelin, interrupting the flow of his antagonist's gibes, and trying to disguise <b>his</b> <b>irritation</b> beneath a mask of impassive reserve.|$|E
50|$|He {{also has}} an optimistic and easygoing {{personality}} that others usually find appealing, {{and he does not}} appear to stay depressed or downbeat for very long. He is quite modest, and this often works to his advantage when compared to the other, often more egotistical and aggressive, characters on the series. Zack's voice also gets raspier as the series progresses. In the episodes Voices of Authority and Atonement, Zack reveals <b>his</b> ongoing <b>irritation</b> with finding uniforms that fit properly.|$|R
60|$|Forces {{regardless}} of family or class or custom were beating down his guard; impending events over {{which he had}} no control threw their shadows on <b>his</b> head. The <b>irritation</b> of one accustomed to have his way was roused against he knew not what.|$|R
