25|$|Though already {{formed at}} Catterick, {{as a day}} bomber unit on 8 October 1917), No. 107 Squadron was not {{equipped}} with aircraft until 15 May 1918 at RFC Lake Down, Salisbury, when it received Airco DH.9s, which it took to the Western Front on 3 June of that year. The squadron became at {{first part of the}} 13th wing of the 3rd brigade, working up to operational status. Thereafter it was transferred to the 51st wing of the 9th brigade and it began operations from Drionville. Its main targets were enemy airfields, base areas and communication lines, which it continued to attack until the Armistice. The squadron's most successful raid was made on Saponay on 21 July 1918, where a large ammunition dump was hit. From the squadron's airfield, 20 miles away at Chailly, the reflection of the explosions and fire could be seen <b>going</b> <b>on</b> <b>all</b> the evening and throughout the night. Another notable raid was that made on the Aulnoye railway station and junction on 1 October 1918. Returning to Hounslow Heath Aerodrome in March 1919, it disbanded there on 30 June of that same year.|$|E
500|$|Wonderland was {{released}} for the Christmas market, and was labelled {{as a potential}} Christmas number one. Smith embarked on a promotional tour, beginning {{at the end of}} October, with magazine, television and radio appearances. Appearances included Ready Steady Cook, Blue Peter, the BBC News Channel, Sky News Sunrise, The Alan Titchmarsh Show and The Paul O'Grady Show. Speaking about the album's promotion, Smith said [...] "t is always a struggle when a second album comes out because you never know how it is going to do but fingers crossed people will enjoy it. I am very proud of it. ... I am excited about <b>going</b> <b>on</b> <b>all</b> the shows too – especially Ready Steady Cook because I can't cook and I think it will be fun." ...|$|E
500|$|Hooper has cited {{changes in}} the {{cultural}} and political landscape as central influences on the film. His intentional misinformation, that the [...] "film {{you are about to}} see is true", was a response to being [...] "lied to by the government about things that were <b>going</b> <b>on</b> <b>all</b> over the world", including Watergate, the 1973 oil crisis, and [...] "the massacres and atrocities in the Vietnam War". The [...] "lack of sentimentality and the brutality of things" [...] that Hooper noticed while watching the local news, whose graphic coverage was epitomized by [...] "showing brains spilled all over the road", led to his belief that [...] "man was the real monster here, just wearing a different face, so I put a literal mask on the monster in my film". The idea of using a chainsaw as the murder weapon came to Hooper {{while he was in the}} hardware section of a busy store, contemplating how to speed his way through the crowd.|$|E

500|$|Human {{evolution}} and {{the resilience of}} life may {{also be seen as}} key themes of Gravity. The film opens with the exploration of spacethe climax of human civilizationand ends with an allegory of the dawn of mankind when Dr. Ryan Stone fights her way out of the water after the crash-landing, passing a frog, grabs the soil, and slowly regains her capacity to stand upright and walk. Director Cuarón said, [...] "She’s in these murky waters almost like an amniotic fluid or a primordial soup. In which you see amphibians swimming. She crawls out of the water, not unlike early creatures in evolution. And then she goes on all fours. And after <b>going</b> <b>on</b> <b>all</b> fours she’s a bit curved until she is completely erect. It was the evolution of life in one, quick shot". Other imagery depicting the formation of life includes a scene in which Stone rests in an embryonic position, surrounded by a rope strongly resembling an umbilical cord. Stone's return from space, accompanied by meteorite-like debris, may be seen as a hint that elements essential to the development of life on Earth may have come from outer space in the form of meteorites.|$|E
500|$|Muddy Waters {{recorded}} After the Rain {{the following}} year, incorporating {{elements of the}} sound of Electric Mud. According to Cosey, [...] "I'll never forget, as soon as I walked into the studio for the follow-up and Muddy saw me, he threw his arms around me, said 'Hey, how you doing, boy, play some of that stuff you played on that last album.'" [...] Following strong criticism of the album, Muddy Waters claimed that he disliked the album and its sound, {{and that he did}} not consider the album to be blues. He stated, [...] "Every time I go into Chess, [...] put some un-blues players with me [...] If you change my sound, then you gonna change the whole man." [...] In the biography The Mojo Man, Muddy Waters stated [...] "That Electric Mud record was dogshit. But when it came out, it started selling like wild, but then they started sending them back. They said, 'This can't be Muddy Waters with all this shit <b>going</b> <b>on,</b> <b>all</b> this wha-wha and fuzztone.'" [...] AllMusic reviewer Richie Unterberger panned the album as being [...] "crass".|$|E
500|$|Olivia died of {{complications}} {{brought on by}} gall bladder disease on 3October1938. The day before her death she {{wrote in a letter}} to Dorothy: [...] "On Monday I was taken suddenly ill with gall bladder trouble—awful pain—sent for Doctor Barnes—he gave me dope & an injection and pain gradually went... He says I am <b>going</b> <b>on</b> <b>all</b> right, but of course I feel rather a wreck". She died the following day of a heart attack. John Unterecker believes Olivia's death shattered Yeats, who died only months later, because she added warmth to his life. Yeats wrote of her death:Olivia Shakespear has died suddenly. For more than forty years she has been the centre of my life in London and during all that time we have never had a quarrel, sadness sometimes but never a difference. When I first met her she was in her late twenties but in looks a lovely young girl. When she died she was a lovely old woman... She came of a long line of soldiers and during the last war thought it her duty to stay in London through all the air raids. She was not more lovely than distinguished—no matter what happened she never lost her solitude... For the moment I cannot bear the thought of London. I will find her memory everywhere.|$|E

500|$|The {{film has}} a 78% rating on Rotten Tomatoes and a 56 metascore on Metacritic. In his review for The New York Times, Vincent Canby, while quite {{critical}} of the film overall, praised Douglas' work as [...] "the funniest, canniest performance of his career". Roger Ebert gave the film three-and-a-half stars out of four and praised it for allowing [...] "all the financial wheeling and dealing to seem complicated and convincing, and yet always have it make sense. The movie can be followed by anybody, because the details of stock manipulation are all filtered through transparent layers of greed. Most {{of the time we}} know what's <b>going</b> <b>on.</b> <b>All</b> of the time, we know why". Time magazine's Richard Corliss wrote, [...] "This time he works up a salty sweat to end up nowhere, like a triathlete on a treadmill. But as long as he keeps his players in venal, perpetual motion, it is great scary fun to watch him work out". In his review for the Globe and Mail, Jay Scott praised the performances of the two leads: [...] "But Douglas's portrayal of Gordon Gekko is an oily triumph and as the kid Gekko thinks he has found in Fox ('Poor, smart and hungry; no feelings'), Charlie Sheen evolves persuasively from gung-ho capitalist child to wily adolescent corporate raider to morally appalled adult". Rita Kempley in the Washington Post wrote that the film [...] "is at its weakest when it preaches visually or verbally. Stone doesn't trust the time-honored story line, supplementing the obvious moral with plenty of soapboxery".|$|E

2500|$|Throughout Buechner's {{work his}} {{hallmark}} as a theologian and autobiographer is his {{regard for the}} appearance of the divine in daily life. By examining the day-to-day workings of his own life, Buechner seeks to find God's hand at work, thus leading his audience by example to similar introspection. The Reverend Samuel Lloyd describes his [...] "capacity to see into the heart of every day," [...] an ability that reflects the significance of daily events onto the reader's life as well.

2500|$|The Maddox Brothers and Rose were at [...] "the {{leading edge}} of rockabilly with the slapped bass that Fred Maddox had developed". Maddox said, [...] "You've got to have somethin' they can tap their foot, or dance to, or to make 'em feel it." [...] After World War II the band shifted into higher gear leaning more toward a {{whimsical}} honky-tonk feel, with a heavy, manic bottom end - the slap bass of Fred Maddox. [...] "They played hillbilly music but it sounded real hot. They played real loud for that time, too ..." [...] The Maddoxes were also known for their lively [...] "antics and stuff." [...] "We always {{put on a show}} ... I mean it just wasn't us up there pickin' and singing. There was something <b>going</b> <b>on</b> <b>all</b> the time." [...] "... the demonstrative Maddoxes, helped release white bodies from traditional motions of decorum... more and more younger white artists began to behave on stage like the lively Maddoxes." [...] Others believe that they were not only at the leading edge, but were one of the first Rockabilly groups, if not the first.|$|E
2500|$|Before {{the release}} of their debut album, the band {{recorded}} two demos in 1999 and 2000. In mid-2001, {{it was reported that}} Meacham had attempted suicide by drinking excessive amounts of cough syrup. The attempt affected the band's Take Action Tour. During his hospitalization he remained in poor condition and was replaced by Dameon Ash. In an interview, lead singer M. Shadows said of Meacham that [...] "he perma-fried his brain and was in a mental institution for a long time, and when you have someone in your band who does that, it ruins everything that's <b>going</b> <b>on</b> <b>all</b> around you, and it makes {{you want to do something}} to prevent it from happening to other people." [...] Avenged Sevenfold's debut album, Sounding the Seventh Trumpet, was recorded when the band members were in their late teens and still in high school. It was originally released on their first label, Good Life Recordings in 2001. When lead guitarist Synyster Gates joined the band after the album was released, the introductory track [...] "To End the Rapture" [...] was re-recorded featuring a full band element. The album was subsequently re-released on Hopeless Records in 2002. The band started to receive recognition, performing with bands such as Mushroomhead and Shadows Fall and playing on the Take Action Tour.|$|E

2500|$|From her {{official}} American {{debut in}} New York's Aeolian Hall on 20 January 1913, Leginska's {{popularity in the}} U.S. was growing, aided by both the careful staging of her performances, with well-thought-out lighting and decor {{to focus on the}} performer, and her distinctive style of dressing (favoring menswear) eagerly copied by her young fans, as well as her diminutive size and her youthful appearance that not only made the musical youth more likely to relate to her, but often misled not only her audiences but even the reviewers who would express their astonishment that a person so [...] "young" [...] displayed such skill as hers (this <b>going</b> <b>on</b> <b>all</b> the way into Leginska's late thirties, as made evident in the Detroit News critic Robert Kelly's description of her perform at 37). In 1923, Leginska went to London to study orchestral conducting with Eugene Goossens. She also studied conducting with Robert Heger, conductor of the Bavarian State Opera in Munich, proceeding to conduct as guest conductor with major orchestras in Munich, Paris, London or Berlin, taking advantage of her earlier contacts established when she performed as a pianist, as well as agreeing to also perform in a concerto on the programs. Being a woman conductor also helped her attract attention, as a novelty. She conducted a performance of her orchestral suite Quatre sujets barbares. In 1925, she made her debut as a conductor in the United States with the New York Symphony Orchestra in Carnegie Hall, after which she appeared with the Boston People's Orchestra in the spring and then performing at the Hollywood Bowl in the summer of 1925. She had suffered nervous breakdowns in 1909, 1925 and 1926. In 1926 she announced a permanent retirement from performing as a pianist and focused on conducting, composing and teaching.|$|E
