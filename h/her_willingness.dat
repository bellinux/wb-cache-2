5|$|On February 18, 2007, Moynahan's {{representative}} {{confirmed to}} People {{that she was}} more than three months pregnant, and that Brady is the father. On August 22, 2007, she gave birth to a baby boy, John Edward Thomas Moynahan. In a July 2008 interview in Harper's Bazaar, Moynahan discussed <b>her</b> <b>willingness</b> to raise her son as a single mother. Despite media reports that Moynahan and Brady have an acrimonious relationship, it was revealed that the two have maintained a civil relationship since the birth of their son.|$|E
5|$|The demands made on Beatrice {{during her}} mother's reign were high. Despite {{suffering}} from rheumatism, Beatrice {{was forced to}} endure her mother's love of cold weather. Beatrice's piano playing suffered as her rheumatism got gradually worse, eliminating an enjoyment in which she excelled; however, this did not change <b>her</b> <b>willingness</b> to cater to her mother's needs. Her effort did not go unnoticed by the British public.|$|E
5|$|Zampanò {{makes his}} living as an {{itinerant}} street performer, entertaining crowds by breaking an iron chain bound tightly across his chest, then passing the hat for tips. In short order, Gelsomina's naïve and antic nature emerges, with Zampanò's brutish methods presenting a callous foil. He teaches {{her to play}} the snare drum and trumpet, dance a bit, and clown for the audience. Despite <b>her</b> <b>willingness</b> to please, he relies on intimidation and even cruelty at times to maintain his domination.|$|E
60|$|By <b>her</b> {{soothing}} <b>willingness</b> to {{do anything}} for him, Siegmund knew that she was dogging him closely. He could not bear to have his anxiety protracted.|$|R
30|$|Mrs. Chen {{was clearly}} {{affected}} by the traditional gender order, and <b>her</b> unfulfilled <b>willingness</b> {{to take part in}} her husband’s company was also controlled by this gender order.|$|R
5000|$|She has {{not held}} senior {{government}} posts {{and has been}} described as [...] "one of the quietest women AMs ... whose effectiveness lies in <b>her</b> quiet <b>willingness</b> to discuss".|$|R
5|$|Reviewer Jennifer Malkowski {{feels that}} Lana {{is one of}} the most gullible {{characters}} on television. According to Malkowski, Lana's strong feminist stance, and her request that people should stop protecting her and start telling her the truth, are diluted by <b>her</b> <b>willingness</b> to believe whatever pieces of information she gets, even if they are lies. After the series ended, Gough and Millar expressed regret with Lana's characterization throughout the course of the show, which they felt damaged Lana in the audiences' mind. Gough and Millar believed that Lana's behavior toward Clark (for refusing to reveal his secret) made her come across as cold and unsympathetic.|$|E
5|$|After {{leaving her}} union post in 1908 Bondfield worked as organising {{secretary}} for the WLL and later as women's officer for the National Union of General and Municipal Workers (NUGMW). She {{was elected to the}} TUC Council in 1918, and became its chairman in 1923, the year she was first elected to parliament. In the short-lived minority Labour government of 1924 she served as parliamentary secretary in the Ministry of Labour. Her term of cabinet office in 1929–31 was marked by the economic crises that beset the second Labour government. <b>Her</b> <b>willingness</b> to contemplate cuts in unemployment benefits alienated her from much of the Labour movement, although she did not follow Ramsay MacDonald into the National Government that assumed office when the Labour government fell in August 1931.|$|E
5|$|Wollstonecraft {{was born}} on 27 April 1759 in Spitalfields, London. She was {{the second of the}} seven {{children}} of Elizabeth Dixon and Edward John Wollstonecraft. Although her family had a comfortable income when she was a child, her father gradually squandered it on speculative projects. Consequently, the family became financially unstable and they were frequently forced to move during Wollstonecraft's youth. The family's financial situation eventually became so dire that Wollstonecraft's father compelled her to turn over money that she would have inherited at her maturity. Moreover, he was apparently a violent man who would beat his wife in drunken rages. As a teenager, Wollstonecraft used to lie outside the door of her mother's bedroom to protect her. Wollstonecraft played a similar maternal role for her sisters, Everina and Eliza, throughout her life. For example, in a defining moment in 1784, she convinced Eliza, who was suffering from what was probably postpartum depression, to leave her husband and infant; Wollstonecraft made all of the arrangements for Eliza to flee, demonstrating <b>her</b> <b>willingness</b> to challenge social norms. The human costs, however, were severe: her sister suffered social condemnation and, because she could not remarry, was doomed to a life of poverty and hard work.|$|E
500|$|Kerr writes [...] "Stone's {{personality}} was striking: <b>her</b> unquestioning <b>willingness</b> to {{take responsibility}} for other peoples actions; her [...] "workaholic" [...] habits; her self doubt; her desire for control." ...|$|R

50|$|Holbrow’s {{training}} reflects <b>her</b> quirky <b>willingness</b> {{to tackle}} a vast variety of media, subjects and issues: she lists auto-body training {{along with more}} conventional pursuits such as stone carving on her vitae.|$|R
25|$|The same year, sailor Mauricio Ruiz {{became the}} first serving member of the Armed Forces to {{publicly}} assume his homosexuality. Ruiz said that what was most important was not a soldier's sexual orientation, but his or <b>her</b> <b>willingness</b> to serve the country. His announcement came with the full backing of the Chilean Navy.|$|E
25|$|On 20 May 2005, Halonen held a {{press conference}} in Mäntyniemi where she {{announced}} <b>her</b> <b>willingness</b> to run for a second term. Officially, this was the desired answer for the SDP delegation that had visited her two days earlier. In addition to her own party's support, the leader of the Left Alliance, Suvi-Anne Siimes, gave her support for Halonen's future campaign.|$|E
25|$|Ringer {{charged that}} the Librarian of Congress failed to follow {{personnel}} regulations and appointed Cary because of sex discrimination and race discrimination. She noted to her superior qualifications, including her experience and performance reviews, as evidence of sex discrimination. Ringer also pointed to <b>her</b> <b>willingness</b> to speak openly about racial problems and her advocacy {{for the rights of}} African American employees as evidence of racial discrimination.|$|E

50|$|In 1984 Eaton married {{sculptor}} Paul Robert Cooper. The couple's {{daughter was}} born shortly before Eaton was named executive producer of Masterpiece. She credits <b>her</b> husband's <b>willingness</b> {{to stay at home}} with having advanced her career.|$|R

25|$|In May, Hou {{dropped out}} of the current Women's World Championship cycle, {{effectively}} relinquishing the crown. She explained her reasons in a Chessbase interview, mainly objecting to the format wherein the Women's World Champion is decided alternately by a knockout tournament and then a match. She also expressed <b>her</b> <b>willingness</b> to participate in the cycle if the format were amended to mirror that of the World Chess Championship.|$|E
25|$|The {{relationship}} {{continues after}} the school term ends. Sleigh rides {{give way to}} buggy rides in the spring, and Laura impresses Almanzo with <b>her</b> <b>willingness</b> to help break his new and often temperamental horses. Laura's old nemesis, Nellie Oleson, makes a brief appearance during two Sunday buggy rides with Almanzo. Nellie's chatter and flirtatious behavior towards Almanzo annoys Laura. Shortly thereafter, Nellie moves back to New York after her family loses their homestead.|$|E
25|$|In December 2012, she {{was convicted}} of drug {{smuggling}} at Denpasar District Court {{and sentenced to death}} by firing squad in January 2013. By contrast, the others involved in the case were convicted of lesser drugs-related offences and received custodial sentences. Prosecutors had recommended Sandiford should also receive a custodial sentence because of <b>her</b> <b>willingness</b> to cooperate with police, but the panel of judges overseeing the hearing felt her actions had undermined Indonesia's anti-drugs policy and concluded there were no mitigating circumstances in her favour.|$|E
50|$|Eve shows <b>her</b> first <b>willingness</b> to {{occasionally}} break {{rules by}} using Roarke's resources to illegally hack into the finances {{of the police}} chief, whereupon she finds that he's received enormous donations from DeBlass and also has millions of unreported dollars in overseas accounts. She feeds the information to Nadine Furst, effectively ridding herself of the interfering and criminal Simpson.|$|R
60|$|After all, our {{interrogation}} {{of the doctor}} was quite unnecessary. We were admitted at once to the Grange by a neatly-dressed parlour-maid. Mrs. Smith-Lessing was at home, and the girl did not for a moment seem to doubt <b>her</b> mistress's <b>willingness</b> to receive us. As she busied herself poking the fire and opening wider the thick curtains, Ray asked her another question.|$|R
60|$|Margaret's behaviour, when I {{mentioned}} to <b>her</b> Mr. Mannion's <b>willingness</b> {{to be useful}} to us both, rather increased than diminished the vague uncertainties which perplexed me, {{on the subject of}} accepting or rejecting his overtures.|$|R
25|$|Sasha Grey (born Marina Ann Hantzis; March 14, 1988) is an American actress, model, and musician, {{and former}} pornographic actress. She first made {{her name in}} {{mainstream}} media after appearing on several popular television programs and in pop culture magazines, examining <b>her</b> <b>willingness</b> to enter the world of hardcore porn at a young age. She has also been featured in movies, television shows, music videos and advertising campaigns. She won numerous awards for her work in pornography between 2007 and 2010, including the Female Performer of the Year at the 2008 AVN Awards.|$|E
25|$|Some {{women were}} praised {{in the books}} of Ruth and Esther. The Book of Ruth is about a young Moabite woman's loyalty to her Jewish {{mother-in-law}} and <b>her</b> <b>willingness</b> to move to Israel and {{become a part of}} their culture. The story ends with her praise and blessing as she is married to an Israelite and subsequently King David comes from her lineage. In the Book of Esther, a young woman named Esther of Jewish lineage is praised for her bravery as the queen of Persia who saved many from being killed by her pleas to the king.|$|E
25|$|Parvati is {{expressed}} in many roles, moods, epithets and aspects. In Hindu mythology, she is an active agent of the universe, the power of Shiva. She {{is expressed}} in nurturing and benevolent aspects, as well as destructive and ferocious aspects. She {{is the voice of}} encouragement, reason, freedom and strength, as well as of resistance, power, action and retributive justice. This paradox symbolizes <b>her</b> <b>willingness</b> to realign to Pratima (reality) and adapt to needs of circumstances in her role as the universal mother. She identifies and destroys evil to protect (Durga), as well as creates food and abundance to nourish (Annapurna).|$|E
50|$|They were a notably devoted couple {{but had no}} children. They did, however, {{care for}} the young Frederick Stewart while his father, Charles, Lord Castlereagh's half-brother, was serving in the army. Her devotion to her husband, {{combined}} with her love of foreign travel, well equipped Emily {{for the life of}} a diplomat's wife, and she was noted for <b>her</b> constant <b>willingness</b> to accompany <b>her</b> husband abroad, no matter how rigorous the journey.|$|R
50|$|Like Jospin, {{other party}} elders largely {{rejected}} Royal too, partly for <b>her</b> perceived <b>willingness</b> to modify classic Socialist principles, {{but also for}} her relatively flamboyant and charismatic campaign style, unconventional in French politics. Her personal relationship with Socialist Party leader François Hollande complicated the situation: she was his longtime domestic partner, and mother of their four children. Hollande, who had harbored ambitions of his own for the primary, acquiesced to his partner and thereafter attempted to remain officially neutral.|$|R
5000|$|Some {{fans have}} {{considered}} this as her response to Nightwish's [...] "Bye Bye Beautiful" [...] from the album Dark Passion Play (2007), {{which was a}} song directed towards her. The song was a declaration of <b>her</b> independence and <b>willingness</b> to move on.|$|R
25|$|Rise {{says that}} the white {{community}} disdained Ruby Floyd for her missionary work with the Jehovah's Witnesses and for <b>her</b> <b>willingness</b> to enter the black part of Martinsville. The prosecution pointed out that Floyd had had gone to an area considered unsafe for white women, ignored warnings of black residents of staying too long there, and not been attentive to her surroundings or the men she passed. A relative of the Hairstons has said that their family tradition always said that Floyd had been {{having an affair with}} one of the defendants, but this was not explored at trial.|$|E
25|$|Since {{the arrest}} power {{is meant to}} ensure the defendant's {{presence}} in court, lawyers defending the white-collar criminals who have been perp-walked since the late 1980s have complained it is unnecessary and superfluous in their clients' cases, {{even if it does}} give the appearance of preferential treatment for wealthy defendants. Lea Fastow, the wife of former Enron executive Andrew Fastow, cited the perp walk she was made to take even though she had expressed <b>her</b> <b>willingness</b> to surrender to a summons in an unsuccessful motion for a change of venue. Some, like Martha Stewart, have still managed to avoid being perp-walked by responding to summonses, or surrendering in the courtroom as soon as the indictment is presented in open court.|$|E
25|$|Most pornographic {{films are}} {{directed}} at a heterosexual male viewer, {{and the primary}} focus and most on-screen time is on the women in them. Pornographic films attempt to present a sexual fantasy and actresses are selected {{on their ability to}} create or fit that fantasy. Many times the fantasy can be an actress' physical features and appearance, such as figure, breast size, hair style, ethnicity, as well as on <b>her</b> <b>willingness</b> and expertise in performing particular sex acts. Actresses are required to present a positive attitude to on-screen sexual performance with all sex acts being presented as enjoyable and joyfully entered into. Actresses are usually presented as always being available and willing to engage in any sex acts that their on-screen partner, as the proxy of the viewer, wishes.|$|E
25|$|Bush {{campaigned for}} her son George W., after his {{announcement}} of a presidential campaign in June 1999. Throughout the country, she met with women {{in support of his}} campaign, but remained doubtful of his chances of winning. The resentment toward the campaign continued with her rejecting any criticism of her son said in her presence and refused to watch any debates, a contrast to <b>her</b> husband's <b>willingness</b> to listen and his watching of every debate, creating friction between the couple.|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh!" [...] she exclaimed, {{but not in}} offence. Once {{more she}} relapsed into thought. And as he watched her, in silence, the colour that flowed and ebbed in her cheeks {{registered}} the coming and going of memories; of incidents in her life hidden from him, arousing in the man the torture of jealousy. But his faculties, keenly alert, grasped the entire field; marked once more the empirical trait in her that he loved <b>her</b> unflinching <b>willingness</b> to submit herself to an experiment.|$|R
50|$|Trixie toured {{with many}} theatre {{companies}} {{in the coming years}} working her way from roles in the chorus to more prominently featured roles with speaking parts. Part of her success can be attributed to <b>her</b> constant <b>willingness</b> to step in and take over roles when others fell ill or could not appear. These instances provided her an opportunity to demonstrate her ability and ingenuity. She impressed agents, audiences and other actors alike with her stellar singing voice and ability to command audiences with her humorous interpretation of characters.|$|R
