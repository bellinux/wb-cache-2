5|$|An {{assessment}} of {{the potential impact of}} climate change on this species found that its range is unlikely to contract and may actually grow, depending on how <b>effectively</b> it migrates into newly habitable areas.|$|E
5|$|Animals {{such as the}} {{flounder}} {{have the}} ability to adapt their camouflage patterns to suit the background, and they do so extremely <b>effectively,</b> selecting patterns that match the spatial scales of the current background.|$|E
5|$|Aspirin, {{either by}} itself or in a {{combined}} formulation, <b>effectively</b> treats {{certain types of}} a headache, but its efficacy may be questionable for others. Secondary headaches, meaning those caused by another disorder or trauma, should be promptly treated by a medical provider.|$|E

5|$|Dysprosium iodide and {{dysprosium}} bromide {{are used}} in high-intensity metal-halide lamps. These compounds dissociate near the hot center of the lamp, releasing isolated dysprosium atoms. The latter re-emit light in the green and red part of the spectrum, thereby <b>effectively</b> producing bright light.|$|E
5|$|Food {{power is}} an {{integral}} part of the politics of food. The idea of food power is used in embargoes, employment, and food politics. In order for a nation to utilize food power <b>effectively,</b> the nation must <b>effectively</b> apply and display scarcity, supply concentration, demand dispersion, and action independence. The four main nations that export enough agriculture to be able to exert food power are the United States, Canada, Australia, and New Zealand. On the smaller scale, particularly in some African countries, food power has been used as a weapon by opposing sides in internal wars and conflicts against their own people.|$|E
5|$|Frustrated by Portugal's inaction, Fretilin leaders {{believed}} they could ward off Indonesian advances more <b>effectively</b> if they declared an independent East Timor. National Political Commissioner Mari Alkatiri conducted a diplomatic tour of Africa, gathering support from governments there and elsewhere.|$|E

5|$|Groom's {{dispute with}} Paramount was later <b>effectively</b> {{resolved}} after Groom declared {{he was satisfied}} with Paramount's explanation of their accounting, this coinciding with Groom receiving a seven-figure contract with Paramount for film rights to another of his books, Gump & Co.|$|E
5|$|Harrison's {{death was}} a {{disappointment}} to Whigs, who hoped to pass a revenue tariff and enact measures to support Henry Clay's American system. John Tyler, Harrison's successor and a former Democrat, abandoned the Whig agenda, <b>effectively</b> cutting himself off from the party.|$|E
5|$|However, {{his illness}} {{prevented}} him from <b>effectively</b> establishing policies and measures to achieve this, and such moves as {{he was able to}} make were later abandoned by his son and successor, Wilhelm II.|$|E
5|$|However, {{without the}} ability to <b>effectively</b> track weak laser signals, {{collection}} of atmospheric data would be relegated to times of day where the sun's electromagnetic emissions did not drown out the laser's signal. The addition of an atomic line filter to the LIDAR equipment <b>effectively</b> filters interference to the laser's signal {{to the point where}} LIDAR data can be collected at any time of the day. For the past decade, Faraday filters have been used to do this. Consequently, scientists know significantly more today about the Earth's middle atmosphere than they did before the advent of the FADOF.|$|E
5|$|In 1895, Congress {{passed a}} new Courts Act which removed the {{remaining}} Indian Territory {{jurisdiction of the}} Western District, effective September 1, 1896. This <b>effectively</b> closed the federal court for the Western District of Arkansas by removing its jurisdiction.|$|E
5|$|In 2012, Blomqvist <b>effectively</b> {{retired as}} a footballer by {{focusing}} on his civilian career. He did this by initiating studies in commerce. Blomqvist competed in and won the celebrity dance show Let's Dance 2017 on TV4.|$|E
5|$|In August 2011, in {{response}} to Apple Inc.'s patent infringement lawsuit against Samsung, the latter argued that Apple's iPad was <b>effectively</b> modeled on the visual tablets that appear aboard spaceship Discovery in the Space Odyssey film, which constitute prior art.|$|E
5|$|In December 2016, a {{compromise}} with the European Union was attained <b>effectively</b> canceling quotas on EU citizens but still allowing for favorable treatment of Swiss-based job applicants.|$|E
5|$|In February 2006 {{there were}} rumours that a 'third party' (believed to be a {{consortium}} headed by banker Sir Adrian Montague) had {{expressed an interest}} in buying out the present partners in the project. LCR shareholders rejected the proposal, and the government, which <b>effectively</b> could overrule shareholders' decisions as a result of LCR's reclassification as a state-owned body, decided that discussions with shareholders would not take place imminently, <b>effectively</b> backing shareholders' views on the proposed takeover.|$|E
5|$|In late 1980, the VFL withdrew {{recognition}} of the AFLPA, <b>effectively</b> leaving the players without a negotiating body.|$|E
5|$|Italy now <b>effectively</b> {{became an}} {{occupied}} country, as the Germans poured in troops. Italy's decision to switch sides created {{contempt for the}} Italians among both the Allies and Germans, which was to have far-reaching consequences.|$|E
5|$|James Palermo, {{artistic and}} general {{director}} of the Grant Park Music Festival felt that the musicians were able to interact more <b>effectively</b> with the new sound system because {{they were able to}} hear each other better.|$|E
5|$|Lead-ions (Pb), like magnesium-ions (Mg), blocks NMDA receptors. Since {{the normal}} Pb {{concentration}} in the extracellular fluid is low (adult average of 120mg), even a low increase in Pb concentration has a significant positive affect on the blockage of NMDA-receptors. Therefore, an increase in Pb concentration, will, <b>effectively,</b> inhibit ongoing long-term potentiations (LTPs), and lead to an abnormal increase long-term depression (LDPs) on neurons on the effected parts of the nervous system. These abnormalities lead to the indirect downregulation of NMDA-receptors, <b>effectively</b> initiating a positive feedback-loop for LDP. The targeting of NMDA receptors {{is thought to be}} one of the main causes for lead's toxicity to neurons.|$|E
5|$|Like palladium, {{powdered}} osmium <b>effectively</b> absorbs hydrogen atoms. This {{could make}} osmium a potential {{candidate for a}} metal-hydride battery electrode. However, osmium is expensive and would react with potassium hydroxide, the most common battery electrolyte.|$|E
5|$|Michael {{was almost}} 16 {{when his father}} fell fatally ill; the annual trip to Denmark was cancelled. On 1 November 1894, Alexander III died at the {{untimely}} age of 49. Michael's eldest brother, Nicholas, became Tsar, and Michael's childhood was <b>effectively</b> over.|$|E
5|$|New {{restrictor}} rules {{brought the}} RS Spyder's power down to approximately , and the wingspan was {{limited by the}} rules, <b>effectively</b> decreasing downforce.|$|E
5|$|On January 16, 2012, Hughes {{signed a}} one-year deal worth $3.25 million that {{included}} incentives, <b>effectively</b> avoiding arbitration. His deal was a $500,000 raise from his disappointing 2011 season.|$|E

President Lincoln signed the amendment into law on July 17. Wilson's law paid African Americans in the military $10 monthly, which was <b>effectively</b> $7 a month after deductions for food and clothing, while white soldiers were paid <b>effectively</b> $14 monthly.|$|E
