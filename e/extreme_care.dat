5|$|Neptunium {{reacts with}} {{hydrogen}} {{in a similar}} manner to its neighbor plutonium, forming the hydrides NpH2+x (face-centered cubic) and NpH3 (hexagonal). These are isostructural with the corresponding plutonium hydrides, although unlike PuH2+x, the lattice parameters of NpH2+x become greater as the hydrogen content (x) increases. The hydrides require <b>extreme</b> <b>care</b> in handling as they decompose in a vacuum at 300°C to form finely divided neptunium metal, which is pyrophoric.|$|E

60|$|It appears {{they were}} at their wits' end what to do, the stores being so low that we must have been starved into {{surrender}} long before help came. But our best hope, it was decided, was to kill off the buccaneers until they either hauled down their flag or ran away with the HISPANIOLA. From nineteen they were already reduced to fifteen, two others were wounded, and one at least--the man shot beside the gun--severely wounded, if he were not dead. Every time we had a crack at them, we were to take it, saving our own lives, with the <b>extremest</b> <b>care.</b> And besides that, we had two able allies--rum and the climate.|$|R
25|$|The {{polarity}} of the solvent has {{a profound}} effect on the course of SmI2 reductions. Increasing the polarity of the reaction medium generally makes SmI2 a stronger reducing agent. HMPA may be used for this purpose; however, HMPA is a known carcinogen and should be handled with <b>extreme</b> <b>care.</b>|$|E

25|$|<b>Extreme</b> <b>care</b> must {{be taken}} in the {{management}} and disposal of sharps waste. The goal in sharps waste management is to safely handle all materials until they can be properly disposed. The final step in the disposal of sharps waste is to dispose of them in an autoclave.

Steps {{must be taken}} {{along the way to}} minimize the risk of injury from this material, while maximizing the amount of sharps material disposed.|$|E
25|$|Of the {{diseases}} {{that have been}} identified as potential biological control agents, the fungal pathogen Myrothecium verrucaria {{has been shown to be}} very promising. Disease development is very high at around 30 to 40 degrees Celsius which matches field conditions. In addition, the fungus does not spread outside of areas where it is applied. However, one major drawback of this biological control agent is that it is highly toxic to mammals so <b>extreme</b> <b>care</b> would have to be taken in handling this organism. Other pathogens have been tested as potential biological control agents but have proven to be ineffective.|$|E
25|$|Nuclear weapons {{continued}} to be tested in the Cold War, especially in the earlier stages of their development. The toll on the worst-affected populations and the growth since then in understanding about the critical threat to human health posed by radioactivity {{has also been a}} prohibitive complication associated with nuclear power. Though <b>extreme</b> <b>care</b> is practiced in that industry, the potential for disaster suggested by incidents such as those at Three Mile Island and Chernobyl pose a lingering specter of public mistrust. Worldwide publicity has been intense on those disasters. Widespread support for test ban treaties has ended almost all nuclear testing in the atmosphere.|$|E

His own memory, however, never failed him, and the traditions recorded by him are reliable. When his brother Rami says, in one place, that a certain sentence of Rav's, quoted by Judah, should be disregarded (Ḥul. 44a), he does not question the accuracy of Judah's citation, but implies that Rav had afterward abandoned the opinion quoted by Judah, and had, in a statement which the latter had not heard, adopted an opposite view.|$|E
25|$|Christchurch {{was popular}} with smugglers {{for a number}} of reasons: Firstly, the only land {{approaches}} to the town were across two bridges, and one of these was frequently out of use. The other could easily be blocked, perhaps by a herd of sheep or a heavy cart, giving the smugglers time for a leisurely escape. Secondly, it was close to the Cotentin Peninsula but not so close that a boat placed mid channel could observe both coasts. In good weather the coast of France is visible from the Kent coast but a vessel crossing to and from Dorset would be out of site for almost half the journey, and would therefore be able to claim it had come from another port or had been involved in the business of fishing. The beaches around Christchurch were sandy and gently sloping so boats could be run ashore without fear of damage. Although remote from its neighbours, cut off by heathland and forest, the roads inland were good; added to which the two rivers provided alternative routes for contraband, at a time when transport by water was faster and cheaper than overland movement of goods. Finally, there was the harbour itself. The entrance to which is a narrow channel, the Run, which was negotiable only with <b>extreme</b> <b>care.</b> Entering the harbour was made even more difficult by sandbanks that could shift overnight. To the smugglers, most of whom were professional and experienced seamen the harbour entrance was an open gate. But to the less skilled sailors on the revenue cutters, who had no local knowledge, the Run acted as 'a barrier that they feared to pass'.|$|E

[...] The {{admission}} may have done Chekhov a disservice, since early manuscripts reveal that he often wrote with <b>extreme</b> <b>care,</b> continually revising. Grigorovich's advice nevertheless inspired a more serious, artistic ambition in the twenty-six-year-old. In 1888, with a little string-pulling by Grigorovich, the short story collection At Dusk (V Sumerkakh) won Chekhov the coveted Pushkin Prize [...] "for the best literary production distinguished by high artistic worth." ...|$|E
40|$|The {{principles}} {{of equality and}} equity, respectively in the Bill of Rights and the white paper on health, provide the moral and legal foundations for future health care for children in South Africa. However, given <b>extreme</b> health <b>care</b> need and scarce resources, the government faces formidable obstacles if it hopes to achieve a just allocation of public health care resources, especially among children in need of highly specialised health care. In this regard, there is a dearth of moral analysis which is practically useful in the South African situation. We offer a set of moral considerations to guide the macro-allocation of highly specialised public health care services among South Africa's children. We also mention moral considerations which should inform micro-allocation...|$|R
5|$|The {{length and}} nature of parental care varies widely amongst {{different}} orders and species. At one <b>extreme,</b> parental <b>care</b> in megapodes ends at hatching; the newly hatched chick digs itself out of the nest mound without parental assistance and can fend for itself immediately. At the other extreme, many seabirds have extended periods of parental care, the longest being that of the great frigatebird, whose chicks take {{up to six months}} to fledge and are fed by the parents for up to an additional 14 months. The chick guard stage describes the period of breeding during which one of the adult birds is permanently present at the nest after chicks have hatched. The main purpose of the guard stage is to aid offspring to thermoregulate and protect them from predation.|$|R
40|$|The {{proposal}} of focusing the {{attention on the}} two apparent <b>extremes</b> of <b>care</b> (on one side the public health relevance and transferability of the paradygm of EBM, {{on the other side}} one of the expected clinical yields of genomic-translational research) aims to underline and exemplify the strict complementarity of the two scenarios. Methodologically and operationally, both approaches do propose a very promising future for the development of pharmacological research, with closer links to the highly productive area of outcomes-oriented epidemiology and with the most advanced sector of basic sciences. It seems specifically important that the two areas could be developed in close interaction, possibly within the same department(s), to assure a productive interplay of competences in the collaboration with clinical care, {{as well as in the}} training of the new generations of pharmacologists, pharmacists, clinicians...|$|R
500|$|In a Famitsu interview, Akitaya {{explained}} {{that one of}} his biggest challenges was, [...] "getting the protagonist, who is the [...] 'player' in the game, and making him into a character named Makoto Yuki for the film, then figuring out how to integrate him [...] into the story." [...] Akitaya went about constructing Makoto's character with <b>extreme</b> <b>care</b> in terms of speech, gestures and behavior all the while staying true to what was already established in the game. Akitaya admitted that he {{would not have been able}} to meet the expectations of the individual fans of the game since they were able to choose their own unique name and personality for the Protagonist. He instead incorporated the most general traits of the Protagonist from fan reaction to form Yuki's character. Akitaya had joked that during initial pre-production the Protagonist's name was still not determined and had proposed the placeholder, [...] until the first draft was developed. However even as Kumagai began working on the script, the placeholder went unchanged for the next four to five months and Akitaya found himself growing steadily attached despite eventually changing it. Akitaya stated that his favorite scene in the film occurred when Makoto summoned his Persona for the first time. He elaborated that Makoto's maniacal laugh helped give depth to the scene and establish Watabe's character designs as being one of the film's main attractions.|$|E

40|$|A new {{measurement}} device is presented. <b>Extreme</b> design <b>care</b> {{is devoted to}} achieve a closer relation between {{the structure of the}} mathematical description and the finite-resolution properties of physical detectors that characterize any real measurement process, than previous attempts described in scientific and technical literature. In fact, experimental data are captured by means of a pair of active sensors, placed at a relative fixed distance, working in a coupled arrangement. The presented device operates in a discrete variable domain. Beyond the operational advantages in term of simplicity and computational speed, it agrees with the results of biological observation which reveals that highly structured data always come from coupled transducing bio-elements. A numerical example is presented: an optimal computational precision level can be selected according to the required output precision. Furthermore, it can be showed that for that required precision, the output discrete data set is consistent under inversion transformation...|$|R

You {{see again}} the {{resemblance}} in the earnestness of both figures, in the unbroken arcs of their backs, in {{the breaking of}} the octagon moulding by the pointed angles; and here, even also in the general conception of the heads. But again, in the one of Painting, the hair is struck with more vulgar indenting and drilling, and the Gothic of the picture frame is less precise in touch and later in style. Observe, however,--and this may perhaps give us some definite hint for clearing the question,--a picture-frame would be less precise in making, and later in style, properly, than cusped arches to be put under the feet of the inventor of all musical sound by breath of man. And if you will now compare finally the eager tilting of the workman's seat in 22 and 6, and the working of the wood in the painter's low table for his pots of colour, and his three-legged stool, with that of Tubal Cain's anvil block; {{and the way in which}} the lines of the forge and upper triptych are in each composition used to set off the rounding of the head, I believe you will have little hesitation in accepting my own view of the matter--namely, that the three pieces of the Fathers of the Arts were wrought with Giotto's <b>extremest</b> <b>care</b> for the most precious stones of his tower; that also, being a sculptor and painter, he did the other two, but with quite definite and wilful resolve that they should be, as mere symbols of his own two trades, wholly inferior to the other subjects of the patriarchs; that he made the Sculpture picturesque and bold as you see it is, and showed all a sculptor's tricks in the work of it; and a sculptor's Greek subject, Bacchus, for the model of it; that he wrought the Painting, as the higher art, with more care, still keeping it subordinate to the primal subjects, but showed, for a lesson to all the generations of painters for evermore,--this one lesson, like his circle of pure line containing all others,--'Your soul and body must be all in every touch.' ...|$|R
