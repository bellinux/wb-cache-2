40|$|AbstractLiquid Gas for Vehicles (LGV) is an {{alternative}} fuel for land transportation sector besides gasoline. Until now, fuel conversion program from gasoline to <b>gas</b> <b>fuel</b> has not been fully implemented in Indonesia, as the availability of <b>gas</b> <b>fuel</b> distribution infrastructure is far behind the gasoline distribution infrastructure. This research was conducted {{to find out the}} necessity of <b>gas</b> <b>fuel</b> distribution infrastructure development as well as the feasibility of gasoline to <b>gas</b> <b>fuel</b> conversion implementation. The phases on this research were potential estimation of <b>gas</b> <b>fuel</b> necessity for public transportation, analysis of gasoline supply chain, analysis of the necessity of LGV distribution infrastructure development and simulation of <b>gas</b> <b>fuel</b> supply chain economic system using project financing scenario. The result of infrastructure analysis produced a recommendation of 11 new units of LGV filling stations in big cities on Java Island. The economical price for, LGV is as much as IDR 8, 392 /LSP. Based on this calculation, recommendation of LGV was only for executive cabs...|$|R

40|$|Currently, {{nearly all}} {{refrigeration}} systems in industrial processes {{are driven by}} electric motors. Natural gas has a negligible share of the industrial refrigeration market. The objective {{of this study was}} to identify opportunities for and potential barriers to the use of <b>gas</b> <b>fueled</b> refrigeration in industrial processes. A large number of industrial processes were surveyed to determine their potential for <b>gas</b> <b>fueled</b> refrigeration. Three processes were selected for further analysis using Pinch Technology.

40|$|A {{compression}} ignition engine with a mechanical fuel system was converted into common rail fuel system {{by means of a}} self-developed electronic control unit. The engine was modified to be operated with mixtures of diesel and natural <b>gas</b> <b>fuels</b> in dual-fuel mode. Then, diesel fuel was injected into the cylinder while natural gas was injected into intake manifold with both injectors controlled with the electronic control unit. Energy content of the sprayed <b>gas</b> <b>fuel</b> was varied in the amounts of 0 % (only diesel fuel), 15 %, 40 %, and 75 % of total fuel’s energy content. All tests were carried out at constant engine speed of 1500 [*]r/min at full load. In addition to the experiments, the engine was modeled with a one-dimensional commercial software. The experimental and numerical results were compared and found to be in reasonable agreement with each other. Both NOx and soot emissions were dropped with 15 % and 40 %, respectively, energy content rates in gas–fuel mixture compared to only diesel fuel. However, an increase was observed in carbon monoxide emissions with 15 % natural <b>gas</b> <b>fuel</b> addition compared to only diesel fuel. Although smoke emission was reduced with natural <b>gas</b> <b>fuel</b> addition, there was a dramatic increase in NOx emissions with 75 % natural <b>gas</b> <b>fuel</b> addition...|$|R
