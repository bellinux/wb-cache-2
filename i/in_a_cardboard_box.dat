25|$|William's {{interest}} in natural history {{appears to have}} been further fostered in early life by interactions with Rev. P.B. Brodie, an enthusiastic zoologist and geologist.

25|$|Gray was {{a regular}} {{customer}} at Galaxy Books and Records in Lower Stuart Street, Dunedin. Bill Brosnan, the store owner, knew him for seven years {{and said he was}} a fan of military books and Soldier of Fortune magazine. In January 1990, he threatened an assistant of the bookshop with {{what appeared to be a}} shotgun <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>cardboard</b> <b>box,</b> and Brosnan served him with a trespass notice in February. His sister said he was an animal lover. Locals said this was a source of conflict with his next-door neighbour Garry Holden, whose pets kept dying.|$|E
25|$|From a {{young age}} on his family estate in Sterrebeek, Derscheid {{developed}} an interest in ornithology and aviculture. He built a research station for bird behavior called Armendy Farm that {{was active in the}} 1930s. In cooperation with colleagues in France, England, Germany, the United States and Australia he succeeded in assembling one of the best captive breeding bird collections in Europe, specializing in Anatidae and Loriinae (ducks, swans, geese; and the group of small parrots consisting of lories and lorikeets). Derscheid also kept the omnivorous alpine parrots from New Zealand known as keas. There, he researched dietary requirements and incubation, sending specimens to zoos throughout Europe, America, and Australia. He was particularly interested in aspergillosis, a bronchial disease caused by mold that decimated flocks of wild sea ducks as he tried to acclimatize them to the freshwater park environment, but which Derscheid succeeded in curing. Derscheid's techniques were widely adopted and applied, most notably at the nature reserve in Zwin (Belgium), known for its collections of salt-resistant plants and an aviary specializing in wading birds. An obituary of Derscheid states: “His collection at Sterrebeek was known throughout Europe, America and Australasia, and his success with the Anatidae, particularly with the sea-duck, placed him in the forefront of waterfowl experts.” Prior to the outbreak of World War II, Derscheid transferred some of his collection of exotic birds to the late John J. Yealland, who carried them <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>cardboard</b> <b>box</b> on one of the last boats to leave Belgium before the German invasion. Later the Curator of Birds at the London Zoo, Yealland also published on Derscheid's bird collections from notes prepared during the latter's imprisonment.|$|E

500|$|Parker Brothers was {{acquired}} by General Mills in February 1968. The first Monopoly edition in Braille is published in 1973. Also in 1973, as the Atlantic City Commissioner of Public Works considered name changes for Baltic and Mediterranean Avenues, fans of the board game, {{with support from the}} president of Parker Brothers, successfully lobbied for the city to keep the names. After Parker Brothers was taken over by General Mills, the Monopoly license to Waddingtons was renegotiated (as was the Clue/Cluedo license to Parker Brothers/General Mills by Waddingtons). By 1974, Parker Brothers had sold 80 million sets of the game. In 1975, another anniversary edition was produced, but this edition came <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>cardboard</b> <b>box</b> looking much like a standard edition. Parker Brothers was under management by General Mills as the first six Monopoly Tournaments were held. See [...] "The Monopoly Tournaments" [...] below.|$|E

500|$|When {{her father}} was jailed for 18 months after being convicted of fraud, she left home with her sister {{to live with her}} mother and partner (Crossroads actor Charles Stapley), in Clapham, London. Her brother went to Brighton to live with his {{paternal}} grandparents. She later wrote that at the age of 15 she ran away to join a funfair, and lived <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>cardboard</b> <b>box</b> under Waterloo station for four months, although Stapley denied this by saying that she occasionally left home at weekends to travel with a young man who worked for a funfair in London. During her stated period of homelessness, her school records indicate that she and her sister were both enrolled at Usworth comprehensive in Tyne and Wear until April 1983, and at Hydeburn Comprehensive, in Balham, on 6 June 1983, where they both stayed until 2 July 1984. She remembered that a teacher at the Hydeburn once said, [...] "there's no hope for her at all", and that she left school with no academic qualifications. In the same year, her father had another daughter, Claire Mills, with a new partner. Mills worked for a croissant shop, but was sacked, and vowed [...] "never to work for anyone else again". She later wrote in her autobiography that the owner of a jewellery shop in Clapham gave her a job on Saturdays, but Jim Guy, the owner of Penrose Jewellers, later stated: [...] "Everything she wrote about me was lies, I never gave her a job; she just hung around and made tea. She told me {{her father was}} dead. The only thing that was true was she nicked stuff from the shop", which Guy said was worth £20,000. She admitted that she had stolen some gold chains and sold them to buy a moped, and when Guy reported the theft, she was put on probation.|$|E

2500|$|Louis Waldman {{was born}} on January 5, 1891, in Yancherudnia, Ukraine, not far from Kiev, {{the son of a}} Jewish innkeeper {{who was one of the}} few literate men of the village. Waldman emigrated to America in the summer 1909 at the age of 17, {{arriving}} in New York City to join his sisters on September 17. [...] Waldman first worked in a metal shop before becoming an apprentice garment lining cutter in one of the sweatshops of the city. He joined a union and participated in the 11-week New York cloakmakers' strike of 1910, while attending high school in the evenings. Upon conclusion of the strike and resumption of his job, Waldman was fired and blacklisted for carrying out his function as a union representative in supervising the enforcement of the union contract in his shop. Barred from the garment industry, Waldman thereafter worked unsuccessfully as a door-to-door peddler of ribbon before taking a job <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>cardboard</b> <b>box</b> factory.|$|E

[...] Tim's soul is immediately forfeit to Barbatos, and he becomes his slave, spending his life living <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>cardboard</b> <b>box</b> torturing alternate versions of Molly while Barbatos uses his power for his own ends. [...] Tim, now known as Sir Timothy Hunter, is eventually killed when Barbatos forces him to travel back in time to ensure that the young Tim grows up to be the demon's slave: the older Tim is killed by an outburst of the younger Tim's anger, and the demon is defeated and trapped in the Dreaming.|$|E

2500|$|Following Suesan's death, Theresa Knorr began {{directing}} {{the majority of}} her anger and abuse towards her daughter Sheila. In May 1985, Knorr forced Sheila into prostitution to support the family. Knorr did not work and received money {{from the state of}} California. Knorr was initially pleased with this arrangement due to the large amounts of money Sheila was earning and allowed Sheila to leave the house whenever she pleased. After a few weeks, Knorr became angry and accused Sheila of being pregnant and contracting a sexually transmitted disease which Knorr claimed she caught from Sheila via a toilet seat. Sheila initially denied the accusations. So Knorr beat her, hog tied her and locked her in a hot closet with no ventilation. Knorr forbade her other children to give Sheila food or water or to {{open the door to the}} closet. Terry Knorr disobeyed her mother and gave Sheila a beer. Terry Knorr later said, [...] "She [...] wanted Sheila to confess. That was mother's way. Beat them until they confess." [...] To end the punishment, Sheila confessed to being pregnant and having an STD but Knorr would not let her out of the closet claiming that Sheila was lying. Sheila died three days later, on June 21, 1985, of dehydration and starvation. Knorr left Sheila's body in the closet for an additional three days before discovering that Sheila was dead. Once again, Knorr ordered her sons William and Robert to dispose of Sheila's body which had begun to decompose causing an odorous smell that filled the apartment. The boys placed Sheila's body <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>cardboard</b> <b>box</b> which they disposed of near the airport in Truckee, California. [...] Sheila's body was discovered a few hours after it had been disposed of but was never positively identified and was classified as Jane Doe #6607-85.|$|E

6000|$|After {{that point}} in the {{launching}} of a gold mine the rest is easy. Generous, warm-hearted men, interested in geology, were soon found. There was no stint of money. The great rock was torn sideways from its place, and from beneath it the crumbled, glittering rock-dust that sparkled in the sun was sent in little boxes to the testing laboratories of Plutoria University. There the senior professor of geology had sat up with it far into {{the night in a}} darkened laboratory, with little blue flames playing underneath crucibles, as in a magician's cavern, and with the door locked. And as each sample that he tested was set aside and tied <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>cardboard</b> <b>box</b> by itself, he labelled it [...] "aur. p. 75," [...] and the pen shook in his hand as he marked it. For to professors of geology those symbols mean [...] "this is seventy-five per cent pure gold." [...] So it was no wonder that the senior professor of geology working far into the night among the blue flames shook with excitement; not, of course, for the gold's sake as money (he had no time to think of that), but because if this thing was true it meant that an auriferous vein had been found in what was Devonian rock of the post-tertiary stratification, and if that was so it upset enough geology to spoil a textbook. It would mean that the professor could read a paper at the next Pan-Geological Conference that would turn the whole assembly into a bedlam.|$|E
