40|$|Sheehan {{syndrome}} is partial or complete <b>hypophyseal</b> <b>insufficiency</b> due to hypophyseal necrosis secondary to postpartum hemorrhage and hypovolemia. Clinical findings are cessation of lactation, secondary amenorrhea, loss of libido and hypophyseal reserve loss. Treatment is hormone replacement. Forty-four years old women admitted with somnolence, malaise, edema and blurred vision. Physical examination revealed edema and hypotension. She had massive bleeding during her birth 11 years old ago; therefore {{she had received}} blood transfusion and could not breast-feed then. She had amenorrhea when she admitted. She was diagnosed to be Sheehan syndrome while glucocorticoid and levothyroxine replacement was started. Hypophyseal and orbital magnetic resonance imaging revealed empty sella and edema in bilateral optical neural sheaths respectively. Empty sella may cause edema in optical neural sheaths by increasing pressure in subarachnoidal space. We present this case to point out this coincidence.

40|$|Background: Congenital {{hypopituitarism}} is {{an uncommon}} cause of <b>hypophyseal</b> <b>insufficiency</b> It is less common than growth hormone deficiency {{which has an}} incidence of 1 : 4. 000 to 1 : 8. 000 Uve newborns. Early diagnosis ofthis condition is important to prevent impairment of cognitive function, poor growth and alterations in metabolic profile in these patients. Aim: To report 23 patients diagnosed with congenital hypopituitarism. Material and methods: Retrospective review of clinical records of 23 patients (12 males) with congenital hypopituitarism, diagnosed during a 21 years period. In a group of 16 patients a molecular study was performed searching for mutations in HESX 1, PROP- 1 or POUF- 1. Results: Short stature was the most frequent sign at the first evaluation, followed by neonatal hypoglycemia and presence of nistagmus, strabismus, atrophic optic nerve or malformations in the middle Une showed in CNS imaging, suggesting septo-optic-dysplasia. All male patients diagnosed during neonatal period, exhibited micropenis. CNS images showed isolated hypophyseal hypoplasia or associated to an ectopic neurohypophysis in most patients. No patient in the subgroup subjected to molecular analysis had any of the mutations in the searched genes. Conclusions: The diagnosis of hypopituitarism {{must be based on}} clinical grounds, speciaUy when hypoglycemia, prolonged jaundice, micropenis or midline alterations are found in the neonatal period...|$|E
