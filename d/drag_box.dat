40|$|This paper {{presents}} the soil friction restraint on oblique pipelines in loose sand. A series of experimental tests are {{conducted in a}} prefabricated large-scale <b>drag</b> <b>box</b> with dimensions 1. 83 m x 1. 83 m x 1. 22 m. Model pipes 0. 61 m long with diameters of 152. 4, 228. 6, and 304. 8 mm are obliquely moved from an axial-longitudinal to lateral-transversal direction in the <b>drag</b> <b>box</b> to study the associated soil restraints of the oblique pipes with various shallow embedded depths. All the test results indicate that for the axial pipes, the longitudinal soil restraint could be estimated {{as the product of}} the average of the vertical and horizontal earth pressures at the centerline of the pipe and the tangent value of soil-pipe friction angle, whereas for the lateral pipes, the transversal soil restraint could be predicted by using the limit equilibrium model with the assumption of the planar sliding failure surface. The longitudinal and transversal, soil restraints of the oblique pipes could geometrically be obtained by multiplying the corresponding cosine and sine values of the oblique angle with the associated longitudinal soil restraint of axial pipe and the transversal soil restraint of the lateral pipe, respectively.

40|$|The soil {{restraints}} to oblique {{movement of}} buried pipes in dense sand were investigated. Model pipes 0. 61 m long with diameters of 152. 4, 228. 6, and 304. 8 mm were obliquely moved from an axial-longitudinal to a lateral-transversal direction {{in a large}} scale <b>drag</b> <b>box</b> to study the associated longitudinal and transverse soil restraints on the pipes in the shallow buried depth. All the experimental results indicated that the longitudinal soil restraint to the axial movement of the pipes could be estimated as the product of the average of the vertical and horizontal earth pressures at the centerline of the pipe and the tangent value of the soil-pipe friction angle. For the lateral movement pipes, three different theoretical methods were used to analyze the transverse soil restraint. Among these, the modified Meyerhof approach with the assumption of a rupture surface of logarithmic spiral arc was closer to the experimental results compared to the planar sliding surface approach. For the oblique movement pipes, the longitudinal soil restraint decreases, whereas the transverse soil restraint increases with increasing oblique angle. Moreover, the longitudinal and transverse soil restraint of the oblique angle pipes could be obtained by multiplying the corresponding cosine and sine values of the oblique angle with the associated longitudinal soil restraint of the axial pipe and the transverse soil restraint of the lateral pipe, respectively. The findings also indicate that the scale effects are minor for sizes up to 304. 8 mm of the pipe diameter tested herein...|$|E

40|$|Introduction: The game of Sokoban Sokoban is {{a popular}} puzzle game {{implemented}} on almost all computer system. It is a true part of computer gaming folklore. The aim {{of the game is}} to move a person (Jap. sokoban = pusher) around in a two-dimensional maze and to move a number of boxes into some designated storage positions. The pusher may only push one box at a time and he cannot <b>drag</b> <b>boxes.</b> If he manages to move each box to a target position (any box can move to any storage location) the game is solved. The main problem in solving a game is that wrong moves may place boxes in unrecoverable positions, eg. into a corner of the maze. The player then cannot move the box any further, because he cannot reach a position from where he can push the box. Since the player may only move one box at a time, boxes can also block each other, therefore the player has to consider the order in which he pushes the blocks. It has been shown that solving arbitrary puzzles is a PSPACE [...] complete prob...|$|R

40|$|Recent {{advances}} in touch and display technologies are supporting a wide-spread use of touch-based direct manipulation techniques {{as well as}} 3 D displays that give a perspectively correct view. Both techniques have consistency constraints including the following: With direct manipulation, a dragged object should stick to the finger tip. With viewer centered projection, head movement should update the scene’s projection to preserve a sound 3 D impression, e. g., leaning around a house should reveal its backyard. Unfortunately, these two contradict each other, making a combination, e. g., moving the head while touching or dragging an object, non-trivial.

40|$|The {{timing and}} neural {{processing}} of {{the understanding of}} social interactions was investigated by presenting scenes in which 2 people performed cooperative or affective actions. While {{the role of the}} human mirror neuron system (MNS) in understanding actions and intentions is widely accepted, {{little is known about the}} time course within which these aspects of visual information are automatically extracted. Event-Related Potentials were recorded in 35 university students perceiving 260 pictures of cooperative (e. g., 2 people <b>dragging</b> a <b>box)</b> or affective (e. g., 2 people smiling and holding hands) interactions. The action’s goal was automatically discriminated at about 150 – 170 ms, as reflected by occipito/temporal N 170 response. The swLORETA inverse solution revealed the strongest sources in the right posterior cingulate cortex (CC) for affective actions and in the right pSTS for cooperative actions. It was found a right hemispheric asymmetry that involved the fusiform gyrus (BA 37), the posterior CC, and the medial frontal gyrus (BA 10 / 11) for the processing of affective interactions, particularly in the 155 – 175 ms time window. In a later time window (200 – 250 ms) the processing of cooperative interactions activated the left post-central gyrus (BA 3), the left parahippocampal gyrus, the left superior frontal gyrus (BA 10), as well as the right premotor cortex (BA 6). Women showed a greater response discriminative of the action’s goal compared to men at P 300 and anterior negativity level (220 – 500 ms).

It begins with Dewey going through a dumpster that says [...] "TMBG Toys". He {{climbs out of the}} dumpster and rides his bike home while <b>dragging</b> the <b>box</b> full of toys. The box goes into Dewey's backyard where Malcolm is raking leaves, their father, Hal, is cooking on a barbecue, and Reese is using hedge clippers on a tree. Dewey opens the box, revealing toy versions of TMBG. But whenever there's a close-up in the box, it is the real band in miniature. A Hawaiian hula dancer toy joins TMBG as Dewey sways back and forth with her. Malcolm and Reese begin shooting the toys with paintball guns until one of them accidentally shoots Hal. Though not shown, it's presumed to have been Reese who shot him as he is later seen using a weed whacker. The John Flansburgh toy is lying in the grass with his arm detached. Reese spots him and, while using the weed whacker, launches him onto the grill where Hal accidentally eats him, much to Dewey's shock. Later, the John Linnell toy is placed in a model airplane that is launched across the street before curving back and landing on the driveway. As Hal drives up, he picks up the airplane to examine it. The plane explodes because it still had a lit fuse. Hal then angrily gathers the TMBG toys into the box and drives back to the dumpster where he promptly tosses it back in.|$|R
5000|$|The delay box {{acts as an}} {{on-board}} timer for {{the transmission}} brake (commonly {{referred to as a}} [...] "trans-brake"). A transbrake is a part of a racing automatic transmission used in drag racing, and are not found in manual transmissions. The electronic timer is packaged in a metal enclosure when sold to drag racers, thus the slang term delay box. This timer box is a very accurate type of monostable multivibrator (electrical engineers also call this type of multivibrator a [...] "one shot"). The timer box acts like a time-delay relay. Many delay boxes actually have an internal relay to switch output current, but some models have solid state transistorized output circuits. The transistorized type made today almost always use power MOSFET type output circuitry. <b>Drag</b> racing delay <b>boxes</b> are designed to operate from the vehicles 12 volt DC electrical system.

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to {{describe}} additional patients (n = 3) exhibiting the Unertan syndrome (UTS), resident in rural areas of Canakkale. The 8 th and 9 th families with the UTS, with a total of 16 members affected, have not been previously characterized. A single, non-familial case (Bayramic, Canakkale) occurred during early childhood after an infection with a high fever. Three cases of familial UTS were located in another village in Canakkale. All cases exhibited the three key symptoms of the UTS: 1) walking on all four extremities, 2) primitive language (only sounds), and 3) rudimentary intelligence. Magnetic resonance imaging showed mild vermial hypoplasia in the non-familial case, while there was cerebellar and vermial hypoplasia with a flattened cerebral cortex in the familial cases. Dexterity of the fingers was normal. The man from the latter family was fond of <b>dragging</b> a wooden <b>box</b> after fastening a string around his belt. The collective observations and clinical findings suggest two etiologies for the UTS: 1) genetic, via autosomal recessive transmission and 2) viral, likely the poliovirus affecting the cerebro-cerebellar structures. At a minimum, vermial hypoplasia is suggested to cause fully developed UTS. The subjects could stand upright and even walk bipedally, despite difficulties in balance (ataxia), but they preferred quadrupedal walking. The main difficulty with gait was maintaining a dynamic-asymmetric lateral balance and initiation of the first step during standing. Apparently, a quadrupedal gait in an adult is a developmental regression with absence of the higher control mechanisms for asymmetric lateral balance during bipedal walking. It is suggested that these individuals exhibit ancestral traits; the quadrupedal gait with rudimentary intelligence and primitive speech resulting from viral infections and/or genetic damage may cause devolution (reverse evolution), a manifestation of an experiment of nature as well as experimental studies in animal models. The results support the notion of punctuated evolution, in contrast to Darwin`s theory of graded evolution. <b>Dragging</b> a wooden <b>box</b> using a string wrapped around the belt may also be an example of reverse evolution with regard to tool making, illuminating the very long-lasting period before the invention of the wheel. Herein, there has been no intent to insult or injure these individuals affected by the UTS, rather this is an endeavor to better understand the mystery of human evolution...|$|R

At all events, that was what happened in Dandy's town of Penzance.

My own theory was that as the box was there to hold biscuits and now held none, he had come to regard it as useless--as having lost its function, so to speak--also that its presence there was an insult to his intelligence, a constant temptation to make a fool of himself by visiting it half a dozen times a day only to find it empty as usual.
