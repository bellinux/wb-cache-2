Gordon, who {{was known as a}} fiery and tempestuous genius, would repeat his Talmudic thoughts to Simcha Zissel and seek his opinion on them, for he valued Simcha Zissel’s scholarship highly. Gordon said that his friend had been fluent in three orders of the Talmud, to such a level where he <b>knew</b> <b>every</b> comment of Rashi and Tosafot word for word. He was also fluent in all four divisions of the Shulchan Aruch and could locate any given Halacha within it with pinpoint precision.|$|E
25|$|The four {{survivors}} were bitterly grieved by the loss, {{for they}} had grown into a band of brothers, and they swore to keep a sharp eye out for the Albatroses of Richthofen's squadron which had brought down Nash. At {{the same time they}} thought that Nash was dead. On the morning of June 27th they met the Richthofen Staffel near Courtrai, and this time Collishaw found himself engaged with the bright-green Albatros of Allmenröder – though he was not aware at the moment that he was fighting the conqueror of Nash. It was one of the classic dogfights of the war, like Barker against Linke, like Hawker against Richthofen – two skilled and experienced fighters, who <b>knew</b> <b>every</b> trick, had met.|$|E

500|$|Britten's early musical {{life was}} {{dominated}} by the classical masters; his mother's ambition was for him to become the [...] "Fourth B" [...] – after Bach, Beethoven and Brahms. Britten was later to assert that his initial development as a composer was stifled by reverence for these masters: [...] "Between the ages of thirteen and sixteen I <b>knew</b> <b>every</b> note of Beethoven and Brahms. I remember receiving the full score of Fidelio for my fourteenth birthday... But I think in a sense I never forgave them for having led me astray in my own particular thinking and natural inclinations". He developed a particular animosity towards Brahms, whose piano music he had once held in great esteem; in 1952 he confided that he played through all Brahms's music from time to time, [...] "to see if I am right about him; I usually find that I underestimated last time how bad it was!" ...|$|E
500|$|In The New York Times James Woods {{described}} True at First Light as {{a travel}} journal {{that became a}} [...] "fanciful memoir" [...] and then a novel of sorts. Patrick Hemingway believed adamantly the manuscript {{was more than a}} journal. He emphasized the storyline because, as he explains, [...] "the essential quality of the book is an action with a love interest". He tightened the hunting scenes, and to honor his father's statement to the reader that [...] "where I go, you go" [...] he emphasized the mid-20th century Africa scenes and [...] "the real relation between people... on that continent". [...] Although he fictionalized the storyline, Patrick Hemingway said of the characters, [...] "I <b>knew</b> <b>every</b> single one... very well indeed". [...] Hemingway scholar Robert Fleming (who reworked the manuscript [...] as Under Kilimanjaro) considers Patrick Hemingway's editing essentially to be correct because he believes the work shows evidence of an author unable to [...] "turn off the mechanism that produces fiction". The marital conflict is where Fleming believes [...] the book took [...] "a metafictional turn". The published book is marketed as fiction.|$|E

[...] She described Disney movies as [...] "the ones [...] watched over and over again when [...] was a kid," [...] and continued, [...] "I <b>knew</b> <b>every</b> line from The Little Mermaid. I love Aladdin. When asked about her favorite Disney character, Bell said, [...] "Ariel from The Little Mermaid. Because I think it was a shift that Disney had, where a female lead—the [...] "princess," [...] I guess—didn't just want to find her mate. She was singing [...] "I want to be where the people are. I want to see the world. I want to venture outside my comfort zone."" [...] Bell described her initial reaction when she first found that she was cast as [...] "I was in glee". Lee admitted Bell's casting selection was influenced after the filmmakers listened a couple of vocal tracks from The Little Mermaid, including [...] "Part of Your World" [...] that the actress recorded when she was young, stating that without these recordings, it would've been very difficult to the find the right one to play Anna.|$|E

He is a peace-loving leader, preferring nonviolent discussions to his advisers' more militaristic suggestions. Throughout the series, he acts {{as a source of}} wisdom to younger generations; and from the start, {{is one of the few}} {{characters}} to treat Naruto Uzumaki as a person rather than the host of Kurama. He was admired as the God of Shinobi in his prime, and also known as , as he purportedly <b>knew</b> <b>every</b> jutsu in Konohagakure. He is able to use the Summoning Jutsu, which allows him to summon the , who takes the form of a long rod when not summoned. He is also the teacher of Jiraiya, Orochimaru, and Tsunade. Orochimaru is his favorite student, and Sarutobi could never bring himself to recognize Orochimaru's evil qualities. When Orochimaru invades Konoha years later, Sarutobi fights him to repent for never prosecuting Orochimaru as he should have. While he is unable to seal Orochimaru with the forbidden Death Seal, Hiruzen still manages to rob Orochimaru of his ability to use Jutsu by sealing his arms, thus bringing an end to the invasion and allowing him to die happily. During the Fourth Great Ninja War, Orochimaru releases Hiruzen's soul from the Death Seal and reanimates him so Sasuke can confirm the events behind the Uchiha Clan Massacre. He later participates in the battle against Obito and Madara alongside the other resurrected Hokage, before being put to rest following Kaguya's defeat. In the Japanese anime, he is voiced by Hidekatsu Shibata, and his English voice actor is Steve Kramer.|$|E
500|$|Revie {{was made}} player-manager at Leeds United in March 1961 {{following}} {{the resignation of}} Jack Taylor, who left after Leeds found themselves struggling in the Second Division. He had initially applied for the vacant job at Bournemouth, but Bournemouth were unable to find the £6,000 Leeds demanded, and the Leeds directors decided to instead appoint Revie as manager. At the time the club was in debt and was located in a rugby league territory, with very little football tradition. Less than 7,000 turned out for the final home game of the 1960–61 season whilst Leeds's championship game of the 1960–61 Rugby League season had an attendance of over 50,000. He immediately began to institute radical changes such as ensuring the players stayed at higher quality hotels. He instilled a [...] "family atmosphere" [...] at Elland Road, making sure to {{take an interest in}} the lives of everyone at the club from the cleaning staff to the star players and ensuring there were no [...] "big egos" [...] at the club. He showed trust in his players, leaving them mainly to their own devices though he always made sure he was fully informed as to what they were up to off the pitch, even {{going so far as to}} tell them to dump their girlfriends if he viewed them as unsuitable. He also introduced lengthy dossiers on opposing teams to ensure his players <b>knew</b> <b>every</b> detail about the opposition and were able to exploit weaknesses and nullify threats. Other changes were based on some of his many superstitions, such as his belief that birds were bad luck which resulted in him getting rid of the owl on the club badge and the discontinuation of the Peacocks nickname in favour of the Whites.|$|E

Madonna has also cited Mitchell as the first female artist that really spoke {{to her as a}} teenager; [...] "I was really, really into Joni Mitchell.
