5|$|Through {{studies of}} carbon isotope ratios (similar to the {{methodology}} used in carbon dating, except with the stable isotopes C-12 and C-13), {{it has been}} shown that the carbon found in diamonds comes from both inorganic and organic sources. Some diamonds, known as harzburgitic, are formed from <b>inorganic</b> <b>carbon</b> originally found deep in the Earth's mantle. In contrast, eclogitic diamonds contain organic carbon from organic detritus that has been pushed down from the surface of the Earth's crust through subduction (see plate tectonics) before transforming into diamond. These two different source of carbon have measurably different 13C:12C ratios. Diamonds that have come to the Earth's surface are generally quite old, ranging from under 1billion to 3.3billion years old. This is 22% to 73% of the age of the Earth.|$|E

25|$|In {{contrast}} to the open equilibrium scenario above, many swimming pools are managed by addition of sodium bicarbonate (NaHCO3) to about 2 mM as a buffer, then control of pH through use of HCl, NaHSO4, Na2CO3, NaOH or chlorine formulations that are acidic or basic. In this situation, dissolved <b>inorganic</b> <b>carbon</b> (DIC) is far from equilibrium with atmospheric CO2. Progress towards equilibrium through outgassing of CO2 is slowed by (i) the slow reaction H2CO3 ⇌ CO2(aq) + H2O; (ii) limited aeration in a deep water column and (iii) periodic replenishment of bicarbonate to maintain buffer capacity (often estimated through measurement of ‘total alkalinity’).|$|E

Phosphoenolpyruvate carboxylase, unlike RuBisCO, only temporarily fixes carbon. Reflecting its importance, RuBisCO {{is the most}} abundant protein in leaves, accounting for 50% of soluble leaf protein in [...] plants (20–30% of total leaf nitrogen) and 30% of soluble leaf protein in [...] plants (5–9% of total leaf nitrogen).

Climate change may also affect the biological pump in the future by warming and stratifying the surface ocean, thus reducing the supply of limiting nutrients to surface waters.

The present review is focused on the state-of-the-art of carbon-based (carbonaceous) adsorbents, covering microporous <b>inorganic</b> <b>carbons</b> and microporous organic polymers, with emphasis on the correlation between their textural and compositional properties and their CO 2 adsorption/separation performance.

Our discussion focuses on CO 2 /N 2 separation and CO 2 /CH 4 separation, while including an introduction to the methods and criteria used for evaluating the performance of the adsorbents. Critical issues and challenges regarding the development of high-performance adsorbents as well as some overlooked facts and misconceptions are also discussed, with the aim of providing important insights into the design of novel carbonaceous porous materials for various selective adsorption based applications.

40|$|For Crenarchaea, two new {{autotrophic}} {{carbon fixation}} cycles were recently described. Sulfolobales use the 3 -hydroxypropionate/ 4 -hydroxybutyrate cycle, with acetyl-coenzyme A (CoA) /propionyl-CoA carboxylase as the carboxylating enzyme. Ignicoccus hospitalis (Desulfurococcales) uses the dicarboxylate/ 4 -hydroxybutyrate cycle, with pyruvate synthase and phosphoenolpyruvate carboxylase {{being responsible for}} CO 2 fixation. In the two cycles, acetyl-CoA and two <b>inorganic</b> <b>carbons</b> are transformed to succinyl-CoA by different routes, whereas the regeneration of acetyl-CoA from succinyl-CoA proceeds via the same route. Thermoproteales would be an exception to this unifying concept, since for Thermoproteus neutrophilus, the reductive citric acid cycle was proposed as a carbon fixation mechanism. Here, evidence is presented for {{the operation of the}} dicarboxylate/ 4 -hydroxybutyrate cycle in this archaeon. All required enzyme activities were detected in large amounts. The key enzymes of the cycle were strongly upregulated under autotrophic growth conditions, indicating their involvement in autotrophic CO 2 fixation. The corresponding genes were identified in the genome. 14 C-labeled 4 -hydroxybutyrate was incorporated into the central building blocks in accordance with the key position of this compound in the cycle. Moreover, the results of previous 13 C-labeling studies, which could be reconciled with a reductive citric acid cycle only when some assumptions were made, were perfectly in line with the new proposal. We conclude that the dicarboxylate/ 4 -hydroxybutyrate cycle is operating in CO 2 fixation in the strict anaerobic Thermoproteales as well as in Desulfurococcales...|$|R
