5|$|Marsh rice rats from Paynes Prairie, Alachua County; Cedar Key, Levy County; and Lake Istokpoga, Highlands County, all in Florida, {{have yielded}} A.forresteri. In Paynes Prairie, the type locality, 82 of 178 animals {{examined}} were infected with 1 to 50 (average 10) worms, but in Cedar Key {{only a single}} rat contained one worm. The worms {{were found in the}} front part, or <b>fundus,</b> of the stomach, with their front ends in the fundal tissue and their back ends projecting into the inside.|$|E
5|$|Physical {{examination}} {{of the nervous system}} is typically normal apart from the presence of papilledema, which is seen on {{examination of}} the eye with a small device called an ophthalmoscope or in more detail with a <b>fundus</b> camera. If there are cranial nerve abnormalities, these may be noticed on eye examination {{in the form of a}} squint (third, fourth, or sixth nerve palsy) or as facial nerve palsy. If the papilledema has been longstanding, visual fields may be constricted and visual acuity may be decreased. Visual field testing by automated (Humphrey) perimetry is recommended as other methods of testing may be less accurate. Longstanding papilledema leads to optic atrophy, in which the disc looks pale and visual loss tends to be advanced.|$|E
25|$|Retinal {{detachment}} can {{be examined}} by <b>fundus</b> photography or ophthalmoscopy. <b>Fundus</b> photography generally needs a considerably larger instrument than the ophthalmoscope, {{but has the}} advantage of availing the image to be examined by a specialist at another location and/or time, as well as providing photo documentation for future reference. Modern <b>fundus</b> photographs generally recreate considerably larger areas of the <b>fundus</b> than what can be seen at any one time with handheld ophthalmoscopes.|$|E
25|$|<b>Fundus</b> — {{relating}} to pregnancy, it {{is a reminder}} for crews to check if a female is pregnant, and if she is, how far progressed she is (the position of the <b>fundus</b> {{in relation to the}} bellybutton gives a ready reckoning guide).|$|E
25|$|Ophthalmoscopy or <b>fundus</b> photography: Ophthalmoscopy is an {{examination}} of the retina in which the eye care professional: (1) looks through a slit lamp biomicroscope with a special magnifying lens that provides a narrow view of the retina, or (2) wearing a headset (indirect ophthalmoscope) with a bright light, looks through a special magnifying glass and gains a wide view of the retina. Hand-held ophthalmoscopy is insufficient to rule out significant and treatable diabetic retinopathy. <b>Fundus</b> photography generally captures considerably larger areas of the <b>fundus,</b> and has the advantage of photo documentation for future reference, as well as availing the image to be examined by a specialist at another location and/or time.|$|E
25|$|Supracervical (subtotal) laparoscopic {{hysterectomy}} (LSH) {{is performed}} {{similar to the}} total laparoscopic surgery but the uterus is amputated between the cervix and <b>fundus.</b>|$|E
25|$|Visual {{field and}} acuity tests measure {{and compare the}} size of the patient's field of vision and the clarity of their visual {{perception}} with the standard visual measurements associated with healthy 20/20 vision. Clinical diagnostic features indicative of Retinitis Pigmentosa include a substantially small and progressively decreasing visual area in the visual field test, and compromised levels of clarity measured during the visual acuity test. Additionally, optical tomography such as <b>fundus</b> and retinal (optical coherence) imagery provide further diagnostic tools when determining an RP diagnosis. Photographing the back of the dilated eye allows the confirmation of bone spicule accumulation in the <b>fundus,</b> which presents during the later stages of RP retinal degeneration. Combined with cross-sectional imagery of optical coherence tomography, which provides clues into photoreceptor thickness, retinal layer morphology, and retinal pigment epithelium physiology, <b>fundus</b> imagery can help determine the state of RP progression.|$|E
25|$|An {{anatomical}} variation can occur, {{known as}} a Phrygian cap, which is an innocuous fold in the <b>fundus,</b> named after its resemblance to the Phrygian cap.|$|E
25|$|The convalescent {{phase is}} {{characterized}} by gradual tissue depigmentation of skin with vitiligo and poliosis, sometimes with nummular depigmented scars, as well as alopecia and diffuse <b>fundus</b> depigmentation resulting in a classic orange-red discoloration ("sunset glow fundus") and retinal pigment epithelium clumping and/or migration.|$|E
25|$|The {{outer layer}} of the <b>fundus</b> of gallbladder, and the {{surfaces}} not {{in contact with the}} liver, are covered by a thick serosa, which is exposed to the peritoneum. The serosa contains blood vessels and lymphatics. The surfaces in contact with the liver are covered in connective tissue.|$|E
25|$|Aside from a {{complete}} inability to see color, individuals with complete achromatopsia {{have a number}} of other ophthalmologic aberrations. Included among these aberrations are greatly decreased visual acuity (<0.1 or 20/200) in daylight, Hemeralopia, nystagmus, and severe photophobia. The <b>fundus</b> of the eye appears completely normal. Also see Pingelap#Color-blindness.|$|E
25|$|Diabetic {{retinopathy}} {{is diagnosed}} entirely by recognizing abnormalities on retinal images taken by fundoscopy. Color <b>fundus</b> photography is mainly used for staging the disease. Fluorescein angiography {{is used to}} assess the extent of retinopathy that aids in treatment plan development. Optical coherence tomography (OCT) is used to determine the severity of edema and treatment response.|$|E
25|$|The inner oblique layer: This {{layer is}} {{responsible}} for creating the motion that churns and physically breaks down the food. It is the only layer of the three which is not seen {{in other parts of}} the digestive system. The antrum has thicker skin cells in its walls and performs more forceful contractions than the <b>fundus.</b>|$|E
25|$|In {{the human}} {{digestive}} system, a bolus (a small rounded mass of chewed up food) enters the stomach through the oesophagus via the lower oesophageal sphincter. The stomach releases proteases (protein-digesting enzymes such as pepsin) and hydrochloric acid, which kills or inhibits bacteria {{and provides the}} acidic pH of 2 for the proteases to work. Food is churned by the stomach through muscular contractions of the wall called peristalsis – reducing {{the volume of the}} <b>fundus,</b> before looping around the <b>fundus</b> and the body of stomach as the boluses are converted into chyme (partially digested food). Chyme slowly passes through the pyloric sphincter and into the duodenum of the small intestine, where the extraction of nutrients begins. Depending on the quantity and contents of the meal, the stomach will digest the food into chyme within anywhere between forty minutes and a few hours. The average human stomach can comfortably hold about a litre of food.|$|E
25|$|One {{surgical}} procedure used is called Nissen fundoplication. In fundoplication, the gastric <b>fundus</b> (upper part) {{of the stomach}} is wrapped, or plicated, around the inferior part of the esophagus, preventing herniation of the stomach through the hiatus in the diaphragm and the reflux of gastric acid. The procedure is now commonly performed laparoscopically. With proper patient selection, laparoscopic fundoplication recent studies have indicated relatively low complication rates, quick recovery, and relatively good long term results.|$|E
25|$|Hysterectomies are {{sometimes}} performed with abdominoplasty. A hysterectomy consists in removing the uterus {{and it may}} be complete (when the body, <b>fundus</b> and cervix are removed) or partial (when only the uterine body is surgically removed). This procedure is normally performed by gynecologists and {{it is one of the}} most common gynecological surgeries. This type of surgery is used to treat some benign tumors, cancers of the ovaries, uterus or cervix, endometriosis and are also performed in transmen.|$|E
25|$|In {{the first}} stage which is called non-proliferative {{diabetic}} retinopathy (NPDR) there are no symptoms, the signs are not visible to the eye and patients will have 20/20 vision. The only way to detect NPDR is by <b>fundus</b> photography, in which microaneurysms (microscopic blood-filled bulges in the artery walls) can be seen. If there is reduced vision, fluorescein angiography {{can be done to}} see the back of the eye. Narrowing or blocked retinal blood vessels can be seen clearly and this is called retinal ischemia (lack of blood flow).|$|E
25|$|A {{cholecystectomy}} is {{a procedure}} {{in which the}} gallbladder is removed. It may be removed because of recurrent gallstones, and is considered an elective procedure. A cholecystectomy may be an open procedure, or one conducted by laparoscopy. In the surgery, the gallbladder {{is removed from the}} neck to the <b>fundus,</b> and so bile will drain directly from the liver into the biliary tree. About 30 percent of patients may experience some degree of indigestion following the procedure, although severe complications are much rarer. About 10 percent of surgeries lead to a chronic condition of postcholecystectomy syndrome.|$|E
25|$|A {{small amount}} of anechogenic free fluid in the rectouterine pouch is {{commonly}} found in both intrauterine and ectopic pregnancies. The presence of echogenic fluid is estimated at between 28 and 56% of women with an ectopic pregnancy, and strongly indicates the presence of hemoperitoneum. However, {{it does not necessarily}} result from tubal rupture, but is commonly a result from leakage from the distal tubal opening. As a rule of thumb, the finding of free fluid is significant if it reaches the <b>fundus</b> or is present in the vesico-uterine pouch. A further marker of serious intra-abdominal bleeding is the presence of fluid in the hepatorenal recess of the subhepatic space.|$|E
25|$|A {{variety of}} {{indirect}} symptoms characterize Retinitis Pigmentosa {{along with the}} direct effects of the initial rod photoreceptor degeneration and later cone photoreceptor decline. Phenomena such as photophobia, which describes the event in which light is perceived as an intense glare, and photopsia, the presence of blinking or shimmering lights within the visual field, often manifest during the later stages of RP. Findings related to RP have often been characterized in the <b>fundus</b> of the eye as the Ophthalamic triad. This includes the development of (1) a mottled appearance of the retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) caused by bone spicule formation, (2) a waxy appearance of the optic nerve, and (3) the attentuation of {{blood vessels in the}} retina.|$|E
25|$|Van Norren et al. (1998) {{could not}} find a single example in the medical {{literature}} of a <1nbsp&mW classnbsp&III laser causing eyesight damage. Mainster et al. (2003) provide one case, an 11-year-old child who temporarily damaged her eyesight by holding an approximately 5mW red laser pointer close to the eye and staring into the beam for 10 seconds, she experienced scotoma (a blind spot) but fully recovered after three months. Luttrull & Hallisey (1999) describe a similar case, a 34-year-old male who stared into the beam of a classIIIa 5mW red laser for 30 to 60 seconds, causing temporary central scotoma and visual field loss. His eyesight fully recovered within two days, {{at the time of his}} eye exam. An intravenous <b>fundus</b> fluorescein angiogram, a technique used by ophthalmologists to visualise the retina of the eye in fine detail, identified subtle discoloration of the fovea.|$|E
25|$|A {{number of}} {{examinations}} {{can be used}} {{to determine the extent of}} the syndrome and its severity. Fluorescein angiography is quite useful in diagnosing the disease, and the use of ultrasonography and optical coherence tomography (OCT) are helpful in confirming the disease. Neuro-ophthalmic examinations reveal pupillary defects (see Marcus Gunn Pupil). Funduscopic examinations, examinations of the <b>fundus</b> of the eye, allow detection of arteriovenous malformations. Neurological examinations can determine hemiparesis and paresthesias. Malformations in arteriovenous connections and irregular functions in the veins may be distinguished by fluorescein angiographies. Cerebral angiography examinations may expose AVMs in the cerebrum. MRIs are also used in imaging the brain and can allow visualization of the optic nerve and any possible atrophy. MRI, CT, and cerebral angiography are all useful for investigating the extent and location of any vascular lesions that are affecting the brain. This is helpful in determining the extent of the syndrome.|$|E
25|$|Starting from white-light {{interferometry}} for in vivo ocular eye measurements imaging {{of biological}} tissue, {{especially of the}} human eye, was investigated by multiple groups worldwide. A first two-dimensional in vivo depiction of a human eye <b>fundus</b> along a horizontal meridian based on white light interferometric depth scans {{was presented at the}} ICO-15 SAT conference in 1990. Further developed in 1990 by Naohiro Tanno, then a professor at Yamagata University, and in particular since 1991 by Huang et al., in Prof. James Fujimoto laboratory at Massachusetts Institute of Technology, optical coherence tomography (OCT) with micrometer resolution and cross-sectional imaging capabilities has become a prominent biomedical tissue-imaging technique; it is particularly suited to ophthalmic applications and other tissue imaging requiring micrometer resolution and millimeter penetration depth. First in vivo OCT images – displaying retinal structures – were published in 1993 and first endoscopic images in 1997.|$|E
25|$|The patient lies on his/her {{left side}} with the head resting comfortably on a pillow. A mouth-guard is placed between the teeth to prevent the patient from biting on the {{endoscope}}. The endoscope is then passed over the tongue and into the oropharynx. This is the most uncomfortable stage for the patient. Quick and gentle manipulation under vision guides the endoscope into the esophagus. The endoscope is gradually advanced down the esophagus making note of any pathology. Excessive insufflation of the stomach is avoided at this stage. The endoscope is quickly passed through the stomach and through the pylorus to examine {{the first and second}} parts of the duodenum. Once this has been completed, the endoscope is withdrawn into the stomach and a more thorough examination is performed including a J-maneuver. This involves retroflexing the tip of the scope so it resembles a 'J' shape in order to examine the <b>fundus</b> and gastroesophageal junction. Any additional procedures are performed at this stage. The air in the stomach is aspirated before removing the endoscope. Still photographs can be made during the procedure and later shown to the patient to help explain any findings.|$|E
25|$|He had luck in {{the latter}} statement. In most {{amphibian}} organs including the heart, the concentration of adrenaline far exceeds that of noradrenaline, and adrenaline is indeed the main transmitter. In mammals, however, difficulties arose. In a comprehensive structure-activity study of adrenaline-like compounds, Dale and the chemist George Barger in 1910 pointed out that Elliott’s hypothesis assumed a stricter parallelism between the effects of sympathetic nerve impulses and adrenaline than actually existed. For example, sympathetic impulses shared with adrenaline contractile effects in the trigone but not relaxant effects in the <b>fundus</b> of the cat′s urinary bladder. In this respect, ″amino-ethanol-catechol″ – noradrenaline – mimicked sympathetic nerves more closely than adrenaline did. The Harvard Medical School physiologist Walter Bradford Cannon, who had popularized {{the idea of a}} sympatho-adrenal system preparing the body for fight and flight, and his colleague Arturo Rosenblueth developed an elaborate but ″queer″ theory of two sympathins, sympathin E (excitatory) and sympathin I (inhibitory). The Belgian pharmacologist Zénon Bacq as well as Canadian and US-American pharmacologists between 1934 and 1938 suggested that noradrenaline might be the – or at least one – postganglionic sympathetic transmitter. However, nothing definite was brought to light till after the war. In the meantime, Dale created a terminology that since has imprinted the thinking of neuroscientists: that nerve cells should be named after their transmitter, i.e. cholinergic if the transmitter was ″a substance like acetylcholine", and adrenergic if it was ″some substance like adrenaline″.|$|E
500|$|In people {{producing}} {{large amounts}} of acid, H. pylori colonizes near the pyloric antrum (exit to the duodenum) to avoid the acid-secreting parietal cells at the <b>fundus</b> (near {{the entrance to the}} stomach). [...] In people producing normal or reduced amounts of acid, H. pylori can also colonize the rest of the stomach.|$|E
500|$|The {{inflammatory}} response caused by bacteria colonizing near the pyloric antrum induces G {{cells in the}} antrum to secrete the hormone gastrin, which travels through the bloodstream to parietal cells in the <b>fundus.</b> Gastrin stimulates the parietal cells to secrete more acid into the stomach lumen, and over time increases the number of parietal cells, as well. [...] The increased acid load damages the duodenum, which may eventually result in ulcers forming in the duodenum.|$|E
500|$|Unlike most diurnal primates, {{but like}} all strepsirhine primates, the ring-tailed lemur has a tapetum lucidum, or {{reflective}} layer behind the retina of the eye, that enhances night vision. [...] The tapetum is highly visible in this species because the pigmentation of the ocular <b>fundus</b> (back surface of the eye), which is present in—but varies between—all lemurs, is very spotty. [...] The ring-tailed lemur also has a rudimentary foveal depression on the retina. [...] Another shared characteristic with the other strepsirrhine primates is the rhinarium, a moist, naked, glandular nose supported by the upper jaw and protruding beyond the chin. [...] The rhinarium continues down where it divides the upper lip. [...] The upper lip {{is attached to the}} premaxilla, preventing the lip from protruding and thus requiring the lemur to lap water rather than using suction.|$|E

2500|$|The {{gallbladder}} {{is shaped}} like a pear, with its tip opening into the cystic duct. The gallbladder {{is divided into three}} sections: the <b>fundus,</b> body, and neck. The <b>fundus</b> is the rounded base, angled so that it faces the abdominal wall. The body lies in a depression in the surface of the lower liver. The neck tapers and is continuous with the cystic duct, part of the biliary tree. The gallbladder fossa, against which the <b>fundus</b> and body of the gallbladder lie, is found beneath the junction of hepatic segments IVB and V. The cystic duct unites with the common hepatic duct to become the common bile duct.
