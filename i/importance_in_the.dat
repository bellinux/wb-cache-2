5|$|Mecoptera {{have special}} <b>importance</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> {{evolution}} of the insects. Two {{of the most important}} insect orders, Lepidoptera (butterflies and moths) and Diptera (true flies), along with Trichoptera (caddisflies), probably evolved from ancestors belonging to, or strictly related to, the Mecoptera. Evidence includes anatomical and biochemical similarities as well as transitional fossils, such as Permotanyderus and Choristotanyderus, which lie between the Mecoptera and Diptera. The group was once much more widespread and diverse than it is now, with four suborders during the Mesozoic.|$|E
5|$|NAD is also {{consumed}} by sirtuins, which are NAD-dependent deacetylases, such as Sir2. These enzymes act by transferring an acetyl group from their substrate protein to the ADP-ribose moiety of NAD; this cleaves the coenzyme and releases nicotinamide and O-acetyl-ADP-ribose. The sirtuins mainly {{seem to be}} involved in regulating transcription through deacetylating histones and altering nucleosome structure. However, non-histone proteins can be deacetylated by sirtuins as well. These activities of sirtuins are particularly interesting because of their <b>importance</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> regulation of aging.|$|E

5|$|A {{traditional}} {{thesis is}} that cavalry assumed {{a much greater}} <b>importance</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> 4th-century army than it enjoyed in the 2nd century.

It also enjoyed much higher status than in the 2nd century. At the same time, the infantry declined in efficiency and value in operations, leaving the cavalry as the effective arm.

Instead, he was motivated by the idea of showing the connection between a creative character's personality and the times through which he lives. He wanted to show an artist's maturing and the development of his talent. He chose Andrei Rublev for his <b>importance</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> history of Russian culture.|$|E
