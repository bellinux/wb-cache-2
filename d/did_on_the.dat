5|$|While {{relying on}} a script each week, the {{producers}} decided at the outset to allow the cast leeway in what they said and <b>did</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> show. Their decisions could affect the delivery of their lines and the blocking of each scene. If the actors felt that something was untrue to their character or a mode of delivery didn't work, they were free to change it, provided they still hit the vital plot points.|$|E
5|$|Asked {{what impact}} {{the money would}} have on him, Kinsler said: I'm {{going to play the}} same {{regardless}} of whether I'm making five dollars or $1 trillion. It really doesn't make a difference to me. I'm {{going to go out there}} and play hard, and money doesn't bring respect. The way you play the game brings respect. When I finish playing the game, it's not how much money I made that is going to be my legacy. It's how I played the game, and what I <b>did</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> field.|$|E
5|$|Bethe left Germany in 1933, {{moving to}} England after {{receiving}} an offer {{for a position}} as lecturer at the University of Manchester for a year through Sommerfeld's connection to William Lawrence Bragg. He moved in with his friend Rudolf Peierls and Peierls' wife Genia. Peierls was a fellow German physicist who had also been barred from academic positions in Germany because his parents were Jewish. This meant that Bethe had someone to speak to in German, {{and did not have}} to eat English food. Their relationship was professional as well as personal. Peierls aroused Bethe's interest in nuclear physics. After James Chadwick and Maurice Goldhaber discovered the photodisintegration of deuterium, Chadwick challenged Bethe and Peierls {{to come up with a}} theoretical explanation of this phenomenon. This they <b>did</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> four-hour train ride from Cambridge back to Manchester. Bethe would investigate further in the years ahead.|$|E

5|$|Once {{he moved}} to Nutting, Bushnell took over the {{majority}} of the engineering work for the game; Dabney has stated that he advised Bushnell on some of the design, and that some of the construction was done by Steve Bristow, an intern at Ampex. There is disagreement in interviews with Bushnell and Dabney as to how much work Dabney <b>did</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> final cabinet, with Dabney claiming credit for the controls, sound, power supply, initial wooden cabinet, and invention of the hyperspace color inversion, while Bushnell claims credit for everything but the sound, cabinet, power supply, and monitor. By August 1971, an initial prototype of the game—now named Computer Space to be similar to Computer Quiz—was complete, and Syzygy moved on to location testing. They installed the game at the Dutch Goose bar near Stanford University, where it met with great success. Nutting was heartened by the response and rushed to make several finished cabinets for the Music Operators of America (MOA) Music & Amusement Machines Exposition in October. Further location tests found a less enthusiastic response from customers confused by the game mechanics and controls, and Syzygy hurriedly tried to adjust the game to be more understandable to players.|$|E
5|$|President Arthur {{departed}} Haifa on April 4 for a ten-day excursion in the Mediterranean, calling at Jaffa, Beirut, Alexandria, and Naples, among others, before sailing for the United States from Haifa on April 17. While docked at Naples on April 23, crewmen from President Arthur {{got into}} a confrontation {{with members of the}} Blackshirts, the Italian fascist paramilitary group. Five of the Blackshirts had broken noses and black eyes; five American seamen were arrested and a further 15 Americans swam out to their steamer to avoid arrest. After calling at Halifax, the liner docked at Pier 86 in New York on March 8, carrying among its cargo 75,000bags of onions from Alexandria, 16,000cases of lemons from Palermo, and two cases of Jaffa oranges for Nathan Straus. Only 500well-wishers greeted the ship, arriving as it <b>did</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> Jewish sabbath, but President Arthur was greeted by the largest police detail in many years because of rumors of a mutiny on board the ship. Sources are unclear as to what actually happened aboard the ship, but it is known that virtually the entire crew, including the captain, was replaced before the next voyage.|$|E
