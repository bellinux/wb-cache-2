25|$|The startup {{process for}} Windows Vista has changed {{completely}} {{in comparison to}} earlier versions of Windows. The NTLDR boot loader {{has been replaced by}} a more flexible system, with NTLDR's functionality split between two new components: winload.exe and Windows Boot Manager. A notable change is that the Windows Boot Manager is invoked by pressing the space bar instead of the F8 <b>function</b> <b>key.</b> The F8 key still remains assigned for advanced boot options once the Windows Boot Manager menu appears.|$|E
25|$|Commands in the Control Language (CL) are promptable {{using the}} {{keyboard}} F4 <b>function</b> <b>key,</b> and most provide cursor-sensitive {{help to make}} specifying command parameters simpler. All command names and parameter keywords are based upon uniform standardized and mostly 3-letter abbreviations for verbs and subjects, making for easy rendering and interpretation by the application developer, as opposed to other operating systems with often cryptic or inconsistent command names for related functions or command parameter switches. For instance, the parameter keyword to apply a text description to any object to be created or changed is spelled the same way for all such commands.|$|E
25|$|Handheld {{ergonomic}} keyboards {{are designed}} to be held like a game controller, and can be used as such, instead of laid out flat on top of a table surface. Typically handheld keyboards hold all the alphanumeric keys and symbols that a standard keyboard would have, yet only be accessed by pressing two sets of keys at once; one acting as a <b>function</b> <b>key</b> similar to a 'Shift' key that would allow for capital letters on a standard keyboard. Handheld keyboards allow the user the ability to move around a room or to lean back on a chair while also being able to type in front or away from the computer. Some variations of handheld ergonomic keyboards also include a trackball mouse that allow mouse movement and typing included in one handheld device.|$|E
5000|$|Screen-labeled <b>function</b> <b>keys</b> are {{a special}} case of soft <b>key</b> (<b>function</b> <b>keys)</b> where keys are placed near a screen, which {{provides}} labels for them. These are today most commonly found in kiosk applications, such as automated teller machines and gas pumps. Screen-label <b>function</b> <b>keys</b> generally date to the late 1960s, and kiosk applications were particularly common in the 1990s and 2000s. Most recently, these keys have found use in point of sale systems; NCR Corporation claims that their DynaKey system [...] "has been proven to reduce training time and cashier errors". An alternative to screen-labeled <b>function</b> <b>keys</b> is buttons (virtual keys) on a touchscreen, where the label is directly pushable. The increased prevalence of touchscreens in the 2000s {{has led to a}} decrease in screen-labeled <b>function</b> <b>keys.</b> However, screen-labeled <b>function</b> <b>keys</b> are inexpensive and robust, and provide tactile feedback.|$|R

25|$|Within a community, {{keyboard}} layout is generally quite stable, {{due to the}} high training cost of touch-typing, and the resulting network effect of having a standard layout and high switching cost of retraining, and the suboptimal QWERTY layout is {{a case study in}} switching costs. Nevertheless, significant market forces can result in changes (as in Turkish adoption of QWERTY), and non-core keys are more prone to change, as they are less frequently used and less subject to the lock-in of touch-typing. The main, alphanumeric portion is typically stable, while symbol keys and shifted key values change somewhat, modifier keys more so, and function keys most of all: QWERTY dates to the No. 1 (1874) (though 1 and 0 were added later), shifted keys date in some cases to the No. 2 (1878), in other cases to the Selectric (1961), and modifier key placement largely dates to the Model M (1985); <b>function</b> <b>key</b> placement typically dates to the Model M, but varies significantly, particularly on laptops.|$|E

She has also been hired by MTV and Dick Clark Productions to host online preshows for awards broadcasts. In April 2009, she had approximately 50,000 MySpace friends and the system limit of 5,000 Facebook friends. An April 2009, USA Today article credited her with 386,000 Twitter followers. By June 2009, she had 590,000 Twitter followers, 94,000 subscribers to the iJustine YouTube channel and 25,000 Facebook fans. The USA Today story goes on to describe how she has scaled down her lifecasting because of its deleterious impact on her life. Carl's Jr. has hired a team of YouTube stars, including Ezarik to produce made-for-web ads for their new Portobello Mushroom Six-Dollar Burger on the Carl's Jr. YouTube channel, each endorser's YouTube page, and other Google-related media outlets. Following the August 6, 2009, Twitter Denial-of-service attack, Ezarik was featured in The Wall Street Journal describing her coping mechanisms, such as repeatedly tapping the F5 <b>function</b> <b>key</b> (the refresh button), for Twitter outages. In December 2009, USA Today reported that Ezarik earns about $75,000 annually from YouTube, and claims she has nearly a million followers on Twitter and 300,000 YouTube subscribers. The same article estimated {{that she has been}} viewed on YouTube a total of 64 million times and that her spoof on The Black Eyed Peas' [...] "I Gotta Feeling" [...] drew 4.8 million viewers. The article notes that Ezarik does her work with a $400 Canon Powershot digital camera and a $12 green rug from IKEA to create her green screen.|$|E

By default they came pre-programmed with the most common BASIC commands, in a similar fashion to GW-BASIC on the IBM PC.
