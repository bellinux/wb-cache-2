25|$|Some goalkeepers {{have scored}} goals. Other than by {{accident}} when a long kicked clearance reaches {{the other end}} of the field and evades the opposing goalkeeper with the aid of strong winds and/or unexpected bounces, this most commonly occurs where a goalkeeper <b>has</b> <b>rushed</b> up to the opposite end of the pitch to give his team a numerical advantage in attack, leaving his own goal undefended. As such, it is normally only done late in a game at set-pieces where the consequences of scoring far outweigh those of conceding a further goal, such as for a team trailing in a knock-out tournament.|$|E
