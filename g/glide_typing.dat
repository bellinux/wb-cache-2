40|$|The {{scanning}} transmission {{electron microscope}} (STEM) provides a route for the determination of interface structure and bonding directly from experimental data. Through an annular detector, Z-contrast images reveal atomic column locations without prior knowledge. The incoherent nature of such images allows a direct structure inversion through a maximum entropy analysis. The Z-contrast image also facilitates atomic-resolution spectroscopy by allowing the probe to be positioned with atomic precision. With this combination of atomic-resolution imaging and spectroscopy, structural units for [001] tilt grain boundaries in SrTiO{sub 3 } were identified. All units revealed the presence of half-filled columns, an efficient way to overcome the problem of like-ion repulsion in ionic materials. With the 1. 3 {angstrom} probe of the 300 -kV STEM, an unexpected core structure has been found for Lomer dislocations at a CdTe/ GaAs [001] interface, while 60 {degrees} dislocations were directly identified to be of <b>glide</b> <b>type...</b>|$|R

Dislocations introduced by high stress mechanical deformation have been studied by transmission electron microscopy (TEM). Burgers vectors of dislocations are of <b>type.</b> <b>Glide</b> dislocation loops {{have been found to}} lie in the (001) plane. Dislocation splitting has been evidenced. The possible dissociations of dislocations are discussed...|$|R
5000|$|<b>Gliding</b> {{formwork}}: This <b>type</b> of formwork {{is similar}} to the self-climbing type above. However, the climbing process is continuous instead of intermittent, and is usually only interrupted for a very short time (for example to fix the mounting mechanisms to new anchoring points). The advantage is that it will produce seamless structures, but it requires a continuous, uninterrupted process throughout, with serious potential quality and stability problems if the pour has to be stopped.|$|R
40|$|Detailed {{surveys of}} depth and {{velocity}} are undertaken to describe hydro-ecological status of rivers. Fieldwork for these surveys is time consuming and expensive. This paper aims {{to describe the}} methodology applied {{in order to determine}} the most suitable depth sampling strategy for effective field data collection and river representation in time and space at the Leigh Brook river site, Worcester, UK. The accuracy of three different sampling strategies for predicting depth at non-measured points has been compared and the mesohabitats that better characterise depth changes due to variations in discharge have been identified. The results show that depth changes due to discharge change are mainly located at shallow and deep <b>glide</b> mesohabitat <b>types.</b> The analysis for the comparison of sampling strategies indicates that grid sampling strategies give better results than regular transects. Since the results also show that higher errors in predictions are obtained in the deepest areas, higher sampling densities should be applied in these locations...|$|R
40|$|High-resolution {{electron}} microscope images were simulated for two structural models of Si crystal containing the 60 degrees dislocation of <b>glide</b> and shuffle <b>types,</b> respectively. The electron optical parameters for the image simulation {{were used by}} referring to a 200 kV field-emission high-resolution microscope. Since the contrast difference for {{the two types of}} dislocations is not significant enough for the eye to distinguish, it is impossible to determine the type of a dislocation from the image directly. Image reconstruction has been carried out by means of the image deconvolution technique. In the reconstructed images all atoms resolved individually and the two types of 60 degrees dislocations can be distinguished clearly. The effect and the limit of the method are discussed.

5000|$|One use of {{the word}} semivowel, {{sometimes}} called a <b>glide,</b> is a <b>type</b> of approximant, pronounced like a vowel but with the tongue closer to the roof of the mouth, so that there is slight turbulence. In English, /w/ is the semivowel equivalent of the vowel /u/, and /j/ (spelled [...] "y") is the semivowel equivalent of the vowel /i/ in this usage. Other descriptions use semivowel for vowel-like sounds that are not syllabic, but do not have the increased stricture of approximants. These are found as elements in diphthongs. The word may also be used to cover both concepts. The term glide is newer than semivowel, being used to indicate an essential quality of sounds such as /w/ and /j/, which is the movement (or glide) from their initial position (/u/ and /i/, respectively) to a following vowel.|$|R
40|$|A {{detailed}} study of the slip lines in deformed ordered and disordered Cu 3 Au single crystals has been carried out. The slip lines have been observed via optical metallography and by the two-step replica technique and subsequent examination in the electron microscope. Typical macroscopic stress-strain curves {{for each type of}} crystal have been noted as well as the change of specimen axis orientation with deformation. The crystals were deformed in strain increments of about 5 / 0 : After each strain increment, characteristic slip lines and specimen axis rotation were evaluated and studied. The current results are discussed {{in the light of the}} quantitative work hardening theories presented for ordered L 12 type superlattices by Vidoz 26 and Schoeck. 25 The results do not lend total support to either theory. In a qualitative discussion of the experimental data, we find the theory of Schoeck 25 to define the pertinent obstacles for dislocation <b>glide</b> in this <b>type</b> superlattice. For clarity, however, it appears further analysis of the details of the breakdown of attractive superdislocation junctions in ordered type L 12 super-lattices is required...|$|R
40|$|The spinodal {{decomposition}} of supersaturated Ni - 11. 8 at. % Ti single crystals (fcc structure) was studied during ageing at 853 and 1073 K. All {{the samples were}} homogenised at 1423 K and then waterquenched to room temperature prior to ageing. The quenched samples were found consisting of short-range ordered matrix and slightly L 12 - ordered Ti-rich domains. During the first sixty hours of ageing at 853 K, a "metastable situation" was found, where the microstructure of the samples did not change very much. Between sixty and five hundred hours of ageing, concentration waves developed, which grew in amplitude and wavelength with increasing ageing time. Later on, coarsening started, leading to metastable [MATH] particles (L 12 - structure), which began to become incoherent after 4000 h of ageing. The kinetics of Ni - 11. 8 at. % Ti single crystals at 1073 K were investigated in order to study the phase transformation to the stable [MATH] - Ni 3 Ti phase (D 024 - structure). Not fully D 024 - ordered nuclei with ABAC stacking sequences were observed. Furthermore, defective stacking sequences, derived from the ABAC stacking sequence, were found to occur frequently. A mechanism based on Shockley partial dislocations is suggested for the transformation of" the fcc structure to the ABAC stacking sequence of the DO 24 - structure. The mechanical properties of quenched and aged Ni - 11. 8 at. % Ti single crystals were investigated by compressive, tensile and fatigue tests performed at room temperature. The quenched specimens showed planar <b>glide</b> in all <b>types</b> of tests, and even strain bursts, which are typical for short-range ordered single crystals, were recorded during fatigue tests. Superdislocations and dislocation pile-ups were observed by Transmission electron microscopy in quenched samples, which were deformed in compression. The samples aged at 853 K, which were consisting of a microstructure containing concentration waves, showed a very localised deformation behaviour. Instabilities were observed in compressive tests, and in tensile and fatigue tests a low ductility was noted. In all types of tests a very high yield strength was measured. It may be assumed, that these special mechanical properties {{are the result of}} the tendency to nucleate the stable [MATH] phase. The dislocation structure of samples consisting of a microstructure with concentration waves, was found to be dominated by regularly dissociated a/ 2 dislocations. This dissociation into Shockley partial dislocations takes place in the Ti-rich domains. The dislocations may be considered to act as microprobes which are very sensitive to the Ti concentration. A model based on planar slip is presented, which describes the formation of defective microtwins, i. e. ABAC stacking sequences containing a/ 2 dislocation segments, out of regularly split, paired dislocations under an external stress in a microstructure consisting of concentration waves. These microtwins are the basic elements of the ABAC stacking sequence of the stable [MATH] phase...|$|R
