5|$|An infant's social {{environment}} relates {{to his or}} her later language development. Children's first words are closely linked to their early language experience. For children with typically developing language skills, there is a close match between maternal speech and their environment: up to 78% of maternal speech is matched to the object the child is focusing on. In children with <b>delayed</b> <b>language</b> development, only 50% of maternal speech is matched to the object the infant is focusing on. Infants are {{more likely to engage in}} joint attention when the parent talks about an object that the child is attending to as opposed to an object outside of the infant's attention. This increased level of joint attention aids in encouraging normal language development, including word comprehension and production. When joint attention is present, it plays an important role in word learning, a crucial aspect of language development.|$|E

Therefore, exposing such young children to television programs should be discouraged. Parents should engage children in more conversational activities to avoid television-related delays to their children language development, which could impair their intellectual performance.|$|E
50|$|Breast feeding is {{good for}} the child even with a mother with {{diabetes}} mellitus. Some women wonder whether breast feeding is recommended after they have been diagnosed with diabetes mellitus. Breast feeding is recommended for most babies, including when mothers may be diabetic. In fact, the child’s risk for developing type 2 diabetes mellitus later in life may be lower if the baby was breast-fed. It also helps the child to maintain a healthy body weight during infancy. However, the breastmilk of mothers with diabetes has been demonstrated to have a different composition than that of non-diabetic mothers, containing elevated levels of glucose and insulin and decreased polyunsaturated fatty acids. Although benefits of breast-feeding for the children of diabetic mothers have been documented, ingestion of diabetic breast milk has also been linked to <b>delayed</b> <b>language</b> development on a dose-dependent basis.|$|E
40|$|Background: Speech and {{language}} {{is the most}} important skill for the child’s development and scholastic performance. Awareness of the delay is important in the programs for early identification. Purpose: to assess the prevalence of speech and <b>language</b> <b>delay</b> in children from age group 0 to six years of age. Methodology: The speech {{and language}} development of children coming in the well baby clinic and daily pediatric clinic of age group from birth to 6 years were evaluated using Language Evaluation Scale Trivandrum (LEST). The prevalence of speech and <b>language</b> <b>delay</b> in each age group was calculated and also analyzed in the sociodemograhic profile. Results: A total of 102 children were studied in which 13. 7 % had <b>language</b> <b>delay.</b> 18 % had questionable <b>language</b> <b>delay</b> and 15. 7 % had suspect <b>language</b> <b>delay.</b> Though among <b>language</b> <b>delay</b> mixed type was more, children had more difficulty in doing expressive items. <b>Language</b> <b>delay</b> was also found to be more prevalent in males, single child, first born child and children of working mothers. Parental age, education or socioeconomic status was not found to be related to <b>language</b> <b>delay.</b> Conclusion: The 13. 7 % prevalence of <b>language</b> <b>delay</b> in the children indicates the need of early identification and for it a simple screening tool like LEST is a must during the routine evaluation of young children in pediatric clinics.

40|$|Abstract 	Scientific {{studies have}} {{consistently}} reported that, in group analyses, twin children have {{higher rates of}} <b>language</b> <b>delay</b> when compared with single-born children. This paper reviews the evidence on twin language by addressing five key questions: 1. 	What is the extent of <b>language</b> <b>delay</b> in twin children? 2. 	What are the causes of <b>language</b> <b>delay</b> in twin children? 3. 	Do twin children have a separate, private or "secret language" which inhibits normal development? 4. 	How might twin children’s language development be supported and promoted? 5. 	What are the future directions for research in the language development of twin children. The paper concludes that <b>language</b> <b>delay</b> in twins when compared with singletons is mild yet prevalent, particularly in males and is most likely a result of experience of poorer quality of language environment compared to single born children. Occurrence of "private" or "twin" language is rare and not {{an explanation for the}} findings of generalised <b>language</b> <b>delay</b> among twins. Given that <b>language</b> <b>delay</b> in twins relates to social - language experience, appropriate intervention and remediation of <b>language</b> <b>delay</b> should focus on providing a more stimulating language environment both within and outside the home. It is recommended that future research examine, longitudinally, the developmental course and consequences of <b>language</b> <b>delay</b> in twin children and trial interventions designed to improve their language experiences...|$|R
50|$|Children {{from low}} SES {{families}} who have had the unfair disadvantage of starting behind in language development do not tend to catch up, the delays may stay stable or increase in strength with age. In adolescence these delays are still present in children from Low SES families. Studies with 13-14 year olds from High and Low SES areas have indeed suggested that <b>delayed</b> <b>language</b> development is still very apparent in children from low SES families. Studies also found that children in areas of low SES {{were more likely than}} High SES children to have undetected language difficulties. Considering children from low SES families may never catch up to children in High SES families it is important to detect language difficulties much earlier than adolescents. In adolescents language growth has slowed and dramatic language accomplishments are less likely to occur.|$|E
50|$|In children, {{this type}} of hearing loss can lead to social {{isolation}} for several reasons. First, the child experiences delayed social development that is in large part tied to <b>delayed</b> <b>language</b> acquisition. It is also directly tied to their inability to pick up auditory social cues. This {{can result in a}} deaf person becoming generally irritable. A child who uses sign language, or identifies with the Deaf culture does not generally experience this isolation, particularly if he/she attends a school for the deaf, but may conversely experience isolation from his parents if they do not know, or make an effort to learn sign language. A child who is exclusively or predominantly an oral communicator can experience social isolation from his or her hearing peers, particularly if no one takes the time to explicitly teach them social skills that other children acquire independently by virtue of having normal hearing.|$|E

5000|$|Children of {{depressed}} {{mothers who}} do not regularly use CDS display <b>delayed</b> <b>language</b> development. Even when depressed mothers provide their infants with positive faces, infants {{do not respond to}} their attempts at CDS, and in turn do not benefit from this important route for language acquisition. Infants are unable to create the link between speech and visual face movements in situations such as these. When fathers who are not depressed are able to provide the stimulation of CDS, infants respond well and are able to compensate from the deficit left by their mothers. It is possible that if infants do not receive adequate CDS from their mothers, they will generalize this response to all females. This too can inhibit language and speech development. Therefore, this deficit can be especially harmful to infants with depressed mothers and little contact with male caregivers. [...] Socioeconomic status has been found to influence the development of vocabulary and language skills. Lower-status groups tend to be behind the development of children in higher-status families. This finding is thought to be due to the amount of time parents spend with the child and the ways they interact; mothers from higher-status groups are found to say more to their children, use more variety, and speak in longer sentences.|$|E

This study aimed to (a) study time spent on television in Thai infants and toddlers (age Methods Two hundred and sixty {{children and their parents}} were recruited into the study. Time spent on television and parental perceptions on television viewing toward their child's development were recorded during face-to-face and telephone interviews. Language development was assessed at the age of 2 years using the Clinical Linguistic Auditory Milestone Scale (CLAMS), and parents' report. Association between <b>delayed</b> <b>language</b> development and time spent on television viewing, as well as other various parameters such as gender, maternal education and family income, were analysed using a multivariate logistic regression model. Results Most Thai infants and toddlers watched television at the age of 6 months, 1 year and 2 years old (98. 0, 95. 3 and 96. 7 %, respectively). On average, 1 -year-old children watched television 1. 23 ± 1. 42 hours per day. This increased to 1. 69 ± 1. 56 hours per day when they were 2 years old.

40|$|The {{number of}} {{children}} that are identified as having a <b>language</b> <b>delay</b> is increasing. According to Rescorla (p. 4 (1984)), “Language delay {{is the most common}} developmental problem found in preschool children. ” Children with a <b>language</b> <b>delay</b> often struggle with reading and/or develop other types of learning disabilities (Aram 2 ̆ 6 Nation, 1980). It is imperative that children with a <b>language</b> <b>delay</b> are identified early and that interventions are both effective and functional (Dunst, Raab, 2 ̆ 6 Trivette, 2012). The preschool years are a critical period for language development. The impact of <b>language</b> <b>delays</b> can be lessened with interventions and support. Children in a preschool classroom with access to language throughout the day realize increased language development, this acts to close the gap between typical development and <b>language</b> <b>delays</b> (Ramey 2 ̆ 6 Ramey, 2004). Daily routines, including snack, are functional and effective ways of maximizing preschool students’ exposure to embedded language. This is especially true in special education classrooms where children can range from minor to severe <b>language</b> <b>delays.</b> Embedding <b>language</b> learning opportunities may be an effective way to teach many children at differing levels at the same time. Embedded language enables children to develop generalized language skills throughout the preschool day in different settings and this may lead to continued development and maintenance of these skills throughout life (Rakap 2 ̆ 6 Parlak-Rakap, 2011). There is currently a need for functional and effective instructional systems that are implemented into a child’s natural learning environments (Hemmeter, 2000; Odom, 2000; Sandall et al., 2005; VanDerHeyden et al., 2005) ...|$|R
