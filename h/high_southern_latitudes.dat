25|$|The Silurian {{is a major}} {{division}} of the geologic timescale that started about 443.8 ± 1.5 Ma. During the Silurian, Gondwana continued a slow southward drift to <b>high</b> <b>southern</b> <b>latitudes,</b> but {{there is evidence that}} the Silurian ice caps were less extensive than those of the late Ordovician glaciation. The melting of ice caps and glaciers contributed to a rise in sea levels, recognizable from the fact that Silurian sediments overlie eroded Ordovician sediments, forming an unconformity. Other cratons and continent fragments drifted together near the equator, starting the formation of a second supercontinent known as Euramerica. The vast ocean of Panthalassa covered most of the northern hemisphere. Other minor oceans include Proto-Tethys, Paleo-Tethys, Rheic Ocean, a seaway of Iapetus Ocean (now in between Avalonia and Laurentia), and newly formed Ural Ocean.|$|E

50|$|The southwestern winds {{make the}} outer islands wetter, {{reaching}} 1400 mm at Isla de los Estados (Island of the States).

50|$|Globigerina bulloides is {{a species}} of {{heterotrophic}} planktonic foraminifer with a wide distribution in the photic zone of the world's oceans.

50|$|Many ENSO {{linkages}} {{exist in}} the <b>high</b> <b>southern</b> <b>latitudes</b> around Antarctica. Specifically, El Niño conditions result in high-pressure anomalies over the Amundsen and Bellingshausen Seas, causing reduced sea ice and increased poleward heat fluxes in these sectors, {{as well as the}} Ross Sea. The Weddell Sea, conversely, tends to become colder with more sea ice during El Niño. The exact opposite heating and atmospheric pressure anomalies occur during La Niña. This pattern of variability is known as the Antarctic dipole mode, although the Antarctic response to ENSO forcing is not ubiquitous.|$|E
50|$|Weddell {{offered his}} {{services}} to the Admiralty with {{a proposal for a}} return voyage to the <b>high</b> <b>southern</b> <b>latitudes,</b> but was turned down. Instead, he returned to trading along the warmer Atlantic coasts. In 1829 he was still master of the Jane, but on a passage from Buenos Aires to Gibraltar the Jane leaked so badly that she had to be given up at the Azores. Weddell and his cargo were transferred to another ship for the passage to England, but this ran aground on the island of Pico, and Weddell only barely survived.|$|E
40|$|Because {{investigations}} of PAN at <b>higher</b> <b>southern</b> <b>latitudes</b> are very scarce, we measured surface PAN concentrations {{for the first}} time in Antarctica. During the Photochemical Experiment at Neumayer (PEAN' 99) campaign mean surface PAN mixing ratios of 13 +/- 7 pptv and maximum values of 48 pptv were found. When these PAN mixing ratios were compared to the sum of NOx and inorganic nitrate they were found to be equal or higher. Low ambient air temperatures and low PAN concentrations caused a slow homogeneous PAN decomposition rate of approximately 5 x 10 (- 2) pptv h(- 1) These slow decay rates were not sufficient to firmly establish the simultaneously observed NOx concentrations. In addition, low concentration ratios of [HNO 3]/[NOx] imply that the photochemical production of NOx within the snow pack can influence surface NOx mixing ratios in Antarctica. Alternate measurements of PAN mixing ratios at two different heights above the snow surface were performed to derive fluxes between the lower troposphere and the underlying snow pack using calculated friction velocities. Most of the concentration differences were below the precision of the measurements. Therefore, only an upper limit for the PAN flux of +/- 1 x 10 (13) molecules m(- 2) s(- 1) without a predominant direction can be estimated. However, PAN fluxes below this limit can still influence both the transfer of nitrogen compounds between atmosphere and ice, and the PAN budget in <b>higher</b> <b>southern</b> <b>latitudes.</b> (C) 2000 Elsevier Science Ltd.

50|$|Tundra and Molniya orbits {{are used}} to provide high {{latitude}} users with higher elevation angles than a geostationary orbit. Neither the Tundra nor Molniya orbit is geostationary because that is possible only over the equator, so both orbits are elliptical to reduce {{the time that the}} satellite is away from its service area. An argument of perigee of 270° places apogee at the northernmost point of the orbit. An argument of perigee of 90° would likewise serve the <b>high</b> <b>southern</b> <b>latitudes.</b> An argument of perigee of 0° or 180° would cause the satellite to dwell over the equator, but there would be little point to this as this could be better done with a conventional geostationary orbit.|$|E
50|$|The tectonic {{deformations}} on Venus {{occur on}} a variety of scales, the smallest of which are related to linear fractures or faults. In many areas these faults appear as networks of parallel lines. Small, discontinuous mountain crests are found which resemble those on the Moon and Mars. The effects of extensive tectonism are shown by the presence of normal faults, where the crust has sunk in one area relative to the surrounding rock, and superficial fractures. Radar imaging shows that these types of deformation are concentrated in belts located in the equatorial zones and at <b>high</b> <b>southern</b> <b>latitudes.</b> These belts are hundreds of kilometers wide and appear to interconnect across the whole of the planet, forming a global network associated with the distribution of volcanoes.|$|E

The tetrapod gap of equatorial Pangaea coincides with an end-Permian to Middle Triassic global [...] "coal gap" [...] that indicates the loss of peat swamps. Peat formation, a product of high plant productivity, was reestablished only in the Anisian stage of the Triassic, and even then only in <b>high</b> <b>southern</b> <b>latitudes,</b> although gymnosperm forests appeared earlier (in the Early Spathian), but again only in northern and southern higher latitudes. In equatorial Pangaea, the establishment of conifer-dominated forests was not {{until the end of the}} Spathian, and the first coals at these latitudes did not appear until the Carnian, ~15 million years after their end-Permian disappearance. These signals suggest equatorial temperatures exceeded their thermal tolerance for many marine vertebrates at least during two thermal maxima, whereas terrestrial equatorial temperatures were sufficiently severe to suppress plant and animal abundance during most of the Early Triassic.|$|E
40|$|The Antarctic {{topography}} and attendant {{katabatic wind}} regime appear {{to play a}} key role in the climate of the <b>high</b> <b>southern</b> <b>latitudes.</b> During the nonsummer months, persistent and often times intense katabatic winds occur in the lowest few hundred meters of the Antarctic atmosphere. These slope flows transport significant amounts of cold air northward and thereby modify the horizontal pressure field over the <b>high</b> <b>southern</b> <b>latitudes.</b> Three-year seasonal cycle numerical simulations using the NCAR Community Climate Model Version 1 (CCM 1) with and without representation of the Antarctic orography were performed to explore the role of the elevated terrain and drainage flows on the distribution and evolution of the horizontal pressure field. The katabatic wind regime is an important part of a clearly defined mean meridional circulation in the <b>high</b> <b>southern</b> <b>latitudes.</b> The position and intensity of the attendant sea level low pressure belt appears to be tied to the Antarctic orography. The seasonal movement of mass in the <b>high</b> <b>southern</b> <b>latitudes</b> is therefore constrained by the presence of the Antarctic ice sheet.

This Tethyan surface current system and the associated narrow zonal barrier show similarities to recent glacial climate patterns.
