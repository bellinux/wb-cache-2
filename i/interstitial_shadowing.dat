40|$|The {{activity}} of pulmonary lymphocytes was {{evaluated by the}} detection of interleukin- 2 (IL- 2) receptor alpha mRNA expression in lung cancer patients associated with diffuse <b>interstitial</b> <b>shadow</b> on roentgenograms of their lungs. Reverse transcription coupled with the polymerase chain reaction was used to detect mRNA expression. In 5 of 6 patients, IL- 2 R alpha mRNA expression was increased in pulmonary lymphocytes compared with 4 normal controls. The expression in this mRNA in peripheral blood lymphocytes was almost undetectable in either normal controls or these patients. These results suggest that pulmonary lymphocytes in patients with lung cancer associated with diffuse <b>interstitial</b> <b>shadows</b> are activated and may promote the inflammatory process generating pulmonary fibrosis...|$|R
40|$|The chest {{radiograph}} of very premature infants at 36 weeks post-conceptional age (PCA) {{was evaluated}} {{with regard to}} the degree of hyperinflation and cardiomegaly, and the presence of fibrosis/interstitial shadowing, cystic elements, air bronchograms and opacification. The evolution of abnormalities was assessed by comparing the radiograph appearance at 36 weeks PCA with that at 28 days post-natal age (PNA). Three scoring systems were used to determine how any abnormalities present could be best quantified to reflect disease severity as determined by chronic dependency upon supplementary oxygen status. Chest radiographs at 36 weeks PCA from 60 infants (median gestational age 26 weeks (range 24 - 28)) were studied. 47 infants also had radiographs at 28 days PNA. Only three infants had no chest radiograph abnormalities at 36 weeks PCA, although 24 infants were not dependent upon supplementary oxygen. The most common abnormalities were <b>interstitial</b> <b>shadowing</b> and hyperinflation, while cystic elements and cardiomegaly were rare. The radiographic appearance had deteriorated from 28 days PNA to 36 weeks PCA (p < 0. 05); more infants at 36 weeks PCA were hyperinflated (p < 0. 01). The chest radiograph appearances of infants who were dependent upon supplementary oxygen scored higher than those who were not (p < 0. 01) using all three scoring systems. The system that assessed only the presence of <b>interstitial</b> <b>shadowing,</b> cystic elements and hyperinflation had the highest specificity in identifying oxygen dependency beyond 36 weeks PCA and had the highest area under the respective receiver operator characteristic curve. In conclusion, the majority of very immature infants have an abnormal chest radiograph appearance at 36 weeks PCA. The appearance can, however, be meaningfully scored by evaluating only three abnormalities...|$|E
40|$|In {{a series}} of 25 {{patients}} with suspected pneumonia related to the acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS) the first 12 underwent routine fibreoptic bronchoscopy and bronchoalveolar lavage with or without transbronchial biopsy before treatment. Eight {{were found to have}} Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia and had typical clinical presentations with a prolonged history of symptoms, including a dry cough, and bilateral diffuse alveolar or <b>interstitial</b> <b>shadowing</b> in chest radiographs. Among the subsequent 13 cases, 11 had similar clinical presentations and were treated with high doses of intravenous co-trimoxazole without bronchoscopy first. Bronchoscopy was performed in those who deteriorated at any stage or failed to improve by the fifth day of treatment. Nine patients recovered and were discharged. In two patients who died P carinii pneumonia was confirmed in one but no diagnosis was made in the other. The early and late survival in both groups of patients was similar. In patients at high risk for AIDS who have clinical features suggestive of P carinii pneumonia starting treatment with intravenous co-trimoxazole is justified. The few patients who deteriorate or fail to respond should undergo bronchoscopy with bronchoalveolar lavage and transbronchial biopsy...|$|E
40|$|BACKGROUND [...] Pseudomonas aeruginosa {{infection}} is uncommon in HIV infected patients {{and is usually}} nosocomially acquired and associated with risk factors such as neutropenia or central lines. We have recently noted {{an increase in the}} number of respiratory isolates of Ps aeruginosa in hospitalised HIV positive patients and sought to describe the clinical correlates of this observation. METHODS [...] A retrospective case notes review of HIV positive patients admitted to a specialist unit for respiratory investigations from January 1989 to December 1993 was undertaken in order to identify those with Ps aeruginosa respiratory infection and to describe associated risk factors, patterns of presentation and radiographic abnormalities. RESULTS [...] Of 617 patients admitted 38 (6 %) had Ps aeruginosa respiratory infection (notes were incomplete in 1 patient). All patients had advanced HIV disease; median CD 4 = 0. 02 x 10 (9) /l. Two distinct presentations were seen; 9 patients had a fulminant course as part of a sepsis syndrome, 28 patients had an indolent presentation (18 had a single episode and 10 relapsed on one or more occasions, despite successful treatment of the initial episode). Infection was community acquired in 24 patients. Many patients had risk factors traditionally associated with Ps aeruginosa including neutropenia or indwelling central venous catheters, but 13 had no obvious risk factor. Most patients were receiving systemic pneumocystis prophylaxis and/or broad spectrum antibiotics; 20 had co-existent symptomatic sinus disease. A wide variety of chest radiographic abnormalities were seen including <b>interstitial</b> <b>shadowing,</b> mimicking pneumocystis pneumonia in 12 patients, lobar pneumonia in 2 and bronchial wall thickening in 13 patients. CONCLUSIONS [...] Ps aeruginosa respiratory infection occurs with increased frequency in patients with advanced HIV disease; in a significant proportion {{infection is}} community acquired. Although recognised risk factors were present in two thirds of patients it appears that advanced HIV immunosuppression, use of systemic pneumocystis prophylaxis and/or broad spectrum antibiotics and sinus disease are important risk factors. The diagnosis should be considered in patients with advanced HIV disease who present with new respiratory symptoms...|$|E

40|$|The {{presence}} of the HTLV-I gene in {{peripheral blood mononuclear cells}} was studied by polymerase chain reaction in 42 patients including 16 with lung cancer, 12 with diffuse panbronchiolitis (DPB), 11 with idiopathic interstitial pneumonia (IIP), and 3 with pneumoconiosis and hematological malignancy. Sequences equal to a part of the pX gene were found in 44 % of the lung cancer cases, 50 % of the DPB cases, 55 % of the IIP cases, and 100 % of the cases of pneumoconiosis and leukemia. In the lung cancer cases, detection of the pX gene was frequently associated with the existence of diffuse <b>interstitial</b> pulmonary <b>shadows.</b> The pX gene was detected in 100 % of patients with anti-HTLV-I antibody, 50 % of patients with HTLV-I-related reaction and 14 % of patients who tested seronegative.

40|$|Clinical {{features}} and findings on chest x-ray were analyzed {{to clarify the}} relationship between lung cancer and interstitial pneumonia. Of 262 patients with lung cancer, 69 patients (26. 3 %) had interstitial pneumonia. Patients with interstitial pneumonia (LC with IP) were older than those without interstitial pneumonia (LC without IP). The incidence of LC with IP cases among males and smokers were 29. 2 % and 29. 3 %, respectively. There {{were no significant differences}} among histlogic types and clinical stages of lung cancer. More cases of LC with IP had cancer in the lower (42. 0 %) and peripheral (76. 8 %) areas on chest x-ray films. Cancer was frequently located within the <b>interstitial</b> <b>shadow</b> on chest x-ray film. Among 40 patients with idiopathic interstitial pneumonia associated lung cancer (IIP with LC), there were 38 males and 32 smokers. No dominant histlogic subtype of lung cancer was noted in IIP with LC, though the most frequent was adenocarcinoma (16 cases, 40 %). In IIP with LC, the site of cancer was associated with active fibrotic changes in interstitial pneumonia. These data strongly suggest that carcinogenic factors were related to the fibrotic changes in interstitial pneumonia...|$|R
40|$|A case of {{organizing}} pneumonia is reported. A 74 -year-old man {{was admitted to}} our hospital complaining of general fatigue and dyspnea of 2 months' duration. Chest roentogenogram on admission revealed <b>interstitial</b> <b>shadow</b> in the left upper-to-middle lung field. Thereafter the chest x-ray shadow showed migration to the left lower lung and right middle lung fields, and superimposition with volume loss of the left lower lung. No pathogenic microorganisms were detected from sputum and throat swabs. No organisms were detected in the blood. Therefore he was set to conservative therapy alone. The antibody titer of parainfluenza virus type 1, initially 1 : 64, increased to 1 : 2048 just before bronchoscopy. The histopathological findings of TBLB showed that alveolar spaces were filled with organizing process and that septum was thickened slightly with edema and fibrosis, whose findings were compatible for organizing pneumonia. Prednisolone was begun and marked improvement of chest x-ray findings and clinical symptoms were achieved immediately. But recurrence was seen twice during withdrawal of steroids within six months and he died suddenly of unknown cause. Autopsy could not be performed. Although the pathogenesis {{of organizing}} pneumonia has not been determined yet, this case was of interest in two points : first, the chest x-ray finding {{was thought to be}} interstitial rather than alveolar process; and second, antibody of parainfluenza virus type 1 fluctuated, suggesting some pathogenetic relation...|$|R
40|$|AbstractThe {{clinical}} features of 24 patients with non-specific interstitial pneumonia (NIP) were evaluated. The patients consisted of seven men and 17 women, {{with a median}} age of 60 years. In seven patients, the disease was idiopathic and eight had collagen vascular diseases. Cough, dyspnoea and fever were frequently observed. The time interval between the onset of symptoms and open lung biopsy was 3 months. Mild increases of IgG, CRP, and LDH were also frequently observed. The average per cent VC was 65 · 1 ± 3 · 2 % and the average PaO 2 was 71 · 3 ± 2 · 4 Torr. Bronchoalveolar lavage was done in 20 patients, and a moderate increase in lymphocytes (27 · 8 ± 6 · 7 %) with a low CD 4 CD 8 ratio (0 · 86 ± 0 · 22) was observed. Multiple patchy infiltration or diffuse <b>interstitial</b> <b>shadows,</b> located predominantly in the lower fields of both lungs were the characteristic chest CT findings. Lung biopsies in this group were characterized by varying proportions of chronic interstitial inflammation and fibrosis which was temporarily uniform.

40|$|Abstract. The aim of {{this study}} was to explore the {{clinical}} characteristics of and treatment strategies for interstitial pneumonia induced by gefitinib in patients with advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). The detailed clinical data of one patient with NSCLC and gefitinib‑induced inter-stitial pneumonia were compiled and a review of relevant previous studies was performed. Based on this case report and the review, the clinical characteristics, mechanisms and treatment strategies of this rare disease were analyzed. The analyses showed that older, male patients with a long smoking history, high smoking index and adenocarcinoma (particu-larly bronchoalveolar carcinoma) were more likely to suffer from interstitial pneumonia while taking gefitinib. The onset time of interstitial pneumonia was 1 - 2 months subsequent to gefitinib administration. The clinical manifestations included chest tightness, shortness of breath, progressive dyspnea, severe hypoxemia and respiratory failure. Diffuse infiltration and alveolar <b>interstitial</b> <b>shadows</b> were observed on the chest tomography scan. In such circumstances, a timely judgment is required, in addition to the withdrawal of gefitinib treatment and the administration of high-dose glucocorticoids, as well as oxygen inhalation and anti-infective therapies, in order to relieve the symptoms. In conclusion, following the onset of gefitinib‑induced interstitial pneumonia, the discontinuation of gefitinib is likely to alleviate the suffering of the majority of patients. Early interstitial pneumonia is not an absolute index for the permanent discontinuation of gefitinib treatment. It is necessary to comprehensively consider the benefits and hazards of gefitinib for the patients...|$|R
40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{determine}} if chest radiograph appearance at 28 days or 36 weeks postmenstrual age (PMA) can predict recurrent wheeze or cough at follow up in prematurely born infants {{more effectively than}} readily available clinical data. DESIGN: Chest radiographs of infants entered into the UKOS trial, who had had a chest radiograph at 28 days and 36 weeks PMA and completed six months of follow up, were assessed {{for the presence of}} fibrosis, <b>interstitial</b> <b>shadows,</b> cystic elements, and hyperinflation. At 6 months of corrected age, the occurrence and frequency of wheeze and cough since discharge were determined using a symptom questionnaire. PATIENTS: A total of 185 infants with a median gestational age of 26 (range 23 - 28) weeks. RESULTS: Thirty seven infants wheezed more than once a week, compared {{with the rest of the}} cohort. These infants had significantly higher chest radiograph scores at 28 days (p = 0. 020) and 36 weeks PMA (p = 0. 005), with significantly higher scores at 28 days for fibrosis (p = 0. 017) and at 36 weeks PMA for fibrosis (p = 0. 001) and cystic elements (p = 0. 0007). They had also been ventilated for longer (p = 0. 013). Forty four infants coughed more than once a week; they did not differ significantly from the rest of the cohort. An abnormal chest radiograph score at 36 weeks PMA had the largest area under the receiver operator characteristic curve with regard to prediction of frequent wheeze. CONCLUSION: An abnormal chest radiograph appearance at 36 weeks PMA predicts frequent wheeze at follow up and appears to be a better predictor than readily available clinical data...|$|R
40|$|Thirty-one {{patients}} with lung cancer in Okinawa known as HTLV-Ⅰendemic area, and 140 patients in Okayama were evaluated {{in regard to}} HTLV-Ⅰinfection and iterstitial pulmonary shadows. The presence of HTLV-Ⅰinfection was examined by the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) method in peripheral blood mononuclear cells, and indirect immunofluorescent (IF) assay in sera. <b>Interstitial</b> pulmonary <b>shadows</b> on the chest roentgenograph, were classified according to the grade of fibrosis. The rate of HTLV-Ⅰinfection in {{patients with}} lung cancer was higher than that in healthy controls by IF assay in both districts. The rate of anti-HTLV-Ⅰantibody was higher in lung cancer patients with severe fibrosis than in those with milder fibrosis, but the grade of fibrosis and existence of pX gene had no relation in Okinawa or in Okayama. The incidence of patients with anti-HTLV-Ⅰantibody was higher in patients with adenocarcinoma and squamous cell carcinoma than in those with small cell carcinoma. These findings suggested that HTLV-Ⅰinfection was closely involved in some patients with {{non-small cell lung cancer}} having intersitital pulmonary shadows...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Introduction Orbital metastases of {{lung cancer}} are rare. However, {{because the number of}} {{patients}} diagnosed with lung cancer is increasing, the probability that a physician will see a patient with an orbital metastasis is also increasing. Unfortunately, the clinical course and response of these patients to cytotoxic chemotherapy are generally poor and keeping a patient’s quality of vision is difficult. In recent years, gefitinib, an epidermal growth factor receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitor, has brightened the outlook for patients with advanced non-small cell lung cancer, especially for those who carry epidermal growth factor receptor-activating mutations. Case presentation A 62 -year-old Japanese man presented with swelling of the eyelid margin and ptosis of his right eye. A physical examination revealed double vision in his right eye and an alteration in elevator muscle mobility. A magnetic resonance image demonstrated a right intra-orbital mass (18 × 16 mm). Screening examinations were carried out because this mass was suspected to be a metastasis from another organ. Chest computed tomography revealed a 42 × 37 mm mass shadow {{on the left side of}} the hilum with mediastinal lymph node metastases. Adenocarcinoma with an epidermal growth factor receptor gene mutation (exon 19 deletion L 747 -E 749; A 750 P) was detected in a transbronchial biopsy specimen; the patient was diagnosed with stage IV (T 2 N 2 M 1) non-small cell lung cancer. Gefitinib (250 mg/day) was chosen as first-line chemotherapy because there was no pre-existing <b>interstitial</b> <b>shadow.</b> After two months of treatment, the patient’s right eye opened completely and follow-up magnetic resonance imaging revealed a marked reduction of the intra-orbital mass to 14 × 13 mm. Three months after treatment initiation, a follow-up computed tomography showed a marked reduction in the size of the primary lesion to 23 × 20 mm. The patient is continuing gefitinib treatment without any adverse effects noted on computed tomography, physical, or laboratory examination. Conclusions We report the case of a patient with an orbital non-small cell lung cancer metastasis with epidermal growth factor receptor-activating mutations. This metastasis, as well as the primary lesion, showed a marked response to the molecular targeting drug gefitinib, and the patient’s vision was kept without an invasive procedure. Gefitinib may be a good first choice for patients with orbital non-small cell lung cancer metastasis harboring epidermal growth factor receptor-activating mutations. </p...|$|R
40|$|Diagnosis of pneumocystis {{pneumonia}} {{is based on}} identifying Pneumocystis carinii cytochemically in material from the lung. The silver methenamine staining methods most commonly used are technically difficult and lack specificity. The diagnostic value of immunocytological identification of the parasite was evaluated by using mouse monoclonal antibody 3 F 6, specific for human pneumocystis, to identify P carinii in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid and sputum by immunofluorescence and was {{compared with that of}} other variables. Bronchoalveolar lavage was performed on 25 patients positive for HIV antibody with clinically suspected {{pneumocystis pneumonia}} and 40 patients negative for HIV antibody who presented with interstitial disorders of the lung. Lavage fluid showed pneumocystis only in the patients positive for antibody, the parasite being detected in 19 by immunofluorescence and in 17 by a modified silver methenamine staining method. Chest x ray films obtained at the time of bronchoscopy showed <b>interstitial</b> or alveolar <b>shadowing</b> in 17 of the 19 patients, but clinical symptoms and the presence of antibodies to pneumocystis {{did not seem to be}} predictive. Sputum samples were collected during 43 episodes of clinically suspected pneumocystis pneumonia in patients positive for HIV antibody. Pneumocystis was detected consistently more commonly by immunofluorescence than the silver strain in sputum collected routinely and induced by inhalation of saline. In 17 patients bronchoalveolar lavage followed sputum collection, and the sensitivity of detection of pneumocystis in immunofluorescence in sputum compared with lavage fluid was 57 % (8 / 14). Immunofluorescence was suitable for specimens fixed in ethanol and seemed highly specific and more sensitive than the standard cytochemical methods for identifying pneumocystis...|$|R
