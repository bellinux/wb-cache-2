5|$|A simple case {{of dynamic}} {{equilibrium}} occurs in constant velocity motion across a surface with kinetic friction. In such a situation, a <b>force</b> <b>is</b> <b>applied</b> {{in the direction}} of motion while the kinetic friction force exactly opposes the applied force. This results in zero net force, but since the object started with a non-zero velocity, it continues to move with a non-zero velocity. Aristotle misinterpreted this motion as being caused by the applied force. However, when kinetic friction is taken into consideration it is clear that there is no net force causing constant velocity motion.|$|E
5|$|The {{simplest}} case {{of static}} equilibrium occurs when two forces are equal in magnitude but opposite in direction. For example, an object {{on a level}} surface is pulled (attracted) downward {{toward the center of}} the Earth by the force of gravity. At the same time, a <b>force</b> <b>is</b> <b>applied</b> by the surface that resists the downward force with equal upward force (called a normal force). The situation produces zero net force and hence no acceleration.|$|E
5|$|Wobble or shimmy {{begins when}} some {{otherwise}} minor irregularity, such as fork asymmetry, accelerates {{the wheel to}} one side. The restoring <b>force</b> <b>is</b> <b>applied</b> in phase with {{the progress of the}} irregularity, and the wheel turns to the other side where the process is repeated. If there is insufficient damping in the steering the oscillation will increase until system failure occurs. The oscillation frequency can be changed by changing the forward speed, making the bike stiffer or lighter, or increasing the stiffness of the steering, of which the rider is a main component.|$|E

5|$|Most fish move by {{alternately}} contracting paired sets {{of muscles}} {{on either side}} of the backbone. These contractions form S-shaped curves that move down the body. As each curve reaches the back fin, backward <b>force</b> <b>is</b> <b>applied</b> to the water, and in conjunction with the fins, moves the fish forward. The fish's fins function like an airplane's flaps. Fins also increase the tail's surface area, increasing speed. The streamlined body of the fish decreases the amount of friction from the water. Since body tissue is denser than water, fish must compensate for the difference or they will sink. Many bony fish have an internal organ called a swim bladder that adjusts their buoyancy through manipulation of gases.|$|E
25|$|Nearly {{all mixed}} martial arts {{organizations}} such as UFC, Pancrase, Shooto use a form of full-contact rules, as do professional boxing organizations and K-1. Kyokushin karate requires advanced practitioners to engage in bare-knuckled, full-contact sparring allowing kicks, knees and punching although punching to the head is disallowed while wearing only a karate gi and groin protector. Brazilian jiu-jitsu and judo matches do not allow striking, but are full-contact {{in the sense that}} full <b>force</b> <b>is</b> <b>applied</b> in the permitted grappling and submission techniques. Competitions held by the World Taekwondo Federation requires the use of Headgear and padded vest, but are full contact in the sense that full <b>force</b> <b>is</b> <b>applied</b> to strikes to the head and body, and win by knockout is possible.|$|E

25|$|The high {{proportion}} (50%) of glycine allows tight packing. This is because glycine's R group {{is only a}} hydrogen and so is not as sterically constrained.

25|$|Compliance - this is {{a measure}} of the amount in angle or {{distance}} that a robot axis will move when a <b>force</b> <b>is</b> <b>applied</b> to it. Because of compliance when a robot goes to a position carrying its maximum payload it will be at a position slightly lower than when it is carrying no payload. Compliance can also be responsible for overshoot when carrying high payloads in which case acceleration would need to be reduced.|$|E
25|$|Hence, {{with respect}} to an {{inertial}} frame, an object or body accelerates only when a physical <b>force</b> <b>is</b> <b>applied,</b> and (following Newton's first law of motion), {{in the absence of}} a net force, a body at rest will remain at rest and a body in motion will continue to move uniformlythat is, in a straight line and at constant speed.

From the inertial viewer's standpoint, positions one (1), two (2), three (3) are occupied in sequence. At position 2 the ball strikes the rail, and at position 3 the ball returns to the tosser. Straight-line paths are followed because the ball is in free flight, so this observer requires that no net <b>force</b> <b>is</b> <b>applied.</b>|$|E

40|$|Background: The aim of {{this study}} was to {{evaluate}} the hypothesis that budesonide increases the susceptibility of teeth to root resorption during the course of orthodontic treatment. Materials and Methods: A randomized controlled trial design (animal study) was employed. Budesonide was administered in test group for 14 days during which orthodontic <b>force</b> <b>was</b> <b>applied</b> to upper right molar. Afterwards, root resorption was measured on mesio-cervical and disto-apical parts of the mesial root on transverse histological sections. ANOVA and Bonfferoni tests were used. Statistical significance was considered to be P ≤ 0. 05. Results: In general, the subgroups in which the <b>force</b> <b>was</b> <b>applied</b> showed significantly greater root resorption. Where <b>force</b> <b>was</b> <b>applied</b> there <b>was</b> no significant difference, whether budesonide was administered or not. While where there <b>was</b> no <b>force,</b> a group who received budesonide showed significantly greater root resorption than the other, unless at the coronal level where the difference was not significant. Conclusion: Within the limitations of this study, it seems budesonide could increase root resorption, but in the presence of orthodontic <b>force</b> this effect <b>is</b> negligible...|$|R
25|$|When braking <b>force</b> <b>is</b> <b>applied,</b> {{the act of}} {{abrasive}} {{friction between}} the brake pad and the disc wears both the disc and pad away. The brake dust that is seen deposited on wheels, calipers and other braking system components consists mostly of disc material. Brake dust can damage the finish of most wheels if not washed off. Generally, a brake pad that aggressively abrades more disc material away, such as metallic pads, will create more brake dust. Some higher performing pads for track use or towing use may wear away much quicker than a typical pad causing additional dust from heightened brake disc wear and brake pad wear.|$|E
25|$|The {{natural process}} of healing a {{fracture}} starts when the injured bone and surrounding tissues bleed, forming a fracture hematoma. The blood coagulates {{to form a}} blood clot situated between the broken fragments. Within a few days, blood vessels grow into the jelly-like matrix of the blood clot. The new blood vessels bring phagocytes to the area, which gradually remove the non-viable material. The blood vessels also bring fibroblasts in {{the walls of the}} vessels and these multiply and produce collagen fibres. In this way the blood clot is replaced by a matrix of collagen. Collagen's rubbery consistency allows bone fragments to move only a small amount unless severe or persistent <b>force</b> <b>is</b> <b>applied.</b>|$|E
25|$|For example, {{calculating the}} FRF for a massndash&springndash&damper {{system with a}} mass of 1nbsp&kg, spring {{stiffness}} of 1.93nbsp&N/mm and a damping ratio of 0.1. The values of the spring and mass give a natural frequency of 7nbsp&Hz for this specific system. Applying the 1nbsp&Hz square wave from earlier allows the calculation of the predicted vibration of the mass. The figure illustrates the resulting vibration. It happens in this example that the fourth harmonic of the square wave falls at 7nbsp&Hz. The frequency response of the massndash&springndash&damper therefore outputs a high 7nbsp&Hz vibration even though the input force had a relatively low 7nbsp&Hz harmonic. This example highlights that the resulting vibration is dependent on both the forcing function and the system that the <b>force</b> <b>is</b> <b>applied</b> to.|$|E

25|$|A useful {{idea from}} {{mechanics}} {{is that the}} energy gained by a particle {{is equal to the}} force applied to the particle multiplied by the displacement of the particle while that <b>force</b> <b>is</b> <b>applied.</b> Now consider the first law without the heating term: dU = -PdV. The pressure P {{can be viewed as a}} force (and in fact has units of force per unit area) while dVis the displacement (with units of distance times area). We may say, with respect to this work term, that a pressure difference forces a transfer of volume, and that the product of the two (work) is the amount of energy transferred out of the system as a result of the process. If one were to make this term negative then this would be the work done on the system.|$|E
25|$|Friction {{extrusion}} {{was invented}} at The Welding Institute in the UK and patented in 1991. It was originally intended {{primarily as a}} method for production of homogenous microstructures and particle distributions in metal matrix composite materials. Friction extrusion differs from conventional extrusion in that the charge (billet or other precursor) rotates relative to the extrusion die. An extrusion <b>force</b> <b>is</b> <b>applied</b> so as to push the charge against the die. In practice either the die or the charge may rotate {{or they may be}} counter-rotating. The relative rotary motion between the charge and the die has several significant effects on the process. First, the relative motion in the plane of rotation leads to large shear stresses, hence, plastic deformation in the layer of charge in contact with and near the die. This plastic deformation is dissipated by recovery and recrystallization processes leading to substantial heating of the deforming charge. Because of the deformation heating, friction extrusion does not generally require preheating of the charge by auxiliary means potentially resulting in a more energy efficient process. Second, the substantial level of plastic deformation in the region of relative rotary motion can promote solid state welding of powders or other finely divided precursors, such as flakes and chips, effectively consolidating the charge (friction consolidation) prior to extrusion.|$|E

50|$|Components of {{mechanical}} systems will store elastic potential energy if they <b>are</b> deformed when <b>forces</b> <b>are</b> <b>applied</b> to the system. Energy {{is transferred to}} an object (i.e. work is done on it) any time a force external to it displaces or deforms the object.

As <b>forces</b> <b>are</b> <b>applied</b> to the system they are distributed internally to its component parts. While some of the energy transferred can end up stored as kinetic energy of acquired velocity, the deformation of the shape of component objects results in stored elastic energy.|$|R
