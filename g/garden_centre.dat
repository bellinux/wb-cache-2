5|$|Abi invites Dot to Christmas in Exeter but Dot insists she {{has plans}} of her own. The {{launderette}} closes on Christmas Eve, but everyone is {{too busy to}} visit her. She finds a Christmas mixtape recorded by her now-deceased friend Heather Trott (Cheryl Fergison), and takes in a stray cat, which she eventually names Dave. She spends Christmas Day alone, but when Patrick realises she has not gone to Exeter, he invites her to The Queen Victoria pub where everyone is celebrating Christmas, and her neighbours present her with the gift of a washing machine. When Ronnie, the wife of Dot's former stepson, Jack Branning (Scott Maslen), and her sister Roxy Mitchell (Rita Simons), mother of one of Jack's children, both die, Dot tells the children {{that they are in}} heaven, helping them to understand after Jack struggles to find an appropriate way to tell them. When Jack is unable to take Dot to the <b>garden</b> <b>centre,</b> she decides to drive herself with her great-grandson, Matthew Mitchell Cotton, but drives through a no entry sign into oncoming traffic and ends up in the verge.

Dot's step granddaughter Abi Branning (Lorna Fitzgerald) lives with her for a while but moves out with Dot's blessing. Dot is surprised when Charlie returns but is left upset when Charlie leaves to go back to Ireland with Mathew, also upsetting Jack.

The neighbouring station yard was recently developed as a housing estate and the station site has been bought by a housing association. The name of the station was Newnham Bridge rather than Newnham to avoid confusion with Newnham, Gloucestershire, which also had a GWR station; previously the village was known as Newnham and some maps still show it as such.|$|E
25|$|This {{relatively}} new cinema is situated {{just off the}} Atlantic Highway, and opened on 11 August 1988. Originally, the cinema site was a <b>garden</b> <b>centre</b> and café, but was purchased by the Collard family in 1986 to convert it into a cinema, as the nearest cinema to Bude was over 30 miles away in Wadebridge. It was built and designed by the film producer, Mervyn Collard (who produced actor David Jason's first film, White Cargo. Mervyn died in 2004). Work started on the build {{at the end of}} 1987, and Westar 7000s projectors were installed, along with the carpets and seats and other fittings. The projectors were moved from the former Strand Cinema in Bideford, Devon. The architect was Martin Back.|$|E

25|$|The {{second act}} takes {{place after the}} dinner. In spite of Arabella {{spending}} the entire dinner unconscious, and Paige and Micky joining the meal and messing up the cutlery arrangement, things have evidently gone well. Julie-Ann, having swapped dresses with Paige at some point, attempts to make things up with Arabella, although Arabella never seems to grasp which girl is which. However, things start to go downhill when Derek has a private word with Justin. Derek suggests Justin should move up to Doncaster to take over his <b>garden</b> <b>centre</b> business, oblivious to Justin's hints {{that he is not}} interested. Furthermore, Justin learns from Derek that the reason Derek and Dee fell out with Julie-Ann's two sisters was because {{one of them is a}} lesbian and the other married a Chinese man.|$|E
500|$|In 1997 the British Army {{created a}} {{recruiting}} advertisement re-using Leete's image substituting Kitchener's face {{with that of}} a British Army non-commissioned officer of African descent. Leete's image of Kitchener is featured on a 2014 £2 coin produced by sculptor John Bergdahl for the Royal Mint. [...] The coin was the first of a five-year series to commemorate the centennial of the war. [...] Use of Leete's image of Kitchener has been criticized by some for its pro-war connotation in light of the human losses of the First World War and the violence of Kitchener's campaign in Sudan. In July 2014, one of only four original posters known to exist went to auction for more than £10,000. The other three originals exist on display in State Library of Victoria, the Museum of Brands, Packaging and Advertising, and the Imperial War Museum. Leete's design was also used for a corn maze in the Skylark <b>Garden</b> <b>Centre</b> in Wimblington to mark the centenary of World War I.|$|E
500|$|Wellard is {{considered}} a [...] "celebrity" [...] dog, and during his EastEnders tenure, the dogs playing him would occasionally make personal appearances at events, including the dog-show Crufts in 1998, a fundraising appeal for the Victoria Animal Hospital in London in 2000, and the first All About Dogs Day at Notcutts <b>garden</b> <b>centre</b> in August 2008. Satirical impression series Dead Ringers referenced Wellard in a 2004 episode, running the continuity announcement: [...] "Later on ITV1, new drama featuring the latest EastEnders star we've {{signed up for a}} ridiculous advance. Yes Wellard the dog is Barker, a cop on the edge with a drink problem and distemper." [...] For Red Nose Day 2007, Aardman Animations created a Creature Comforts-style short featuring Wellard asking for money for Comic Relief, along with selling his offspring and being put in prison. In January 2012, Wellard appeared (with Dean Gaffney) on Big Brother's Bit on the Side.|$|E

50|$|At its height, West Coast {{investments}} {{covered over}} 50 companies, and Hunter was {{touted as a}} possible bidder for Selfridges - he lost out to Galen Weston.

2500|$|In 1977 Broxtowe Borough Council {{bought a}} [...] {{stretch of the}} top pound, running from Eastwood through Awsworth, Cossall and Trowell to {{the outer edge of}} the city of Nottingham at Bramcote. On the Trowell section are the remains of Swansea bridge, one of the {{original}} stone bridges, which is Grade II listed, was built in 1793–95, and has wooden keep gates. The view from the bridge overlooks Trowell <b>Garden</b> <b>Centre</b> where you can see the original stone built lock keepers cottages, 1&2 Swansea Cottages, Trowell, built in 1794–95. The name Swansea for the bridge and cottages originates from the fact that this particular part of the canal is where large quantities of swans used to congregate. Due to the lack of water in 1980 a decision was taken by the <b>garden</b> <b>centre</b> and the Royal Society for the Protection of Birds (RSPB) to relocate them.|$|E
2500|$|A plant nursery is an {{agricultural}} operation where (non-bonsai) plants are propagated and grown to usable size. Nursery stock {{may be available}} directly from the nursery, or may be sold in a <b>garden</b> <b>centre</b> or similar resale establishment. Nursery stock is usually young but fully viable, and is often potted with sufficient soil to allow plants to survive a season or two before being transplanted into a more permanent location. Because the nursery tree is already pot-conditioned, it can be worked on as a bonsai immediately. The large number of plants that can be viewed in a single visit to a nursery or <b>garden</b> <b>centre</b> allows the buyer to identify plants with better-than-average bonsai characteristics. According to Peter Adams, a nursery visit [...] "offers the opportunity to choose an instant trunk". One issue with nursery stock is that many specimens are shaped into popular forms, such as the standard or half-standard forms, with several feet of clear trunk rising from the roots. Without branches low on the trunk, {{it is difficult for}} a source specimen to be trained as bonsai.|$|E

His experience resulted in the permission to keep his pet African eagle owl Jewl. One day he bought a book titled [...] "Belgian Chocolate Cakes and Chocolate" [...] from a nearby <b>garden</b> <b>centre.</b> [...] He started by making chocolate mousse and cakes, but eventually he focused on making chocolates and he became the youngest person {{to go on a}} course (and get certified) at the Banbury branch of the prestigious Callebaut Chocolate Academy. and he also works as a public speaker.|$|E
