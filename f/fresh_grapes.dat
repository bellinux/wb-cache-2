Recently, yaş üzüm rakısı ("fresh-grape raki") has become more popular in Turkey. The maker of a recent brand, Efe Rakı, was the first company to produce raki exclusively of fresh grape suma, called Efe Yaş Üzüm Rakısı (Efe Fresh Grape Raki). Tekirdağ Altın Seri (Tekirdağ Golden Series) followed the trend and many others have been produced by other companies.|$|E
25|$|According to Canadian Food and Drug Regulations, wine in Canada is an {{alcoholic}} beverage that {{is produced by}} the complete or partial alcoholic fermentation of <b>fresh</b> <b>grapes,</b> grape must, products derived solely from <b>fresh</b> <b>grapes,</b> or any combination of them. There are many materials added {{during the course of}} the manufacture, such as yeast, concentrated grape juice, dextrose, fructose, glucose or glucose solids, invert sugar, sugar, or aqueous solutions. Calcium sulphate in such quantity that the content of soluble sulphates in the finished wine shall not exceed 0.2 per cent weight by volume calculated as potassium sulphate. Calcium carbonate in such quantity that the content of tartaric acid in the finished wine shall not be less than 0.15 per cent weight by volume. Also, sulphurous acid, including salts thereof, in such quantity that its content in the finished wine shall not exceed 70 parts per million in the free state, or 350 parts per million in the combined state, calculated as sulphur dioxide. Caramel, amylase and pectinase at a maximum level of use consistent with good manufacturing practice. Brandy, fruit spirit or alcohol derived from the alcoholic fermentation of a food source distilled to not less than 94 per cent alcohol by volume. Prior to final filtration may be treated with a strongly acid cation exchange resin in the sodium ion form, or a weakly basic anion exchange resin in the hydroxyl ion form.|$|E

25|$|Belt press- This press {{utilizes}} {{a series}} of air-inflated pads along a wire mesh belt. Usually several meters long, <b>fresh</b> <b>grapes</b> are loaded onto {{the beginning of the}} belt where it is transferred by rollers through the series of pads that apply pressure, hold it for a time and release with the juice falling through the screens into waiting press pans. Belt presses have been used by high volume wineries for whole-cluster pressing and sparkling wine production but it has not caught on in many wine regions due to concerns about the amount of oxidation it introduces to the wine as well as the large amount of suspended solids that get past the screens.|$|E

40|$|Grape seed, {{which is}} an organic waste arise from {{production}} of wine, juice and molasses, is considered as a functional food ingredient in food formulations because of its rich content of bioactive compounds. This study was performed in order to evaluate the effect of air-drying temperature on the bioactive compounds of grape seeds. In the study, total phenolic content and antioxidant activity of grape seeds that are dehydrated at different drying temperatures (40, 50 and 60 °C) were determined. When comparing the <b>fresh</b> <b>grape</b> seeds with the corresponding dehydrated samples, it was shown that the drying operation led to reduction of total phenolic contents and the total phenolic contents decreased with an increase of the drying temperature. According to ABTS radical scavenging method, Trolox Equivalent Antioxidant Capacity (TEAC) {{was found to be}} highest for <b>fresh</b> <b>grape</b> seeds and presented lower values for grape seeds dried at three different temperatures. As a result of the study, it was demonstrated that grape seed is a powerful antioxidant source and it has still high antioxidant activity after drying process.

A systematic study of the phytochemical content in tomato, eggplant, carrot, broccoli and <b>grape</b> (<b>fresh</b> and fresh-cut) has been performed at different seasons, using liquid chromatography coupled to triple quadrupole mass spectrometry. It was observed that phenolic acids (the predominant group in carrot, eggplant and tomato) were found at higher concentrations in fresh carrot than in fresh-cut carrot. However, in the case of eggplant, they were detected at a higher content in fresh-cut than in fresh samples. Regarding tomato, the differences in the content of phenolic acids between fresh and fresh-cut were lower than in other matrices, except in winter sampling, where this family was detected at the highest concentration in <b>fresh</b> tomato. In <b>grape,</b> the flavonols content (predominant group) was higher in <b>fresh</b> <b>grape</b> than in fresh-cut during all samplings. The content of glucosinolates was lower in fresh-cut broccoli than in fresh samples in winter and spring sampling, although this trend changes in summer and autumn.

40|$|The {{effects of}} UV-C {{irradiation}} on the inactivation of Escherichia coli K- 12 (ATCC 25253), a surrogate of E. coli O 157 :H 7, {{and on the}} shelf life of freshly squeezed turbid white grape juice (FSWGJ) were investigated. FSWGJ samples were processed at 0. 90 mL/s for 32 min by circulating 8 times in an annular flow UV system. The UV exposure time was 244 s per cycle. The population of E. coli K- 12 was reduced by 5. 34 log cycles after exposure to a total UV dosage of 9. 92 J/cm 2 (1. 24 J/cm 2 per cycle) at 0. 90 mL/s flow rate. The microbial shelf life of UV-C treated FSWGJ was extended up to 14 d at 4 °C. UV exposure was not found to alter pH, total soluble solid, and titratable acidity of juice. There was a significant effect (P < 0. 05) on turbidity, absorbance coefficient, color, and ascorbic acid content. Furthermore, all physicochemical properties were altered during refrigerated storage. The microbial shelf life of FSWGJ was doubled after UV-C treatment, whereas the quality of juice was adversely affected similarly observed in the control samples. Practical Applications: UV-C irradiation is a non-thermal method used for processing of fruit juices with a minimal or no changes in flavor, essential nutrients, and vitamins. <b>Fresh</b> <b>grape</b> juice is a popular drink, usually consumed at summer time due to many beneficial health effects. Although thermal pasteurization is widely used for extending the shelf life of fruit juices, it causes a "cook taste" in grape juice.
