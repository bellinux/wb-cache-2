5|$|A 2003 {{attempt by}} Christopher Brochu {{included}} Albertosaurus, Alectrosaurus, Alioramus, Daspletosaurus, Gorgosaurus, Tarbosaurus and Tyrannosaurus in the definition. Holtz redefined the clade in 2004 {{to use all}} of the above as specifiers except for Alioramus and Alectrosaurus, which his analysis could not place with certainty. However, in the same paper, Holtz also provided a completely different definition, including all theropods more closely related to Tyrannosaurus than to Eotyrannus. The most recent definition <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>of</b> Sereno in 2005, which defined Tyrannosauridae as the least inclusive clade containing Albertosaurus, Gorgosaurus and Tyrannosaurus.|$|E
5|$|A case {{somewhat}} similar to Batesian mimicry <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>of</b> mimetic weeds, which imitate agricultural crops. In weed or Vavilovian mimicry, the weed survives by having seeds which winnowing machinery identifies {{as belonging to}} the crop. Vavilovian mimicry is not Batesian, because man and crop are not enemies.|$|E

2500|$|... "From Adam, {{the first}} man created by God, to Noah, at whose time the flood took place, there were ten generations. The first, which was from God, <b>was</b> <b>that</b> <b>of</b> Adam.

The fourth, 190 years after Enos, <b>was</b> <b>that</b> <b>of</b> Kainan begotten of Enos. The fifth, 170 years after Kainan, <b>was</b> <b>that</b> <b>of</b> Mahaleel begotten of Kainan. The sixth, 165 years after Mahaleel, <b>was</b> <b>that</b> <b>of</b> Jared begotten of Mahaleel. The seventh, 162 years after Jared, <b>was</b> <b>that</b> <b>of</b> Enoch begotten of Jared.

5|$|A last {{group of}} sheep breeds <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>of</b> fur or hair sheep, {{which do not}} grow wool at all. Hair sheep {{are similar to the}} early domesticated sheep kept before woolly breeds were developed, and are raised for meat and pelts. Some modern breeds of hair sheep, such as the Dorper, result from crosses between wool and hair breeds. For meat and hide producers, hair sheep are cheaper to keep, as they do not need shearing. Hair sheep are also more {{resistant}} to parasites and hot weather.|$|E

5|$|Above {{the window}} is the album title {{and at the top}} of the cover is the band's name in a {{typeface}} more crafty than on previous album covers.

5|$|An example {{he gives}} of the {{difficulty}} of obtaining missing data from drug companies <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>of</b> oseltamivir (Tamiflu), manufactured by Roche to reduce the complications of bird flu. Governments spent billions of pounds stockpiling this, based in large part on a meta-analysis that was funded by the industry. Bad Pharma charts the efforts of independent researchers, particularly Tom Jefferson of the Cochrane Collaboration Respiratory Group, to gain access to information about the drug.|$|E
5|$|The voice used on WWV <b>was</b> <b>that</b> <b>of</b> Don Elliott Heald until August 13, 1991, when {{equipment}} changes required rerecording the announcer's voice.

30|$|Another {{approach}} (used herein) is to {{take advantage}} of the clear disparity in zonal scales, between PSSR and upwelling, to extract the contributions to ‘PSSR.’ <b>That</b> <b>is,</b> if estimates <b>of</b> ‘PSSR’ are the same, when measured by ionosondes spaced in longitude, the estimate of ‘PSSR’ is likely to <b>be</b> <b>that</b> <b>of</b> PSSR-only, and <b>that</b> an upwelling <b>was</b> not present. But, if the estimates are different, the smaller of the two is likely to <b>be</b> <b>that</b> <b>of</b> PSSR and the difference in estimates would likely <b>be</b> <b>that</b> <b>of</b> upwelling growth.|$|R
