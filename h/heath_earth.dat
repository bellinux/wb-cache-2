50|$|Mousehold Heath {{is part of}} a glacio-fluvial {{outwash plain}} landform {{dissected}} by periglacial dry valley development. Its geology represents a complex stack of glacial deposits of the Anglian (stage) glaciation resting on bedrock of Cretaceous Chalk and Norwich Crag Formation. The geodiversity of Mousehold Heath has been interpreted by the Mousehold <b>Heath</b> <b>Earth</b> Heritage Trail.|$|E
5000|$|Heading back to <b>Earth,</b> <b>Heath</b> {{picks up}} Mara, another {{survivor}} from the mostly decimated <b>Earth.</b> <b>Heath</b> is sidetracked into joining with {{a race of}} seemingly primitive aliens, only to find they are not what they seem. It is revealed that Heath is the lone remaining Fear Agent, following the mass slaughter {{of all of the}} other Fear Agents in an unknown incident. Heath then discovers a member of the [...] "primitive" [...] race is planning to betray him and his brethren by giving him to the Dressite Empire, who have posted a bounty on his head for a prior incident.|$|R

5000|$|Proposition 7 {{states that}} the {{distance}} of the sun from the earth is greater than 18 times, but less than 20 times, {{the distance of the}} moon from the <b>earth</b> (<b>Heath</b> 1913:377). In other words, the sun is 18 to 20 times farther away and wider than the moon.|$|R
40|$|This {{classic work}} traces Aristarchus of Samos's {{anticipation}} by two millennia of Copernicus's revolutionary {{theory of the}} orbital motion of the <b>earth.</b> <b>Heath's</b> history of astronomy ranges from Homer and Hesiod to Aristarchus and includes quotes from numerous thinkers, compilers, and scholasticists from Thales and Anaximander through Pythagoras, Plato, Aristotle, and Heraclides. 34 figures...|$|R
60|$|With {{the first}} stroke of twelve a great noise arose over the silent <b>heath,</b> and the <b>earth</b> seemed to rock under {{the feet of}} the two watchers. The next moment {{by the light of the}} moon they beheld the huge stones near them leave their places and go down the slope leading to the river, {{knocking}} against each other in their haste. Passing the spot where stood Bernez and the beggar, they were lost in the darkness. It seemed as if a procession of giants had gone by.|$|R
50|$|Heath is {{imprisoned by}} The Keepers, {{a race of}} aliens {{responsible}} for the fabric of time who plan to restore the Teteldian Empire. After The Keepers release him, he becomes sexually involved with Mara. He then receives a message from a mysterious version of Mara, but disregards it. <b>Heath</b> returns to <b>Earth</b> to see if his wife, Charlotte is alive, but finds Earth overrun by the Dressen Empire, and believes Charlotte dead. An army of Dressites attack Heath, but {{a small army of}} Fear Agents rescue Heath. When the group return to their base on the Moon, Heath discovers Charlotte is now the head of the Earth rebellion, and is happily married to one of the other Fear Agents.|$|R
6000|$|During this anxious night, Washington was assiduously {{occupied}} throwing {{back his}} right wing to stronger ground; doubling his intrenchments and constructing three redoubts, {{with a line}} in front, on the summit of his post. These works were principally intended for defence against small arms, and were thrown up with a rapidity that to the enemy must have savored of magic. They were, in fact, made of the stalks of Indian corn or maize taken from a neighboring corn-field, and pulled up with the earth clinging in masses to the large roots. [...] "The roots of the stalks," [...] says <b>Heath,</b> [...] "and <b>earth</b> on them placed {{in the face of}} the works, answered the purpose of sods and fascines. The tops being placed inwards, as the loose earth was thrown upon them, became as so many trees to the work, which was carried up with a despatch scarcely conceivable." ...|$|R
50|$|Enraged at {{the loss}} of his comrades, Heath takes a bomb to the Dressite homeworld, despite his close friend Otto's dying wish that Heath not commit {{genocide}} of the entire Dressite race. Heath goes through with his plan. Later, after awakening back on <b>Earth,</b> <b>Heath</b> learns that the Dressites have left. A representative from the United Systems lands on Earth, and explains that the Dressite military was serving as their peace keeping force, and is very unpopular on their homeworld. Resentful of being ostracized at home and forced to protect other species far from home, the Dressites unfairly took out their frustrations on humanity. The representative believes that the Tetaldians carried out the genocide, but Charlotte realizes with horror that it was in fact her husband that killed trillions of innocent Dressites. Horrified at this, Charlotte leaves him. A bounty is then placed on Heath's head by the Dressites.|$|R
40|$|The heath land {{vegetation}} {{of northern}} New Zealand is usually {{regarded as a}} "derived" vegetation type resulting from forest destruction during the Maori and European periods of settlement. Plant species coverabundance data from sample quadrats in the Far North are analysed using Detrended Correspondence Analysis (DCA) and Two-way Indicator Species Analysis (TWINSPAN) and are then correlated with soil nutrient data.

5000|$|Standing on a mound on Godlingston Heath is the 17 ft (5.2 m) high Agglestone Rock, {{estimated}} to weigh 400 tons. The rock {{is also known}} as the Devil's Anvil, and local myth states that the devil threw it there from The Needles on the Isle of Wight, reputedly aiming for Corfe Castle, Bindon Abbey or Salisbury Cathedral. In truth, it is more than likely part of a band of rocks that run across the whole of Godlingston <b>Heath.</b> The sandy <b>earth</b> was eroded around the firmer rock and left it standing proud. [...] "Aggle" [...] was taken into the old Dorset dialect as meaning [...] "to wobble". In September 1970 the rock fell to one side, resulting in it losing its distinctive inverted-cone 'anvil' appearance. Other lumps in the landscape can be seen across the heath, including the Puckstone which, in years to come, may be another standing rock similar to the Agglestone.|$|R
