The Aladdin HVC30 system uses a 'hygroseal' cartridge. This is a small disc of material that expands when wet and shrinks if warm and dry. A dry valve acts as an air vent until a dribble of water passes through it and swells the cartridge. If the valve dries out again, it re-opens.

40|$|The {{public sector}} is the {{dominant}} financier {{of health care in}} most OECD countries. But {{in the last two decades}} the extent of private finance has increased in most of these countries, and private finance now accounts for around a quarter of all health care finance. On the <b>delivery</b> <b>side,</b> the dominance of the public sector is much less strong and mixed public and private provision is common. Many recent reforms in health care have sought to increase the role for the private sector in health care provision. Against this backdrop, this paper examines the case for, and the empirical evidence to support, an increase in the role for the private sector in finance and delivery. The paper starts with a brief overview of the current position. It then examines the case and evidence on the finance side, and then the case and evidence on the <b>delivery</b> <b>side.</b> The evidence used is drawn primarily from the experience of OECD countries other than the USA, both because the American experience is better known and because the USA is an outlier in terms of the level of private finance and delivery within this group of countries. Nearly all of the recent reforms, which have sought to increase the role for the private sector, have been in countries where the public sector plays a greater role in both finance and delivery than in the USA...|$|E

Post-fracture X-ray data of the OTM fractured at 1000 C in environment were refined by FullProf code and results indicate a distortion of the parent cubic perovskite to orthorhombic structure with reduced symmetry. TGA-DTA studies on the post-fracture samples also indicated residual effect arising from the thermal and stress history of the samples.
