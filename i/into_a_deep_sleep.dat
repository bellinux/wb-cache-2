5|$|Born to a large, impoverished {{family of}} farm workers, Ellen {{was sent to}} work as a nursemaid at the age of eleven. Soon afterwards, she began {{suffering}} periods of drowsiness and was referred to a local hospital. After four months her condition was declared incurable, and she was sent home. Two days later, Ellen had a series of seizures and—her mother claimed—fell <b>into</b> <b>a</b> <b>deep</b> <b>sleep</b> from which she could not be roused.|$|E
5|$|For {{some time}} {{researchers}} have been aware that pods of sperm whales may sleep for short periods, assuming a vertical position with their heads just below or at the surface. A 2008 study published in Current Biology recorded evidence that whales may sleep with {{both sides of the}} brain. It appears that some whales may fall <b>into</b> <b>a</b> <b>deep</b> <b>sleep</b> for about 7 percent of the time, most often between 6 p.m. and midnight.|$|E
5|$|Latin sources {{add that}} Oenopion {{was the son}} of Dionysus. Dionysus sent satyrs to put Orion <b>into</b> <b>a</b> <b>deep</b> <b>sleep</b> so he could be blinded. One source tells the same story but {{converts}} Oenopion into Minos of Crete. It adds that an oracle told Orion that his sight could be restored by walking eastward and that he found his way by hearing the Cyclops' hammer, placing a Cyclops as a guide on his shoulder; it does not mention Cabeiri or Lemnos—this is presumably the story of Cedalion recast. Both Hephaestus and the Cyclopes were said to make thunderbolts; they are combined in other sources. One scholion, on a Latin poem, explains that Hephaestus gave Orion a horse.|$|E

5|$|The {{party is}} unable to heal Sophie with magic or {{medicine}} so Pascal suggests the party travel to Fodra, a nearby planet, where Sophie originates from to find a cure. After finding a space shuttle left by Pascal's ancestors, the party travel to Fodra where they meet Emeraude, the last remaining human on the desolated planet. Using advanced machinery, Sophie is healed and regains her memories revealing she is a biological humanoid engineered to defeat Lambda, the monster that attacked them in their childhood and is currently possessing Richard. Emeraude helps the party bypass the barrier on the Lastalia where they confront and defeat Richard. Emeraude betrays the party and attempts to absorb Lambda's power but dies in the process. Lambda begins to fuse with the Lastalia causing the party to see his memories and learn about his suffering caused by humanity. The party defeats the materialized Lambda; Since Lambda can not be killed by normal means, Sophie intends to sacrifice herself to kill him. Instead, Asbel absorbs and convinces Lambda to let him show humanity's worth. Lambda agrees before falling <b>into</b> <b>a</b> <b>deep</b> <b>sleep.</b>|$|E
5|$|The dragon man was {{believed}} to act similar to the mythological dragon: {{as soon as he}} saw bad weather approaching, which he knew was brought by an ala, he would leave whatever he was doing, and fly up to confront the demon. This he did by falling <b>into</b> <b>a</b> <b>deep</b> <b>sleep,</b> or entering a state similar to death, usually at the very spot where he happened to be at that time. His soul then left his body in the form of a snake or a lizard, and soared skywards. It was claimed that he was not breathing as long as his soul was absent from his body. The battle could last for a whole day, or even for several days, during which time the man lay unconscious, sweating profusely from the exertion of the fight. There was a danger that, during the course of the battle, the ala might approach the man's body and harm him, which could be prevented by someone swinging a blade above him, or by sticking the blade at the lying man's head. He should not be pushed or moved while in this state: if he was not in the same position as when he fell asleep, his soul would not be able to return into his body, and he would die. When he woke up after the battle with the ala, he was very tired. Apart from these characteristics, the dragon man was seen as an ordinary human.|$|E

They crucially needed help from their deity, but Sseth was not answering prayers in his slumber. So for aid in their endeavors some of the sarrukh made a bargain with the Mulhorandi deity Set, that put Sseth <b>into</b> <b>a</b> <b>deeper</b> <b>sleep</b> but allowed Set to assume Sseth's mantle and grant the sauroids their aid.

By the above reckoning, 28 or 29,000 still hang to Fermor, or float vaporously round him; with Friedrich, in his two lines, are some 18,000:--in whole, 46,000 tired mortals {{sleeping}} thereabouts; near 12,000 others have fallen <b>into</b> <b>a</b> <b>deeper</b> <b>sleep,</b> not liable to be disturbed;--and of the wounded on the field, one shudders to imagine.|$|R
5|$|In {{a similar}} legend from the Klickitats, {{there was a}} large inland sea between the Cascades and the Rocky Mountains. The Native Americans lived on the sea and each year they would hold two large powwows at Mount Multnomah, one in the spring and one in the fall. The demigod Koyoda Spielei lived among them and settled {{disputes}} among the living things of the earth, including the mountains Pa-toe (Adams) and Yi-east (Hood), sons of the Great Spirit Soclai Tyee. For many years, peace prevailed over the land. Then a beautiful squaw mountain moved to the valley between Pa-toe and Yi-east. She fell in love with Yi-east, but liked to flirt with Pa-toe. This caused the two mountains to quarrel with each other and it quickly escalated into an all out brawl. Ignoring Koyoda’s calls for peace, they belched forth smoke and ash and threw hot rocks at each other. Some time later, they paused for a rest and discovered the catastrophe they had caused. The forests and meadows had been burnt to the ground and many animals and other living things had been killed. The earth had been shaken so severely that a hole had been created in the mountains and the sea had drained away and the Bridge of the Gods was formed. The squaw mountain had hid herself in a cave during the battle and because they could no longer find her, they were about to resume fighting. However, while they had been fighting, Koyoda went to Soclai and told him what was happening. Soclai arrived in time to stop them from resuming their quarrel. He decreed that the squaw mountain should remain in the cave forever and the Bridge of the Gods was to be a covenant of peace between the mountains that he would cause to fall if they ever resumed their quarrel. He also placed an ugly old woman, known as Loo-wit, as a mountain to guard the bridge and remind the brothers that beauty is never permanent. After many years, the signs of the great battle and the evidence of the inland sea had disappeared and there was happiness and contentment over the earth. The squaw mountain wished to come out of her cave and grew very lonely. In an effort to ease her loneliness, Soclai sent the Bats, a tribe of beautiful birds, to be her companions. Yi-east eventually learned that the Bats were her guardians and carried out secret communication with the squaw mountain through them. He befriended Loo-wit and crossed the bridge at night to meet with the squaw mountain. One night, he stayed too long and had to hurry to get back to his proper place. He caused the ground to shake so much in his haste that a large rock fell and blocked the entrance to the cave. When Soclai found this, he was furious with the Bats and punished them by turning them into bats that are seen today. He allowed the squaw mountain to remain out of the cave on her promise to be good, but would not allow her and Yi-east to be married, fearing the inevitable quarrel that might start again. He did promise to look for a mate for Pa-toe, hoping this would initiate a lasting peace. However, because of his many duties, he forgot this promise and the two mountains were only held in check by his threats. Eventually, when Soclai was {{in another part of the}} world, they resumed their quarrel and created chaos again. Their violence broke the Bridge of the Gods and destroyed the landscape again. Loo-wit, in her attempts to stop the two brothers, was badly burned and scarred; and when the bridge collapsed, she fell with it. Finally, Pa-toe won the battle and Yi-east admitted defeat. Soclai returned from where he had been, but he was too late to avert the disaster. He found Loo-wit and because she had been faithful in her guardianship, he rewarded her by giving her her greatest desire, youth and beauty. Having received this gift, she moved to the west side of the Cascades and remains there to this day as Mount St. Helens. Since Pa-toe won the battle, the squaw mountain belonged to him. She was heart broken, but took her place at his side. She soon fell at his feet and <b>into</b> <b>a</b> <b>deep</b> <b>sleep</b> from which she never awoke. She is now known as Sleeping Beauty. Pa-toe became so sad that he caused her deep sleep, he lowered his own head in remorse.|$|E

In alternative fashion, cats with similarly placed interruptions to ascending auditory and somatic pathways exhibited normal sleeping and wakefulness, and could be awakened with somatic stimuli. Because these external stimuli would be blocked by the interruptions, this indicated that the ascending transmission must travel through the newly discovered ARAS.|$|E

25|$|When {{a person}} drinks the Draught of Living Death, they go <b>into</b> <b>a</b> <b>deep</b> <b>sleep</b> {{so strong that}} {{they appear to be}} dead, hence the name. It is made from {{powdered}} root of asphodel which is added to an infusion of wormwood, and was first mentioned in Harry's first potions lesson with Snape in Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone. It was later mentioned in his first Potions lesson with Horace Slughorn in Half-Blood Prince when Harry receives top marks in Horace Slughorn's first NEWT (Nastily Exhausting Wizarding Tests) Potions class for brewing this potion so well, having used the handwritten advice in the Half-Blood Prince's book. He is then awarded a small bottle of the potion Felix Felicis as a prize. This potion is described as changing in colour during the process of being made. It has a texture and consistency akin to that of clear water. A process of examining the potency of the potion is to drop a new or fresh leaf in it – the leaf is instantaneously reduced to ashes.|$|E
25|$|Among {{the guests}} are three fairies, Flora, Fauna, and Merryweather, {{who have come}} to bless the child with gifts. Flora and Fauna give their gifts of beauty and song, respectively. Before Merryweather is able to give her blessing, the evil fairy Maleficent appears, only to be told that she was not invited. Maleficent turns to leave, but when Queen Leah asks if she's offended, the evil fairy curses the princess, proclaiming that Aurora will grow in grace and beauty, but before the sun sets on her sixteenth birthday, she will use her finger to touch the spindle of a {{spinning}} wheel and die. King Stefan and Queen Leah are horrified and beg the fairies to break the curse. Unfortunately, they are not strong enough to break it, but Merryweather uses her blessing to soften the curse so that instead of dying, Aurora will fall <b>into</b> <b>a</b> <b>deep</b> <b>sleep</b> from which she can only be awakened by true love's kiss. King Stefan, still fearful for his daughter's life, orders all spinning wheels in the kingdom to be burned. The fairies do not believe that will be enough to keep Aurora safe, and so they spirit her away to a woodcutter's cottage in the forest until the day of her sixteenth birthday.|$|E

50|$|The idiom {{is used in}} {{everyday}} language also {{as a way of}} saying that a person may be refreshed by such a sleep.

Tintin has, however, chosen the hour of their death to {{coincide}} with a solar eclipse, and with a little play-acting, the terrified Incas believe that Tintin can command the Sun. The Inca prince implores Tintin to make the Sun show its light again. At Tintin's command, the Sun returns, and the three are quickly set free. Afterwards, the Prince of the Sun tells them that the seven crystal balls used on the Sanders-Hardiman expedition members, who had excavated Rascar Capac's tomb, contained a [...] "mystic liquid" [...] obtained from coca that plunged them <b>into</b> <b>a</b> <b>deep</b> <b>sleep.</b> Each time the Inca high priest cast his spell over seven wax figures of the explorers, he could use them as he willed as punishment for their sacrilege. Tintin convinces the Inca prince that the explorers wished only to make known to the world the splendours of their civilisation. The Inca prince orders Chiquito to destroy the wax figures, and at that moment in Europe the seven explorers awaken. After swearing an oath to keep the temple's existence a secret, Tintin, Haddock and Calculus head home, while Zorrino remains with the Inca, having accepted an offer to live among them.|$|E
500|$|Alucard {{appears in}} the sequel [...] as a {{supporting}} character. Since the game takes place centuries later, Alucard's personality and standing towards his father has drastically changed. He believes that Dracula can still be redeemed and makes it his goal to free the world from tyranny and vanquish the evil that had corrupted him and his father. He concocts a centuries spanning plan to put his father <b>into</b> <b>a</b> <b>deep</b> <b>sleep</b> by piercing his heart with the Crissaegrim sword, {{in order to make}} both the lord of the dead, Zobek and Satan himself, believe that Dracula is dead, so they can come out in the open. Once they do, Alucard would remove the sword so Dracula can resurrect and then destroy Zobek and Satan for good. Dracula agrees with his son's plan and awakens centuries later during modern times. Throughout the game Alucard also appears as a younger Trevor Belmont and guides Dracula through his Castle to help him recover his old powers and missing memories. In order to not draw suspicion to his plan, Alucard masquerades himself as Zobek's Lieutenant and eventually reveals his true identity to his father once he remembers their pact. They destroy Zobek and Satan and appear to be on good terms in the end. Alucard is also the protagonist of the DLC Revelations, taking place shortly prior to the events of the game.|$|E

5|$|Emus {{begin to}} settle down at sunset and sleep during the night. They do not sleep {{continuously}} but rouse themselves {{several times during the}} night. When falling asleep, emus first squat on their tarsi and enter a drowsy state during which they are alert enough to react to stimuli and quickly return to a fully awakened state if disturbed. <b>As</b> they fall <b>into</b> <b>deeper</b> <b>sleep,</b> their neck droops closer to the body and the eyelids begin to close. If there are no disturbances, they fall <b>into</b> <b>a</b> <b>deeper</b> <b>sleep</b> after about twenty minutes. During this phase, the body is gradually lowered until it is touching the ground with the legs folded underneath. The beak is turned down so that the whole neck becomes S-shaped and folded onto itself. The feathers direct any rain downwards onto the ground. It has been suggested that the sleeping position is a type of camouflage, mimicking a small mound. Emus typically awake from <b>deep</b> <b>sleep</b> once every ninety minutes or so and stand upright to feed briefly or defecate. This period of wakefulness lasts for ten to twenty minutes, after which they return to slumber. Overall, an emu sleeps for around seven hours in each twenty-four-hour period. Young emus usually sleep with their neck flat and stretched forward along the ground surface.|$|R
