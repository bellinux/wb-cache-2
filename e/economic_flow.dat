50|$|When natural {{cracks and}} pores {{do not allow}} <b>economic</b> <b>flow</b> rates, the {{permeability}} can be enhanced by pumping high-pressure cold water down an injection well into the rock. The injection increases the fluid pressure in the naturally fractured rock, triggering shear events that enhance the system's permeability. As long as the injection pressure is maintained, a high matrix permeability is not required, nor are hydraulic fracturing proppants required to maintain the fractures in an open state. This process is termed hydro-shearing, perhaps to differentiate it from hydraulic tensile fracturing, used in {{the oil and gas}} industry, which can create new fractures through the rock in addition to expanding the existing fractures.|$|E

50|$|Employing {{air-to-ground}} precision-guided munitions {{in support}} of a no-drive zone is an extremely challenging effort. Moving vehicles present a difficult target for fighter aircraft as they can stop or turn compounding the targeting solution calculation or travel into areas where unacceptable collateral damage may occur after targeting and weapon release. The anticipated rules of engagement would likely include notification to the friendly or supported forces that no vehicles should be allowed to enter the zone as all vehicles detected in the zone will be considered as suspected hostile. Vehicles detected in the zone may be subjected to the Find, Fix, Track, Target, Engage, and Assess (F2T2EA) process by warfighters or engaged immediately per free-fire zone tactics.

40|$|Is world-systems {{analysis}} of any relevance to present-day <b>economic</b> <b>flows?</b> By using methods {{in line with}} the world-system and dependence theories, we show that <b>economic</b> <b>flows</b> - trade and foreign direct investment - still deeply separate core and peripheries. On the one hand, through the {{analysis of}} the trade by products, we show that core countries hold on to a higher position in the international division of labour. On the other hand, by using network method, we highlight that core countries are still characterized by the intensity of their reciprocal relations while peripheral countries have few economic relations with a limited number of core countries. Moreover, the article demonstrates that this core-periphery division of the world has not lost its pertinence; it is as relevant as {{at the end of the}} sixties. In the current era of globalization, <b>economic</b> <b>flows</b> are still deeply structured by basic power relations between core and peripheries. However, the article also develops a theoretical framework to understand dynamics of the world-system and insists on the emergence of Eastern Asia as a new core area, notably by showing the rising position of some East Asian countries in the international division of labour. We conclude by underlying the necessity to integrate world-system and global network theoretical frameworks. © The authors 2012 Geografiska Annaler: Series B © 2012 Swedish Society for Anthropology and Geography.

A linear correlation between drug amount and peak area was established for O-(β-hydroxyethyl) rutosides in the range of 0. 01 – 200 µg/mL with a detection limit of 0. 001 µg/mL (s/n= 3).

30|$|Although the {{conventional}} hydrocarbon reservoirs are playing {{the most important}} role in meeting the energy demand of the today’s world, this role will be degraded in a few next decades because of dramatic development of unconventional reservoirs.

According to the United States government gas policy in the 1970 s, a tight gas reservoir is one with gas flow permeability less than 0.1 mD.

30|$|However, history {{proves that}} the global power is not forever the same one. Wallerstein‘s Modern World System (MWS) theory pointed out that {{before the arrival of}} the {{nation-state}} political system in early modern Europe, the international system had been characterized by successive world empires. The world-empire was a centralized political unit that guaranteed <b>economic</b> <b>flow</b> from the periphery to the centre by force and by monopolistic advantages in trade (Wallerstein 1974). Similar to MWS, Modelski’s long cycle theory also showed the entrances and exits of different world powers since about 1500. The global leaders were often chosen by the wars though it may not always be the necessary condition for selecting the future leader (Modelski 1987). According to Gerbier, the unavoidable decline of the IDE is attributed to both internal and external reasons. Via outward investment and exports, the IDE transferred the technology to the other countries that benefited their development. Besides, the IDE’s higher resource distribution on the military made its capacity to maintain the competitiveness in civil economy into question (Gerbier 2007). The international relationships are built on the process of fight and competition for “global leader” between the uneven and diverse state economies.|$|E
