40|$|Some of our {{research}} efforts towards building Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) systems designed to work in real-world conditions are presented. The methods we propose exhibit improved performance in noisy environments and offer robustness against speaker variability. Advanced nonlinear signal processing techniques, modulation- and chaotic-based, are utilized for auditory feature extraction. The auditory features are complemented with visual speech cues from the speaker’s face, in scenarios where a video stream captured by a simple <b>image-capturing</b> <b>device</b> is available. Speaker adaptation is achieved at the signal level by exploiting certain characteristics of the speech signal which depend on the physical properties of the vocal tract. The proposed methods are overall evaluated on noisy and audiovisual speech databases, i. e. AURORA and CUAVE, and compare favorably to conventional speech recognition systems...|$|E
40|$|Abstract—A large-area, flexible, and {{lightweight}} sheet image scanner {{has been}} successfully manufactured on a plastic film by integrating high-quality organic transistors and organic photode-tectors. The effective sensing area of the integrated device is 5 5 cm 2; the resolution, 36 dots per inch (dpi); and {{the total number of}} sensor cells, 5184. The pentacene transistors with top contact geometry have a channel length of 18 m and mobility of 0. 7 cm 2 Vs. Organic photodetectors composed of copper phthalo-cyanine and 3, 4, 9, 10 -perylene-tetracarboxylic-diimide distinguish between black and white parts on paper based on the difference in their reflectivity. Since this new area-type <b>image-capturing</b> <b>device</b> does not require any optics or mechanical scanning de-vices, the present sheet image scanners are mechanically flexible, lightweight, shock resistant, and potentially inexpensive to man-ufacture; therefore, they are suitable for human-friendly mobile electronics.

30|$|Since {{digital cameras}} have become inexpensive, {{people have been}} {{capturing}} {{a large number of}} images in everyday life. These images are often affected by atmospheric changes [1], the poor quality of the <b>image-capturing</b> <b>devices,</b> the lack of operator expertise, etc. In many cases, these images might demand enhancement for making them more acceptable to the common people. Furthermore, image enhancement is needed because of its wide range of application in areas such as atmospheric sciences [2], astrophotography [3], medical image processing [4], satellite image analysis [5], texture analysis and synthesis [6], remote sensing [7], digital photography, surveillance [8], and video processing applications [9].|$|R
40|$|Multidimensional {{aesthetics}} in photomedia practice {{shift the}} emphasis {{away from the}} culturally dominating singularity of the camera's eye-piece towards a supple interplay of semi-transparent image planes and shifting positions. Using various <b>image-capture</b> <b>devices</b> that can produce digital, film, still or moving pictures, I create bodies of work that invite the viewer to see many perspectives simultaneously. The challenge is to implement {{the effectiveness of the}} technologies and simultaneously dislodge those principles and values fundamental to their imperialist cultural backgrounds. My practice investigates a diplomatic negotiability of aesthetic language to accommodate conceptual and cultural difference/s. Located on the print surface or in animated sequences are symbolic representations that disclose histories, cultures, times and places in subtle and ambiguous ways. The interplay of allure and resistance, repetition and change, are strategies that reveal the delicate and paradoxical nature of the multidimensional psyche...|$|R
40|$|This book {{examines}} paintings using a computational {{and quantitative}} approach. Specifically, it compares paintings to photographs, addressing {{the strengths and}} limitations of both. Particular aesthetic practices are examined such as the vista, foreground to background organisation and the depth planes. These are analysed using a range of computational approaches and clear observations are made. New generations of <b>image-capture</b> <b>devices</b> such as Google goggles and the light field camera, promise {{a future in which}} the formal attributes of a photograph are made available for editing to a degree that has hitherto been the exclusive territory of painting. In this sense paintings and photographs are converging, and it therefore seems an opportune time to study the comparisons between them. In this context, the book includes cutting-edge work examining how some of the aesthetic attributes of a painting can be transferred to a photograph using the latest computational approaches...|$|R
30|$|Due to the {{limitations}} of <b>image-capturing</b> <b>devices</b> or {{the presence of a}} non-ideal environment, the quality of digital images may get degraded. In spite of much advancement in imaging science, captured images do not always fulfill users’ expectations of clear and soothing views. Most of the existing methods mainly focus on either global or local enhancement that might not be suitable for all types of images. These methods do not consider the nature of the image, whereas different types of degraded images may demand different types of treatments. Hence, we classify images into several classes based on the statistical information of the respective images. Afterwards, an adaptive gamma correction (AGC) is proposed to appropriately enhance the contrast of the image where the parameters of AGC are set dynamically based on the image information. Extensive experiments along with qualitative and quantitative evaluations show that the performance of AGC is better than other state-of-the-art techniques.|$|R
40|$|In recent years, reading {{text from}} natural images has gained renewed {{research}} attention. One {{of the main}} reasons for this is the rapid growth of camera-based applications on smart phones and other portable devices. With the increasing availability of high performance, low-priced, <b>image-capturing</b> <b>devices,</b> the application of scene text recognition is rapidly expanding and becoming increasingly popular. Despite many efforts, character recognition in natural images, is still considered a challenging and unresolved problem. The difficulties stem from the fact that natural images suffer {{from a wide variety of}} obstacles such as complex backgrounds, font variation, uneven illumination, resolution problems, occlusions, perspective effects, just to mention a few. This paper aims to test the accuracy of OCR in character recognition of natural images as well as testing the possible improvement in accuracy after implementing three different segmentation methods. The results showed that the accuracy of OCR was very poor and no improvments in accuracy were found after implementing the chosen segmentation methods...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: A {{wide range}} of {{consumer}} electronics has been developed that {{have the capability to}} capture images such as digital imaging devices like digital cameras and camcorders. In order to assist a user in easily taking high-quality images, many digital <b>image-capturing</b> <b>devices</b> support various scene-modes that are accessible by a means of buttons, dials, or menus. So to overcome this disadvantage the proposed method Voice based Image transfer to USB using ARM 7 involves various aspects such as the hardware platform like LPC 2148 (ARM 7). Indeed, such a voice-driven scene-mode recommendation has several benefits. It reduces the number of actions required for a user to activate a scene-mode. The system is designed by using ARM 32 -bit Microcontroller which supports features of transferring the data to a removable drive by recognizing the voice. The prototype performs the tasks of opening an image, selecting a particular image and copying that image to a particular drive by recognizing a voice and the scene related image share opened and copied to USB with the recognition of voice using voice recognition kit...|$|R
40|$|The {{study of}} {{ecological}} and behavioral processes has been revolutionized {{in the last}} two decades with the rapid development of biologging-science. Recently, using <b>image-capturing</b> <b>devices,</b> some pilot studies demonstrated the potential of understanding marine vertebrate movement patterns in relation to their proximate, as opposed to remote sensed environmental contexts. Here, using miniaturized video cameras and GPS tracking recorders simultaneously, we show for the first time that information on the immediate visual surroundings of a foraging seabird, the Cape gannet, is fundamental in understanding the origins of its movement patterns. We found that movement patterns were related to specific stimuli which were mostly other predators such as gannets, dolphins or fishing boats. Contrary to a widely accepted idea, our data suggest that foraging seabirds are not directly looking for prey. Instead, they search for indicators of the presence of prey, the latter being targeted at the very last moment and at a very small scale. We demonstrate that movement patterns of foraging seabirds can be heavily driven by processes unobservable with conventional methodology. Except perhaps for large scale processes, local-enhancement seems to be the only ruling mechanism; this has profound...|$|R
40|$|Traditional image {{processing}} {{is a field}} {{of science and technology}} developed to facilitate human-centered image management. But today, when huge volumes of visual data inundate our surroundings (due to the explosive growth of <b>image-capturing</b> <b>devices,</b> proliferation of Internet communication means and video sharing services over the World Wide Web), human-centered handling of Big-data flows is impossible anymore. Therefore, it has to be replaced with a machine (computer) supported counterpart. Of course, such an artificial counterpart must be equipped with some cognitive abilities, usually characteristic for a human being. Indeed, in the past decade, a new computer design trend - Cognitive Computer development - is become visible. Cognitive {{image processing}} definitely will be one of its main duties. It must be specially mentioned that this trend is a particular case of a much more general movement - the transition from a "computational data-processing paradigm" to a "cognitive information-processing paradigm", which affects today many fields of science, technology, and engineering. This transition is a blessed novelty, but its success is hampered by the lack of a clear delimitation between the notion of data and the notion of information. Elaborating the case of cognitive image processing, the paper intends to clarify these important research issues...|$|R
40|$|Moisture {{content is}} one of {{important}} soil characteristics in agricultural systems and is often needed to determine other soil characteristics. Gravimetric method is widely used to measure soil moisture content. Although the result is quite accurate, however it is very time consuming. In this research, soil moisture content of arid field has been analyzed by image processing method using webcam and infrared webcam as the <b>image-captured</b> <b>devices.</b> This research aimed to estimate soil moisture content from images captured by webcam and infrared webcam and to define the most appropriate visual properties as the soil moisture content prediction parameter. Soil samples used in this research was from arid field of Gunung Tugel Village Banyumas Regency. Thirty samples of arid field soils were collected using soil ring samplers in 5 cm of soil depth. All samples were wetted until they reached a saturated condition. After that, the samples were stored for 30 days under room temperature condition until the soils became dry. Everyday the weight of each soil was measured and the images were captured by using webcam and infrared webcam. The images were then extracted by using image processing to obtain visual parameters such as RGB index as well as HSI colour and texture feature. Each of the visual parameters was then determined its correlation with soil moisture content and the R 2 of the correlations. The final step of the analysis was calculating the mean percentage error (MPE) of the moisture content estimation. A visual parameter which has the least MPE would {{be used as the}} prediction parameter. The results of this research showed that soil moisture content of arid field could be predicted by using visual parameters from images captured by webcam and infrared webcam. Intensity of the soil images captured by infrared webcam resulted prediction error lower than that by webcam...|$|R
