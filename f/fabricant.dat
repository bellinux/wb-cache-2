500|$|According to Robert Mahony, the Drapier's Letters, {{especially}} the fourth, were later praised by Irish nationalists. However, as he continued, many recent critics have re-examined this nationalistic claim and asserted a counterclaim that Swift is speaking {{more for the}} Protestants of Ireland than for the entire nation. Many critics, including Carol <b>Fabricant,</b> have asked who [...] "the Whole People of Ireland" [...] are, [...] "who" [...] the Drapier's Letters are speaking [...] "to", and if Swift has the right, as a Protestant Englishman, {{to speak for the}} entire nation. R. F. Foster believes that Swift represented [...] "Ascendancy attitudes," [...] but this view is not held by all. Some critics, like Joep Leerssen, believe that Swift's work contributed greatly to a common Irish nationalism regardless of religious affiliation, and that Swift was able to relate to all of Ireland through a unified suffering under the British rule. In overall effect, <b>Fabricant</b> argued that Swift's ability to speak for the whole populace is further suggested by the wide consensus opposed to the coinage plan. Along with this, Swift was able to rhetorically extend natural rights, in the Drapier's Letters, to all people of Ireland without any regard to restriction.|$|E

Bletcher arrives, letting Catherine know that her daughter Jordan is safe outside with a colleague of his. He searches the house for the intruder, finding Butler instead.
