This system caught the attention of Samuel Randlett and Robert Harbin, who added a few symbols such as “rotate” and “zoom in”, and then adopted it as the standard. The Yoshizawa-Randlett system was first described in Samuel Randlett's Art of Origami in 1961. It was then accepted as the default throughout the international origami community, and is still in general use today.|$|R

30|$|Regions X 1, X 2, and X 4 {{have high}} resistivities with values more than 100 Ωm. For these cases, changes in RMS misfits were {{examined}} by replacing {{the data for}} the regions with a conductive body. Region X 3, which has low resistivities with values less than 10 Ωm, was replaced with a resistive body. Figure 5 b shows the RMS misfits when a 10 - Ωm body was substituted for X 1, X 2, and X 4 and a 100 - Ωm body was substituted for X 3. The horizontal axis indicates the altitude of the uppermost part of the replacing body. The RMS misfits increase with the elevation of the substitute bodies, except in region X 4 where there was no significant increase of the RMS misfit, suggesting that region X 4 has little sensitivity. The change of TM phase at site 001 (Figure 5 c) shows that the calculated sounding curve does not fit well within 3 to 7 Hz at an altitude of - 0.54 km, as the RMS misfit is approximately 1.06. This is indicated by the <b>dotted</b> <b>and</b> <b>dashed</b> <b>line</b> in Figure 5 b. Thus, RMS misfits greater than 1.06 indicate significant discrepancies from the best-fit model. We thus concluded that computational blocks with sensitivities of at least 10 − 4.5 can be supported by the observed data.|$|R
40|$|A Distributed Switch {{is a set}} of FCDFs {{associated}} with at least one Controlling Switch, that controls the operations of the set of FCDFs. Figure 42 shows an example of Distributed Switch composed of a Controlling Switch and two FCDFs. From an external point of view (i. e., outside the <b>dotted</b> <b>and</b> <b>dashed</b> black <b>line</b> in figure 42), a Distribut-ed Switch behaves as a Fibre Channel Switch. In particular, a Distributed Switch supports the instan-tiation of N_Port to F_Port links and of E_Port to E_Port links (ISLs). N_Port to F_Port links are supported by both FCDFs and Controlling Switches, while ISLs are supported only by Controlling Switches. This means {{that it is possible to}} connect a Distributed Switch to another Switch only through a Controlling Switch, not through an FCDF. From an internal point of view (i. e., inside the <b>dotted</b> <b>and</b> <b>dashed</b> black <b>line</b> in figure 42), A_Port to A_Port links (ASLs) enable FC frames forwarding between Controlling Switch and FCDFs, as well as between FCDFs. ASLs are also used to exchange control information between Controlling Switch and FCDFs. The Controlling Switch uses one or more Virtual Domain_IDs Domain_ID to perform N_Port_ID allo-cations for N_Ports connected to the FCDF Set FCDFs of the Distributed Switch (i. e., a Virtual Domain_ID is used as the most significant byte in the N_Port_IDs allocated to N_Ports that are at-tached to an FCDF of the FCDF SetDistributed Switch). The Controlling Switch uses also another Domain_ID, called Principal Domain, for its normal functions as a Fibre Channel Switch. As a result, a Distributed Switch such as the one shown in figure 42 uses at least two Domain_IDs: one for the Principal Domain and one or more for the Virtual Domain.

METAPOST provides extra primitives {{that can be used}} for this task, but the method presented here can be used for both METAFONT and METAPOST. Introduction Knuth's METAFONT has powerful facilities for manipulating and drawing curves or `paths'.

However, METAFONT is also very well suited to producing technical diagrams; for this secondary purpose, METAFONT lacks a valuable facility [...] -that of drawing evenly <b>dotted</b> <b>and</b> <b>dashed</b> curves. In this paper we show how to remedy this shortcoming, using the facilities that METAFONT does have available.

30|$|The results {{shown in}} Figs.  14 and 15 are {{compared}} to the experimental data reported by Tanniru et al. [6]. These authors [6] reported the PCI curve at 350  °C and the microstructural evolution of the samples (Mg- 10 at% Al) during the measurements. However, they [6] could not identify the plateau pressures directly from the PCI curve because of the sloped and not well-defined plateaus resulting from the poor kinetics {{in addition to the}} small amount of hydrogen absorbed (below the theoretical capacity of the sample). For these reasons, a direct comparison between the calculated and the measured PCIs [6] is not possible. Nevertheless, the calculated plateau pressures are compared to those identified by Tanniru et al. [6]. Three hydriding steps corresponding to three plateaus at 6.2, 12.7, and 22  bar have been reported [6]. These results [6] are in very good agreement with the current calculations shown in Fig.  14 except for the calculated plateau pressure at 13.5  bar, which was not observed by these authors. This {{can be attributed to the}} small difference of pressure with the preceding step (12.8  bar) and the small length of the plateau in addition to the poor quality of the curve. Also, microstructural analysis and phase identification at different stages of hydriding/dehydriding experiments reported by Tanniru et al. [6] are in good agreement with this work. However, these authors [6] did not report the formation step of Al 30 Mg 23 and therefore they combined the two-step hydriding reaction: (γ to Al 30 Mg 23  + MgH 2 at 12.8  bar and Al 30 Mg 23 to β + MgH 2 at 13.5  bar) in only one step: (γ to β + MgH 2 at 12.7  bar). In Fig.  15, the amounts of Al and Mg in each phase are presented by <b>dotted</b> <b>and</b> <b>dashed</b> <b>lines,</b> respectively, with the same color as the phase. It can be seen in Fig.  15 that from a pressure of 6.26 and 12.8  bar, the alloy is composed of γ phase and MgH 2 and the amount of MgH 2 increases gradually in this pressure range, while the amount of Mg in the γ phase decreases and the amount of Al in the γ phase is constant, which signifies that the γ phase is more concentrated in Al. This step takes the form of a curved line in PCI curves (the enlarged inset in Fig.  14) and is due to the large solubility range of the γ phase. Bouaricha et al. [54] reported that the PCI curves of Mg–Al alloys with γ phase compositions showed sloped plateau between 8 and 15  bar, which is consistent with the trend of the PCIs calculated in this work. It can be concluded that the PCI inclined plateaus reported in the literature [46] for the Al–Mg alloys, is, in addition to kinetic factors, due to the large solubility range of the γ phase, short plateaus’ length, and the small differences between the last three plateau pressures.|$|R
40|$|Photonic Networks (PNs) {{enable the}} scaling of fiber-optic {{communications}} to massive capacity by dynamically routing wavelengths (λs) without O-E-O conversion at network nodes. As shown in Fig. 1, the key network elements are ROADMs (reconfigurable optical add/drop modules), which can extract and/or insert wavelengths to/from local transceivers into a wavelength multiplex section traveling along a fiber route, and WXCs (wavelength crossconnects), which can interconnect individual wavelengths among multiplex sections traveling {{in two or}} more fiber routes. Typically, WXC nodes will also incorporate local add/drop function, and the links will be bidirectional on pairs of unidirectional fibers. Such PNs are beginning to be widely deployed, driven largely by the reduced capital cost of electronics. Looking forward, ability to provide dynamic services and easy channel upgrades due to format transparency will be additional advantages. To operate large PNs successfully we will need a suite of new management tools that support dynamic wavelength routing. The tools must promote no-touch provisioning, adaptive fault tolerance, and intelligent performance monitoring with prediction of impending failures, all in a challenging environment of sparse O-E-O locations. In [1], we introduced an {{example of such a}} tool, a digital lightpath labeling system that we call LightLabel.
