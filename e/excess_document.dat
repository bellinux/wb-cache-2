40|$|Objective. To {{evaluate}} {{the association between}} <b>documenting</b> <b>excess</b> weight and ordering screening tests. Methods. We retrospectively reviewed well-child visits for patients 2 to 18 years old at a pediatric resident clinic. We evaluated visits of patients with body mass index ≥ 85 th percentile for documentation of excess weight in the electronic medical record (EMR) and screening tests ordered. Associations were investigated with χ 2 tests. Results. Of 522 patients, 215 (41 %) were overweight (19 %) or obese (22 %). Among obese and overweight patients, 92 / 215 (43 %) had documentation of excess weight in the EMR. Screening tests were ordered for 39 / 92 (42 %) patients with a diagnosis of excess weight versus 8 / 123 (6. 5 %) of those without one (P <. 001). Conclusions. Documentation rates of excess weight by practitioners were low and worse for younger children and those with milder degrees of <b>excess</b> weight. <b>Documenting</b> <b>excess</b> weight in the EMR was highly associated with ordering of screening tests...|$|R
40|$|Disequilibria between 210 Pb and 226 Ra {{can be used}} {{to trace}} magma degassing, because the {{intermediate}} nuclides, particularly 222 Rn, are volatile. Products of the 1980 - 1986 eruptions of Mount St. Helens have been analysed for (210 Pb/ 226 Ra). Both excesses and deficits of 210 Pb are encountered suggesting rapid gas transfer. The time scale of diffuse, non-eruptive gas escape prior to 1980 as documented by 210 Pb deficits is on the order of a decade using the model developed by Gauthier and Condomines (Earth Planet. Sci. Lett. 172 (1999) 111 - 126) for a non-renewed magma chamber and efficient Rn removal. The time required to build-up 210 Pb excess is much shorter (months) as can be observed from steady increases of (210 Pb/ 226 Ra) with time during 1980 - 1982. The formation of 210 Pb excess requires both rapid gas transport through the magma and periodic blocking of gas escape routes. Superposed on this time trend is the natural variability of (210 Pb/ 226 Ra) in a single eruption caused by tapping magma from various depths. The two time scales of gas transport, to create both 210 Pb deficits and 210 Pb excesses, cannot be reconciled in a single event. Rather 210 Pb deficits are associated with pre-eruptive diffuse degassing, while 210 Pb <b>excesses</b> <b>document</b> the more vigorous degassing associated with eruption and recharge of the system. © 2006 Elsevier B.

40|$|Previous {{empirical}} studies have documented that equity prices react to announcements of unexpected dividend changes. The most promising hypothesis forwarded {{as an explanation}} of this phenomenon is the dividend signalling hypothesis. Building on a foundation of dividend signalling models, this study employs an expanded set of explanatory variables to explain <b>excess</b> returns <b>documented</b> around dividend announcements. This set includes variables found in previous studies {{to have an impact}} on excess returns around dividend announcements, as well as other variables considered by some to be important (but previously untested) determinants of equity price movements. ^ This study utilizes a cross-sectional regression approach to extend the traditional event study methodology and temper the effects of the limitations of residual analysis. This approach is used to examine the cross-sectional variation in excess returns around dividend announcements with a set of explanatory variables which represent firm-specific characteristics and information available to investors at the time of the dividend announcement. Furthermore, this approach allows us to actually test whether the unexpected dividend change is the only influence on the announcement day excess returns or if there are other factors which explain these excess returns. ^ This study has several empirical findings which expand our present knowledge about the factors that influence excess returns around dividend announcements. First, the key assumption of residual analysis is violated. The cross-sectional variation in excess returns does not average out even after the sample of firms is screened using the strictest procedures outlined in previous studies. Second, there are other variables along with the unexpected dividend change that significantly explain the cross-sectional differences in the excess returns. These results suggest that previous dividend studies using residual analysis which <b>document</b> <b>excess</b> returns around announcements of unexpected dividend changes have erred by attributing all the excess return to the unexpected dividend change alone. ...|$|R

40|$|We {{present a}} simple {{agent-based}} model {{to study how}} the proximate triggering factor of a crash or a rally might relate to its fundamental mechanism, and vice versa. Our agents form opinions and invest, based on three sources of information, (i) public information, i. e. news, (ii) information from their “friendship” network, promoting imitation and (iii) private information. Agents use Bayesian learning to adapt their strategy according to the past relevance of the three sources of information. We find that rallies and crashes occur as amplifications of random lucky or unlucky streak of news, due to the feedback of these news on the agents’ strategies into collective transient herding regimes. These ingredients provide a simple mechanism for the <b>excess</b> volatility <b>documented</b> in financial markets. Paradoxically, it is the attempt for investors to learn the level of relevance of the news on the price formation {{which leads to a}} dramatic amplification of the price volatility due to their collective search for the “truth”. A positive feedback loop is created by the two dominating mechanisms (Bayesian learning and imitation) which, by reinforcing each other, result in rallies and crashes. The model offers a simple reconciliation of the two opposite (herding versus fundamental) proposals for the origin of crashes within a single framework and justifies the existence of two populations in the distribution of returns, exemplifying the concept that rallies and crashes are qualitatively {{different from the rest of}} the price moves. stock market, crash, rallies, bubble, herding, news...|$|R

Patients with pheochromocytomas detected by screening presented with less complaints of diaphoresis (P < 0. 01), palpitations (P= 0. 01), paleness (P= 0. 01), nausea (P < 0. 01), and vomiting (P= 0. 01) compared with patients with symptomatic pheochromocytomas.

40|$|Abstract. If long {{maturity}} {{bonds are}} traded frequently and traders have non-nested in-formation sets, speculative {{behavior in the}} sense of Harrison and Kreps (1978) arises. Using a term structure model displaying such speculative behavior, this paper proposes an empir-ically plausible re-interpretation of predictable excess returns that is not based on the value traders attach to a marginal increase of wealth in different states of the world. Applying the properties of orthogonal projections, it is demonstrated that individual traders can system-atically predict excess returns even in a model with a constant price of risk if information sets are non-nested. We also show that a three factor no-arbitrage factor model would find overwhelming but misleading evidence in favor of a time varying price of risk if the world is characterized by the model presented here. We further argue that the “hidden ” factor that help predict <b>excess</b> returns as <b>documented</b> by Duffee (2008) is an intrinsic feature of models with imperfectly informed traders. The model is estimated using monthly data on US short to medium term Treasuries from 1964 to 2007. It provides a good fit of the data and demonstrates that it is feasible to estimate dynamic models with privately informed agents. 1...|$|R

The number of observed studies (O) with statistically significant results (P 0. 05 threshold) was compared with the expected number (E) under different assumptions for the magnitude of the effect size. In the main analysis, the plausible effect size of each association was the summary effect presented in the respective meta-analysis. Overall, 19 meta-analyses (all with eventually nonsignificant summary effects) had a <b>documented</b> <b>excess</b> ofO over E: Typically single studies had significant effects pointing in opposite directions and early summary effects were dissipated over time.

For case studies, we visited Japanese companies of furniture design in Fukuoka city to evaluate the current storage system in their workplace. So based on observation, hearing, taking pictures of storage units and making questionnaire for workers, the following are the major findings resulting from this study. The main problems of storage system were related to the desk space and its files organization:- 1 - There is not enough space available for working on the desk top because files are piled up on it. 2 - Worker couldn’t sit well because files are stacked under their desks. 3 - Workers could not deal with their client speedily, furthermore loose of work time because they could not find the file which they need when they need it easily. The first problem is attributable to the following reasons:-A- Filing management is not adequate because it is restricted by following a certain rule for keeping files. B- Personal style which means the way of thinking for organizing documents within the desk space is different from one worker to the other. C- Desk space is inefficient for an <b>excess</b> number of <b>documents.</b> D- Workers have no enough time for organizing and maintaining documents regularly.

40|$|AbstractPurposeThe {{reasons why}} the {{mortality}} of patients with epilepsy is significantly increased, even many years after seizure onset, are not fully understood. The {{aim of this study}} was to compare the distribution of the causes of death (COD) in an epilepsy population with that in the general population and with previous findings in other epilepsy populations. In addition, we investigated the chronological relationship between the onset of epilepsy and the onset of the diseases leading to death. MethodsThe COD for patients who were registered with a diagnosis of epilepsy at Stavanger University Hospital from August 1 1995 –July 31 2005 and died during the same period were obtained from the Norwegian Cause of Death Registry and the hospital records were reviewed. The distribution of the corresponding COD in the general population was obtained from Statistics Norway. ResultsAt least 6. 8 % (18 / 266) of the deaths of epilepsy patients were directly related to seizures. Epilepsy patients who had died from brain tumors (n= 46) were excluded from further analysis. Of the remaining 220 deceased epilepsy patients, 39 (17. 7 %) had died from heart disease, compared with 27. 8 % in the general population (p< 0. 001). No other significant differences in the distribution of COD in the epilepsy population and the general population were identified. The majority of the epilepsy patients who died from heart disease (71. 8 %) and cerebrovascular disease (72 %) had cardiovascular disease prior to seizure onset and in at least 43 % of those who died from neoplasms the onset of malignancy occurred before the first seizure. ConclusionComorbid diseases and underlying conditions were the major determinants of mortality in this population of epilepsy patients.

40|$|BACKGROUND: Suicide claims {{over one}} million lives {{worldwide}} each year. In the United States, 1 per 10, 000 persons dies from suicide every year, and these rates have remained relatively constant over the last 20 years. There are nearly 25 suicide attempts for each suicide, and previous self-directed violence is a strong predictor of death from suicide. While many {{studies have focused on}} suicides, the epidemiology of non-fatal self-directed violence is not well-defined. OBJECTIVE: We used a nationally representative survey to examine demographics and underlying psychiatric disorders in United States (US) hospitalizations with non-fatal self-directed violence (SDV). METHOD: International Classification of Disease, 9 (th) Revision (ICD- 9) discharge diagnosis data from the National Hospital Discharge Survey (NHDS) were examined from 1997 to 2006 using frequency measures and adjusted logistic regression. RESULTS: The rate of discharges with SDV remained relatively stable over the study time period with 4. 5 to 5. 7 hospitalizations per 10, 000 persons per year. <b>Excess</b> SDV was <b>documented</b> for females, adolescents, whites, and those from the Midwest or West. While females had a higher likelihood of self-poisoning, both genders had comparable proportions of hospitalizations with SDV resulting in injury. Over 86 % of the records listing SDV also included psychiatric disorders, with the most frequent being affective (57. 8 %) and substance abuse (37. 1 %) disorders. The association between psychiatric disorders and self-injury was strongest for personality disorders for both males (OR = 2. 1; 95 % CI = 1. 3 - 3. 4) and females (OR = 3. 8; 95 % CI = 2. 7 - 5. 3). CONCLUSION: The NHDS provides new insights into the demographics and psychiatric morbidity of those hospitalized with SDV.

40|$|Three meta-analyses have {{recently}} been reported {{on the relationship between}} choice of resuscitation fluid and risk of mortality in critically ill patients. The relative risk of death (1. 16 - 1. 19) in two of the meta-analyses was slightly higher in colloid than crystalloid recipients; however, this observation was not statistically significant. In the third meta-analysis, 6 % (95 % confidence interval [CI], 3 - 9 %) pooled <b>excess</b> mortality was <b>documented</b> in patients receiving albumin for hypovolaemia, burns or hypoalbuminaemia. The mortality difference in hypovolaemia patients (4 %; 95 % CI, 0 - 8 %) was not statistically significant. A variety of serious limitations apply to the three meta-analyses, suggesting that their findings be interpreted cautiously. More than one-half of the randomized controlled trials (RCTs) included in the meta-analyses were reported prior to 1990 and hence do not reflect current practice. Each meta-analysis included only a subset of relevant RCTs, and therefore the scope of inferences to be drawn from the meta-analytic results is limited. The meta-analyses combined RCTs that were notably heterogeneous with respect to patient characteristics, type of illness, administered fluids and physiologic endpoints. Differences in illness severity, concomitant therapies and fluid management approaches were not taken into account. Very few of the RCTs were blinded. The meta-analyses do not support the conclusion that choice of resuscitation fluid is a major determinant of mortality in critically ill patients, nor do they support changes to current fluid management practice. Changes such as exclusive reliance on crystalloids would necessitate a reassessment of the goals and methods of fluid therapy. Since the effect on mortality may be minimal or non-existent, choice of resuscitation fluid should rest on whether the particular fluid permits the intensive care unit to provide better patient care...|$|R
40|$|With {{the advent}} of massive genetic technologies, several {{thousand}} human genome epidemiology studies are published every year investigating the relationship between common genetic variants and diverse phenotypes. Transparent reporting of study methods and results allows readers to better assess the validity of study findings. In this thesis, we aimed to evaluate the reporting practices of human genome epidemiology studies along with the excess of statistically significant results in studies of genetic associations with Alzheimer’s disease reflecting either bias or between-study heterogeneity. Articles {{were randomly selected from}} a continuously updated database of human genome epidemiology association studies to be representative of genetic epidemiology literature. The main analysis evaluated 315 articles published in 2001 - 2003. For a comparative update, we evaluated 28 more recent articles published in 2006, focusing on issues that were poorly reported in 2001 - 2003. In a second phase, we analyzed all genetic association studies of Alzheimer’s disease entered into the comprehensive AlzGene database until 31 / 1 / 2007 (1, 348 studies in 315 meta-analyses). The number of observed (O) studies with statistically siginificant results (P= 0. 05 threshold) was compared with the expected (E) number under differenet assumptions for the magnitude of the effect size. In the main analysis, the plausible effect size was the summary effect presented in the respective meta-analysis. During both time periods, most studies comprised relatively small study populations. Articles were inconsistent in reporting the data needed to assess selection bias, and the methods to minimize misclassification (of genotypes, phenotypes) or to identify population stratification. Statistical power, the use of unrelated study participants and the use of replicate samples were reported more often in articles published during 2006. Overall, 19 meta-analyses (all with eventually non-significant results) had a <b>documented</b> <b>excess</b> of significant findings. Typically, sinlge studies had significant effects pointing in opposite directions and early summary effects were dissipated over time. Across the whole domain, O was 235 (17. 4 %), while E was 164. 8 (12. 2 %) (p< 10 - 6). The excess showed a predilection for meta-analyses with non-significant summary effects and between-study heterogeneity. The excess was seen for all levels of statistical significance and also for studies with borderline p values (0. 05 - 0. 10). We conclude that many items needed to assess error and bias in human genome epidemiology association studies are not consistenly reported. Although some improvements were seen over time, reporting guidelines may help enhance the transparency of this literature. Finally, the excess of significant findings may represent significance-chasing biases in a setting of massive testing. ...|$|R
40|$|Correspondence {{issued by}} the Government Accountability Office with an {{abstract}} that begins "The Department of Defense (DOD) spends {{billions of dollars to}} purchase, manage, store, track, and deliver spare parts and other supplies needed to keep military equipment ready and operating. Given the need to support ongoing U. S. military operations, DOD reported that it currently manages more than 4 million secondary inventory items valued at more than $ 91 billion as of September 2009. However, DOD reported that $ 10. 3 billion (11 percent) of its secondary inventory has been designated as excess and categorized for potential reuse or disposal. According to DOD, another $ 15. 2 billion (17 percent) of its secondary inventory exceeds the approved acquisition objective and is being retained because it was determined to be more economical to retain than to dispose of it or it might be needed in the future. Since 1990, we have identified DOD supply chain management as a high-risk area due in part to ineffective and inefficient inventory management practices and procedures, weaknesses in accurately forecasting demand for spare parts, and challenges in achieving widespread implementation of key technologies aimed at improving asset visibility. These factors have contributed to the accumulation {{of billions of dollars in}} spare parts that are excess to current requirements. Moreover, we have recently reported on the inventory management practices of the military departments and the Defense Logistics Agency (DLA) and recommended DOD take steps to improve demand forecasting, modify policies to provide incentives to reduce on-order inventory that is not needed to support requirements (i. e., on-order <b>excess),</b> ensure proper, <b>documented</b> reviews are conducted to validate methodologies for making retention decisions, and establish metrics and goals for tracking and assessing the cost efficiency of inventory management. To provide high-level strategic direction, DOD issued its Logistics Strategic Plan in July 2010, which, among other things, established a goal to improve supply chain processes, including inventory management practices. Section 328 of the National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA) for Fiscal Year 2010 requires us to submit to the congressional defense committees an assessment of the extent to which the Plan meets the specified requirements no later than 60 days after the Plan's submission. Our objectives were to (1) determine the extent to which DOD's Plan addresses the reporting elements required by section 328 of the NDAA and (2) assess the extent to which the Plan addresses six key characteristics that help establish a comprehensive, results-oriented management framework to guide implementation. These characteristics were not required to be included by section 328, but our prior work examining national strategies and logistic issues has shown that these characteristics help establish a results-oriented management framework for effective implementation. ...|$|R
