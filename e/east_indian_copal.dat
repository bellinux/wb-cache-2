The {{purpose of this study was}} to study self- disclosure with a focus on the difference between <b>East</b> <b>Indians</b> and non <b>East</b> <b>Indians.</b> The present study examined whether a sample of 76 second generation <b>East</b> <b>Indian</b> Americans living in the United States scored lower than 81 non <b>East</b> <b>Indians</b> on the revised Magno Self Disclosure questionnaire. It was also examined if <b>East</b> <b>Indians</b> who scored higher on the Suinn Lew Self Identity Acculturation scale would score higher on the Magno Self Disclosure scale. <b>East</b> <b>Indian</b> participants did score significantly lower on the measure of self-disclosure than non <b>East</b> <b>Indians</b> and <b>East</b> <b>Indians</b> who scored higher on the self-disclosure measure scored significantly higher on acculturation to Western United States practices. Results indicate that <b>East</b> <b>Indians</b> tend to self-disclose less information than non <b>East</b> <b>Indians,</b> but those who are more acculturated disclose more, indicating their practices more closely follow American groups cultural and social norms...|$|R

5000|$|Although {{the release}} of King of Suriname {{presented}} a breakthrough for <b>East</b> <b>Indian</b> music, it was quite short lived, as few artists managed to succeed Ramdew Chaitoe {{in the years to}} follow. It was not until the 1960s that another Surinamese would catapult <b>East</b> <b>Indian</b> music onto the scene once again. In 1968, a woman by the name of Dropati debuted with an album of traditional wedding songs, titled, Lets Sing & Dance. Once again, although religious in nature, Dropati's songs, much like those of Ramdew Chaitoe, went on to become huge pop hits within the <b>East</b> <b>Indian</b> community. Dropati's epic songs such as [...] "Gowri Pooja" [...] and [...] "Lawa" [...] became such big hits that they firmly secured her name in history as one of the pillars of Indo-Caribbean music (Dropati, 1993). Lets Sing & Dance along with King of Suriname remain two of the best selling <b>East</b> <b>Indian</b> albums of all time, even to this day (Ramdew Chaitoe, 1993). The effects of {{the release of}} these two albums were tremendous. Not only did they prove <b>East</b> <b>Indian</b> music as a legitimate art form, but they also united the <b>East</b> <b>Indians</b> of the Caribbean regardless of whether they were Guyanese, Trinidadian, Jamaican or Surinamese. However, these two albums also showed the need for a more popular, non-religious form of <b>East</b> <b>Indian</b> music, one that would combine the high pitched dholak, dhantal & tassa drum beats with the folk and Hindi lyrics that made Lets Sing & Dance and King of Suriname/The Star Melodies Of Ramdew Chaitoe becoming so popular. http://www.saxakali.com/caribbean/Hemchandra1.htm.|$|R
