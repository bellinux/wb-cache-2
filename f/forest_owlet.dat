In November 1997, Rasmussen and Ben King of the American Museum of Natural History spent ten days unsuccessfully searching two east Indian locations before driving west {{to the site of}} another old specimen, where King spotted a small, chunky owl with short, heavily white-feathered legs and huge claws, which Rasmussen confirmed as the target species whilst the owl was videotaped and photographed.|$|E

50|$|Here, a high {{diversity}} of species of forest birds {{is the main}} attraction for ecotourism. About 155 species of birds are found including common grey hornbill, grey-fronted green pigeon, yellow backed sunbird, Malabar trogon, jungle babbler, <b>forest</b> spotted <b>owlet,</b> shama, great Indian black woodpecker, are found. Apart from this, {{there are a variety}} of insects, centipedes, millipedes and snails. There are about 121 species of spider including the largest species in Gujarat the giant wood spider.|$|R
50|$|Literature on {{historical}} records of birdlife {{of the region}} is very scanty. Forsyth's (1889) casual remarks indicated that several species like black-headed yellow bulbul (Pycnonotus melanicterus), painted spurfowl (Galloperdix lunulata), lesser adjutant (Leptoptilos javanicus), and Indian golden-backed three-toed woodpecker (Dinopium javanense) which are now found only in small restricted areas were apparently quite common and widespread around late 19th century. The recent rediscovery of the <b>forest</b> spotted <b>owlet</b> (Heteroglaux blewitti), endemic to Central Indian Highlands after about 114 years (Rasmussen 1998), underscores the significance of more avifaunal studies in the region for conservation planning. The forests of central India are {{also one of the}} few known refuges for several globally threatened and restricted-range species like Malabar pied hornbill (Anthracoceros coronatus), spotted grey creeper (Salpornis spilonotus), white-bellied minivet (Pericrocotus erythropygius), Asian brown flycatcher (Muscicapa dauurica) and green munia (Amandava formosa) (Ali & Ripley, 1983). A recent survey on breeding birds of Central Indian Highlands by Wildlife Institute of India (Jayapal et al., 2005) has added several new breeding records and range-extensions like crested goshawk (Accipiter trivirgatus), Oriental scops owl (Otus sunia), spot-bellied eagle owl (Bubo nipalensis), drongo-cuckoo (Surniculus lugubris), ashy drongo (Dicrurus leucophaeus), and striated grassbird (Megalurus palustris).|$|R

50|$|The Central Indian Forests {{have been}} defined by BirdLife International as an Endemic Bird Area as it {{includes}} {{the range of the}} critically endangered <b>forest</b> <b>owlet.</b> It includes the southern region of Madhya Pradesh, the Vidarbha region of Maharashtra and Chhattisgarh. This forest consists of dry deciduous trees. Many wildlife sanctuaries and national parks are within these forests. For example: Kanha National Park, Pench National Park and Melghat wildlife sanctuary. The <b>forest</b> <b>owlet</b> was thought to be extinct but was rediscovered in Melghat.|$|E

50|$|The <b>forest</b> <b>owlet</b> {{is small}} (23 cm) and stocky. It {{is a typical}} owlet with a rather unspotted crown and heavily banded wings and tail. They have a {{relatively}} large skull and beak. Unlike the spotted owlet, the <b>forest</b> <b>owlet</b> has the fewer and fainter spots on the crown and back. The upperparts are dark grey-brown. The upper breast is almost solid brown and the sides are barred with a white central wedge in the lower breast that is sometimes unmarked, especially in males. The primaries are darker and distinct. The wings and tail are banded with white trailing edges. A dark carpal patch on the underwing visible in flight. The facial disc is pale and the eyes are yellow.|$|E
50|$|The <b>forest</b> <b>owlet</b> remains {{critically}} endangered, and {{the population}} in 2015 was estimated by Birdlife International at less than 250. It is thought that this owl has always been rare. The original specimens were collected in dense jungle, and the recent sightings in more open forest may represent suboptimal habitat. The forest in the plains in its range has been totally cleared, and there is pressure on the remaining forest resources.|$|E
50|$|The <b>forest</b> <b>owlet</b> was {{recorded}} in central India, and known until 1997, from just seven specimens in museums collected in northern Maharashtra, and south-east Madhya Pradesh or western Orissa. The last record until then {{was based on a}} specimen claimed from Gujarat in 1914 by Richard Meinertzhagen. Searches in Gujarat had been futile until the species was rediscovered in November 1997 by a group of American ornithologists, including Pamela C. Rasmussen, rediscovered the species {{in the foothills of the}} Satpura Range, north-east of Bombay. The cause of the earlier failed searches was due to the resubmission of a stolen specimen with the falsification of locality data.|$|E

50|$|The <b>forest</b> <b>owlet</b> (Athene blewitti) is an owl that is {{endemic to}} {{the forests of}} central India. This bird {{is on the verge}} of extinction. This species belongs to the typical owls family, Strigidae. After it was {{described}} in 1873 and it was not seen after 1884 and considered extinct until it was rediscovered 113 years later in 1997 by Pamela Rasmussen. Searches for the species in the locality given in the label of the last collected specimen failed and it was discovered that the specimen had been stolen from the British Museum by Richard Meinertzhagen and resubmitted with a label bearing false locality information. It is known from a small number of localities and the populations are very low within the fragmented and shrinking forests of central India, leaving the species critically endangered.|$|E
50|$|Rasmussen {{described}} {{four new}} Asian bird species from {{her study of}} museum specimens. The Nicobar scops owl Otus alius, the Sangihe scops owl Otus collari, and the cinnabar hawk owl Ninox ios, a Sulawesi endemic,all in 1998, and the Taiwan bush-warbler Bradypterus alishanensis in 2000. She rediscovered the <b>forest</b> <b>owlet</b> Athene blewitti, which had not been seen since 1884, in western India, previous searches by S.

50|$|Hussain {{was born}} in Karkala, near Mangalore (then {{a part of the}} Madras Presidency) where his father was a noted lawyer. His early {{education}} was at Basti Mission School and obtained a university degree in science from Sri Bhuvanendra College at Karkala. He applied for a field research position in the Bird Migration study project of the Bombay Natural History Society and although he had no formal education in zoology, Salim Ali found him very observant and accepted him. Hussain accompanied Ali on numerous expeditions and later conducted surveys on his own. Hussain became assistant curator of the BNHS in 1979, a senior scientist from 1985 to 1990 and then a deputy director of research until 1992. He later moved to Malaysia where he headed the Asian Wetland Bureau. He was also briefly the vice-chairman of BirdLife International. In 1974, he was part of a group that went in search of the <b>forest</b> <b>owlet</b> at a locality falsely claimed by Richard Meinertzhagen.|$|E
50|$|In the 1990s, an {{analysis}} of Meinertzhagen's bird collection at the Walter Rothschild Zoological Museum in Tring, Hertfordshire, revealed large-scale fraud involving theft and falsification. The birds claimed as specimens collected by Meinhertzhagen matched with the ones that had been reported missing and {{the examination of the}} style of specimen preparation and the DNA sequences of the cotton used inside them matched the cotton used in other specimens prepared by the collectors of the stolen specimens. This also corroborated hear-say and other evidence on the specimen fraud. Many of the specimens that he submitted as his own were found to be missing samples belonging to the Natural History Museum and collected by others, such as Hugh Whistler. A species of owl, the <b>forest</b> <b>owlet</b> thought to have gone extinct was rediscovered in 1997 based on searches made in the locality where the original specimens were collected. Searches for the bird had failed before as these were made in a locality falsely claimed by Meinertzhagen. More research by Rasmussen and Robert Prŷs-Jones indicates the fraud was even more extensive than first thought.|$|E
40|$|Little {{is known}} about the {{distribution}} of the endemic <b>forest</b> <b>owlet</b> Heteroglaux Blewitti in India. Its presence has been always dubious in the past in Gujarat.

40|$|The <b>Forest</b> <b>Owlet</b> Athene blewitti is {{considered}} to be critically endangered and at an extremely high risk of extinction. It was recently rediscovered after 113 years and little is known about this endemic species, which has a very limited distribution in central India.
