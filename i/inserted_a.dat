5|$|The {{practice}} of placing prayer {{notes in the}} Western Wall has also been adopted by Christian pilgrims and people of other faiths. Foreign dignitaries who have publicly placed a kvitel in the Western Wall include Pope John Paul II in 2000, U.S. Senator Hillary Clinton in 2005, Pope Benedict XVI in 2008, U.S. presidential candidate Barack Obama in 2008, and U.S. presidential candidate Mitt Romney and his wife Ann in 2012. Pope Francis <b>inserted</b> <b>a</b> handwritten Spanish language text of the Lord's Prayer in the Wall during his visit in 2014. On May 22, 2017, Donald Trump became the first sitting U.S. President to visit the Wall; he also <b>inserted</b> <b>a</b> note.|$|E
5|$|A {{powerful}} Senate Select Committee {{oversaw the}} NCDC and renowned British architect Sir William Holford {{was brought in}} to fine-tune Griffin's original plans. He changed the central basin's geometry so that it was no longer a segment of circle; he converted the southern straight edge into a polygonal shape with three edges and <b>inserted</b> <b>a</b> gulf on the northern shore. The result was closer to Scrivener's modified design some decades earlier.|$|E
5|$|Hergé also <b>inserted</b> <b>a</b> cameo of Jacobs {{into the}} story, using {{him as the}} basis for a {{scientist}} that appears on page 40 of Destination Moon, a nod to Jacobs' inclusion of a reference to Hergé in one of his Blake and Mortimer mysteries, The Mystery of the Great Pyramid (1954).|$|E

5|$|Hergé's {{decision}} {{to name a}} character Topolino was a reference to Walt Disney, whose character of Mickey Mouse was known as Topolino in Italian. Hergé included a reference to his friend and colleague, the former opera singer Edgar P. Jacobs, in the story, adding a figure named Jacobini to the billing on the opera performance alongside Castafiore. He also <b>inserted</b> <b>a</b> cameo {{of himself as a}} reporter into the final scene of the story.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile Enver, still {{fearing that}} the Russians {{would accept the}} Ottoman apology, decided to interfere. Just before the message was sent, he <b>inserted</b> <b>a</b> passage that accused the Russians of instigating the conflict. On 1 November the message arrived in Petrograd. Foreign Minister Sazonov responded with an ultimatum, {{demanding}} that the Ottomans expel the German military mission. The Ottomans rejected this proposal.|$|E
5|$|Phidias, who {{had been}} in charge of all {{building}} projects, was first accused of embezzling gold meant for the statue of Athena and then of impiety, because, when he wrought the battle of the Amazons on the shield of Athena, he carved out a figure that suggested himself as a bald old man, and also <b>inserted</b> <b>a</b> very fine likeness of Pericles fighting with an Amazon.|$|E
30|$|Inserting new nodes {{occurs in}} three general cases: <b>inserting</b> <b>a</b> node before the leftmost node, <b>inserting</b> <b>a</b> node after the {{rightmost}} node, and <b>inserting</b> <b>a</b> node between any two nodes at any position.

He <b>inserted</b> <b>a</b> self-portrait into one other work; the lost Justice of Trajan and Herkinbald, known through a tapestry copy in the Historical Museum of Bern. Later northern artists followed his lead, using self-portraits {{in their own}} depictions of Luke.|$|E
5|$|Lynch {{worked with}} Alan Splet {{to design the}} film's sound. The pair {{arranged}} and fabricated soundproof blanketing to insulate their studio, where they spent almost a year creating and editing the film's sound effects. The soundtrack is densely layered, including as many as fifteen different sounds played simultaneously using multiple reels. Sounds were created {{in a variety of}} ways—for a scene in which a bed slowly dissolves into a pool of liquid, Lynch and Splet <b>inserted</b> <b>a</b> microphone inside a plastic bottle, floated it in a bathtub, and recorded the sound of air blown through the bottle. After being recorded, sounds were further augmented by alterations to their pitch, reverb and frequency.|$|E
5|$|The constitutions of {{the cathedral}} chapter at Lichfield are often stated to have been Nonant's work, but this has been disproven. The chronicler Roger of Howden <b>inserted</b> <b>a</b> letter {{supposedly}} by Nonant in his Chronica. This letter was also preserved in other manuscripts, including a section of a manuscript now in the Bodleian Library as manuscript (MS) Additional A.44.

5|$|Walton-based {{building}} firm Kelly Brothers {{were instructed}} to erect two uncovered stands that could each accommodate 4,000 spectators. A third covered stand accommodating 3,000 spectators was also requested. The combined cost of these stands was £1,640. Everton <b>inserted</b> <b>a</b> penalty clause into the contract in case the work was not completed by its 31 July deadline. Everton officials were impressed with the builder's workmanship and agreed two further contracts: exterior hoardings were constructed {{at a cost of}} £150 and 12 turnstiles were installed at a cost of £7 each. In 1894, Benjamin Kelly of Kelly Brothers was appointed as a director of Everton.|$|E
5|$|A public {{announcement}} of the new pieces was made on May 15, 1965, only to be met with a storm of objections. Both the public and many congressmen saw the issue as a poor use of Mint resources {{at a time of}} severe coin shortages, which would only benefit coin dealers. On May 24, one day before a hastily called congressional hearing, Adams announced that the pieces were deemed trial strikes, never intended for circulation. The Mint later stated that 316,076 pieces had been struck; all were reported melted amid heavy security. To ensure {{that there would be no}} repetition, Congress <b>inserted</b> <b>a</b> provision in the Coinage Act of 1965 forbidding the coinage of silver dollars for five years. That act also removed silver from the dime and quarter, and reduced the silver content of the half dollar to 40%.|$|E
5|$|In {{the sixth}} edition Darwin <b>inserted</b> <b>a</b> new chapter VII (renumbering the {{subsequent}} chapters) {{to respond to}} criticisms of earlier editions, including the objection that many features of organisms were not adaptive and {{could not have been}} produced by natural selection. He said some such features could have been by-products of adaptive changes to other features, and that often features seemed non-adaptive because their function was unknown, as shown by his book on Fertilisation of Orchids that explained how their elaborate structures facilitated pollination by insects. Much of the chapter responds to George Jackson Mivart's criticisms, including his claim that features such as baleen filters in whales, flatfish with both eyes {{on one side and the}} camouflage of stick insects could not have evolved through natural selection because intermediate stages would not have been adaptive. Darwin proposed scenarios for the incremental evolution of each feature.|$|E

5|$|One of Irving's most lasting {{contributions}} to American culture {{is in the}} way Americans perceive and celebrate Christmas. In his 1812 revisions to A History of New York, Irving <b>inserted</b> <b>a</b> dream sequence featuring St. Nicholas soaring over treetops in a flying wagon—a creation others would later dress up as Santa Claus. In his five Christmas stories in The Sketch Book, Irving portrayed an idealized celebration of old-fashioned Christmas customs at a quaint English manor, that depicted harmonious warm-hearted English Christmas festivities he experienced while staying in Aston Hall, Birmingham, England, that had largely been abandoned. He used text from The Vindication of Christmas (London 1652) of old English Christmas traditions, he had transcribed into his journal as a format for his stories. The book contributed to the revival and reinterpretation of the Christmas holiday in the United States.|$|E
5|$|The final {{attack on}} 28 February also {{began with a}} mortar attack, but the {{communist}} assault wave was broken up by mortar fire, {{and was forced to}} withdraw to the east. Three Americans were wounded. A clearing patrol later revealed that the Viet Cong had <b>inserted</b> <b>a</b> mortar team {{to the edge of the}} rubber trees by night in a Lambretta and a cart and had then manhandled the tubes into position. 3 RAR's defence of FSB Andersen was the first occasion in the history of their operations in Vietnam that an Australian fire support base had been subjected to a ground assault while during all three attacks the cavalry and artillery in support had played a key role in the defence. Throughout the later part of the operation the patrolling rifle companies had systematically searched the AO and although contact was infrequent the patrols had been effective in denying the subsequent use of the area to launch rocket attacks against the bases in Long Binh and Bien Hoa.|$|E
5|$|The new {{pieces were}} {{publicly}} announced on May 15, 1965, and coin dealers immediately offered $7.50 each for them, ensuring {{that they would}} not circulate. The public announcement prompted a storm of objections. Both the public and many congressmen saw the issue as a poor use of Mint resources during a severe coin shortage, which would only benefit coin dealers. On May 24, one day before a hastily called congressional hearing, Adams announced that the pieces were deemed trial strikes, never intended for circulation. The Mint later stated that 316,076 dollars had been struck; all were reported melted amid heavy security. To ensure {{that there would be no}} repetition, Congress <b>inserted</b> <b>a</b> provision in the Coinage Act of 1965 forbidding the coinage of silver dollars for five years. No 1964-D Peace dollars are known to exist in either public or private hands. Two specimens were discovered in a Treasury vault in 1970 and were destroyed, but rumors and speculation about others in illegal private possession continue to appear from time to time. The issue has also been privately restruck using unofficial dies and genuine, earlier-date Peace dollars resulting in an altered date.|$|E

5|$|The {{story was}} redrawn and colourised in 1947. For this edition, Hergé was {{assisted}} by Edgar Pierre Jacobs, {{an artist who}} worked as part of Studios Hergé. Jacobs oversaw changes to the costumes and background of the story; in the 1938 version, the Syldavian Royal Guards are dressed like British Beefeaters, while the 1947 version has them dressed in a Balkanised uniform. Jacobs also <b>inserted</b> <b>a</b> cameo of himself and {{his wife in the}} Syldavian royal court, while in that same scene is a cameo of Hergé, his then-wife Germaine, his brother Paul, and three of his friend's - Édouard Cnaepelinckx, Jacques Van Melkebeke, and Marcel Stobbaerts. Hergé and Jacobs also inserted further cameos of themselves at the bottom of page 38, where they appear as uniformed officers. While the character of Professor Alembick had been given the forename of Nestor in the original version, this was changed to Hector for the second; this had been done so as to avoid confusion with the character of Nestor, the butler of Marlinspike Hall, whom Hergé had introduced in The Secret of the Unicorn.|$|E
