50|$|The Electron was {{designed}} to be very sparse, with a sizable reduction of living space that was intentionally designed to reduce wind and water resistance. They featured a high enclosed wheelhouse superstructure that Crowhurst abandoned for a flush deck that only allowed for a small rounded “doghouse” for the wheel. Aboard the ship was a table with a screw on vice for small repair work, a Marconi Kestrel radio-telephone, a small built-in table with a red cushioned seat that would have hidden the main computer but instead obscured a tangle of carefully color-coded, but unconnected, wires that hung throughout the cabin. He also had a Racal RA 6217 communications receiver, a Shannon Mar 3 transmitter/receiver, headsets, morse keys, switch panels, and <b>gross</b> <b>amounts</b> of radio spares. Powering the existing electronics on the boat was an Onan petrol-driven generator that was seated under the cockpit where it would be at risk of continuous exposure to water in rough weather, but which was again, done in line with Crowhurst’s fear of capsize. The typical “Victress” cabin also featured built in shelving and cabinetry that Crowhurst replaced with Tupperware plastic containers for storing food, electronic components, a second-hand Bell and Howell 16mm camera and Uher tape recorder that had been provided by the BBC for documenting the journey. The boat also housed a Hasler self-steering system and a Hengist-Horsa wind speed and direction indicator.|$|E

40|$|Results are {{presented}} from campaigns {{carried out in}} March and May 2012 across the main channel of the Vlie Inlet in the western Dutch Wadden Sea. On both occasions current velocities and concentrations of suspended particulate matter (SPM) were measured at six stations over one tidal cycle.

Transport of water and SPM occurs predominantly over the southwestern part of the channel. The tidal prism in the channel varies in the range of 5 – 7 × 108 m 3. <b>Gross</b> <b>amounts</b> of SPM transported during ebb and flood are 6 – 8 × 106 kg during the first campaign, but only half that amount during the second, possibly due to a different wind direction.

40|$|Purpose: To {{demonstrate}} {{the effectiveness of}} conservative treatment modalities utilized to prevent amputation of a patient's lower leg. Clinical Problem: A clinically complex 86 year old black female with diagnoses of diabetes mellitus type II, severe peripheral vascular disease, anemia, low albumin level, ASCAD, CHF, right femoral-popliteal bypass, left eye blindness and degenerative joint disease presented with a non-healing left heel pressure ulcer acquired, November 1997. Initially, the ulcer was an area that had a purplish to black eschar with surrounding erythema. Numerous modalities were utilized without success. In January, a vascular surgeon recommended below knee amputation as the only effective treatment of this wound. The patient requested a more conservative approach to maintain the integrity of her leg.

40|$|Household micro-datasets {{often do}} not contain {{information}} on gross incomes. We present an algorithm which exploits the tax- and contribution rules built into tax-benefit models to convert net income information into <b>gross</b> <b>amounts.</b> Using EUROMOD, a multi-country taxbenefit model covering all fifteen countries of the European Union, net-to-gross conversions can be performed for {{a large number of}} countries utilising existing models of relevant fiscal rules. The algorithm takes into account all relevant complexities of tax- and contribution rules and can, thus, produce much more accurate results than statistical models which estimate netto- gross ratios using only a few explanatory variables. Among the features of the algorithm is the ability to distinguish between different individuals in the same household. Even if individuals’ incomes are taxed jointly, the algorithm is able to approximate separate net-togross factors for individuals in the same fiscal unit. This is possible since EUROMOD can accurately assign people to appropriate fiscal units. In addition, it is in certain cases possible to produce different net-to-gross ratios for different income components. We undertake a case study to illustrate the importance of deriving separate net-to-gross factors for different individuals within a household/fiscal unit and for different income sources of the same individual.

40|$|Lipoteichoic acid (LTA) is a {{component}} of nearly all gram-positive membranes and recently {{has been found to}} be excreted into growth media by certain lactic acid bacteria. Cell-free extracts of LTA are usually contaminated with proteins, polysaccharides, and nucleic acids, thus causing problems to investigators studying the true biological function(s) of LTA. This report describes the preparation of purified extracellular LTA of Streptococcus mutans BHT and intracellular LTA of S. mutans AHT by three techniques: gel filtration, hydrophobic interaction chromatography, and adsorption to phospholipid vesicles. Gel filtration, the most commonly employed method for LTA purification, was found to remove nucleic acids, teichoic acids, and much polysaccharide while greatly concentrating LTA. But <b>gross</b> <b>amounts</b> of antigenic carbohydrate and protein remained associated with the LTA preparation. Hydrophobic interaction chromatography employing octyl Sepharose- 4 B allowed the separation of protein but not polysaccharide from partially purified BHT LTA preparations. By means of a new technique described in this paper, synthetic membranes (vesicles) were found to effectively separate all contaminants from the intracellular (AHT) and extracellular (BHT) LTA of S. mutans. This rapid method, on a comparative basis, proved to be the most effective approach for the purification of LTA from two widely differing sources...|$|E
40|$|The primary {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to establish a production function for alfalfa grown in the Sevier Valley using farm survey data. A secondary objective was to point out the analytical difficulties in establishing a production function for alfalfa. A multiple regression model using 12 linear, 12 nonlinear, and 7 interaction terms was employed. A coefficient of determination of. 70 was obtained for the model. Intercorrelation problems associated with the model limit its usefulness for economic and predictive purposes. The predictive value of the model was greatly increased by reducing the numb er of correlated variables included in the model. The reduction in the number of variables also reduced the coefficient of determinations. Study results indicate that additional research on the correlation structure associated with multiple regression models is necessary. Study results indicate that optimum moisture days and actual consumptive use of moisture are better measures of water use than <b>gross</b> <b>amounts</b> of irrigation water applied. The use of these indicators reduces the number of problems associated with timing of water application and availability of water to plants. Their use would increase the reliability and significance of the evaluation of increments of irrigation water. The optimum use of irrigation water on alfalfa in the Sevier Valley is 40 inches per acre. At this use the net income to the farmer is $ 11. 61 per acre...|$|E

40|$|Monitoring of {{the coastal}} zone is {{necessary}} to assess its vulnerability and help formulate coastal management plans. A predetermined stretch of beach along the northern rim of False Bay known locally as Monwabisi Beach was chosen to compare different monitoring techniques and from the data acquired, see if accurate comment could be made regarding sediment dynamics and its implications regarding any coastal encroachment on anthropogenic infrastructure. Digital elevation models {{of the study area}} were created from data acquired with a mobile laser scanner in April 2013, April 2014 and August 2014, chosen to cover a yearly and a seasonal cycle. Conventional beach profile data were acquired using a differential global positioning system (DGPS) in April 2014 and LiDAR data were acquired in November 2014. From the laser scanning datasets it has been calculated that a nett erosional trend exists for the study area with sediment moving towards the north. In the western portion of the study area, where a coastal road has been undercut and complete failure has occurred, the progress of cliff retreat has been accurately measured to reveal an average rate of retreat of 2. 2 m/yr. Although accurate figures were determined for sediment erosion and accretion, the rate of change of each could not be determined with any degree of confidence as the survey intervals were not regular enough to consider nett amounts; rather the <b>gross</b> <b>amounts</b> have been presented. 1...|$|E
40|$|During {{redesign}} of the Space Shuttle reusable solid rocket motor (RSRM), NASA amended {{the contract with}} ATK Launch Systems (then Morton Thiokol Inc.) with Change Order 966 to implement a contamination control and cleanliness verification method. The change order required: (1) A quantitative inspection method (2) A written record of actual contamination levels versus a known reject level (3) A method that is more sensitive than existing methods of visual and black light inspection. Black light inspection is only useful for inspection of contaminants that fluoresce near the 365 nm spectral line and is not useful for inspection of most silicones that will not produce strong fluorescence. Black light inspection conducted by a qualified inspector under controlled light is capable of detecting Conoco HD- 2 grease in <b>gross</b> <b>amounts</b> and is very subjective due to operator sensitivity. Optically stimulated electron emission (OSEE), developed at the Materials and Process Laboratory at Marshall Space Flight Center (MSFC), was selected to satisfy Change Order 966. OSEE offers several important advantages over existing laboratory methods with similar sensitivity, e. g., spectroscopy and nonvolatile residue sampling, which provide turn around time, real time capability, and full coverage inspection capability. Laboratory methods require sample gathering and in-lab analysis, which sometimes takes several days to get results. This is not practical in a production environment. In addition, these methods do not offer full coverage inspection of the large component...|$|E
40|$|The present {{radiographic}} {{and clinical}} survey {{was performed to}} study the prevalence of "incipient juvenile periodontitis" in a population of 16 -year old adolescents in Switzerland. The subjects to be screened were {{selected on the basis}} of the population distribution in the year 1980 in the territory of Switzerland. 7 % of all 16 -year old adolescents proportionally distributed into the different ethnic groups of Switzerland were incorporated in the study. From the school dental systems, a total of 7604 pairs of bite-wing radiographs were obtained and evaluated for fillings and iatrogenic factors, <b>gross</b> <b>amounts</b> of calculus, resorption of alveolar bone. A diagnosis of "incipient juveline periodontitis" was given if the clinical criteria of this disorder proposed by Baer were met. In 7142 pairs of bite-wing radiographs, such a diagnosis was attributed to 7 female and 12 male patients. Subsequently, they were asked if they would be examined at the University of Berne School of Dental Medicine. On the basis of history, a complete periodontal chart and full mouth radiographs, the diagnosis was confirmed or refuted. 8 patients (4 female and 4 male) were definitely diagnosed as "incipient juvenile periodontitis". This resulted in a prevalence of 0. 1 % with a ratio of female to male of 1 : 1 in the country of Switzerland at age 16.
