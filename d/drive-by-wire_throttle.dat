25|$|The {{engines are}} {{aluminium}} alloy units, with advanced torque-based engine management system, <b>drive-by-wire</b> <b>throttle</b> control, and variable camshaft phasing (on the 4.4-litre version).|$|E
25|$|Mechanically, the 2005 {{model was}} also changed. A major change {{included}} a <b>drive-by-wire</b> <b>throttle</b> for all CR-Vs. The all-wheel drive system was improved; {{it had been}} tuned to activate faster in low traction situations. US market models were equipped with a five-speed automatic, {{as opposed to the}} previous four-speed automatic.|$|E
25|$|For {{the model}} year 2000, a new 5-speed {{automatic}} transmission with adaptive shift logic was introduced. It was only available on non turbo front-wheel drive models and the 2000 V70 R AWD. All 10V engines were dropped {{and replaced by}} detuned 20V versions. <b>Drive-by-wire</b> <b>throttle</b> was now also introduced for non turbo models.|$|E
25|$|Other {{features}} {{included a}} <b>drive-by-wire</b> electronic <b>throttle,</b> a five-speed automatic transmission, anti-lock brakes with electronic brake-force distribution and brake assist {{as well as}} electronic stability and traction control systems. The fourth-generation Lexus ES was built in Kyūshū and Toyota, Aichi, Japan.|$|R
50|$|The second-generation Almera was {{available}} in three different body styles, a three- or five-door hatch and a four-door saloon with 1.5 and 1.8 Nissan QG engine series petrol engines {{as well as a}} 2.2 direct injection turbodiesel (110 bhp) (YD22DDT) or common-rail turbodiesel (136 bhp) (YD22DDTi). Almeras can be also equipped with 1.5 common-rail turbodiesel (dCi) from the Renault Megane II - Nissan had recently ventured with Renault and the Almera's diesel engine {{was one of the first}} instances of Nissan and Renaults sharing mechanicals. Early versions of the 1.5-litre engine were fitted with a mechanical throttle, which was later replaced by a <b>drive-by-wire</b> electronic <b>throttle.</b>|$|R
25|$|Although the 200Tdi engine {{had been}} an undoubted {{technological}} and sales success, it had certain limitations and flaws {{that needed to be}} rectified. Despite the numerous differences, it was still in essence a direct-injection version of the older Diesel Turbo engine. It was also considered rather raucous and unrefined, especially for use in the Discovery and Range Rover models. A special version of the engine had to be produced to fit the Defender, and problems with weak head gasket had been identified. The British Army (and some other military buyers) had not opted for the 200Tdi because it could not be fitted with a 24-volt generator for powering radio equipment- instead the Army continued to buy vehicles with 2.5-litre naturally aspirated diesels. Upcoming European diesel emissions regulations (Euro I) meant that Land Rover would be forced to radically alter the engine anyway. The resulting development project (coded Romulus) produced the 300Tdi engine. Although externally very similar to the Discovery/Range Rover version of its predecessor, 208 changes were made. These included modifications to the block, cylinder head, fuel injector system and ancillary systems. The crankshaft, pistons and connecting rods were significantly altered over the 200Tdi. The most obvious external changes were the fitting of a rubber acoustic cover over the engine to reduce noise and the change to a single serpentine belt to drive the ancillaries instead of the multiple V-belts of the older engines. Emissions regulation included the fitting of an exhaust gas recirculation system. Power and torque outputs remained the same, and the engine had been specifically designed to be compatible with all the models in the Land Rover range without any changes. This meant that the Defender engines were fitted in the same tune as the Discovery/Range Rover engines. The 300Tdi was noticeably smoother and quieter than the 200Tdi, but was generally found to not be quite as economical in real-world use. It turned out that the Euro I emissions regulations were not as severe as Land Rover anticipated, and so the 300Tdi was able to remain in production until the introduction of the Euro III rules. When fitted to vehicles with an automatic transmission, power was increased to 122 horsepower {{to make up for the}} power losses in the transmission. These engines (designated 23L) had Bosch Electronic Diesel Control systems, where the mechanical injector system was controlled by a <b>drive-by-wire</b> electronic <b>throttle</b> to reduce emissions. The 300Tdi was replaced in 1998 by the 5-cylinder Td5, bringing to an end the line of Land Rover 4-cylinder engines that can be traced back to 1957. The Td5 engine was loosely based on the Rover Group's L-series diesel engine. The 300Tdi remained in production in Brazil, and was offered as an option on rest of world (non-UK/Europe) models. Following Ford's acquisition of Land Rover in 2000, the engine was used in Brazilian-built Ford pick-up trucks as well. Increasing emissions laws worldwide and falling sales led to production of the 300Tdi ending in 2006. A much-modified 2.8-litre version was built by International Engines in Brazil until 2010, and was available as an after-market fitment to Land Rovers through specialist converters. International then became MWM International Motores and a further update of the 300Tdi design was launched as the 3.0 Power Stroke. Although based around the same block and basic architecture as the 300Tdi the Power Stroke has major differences such as electronic common rail injection and new crossflow cylinder head with Overhead camshaft.|$|R
25|$|For {{model year}} 1999 a minor {{facelift}} was introduced. Apart from very minor cosmetic changes like the square XC-style roof rails replacing the rounded version {{and a slightly}} changed logo for the front grill, it concentrated on the mechanicals. Volvo introduced dual stage frontal airbag deployment logic and its second generation side airbag which was increased in volume to offer better protection. WHIPS was also introduced {{as part of the}} standard equipment. New engine management systems with <b>drive-by-wire</b> <b>throttle</b> replaced the mechanical throttle on turbo models and an upgraded traction control now called STC was introduced. The ABS was upgraded from a three-channel to a four-channel system, while all-wheel drive models received thicker rear discs and redesigned rear calipers. The 4-speed automatic transmissions were upgraded to adaptive shift logic.|$|E
2500|$|The E46 M3 {{was offered}} with a {{standard}} 6-speed Getrag transmission, but optionally came with a SMG drivelogic transmission (also known as the SMG II). [...] The engine had a redline of 8,000 rpm.

50|$|For {{model year}} 2000 a new 5-speed {{automatic}} transmission with adaptive shift-logic was introduced. It was only available on non turbo front-wheel drive models. The 10V engine variants were dropped {{and replaced by}} detuned 20V versions, <b>drive-by-wire</b> <b>throttle</b> was now also introduced for non turbo models.|$|E
50|$|European 1.8 L and 2.0 L Duratec HE {{engines are}} {{built at the}} Valencia Engine Plant in Spain. Duratec FFV is a flex fuel version of the 1.8 L Duratec-HE {{modified}} to run on E85 fuel. 1.8L Focus C-Max and Focus Mk II versions use a <b>drive-by-wire</b> <b>throttle</b> to improve responsiveness.|$|E

5000|$|For {{drive-by-wire}} automobiles, a brake-accelerator interlock switch, or [...] "smart throttle" [...] {{would eliminate}} {{or at least}} curtail any instance of unintended acceleration not a result of pedal misapplication by causing the brake to override the throttle. An unintended acceleration event would require the failure of such a mechanism if it were present. Such a solution would not be applicable to older vehicles lacking a <b>drive-by-wire</b> <b>throttle.</b>|$|E
50|$|For the 2015 model year, the Tiger 800 used {{a second}} {{generation}} 800 cc engine with <b>drive-by-wire</b> <b>throttle</b> which Triumph claimed improved fuel economy by 17%. Traction control was also added. Optional {{versions of the}} Tiger 800 included various combinations of cruise control, auto-cancel indicators, an advanced trip computer, multiple driving modes. Hardware in some versions included engine-protection bars, an aluminum sump guard, a center stand, WP suspension, and which included adjustable front forks.|$|E
50|$|In {{addition}} all the 3.0L models VG, VX and VZ trim {{come with}} illuminated steering button cruise control, dual large exhaust pipe, V6 logo, VCM (variable cylinder management engine), active engine mount to reduce vibration, active noise control, twin silencer and DBW (<b>drive-by-wire)</b> <b>throttle</b> control. This DBW system when {{used with the}} cruise control can help save fuel as the ECU will calculate the most efficient fuel vs speed in oppose to self-drive.|$|E
50|$|The 8 Series {{offered the}} first V-12 engine mated to a 6-speed manual gearbox {{on a road}} car. It was the first car to feature CAN bus—a form of {{multiplex}} wiring for cars that is now an industry standard. It {{was also one of}} the first vehicles to be fitted with an electronic <b>drive-by-wire</b> <b>throttle.</b> The 8 Series was one of BMW's first cars, together with the Z1, to use a multi-link rear axle.|$|E
5000|$|On February 8, 2011, the NHTSA, in {{collaboration}} with NASA, released its findings into the investigation on the Toyota <b>drive-by-wire</b> <b>throttle</b> system. After a 10-month search, NASA and NHTSA scientists found no electronic defect in Toyota vehicles. Driver error or pedal misapplication was found {{responsible for most of}} the incidents. The report ended stating, [...] "Our conclusion is Toyota's problems were mechanical, not electrical." [...] This included sticking accelerator pedals, and pedals caught under floor mats.|$|E
50|$|The E46 M3 {{was offered}} with a {{standard}} 6-speed Getrag transmission, but optionally came with a SMG drivelogic transmission (also known as the SMG II). This is the standard 6-speed Getrag transmission with an electrohydraulically actuated clutch (no clutch pedal). Shifts are made via the SMG gear knob or the steering wheel mounted paddle shifters. The engine had a redline of 8,000 rpm. As with most M engines, the S54 again had 6 independent throttle bodies and this time electronically operated throttles (<b>drive-by-wire</b> <b>throttle</b> with no cable).|$|E
5000|$|The first-generation RL was {{powered by}} a 225 hp (168 kW) 90° C-series V6 non-VTEC engine. The second-generation RL uses a newer design 60° J-series 3.5 L V6 SOHC VTEC engine {{delivering}} 300 hp (224 kW; later revised to [...] due to new SAE testing procedures). To give the car a more sporty feel, the car featured <b>drive-by-wire</b> <b>throttle</b> control and a five-speed sequential sport shifting automatic transmission with shift paddles mounted on the steering wheel. As with the first-generation Acura RL, the second-generation Acura RL used premium unleaded fuel rated at 91 (R+M)/2 octane.|$|E
50|$|The WRC99, {{introduced}} {{at the first}} round of the championship, featured an electronically controlled, hydraulically actuated semi-automatic transmission with a <b>drive-by-wire</b> <b>throttle,</b> allowing the cars to be shifted with steering wheel mounted paddles, similar to F1 cars. This allowed the driver to shift gears faster, and reduced the chance of dog gear wear. Due to technical difficulties, the team struggled until the season's 7th round in Argentina. However, the car helped prove much of the technology seen on later cars. Subaru was the first rally team to implement this technology, which has been used on all WRC cars until it was forbidden by the 2011 championship rules.|$|E
50|$|Subaru had an all {{new line}} up for the 1999 season, with the {{nominated}} driver/co-driver teams of Richard Burns/Robert Reid, Juha Kankkunen/Juha Repo, and third team of Bruno Thiry/Stéphane Prévot. The new car, the WRC99, featured an electronically controlled Paddle shifter with a <b>drive-by-wire</b> <b>throttle.</b> Due to technical difficulties, the team struggled until the season's 7th round in Argentina. From there on, the teams earned the podium in seven out of eight events, with five wins, three of which were 1-2 finishes. Subaru {{finished second in the}} Manufacturers’ Championship, just four points behind Toyota. Burns scored victories in Greece, Australia, and Wales, for second place and Kankkunen took fourth in the Drivers’ Championship, with wins in Argentina and Finland.|$|E

50|$|However, on October 24, 2013, a jury {{ruled against}} Toyota {{and found that}} {{unintended}} acceleration could have been caused due to deficiencies in the <b>drive-by-wire</b> <b>throttle</b> system or Electronic Throttle Control System (ETCS). Michael Barr of the Barr Group testified that NASA {{had not been able}} to complete its examination of Toyota's ETCS and that Toyota did not follow best practices for real time life critical software, and that a single bit flip which can be caused by cosmic rays could cause unintended acceleration. As well, the run-time stack of the real-time operating system was not large enough and that it was possible for the stack to grow large enough to overwrite data that could cause unintended acceleration. As a result, Toyota has entered into settlement talks with its plaintiffs.|$|E
50|$|The {{drivetrain}} {{was available}} {{with a large}} number of engines (both turbocharged and non-turbocharged pre-Duratorq), sourced from Peugeot on early models, but engines from 1998 were mostly sourced from Ford, such as the York 'banana' engines which were described as 'dated', 'noisy' and 'ponderously slow' but 'dependable'. The Peugeot engines were praised as 'economical', often seen as more so than many of the Ford units. All engines were catalysed and were fitted with a <b>drive-by-wire</b> <b>throttle</b> setup, and ventilated front disc brakes were available as an optional extra, as was adjustable air suspension on long-wheelbase diesel models. The Ford Duratorq electronically-controlled direct-injection diesel engine appearing in 2001 (sourced from the Ford Transit) was fitted with a non-optional turbocharger, this was available with an optional intercooler, increasing the peak power output from 75PS to 90PS.|$|E
5000|$|The {{engine in}} the C6 S6 {{is an even}} firing all-aluminium alloy [...] Fuel Stratified Injection (FSI) 40-valve (four valves per cylinder) 90° V10 (parts code: 07L, {{identification}} code: BXA). Compared with the related 5.0-litre V10 found in the Lamborghini Gallardo, Audi's variant has a longer stroke and wider bore which increases the displacement of the engine so that it produces more torque at lower revs and is thus more suitable for the larger and heavier S6. It produces [...] at 6,800 rpm and 540 Nm of torque from 3,000 to 4,000 rpm. It uses twin chain-driven double overhead camshafts with variable valve timing for both intake and exhaust valves. The engine is managed by a Bosch Motronic MED 9.1 electronic engine control unit (ECU), which controls the mapped direct ignition, ten individual spark coils, common rail cylinder-direct sequential multi-point fuel injection, and <b>drive-by-wire</b> <b>throttle.</b>|$|E
5000|$|The 2003-2004 Pilots {{featured}} the J35A4 motor, an aluminum-alloy 3.5L V6 producing 240 HP and 242 lb-ft of torque. The 2005 Pilot received a new engine, the J35A6, which featured <b>drive-by-wire</b> <b>throttle</b> and produced 255 HP and 250 lb-ft of torque. Refreshed 2006-2008 Pilots came {{with either the}} J35Z1 (FWD) or the J35A9 (4WD). Both engines are rated at 244 HP and 240 lb-ft of torque. Refreshed FWD models feature Honda's Variable Cylinder Management system, which can deactivate up to three cylinders under light load to increase fuel economy. All Pilots from this generation feature a 5-speed automatic transmission. The Pilot has front struts with a coil-spring, multilink rear suspension for a flat rear load floor. Front track is 66.3 in and 66.5 in at the rear. The Pilot has a 4500 lb boat/3500 lb trailer towing capability with the optional dealer installed towing package.|$|E
5000|$|The Japanese market Civic Type R (FD2) {{went on sale}} on March 30, 2007. For {{the first}} time, the JDM Civic Type R was sold as a four-door sports sedan rather than a three-door hot hatch. Using the Japanese market four-door sedan as a base model meaning the new Type R is now bigger, wider and heavier. More importantly, the {{wheelbase}} has grown from 2570 mm to 2700 mm, giving the FD2R a more stable stance in high speed cornering. The new Japanese model's engine output {{is higher than the}} European version's, with [...] being developed at 8000 RPM and 215 Nm of torque peaking at 6100 RPM (versus [...] the uprated 256 bhp, 2.2-litre Honda Civic Type-R Mugen at 7800 RPM and 193 Nm at 5600 RPM for the European model). The base engine itself is borrowed from the Accord Euro R CL7 with its longer intake manifold. Changes have been made to the block in terms of mounting points for ancillary parts making it different from previous K20A. New technology such as <b>drive-by-wire</b> <b>throttle</b> and porting of the intake valve ports using techniques from the NSX are implemented. Honda says mid-range is increased by [...] Drive is fed through a close-ratio six-speed gearbox, and a helical limited slip differential is fitted as standard. The front brake discs increased from the DC5R's 300 mm to 320 mm fitted with four pot Brembo callipers. Tire size is now 225/40 R18 running on Bridgestone Potenza RE070.|$|E
40|$|Abstract—In this brief, {{the problem}} of {{designing}} a <b>drive-by-wire</b> <b>throttle</b> control system for a high-performance motorcycle engine is considered. Given {{the characteristics of the}} electromechanical system to be controlled, an observer-based, discrete-time sliding mode (DTSM) servo controller with integral action is adopted. The controller is designed on the basis of an identified model of the system, whose states are estimated by means of a state observer. Different state observer structures are analyzed, and it is shown that the main characteristics of standard state-feedback-based sliding mode control systems are preserved. A theoretical analysis is also presented showing that a separation principle holds, so that the state observer and the DTSM controller can be designed independently. The performances of the designed controller are illustrated by reporting the results of tests performed on track with a racing motorcycle...|$|E
