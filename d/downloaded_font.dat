5000|$|In {{order to}} render the test correctly, user agents need to {{implement}} the CSS 3 Text Shadows and the CSS 2.x Downloadable Fonts specifications, which are currently under consideration by W3C to be standardized. This is required as the test uses a custom TrueType font, called [...] "AcidAhemTest", to cover up a 20x20 red square. Supporting Truetype fonts however is not required by the CSS specification. A browser supporting only OpenType fonts with CFF outlines or Embedded OpenType fonts could support the CSS standard, but fail the test in the Acid3 test. The glyph, when rendered by the <b>downloaded</b> <b>font,</b> is just a square, made white with CSS, and thus invisible.|$|E
5000|$|Several dot-matrix impact {{printers}} (such as the Epson FX series) offered 'user-downloadable fonts'. This {{gave the}} user {{the flexibility to}} print with different typefaces. PC software uploaded a user-defined fontset into the printer's memory, replacing the built-in typeface with the user's selection. Any subsequent text printout would use the <b>downloaded</b> <b>font,</b> until the printer was powered off or soft-reset. Several third-party programs were developed to allow easier management of this capability. With a supported word-processor program (such as WordPerfect 5.1), the user could embed up to 2 NLQ custom typefaces {{in addition to the}} printer's built-in (ROM) typefaces. (The later rise of WYSIWYG software philosophy rendered downloaded fonts obsolete.) ...|$|E
50|$|Currently, Internet Explorer, Firefox, Safari, Opera and Google Chrome support {{automatic}} <b>downloading</b> of <b>fonts</b> used on {{a website}} using CSS2 or CSS3.|$|R
50|$|<b>Font</b> <b>downloading</b> {{was later}} {{included}} in the CSS3 fonts module and has since been implemented in Safari 3.1, Opera 10 and Mozilla Firefox 3.5. This has subsequently increased interest in web typography, {{as well as the}} usage of <b>font</b> <b>downloading.</b>|$|R

25|$|The CSS2 {{specification}} {{was released}} in 1998 and attempted to improve the font selection process by adding font matching, synthesis and download. These techniques did not gain much use, and were removed in the CSS2.1 specification. However, Internet Explorer added support for the <b>font</b> <b>downloading</b> feature in version 4.0, released in 1997. <b>Font</b> <b>downloading</b> was later included in the CSS3 fonts module, and has since been implemented in Safari 3.1, Opera 10 and Mozilla Firefox 3.5. This has subsequently increased interest in Web typography, {{as well as the}} usage of <b>font</b> <b>downloading.</b>|$|R
50|$|Type 32 is {{used for}} <b>downloading</b> bitmap <b>fonts</b> to PostScript interpreters with version number 2016 or greater. The bitmap {{characters}} are transferred directly into the interpreter's font cache, thus saving space in the printer's memory.|$|R
2500|$|CSS3 {{specified}} {{a mechanism}} for <b>downloading</b> and displaying <b>fonts</b> within a web page. This table compare support for that mechanism. Note that [...] Embedded OpenType (EOT) <b>font</b> <b>download</b> does not bring in the entire OpenType font and therefore, the most prominent feature of Open Type, ligature support, does not come with EOT. Trident before version 5.0 supports only EOT. EOT is not sufficient for smartfonts that rely on ligatures.|$|R
50|$|As a Meroitic Unicode font you may use Aegyptus {{which can}} be <b>downloaded</b> from Unicode <b>Fonts</b> for Ancient Scripts.|$|R
2500|$|A {{technique}} {{to refer to}} and automatically <b>download</b> remote <b>fonts</b> was first specified in the CSS2 specification, which introduced the @font-face construct. At the time, fetching font files from the web was controversial because fonts meant to be used only for certain web pages could also be downloaded and installed in breach of the font license.|$|R
50|$|Theme CustomizationIn {{the cases}} of Android (ChatON 3.0 or later) and Bada, users can <b>download</b> various <b>font</b> styles for free and apply them in the chat room. There are 22 font styles {{according}} to four language categories; Korean, Chinese, Latin, Arabic. If a user types ‘#’ before all sentences of message, text size is increased when it is sent.|$|R
50|$|Vishvakannada.com {{was one of}} {{the first}} {{websites}} to display Kannada characters on a website. It was the first Internet magazine in Kannada and also the first website in an Indian language to use dynamic fonts. The usage of dynamic fonts avoided the problem of users having to <b>download</b> website-specific <b>fonts</b> to view the Kannada characters on the website. Wikipedia in the Kannada language was started in September 2004.|$|R
50|$|Some of the {{traditional}} Kanji {{are not included in}} the Japanese font of Windows XP/2000, and only rectangles are shown. <b>Downloading</b> the Meiryo <b>font</b> from the Microsoft website (VistaFont_JPN.EXE) and installing it will solve this problem.|$|R
50|$|Mojikyo fonts come in {{a series}} of zip files around 2 - 5 {{megabytes}} each and contain varying numbers of characters. Characters include the modern Latin alphabet, Russian Cyrillic as well as a variety of various markers most seen in the Arial font, in addition to various ancient scripts. All of this comes with a character map that allows the users to browse through their <b>downloaded</b> Mojikyo <b>fonts,</b> copying and pasting characters in lieu of typing them on a keyboard.|$|R
5000|$|In {{order to}} {{overcome}} such problems, the IBM Character Data Representation Architecture level 2 specifically reserves ranges of code page IDs for user-definable and private-use assignments. Whenever such code page IDs are used, the user must {{not assume that}} the same functionality and appearance can be reproduced in another system configuration or on another device or system unless the user takes care of this specifically.The code page range 57344-61439 (E000h-EFFFh) is officially reserved for user-definable code pages (or actually CCSIDs {{in the context of}} IBM CDRA), whereas the range 65280-65533 (FF00h-FFFDh) is reserved for any user-definable [...] "private use" [...] assignments.For example, a non-registered custom variant of code page 437 (1B5h) or 28591 (6FAF) could become 57781 (E1B5h) or 61359 (EFAFh), respectively, in order to avoid potential conflicts with other assignments and maintain the sometimes existing internal numerical logic in the assignments of the original code pages. An unregistered private code page not based on an existing code page, a device specific code page like a printer font, which just needs a logical handle to become addressable for the system, a frequently changing <b>download</b> <b>font,</b> or a code page number with a symbolic meaning in the local environment could have an assignment in the private range like 65280 (FF00h).|$|R
5000|$|The basic {{standard}} for copyrighted digital font use {{is that a}} license is required for each individual font used on a computer, {{or in the case}} of businesses, one per entity. [...] Under the license fonts are typically licensed only for use on one computer. These End User License Agreements (EULAs) generally state that fonts may only be used on machines that have a valid license. These fonts cannot be shared by multiple computers or given to others. These licenses can be obtained in three ways: directly from the font authors (e.g., Adobe), as part of a larger software package (e.g., Microsoft Office), or through purchasing or <b>downloading</b> the <b>font</b> from an authorized outlet.|$|R
50|$|The {{release of}} Windows 10 brought {{important}} updates and new features to Direct2D {{such as the}} performance improvement of rendering scalable text without font rasterization, the ability to <b>download</b> the needed <b>font</b> from the cloud on demand without requiring the font installation step, an optimization for faster image loading and image effect rendering, and a more sophisticated way to apply gradient brush {{through the use of}} 2D mesh made of gradient patches. This release also introduced a brand-new API extension to support digital ink, which is highly leveraged by the brand-new Microsoft Edge browser as well as the new ink canvas XAML control.|$|R
40|$|Many typefaces possess next to stylistic qualities also {{cultural}} and connotative properties. This paper describes {{an exploration of}} signage and lettering {{in the capital of}} North Queensland in the quest for a tropical typographic resonance. Is the vernacular typography alive or a vanishing art form? A young designer recently posted a request for help on a graphic design blog: "I have to do a piece for the tropics [...] . Can anybody recommend a typeface?" Replies to his request were sparse and mostly pointing toward websites with typefaces of varying quality available for free by <b>download.</b> These <b>fonts</b> were predominantly decorative in style, featuring a palm tree or leaf intertwining with a letter. Few of the recommendations could be considered to truly connote the tropics. This exchange begs the question: is there even such thing as a typeface signifying the tropics? Is there type, lettering or signage that could be said to communicate the qualities of the tropics, or creates a corresponding sense of place? More specifically, is there a unique typographic landscape created through signage and lettering in the urban environment of Townsville, the capital of tropical North Queensland? In search of a distinctive vernacular typography, the author wandered the streets of the city, investigating type in both obvious and hidden places, discovering writing on forgotten walls and inspecting signage of business owners advertising their services...|$|R
