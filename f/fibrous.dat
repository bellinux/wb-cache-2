5|$|The {{outermost}} {{zone of the}} {{adrenal cortex}} is the zona glomerulosa. It lies immediately under the <b>fibrous</b> capsule of the gland. Cells in this layer form oval groups, separated by thin strands of connective tissue from the <b>fibrous</b> capsule of the gland and carry wide capillaries.|$|E
5|$|Abnormalities of dermal <b>fibrous</b> and elastic tissue {{are caused}} by {{problems}} in the regulation of collagen synthesis or degradation.|$|E
5|$|Cirrus Fibratus clouds {{appear as}} thin and <b>fibrous</b> looking. Noticeably, {{they are the}} most common type of cirrus cloud. They might {{indicate}} windy weather, since they are mostly formed by wind shear on higher altitudes.|$|E
5|$|Cirrus Uncinus clouds {{appear as}} thin and <b>fibrous</b> like, {{except that they}} always have a hook or curl on the tip.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to or instead of sclerocytes, demosponges have spongocytes that secrete {{a form of}} collagen that polymerizes into spongin, a thick <b>fibrous</b> material that stiffens the mesohyl.|$|E
5|$|Proteins can be informally {{divided into}} three main classes, which {{correlate}} with typical tertiary structures: globular proteins, <b>fibrous</b> proteins, and membrane proteins. Almost all globular proteins are soluble and many are enzymes. <b>Fibrous</b> proteins are often structural, such as collagen, the major component of connective tissue, or keratin, the protein component of hair and nails. Membrane proteins often serve as receptors or provide channels for polar or charged molecules {{to pass through the}} cell membrane.|$|E
5|$|Although {{the layers}} of pinacocytes and choanocytes {{resemble}} the epithelia of more complex animals, they are not bound tightly by cell-to-cell connections or a basal lamina (thin <b>fibrous</b> sheet underneath). The flexibility of these layers and re-modeling of the mesohyl by lophocytes allow the animals to adjust their shapes throughout their lives to take maximum advantage of local water currents.|$|E
5|$|Ceriantharia {{comprises}} the related tube-dwelling anemones. Tube-dwelling anemones or cerianthids look {{very similar to}} sea anemones, but belong to an entirely different subclass of anthozoans. They are solitary, living buried in soft sediments. Tube anemones live and can withdraw into tubes, which are made of a <b>fibrous</b> material, which is made from secreted mucus and threads of nematocyst-like organelles, known as ptychocysts.|$|E
5|$|Connective tissues are <b>fibrous</b> {{and made}} up of cells {{scattered}} among inorganic material called the extracellular matrix. Connective tissue gives shape to organs and holds them in place. The main types are loose connective tissue, adipose tissue, <b>fibrous</b> connective tissue, cartilage and bone. The extracellular matrix contains proteins, the chief and most abundant of which is collagen. Collagen plays a major part in organizing and maintaining tissues. The matrix can be modified to form a skeleton to support or protect the body. An exoskeleton is a thickened, rigid cuticle which is stiffened by mineralization, as in crustaceans or by the cross-linking of its proteins as in insects. An endoskeleton is internal and present in all developed animals, {{as well as in}} many of those less developed.|$|E
5|$|Like {{those of}} cnidarians, (jellyfish, sea anemones, etc.), ctenophores' bodies {{consist of a}} {{relatively}} thick, jelly-like mesoglea sandwiched between two epithelia, layers of cells bound by inter-cell connections and by a <b>fibrous</b> basement membrane that they secrete. The epithelia of ctenophores have two layers of cells rather than one, {{and some of the}} cells in the upper layer have several cilia per cell.|$|E
5|$|Scientists do not {{yet know}} what these dinosaurs ate. Having very small, ridged teeth they could not have chewed tough, <b>fibrous</b> plants as {{effectively}} as other dinosaurs of the same period. It is assumed that pachycephalosaurs lived on a mixed diet of leaves, seeds, and fruits. The sharp, serrated teeth would have been very effective for shredding plants.|$|E
5|$|The {{office to}} the north of the head keeper house is a small square room raised on short {{concrete}} pillars, constructed of timber framed fibro clad walls and corrugated <b>fibrous</b> cement roof. It has a continuous band of windows. The last three buildings, the garage, powerhouse and fuel store, are small brick buildings with metal roofs and reinforced concrete floors.|$|E
5|$|Geastrum quadrifidum {{is readily}} {{confused}} with G.fornicatum, which is larger—up to —and has smaller spores (4–5μm in diameter). Geastrum minimum, although small like G.quadrifidum, is distinguished by having more rays (usually more than seven), {{and it is}} not fornicate. Also, its mycelial layer is attached to the <b>fibrous</b> layer for a long time, without forming a mycelial cup like G.quadrifidum. The Chilean species G.jurei does not have a clearly demarcated peristome.|$|E
5|$|Geastrum welwitschii {{also has}} similar {{morphological}} characters to G.minimum in having small fruit bodies, whitish spore sacs, and fibrillose peristomes. However G.welwitschii is differentiated from G.minimum by its fornicate, mostly 3–6, {{rays of the}} exoperidia, and the mycelial layer that easily loosens from the <b>fibrous</b> layer to form a mycelial cup. G.welwitschii is distinguished from G.entomophilum by its dark and sessile endoperidium, and smaller spores (2.8–3.5μm).|$|E
5|$|In medusae {{the only}} {{supporting}} structure is the mesoglea. Hydra and most sea anemones close their mouths {{when they are}} not feeding, and the water in the digestive cavity then acts as a hydrostatic skeleton, rather like a water-filled balloon. Other polyps such as Tubularia use columns of water-filled cells for support. Sea pens stiffen the mesoglea with calcium carbonate s and tough <b>fibrous</b> proteins, rather like sponges.|$|E
5|$|Medicinal {{plants are}} often tough and <b>fibrous,</b> {{requiring}} {{some form of}} preparation to make them convenient to administer. According to the Institute for Traditional Medicine, common methods for the preparation of herbal medicines include decoction, powdering, and extraction with alcohol, in each case yielding a mixture of substances. Decoction involves crushing and then boiling the plant material in water to produce a liquid extract. Powdering involves drying the plant material and then crushing it to yield a powder that can be compressed into tablets. Alcohol extraction involves soaking the plant material in cold wine or distilled spirit to form a tincture.|$|E
5|$|Some {{types of}} chronic lung {{diseases}} {{are classified as}} restrictive lung disease, because of a restriction {{in the amount of}} lung tissue involved in respiration. These include pulmonary fibrosis which can occur when the lung is inflamed {{for a long period of}} time. Fibrosis in the lung replaces functioning lung tissue with <b>fibrous</b> connective tissue. This can be due to a large variety of occupational diseases such as Coalworker's pneumoconiosis, autoimmune diseases or more rarely to a reaction to medication.|$|E
5|$|Structural {{proteins}} confer {{stiffness and}} rigidity to otherwise-fluid biological components. Most structural proteins are <b>fibrous</b> proteins; for example, collagen and elastin are critical components of connective tissue such as cartilage, and keratin {{is found in}} hard or filamentous structures such as hair, nails, feathers, hooves, and some animal shells. Some globular proteins can also play structural functions, for example, actin and tubulin are globular and soluble as monomers, but polymerize to form long, stiff fibers {{that make up the}} cytoskeleton, which allows the cell to maintain its shape and size.|$|E
5|$|The Amylostereaceae {{are white}} rot pathogens. They {{disintegrate}} the lignin {{of the host}} wood, whereby the infested wood parts become less stable and take a <b>fibrous</b> structure. The wood bleaches as fungal enzymes break down and remove the brown-pigmented lignin. The distribution in wood takes place mainly along the transport channels in the xylem. If the wood is crosscut, the red rot is vertically positioned, on which bleached, infested areas contrast with intact wood. Symptoms of infestion by the symbiotic partner—wood wasps—include circular exit holes in the crust and acute stress through dryness, common in hanging, falling or tanning needles.|$|E
5|$|The avian {{circulatory system}} {{is driven by}} a four-chambered, myogenic heart {{contained}} in a <b>fibrous</b> pericardial sac. This pericardial sac is filled with a serous fluid for lubrication. The heart itself is divided into a right and left half, each with an atrium and ventricle. The atrium and ventricles of each side are separated by atrioventricular valves which prevent back flow from one chamber to the next during contraction. Being myogenic, the heart's pace is maintained by pacemaker cells found in the sinoatrial node, located on the right atrium.|$|E
5|$|The calcium {{carbonate}} or silica spicules of most sponge genera make them too rough for most uses, but two genera, Hippospongia and Spongia, have soft, entirely <b>fibrous</b> skeletons. Early Europeans used soft sponges for many purposes, including padding for helmets, portable drinking utensils and municipal water filters. Until {{the invention of}} synthetic sponges, they were used as cleaning tools, applicators for paints and ceramic glazes and discreet contraceptives. However, by the mid-20th century, over-fishing brought both the animals and the industry close to extinction.|$|E
5|$|The cardiac {{skeleton}} is made {{of dense}} connective tissue and this gives structure to the heart. It forms the atrioventricular septum which separates the atria from the ventricles, and the <b>fibrous</b> rings which serve as bases for the four heart valves. The cardiac skeleton also provides an important boundary in the heart's electrical conduction system since collagen cannot conduct electricity. The interatrial septum separates the atria and the interventricular septum separates the ventricles. The interventricular septum is much thicker than the interatrial septum, since the ventricles need to generate greater pressure when they contract.|$|E
5|$|The {{cause of}} plantar {{fasciitis}} is poorly understood and {{is thought to}} likely have several contributing factors. The plantar fascia is a thick <b>fibrous</b> band of connective tissue that originates from the medial tubercle and anterior aspect of the heel bone. From there, the fascia extends along the {{sole of the foot}} before inserting {{at the base of the}} toes, and supports the arch of the foot.|$|E
5|$|The few {{species of}} demosponge that have entirely soft <b>fibrous</b> skeletons with no hard {{elements}} {{have been used}} by humans over thousands of years for several purposes, including as padding and as cleaning tools. By the 1950s, though, these had been overfished so heavily that the industry almost collapsed, and most sponge-like materials are now synthetic. Sponges and their microscopic endosymbionts are now being researched as possible sources of medicines for treating a wide range of diseases. Dolphins have been observed using sponges as tools while foraging.|$|E
5|$|The pseudoparenchymatous layer (a {{layer of}} thin-walled, usually angular, {{randomly}} arranged {{cells that are}} tightly packed) is initially beige, later brownish, in age dark brown, cracked and if moist reddish brown. The <b>fibrous</b> layer is beige-colored, with its outer side free from the mycelial layer except at {{the tips of the}} rays. The mycelial layer has a beige brown to somewhat yellowish-brown, felted to tufted outer surface, darkening to reddish-brown if moist. It is not encrusted with debris, but some debris and sand may adhere. The inner side is smooth, dull to somewhat glossy, and hazelnut brown.|$|E
5|$|The shape, size, {{insertion}} and {{origin of}} the arch can vary widely. The arch usually occurs {{on both sides of}} the body; but may also occur only on one side. The muscular component of the arch varies, with some arches seen to be purely <b>fibrous.</b> The origin can be a direct continuation of the latissimus dorsi muscle fibres, originate with the tendinous element of the latissimus dorsi, or be a mixture of the two types originating from both the muscle and the tendon.|$|E
5|$|The three sheds {{surrounding}} the lighthouse are the workshop to the south, the former powerhouse {{to the west}} and the fuel store to the north. They are all rectangular structures, timber framed and fibro clad with corrugated <b>fibrous</b> cement gable roofs. The workshop appears to be built on the remains of one of the early stone buildings, lying on a plinth with sandstone steps. It consists of two rooms with pivoting sash windows and timber framed doors and no internal lining. The former powerhouse and the fuel store have reinforced concrete floors, fibro lining, double-hung sash windows and double timber framed doors.|$|E
5|$|Traditionally, the {{accessory}} nerve {{is described as}} having a small cranial component that descends from the medulla and briefly connects with the spinal accessory component before branching off of the nerve to join the vagus nerve. A study, published in 2007, of twelve subjects suggests that {{in the majority of}} individuals, this cranial component does not make any distinct connection to the spinal component; the roots of these distinct components were separated by a <b>fibrous</b> sheath in all but one subject.|$|E
5|$|A {{reduction}} in fracture toughness {{may also be}} attributed to the embrittlement effect of impurities, or for body-centred cubic metals, from a {{reduction in}} temperature. Metals and in particular steels have a transitional temperature range where above this range the metal has acceptable notch-ductility while below this range the material becomes brittle. Within the range, the materials behavior is unpredictable. The reduction in fracture toughness is accompanied by a change in the fracture appearance. When above the transition, the fracture is primarily due to micro-void coalescence, which results in the fracture appearing <b>fibrous.</b> When the temperatures falls the fracture will show signs of cleavage facets. These two appearances are visible by the naked eye. Brittle fracture in steel plates may appear as chevron markings under the microscope. These arrow-like ridges on the crack surface point towards the origin of the fracture.|$|E
5|$|Food {{impaction}} {{occurs when}} food debris, especially <b>fibrous</b> food such as meat, becomes trapped between two teeth and is {{pushed into the}} gums during chewing. The usual cause of food impaction is disruption of the normal interproximal contour or drifting of teeth so that a gap is created (an open contact). Decay can lead to collapse of part of the tooth, or a dental restoration may not accurately reproduce the contact point. Irritation, localized discomfort or mild pain {{and a feeling of}} pressure from between the two teeth results. The gingival papilla is swollen, tender and bleeds when touched. The pain occurs during and after eating, and may slowly disappear before being evoked again at the next meal, or relieved immediately by using a tooth pick or dental floss in the involved area. A gingival or periodontal abscess may develop from this situation.|$|E
5|$|Hydnellum fruitbodies have {{caps and}} stipes, often with indeterminant growth forms, that may grow in spurts and decay over several weeks. Neighboring fruitbodies can coalesce, forming {{intricately}} intertwined caps and partially fused stipes. The flesh has a zoned appearance and is <b>fibrous</b> when fresh, but becomes hard and woody when dry. Zones {{in the flesh}} reflect differences in growth during periods of low daytime and high nighttime humidity, and give a fairly accurate record of daily growth. The spines are crowded closely together and are typically decurrent (extending {{down the length of}} the stipe). Fruitbodies may display a variety of colors, from white to yellow, olive green, shades of orange, light brown, or dark brown in age.|$|E
5|$|In 1909, {{dermatologist}} Frederick Parkes Weber {{wrote an}} article about von Recklinghausen disease in the British Journal of Dermatology. erroneously citing Merrick {{as an example of}} the disease, which German pathologist Friedrich Daniel von Recklinghausen had described in 1882, but in the last year has been found that this conjecture was wrong. In fact, symptoms that are always present in this genetic disorder include tumours of the nervous tissue and bones, small warty growths on the skin, and (which is a peculiar characteristic of this disease) the presence of light brown pigmentation on the skin called café au lait spots.; however, these spots were never observed on Merrick's body. For this reason, although this diagnosis was quite popular through most of the 20th century, other conjectural diagnosis were advanced, such as those of who suffer Maffucci syndrome and polyostotic <b>fibrous</b> dysplasia (Albright's disease).|$|E
5|$|Inocybe maculata, {{commonly}} known as the frosty fibrecap, is a species of mushroom in the Inocybaceae family. First described by Jean Louis Émile Boudier in 1885, I. maculata can be found throughout Europe, Asia and North America. It is a medium-sized brown mushroom with a <b>fibrous,</b> brown cap with white remnants of a universal veil in the middle. The stem is cream or brown. The species is ectomycorrhizal and grows at the base of various trees, including beech. Inocybe maculata is poisonous, containing muscarine. Possible symptoms after consumption of I.maculata mushrooms are salivation, lacrimation, urination, defecation, gastrointestinal problems and vomiting, with the possibility of death due to respiratory failure.|$|E
5|$|Nearly all beer {{includes}} {{barley malt}} {{as the majority}} of the starch. This is because its <b>fibrous</b> hull remains attached to the grain during threshing. After malting, barley is milled, which finally removes the hull, breaking it into large pieces. These pieces remain with the grain during the mash, and act as a filter bed during lautering, when sweet wort is separated from insoluble grain material. Other malted and unmalted grains (including wheat, rice, oats, and rye, and less frequently, corn and sorghum) may be used. Some brewers have produced gluten-free beer, made with sorghum with no barley malt, for those who cannot consume gluten-containing grains like wheat, barley, and rye.|$|E
5|$|The capillitium {{refers to}} coarse, late-maturing, {{thick-walled}} {{cells in the}} gleba that develop pores or slits in their thick secondary walls. The capillitial hyphae are 1.5–9.5µm wide, thick-walled, often with a narrow lumen, and with or without surface ornamentation. The columella hyphae are 1.5–14µm wide (occasionally wider, up to 34µm), thick-walled, often with narrow lumen. Single thin-walled, about 1.5µm wide hyphae with clamps can be observed. The endoperidial hyphae are densely interwoven, thick-walled, and about 2–6µm wide. The whitish powder on newly expanded specimens consists of crystalline matter and thin-walled, 1.5–4µm wide, branched hyphae with clamps. The peristome hyphae are thick-walled, 2–11µm wide. The pseudoparenchymatous layer is built up by bladder-like, thin-walled hyphae of varying size. On the surface of newly expanded specimens crystals and thin-walled hyphae {{of the same kind}} as on the endoperidium are present. The crystals are calcium oxalate dihydrate that have the crystalline structure of a pyramid, and are arranged singly or in loose aggregates, 11 to 30µm in size. The <b>fibrous</b> layer has thick-walled hyphae 1.5–4µm wide. The mycelial layer in the inner, very thin part (seen as a glossy lining on the <b>fibrous</b> layer of newly expanded fruit bodies) consists of a dense web of thin-walled, 1.5–4µm wide, clamped hyphae. Thick-walled hyphae are also present, measuring 2–11 (sometimes up to 19)µm wide. The outer part (the mycelial cup) consists of thick-walled, branched and densely interwoven hyphae (often with a narrow lumen) that measure 1.5–4µm wide.|$|E
5|$|The cysts of Azotobacter are spherical and {{consist of}} the {{so-called}} 'central body' – a reduced copy of vegetative cells with several vacuoles – and the 'two-layer shell'. The inner part of the shell is called intine and has a <b>fibrous</b> structure. The outer part has a hexagonal crystalline structure and is called exine. Exine is partially hydrolyzed by trypsin and is resistant to lysozyme, {{in contrast to the}} central body. The central body can be isolated in a viable state by some chelation agents. The main constituents of the outer shell are alkylresorcinols composed of long aliphatic chains and aromatic rings. Alkylresorcinols are also found in other bacteria, animals, and plants.|$|E
