50|$|The first downy plumage of new nestlings is silky white, {{though it}} soon turns a smoky brown-grey. As in other sea eagles, remiges and rectrices of the first-year plumage are longer {{than those of}} adults.

The tail of the immature eagle is white with black mottling distally. The young Steller's sea eagle has a dark brown iris, whitish legs, and blackish-brown beak. Through at least three intermediate plumages, mottling in the tail decreases, body and wing feathering acquires a bronze cast, and the eye and bill lighten in colour. <b>Definitive</b> <b>plumage</b> is probably reached in the fifth year of life, based on fragmentary data from captives.

40|$|Plumage {{colouration}} {{serves a}} variety of functions for birds, including signalling conspecifics, crypsis, and predator-prey interactions. Though much {{research has been conducted}} on colour change in species which exhibit delayed plumage maturation, where birds do not exhibit definitive adult plumage until their second breeding season or later, relatively few studies have examined how colour changes once definitive adult plumage has been attained. Studies that have focused on changes in <b>definitive</b> <b>plumage</b> colour have proposed two non-mutually exclusive hypotheses to explain colour change: age-related colour change occurs within individuals, and colour biased survival of more or less colourful individuals. Few studies have examined how carotenoid-based plumage colour changes, and those that have found conflicting results as to whether age-related colour change is occurring. In this study I examined the carotenoid-based plumage colour of the American redstarts, a migratory passerine that exhibits delayed plumage maturation where males obtain <b>definitive</b> <b>plumage</b> after their second year. Using reflectance spectrometry on feathers collected over a ten year period from a breeding population in Ontario, Canada, I quantified the colour characteristics of each feather and compared the intermediate (juvenile) colour to the <b>definitive</b> <b>plumage</b> colour, and tracked how the definitive adult plumage colour changed over time. As expected, due to delayed plumage maturation, male redstarts had <b>definitive</b> <b>plumage</b> that was significantly more orange and saturated in carotenoid chroma than their intermediate plumage. Additionally, males were most orange-shifted (reflected light at the longest wavelengths) during their first breeding season with <b>definitive</b> <b>plumage,</b> and became significantly more yellow-shifted (reflected light at shorter wavelengths) in the subsequent season. Female redstarts displayed significantly brighter and more orange-shifted plumage during their second breeding season compared to their first, but did not undergo any further colour change in subsequent years. The results of this study support the hypothesis that age-related colour change occurs within individuals, however I cannot {{rule out the possibility that}} differential survival also acts at the population level. Plumage colour is a complex trait and further research is needed to understand the relationship between change and reproductive effort...|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT The Greater Flamingo is a {{long-lived}} species reaching {{maturity and}} breeding {{only after a}} period ofyears. Observations after fledging ofbirds ringed as chicks in the Camargue have revealed patterns of plumage suc-cession which are presentedhere. During the first year there is little individual variation in the progression of the coloration of juvenile plumage and bare parts. Immature appearance, on the contrary, varies considerably between individuals, as does {{the age at which}} <b>definitive</b> <b>plumage</b> appears, normally after 4 - 6 years. There is a slight sexual dimorphism with females, identified by their smaller size, acquiring <b>definitive</b> <b>plumage</b> on average shortly before males.

5|$|It {{has long}} been {{believed}} that a male black-throated blue warbler achieves reproductive maturation well into its first breeding season. A yearling participates in extra-pair mating and cuckoldry as much as or even more than older males. However, research by Graves has found opposing evidence in terms of testicular size and sperm production. Directional asymmetry is present in many passerine birds. The left testicle is often larger in size than the right one, and this holds true for both yearling and older male warblers. However, the testicle to body mass ratio nonetheless is much lower in yearlings than in older males. Moreover, older males have {{a greater degree of}} directional asymmetry than do yearlings. Because the size of testes in birds is correlated to the ejaculate quality, it is likely that females employ age-dependent choice in favor of older males who can be distinguished by their <b>definitive</b> age-specific <b>plumage.</b>|$|R
40|$|Lek-mating Long-tailed Manakins (Chiroxiphia linearis) exhibit {{an unusual}} pattern of delayed plumage maturation. Each year, males {{progress}} {{through a series}} of predefinitive plumages before attaining <b>definitive</b> <b>plumage</b> in their fifth calendar year. Females also exhibit variation in plumage coloration, with some females displaying male-like plumage characteristics. Using data from mist-net captures in northwest Costa Rica (n = 1, 315) and museum specimens from throughout the range of Long-tailed Manakins (n = 585), we documented the plumage sequence progression of males, explored variation in female plumage, and described the timing of molt in this species. Males progressed {{through a series of}} age-specific predefinitive plumages, which enabled the accurate aging of predefinitive-plumaged males in the field; this predefinitive plumage sequence is the basis for age-related status-signaling in these males. Females tended to acquire red coloration in the crown as they aged. However, colorful plumage in females may be a byproduct of selection on bright male plumage. Females exhibited an early peak of molt activity from February to April, little molt from May through July, and a second, more pronounced peak of molt activity in October. By contrast, males in older predefinitive-plumage stages and males in <b>definitive</b> <b>plumage</b> exhibited comparable unimodal distributions in molt activity beginning in June and peaking between July and October. Our data are consistent with selective pressure to avoid the costs of molt-breeding overlap in females and older males. Our findings have important implications for social organization and signaling in Long- tailed Manakins, and for the evolution of delayed plumage maturation in birds.

40|$|Blue-crowned manakins (Lepidothrix coronata) exhibit neotenic {{retention}} of subadult monomorphic plumage in sexually mature males. Definitively plumaged adult L. coronata are dichromatic, with males displaying a black body and blue crown while females retain green colouration characteristic of Pipridae species. Male neoteny and {{the reliance on}} soft tissue colouration to identify females make mature monomorphic L. coronata indistinguishable in the field, presenting research and management difficulties. The application of biometric measurements with discriminant function analysis (DFA) offers a practical methodology to sex L. coronata.

50|$|During {{the first}} year after hatching, the {{underside}} is white and the molt cycles are too rapid to easily define definitive colors per molt. Molting starts at around 10 weeks, as the juvenile undergoes six molts before reaching the <b>definitive</b> basic <b>plumage</b> which is then slightly altered during the breeding season. At around three to five years of age, the upperparts become gray to grayish-brown, the abdomen becomes blackish-brown, and the remaining underside is marked with black and silver stripes. During molting, the adult can adopt up to three appearances. During the post-breeding season, the head turns pale yellow and the neck turns white, and immediately before breeding, the head turns yellow and the neck turns dark brown. During the nesting period, the head becomes white, with dark feathers placed randomly. The plumage in the male and the female are similar, except that the female is likely to molt at 34 to 36 months while the male molts at 36 to 40 months of age.|$|R
40|$|Young {{birds that}} do not achieve somatic {{maturation}} {{in the same year}} as they achieve sexual maturation, wear a plumage distinct from that of the <b>definitive</b> adult <b>plumage</b> during their first potential breeding year. This feature has got extensive attention in literature as 'delayed plumage maturation'. This paper argues that the occurrence of subadult plumage is a better name as is does not make any advanced assumptions on the evolutionary development of subadult plumage. Although the occurrence of subadult plumage {{does not have to be}} adaptive, most hypotheses on the evolution of subadult plumage assume this trait to be adaptive. In studying the adaptiveness of a trait there are two major approaches. The within species approach considers the adaptiveness of the trait within a single species by relating variation in plumage colour to variation in fitness-related parameters (either natural variation (descriptive approach) or artificial variation (experimental approach)). The comparative approach compares the occurrence of subadult plumage in several species and uses the generality of the trait to get an indication of its adaptiveness. Comparative studies can either use phylogeny or not use phylogeny. The best understanding of the adaptiveness of subadult plumage will follow from the combined use of the comparative approach with phylogeny and of the experimental within species approach. The comparative approach with phylogeny is necessary to identify independent groups and suitable control groups, the experimental within species approach can actually prove whether something is adaptive or not. ...|$|R
40|$|In lek-breeding systems {{where many}} males gather at display sites, males {{benefit from the}} {{establishment}} of dominance hierarchies to reduce intrasexual aggression and the associated risk of injuries. Long-tailed manakins (Chiroxiphia linearis) exhibit an exploded lek-breeding system wherein the two top-ranking males at each display site team up to perform elaborate coordinated courtship displays for females. Young males undergo delayed plumage maturation whereby they acquire distinct pre-definitive plumage patterns each year until they attain <b>definitive</b> <b>plumage</b> in their fifth year. This unique characteristic {{is thought to have}} evolved as a status-signalling mechanism to aid in the establishment of an age-graded dominance hierarchy in which older males are dominant to younger males. Previous research has shown evidence for such a dominance hierarchy among alpha and beta males; however, the presence of this hierarchy among males of other age classes has never been quantified. In this study, we investigated the presence of an age-graded dominance hierarchy by determining whether older males direct more aggressive behaviours towards younger males. We also investigated whether status signalling is less clear within age classes than between age classes, by determining whether males within the same age class exhibit more aggression towards each other. We found that older males performed aggressive behaviours towards younger males much more frequently than younger males performed aggressive behaviours towards older males. We also found that some aggressive interactions occurred between males within the same age class more frequently than between males from different age classes. Our study provides some evidence for an age-graded dominance hierarchy among male long-tailed manakins of all age classes and also provides some support for the status-signalling hypothesis. However, {{further research is needed to}} conclusively establish the presence of a linear dominance hierarchy among younger male manakins. This research may help us better understand the evolution of complex hierarchical systems in animals...|$|E
40|$|In the {{tradition}} of previous studies of threatened species, this thesis was undertaken {{with the aim of}} improving our understanding of the ecology of the White-winged Nightjar Caprimulgus candicans, and providing the information necessary to facilitate conservation efforts on its behalf. In 1998 – 2001, I studied a population of White-winged Nightjars at Aguará Ñu, an area of cerrado habitats within the Reserva Natural del Bosque Mbaracayú, eastern Paraguay. Over the course of three fieldwork seasons, I captured and ringed a total of 49 nightjars (34 adults and 15 young birds). Young females first bred at approximately one year old, while still in pre-definitive plumage. Young males exhibited a form of delayed plumage maturation, whereby they only attained <b>definitive</b> <b>plumage</b> following a prolonged moult spanning much of their first potential breeding season. No evidence was obtained to suggest that they succeeded in breeding while in this conspicuously intermediate state of moult. Considerable variation was noted in the plumage whiteness of definitive males, but no clear evidence was found for consistent age-related increases in white. During the breeding season, males defended small aggregated display territories, at which they conducted nuptial display flights between late August and early January. Female nightjars were responsible for all the parental care, and apparently visited male display arenas solely to obtain copulations. Chick paternity data confirmed that the study population was polygynous, with patterns of male aggregation suggestive of an exploded lek or ‘landmark’ mating system. Radio-telemetry studies showed that nightjars utilised home ranges of at least 20 to 40 hectares during the eight to ten months for which they were monitored. Home ranges contained a disproportionately large amount of young campo cerrado vegetation, but no forest or old campo cerrado habitats. When selecting foraging sites within their ranges, nightjars preferred younger and avoided older campo cerrado vegetation; wet grassland was utilised roughly in proportion to its availability. Observed patterns of habitat selection were potentially explained by the greater abundance of insect prey in younger habitats. When selecting daytime roost sites, nightjars preferred vegetation of intermediate age, reflecting their need for a balance between cover and ease of access. A more general analysis of patterns of sexual dimorphism within the Caprimulgidae showed that, although almost 80 % of nightjar species exhibit some dimorphism of plumage whiteness, the study species was by far the most extreme case. The striking plumage of the male was partly explained by a strong positive relationship between wing white and openness of breeding habitats within the family. However, this failed to explain the complete absence of white in the female plumage, or the extent of white dimorphism shown by the species. The most likely explanation would appear to be that extreme plumage dimorphism occurred in conjunction with the evolution of polygyny and female-only care in this open-country species. The implications of these findings for the conservation of the White-winged Nightjar are highlighted, and recommendations are proposed for future work and conservation action.
