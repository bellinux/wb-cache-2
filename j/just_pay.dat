25|$|American International Pictures had {{achieved}} {{a great deal}} of commercial success in the early 1960s with Bava's Black Sunday (1960) and Black Sabbath (1963), as well as dozens of lesser Italian films, including several sword and sandal pictures. Eventually, AIP heads Samuel Z. Arkoff and James H. Nicholson decided to coproduce some of these films, rather than <b>just</b> <b>pay</b> for the rights to distribute them, in order to have more control over their content. Planet of the Vampires was one such coproduction, financed by AIP and Italy's Fulvio Lucisano for Italian International Film, along with some Spanish production money provided by Castilla Cooperativa Cinematográfica. AIP provided the services of writer Ib Melchior, whose previous movies had included such modest hits as The Angry Red Planet (1959) and Reptilicus (1961), as well as the relatively big budget Robinson Crusoe on Mars (1964). Melchior wrote the screenplay for the English-language version of the film, with some assistance from AIP producer Louis M. Heyward.|$|E
500|$|In January 2007, it was {{reported}} that May and England defender Glen Johnson were caught at a B store in Dartford, Kent, attempting to steal bathroom fittings. They both received £80 fines. Johnson described the incident as [...] "comical" [...] because it was a misunderstanding — [...] "Ben was doing up his bathroom so we went to B and found one of those sets where you get everything in one box. But he wanted a seat with a slow-close lid, so we took out the seat and put in another one. What we didn't know was that the new seat was £2.35 more expensive. We went through the till, paid for it and then the security guard stopped us and said he had been watching on CCTV. We just burst out laughing. Where's Jeremy Beadle then? But he said, 'No, this is serious, the police are on their way.' The police turned up and they were laughing. I said to the security guard, 'Can we not <b>just</b> <b>pay</b> the £2.35?'" [...] He said, 'No, this is a serious offence.' So the police gave us two options: go to court and fight it out, or pay an on-the-spot fine. We couldn't be bothered going to court so we paid the fine but doing that made us look guilty".|$|E
2500|$|During {{the tobacco}} ban, {{the use of}} tobacco was still implied in movies and television, {{even if it was}} not {{explicitly}} shown; it was [...] "sung and danced about" [...] instead. [...] So Bollywood, in conjunction with tobacco companies, was still able to get around the smoking ban. Bollywood was also able to bypass the tobacco ban {{because of the lack of}} enforcement. Corruption within the government and police lead to officials not being successfully impose such policies, such as the smoking ban in cinema. As noted by one, [...] "The authorities aren’t organized enough...I’ll <b>just</b> <b>pay</b> a bribe." [...] The Delhi High Court subsequently overturned the ban in January 2009, citing that the ban was a form of censorship that restricted the right to freedom of speech.|$|E

2500|$|Before {{the start}} of the 2004–05 season, Cahill was {{transferred}} to Everton for a fee of £1.5million, after Millwall's South East London rivals Crystal Palace ended negotiations of a potential transfer to themselves over a payment to his agents. In his first season, he was Everton's top goalscorer and was the fans' Player of the Season. Before the 2005–06 season Cahill's contract at Everton was extended with a salary increase reflecting the impact he had made at the club. The third round of that season's FA Cup drew Cahill's former club, Millwall against Everton at The Den. He scored the winner in the replay at Goodison Park, but chose not to celebrate his winning goal, stating, [...] "I decided not to go mad and <b>just</b> <b>pay</b> my respects to the club that gave me my start in the game.
