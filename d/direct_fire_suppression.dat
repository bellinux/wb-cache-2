30|$|Most {{important}} for the region’s rangelands {{as a whole was}} the interruption of the evolutionary fire regime, with widespread fires largely disappearing after 1893 (Swetnam et al. 1999). This was explicit government policy spearheaded by the Forest Service and applied throughout the region. Livestock grazing was probably even more important than <b>direct</b> <b>fire</b> <b>suppression</b> because it reduced standing fine fuel loads and, thereby, inhibited both ignition and spread across vast areas. Stocking rates varied much less than precipitation. In the Chihuahuan desert, annual rainfall is less than 50 % of the long-term average in one year out of two (Herbel and Gibbens 1996). Thus, grazing impacts were most severe during droughts—when fires would have been most likely, and when they had previously been common—effectively ensuring that fires ceased in grazed grassland sites. As artificial waters were installed, {{more and more of the}} landscape fell into this category. By the 1930 s, shrubs had gotten the upper hand over grasses throughout the region. Because mesquites can withstand fire by resprouting from root crowns once they exceed 1 [*]cm in diameter, even 10 – 20 [*]years without fire could set woody encroachment in motion for decades to come, gradually reducing grass production and, in a positive feedback, inhibiting fire further (Sayre 2003).|$|E
40|$|Native plant {{communities}} and ecosystems {{of the western}} United States are increasingly besieged by invasive weeds and grasses ofEurasian origins. Federal land managers over-see 40 millionhain the GreatBasinregion of the western United States. Its valleys are cold desert steppe vegetated by grassy shrub lands; these are interrupted by forested moun-tains. The Great Basin and Columbia Plateau ecoregions (figure 4. 1) together include about one-half of North America's remaining 43 million ha of sagebrush (Artemesia spp.) plant communities (Wisdom et al., 2005). The health and extent of these communities are fast diminishing, with dire consequences for many plant and animal inhabitants. The most charismatic {{of these is the}} sage grouse, but 206 other species warrant con-servation concern (Wisdom et al., 2005). Cheatgrass (smooth brome, Bromlls tectorwn), a flammable aunual grass from the Mediterranean, has invaded 11 million ha of the Great Basin northward into the Columbia Plateau, an area equivalent to that of Cuba, Hungary, or Virginia. Cheatgrass is quite literally fueling a dramatic incre. ase in the fre-quency and extent of wildfire across the region, degrading native plant {{communities and}} presumably their dependent native bee faunas. In Nevada alone, 1, 000 wildfires burned 200, 000 ha of rangeland from 2000 to 2002, half ofit sagebrush communities (Wisdom et al., 2005). Besides <b>direct</b> <b>fire</b> <b>suppression</b> efforts, land managers have also sought to break: this intensified fire cycle by rehabilitating native plant communities, primarily through direct seeding following wildfire (Monsen & Shaw, 2001). This reseeding strat-egy to restore native plant communities on western public rangelands, if successful, may be comparable to fire suppression in cost but will have more enduring habitat value...|$|E
40|$|All {{over the}} world, {{wildfires}} {{have a big}} economic, social and environmental impact. It is expected that climate change will result in more frequent, large, catastrophic wildfires. Responding to these large wildfires is a difficult task with high stakes. Incident management teams (IMTs) managing the response to large, escaped wildfires operate in high-pressure environments where they must make complex, time-critical decisions under fast moving, changing conditions. Past research on providing decision support to IMTs focused on modelling initial attack, fire line construction, pre-incident deployment and longer-term planning. However, on days of extreme fire weather, when large fires are burning in hot, dry and windy conditions, fire suppression may be both ineffective and unsafe. The aim of this thesis is {{to address the problem}} of assigning resources to alternative tasks besides <b>direct</b> <b>fire</b> <b>suppression.</b> A description of the wildfire resource assignment problem is presented. A mixed-integer programming model is formulated to capture features that are unique to the problem of protecting assets during wildfires. The formulated model generalises the team orienteering problem with time windows, allowing for mixed vehicle types, interchangeable and complementary vehicle capabilities, and travel times which are determined by vehicle specific speed and road network information. The protection requirements of locations are defined in terms of vehicle capabilities. Two approaches are presented to deal with the dynamic nature of wildfire planning: a dynamic rerouting approach and a two-stage stochastic programming approach. The rerouting approach is appropriate when disruptions are unexpected. The aim is to reassign vehicle in a manner that minimises changes to current vehicle assignment. The stochastic approach uses likelihood estimates for fire spread scenarios. Initial vehicle assignments are made in the first stage with the opportunity for adjustments in the second stage based on observed fire-weather outcomes. The proposed approaches resulted in a set of complementary models for wildfire resource assignment. They can, among other, account for mixed vehicle capabilities, handle unexpected changes and incorporate fire spread scenario likelihoods. The models are computationally feasible and have the potential to provide real-time decision support to IMTs...|$|E

40|$|Despite {{the huge}} {{resources}} invested in <b>fire</b> <b>suppression,</b> {{the impact of}} wildfires has considerably increased across the Mediterranean region since {{the second half of}} the 20 th century. Modulating <b>fire</b> <b>suppression</b> efforts in mild weather conditions is an appealing but hotly-debated strategy to use unplanned fires and associated fuel reduction to create opportunities for <b>suppression</b> of large <b>fires</b> in future adverse weather conditions. Using a spatially-explicit fire–succession model developed for Catalonia (Spain), we assessed this opportunistic policy by using two <b>fire</b> <b>suppression</b> strategies that reproduce how firefighters in extreme weather conditions exploit previous fire scars as firefighting opportunities. We designed scenarios by combining different levels of <b>fire</b> <b>suppression</b> efficiency and climatic severity for a 50 -year period (2000 – 2050). An opportunistic <b>fire</b> <b>suppression</b> policy induced large-scale changes in fire regimes and decreased the area burnt under extreme climate conditions, but only accounted for up to 18 – 22 % of the area to be burnt in reference scenarios. The area suppressed in adverse years tended to increase in scenarios with increasing amounts of area burnt during years dominated by mild weather. Climate change had counterintuitive effects on opportunistic <b>fire</b> <b>suppression</b> strategies. Climate warming increased the incidence of large fires under uncontrolled conditions but also indirectly increased opportunities for enhanced <b>fire</b> <b>suppression.</b> Therefore, to shift <b>fire</b> <b>suppression</b> opportunities from adverse to mild years, we would require a disproportionately large amount of area burnt in mild years.
