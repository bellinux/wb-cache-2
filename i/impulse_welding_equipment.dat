40|$|The remote <b>welding</b> <b>equipment</b> {{for nuclear}} fuel bundle {{fabrication}} in a hot-cell {{was designed and}} developed. To achieve this, a preliminary investigation of hands-on fuel fabrication outside a hot-cell was conducted with {{a consideration of the}} constraints caused by the welding in a hot-cell. Some basic experiments were also carried out to improve the end-plate welding process for nuclear fuel bundle fabrication. The resistance <b>welding</b> <b>equipment</b> using end-plate <b>welding</b> was also improved. It was found that the remote resistance welding was more suitable for joining an end-plate to end caps in a hot-cell. This paper presents an outline of the developed <b>welding</b> <b>equipment</b> for nuclear fuel bundle fabrication and reviews a conceptual design of remote <b>welding</b> <b>equipment</b> using a master-slave manipulator. Furthermore, the mechanical considerations and a mock-up simulation test were described. Finally, its performance test results were presented for a mock-up of the remote resistance <b>welding</b> <b>equipment</b> for nuclear fuel bundle fabrication...|$|R

40|$|Physical-mechanical {{properties}} and economic analysis of double electrode welding processes have been studied. Thin plate is usually welded using low current whereas <b>welding</b> <b>equipment</b> that {{available in the}} market has a high current capacity. It is not optimum condition because <b>welding</b> <b>equipment</b> is working under its capacity. The largeconstruction manufacturing often {{requires a lot of}} <b>welding</b> <b>equipments.</b> It shows a high investment and maintenance costs. It is important to design the double electrode <b>welding</b> <b>equipment</b> with a single power supply. Austenitic stainless steels SUS 304 and carbon steel SS 400 with thickness of 1. 5 mm were used. Tensile tests, micro/macro structure investigation and distortion measurement were carried out to characterize the weldment. Economic analysis was carried out by calculating welding cost per unit of length. The physical-mechanical evaluations and the economic analysis of single electrode <b>welding</b> <b>equipment</b> were conducted for reference. The results show that the welded joints of the double electrode have the same physical-mechanical properties with that of the single electrode. The welding cost per unit of length is 831. 88 rupiah for a double electrode welding and 936. 69 rupiah for a single electrode. It indicates that the double electrode welding can save 11. 18...|$|R

40|$|The {{competition}} in industrial markets in general has become intense and fierce. Supplier companies are increasingly facing difficulties in differentiating their market offerings {{in the minds}} of customers. New ways of creating competitive advantage are sought after, and the notion of customer value is gaining in importance. It has been recognized that understanding the way in which customers judge and value suppliers' market offerings is crucial for achieving competitive advantage (Graf & Maas 2008, 2). This study contributes to the understanding of customer value in business markets, especially in the Finnish <b>welding</b> <b>equipment</b> market. It provides valuable practical implications for <b>welding</b> <b>equipment</b> suppliers about chances to benefit of the customer value concept when striving for competitive advantage. This study applies general theories of competitive advantage and customer value in business markets. The {{purpose of this study is}} to explore and to analyze customer value drivers in the Finnish <b>welding</b> <b>equipment</b> market, and to discuss how these value drivers relate to the competitive advantage of <b>welding</b> <b>equipment</b> suppliers. A customer value approach is used in order to assess by which means a supplier's market offering can best meet customers' requirements. A qualitative approach was used to conduct this study. The data was gathered in 13 semi-structured phone interviews with <b>welding</b> <b>equipment</b> buyers from various fields of engineering. The data was analyzed in relation to the existing theory, relying on the notion that customer value is a subjectively perceived, multidimensional construct. During the analysis, it was identified that customer value in the Finnish <b>welding</b> <b>equipment</b> market consists of 16 different value drivers which can be categorized under economic, product-related, service-related and relational benefits. Customer companies, however, have diversified preferences and requirements guiding their selection of <b>welding</b> <b>equipment</b> suppliers. The most difficult task for a supplier is to decide which value elements and which customer segments to concentrate on. Based on the analysis, the key to achieve competitive advantage in the Finnish <b>welding</b> <b>equipment</b> market is on identifying the service gaps and providing customers with improved service and relational benefits. The chances for a supplier to succeed in competition can be increased by providing service elements for those customers that currently lack it and making the interactions personal.

40|$|Abstract — In {{order to}} realize {{underwater}} automatic welding {{in deep water}} environment, an automatic <b>welding</b> <b>equipment,</b> which is composed of truss structure, welding mechanism and mobile walking mechanism was designed and tested in the recent research. The bent fatigue strength check was carried on the driving part of the system. High-pressure chamber was used to simulate the high pressure deep water environment. Test of the automatic <b>welding</b> <b>equipment</b> test was conducted by the flux core arc welding(FCAW) in pressure chamber under hydrostatic pressure about 30 - 200 meters of water depth. Arc voltage and welding current were recorded during the welding tests. Visual inspection was also conducted on the weld. According to the above tests results, it was shown that the automatic <b>welding</b> <b>equipment</b> works stably and credibly, and the apperance of weld was excellence. It was concluded that this equipment can satisfy the requirements of underwater automatic welding in high-pressure underwater environment.
