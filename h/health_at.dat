5|$|Mega Man 2 {{features}} a few gameplay changes {{from the original}} Mega Man. A new item, the Energy Tank, allows a player to refill Mega Man’s <b>health</b> <b>at</b> any time.

Reyes helped deliver the child, and made a permanent move soon afterwards, becoming Doggett's partner on The X-Files.|$|E
5|$|As Leader of the New South Wales Liberal Party and Leader of the Opposition, Morton had {{to direct}} the {{campaign}} for the upcoming election in early 1956. At the official campaign launch on 15 February, Morton began by accusing the Cahill government of losing its way and wasting public funds, while promising to invest in public works, education and <b>health.</b> <b>At</b> the election on 3 March 1956, the Liberals gained five seats (Coogee, Drummoyne, Georges River, Parramatta and Sutherland) and the Country Party under Michael Bruxner regained the seat of Armidale, reducing the government's majority from twenty to six. Morton retained Mosman with 78.74%. Although the Coalition had failed to win government, an official report from the Liberal Party State Council blamed the defeat on the seat redistribution, the abolition of postal voting and the strong right-wing Labor support for Premier Cahill.|$|E

5|$|The {{discovery}} of oil on her family's cotton plantation made Hogg very wealthy, {{and she used}} this income to benefit the people of Texas. In 1929, she founded the Houston Child Guidance Center, which provides counseling for children with mental health problems or diagnoses and their families. Through her brother's will, she established the Hogg Foundation for Mental <b>Health</b> <b>at</b> the University of Texas at Austin in 1940. Hogg successfully ran for {{a seat on the}} Houston School Board in 1943, where she worked to remove gender and race as criteria for determining pay and established art education programs for black students. Hogg never married, and died in 1975. The Ima Hogg Foundation was the major beneficiary of her will, and carries on her philanthropic work today. Several annual awards have been established in her name, honoring her efforts to preserve cultural heritage in Texas.|$|E
5|$|Thunderball {{begins with}} a meeting between Bond and his superior, M, during which the agent is told that his latest {{physical}} assessment is poor because of excessive drinking and smoking (up to sixty cigarettes a day). M sends Bond on a two-week treatment at the Shrublands health clinic to improve his <b>health.</b> <b>At</b> the clinic Bond encounters Count Lippe, {{a member of the}} Red Lightning Tong criminal organisation from Macau. When Bond learns of the Tong connection, Lippe tries to kill him by tampering with a spinal traction machine. Bond, however, is saved by nurse Patricia Fearing and later retaliates against Lippe by trapping him in a steam bath, resulting in the Count's second-degree burns and a week's stay in hospital.|$|E
5|$|Vladimir Lenin {{was voted}} the Chairman of the Council of People's Commissars of the USSR (Sovnarkom) on 30 December 1922 by the Congress of Soviets. His <b>health,</b> <b>at</b> {{the age of}} 53, {{declined}} from effects of two bullet wounds, later aggravated by three strokes which culminated with his death in 1924. Irrespective of his health status in his final days, Lenin was already losing much of his power to Stalin. Alexei Rykov succeeded Lenin as Chairman of the Sovnarkom, and although he was de jure the most powerful person in the country, the Politburo of the Communist Party began to overshadow the Sovnarkom in the mid-1920s. By {{the end of the}} decade, Rykov merely rubber stamped the decisions predetermined by Stalin and the Politburo.|$|E

5|$|Walker {{returned}} to North Brookfield to recuperate and resigned his commission on January 8, 1865, {{as a result}} of his injuries and <b>health.</b> <b>At</b> the end of the war, Maj. Gen. Winfield Scott Hancock recommended that Walker be brevetted as a brigadier general of U.S. Volunteers in recognition of his meritorious services during the war and especially his gallant conduct at Chancellorsville. On July 9, 1866, Walker was nominated by President Andrew Johnson for the award of the honorary grade of brevet brigadier general, U.S. Volunteers, to rank from March 13, 1865 (when he was age 24), for gallant conduct at the battle of Chancellorsville and meritorious services during the war. The U.S. Senate confirmed the award on July 23, 1866.|$|E
5|$|In {{his first}} 12appearances of 2009, Rivera {{surrendered}} four {{home runs and}} had a 3.97ERA, leading to speculation about his cutter's effectiveness and his shoulder's <b>health</b> <b>at</b> age 39. As the season progressed, his numbers improved, and he reached a milestone on June28 by becoming the second pitcher with 500regular season saves. In the same game, while batting against fellow closer Francisco Rodríguez, he collected his first career run batted in by walking with the bases loaded. With 23saves in 24opportunities and a 2.43ERA in the season's first half, Rivera was named an All-Star for the tenth time. At the 2009 MLB All-Star Game, he set a record by saving his fourth career All-Star Game. In the season's second half, Rivera allowed earned runs in only two of his final 40appearances, while he set a new personal best for consecutive save opportunities converted with 36. He finished the regular season with a 1.76ERA, 44saves in 46opportunities, and a 0.90WHIP. In the postseason, he pitched 16innings, allowing one earned run and saving five games, and he clinched the Yankees' victory in the 2009 World Series against the Philadelphia Phillies—his fifth championship. He was the only closer who did not record a loss or blown save that postseason. Rivera collected several awards at season's end, including his third Delivery Man Award, his fifth AL Rolaids Relief Man Award, and the 2009 Sporting News Pro Athlete of the Year Award. Reflecting on the decade's end, ESPN.com's Jerry Crasnick called Rivera the most valuable major league pitcher of the previous 10 years.|$|E
5|$|The {{end of the}} 2008 {{athletics}} season saw Bolt {{compete in}} the ÅF Golden League, beginning in Weltklasse Zürich. Despite having the slowest start among his competitors in the 100 m race, he still crossed the finishing line in 9.83 s. Even though the time was slower than both his newly set world record and Asafa Powell's track record, it was still among the top-fifteen 100 m finishes by any sprinter to that date. Bolt admitted {{that he was not}} running at full strength, suffering from a cold, but he had concentrated on both winning the race and finishing the season in good <b>health.</b> <b>At</b> the Super Grand Prix final in Lausanne, Bolt ran his second-fastest 200 m with a time of 19.63 s, equalling Xavier Carter's track record. However, it was the 100 m final, featuring Asafa Powell, that drew the most interest. Powell had moved closer to Bolt's world record after setting a new personal best of 9.72 s, reaffirming his status as Bolt's main contender. Bolt's final event of the season came three days later at the Golden League final in Brussels. This was the first 100 m race featuring both Bolt and Powell since the final in the Olympics. Both Jamaicans broke the track record, but Bolt came out on top with a time of 9.77 s, beating Powell by 0.06 s. Victory, however, did not come as smoothly as it had in Beijing. Bolt made the slowest start of the nine competitors and had to recover ground in cold conditions and against a 0.9m/s headwind. Yet the results confirmed Jamaican dominance in the 100 m, with nine of the ten-fastest legal times in history being recorded by either Bolt or Powell.|$|E
