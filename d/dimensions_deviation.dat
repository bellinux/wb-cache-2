40|$|This thesis {{presents}} six optimization models {{which are}} developed and solved in two stages {{in order to}} integrate tolerancing and machining parameters decisions. One model is developed in the first stage. The first-stage model is related to a design problem and provides better part tolerance {{to be used in}} the second stage to incorporate tool adjustment decisions into the optimization of machining parameters. Five models are developed in the second stage and are divided into single-machine and multi-machine turning operation problems. For single-machine turning operations, three models are formulated. The first is a single-product multi-pass model considering pass selection for determining optimum cutting speed, feed rate, depth of cut, <b>dimension</b> <b>deviation</b> and number of passes. The second is a single-product multi-pass model considering inventory and setup costs to find optimum cutting speed, feed rate, depth of cut, <b>dimension</b> <b>deviation</b> and batch size. The third is a multi-product multi-pass model considering inventory and setup costs for selection of optimum cutting speed, feed rate, depth of cut, <b>dimension</b> <b>deviations</b> and production cycle time. For multi-machine turning operations, two models are formulated. One is a multi-feature multi-pass model with the objective of minimizing total cost for determining optimum workload assignment, cutting speed, feed rate, depth of cut, and feature <b>dimension</b> <b>deviations</b> of machine-pass-feature combinations. The second is a multi-feature multi-pass model with the objective of minimizing cycle time which, once solved, will give optimum workload assignment, cutting speed, feed rate, depth of cut, and feature <b>dimension</b> <b>deviations</b> of machine-pass-feature combinations. A solution method and illustrative examples are given to test the feasibility of the developed optimization models. (Abstract shortened by UMI. ...|$|R

Geometric and transport characteristics of the hopping resistor network are shown to depend on temperature T and the dimensionality of the system.

40|$|AbstractThe high {{precision}} requirements of complex mechanical product (CMP) results in that its processing often contains multiple stages. When part was processed and transmitted in multiple stages, dimensional variation of part will be accumulated, coupling and transformed as well. Since the {{high precision}} {{requirements of the}} CMP, there are more process parameters impacted the machining errors than general multistage process, and more diverse process parameters {{should be considered in}} CMP's processing. To describe machining variation propagation process accurately and effectively, the variation propagation model for CMP processing was proposed. Firstly, the parts and fixtures in CMP processing are described by differential motion vector based on the robot's kinematics principle, and the change of theirs space pose are obtained by homogeneous transformation. Then, the fixture-induced variation, datum-induced variation, machining-induced variation and cutting-tool wear induced variation are analyzed and derived. The machining-induced variation is the <b>dimension</b> <b>deviation</b> produced by cutting force impacting on part's machining surfaces, and the cutting-tool wear induced variation is mainly caused by tool's normal wear. Lastly, the coupling relationship of datum-induced variation, fixture-induced variation, machining-induced variation and cutting-tool wear induced variation of each process stage is described, and the state space model of variation propagation is developed. The relationship of dimensional variation from all work stages and all kinds of variations is explored. By a real case study, feasibility and effectiveness of the model is validated. The model has great potential to be applied in the fault diagnosis, root cause identification of variation, sensor placement optimization, variation simulation, machining parameter and fixture design and optimization in quality control and improvement of complex product...|$|R

40|$|Reconstruction of MRI data {{is based}} on exact {{knowledge}} of all magnetic field dynamics, since the interplay of RF and gradient pulses generates the signal, defines the contrast and forms the basis of resolution in spatial and spectral <b>dimensions.</b> <b>Deviations</b> caused by various sources, such as system imperfections, delays, eddy currents, drifts or externally induced fields, can therefore critically limit the accuracy of MRI examinations. This is true especially at ultra-high fields, because many error terms scale with the main field strength, and higher available SNR renders even smaller errors relevant. Higher baseline field also often requires higher acquisition bandwidths and faster signal encoding, increasing hardware demands and the severity of many types of hardware imperfection. To address field imperfections comprehensively, in this work we propose to expand the concept of magnetic field monitoring to also encompass the recording of RF fields. In this way, all dynamic magnetic fields relevant for spin evolution are covered, including low- to audio-frequency magnetic fields as produced by main magnets, gradients and shim systems, as well as RF pulses generated with single- and multiple-channel transmission systems. The proposed approach permits field measurements concurrently with actual MRI procedures on a strict common time base. The combined measurement is achieved {{with an array of}} miniaturized field probes that measure low- to audio-frequency fields via 19 F NMR and simultaneously pick up RF pulses in the MRI system's 1 H transmit band. Field recordings can form the basis of system calibration, retrospective correction of imaging data or closed-loop feedback correction, all of which hold potential to render MRI more robust and relax hardware requirements. The proposed approach is demonstrated for a range of imaging methods performed on a 7 [*]T human MRI system, including accelerated multiple-channel RF pulses.

The dynamics is discussed within a Rouse-Zimm approach generalized to the case of starlike dendrimers of arbitrary geometry.

40|$|In this work, {{the effect}} of various lithographic {{parameters}} on the produced sidewall roughness of the printed structures on photoresist films, is studied through simulation. The parameters include the size and {{the architecture of the}} photoresist, the film structure, the energy distribution in the film {{as a result of the}} exposure as well as the diffusion of the photochemically produced acid, with or without the presence of quencher molecules in the film. For this study, a new simulator has been developed that uses stochastic models for all the major lithographic steps. Modeling of the photoresist’s molecular structure can be done either at monomer level (in the case of polymers), or at a more detailed level for a more accurate representation of the monomers/molecules. The main drawback of most commercial lithography simulators is the absence of a model for the structure of the photoresist, something that is of crucial importance for the study of {{the effect of}} the process and the material on sidewall roughness. Additionally, in the present study, a way to integrate the new stochastic models for the description of the photoresist structure into the pipeline of other (commercial) simulators is presented. The results of the study show that as the size of the photoresist molecules decreases, the sidewall roughness decreases. Additionally, decrease of the diffusion length of the photochemically produced acid results in greater control of the critical <b>dimension</b> <b>deviation.</b> Those results have been observed for both polymeric and molecular resists. Comparison between polymeric and molecular resists, with similar radius of gyration, showed that the latter can give better (smaller) sidewall roughness. One more parameter studied was the photoacid generator (PAG) concentration in the photoresist film, both as a blend with the resin and as part of the polymeric resin molecules. The latter configuration showed better results with respect to sidewall roughness, mainly due to the reduced diffusion of the acid molecules and the increased sensitivity of the material. Those results showed good agreement with published experimental results, regarding the trend on the reduction of roughness. Experimental results showed that in the case where the PAG is blended with the polymeric resin, the roughness measure was almost two times the roughness of the case where the PAG molecules were part of the polymeric chains. Three dimensional simulations of both cases (with identical PAG concentrations and molecular weights of the polymeric chains) showed sidewall roughness of 3 nm and 2 nm respectively. ...|$|R

30|$|In the {{derivation}} of Eq. (18), {{the assumption}} of bundle of parallel capillary tubes with varying radii was the basis. However, in reality, the effect of overburden compaction in the sedimentary column and the attendant pressure solution effect (Yang 2000) suggest real sediments will have significant levels of tortuosity. This means the parameter, DT, corresponding to the tortuosity fractal dimension, which measures the convolutedness of the capillary path ways in Eq. (4) is an essential parameter. What is more, the effect of sediment deformation under stress heterogeneity and grain size evolution (Iverson et al. 1996) is to cause collapse of original large pore spaces leading to varied pore size distribution, which causes higher fractal dimensions or heterogeneities. In the published work of Zhang and Weller (2014), (Table 6 in Appendix 1), {{the age of the}} formation is Eocene and the original depths of the samples are between 3332 and 3738 meters. Under such overburden conditions, the tortuosity factor of the sediment cannot be neglected. Therefore, any model that neglects tortuosity will obviously calculate fractal dimensions different from actual or expected values. That is why our assumption of bundle of parallel capillary tubes without tortuosity has led to calculated fractal <b>dimensions</b> with <b>deviation,</b> though values of calculated fractal dimensions fall within those expected for sandstones.|$|R
