2500|$|The first Chinese {{historical}} archive {{also recorded}} that on 4 September 1730 AD (on the lunar calendar), Tian Wenjing, {{governor of the}} Eastern River, fell ill. Emperor Yongzheng sent a royal doctor to visit and provided him with 200g of GuilingJi. In red calligraphy it was written: [...] "Please try your best to recover. You should have told me sooner. Why are you looking all over? <b>Here</b> <b>is</b> <b>your</b> reward.” Imperial records show that Emperor Yongzheng usually rewarded ministers with only 5g of GuilingJi. By rewarding Tian Wenjing with not only 200g, but also the original GuilingJi prescription it showed the emperor highly valued Tian Wenjing.|$|E

President Maduro signed a decree creating the Human Rights Council, {{with the aim of}} [...] "fully enforcing the Venezuelans' human rights".

Collect the signatures, if you get enough of them, then we're calling a referendum in 2016". Colectivos entered into the UCV, and a student was undressed and beaten by these groups.|$|E
2500|$|Retreating {{from public}} life during World War II and the Ion Antonescu {{dictatorship}} (see Romania during World War II), Argetoianu {{left the country}} in the spring of 1944, settling in Switzerland. Romania's withdrawal from the Axis and the start of Soviet occupation caused him to return in November, seeing an opportunity in the apparent decrease in the appeal of traditional parties and expanding on his vision of Romanian-Soviet cooperation. He was the subject of derision in the National Peasants' Party press (Dreptatea wrote of him: [...] "leading the intrigue in favor of a private property–based communism, a capitalist-based socialism, a mass-free democracy... The country is trustingly placing itself at your disposal. Here are your strings: pull them! Here are your back rooms: maneuver them! <b>Here</b> <b>is</b> <b>your</b> «people»: take it away!").|$|E

2500|$|Several {{incidents}} in the Genesis narrative demonstrate that adultery was understood to be a natural phenomenon. [...] These occur in the times of the Patriarchs over a span of about 200 years, the last one occurring more than 400 years before the giving of the law through Moses. In Genesis 12, Abram’s wife Sarai is taken into the Egyptian Pharaoh’s palace after Abram does not disclose her marital status. God inflicts “serious diseases on Pharaoh and his whole household.” Pharaoh realizes it is because Sarai is actually Abram’s wife and tells him, [...] "What is this you have done to me? Why did you not tell {{me that she was}} your wife? Why did you say, 'She is my sister,' so that I took her for my wife? Now then, <b>here</b> <b>is</b> <b>your</b> wife; take her, and go." ...|$|E
2500|$|On March 7, 2007, Rosselló {{stated that}} he was no longer {{interested}} in the Senate Presidency and then focused his attention in preventing Resident Commissioner Luis Fortuño from winning the March 2008 gubernatorial primary, and allowed his name to be placed in nomination for the party's gubernatorial primary. McClintock and four other senators won in San Juan Superior Court a suit to nullify the sanctions and expulsions that the party leadership has levied against them. The Puerto Rico Supreme Court confirmed the lower court decision by a 5-to-1 vote. As a result, McClintock and his supporters were recognized as NPP members and free to run under the party banner. [...] Shortly after the primary polls closed on March 9, 2008, Pedro Rosselló conceded the victory to Luis Fortuño after a large margin of votes in favor of his opponent in the NPP party primaries for the presidency of the party and gubernatorial nomination. Rosselló admitted defeat even before the votes were completely tallied claiming Fortuño as the next candidate of the PNP party. In Rosselló's conceding speech he said [...] "Luis Fortuño has been selected by the people to be the new president of this party and the candidate for governor. I always say the people speak and I obey, Fortuño <b>here</b> <b>is</b> <b>your</b> party and <b>here</b> <b>is</b> <b>your</b> office (signaling the party's official headquarters). Now it's up to you, the loyal members of this party, {{to make sure that this}} new leadership works for statehood for Puerto Rico". After this conceding speech it was rumored and even announced at Fortuño's headquarters that the former Governor would arrive there along with his loyal supporter and mayor of the capital city of San Juan, Jorge Santini, but after Fortuño's followers waited for hours to see their leaders united neither Rosselló or Santini arrived. After the primary was over it was heavily rumored by many that Rosselló would not be campaigning for Fortuño and that he'd resign as senator to go back to his home in Virginia. On March 10, 2008, Rosselló sent the media a written statement regarding his future in which he confirmed he will be retiring from active politics and will not be campaigning for any candidate, however he would finish his term as senator for the Arecibo District, which he did.|$|E
