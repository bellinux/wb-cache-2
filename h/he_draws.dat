5|$|The {{game was}} envisioned {{to take full}} {{advantage}} of the hardware, without the imposition of porting to older platforms like the PlayStation 3. The hardware let developers improve the particle system that lights Delsin's face up while <b>he</b> <b>draws</b> neon power from billboards and add detailed reflections to the game world. The increased memory bandwidth let the team render characters with higher fidelity. They found the PS4's simplified architecture so easy to work with that they were able to reach very high graphical quality even though the hardware was new.|$|E
5|$|When Tosca arrives {{looking for}} her lover, Scarpia artfully arouses her jealous {{instincts}} by implying {{a relationship between the}} painter and the Marchesa Attavanti. <b>He</b> <b>draws</b> Tosca's attention to the fan and suggests that someone must have surprised the lovers in the chapel. Tosca falls for his deceit; enraged, she rushes off to confront Cavaradossi. Scarpia orders Spoletta and his agents to follow her, assuming she will lead them to Cavaradossi and Angelotti. He privately gloats as he reveals his intentions to possess Tosca and execute Cavaradossi. A procession enters the church singing the Te Deum; exclaiming 'Tosca, you make me forget even God!', Scarpia joins the chorus in the prayer.|$|E
5|$|Joehana {{appears to}} have been {{familiar}} with the traditional literatures of Maritime Southeast Asia, drawing on the Ramayana for Nangis Wibisana. Wayang characters such as the clown Cepot are referred to in his writings, and <b>he</b> <b>draws</b> on traditional Sundanese storytelling techniques, such as the pantun form of poetry common in wayang golek performances. However, there are significant shifts. His writings depart from the traditional forms of literature such as wawacan, instead embracing the novel, a European literary form. Unlike the formal language used in traditional literature, Joehana wrote in everyday Sundanese. The grammar and structure shows evidence of influence from other languages, and the vocabulary is likewise not purely Sundanese; some Dutch (the language of the colonial government) is mixed in.|$|E

5|$|More detail for {{the whole}} period is {{provided}} by Plutarch, in his biographies of Themistocles, Aristides and especially Cimon. Plutarch was writing some 600 years after the events in question, and is therefore a secondary source, but he often names his sources, which allows some degree of verification of his statements. In his biographies, <b>he</b> <b>draws</b> directly from many ancient histories that have not survived, and thus often preserves details of the period that are omitted in Herodotus and Thucydides's accounts. The final major existing source for the period is the universal history (Bibliotheca historica) of the 1st century BC Sicilian, Diodorus Siculus. Much of Diodorus's writing about this period is drawn from the much earlier Greek historian Ephorus, who also wrote a universal history. Diodorus is also a secondary source and often derided by modern historians for his style and inaccuracies, but he preserves many details of the ancient period found nowhere else.|$|E
5|$|The {{composer}} Sergei Rachmaninoff {{produced a}} number of solo piano pieces that were either lost, unpublished, or not assigned an opus number. While often disregarded in the concert repertoire, they are nevertheless part of his oeuvre. He composed sixteen such pieces, and all others are lost. Ten of these pieces were composed before he completed his Piano Concerto No. 1, his first opus, and the rest interspersed throughout his later life. In these casual works, <b>he</b> <b>draws</b> upon the influence of other composers, including Frédéric Chopin and Pyotr Tchaikovsky. The more substantial works, the Three Nocturnes and Four Pieces, are sets of well-thought out pieces that are his first attempts at cohesive structure among multiple pieces. Oriental Sketch and Prelude in D minor, two pieces he composed very late in his life, are short works that exemplify his style as a mature composer. Whether completed as a child or adult, these pieces cover {{a wide spectrum of}} forms while maintaining his characteristic Russian style.|$|E
5|$|William Legrand has {{relocated}} from New Orleans to Sullivan's Island in South Carolina {{after losing}} his family fortune, and has brought his African-American servant Jupiter with him. The story's narrator, {{a friend of}} Legrand, visits him one evening to see an unusual scarab-like bug he has found. The bug's weight and lustrous appearance convince Jupiter that it is made of pure gold. Legrand has lent it to an officer stationed at a nearby fort, but <b>he</b> <b>draws</b> a sketch of it for the narrator, with markings on the carapace that resemble a skull. As they discuss the bug, Legrand becomes particularly focused on the sketch and carefully locks it in his desk for safekeeping. Confused, the narrator takes his leave for the night.|$|E
5000|$|When Braunsdorf {{designed}} the street layout, the only existing streets were Pearl Street and Washington Avenue. <b>He</b> <b>drew</b> a wide main street {{through the middle}} of town and called it Central Avenue.

25|$|As senior pastor, Osteen says <b>he</b> <b>draws</b> no salary {{from the}} church, {{which has an}} annual budget of $70 million. Instead, he relies on income from book sales. Much of the content for his best sellers come from sermons he has preached at Lakewood.|$|E
25|$|Colin draws {{pictures}} with a marker on white poster-sized paper {{to illustrate a}} concept to encapsulate his opinion about {{the stories of the}} day. After <b>he</b> <b>draws</b> the pictures, Charissa critiques his drawings and the audience cheers if they like his drawing and jeers or remains silent if their reaction is negative.|$|E

25|$|The {{first player}} moves {{the number of}} spaces along the track {{according}} to a dial spin. If the player lands on a pink star, his turn ends. If he lands on a yellow star, <b>he</b> <b>draws</b> a card and follows its instruction. If <b>he</b> <b>draws</b> a picture card, he retains it face down at his place. If a player spins a six, he is given the choice of moving six spaces or taking a magic wand. He may play the wand {{at any time during}} the game and in doing so draws two cards, following their instructions. A player must hold three different picture cards before entering the Path of Happiness. If he does not hold three picture cards, he continues around the Deep Sleep circle until he acquires the required three picture cards. Should a player land on a purple Maleficent space, that player returns one of his picture cards to the deck.|$|E
25|$|Meanwhile, Cupid's wound has healed into a scar, and he escapes his mother's {{house by}} flying out a window.

25|$|In {{his book}} Racializing Jesus, Shawn Kelley {{states that the}} {{assignment}} of a specific race to Jesus has been a cultural phenomenon emanating from the higher levels of intellectual circles within societies, and <b>he</b> <b>draws</b> parallels between the seemingly different approaches within different settings. Cain Hope Felder has argued that New Testament passages such as Galatians 3:28 express a universalism that goes beyond race, ethnicity or even religion.|$|E
25|$|Tacitus's {{political}} career was largely lived {{out under the}} emperor Domitian. His experience of the tyranny, corruption, and decadence of that era (8196) may explain the bitterness and irony of his political analysis. <b>He</b> <b>draws</b> {{our attention to the}} dangers of power without accountability, love of power untempered by principle, and the apathy and corruption engendered by the concentration of wealth generated through trade and conquest by the empire.|$|E
25|$|On Surgery and Instruments is an {{illustrated}} surgical guide written by Al-Zahrawi. On Surgery and Instruments contributed many technological innovations, notably which tools {{to use in}} specific surgeries.

He abandons the horse and gets into the boat, discovering {{that it has no}} oars or sail. He unfurls the French flag from Ajaccio and uses it as a sail. He is drawn out into the open sea.|$|E
25|$|Concerning {{the longest}} passage of anapaestic septenarii (Miles Gloriosus 1011-93), Moore notes the close {{resemblance}} between the metre {{in this passage}} and trochaic septenarii. The German classicist Marcus Deufert notes that the style of writing in these lines {{is different from the}} usual anapaests, in that it is more regular and there are more long syllables. <b>He</b> <b>draws</b> the conclusion that the lines from Miles Gloriosus were recited {{in the same way as}} trochaic septenarii, while other anapaestic passages (which usually contain an admixture of other metres) were sung.|$|E
