5|$|Ardhanarishvara {{is one of}} {{the most}} popular {{iconographic}} forms of Shiva. It is found in more or less all temples and shrines dedicated to Shiva all over India and South-east Asia. There is ample evidence from texts and the multiple depictions of the Ardhanarishvara in stone to suggest that a cult centred around the deity may have existed. The cult may have had occasional followers, but was never aligned to any sect. This cult focusing on the joint worship of Shiva and the Goddess may even have had a high position in Hinduism, but when and how it faded away remains a mystery. Though a popular iconographic form, temples dedicated to the deity are few. A popular one is located in Thiruchengode, while <b>five</b> <b>others</b> are located in Kallakkurichi taluk, all of them in the Indian state of Tamil Nadu.|$|E
