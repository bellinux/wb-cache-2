50|$|The {{church was}} to be laid out in three {{distinct}} parts, corresponding to the three divisions of the tabernacle or the Temple in Jerusalem. The nave {{would be for the}} congregation, then slightly elevated by a step or two the chancel for the priests and deacons (deacons sitting in cross benches at the entrance and priests along the sides). The third part, slightly elevated again with regard to the chancel and separated from it by a low barrier with a gate, was the sanctuary. Communion would be distributed to the faithful kneeling at this barrier, the ministrant being inside the sanctuary. The sanctuary contained the altar, placed centrally against the wall or <b>dividing</b> <b>partition,</b> and usually elevated on a pedestal.|$|E
50|$|A {{party wall}} (occasionally parti-wall or parting wall, {{also known as}} common wall) is a <b>dividing</b> <b>partition</b> between two {{adjoining}} buildings (or units) that is shared by the tenants of each residence or business. When built for this purpose, the builder will lay the wall along a property line dividing two terraced flats or row houses, so that {{one half of the}} wall's thickness lies on each property. This type of wall is usually structural. Party walls can also be formed by two abutting walls built at different times. The term can be also used to describe a division between separate units within a multi-unit apartment complex. Very often the wall in this case is non-structural but designed to meet established criteria for sound and/or fire protection between residential units.|$|E

The fields, tennis courts, schoolyards and the main school buildings are not shared. There is a shared swimming pool used separately by boys and girls. The sixth form block is a shared facility in which the top floor is occupied by girls, and the ground floor {{is used by the}} boys' school. A joint sports hall is used by both boys and girls with a separation barrier.

40|$|Abstract. The {{combination}} of Further Division of Partition Space (FDPS) and Flexible Neural Tree (FNT) is {{proposed to improve}} the neural net-work classification performance. FDPS, which <b>divide</b> <b>partition</b> space into many partitions that will attach to different classes automatically, is a novel technique for neural network classification. FNT is a neural net-work’s structure which uses flexible tree model. The proposed method combines the advantages of these two methods and improves the capabil-ity. In order to evaluate the performance of this method, the Wisconsin breast cancer data set was used for classification test. Experiment re-sults have shown that this method has favorable performance especially {{with respect to the}} optimization speed, the training accuracy and the accuracy of classified samples.
