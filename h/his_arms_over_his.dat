60|$|But {{the strange}} man who stood before him folded <b>his</b> <b>arms</b> <b>over</b> <b>his</b> breast.|$|E
60|$|Father Benwell folded <b>his</b> <b>arms</b> <b>over</b> <b>his</b> breast--looked with {{immovable}} resolution {{straight in}} Romayne's face--and struck the blow {{which he had}} been meditating for months past.|$|E
60|$|With <b>his</b> <b>arms</b> <b>over</b> <b>his</b> face, {{he pushed}} forward once more, not knowing whether {{he might be}} {{retracing}} his steps, or proceeding in the proper direction.|$|E
60|$|And {{there on}} the landing she saw him {{standing}} in the darkness with <b>his</b> <b>arm</b> <b>over</b> <b>his</b> face, as if fending a blow.|$|R
6000|$|... "Because I can't bear to cut Hal out!" [...] said Sam, putting <b>his</b> <b>arm</b> <b>over</b> <b>his</b> eyes, {{as a way}} he {{considered}} secret of disposing of his tears.|$|R
6000|$|The doctor pulled <b>his</b> <b>arm</b> <b>over</b> <b>his</b> {{eyes and}} sat down again. Presently he was saying with a long face: [...] "I came here to {{denounce}} the cause of your unhappiness, and I begin to see it is myself." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Phew! but aint it cold!" [...] exclaimed Tom, {{dancing around}} and {{slapping}} <b>his</b> <b>arms</b> <b>over</b> <b>his</b> chest. [...] "I wonder how Nellie and Grace Laning like this?" ...|$|E
60|$|Maurice paused: once more, with {{a gesture}} {{habitual}} to him, he crossed <b>his</b> <b>arms</b> <b>over</b> <b>his</b> chest and resumed his restless march {{up and down the}} narrow room.|$|E
6000|$|To the {{surprise}} of the Interpreter, Mark Breezy crossed <b>his</b> <b>arms</b> <b>over</b> <b>his</b> breast, and firmly said--"No!" [...] Swiftly understanding his motive, our seaman and Ebony followed suit with an equally emphatic, [...] "No!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Don't lie on {{that cold}} stone, Ben; {{come here and}} {{let me try to}} comfort you," [...] she said, stooping to wipe away the great drops that kept rolling down the brown cheek half hidden in her dress. But Ben put <b>his</b> <b>arm</b> <b>over</b> <b>his</b> face, and sobbed out with a fresh burst of grief,-- ...|$|R
60|$|She wasted as {{much time}} as {{possible}} in the shops, then they took the tram home again. Ciccio paid the three fares, laying his hand restrainingly on Gigi's hand, when Gigi's hand sought pence in his trouser pocket, and throwing <b>his</b> <b>arm</b> <b>over</b> <b>his</b> friend's shoulder, in affectionate but vulgar triumph, when the fares were paid. Alvina was on her high horse.|$|R
6000|$|... "By these ten finger-bones! {{there were}} some fine bowmen at the intaking of Calais," [...] said Aylward. [...] "I well {{remember}} that, on occasion of an outfall, a Genoan raised <b>his</b> <b>arm</b> <b>over</b> <b>his</b> mantlet, and shook it at us, a hundred paces from our line. There were twenty who loosed shafts at him, and when the man was afterwards slain {{it was found that}} he had taken eighteen through his forearm." ...|$|R
60|$|Paul Ruttledge. Many will forsake {{the truth}} {{before the world}} is pulled down. [Stretching out <b>his</b> <b>arms</b> <b>over</b> <b>his</b> head.] I pulled down my own house, now I go out to pull down the world.|$|E
60|$|FERRAND. [Brushing <b>his</b> <b>arms</b> <b>over</b> <b>his</b> eyes.] Pardon, Monsieur--your goodness--I am {{a little}} weak. [He opens his coat, and shows a belt drawn very tight over his ragged shirt.] I tighten him one hole for each meal, during two days now. That gives you courage.|$|E
60|$|Martin-Roget crossed <b>his</b> <b>arms</b> <b>over</b> <b>his</b> broad {{chest and}} {{clutched}} his elbows {{with his hands}} with an obvious effort to keep control over his movements and his temper in check. The quiet, almost indifferent attitude of the girl was exasperating to his over-strung nerves.|$|E
50|$|Also, {{no matter}} the situation, he is shown to be rather inexpressive, never {{changing}} his stoic expression. However, when he re-injures <b>his</b> <b>arm</b> during <b>his</b> match against Keigo Atobe, he is shown to writhe in pain. This becomes a traumatic memory which makes him unable to lift <b>his</b> <b>arm</b> <b>over</b> <b>his</b> shoulders, fearing the thought of feeling that pain again. He learns to overcome this during his medical retreat in Kyūshū. Due to his experiences, he dislikes those who use tennis to harm others.|$|R
5000|$|Mummy C3 is male. He {{was found}} with <b>his</b> <b>arms</b> crossed <b>over</b> <b>his</b> chest {{in the manner of}} a King, 18-25 years old. 175 cm long (5'8") ...|$|R
60|$|And so {{lay down}} upon his bed, and put <b>his</b> <b>arms</b> up, <b>over</b> <b>his</b> head and ears, as {{resolute}} {{from that time}} to keep out all access, and to die in his indifference.|$|R
60|$|But {{they were}} not yet done with the shore and {{the horror of the}} yellow flag. About midway of the pass there was a cry and a scurry, a man was seen to leap upon the rail, and, {{throwing}} <b>his</b> <b>arms</b> <b>over</b> <b>his</b> head, to stoop and plunge into the sea.|$|E
60|$|I {{slid down}} the rubbish, {{struggled}} to my feet, clapped my hands over my ears, and bolted into the scullery. The curate, who had been crouching silently with <b>his</b> <b>arms</b> <b>over</b> <b>his</b> head, looked up as I passed, cried out quite loudly at my desertion of him, and came running after me.|$|E
60|$|Then {{a sudden}} thought seemed to strike him, he threw back his head, gave a short laugh {{as if he}} were pleased with this new thought, then turned, meeting Mistress de Chavasse's stern gaze {{squarely}} and fully. He threw his hat down upon the steps and crossed <b>his</b> <b>arms</b> <b>over</b> <b>his</b> chest.|$|E
60|$|The horses of both {{guests were}} brought forth; and they mounted, {{in order to}} depart in company. The host and hostess stood in the doorway, to see them depart. The {{landlord}} proffered a stirrup-cup to the elder guest, while the landlady offered Peveril a glass from her own peculiar bottle. For this purpose, she mounted on the horse-block, with flask and glass in hand; {{so that it was}} easy for the departing guest, although on horse-back, to return the courtesy in the most approved manner, namely, by throwing <b>his</b> <b>arm</b> <b>over</b> <b>his</b> landlady's shoulder, and saluting her at parting.|$|R
40|$|Photographic {{portrait}} of Governor Pio Pico {{with his wife}} and two nieces, ca. 1885. The last Mexican governor of Los Angeles, Pico is pictured to the right of center, with <b>his</b> <b>arm</b> <b>over</b> <b>his</b> wife's (Nachita Alvarado de Pico) shoulder to his left. His niece Maranata Alvarado is pictured on the far left, while his niece Trinidad de la Guerra is on the far right. Pico wears a suit and plaid vest, his wife a florally-patterned calico dress. The niece to the left has her long dark hair down and appears sullen. The niece to the right has her hair up. All are pictured from the ankles up...|$|R
50|$|Pacing Upside Down(1969) 60 minutes b&w. With <b>his</b> <b>arms</b> held <b>over</b> <b>his</b> head, hands crossed, Nauman {{is moving}} jerkily around a {{perimeter}} {{defined by a}} square drawn on the studio floor, filmed by a fixed camera, placed upside down.|$|R
60|$|At a {{sign from}} the Captain, John, with a shameless leer, advanced, and stood passively upon the grating, while the bare-headed old quarter-master, with grey hair {{streaming}} in the wind, bound {{his feet to}} the cross-bars, and, stretching out <b>his</b> <b>arms</b> <b>over</b> <b>his</b> head, secured them to the hammock-nettings above. He then retreated a little space, standing silent.|$|E
60|$|He {{looked at}} me with the first honest {{expression}} that had crossed his face in my presence--an expression of blank amazement. I could see that I sank in his estimation as a dangerous man from that moment. He shut up the drawer at once, folded <b>his</b> <b>arms</b> <b>over</b> <b>his</b> breast, and listened to me with a smile of satirical attention.|$|E
60|$|But {{the hard}} lesson learned {{early in life}} stood him in good stead. He crossed <b>his</b> <b>arms</b> <b>over</b> <b>his</b> broad chest and anon his well-shaped hand went up to his {{moustache}} and it almost {{seemed as if the}} slender fingers smoothed away the traces of that wave of wrath which had swept over him so unaccountably just now, and only left upon his face those lines of mockery and of good-humour which a nature redolent of sunshine had rendered indelible.|$|E
60|$|Betty was brave {{even in her}} surrender. Her hands {{moved slowly}} upward along <b>his</b> <b>arms,</b> slipped <b>over</b> <b>his</b> shoulders, and clasped round his neck. Then she lifted a flushed and tearstained face with tremulous lips and {{wonderful}} shining eyes.|$|R
60|$|At this {{threatening}} {{stage of}} the discourse, Jo, {{who seems to have}} been gradually going out of his mind, smears <b>his</b> right <b>arm</b> <b>over</b> <b>his</b> face and gives a terrible yawn. Mrs. Snagsby indignantly expresses her belief that he is a limb of the arch-fiend.|$|R
60|$|George {{stood with}} his head drawn back, <b>his</b> <b>arms</b> folded tightly <b>over</b> <b>his</b> broad breast, and a bitter smile curling his lips.|$|R
60|$|His sudden {{appearance}} daunted, I suppose, {{our hidden}} enemies; for Northmour and I {{had time to}} recover, to seize Clara between us, one by each arm, and to rush forth to his assistance, ere anything further had taken place. But scarce had we passed the threshold when there came near a dozen reports and flashes from every direction among the hollows of the links. Mr. Huddlestone staggered, uttered a weird and freezing cry, threw up <b>his</b> <b>arms</b> <b>over</b> <b>his</b> head, and fell backward on the turf.|$|E
60|$|Baldassarre quivered {{and looked}} up. He was too distant {{to see more}} than the general aspect of the preacher standing, with his right arm outstretched, lifting up the crucifix; but he panted for the {{threatening}} voice again {{as if it had}} been a promise of bliss. There was a pause before the preacher spoke again. He gradually lowered his arm. He deposited the crucifix on the edge of the pulpit, and crossed <b>his</b> <b>arms</b> <b>over</b> <b>his</b> breast, looking round at the multitude as if he would meet the glance of every individual face.|$|E
60|$|Oh! if he only could, how gladly {{would he}} have seized her even now and carried her away from this nauseating scene of bloodshed and cruelty. He crossed <b>his</b> <b>arms</b> <b>over</b> <b>his</b> {{powerful}} chest till every muscle seemed to crack with the effort of self-control. His very soul longed to take her away, his sinews ached {{with the desire to}} seize her and to bear her in his arms away, away beyond the cruel encircling walls of Rome, away from her marble palaces and temple-crowned hills, away over the marshes of the Campania and the belt of the blue sea beyond to that far-off land of Galilee where he himself had found happiness and peace.|$|E
50|$|A {{happy and}} joyful mood is {{created in the}} bronze work The Laughing Basutu (1936). With <b>his</b> <b>arms</b> folded <b>over</b> <b>his</b> chest and head turned to the right, the subject seems happy and lively. The play {{of light on the}} {{features}} adds to the liveliness of the work.|$|R
60|$|Oswald {{carried out}} his instructions, walked about {{until it was}} quite dark, then entered the inn, made his way unobserved to the chamber where {{he had left his}} clothes, put these on, made the others up into a bundle, and then went downstairs again and paid his bill; saying, as he did so, that he had found the friends he came to see, and that they had room to take him in. After leaving the house he threw the cloak, which he had carried on <b>his</b> <b>arm,</b> <b>over</b> <b>his</b> shoulders; and put on the cap that belonged to his other dress, and then went to the Falcon Inn, and repeating to the {{landlord}} the statement the earl had made, was at once shown to a chamber, with some deference.|$|R
6000|$|... "In some farms {{were found}} {{underground}} passages, {{leading from the}} master's bedside to an outside house, or even {{as far as a}} wood or another sheltered place in the neighbourhood, to enable the inhabitants to save themselves during a night attack. For the same reason each man had <b>his</b> <b>arms</b> suspended <b>over</b> <b>his</b> bed." ...|$|R
