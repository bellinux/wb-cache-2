Methods of teaching <b>economic</b> <b>disciplines</b> in higher education are held by holding lectures and seminars. The seminar provides an opportunity to determine the degree of independence and responsibility, to rise creativity in every student. The purpose is to disclose the main objectives of the seminar-dispute, which {{as a result of}} the preliminary work on the program material, the teacher and students are in a situation of direct active communication during performance of students on topics arising between discussion and generalizations by teacher, bu solving the problem of cognitive, developmental and educational character that imparted methodological and practical skills to students.

It should be concluded that in preparation for the seminar, students acquire the skills to work with the book, read the analysis, selection of the main and necessary speeches for the report,, and systematizing the selected materials. Students learn to clearly express their thoughts, work out the ability to speak without papers to prove their beliefs, to establish contact with the audience, etc. Accordingly, it is best to choose the topics of the seminar where the student must not only learn certain information, but also find a solution.

40|$|The {{extent to}} which freedom should prevail {{continues}} to be a lingering question in the <b>economic</b> <b>discipline.</b> The article focuses on how freedom is conceptualized. The question addressed is whose freedoms are being served through economic self-governance. The profit seeking microeconomic objective of capitalists, as addressed by Karl Marx, must lead to structural change resulting in unemployment. But unemployment has disastrous social costs. So the promotion of freedom for capitalists comes at a high cost toward society. Thus it is argued that the concept of freedom is itself a paradox. Freedom itself must be constrained to be viable. economic freedom, social economics, unemployment,...|$|E

40|$|It is {{conventionally}} accepted, {{that trade}} denotes a secluded <b>economic</b> <b>discipline</b> {{in the social}} division of work, moving the mass of goods from the production to the consumption sphere. However, there is no complete agreement as to what place the trade holds in the complex of economic processes {{as well as to}} the functions exercised by trade. The correct conception of the essence of trade requires consideration of special postulates: a) statements explaining the essence fo trade ought to be so general that they refer to the complex of this <b>economic</b> <b>discipline,</b> b) the essence fo trade ought to reflect objectively the existing elements and not the elements which ought to be, c) the economic categorie of „trade" should be explained in close connection with materialistic grounds, of economic relations, d) the essence of trade ought to be explained on the basis of economics. In contemporary literature, three basic outlooks on the essence of trade can be noted. Some authors stress mostly the role of trade in the process of reproduction, others stress its functions as the distributer of goods, still others, the representatives of so called theory of service trade, regard trade as the producer of services in the meaning of rendering of all kinds facilities and benefits on behalf of the consumers. Each of these three ideas introduces some hew essential moments and simultaneously it is debitted with some deficiencies. The basic fault of the theory of services mostly proposed is, that the different kind of services suggested concern mainly retail trade, but the remaining spheres of trade are not joined with an aven type of economic services.
