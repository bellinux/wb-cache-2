5|$|After Evans {{sold the}} Klan's former headquarters, it was {{purchased}} by the Catholic Church. The Cathedral of Christ the King was later built on the site.

He resigned on June10, 1939, and was replaced as Imperial Wizard by Colescott.|$|E

The two sisters ran the Home for the Aged Sick for five years. Ursula financed its operations with her pay, while Hsu managed it and made some extra cash by selling the harvest of 10 coconut trees and a dozen banana trees in the backyard.|$|E

5|$|Overall, John II Komnenos {{left the}} empire {{a great deal}} better off than he had found it. Substantial territories had been recovered, and his successes against the invading Petchenegs, Serbs and Seljuk Turks, along with his {{attempts}} to establish Byzantine suzerainty over the Crusader States in Antioch and Edessa, did much to restore the reputation of his empire. His careful, methodical approach to warfare had protected the empire from the risk of sudden defeats, while his determination and skill had allowed him to rack up {{a long list of}} successful sieges and assaults against enemy strongholds. By the time of his death, he had earned near universal respect, even from the Crusaders, for his courage, <b>dedication</b> <b>and</b> piety. His early death meant his work went unfinished; historian Zoe Oldenbourg speculates that his last campaign might well have resulted in real gains for Byzantium and the Christian cause.|$|E
5|$|After the shakyōjo {{closed at}} the end of the 8th century, the {{imperial}} family and leading aristocrats continued to sponsor sutra copying. Because of an enhanced belief in the powers of the Lotus Sutra, more Heian period copies of this sutra exist than of all other sutras combined. Starting in the early Heian period, styles became flowery and ornate with lavish decorations as sutras were not used only in recitation but for <b>dedication</b> <b>and</b> sacrifice. Devotional sutra copying was more often undertaken by the initiator than in the Nara period. New forms of decoration came in fashion by the early-11th century including placing each character in the outline of a stupa, on lotus pedestals or next to depictions of Boddhisattvas. Sutras were increasingly furnished with frontispieces starting in the 11th century. Calligraphy shifted from Chinese to Japanese style. Sutra copying continued into the Kamakura and subsequent periods, but only rarely to comparable artistic effect. With the import of printed Song editions in the Kamakura period, hand-copying of the complete scriptures died out and sutra copying was only practiced for its devotional aspect. Forty-six sutras or sets of sutras from the 6th century Western Wei to 14th century Nanboku-chō period have been designated National Treasures. Some of the oldest items in this list originated in China.|$|E
5|$|Prior to the 2001–02 season, {{the club}} {{announced}} that captain Saku Koivu {{had been diagnosed}} with non-Hodgkin lymphoma and would miss the entire season. Koivu managed to return with three games left in the regular season, and along with goaltender Jose Theodore, who would win the Hart Trophy that year, led the Canadiens into the playoffs {{for the first time in}} four seasons. The eighth-seeded Canadiens upset the Boston Bruins in the first round of the playoffs, and Koivu led the team in playoff scoring with 10points in 12games. In recognition of his tenacity in returning from cancer treatment, the league voted Koivu as the Bill Masterton Memorial Trophy winner for <b>dedication</b> <b>and</b> perseverance. However, in the second round of the playoffs, the team was defeated by the Carolina Hurricanes in six games. The Canadiens finished fourth in the Northeast Division in the 2002-03 season, missing the playoffs by six points. After the Habs finished with a record of 18–19–5–4 in the first 48 games of the 2002–03 season, the team replaced Therrien with Claude Julien.|$|E
