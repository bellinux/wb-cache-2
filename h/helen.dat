5|$|Around 10:00pm {{local time}} on 4January, {{the centre of}} Tropical Cyclone <b>Helen</b> made {{landfall}} near Channel Point. As it moved ashore, the storm developed an eye; however, this feature began breaking apart once overland and the eyewall merged into the system's feeder bands. Roughly 12hours after landfall, <b>Helen</b> weakened to a tropical low before moving over the Gulf of Carpentaria late on 5January. Due {{to an increase in}} forward motion, the system was unable to regenerate sufficient convection to be reclassified a tropical cyclone before making a second landfall along the Cape York Peninsula. Once overland again, the remnants of <b>Helen</b> abruptly slowed and were last noted on 7January in the same region.|$|E
5|$|By 2January, {{the weak}} low moved over the Joseph Bonaparte Gulf where it slowly {{developed}} over the following day. Once over water, the Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC) designated the system as Tropical Depression 09S. As organisation improved, a mid-level subtropical ridge over Western Australia pushed the system westward, away from the Kimberley coast. Steadily strengthening, the low attained gale-force winds near its centre during the morning of 4January and was subsequently named <b>Helen</b> by the Bureau of Meteorology. Shortly thereafter, a strong westerly monsoon flow to the north caused <b>Helen</b> to turn eastward, back towards land. Intensification continued up until landfall, by which time <b>Helen</b> had attained Category2 status on the Australian tropical cyclone intensity scale. Maximum ten-minute sustained winds reached 95km/h (60mph) and the storm's barometric pressure decreased to 975mbar (hPa; 28.79inHg). The JTWC assessed <b>Helen</b> to have been slightly weaker, with peak winds estimated at 85km/h (50mph).|$|E
