It is known that several cells on the surfaces of the test specimens are destroyed during specimen preparation. Hence the effective thickness of the test specimen differs from the geometrical thickness and proper corrections are {{to be made for}} the thickness of the destroyed surface layers before other properties are calculated. This note presents an apparatus, its operating principles and an experimental pro-cedure to determine the thickness of destroyed surface layers of <b>cellular</b> <b>plastic</b> insula-tion test specimens...|$|R
40|$|One {{purpose of}} this work was to examine if a {{modification}} of the exterior insulation finishing system can lower the number of outer walls damaged by damp. The modification is the cut of the <b>cellular</b> <b>plastic</b> which is 45 degrees instead of a horizontal cut. One other purpose was; is <b>cellular</b> <b>plastic</b> or mineral wool better as insulation to minimize the dampness {{in this type of}} outer walls? A third purpose was to examine if there is any difference of dampness in the outer walls if using a gravel bed or concrete stones next to the outer wall. To examine these three purposes a laboratory experiment with three test walls with an exterior insulation finishing system was built. The difference between the three walls was the insulation. One wall was built with mineral wool with a horizontal cut, one with <b>cellular</b> <b>plastic</b> with a horizontal cut and the third with <b>cellular</b> <b>plastic</b> with a cut of 45 degrees. Simulations of pelting rain and measurements of dampness were carried out for 21 days. The measurements were taken at the same time every evening. After 21 days small samples of tree from the walls was weight, dried in an oven and then weight again to get the quantity of moisture in the samples before they were dried. A diffusion calculation of two outer walls, one with <b>cellular</b> <b>plastic</b> and one with mineral wool, was completed to examine the difference between the relative humidity in the walls. An identical calculation without a plastic film was executed too. The result of the calculations showed a minimal difference in the walls built with a plastic film. When the film was removed the result presented critical values. The result of the laboratory experiment indicates that the test wall with the cut of 45 degrees is better than the walls with a horizontal cut of the insulation. The differences were minimal but possible to read. Some critical, too high, values regarding the moisture content in wood were found and they came from the sills in the walls that had insulation with horizontal cuts. Of the two insulation types the result of calculations and laboratory experiment shows a minimal difference but they both indicates a better result for the mineral wool. The conclusion of this work indicates that <b>cellular</b> <b>plastic</b> with a 45 degree cut is slightly better than the horizontal cut. The comparison of <b>cellular</b> <b>plastic</b> and mineral wool indicates that the mineral wool is better. Another conclusion of this work is that the material on the ground next to the outer wall did not alter the dampness in the wall...|$|R

40|$|Background: The most energy {{efficient}} houses today are so called passive houses. These houses achieve high energy-efficiency partly by having well insulated walls. U-value describes {{the amount of}} heat transfered through a building element, the more insulation, the smaller U-value. A typical passive house wall have a U-value of 0. 10 W/m 2,°C. The passive houses are primarily made as small family houses {{and not as a}} block of apartments. This is partly because the bigger houses often are made of prefabricated walls, which at present times are not made with enough insulation. One construction method common in prefabrication is a sandwich-construction with two layer of concrete surrounding a core of <b>cellular</b> <b>plastic.</b> Skanska is making this type of walls in a factory on Gotland. We wanted to combine the energy efficiency of passive housing with the efficiency of prefabricated sandwich-walls. Aims: To present a suggestion of a sandwich-construction made with concrete and <b>cellular</b> <b>plastic</b> with a U-value below 0. 10 W/m 2,°C, that could be implemented in the factory on Gotland. Methods: By analyzing systems of today we developed two different models that have a U-value below 0. 10 W/m 2,°C. The first system was developed from a system used in Skanska’s factory on Gotland and the second one was based on a system delivered by Halfen DEHA. This was made through empirical tests and theoretical calculations. We compared the developed systems in terms of the conditions in Skanska’s factory on Gotland. Result and discussion: The system based on Halfen DEHA needs a larger amount of shackles, than the system developed from Skanska’s present system. This leads to the need of thicker insulation to achieve the desired U-value. The reason is that the Skanska-based system uses a combination of shackles and <b>cellular</b> <b>plastic</b> to carry the loads of the coating layer while the Halfen DEHA depends on the shackles alone. We believe that the first of our two developed systems is the best in terms of the ease in adopting to the production method in Skanska’s factory. The second system is safer in terms of controlling the production and has the possibility to have an air gap. Conclusion: In the rapport we present a sandwich-construction system that has a U-value below 0. 10 W/m 2,°C, that we believe would work for prefabrication of wall structures and could be easily adopted in Skanska’s factory on Gotland...|$|R

40|$|Högpresterande isolering är en typ av {{material}} som finns tillgängligt men inte används på den svenska marknaden i den utsträckning som de bör göra. I denna rapport kommer det högpresterande isoleringsmaterialet PIR att ligga i fokus och det jämförs främst med det traditionella isoleringsmaterialet cellplast men paralleller dras även till mineralullen. PIR- isoleringen har 40 % bättre värmekonduktivitet än cellplasten och detta innebär att materialet har bättre isoleringsförmåga som bidrar till tunnare konstruktioner. Isoleringen är därför idealiskt att använda för passiv-, lågenergi och nollenergihus. En annan egenskap som utmärker PIR- isoleringen är dess brandegenskaper som uppfyller en högre brandklass än cellplasten, trots att det är ett plastmaterial. PIR- isoleringen är ett dyrare material, dock sparas pengar in redan vid produktion då fukt- och vindskydd kan uteslutas i en konstruktion. Om högre energikrav ska uppfyllas kan pengar även sparas in på sikt genom lägre energikostnader. High performance insulation {{is a type}} {{of material}} that is available but has not been used at the Swedish market as it should have.

This material will be compared to the traditional insulation material cellular plastic; parallels will also be drawn to the mineral fiber. PIR- insulation has 40 % better thermal conductivity than the <b>cellular</b> <b>plastic</b> and means that the material has a better insulation ability, which leads to a thinner construction. This insulation is therefore ideal for use in passive-, low-energy- and zero-energy houses. Another property that makes PIR- insulation stand out is its fire resistant capacity which fulfill a higher fire class than the <b>cellular</b> <b>plastic,</b> despite that it also is a plastic material.

These materials are extremely effective in meeting energy efficiency goals in buildings and their safe use should also be enabled and optimised by undertaking comprehensive fire safety analyses. The proposed methodology consists of determining the mass loss {{as a function of the}} thermal evolution by applying a mass conversion directly using thermogravimetric data under non-oxidative conditions. In order to verify this simplified method, an experimental programme based on 100 mm thick samples of rigid polyisocyanurate foam was conducted using a Cone Calorimeter, obtaining measurements of mass loss and temperature within the core of the material. A Monel plate was used on top of the sample in order to represent a simpler boundary condition by eliminating the smouldering process of the charred material. Although the pyrolysis rates using this methodology did not provide a perfect fit with experimental data, they showed similar trends, with a slightly delayed prediction but still accurate magnitude. This methodology presents potential for fire safety engineering applications in two domains: (1) as a complementary technique to improve the interpretation of results from standard and ad-hoc testing, and (2) as a design technique for the evaluation of potential heat release contribution and gaseous emissions of assemblies incorporating insulation materials...|$|R
