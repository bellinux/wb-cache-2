500|$|Vocalist Karl Willetts of {{the death}} metal band Bolt Thrower asserts the record was an {{inspiration}} for the band: [...] "When Slayer's Haunting the Chapel came out I had never heard anything like that before with that style of guitar playing. We were punks and heavy metal was alien to our upbringing. And other bands we heard like Venom, Slaughter and Metallica. So we took the elements of musicianship from metal and the aggression of punk and poured it all together." [...] Chuck Schuldiner of the band Death said the record was [...] "life changing at the time" [...] asserting, [...] "That was {{some of the early}} stuff that <b>gave</b> <b>me</b> <b>that</b> push." ...|$|E
500|$|Because the CW is a fashion-orientated network, {{there were}} times Nikita had to be dressed {{in a certain way}} to get her noticed by her targets. Q liked the idea, {{but at the same time}} wanted Nikita's dress sense to be [...] "toned down a bit" [...] because she is an assassin. In one scene in {{particular}} Q had to wear a red bikini in the pilot, which [...] "mortified" [...] her. She added [...] "that red bikini was the bane of my existence. You're not going to see me in a bikini again, that's for sure. [...] I was like, 'Danny, can you put me in a one-piece?,' and he <b>gave</b> <b>me</b> <b>that</b> red bikini. I was like, 'That's not a one-piece. That's a two-piece with a string.'" [...] However, Q did not have to cover her tattoos like she had to in the films, as it was in keeping with who the character is; a hardcore, street kid.|$|E
500|$|Alan Sepinwall of The Star-Ledger {{wrote that}} the episode [...] "was {{overflowing}} with manna from post-strike heaven: lots of action, lots of intrigue [...] the odd answer or three"; however, he criticized {{the deaths of the}} three 815 survivors played by extras and survival of main characters, saying that [...] "that sequence with Sawyer dodging bullets was supposed to be tense and frightening; instead, it was funny". [...] Kristin Dos Santos of E! agreed with Sepinwall's latter assessment. [...] Jamie Poniewozik of Time worried about the show's direction in which Widmore is suddenly the antagonist and Ben travels the globe to seek revenge. [...] He said that it [...] "looks a little too much like Alias"; Poniewozik enjoyed the island drama. [...] Daniel of TMZ called [...] "The Shape of Things to Come" [...] "another solid episode of Lost", grading it as a [...] "B" [...] and claiming that [...] "I enjoyed it the whole way through, even if it never <b>gave</b> <b>me</b> <b>that</b> 'OH MY GOD!!!!' moment, though I loved the Alex execution scene." ...|$|E

500|$|McGrady {{was born}} on May 24, 1979 in Bartow, Florida to Melanise Williford. His father was {{not a part of}} his {{everyday}} life, so Melanise raised McGrady {{with the help of her}} mother, Roberta, in Auburndale. As a youth, McGrady played high school basketball and baseball at Auburndale High School for three years before transferring to Mount Zion Christian Academy in Durham, North Carolina for his senior season. A relative unknown coming out of Florida, he made a name for himself after a strong performance at the Adidas ABCD Camp, an experience that helped McGrady recognize his true talent. He later reflected, [...] "Nobody had a clue who Tracy McGrady was. Sonny Vaccaro <b>gave</b> <b>me</b> <b>that</b> platform, and I played against the best players in the world at that time. I left that camp the No. 1 player in the nation, 175 to No. 1." [...] Behind his leadership, Mt. Zion emerged as the number two-ranked team in the country, and McGrady was named a McDonald’s All-American, national Player of the Year by USA Today, and North Carolina's Mr. Basketball by the Associated Press. Initially, McGrady considered playing college basketball at the University of Kentucky, but he ultimately decided to enter the NBA draft as he was a projected lottery pick.|$|E
500|$|Chloe is {{characterized}} as a [...] "dynamic fashion guru" [...] by Global BC and a [...] "bad girl" [...] by Soap Opera Digest. Hendrickson expressed her happiness in playing a [...] "manipulative" [...] character who takes advantage of people. She said, [...] "I get to play, not only this edgy, spicy kind of character, but she's actually pretty funny too, so it's nice to bring some humor into it as well." [...] Chloe is a [...] "bitchy" [...] stylist who is hired at Jabot Cosmetics as a fashion consultant. Explaining her initial portrayal of Chloe, Hendrickson stated, [...] "I {{was the one who}} wanted to make her edgy and funny. Most of the people I know who are in the fashion business are a little bitchy. I wanted to make Chloe interesting, instead of just playing her like some girl who was putting on fancy clothes. There was no conflict there. The writers definitely <b>gave</b> <b>me</b> <b>that</b> in the writing, and I tweaked it a little. They seemed to enjoy it. Each day, Chloe kept getting funnier and bitchier." [...] She first works with young model Lily Winters (Christel Khalil), the new face of Jabot whom she treats harshly. According to Hendrickson, Chloe [...] "takes her job very seriously. [...] is used to working with more professional models and is very hard on Lily regarding, you know, keeping up some sort of appearance if you will, regarding the fashion industry, which is weight. So [...] starts to give [...] a little weight complex because she is constantly throwing in her face that either she doesn't fit into things or they have to make things larger for her, etc." ...|$|E

2500|$|Roberts {{got to know}} Stamkos in the 2008–09 season, {{his last}} in the League. He oversaw Stamkos' {{off-season}} workouts north of Toronto in Roberts' in-house gym, which is a quick drive from Stamkos' family home in Unionville. Stamkos spoke highly regarding the workouts: [...] "It helped me a lot," [...] Stamkos said. [...] "I {{learned a lot about}} what I needed to improve on. There are certain aspects of my game that have improved because of that, and I'll be there again this summer working hard. It definitely <b>gave</b> <b>me</b> <b>that</b> extra jump for this season." ...|$|E
2500|$|On 1 April Charles {{wrote to}} his older sister Susan that he had also seen the {{rhinoceros}} in the zoo let {{out for the first}} time that spring, [...] "kicking & rearing" [...] and galloping for joy. He then passed on the gossip that Miss Martineau had been [...] "as frisky lately [...] the Rhinoceros. – Erasmus has been with her noon, morning, and night: – if her character was not as secure, as a mountain in the polar regions she certainly would loose it. – Lyell called there the other day & there was a beautiful rose on the table, & she coolly showed it to him & said [...] "Erasmus Darwin" [...] <b>gave</b> <b>me</b> <b>that.</b> – How fortunate it is, she is so very plain; otherwise I should be frightened: She is a wonderful woman". He began thinking about marriage himself, and on the back of an old letter (dated 7 April 1838) he listed the pros and cons of London, Cambridge or the countryside, noting that [...] "I have so much more pleasure in direct observation, that I could not go on as Lyell does, correcting & adding up new information to old train & I do not see what line can be followed by man tied down to London. – In country, experiment & observations on lower animals. – more space – [...] ". In an 8 May letter to his Cambridge friend Charles Thomas Whitley, who had recently married, Darwin described himself as having [...] "turned a complete scribbler", and said [...] "Of the future I know nothing I never look further ahead than two or three Chapters – for my life is now measured by volume, chapters & sheets & has little to do with the sun – As for a wife, that most interesting specimen in the whole series of vertebrate animals, Providence only know whether I shall ever capture one or be able to feed her if caught." ...|$|E
