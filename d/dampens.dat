5|$|A {{series of}} solid, fast {{decaying}} sounds are produced using dampening techniques. The desired effect is produced after striking the knob, by leaving one’s hand or knee or the mallets themselves on it. When one player is using two gongs, the assistant holding the lower-pitched gong positions it {{at an angle}} and <b>dampens</b> its surface using their hands.|$|E

5|$|Upon {{physical}} examination, {{breath sounds}} (heard with a stethoscope) may be diminished on the affected side, partly because {{air in the}} pleural space <b>dampens</b> the transmission of sound. Measures of the conduction of vocal vibrations {{to the surface of}} the chest may be altered. Percussion of the chest may be perceived as hyperresonant (like a booming drum), and vocal resonance and tactile fremitus can both be noticeably decreased. Importantly, the volume of the pneumothorax can show limited correlation with the intensity of the symptoms experienced by the victim, and physical signs may not be apparent if the pneumothorax is relatively small.|$|E
2500|$|Hand <b>dampening</b> (also {{known as}} finger <b>dampening)</b> {{can be used}} to <b>dampen</b> a white note while {{striking}} a nearby black note. As the player strikes a black note with a mallet, they simultaneously press the heel of their hand or the side of their pinky finger onto the ringing white bar, using the same hand to strike the black note and <b>dampen</b> the white note. [...] Using both hands, it's possible to <b>dampen</b> and strike two notes at once.|$|R
40|$|System {{nervousness}} {{in material}} requirements planning (MRP) systems has been receiving considerable attention recently. Several strategies are suggested to reduce MRP system nervousness. This paper examines {{one of these}} nervousness-reduction methods, <b>dampening</b> procedures. <b>Dampening</b> procedures are non-inventory-oriented, which screen out insignificant rescheduling messages generated by MRP systems so as to reduce schedule disruptions. The cost of rescheduling is incorporated {{as a component of}} total cost {{to evaluate the effectiveness of}} alternative <b>dampening</b> procedures by a simulation experiment under such operating environments as the presence of production uncertainty, different capacity utilization, and different rescheduling efforts. The <b>dampening</b> procedures tested are the static <b>dampening</b> procedure, automatic rescheduling procedure, and cost-based <b>dampening</b> procedure. The results indicate that the static and cost-based <b>dampening</b> procedures outperform the automatic rescheduling procedure under most operating conditions considered in the study. Furthermore, the relative performance of the static and cost-based procedures depends on the difficulty of rescheduling efforts involved and the lot-sizing rule used. material requirements planning production scheduling <b>dampening</b> procedure...|$|R
2500|$|Slide <b>dampening</b> {{can be used}} to <b>dampen</b> a {{note that}} is {{physically}} adjacent to the new note being struck. [...] The player strikes the new note and then controls the rebound of the mallet so that it slides over and onto the note to be <b>dampened.</b> [...] Sometimes slide <b>dampening</b> can make the new note sound [...] "bent" [...] or as if there is a glissando from the <b>dampened</b> note to the ringing one, as the two notes normally ring together for some short period of time.|$|R

Lee Miringoff, director of Marist College's Institute for Public Opinion, has remarked that governing during a world economic recession coupled with his stance {{in support of the}} Islamic complex near Ground Zero <b>dampens</b> Bloomberg's support.|$|E
25|$|There {{have also}} been {{experiments}} in humans using non-invasive neuroimaging technologies as interfaces. The substantial majority of published BCI work involves noninvasive EEG-based BCIs. Noninvasive EEG-based technologies and interfaces {{have been used for}} a much broader variety of applications. Although EEG-based interfaces are easy to wear and do not require surgery, they have relatively poor spatial resolution and cannot effectively use higher-frequency signals because the skull <b>dampens</b> signals, dispersing and blurring the electromagnetic waves created by the neurons. EEG-based interfaces also require some time and effort prior to each usage session, whereas non-EEG-based ones, as well as invasive ones require no prior-usage training. Overall, the best BCI for each user depends on numerous factors.|$|E

2500|$|In hand-to-hand <b>dampening,</b> the vibist plays a {{note with}} one mallet, while {{simultaneously}} pressing another mallet onto a previously ringing bar. Usually the <b>dampening</b> mallet and the striking mallet {{are held in}} different hands, but advanced players can, in some circumstances, use two mallets from the same hand. [...] This {{is the most powerful}} of the mallet <b>dampening</b> techniques as {{it can be used to}} <b>dampen</b> any note on the instrument while simultaneously striking any other note.|$|R
25|$|Burgess was {{the first}} United States {{scientist}} to discover social spiders, which he described in Scientific American and other journals. Social spiders challenge theories of social biology because spiders are usually cannibalistic {{and would not be}} expected to form social groups. Burgess showed how social spiders modify their environment to be able to live together. For example, Mexican spiders called Mallos gregalis spin a web that amplifies the sounds of the flies that they eat and <b>dampens</b> the vibrations made by other spiders, allowing Mallos spiders to live in colonies containing hundreds of thousands of individuals. Another spider called Metepeira spinipes, spins two-part spider webs: individual orbs to catch prey, and vibration-damping tangled webs where spiders coexist peacefully. Burgess also described Oecobius civitas spiders who exchange individual webs with each other as part of a unique prober/retaliator social strategy (see evolutionary game theory).|$|E
500|$|A {{receptor}} antagonist {{is a type}} of [...] receptor ligand or {{drug that}} blocks or <b>dampens</b> a biological response by binding to and blocking a receptor rather than activating it like an agonist. They are sometimes called blockers; examples include alpha blockers, beta blockers, and calcium channel blockers. In pharmacology, antagonists have affinity but no efficacy for their cognate receptors, and binding will disrupt the interaction and inhibit the function of an agonist or inverse agonist at receptors. Antagonists mediate their effects by binding to the active site or to the allosteric site on a receptor, or they may interact at unique binding sites not normally involved in the biological regulation of the receptor's activity. Antagonist activity may be reversible or irreversible depending on the longevity of the antagonist–receptor complex, which, in turn, depends on the nature of antagonist–receptor binding. The majority of drug antagonists achieve their potency by competing with endogenous ligands or substrates at structurally defined binding sites on receptors.|$|E
500|$|Many reviewers criticised the film's climax {{and certain}} features, {{feeling that they}} {{deviated}} from its general style. Rituparna Chatterjee of CNN-IBN noted that {{the climax of the}} film was a [...] "huge dampener" [...] and explained, [...] "The diabolic twist at that juncture got underplayed... What follows is a sobfest... the apologetic explanation of why she does what she does. Justifying her action comes across more as an effort to appease the Indian morality". The Outlook review noted, [...] "At times, Kahaani is too clever, at others extremely pedestrian like in the depiction of computer hacking and IB operations, not to speak of the ludicrous terrorist angle and the all-too predictable Durga Puja setting for that mythology tie-in." [...] It adds that the [...] "spoon-feeding" [...] of reasons at the end <b>dampens</b> the intrigue factor. The review in Yahoo! India comments that the Durga metaphor at the end was enforced, and that the film over-indulged in Bengali stereotypes.

2500|$|Pedaling {{techniques}} {{are at least}} as important for the four-mallet vibist as for two-mallet players, but the all-or-nothing <b>dampening</b> system of the pedal/pad presents many obstacles to multi-linear playing since each line normally has its own <b>dampening</b> requirements independent of the other lines. To overcome this, four-mallet players use a set of <b>dampening</b> techniques referred to as [...] "mallet dampening", in addition to the pedaling techniques used by two-mallet players. The mallet <b>dampening</b> techniques [...] "are to the vibist as garlic and fresh basil are to the Northern Italian chef" [...] and contribute significantly to expressive four-mallet playing.|$|R

2500|$|It is {{currently}} {{not unusual for}} the rim of a bodhran to be covered with electrical tape, either by the drum-maker or the owner. This both reduces [...] "edge-loading" [...] (where the vibrations in the skin hit the rim and bounce back {{toward the center of}} the drum), and <b>dampens</b> unwanted overtones, allowing for greater control of the drum's sound. Electrical tape is preferred because the adhesive is rubber-based and will stretch with the skin even after bonding to it, lessening the likelihood of bubbles and other changes in the tape occurring when the skin tension is changed by tuning or atmospheric conditions. Owners of lower quality drums, with thick and rough skins, may also choose to sand the skin very lightly to reduce the rasp when the tipper strikes the face of the drum. Many effects of these and other modifications to the drum-skin, especially high quality skins, can also be achieved through regular use of the drum over time.|$|E
