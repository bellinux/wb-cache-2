25|$|Conflicting {{theories}} explain saffron's {{arrival in}} South Asia. Kashmiri and Chinese accounts date its arrival anywhere between 2500–900 years ago. Historians studying ancient Persian records date the arrival to sometime prior to 500 BC, attributing it to a Persian transplantation of saffron corms to stock new gardens and parks. Phoenicians then marketed Kashmiri saffron as a dye and {{a treatment for}} melancholy. Its use in foods and dyes subsequently spread throughout South Asia. Buddhist monks wear saffron-coloured robes; however, the robes are not dyed with costly saffron but turmeric, a less expensive dye, or jackfruit. Monks' robes are dyed the same colour to show equality with each other, and turmeric or ochre were the cheapest, most readily available dyes. <b>Gamboge</b> is now used to dye the robes.|$|E

40|$|On-line ultra {{high-performance}} {{liquid chromatography}} (UHPLC) coupled with electrospray quadrupole time-of-flight tandem mass spectrometry (ESI-QTOF-MS/MS/MS) has been developed {{for the analysis of}} a series of caged xanthones in the resin of Garcinia hanburyi. The fragmentation of protonated molecular ions for 12 known cadged xanthones was carried out using low-energy collision-induced electrospray ionization tandem mass spectrometry. It was found that Retro-Diels-Alder rearrangement occurred in the CID processes and produced the characteristic fragment ions, which are especially valuable for the identification of this class of xanthones. The fragmentation differential between some cis-, trans-isomers was uncovered. Computation methods were utilized to rationalize the observed MS behaviors. On-line UHPLC-ESI-MS/MS/MS method has proved to be rapid and efficient in that within 6 min, 15 caged scaffold xanthones, including three pairs of epimers and four pairs of isomers in <b>gamboges,</b> were effectively separated and identified. Among them, two known, namely isogambogenin (13) and isomorellinol (14) and one likely new caged Garcinia xanthones from the Garcinia hanburyi were tentatively characterized based on the tandem mass spectra of known ones.

40|$|Gambogic acid, usually {{isolated}} as an inseparable stereomeric Mixture of C- 2 epimers, was newly {{separated into}} two epimers (1 and 2) from the <b>gamboges</b> of Garcinia hanburyi. The stereochemistry at C- 2 was clearly defined by extensive spectroscopic analysis and direct comparison of NMR and HPLC data {{with those of}} the known R-epimer. Both epimers were examined for their cytotoxicities against human leukemia K 562 (K 562 /S) and doxorubicin-resistant K 562 (K 562 /R) cell lines. Different from doxorubicin (IC 50 = 10. 78 mu M for K 562 /R and 0. 66 mu M for K 562 /S), epimers 1 and 2 exhibited similar activities against both cell lines (IC 50 = 1. 32 and 0. 89 mu M for 1, IC 50 = 1. 11 and 0. 86 mu M for 2). These results suggested that both epimers were not Multidrug resistance (MDR) substrates. Furthermore, epimers 1 and 2 were tested for their inhibitory effects against six human cytochrome P- 450 enzymes. Epimers 1 and 2 showed little inhibitory effects toward five of the enzymes except CYP 2 C 9. Interestingly, when tested against CYP 2 C 9, S-epimer 2 had an inhibitory effect 20 -fold stronger than that of R-epimer 1...|$|R

40|$|The {{damage of}} thrips (Thripidae: Thysanoptera) on {{mangosteen}} production were studied in local orchards in Nakhon Si Thammarat from September 2008 to July 2010. It {{was found that}} the damage was related directly to thrip population and the cycles of mangosteen growth such as the young leaves, flowering and young fruit stages. For the first and second year-rounds, off-season production, thrip abundance in October was averaged at 0. 57 and 0. 26 thrips/shoot in September. For the in-season production in April; the amount of thrips was averaged at 0. 12 with 0. 15 thrips/shoot, respectively. The lowest amount of thrips was noticed in the harvesting season of the two-year-round production. The damage at the flowering and young fruits stages due to rough scarring on the fruit surfaces and calyxes at the harvesting period were caused by thrips. The average rough scars on the fruit surface in the first- and second year- round, off-season production were 22. 03 and 28. 87 %; in-season production were 23. 12 and 21. 60 %, respectively. However, the rough scars on fruit calyxes at the harvesting period were found to be 100 %. The fruit <b>gamboges</b> in the first- and second year- round, off-season production were averaged at 45. 40 and 23. 92 %; and in-season production at 46. 44 and 13. 19 %, respectively. Over 20 % of rough scars appearing on fruit surfaces of the total mangosteen production lowered the quality for export. Good management in the local orchards is essential for increasing the marketing quality of mangosteen production. </strong...|$|R
