5|$|Another major {{stimulus}} for growth was the Second Great Awakening (c. 1790 – 1840), which initially <b>grew</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> a 1787 student revival at Hampden–Sydney College, a Presbyterian institution in Virginia. From there, revivals spread to Presbyterian churches in Virginia {{and then to}} North Carolina and Kentucky. The Revival of 1800 was one such revival that first <b>grew</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> meetings led by Presbyterian minister James McGready. The most famous camp meeting of the Second Great Awakening, the Cane Ridge Revival in Kentucky, occurred during a traditional Scottish communion season {{under the leadership of}} local Presbyterian minister Barton W. Stone. Over 10 thousand people came to Cane Ridge to hear sermons from Presbyterian as well as Methodist and Baptist preachers.|$|E

5|$|A form of Protestantism {{known as}} Methodism {{is the third}} largest Christian {{practice}} and <b>grew</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> Anglicanism through John Wesley.

5|$|By the mid-1980s, synth-pop {{had helped}} {{establish}} the synthesizer {{as a primary}} instrument in mainstream pop music.

5|$|Tournaments and hastiludes {{began in}} the 11th century as both a sport and to provide {{training}} for battle. Usually taking {{the form of a}} melee, the participants used the horses, armour and weapons of war. The sport of jousting <b>grew</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> the tournament and, by the 15th century, the art of tilting became quite sophisticated. In the process, the pageantry and specialization became less war-like, perhaps because of the knight's changing role in war.|$|E
5|$|Developed in {{response}} to the American Polaris programme, the Tu-142 <b>grew</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> the need for a viable Soviet ASW platform. It succeeded the stillborn Tu-95PLO project, Tupolev's first attempt at modifying the Tu-95 for maritime use. The Tu-142 differed from the Tu-95 in having a stretched fuselage to accommodate specialised equipment for its ASW and surveillance roles, a reinforced undercarriage to support rough-field capability, improved avionics and weapons, and enhancements to general performance. The Tu-142's capability was incrementally improved while the type was in service, eventually resulting in the Tu-142MZ, the final long-range Tu-142 with highly sophisticated combat avionics and a large payload. Tupolev also converted a number of Tu-142s as avionics (Tu-142MP) and engine (Tu-142LL) testbeds.|$|E
5|$|Founded in 1875 as the First Hebrew Congregation of Oakland, Temple Sinai is {{the oldest}} synagogue in the East Bay region of the San Francisco Bay Area. It <b>grew</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> Oakland's Hebrew Benevolent Society, which had been {{organized}} in 1862 by eighteen merchants and shopkeepers from several foreign countries—predominantly Polish Jews from Posen. Although Hebrew Benevolent Societies typically ceased operations upon the founding of a synagogue, Oakland's was unusual in continuing to function independently {{for a number of}} years (the two groups did not merge until 1881).|$|E

The piano was the first instrument she learned to play, and she continues to use it as well as digital pianos including a Roland RD-300SX, RD-700 and KR-15. She also uses guitars extensively in her music particularly when touring, due to their portable nature and favours the Australian brand, Maton. On occasion she plays keytar, xylophone and melodica during performances.|$|E
5|$|Image filters. Image filter theory <b>grew</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> {{transmission}} line {{theory and the}} design proceeded {{in a similar manner}} to {{transmission line}} analysis. For the first time filters could be produced that had precisely controllable passbands and other parameters. These developments took place in the 1920s and filters produced to these designs were still in widespread use in the 1980s, only declining as the use of analogue telecommunications has declined. Their immediate application was the economically important development of frequency division multiplexing for use on intercity and international telephony lines.|$|E
5|$|In 1975, the Somali Film Agency (SFA), the nation's film {{regulatory}} body, was established. An {{adjunct to}} the federal Ministry of Information and National Guidance, it <b>grew</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> the Ministry's visual aids arm. The SFA's duties included overseeing the importation, distribution and censorship of movies in the country. It later also oversaw the production of both long and short films. Most of the imported films were brought in from Egypt, Italy, the Soviet Union and East Germany. To facilitate processing and post-production, the SFA also forged a working partnership with British Films LTD, a British movie company. From 1979 to 1983, the Somali film producer and director Ali Said Hassan served as the SFA's representative in Rome.|$|E
