5|$|The four {{terrestrial}} or inner planets have dense, rocky compositions, {{few or no}} moons, and no ring systems. They {{are composed}} largely of refractory minerals, such as the silicates, which <b>form</b> <b>their</b> crusts and mantles, and metals, such as iron and nickel, which <b>form</b> <b>their</b> cores. Three of the four inner planets (Venus, Earth and Mars) have atmospheres substantial enough to generate weather; all have impact craters and tectonic surface features, such as rift valleys and volcanoes. The term inner planet {{should not be confused}} with inferior planet, which designates those planets that are closer to the Sun than Earth is (i.e. Mercury and Venus).|$|E
5|$|Apart {{from the}} lion, the cheetah {{is the only}} cat that is gregarious; however, female cheetahs tend to remain solitary. Tim Caro, of the University of California, Davis, {{identified}} the various social classes and their longevity. Pregnant and nursing females, a few adolescents, and males who have not joined any groups are typically solitary. Non-lactating females, their cubs, adolescent siblings, and several males will <b>form</b> <b>their</b> own groups. A loose association between individuals {{of the opposite sex}} can be observed during the breeding season. These social groups typically keep away from one another.|$|E

5|$|As {{the video}} begins, Aguilera is chatting {{with a group}} of women. When Aguilera leaves the conversation, a black man {{suddenly}} grabs her buttocks, making Aguilera stop and causing an argument between them. As she continues to sing, the nearby women in the neighborhood join her, while the male residents join the man and <b>form</b> <b>their</b> respective sides in the street. They perform their own hip hop dance skills against each other. At the bridge, Lil' Kim appears in a bikini and a sheer black blouse, and dances in her high heels. The argument ends with Aguilera spraying the men with a water hose, which she holds between her legs and parodies the penis.|$|E
5|$|Candaules was {{completed}} and {{exhibited at the}} Royal Academy in 1830. Etty felt that the moral lesson of the story was that women were not male chattels, and that if men—even their husbands—violated a woman's rights she was within her rights to punish them. However, he made little effort to explain what was, at the time, an unusual view, instead allowing viewers to <b>form</b> <b>their</b> own judgement of the piece. Thus, unusually for a painting of the time, Candaules appears morally highly ambiguous, inviting the viewer to sympathise either with the sexually immoral Candaules, the murderous Nyssia or the voyeuristic Gyges.|$|E
5|$|Decommissioned in 1854, {{the castle}} was first leased, and later bought outright, by the Royal Yacht Squadron to <b>form</b> <b>their</b> new clubhouse. The Squadron then {{employed}} the architect Anthony Salvin to rebuild {{large parts of}} it between 1856 and 1858. It became the headquarters {{for part of the}} D-Day invasion force during the Second World War, but has otherwise remained in use by the Squadron and is a distinctive landmark in yacht races along the Isle of Wight.|$|E

5|$|In {{the mid-1980s}} Mikhail Gorbachev instituted glasnost, {{allowing}} greater {{freedom of speech}} and organization than ever before in the USSR. This openness generated a burst in women’s political action, academic research, and artistic and business ventures. Additionally, women were aware that the new government would offer little assistance with their economic and social struggles. Citizens of the Soviet Union could file complaints and receive redress through the Communist Party, but the post-Soviet government had not developed systems of state recourse. Women began to <b>form</b> <b>their</b> own networks of resource sharing and emotional support, which sometimes developed into grassroots organizations.|$|E
5|$|Just {{after midnight}} the New Zealanders sent the 2nd (Wellington West Coast) Squadron, {{commanded}} by Major James McGregor Elmslie, forward {{to reinforce the}} 9th Squadron. But by itself the 2nd Squadron was {{not strong enough to}} break through the Turkish lines and reach the post, and at times they had to engage in close quarter fighting in the thick scrub. Eventually the 2nd Squadron had to <b>form</b> <b>their</b> own defensive position in the ground between No.2 and No.3 Posts.|$|E

5|$|On 20 August, Tsipras {{announced}} {{the resignation of}} the Syriza-ANEL government, and that a legislative election was scheduled for 20 September. Tsakalotos {{and the rest of the}} cabinet remained as lame duck ministers whilst opposition parties attempted to <b>form</b> <b>their</b> own government. However, the opposition parties failed to form a government and Vassiliki Thanou-Christophilou was appointed as an interim Prime Minister on 27 August. On 28 August, Thanou-Christophilou's caretaker cabinet was sworn in, with George Chouliarakis being sworn in as the interim Minister of Finance.|$|E
5|$|Several {{species of}} {{elongate}} organisms <b>form</b> <b>their</b> bodies into a loop to roll, including certain caterpillars (which do so to escape danger), tiger beetle larvae, myriapods, mantis shrimp, Armadillidiidae, and Mount Lyell salamanders. Other species adopt more spherical postures, primarily {{to protect their}} bodies from predators; this posture has been seen in pangolins, wheel spiders, hedgehogs, armadillos, Armadillo girdled lizards, isopods, and fossilized trilobites. Pangolins and wheel spiders have been observed to purposely roll away from predators. These species may roll passively (under the influence of gravity or wind) or actively, typically by altering their shape to generate a propulsive force.|$|E
5|$|The New South Wales Rugby League {{competition}} (NSWRL) {{had been}} formed in 1908 {{as the first}} rugby league competition in Australia. There was a Newcastle based club {{in the first two}} seasons of the Sydney-based competition, but they eventually left to <b>form</b> <b>their</b> own Newcastle Rugby League competition. It was not until 1988 that another Newcastle based team was admitted into the NSWRL. In 1995, the Australian Rugby League (ARL) took control of the competition amid the beginning of the Super League war. It was then that News Limited began proposing and deliberating a rival rugby league competition and the twenty teams which competed in the 1995 ARL season were split between the Super League and ARL competitions.|$|E

50|$|Round Table {{itself was}} formed in 1927, a social {{networking}} and community group exclusively for men aged under 40. Within three years, <b>their</b> wives had <b>formed</b> <b>their</b> own group, Ladies Circle. Like Round Table, Ladies Circle was specifically intended for younger ladies, and so was only open to under 40s. In 1953, former members of Bournemouth Ladies Circle <b>formed</b> <b>their</b> own group, Tangent.|$|R
5|$|The School of Music is {{also home}} to a number of ensembles, such as the 80-to-90-member Symphony Orchestra, Jazz Ensemble, Concert Band, and Percussion and MIDI Ensembles.

The {{contemporary}} Sonic Generator group, backed by the GVU and in collaboration with the Center for Music Technology, performs a diverse lineup of music featuring new technologies and recent composers.|$|E
5|$|The olive baboon {{lives in}} groups of 15 to 150, {{made up of a}} few males, many females, and their young. Each baboon has a social ranking somewhere in the group, {{depending}} on its dominance. Female dominance is hereditary, with daughters having nearly the same rank as their mothers, and adult females forming the core of the social system. Female relatives <b>form</b> <b>their</b> own subgroups in the troop. Related females are largely friendly to each other. They tend to stay close together and groom one another, and team up in aggressive encounters within the troop. Female kin form these strong bonds because they do not emigrate from their natal groups.|$|E
5|$|The {{producers}} promoted Dostana {{in collaboration}} with Verve, which dedicated its November issue to the film. The issue, with Chopra on its cover, contained 40 pages of interviews with the actress, Mansukhani and Johar, fashion shoots on the sets, clothing by its designers and fashion and beauty articles based on the film. Although Maybelline products were not used for Chopra's make-up, the company promoted Chopra's appearance with behind-the-scenes footage in their television and print advertisements and invited its customers to mirror the actress. The producers collaborated with Facebook, which featured advertisements {{with each of the}} three lead actors urging users to <b>form</b> <b>their</b> own group. Pantaloons partnered with the film to showcase its apparel in 43 outlets across India.|$|E

5|$|The {{streams of}} dust and gas each <b>form</b> <b>their</b> own {{distinct}} tail, pointing in slightly different directions. The tail of dust is {{left behind in the}} comet's orbit in such a manner that it often forms a curved tail called the type II or dust tail. At the same time, the ion or type I tail, made of gases, always points directly away from the Sun because this gas is more strongly affected by the solar wind than is dust, following magnetic field lines rather than an orbital trajectory. On occasions - such as when the Earth passes through a comet's orbital plane, a tail pointing in the opposite direction to the ion and dust tails called the antitail may be seen.|$|E
5|$|When Metcalfe and Noble left to <b>form</b> <b>their</b> {{own group}} in September 1963, the {{remaining}} members asked Barrett and guitarist Bob Klose to join. Waters {{switched to the}} bass and by January 1964, the group {{became known as the}} Abdabs, or the Screaming Abdabs. During late 1964, the band used the names Leonard's Lodgers, Spectrum Five, and eventually, the Tea Set. Sometime during late 1965, the Tea Set began calling itself the Pink Floyd Sound, later the Pink Floyd Blues Band and by early 1966, Pink Floyd.|$|E
5|$|When the Whiskers first {{formed in}} 1998, their main rivals were Young Ones, Lazuli, Elveera and Vivian. These were their main rivals for three years, then Gattaca formed {{north of the}} Whiskers {{territory}} and became their rivals. Over the next few years, Vivian {{moved away from the}} Whiskers and Commandos became the Whiskers new rivals. Soon Elveera and Lazuli moved away from the Whiskers and Aztecs <b>form</b> <b>their</b> territory next to the Whiskers. In 2007 Whiskers main rivals were Young Ones, Aztecs and Commandos. Then Young Ones died out, and Kung Fu formed next to Whiskers, Commandos moved away and the Sequoia formed. Today Whiskers main rivals are Toyota, Lazuli, Kung Fu and Sequoia.|$|E
