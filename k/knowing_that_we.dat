5|$|I {{hope that}} {{all the people who}} see us will be happy in <b>knowing</b> <b>that</b> <b>we,</b> despite being prisoners, {{we were able to do}} this. Before the dancing, our {{problems}} were really heavy to bear. Dancing takes our minds away from our problems. Our bodies became more healthy. As for the judges, they may be impressed with us, seeing that we are being rehabilitated and this could help our case. We are being rehabilitated in a good way.|$|E
500|$|Discussing the {{progression}} from MercyMe's first album Almost There to {{the songs on}} Spoken For, [...] MercyMe's lead singer Bart Millard said in an interview: [...] "Our goal early on {{was to make sure}} our songs were 'singable' and make sure they fit on power point because we wanted to write songs for corporate worship. Spoken For is filled with songs that I pray the church will use." [...] He added that this album leaned more toward rock than Almost There. Millard said [...] of the origin of the album title: [...] "Over the last year I’ve been consumed with the idea that God is so crazy in love with us—just <b>knowing</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> are part of something bigger and we worship a God who’s in complete control no matter how good or bad things get. The phrase [...] "spoken for" [...] really stuck with me." ...|$|E
500|$|The band took {{a two-week}} hiatus between the European and Japanese {{legs of the}} tour, which began in May 1992. Minutes before the Chili Peppers were {{scheduled}} to perform in Tokyo, Frusciante refused to go on stage, claiming he quit the band. After {{half an hour of}} coaxing, Frusciante agreed to play the show, though he asserted it would be his last. Kiedis recalled of the situation: [...] "It was the most horrible show ever. Every single note, every single word, hurt, <b>knowing</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> were no longer a band. I kept looking over at John and seeing this dead statue of disdain... And that night, John disappeared from the topsy-turvy world of the Red Hot Chili Peppers." [...] The band hired guitarist Arik Marshall to complete the rest of the tour, which included Lollapolooza and several European festivals. Marshall, however, was fired {{at the end of the}} tour.|$|E

His father died saving his entire platoon in the Korean War, although everyone {{told him that he}} ran off to join the circus. Wes later learns the truth when Brent reads out a passage from a book detailing the history of Dog River, not <b>knowing</b> <b>that</b> <b>Wes</b> was not supposed to hear it.|$|R

5000|$|... "As we work we {{must seek}} not for {{self-expression}} or for performance {{for its own}} sake, but only to establish the dramatist's intention, <b>knowing</b> <b>that</b> when <b>we</b> have succeeded in doing so audiences will say to themselves, not, This is beautiful, This is charming, This is splendid, but--This is true." ...|$|R

2500|$|SV Scaramouche. Retired {{and made}} own {{way back to}} Plymouth."Although we hadn't the {{satisfaction}} {{of being one of}} the 88 which rounded [...] "the rock" [...] we were content in <b>knowing</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> had brought the boat and ourselves back in one piece"-Steve Cross.|$|E
2500|$|... "It is {{an honor}} and {{privilege}} to be here today." [...] Michael told the spectators. [...] "Those of you in here today {{are some of the}} most special people in the world because you have chosen a life of service. [...] When we all sleep at night, we rest comfortably <b>knowing</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> are protected. [...] And it is because of you here today and others who so valiantly have given their lives to protect us, that we enjoy our freedom. [...] I thank you from the bottom of my heart. [...] I love you. [...] Thank you so much." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "At times, <b>knowing</b> <b>that</b> if <b>we</b> stopped {{another moment}} in these rooms we should scream, we would steal softly out and rush downstairs, and, {{shutting}} ourselves out of hearing in a cellar underneath the yard, laugh till we reeled against the dirty walls. I {{think we were}} both getting a little mad.|$|R
6000|$|... "I do {{not think}} there is any fear of an attack from Niort," [...] the Admiral said. [...] "They will know, well enough, that our people are {{flocking}} here from all parts; and will be thinking of defence, rather than of attack, <b>knowing</b> <b>that,</b> while <b>we</b> are almost within striking distance, the royal army is not in a condition, as yet, to march from Paris.|$|R
60|$|After {{refreshing}} {{ourselves with}} food, we paddled around the point without {{danger of being}} seen, {{because it was so}} late in the night, and landed at the same place as before, <b>knowing</b> <b>that</b> from there <b>we</b> would have no difficulty in finding the dwelling.|$|R
2500|$|The {{album cover}} {{features}} the {{four members of}} the band after they were hit by pies. Guitarist Brian James recalled: [...] "That was organised by this photographer called Peter Kodick, Stiff had assigned him to do the thing. They thought it was a jolly wheeze to surprise us with a few cream cakes, little <b>knowing</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> would relish it, get into to it and enjoy the whole experience". After the photo session, Damned bassist Captain Sensible noted: [...] "...I had more pie on my face {{than any of the other}} buggers and on the back of the sleeve I had my back to the picture, so I went down a photo booth and got some pictures, cut one out and said 'put that on there' so I would have something to show my relatives, because I didn't think we'd be invited to make another album".|$|E
2500|$|... "While {{the use of}} drones is {{intentionally}} {{not bound}} by international treaties or constitutional limits, we simultaneously understand the urgent need to develop and enforce new ethical frameworks as drone use becomes more commonplace {{as a tool of}} U.S. foreign policy. Through an active collaboration between N.E.D.H.I., the brave pilots and operators of the U.S. drone program, and the American public, we believe that we can find the political and moral solutions needed to both protect the security of the United States while also satisfying the concerns of the broader global community.The Do Not Kill Registry, our first public program, has started us on that path towards new solutions and will help give people around the world the peace of mind urgently needed during these times of escalating drone conflict. While what the future holds for the U.S. drone program remains uncertain, you can rest safely <b>knowing</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> will continue to diligently review and monitor the national drone kill list in order to ensure proper cautionary measures are taken while also continuing {{to take advantage of the}} military effectiveness of targeted drone strikes on militants around the world." ...|$|E
2500|$|Bird {{said his}} {{victory in the}} sprint race felt [...] "fantastic", [...] "Being back in GP2 is already feeling very good, being back in the feeder series to Formula One {{is a great place}} to be. To win for RUSSIAN TIME after only four races of {{existence}} is a very good feeling." [...] He believed that he may have pushed too hard at the wrong time in the race, [...] "it was just a case of keeping it on the racing line and hoping they'd battle it out behind me. Felipe's car was like a rocket at the end. Big thanks to my new team: to win in our fourth race, with no pre-season testing, is amazing." [...] Nasr spoke about car management and maintaining the pace levels with the leaders and believed he could have won in an alternative situation, [...] "But anyway, it’s still a good result. We came here to score big points and it’s quite good to go back to Europe <b>knowing</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> have a good car, a good team. It keeps getting better and better. I’m feeling quite confident." [...] Coletti believed his third-place finish contributed towards [...] "a good weekend" [...] for himself. He stated that entering the European leg of the season as the points leader had gave him additional motivation and hoped to be competing at the front of the field in Barcelona, [...] "We’re still a few points ahead – ten I think. But like I said, we need to score big points in Race 1 and I think that in Barcelona we’ll be in the front." ...|$|E

60|$|Although <b>knowing</b> {{full well}} <b>that</b> <b>we</b> were not {{proceeding}} {{in accordance with}} the law, since we had no authority for forcing an entrance into a dwelling, we burst open the rear door, and made thorough examination of the place.|$|R

60|$|As {{there was}} no <b>knowing</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> might not {{surprise}} {{some other kind of}} game in the coverts through which we were passing, we crept along warily.|$|E
60|$|Because of <b>knowing</b> <b>that</b> <b>that</b> which <b>we</b> {{would keep}} private {{was a secret}} no longer, I grew disheartened, and instead of agreeing to Archie's {{proposition}} that {{the remainder of the}} day be spent in gaining yet more recruits, I turned my face homeward once more, agreeing crustily to meet those who had promised to become Minute Boys at the old ship-yard that evening.|$|R
60|$|As {{a matter}} of course we kept the mule, for it was {{necessary}} my father should ride, and after the delay needed in which to explain matters, our little party started toward Washington, <b>knowing</b> full well <b>that</b> <b>we</b> were going where it was certain the enemy would soon come.|$|R
6000|$|... "It is {{the fortune}} of war, Cneius.

You will know that if I fall I shall be happy, and shall be free from all the troubles that await this unfortunate land." ...|$|R

6000|$|... "But Dorothy," [...] {{said the}} King, [...] "is not with this band of invaders; {{nor is the}} Yellow Hen. As for Tititi-Hoochoo, he has no means of <b>knowing</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> are afraid of eggs." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'There {{are very}} few people in this world half so good or so right-minded as Fitzjocelyn,' said Mary, earnestly and deliberately. 'It was he who bade me come to you, well <b>knowing</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> could never be happy without your consent.' ...|$|E
6000|$|But I cried, [...] "Nay! nay! Turn not back! Bold looks {{melt the}} hearts of foes. Moreover, if this Bulalio would have murdered us, {{there was no need}} for him to call up so many of his warriors. He is a proud chief, and would show his might, not <b>knowing</b> <b>that</b> the king <b>we</b> serve can muster a company for every man he has. Let us go on boldly." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 19. I think I show it {{you more}} {{accurately}} in the robin's back than I could {{in any other}} bird; its mode of transition into more brilliant color is, in him, elementarily simple; and although there is nothing, or rather because there is nothing, in his plumage, of interest like that of tropical birds, or even of our own game-birds, I {{think it will be}} desirable for you to learn first from the breast of the robin what a feather is. Once <b>knowing</b> <b>that,</b> thoroughly, <b>we</b> can further learn from the swallow what a wing is; from the chough what a beak is; and from the falcon what a claw is.|$|R
6000|$|She pondered awhile and answered: [...] "This is certain, that so soon as Ramiro finds <b>that</b> <b>we</b> have escaped, {{having the}} key to it, he will take boat and sail {{to the place where}} the barrels are buried, <b>knowing</b> well <b>that</b> {{otherwise}} <b>we</b> shall be off with them. Yes, I tell you that by dawn, or within an hour of it, he will be there," [...] and she stopped.|$|R
60|$|She, dear soul, had naught to say {{against our}} purpose, <b>knowing</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> of the colonies were fully {{committed}} to the struggle against the king; but she grieved because I was like {{to have so much}} of a hand in the business.|$|E
6000|$|... "Why, {{the fellows}} who are after that paper. They tipped the police off about the pool-rooms, <b>knowing</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> should be hauled off without having {{time to take}} {{anything}} with us. I'll bet anything you like {{they have been in}} and searched our rooms by now." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes," [...] I interrupted, [...] "you are. There {{is nothing}} more to be said on this subject. You may go now. You came here to annoy us, <b>knowing</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> did not {{entertain}} travelers, and now you see what you have made by it," [...] and I opened the door.|$|E
60|$|Another {{less obvious}} cause of {{my feeling is}} that the love of our kind cannot exist, or at all events not unmixed with {{contempt}} and various other unpleasant ingredients, in people who live and have their being amidst thousands and millions of their fellow-creatures herded together. The great thoroughfares in which we walk are peopled with an endless procession, an innumerable multitude; we hardly see and do not look at or notice them, <b>knowing</b> beforehand <b>that</b> <b>we</b> do not know and never will know them to our dying day; from long use we have almost ceased to regard them as fellow-beings.|$|R
500|$|At {{first sight}} this passage from up the Channel seems {{hazardous}} for the Germans. It is probable, however, that as their heavy ships {{are not fully}} efficient, they would prefer such a passage, relying for their security on the destroyers and aircraft which are efficient, and <b>knowing</b> full well <b>that</b> <b>we</b> have no heavy ships to oppose them in the Channel… ...|$|R
60|$|Simon Kenton and I had killed, or driven off, {{a band of}} {{fourteen}} savages, and surely my portion of the work had not been slight. It seemed to me then, as now, that I did my full share in the business. It is true, {{except for the fact}} of our having taken the brutes by surprise, and come upon them in such fashion they had no means of <b>knowing</b> but <b>that</b> <b>we</b> outnumbered them three or four to one, the matter might have come to a different ending; but it was much to our credit <b>that</b> <b>we</b> had been able to surprise those wretches who seldom made an attack unless it can be begun in like manner.|$|R
