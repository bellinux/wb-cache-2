40|$|In recent years, {{the use of}} Plant Incorporated Protectant (PIP) corn by American {{producers}} {{has been}} increasing dramatically. PIP corn contains genetically inserted traits that produce toxins in the plant that provide narrowly targeted protection against specific insect pests. The plant producing t oxms can offer significant reductions {{in the application of}} broad -spectrum pesticides that have ecological and human health consequences. PIP corn as a percentage of total corn acreage planted in the US is expected to continue to increase as these protective traits are "stacked" with other desirable traits by seed companies, and producers are seeing considerable increases in corn yield as a result. The introduction of corn as a bio-fuel source for ethanol has increased production by over 6 million hectares in 2007. The United States Environmental Protection Agency (USEPA), which is responsible for the registration of PIP crops under the Federal Insecticide, Fungicide and Rodenticide Act, views the use of PIP corn as positive. Broad spectrum pesticide use has declined since the PIP traits have been introduced. As the agricultural landscape sees a higher percentage of corn acres using the PIP technology, the risk of the targeted insect pest populations developing resistance to the toxins, thereby rendering the in will increase as well. This result would negate the effectiveness of the PIP corn traits and could reduce production of a US field corn crop valued at $ 33 billion dollars in 2006 and place US food and now energy security at risk. Concerns over <b>insect</b> <b>pest</b> <b>resistance</b> development to PIP traits have led the USEPA to team with NASA and the Institute for Technology Development (ITD) to develop geo-spatial technologies designed to proactively monitor the corn production landscape for insect pest infestation and possible resistance development. USEPA resistance management simulation models are combined with NASA remote sensi ng products to monitor the corn landscape for resistance development. The two agencies have entered into an agreement which could potentially lead to the development of next generation NASA sensors that will more specifically address the requirements of the USEPA's resistance development strategy and offer opportunities to study the ever changing ecosystem complexities. The USEPA/NASA/ITD team has developed a broad research project entitled CERES (Crop Evaluation Research for Environmental Strategies).

The objectives of this study were to estimate heritability and to identify maize inbred lines with dual resistance to weevil and larger grain borer (LGB). One hundred and twenty (120) inbred lines were evaluated in the field for adaptation and tested in the laboratory for resistance to the LGB and weevil. Insect-damage parameters namely grain damage, weight loss, flour weight and number of insects, were measured. Heritability, genotypic and phenotypic variances for the damage traits were determined. Genotype stability for <b>insect</b> <b>pest</b> <b>resistance</b> was determined based on genotypic variance and coefficient of variation (CVi) for each genotype.

40|$|Black cherry (Prunus serotina Ehrh.) {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{valuable}} hardwoods for high- end cabinetry, furniture, architectural millwork, paneling, and veneer. However, the damage caused by cambial-mining insect pests triggers gummosis in black cherry, a non-specific defense response in which resinous gum is deposited at the site of injury. The gum defects dramatically decrease the yield of high-quality black cherry lumber, and the value can be reduced by as much as 90 %. The goal of this project was to optimize the transformation and in vitro rooting system, and to develop transgenic black cherry for reproductive sterility and <b>insect</b> <b>pest</b> <b>resistance.</b> To achieve this, a TERMINAL FLOWER 1 homolog from black cherry was isolated and characterized as one of the strategies for gene containment. The PsTFL 1 cDNA contained a 519 bp coding region encoding a putative protein of 172 amino acid residues that have high identity with TFL 1 orthologs of other Prunus species. The quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) detected a single copy of PsTFL 1 in the genome of black cherry genotype BC 3 with two alleles. The highest mRNA level was detected in shoot tips, and the lowest level in the leaves. Transgenic Arabidopsis thaliana plants overexpressing PsTFL 1 showed significantly delayed flowering. Second, an improved Agrobacterium-mediated transformation system for the elite mature genotype of black cherry, BC 3, was developed based on an existing protocol developed in our lab. The application of 15 minute vacuum infiltration, Agrobacterium concentration at OD 600 of 1. 0 or 1. 5, and a 3 -day co-cultivation were found to be optimal. Rooting of transgenic black cherry shoots was achieved at 30 % using half-strength Murashige and Skoog medium supplemented with 2 % (w/v) sucrose, 5 μM napthaleneacetic acid, 0. 01 μM kinetin, and 0. 793 mM phloroglucinol, and transgenic plants were successfully acclimatized. Finally, three independent transgenic lines of black cherry overexpressing PsTFL 1 were obtained using the improved Agrobacterium-mediated transformation system. The integration of transgenes and the copy number of neomycin phosphotransferase (nptII) were confirmed by PCR and qPCR analysis. The expression levels of PsTFL 1 in three 35 S::PsTFL 1 lines were 3. 7 to 5. 8 -times higher than that of the wild-type, and these shoots were successfully rooted and acclimatized.

Besides being a dietary source of antioxidants, vitamins, minerals and fiber {{it is also a}} model system for studies on fruit development and functional genomics (Klee and Giovannoni 2011). A wide range of microbial pathogens and insect pests are known to attack tomato, particularly polyphagous lepidopteran insect Helicoverpa armigera, the common fruit borer which primarily damages the fruit, while Spodoptera litura damages the leaves causing severe losses to the crop productivity. There is a possibility of developing stable insect-resistant tomato lines through the expression of insecticidal gene of Bacillus thuringiensis (Bt), as documented successfully in several crop plants like cotton, maize, soybean, rice, canola and potato (Sanahuja et al. 2011; Tabashnik et al. 2011). The application of Bt-toxins for <b>insect</b> <b>pest</b> <b>resistance</b> has emerged as a powerful tool, being chemically free, eco-friendly and highly specific against target insects due to the presence of specific receptors in the midgut, while being non-toxic to beneficial insects and vertebrates owing to the lack of the receptors for toxin interaction and binding (Pigott and Ellar 2007; Bravo et al. 2011). Incorporation of cry 1 Ab insecticidal crystal protein gene in large number of crop plants particularly rice, tomato, maize, sugarcane and cotton have shown considerable protection against different lepidopteran insects and significant enhancement in productivity (Ye et al. 2001; Kumar and Kumar 2004; Dutton et al. 2005; Arvinth et al. 2010; Khan et al. 2013).|$|E
40|$|This thesis {{describes}} {{the production of}} three populations of transgenic rice plants using particle bombardment method altered in two main traits: (1) polyamine content and (2) <b>insect</b> <b>pest</b> <b>resistance.</b> The expression of antisense heterologous oat arginine decarboxylase (ADC) cDNA in transgenic rice plants suppressed endogenous ADC enzyme activity, and decreased putrescine and spermidine levels in a tissue/organ dependent manner, with no concomitant changes in the expression of other polyamine biosynthetic genes. The second population of transgenic rice plants engineered with a homologous spermidine synthase (SpdSyn) transgene, and observed through two generations, showed increased expression of both endogenous and transgene mRNAs. However, no significant accumulation of spermidine level in transgenic rice plants when compared to wild type control plants was observed. Putrescine levels were significantly increased in these transgenic plants. The study suggested the possible presence of an inter-conversion process from spermidine to putrescine in transgenic plants, triggered by over-expression of SpdSyn mRNAs. Novel insect resistance gene constructs encoding fusion proteins, including (1) rice thioredoxin h fused with snowdrop lectin-GNA (TRX-GNA), (2) the first domain of Bt toxin gene-Cry 1 Ac fused with GNA (Ac-GNA) and (3) Cry 1 Ac fused with ricin B chain-RTB (Ac-RTB) were assembled. When expressed in transgenic plant, these fusion proteins displayed an additive effect as insect toxins by maintaining the functional properties of the individual proteins. Artificial diet bioassays against insect pests showed that using these fusion proteins could enhance toxicity, insecticidal spectrum and possibly durability of resistance to insect pests. Our results clearly showed that transgenic rice plants expressing these fusion protein genes are resistant to brown planthopper, an important insect pest in tropical rice growing areas.

Similarly at 7, 8 and 9 WAT, Landrace 4 and VAM had the least number of aphids making them resistant to aphid infestations than the other susceptible varieties. The low aphid scores observed in Landrace 4 and VAM can be explained by the presence of hairy leaf characteristics of the two lines which makes it difficult for aphids to probe and insert their style into the leaf so as to extract sap. Results are consistent with the past two seasons which showed that Landrace 4 and VAM were resistant to aphid infestations.

40|$|The {{ecological}} {{consequences of}} releasing a {{genetically modified organism}} into a novel environment will depend upon its establishment, dispersal, and interactions with other organisms. Establishment and dispersal in the population dynamics of weedy plants are discussed by Jordan (these proceedings). My task is to discuss the known effects of plant-feeding insects on populations of native weedy plants, which provide the best current predictive basis for assessing the potential ecological consequences of the movement of resistance genes from genetically modified crops into their native weedy relatives. The focus of our research over the last 20 years has been on understanding and predicting the quantitative outcome of plant-feeding by insects on the density, distribution, and lifetime reproductive success of native weedy plants. In {{the context of this}} workshop, these data can be used to address: (1) what is the evidence that insect herbivores can limit plant population density, restrict plant distribution, or reduce lifetime reproduction of native weedy plants? (2) under what circumstances is such limitation strongest or most likely? and, (3) when might increased resistance to insects alter the weed status of presently innocuous weedy plants? Experimental evidence that feeding by insect herbivores can influence the growth, reproduction, and population density of native herbaceous plants has accumulated over the last 25 years (see reviews: Crawley 1983, 1997; Parker 1985; Hendrix 1988; Weis and Berenbaum 1989; Louda 1989, 1995). From these studies it is clear that herbivorous insects, either singly or in combination, often significantly limit both the success of individual plants and the densities of populations of native weedy plants. Increased insect resistance in such cases would result in a reduction in control exerted by insects on plants and would lead to a prediction of increased weediness of the native plant species. To illustrate the influence of insects on plants and to explore the circumstances under which insect herbivores {{have been shown to be}} crucial in limiting plant density, I would like to review the highlights of two of our research projects. The first concerns a native crucifer that is related to canola and wild radish (Brassicaceae). The second project concerns a group of native thistles that are related to sunflower (Asteraceae). In addition, I will review some of the implications of these data for anticipating potential ecological responses to altered <b>insect</b> <b>pest</b> <b>resistance</b> introduced into related weedy native plants. In the absence of direct tests on the role of insects in the dynamics of crop-related weedy native species, these studies can be used as the best models presently available to assess the role of insects and insect resistance in the dynamics of native weed populations...|$|E
40|$|The {{advantages}} of Integrated Pest Management (IPM) for farmers {{in developing countries}} have been clear for many years. It cuts production costs by reducing reliance on expensive agrochemicals, reduces hazards to both humans and the environment and, at the same time, stabilizes yields by ensuring the survival of natural enemies of major pests. Yet its use is not understood. Why is this so? The idea of integrated pest management is not new. The original definition envisaged 'applied pest control which integrates biological and chemical control. Chemical control is used in a manner which is least disruptive to biological control'. Many scientists would now regard such a definition as too restrictive and would view chemical control {{as a last resort}} when other methods fail to keep a pest in check. More recently, the concept of IPM has been applied to the integrated control of different types of pests (for example, insects, diseases and weeds) in the same crop. Although originally distinct, the two terms integrated control and IPM are now used almost interchangeably to imply both concepts. The essential features of IPM are straightforward, although their application in specific cases requires considerable understanding of the biology of the pests involved and their natural enemies. They include three important principles. Firstly, wherever feasible, control should rely on natural enemies of pests; methods that seriously disrupt natural regulation of pest populations should never be used. Secondly, natural enemies should be enhanced, either directly or indirectly, and plant resistance used to reduce the necessity for expensive chemical control. The third principle is that chemical control should be selective and should only be used as and when pest populations increase to a level above which serious economic loss will result. The last of these principles needs further explanation. In most cases, pest populations will be low following planting but, in the absence of adequate natural controls, will increase rapidly as the crop develops. However, up until a certain level, there will be little or no damage of economic significance to the crop. The population level at which significant economic damage is observed is known as the economic threshold for a given pest and only above this threshold is chemical control employed. In this way, natural enemies are allowed to build up and expensive chemicals are not wasted. The economic threshold is obviously a moving target and differs between crops, pest species and, since it is dependent on the market value of a given crop, between seasons. Nevertheless, use of economic thresholds has proved its value in reducing crop production costs and is now very widely used in pest control schemes. The components of integrated pest control The weapons available to the farmer are of four types; biological control, cultural control, selective pesticide use and plant resistance. Biological control using natural enemies of pests can be achieved through introduction of predators, parasites or diseases. Introduction (in some cases re-introduction) of natural enemies is now a familiar concept. Although there have been some spectacular successes, for example the control of prickly pear by the moth Cactoblastis cactorium in Australia and of cottony cushion scale on citrus in California, it should be said that less than half of all attempts at biological control by introduction have been successful. While the reasons for this are complex, it does emphasize the importance of retaining existing control agents through the rational use of pesticides. This is particularly true in the tropics where many crops face dozens of different pest species. Although the effect of any one member of this pest complex may be relatively minor, in combination they can cause drastic losses. To introduce specific predators or parasites for each pest would be totally uneconomic, even if they could be found; enhancement of existing natural enemies, many of which feed non-selectively, is a more sensible alternative. Cultural control, which involves manipulation of the crop and its surrounding habitat aims to increase the chance of survival of natural enemies or reduce that of the pests. One obvious technique is to practice mixed cropping rather than monoculture. This can both reduce the size of pest populations by limiting the food resource available and provide alternative refuges for natural enemies. Intercropping has similar aims but on a finer scale. Other techniques include the provision of refuges (not necessarily a crop species) or food sources for natural enemies. In some situations, complete weeding of the crop may reduce yields since 'weeds' can provide both refuges and food sources for natural enemies. Destruction of crop residues by removal or burning can sometimes be successfully used to interrupt the development of pests that have a resting stage in such residues. Selective pesticide use is another possible approach. The most important facet of selective pesticide use is employing economic thresholds to limit the amount of chemicals applied. However, modern developments in both pesticides and their application can also reduce the need to spray the crop. Several insecticides now available have some degree of inherent selectivity. An example is Endosulfan (Thiodan), which is effective against a wide variety of crop pests but which, at recommended application rates, has little effect on the minute parasitic wasps that are important natural enemies of many pests. When used in ultra-low volume formulation for control of tsetse flies, this insecticide was found to have virtually no detectable effect on other insect populations. Insecticides that are based on hormonal growth regulators or on microbial agents also show some degree of selectivity in their action. Even more selectivity can be achieved by careful formulation and application of pesticides. Because systemic insecticides are taken up through the foliage or roots of the plant they are only available to the chewing or sucking insects that attack it. The same principle applies to insecticides that are encapsulated, wrapped in a coating of gelatine or similar inert substance. The tiny capsules adhere {{to the surface of the}} plant and the insecticide can only be taken up by biting insects that feed on the plant. This avoids risk to predators and parasites. New application techniques can reduce the amounts of pesticide required to achieve effective control. Ultra low-volume (ULV) spraying is now widely used, particularly for aerial application. A rotating nozzle breaks the spray up into a haze of minute droplets. The droplets are sufficiently small that they can pass directly into the insect's body through the spiracles, the pores through which insects, breathe, killing them more rapidly. In this way, the amounts of insecticide required for effective control can be drastically reduced, often by as much as one hundredfold. One disadvantage of ULV spraying is that the droplets are so small that they are blown away by even the lightest breeze, reducing effectiveness. An ingenious technique called electrostatic deposition avoids this problem by giving each droplet a minute positive electric charge. The surface of the plant has a small negative charge, attracting droplets to the plant cuticle, where they are deposited. The pesticide is effectively 'glued' to the plant by electric forces! A cheap, portable sprayer, using this principle has now been marketed and has proved extremely effective in the Third World, particularly for the control of cotton pests. Plant resistance is a further option in IPM. Plant breeding has played a crucial role in the prevention of crop losses due to diseases throughout the 20 th century, and disease-resistance is a major objective in the development of new crop varieties. The concept of breeding for <b>insect</b> <b>pest</b> <b>resistance</b> is a more recent one but has had considerable success and is being actively pursued, particularly for tropical crops. A good example is the range of rice varieties developed at the International Rice Research Institute (IRRI) in the Philippines. IRRI has bred varieties resistant to four of the major insect pests of rice which are now very widely grown in S. E. Asia. Several varieties are available which combine resistance to three of the four major pests. Insect resistant varieties of cowpea, an important tropical pulse, have been developed at the International Institute of Tropical Agriculture (IITA) in Nigeria using advanced biotechnologies. Successes in integrated control One of the earliest examples of successful IPM comes from the Canete Valley in Peru, where from the 1940 s, cotton was grown as a monocrop with extremely heavy use of insecticides. By 1955, yields plummeted following blanket application of organochlorine and organophosphorus insecticides which resulted in breakdown of natural biological control and the development of pest resistance. In 1956, the government introduced compulsory crop rotation and mixed cropping and enforced a return to older insecticides. One of these, lead arsenate, is a stomach poison which only kills insects that chew the plant and is ineffective against natural insect enemies. These measures were combined with regular inspection of the crop for pests so that insecticides were only used when pest populations exceeded the economic threshold. Cotton yields rapidly recovered to levels close to those before the crisis and the Canete Valley remains today, over 40 years later, a major cotton producing area of Peru. Integrated control of pests has not been widely used in Africa but there have been some successes. The common coffee mealybug was a major pest of coffee in Kenya where its populations had exploded due to resistance to persistent organochlorine insecticides and to loss of natural enemies. Restrictions on the use of these insecticides, combined with the introduction and dissemination of a minute parasitic wasp (Anagyrus sp.) brought the pest back under control. Similarly, in Tanzania a major pest of sugar cane, the sugar cane scale insect, has been successfully controlled by carefully timed insecticide application in conjunction with the release of a ladybird beetle which preys specifically on the pest. Cassava, an important staple crop for some 200 million people in Africa, is seriously threatened by the cassava mealybug, accidentally introduced from South America 20 years ago. In this case, classical biological control is proving highly successful. A parasite of the mealybug, itself from South America, is released from the air and has successfully controlled the bug over large areas of West and Central Africa. In Asia, Indonesia experienced a severe reduction in rice yields in recent years due to the ravages of the Brown Planthopper. This has resulted from excessive use of insecticides, to many of which the planthopper now shows resistance. By 1986, 100, 000 hectares of rice had been destroyed by this pest alone, despite 4 to 5 applications of insecticide in each growing season. In 1988, the Indonesian government took the decision to ban the use of 57 different types of insecticides and to reduce severely the use of the recommended Carbamate insecticides. This has allowed populations of natural enemies to recover and to provide adequate control of the planthopper. Between 1986 and 1988, average yields of rice in Indonesia increased from 6. 1 tonnes per hectare to 7. 4 tonnes per hectare, a gain of 21 % in two years. Considering this was achieved simply by reducing the amount of insecticide applied, and, thus, production costs, the {{advantages of}} rational insecticide use had been confirmed. As a result, FAO is now planning experimental programmes of integrated rice pest control in 6 other countries in the region. The problems IPM is not a panacea and, as with biological control, there have been failures as well as successes. Clearly, IPM requires that farmers have a better knowledge of both the pests and their natural enemies than is the case with simple chemical control. It is also difficult for farmers to 'do nothing' until the pest reaches an economic threshold, even though it is clearly present in the crop. This is particularly true if, previously, they have been advised to spray at the first signs of the presence of pests. Neither can IPM be used against all types of pests. It has proved impossible to devise schemes for highly migratory pests, such as locusts, and soil nests. such as termites. The future of integrated control IPM is used on only a very small proportion of the world's crops. Apart from the problems mentioned above, the rapid development of synthetic pyrethroid insecticides since the 1970 s has largely overcome the problems of pest resistance to earlier insecticides. Nevertheless, the need for more rational pest management will grow. The problem of pest resistance will not simply go away (some insects already show resistance to pyrethroids) and the cost of agrochemicals, which are largely oil-based, is likely to continue to rise sharply. Several of the components of IPM are now widely used in crop protection in the industrialized countries. Crop surveillance, combined with the use of an economic threshold for chemical control, is now widely used in such crops as cotton, alfalfa, tobacco and many fruit crops. And biological control has proved particularly successful for glasshouse crops, where chemical control poses particular problems and where there is good environmental control. What, then, is the likely future of IPM in the tropics ? The need for food security has lead to greater emphasis on sustainable agriculture, within which IPM can play a crucial role. It has proved most successful where farmers have sufficient resources and education to exploit the possibilities of longer term control strategies, but there are many developing countries, particularly in Africa, where this does not yet apply. In the medium term, it is likely that more rational use of insecticides, based on crop surveillance, is likely to increase, if only for economic reasons. Whether this will develop into fully integrated control in the longer term will probably depend more on economic and political factors than on purely technical considerations. Above all, successful introduction of IPM depends critically on reasonably stable and fair prices for agricultural produce, both staple foods for home consumption and cash crops for export. The advantages of Integrated Pest Management (IPM) for farmers in developing countries have been clear for many years. It cuts production costs by reducing reliance on expensive agrochemicals, reduces hazards to both humans and the environment and, [...] ...|$|E

With the availability of SoySNP 50 K and the statistical power of genome-wide association studies, we integrated phenotypic data for beet armyworm, Mexican bean beetle (MBB), potato leafhopper (PLH), SBA, soybean looper (SBL), velvetbean caterpillar (VBC), and chewing damage caused by unspecified insects for a comprehensive understanding of insect resistance in the United States Department of Agriculture Soybean Germplasm Collection. We identified significant single nucleotide (SNP) polymorphic markers for MBB, PLH, SBL, and VBC, and we highlighted several leucine-rich repeat-containing genes and myeloblastosis transcription factors within the high linkage disequilibrium region surrounding significant SNP markers. Specifically for soybean resistance to PLH, we found the PLH locus is close but distinct to a locus for soybean pubescence density on chromosome 12.

This study was designed to determine the presence of phosphine resistance in 34 populations of Rhyzopertha dominica (F.) collected from the United States and Canada. Adult R. dominica were sampled and subjected to a discriminatory dose toxicity assay of exposure to 20 ppm of phosphine for 20 h of exposure to distinguish a susceptible R. dominica adult by death from a resistant beetle that survives the treatment. All but two of the 34 geographic populations surveyed had some beetles that were resistant to phosphine, and the frequency of resistance varied from 97 % in a population from Parlier, California to 0 % in beetles from both Carnduff, Saskatchewan and Starbuck, Manitoba. Probit analyses of dose-mortality bioassays with beetles from a laboratory-susceptible strain and those from five of the populations sampled were used to calculate resistance ratio factors (RRs) based on the ratio of LC 50 (estimate for the concentration to kill 50 % of a test group) in the sampled population to the LC 50 for the susceptible strain. The highest RR for the five resistant populations was nearly 596 -fold in beetles from Belle Glade, Florida, whereas the lowest RR in that group was 9 -fold in Wamego, Kansas.
