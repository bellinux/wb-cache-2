40|$|The Cambrian age Blow Me <b>Down</b> Brook <b>formation</b> of the Humber Arm Allochthon {{has been}} poorly {{understood}} since geological study {{began in the}} area more than 140 years ago. A detailed study has never been carried out exclusively on the formation, nor a complete stratigraphy designated. The aim of this thesis is to compose a stratigraphy for the Blow Me <b>Down</b> Brook <b>formation</b> based upon sedimentology, petrography and ichnology. [...] Regional mapping of coastal sedimentary strata from the community of Fox Island River, north to Rope Cove is used to show extensive and continuous sections of Blow Me <b>Down</b> Brook <b>formation.</b> These exposures, paired with a recently documented basal contact between Blow Me Down Brook red shale beds and underlying Fox Island River volcanics, have allowed development of a composite stratigraphy for the Blow Me <b>Down</b> Brook <b>formation.</b> The formation, herein estimated to be about 400 m thick, is formed of six informal, but distinct stratigraphic units: A, B, C, D, E and F. Unit A, massive red shale interbedded with volcanics; Unit B, thick bedded red (hematitic) and greenish coloured micaceous sublithrenite and lithic subarkose; Unit C, quartz and feldspar pebble conglomerate with calcarenite boulders; Unit D, coarse grained greenish coloured quartzarenite and sublitharenite with minor subarkose interbedded with red, green and grey shale; Unit E, massive siliceous red and black shale, and Unit F; a quartzose greenish sandstone interbedded with black shales. [...] The sandstones of Unit F are commonly petroliferous, and tend {{to be associated with}} the calcareous Northern Head Group. One area (near Sluice Brook) shows evidence for a petroleum system in the Blow Me <b>Down</b> Brook <b>formation.</b> Here, petroliferous Blow Me <b>Down</b> Brook <b>formation</b> overlies the Northern Head Group in an antiformal structure. The shales of the Northern Head Group have a 'greasy' texture and may have acted as a source rock; overlying beds of red shales form a seal. [...] The Blow Me <b>Down</b> Brook <b>formation</b> is derived from offshore turbidity flows, with little understanding of how the formation relates to the Summerside and Irishtown formations of the same age. With knowledge of the stratigraphy and petrography stronger arguments may be made for correlating the Summerside formation with lower units A and B of the Blow Me <b>Down</b> Brook <b>formation.</b> The more quartzose upper units C, D, E, and F of the Blow Me <b>Down</b> Brook <b>formation</b> may be correlated to the Irishtown formation. [...] By careful recognition of strata and successions, it may be feasible to effectively map these rocks across the region. ...|$|R

40|$|In {{this study}} the {{characterization}} and soot oxidation activity of Ag-based catalysts deposited on alumina, ceria and zirconia have been investigated. The combustion of soot {{was shown to}} be promoted {{by the presence of}} silver, especially in a zero valent state, over all the supports investigated. Presence of silver in a positive oxidation state is favoured with CeO(2), while zero valent silver dominates over alumina and zirconia. This is likely attributed to the oxygen storage capacity of ceria which stabilizes silver in an oxidized form. Soot oxidation starts at low temperature (around 500 K for Ag on ZrO(2)) with a T(50) in the range of 600 - 640 K. Deactivation under strong ageing conditions (1023 K for 12 h) is negligible with alumina and zirconia, while in the presence of ceria, which slows <b>down</b> <b>formation</b> of metallic silver from Ag(2) O, loss of activity following thermal treatments at high temperatures becomes more intense...|$|R

40|$|Graduation date: 2007 Hatchability of the fertilized avian egg is {{impacted}} by factors {{which can be}} categorized as being either genetic or environmental in nature. An elevated incubation temperature, > 100 F reduces development time (time, days to hatch), but increases embryonic mortality and lowers the numbers of fertile eggs that will hatch. Embryonic failures, which affect hatchability are expressed at varying times in development. One such embryonic period is associated with <b>down</b> <b>formation.</b> In the mid-shaft portion of the developing feather plumule a condition referred to as clubbed down has been described. This condition was recognized in 1937, but the precise origins of this disorder remain unclear. Genetic studies conducted in this thesis have revealed that clubbed down in Coturnix quail is the expression of an autosomal recessive gene in the homozygous state whose expression is modulated by incubation at a temperature of 102 F. Results of selected matings of carriers for clubbed down suggest that the condition is expressed in embryos that are homozygous for the recessive gene. The responsible gene appears to be temperature sensitive in its expression...|$|R
