Having invested this effort, how can we store the result for later use, or communicate it to others while preserving our trust in its validity? This paper discusses the use of digital signatures to store and exchange theorems in a secure way. 1 Introduction Suppose you {{have gone to the}} trouble of proving a theorem using a mechanical theorem prover. <b>If</b> <b>your</b> <b>work</b> is to <b>have</b> any enduring value, {{you have to be able}} to save your result for later use and communicate it to others. A theorem prover should allow its users to create and modify theorems only in a sound way. However, once outside the theorem prover [...] - for example while saved on disk or being transmitted elsewhere [...] - nothing protects a result from being modified in other ways. At present, this problem is not really addressed in the design of mechanical theorem provers. Some theorem provers [...] - like GETFOL [9] and Isabelle [16] [...] - can not sa [...] ...|$|R

Ground yourself in the universal principle so that your behaviour is wholesome and effective. If you do that, you will earn trust and respect, and be a powerful influence. Your behaviour influences others through a ripple effect. Everyone influences everyone else, powerful people are powerful influences. For perspective of Laozi’s wisdom, we understand <b>if</b> <b>your</b> life <b>works,</b> you influence <b>your</b> organization; <b>if</b> <b>your</b> organization <b>works,</b> <b>your</b> organization influences the community; <b>if</b> <b>your</b> community <b>works,</b> <b>your</b> community influences the nation; <b>if</b> <b>your</b> nation <b>works,</b> <b>your</b> nation influences the world, and <b>if</b> <b>your</b> world <b>works,</b> the ripple effect spreads through the cosmos. Your influence begins with you and ripples outward. So be sure that your influence is both potent and wholesome.|$|R

For Arendt, this was the lowest form of human activity (all living creatures are capable of this). [...] "Work" [...] is the process of creating—a painter may create a great work of art, a writer may create a great work of fiction, etc. For Arendt, [...] "working" [...] is a worthwhile endeavor. Through <b>your</b> <b>works,</b> people may remember you; and <b>if</b> <b>your</b> <b>work</b> is great enough, you may be remembered for thousands of years. Arendt notes that people still read the Illiad, and Homer will be remembered for as long as people keep telling his stories. However, Arendt argues, the Illiad is only still read because of its protagonist: Achilles. For Arendt, Achilles embodies [...] "action."
