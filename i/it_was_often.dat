5|$|At {{its peak}} of popularity, the Large Black was used mainly for meat production, {{especially}} bacon. The {{meat from the}} Large Black {{is known for its}} lean quality and flavour without an excess of back fat, but for commercial production <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>often</b> crossed with the Yorkshire and Middle White pigs, producing a vigorous hybrid that was well regarded by farmers. However, today commercial processors do not favour the black skin of the purebred Large Black.|$|E
5|$|Begin Again premiered on September 7, 2013 at the Toronto International Film Festival, where The Weinstein Company {{acquired}} the U.S. distribution {{rights to the}} film for $7 million. It was later screened on April 26, 2014 on the closing night of the Tribeca Film Festival. The film's title was changed from Can a Song Save Your Life? to Begin Again between its festival premiere and its theatrical release because viewers {{found it difficult to}} remember and <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>often</b> misquoted.|$|E
5|$|Bismuth metal {{has been}} known since ancient times, {{although}} <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>often</b> confused with lead and tin, which share some physical properties.

5|$|Despite {{his success}} as a producer, West's true {{aspiration}} {{was to be a}} rapper. Though he had developed his rapping long before he began producing, <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>often</b> a challenge for West to be accepted as a rapper, and he struggled to attain a record deal. Multiple record companies ignored him because he did not portray the 'gangsta image' prominent in mainstream hip hop at the time. After a series of meetings with Capitol Records, West was ultimately denied an artist deal.|$|E

From the Middle Ages to the 19th century <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>often</b> worn by bankers, merchants country gentlemen {{and others who}} were wealthy but not members of the nobility. The benches in the House of Commons of the United Kingdom, where the landed gentry sat, are colored green.|$|E
5|$|In addition, <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>often</b> {{claimed that}} the Party did not allow any member to resign, so {{a person who had}} been a member for a short time decades {{previously}} could be considered as suspect as a current member. Many of the hearings and trials of McCarthyism featured testimony by former Communist Party members such as Elizabeth Bentley, Louis Budenz, and Whittaker Chambers, speaking as expert witnesses.|$|E

5|$|The {{responsibility}} of the recovery {{was transferred to the}} Governor of Svalbard on 30 August, since there were no survivors. In addition, police personnel from the mainland were transferred to Svalbard to work with the investigation and recovery. The work was supplemented by local volunteers. Because of the bad weather, which included fog and snow, <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>often</b> impossible to transport workers to the plateau, and work therefore started in the valley.|$|E
50|$|<b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>often</b> {{cultivated}} as a flowering tree.

According to music critics, her presence may have increased the emotion in Ware's and Gaye's conception of I Want You.|$|E
5|$|Two unusual {{events have}} been recorded. Firstly, in 1940 No.6221 Queen Elizabeth had its Caledonian blue colour scheme {{replaced}} by the crimson lake, the only such instance.

Such an event has, probably uniquely, been captured on film.|$|E
5|$|According to Mifune, in 1904 Maeda lost to Yoshitake Yoshio by hane goshi, after {{defeating}} three adversaries in succession, but in {{a following}} tsukinami-shiai defeated eight adversaries {{in a row and}} was awarded the rank of 4th dan (yondan). Mifune also states that Maeda {{was one of the most}} vigorous promoters of judo, although not by teaching the art, instead generating recognition of judo through his many combats with contenders from other disciplines. Maeda treated experienced and inexperienced students alike, throwing them as if in real combat. He reasoned that this behavior was a measure of respect towards his students, but <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>often</b> misunderstood and frightened many youngsters, who would abandon him in favor of other professors.|$|E

5|$|Ancient {{people of}} Chamba {{were known to}} have worn a fine woolen blanket or chadar around the waist, to keep warm in the cold climate. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>often</b> tied or girdled with a band or patka, as {{evidenced}} by some archaeological discoveries in the area depicting this fashion. The Gaddi people have traditionally worn white embroidered caps and loose-fitting white woolen garments known as a chola, tied around the waist with a black wool rope. A local custom in Chamba was to give the Jogi of the Natha sect a cotton maikhal sheet to wear over the head during the Nuwala ceremony to honour Lord Siva. Chamba and the surrounding district have been well documented as being a producer of fine cloth and embroidered dresses for centuries.|$|E
5|$|DPB and bronchiolitis obliterans are {{two forms}} of primary bronchiolitis. Specific {{overlapping}} features of both diseases include strong cough with large amounts of often pus-filled sputum; nodules viewable on lung X-rays in the lower bronchi and bronchiolar area; and chronic sinusitis. In DPB, the nodules are more restricted to the respiratory bronchioles, while in OB they are often found in the membranous bronchioles (the initial non-cartilaginous section of the bronchiole, that divides from the tertiary bronchus) up to the secondary bronchus. OB is a bronchiolar disease with worldwide prevalence, while DPB has more localized prevalence, predominantly in Japan. Prior to clinical recognition of DPB in recent years, <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>often</b> misdiagnosed as bronchiectasia, COPD, IPF, phthisis miliaris, sarcoidosis or alveolar cell carcinoma.|$|E
5|$|During the Palladian revival {{period in}} Ireland, even quite modest mansions were {{cast in a}} neo-Palladian mould. Palladian {{architecture}} in Ireland subtly differs from that in England. While adhering as in other countries to the basic ideals of Palladio, it is often truer to them – perhaps because <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>often</b> designed by architects who had come directly from mainland Europe, and therefore were not influenced by the evolution that Palladianism was undergoing in Britain. Whatever the reason, Palladianism still had to be adapted for the wetter, colder weather.|$|E
