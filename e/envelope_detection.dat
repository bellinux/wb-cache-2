Since there is no high gain IF amplifier utilizing automatic gain control (AGC), the baseband output level may vary over a very wide range dependent on the received signal strength. This is one major technical challenge which limited the practicability of the design. Another issue is the inability of this design to implement <b>envelope</b> <b>detection</b> of AM signals. Thus direct demodulation of AM or FM signals (as used in broadcasting) requires phase locking the local oscillator to the carrier frequency, a much more demanding task compared to the more robust envelope detector or ratio detector at the output of an IF stage in a superheterodyne design. However this can be avoided {{in the case of a}} direct-conversion design using quadrature detection followed by digital signal processing. Using software radio techniques, the two quadrature outputs can be processed in order to perform any sort of demodulation and filtering on down-converted signals from frequencies close to the local oscillator frequency.

An example MS envelope recorded at N.JUOH is shown in Fig.  2 b. Although the typical coda amplitude during a single earthquake decays smoothly and monotonically with elapsed time (summarized in Sato et al. 2012, Ch. 2 – 3), the coda amplitude at N.JUOH does not show monotonic decay, but instead shows several sudden increases in amplitude within the coda envelope.

One critical technology enabler is ubiquitous and unobtrusive wireless connectivity activated by ambient events and operated with little human intervention for con-figuration and maintenance. Commercial off-the-shelf radio devices cannot achieve the desired performance, reliability and ultra-low power consumption around 100 µW at the same time. In this work, research is carried out on the design and implementation of an ultra-low-power radio for generic wireless event-driven applications including healthcare, information and enter-tainment, industrial and home automation, as well as environment monitoring. To fulfill the stringent power budget, the <b>envelope</b> <b>detection</b> and the direct-modulation are the architectures of choice for receiver and transmitter front-ends, respectively. However, such radios suffer from poor sensitivity and frequency selectivity, and thus are unable to op-erate reliably across the desired link distance or {{in the presence of}} interference. This work investigated the root causes of insufficient sensitivity and selectivity in <b>envelope</b> <b>detection</b> receivers, and proposed design guidelines to optimize their performance. Furthermore, two novel <b>envelope</b> <b>detection</b> schemes have been proposed. The synchronized-switching technique improves the sensitivity by suppressing DC offset and 1 /f noise in the receiver, while the 2 -tone signaling technique enables in-band interference rejection which was not possible in prior arts. Prototype circuits have been built to verify the proposed techniques. On a 90 nm CMOS technology, a transmitter and a receiver front-end are designed to benchmark the performance of 2 -tone <b>envelope</b> <b>detection</b> in practice.

We aimed to ascertain which chromosomal origin encodes the pathogenic ENV protein by genomic analysis of the HERV-W insertions. Methods/resultsIn silico analyses allowed to uncover putative open reading frames containing the specific sequence previously reported for MSRV-like <b>envelope</b> (env) <b>detection.</b> Out of the 261 genomic insertions of HERV-W env, only 9 copies harbor the specific primers and probe featuring MSRV-like env. The copy from chromosome 20 was further studied considering its size, a truncated homologue of the functional HERV-W env sequence encoding syncytin. High Resolution Melting analysis of this sequence identified two single nucleotide polymorphisms, subsequently genotyped by Taqman chemistry in 668 MS patients and 678 healthy controls. No significant association of these polymorphisms with MS risk was evidenced. Transcriptional activity of this MSRV-like env copy was detected in peripheral blood mononuclear cells from patients and controls. RNA expression levels of chromosome 20 -specific MSRV-like env did not show significant differences between MS patients and controls, neither were related to genotypes of the two mentioned polymorphisms.
