They discuss how they <b>do</b> <b>not</b> <b>feel</b> grown up and how being an adult is not necessarily a good thing.|$|E
5|$|People with {{hypothyroidism}} who <b>do</b> <b>not</b> <b>feel</b> well despite optimal levothyroxine dosing may request adjunctive {{treatment with}} liothyronine. A 2012 guideline from the European Thyroid Association recommends that support {{should be offered}} {{with regards to the}} chronic nature of the disease and that other causes of the symptoms should be excluded. Addition of liothyronine should be regarded as experimental, initially only for a trial period of 3 months, and in a set ratio to the current dose of levothyroxine. The guideline explicitly aims to enhance the safety of this approach and to counter its indiscriminate use.|$|E
5|$|When Philip Sclater first {{described}} the black catbird in 1858, from a specimen collected in Omoa Honduras, he assigned {{it to the}} monotypic genus Melanoptila, which he created at the same time. At least one subsequent ornithologist assigned the species to the genus Turdus, believing {{it to be a}} thrush, but most agreed with Sclater's assessment. DNA studies have since shown that it is most closely related to various endemic Antillean mimids and the gray catbird, and it is sometimes included with the latter species in the genus Dumetella. Although some taxonomists place the birds from Mexico's Cozumel Island in a separate subspecies (M. g. cozumelana), most authorities <b>do</b> <b>not</b> <b>feel</b> that such distinction is warranted and the species is generally regarded as monotypic throughout its range.|$|E

5|$|Due {{to several}} {{successful}} {{television and radio}} campaigns by the Malawian government and non-governmental organizations in Malawi, levels of awareness regarding HIV/AIDS are high among the general population. However, many men have adopted fatalistic attitudes {{in response to the}} epidemic, convincing themselves that death from AIDS is inevitable; on the other hand, some have implemented preventative techniques such as partner selection to try to reduce their risk of infection. Although many women have developed strategies to protect themselves from HIV, {{women are more likely to}} be HIV-positive than men in Malawi. The epidemic has affected sexual relationships between partners, who must cooperate to protect themselves from the disease. In addition, many teachers exclude HIV/AIDS from their curricula because they are uncomfortable discussing the topic or because they <b>do</b> <b>not</b> <b>feel</b> knowledgeable about the issue, and, therefore, many children are not exposed to information about HIV/AIDS at school. Finally, the epidemic has produced significant numbers of orphans in Malawi, leaving children vulnerable to abuse and exploitation.|$|E

25|$|Occupational {{stress is}} stress related to one's job.

25|$|Female {{resistance}} to traumatic insemination varies from one species to another. Females from some genera, including Cimex, are passive {{prior to and}} during traumatic insemination. Females in other genera resist mating and attempt to escape.

25|$|Discrimination {{and racism}} against Israeli Ethiopians is still perpetuated.

Interviewed students of Ethiopian origin affirm that they <b>do</b> <b>not</b> <b>feel</b> accepted in Israeli society, due to a very strong discrimination towards them.|$|E
25|$|Overall a {{majority}} of military brats report having developed a kind of extra-adaptability and assimilate into new situations quickly and well, as they have done with each {{move to a new}} military base, town or country. Yet paradoxically, long-term feelings of being an outsider in relation to civilian (non-military) culture are common to {{a majority}} of military brats. For example, one major study shows that 32% of military brats feel as if they are only spectators on U.S. life, and another 48% <b>do</b> <b>not</b> <b>feel</b> as if they are central to any group.|$|E

25|$|In 2014, the U.S. Veterans Health Administration (VHA) is {{providing}} healthcare services for approximately one million {{gay and lesbian}} veterans. With {{the repeal of the}} Don’t Ask, Don’t Tell policy, more gay and lesbian veterans will be seeking medical care. However, as noted by Sherman and her coauthors, there are many concerns regarding the healthcare needs of the gay and lesbian veterans, and many veterans <b>do</b> <b>not</b> <b>feel</b> that they have adequate and equitable healthcare services from the VHA. The researchers assert that veterans who are missing quality healthcare are less likely to maintain good health and positive well-being.|$|E
25|$|Grenfell {{is close}} enough to the provincial {{commercial}} and political metropole of Regina that its residents <b>do</b> <b>not</b> <b>feel</b> impossibly remote and can repair there when occasion demands; it is far enough away that a lively local community persists. The town has long been known for cultural vitality; in 1974 the University of Saskatchewan, Regina Campus choir gave a concert in the Community Hall with the audience filling the hall, students accommodated by town and farm families. Eminent provincial academics, lawyers, medical doctors, lieutenant-governors, musicians and artists either came from or spent time working in Grenfell.|$|E
25|$|The {{member states}} can assess {{merchandise}} from these areas {{with the common}} external tariff used for Mercosur merchandise, or, {{in the case of}} certain special products, the domestic tariff prevailing in each individual state. In this way, the products from the free-trade zones can have the more favorable tax treatment established under Southern Common Market, given to the merchandise produced in the normal customs zones of each member state or, in the case of certain special products, can have the normal customs treatment prevailing in each nation. Products coming from outside of Mercosur are highly taxed so that local companies <b>do</b> <b>not</b> <b>feel</b> the need to compete with large international companies.|$|E

25|$|While green {{has emerged}} as the color of Taiwan {{independence}} and can be seen ubiquitously in pro-independence rallies, at the moment, no one flag has achieved consensus among the various groups. Unlike other political movements, those in Taiwan <b>do</b> <b>not</b> <b>feel</b> there is a historical or local flag suitable for use as a symbol. The flag of the short-lived Republic of Formosa is considered to be unsuitable by some, since that republic was declared by Chinese loyalists and designed as a tributary state in a failed attempt to avert Japanese colonization in 1895. The present national flag, the flag of the Republic of China, is seen by others as a symbol of Chinese nationalism.|$|E
25|$|The film follows Lăzărescu's {{journey through}} the night, as he is carried from one {{hospital}} to the next. At the first three hospitals, the doctors, after much delay, reluctantly agree to examine Lăzărescu. Then, although finding that he is gravely ill and needs emergency surgery, each team refuses to admit him and sends him to another hospital. Meanwhile, Lăzărescu's condition deteriorates rapidly, his speech is reduced to babbling, and he slowly loses consciousness. The hospitals are jammed with injured passengers from a bus accident, but some doctors appear to reject him out of fatigue or because they <b>do</b> <b>not</b> <b>feel</b> like {{taking care of a}} smelly old drunkard. During the night, his only advocate is Mioara, the paramedic who stubbornly stays by him and tries to get him hospitalized and treated, while passively accepting verbal abuse from the doctors who look down on her.|$|E
25|$|Sherman and her coauthors {{conducted}} {{a study on the}} communications between the gay and lesbian veterans with their VHA providers and the experiences regarding their healthcare services. Most of them report dissatisfaction with their medical treatment. Many veterans state that they do not receive the necessary support from VHA medical providers. Moreover, they claim that their healthcare providers are not receptive to their medical needs, and they have never been asked about their sexual orientation. Most of the veterans report that they <b>do</b> <b>not</b> <b>feel</b> at ease with their healthcare providers. The results of the study also show that some gay and lesbian veterans are disinclined to seek medical treatment from the VHA, {{and some of them are}} having trouble in finding equitable healthcare services. Based on the study, there are some inherent problems in the healthcare provisions for the gay and lesbian veterans.|$|E
