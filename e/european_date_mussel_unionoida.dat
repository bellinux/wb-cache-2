40|$|Colonization {{patterns}} of the <b>date</b> <b>mussel</b> Lithophaga lithophaga (L., 1758) on limestone breakwater boulders of a marina Background and Purpose: The <b>European</b> <b>date</b> <b>mussel</b> (Lithophaga lithophaga) is widespread along the whole Mediterranean rocky coastline where it is frequently but illegally harvested. It {{is well known that}} the growth of the <b>date</b> <b>mussel</b> is very slow; however, {{patterns of}} recolonization of ex-ploited surfaces have been scarcely investigated. The objective {{of this study is to}} assess colonization {{patterns of the}} <b>date</b> <b>mussel</b> on limestone boulders which have been in the sea for 19 years. These results could be useful in predicting the reconstitution of natural populations of the <b>date</b> <b>mussel</b> after harvesting. Materials and Methods: Limestone breakwater boulders were placed along the dike of the Marina of Rovinj (northern Adriatic, Istrian penin-sula, Croatia) in 1984. Sampling was carried out in summer 2003 by SCUBA diving from six habitats of different inclination and topography: horizontal, inclined, vertical, sheltered, vaults, and whole stones. The abundance and biomass of L. lithophaga at the Marina were compared with those in natural control locations. Results: At the Marina, no <b>date</b> <b>mussels</b> were found on the horizontal and inclined sides of the boulders, and very few <b>date</b> <b>mussels</b> were found on the vertical side. On the contrary, sheltered and vault sides of boulders and whole stones were intensively colonized by L. lithophaga. In vaults, the abundance was similar to that in nature. In these habitats, L. lithophaga biomass was generally lower than in nature. However, large <b>date</b> <b>mussels,</b> of lengths from 50 to 70 mm, were already present on boulders of the Marina. They amounted to 35 % in the sheltered habitat, 24 % in vaults, and 3 % of the total number in whole stones. Conclusions: An unexpected high colonization rate and growth of <b>date</b> <b>mussels</b> was detected in certain unexposed rocky habitats at the boulders of the Marina. However, on the natural rocky Istrian coast, the <b>date</b> <b>mussel</b> was mostly collected on exposed inclined and vertical rocky surfaces where repopulation after harvesting may require very long periods...|$|R

In this study, seven targeted polychlorinated byphenils (PCBs, IUPAC Nos. 28, 52, 101, 118, 138, 153, and 180) and the organochlorine pesticides (OCPs) aldrin, dieldrin, endrin, cis-chlordane, trans-chlordane and oxy-chlordane were quantified in <b>European</b> <b>date</b> <b>mussel</b> (Lithophaga lithophaga L., 1758.) collected from the Sarajevo fish market (Bosnia and Herzegovina).

40|$|The Asian <b>date</b> <b>mussel,</b> Musculista senhousia (Mytilidae), is a {{good example}} of a species that has {{dispersed}} outwards from its native area through human-mediated transport, establishing sustainable populations in distant parts of the world. The <b>date</b> <b>mussel,</b> which is endemic in the Western Pacific region, appeared and became very abundant in the Sacca di Goro, a brackish lagoon in the Po River Delta (northern Adriatic Sea, Italy) in the early 1990 s. Effects of M. senhousia on macrobenthic biodiversity were assessed over a 10 yr time period. At the study site, the increase in abundance and spread of M. senhousia resulted in an alteration of the pre-established macrobenthic community. Changes in benthic dynamics seemed apparent, through the inhibition of epifaunal, suspension-feeding taxa (Ficopomatus enigmaticus, Mytilaster minimus), and the enhancement of detritivores (Neanthes succinea, Streblospio shrubsolii, Microdeutopus gryllotalpa). It is hypothesized that the Asian <b>date</b> <b>mussel</b> was initially successful because it exploited a naturally disturbed, sparsely occupied environment, rather than interjecting itself among and displacing existing species.

40|$|The {{cultivated}} Manila clam, Ruditapes philippinarum, and the accidentally introduced Asian <b>date</b> <b>mussel,</b> Musculista senhousia, are nowadays {{the most}} abundant bivalve species in the Sacca di Goro (northeastern Italy).

Individual Mediterranean shore crabs Carcinus aestuarii were allowed to forage on the 2 bivalve species to examine crab's preference {{in light of the}} optimal foraging theory. Crabs preferred M. senhousia over R. philippinarum: mortality was higher for the former (34. 6 %) than for the latter bivalve species (9. 5 %).

40|$|Accurate {{delimitation}} of a species’ {{geographic range}} {{is important for}} conservation planning and biogeography. Geographic range limits provide insights into the ecological and historical factors that influence species distributions (Gaston 1991; Brown et al. 1996), whereas the extent of occurrence of a taxon is {{a key component of}} IUCN criteria used for assessing the conservation status of species (IUCN 2001). Freshwater <b>mussels</b> (<b>Unionoida)</b> are an ancient group of palaeoheterodont bivalves that inhabit lotic and lentic freshwater environments on every continent except Antarctica (Graf and Cummings 2006). The Australian Unionoida is represented by the Hyriidae with six genera and 18 species (Ponder and Walker 2003). The Unionoida are distinguished from other bivalves by their larval stage that are, with a few exceptions, are obligate parasites of fish and sometimes amphibians (Watters and O’Dee 1998; Wächtler et al. 2001). All freshwater mussels brood their larvae in specialised regions of the female’s gills known as ‘marsupia’ (Bauer and Wächtler 2001). In the Hyriidae, the marsupia are restricted to the inner pair of demibranchs. An opportunistic stopover along the Great Northern Highway in the eastern Pilbara region (Indian Ocean Drainage Division) of Western Australia revealed the existence of a Lortiella population in the De Grey River, the first record of the genus to occur in the region. Here we identify the species, tentatively, using shell morphology and present new observations of internal anatomy and document the contemporary range of the species’ distributions...|$|R

The course of the invasion was documented through a macrobenthic monitoring program at three sites in the Sacca. From 1994, when the new mussel was first collected, M. senhousia spread throughout the lagoon, and, within a few years, reached densities exceeding 10000 individuals m- 2. Mussel effects on biodiversity was assessed by comparing the macrobenthic community structure and composition: over a five yr-period {{some changes in the}} macrobenthic community seem to be apparent, suggesting a positive effect of the mussel on the number of species and benthic richness.

40|$|Freshwater <b>mussels</b> (<b>Unionoida)</b> are a {{very old}} group of bivalve {{molluscs}} found in rivers, lakes and other wetlands on all continents but Antarctica, which includes 854 species in two superfamilies (Unionoidea and Etherioidea) that are distinguished by larval forms. Larvae of Unionoids (Hyriidae, Margaritiferidae and Unionidae) are glochidia, distinct from the lasidia or haustoria of etherioids (Etheriidae, Iridinidae, Mycetopodidae). Unionoids are dioecious and reproduce sexually. Males release sperm into the water, which are then drawn into gills (ctenidia), of the females, where the eggs are fertilized within modified brood chambers (marsupia). The embryos then develop to become mature glochidia, and are brooded in the marsupia. They then attach to a suitable host, generally a fish, on the gills or body surface (often the fins or mouth) where they are encapsulated by epithelial tissue and, as obligate parasites, begin a metamorphosis and emerge as juvenile mussels. The host-glochidia relationship is an obligatory stage in {{the life cycle of}} mussels, and also provides a means of dispersal. Glochidial attachment is facilitated by specialized structures on the ventral margin of shells, known as larval teeth, which vary in morphology, but are generally hooked. In Australia, freshwater mussels are represented by 18 species (eight genera) of Hyriidae. Glochidia tooth morphology of Australian Hyriidae has been described for several species and implicated as a useful taxonomic tool to distinguish species.
