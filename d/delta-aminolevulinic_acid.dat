50|$|Excess {{alcohol abuse}} is {{frequently}} associated with both inducing PCT and aggravating a preexisting {{diagnosis of the}} disorder. It is thought {{to do so by}} causing oxidative damage to liver cells, resulting in oxidized species of uroporphyrinogen that inhibit the activity of hepatic UROD. It is also felt to increase the uptake of iron in liver cells, leading to further oxidation of uroporphyrinogen by the release of activated oxygen species. Additionally, exposure to chlorinated cyclic hydrocarbons can lead to a deficiency in the activity of uroporphyrinogen decarboxylase, causing the buildup of excess uroporphyrinogen. Additionally, alcohol has been shown to increase the activity of the <b>delta-aminolevulinic</b> <b>acid</b> synthetase (ALA synthetase), the rate-limiting enzymatic step in heme synthesis in the mitochondria, in rats. Therefore, alcohol consumption may increase the production of uroporphyrinogen, exacerbating symptoms in individuals with porphyria cutanea tarda.|$|E

There was no significant correlation between blood lead and urinary <b>delta-aminolevulinic</b> <b>acid</b> previous to lead exposure. However, after lead exposure significant correlation was present at days 4, 7, 10 and 14. Certain lead exposed dogs following chelation therapy were noted to have normal blood lead levels but elevated urinary <b>delta-aminolevulinic</b> <b>acid</b> suggesting that blood lead does not always correlate with metabolic effects of lead in the body.

40|$|The {{customary}} {{route in}} animals and bacteria for <b>delta-aminolevulinic</b> <b>acid</b> biosynthesis is from glycine and succinyl CoA, catalyzed by the enzyme <b>delta-aminolevulinic</b> <b>acid</b> synthetase [succinyl-CoA:glycine C-succinyltransferase (decarboxylating), EC 2. 3. 1. 37]. Attempts to demonstrate this route in {{plants have been}} unsuccessful. Evidence is given for a new enzymic route of synthesis of <b>delta-aminolevulinic</b> <b>acid</b> in plants. This route involves the incorporation of the intact five-carbon skeleton of glutamic acid into <b>delta-aminolevulinic</b> <b>acid.</b> Demonstration of the new pathway in plants has been made by feeding specifically labeled [14 C]glutamic acid to etiolated barley shoots greening in the light. In the presence of levulinate, a competitive inhibitor of <b>delta-aminolevulinic</b> <b>acid</b> dehydrastase [porphobilinogen synthase; delta-aminolevulinate hydro-lyase (adding delta-aminolevulinate and cyclizing); EC 4. 2. 1. 24], delta-aminolevulinate accumulates. The delta-aminolevulinate formed was chemically degraded by periodate to formaldehyde and succinic acid. The C 5 (formaldehyde) fragment was separated, as the 5, 5 -dimethyl- 1, 3 -cyclohexanedione (dimedone) derivative, from the C 1 -C 4 (succinic acid) fragment. The C 5 atom contained radioactivity predominantly derived from C 1 of glutamic acid. Conversely, the labeled C 3 and C 4 atoms of glutamic acid were found primarily in the succinic acid (C 1 -C 4) fragment of delta-aminolevulinate. This labeling pattern for <b>delta-aminolevulinic</b> <b>acid</b> {{is consistent with a}} biosynthetic route utilizing the intact five-carbon skeleton of alpha-ketoglutarate, glutamate, or glutamine, and is inconsistent with the <b>delta-aminolevulinic</b> <b>acid</b> synthetase pathway utilizing glycine and succinyl CoA as precursors...|$|E
40|$|The acute porphyrias in relapse are {{commonly}} treated with intravenous heme infusion {{to decrease the}} activity of <b>delta-aminolevulinic</b> <b>acid</b> synthase, normally the rate-controlling enzyme in heme biosynthesis. The biochemical effects of heme treatment are short-lived, probably {{due in part to}} heme-mediated induction of heme oxygenase, the rate-controlling enzyme for heme degradation. In this work, selected nonheme metalloporphyrins were screened for their ability to reduce <b>delta-aminolevulinic</b> <b>acid</b> synthase mRNA and induce heme oxygenase mRNA in chick embryo liver cell cultures. Of the metalloporphyrins tested, only zinc-mesoporphyrin reduced <b>delta-aminolevulinic</b> <b>acid</b> synthase mRNA without increasing heme oxygenase mRNA. The combination of zinc-mesoporphyrin and heme, at nanomolar concentrations, decreased <b>delta-aminolevulinic</b> <b>acid</b> synthase mRNA in a dose-dependent manner. The combination of zinc-mesoporphyrin (50 nM) and heme (200 nM) decreased the half-life of the mRNA for <b>delta-aminolevulinic</b> <b>acid</b> synthase from 5. 2 to 2. 5 h, while a similar decrease was produced by heme (10 microM) alone (2. 2 h). The ability of zinc-mesoporphyrin to supplement the reduction of <b>delta-aminolevulinic</b> <b>acid</b> synthase mRNA by heme, in a process similar to that observed with heme alone, provides a rationale for further investigation of this compound for eventual use as a supplement to heme therapy of the acute porphyrias and perhaps other conditions in which heme may be of benefit...|$|E

The addition of iron salts, iron chelators, hemin, or protoporphyrin to cell-free extracts did not affect the activity of these enzymes. The addition of levulinic acid to iron-deficient cultures blocked protoporphyrin excretion and also resulted in high <b>delta-aminolevulinic</b> <b>acid</b> synthase and <b>delta-aminolevulinic</b> <b>acid</b> dehydrase activities.

Gamma, delta-dioxovalerate transaminase catalyzes the formation of <b>delta-aminolevulinic</b> <b>acid</b> by a transamination reaction involving gamma, delta-dioxovalerate and alanine. To assess the significance of this alternate route, we prepared suspensions of respiring rat hepatocytes, which were incubated with optimal concentrations of various additives and then analyzed spectrophotometrically for synthesized porphyrins. No porphyrin synthesis was detected in cell suspensions incubated with succinate(1 mM) and glycine (20 mM). Cell suspensions incubated with gamma, delta-dioxovalerate (0. 5 - 1. 0 mM) and alanine (20 mM) synthesized 0. 19 nmol of porphyrin per 10 (7) cells per 2 hr (SD, 0. 057). Cell suspensions incubated with <b>delta-aminolevulinic</b> <b>acid</b> (0. 1 mM) synthesized 1. 26 nmol of porphyrin per 10 (7) cells per 2 hr (range, 1. 18 - 1. 32). Incubations with chemically synthesized gamma, delta-dioxo[5 - 14 C]valerate were followed by extraction and purification of porphyrin esters and heme. Liquid scintillation counting revealed radiolabel incorporation into both porphyrins and heme. These studies demonstrate significant tetrapyrrole synthesis by the gamma, delta-dioxovalerate transaminase reaction.

40|$|Acute {{intermittent}} porphyria (AIP) is a {{human disease}} resulting from a dominantly inherited partial deficiency of the heme biosynthetic enzyme, porphobilinogen deaminase (PBGD).

Microaerophilic growth of both mutants was less affected. Competition experiments with a rabbit model showed that strain V 286 was found in numbers 10 (3) - to 10 (4) -fold lower than its parental strain. This observation indicates that strain V 286 is impaired in its ability to colonize the rabbit intestine. It also supports an important role for aerobic growth in the colonization of the intestine by V. cholerae. Vaccination of rabbits with a single dose of strain V 286 resulted in full protection against challenge with a virulent strain. Strain V 286 was not shed from rabbits in a cultivatable form. Our results suggest that <b>delta-aminolevulinic</b> <b>acid</b> auxotrophy can attenuate V. cholerae by limiting its ability to colonize without affecting its capacity to induce protective immunity.

However, as with other cytochrome P- 450 inducers, RU- 486 may have the ability to precipitate or exacerbate attacks of acute porphyria. The acute porphyrias in relapse are associated with an increase in activity of <b>delta-aminolevulinic</b> <b>acid</b> synthase, the first and normally rate-controlling enzyme in heme biosynthesis. We have used primary cultures of chick embryo liver cells to test the ability of RU- 486 to induce <b>delta-aminolevulinic</b> <b>acid</b> synthase activity and mRNA, cytochromes P- 450, porphyrin accumulation, and heme oxygenase.

Although the C- 5, 6 unsaturation is required for the sparking function, the presence of the C- 22 unsaturation was found to facilitate sparking far better than did the C- 7 unsaturation, whereas the C- 24 methyl was the least important group. The addition of <b>delta-aminolevulinic</b> <b>acid</b> to the medium allowed the sparking of FY 3 (hem 1 erg 7 ura) on bulk cholestanol due to the derepression of 3 -hydroxy- 3 -methylglutaryl-coenzyme A reductase and the production of endogenous ergosterol. The optimal concentration of <b>delta-aminolevulinic</b> <b>acid</b> to spark growth was 800 ng/ml, whereas higher concentrations caused a growth inhibition. The growth yield of FY 3 reached a plateau maximum at about 5 micrograms/ml when the bulk cholestanol was varied in the presence of 10 ng of sparking erogosterol per ml...|$|E
40|$|Objective:Â To {{explore the}} {{association}} between lead biomarkers and their deviations in the circumstances of occupational exposure, and influence of life style factors. Material and Methods:Â We performed cross-sectional study using 60 workers occupationally exposed to lead compared with 60 controls. All examinees were assessed by Questionnaire, and laboratory testing concerning blood lead level (BLL), activity of <b>delta-aminolevulinic</b> <b>acid</b> dehydratase (ALAD) in blood, concentration of <b>delta-aminolevulinic</b> <b>acid</b> (ALA) and coproporphyrin in urine, reticulocytes and erythrocytes with basophilic stippling (EBS). Results:Â The mean values of BLL and ALA were significantly higher, and mean ALAD activity was significantly lower in lead workers than in controls. Lead workers also had {{a higher rate of}} abnormal BLL, ALAD, and ALA, significant for BLL and ALAD. The average BLL values among exposed workers and controls in men were significantly higher. There was strong inverse correlation between distribution of ALAD values in exposed workers due to their BLL values. Significant correlation with mean ALAD values was shown for alcohol consumption, form of compounds, and use of protecting equipment, whereas with mean BLL values was shown for age, gender, exposure duration, smoking, and alcohol consumption. Conclusion:Â The data confirmed {{the association between}} occupational exposure and lead biomarkers abnormalities...|$|E
40|$|Cultures of Rhizobium japonicum {{were grown}} with {{vigorous}} aeration to stationary phase and were then incubated under restricted aeration for several days. Under these "microaerobic" conditions, cellular heme content increased 10 -fold, and visible amounts of porphyrins were {{released into the}} culture medium. The two predominant porphyrins produced were identified, {{on the basis of}} their spectrophotometric and chromatographic properties, as protoporphyrin and coproporphyrin. The cytochrome complement of microaerobic cells partially resembled that of the symbiotic bacteria in that cytochromes alpha-alpha 3 were absent and a CO-binding cytochrome 552 was present. During the period of restricted aeration, at the time that the heme content was increasing, there was a similar 10 -fold increase in the activities of the first two enzymes of heme biosynthesis, <b>delta-aminolevulinic</b> <b>acid</b> synthase and <b>delta-aminolevulinic</b> <b>acid</b> dehydrase. However, during the same period, the activity of succinyl thiokinase (an enzyme that is required in large amounts whether or not heme is being produced) increased only twofold. These results suggest that reduced oxygen tension may play a role in inducing heme synthesis necessary for leghemoglobin formation and bacterial differentiation in soybean root nodules...|$|E
