25|$|A {{major part}} of the {{gameplay}} in Ties That Bind, as in the original game, concerns Torque's morality. At numerous points during the game, the player will encounter situations where they have several choices as to how to proceed. These situations often involve NPCs, and the choices are usually to help the person (good morality), kill them (bad morality), or ignore them (neutral morality). In many situations, when Torque first encounters an NPC, the player will <b>hear</b> <b>the</b> <b>voice</b> <b>of</b> Torque's dead wife urging him to help them, and almost immediately afterwards will <b>hear</b> <b>the</b> <b>voice</b> <b>of</b> Blackmore, the game's antagonist, urging him to kill them. Over the course of the game, the decisions made concerning Torque's morality cumulate, and the player will get one of three endings based on Torque's final morality level. How Torque's actions affect his morality is usually indicated by the reaction of his wife, who will praise him if he commits a good act, and Blackmore, who will praise him if he does something evil. The player can get a rough idea of Torque's morality level by both his own physical appearance (he will begin to look less and less human the more evil acts he commits) and by looking at a family photograph which he carries with him at all times; the cleaner the photo, the purer his morality. If the photo is dirty, crumpled and covered in blood, his morality is moving towards evil. There is also a morality gauge in the menu, which shows exactly where Torque's morality is currently positioned.|$|E

25|$|A {{major part}} of the {{gameplay}} in The Suffering concerns Torque's morality. At numerous points during the game, the player will encounter situations where they have several choices as to how to proceed. These situations involve NPCs, and the choices are usually to help the person (good morality), kill them (bad morality), or ignore them (neutral morality). In many situations, when Torque first encounters an NPC, the player will <b>hear</b> <b>the</b> <b>voice</b> <b>of</b> Torque's dead wife urging him to help them, and almost immediately afterwards will <b>hear</b> <b>the</b> <b>voice</b> <b>of</b> a demon urging him to kill them. How Torque's actions affect his morality is usually indicated by the reaction of his wife, who will praise him if he commits a good act and chastise him if he does something evil. Often, when Torque saves an NPC, they fight alongside him for a time. However, not every choice presents the player with all three possibilities. For example, when Torque finds the controls to the electric chair, he can turn the chair on to torture an inmate strapped to it (bad morality), or simply ignore the controls (neutral morality). There is no good morality choice available here. Another example is when Torque finds a guard who has had his limbs removed and is slowly dying. He can kill the man to relieve him of his misery (good morality), or ignore him (neutral morality). Here, there is no bad morality choice. Over the course of the game, the decisions made concerning Torque's morality cumulate, and the player will get one of three endings based on Torque's final morality level. The player can get a rough idea of Torque's morality level by both Torque's own physical appearance (he will begin to look less and less human the more evil acts he commits) and by looking at a family photograph which he carries with him at all times; the cleaner the photo, the purer his morality.

500|$|During the revolution, {{there was}} an orgy of {{violence}} committed against the South Asian and Arab communities with thousands of women being raped by the Okello's followers, much looting and massacres of Arabs all over the island. The American diplomat Don Petterson described the killings of Arabs by the African majority {{as an act of}} genocide. Petterson wrote [...] "Genocide was not a term that in the vogue then, as it came to be later, but {{it is fair to say}} that in parts of Zanzibar, the killing of Arabs was genocide, pure and simple". Okello, an eccentric, power-crazed man with a taste for cruelty frequently went on the radio to urge his followers in thunderous Old Testament language to kill as many Arabs as possible, with the maximum of brutality. As a Pan-African nationalist who made his followers sing [...] "God Bless Africa" [...] whenever he marched through the streets, Okello appealed to the black majority, but at same time, as a militant Christian who claimed to <b>hear</b> <b>the</b> <b>voice</b> <b>of</b> God in his head, Okello's appeal on an island whose population was 95% Muslim was limited. It was only discontent with the Arabs that gave Okello any sort of mass support, and once the government was overthrown, most of the Muslim Africans gave their loyalty to the mainstream black politicians, and shunned the bloodthirsty Okello who presented himself as a messianic figure ordered by the voices in his head (which Okello said were messages from God) to liberate Africa for Jesus Christ. Okello claimed that Christ was an African and that Africa was God's special continent.|$|E
