40|$|Abstract. This {{paper is}} based on a speech {{delivered}} at the ECOOP' 98 Conference Banquet. It is not a literal transcription of my talk, since no recording was made, but has been reconstructed ex post facto based upon my speaker's notes and my memory. Ihave alsotaken the opportunity to add some headings and references. Distinguished Chairmen, Members of the Conference Committee, Representatives of the sponsoring organizations, distinguished Professors, conference participants, and friends: Good evening. It's customary <b>to</b> <b>start</b> this kind of talk with a joke, at least in part to give the audience a chance to become accustomed to my strange accent before <b>I</b> <b>start</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> anything interesting, but I'm going to skip that tonight because I think that we have already heard quite enough jokes for one evening. To set the record straight from the very rst, I should make it clear that I do not work for IBM, nor have Iworked for IBM in the past. Although I did once spend a very enjoyable year at IBM's Yorktown Heights Research Laboratory...|$|R

[...] "I've been looking for you all day to go on with what <b>I</b> was <b>starting</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> in the lift last night when we were interrupted. Do you mind if I talk to you like an aunt--or a sister, suppose we say? Really, the best plan would be for you to adopt me as an honorary sister. What do you think?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, I hain't but oncet. Oncet {{is enough}} for me. I run away, while I was in Venice, and went ashore--if {{you can call it}} ashore; it's all water, and you got to go round in boats: gondolas they call 'em there--and went to see the American counsul, and told him I was an American boy, and {{tried to get him to}} get me off. But he couldn't do anything. If you ship under the Swedish flag you're a Swede, and the whole United States couldn't get you off. If I'd 'a' shipped under the American flag I'd 'a' been an American, I don't care if I was born in Hottentot. That's what the counsul said. I never want to see that town ag'in. I used to hear songs about Venice--'Beautiful Venice, Bride of the Sea;' but I think it's a kind of a hole of a place. Well, what <b>I</b> <b>started</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> was that when I turn up in Boston, now,--and I most {{generally}} do,--I don't go to no sailor boardin'-house; I break for the Wayfarer's Lodge, every time. It's a temperance house, and they give you the worth o' your money." ...|$|E
6000|$|After another {{characteristic}} silence, Mose said slowly: [...] "Anyhow, I {{want you}} to understand that I'm much obliged for your good will; I'm not worth a cuss at putting things in a smooth way; I think I'm getting worse every day, but you've been my friend, and--and there's no discount on my words when I tell you you've made me feel ashamed of myself to-day. From this time on, I take no other man's judgment of a woman. You know my life--all there is that would interest you. I don't know how to talk to a woman--any kind of a woman--but no matter what I say, I don't mean to do anybody any harm. I'm getting a good deal like an Indian--I talk to make known what's on my mind. Since I was seventeen years of age I've let girls pretty well alone. The kind I meet alongside the trail don't interest me. When I was a boy I was glib enough, but I know a whole lot less now than I did then--that is about some things. What <b>I</b> <b>started</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> is this: I'm mighty much obliged for what you've done for me here--but I'm going to pull out to-night----" ...|$|E
6000|$|But what <b>I</b> <b>started</b> <b>to</b> <b>say,</b> was, that I {{have just}} read Part II of Indian Summer, {{and to my}} mind there isn't a waste line in it, or one that could be improved. I read it yesterday, ending with that opinion; and read it again to-day, ending with the same opinion emphasized. I haven't read Part I yet, because that number must have reached Hartford after we left; {{but we are going}} to send down town for a copy, and when it comes I am to read both parts aloud to the family. It is a {{beautiful}} story, and makes a body laugh all the time, and cry inside, and feel so old and so forlorn; and gives him gracious glimpses of his lost youth that fill him with a measureless regret, and build up in him a cloudy sense of his having been a prince, once, in some enchanted far-off land, and of being an exile now, and desolate--and Lord, no chance ever to get back there again! That is the thing that hurts. Well, you have done it with marvelous facility and you make all the motives and feelings perfectly clear without analyzing the guts out of them, the way George Eliot does. I can't stand George Eliot and Hawthorne and those people; I see what they are at a hundred years before they get to it and they just tire me to death.

40|$|In {{thinking}} about how I might usefully contribute to the conference I was reminded of a comment by Stephen Brookfield (1994) who described the sense of impostership he felt when speaking publicly to groups of educators: “The more I know about their work, the more I feel humbled by their abilities … If I know too much about {{who they are and}} what they have done as educators, <b>I</b> <b>start</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>to</b> myself ‘what on earth can I <b>say</b> <b>to</b> these people that has any chance of being taken seriously, or considered important, by them? (1994 : 207). Despite these reservations, I suspect that there are two things that bring us together and provide a point of mutual engagement: first, a shared feeling that things aren’t right; and second, a desire to change the way it is. In the case of the former, we could spend a considerable amount of time sharing stories of despair, frustration, outrage and even anger about the events, troubles and crises in our world and daily lives. Thankfully, each of us will also be able to share stories of success, joy, inspiration, and hope to nourish our sense of civic engagement. In the case of the latter, we all bring a different set of life trajectories, experiences and expertise to the task of changing our places and world. This conference provides a significant opportunity to both publicly and privately share these stories and in the process, articulate a more just, democratic and sustainable future for our children...|$|R

40|$|Thoughtrave is the {{immediate}} and most detailed archive of Lady Gaga’s emotional, intellectual, philosophical, and spiritual evolution, a reclaiming of her art (and humanity) from within {{the center of her}} celebrity during {{one of the most difficult}} transitions of her career: Summer 2013 ­–Fall 2014. I don’t like being used to make money. I feel sad when I am overworked and that I just become a money making machine and that my passion and my creativity take a backseat. That makes me unhappy. So, what did I do? <b>I</b> <b>started</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> no. Not doing that. I don’t want to do that. I’m not taking that picture. Not going to that event. Not standing by that because that’s not what I stand for. Thoughtrave marks perhaps the most important (and unconditional, unpublished, unencumbered) insights into the music industry, as well as into the personal battles that accompanied her transition from Stefani to Gaga. “It’s one of those rare moments in life when you ask a question of someone you’ve admired for many years and receive the most honest of answers leading both people into a relationship that was and remains one of the most important of my life,” says Baum, a professor, producer, composer, writer, editor, and activist for adjunct professors. As Baum explains to Stefani in one of the many interviews published here for the first time,It’s uncanny for me to look back at 2008 – 2011 — when I was intensely meditating on the problem “Why is there any being at all?” — to find evidence of your intervention here with me…to find you, back then…before I knew you. It was almost as if I was playing the Bruce Willis character in Twelve Monkeys, overshooting my mark in time/space, aiming for this particular conversation but speaking through Ereignis (life gives) to a moment I (and many others) call “headphones on. ”As George Elerick writes in his Introduction to the book, “In Hand-to-Hand Battle for the Users,”The book you hold in your hands easily falls into the category of a transgression. It’s as though we are breaking into somewhere we are not meant to be (like a rave) and are invited into the mind of one of today’s musical geniuses. Maybe we can even equivocate the experience to that of being a member of the paparazzi. Their whole mode of employment is based on breaking social codes and entering into the lives of everyday-people-turned-rock-stars. That’s what this book is, a disruptive invitation to break into the life and mind of Lady Gaga, the person, not just the persona...|$|E

40|$|In Mark Anthony's {{speech to}} the Romans, Shakespeare {{provides}} us with the paradigm of how many academic debates are developed. Mark Anthony, you will recall, repeatedly characterises Brutus as 'an honourable man', but then demonstrates quite the opposite.

Perhaps my excursus is sufficient <b>to</b> <b>say</b> that I do not intend to try to do to his article what Mark Anthony did to Brutus' reputation. The plan I propose is to break my article into two parts. In the first, I follow the outline of his article, identifying three types of point- those where he makes important criticisms of the position with which I am identified, those where he makes criticisms with which I disagree, with a sketch of the reasons for that disagreement, and those points where I think the issue is unclear.

40|$|I {{have been}} asked to talk about my {{experiences}} and opinions regarding site visits to doctoral programs. <b>I</b> want <b>to</b> <b>start</b> by <b>saying</b> that it is my view that, overall, the process works. Programs become stronger through the self-study and evaluation process. I know Committee on Accreditation (CoA) members occasionally get some flack about weak programs receiving accreditation, or strong programs being given a hard time, but with so much at stake, and such a large system, this is not surprising. In my view, the process is fair and reasonable overall. So later, when I focus on my concerns about the process, please understand these in the spirit of CoA’s own efforts at self-assessment and quality enhancement, much as CoA views most programs as strong, but always with room for improvement. Roles: History The main theme of what I will say is that defining, clarifying, and communicating the roles of all parties involved in the accreditation process is essential. These roles have evolved over time, and I worry that our expectations for the parties involved in accreditation may be approaching an unrealistic and undesirable state...|$|R
40|$|In this {{presentation}} in which I explore {{the idea of}} the academic as public intellectual, I want to set myself up as something of a provocateur and as your self-designated provocateur, the last thing I want to do is define “public intellectual ” or provide a definitive answer to the question, “what constitutes the public intellectual? ” I’d rather put out some points and raise some questions that further complicate the question and, hopefully, generates some discussion. So, I’ll make 6 quick points and provide a decidedly inconclusive conclusion. In my very brief remarks I’ll concentrate on academics and our relationship to the term “public intellectual, ” and use cultural studies as a loose framework for my remarks. The fact that I have chosen to explore this question of academics as intellectuals is being implies that I am assuming that we, well established or budding academics, {{have something to do with}} it; that we might be or ought to be, public intellectuals. So <b>I</b> want <b>to</b> <b>start</b> by <b>saying</b> we ought not to take such suppositions for granted. There are academics who hold that being a public intellectual is not part of their job description. Some of them are adamant about pursuing knowledge for knowledge’s sake and quite resistant to calls for them to play the role of public intellectual. In terms of our topic, in their extreme form, such academics are what we might cal...|$|R

5000|$|Hernández {{signed to}} play Canelita, the gay best friend of Cheba (Adriana Paz) in La Tirisia, a film written, {{produced}} {{and directed by}} Jorge Pérez Solano (2014). The plot, inspired by a popular term named tirisia (which means [...] "a perpetual sadness defined as 'the death of the spirit'"), {{is set in the}} Mixteca region of Mexico, and centers on two women (Paz and Gabriela Cartol) who were impregnated by Sylvestre (Gustavo Sánchez Parra). When Cheba's estranged husband returns to town, he finds her sunk into a deep depression since she had to give away a newborn (Sylvestre's child). Hernández was hesitant to take the role and the preparation was not easy for the director either, as he further explained to Cine Toma magazine: [...] "I was pleased that an actor like Noé Hernández, who suddenly was falling into the stereotype of the tough, strong, bully, bad Indian man, agreed to play this role. It took some work from both of us at first. For me, to accept him physically and for him to accept the character and built it, but I think it was an experiment that tourned out pretty well". Hernández said to El Universal: [...] "the director told me: you wanted an acting challenge and acting to stop doing the same violent roles, this is it, take it". The film was not exhibited on commercial movie theaters in Mexico since the distribution was expensive; instead, La Tirisia was screened at film festivals such as the Chicago International Film Festival, Thessaloniki International Film Festival and Toulouse Latin American Film Festival, and later had a month-and-a-half exhibition at the Mexican art house Cineteca Nacional.Hernández received critical praise for his performance. Jaime López Blanco of Sputnik magazine found him [...] "exquisite as 'Canelita', as it demonstrates his charm and his comedic talents, showing a totally opposite of his previous work, Miss Bala". At the Ariel Awards of 2015, Hernández received the Best Supporting Actor accolade for the role in the film. After winning the award the actor struggled to find new roles, considered retiring from acting and return to his hometown to work in the country fields, explaining to El Informador: [...] "Of course I'm delighted, who does not like to win awards? The awards are ego boosters, but what I really want is that they can be transformed into stronger work opportunities and complex characters, good roles, and lead roles. This year I only had five-day calls for little characters; the award has not really helped me a lot, let's hope it strengthens my career and leads to more opportunities". At the time, a project with director Nacho Ortíz fell through, and four other films co-starred by Hernández were not distributed in Mexico. [...] "Fortunately I'm not married, I have a son who I help moderately and every month I try to survive. Sometimes I say, 'I have income to pay rent for three months I can hold on a little', but then <b>I</b> <b>start</b> <b>to</b> worry and <b>say</b> 'time is running out and what can I do'. This situation has been quite difficult for me," [...] the actor told El Universal.|$|R
