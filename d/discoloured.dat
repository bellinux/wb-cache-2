This method is not essential for anyone too sick or in mortal danger – such a person may renounce verbally or mentally.|$|E
5|$|The tiny sac fungus Phyllachora banksiae {{subspecies}} westraliensis {{has been}} described from the leaves of B.speciosa, its sole host. This fungus manifests as round flat cream-coloured spots around 1–3mm in diameter on the upper leaf surface. The surrounding leaf tissue is sometimes <b>discoloured</b> orange. One or two shiny black fruit bodies measuring around 0.25–0.75 by 0.25–1mm appear in {{the centre of the}} spots.|$|E
5|$|Mary sits under a brocade canopy or {{cloth of}} honour, painted in brown hues which have since <b>discoloured</b> to dark green. The canopy hangs {{down to a}} wooden bench {{attached}} to the wall behind her. Mary's hair is loose and she wears an embroidered dress lined with fur. Around her neck is a light veil, and she {{is shown in the}} act of nursing. Her dress is a centrepiece of the panel, composed of a variety of blues overlaid with lead white and deep blue lapis lazuli highlights. The inner parts of her robe contain violet coloured fabrics, lined with greyish blues and purples.|$|E
5|$|Another {{unidentified}} parrot specimen, {{this one}} brown and housed in Cabinet du Roi, {{was described by}} the French naturalist Comte de Buffon in 1779 under his entry for the Mascarene parrot, in which he pointed out {{similarities and differences between}} the two. The English palaeontologist Julian Hume has suggested the possibility that this might have been a lesser vasa parrot, if not a <b>discoloured</b> old Mascarene grey parakeet (Psittacula bensoni). The specimen is now lost. English zoologist and author George Robert Gray assigned some eclectus parrot (Eclectus roratus) subspecies from the Moluccas to Mascarinus in his book A List of the Genera of Birds from the 1840s, but this idea was soon dismissed by other writers.|$|E
5|$|The Prince Consort's and Queen Victoria's {{rooms in}} the keep are named after their use during the royal visit of 1842, {{although}} their decoration today dates from the interwar period. The Dining Room, Drawing Room and Ante Room, which overlook the northern bastion, date from the 1730s, when the Duke of Dorset constructed them to form a private set of chambers. These rooms feature a range of pink and purple window glass, which tradition says was installed by the Earl of Liverpool to protect his wife's eyesight; recent analysis shows {{that some of the}} pink-tinted glass dates from the 1730s, and <b>discoloured</b> naturally over time, while other panes were intentionally purchased around 1800 in these hues, but probably as status symbols and not for any medical purpose.|$|E
5|$|Australia {{came out}} to bat halfway through the middle session on the second day, after England had ended on 363. Having dropped Brown, Barnes's injury left Australia with only one {{specialist}} opener, Morris. Johnson—a bowler—was deployed as Australia's makeshift second opener and fell for one. On the third morning, Barnes {{came out to}} bat upon Keith Miller's dismissal at 4/135, {{even though he had}} collapsed from the aftereffects of his injury while practising in the nets. Barnes had refused to stay in hospital and returned to the ground despite his ribs being <b>discoloured</b> from the bruising. Bradman was not aware of Barnes's collapse in the nets, but had told all rounder Sam Loxton to bat before Barnes to give the bruised opener more rest. Loxton told Barnes of Bradman's wishes, but when Miller was dismissed, Barnes defied team orders and walked out to bat, shaking Pollard's hand at the start of his innings.|$|E
5|$|The {{population}} of grey parrots described {{from the island}} of Réunion (referred to as Psittacula cf. bensoni by Hume) {{is thought to have}} been conspecific with that on Mauritius. Until subfossils of P. bensoni are found on Réunion, it cannot be confirmed whether the grey parrots of the two islands belonged to the same species. In the 1860s, French naturalists Charles Coquerel and Auguste Vinson suggested these could have been parrots of the genus Coracopsis, but fossils of neither that genus nor Psittacula have ever been found on Réunion. Whilst Coracopsis parrots are known to have been introduced to that island in the 1700s, a population did not become established. While no live or dead Mascarene grey parakeets are known with certainty to have been exported, Hume has suggested that a brown parrot specimen—once housed in Cabinet du Roi but now lost—may have been a <b>discoloured</b> old Mascarene grey parakeet, or perhaps a lesser vasa parrot (Coracopsis nigra). This specimen was described by Comte de Buffon in 1779.|$|E
5|$|On {{the third}} morning, {{the players were}} greeted by sunshine, and a large Saturday crowd had arrived from afar to watch proceedings; as a result, the gates were closed by 9:00 {{in the morning with}} the ground already filled. The large gallery again encroached on the playing arena, which was not fenced. In the first hour, Australia {{struggled}} against the new ball. Miller was beaten three times in one over by Bedser before Pollard trapped him for 31, after Australia had added only nine runs in the first hour. Four runs later, Bedser removed Morris for 51, leaving Australia 139/5. It had been a slow morning for Morris, who took 21 minutes to add to his overnight total and reached his half-century 45 minutes into the day's play, having added only four runs to his overnight score. At the same time, Barnes had come out to bat upon Miller's dismissal, despite having collapsed while practising in the nets due to the aftereffects of his rib injury. He batted after refusing to stay in hospital and returning to the ground in spite of his bruised and <b>discoloured</b> ribs. He made a painful single in 25 minutes of batting before the injury became too much and he had to be taken from the ground with the assistance of Bradman among others, before being sent to hospital to be put under observation. Barnes would eventually miss {{two and a half weeks}} of cricket. Tallon and Loxton added a further 33 before the former was caught behind from Edrich with the score at 172/6. Lindwall came into bat with Australia facing the prospect of the follow on. He received five consecutive bouncers from Edrich, one of which hit him in the hand and caused visible pain, evoking cheers from the home crowd. Loxton and Lindwall added a further 36 before the former was bowled by Pollard, leaving Australia 208/7, still five runs behind the follow-on mark. Johnston helped Lindwall advance Australia beyond the follow-on before Bedser removed both. Johnston was reprieved in his brief innings when he edged a delivery from Pollard in the direction of Edrich at first slip, but Evans dived across, trying to catch the ball in his right hand. The wicket-keeper could not hold on to the ball at full stretch, and the resulting deflection further to the right wrong-footed Edrich, who was moving the other way, and it went past him. From second slip, Crapp dived left behind Edrich but the ball landed a few centimetres beyond his fingers. However, in the next over Bedser, Johnston edged the ball in the same manner and Crapp caught the ball easily. Lindwall was the last man out for 23, while Toshack was unbeaten without scoring. Australia were thus bowled out for 221, giving England a lead of 142 runs. Bedser and Pollard were the most successful bowlers, taking 4/81 and 3/53 respectively.|$|E
25|$|However, in many locations, Maya ruins {{have been}} {{overgrown}} by the jungle, becoming dense enough to hide structures {{just a few}} meters away. To find unidentified ruins, researchers have turned to satellite imagery, in order {{to look at the}} visible and near-infrared spectra. Due to their limestone construction, the monuments affected the chemical makeup of the soil as they deteriorated; some moisture-loving plants are entirely absent, while others were killed off or <b>discoloured.</b>|$|E
25|$|Halakha (Jewish law) {{requires}} that the water used for ritual washing be naturally pure, unused, not contain other substances, and not be <b>discoloured.</b> The water also must be poured from a vessel as a human act, {{on the basis of}} references in the Bible to this practice, e.g. Elisha pouring water upon the hands of Elijah. Water should be poured on each hand at least twice. A clean dry substance should be used instead if water is unavailable.|$|E
25|$|Carlisle Cathedral was {{commenced}} in 1123 as a monastic church, possibly on {{the foundations}} of an earlier church, in the Norman architectural style with solid masonry, large round piers, round arches and smallish round headed windows. These features may still {{be seen in the}} south transept and the remaining two bays of the nave, which are now used as the Chapel of the Border Regiment. The stone is the local red sandstone, which has <b>discoloured</b> almost to black on parts of the exterior. The building has also suffered from subsidence which is evidenced by the piers, which lean at different angles.|$|E
25|$|Because {{the game}} uses a white ball {{instead of the}} red one used in {{first-class}} cricket, the ball can become <b>discoloured</b> and hard to see as the innings progresses, so the ICC has used various rules {{to help keep the}} ball playable. Most recently, ICC has made the use of two new balls (one from each end), the same strategy that was used in the 1992 and 1996 World Cups so that each ball is used for only 25 overs. Previously, in October 2007, the ICC sanctioned that after the 34th over, the ball would be replaced with a cleaned previously-used ball. Before October 2007 (except 1992 and 1996 World Cups), only one ball would be used during an innings of an ODI and it was up to the umpire to decide whether to change the ball.|$|E
25|$|Bog {{pondweed}} occurs both as {{terrestrial plants}} in seeps and wet moss, and as aquatic forms, {{and is very}} variable. Terrestrial forms in particular can {{be very difficult to}} identify. It is most likely to be confused with P. natans which it resembles in general habit, but can usually be distinguished by the presence of submerged leaves (these are reduced to strap-like phyllodes in P.natans) and the absence of a <b>discoloured</b> mark {{at the base of the}} floating leaves. The submerged leaves of P. alpinus can be similar, but these are sessile. Although a common plant, bog pondweed does not seem to hybridise readily with other pondweeds, though hybrids with P. natans (P. × gessnacensis G.Fisch.), P. gramineus, P. alpinus (P. × spathulatus Schrad. ex W.D.J.Koch & Ziz), P. berchtoldii (P. × rivularis Gillot)and P. pusillus have been recorded.|$|E
25|$|Following {{the model}} of the 1997 Pepsi Independence Cup that celebrated India's 50th anniversary of independence, the Wills Golden Jubilee Tournament sought to mark the 50 years of Pakistan's independence. During the final of the tournament, the Pakistan Cricket Board honoured all the living Test cricket captains of Pakistan by parading them in horse-drawn {{carriages}} and presenting them with gold medals. The only Pakistan captain not to attend was Imran Khan, who excused himself due to political commitments. Sri Lanka, the winners of the 1996 Cricket World Cup and the 1997 Asia Cup, were the leading favourites along with the dominant South African team. The matches were affected by night-time heavy dew and insects on the field. The white-coloured cricket ball frequently became soggy and <b>discoloured.</b> These conditions gave the team that batted first a clear advantage.|$|E
25|$|The bite is {{immediately}} followed by local pain of a burning character; the limb soon swells and becomes <b>discoloured,</b> and within {{one to three}} hours great prostration, accompanied by vomiting, and often diarrhoea, sets in. Cold, clammy perspiration is usual. The pulse becomes extremely feeble, and slight dyspnoea and restlessness may be seen. In severe cases, which occur mostly in children, the pulse may become imperceptible and the extremities cold; the patient may pass into coma. In from twelve to twenty-four hours these severe constitutional symptoms usually pass off; {{but in the meantime}} the swelling and discoloration have spread enormously. The limb becomes phlegmonous, and occasionally suppurates. Within a few days recovery usually occurs somewhat suddenly, but death may result from the severe depression or from the secondary effects of suppuration. That cases of death, in adults as well as in children, are not infrequent {{in some parts of the}} Continent is mentioned in the last chapter of this Introduction.|$|E
500|$|The {{manuscript}} measures [...] {{and most}} of the folios were originally gathered into quires of eight leaves each. In modern times it was rebound into sets of six leaves each. The material is thin, fine, and very beautiful vellum, often <b>discoloured</b> at the edges, which have been damaged by age and more so through the ignorance or carelessness of the modern binder, who has not always spared the text, especially at the upper inner margin.|$|E
500|$|The colours, {{which now}} appear so fresh and spring-like with pale pink, apple green, vivid yellow and sky blue against a {{background}} of warm pearly grey, were so <b>discoloured</b> by candle smoke as to make the pictures seem almost monochrome. The restoration has removed the filter of grime to reveal the colours again. However, the restoration was met with both praise and criticism. Critics assert that much original work [...] by Michelangelo – in particular pentimenti, highlights and shadows, and other detailing painted a secco – was lost in the removal of various accretions.|$|E
500|$|When {{the party}} was finally free of the glacier and on the level surface of the Barrier, Evans began to display the first {{symptoms}} of scurvy. By early February he was in great pain, his joints were swollen and <b>discoloured,</b> and he was passing blood. Through the efforts of Crean and Lashly the group struggled towards One Ton Depot, which they reached on 11 February. At this point Evans collapsed; Crean thought he had died and, according to Evans's account, [...] "his hot tears fell on my face".|$|E
500|$|As {{a fast-growing}} plant, {{diseases}} are not generally {{a problem with}} radishes, but some insect pests can be a nuisance. The larvae of flea beetles (Delia radicum) live in the soil, but the adult beetles cause damage to the crop, biting small [...] "shot holes" [...] in the leaves, especially of seedlings. The swede midge (Contarinia nasturtii) attacks the foliage and growing tip of the plant and causes distortion, multiple (or no) growing tips, and swollen or crinkled leaves and stems. The larvae of the cabbage root fly sometimes attack the roots. The foliage droops and becomes <b>discoloured,</b> and small, white maggots tunnel through the root, making it unattractive or inedible.|$|E
500|$|During {{nine years}} of {{pollution}} control work reviewed by the North West Water Authority, the biggest improvement {{had been in the}} Bolton District, where effluent from five dilapidated sewage plants and two paper mills were now being treated at the Ringley Fold Works [...] there has been little reduction in pollution from the river Roch. [...] At Bacup the headwater of the Irwell is <b>discoloured</b> by ochre deposits from a disused mine but work is being done to stop the ochre seepage. [...] Fish do exist in the stretch between Rossendale and Bury and fish are to be introduced in stretches between Radcliffe and Manchester. However, it is feared that it will be many years before fish will be able to breed freely in the river.|$|E
500|$|Trees {{that are}} {{infected}} by A.luteobubalina show characteristic symptoms both {{above and below}} ground. Above the ground, {{the base of the}} tree develops inverted V-shaped lesions, and the infected wood undergoes white rot, a fungal wood decay process where the cellulose and lignin of the sapwood are both broken down, leaving the wood stringy. The bark of the stem dies and becomes <b>discoloured</b> up to [...] above the ground. Clusters of fruit bodies appear {{at the base of the}} tree in autumn. Crowns may show gradual deterioration, or tree death may occur suddenly. Below the ground, characteristic symptoms of infections include rotting the ends of tree roots, white-rotted sapwood, and the presence of fan-shaped areas of white mycelium below dead or infected bark.|$|E
500|$|The {{last major}} outcry {{against the use}} of radical {{conservation}} techniques at the National Gallery was sixty-six years ago in the immediate post-war years, following a restoration campaign by Chief Restorer Helmut Ruhemann while the paintings were in Manod Quarry. When the cleaned pictures were exhibited to the public in 1946 there followed a furore with parallels to that of a century earlier. The principal criticism was that the extensive removal of varnish, which was used in the 19th century to protect the surface of paintings but which darkened and <b>discoloured</b> them with time, may have resulted in the loss of [...] "harmonising" [...] glazes added to the paintings by the artists themselves. The opposition to Ruhemann's techniques was led by Ernst Gombrich, a professor at the Warburg Institute who in later correspondence with a restorer described being treated with [...] "offensive superciliousness" [...] by the National Gallery. A 1947 commission concluded that no damage had been done in the recent cleanings.|$|E
500|$|The {{portrait}} is {{not particularly}} well preserved. There are yellowish layers of glaze over the face, probably later additions. The varnishes have degraded and lost their original colours. The panel has undergone a number of detrimental retouchings. In some instances, these have altered the sitter's appearance, most especially the removal of strands of fair hair below the chaperon. It has sustained structural damage, especially to the marble on the reverse. The National Gallery repaired some [...] "slight injuries" [...] when it came into their possession in 1857. Campbell notes a number of efforts by later restorers were imperfect and [...] "rather disfiguring", including touchings to the man's nostrils and eyelashes, and {{the tip of his}} nose. There is a yellowish glaze over the eyes that seems to be either damage or overpaint. The panel is <b>discoloured</b> overall and suffers from aged and degenerated varnishes that make the original pigments hard to discern.|$|E
500|$|The {{panel is}} in poor condition, with {{substantial}} damage to its frame and surface, despite {{at least four}} restorations. The earliest recorded restoration was in 1893, the year it was acquired by the Museum of Fine Arts, {{but there are no}} surviving records of the treatment. In the early 1930s, the museum's curator of paintings, Philip Henry, described the painting as an original van der Weyden, but gave the opinion that its poor condition was hindering wider acceptance of the attribution. On this basis, it was sent to Germany in 1932 to undergo conservation. The effort was led by the restorer Helmut Ruhemann, who described the panel as [...] "structurally sound", and removed layers of <b>discoloured</b> varnish and [...] "crude overpainting", while filling in some areas of paint loss. Ruhemann believed he had found evidence of at least two major 19th-century restorations, one of which was probably that carried out in Boston in 1893. Ruhemann's cleaning and restoration was widely praised, and contributed to the acceptance of the panel as the original by van der Weyden.|$|E
500|$|The nesting hollows {{are lined}} with sticks, wood chips and {{branches}} with leaves. The eggs of cockatoos are oval and initially white, as their location makes camouflage unnecessary. However, they do become <b>discoloured</b> {{over the course of}} incubation. They range in size from [...] in the palm and red-tailed black cockatoos, to [...] in the cockatiel. Clutch size varies within the family, with the palm cockatoo and some other larger cockatoos laying only a single egg and the smaller species laying anywhere between two and eight eggs. Food supply also plays a role in clutch size. Some species can lay a second clutch if the first fails. Around 20% of eggs laid are infertile. The cockatoos' incubation and brooding responsibilities may either be undertaken by the female alone {{in the case of the}} black cockatoos or shared amongst the sexes as happens in the other species. In the case of the black cockatoos, the female is provisioned by the male several times a day. The young of all species are born covered in yellowish down, bar the palm cockatoo, whose young are born naked. Cockatoo incubation times are dependent on species size, with the smaller cockatiels having a period of around 20days and the larger Carnaby's black cockatoo incubating its eggs for up to 29days.|$|E

2500|$|The {{panels are}} in good {{condition}} and have not suffered significant damage. They were cleaned in 1981 when layers of <b>discoloured</b> and ruined varnishes were removed. Technical examination shows that Rogier {{made a number of}} changes to the final poses.|$|E
2500|$|Conservation of {{paintings}} can vary {{due to the}} wide range of types of paints and can include cleaning, removal and replacement of degraded varnish to the restoration of paint losses. The Tate Museum described that [...] "Cleaning is a particularly delicate and demanding part of conserving and restoring paintings. Layers of dirt, <b>discoloured</b> varnish and old restorations that may be disfiguring or obscuring parts of the composition are painstakingly removed." ...|$|E
2500|$|During {{the heat}} of the battle, Rodney asked Dashwood to make him a glass of lemonade, the {{ingredients}} for which were at hand. Not having anything to stir it with but a knife that was already <b>discoloured</b> by the cutting of the lemon, George Rodney said, on Dashwood presenting it to him: [...] "Child, that may do for a midshipman, but not for an admiral. Take it yourself and send my servant to me." ...|$|E
2500|$|John Dalton, {{was born}} in Cumberland in 1766, a {{promising}} young scientist he moved to Manchester in 1793. He hypothesised the idea of [...] "colour blindness", a theory which was alien to all as {{it had not been}} formally talked about before. Dalton hypothesised the idea from his own experience, as he suffered from <b>discoloured</b> eyesight himself. Dalton would go on to propose the Dalton atomic theory in which he hypothesised that elements were made of small particles called atoms.|$|E
2500|$|In July 2016 {{the band}} {{announced}} that Shannon was [...] "feeling strong again after her treatment" [...] {{and that they}} would start touring again in September. Shannon had used the pause from tour life to collaborate with Peter Garrett (Midnight Oil) on his solo debut A New Version Of Now. Hayley Mary supported Birds of Tokyo on <b>Discoloured,</b> a track from their album Brace. Hayley Mary and Michael Dow contributed a track called Flawless to the original music of the sci-fi thriller Butterflies.|$|E

The balls used in One Day Internationals are white and become <b>discoloured</b> very easily, especially on dusty or abrasive pitches, and thus the ball change is deemed necessary {{to ensure that the}} ball is easily visible.|$|E
2500|$|On 16 July 2013, {{children}} aged between four and twelve {{years at the}} Dharmashati Gandaman primary school complained that their lunch, served {{as a part of}} the Midday Meal Scheme, tasted odd. Children who questioned the food were rebuked by the headmistress. Earlier, headmistress Meena Kumari had been informed by the school's cook that the new cooking oil was <b>discoloured</b> and smelled odd. Kumari replied that the oil was purchased at a local grocery store and safe to use. The cook, who was also hospitalized by the poisoning, later told reporters that it looked like there was [...] "an accumulation of residual waste at the bottom [...] ". The meal cooked at the school that day consisted of soya beans, rice and potato curry.|$|E

According to art historian Gisela Jahn, [...] "in no other style of ceramics did the Japanese go to such extremes in attempting to appeal to Western tastes, and nowhere else were the detrimental effects of mass production more clearly evident". In an effort to produce inexpensive, popular items, Satsuma ware designs became [...] "over-crowded", [...] "garish", and [...] "glitzy". There was never a domestic demand for these pieces, which were generally viewed as the [...] "betrayal of Japanese tradition". Serious foreign collectors also {{turned their backs on}} export works as [...] "crude, chalky pâte, covered with coarsely fissured glaze, in which more often than otherwise an excess of feldspar has produced <b>discoloured</b> deposits that suggest the reverse of technical skill." ...|$|E
