50|$|Empirical studies (see democide) {{have found}} that democracies, {{including}} the United States, have killed much fewer civilians than dictatorships.

40|$|Decades of {{conflict}} in eastern Myanmar have resulted in high prevalence of <b>human</b> <b>rights</b> <b>violations</b> and poor health outcomes. While recent ceasefire agreements have reduced conflict in this area, it is unknown whether this has resulted in concomitant reductions in <b>human</b> <b>rights</b> <b>violations.</b> We conducted a two-stage cluster survey of 686 households in eastern Myanmar to assess health status, access to healthcare, food security, exposure to <b>human</b> <b>rights</b> <b>violations</b> and identification of alleged perpetrators over the 12 months prior to January 2012, a period of near-absence {{of conflict}} in this region. Household hunger (FANTA- 2 scale) was moderate/high in 91 (13. 2 %) households, while the proportion of households reporting food shortages in each month of 2011 ranged from 19. 9 % in December to 47. 0 % in September, with food insecurity peaking {{just prior to the}} harvest. Diarrhea prevalence in children was 14. 2 % and in everyone it was 5. 8 %. Forced labor was the most common <b>human</b> <b>rights</b> <b>violation</b> (185 households, 24. 9 %), and 210 households (30. 6 %) reported experiencing one or more <b>human</b> <b>rights</b> <b>violations</b> in 2011. Multiple logistic regression analysis identified associations between <b>human</b> <b>rights</b> <b>violations</b> and poor health outcomes. <b>Human</b> <b>rights</b> <b>violations</b> and their health consequences persist despite reduced intensity {{of conflict in}} eastern Myanmar. Ceasefire agreements should include language that protects <b>human</b> <b>rights,</b> and reconciliation efforts should address the health consequences of decades of <b>human</b> <b>rights</b> <b>violations...</b>|$|R

The author decided to focus on the victims of serious violations because the research revealed that while the rights {{of victims of}} <b>human</b> <b>rights</b> <b>violations</b> are in general relatively settled in theory as well in practice of international law, the rights of the victims of serious violations is an area, which raises several doctrinal questions, encountered rapid development in recent years and continues to develop. Analysis of the rights of the victims of serious violations necessary must be based {{on the rights of the}} victims of <b>human</b> <b>rights</b> <b>violations</b> in general, which serves as a baseline for the analysis of the rights of the victims of serious violations.
