25|$|The {{warnings}} against use of <b>danazol</b> were progressively strengthened in the 1980s. In 1991 the FDA {{required a}} black box warning {{that use of}} <b>danazol</b> in pregnancy is contraindicated because exposure to <b>danazol</b> in utero may result in androgenic effects on the female fetus causing external genitalia masculinization. The black box warning recommends a sensitive hCG-beta-subunit pregnancy test immediately prior to starting <b>danazol</b> therapy and use of a nonhormonal method of contraception during therapy.|$|E
25|$|Fetal masculinization {{of female}} {{external}} genitalia has resulted from doses of <b>danazol</b> {{as low as}} 200mg/day, whereas 800mg/day is the usual initial dose when <b>danazol</b> is used to treat severe endometriosis.|$|E
25|$|The {{first case}} report of fetal masculinization of the {{external}} genitalia of a female infant born to a mother inadvertently treated in pregnancy with <b>danazol</b> was published in 1981.|$|E
25|$|The only sex steroid {{currently}} {{utilized in}} women {{that can cause}} virilization of female fetuses when administered in usually administered doses is the androgen <b>danazol,</b> a derivative of ethisterone (17α-ethinyl-testosterone).|$|E
25|$|It {{is likely}} that the true rate of {{occurrence}} is much less than 40%, as many cases with a normal outcome would not be reported. No genital anomalies were reported where <b>danazol</b> therapy was discontinued before the 8th week of pregnancy.|$|E
25|$|Future {{attacks of}} {{hereditary}} angioedema {{can be prevented}} {{by the use of}} androgens such as <b>danazol,</b> oxandrolone or methyltestosterone. These agents increase the level of aminopeptidase P, an enzyme that inactivates kinins; kinins (especially bradykinin) are responsible for the manifestations of angioedema.|$|E
25|$|On June 21, 1976, the FDA {{approved}} the androgen <b>danazol</b> (Danocrine), a derivative of ethisterone (17α-ethinyl-testosterone), {{for treatment of}} endometriosis, with a warning that its use in pregnancy is contraindicated {{because of the risk}} of masculinization of external genitalia of female fetuses.|$|E
25|$|<b>Danazol</b> is an {{effective}} treatment to shrink fibroids and control symptoms. Its use is limited by unpleasant side effects. Mechanism of action {{is thought to be}} antiestrogenic effects. Recent experience indicates that safety and side effect profile can be improved by more cautious dosing.|$|E
25|$|Between 1975 and 1990, Danocrines manufacturer, Winthrop Laboratories, {{received}} reports worldwide of 129 {{pregnant women}} exposed to <b>danazol,</b> with 94 completed pregnancies {{and the birth}} of 57 female infants — 23 (40%) of whom were virilized with a pattern of clitoromegaly, fused labia and urogenital sinus formation, with genital reconstructive surgery usually, but not always, required in childhood.|$|E
25|$|NET was {{previously}} available alone in 5mg tablets under {{the brand name}} Norlutin in the U.S., but this formulation has since been discontinued in this country. However, NETA remains available alone in 5mg tablets under the brand names Aygestin and Norlutate in the U.S. It {{is one of the}} only non-contraceptive progestogen-only drug formulations that remains available in the U.S. The others include progesterone, medroxyprogesterone acetate, megestrol acetate, and hydroxyprogesterone caproate, as well as the atypical agent <b>danazol.</b>|$|E

50|$|It is {{noteworthy}} that 2-hydroxymethylethisterone, a major metabolite of <b>danazol,</b> circulates at concentrations 5-10 times greater than those of <b>danazol</b> and is twice as potent as <b>danazol</b> in displacing testosterone from SHBG. As such, most of the occupation of SHBG by <b>danazol</b> may actually be due to this metabolite.|$|E
50|$|The {{warnings}} against use of <b>danazol</b> were progressively strengthened in the 1980s. In 1991 the FDA {{required a}} black box warning {{that use of}} <b>danazol</b> in pregnancy is contraindicated because exposure to <b>danazol</b> in utero may result in androgenic effects on the female fetus causing external genitalia masculinization. The black box warning recommends a sensitive hCG-beta-subunit pregnancy test immediately prior to starting <b>danazol</b> therapy and use of a nonhormonal method of contraception during therapy.|$|E
50|$|As such, <b>danazol</b> is {{described}} as a possessing high affinity for the AR, moderate affinity for the PR and GR, and poor affinity for the ER. As an androgen, <b>danazol</b> {{is described}} as weak, being about 200-fold less potent than testosterone in bioassays. The drug can act as both an agonist and antagonist of the PR depending on the bioassay, indicating that it could be regarded as a selective progesterone receptor modulator. Although the affinity and efficacy of <b>danazol</b> itself at the PR are relatively low, ethisterone, one of the major metabolites of <b>danazol,</b> {{is described as}} a weak progestogen (and has been employed clinically as a progestogenic contraceptive), and this presumably balances the in vivo progestogenic activity of <b>danazol.</b> The activity of <b>danazol</b> at the ER is considered to be minimal, although at very high concentrations the drug can act significantly as an ER agonist. <b>Danazol</b> is considered to act significantly as an agonist of the GR, and thus, as a glucocorticoid. In accordance, it can suppress the immune system.|$|E
50|$|<b>Danazol</b> is {{contraindicated}} {{during pregnancy}} {{because it has}} the potential to virilize female fetuses. Women taking <b>danazol</b> should practice effective contraception to prevent pregnancy if sexually active.|$|E
50|$|Fetal masculinization {{of female}} {{external}} genitalia has resulted from doses of <b>danazol</b> {{as low as}} 200 mg/day, whereas 800 mg/day is the usual initial dose when <b>danazol</b> is used to treat severe endometriosis.|$|E
50|$|Androgenic {{side effects}} are of concern, as some women taking <b>danazol</b> may {{experience}} unwanted hair growth (hirsutism), acne, irreversible deepening of the voice, or adverse blood lipid profiles. In addition, breast atrophy and decreased breast size may occur. The drug may also cause hot flashes, elevation of liver enzymes, and mood changes. Some patients who use <b>danazol</b> experience weight gain and fluid retention. Due to its side effects, <b>danazol</b> is seldom prescribed continuously beyond six months.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Danazol</b> {{is known}} to bind to two steroid hormone carrier proteins: sex hormone-binding {{globulin}} (SHBG), which binds androgens and estrogens; and transcortin (corticosteroid-binding globulin), which binds progesterone and cortisol. Binding of <b>danazol</b> to SHBG {{is considered to be}} more important clinically. By occupying SHBG and transcortin, <b>danazol</b> increases the ratio of free to plasma protein-bound testosterone, estradiol, progesterone, and cortisol. The following table shows the difference in testosterone levels in untreated premenopausal women and women treated with danazol: ...|$|E
50|$|<b>Danazol</b> is used {{primarily}} {{in the treatment of}} endometriosis. It has also been used - mostly off-label - for other indications, namely in the management of menorrhagia, fibrocystic breast disease, immune thrombocytopenic purpura, premenstrual syndrome, breast pain, and hereditary angioedema. Although not currently a standard treatment for menorrhagia, <b>danazol</b> demonstrated significant relief in young women with menorrhagia in a study, and, {{because of a lack of}} a significant adverse effects, it was proposed as an alternative treatment. Low-dose <b>danazol</b> has also been investigated in the treatment of diabetic macular edema in a phase III clinical trial. A dosage of 800 mg/day <b>danazol</b> was found to increase telomere length in patients with telomere diseases in a phase I/II clinical trial.|$|E
50|$|As can be seen, the {{percentage}} of free testosterone is tripled in women being treated with <b>danazol.</b> The ability of <b>danazol</b> to increase free testosterone levels suggests that a portion of its weak androgenic effects are mediated indirectly by facilitating the activity of testosterone and dihydrotestosterone through the displacement of them from SHBG. In addition to binding to and occupying SHBG however, <b>danazol</b> also decreases the hepatic production of SHBG and therefore SHBG levels, and so downregulation of SHBG may be involved as well. <b>Danazol</b> likely decreases hepatic production of SHBG by reducing estrogenic and increasing androgenic activity in the liver (as androgens and estrogens increase and decrease, respectively, hepatic SHBG synthesis). In accordance {{with the notion that}} suppression of SHBG is involved in the androgenic effects of <b>danazol,</b> the drug has synergistic rather than additive androgenic effects in combination with testosterone in bioassays (which is most likely secondary to the increased free testosterone levels).|$|E
50|$|<b>Danazol</b> was {{described}} as a luteolytic agent.|$|E
50|$|The {{synthetic}} androgenic steroid <b>danazol</b> {{also has}} an isoxazole ring.|$|E
5000|$|Gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) agonists: These {{drugs are}} thought to work by {{decreasing}} hormone levels. A 2010 Cochrane review found that GnRH agonists were more effective for pain relief in endometriosis than no treatment or placebo, but were no more effective than <b>danazol</b> or intrauterine progestagen, and had more side effects than <b>danazol.</b>|$|E
