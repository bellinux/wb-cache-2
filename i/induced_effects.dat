25|$|A {{study by}} Global Insights {{research}} found that modern retailers such as Walmart create jobs directly, indirectly and by <b>induced</b> <b>effects.</b> In Dallas-Fort Worth {{area of the}} United States, {{with a population of}} about 2 million people, Global Insights found that Walmart alone had helped create about 6,300 new net jobs with an average salary of over $21,000 each. For India's urban population of over 400 million, an average salary of less than $2,100 per year, this scales to over 12 million new jobs. Other multi-brand retailers, such as Mitsukoshi of Japan, employ a much higher number of sales support employee per store, than Walmart, to suit local consumer culture. The Global Insights study also found that the modern retail such as Walmart were a key contributor in creating new net jobs and maintaining low consumer price inflation rates from 1985 to 2005.|$|E

The main results are as follows. First of all, the investment attraction, the start-up of new firms, the creation of added value, the sales and the job creation in Semangeum area would increase, and the regulatory burden would decrease. Also, the investment attraction and productivity improvement of firms in Saemangeum area were expected to generate production <b>induced</b> <b>effect,</b> added value <b>induced</b> <b>effect,</b> employment and labor <b>induced</b> <b>effect</b> across the country.

Specifically, we employ a static I-O framework, and analyze three topics in its application: the inter-industry linkage <b>effect,</b> the production <b>inducing</b> <b>effect,</b> and the supply shortage effect. We pay particular attention to the ICT manufacturing sector and ICT service-providing sector by taking the sectors as exogenous and investigating their economic impacts, respectively. The results suggest that (1) the ICT manufacturing sector has a high backward linkage effect, an intermediate forward linkage effect, a relatively low production <b>inducing</b> <b>effect,</b> and a low supply shortage effect, it suggests that ICT manufacturing sector has a powerful capacity for pulling the production activities of the whole economy. (2) The inter-industry linkage effect and supply shortage effect of ICT service-providing is low, but the production <b>inducing</b> <b>effect</b> of ICT service-providing is high, which suggests that the impact of an increase in ICT service-providing investment on the total output of all other sectors is large...|$|R
