50|$|Geriatric psychiatry, {{also known}} as <b>geropsychiatry,</b> {{psychogeriatrics}} or psychiatry of old age, is a subspecialty of psychiatry dealing with the study, prevention, and treatment of mental disorders in humans with old age. After a 4-year residency in psychiatry, a psychiatrist can complete a one-year fellowship in geriatric psychiatry. As the population ages, particularly in developing countries, this field is becoming more needed. The diagnosis, treatment and management of dementia and depression are two areas of this field.|$|E
50|$|Piedmont Geriatric Hospital is a {{geriatric}} hospital {{located in the}} state of Virginia. It is Virginia's only state facility solely dedicated to the evaluation and treatment of persons over the age of 65 http://www.oig.state.va.us/Facility_Reports/Piedmont%20Geriatric%20Hospital%20Snapshot%20Inspection%20Feb%202003.htm. The 123-bed {{geriatric hospital}} is located in Burkeville on the 300 acre site of the former Piedmont Sanatorium. Founded in 1967, the facility employs 320 staff members and is a training site for major universities, colleges, and vocational schools in <b>geropsychiatry</b> and other clinical specialties.|$|E
40|$|The {{psychiatric}} home {{visit is}} an effective inter-vention for elderly patients who otherwise would not re-ceive mental health services. Home visits also have potential to be useful for training. Here, the current practice of home visits in <b>geropsychiatry</b> fellowship programs is examined. Design and Methods: The directors of 55 current gero-psychiatry fellowships in the United States were sent a 13 -item questionnaire {{regarding the use of}} home visits for training. Results: Of the 51 % of programs responding, 57 % provide a formal home-visit experience for fellows. Respondents commented favorably regarding the educa-tional value of home visits, but raised concerns about funding this time-intensive clinical activity. Implications: Training programs in <b>geropsychiatry</b> can benefit from the inclusion of home-visit programs. A description of a recently established home-visit program illustrates the feasibility of such an enterprise when developed as a collaboration between a teaching hospital and an appropriate commu-nity agency. This arrangement provides training for fel-lows and allows the agency to provide broad mental health services...|$|E

We use brief electronic records to capture key information, combining coded and free-text formats. Data entry is fast and simple, readily accomplished by physicians during clinical rounds (for inpatients), or by clerk (from outpatient encounter forms). Sufficient clinical data is stored to be useful in patient management, and to support administrative and clinical research functions...|$|E

40|$|A brief {{review of}} {{literature}} on Late Paraphrenia is offered. An analysis was made on 15 cases of late paraphrenia with reference to its frequency, sex distribution, hallucinations, delusions and sensory impairment. Late Paraphrenia formed 4 % of all <b>Geropsychiatry</b> cases. All the cases hac. hallucinations (100 %) while 14 had delusions (93 %). An associated auditory and/or visual defect was noticed in 13 of the cases (07 %) Follow up fi. iding.; revealed a sustained remission for 4 to 5 years with drugs in 12 patients (75 %) and one patient died from cerebral stroke. Described by Kraepelin as the darkest chapter in Psychological Medicine, Psychiatry of Old age has now emerged as a sub speciality offering an improved outlook for the elderly.

40|$|ObjectiveaaThis {{study was}} {{conducted}} to examine the following: whether patients with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) show impairments in instrumental activities of daily living (IADL) as compared to controls; to identify the functional sub-domains of instrumental activities of daily living (IADL) that are affected in MCI and, finally, to identify the Seoul-Instrumental Activities of Daily Living (S-IADL) scale cut-off score that best differentiated between MCI and controls. MethodsaaThis study was carried out at the <b>geropsychiatry</b> clinic, university hospital. The study participants included 66 patients with MCI and 61 normal elderly. The S-IADL and Seoul-Activities of Daily Living (S-ADL) scales were administered to the main caregivers of all participants in order to assess everyday functioning. ResultsaaThe total S-IADL score was significantly higher in the patients with MCI [mean (SD) score= 4. 47 (2. 06) ] than in the controls [mean (SD) score= 1. 44 (1. 65) ] (p< 0. 001). The patients with MCI performed significantly worse on IADLs, such as the ability to use the telephone, prepare meals, take medication, manage belongings, keep appointments, talk about recent events, and perform leisure activities/hobbies (p< 0. 05). The S-IADL scal...|$|E

Differences in physiology, need of concomitant medications, and liability for cognitive deficits in this population, make the choice of anticonvulsant drugs especially important. This paper reviews topiramate (TPM), a treatment for many types of seizures, with the above risks in mind. In particular, we discuss efficacy and pharmacokinetics with emphasis on the older patient, and adverse events in both the younger and older adult. With most studies of TPM-induced cognitive deficits having been performed in younger adults and volunteers, we discuss the implications for the older adult. Even in studies of younger individuals, up to 50 % discontinue TPM because of intolerable cognitive deficits. Most studies find specific declines in working memory and verbal fluency. In conclusion, we give recommendations for use of this antiepileptic drug in this population. Keywords: topiramate, elderly, epilepsy, treatment, cognition, pharmacokinetic...|$|E

We aimed to determine the effectiveness and safety of mirtazapine in treatment of agitated patients with Alzheimer&rsquo;s disease (AD). The consecutive patients with AD who have significant agitation were assigned to a 12 -week open-label, prospective study. Patients received mirtazapine 15 &ndash; 30 mg/day. The changes in Cohen-Mansfi eld Agitation Inventory-Short form (CMAI-SF) scores were primary outcome measurement. The change in Clinical Global Impression-Severity scale (CGI-S) scores and tolerability-safety profile were the secondary efficacy variables. Thirteen of 16 (81. 25 %) patients completed the study. There was a significant reduction in CMAI-SF and CGI-S between the pre- and post-treatment with mirtzapaine (p &lt; 0. 001). The mean baseline score was 26. 54 (&plusmn; 5. 4) and mean reduction was 10. 6 (&plusmn; 7. 5) in CMAI-SF. There was no significant side effect and cognitive deterioration. The results of this open-label pilot study suggest that mirtazapine may be an effective choice for treatment of agitated patients with AD.

40|$|This {{paper will}} discuss the data {{collected}} about patients discharged from a <b>geropsychiatry</b> unit and their post-discharge survival rates. First, we will show methods {{to analyze the data}} arising from studies where the response variable is the length of time taken to reach a certain end-point, often death. The Kaplan–Meier methods, log rank test and Cox's proportional hazards model will be demonstrated. We will attempt to identify a small number of key risk factors with all possible two-factor interactions associated with the survival of patients after discharge and referral to hospice. We will also estimate the survival function for each individual with given significant factors. This will be accomplished by analyzing censored survival data using Cox’s proportional hazards model and through implementation of the PROC PHREG procedure in SAS. Also, we will attempt to identify the significant risk factors among the group that was not referred to hospice. Schoenfeld residuals and the cumulative residuals from PROC PHREG will be used to investigate the model specification error of covariates and validate the proportional hazard function. As is the case in clinical trials, potential outlier individuals who ‘died far too early ’ or ‘lived far too long ’ will be identified and compared to what the fitted model predicts. Cox regression residuals such as Martingale and Deviance residuals will be used to identify the outlier patients...|$|E
