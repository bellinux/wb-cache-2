40|$|Acting in a {{boundary}} spanning role within their organisations, the <b>key</b> account <b>manager</b> in representing their customers’ needs internally {{is required to}} manage {{a wide range of}} complex internal relationships. This can often lead to incidents of conflict between the <b>key</b> account <b>manager</b> and other individuals or groups of individuals within the organisation in non-sales functions. Using the Critical Incident Technique (CIT), (Flanagan, 1954) together with an interpretive framework for data coding (Spiggle, 1994), this research investigates conflict and the <b>key</b> account <b>manager’s</b> internal selling role. This research also explores how the <b>key</b> account <b>manager</b> perceives intraorganisational, interpersonal conflicts and investigates the complex behavioural sequences adopted to manage them. In doing so this research addresses some of the shortcomings of the traditional view of the nature of organisational conflict and how it is managed while extending our understanding of the <b>key</b> account <b>manager’s</b> internal selling role. In contrast to the majority of research into personal selling, this research takes an interpretive approach through the analysis of transcripts from a series of CIT interviews with <b>key</b> account <b>managers</b> in the field. Twenty-nine <b>key</b> account <b>managers</b> from seven participating FMCG, Blue Chip organisations in the U. K. and U. S. participated in the research. From the CIT interviews conducted, 112 critical incidents were described with both positive and negative outcomes. This research provides further insight into the complexity of conflict, suggesting conflict is inherent within the key account management internal selling role, that incidents of conflict do not occur in isolation, that these conflict episodes are complex, having multiple components and that a combination of behaviours can be used in their management. In addressing these issues in the key account management context, this research further develops our knowledge of personal selling and the <b>key</b> account <b>manager’s</b> internal selling role by providing an analysis of the recollections of how conflict is perceived and managed by the <b>key</b> account <b>managers</b> involved.

Fob <b>Key</b> <b>Manager</b> will enable applicants to submit their request for Fob Key by logging into the FKM system and submitting an online form. The request-approval will be processed across the three departments ??? department office, dean???s office and facilities office using digital signatures. Each office staff is {{able to see the}} requests by logging into the FKM system. The staff can verify signatures and- approve or reject requests based on the applicant???s eligibility. The applicant can check the status of the approval by logging into his account from time to time. The applicant also gets email alerts about the status of the application. Upon approval by the three departments the applicant can collect the Fob Key from facilities office. The system ensures security features such as authentication, data integrity, non-repudiation and trust. Role Based Access Control (RBAC) is implemented to control the information the user sees and also ensure that an authorized person is approving the requests. The application is implemented using C#(.

40|$|Only the {{abstract}} {{is available for}} this technical report. Group communication is as an important functionality, which needs to be supported by various communication technologies. Applications of group communication include IP (or application-level) multicast, wireless and/or ad-hoc networks, broadcast, conference calling, pay-per-view, and even such seemingly unrelated to networks areas as copy protection. For many, if not all, of these applications, security and trust play an important role. Securing group communication typically requires confidentiality and authentication, which typically rely on secret keys. Thus key management issues must be addressed.

40|$|This study uses an {{orthodox}} grounded theory methodology {{to discover the}} main professional concerns of managers responsible for the establishment and maintenance of public-private partnerships (PPPs) involving local governments and private sector firms. In addition, this study explains the social processes that these managers use to resolve these concerns {{over the life of}} a PPP project. Orthodox grounded theory is an inductive research methodology capable of theory building. It was selected for use for several reasons. These included its ability to provide an explanation of the variation in the patterns of behaviour of respondents as they establish and manage a PPP project. Data was collected from ten PPP projects in both Australia and the UK through interviews with forty three respondents, non-participant observation and archival records. Data was analysed using the constant comparative method and involved the use of theoretical memos and theoretical sampling procedures. The main professional concern of respondents over the managerial life of a PPP project involves the need to maintain the forward momentum of a project whilst also having to constantly resolve managerial issues through a process of seeking the cooperation of managers from the partner organisation. <b>Key</b> <b>managers</b> continuously resolve this concern through the social process of ‘managing synergetic momentum’ (MSM). The grounded theory of MSM suggests that in circumstances where there exists strong emotional bonds, mutual trust and respect, <b>key</b> <b>managers</b> are likely to make a conscious decision to manage a PPP project through largely informal methods that often rely on the use of psychological contracts between individuals. In contrast, when there are low levels of emotional bonding between <b>key</b> <b>managers,</b> the style of management chosen by managers is often formal and bureaucratic in nature. This management style often involves the use of committee and other formal decision making processes to resolve managerial issues. An informal management style can be an effective means to address the issues of maintaining forward momentum of a PPP and managing in a cooperative manner with other <b>key</b> <b>managers.</b> This study contributes to the extant literature in several ways. Firstly, it provides insights into, and an explanation of, the actions of <b>key</b> <b>managers</b> in the process of managing PPP projects. It provides another dimension in the PPP literature to the micromanagement of PPPs. Secondly, it provides conceptual support to many of the themes contained in the cooperative inter-organisational relationship (CIOR) literature by contextualising the dynamics of the social processes that underlie these themes. The grounded theory of MSM is also significant in that it provides practitioners in the substantive area of inquiry with a number of recommendations designed to assist in their control over the management of a PPP project. In addition, the grounded theory of MSM identifies a number of avenues for future research that may add further {{to our understanding of the}} management of PPPs...|$|R
