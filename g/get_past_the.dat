5|$|Defenders of Ardania is a tower defense {{game that}} also has {{offensive}} real-time strategy elements. As with all tower defense games, the player must defend their home base by building {{several types of}} static tower units that fire at weak offensive units spawned by the opponent. In Defenders of Ardania, however, players must also spawn soldiers themselves. Like the opponent's soldiers, the player's soldiers move along a fixed path towards their opponent's base and cannot be directly maneuvered by the player. The game is won if units spawned by the player <b>get</b> <b>past</b> <b>the</b> opponent's towers and destroy the opponent's base before the opponent's units <b>get</b> <b>past</b> <b>the</b> player's towers and destroy the player's base.|$|E

When the Arabs captured Thessalonica, the Empire's second largest city, it was quickly re-captured by the Byzantines.

In August 1996, they participated in the second edition of the Al-Nasr Al-Adheem Cup, but again they did not win the tournament, losing 3–1 to eventual winners Al-Shorta. They reached the round of 16 in the 1996–97 Iraq FA Cup and didn't <b>get</b> <b>past</b> <b>the</b> group stage in the 1996 Umm Al-Ma'arik Cup. Under the management of Ayoub Odisho, in the 1997–98 season, Al-Talaba finished in fifth place with 61 points, one point behind fourth placed Najaf FC. In the 1997 Umm Al-Ma'arik Cup, they reached the semi-finals but were defeated by Najaf 3–1 on penalties. In the third place match against Al-Zawra'a, Al-Talaba were beaten 7–0 which is the most goals ever conceded in a match by Al-Talaba.|$|E
5|$|In the 2007–08 regular season, Parker {{recorded}} similar averages as {{the previous}} two seasons for points and rebounds, and slightly increased his assists per game average.

For the third time in four years, San Antonio prevailed over Phoenix; Parker had an outstanding first round series, averaging nearly 30 points and 7 assists a game. In the next round against Chris Paul's New Orleans Hornets, the Spurs dropped the first two road games before responding with a strong win in the third game. In that game, Parker recorded a double-double with 31 points and 11 assists. The experienced Spurs took seven games to defeat the Hornets, but were unable to <b>get</b> <b>past</b> <b>the</b> Los Angeles Lakers in the Conference Finals, and the Spurs once again failed to capture back-to-back NBA championships.|$|E

As the boy scout explains {{the reason for his}} visit, the scientist collapses, asking for his pills. At this point the game begins. The player must gather the 16 keys needed to unlock the safe and retrieve the scientist's pills before he passes away. During play the boy scout must negotiate the mansion's rooms, avoiding hazards and the mansion's staff, who have been told to protect the inventions within the mansion, using lethal force if necessary. The staff are unaware of the boy scout's purpose and will attack him should they come into contact.|$|E

5|$|The players {{acquired}} by Fletcher matured {{into one of}} the strongest teams in the league during the mid-1980s and early 1990s. From 1984–85 to 1990–91, the Flames tallied 90 points in every season but one. However, they were usually unable to transform that success into a deep playoff run, largely because they could not get the better of their provincial rivals, the powerhouse Oilers. Although the Oilers and Flames usually finished at or {{near the top of the}} Campbell Conference, the NHL's playoff structure of the time made it very likely that the Flames would meet the Oilers in either the first or second round, rather than in Campbell Conference finals. That same structure made it very likely that the other two playoff qualifiers in the Smythe Division would have to <b>get</b> <b>past</b> <b>the</b> Flames or Oilers (or both) in order to make it to the conference finals. From 1983 until 1990, either the Oilers or the Flames represented the Campbell Conference in the Stanley Cup Finals.|$|E
5|$|The team {{began the}} 2010 MLS season slowly with {{injuries}} to key players that impacted Schmid's starting lineups. The team {{had a record}} of 4–8–3 over the first 15 games. The Sounders also advanced through the preliminary round of the 2010–11 CONCACAF Champions League but failed to <b>get</b> <b>past</b> <b>the</b> group stage. The 2010 U.S. Open Cup campaign culminated in Schmid winning his third championship with a 2–1 victory over the Crew at Seattle's Qwest Field. No MLS team had previously won back-to-back Open Cups. The Sounders rebounded {{in the second half}} of the regular season with a 10–2–3 record to qualify for the playoffs. The team faced Bruce Arena's Galaxy in the two-legged quarter-final. Both coaches are considered to be among the best in the MLS, and it was the first meeting between the two in the playoffs. The Sounders lost by a 3–1 aggregate and Arena moved within one game of Schmid's MLS postseason record of 19 wins.|$|E
5|$|In 1968, {{the club}} won their third Portuguese Cup and {{qualified}} for the 1968–69 Cup Winners' Cup. As in previous years, {{they were unable to}} <b>get</b> <b>past</b> <b>the</b> second round, losing 4–1 on aggregate to Slovan Bratislava. Porto's last participation in the Fairs Cup, in 1969–70, also ended in the second round, with a defeat against holders Newcastle United. Domestically, Porto finished the league in an all-time low ninth place, thus failing to qualify for European competition in the 1970–71 season. They returned the following season to participate in the inaugural edition of the UEFA Cup, which officially replaced the Fairs Cup, but their debut against Nantes led to another premature exit. Porto returned to this tournament in four of the following five seasons, the exception being 1973–74, when it failed qualification for European competitions. In the first of those seasons (1972–73), Porto reached the third round of a European competition for the first time, but were eliminated by Dynamo Dresden. They beat Barcelona in the first round, in what was the teams' first European encounter and the only time Porto eliminated the Spanish side from European competitions. In the 1975–76 UEFA Cup, Porto were again eliminated in the third round, but in the process they beat Luxembourg's Avenir Beggen with a club record home (7–0) and aggregate (10–0) win scores. In {{the first round of the}} following season's UEFA Cup, Porto were matched with Schalke 04. After a tie in the first leg, Porto squandered a 2–0 lead in the second leg, conceding three goals in the last 15 minutes, which resulted in their elimination.|$|E
