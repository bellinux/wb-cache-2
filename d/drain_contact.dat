5|$|Bubbles is {{an action}} game with puzzle {{elements}} where the player controls the protagonist, a soap bubble, from a top-down perspective. The {{object is to}} clean a kitchen sink by maneuvering over ants, crumbs, and grease spots to absorb them before they slide into the drain. As the bubble absorbs more objects, it grows in size, eventually acquiring first eyes and then a smiling mouth. At the same time, sponges and scrub brushes slowly move around the sink, cleaning {{it on their own}} in competition with the player. Touching either of these enemies costs a player one life unless the bubble is large enough to have a complete face. In this case, the enemy will be knocked away and the bubble will shrink. Sponges and brushes can be knocked into the drain for bonus points, eliminating them from play. Two other enemies in the sink are stationary razor blades and roaches that crawl out of the <b>drain.</b> <b>Contact</b> with a blade is always fatal, while the bubble can safely touch the roach only while carrying a broom, which will kill the roach with one hit. The broom can be acquired by running over a cleaning lady who appears in the sink from time to time.|$|E
50|$|Drain-induced barrier {{lowering}} or DIBL is a short-channel {{effect in}} MOSFETs referring originally {{to a reduction}} of threshold voltage of the transistor at higher drain voltages.In a classic planar field-effect transistor with a long channel, the bottleneck in channel formation occurs far enough from the <b>drain</b> <b>contact</b> that it is electrostatically shielded from the drain by {{the combination of the}} substrate and gate, and so classically the threshold voltage was independent of drain voltage.In short-channel devices this is no longer true: The drain is close enough to gate the channel, and so a high drain voltage can open the bottleneck and turn on the transistor prematurely.|$|E
50|$|The {{first of}} four {{scheduled}} rendezvous burns was attempted on December 20, 1998 at 22:00 UT. The burn sequence was initiated but immediately aborted. The spacecraft subsequently entered safe mode and began tumbling. The spacecraft's thrusters fired thousands of times during the anomaly, which expended 29 kg of propellant reducing the program's propellant margin to zero. This anomaly almost resulted {{in the loss of}} the spacecraft due to lack of solar orientation and subsequent battery <b>drain.</b> <b>Contact</b> between the spacecraft and mission control could not be established for over 24 hours. The root cause of this incident has not been determined, but software and operational errors contributed to the severity of the anomaly.|$|E

In a multifinger layout, the <b>drain</b> <b>contact</b> region {{was designed to be}} wider than the channel region. The wider drain increases the equivalent drift region width to reduce the drift resistance and suppress the quasi-saturation effect. We found that the wide-drain multifinger LDMOS devices have lower on-resistance, higher cutoff frequency, higher maximum oscilla-tion frequency, and better power performances than the standard multifinger ones.
