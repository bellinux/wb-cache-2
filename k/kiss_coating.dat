The first problem, considered experimentally, is that of reverse roll coating with a liquid reservoir positioned directly above horizontally aligned rollers. Measurements of the film thickness {{as a function of the}} height of fluid in the reservoir and speed ratio are presented. When the wetting line is located downstream of the nip, either a decrease in the height of the associated hydrostatic head or an increase in the speed ratio causes a reduction in the thickness of the outgoing film. However, when the wetting line is located upstream of the nip the opposite is found to be true. The bead-break instability in forward meniscus coating is considered both experimentally and analytically. Agreement between predictions from a simple mathematical model of the stable bead and experimentally determined meniscus positions is seen to be excellent. A perturbation hypothesis is used to predict the onset of the bead-break instability, at which the upstream meniscus accelerates rapidly towards the downstream one, so the two collide and the bead collapses. The results from the model compare well with experiments. An outline of a method for using the bead-break instability as a design criterion is also presented. Typically in a slot, blade or knife coater the downstream meniscus is assumed to pin at a corner of the coating device. In chapter 5, a series of experiments and a corresponding computational study, are presented which illustrate that the meniscus can advance up the face of such coating devices (in this case a roll-flat plate system). Reducing the corner angle is seen to reduce the size of the climb region and the associated recirculation at this point at the downstream meniscus. It is also shown that the meniscus can detach from the corner and retreat into the gap, which can in turn give rise to the ribbing instability. An offset gravure coating arrangement is considered in chapter 6. The coating arrangement is split into two areas of study - the offset gravure nip and the <b>kiss</b> <b>coating</b> bead. An experimental investigation of the offset nip with the two rolls vertically aligned and running at the same speed in forward mode reveals two ways in which the metered film thickness can be influenced. Either increasing the nip force by pressing the two rolls together or decreasing the roll speeds causes a reduction in the metered film thickness. At higher speeds the metered film thickness is observed to asymptote to a limiting value, the value of which depends on the gravure pattern. The reverse mode <b>kiss</b> <b>coating</b> bead operating at speed ratios greater than one is also investigated. Experiments reveal that under these conditions, all the fluid is transferred from the roll surface to the web and the two make contact due to the generation of a sub-ambient pressure field within the bead. Two models based on lubrication theory are derived, one assuming an infinitely tensioned web and a second that incorporates the effect of web flexibility. The latter is found to give much better agreement with the experimental data. Finally a perturbation hypothesis is applied to these to models in order to predict the onset of the ribbing instability, both of which are found to give reasonable agreement with the experimental data. Finally, the results of a systematic experimental investigation of reverse mode direct gravure coating is reported, where the web runs directly over a gravure roll surface. This wide ranging parametric study illustrates the effect of the operating parameters on the final film thickness. Key findings are that speed ratio, fluid properties and cell shape and size can significantly influence the final film thickness. For a fixed roll speed it is observed that as the web speed is increased the gravure bead becomes unstable. This results in streaking on the web, and gives an upper limit to the speed ratio. ...|$|E

5000|$|Unassuming José Locota (John Qualen) disarms Agnew and confiscates the gun, {{compelling}} {{him to sit}} quietly. Gustave Pardee (Robert Newton), who {{up until}} now has {{made no secret of}} his fear of flying, inspires calm in his terrified fellow passengers. Dan calmly explains the situation, trying to lessen their anxiety, but warns that their chances of making the coast are [...] "one in a thousand." [...] The passengers rally around each other and find changed perspectives about their existing problems. They toss luggage from the airliner to lighten its load, with May Holst literally <b>kissing</b> her mink <b>coat</b> goodbye.|$|R

People were in tears. People were delirious. And this happened many a time after." [...] When Sévigny introduced Diefenbaker to a Montreal rally with the words [...] "Levez-vous, levez-vous, saluez votre chef!" [...] (Rise, rise, salute your chief!) according to Postmaster General William Hamilton [...] "thousands and thousands of people, jammed into that auditorium, just tore the roof off in a frenzy." [...] Michael Starr remembered, [...] "That was the most fantastic election... I went into little places. Smoky Lake, Alberta, where nobody ever saw a minister. Canora, Saskatchewan. Every meeting was jammed... The halls would be filled with people and {{sitting there in the}} front would be the first Ukrainian immigrants with shawls and hands gnarled from work... I would switch to Ukrainian and the tears would start to run down their faces... I don't care who says what won the election; it was the emotional aspect that really caught on." ...|$|R
5|$|Camping for {{the night}} on a riverbank, Andrei and Foma are {{collecting}} firewood for their group when Andrei hears the distant sounds of celebration further upstream in the woods. Going to investigate he encounters {{a large group of}} naked pagans, who are conducting a torch lit ritual for Midsummer. Andrei is intrigued and excited by the behaviour of the pagans but is caught spying on a couple making love, is tied to the crossbeam of a hut in a mockery of Jesus' crucifixion and is threatened with drowning in the morning. A woman named Marfa (Nelly Snegina), dressed only in a fur coat approaches Andrei. After explaining that her people are persecuted for their beliefs she drops her <b>coat,</b> <b>kisses</b> Andrei and then unties him. Andrei runs away, and is lost in the dense woods, scratching his face. The next morning Andrei returns to his group, including Daniil, and as they leave on their boats a group of soldiers appear on the riverbank chasing after several of the pagans including Marfa. Her partner is captured but she makes her naked escape by swimming into the river past Andrei’s boat. He and his fellow monks look away in shame.|$|R
5000|$|Charlotte Sullivan portrays Gail Peck. She spent a {{few years}} as a half-goth. Underneath her caustic exterior, Gail is {{vulnerable}} and feels lonely. Because of her connections to high-ranking officials in the police force she is often seen by others as getting preferential treatment. Her mother is a superintendent, her father is an inspector, her brother a successful narcotics detective, and her godfather is the chief of police. Because of this, she feels the need to prove to herself and others that she {{can do the job}} without help, which further isolates her. In Season 1, she develops a relationship with Chris Diaz. However, the two break up in season 2 because Chris believes that she likes Dov but none of them are willing to clarify how they really feel. In Season 3 it is revealed that she was previously engaged to the new rookie, Nick Collins, with whom she begins a new relationship. Later, she is kidnapped by a cab driver after working undercover as an escort and is rescued, but at the expense of Detective Jerry Barber's life. When she takes the fall for a shooting in the 15 Division, her job is put on the line, but she does not lose it under the condition that she be treated as a new rookie. Gail ends up isolating herself from her friends due to the way she treats Chloe. Seeing how close Nick and Andy had gotten since their undercover operation, she becomes jealous and cheats on Nick with a detective who worked with him and Andy during their sting operation. As a result, she and Nick break up. Later in season 4, she ends up meeting and befriending Holly, a forensic specialist, and lesbian. The two share a brief <b>kiss</b> in the <b>coat</b> closet at Frank and Noelle's wedding and eventually begin a tentative relationship. At the end of season 5, Gail and Holly break up and Gail decides to adopt Sophie, the orphaned daughter of a woman killed in a case Gail worked on.|$|R
