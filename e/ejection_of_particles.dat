The Tonejet ejection process concentrates the ink prior to ejecting the droplets onto the substrate, with continuous greyscale control. The Tonejet printhead is a three-dimensional structure consisting of side walls, flow channels and ejectors. An ink meniscus is formed between the side walls and the ejector.

40|$|The role of two-way {{interphase}} coupling {{effects in}} subharmonically forced, dilute, particle laden mixing layers is investigated. Temporally growing Lagrangian–Eulerian numerical simulations address both uni-formly {{as well as}} differentially seeded flows. Emphasis is placed on a vorticity-based interpretation of the simulation results. Expanding the fluid vorticity source term due to two-way coupling demonstrates the importance <b>of</b> <b>particle</b> concentration gradients and ‘slip vorticity’. For uniformly laden mixing layers and intermediate St particles, {{the reduction in the}} growth rate of the Kelvin–Helmholtz instability by the two-way coupling effects also slows down vortex pairing. At large St, a layered vorticity structure in the outer regions of the vortex cores results from the thick or even double banded nature of the braids. By causing the vortices to rotate around each other, the subharmonic forcing also enhances the particle transport away {{from the center of the}} mixing layer. Intermediate St particles are seen to benefit the most from this mechanism, so that they can, at least temporarily, exceed the dispersion rate of the passive case. For dif-ferentially loaded mixing layers, the vorticity source term is seen to cause an asymmetry in the pairing process, by weakening the upstream and strengthening the downstream vortex, which subsequently dom-inates the pairing. For intermediate St particles, this asymmetry leads to a more rapid <b>ejection</b> <b>of</b> <b>particle...</b>|$|R
40|$|A simple model {{accounting}} for the <b>ejection</b> <b>of</b> heavy <b>particles</b> from the vortical structures of a turbulent flow is introduced. This model involves a space and time discretization of the dynamics and depends on only two parameters: the fraction of space-time occupied by rotating structures of the carrier flow and {{the rate at which}} particles are ejected from them. The latter can be heuristically related to the response time <b>of</b> the <b>particles</b> and hence measure their inertia. It is shown that such a model reproduces qualitatively most aspects of the spatial distribution <b>of</b> heavy <b>particles</b> transported by realistic flows. In particular the probability density function of the mass m in a cell displays an power-law behavior at small values and decreases faster than exponentially at large values. The dependence of the exponent of the first tail upon the parameters of the dynamics is explicitly derived for the model. The right tail is shown to decrease as (-C m m).

These results strongly suggest that the deviation from Gaussian distributions {{is a consequence of}} the splash process which is exclusively present in saltation transport over an erodible bed. We further suggest that the non-Gaussian statistics is intimately related to the statistical properties of a single splash event which produces <b>ejection</b> <b>of</b> <b>particles</b> with lift-off velocities distributed according to a lognormal law.

Previous simulations for symmetric fluid quenches pointed {{to the formation of}} `bijels': bicontinuous interfacially jammed emulsion gels.

Experimental work has broadly confirmed this scenario, but shows that bijels can also be formed in volumetrically asymmetric quenches. Here we present new simulation results for such quenches, compare these to the symmetric case, and find a crossover to an arrested droplet phase at strong asymmetry.

40|$|Grains {{exposed to}} {{anisotropic}} radiation fields {{are subjected to}} forces due to the asymmetric photon-stimulated <b>ejection</b> <b>of</b> <b>particles.</b> These forces act {{in addition to the}} ``radiation pressure'' due to absorption and scattering. Here we model the forces due to photoelectron emission and the photodesorption of adatoms. The ``photoelectric'' force depends on the ambient conditions relevant to grain charging. We find that it is comparable to the radiation pressure when the grain potential is relatively low and the radiation spectrum is relatively hard. The calculation of the ``photodesorption'' force is highly uncertain, since the surface physics and chemsitry of grain materials are poorly understood at present. For our simple yet plausible model, the photodesorption force dominates the radiation pressure for grains with size >~ 0. 1 micron exposed to starlight from OB stars. We find that the anisotropy of the interstellar radiation field is ~ 10 % in the visible and ultraviolet.
