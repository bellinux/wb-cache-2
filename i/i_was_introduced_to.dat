An alternate version with The Cataracs as the main artists was released in a remix extended play (EP) on March 29, 2011. For the single's UK release, the track was remixed with guest vocals from British rapper Tinie Tempah. The remix was released {{as part of a}} digital EP on April 23, 2011.

2500|$|After a {{visit to}} Jassy (modern Iași), Gordon wrote: [...] "The boyers live {{most of their lives}} in Paris and society is quite French... The prince keeps a great state and <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>introduced</b> <b>to</b> him with much ceremony. The English uniform {{produces}} an immediate sensation". Gordon did not speak Romanian, but his fluency in French allowed him to socialize with the Francophile Romanian elite, who were all fluent in French. As the maps that delineated the Russian-Ottoman frontier were all old and inaccurate, Gordon spent much time clashing with his Russian counterparts about where precisely the frontier was and soon discovered that Russians were very keen to have the frontier on the Danube, which Gordon had orders from London to prevent. Gordon called the Romanians the [...] "most fickle and intriguing people on the earth. They ape the French in everything and are full of ceremony, dress, etc... The employees sent by the Moldovan government to take over the ceded territory have been receiving bribes and trafficking in the most disgraceful manner." ...|$|E
2500|$|As {{recounted in}} his 1952 memoir Witness, Whittaker Chambers {{came to know}} Lore because they both {{reported}} to rezident Markin: [...] He described him as follows: [...] Lore was an old Bolshevik. He had been a Socialist before the Russian Revolution. In those pre-revolutionary days, {{he had been the}} friend of Trotsky, then a New York Socialist journalist. After the Revolution, Lore had managed an American speaking trip for Alexandra Kollontai, the author of Red Love, later the Soviet ambassador to Sweden. [...] Bukharin, in his New York days, had eaten and slept in the apartment on 55th Street in Brooklyn, where Lore, his outspokenly anti-Communist wife and three wholly American sons still lived. [...] He describes the Lore family with some detail: [...] <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>introduced</b> <b>to</b> Lillian Lore, Ludwig's remarkable wife, who in large part provided those meals, and, by some economic miracle, had kept that amazing household together during the long, lean years, had fed the endless procession of guests. [...] "Die unvergessliche Lores-the unforgettable Lores," [...] a German friend had called them... I have seldom seen a happy family life so explicit in the characters of all who shared it... I soon came to regard the Lores' house as a kind of second home. [...] For Ludwig I developed an almost filial feeling as of a younger for an older revolutionist. [...] The kindness of all the Lores to me was personal, and in spite of politics, for all {{the other members of the}} family, except Ludwig, were outspoken in their detestation of the Communist Party. [...] Chambers also describes a defector's fear of retribution from the Soviet Underground, which Lore and he shared: [...] I did not know that at the very time I was visiting him most frequently, Lore was under surveillance. [...] He was being watched, not by the American authorities, but by the Russian secret police... I discovered that he was afraid to walk alone with me on the street at night and that he was terrified to get into an automobile alone with me. Then I knew that there was something seriously amiss. But I had been out of the Communist Party six or seven years, and Lore was dead, before I discovered that the old Bolshevik, in whom, as a younger man, I respected the older revolutionist, had denounced me (around 1941) to the F.B.I. I learned it not from the FBI, but from another security agency of the Government. [...] I respected Lore all the more for that act. My feeling for him and for all the Lores remained unchanged.|$|E

2500|$|Many {{artists have}} cited Fripp as an {{influence}} or have expressed their admiration for him, including Steven Wilson, Omar Rodríguez-López,Omar Rodríguez-López: Selvfølgelig ikke! Jeg gjør faktisk ingen forsøk på å skjule min affekt for Fripps arbeider. [...] ble jeg introdusert for King Crimson, og på nytt kollapset alt, men på en konstruktiv måte. [...] Fripp tryllet i alle fall fram de vakreste toner jeg hadde hørt, og han kunne ikke ha gitt seg til kjenne på et mer gunstig tidspunkt i mitt liv. [...] Ingen kan nekte for at Robert Fripp, også helt tidlig i karrieren, var opptatt av jazz eller de blå notene. Durskalaer og oppstemte gjengroprefrenger har aldri appellert til meg, så da King Crimson ble meg til del var det som å smake på en bit av himmelriket.

[...] <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>introduced</b> <b>to</b> King Crimson and again everything collapsed, but in a constructive way. [...] Fripp made the most beautiful notes that I had heard, and he couldn't have been introduced to me at a better time in my life. [...] As soon as someone discovers jazz, it will influence their approach irrespective of which style or band the person concerned contributes to. It can't be denied that Robert Fripp was into jazz throughout his career or the blue notes. The major-scales and euphoric stadium-rock choruses have never appealed to me so when I got familiar with King Crimson's music it was like getting a taste of heaven.) }} Trey Anastasio of Phish, St. Vincent, Kirk Hammett of Metallica,Kirk Hammett: There are fewer 30-part orchestrated guitar sections, fewer massive, bludgeoning riffs perfectly replicated by lames. There are more flexible ideas, more artistic flourishes, more colors. I've probably been influenced in that direction by people like Robert Fripp, Adrian Belew and David Torn. I'm more interested in using guitar sounds as textures and using effects in a more textural fashion. To paraphrase Robert Fripp, I'm more interested in painting a soundscape like he and Adrian Belew do in King Crimson, on Bowie records and in Fripp's solo stuff.

What I like about that is that without a blueprint, it’s just really weird music. Robert Fripp is an astonishingly good guitar player. Just doing the wierdest shit.

40|$|Abstract—In this paper, a new polarimetric {{scattering}} parameter, the averaged intensity (<b>I),</b> <b>is</b> <b>introduced</b> <b>to</b> {{present the}} backscatter intensity of fully polarimetric SAR data. According {{to the particular}} analysis on the properties of I, α angle and entropy H, the mapping rule of I-α-H feature space onto the Intensity-Hue-Saturation (I-H-S) color space is proposed. We use the IHS transform instead of segmentation algorithm to finish the classification. The important advantages of this method are that {{the information contained in}} the I-α-H feature space is preserved without any loss in the resulting image, and the execution time is saved since IHS transform is faster than most complicated segmentations. The result shows that I has the additional information which is not contained in α and H, and the classification result is more readable than that of H/α/A.
