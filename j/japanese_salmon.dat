The model reproduced the body size of the 1972 and 1991 year classes of chum salmon, respectively. Reproduced body size of the 1972 year class is larger than that of 1991 year class. This result shows a good agreement with the observations in the Bering Sea. Moreover, our model reproduces the trend of body size in l 970 - 2000 well.

To investigate this body size reduction in the North Pacific, we developed a bioenergetics model for chum salmon coupled with the results from a lower trophic ecosystem model embedded into a three-dimensional global model.

The model reproduced the body size of the 1972 and 1991 year classes of chum salmon. The reproduced body size of the 1972 year class was larger than that of 1991 year class, and this result agrees with observations from the Bering Sea.

In this paper, we focus on predation by salmon sharks (Lamna ditropis) in oceanic offshore waters of the North Pacific Ocean and report on possible substantial impact of their predation on salmon stocks, based on the recent increase in salmon shark abundance {{on the high seas}} of the North Pacific Ocean. Also, we discuss predation impact by daggertooth (Anotopterus nikparini, formerly A. pharao) on salmon stocks, based on current information on their abundance and frequency of occurrence of slash marks on the lateral side of high-seas salmon caused by the attack of daggertooth. We calculated annual CPUE (number/ 1000 tan of surface gillnets) of salmon sharks using the data collected by <b>Japanese</b> <b>salmon</b> research vessels that operated in the western and central North Pacific Ocean from 1972 to 2000.

40|$|Thesis (Ph. D.) [...] University of Washington, 1998 Habitat {{selection}} and life history patterns were compared among three species of small cetaceans {{in the central}} North Pacific Ocean: Dall's porpoise (Phocoenoides dalli), northern right whale dolphin (Lissodelphis borealis) and Pacific white-sided dolphin (Lagenorhynchus obliquidens). Biological samples and fisheries data used for analysis of habitat preferences were obtained by observers monitoring Japanese high seas squid driftnet operations between 36 ∘N and 46 ∘N, and 152 ∘E and 150 ∘W during 1990 and 1991. Supplementary data used for analysis of Dall's porpoise life history were collected between 46 ∘N and 53 ∘N and 168 ∘E and 175 ∘E in the <b>Japanese</b> <b>salmon</b> mothership fishery from 1981 to 1987. The main objective {{was to determine if}} habitat partitioning mechanisms could be detected among the three marine mammal species. Two approaches were taken. First, reproductive patterns were compared, with special attention to calving seasonality. The timing and location of calving activity were indicated as possible factors differentiating habitat use, operating: (a) spatially between P. dalli and L. borealis, (b) temporally between L. borealis and L. obliguidens, and (c) both spatially and temporally between L. obliquidens and P. dalli. Second, canonical correspondence analysis (CCA) was used: (a) to compare species locations in ordination space along observed environmental gradients (i. e., habitat features), and (b) to compare community association patterns among the three marine mammal species and other marine organisms caught in the same driftnets. Monthly records, from June to September were examined separately and compared. Sea surface temperature was the most influential habitat parameter examined, with L. borealis occupying the warmest waters, P. dalli the coolest, and L. obliquidens in between, but with greater preference overlap with P. dalli. Habitat partitioning was best expressed by mature female L. borealis, in July, during their calving period. Mature female L. borealis associated with a consistent assemblage of other marine organisms during July and August while associations among other species were more varied. Collectively, these findings suggest that habitat preference patterns for these three species may be specific to reproductively active females, while coincident habitat use among other species constituents is common...|$|E

40|$|Abstract: Chum salmon (Oncorhynchus keta) {{is a major}} {{pelagic fish}} species in the Bering Sea and North Pacific ecosystems. The stock-specific ocean {{distribution}} of chum salmon was estimated by genetic stock identification (GSI) and hatchery otolith marks. Fish were caught by 1 -h trawls at 98 stations in the Bering Sea, North Pacific Ocean and Gulf of Alaska during the early summer (June/July) and late summer/early fall (August/September) of 2003. Tissue samples were collected from chum salmon (n = 3, 980) and run for 20 allozyme loci to estimate the stock composition of mixtures. In addition, otoliths were collected from chum salmon (n = 4, 424) and examined for mark patterns to determine hatchery origin. The GSI-estimates combined with catch data (CPUE) indicated that the ocean distribution patterns of immature chum salmon were different among eleven regional stocks.

40|$|As {{a result}} of our {{investigation}} on the stomach contents of 148 animals and the gonad of 103 animals from among many DALL'S porpoises which had been caught by the <b>Japanese</b> <b>salmon</b> fishing gill nets in the Bering Sea and the North Pacific Ocean in 1964 and 1965, the following characteristics have been ascertained. The sampling period in each year lasted for three months from the latter part of May to the first part of August. 1) The stomach contents of infant porpoises were their mother's milk in all cases; no other food was found; and there was no empty stomach. 2) In this sea area, small marine animals (squid, fish and shrimp) for the food of porpoises were very abundant in this season, but generally the quantity of their stomach contents was not so large. 3) No significant difference was recognized in quantity and kind of stomach contents between male and female, but there was a distinct difference between pregnant and nonpregnant animals. The contents were less in quantity and more polyphagous in the former than in the latter. 4) Squid were very abundant in this sea area in this season, and porpoises ate mostly these squid. Sometimes fish and shrimps were found among the stomach contents but these were very small in quantity in camparison with squid. 5) There was only one sample of red salmon in the investigated stomachs, but it is most likely porpoises do not eat adult salmons as their food. It is not clear whether or not small size salmons in this sea area are caught by porpoises. It is subject to future investigations. 6) As {{a result of}} the investigation in 1965, it was clarified that the period of parturition for the porpoises in this sea area is between the latter part of July and the first part of August. 7) It is presumed that the body length of a baby porpoise at the time of parturition is about 100 cm. 8) It is believed that the pregnant period of porpoises is less than a year. Fetuses were found in the left uterine cornu in all cases. 9) A sexually mature male is 185 cm in body length or more, and three years or more in age. 10) Any perfectly ripe testis was not found in this investigation in spite of many large male samples. It is deemed that the time of copulation came after the period of this investigation. This is also evident from the result of the investigation of the ovaries. There was no difference in weight between the left and right testes. 11) There was no difference in size between the left and right ovaries in the stage of fetus, but since childhood, the left ovary became larger than the other. Ovulation from the left ovary was observed in all cases (83 cases) {{with the exception of one}} case. The right ovary was immature in those 83 cases. 12) The corpus luteum projected to the outside of the overy and the size was four or five times as large as that of the ovary. 13) The corpus luteum of ovulation (corpus luteum menstruationis) was not found in this season. This is on account of the fact that the period of this investigation did not fall on the pairing-time of this species. This is also evident from the observation of hystological ovarian sections. 14) With this species, too, the corpus luteum fade away quickly into the ovary when its function terminates and becomes the corpus albicans, but it seems that the corpus albicans in the ovary of this species does not disappear for their whole life as in the case of large whales. 15) Most of the females reach sexual maturity after two full years since their birth. The body length at that time is about 170 cm. 16) Most of the vesicular follicles do not ovulate but fade away, and on account of the increase in cells of the follicular epithelium, the liquor folliculi disappears and the follicle becomes hyaline and then disappears. 17) The lutein cells in the corpus luteum disappear quickly after the parturition. 18) The growth curve of DALL'S porpoises drawn from their body length and body weight (Fig. 6) which had been investigated in 1964 and 1965, is shown in Fig. 7. 19) One individual of common porpoise and one individual of BAIRD'S beaked whale were caught by the salmon fishing gill nets in addition to DALL'S porpoises in the season of 1965, and they were investigated. 1964 年, 1965 年の両年北洋母船式鮭鱒漁業の流し網にかかった多くのDALL'S porpoiseのうち, 148 頭について胃内容の, 103 頭について生殖巣の調査を行なった結果,次のことが明らかになった. 期間は 5 月下旬から 8 月上旬の 3 ヵ月間である. 1) 稚体の胃内容は総て乳液であり,他の餌は全く発見できなかった. また,空胃は存在しなかった. 2) 本海域はこの時期には餌料生物が非常に豊富であるにもかかわらず,一般に胃内容量は少ない. 3) 雌雄による胃内容の量および種類の差は認められないが,妊娠獣と非妊娠獣では明らかな差があり,前者の方が量は少なく雑食性である. 4) 本海域のこの時期ではイカ類が頗る豊富で本種の主食になっている. 胃内容にはこの他にエビ類・雑魚も発見されるが,これらはイカ類に比べて量的に極めて少ない. 5) ベニザケを摂食していた事例が一つあったが,本種は成長した鮭鱒に対して殆んど食害を与えていないと推定される. 小型の鮭鱒に対する食害については不明であり,今後の調査に待ちたい. 6) 本海域における本種の分娩時期は 7 月下旬より 8 月上旬にかけてである. 7) 本種の分娩体長は 100 cm前後と推定された. 8) 妊娠期間は 1 年未満と推察される. 胎児はすべて左側の子宮角から発見された. 9) 本種の雄の性的成熟体長は 185 cm以上であり,満 3 才以上である. 10) 本調査時期中には完熟精巣は全く発見されず,交尾の時期はこの調査時以後に到来するものと思われる. これは卵巣の調査からもいえる. 精巣では左右による重量(成熟度) の差は見られない. 11) 卵巣の大きさは胎児の時は左右の差はないが,幼体以降においては左側の方が他よりも大である. また排卵は 1 例を除いて総て(83 例) 左側の卵巣より行なっていた. 右側の卵巣は未成熟の状態である. 12) 本種の黄体は卵巣外に突出し,その大きさは卵巣の 4 ～ 5 倍である. 13) 本漁期中には単なる排卵の黄体は全く発見されていない. これはこの漁期が本種﻿交尾の時期以外であるためである. このことは組織学的調査による卵巣の状態からもいえる. 14) 黄体はその機能が終れば急速に卵巣中に収縮して白体となるが,しかし,本種の白体は消失しない. 15) 本種の雌の性的成熟は大部分は生後満 2 年経過した後である. そしてその時の体長は約 170 cmである. 16) 卵巣中の胞状卵胞は殆んどがその機能を果さずに収縮する. すなわち卵胞萎縮である. そして卵胞膜細胞の増殖侵入によって卵胞液が消失し,硝子様帯となってその姿を消す. 17) 黄体細胞は分娩後始めて急速に消失する. 18) 漁期中測定した本種の体長・体重(Fig. 6) より成長曲線を描くとFig. 7 のごとくなる. 19) 漁期中,鮭鱒流し網には本種の他に小型歯鯨類はネズミイルカ 1 頭・槌鯨 1 頭が網にかかり調査された...|$|E

In the pituitary, amounts of mRNA encoding gonadotropin (GTH) IIβ and somatolactin were elevated in stocks migrating a long river (Kitahashi et al. 1998; Taniyama et al. 1999) and a short river upstream (Onuma et al. 2003 b). Plasma levels of testosterone (T), 11 -ketotestosterone (11 KT) and estradiol- 17 β (E 2) decreased along with final gonadal maturation, while those of 17 α- 20 β-dihydroxy- 4 -pregnen- 3 -one (DHP) and cortisol elevated at the final phases of the spawning migration (Onuma et al. 2003 a, b).

25|$|As one {{contemporary}} points out, {{there were}} economic benefits with the internment of Japanese Canadians. Specifically, white fishermen directly benefited {{due to the}} impounding of all Japanese-Canadian owned fishing boats. Fishing for salmon was a hotly contested issue between the white Canadians and Japanese Canadians. In 1919, Japanese Canadians received four thousand and six hundred of the salmon-gill net licences, representing roughly half {{of all of the}} licences the government had to distribute. In a very public move on behalf of the Department of Fisheries in British Columbia, it was recommended that in the future Japanese Canadians should never again receive more fishing licences than they had in 1919 and also that every year thereafter that number be reduced. These were measures taken on behalf of the provincial government to oust the <b>Japanese</b> from <b>salmon</b> fishing. The federal government also got involved in 1926, when the House of Commons’ Standing Committee on Fisheries put forward suggestions that the number of fishing licences issued to Japanese Canadians be reduced by ten percent a year, until they were entirely removed from the industry by 1937. The fact that any Japanese Canadians were still fishing in British Columbia at the outset of World War II is amazing due to the pressure they faced from the province, country, and other fishermen. Yet the reason the government gave for impounding the few remaining and operating Japanese-Canadian fishing boats was that the government feared these boats would be used by Japan to mount a horrific coastal attack on British Columbia.|$|R
40|$|Pacific salmon (Oncorhynchus spp.) play an {{important}} role as a keystone species and provider of ecosystem services in the North Pacific ecosystem. We review our studies on recent production trends, marine carrying capacity, climate effects and biological interactions between wild and hatchery origin populations of Pacific salmon in the open sea, with a particular focus on <b>Japanese</b> chum <b>salmon</b> (O. keta). Salmon catch data indicates that the abundance of Pacific salmon increased since the 1976 / 77 ocean regime shift. Chum and pink salmon (O. gorbuscha) maintained high abundances with a sharp increase in hatchery-released populations since the late 1980 s. Since the 1990 s, the biomass contribution of hatchery returns to the total catch amounts to 50 % for chum salmon, more than 10 % for pink salmon, and less than 10 % for sockeye salmon (O. nerka). We show evidence of density-dependence of growth and survival at sea and how it might vary across spatial scales, and we provide some new information on foraging plasticity that may offer new insight into competitive interactions. The marine carrying capacity of these three species is synchronized with long-term patterns in climate change. At the present time, global warming has positively affected growth and survival of Hokkaido populations of chum salmon. In the future, however, global warming may decrease the marine carrying capacity and the area of suitable habitat for chum salmon in the North Pacific Ocean. We outline future challenges for salmon sustainable conservation management in Japan, and recommend fishery management reform to sustain the hatchery-supported salmon fishery while conserving natural spawning populations...|$|R
25|$|Pacific salmon are {{harvested}} {{throughout the world}} as a source of food in countries ranging from the United States to South Korea. Over the past century, Pacific salmon have been extensively fished through both recreational, artisan and commercial fishing. In fact, since the 1970s there has been a nearly threefold increase in catch of Pacific salmon. As this catch has increased, a selection of reduced body size has been observed. In <b>Japanese</b> Chum <b>Salmon,</b> for example, between 1970 and 1988 there has been a continuous decrease in body weight averaging between 11 and 32 percent. In part, this decline in body weight has been related to the size selective effect of fishing gear used in the harvesting of salmon populations. Salmon of larger body weight are more apt to be caught during fishing efforts, causing lower body weight to be a beneficial character trait for survival. Thus, Pacific salmon have become continuously smaller in body size. However, studies have also shown that for Pacific salmon a larger mean size at the time of reproduction increases the survival of offspring. The life history of salmon favors delayed reproduction because fecundity increased with body size. Consequently, the smaller body size of salmon results in a negative impact on population growth by decreasing the survivability of progeny, and thus decreasing the growth rate of populations. This reduction of productivity in Pacific salmon is, in part, seeded in the overfishing and has caused a reduction in population sizes throughout Pacific salmon species. Today, it seems that population numbers of Pacific salmon are on the rise, however the consequences from the overfishing in the 70s and 80s are still being reflected with the average body size of salmon being smaller than before the event of overfishing.|$|R

In this study, we estimated the potential habitat for chum salmon in the Western Arctic using a bioenergetics model coupled with a three-dimensional lower trophic ecosystem model (3 -D NEMURO). “Potential habitat” was defined as “an area where chum salmon could grow (i. e., the growth rate was positive) ”. In the bioenergetics model, the growth rate of an individual chum salmon was calculated as a function of water temperature, salinity, and prey density, which were obtained from the 3 -D NEMURO model results. To evaluate the habitat responses under a global warming scenario, we used the modeled monthly change of water temperature between 2005 (averaged from 2001 to 2010) and 2095 (averaged from 2091 to 2100) under the IPCC SRES-A 1 B scenario. Our calculations, following the global warming scenario, suggested that the potential habitat for chum salmon would expand to the north due to the increase in water temperature and prey density. In contrast, south of 71 °N during summer, the potential habitat would shrink regionally because the water temperature exceeded the optimal condition...|$|R
40|$|The {{pink salmon}} {{population}} (Oncorhynchus gorbuscha) returning to Hokkaido, Japan, increased substantially from 1975 to 2000. Despite constant hatchery fry releases, the pink salmon catch exhibited a biennial oscillation indicating a fixed 2 -year life cycle {{and a large}} addition of wild fish. Using a mathematical model, Morita et al. (2006) determined that the observed increases in the <b>Japanese</b> pink <b>salmon</b> catch could be explained primarily by climate change, and they attributed production to wild fish production because increasing hatchery releases {{had little effect on}} abundance of returning adults. In Hokkaido, most major rivers have weirs completely blocking the upstream migration of fish in order to capture hatchery broodstock. Therefore, we assumed that rivers with weirs were unsuitable for natural spawning of pink salmon. To check this assumption and investigate the conditions of naturally spawning pink salmon in the Tokoro River, we conducted field surveys to visually inspect spawning streams for counts of pink salmon and redds. Fig. 1. Location of visual surveys conducted in three streams and the weir across the Tokoro River on the Okhotsk coast of Hokkaido. We visually surveyed three tributaries: Tokoro-Horonai, Kuma, and Nikoro Streams (Fig. 1) with survey lengths (areas) of 821 m (3, 454 m 2), 317 m (998 m 2), and 1, 152 m (12, 909 m 2; Table 1), respectively. In 2010, we quantified the number of pink salmon and redds once every 10 days from the beginning of August until the beginning of October. We could not determine when the redds were made, but we confirmed there was superimposition of the redds by subsequent arrival of salmon on the spawning grounds. We counted all redds found daily during the investigation. Throughout the survey, the weir was not submerged and functioned normally. All correspondence should be addressed to M. Iida...|$|R
50|$|Pacific salmon are {{harvested}} {{throughout the world}} as a source of food in countries ranging from the United States to South Korea. Over the past century, Pacific salmon have been extensively fished through both recreational, artisan and commercial fishing. In fact, since the 1970s there has been a nearly threefold increase in catch of Pacific salmon. As this catch has increased, a selection of reduced body size has been observed. In <b>Japanese</b> Chum <b>Salmon,</b> for example, between 1970 and 1988 there has been a continuous decrease in body weight averaging between 11 and 32 percent. In part, this decline in body weight has been related to the size selective effect of fishing gear used in the harvesting of salmon populations. Salmon of larger body weight are more apt to be caught during fishing efforts, causing lower body weight to be a beneficial character trait for survival. Thus, Pacific salmon have become continuously smaller in body size. However, studies have also shown that for Pacific salmon a larger mean size at the time of reproduction increases the survival of offspring. The life history of salmon favors delayed reproduction because fecundity increased with body size. Consequently, the smaller body size of salmon results in a negative impact on population growth by decreasing the survivability of progeny, and thus decreasing the growth rate of populations. This reduction of productivity in Pacific salmon is, in part, seeded in the overfishing and has caused a reduction in population sizes throughout Pacific salmon species. Today, it seems that population numbers of Pacific salmon are on the rise, however the consequences from the overfishing in the 70s and 80s are still being reflected with the average body size of salmon being smaller than before the event of overfishing.|$|R
5000|$|There are two {{closely related}} lep paralogues in Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar). [...] A single lep gene has been {{documented}} for green-spotted pufferfish (Tetraodon nigroviridis), rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss), Arctic charr (Salvelinus alpinus), silver carp (Hypophthalmichthys molitrix), and grass carp (Ctenopharyngodon idellus). In other species {{there are reports of}} two closely related lep paralogues, including common carp (Cyprinus carpio) and Atlantic salmon. More distantly related lep genes have been found in medaka (Oryzias latipes) and zebrafish (Danio rerio). At least 2 leptin genes (lepa and lepb) exist in the crown-clade (Fig. 1). Early findings have shown that lepa and lepb share low interspecies aa identity, and are argued to have arisen through whole genome duplication, which occurred early in the teleost lineage. The duplicity of genes has been described for Atlantic <b>salmon,</b> <b>Japanese</b> medaka, common carp and zebrafish. Both lep paralogues cluster with lepa, and therefore suggest that at least one or more form (lepb) may exist in this species, since it is tetraploid. [...] However, previous attempts using genomic synteny have only found the putative genomic duplicates in medaka and zebrafish paralogue. Currently it remains unclear, whether lepb exists in other teleosts due to the degenerative nature of this paralogue.|$|R
40|$|This paper reviews {{various aspects}} of the biology and effects of 2 caligid copepods, Lepeophtheirus salmonis and Caligus orientalis, on wild and farmed fish in sea and {{brackish}} waters of Japan and adjacent regions. Lepeophtheirus salmonis is a common parasite of wild adult chum (Oncorhynchus keta) and pink (O. gorbuscha) salmon migrating in northern <b>Japanese</b> waters. Masu <b>salmon</b> (O. masou) have the lowest level of infection. Juvenile chum salmon are sometimes infected. This parasite is also found on salmonids in Korean and Russian waters. The species occurs on coho salmon (O. kisutch) and rainbow trout (O. mykiss) farmed in coastal waters of northern Japan, but its infection is not a serious problem, because only young fish are reared and harvested {{in less than a year}} of culture and thus no fish are cultured during summer. This situation is very different from that in Scotland, Ireland, Norway, and Canada where L. salmonis causes serious damage to farms of Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar). Caligus orientalis is a parasite of coastal marine and brackish-water fish in Japan and neighboring countries (Taiwan, China, Korea, and Russia). This parasite has a wide host range and has been reported from over 20 fish species from different orders and families. It infects farmed and experimentally reared fish, such as rainbow trout in Japan, grey mullet (Mugil cephalus) and black porgy (Acanthopagrus schlegeli) in Taiwan, and Mozambique tilapia (Oreochromis mossambicus) in China. Heavy infection results in appetite reduction and death of fish. The parasite is one of the most important pathogens at brackish-water fish farms in Far East Asia...|$|R
