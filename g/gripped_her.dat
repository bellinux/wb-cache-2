6000|$|... "Stand up! stand up!" [...] he said thickly, <b>gripping</b> <b>her</b> arm till it hurt. If {{he had let}} go, {{she would}} have sunk to the ground.|$|R
60|$|He paused so {{long that}} she looked at him. He moved {{a little closer to}} her, his fingers {{suddenly}} <b>gripped</b> <b>her</b> hand.|$|E
60|$|Suddenly he <b>gripped</b> <b>her</b> arm, {{his face}} within a hand's breadth of her own, his words falling hot and quickly on her ear.|$|E

60|$|He {{started for}} the door of the dining-room, but she interposed, and a very {{beautiful}} obstacle she made of herself. His left hand went out as if to <b>grip</b> <b>her,</b> then hesitated. He was patently awed by her soft womanhood.|$|R

60|$|<b>Her</b> <b>grip</b> relaxed. <b>Her</b> hands dropped {{slowly to}} her side. She {{leaned back against}} the circle of his arms, and looked up at him--a strange look, full of a sweet humility.|$|R
