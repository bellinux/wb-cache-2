50|$|A short-line-fault is a {{fault that}} occurs {{on a line}} a few hundred meters to several {{kilometers}} down the line from the circuit breaker terminal. As shown on Figure 5, the TRV is characterized, in its initial part, by a steep rate-of-rise due to a high-frequency oscillation produced by travelling waves that travel {{on the line with}} positive and negative reflections at the circuit breaker terminal and at the <b>fault</b> <b>point,</b> respectively. The superposition of these travelling waves gives the voltage profiles on the line shown on Figures 6 to 14 with, on the horizontal axis, the circuit breaker terminal position on the left and the short-circuit point on the right.|$|E
50|$|In {{a common}} design, {{incoming}} lines have a disconnect switch and a circuit breaker. In some cases, the lines {{will not have}} both, with either a switch or a circuit breaker being all that is considered necessary. A disconnect switch is used to provide isolation, since it cannot interrupt load current. A circuit breaker {{is used as a}} protection device to interrupt fault currents automatically, and may be used to switch loads on and off, or to cut off a line when power is flowing in the 'wrong' direction. When a large fault current flows through the circuit breaker, this is detected through the use of current transformers. The magnitude of the current transformer outputs may be used to trip the circuit breaker resulting in a disconnection of the load supplied by the circuit break from the feeding point. This seeks to isolate the <b>fault</b> <b>point</b> {{from the rest of the}} system, and allow the rest of the system to continue operating with minimal impact. Both switches and circuit breakers may be operated locally (within the substation) or remotely from a supervisory control center.|$|E
50|$|Distance relays {{differ in}} {{principle}} from {{other forms of}} protection in that their performance is not governed by {{the magnitude of the}} current or voltage in the protected circuit but rather on the ratio of these two quantities. Distance relays are actually double actuating quantity relays with one coil energized by voltage and other coil by current. The current element produces a positive or pick up torque while the voltage element produces a negative or reset torque. The relay operates only when the V/I ratio falls below a predetermined value(or set value). During a fault on the transmission line the fault current increases and the voltage at the <b>fault</b> <b>point</b> decreases. The V/I ratio is measured at the location of CTs and PTs. The voltage at the PT location depends on the distance between the PT and the fault. If the measured voltage is lesser, that means the fault is nearer and vice versa. Hence the protection called Distance relay. The load flowing through the line appears as an impedance to the relay and sufficiently large loads (as impedance is inversely proportional to the load) can lead to a trip of the relay {{even in the absence of}} a fault.|$|E
40|$|Abstract – Technology {{development}} in supplying electrical power {{should be in}} parallel with advancement of computer technologies. With these advancements in technologies, reliable and quality of energy to customers can be enhanced by classifying the fault types and determining the fault location precisely within few seconds. Without precise and fast fault location, power restoration plan will take longer time and surely loose customers profit and confidence towards the utilities. This paper presents an intelligent technique for locating <b>fault</b> <b>points</b> in term of their geometrical coordinates in a practical power distribution system. The proposed technique implements an ANFIS approach by using parallel ANFIS blocks for each selected fault types and <b>fault</b> <b>points.</b> Then, the designed ANFIS {{is presented as a}} GUI tool to display <b>fault</b> <b>points</b> in X-Y coordinates whenever the postfault three-phase root-mean-square (RMS) currents is given as the input. The technique produces satisfactory results with an average percentage error of 1. 193 E- 5 % and 0. 0214 % for X and Y coordinates prediction, respectively. The proposed technique is validated through simulations using the commercial software package PSS-ADEPT. The results show that designed parallel ANFIS approach is fast and effective in determining precise fault location in a practical distribution system...|$|R

30|$|When {{there is}} a fault in the network, node {{voltages}} have no directionality according to fault sequence analysis. This is because that voltage drops occur at the nodes at or around the fault and low voltage protections will all act. The <b>fault</b> <b>point</b> has the lowest voltage and voltage increases {{with the increase of}} the electrical distance. Thus voltage information can reflect fault location to some extends, though when voltage data is only available at the key nodes, it is difficult to diagnose the fault. Obviously, when {{there is a}} fault, most power from the power sources will go to the <b>fault</b> <b>point</b> through a minimum impedance path, referred to as the fault power path in this paper. The fault power flow of this path is the biggest and direction is to the <b>fault</b> <b>point.</b> Based on the selection of the fault power path and search tree model, together with current information comparison, fault location can be identified effectively. Thus this paper proposes a MS protection based on centralized searching method, and based on that backup protection can be realized.|$|E
