40|$|In 2001, {{samples of}} liver (n = 38) and perirenal fat (n = 25) (only in males) {{were taken from}} European roe deer (Capreolus capreolus) populating a hilly, wooded {{protected}} area in the Emilia-Romagna region of Northern Italy. Samples were analyzed for organochlorine pesticides dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane (DDT) and its metabolites, hexachlorobenzene (HCB), hexachlorocycloexane alpha-, beta- and <b>gamma-isomers</b> (alpha-, beta- and gamma-HCH), alpha-endosulfan, aldrin, dieldrin and endrin, and the seven PCB 'indicator' congeners IUPAC Nos. 28, 52, 101, 118, 138, 153 and 180, in order to investigate {{the current state of}} contamination of the area and to assess the possible toxicological risks for the monitored species. p,p'-DDE was detected in 95 % of the liver and perirenal fat samples (n = 63), at concentrations ranging from 0. 05). Females were not statistically tested because they were all adults. The levels of organochlorine contaminants were well below those associated with adverse reproductive effects and lethality in mammals...|$|E
40|$|Stanley Miller's 1958 H 2 S-containing experiment, which {{included}} a simulated prebiotic atmosphere of methane (CH 4), ammonia (NH 3), carbon dioxide (CO 2), and hydrogen sulfide (H 2 S) produced several alkyl amino acids, including the alpha-, beta-, and <b>gamma-isomers</b> of aminobutyric acid (ABA) in greater relative yields than had previously been reported from his spark discharge experiments. In the presence of H 2 S, aspariic and glutamic acids could yield alkyl amino acids via the formation of thioimide intermediates. Radical chemistry initiated by passing H 2 S through a spark discharge could have also enhanced alkyl amino acid synthesis by generating alkyl radicals that can help form the aldehyde and ketone precursors to these amino acids. We propose mechanisms that may have influenced the synthesis of certain amino acids in localized environments rich in H 2 S and lightning discharges, similar to conditions near volcanic systems on the early Earth, thus contributing to the prebiotic chemical inventory of the primordial Earth...|$|E
