5|$|S. g. crissalis, (vulnerable) the Lord Howe currawong was {{described}} by English naturalist Richard Bowdler Sharpe in 1877. It appears to have adapted well to human habitation on Lord Howe Island, though the population is small overall, somewhere around 70–80 birds. Although regarded as a subspecies, <b>it</b> <b>has</b> <b>yet</b> to be studied with molecular DNA techniques, which may lead to it being reclassified as a separate species.|$|E
5|$|Football is {{the most}} popular sport in Jordan. The {{national}} football team has improved in recent years, though <b>it</b> <b>has</b> <b>yet</b> to qualify for the World Cup. In 2013, Jordan lost a chance to play at the 2014 World Cup when they lost to Uruguay during inter-confederation play-offs. This was the highest that Jordan had advanced in the World Cup qualifying rounds since 1986. The women's football team is also gaining reputation, and in March 2016 ranked 58th in the world. Jordan hosted the 2016 FIFA U-17 Women's World Cup, the first women's sports tournament in the Middle East.|$|E

25|$|Azumolene is a 30-fold more {{water-soluble}} analog of dantrolene {{that also}} works {{to decrease the}} release of intracellular calcium by its action on the ryanodine receptor.

25|$|The {{uncertainty}} about {{the characteristics of the}} perpetrators, their relationships to the victims, or their motives is primarily due to the dysfunction of the Mexican justice system as most cases have been inadequately investigated and documented.

25|$|In {{response}} to the Supreme Court decision, the House passed H.R. 985, the Whistleblower Protection Act of 2007.

Fear and Loathing in America was published in 2000 and contains letters dating from 1968 to 1976. A third volume, titled The Mutineer: Rants, Ravings, and Missives from the Mountaintop 1977–2005 was edited by Douglas Brinkley and published by Simon & Schuster in 2005.

25|$|Another {{remedy that}} Singapore courts might apply if an {{appropriate}} case arises – though <b>it</b> <b>has</b> <b>yet</b> {{to do so}} – is the granting of temporary validity to unconstitutional laws. When {{a piece of legislation}} is ruled as unconstitutional, a lacuna or gap in the law may ensue as the legislation is void retrospectively and prospectively. The situation is exacerbated if the legislation is one with far-reaching effects. Hence, to overcome the negative impact of such a lacuna, the Supreme Court of Canada has adopted the remedy of granting temporary validity to unconstitutional legislation for the minimum time necessary for the legislature to enact alternative laws.|$|E

The FIB visit to China in September 2017 attracted great interest among various Chinese decision makers and the decision may be taken no later than 2019.|$|E
25|$|It was {{previously}} classified as an African {{variant of the}} Eurasian golden jackal, {{with at least one}} subspecies (Canis anthus lupaster) having been classified as a grey wolf. In 2015, a series of analyses on the species' mitochondrial DNA and nuclear genome demonstrated that it was in fact distinct from both the golden jackal and the grey wolf, and more closely related to grey wolves and coyotes. It is nonetheless still close enough to the golden jackal to produce hybrid offspring, as indicated through genetic tests on jackals in Israel and a 19th-century captive crossbreeding experiment. As the IUCN's golden jackal page has not been updated since 2008, <b>it</b> <b>has</b> <b>yet</b> to recognise the distinctiveness of the African wolf; thus its conservation status has not been evaluated, and no reliable population estimates are available.|$|E
