2500|$|As pro {{attendance}} slackened at ABA events {{there was}} a very noticeable fall in coverage of ABA Nationals by the BMX press. This was {{due to the lack of}} top tier pros and conflicting schedules with large purse NBL races and ESPN's Pro Spectacular events. For example, after covering the ABA Winter Nationals in depth in its June 1983 issue, BMX Plus! magazine did not cover a major ABA race for the rest of 1983 except the Grand National in its March 1984 issue. ABA races only warranted brief comment and the listings of race results in its [...] "Checkpoint" [...] section. This was an addition but unrelated effect of the boycott initiated by BMX Action, then the most respected BMX magazine. As noted, BMX Action's boycott started over perceived slights by the ABA when it noticed what it perceived as bad press by the magazine. With a large drop of coverage by the magazines, it became more difficult to get companies to sponsor ABA nationals, since the companies would not have the benefits of <b>indirect</b> <b>advertising</b> in the magazines.|$|E
2500|$|While BMX Action's {{deliberate}} boycott was damaging, {{it was not}} {{the only}} reason the ABA was receiving reduce coverage in the BMX press, including in BMX Action's biggest competitors BMX Plus! and Super BMX. Many ABA nationals coincided with important NBL nationals and considering there was an informal pro boycott of ABA nationals with the most prominent pros competing in the NBL and second tier sanctioning bodies like the United Bicycle Racers (UBR) and with those races were often scheduled on the same weekend as ABA events, the press followed. This led to a further decrease in coverage with the ABA events only getting one page, half page or even just a blurb in the [...] "Breaking News" [...] section of a major BMX publication, for instance BMX Plus! 's [...] "Check Point", which as previously mentioned due to lack of top pros at ABA events did not cover any ABA races in depth for eight months. The BMX industry noticed this of course. In consequence, there were fewer BMX and non-BMX companies willing to sponsor, i.e. invest in, ABA events with the fewer direct and <b>indirect</b> <b>advertising</b> possibilities like a race team and/or particular racer they were sponsoring having a win reported in detail or even a company banner appearing in the background of a photograph by happenstance that would be printed in a major BMX magazine. Those companies could not only stop sponsoring and co-sponsoring ABA races, but also stop sending their expensive race teams to ABA Nationals. Also, the rank and file non-sponsored BMX racers-the vast majority-could stop attending ABA events if they perceive a lack of press coverage and a lack of big name pros and amateurs they wanted to see and race against stop participating. The in house ABA Action newspaper was not enough since it was restricted to ABA members and therefore it had a limited audience in comparison to a newsstand magazine. The obvious solution afforded to the ABA was to create its own magazine. In 1982 Mennenga created Bicycles and Dirt to circumvent the established press and attract advertisers. The first issue of Bicycles and Dirt or BAD, premiered with the September 1982 issue. Contrary to Mennenga's expectations, advertisers did not flock to the new magazine, despite its built in audience. Like the newspaper ABA Action it was a subscription only magazine at the time. With this in mind the ABA put BAD on newsstands a year after its premier with Stu Thomsen on the cover of its September issue. It did not change the situation. The financial woes of BAD only grew worse and worse. However, instead of cutting one's losses after a few issues as most publishers would do, Mennenga continued to throw good money after bad and pump ABA funds into the ill-conceived and ill-executed venture. Eventually, it became clear to Mennenga that the ABA could not sustain the loss and there was no hope of a turnaround, and an agreement with BMX Action magazine cease publication as a condition to end its editorial boycott he folded Bicycles and Dirt with the September 1984 issue.|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT: Using {{subjects}} from Korea and the United States, this study reports {{the results of}} an experiment designed to discover links between national culture, self-construals, and the effectiveness of comparative advertising. First, the effect of national culture on comparative advertising effectiveness was investigated. Then, using self-consttuals as individuaJ-level variables in a path model, the study investigated their mediating effects on the influence of national culture on the effectiveness of comparative advertising. Results indicated not only that national culture influences tbe effectiveness of comparative advertising, but also that self-construals have mediating effects on attitudes toward the advertisement (A) for both <b>indirect</b> comparative <b>advertising</b> and noncomparative advertising. Thus, the study goes beyond the post hoc explanations that so many studies have used to link differences in the effectiveness of advertising to cultural variability, and thereby contributes to theory on the mediating effects of self-construals. The findings also have implications for advertising managerial practices and public policy on the regulation of advertising. But pethaps the main conttibution of the study is a research design using self-construals to demonstrate how individual-level variables can mediate the influence of national culture on advertising effectiveness.,, Despite differences in the use of comparative advertising from country co country, little research has been done to explain or predict the differences in the cross-cultural effectiveness o...|$|R

The alleged usages of tramadol had also contributed greatly to its popularity and massive use especially among Egyptian youth as a remedy for premature ejaculatory function and for extended orgasm and increase sexual pleasure as promoted through many online drug stores and media. 1 Aim of the workTo study the impact of tramadol and its increasing rates of drug abuse widely spread among Egyptian youth on the observed association with recently increasingly noted variable forms of aggression and accidents. Patients and methodsThis study was carried out on the patients who presented to (PCC-ASU) Hospitals, Egypt in the year 2010 (January–December). ResultsThe total number of studied cases was 640 with the adult (67. 9 %), males (77. 2 %). Abuse form of drug intake was the highest (50. 8 %). Oral intake (96. 8 %). The most frequent forms of injuries were cerebral edema (55. 9 %). ConclusionsThe significantly notable increasing violence forms {{are closely related to}} drug abuse. Tramadol’s prevalence is the mostly noted due to its wider availability and cheaper prices than other types of abused drugs. The unplanned <b>indirect</b> media <b>advertising</b> for tramadol abuse through movies and show series also played a remarkable role in promoting tramadol abuse.

40|$|Abstract Introduction Thailand {{ratified}} the World Health Organization (WHO) Framework Convention on Tobacco Control (FCTC) on November 8, 2004. The WHO FCTC requires {{all parties to}} inform all persons of the health consequences of tobacco consumption and exposure to tobacco smoke. Each party has agreed to develop, implement and evaluate effective tobacco control programs to measure progress in reaching {{the goals of the}} WHO FCTC. Methods The Global Youth Tobacco Survey (GYTS) was developed to provide data on youth tobacco use to countries for their development of youth-based tobacco control programs. Data in this report can be used as baseline measures for future evaluation of the tobacco control programs implemented by the Ministry of Public Health. Results Overall, about 1 in 10 Thai students are current smokers, this number including 4 times more boys than girls (17 % versus 3. 9 %). Almost 2 in 10 Thai students start smoking before the age of 10, and almost 7 in 10 students are reported to have been exposed to smoke from others in public places. About 4 in 10 students are reported to have an object with a cigarette brand logo on it. Conclusion The key for Thailand is to implement and enforce the provisions on <b>indirect</b> tobacco <b>advertising,</b> smoking in public places, selling tobacco to youths under 18 years of age, and to use the data from the GYTS to monitor progress toward achieving the goals of the WHO FCTC. When these goals are met, tobacco consumption and exposure in Thailand will have declined substantially. </p...|$|R

We seek to answer questions such as (1) What is the impact of pricing strategy (e. g., frequent temporary price cuts) on consumer brand choice probabilities in the lo ng run when there is quality uncertainty and when prices may signal quality? (2) Does intensive advertising in conjunction with increased price variability mitigate any adverse effects of frequent price cuts on perceived quality and, hence, on sales? (3) Does advertising reduce consumer perceived risk through direct information it provides about quality and/or serve as a quality signal and which has a higher impact on brand choice probabilities?

40|$|Aims: This paper aims to {{contribute}} to a rethink of marketing research priorities to address policy makers' evidence needs in relation to alcohol marketing. Method: Discussion paper reviewing evidence gaps identified during an appraisal of policy options to restrict alcohol marketing. Findings: Evidence requirements can be categorized as follows: (i) the size of marketing effects for the whole population and for policy-relevant population subgroups, (ii) the balance between immediate and long-term effects and the time lag, duration and cumulative build-up of effects and (iii) comparative effects of partial versus comprehensive marketing restrictions on consumption and harm. These knowledge gaps impede the appraisal and evaluation of existing and new interventions, because without understanding the size and timing of expected effects, researchers may choose inadequate time-frames, samples or sample sizes. To date, research has tended to rely on simplified models of marketing and has focused disproportionately on youth populations. The effects of cumulative exposure across multiple marketing channels, targeting of messages at certain population groups and <b>indirect</b> effects of <b>advertising</b> on consumption remain unclear. Conclusion: It is essential that studies into marketing effect sizes are geared towards informing policy decision-makers, anchored strongly in theory, use measures of effect that are well-justified and recognize fully the complexities of alcohol marketing efforts...|$|R

40|$|I {{consider}} {{the role of}} automatic psychological and neural processes in different settings. First, how does advertising affect consumer perceptions of a product? I assert {{that one of the}} ma jor mechanisms used in marketing is the creation of implicit associations among concepts. A neural network framework is adapted to model how these associations evolve and interact. Use of this formal model allows us to consider some of the <b>indirect</b> effects of <b>advertising,</b> particularly “spillover” and “dilution” effects where the advertisements for one product can help or harm ther perceptions of another. Second, I use fMRI to consider neural activation patterns during strategic thinking. Two studies reveal the possible importance of various neural areas to belief formation, strategic deception, and suspicion. The ﬁrst study focuses on the neural correlates of belief formation, particularly the difference between equilibrium and out-of-equilibrium decisions. We ﬁnd both neural activations and behavioral evidence that sub jects have relatively shallow belief processes, often apparently assigning too much agency to themselves, when they are out of equilibrium. The second study focuses on a bargaining interaction where a “buyer” has incentive to deceive a “seller” {{in order to get a}} low price for a hypothetical product.

The objective {{of this study is to}} analyse the appropriateness and quality of Internet advertising about HRT in Spain. Methods A search was carried out on the Internet (January 2009) using the eight best-selling HRT drugs in Spain. The brand name of each drug was entered into Google's search engine. The web sites appearing on the first page of results and the corresponding companies were analysed using the European Code of Good Practice as the reference point. Results Five corporate web pages: none of them included bibliographic references or measures to ensure that the advertising was only accessible by health professionals. Regarding non-corporate web pages (n = 27) : 41 % did not include the company name or address, 44 % made no distinction between patient and health professional information, 7 % contained bibliographic references, 26 % provided unspecific information for the use of HRT for osteoporosis and 19 % included menstrual cycle regulation or boosting feminity as an indication. Two online pharmacies sold HRT drugs which could be bought online in Spain, did not include the name or contact details of the registered company, nor did they stipulate the need for a medical prescription or differentiate between patient and health professional information.

40|$|It {{would seem}} that the present dry {{economic}} times impose a very precise focus for science in general and physics in particular: research, possibly of applied type. However in doing so two basic pillars of a healthy future for science are being undermined: fundamental research and public engagement. The first is what makes applications possible in the first place, many times with a path from inception to implementation that is as long and <b>indirect</b> as poorly <b>advertised.</b> The second pillar, public engagement, is mostly regarded as a commodity: if there is good level of funding scientists can consider spending money for public relations otherwise this is the first thing scientists cut because it is the least necessary. On the contrary, public engagement in science is very much needed, at the very least because the public is either an enemy or an ally, as testified respectively by the climate change denial and the 2009 Shuttle mission that people wanted in order to service the Hubble Space Telescope for the last time.

Many ABA nationals coincided with important NBL nationals and considering there was an informal pro boycott of ABA nationals with the most prominent pros competing in the NBL and second tier sanctioning bodies like the United Bicycle Racers (UBR) and with those races were often scheduled on the same weekend as ABA events, the press followed. This led to a further decrease in coverage with the ABA events only getting one page, half page or even just a blurb in the [...] "Breaking News" [...] section of a major BMX publication, for instance BMX Plus! 's [...] "Check Point", which as previously mentioned due to lack of top pros at ABA events did not cover any ABA races in depth for eight months. The BMX industry noticed this of course. In consequence, there were fewer BMX and non-BMX companies willing to sponsor, i.e. invest in, ABA events with the fewer direct and <b>indirect</b> <b>advertising</b> possibilities like a race team and/or particular racer they were sponsoring having a win reported in detail or even a company banner appearing in the background of a photograph by happenstance that would be printed in a major BMX magazine. Those companies could not only stop sponsoring and co-sponsoring ABA races, but also stop sending their expensive race teams to ABA Nationals. Also, the rank and file non-sponsored BMX racers-the vast majority-could stop attending ABA events if they perceive a lack of press coverage and a lack of big name pros and amateurs they wanted to see and race against stop participating. The in house ABA Action newspaper was not enough since it was restricted to ABA members and therefore it had a limited audience in comparison to a newsstand magazine. The obvious solution afforded to the ABA was to create its own magazine. In 1982 Mennenga created Bicycles and Dirt to circumvent the established press and attract advertisers. The first issue of Bicycles and Dirt or BAD, premiered with the September 1982 issue. Contrary to Mennenga's expectations, advertisers did not flock to the new magazine, despite its built in audience. Like the newspaper ABA Action it was a subscription only magazine at the time. With this in mind the ABA put BAD on newsstands a year after its premier with Stu Thomsen on the cover of its September issue. It did not change the situation. The financial woes of BAD only grew worse and worse. However, instead of cutting one's losses after a few issues as most publishers would do, Mennenga continued to throw good money after bad and pump ABA funds into the ill-conceived and ill-executed venture. Eventually, it became clear to Mennenga that the ABA could not sustain the loss and there was no hope of a turnaround, and an agreement with BMX Action magazine cease publication as a condition to end its editorial boycott he folded Bicycles and Dirt with the September 1984 issue.|$|E

40|$|Background Direct-to-consumer {{advertising}} (DTCA) {{of prescription}} medicines is prohibited in Australia, but pharmaceutical companies can {{provide information about}} the health condition for which they manufacture a prescription product – {{commonly referred to as}} disease awareness advertising (DAA). The pharmaceutical industry purports that DAA provides education regarding health conditions and different treatment options, and may encourage early diagnosis and treatment. However consumer and public health advocates are concerned that DAA has the potential to inflate the perceived prevalence of disease, increase consumer anxiety, and result in unnecessary visits to doctors. They believe it provides an <b>indirect</b> method of <b>advertising</b> prescription medicines to consumers, and has the potential to increase the uptake of newer medicines whose risk profiles are not fully understood. While studies overseas have demonstrated that DAA can increase consultations regarding the advertised disease, as well as prescriptions for the advertiser’s product, there has been no research conducted in Australia regarding DAA, or consumers’ attitudes toward this form of advertising. Method This research project examined recent cases of pharmaceutical industry-sponsored DAA in Australia, and undertook a content analysis of advertisements in popular women’s magazines. To determine how Australian consumers perceive DAA, and how this compared to their perceptions of DTCA, a survey was conducted using matched DAA and DTCA as stimuli. General attitudes to DAA were compared with results from a similar study conducted in New Zealand exploring attitudes to DTCA. Finally, an intercept survey explored attitudes of older Australian women towards hypothetical DAA for two health conditions. Sponsor logos and the amount of disease information were manipulated in the advertisement stimuli. Results Pharmaceutical companies use a range of persuasive techniques in DAA, and while the name of the product is not included, other branding techniques, such as spokescharacters and campaign names, may convey the identity of the product. The most common type of information found in DAA in popular Australian women’s magazines (which included advertisements sponsored by government and non-profit organisations) was treatment information, and industry advertisements more often provided information about treatment and prevalence. In the survey research, despite pharmaceutical company branding on the DAA stimuli, most participants did not attribute a direct commercial intent (to sell a treatment or product) to the advertisements. They perceived the advertisements were designed to provide information and to make them more proactive about their health. Similar to New Zealand consumers considering DTCA, Australian consumers valued DAA for the information it provides about health conditions and treatment options; however they may have been considering DAA sponsored by government and/or non-profit organisations. Participants perceived DAA to be useful in discussions with their doctor, but were ambivalent as to whether it helped them in making health decisions. Following exposure to DAA stimuli, most participants agreed that they would talk about the condition with their doctor or talk about a treatment with their doctor, and up to half expressed an intention to ask for a prescription or referral. In the intercept survey, older women exposed to advertisements with less disease information {{were less likely to be}} satisfied that adequate information was provided, but were more likely to express an intention to ask their doctor for a prescription or a referral. Discussion The results suggest that DAA, particularly advertisements with limited disease information, can stimulate demand for prescription medicines. Despite purporting an educational function, most industry DAA focus on treatment information and many utilise persuasive techniques which may convey the identity of the product. This has implications for regulators of pharmaceutical advertising in Australia, as activities which encourage patients to seek a prescription for a specific product are prohibited. The results demonstrate the commercial intent (and potential commercial success) of industry DAA. However, it is concerning that most consumers (our research indicates up to 90 %) do not recognise this intent, and they may be less critical in evaluating advertisements. While consumers value the information provided in DAA, many advertisements fail to provide detailed or comprehensive disease information. The regulation of DAA requires strengthening, with specific recommendations regarding the amount and breadth of disease information to be included...|$|R
40|$|This study {{utilised}} semi-structured {{interviews to}} investigate how women expecting a first baby perceived print advertisements for 2 ̆ 7 toddler milks 2 ̆ 7 {{in order to}} determine whether they function as <b>indirect</b> <b>advertising</b> for infant and follow-on formula. Examination of the marketing literature, analysis of the advertisers 2 ̆ 7 websites and the advertisements themselves provided sources of triangulation. Fifteen women expecting a first baby were recruited from antenatal classes conducted by staff of the Northern Sydney Central Coast Area Health Service. These respondents clearly understood toddler milk advertisements to be promoting a range of products that included infant and follow-on formula and accepted their claims quite uncritically. These claims contradicted public health messages about breastfeeding and the evidence of health risks associated with formula feeding. Toddler milk advertisements appear to function as <b>indirect</b> <b>advertising</b> for infant and follow-on formula. The Marketing in Australia of Infant Formula: Manufacturers 2 ̆ 7 and Importers 2 ̆ 7 Agreement is failing to protect the Australian community from the advertising of breastmilk substitutes as required by World Health Assembly Resolution 33. 47, the International Code of Marketing of Breastmilk Substitutes.

40|$|BACKGROUND: The aim of {{this study}} is to {{introduce}} the uncommonly used Co-Plot method which is called the multivariate graphical analysis and to apply this method to a data set including tobacco control in European region. METHODS: This study uses the data from the World Health Organization database according to Human Development Index of European countries. It takes into account variables such as smoking prevalence in young people and adults, the proportion of smoking-related deaths and domestic legislations cases pertaining to tobacco products and analyses the data using the Co-Plot method. RESULTS: Results of the study demonstrated that smoking prevalence and restrictions on advertising of tobacco products were highly negatively correlated. The proportion of deaths associated with smoking-related diseases increased parallel to the increase in the smoking prevalence in young people and adults. Norway, France and Finland have enforced legal limitations on direct and <b>indirect</b> <b>advertising,</b> and thus there has been a decline in smoking prevalence among young people and adults. In some countries, including Ireland, Italy and Serbia, the prevalence of smoking among the young has decreased due to the new or increased legal restrictions on the sale distribution of tobacco products. The governments in the Czech Republic, Kazakhstan, Estonia, Croatia, the Netherlands, Belgium, and Poland have placed restrictions on direct and <b>indirect</b> <b>advertising.</b> The distribution of other causes-related deaths and lung cancer-related deaths are high. CONCLUSION: The restrictions on tobacco products were tightened in time with the increased prevalence of smoking and proportion of smoking-related deaths. It can be said that the significant relationships identified in this study have even more pertinence in developed countries. Consequently, Co-Plot method has enabled deeper data interpretations of the relationships between the countries and the variables in this study...|$|E
