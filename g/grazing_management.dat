Such prophylaxis includes feeding a pelleted psyllium for one week every 4–5 weeks. Longer duration of treatment will result in gastrointestinal flora changes and the psyllium to be broken down and ineffective for sand clearance. Other methods include feeding the horse before turnout, and turning the horses {{out in the middle of}} the day so they are more likely to stand in the shade rather than graze.|$|E

[...] In 1989, the Whitehorse Ranch agreed to rest two grazing allotments totaling [...] to restore critical stream greenways and mountain pastures. [...] The ranch's allotment on Fifteen Mile Creek was rested for three years, and its Willow Creek pasture received a five-year rest before grazing was resumed. [...] In addition, the grazing season in mountain pastures was reduced from four months to two, and {{the total number of}} cattle released in the allotment areas was reduced from 3,800 to 2,200. [...] Finally, sensitive areas were fenced to protect them from cattle, and additional water sources were constructed away from streams. Other ranches also agreed to rest specific pastures including the Trout Creek, Cottonwood Creek, and Whitehorse Butte allotments.|$|E

30|$|Another notable {{reason for}} the {{decrease}} in the daily average grazing time, mentioned by 89 [*]% of the study participants, is the prohibition of transboundary grazing, as we have already noted. When asked about how grazing was managed {{in the past to}} ensure sustainable rangeland regeneration, 90 [*]% answered that they grazed across borders and boundaries. This practice was a natural (hima-like) protection and <b>graze</b> <b>management</b> system where herders moved from place to place based on a collective understanding of where not to graze each year.

500|$|Unlike most Banksia species, B.integrifolia {{does not}} require bushfire to trigger the release of its seed. Rather, seed is {{released}} spontaneously on reaching maturity in late summer. The species' non-reliance on fire for seed dispersal suggests that the exclusion of fire would not affect plant populations, {{but a number of}} studies have found the opposite to be true: in areas where fire has been excluded for many years, populations have declined substantially. An investigation into the defoliation and premature death of trees on the Yanakie Isthmus in south Victoria reached the tentative conclusion that the absence of fire had created unhealthy surface soil conditions. On the Mornington Peninsula, surveys of an area that had not been burnt since the 1890s found that B.integrifolia densities fell by 77% between 1977 and 2000. A subsequent study found the decline to have been caused by extremely high seedling mortality rates, due to grazing by herbivores and intense competition for soil moisture during summer. Despite acknowledging that [...] "the role of fire in these systems remains unclear", it concluded that [...] "developing fire and/or <b>grazing</b> <b>management</b> regimes will be necessary to conserve the structural integrity of these coastal ecosystems." ...|$|E
2500|$|Once {{belonging}} to the Lost River Ranch lease, the land that now comprises the Milk River Natural Area was grazed infrequently and was therefore deleted from the grazing lease under the Public Lands Act in 1978 and 1979. Some resource exploration has occurred {{over the years and}} several wells were drilled but have subsequently been abandoned. Coal was also briefly mined but due to the area's remoteness was also abandoned. The Milk River Natural Area and Kennedy Coulee Ecological Reserve were established with the intent [...] "to protect and maintain the ecological and aesthetic character of a representative example of the Mixed Grassland Natural Region with minimal human interference;" [...] specifically, protecting ecological diversity and processes, native species and habitats, rare and significant natural features, recreation, education, and scientific research. Management interference is intended to be minimal and [...] "let nature take its course" [...] wherever possible, while managing some ecological processes such as fires and controlled grazing. A balance of grazing regimes is important to maintain the combination of short and medium grasses defining the dry mixedgrass natural subregion. Cattle do not graze {{in the same way as}} the now-extirpated bison did, but have been used to simulate natural processes. <b>Grazing</b> <b>management</b> maintains the grassland ecosystem in its climax state, but overgrazing must be avoided to prevent soil erosion and loss of biodiversity. Rangeland health assessments aid this goal by periodically evaluating the area's ecosystem health, including measuring factors such as grazing intensity, weed occurrence, species composition, site stability, and soil and plant health. The 2011 rangeland survey concluded that the Milk River Natural Area overall is in excellent health and meeting its management goals, and that plant community health and <b>grazing</b> <b>management</b> were found to be far exceeding provincial standards.|$|E
2500|$|Savory {{developed}} a flexible management {{system designed to}} improve grazing systems. Holistic planned grazing {{is one of a}} number of newer <b>grazing</b> <b>management</b> systems that more closely simulate the behavior of natural herds of wildlife and have been shown to improve riparian habitats and water quality over systems that often led to land degradation, and be an effective tool to improve range condition for both livestock and wildlife. Holistic planned grazing is similar to rotational grazing but differs in that it more explicitly recognizes and provides a framework for adapting to the four basic ecosystem processes: the water cycle, the mineral cycle including the carbon cycle, energy flow, and community dynamics (the relationship between organisms in an ecosystem) as equal in importance to livestock production and social welfare. Thus the holistic context in the planning stage leads to different decisions in dealing with that complexity.

Each group was then subdivided and grazed on pastures that allowed high (h) or low (l) weights gains. Experiment 2 allowed heifers of the same type to achieve continuous high weight gains and served as a control.

The objective {{of this study was}} to evaluate the physical and chemical quality of a Inceptisol after 30 years under two <b>grazing</b> <b>managements.</b> The study was conducted in a watershed located in the Upper Rio Grande (MG) in two types of extensive <b>grazing</b> <b>managements</b> common in the region: native pasture without burning native pasture and annual managed with annual burning, and a legal reserve area used as a reference. These areas were analyzed: CTCpH 7, 0, organic matter, soil density and porosity. According to the results obtained it was concluded that the values of bulk density, organic matter, cation exchange capacity and macro porosity did not differ in the analyzed soil layer (0 - 20 cm) in two management studies. The polygons formed in the radial graph, comparing the reference area with the two management studies, are of different magnitude and the shape formed by the reference values, indicating that the annual burning without management should be improved in relation to the density of the soil, whereas the management with annual fires should be improved in relation to the density, organic matter, cation exchange capacity and soil macroporosity.

We performed a long-term experiment in Eldorado do Sul, southern Brazil, that assessed three levels of grazing pressure: high pressure (HP), with 4 % herbage allowance (HA), moderate pressure (MP), with 12 % HA, and low pressure (LP), with 16 % HA. Two reference areas were also assessed, one of never-grazed native vegetation (NG) and another of regenerated vegetation after two years of grazing (RG). Soil samples were evaluated for microbial biomass and enzymatic (&# 946;-glucosidase, arylsulfatase and urease) activities. The structure of the bacterial community and the population of diazotrophic bacteria were evaluated by RFLP of the 16 S rRNA and nifH genes, respectively. The diversity of diazotrophic bacteria was assessed by partial sequencing of the 16 S rDNA gene. The presence of grazing animals increased soil microbial biomass in MP and HP.
