5000|$|... #Subtitle level 3: The Need for <b>Impact</b> <b>Socket</b> Wrenches in Global Industry ...|$|E
50|$|A {{hydraulic}} {{torque wrench}} {{is a power}} tool designed to exert torque on a fastener to achieve proper tightening or loosening of a connection {{through the use of}} hydraulics. A torque wrench is applied to the nut either directly or in conjunction with an <b>impact</b> <b>socket.</b> Hydraulic torque wrenches apply a predetermined, controlled amount of torque to a properly lubricated fastener.|$|E
50|$|An <b>impact</b> <b>socket</b> wrench is a {{cylindrical}} shaped tool with {{a female}} opening to fit over a nut or bolt head, and is most commonly 6-point hexagonal shaped; generally used with the assist of a power tool such as an Impact wrench or hydraulic torque wrench. Sizes range from the very small, to massive sizes weighing hundreds of pounds each. Impact sockets typically connect with the driving tool {{by way of a}} male to female square drive connection (or less commonly a spline drive connection). The use of power tools and ratchet wrenches with sockets makes tightening and removing bolts incredibly easy over alternative methods like combination wrenches and other manual methods.|$|E
50|$|IMPERIAL-Newton Corporation is an American {{company that}} {{manufactures}} custom and specialized <b>impact</b> <b>sockets,</b> socket wrench {{and other large}} bolt equipment utilized for large heavy industrial applications.|$|R
5000|$|Many {{applications}} use {{air driven}} or {{electric impact wrench}} or impact driver to deliver the amount of shock and torque required to tighten or loosen the different bolts or nuts in use. Inside an impact wrench there is a rotating hammer, usually driven by electricity or air pressure, {{that is used to}} incrementally rotate the output shaft. The impact wrench is designed to deliver high torque output with minimal exertion by the user, by storing energy in a rotating mass, then delivering it suddenly to the output shaft via a hammering action. While typical impact wrenches deliver between 500 and 1500 ft-lbs of torque, some larger impact wrenches such as the Ingersoll Rand 599A1 can deliver near 80,000 ft-lb (10850 Nm) of torque which is enough to tighten hex nuts 7" [...] across flats. Even if the socket attached to the impact wrench does not turn, it is still subjected to successive shock blows by the impact wrench's internal hammer(s). These successive blows are often enough to loosen or tighten a tight or corroded nut or bolt or in some cases break or strip the fastener. Impact wrenches are hard on the sockets since the sockets in use also get hammered. Regular chrome plated [...] "hand sockets" [...] like those commonly included with hand ratchet wrench tool sets are not suitable for this kind of high load <b>impact</b> application. Hand <b>sockets,</b> when used with an impact wrench, can break or shatter explosively if they are used with an <b>impact</b> wrench. <b>Impact</b> <b>sockets</b> are specifically designed and manufactured for impact gun use, and are nearly always made from a thicker, tougher and more ductile alloy steel that is then heat treated for extra durability. Most <b>impact</b> <b>sockets</b> made for [...] "standard" [...] hexagonal fasteners have a six-point design. For more flexibility many <b>impact</b> <b>sockets</b> are made with swivel type socketâ€”socket wrench attachment geometry. These <b>impact</b> <b>sockets</b> are rarely, if ever, chrome-plated, as chrome will chip off under impact use, and the process of chrome plating hardened steel causes some hydrogen embrittlement which can cause parts to crack. Instead, <b>impact</b> <b>sockets</b> are most commonly finished with a black oxide surface or other conversion treatment to provide some corrosion and rust protection and improved appearance even after hard impact wrench use. Although ordinary hand sockets should never be used with <b>impact</b> wrenches, <b>impact</b> <b>sockets</b> can be used with hand socket wrenches and other hand drivers.|$|R
5000|$|A socket wrench, {{with the}} correct type of socket, {{can be used to}} loosen or tighten a large variety of {{fasteners}} with lower cost, greater ease and often more torque than can be applied with a screwdriver handle. A common use of these different [...] "screw" [...] head type sockets is to attach to power versions of the <b>socket</b> wrenches (<b>impact</b> <b>sockets)</b> which allow the fasteners to be loosened or tightened much faster and more powerfully than can be done by hand.|$|R
50|$|Socket wrench showcases in unique sizes. There's a great {{demand for}} <b>impact</b> <b>socket</b> {{wrenches}} across the world. The ordinary man needs them to repair, assemble or maintain equipment. The US Department of Defense and the US Department of Energy need them, {{as well as}} the Army Corps of Engineers. The global Aerospace community and large industries such as electric power generation, chemical production and mining also need them. Rail car operators need them, as do owners of large equipment with special shapes or unusual sizes and depths. This is exactly where IMPERIAL-Newton Corporation comes in. The company manufactures a uniquely and purposefully large and diverse range of shapes, alloys, sizes and depths of impact sockets which are unique in the marketplace of tools; and intended strictly for industrial usage.|$|E
50|$|IMPERIAL-Newton Corporation {{was founded}} in 2002 in Southern California in {{response}} to the need for professionally made custom and specialty <b>impact</b> <b>sockets</b> and wrenches for governmental agencies, aerospace and large equipment manufacturers seeking tools based on international consensus standards, rather than homemade welded up scraps of metal and guesswork. In 2009 the company relocated its headquarters to the State of Colorado, transferring nearly all operations to the greater Denver, CO metro area. The company selected the Denver Technological Center (DTC) region of Colorado as its headquarters for the same predilections which compel so many other notable and industry leading firms to call DTC their home. Operational benefits and tax incentives, combined with the naturally enjoyable climate, improved cost of living, generally active lifestyle and amazing scenery it offers employees made it an attractive headquarters choice over other areas.|$|R
5000|$|There are {{two main}} types of <b>socket</b> wrenches: <b>impact</b> <b>sockets</b> and hand sockets. Common sockets are colloquially {{referred}} to by {{counting the number of}} [...] "points" [...] (pointed corners of walls) present {{in the shape of the}} socket nut opening. For example, the hexagon shape is commonly called a [...] "6 point" [...] socket because the hexagon forms 6 [...] "points" [...] where walls intersect to create six sharp pointed corners. This system of description using [...] "points" [...] generally works well in avoiding confusion, with the exception of [...] "8-point" [...] and [...] "12-point" [...] where two very incompatible shapes exist with both having 8 [...] "points" [...] and 12 [...] "points". The vast majority of larger common nut and bolt heads are produced with the 6-point hexagonal gripping shape. Less frequently used shapes include the square 4-point, triple square 12-point (not to be confused with 12-point double hexagon), octagonal 8-point (not to be confused with the more common 8-point double square shape). These less common shapes are typically found in special applications or particular industries such as aircraft, PVC plumbing fittings or German and UK made automobiles. With rail cars, valve adjustment screws and pipe plugs the 4-point square shaped driver can still be found in wide use both male and female configurations. Nuts and bolt heads are also produced in 12-point double hexagon shapes and various types of splines more common to aircraft and aerospace applications. Most manufacturers of sockets for larger bolts produce them in 6-point (hexagonal) and limited sizes of 12-point (double-hexagonal) configurations.|$|R
5000|$|Due to the {{twisting}} or cam {{action of the}} socket on a bolt or nut head, {{nearly all of the}} torque is applied at or near the corners of the nut or bolt. Whether one uses either a twelve or six point socket the same stresses are applied in the same locations. Under load, nearly all of the flats of the nut are not touching the socket at all, it is only a small amount of the surfaces near the fastener corners which bears the torque loads. In nearly all applications over-stressing a bolt or nut will result in stripping the bolt or nut threads or breaking the bolt long before the socket will break. Tougher, thicker <b>impact</b> <b>sockets</b> are made for impact gun use. Occasionally when the corners of a bolt head or nut begin to become worn or damaged, the material the nut is made from can eventually smear or tear under load and create a situation where the corners are effectively [...] "rounded off". Some socket users believe that six point sockets are less likely to damage a fastener head, but tool evaluations and lab tests document that there is no difference in performance. A distorted or corroded fastener head may not fit a six-point socket but a twelve-point socket can be made to fit. When a fastener head is [...] "rounded off" [...] the nut or bolt can often no longer be turned without special repair or extraction tools. These rounded-off heads can incur substantial penalties, both direct and indirect. Deteriorated fasteners often inhibit the routine assembly and disassembly of the host components that rely on them, which can in turn deter users from performing normal maintenance procedures. Addressing the problem may require cost and effort, and potentially sidelining valuable equipment until the component's damaged fasteners have been replaced.|$|R
5000|$|On 22 May 2010, Air India Express Flight 812, a Boeing 737-800 VT-AXV, {{flying on}} the Dubai-Mangalore route, {{overshot}} the 8033 ft runway number 06/24, killing 158 people, including 6 crew; only 8 survived. The aircraft crashed when it overshot the runway and veered into a steep gorge {{at the end}} of the runway. The starboard wing <b>impacted</b> the concrete <b>socket</b> of the instrument landing system (ILS) localiser antenna, rendering it unusable. This resulted in delayed or cancelled flights for two weeks during the monsoon rains, which reduced visibility. It took the airport a little under a month to repair and calibrate the ILS and bring it back online.|$|R
40|$|The {{aim was to}} {{investigate}} how impacted third molar surgery, as psychophysical and operative trauma; influence the response of blood fibrinolytic system. Examined group included 50 healthy subjects with impacted third molars and 45 subjects, blood donors, as a control group. Influence of the operative interventions over parameters of blood fibrinolytic system (t-Pa and PAI- 1) were examined prior the procedures and immediately after. Values of blood pressure and pulse were notified to evident physical reflections of the stress. Clinical outcome after first, second and seventh day included changes like edema, hematoma, pain and dry <b>socket.</b> <b>Impacted</b> third molar surgery, as a stress factor, had influence and affects the fibrinolysis through the effect upon the pro-activators and inhibitors of the fibrinolytic system, and {{the severity of the}} clinical outcome after operative third molar surgery. Parameters of fibrinolytic system - t-PA and PAI- 1 can be the most sensitive markers of reaction to oral surgical stress. Key words: impacted third molar, oral surgery, fibrinolytic system, stress. ...|$|R
5000|$|As {{the output}} of an impact wrench, when hammering, is a very short impact force, the actual {{effective}} torque is difficult to measure, with several different ratings in use. As the tool delivers a fixed amount of energy with each blow, rather than a fixed torque, the actual output torque changes with {{the duration of the}} output pulse. If the output is springy or capable of absorbing energy, the impulse will simply be absorbed, and virtually no torque will ever be applied, and somewhat counter-intuitively, if the object is very springy, the wrench may actually turn backwards as the energy is delivered back to the anvil, while it is not connected to the hammer and able to spin freely. [...] A wrench that is capable of freeing a rusted nut on a very large bolt may be incapable of turning a small screw mounted on a spring. [...] "Maximum torque" [...] is the number most often given by manufacturers, which is the instantaneous peak torque delivered if the anvil is locked into a perfectly solid object. [...] "Working torque" [...] is a more realistic number for continually driving a very stiff fastener. [...] "Nut-busting torque" [...] is often quoted, with the usual definition being that the wrench can loosen a nut tightened with the specified amount of torque in some specified time period. Accurately controlling the output torque of an impact wrench is very difficult, and even an experienced operator will have a hard time making sure a fastener is not undertightened or overtightened using an <b>impact</b> wrench. Special <b>socket</b> extensions are available, which take advantage of the inability of an impact wrench to work against a spring, to precisely limit the output torque. Designed with spring steel, they act as large torsion springs, flexing at their torque rating, and preventing any further torque from being applied to the fastener. Some impact wrenches designed for product assembly have a built-in torque control system, such as a built-in torsion spring and a mechanism that shuts the tool down when the given torque is exceeded. When very precise torque is required, an impact wrench is only used to snug down the fastener, with a torque wrench used for the final tightening. Due to the lack of standards when measuring the maximum torque, some manufacturers are believed to inflate their ratings, or to use measurements with little bearing on how the tool will perform in actual use. Many air impact wrenches incorporate a flow regulator into their design, either as a separate control or part of the reversing valve, allowing torque to be roughly limited in one or both directions, while electric tools may use a variable speed trigger for the same effect.|$|R
