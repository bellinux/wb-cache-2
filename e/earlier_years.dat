40|$|Purpose – The {{purpose of}} the paper is to {{consider}} the opportunities and difficulties in developing health-promotion work in <b>early</b> <b>years</b> settings in the UK. Design/methodology/approach – As the first study of its kind conducted in the UK, a multi-method approach was adopted involving: an overview of health-related guidance and of effective interventions in <b>early</b> <b>years</b> settings to promote health among young children; 26 interviews with key informants in the <b>early</b> <b>years</b> and health fields, regional coordinators for the National Healthy Schools Programme (NHSP) and Foundation Stage regional advisers; a survey of 145 local Healthy Schools Programme coordinators with {{a response rate of}} 75 per cent; and six case studies of <b>early</b> <b>years</b> settings representing promising practice in the promotion of health and wellbeing. Findings – There is considerable enthusiasm for health promotion work within <b>early</b> <b>years</b> organisations, and interest in developing such work in <b>early</b> <b>years</b> settings. The study suggests that building on existing <b>early</b> <b>years</b> curriculum frameworks, developing partnerships between health and <b>early</b> <b>years</b> professionals, engaging both parents and practitioners, and adequate national and local resourcing will facilitate development of health promoting work in the <b>early</b> <b>years</b> sector. Practical implications – This paper and the outputs from the study offer useful evidence for health and <b>early</b> <b>years</b> professionals who are developing health-promoting work in <b>early</b> <b>years</b> settings. Originality/value – The paper reports on the first study of its kind in which the perceptions of both <b>early</b> <b>years</b> and health professionals are brought together to consider the issues involved in developing healthy <b>early</b> <b>years</b> practice...|$|R

5|$|By the 1940s, the Texas Railroad Commission, {{which had}} been given {{regulatory}} control of the Texas oil industry, managed to stabilize American oil production and eliminate most of the wild price swings that were common during the <b>earlier</b> <b>years</b> of the boom. Many small towns, such as Wortham, which had become boomtowns during the 1920s saw their booms end in the late 1920s and early 1930s as their local economies collapsed, resulting from their dependence on relatively limited petroleum reservoirs. As production peaked {{in some of these}} smaller fields and the Great Depression lowered demand, investors fled. In the major refining and manufacturing centers such as Beaumont, Houston, and Dallas, the boom continued to varying degrees until the end of World War II. By the end of the war, the economies of the major urban areas of the state had matured. Though Texas continued to prosper and grow, the extreme growth patterns and dramatic socioeconomic changes of the <b>earlier</b> <b>years</b> largely subsided as the cities settled into more sustainable patterns of growth. Localized booms in West Texas and other areas, however, continued to transform some small communities during the post-war period.|$|E
