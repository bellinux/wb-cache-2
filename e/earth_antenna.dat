50|$|In a major {{departure}} from previous GPS designs, the M-code {{is intended to}} be broadcast from a high-gain directional antenna, in addition to a wide angle (full <b>Earth)</b> <b>antenna.</b> The directional antenna's signal, termed a spot beam, {{is intended to be}} aimed at a specific region (i.e., several hundred kilometers in diameter) and increase the local signal strength by 20 dB (10× voltage field strength, 100× power). A side effect of having two antennas is that, for receivers inside the spot beam, the GPS satellite will appear to be two GPS satellites occupying the same position.|$|E
40|$|Landsat 7 must be slewed {{so that it}} is {{pointing}} at a ground station in order for recorded science or telemetry data to be downlinked to <b>earth.</b> <b>Antenna</b> slewing on Landsat 7 has been shown to occasionally cause a slight vibration to the satellite, which in turn might aect the quality of the image taken by the scanning instrument if the scanner is in use during slewing. Consequently, it is preferable for the slewing activity not to overlap any scanning activity, although because the detrimental eect on image quality occurs only intermittently, this disjointness is best not expressed as a hard constraint. This {{is only one of the}} many real world problems that can be cast and, under certain assumptions, solved in our framework. Reasoning simultaneously with hard temporal constraints and preferences, as illustrated in the example just given, is crucial in many situations. However, in many temporal reasoning problems it is dicult or impossible to specify a local preference on durations. I...|$|E

40|$|The authors {{will report}} on a small lunar relay {{satellite}} concept, capable of fitting in a Minotaur V launch vehicle, to provide communication and navigation (C 2 ̆ 6 N) services to users on the moon. Ultimately, the C 2 ̆ 6 N system will provide multiple fixed and mobile users, human and robotic, with service from launch to lunar landing and throughout occupation. In order to provide complete coverage for users on the moon, a constellation of relay satellites will ultimately be required. In the near term, however, the relays will focus on certain important locations, particularly the South Polar region, where water may be located and early landings may occur. These locations are only visible from <b>Earth</b> <b>antennas</b> for 14 days of each 28 day time period, requiring a relay satellite to fill the gaps. One alternative for this satellite is a small, less costly lunar relay capable of launching on the relatively inexpensive Minotaur class of launch vehicles, the Minotaur V in particular.

40|$|Approved {{for public}} release, {{distribution}} is unlimited. This thesis investigates {{the performance of}} various configurations of tactical High Frequency (HF) field deployable antennas {{in the presence of}} lossy <b>earth.</b> <b>Antennas</b> investigated include horizontal dipoles, short sloping wires, inverted vees, and monopoles with buried and elevated radials. Numerical models of the antennas are exercised via the Numerical Electromagnetic Code (NEC) for radiation pattern performance. Antennas are analyzed for applicability to (1) short-range Near Vertical Incident Skywave (NVIS), where high elevation radiation angles are required, (2) medium- and long-range low radiation angle use, and (3) vertically polarized low-angle radiation for ground wave communication. Good NVIS and ground wave performance occurs for horizontal dipoles. Sloping wires and sloping dipoles are similar to horizontal dipoles but exhibit a moderate amount of azimuth plane directivity. Vertical monopoles with at least 15 buried radials produce medium- and long-range skyware coverage and good ground wave performance. Four elevated radials for quarter-wavelength monopoles are shown to out-perform 15 buried radials and are much easier to erect. The larger and more difficult-to-erect inverted vee dipole slightly outperforms a monopole by virtue of modest azimuth plane directivity. The results of this study can be included in an antenna engineering handbook and can be used to interface with existing ionospheric propagation codes in order to obtain optimum communication effectiveness.

40|$|The {{communication}} {{switching system}} enables the universal connectivity. The universal connectivity is realized when any entity {{in one part}} of the world can communicate with any other entity in another part of the world. In many ways telecommunication will acts as a substitute for the increasingly expensive physical transportation. The telecommunication links and switching were mainly designed for voice communication. With the appropriate attachments/equipments, they can be used to transmit data. A modern society, therefore needs new facilities including very high bandwidth switched data networks, and large communication satellites with small, cheap <b>earth</b> <b>antennas.</b> Speed and size are two important factors while designing the electronic system.
