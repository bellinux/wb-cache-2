25|$|In 1986, Hewlett-Packard {{introduced}} the HP-18C calculator and HP82240A thermo printer, which internally used an extended {{variant of the}} 1985 revision of the 8-bit HPRoman-8 character set (now with the six additional characters defined and with codepoint 228 already changed to an eth (ð)), but with the codepoints 127 (0x7F) and 160 (0xA0) {{as well as the}} control codes in the range 128 to 159 (0x80 to 0x9F) being replaced by additional <b>displayable</b> characters. On the HP-28 series, characters above 147 (0x93) could not be displayed on the calculator, only be printed.|$|E
25|$|Tone mapping is a {{technique}} used in image processing and computer graphics to map one set of colors to another to approximate the appearance of high-dynamic-range images in a medium that has a more limited dynamic range. Print-outs, CRT or LCD monitors, and projectors all have a limited dynamic range that is inadequate to reproduce {{the full range of}} light intensities present in natural scenes. Tone mapping addresses the problem of strong contrast reduction from the scene radiance to the <b>displayable</b> range while preserving the image details and color appearance important to appreciate the original scene content.|$|E
25|$|This {{changed with}} the {{introduction}} of the HP82240B printer in 1989 and the HP48 series in 1990, which came with a new character set now based on ECMA94/ ISO8859-1 instead of HPRoman-8, but with the control codes in the range 128 to 159 (0x80 to 0x9F) being replaced by additional <b>displayable</b> characters. Compared to ISO8859-1, codepoint 127 (0x7F) showed a medium shaded gray box like in the former HPRoman-8 based character set. Code points 131 (0x83) to 142 (0x8E) were also taken over from the former HPRoman-8 based character set. In addition to this, codepoint 31 (0x1F) was used for ellipsis (…) and codepoints 169 (0xA9) and 174 (0xAE) showed ambiguous glyphs which could be viewed as inverse circled numbers ❸ or copyright (©) and as ❷ or registered trademark (®), respectively. This first version of the character set also had a non-breaking space at position 160 (0xA0).|$|E

2500|$|The RPL {{character}} set is an 8-bit {{character set}} and encoding used by most RPL calculators manufactured by Hewlett-Packard {{as well as}} by the HP82240B thermo printer. It is sometimes referred to simply as [...] "ECMA-94" [...] in documentation, although it is for the most part a superset of ISO 8859-1 / ECMA-94 in terms of printable characters, and it differs from ISO-8859-1 by using <b>displayable</b> characters rather than control characters in the 0x80 to 0x9F range of code points.|$|E

This function will map the luminance Vin in the domain [...] to a <b>displayable</b> output range of [...] While this filter provides a decent contrast for parts of the image with low luminance (particularly when [...] ), parts of the image with higher luminance will get increasingly lower contrast as the luminance of the filtered image goes to 1.|$|E
6000|$|Belleisle, we may believe, {{so long as}} he continued, {{was full}} of polite wonder over these things; perhaps had {{critical}} advices here and there, which would be politely received. It is certain he came out extremely brilliant, gifted and agreeable, in the eyes of Friedrich; who often afterwards, not in the very strictest language, calls him a great man, great soldier, and by far the considerablest person you French have. It is no less certain, Belleisle displayed, so far as <b>displayable,</b> his magnificent Diplomatic Ware to the best advantage. To which, we perceive, the young King answered, [...] "Magnificent, indeed!" [...] but would not bite all at once; and rather preferred corresponding with Fleury, on business points, keeping the matter dexterously hanging, in an illuminated element of hope and contingency, for the present.|$|E

50|$|The CGC 7900 was {{developed}} as a successor to the CG. It had a larger display, a more powerful processor, and more <b>displayable</b> colors (256 vs. 8). It retained backward compatibility with the CG's graphics language. A Color Lookup Table allowed each of its 256 <b>displayable</b> colors to be mapped to any of 224 (16,777,216) colors. This enabled smooth shading of certain images, but not true photographic realism.

LCDUI API provides a small set of displayables common in mobile device user interfaces: List, Alert, TextBox, Form and Canvas. For all displayables the device MIDP implementation has control over the presentation and layout of the <b>displayable.</b> Canvas is a low-level graphics surface for which an application has full control over what is rendered to it, although normally some space is reserved for system areas like screen title and indicators common in mobile device UIs. Since MIDP 2.0, Canvas also supports a full-screen mode that allows use of full screen graphics, which is especially useful for games.|$|E
