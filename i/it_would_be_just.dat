5|$|Whiteside became United's {{youngest}} {{first team}} player since Duncan Edwards in 1953, {{when he made}} his debut as a substitute against Brighton & Hove Albion in a 1–0 league win at the Goldstone Ground on 24 April 1982, two weeks before his 17th birthday. He later played in the FA Youth Cup final defeat to Watford, though <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>just</b> another year before he appeared in the final of the senior competition. He turned professional at Old Trafford on his 17th birthday, signing a three-year contract, and he shared a room with Steve Coppell, who was heading into retirement due to a knee injury of his own. He also struck up a close friendship with Paul McGrath, who would also face similar problems with his knee. On {{the final day of the}} season, eight days after his 17th birthday, he became the club's youngest goalscorer in a 2–0 home win over Stoke City.|$|E
25|$|On July 18, 2003 the Black Family {{won their}} first {{championship}} {{as a unit}} when they defeated Oscar Sevilla and Los Barrio Boys for the Atómicos title, but their run only lasted 31 days before Sevilla and Los Barrio Boys regained the titles. <b>It</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>just</b> over {{a year before the}} Black Family got another opportunity to hold the titles as they won them on August 20, 2004.|$|E
25|$|In {{an article}} {{published}} by The Guardian in 2011, Everett True contested: Kurt sang backing vocals on two songs. He wrote one B-side for Hole ("Old Age"), uncredited. And that was it. <b>It</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>just</b> as accurate and misleading to say that Courtney Love wrote most of Nirvana's third album, In Utero: you can certainly see her influence in Kurt's lyrics. Before the pair met, it was often guesswork as to his intentions. Afterwards, his lyrics were far more direct.|$|E

60|$|Well, sir, if there'd been a {{brass band}} to bust out some music, then, <b>it</b> <b>would</b> 'a' <b>been</b> <b>just</b> the perfectest thing I ever see, and Tom Sawyer {{he said the}} same.|$|R
25|$|The TSPC {{was opposed}} to the new plan. Its commissioners feared that their {{greatest}} work would pass to the control of an agency for which <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>just</b> one of many responsibilities, {{and that it would}} be necessary to make the Taconic a toll road in order to pay for the improvements planned. When the bill passed and the EHPA was created, with most of its members from Westchester, Columbia County residents feared the road would never be completed. The TSPC was allowed to operate the Taconic through 1962, by agreement with the EHPA, since the former's budget was already in place.|$|E
25|$|Tom Laliberty of Raytheon {{said that}} President Barack Obama {{was forced to}} shift from a land based missile defense system to a sea based one because of the {{difficulties}} of coordinating with partner nations. There is discussion {{about the effectiveness of}} this plan. Some critics say it is not as effective as a ground-based defense since the most advanced Standard missiles lack even half the range to hit ICBMs and even IRBMs arcing overhead. Also, the U.S. Defense Department has said <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>just</b> one component of a wider defense which might also include ground-based facilities. There are some reports that SPY-1 radar systems onboard some individual warships are not being maintained properly.|$|E
25|$|The first {{hearing was}} held with the Shafii {{scholars}} who accused Ibn Taymiyyah of anthropomorphism. At the time Ibn Taymiyyah was 42 years old. He {{was protected by}} the then Governor of Damascus, Aqqush al-Afram, during the proceedings. The scholars suggested that he accept that his creed was simply that of the Hanbalites and offered this as {{a way out of}} the charge. The issue being, if Ibn Taymiyyah ascribed his creed to the Hanbali school of law then <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>just</b> one view out of the four schools which one could follow rather than a creed everybody must adhere to. Ibn Taymiyyah was uncompromising and maintained that it was obligatory for all scholars to adhere to his creed.|$|E

"I fear, sir, {{you must}} apologise to Mr. Dalton. <b>It</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> more handsome, indeed <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> only <b>just,</b> {{and a free}} {{acknowledgment}} would go far--" [...] Richard paused, no language appearing delicate enough to suit the case.|$|R
50|$|A street suffix is {{the word}} that follows {{the name of a}} street to further {{describe}} that street. Sometimes <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> used <b>just</b> for naming, not for description, like for example, Street is the most common, Avenue being second.|$|R
6000|$|... "No," [...] said Brooke, drily. [...] "The arm is, I feel almost sure, {{very little}} the worse. Hadn't you better pick the papers up? You will excuse me stooping to help you. I {{scarcely}} think <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> advisable <b>just</b> now." ...|$|R
25|$|The law in its then {{current state}} of {{development}} was authoritatively summarised by Lord Goff in the Spycatcher case. He identified three qualifications limiting the broad general principle that a duty of confidence arose when confidential information came to the knowledge of a person (the confidant) in circumstances where he had notice that the information was confidential, with the effect that <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>just</b> in all the circumstances {{that he should be}} precluded from disclosing the information to others. First, once information had entered the public domain, it could no longer be protected as confidential. Secondly, the duty of confidence applied neither to useless information, nor to trivia. Thirdly, the public interest in the preservation of a confidence might be outweighed by a greater public interest favouring disclosure.|$|E
25|$|The Black Family {{made their}} first major show {{appearance}} at Verano de Escandalo (2001) where they lost an elimination match to Los Vatos Locos (Espiritu, Nygma, Silver Cat and Picudo), {{also in the}} match were Los Vipers (Psicosis II, Histeria, Maniaco and Mosco de la Merced) and Los Exoticos. the team did not make another major show appearance until a year later when they unsuccessfully challenged Los Vatos Locos for the Mexican National Atómicos Championship at Verano de Escandalo (2002). that challenge {{was the first of}} many as the Black Family began chasing the Atómicos title and feuding with Los Vatos Locos. when Los Vatos Locos lost the titles to someone else in late 2002 the Black Family started to target the new champions Oscar Sevilla and Los Barrio Boys (Alan, Billy Boy and Decnis). When Charly Manson returned to action he sided with Los Vipers instead of the Black Family leading to a match at Guerra de Titanes 2002 where the Black Family defeated Manson, Histeria, Mosco de la Merced, and Psicosis II. On July 18, 2003 the Black Family won their first championship as a unit when they defeated Oscar Sevilla and Los Barrio Boys for the Atómicos title, but their run only lasted 31 days before Sevilla and Los Barrio Boys regained the titles. <b>It</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>just</b> over a year before the Black Family got another opportunity to hold the titles as they won them on August 20, 2004.|$|E
500|$|Three days later, on July 4, it dug in on two hills {{straddling}} the road {{north of the}} village of Osan, [...] south of Suwon and about [...] south of Seoul. These ridges rose up to [...] above the road, providing visibility almost the entire distance to Suwon. The battalion set up a [...] long line over these ridges. There they waited to meet the advancing North Korean forces. The force was placed along the road with the infantry formations on the two hills, five of the howitzers sited [...] behind the infantry, and the sixth with its six HEAT shells positioned halfway between the infantry and the other five field artillery pieces. Heavy rain made air support impossible so Smith and Perry preregistered the artillery battery in the hope <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>just</b> as effective.|$|E

500|$|The {{couple were}} {{separated}} {{for long periods}} at a time, as Dash recalled that Aaliyah continuously shot films and would be gone for months often to come back shortly and continue her schedule. Dash was also committed to [...] "his own thing", which did not make matters any better. Despite this, they were understanding that {{the time they had}} together was special. Dash remembered they would [...] "be {{in a room full of}} people talking to each other and it felt like everyone was listening but <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>just</b> us. It would be like we were the only ones in the room". Dash always felt their time together was essential and Aaliyah was the person he was interested in being with, which is why, as he claimed, they had begun speaking about engagement. The relationship was mentioned in the lyrics of Jay-Z's remix to her song [...] "Miss You", released after her death.|$|E
500|$|Following Khrushchev's {{controversial}} {{claim that}} (pure) communism {{could be reached}} [...] "within 20 years", the new Soviet leadership responded by fostering the concept of developed socialism. Brezhnev declared {{the onset of the}} era developed socialism in 1971 at the 24th Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union. [...] Developed socialism was described as socialism [...] "attaining developed conditions", the result of [...] "perfecting" [...] the socialist society which had been created. In short, <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>just</b> another stage in the development of communism. Developed socialism evolved into the Brezhnev regime's ideological cornerstone, and helped it to explain the situation of the Soviet Union. However, the theory of developed socialism theory also held that the Soviet Union had reached a state in development where it was crisis-free, and this proved to be incorrect. As a result, Yuri Andropov, Brezhnev's successor, initiated the de-Brezhnevisation of the Soviet Union during his short time in office, and introduced more realistic ideological theses. He did retain developed socialism {{as a part of the}} state ideology, however.|$|E
2500|$|Chicago police {{launched}} an intensive investigation; rewards were offered for information. While Loeb went about his daily routine quietly, Leopold spoke freely to police and reporters, offering theories to any who would listen. He even told one detective, [...] "If I were to murder anybody, <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>just</b> such a cocky little {{son of a}} bitch as Bobby Franks".|$|E

60|$|GILBERT. Oh! {{journalism is}} unreadable, and {{literature}} is not read. That is all. But {{with regard to}} your statement that the Greeks had no art-critics, I assure you that <b>is</b> quite absurd. <b>It</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> more <b>just</b> {{to say that the}} Greeks were a nation of art-critics.|$|R
60|$|Just for {{an instant}} he {{believed}} <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> only <b>just</b> toward {{the man who had}} hired him, to repeat what he had been told to say, but then came the thought that he was virtually under arrest and the truth should be spoken at every hazard.|$|R
2500|$|While he was {{not made}} {{director}} in 1987 when that position's erstwhile occupant retired, {{he was given the}} directorship of the [...] "Elektromash" [...] Electronics Concern in the nearby Moldovan city of Tiraspol. <b>It</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>just</b> over two years before Smirnov led the city's municipal government as the chairman of the Tiraspol city soviet and just under three before he held the most powerful position in the embryonic—and unrecognized—Pridnestrovian Moldovan Soviet Socialist Republic.|$|E
2500|$|These studies help {{to explain}} why people {{identify}} a few circles and a line as a [...] "face" [...] so quickly and without hesitation. Cognitive processes are activated by the [...] "face-like" [...] object, which alert the observer to both the emotional state and identity of the subject, even before the conscious mind begins to process or even receive the information. [...] The [...] "stick figure face", despite its simplicity, conveys mood information (in this case, disappointment or mild unhappiness). <b>It</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>just</b> as simple to draw a stick figure face that would be perceived (by most people) as hostile and aggressive. [...] This robust and subtle capability is hypothesized {{to be the result}} of eons of natural selection favoring people most able to quickly identify the mental state, for example, of threatening people, thus providing the individual an opportunity to flee or attack pre-emptively. [...] In other words, processing this information subcortically— [...] therefore subconsciously— before it is passed on to the rest of the brain for detailed processing accelerates judgment and decision making when a fast reaction is needed. This ability, though highly specialized for the processing and recognition of human emotions, also functions to determine the demeanor of wildlife.|$|E
