5|$|Vanilla Ice took an {{interest}} in the musical style found on <b>Hard</b> <b>to</b> <b>Swallow</b> while performing {{as a member of a}} Miami grunge band, and was able to develop this sound through a friendship with producer Ross Robinson, with whom he shared {{an interest}} in motocross racing. Robinson produced the album after being advised against working with Vanilla Ice. The album's darker lyrical subject matter developed from conversations, in which Robinson encouraged him to write about his past. Subjects included Vanilla Ice's abusive childhood, drug addiction and struggles with fame. While the album revived Vanilla Ice's career, it received largely negative reviews and did not chart.|$|E
25|$|Five months later, the two {{met again}} in Biarritz in a regular season match. A massive fistfight, in which almost all players were {{involved}} broke out after just 5 minutes, after a scrum went up and the first rows exploded. The referee handed two yellows and two reds to Stade's Arnaud Marchois and BO's Imanol Harinordoquy. The rest was extremely rough, full of scuffles and insults. Stade {{went on to win}} 14–7. As can be expected, everyone condemned the other camp after the match. Biarritz coach Patrice Lagisquet assured Paris had assaulted his players to destabilise them, while the Parisians acknowledged that the overtime loss in the Top 14 final had been <b>hard</b> <b>to</b> <b>swallow,</b> especially as they had the impression that Biarritz had overemphasised the physical side. Ever since, the matches between the two teams have been relatively quiet.|$|E
500|$|<b>Hard</b> <b>to</b> <b>Swallow</b> is {{the third}} studio album by American rapper Vanilla Ice. Released by Republic Records in 1998, the album was the first album the {{performer}} recorded after a four-year hiatus following the 1994 release of Mind Blowin. Vanilla Ice intended the new musical direction found on the album {{as an attempt to}} move away from hip hop music and discard his former pop image. <b>Hard</b> <b>to</b> <b>Swallow</b> instead featured what he described as [...] "skate rock", a fusion of heavy metal, punk rock and hip hop. The album features appearances from Amen vocalist Casey Chaos, Bloodhound Gang vocalist Jimmy Pop, and Insane Poetry front man Cyco. Session musicians included drummer Shannon Larkin, keyboardist Scott Borland, and Snot guitarist Sonny Mayo.|$|E

500|$|Ice's third studio album, <b>Hard</b> <b>to</b> <b>Swallow,</b> {{featured}} a darker sound and lyrics than Ice's previous {{work as well}} as various mixtures of different styles of hip hop and hard rock which caught the media's attention. Ice attracted a whole new audience when he started touring again, some who were even unfamiliar with his more mainstream sound. Despite getting its own audience and going Gold, reviews of the album were generally negative. Jon Pareles of The New York Times wrote [...] "The most earnest new song, Scars, condemns an abusive father. The sentiments would sound more genuine if Korn hadn't gotten there first." [...] Richard Torres of Rolling Stone gave the album two out of five stars, writing that while [...] "nothing, however, can redeem Ice's wack boasting," [...] the album [...] "isn't half-bad." [...] In The New Rolling Stone Album Guide, Rob Kemp gave the album three out of five stars, writing that it contained Ice's [...] "most convincing music". A lot of executives at SonyBMG were predicting that the album would do better than 'To The Extreme'. In promotion of <b>Hard</b> <b>to</b> <b>Swallow,</b> Ice toured with a seven-piece live band which included bassist Scott Shriner. The band opened with rock-oriented material from <b>Hard</b> <b>to</b> <b>Swallow</b> and concluded with older hip hop songs. The setlist also included [...] "Power", based upon Led Zeppelin's [...] "Immigrant Song". Ice said that writing the songs and performing them were like therapy, as he had tried to hide his anger when making his older songs but Robinson was the first producer who told him to use it to create.|$|E

500|$|In {{the early}} stages of the album's development, it was {{promoted}} as an album of [...] "high-energy hip-hop." [...] Republic Records later described the album's musical style as [...] "aggressive rock" [...] in the stages preceding the album's release. Vanilla Ice referred to the album's musical style as [...] "skate rock." [...] The album's dark and thick sound fuses elements of heavy metal, punk rock and hip hop. Vanilla Ice stated that [...] "I wanted to express myself in a very intense way, and there was no way it was going to happen with a drum machine. Basically, I'm bored with drum machines and samples and stuff. With a band, they can build the energy around me." [...] Many critics have noticed a similarity between the style of music present on <b>Hard</b> <b>to</b> <b>Swallow</b> and that of bands such as Korn and Limp Bizkit.

500|$|Michael's first centric {{episode in}} season two was less well received. Mac Slocum of Filmfodder.com said [...] "it wasn't all that interesting".

Three episodes later, Jensen thought Michael's [...] "whiny dad act" [...] became [...] "increasingly tedious". When Michael murdered Ana Lucia and Libby in [...] "Two for the Road", Slocum called it the [...] "single biggest shocker in Lost history". C. K. Sample of AOL's TV Squad wrote that although he suspected that Ana Lucia and Libby were going to die, he thought what [...] "was amazing was who shot them". Zap2it's Amy Amatangelo described the double murder as [...] "a brilliant move", because [...] "one of their own [...] one of them". She added it was [...] "one of [...] season's most jaw-dropping moments". According to Perrineau, it made fans [...] "pissed off" [...] with Michael. Jensen praised Perrineau's acting, saying [...] "Michael's bloody betrayal is <b>hard</b> <b>to</b> <b>swallow,</b> but Harold Perrineau sells it". Many reviewers joked about how frequently Michael shouts [...] "Walt!", such as Alan Sepinwall of The Star-Ledger, Erin Martell of AOL's TV Squad, and Joshua Rich of Entertainment Weekly.

Jamey Giddens of Zap2it {{wrote of the}} decision to sign Francis onto the series: [...] "Maria Arena Bell just made Brian Frons kick a puppy in the face." [...] After her debut, he called Francis' portrayal of Genevieve [...] "embarrassingly-bad", stating: [...] "I'm sure I will catch hell for going here about a daytime treasure, but Francis' portrayal of Cane and Caleb's (Daniel Goddard) unhinged mother has been cartoonish and abysmal from her first air show. I don't know if Francis is painfully attempting to channel the late Elizabeth Taylor’s fun, campy turn as Luke and Laura's arch nemesis Helena Cassadine on General Hospital 30 years ago, or going for Evil-Lyn from the old He-Man and the Masters of the Universe cartoon, but she's missing the mark either way." [...] He also wrote that as much as he would [...] "love to solely blame this performance on the writing—because let’s face it, the story is dreadful—Francis is the one making the choices to jerk, gasp and wince as Genevieve registers each and every emotion or painful memory. This is not the Genie Francis we know and love." [...] Adam Hughes of Yahoo! wrote of viewers' reactions to Francis' debut and her portrayal, stating: [...] "Since Francis arrived on the scene this spring, fan reaction to her revised on-screen attitude has been a mixed bag, but she continues to draw a ton of interest to her new CBS television digs. Former General Hospital followers may find her more biting character <b>hard</b> <b>to</b> <b>swallow,</b> and longtime fans of The Young and The Restless have watched her push aside some of their favorites, but Francis has undoubtedly shaken up the local landscape. Buzz is half the game when comes to keeping soap opera fans interested, and Francis has certainly delivered that." ...|$|E

5|$|One of the higher-level predators {{within its}} ecosystem, the Australian swellshark feeds on {{crustaceans}} (particularly crabs and rock lobsters), cephalopods (including squid and octopus), and small fishes. Even large-sized prey tends <b>to</b> be <b>swallowed</b> whole; the {{long periods of}} rest exhibited by some sharks may relate to digestion. Like {{the other members of}} its genus, this shark is capable of rapidly inflating its body by taking water or air into its stomach, as a defense against predators. These include larger fishes, such as the broadnose sevengill shark (Notorynchus cepedianus), and marine mammals. By inflating, the shark may be able to wedge itself inside crevices, make itself <b>harder</b> <b>to</b> <b>swallow,</b> or simply intimidate a would-be predator. Marine snails are known to prey upon this shark's eggs. The Australian swellshark serves as a host to a number of parasite species, but these are poorly documented.|$|R
