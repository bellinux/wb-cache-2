5|$|A Love Surreal explores {{different}} stages of love in a cycle of slow-burning songs that Bilal deliberately wrote for female listeners.

Bilal {{wanted to make the}} album sound multidimensional and drew on the surrealist art of Salvador Dalí <b>for</b> <b>inspiration.</b>|$|E
5|$|A jazz fusion album, Songs of Experience explores darker sounds {{than its}} predecessor, as the poems Axelrod drew on <b>for</b> <b>inspiration</b> {{dealt with the}} darker side of humanity.

Consisting of five tracks, Manos Arriba was released as an audio CD and a digital EP.

5|$|According to legend, Murasaki {{retreated to}} Ishiyama-dera at Lake Biwa, {{where she was}} {{inspired}} to write The Tale of Genji on an August night while looking at the moon. Although scholars dismiss the factual basis {{of the story of}} her retreat, Japanese artists often depicted her at Ishiyama Temple staring at the moon <b>for</b> <b>inspiration.</b> She may have been commissioned to write the story and may have known an exiled courtier in a similar position to her hero Prince Genji. Murasaki would have distributed newly written chapters of Genji to friends who in turn would have re-copied them and passed them on. By this practice the story became known and she gained a reputation as an author.|$|E

5|$|After US President Richard Nixon {{made his}} famous 1972 visit to China, {{a wave of}} exchanges took place between the two countries. One of these was a {{delegation}} of the American Institute of Architects in 1974, which Pei joined. It was his first trip back to China since leaving in 1935.

They looked at past and present social movements for civil rights <b>for</b> <b>inspiration</b> for how one would progress and how people might respond to a movement for android rights. Luna wrote the first draft of issue one, then the two worked together to rewrite it.|$|E
5|$|Burton hired Danny Elfman, his {{collaborator}} on Pee-wee's Big Adventure and Beetlejuice, {{to compose}} the music score. <b>For</b> <b>inspiration,</b> Elfman was given The Dark Knight Returns.

In addition, producer Jon Peters was skeptical of hiring Elfman, but was later convinced {{when he heard the}} opening number. Peters and Peter Guber wanted Prince to write music for the Joker and Michael Jackson to do the romance songs. Elfman would then combine the style of Prince and Jackson's songs together for the entire film score.|$|E
