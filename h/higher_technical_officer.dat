40|$|M. Ed. It is of outmost {{importance}} that <b>technical</b> <b>officers</b> in Telkom are effective technological problem solvers. All prospective <b>technical</b> <b>officers</b> in Telkom {{are subjected to}} a selection process before starting with <b>technical</b> <b>officer's</b> training. The selecting process consists of two stages, namely: (1) the Senior Aptitude Test (SAT), and (2) the Introduction to the A-course. The problem statement of this study is: No scientific investigation is done {{on the effect of}} the Introduction to the A-course on the technological problem-solving style of prospective <b>technical</b> <b>officers.</b> The aim {{of this study is to}} determine the effect of the Introduction to A-course on the technological problem-solving style of prospective <b>technical</b> <b>officers,</b> when measured with the PSI-TECH inventory. The PSI-TECH inventory (technological problem-solving in-ventory) is used as a pre-test and a post-test to measure the technological problem-solving styles of 119 prospective <b>technical</b> <b>officers</b> in Telkom. The Introduction to the A-course (independent variable) serves as the treatment. In the process of measuring technological problem-solving style, differentiation occurs between effective and ineffective technological problem solvers. The PSI-TECH inventory performed very well in terms of reliability and validity in this study. Two conclusions were drawn from this case study, namely: (1) the Introduction to the A-course does not contribute towards the technological problem-solving styles of prospective <b>technical</b> <b>officers</b> and, (2) the PSI-TECH inventory can serve as a discriminator to determine who are effective and ineffective technological problem-solvers...|$|R
