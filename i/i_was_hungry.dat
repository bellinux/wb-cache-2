500|$|My {{specific}} {{intent is to}} bring attention {{to the millions of}} children in Africa who are dying every day, and are living without care, without medicine and without hope. I am asking people to open their hearts and minds to get involved in whatever way they can. The song ends with a quote from the Bible's Book of Matthew: 'For <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>hungry</b> and you gave me food. I was naked and you gave me clothing. I was sick and you took care of me and God replied, 'Whatever you did for the least of my brothers... you did it to me.' ...|$|E
500|$|I am very {{grateful}} that my show was so well received {{all over the}} world. But {{there seems to be}} many misinterpretations about my appearance on the cross and I wanted to explain it myself once and for all. There is a segment in my show where three of my dancers 'confess' or share harrowing experiences from their childhood that they ultimately overcame. My 'confession' follows and takes place on a Crucifix that I ultimately come down from. This is not a mocking of the church. It is no different than a person wearing a Cross or 'Taking Up the Cross' as it says in the Bible. My performance is neither anti-Christian, sacrilegious or blasphemous. Rather, it is my plea to the audience to encourage mankind to help one another and to see the world as a unified whole. I believe in my heart that if Jesus were alive today he would be doing the same thing. My specific intent is to bring attention to the millions of children in Africa who are dying every day, and are living without care, without medicine and without hope. I am asking people to open their hearts and minds to get involved in whatever way they can. The song ends with a quote from the Bible's Book of Matthew: 'For <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>hungry</b> and you gave me food. I was naked and you gave me clothing. I was sick and you took care of me and God replied, [...] "Whatever you did for the least of my brothers... you did it to me.' Please do not pass judgement without seeing my show.|$|E
6000|$|... "I'm {{tired of}} it," [...] I said. [...] "I {{want to come}} to grips with all these Rawdons. I think perhaps if <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>hungry</b> and savage I could talk to hungry men--" ...|$|E
50|$|Motivation is {{interlinked}} with desire. <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>hungry</b> therefore <b>I</b> <b>am</b> {{motivated to}} eat food; I want to eat.|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{eat when}} <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>hungry,</b> drink when <b>I</b> <b>am</b> thirsty, {{and have no}} other means of {{subsistence}} than chance throws in my Way," [...] replied the vagabond.|$|R
6000|$|... "Now let {{the banquet}} <b>be</b> served; for <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>hungry,</b> and <b>I</b> expect Bob <b>is,</b> too. As for the children, {{they are always}} hungry--at least, it seems so." ...|$|R
60|$|It was {{a capital}} dinner, and I went {{carefully}} {{through all the}} courses. <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>hungry.</b> I had been saving up some extra appetite for this dinner, and my regular appetite {{was a very good}} one.|$|E
60|$|Now hope blazed up again. If {{she were}} nearer, she must come nearer still. I {{recovered}} my ordinary {{state of mind}} sufficiently to know that <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>hungry,</b> and that I must eat {{to be strong and}} ready for what might happen.|$|E
60|$|Dinner {{on board}} the Spitfire was not an {{elaborate}} affair. The variety of food was not extensive, and the cook was not highly experienced in the culinary art. Nevertheless, <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>hungry,</b> and did full justice to what was placed before me.|$|E
6000|$|... "Little man," [...] he told Aaron, [...] "you are a fanatic. You do not understand. It is {{a quarter}} past nine and <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>hungry.</b> [...] . Ah!" ...|$|R
6000|$|His broad face lightened. [...] "That's {{a new one}} on me! Never {{was more}} {{surprised}} in my life! And, by golly, <b>I</b> believe <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>hungry.</b> Say, this <b>is</b> fine." ...|$|R
6000|$|No, no, <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>hungry.</b> What a head you have, blind man. Who but you [...] {{would have}} {{remembered that the}} hen-wife slept for a little at noon [...] every day.|$|R
60|$|After all we {{are very}} human. The {{dressing}} bugle brought {{me back to the}} present, and I remembered that <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>hungry.</b> I descended into my state-room, and found all my things neatly laid out, and Guest sitting on the opposite bunk regarded them critically.|$|E
60|$|Herky-Jerky's {{method of}} broiling {{a piece of}} venison {{at the end of}} a stick solved the problem of cooking. Then it was that the little flat flask, full of mixed salt and pepper, rewarded me for the long {{carrying}} of it. <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>hungry,</b> and I feasted.|$|E
60|$|The {{food was}} not {{of the best and}} daintiest kind, but <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>hungry,</b> and even at the risk of {{starving}} later on I ate nearly the whole of it. He had also brought along a pitcher of water, and of this I took a deep draught.|$|E
6000|$|... "I think we'll have to camp {{here for}} to-night," [...] said Shep. [...] "We can't {{go back to}} where we took lunch with {{darkness}} coming on. And <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>hungry,</b> too." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Now <b>I</b> <b>am</b> {{going to}} eat you," [...] it said, [...] "as I ate all the others. <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>hungry,</b> very hungry," [...] and it prodded me about with its nose and rolled me over.|$|R
6000|$|Raising {{her voice}} {{in a tone}} of gentle pleading, she said, [...] "I came over the sea. <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>hungry,</b> and so <b>is</b> the child. Will you not give us some milk?" ...|$|R
60|$|I {{almost forgot}} that <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>hungry</b> or thirsty, for the fever of killing was upon me, and my one {{hope was that}} we might draw them {{two or three times}} more in order to give the villainous brutes such a lesson in blood-letting as they had never learned before.|$|E
6000|$|... "What do {{you want}} me to tell you? How I went twice a week to eat free dinners! How I took charity! How <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>hungry!</b> There was a rich cousin of my mother's--I used to go to him. I didn't like it. But if you're {{starving}} in the winter." ...|$|E
6000|$|Yes, {{and twice}} {{in the months that}} {{followed}} you passed me on the street and did not know me, Martin almost said aloud. Each time <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>hungry</b> and heading for the pawnbroker. Yet it was work performed. You did not know me then. Why do you know me now? ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Women!" [...] exclaimed Mrs Merton severely, [...] "we must {{rise to the}} occasion. <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>hungry</b> now, {{and it is not}} yet noon; {{what will}} be our {{condition}} if we wait till night for our dinner?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "It is not, my lord. I {{had counted}} upon going home, so <b>I</b> had. <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>hungry</b> {{for the green}} lanes of England." [...] He sighed. [...] "There will be apple-blossoms in the {{orchards}} of Somerset." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I cannot say. <b>I</b> <b>am</b> sorrowful to my tail's tail {{that he felt}} not thy knife. There {{is always}} evil at Cold Lairs--above ground or below. But now <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>hungry.</b> Dost thou hunt with me this dawn?" [...] said Kaa.|$|R
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>hungry</b> by {{this time}} and not sorry to get animal food once more; nevertheless, I ate this meat with some disgust, as it had a rank taste and smell, {{and it was also}} {{unpleasant}} to have those evil-looking dogs savagely gnawing at the animal's head and feet at the same time.|$|E
6000|$|... "It is a {{great deal}} of money," [...] he said at last. [...] "Often in prison <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>hungry,</b> I had no cigarettes. I was forced to drink water. A great deal of money! And she is my wife! Half of what she has belongs to me! That is the law, eh?" ...|$|E
60|$|After {{the sail}} was rigged and the rudder lashed in position, {{we took our}} first meal on the raft. <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>hungry,</b> but fearful of {{exhausting}} our stock of provisions before we reached land or help of some kind, I ate no more than was absolutely necessary, and the cabin boy did the same.|$|E
6000|$|... "So do mine," [...] Matteo agreed. [...] "In addition, <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>hungry,</b> for {{the bread}} {{they gave us}} this morning was not fit for dogs, {{although}} I had to eat it, as it was that or nothing." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Then <b>I</b> <b>am</b> glad <b>I</b> wore it to-night," [...] was the {{astonishing}} reply. [...] "Quick, quick, quick, Hortense! Get {{me into the}} bath, and bring me some wine and biscuits. <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>hungry.</b> <b>I</b> don't think I could have eaten any dinner." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I forgot!" [...] she exclaimed. [...] "I haven't the {{slightest}} right to your confidence. Besides, when I {{come to think}} of it, I don't believe that <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>hungry</b> at all. <b>I</b> shall try my luck with your money?" ...|$|R
60|$|Naturally I grew {{white and}} weak. My Dakota tan and my corn-fed muscle melted away. The {{only part of}} me which flourished was my hair. I begrudged every quarter which went to the barbers and I was cold {{most of the time}} (except when I infested the library) and <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>hungry</b> all the time.|$|E
6000|$|... "Once," [...] {{said the}} Mule, [...] "I lost my bray so that I couldn't call to Betsy {{to let her}} know <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>hungry.</b> That was before I could talk, you know, for I had not yet come into the Land of Oz, and I found it was {{certainly}} very uncomfortable {{not to be able to}} make a noise." ...|$|E
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>hungry</b> and sleepy, and 'ow I {{was going}} to get through the day I couldn't think. I went into a pub and 'ad a couple o' pints o' stout and a crust o' bread and cheese for brekfuss. I don't know wot she 'ad, but when the barman tried to take for it out o' my money, I {{surprised}} 'im.|$|E
6000|$|... 'Oh, nonsense, mother; what {{power could}} a {{creature}} like that have over me? Besides, <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>hungry,</b> and if <b>I</b> don't have my dinner soon, <b>I</b> shall <b>be</b> cross.' And off {{she went to}} gather some flowers to stick in her hair.|$|R
6000|$|... "No-o-o," [...] drawled the wolf, reflectively, [...] "I {{should not}} like to promise that; I mean to eat a part of you. There may be a tuft of fur, and a toe-nail or two, left {{for you to go}} on with. <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>hungry,</b> but <b>I</b> <b>am</b> not hoggish." ...|$|R
5000|$|... "I am {{so happy}} with my {{performance}} in this tournament, I never expected to beat the top players {{at such a young}} age but now I have the confidence that I can, and <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>hungry</b> to go on court with the top player." ...|$|R
