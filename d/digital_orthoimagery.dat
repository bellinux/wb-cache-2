40|$|Coastal {{lowlands}} such as Newport Harbor experience episodic flooding {{from the}} com-bined effects of extreme high tides, wind and waves; and higher mean sea levels from global warming {{will increase the}} frequency of damaging events. Research is underway to incorporate wave-driven flooding processes in BreZo, to provide a unified framework for tide- and wave-driven flooding which {{can be linked to}} flood control infrastructure and used to manage future flood risks. Timu Gallien (PhD Student) is leading this effort and working towards validation of the model at Newport Beach. Field surveys of December, 2008 flooding were completed and photographs of January, 2005 flooding are being pro-cessed for a second validation dataset.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} the BA thesis is to analyze the {{ownership}} structure under roads for {{the area of the}} county Šmarješke Toplice. The thesis briefly presents the legal basis that {{must be taken into account}} when analyzing the ownership and defining the breakdown and categorization of roads. We carried out an analysis by which we obtained information on the ownership of the land under consideration. In doing so, we compared the overlap between road layers and the land register data on one side, and road layers and the <b>digital</b> <b>orthoimagery</b> on the other. The {{purpose of the}} analysis was to obtain and estimate the proportion of roads without registered ownership and roads with assigned and registered ownership (private, state or. municipal ownership). The result is a list of road sections which are not specified in the land register. The list may be an integral part of a proposal for the regulation and entry in the cadastral database...|$|E
40|$|Coastal environments at {{high latitudes}} are {{experiencing}} rapid change (e. g., Solomon, 2005; Jorgenson and Brown, 2005; Mars and Houseknecht, 2007). Coastal erosion threatens {{a variety of}} nearshore marine, terrestrial, and freshwater habitats, and may be accelerating with Arctic warming. To better understand impacts for national parks in northwestern Alaska, a collaborative study has begun to document coastal change in the southeast Chukchi Sea (Fig. 1). A field-based component includes: repeat photography; mapping and description of sediments and landforms; and periodic ground-truth measurements of shoreline change since 1987 at 27 coastal monitoring sites. A geospatial component began with creation of <b>digital</b> <b>orthoimagery</b> over a large area (> 6000 km 2) at high resolution (1. 0 m or better) for three "timeslices": approx. 1950, approx. 1980, and 2003 (Manley et al., 2007). Spatial analysis of bluff retreat was conducted for selected areas near the monitoring sites using the USGS DSAS extension to ArcGIS (Thieler et al., 2005). Results indicate that the GIS-based measurements have acceptably low errors (+/- 0. 1 m/yr or better). Transects with 20 -m spacing reveal high spatial variability related to coastal morphologies and processes (Figs. 2 and 3). A comparison of the two time intervals suggests temporal variability also. For example, bluff erosion rates appear to have decreased after 1980 for the north-facing coast of Bering Land Bridge National Park (BELA) whil...|$|E
40|$|The USGS National Water Information System (NWIS) {{provides}} {{real time}} access to stream gage observations of river stage and discharge at over 7, 000 locations nationwide. During periods of potential or actual flooding, NWIS provides invaluable information to hydrologists, emergency managers, local government, business, industry, farmers, and the general public. Stage and discharge are available in tabular form or plotted as hydrographs to illustrate current variations in flow compared with historical median values. Such data products are used to track the evolution of rapidly evolving river conditions that {{pose a threat to}} lives, property, and infrastructure. Thanks to the availability of The National Map’s <b>digital</b> elevation, <b>orthoimagery,</b> and vector feature data, USGS can potentially add significant value to NWIS offerings by providing geospatial information products to accompany tabular and graphical summaries. Inundation patterns, based on the combined use of streamflow and elevation data, could be displayed over orthoimages or vector features (transportation, hydrography, administrative boundaries, etc) to permit visualization of high water conditions in the vicinity of a stream gage. Map products of this kind would more clearly illustrate the consequences of high flows to a broad audience of users...|$|R

The main objective of the mission was the GPS measurements of the objects preliminary chosen as Ground Control Points (GCPs) used for satellite images geo-correction and orthorectification, and the external quality control. Their identifiability conditions were checked on several existing images over this area (e. g. WV 1, GE- 1, EROSB, Cartosat 2, RE, Cartosat 1, ortoADS 40 b-w). The second objective {{was to assess the}} impact of GCP position accuracy on orthorectification quality since most of these points are identifiable on the Leica Geosystems ADS 40 <b>Digital</b> Airborne Camera <b>Orthoimagery.</b> The third objective it is to test the GeoXH accuracy.

40|$|Usual {{workflows}} for production, archiving, dissemination {{and use of}} Earth observation images (both aerial {{and from}} remote sensing satellites) pose big interoperability problems, as for example: non-alignment of pixels at the different levels of the pyramids that {{makes it impossible to}} overlay, compare and mosaic different orthoimages, without resampling them and the need to apply multiple resamplings and compression-decompression cycles. These problems cause great inefficiencies in production, dissemination through web services and processing in “Big Data” environments. Most of them can be avoided, or at least greatly reduced, {{with the use of a}} common “nested grid” for mutiresolution production, archiving, dissemination and exploitation of <b>orthoimagery,</b> <b>digital</b> elevation models and other raster data. “Nested grids” are space allocation schemas that organize image footprints, pixel sizes and pixel positions at all pyramid levels, in order to achieve coherent and consistent multiresolution coverage of a whole working area. A “nested grid” must be complemented by an appropriate “tiling schema”, ideally based on the “quad-tree” concept. In the last years a “de facto standard” grid and Tiling Schema has emerged and has been adopted by virtually all major geospatial data providers. It has also been adopted by OGC in its “WMTS Simple Profile” standard. In this paper we explain how the adequate use of this tiling schema as common nested grid for orthoimagery, DEMs and other types of raster data constitutes the most practical solution to most of the interoperability problems of these types of data...|$|R
40|$|One of {{the primary}} sources of {{reference}} information for the update of any administrative, cadastral or thematic-related spatial dataset is orthoimagery produced either from airborne or spaceborne sensors. Althought the classical methods for processing and validation of remote sensing data are well established and provide straigthforward approach, the rapid introduction of digital airborn imaging systems in the market poses new challenges {{with respect to the}} implementation of standartized approach for production and quality control. The ¿Guidelines for Best Practice and Quality Checking of Ortho Imagery¿ document, developed by GeoCAP team of Agriculture Unit, JRC, aimed to provide the European Commission and the remote sensing user community with a general framework of the best approaches for quality checking of orthorectified remotely sensed imagery, and the expected best practice, required to achieve good results. These guidelines were used as a core reference document in the Control with Remote Sensing Program of the European Commission, supporting the Common Agriculture Policy. In this respect, they apply to <b>digital</b> <b>orthoimagery</b> products, generated from either film cameras or digital instruments, on both airborne or satellite platforms, used in the management, monitoring and control of agricultural subsidies and to some degree (particularly very high spatial resolutions) large scale mapping or cadastre applications. In 2007, a revision of these guidelines, was initiated in order to incoprorate the new sensors and techologies emerged (for example, the airborne digital cameras) and to make the document more generic, consolidating all the changes and ammendments done in the last years. Attention was given to the important and common steps in the photogrammetric process, and to the definition of quality control checks (ISO compliant), which are clear to understand and easy to apply. The work for the revision and optimization of the JRC Guidelines could be valuable also for the elaboration of the specification for orthoimagery on Pan-European level in the frame of INSPIRE. JRC.

40|$|Recently, {{especially}} {{within the}} last two decades, the demand for DSMs (Digital Surface Models) and 3 D city models has increased dramatically. This has arisen due {{to the emergence of}} new applications beyond construction or analysis and consequently to a focus on accuracy and the cost. This thesis addresses two linked subjects: first improving the quality of the DSM by merging different source DSMs using a Bayesian approach; and second, extracting building footprints using approaches, including Bayesian approaches, and producing 3 D models. Regarding the first topic, a probabilistic model has been generated based on the Bayesian approach in order to merge different source DSMs from different sensors. The Bayesian approach is specified to be ideal in the case when the data is limited and this can consequently be compensated by introducing the a priori. The implemented prior is based on the hypothesis that the building roof outlines are specified to be smooth, for that reason local entropy has been implemented in order to infer the a priori data. In addition to the a priori estimation, the quality of the DSMs is obtained by using field checkpoints from differential GNSS. The validation results have shown that the model was successfully able {{to improve the quality of}} the DSMs and improving some characteristics such as the roof surfaces, which consequently led to better representations. In addition to that, the developed model has been compared with the Maximum Likelihood model which showed similar quantitative statistical results and better qualitative results. Perhaps it is worth mentioning that, although the DSMs used in the merging have been produced using satellite images, the model can be applied on any type of DSM. The second topic is building footprint extraction based on using satellite imagery. An efficient flow-line for automatic building footprint extraction and 3 D model construction, from both stereo panchromatic and multispectral satellite imagery was developed. This flow-line has been applied in an area of different building types, with both hipped and sloped roofs. The flow line consisted of multi stages. First, data preparation, <b>digital</b> <b>orthoimagery</b> and DSMs are created from WorldView- 1. Pleiades imagery is used to create a vegetation mask. The orthoimagery then undergoes binary classification into ‘foreground’ (including buildings, shadows, open-water, roads and trees) and ‘background’ (including grass, bare soil, and clay). From the foreground class, shadows and open water are removed after creating a shadow mask by thresholding the same orthoimagery. Likewise roads have been removed, for the time being, after interactively creating a mask using the orthoimagery. NDVI processing of the Pleiades imagery has been used to create a mask for removing the trees. An ‘edge map’ is produced using Canny edge detection to define the exact building boundary outlines, from enhanced orthoimagery. A normalised digital surface model (nDSM) is produced from the original DSM using smoothing and subtracting techniques. Second, start Building Detection and Extraction. Buildings can be detected, in part, in the nDSM as isolated relatively elevated ‘blobs’. These nDSM ‘blobs’ are uniquely labelled to identify rudimentary buildings. Each ‘blob’ is paired with its corresponding ‘foreground’ area from the orthoimagery. Each ‘foreground’ area is used as an initial building boundary, which is then vectorised and simplified. Some unnecessary details in the ‘edge map’, particularly on the roofs of the buildings can be removed using mathematical morphology. Some building edges are not detected in the ‘edge map’ due to low contrast in some parts of the orthoimagery. The ‘edge map’ is subsequently further improved also using mathematical morphology, leading to the ‘modified edge map’. Finally, A Bayesian approach is used to find the most probable coordinates of the building footprints, based on the ‘modified edge map’. The proposal that is made for the footprint a priori data is based on the creating a PDF which assumes that the probable footprint angle at the corner is 90 o and along the edge is 180 o, with a less probable value given to the other angles such as 45 o and 135 o. The 3 D model is constructed by extracting the elevation of the buildings from the DSM and combining it with the regularized building boundary. Validation, both quantitatively and qualitatively has shown that the developed process and associated algorithms have successfully been able to extract building footprints and create 3 D models...|$|E
