40|$|In this paper, the {{capability}} of a novel cooling system for microchannels {{based on the principle}} of electrowetting is examined. To start with, the elcctrowetting effect in microchannels is experimentally investigated. The used electrowetting system consists of a liquid droplet deposited on a conductive Si substrate and electrically insulated from this substrate by a dielectric, layer. Microchannels of 100 mum times 100 mum are etched in the substrate. By applying an ac voltage signal between the droplet and the substrate, the microchannels can be periodically tilled and emptied with the liquid of the droplet. This oscillating liquid flow will be used to cool the chip. For the 100 mum times 100 mum microchannels a voltage of 51 V is required for the actuation. Further, based upon the results of the filling of the channels the cooling capacity of the proposed system is theoretically investigated. The theoretically achievable cooling rate of this enhanced system is compared to the heat transfer by conduction through a silicon substrate. A critical filing period is found; for shorter <b>filling</b> <b>periods,</b> the heat transfer will be improved by inserting microchannels, for higher <b>filling</b> <b>periods</b> the electrowetting deteriorates the cooling.

In other words, when mitral valve opens, the atrium does not push blood into the ventricle, instead, it is the ventricle that mechanically [...] "sucks" [...] in blood from the atrium. The energy that drives the suction process is generated from phase of systole. During systole, to overcome the peripheral arterial load at ejection, ventricle contracts, which also compresses elastic tissues internal to and external to the myocardium. Then, when cardiac muscle relaxes, the energy captured by compressed elements releases, driving the recoil of ventricular wall until a new balanced equilibrium state is reached.|$|E

5000|$|The precise {{impact of}} the dam on the {{downstream}} countries is not known. Egypt fears a temporary reduction of water availability due to the filling of the dam and a permanent reduction because of evaporation from the reservoir. Studies indicate that the primary factors which will govern the impacts during the reservoir filling phase include the initial reservoir elevation of the Aswan High Dam, the rainfall that occurs during the <b>filling</b> <b>period</b> and the negotiated arrangement between the three countries. These studies also show that only through close and continuous coordination, the risks of negative impacts can be minimized or eliminated. The reservoir volume (74 billion cubic meters) is about 1.5 times the average annual flow (49 billion cubic meters) of the Blue Nile at the Sudanese-Egyptian border. This loss to downstream countries could be spread over several years if the countries reach an agreement. Depending on the initial storage in the Aswan High Dam and this filling schedule of the GERD, flows into Egypt could be temporarily reduced, which may affect the income of two million farmers {{during the period of}} filling the reservoir. Allegedly, it would also [...] "affect Egypt's electricity supply by 25 to 40 percent, while the dam is being built". However, hydropower accounts for less than 12 percent of total electricity production in Egypt in 2010 (14 out of 121 billion kWh), so that a temporary reduction of 25 percent in hydropower production translates into an overall temporary reduction in Egyptian electricity production of less than 3 percent. The Grand Ethiopian Renaissance Dam could also lead to a permanent lowering of the water level in Lake Nasser, if floods are stored instead in Ethiopia. This would reduce the current evaporation of more than 10 billion cubic meter per year, but it would also reduce the ability of the Aswan High Dam to produce hydropower to the tune of a 100 MW loss of generating capacity for a 3 m reduction of the water level. Significantly however, the increased storage in Ethiopia can provide a greater buffer to shortages in Sudan and Egypt during years of future drought, if the countries can reach a compromise.|$|E

40|$|Graduation date: 1982 The need {{to develop}} a shorter life cycle wheat {{cultivar}} which would be more adapted to multiple cropping systems prompted this study. Thus the following information was obtained. Greatest variations in developmental patterns were found in the stem elongation, booting, inflorescence emergence and anthesis for five winter and five spring cultivars when planted at different dates. Differences among the ten winter wheat cultivars in time, duration and rate of grain filling was also observed. Generally later flowering cultivars had a more rapid rate of grain filling than early flowering cultivars with the net result being that physiological maturity was similar between the two groups. Actual grain <b>filling</b> <b>period</b> from flowering to physiological maturity varied among the cultivars, but larger differences were observed in lag period from heading to flowering. The duration of lag period contributed to the largest difference in total grain <b>filling</b> <b>period</b> from heading to physiological maturity. Changes in visual spike color of the glumes and main axis of a spike was satisfactory in identifying physiological maturity without destruction of the spike; however changes in kernel color was a more direct and precise method. Physiological maturity is a better measure of the optimum harvesting time to provide for maximum grain yield for planting sequential crops. Grain yield was positively associated with time of heading, flowering, physiological maturity, rate of grain filling and components of grain yield, but negatively associated with duration of grain <b>filling</b> <b>period,</b> lag period and harvest index.
