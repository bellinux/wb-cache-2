5|$|Brothers Robert and Dennis Skotak {{were hired}} to {{supervise}} the visual effects, having previously worked with Cameron on several Roger Corman movies. Two stages were used to construct the colony on LV-426, using miniature models that were on average six feet tall and three feet wide. Filming the miniatures was difficult because of the weather; the wind would blow over the props; however, it proved helpful to give the effect of weather on the planet. Cameron used these miniatures and several effects to make scenes look larger than they really were, including rear projection, mirrors, beam splitters, camera splits and foreground miniatures. Due to budget limits, Cameron {{said he had to}} pay for the robotic arm used to cut into Ripley's shuttle in the opening scene. Practical effects supervisor John Richardson (who won a special effects Oscar for his part in the film) declared his biggest challenge was creating the forklift power loader exoskeletons, which required only three months of work and had Cameron complaining about visual details during construction. The model could not stand on its own, requiring either wires <b>dangling</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> shoulders or a pole through the back attached to a crane. While Sigourney Weaver was inside the power loader model, a stunt man standing behind it would move the arms and legs.|$|E

25|$|A man rode {{his horse}} to church, {{only to find}} just the steeple {{sticking}} out of the snow. So, he tied his horse to the steeple with the other horses, and went down the snow tunnel to attend services. When everybody emerged from the church, they found a Chinook had melted all of the snow, and their horses were now all <b>dangling</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> church steeple.|$|E

25|$|Peter Hillwood of Hampshire Aero Club {{constructed}} an Avro Triplane Mk IV, using drawings {{provided by}} Geoffrey Verdon Roe, son of A.V. Roe, the designer. The {{construction of the}} triplane followed A.V. Roe's specifications and was the only replica that utilised wing-warping successfully. With a more powerful 90hp Cirrus II replacing the 35hp Green engine {{that was in the}} original design, the Avro Triplane proved to be a lively performer even with a stuntman <b>dangling</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> fuselage.|$|E
25|$|The short drop is {{performed}} {{by placing the}} condemned prisoner {{on the back of}} a cart, horse, or other vehicle, with the noose around the neck. The object is then moved away, leaving the person <b>dangling</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> rope. A ladder was also commonly used with the condemned being forced to ascend, after which the noose was tied and the ladder pulled away or turned, leaving the condemned hanging. Another method involves using a stool, which the condemned is required to stand on, being kicked away. The guards at the Stutthof concentration camp who were sentenced to death were executed by short-drop hanging; they were placed in the noose while standing or sitting on a truck, and the trucks were driven away.|$|E
25|$|After seeing Negan kill {{two members}} of his own party, Rick vows to the Saviors' leader that he will kill him someday. Unfazed, Negan drags Rick to the group's RV, viciously announcing that he will be back and if Rick isn't with him, his men have {{permission}} to kill the rest of Rick's gang. After taunting Rick, Negan drives off and brings the RV to a stop near one of the Saviors' roadblocks by an overpass, amid a horde of walkers in thick morning fog. Negan then tosses Rick's axe onto the RV's roof and orders Rick to retrieve it before pushing him out of the RV. Amidst the heavy fog and smoke, Rick scrambles for safety on the RV's roof and sees a walker body <b>dangling</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> overpass. He has flashbacks to Abraham's and Glenn's deaths, but Negan becomes impatient for Rick to return and starts firing up through the roof. Rick jumps to the hanging corpse, but slips and falls, dropping the axe. As the walkers swarm around him, Negan fires onto the walkers, giving Rick the chance to collect the axe and return to the RV.|$|E

500|$|In {{the scene}} when Jack is <b>dangling</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> cliff, Matthew Fox {{performs}} the stunt himself, as he considered that relying on stunt doubles [...] "always sort of inhibits the director's ability {{to shoot it}} in cool ways." [...] Fox dangled from a thirty foot high cliff {{in front of a}} blue screen, that through digital extensions appeared to be hundreds of feet high. However, Fox's long time stunt actor, Steve Blalock, performed Jack's rolling down the mountain before grabbing the edge of the cliff, given Fox considered that [...] "there are some things that I'm not gonna be able to do".|$|E
500|$|Norma was {{introduced}} in 1751–52 by Nicolas Louis de Lacaille with the French name l’Equerre et la Regle, [...] "the Square and Rule", after he had observed and catalogued 10,000 southern stars during a two-year stay at the Cape of Good Hope. He devised 14 new constellations in uncharted regions of the Southern Celestial Hemisphere not visible from Europe. All but one honored instruments that symbolised the Age of Enlightenment. Lacaille portrayed the constellations of Norma, Circinus and Triangulum Australe, respectively, as a set square and ruler, a compass, and a surveyor's level {{in a set of}} draughtsman instruments, in his 1756 map of the southern stars. The level was <b>dangling</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> apex of a triangle, leading some astronomers to conclude he was renaming [...] l’Equerre et la Regle to [...] "le Niveau" [...] "the level". In any case, the constellation's name had been shortened and Latinised by Lacaille to Norma by 1763.|$|E
2500|$|The chants as devotees {{circled the}} niu were {{described}} by one European commentator as [...] "a jumble of Christian and ancient concepts, of soldier and sailor terms, of English and Māori language with the barking watchword {{of the cult}} interspersed". The [...] "angels of the wind" [...] {{were said to be}} present during the service, ascending and descending the ropes <b>dangling</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> mast's yard-arm. By the end of 1865 a niu stood in almost every large village from Taranaki to the Bay of Plenty and from the north of the Wellington district to the Waikato frontier.|$|E

2500|$|While filming {{an aerial}} stunt for The Grim Game, two biplanes {{collided}} in mid-air with a stuntman doubling Houdini dangling by a rope {{from one of}} the planes. Publicity was geared heavily toward promoting this dramatic [...] "caught on film" [...] moment, claiming it was Houdini himself <b>dangling</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> plane. While filming these movies in Los Angeles, Houdini rented a home in Laurel Canyon. Following his two-picture stint in Hollywood, Houdini returned to New York and started his own film production company called the [...] "Houdini Picture Corporation". He produced and starred in two films, The Man from Beyond (1921) and Haldane of the Secret Service (1923). He also founded his own film laboratory business called The Film Development Corporation (FDC), gambling on a new process for developing motion picture film. Houdini's brother, Theodore Hardeen, left his own career as a magician and escape artist to run the company. Magician Harry Kellar was a major investor.|$|E
