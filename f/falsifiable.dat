5|$|A {{statement}} is considered <b>falsifiable</b> {{if there is}} an observation or a test that could be made that would demonstrate that the {{statement is}} false. Statements that are not <b>falsifiable</b> cannot be examined by scientific investigation since they permit no tests that evaluate their accuracy. Creationists such as Henry M. Morris have claimed that any observation can be fitted into the evolutionary framework, so it is impossible to demonstrate that evolution is wrong and therefore evolution is non-scientific.|$|E
25|$|Critics of the Barrow and Tipler SAP {{claim that}} it is neither {{testable}} nor <b>falsifiable,</b> and thus is not a scientific statement but rather a philosophical one. The same criticism has been leveled against the hypothesis of a multiverse, although some argue that it does make <b>falsifiable</b> predictions. A modified version of this criticism is that we understand so little about the emergence of life, especially intelligent life, that it is effectively impossible to calculate the number of observers in each universe. Also, the prior distribution of universes {{as a function of}} the fundamental constants is easily modified to get any desired result.|$|E
25|$|As is true {{of other}} media or forms of divination and occult practices, advocates assert that scrying has merit {{as a means of}} {{revealing}} the future or other unknowns; such assertions however, lack support from any form of <b>falsifiable</b> scientific investigation.|$|E
25|$|Where astrology {{has made}} <b>falsifiable</b> predictions, {{it has been}} falsified. The most famous test was headed by Shawn Carlson and {{included}} a committee of scientists and a committee of astrologers. It led {{to the conclusion that}} natal astrology performed no better than chance.|$|E
25|$|Karl Popper, {{who argued}} that all proper {{scientific}} theories must be potentially <b>falsifiable,</b> claimed that Freud's psychoanalytic theories were presented in unfalsifiable form, meaning that no experiment could ever disprove them. Adolf Grünbaum argues in The Foundations of Psychoanalysis (1984) that Popper was mistaken and that many of Freud's theories are empirically testable, a position with which others such as Eysenck agree. The philosopher Donald Levy agrees with Grünbaum that Freud's theories are <b>falsifiable</b> but disputes Grünbaum's contention that therapeutic success is only the empirical basis on which they stand or fall, arguing that a much wider range of empirical evidence can be adduced if clinical case material is taken into consideration.|$|E
25|$|Delusions do not {{necessarily}} have to be false or 'incorrect inferences about external reality'. Some religious or spiritual beliefs by their nature may not be <b>falsifiable,</b> and hence cannot be described as false or incorrect, no matter whether the person holding these beliefs was diagnosed as delusional or not.|$|E
25|$|Economist Thomas Mayer {{has stated}} that Austrians {{advocate}} {{a rejection of the}} scientific method which involves the development of empirically <b>falsifiable</b> theories. Furthermore, many supporters of using models of market behavior to analyze and test economic theory argue that economists have developed numerous experiments that elicit useful information about individual preferences.|$|E
25|$|MWI is {{considered}} {{by some to be}} unfalsifiable and hence unscientific because the multiple parallel universes are non-communicating, in the sense that no information can be passed between them. Others claim MWI is directly testable. Everett regarded MWI as <b>falsifiable</b> since any test that falsifies conventional quantum theory would also falsify MWI.|$|E
25|$|In Karl Popper's {{philosophy}} of science, {{belief in a}} supernatural God is outside the natural domain of scientific investigation because all scientific hypotheses must be <b>falsifiable</b> in the natural world. The non-overlapping magisteria view proposed by Stephen Jay Gould also holds that the existence (or otherwise) of God is irrelevant to and beyond the domain of science.|$|E
25|$|Some {{accounts}} {{use this}} response to rebut {{claims that the}} theory of evolution is not <b>falsifiable</b> by any empirical evidence. This followed an assertion by philosopher, Karl Popper, who had proposed that falsifiability is an essential feature of a scientific theory. Popper also expressed doubts about the scientific status of evolutionary theory, although he later concluded that the field of study was genuinely scientific.|$|E
25|$|In 1974, The Structure of Scientific Revolutions {{was ranked}} {{as the second}} most {{frequently}} used book in political science courses focused on scope and methods. In particular, Kuhn’s theory {{has been used by}} political scientists to critique behavioralism, which claims that accurate political statements must be both testable and <b>falsifiable.</b> The book also proved popular with political scientists embroiled in debates about whether a set of formulations put forth by a political scientists constituted a theory, or something else.|$|E
25|$|Statistical {{methods such as}} {{regression}} analysis are common. Practitioners use such methods to estimate the size, economic significance, and statistical significance ("signal strength") of the hypothesized relation(s) and to adjust for noise from other variables. By such means, a hypothesis may gain acceptance, although in a probabilistic, rather than certain, sense. Acceptance is dependent upon the <b>falsifiable</b> hypothesis surviving tests. Use of commonly accepted methods need not produce a final conclusion or even a consensus on a particular question, given different tests, data sets, and prior beliefs.|$|E
25|$|Theorems in {{mathematics}} and theories in science are fundamentally different in their epistemology. A scientific theory cannot be proved; its key attribute {{is that it is}} <b>falsifiable,</b> that is, it makes predictions about the natural world that are testable by experiments. Any disagreement between prediction and experiment demonstrates the incorrectness of the scientific theory, or at least limits its accuracy or domain of validity. Mathematical theorems, on the other hand, are purely abstract formal statements: the proof of a theorem cannot involve experiments or other empirical evidence in the same way such evidence is used to support scientific theories.|$|E
25|$|Relativity is a <b>falsifiable</b> theory: It makes {{predictions}} {{that can be}} tested by experiment. In the case of special relativity, these include the principle of relativity, the constancy {{of the speed of}} light, and time dilation. The predictions of special relativity have been confirmed in numerous tests since Einstein published his paper in 1905, but three experiments conducted between 1881 and 1938 were critical to its validation. These are the Michelson–Morley experiment, the Kennedy–Thorndike experiment, and the Ives–Stilwell experiment. Einstein derived the Lorentz transformations from first principles in 1905, but these three experiments allow the transformations to be induced from experimental evidence.|$|E
25|$|Creation {{science is}} not falsifiable: An idea or {{hypothesis}} {{is generally not}} considered to be in the realm of science unless it can be potentially disproved with certain experiments, this is the concept of falsifiability in science. The act of creation as defined in creation science is not <b>falsifiable</b> because no testable bounds can be imposed on the creator. In creation science, the creator is defined as limitless, with the capacity to create (or not), through fiat alone, infinite universes, not just one, and endow each one with its own unique, unimaginable and incomparable character. It is impossible to disprove a claim when that claim as defined encompasses every conceivable contingency.|$|E
25|$|Although {{procedures}} {{vary from}} one field of inquiry to another, they are frequently {{the same from}} one to another. The process of the scientific method involves making conjectures (hypotheses), deriving predictions from them as logical consequences, and then carrying out experiments or empirical observations based on those predictions. A hypothesis is a conjecture, based on knowledge obtained while seeking answers to the question. The hypothesis might be very specific, {{or it might be}} broad. Scientists then test hypotheses by conducting experiments or studies. A scientific hypothesis must be <b>falsifiable,</b> implying {{that it is possible to}} identify a possible outcome of an experiment or observation that conflicts with predictions deduced from the hypothesis; otherwise, the hypothesis cannot be meaningfully tested.|$|E
25|$|Popper {{regarded}} {{theories that}} have survived criticism as better corroborated {{in proportion to}} the amount and stringency of the criticism, but, {{in sharp contrast to the}} inductivist theories of knowledge, emphatically as less likely to be true. Popper held that seeking for theories with a high probability of being true was a false goal that is in conflict with the search for knowledge. Science should seek for theories that are most probably false on the one hand (which is the same as saying that they are highly <b>falsifiable</b> and so there are lots of ways that they could turn out to be wrong), but still all actual attempts to falsify them have failed so far (that they are highly corroborated).|$|E
500|$|Supporters of {{evolution}} argue that evolution is shown <b>falsifiable</b> by many conceivable lines {{of evidence that}} could falsify evolution, such as the fossil record showing no change over time, confirmation that mutations are prevented from accumulating, or observations showing organisms being created supernaturally or spontaneously. Many of Darwin's ideas and assertions of fact have been falsified as evolutionary science has developed and has continued to confirm his central concepts. [...] In contrast, creationist explanations involving the direct intervention of the supernatural {{in the physical world}} are not <b>falsifiable,</b> because any result of an experiment or investigation could be the unpredictable action of an omnipotent deity.|$|E
500|$|This {{integration}} {{results from}} the formulation of economic problems as stylized models with clear assumptions and <b>falsifiable</b> predictions. [...] This modeling may be informal or prosaic, {{as it was in}} Adam Smith's The Wealth of Nations, or it may be formal, rigorous and mathematical.|$|E
500|$|One {{consequence}} of the Duhem–Quine thesis is that one can make any theory compatible with any empirical observation {{by the addition of}} a sufficient number of suitable ad hoc hypotheses. Karl Popper accepted this thesis, leading him to reject naïve falsification. Instead, he favored a [...] "survival of the fittest" [...] view in which the most <b>falsifiable</b> scientific theories are to be preferred.|$|E
500|$|In his 1982 book, Abusing Science: The Case Against Creationism, philosopher {{of science}} Philip Kitcher {{specifically}} addresses the [...] "falsifiability" [...] question by {{taking into account}} notable philosophical critiques of Popper by Carl Gustav Hempel and Willard Van Orman Quine and provides a definition of theory other than {{as a set of}} <b>falsifiable</b> statements. As Kitcher points out, if one took a strictly Popperian view of [...] "theory," [...] observations of Uranus when it was first discovered in 1781 would have [...] "falsified" [...] Isaac Newton's celestial mechanics. Rather, people suggested that another planet influenced Uranus' orbit—and this prediction was indeed eventually confirmed. Kitcher agrees with Popper that [...] "there is surely something right in the idea that a science can succeed only if it can fail." [...] But he insists that we view scientific theories as consisting of an [...] "elaborate collection of statements," [...] some of which are not <b>falsifiable,</b> and others—what he calls [...] "auxiliary hypotheses," [...] which are.|$|E
500|$|The {{most direct}} {{evidence}} that evolutionary theory is <b>falsifiable</b> {{may be the}} original words of Charles Darwin in chapter 6 of On the Origin of Species: [...] "If it could be demonstrated that any complex organ existed, which {{could not possibly have}} been formed by numerous, successive, slight modifications, my theory would absolutely break down." [...] If empirical evidence supported this instance, it would be affirmation of the creationist argument in favor of irreducible complexity.|$|E
500|$|In Milkovich v. Lorain Journal Co. (1990), the Court {{ruled that}} the First Amendment offers no {{wholesale}} exception to defamation law for statements labeled [...] "opinion", but instead that a statement must be provably false (<b>falsifiable)</b> {{before it can be}} the subject of a libel suit. Nonetheless, {{it has been argued that}} Milkovich and other cases effectively provide for an opinion privilege. In consequence a significant number of states have enacted state opinion privilege laws.|$|E
500|$|Allan Mazur {{reviewed}} {{the book for}} the American Journal of Sociology. He called it an excellent and comprehensive survey, and said he found very few errors, though for instance squirrel monkeys did have dominance hierarchies. But he found the chapter on Man disappointing: it was trite, value-loaded, or wrong; used data uncritically, {{and seemed to be}} based on [...] "Gerhard and Jean Lenski's introductory textbook". Further, he agreed with Wilson that scientific theories must be <b>falsifiable,</b> and stated [...] "I claim that the bulk of Wilson's theorizing is not <b>falsifiable</b> and therefore is of little value." [...] This was because Wilson's [...] "theorizing" [...] was sometimes tautologous, sometimes hopelessly vague, and sometimes based on unobservable past events. For instance, Mazur argued that Wilson's claim that altruism has evolved in most social species is untestable: Mazur denied that a mother's action to save her baby is altruistic, as (by kin selection) it increases her own fitness. However, Mazur was glad that Wilson has [...] "legitimate the biological approach to sociology", even if other books like Robert Hinde's 1974 Biological Bases of Human Social Behaviour were of more use to sociologists.|$|E
500|$|Philosopher Karl Popper {{discussed}} the scientific standing of economics in the 1940s and 1950s. He argued that mathematical economics suffered from being tautological. In other words, insofar that economics became a mathematical theory, mathematical economics ceased {{to rely on}} empirical refutation [...] but rather relied on mathematical proofs and disproof. According to Popper, [...] <b>falsifiable</b> assumptions can be tested by experiment and observation while unfalsifiable assumptions can be explored mathematically for their consequences and for their consistency with other assumptions.|$|E
500|$|The text {{contains}} some claims {{that appear to}} be errors. Aristotle asserted that the females of any species have a smaller number of teeth than the males. This apparently readily <b>falsifiable</b> claim could have been a genuine observation, if as Robert Mayhew suggests women at that time had a poorer diet than men; but the claim is not true of other species either. Thus, Philippa Lang argues, Aristotle may have been empirical, but he was quite laissez-faire about observation, [...] "because [...] was not expecting nature to be misleading".|$|E
500|$|Astrology has not {{demonstrated}} {{its effectiveness}} in controlled studies {{and has no}} scientific validity. Where it has made <b>falsifiable</b> predictions under controlled conditions, they have been falsified. One famous experiment included 28 astrologers who were asked to match over a hundred natal charts to psychological profiles generated by the California Psychological Inventory (CPI) questionnaire. The double-blind experimental protocol {{used in this study}} was agreed upon by a group of physicists and a group of astrologers nominated by the National Council for Geocosmic Research, who advised the experimenters, helped ensure that the test was fair and helped draw the central proposition of natal astrology to be tested. They also chose 26 out of the 28 astrologers for the tests (two more volunteered afterwards). The study, published in Nature in 1985, found that predictions based on natal astrology were no better than chance, and that the testing [...] "...clearly refutes the astrological hypothesis." ...|$|E
500|$|In {{response}} to the unfalsifiability criticism of evolutionary theory, numerous examples of potential ways to falsify evolution have been proposed. J. B. S. Haldane, when asked what hypothetical evidence could disprove evolution, replied [...] "fossil rabbits in the Precambrian era." [...] Numerous other potential ways to falsify evolution have also been proposed. For example, the fact that humans have one fewer pair of chromosomes than the great apes offered a testable hypothesis involving the fusion or splitting of chromosomes from a common ancestor. The fusion hypothesis was confirmed in 2005 by discovery that human chromosome 2 is homologous with a fusion of two chromosomes that remain separate in other primates. Extra, inactive telomeres and centromeres remain on human chromosome 2 {{as a result of}} the fusion. The assertion of common descent could also have been disproven with the invention of DNA sequencing methods. If true, human DNA should be far more similar to chimpanzees and other great apes, than to other mammals. If not, then common descent is falsified. DNA analysis has shown that humans and chimpanzees share a large percentage of their DNA (between 95% to 99.4% depending on the measure). Also, the evolution of chimpanzees and humans from a common ancestor predicts a (geologically) recent common ancestor. Numerous transitional fossils have since been found. Hence, human evolution has passed several <b>falsifiable</b> tests.|$|E
2500|$|Sudden {{creation}} [...] "from nothing" [...] calls upon {{a supernatural}} intervention, not natural law, and is neither testable nor <b>falsifiable</b> ...|$|E
2500|$|The philosopher Karl Popper {{held that}} any {{scientific}} proposition must be <b>falsifiable,</b> {{in other words}} it must at least be possible to imagine an experiment whose outcome would disprove the hypothesis. Initially he thought that Charles Darwin's theory of natural selection (often summarized as [...] "the survival of the fittest") was untestable in this sense, and therefore [...] "almost tautological." [...] Popper later changed his view, concluding that the theory of natural selection is <b>falsifiable</b> and that Darwin's own example of the peacock's tail had disproved one extreme variation of it, that all evolution is driven by natural selection. Although in 1978 Popper wrote that his earlier objection had been specifically {{to the theory of}} natural selection, in lectures and articles from 1949 to 1974 he had stated that [...] "Darwinism" [...] or [...] "Darwin's theory of evolution" [...] was a [...] "metaphysical research programme" [...] because it was not <b>falsifiable.</b> In fact he continued to express dissatisfaction with contemporary statements of the theory of evolution which focused on population genetics, the study of the relative frequencies of alleles (different forms of the same gene). Unfortunately some of the adjustments he proposed resembled Lamarckianism or saltationism, evolutionary theories that were and still are considered obsolete, and evolutionary biologists therefore disregarded his criticisms. In 1981 Popper complained that he had been misinterpreted as saying that [...] "historical sciences" [...] such as paleontology or the history of evolution of life on Earth were not genuine sciences, when in fact he believed they could make <b>falsifiable</b> predictions.|$|E
2500|$|Nativism is {{sometimes}} {{perceived as being}} too vague to be <b>falsifiable,</b> {{as there is no}} fixed definition of when an ability is supposed to be judged [...] "innate". (As Jeffrey Elman and colleagues pointed out in Rethinking Innateness, it is unclear exactly how the supposedly innate information might actually be coded for in the genes.) [...] Further, modern nativist theory makes {{little in the way of}} specific testable (and <b>falsifiable)</b> predictions, and has been compared by some empiricists to a pseudoscience or nefarious brand of [...] "psychological creationism". As influential psychologist Henry L. RoedigerIII remarked that [...] "Chomsky was and is a rationalist; he had no uses for experimental analyses or data of any sort that pertained to language, and even experimental psycholinguistics was and is of little interest to him".|$|E
2500|$|Although the Copenhagen {{interpretation}} {{was originally}} most popular, quantum decoherence has gained popularity. [...] Thus the many-worlds interpretation {{has been gaining}} acceptance. [...] Moreover, the strictly formalist position, shunning interpretation, has been challenged by proposals for <b>falsifiable</b> experiments that might one day distinguish among interpretations, as by measuring an AI consciousness or via quantum computing.|$|E
2500|$|Searle calls {{any value}} {{judgment}} epistemically subjective. Thus, [...] "McKinley is prettier than Everest" [...] is [...] "epistemically subjective", whereas [...] "McKinley {{is higher than}} Everest" [...] is [...] "epistemically objective." [...] In other words, the latter statement is evaluable (in fact, <b>falsifiable)</b> by an understood ('background') criterion for mountain height, like 'the summit is so many meters above sea level'. No such criteria exist for prettiness.|$|E
2500|$|The word [...] "theory" [...] also {{exists in}} mathematics, to denote {{a body of}} {{mathematical}} axioms, definitions and theorems, as in, for example, group theory. There are also [...] "theorems" [...] in science, particularly physics, and in engineering, but they often have statements and proofs in which physical assumptions and intuition play an important role; the physical axioms on which such [...] "theorems" [...] are based are themselves <b>falsifiable.</b>|$|E
2500|$|Realist and constructivist {{theories}} are normally {{taken to be}} contraries. However, Karl Popper argued that a number statement such as [...] can be taken in two senses. In one sense it is irrefutable and logically true. In the second sense it is factually true and <b>falsifiable.</b> Another way of putting {{this is to say}} that a single number statement can express two propositions: one of which can be explained on constructivist lines; the other on realist lines.|$|E
2500|$|The {{second major}} argument, which {{takes up the}} final chapter, sets out to explain why Ashkenazi Jews have a mean IQ so much {{higher than that of}} the {{population}} in general. This argument had been published previously in an earlier paper that attracted wide media coverage, generating extensive criticism and praise. This final chapter prior to the book's conclusion has been described as [...] "a consistent, thorough, biological history—or perhaps, better, a consistent biological hypothesis of a specific history, and a <b>falsifiable</b> one to boot".|$|E
