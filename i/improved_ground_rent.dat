5000|$|As a legal term, <b>ground</b> <b>rent</b> {{specifically}} {{refers to}} regular payments {{made by a}} holder of a leasehold property to the freeholder or a superior Leaseholder, as required under a lease. In this sense, a <b>ground</b> <b>rent</b> is created when a freehold piece of land is sold on a long lease or leases. The <b>ground</b> <b>rent</b> provides an income for the landowner. In economics, <b>ground</b> <b>rent</b> {{is a form of}} economic rent meaning all value accruing to titleholders {{as a result of the}} exclusive ownership of title privilege to location.|$|R
5000|$|The State of Maryland {{maintains}} {{provisions for}} <b>ground</b> <b>rents,</b> {{primarily in the}} Baltimore area. The practice {{dates back to the}} seventeenth century, when lesserlords and serfs paid crops and livestock to feudal lords to rent the lord's land. With <b>ground</b> <b>rent,</b> homeowners only own the building itself, but they must pay a small amount to rent the land itself from its owner. Under Maryland law, if <b>ground</b> <b>rent</b> is not paid on time, the ground owner can go to court and have a lien placed against the house, effectively seizing the home from the homeowner over a relatively small amount due, sometimes as little as $24. This occurred almost 4,000 times in Baltimore City from 2000 to 2005. In addition, properties with <b>ground</b> <b>rent</b> are usually valued about $10,000 less than comparable properties without <b>ground</b> <b>rent.</b>|$|R

5000|$|In the Republic of Ireland <b>ground</b> <b>rents</b> {{have been}} a feature of urban life. While most tenancy reform {{legislation}} has been enacted for agricultural land (see Irish Land Acts), urban occupiers / tenants {{have been a}}llowed to [...] "buy out" [...] their <b>ground</b> <b>rents</b> from landlords, and so effectively change a long lease into a freehold interest, most recently under Acts of 1978 and 2005.

5000|$|Another {{definition}} for <b>ground</b> <b>rent</b> or absolute <b>ground</b> <b>rent</b> originates from the 18th-century French school of political economy called the Physiocrats. They sought to bring logical analysis {{to bear on}} governmental questions. They arrived at the conclusion that [...] "ground rents" [...] should {{be the source of}} most or all taxes. They defined <b>ground</b> <b>rent</b> as that portion of all rent which is attributable only to the size and location of the parcel. For instance, say you own a parcel of land. If everything you grew or built on that land burned [...] [...] [...] then you could still lease it out for its <b>ground</b> <b>rent</b> (its locational value). The Physiocrats noted that the owner is in no way responsible for any increase in the [...] "locational" [...] value of his parcel. A particular location is only made more valuable because more people come to live around it. Since it is society as a whole which gives <b>ground</b> <b>rent</b> its value [...] [...] [...] they reasoned that society should regain part of that value in tax revenue.|$|R

50|$|A <b>ground</b> <b>rent</b> being a {{freehold}} estate, {{created by}} deed, and perpetual in duration, no presumption {{that it had}} been released could, at common law, arise from lapse of time. However, by statute (Act of 27 April 1855, s. 7), a presumption of release or extinguishment is created where no payment, claim, or demand has been made for the rent, nor any declaration or acknowledgment of its existence made or given by the owner of the premises subject to it, for a period of twenty-one years. <b>Ground</b> <b>rents</b> were formerly irredeemable after a certain time, but the creation of irredeemable <b>ground</b> <b>rents</b> is now forbidden (Pennsylvania Act 7 Assembly, 22 April 1850).|$|R

25|$|When the Treaty of Nanking {{was signed}} in 1842 between Britain and China, the Portuguese {{government}} requested the Qing government to exempt them from the <b>ground</b> <b>rent.</b> The Qing authorities refused the request, but retained the preferentials that were already given to Portugal. However, on 20 November 1845, Maria II of Portugal unilaterally declared Macau a free port in which Portugal was exempt from <b>ground</b> <b>rent</b> and allowed merchant vessels of other countries to interact freely in Macau. After the new Governor of Macau, João Ferreira do Amaral, arrived in 1846, a series of colonial policies were enforced in Macau. In May 1846, Amaral demanded that all Chinese residents in Macau pay <b>ground</b> <b>rent,</b> poll tax and property tax, which broadened Portuguese rule in Macau over the Chinese residents. The Qing authorities in Macau immediately protested against Amaral's action and attempted to negotiate. However, beginning in 1849, Amaral expelled all Qing officials from Macau, destroyed the Qing Customs and stopped paying <b>ground</b> <b>rent</b> to the Qing government. Amaral's actions enraged the Chinese residents further, and he was assassinated on 22 August 1849.|$|R

Typically a lender on these properties would pay the <b>ground</b> <b>rent</b> and add it to the mortgage debt to avoid losing its rights to the property.|$|R

40|$|The present paper aims to {{demonstrate}} the role that <b>ground</b> <b>rent</b> has in establishing the agricultural land price. In {{order to be able}} to prove the connection between the <b>ground</b> <b>rent</b> and the agricultural land price, there are submitted to debate indicators that are part of <b>ground</b> <b>rent</b> such as the positioning of the land, the distance between the land and the access roads and water source, the intrinsic qualities of the land soil, the type of land and the manner of exploitation. The debate is intended to show how and in what manner the indicators part of <b>ground</b> <b>rent</b> may influence the price of an agricultural land. The final purpose of this study is to prove that a justified land price may contribute to encourage the agricultural land transactions and therefore to develop the land market. To fulfil the purpose of this paper it is necessary to understand what land ground means, why it is important the land price and how can the agricultural land price influence the agricultural land market and the development of the agriculture overall. The main methods utilized are collecting, analyze and interpreting data and information from the specialized literature. The conclusions formulated at the end of the study allow seeing the influence of <b>ground</b> <b>rent</b> on agricultural land price, the influence of the agricultural land price on agricultural land market and the influence of agricultural land market on the development of the agriculture...|$|R

40|$|The rent gap theory, a {{consistent}} explanation of gentrification in inner-city spaces, sees a growing disparity between capitalized <b>ground</b> <b>rent</b> (CGR) and potential <b>ground</b> <b>rent</b> (PGR) {{as a catalyst}} for large-scale property reinvestment and thence gentrification. In historical working-class Santiago’s peri-centre (inner city), not only is there a measurable rent gap, but a state-subsidized market in high-density urban renewal based on the accumulation of increased CGR by a few large-scale developers. This article focuses on a low-income municipality of Santiago, which has a local government that aims to attract this market via the liberalization of its local building regulations (seeking to increase the PGR), and deliberate underperformance in a national programme for housing upgrading (seeking to devalue the CGR in spaces previously targeted for renewal). It is observed how, in this city, two forms of <b>ground</b> <b>rent</b> exist, a lower one capitalized by current owner-occupiers (CGR- 1) and a higher one capitalized by the market agents of renewal (CGR- 2). This is seen as a form of social dispossession of the <b>ground</b> <b>rent</b> and a necessary condition for gentrification. It is concluded that the state-led strategy of urban renewal in Santiago needs to be refocused on more participative forms of distribution of the rent gap...|$|R
