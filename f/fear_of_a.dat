5|$|<b>Fear</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> Black Planet debuted {{at number}} 40 on the Billboard Top Pop Albums chart. It also charted for 10 weeks and reached number {{four in the}} United Kingdom, while in Canada, it charted for 28 weeks and reached number 15. By July 1990, it had sold 1.5 million copies in the US, where it {{ultimately}} peaked at number 10 and charted for 27 weeks on the Top Pop Albums. After 1991, when the tracking system Nielsen SoundScan began tracking domestic sales data, <b>Fear</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> Black Planet sold 561,000 additional copies by 2010.|$|E
5|$|A {{critical}} and commercial success in 1990, <b>Fear</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> Black Planet sold two {{million copies in}} the United States and received rave reviews from critics, many of whom named {{it one of the}} year's best albums. Its immediate success contributed significantly to the popularity of Afrocentric and political subject matter in hip hop and the genre's mainstream resurgence at the time. Since then, it has been viewed as one of hip hop's greatest and most important records, as well as being musically and culturally significant. In 2003, <b>Fear</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> Black Planet was ranked number 300 on Rolling Stones list of the 500 greatest albums of all time, and in 2005, the Library of Congress added it to the National Recording Registry.|$|E
5|$|<b>Fear</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> Black Planet {{features}} elaborate sound collages {{that incorporate}} varying rhythms, numerous samples, media sound bites, and eccentric loops, reflecting the songs' confrontational tone. Recorded during {{the golden age}} of hip hop, its assemblage of reconfigured and recontextualized aural sources preceded the sample clearance system that later emerged in the music industry. <b>Fear</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> Black Planet explores themes about organization and empowerment within the black community, social issues affecting African Americans, and race relations at the time. The record's criticism of institutional racism, White supremacy, and the power elite was partly inspired by Dr. Frances Cress Welsing's views on color.|$|E
50|$|In {{addition}} to <b>fears</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> nuclear {{war between the}} United States and the Soviet Union, during the Cold War, there were also <b>fears</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> direct, large scale conventional conflict between the two superpowers.|$|R

5|$|The {{project was}} {{eventually}} canceled by the Air Force in January 1959, seemingly out of <b>fear</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> negative public reaction {{and the risk}} to the population should anything have gone wrong with the launch. Another factor, cited by project leader Leonard Reiffel, was the possible implications of the nuclear fallout for future lunar research projects and colonization.|$|E
5|$|Baseball had {{for some}} time been living uneasily in the {{knowledge}} that bribes were being offered by gamblers, and that some players were accepting them. The players knew it was going on, and the owners knew it was going on. But more important, the players knew that the owners knew—and they knew the owners were doing nothing about it for <b>fear</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> scandal that might damage organized baseball. Under such conditions it quite obviously did not pay to be honest.|$|E
5|$|Déby faces armed {{opposition}} from {{groups who are}} deeply divided by leadership clashes but united in their intention to overthrow him. These forces stormed the capital on 13 April 2006, but were ultimately repelled. Chad's greatest foreign influence is France, which maintains 1,000 soldiers in the country. Déby relies on the French to help repel the rebels, and France gives the Chadian army logistical and intelligence support for <b>fear</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> complete collapse of regional stability. Nevertheless, Franco-Chadian relations were soured by the granting of oil drilling rights to the American Exxon company in 1999.|$|E

5|$|Hong Kong {{continued}} to experience modest growth {{during the first}} half of the 20th century. The University of Hong Kong was established in 1911 as the territory's first higher education institute. While there had been an exodus of 60,000 residents for <b>fear</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> German attack on the British colony during the First World War, Hong Kong remained unscathed. Its population increased from 530,000 in 1916 to 725,000 in 1925 and reached 1.6 million by 1941.|$|E
5|$|In <b>fear</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> crusade by Emeric, Ban Kulin of Bosnia held a synod of the Church of Bosnia at Bilino Polje on 6 April 1203. The synod {{acknowledged}} papal primacy {{and ordered}} the reform of the rites. Kulin also acknowledged Emeric's suzerainty. In a letter written in 1203, the Bulgarian tsar Kaloyan informed Pope Innocent that Emeric had occupied five districts in Bulgaria, and Kaloyan demanded the Pope's intervention.|$|E
5|$|The Australian {{public was}} shocked by the revelation by a turncoat Russian officer, who claimed that a direct {{engagement}} was secretly planned by Russia in case the Confederacy was recognised by Britain. The Russian navy had just paid Australia a visit in preparation for launching attacks. <b>Fear</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> possible military confrontation led to a massive buildup of coastal defences and to the acquisition of an ironclad warship.|$|E

5|$|The {{creation}} {{of nuclear weapons}} arose from scientific and political developments of the 1930s. The decade saw many new discoveries {{about the nature of}} atoms, including the existence of nuclear fission. The concurrent rise of fascist governments in Europe led to a <b>fear</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> German nuclear weapon project, especially among scientists who were refugees from Nazi Germany and other fascist countries. When their calculations showed that nuclear weapons were theoretically feasible, the British and United States governments supported an all-out effort to build them.|$|E
5|$|The {{project was}} never carried out, being {{cancelled}} primarily {{out of a}} <b>fear</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> negative public reaction, with the potential militarization of space that it would also have signified, and because a moon landing would undoubtedly be a more popular achievement {{in the eyes of}} the American and international public alike. A similar project by the Soviet Union also never came to fruition.|$|E
5|$|Though they {{maintained}} a formal neutrality policy {{in regards to}} religion, the French colonial administration began to regulate Islamic education in the early 1900s. In addition, <b>fear</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> pan-Islamism political rise throughout North Africa and the Sahel led the French to adopt policies that aimed {{to prevent the spread}} of Islam beyond where it already existed and to prevent Muslim leaders from governing non-Muslim communities. Indigenous religions and Christianity existed under less formal policies, and French efforts often used these to balance the spread of Islam in the region.|$|E

5|$|Apparently formidable, the Libyan {{military}} disposition in Chad was {{marred by}} serious flaws. The Libyans were prepared for a war {{in which they would}} provide ground and air support to their Chadian allies, act as assault infantry, and provide reconnaissance. By 1987, however, Muammar Gaddafi had lost his allies, exposing Libya's inadequate knowledge of the area. Libyan garrisons came to resemble isolated and vulnerable islands in the Chadian Sahara. Also important was the low morale among the troops, who were fighting in a foreign country, and the structural disorganization of the Libyan army, which was in part induced by Gaddafi's <b>fear</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> military coup against him. This fear led him to avoid the professionalization of the armed forces.|$|E
5|$|Due to the threat, the {{government}} of Honduras evacuated some of the 45,000 citizens on the Bay Islands and prepared all air and naval resources. The government of Belize issued a purple alert and asked for citizens on offshore islands {{to leave for the}} mainland. Because the hurricane threatened to strike near Belize City as a Category4 hurricane, much of the city was evacuated in <b>fear</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> repeat of Hurricane Hattie 37years earlier. Guatemala issued a purple alert as well, recommending boats to stay in port, telling people to prepare or seek shelter, and warning of potential overflowing rivers. By the time hurricane Mitch made landfall, numerous people were evacuated along the western Caribbean coastline, including 100,000 in Honduras, 10,000 in Guatemala, and 20,000 in the Mexican state of Quintana Roo.|$|E
5|$|Edward II's {{refusal to}} pay homage to the French king was based on concern for his royal sovereignty, but also on <b>fear</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> {{potential}} resurgence of domestic resistance. For this reason, he sent his wife Isabella to negotiate with King Charles, who was her brother. The Queen departed for France on 9 March 1325, and in September she was joined by her son, the heir to the throne, Prince Edward. Isabella's negotiations were successful, and it was agreed that the young Prince Edward would perform homage in the king's place, which he did on 24 September. Not long after this, Edmund joined the queen and prince in Paris. A circle of opposition was emerging around the queen, including the exiled Roger Mortimer. Edmund, who had previously been steadfast in his support for his half-brother, now joined the plot against the king. Though he still distrusted Mortimer, his hatred for the Despensers seems to have been even greater at this point. When Edmund, along with the others, ignored the king's order to return to England, his lands were confiscated in March 1326.|$|E

5|$|Mehmed {{had decided}} to {{construct}} a fortress {{in what is now}} Elbasan which would provide a perennial base for future Ottoman assaults on Skanderbeg's domains. The fortress especially worried Venice since Elbasan was constructed {{on the banks of the}} Shkumbin River which would allow the Ottomans to send ships into the Adriatic and threaten Venetian colonies. Seeing that his situation had become unfavorable, Skanderbeg made a trip to Italy where he would try to convince Pope Paul II and Ferdinand I of Naples to give him aid for his war. Despite many promises from the pope, Skanderbeg received little due to the <b>fear</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> Neapolitan war with Rome and infighting in the Roman Curia. Ferdinand and the Republic of Venice likewise deferred Skanderbeg's requests to the pope. By the time he left Italy, the League of Lezhë had been weakened and needed his intervention.|$|E
5|$|On 29 May, Deutschland was {{attacked}} by two Republican planes. It was claimed that their Soviet pilots had mistaken it for the Nationalist ship Canarias, or else had been fired upon by it. 32 sailors were killed, the Kriegsmarine's greatest loss {{of life in the}} war. After a retaliatory attack on Almeria (Valencia had been the original target, but minefields posed too great a problem), Germany came close to withdrawing from the agreement, but British diplomatic efforts to keep Germany patrolling prevailed. After the Germans claimed that Leipzig had been attacked by an unidentified submarine off Oran, it formally withdrew from international patrols to enforce the agreement. Republican minister of defense Indalecio Prieto considered a declaration of war on Germany, but Soviet <b>fear</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> world war prevented this.|$|E
5|$|Raspe, {{probably}} for <b>fear</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> libel suit from the real-life Baron von Münchhausen, never admitted his authorship of the book. It was often credited to Bürger, sometimes with an accompanying rumor that the real-life Baron von Münchhausen had met Bürger in Pyrmont and dictated the entire work to him. Another rumor, which circulated widely {{soon after the}} German translation was published, claimed {{that it was a}} competitive collaboration by three University of Göttingen scholars—Bürger, Abraham Gotthelf Kästner, and Georg Christoph Lichtenberg—with each of the three trying to outdo one another by writing the most unbelievable tale. The scholar Johann Georg Meusel correctly credited Raspe for the core text, but mistakenly asserted that Raspe had written it in German and that an anonymous translator was responsible for the English version. Raspe's authorship was finally proven in 1824 by Bürger's biographer, Karl Reinhard.|$|E
