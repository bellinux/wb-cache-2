40|$|ABSTRACT: The paper {{presents}} an innovative approach to integrate human and organisational factors (HOF) into risk analysis. The {{approach has been}} developed and applied to {{a case study in}} the maritime industry, {{but it can also be}} utilised in other sectors. A Bayesian Belief Network (BBN) has been developed to model the maritime transport system (MTS), by taking into account its different actors (i. e., ship-owner, shipyard, port and regulator) and their mutual influences. The last ones have been modelled by means of a set of variables whose combinations express the relevant functions performed by each actor. The Bayesian Belief Network model of the maritime transport system has been used in a case study for the quantification of human and organisational factors in the risk analysis carried out at the preliminary design stage of high speed craft (HSC). The analysis has focused on the frequency assessment of collision, <b>grounding,</b> <b>contact</b> and striking events by means of a Fault Tree Analysis (FTA). The approach allowed identification of probabilistic correlations between the basic events and the Bayesian Belief Network model of the maritime transport system, representing the operational and organisational scenario. The linkage can be exploited in different ways, especially to support identification and evaluation of risk control options also at the organisational level. Conditional probabilities for the Bayesian Belief Network have been estimated by means of experts ’ judgments, collected from an international panel of different European countries. Finally, a sensitivity analysis was carried out over the model to identify configurations of the maritime transport system leading to a significant reduction of accident probability during the operation of the high speed craft. 1...|$|E
40|$|The {{thesis is}} based on {{research}} carried out in Sierra Leone {{over a period of}} several years. An asymmetric field mill and a 'wide-angle' shielded receiver have been developed for the measurement of electric field and precipitation current in tropical thunderstorms. A detailed field-mill theory is presented which analyses the effects of leakage currents, inadequate <b>grounding,</b> <b>contact</b> potentials, conduction current, 'pick-up' of fluctuating electric fields and noise in the amplifier. Principles are deduced for the optimum design of a precision field mill using either a phase sensitive detector or an asymmetric signal. Measurements of precipitation current and its response to step changes in the field show that turbulent diffusion of splash droplets probably constitutes an important, even dominant, electrical process in heavy rain. The response of precipitation current to a lightning flash, averaged over many flashes, is large and has a delay of a few seconds. From the analysis of various models considered as a mechanism to explain the results it is deduced that charge carried on splash droplets is being diffused upwards by turbulence, transported by wind and is itself precipitating into the rain receiver. An experiment was performed to measure the electric current due to evaporation. The results show that the current due to evaporation in the presence of an electric field is much smaller than that due to conduction in air. The observation of a 'warm' thunderstorm cloud is reported. A project was developed to make visual and electrical measurements simultaneously on the same cloud. A time lapse film of tropical clouds, together with some electric field measurements beneath them, are used to discuss the flow pattern associated with a tropical thunderstorm and the mechanism by which it becomes charged. Appendices include an analysis of the shielding effect of a vertical rod at ground potential, the description of some further instrumentation, including a data processing system designed by the author which uses a novel but effective method of detecting the occurrence of the peak of a signal, more detailed mathematical derivations of equations used in the main text and a filming schedule for the time-lapse photography...|$|E
40|$|The aims of {{this study}} were to examine <b>ground</b> <b>contact</b> characteristics, their {{relationship}} with race performance, and the time course of any changes in <b>ground</b> <b>contact</b> time during competitive 800 m and 1500 m races. Twenty-two seeded, single-sex middle-distance races totalling 181 runners were filmed at a competitive athletics meeting. Races were filmed at 100 Hz. <b>Ground</b> <b>contact</b> time was recorded one step for each athlete, on each lap of their race. Forefoot and midfoot strikers had significantly shorter <b>ground</b> <b>contact</b> times than heel strikers. Forefoot and midfoot strikers had significantly faster average race speed than heel strikers. There were strong large correlations between <b>ground</b> <b>contact</b> time and average race speed for the women's events and men's 1500 m (r = - 0. 521 to - 0. 623; P < 0. 05), whereas the men's 800 m displayed only a moderate relationship (r = - 0. 361; P = 0. 002). For each event, <b>ground</b> <b>contact</b> time for the first lap was significantly shorter than for the last lap, which might reflect runners becoming fatigued...|$|R

30|$|GL muscle {{activity}} 50  ms {{prior to}} <b>ground</b> <b>contact</b> was greater during FFS cutting than during RFS cutting, demonstrating that muscle activity during plantar flexion {{of the foot}} was high prior to <b>ground</b> <b>contact.</b> In addition, pre-activation for eccentric contraction of the GL may have occurred to absorb the impending impact during <b>ground</b> <b>contact.</b> After <b>ground</b> <b>contact,</b> GL action was high, but TA muscle activity was low. FFS cutting simultaneously results in increased GL muscle activity and inhibited TA muscle activity. Anterior movement of the tibia decreases by 40  % during ankle joint plantarflexion compared with that during dorsiflexion, contributing to knee joint stability [19]. This suggests that increasing GL muscle activity during FFS might contribute to a decreased risk of ACL injury.|$|R

30|$|Mobile cranes {{overturn}} due {{to excessive}} lifting, heavy wind, or when appropriate <b>ground</b> <b>contact</b> pressure is not secured.

However, a precise review of <b>ground</b> <b>contact</b> stability requires expertise and is extremely time-consuming. Thus, this study develops automatic design algorithms for securing the ground stability of mobile cranes for easy and quick stability reviews.|$|R

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{investigate}} the relationship between biomechanical variables and running economy in North African and European runners. Eight North African and 13 European male runners of the same athletic level ran 4 -minute stages on a treadmill at varying set velocities. During the test, biomechanical variables such as <b>ground</b> <b>contact</b> time, swing time, stride length, stride frequency, stride angle and the different sub-phases of <b>ground</b> <b>contact</b> were recorded using an optical measurement system. Additionally, oxygen uptake was measured to calculate running economy. The European runners were more economical than the North African runners at 19. 5 km[*]·[*]h- 1, presented lower <b>ground</b> <b>contact</b> time at 18 km[*]·[*]h- 1 and 19. 5 km[*]·[*]h- 1 and experienced later propulsion sub-phase at 10. 5 km[*]·[*]h- 1, 12 km[*]·[*]h- 1, 15 km[*]·[*]h- 1, 16. 5 km[*]·[*]h- 1 and 19. 5 km[*]·[*]h- 1 than the European runners (P< 0. 05). Running economy at 19. 5 km[*]·[*]h- 1 was negatively correlated with swing time (r=- 0. 53) and stride angle (r=- 0. 52), whereas it was positively correlated with <b>ground</b> <b>contact</b> time (r= 0. 53). Within the constraints of extrapolating these findings, the less efficient running economy in North African runners may imply that their outstanding performance at international athletic events appears not to be linked to running efficiency. Further, the differences in metabolic demand seem to be associated with differing biomechanical characteristics during <b>ground</b> <b>contact,</b> including longer contact times...|$|R

30|$|An {{intriguing}} {{finding of}} the present study is that BF muscle activity also increased with GL muscle activity, 50  ms after <b>ground</b> <b>contact.</b> A previous study reported that ACL injuries occur within 50  ms of <b>ground</b> <b>contact</b> [20], demonstrating the importance of impact absorption. Regardless of the similarities in peak GRFs, the significant differences in knee valgus angles indicate that the vertical impact force occurring during RFS cutting may be absorbed by knee valgus.

40|$|Many species use coarse woody debris (CWD) and are {{disadvantaged}} by the forestry-induced loss of this resource. A neglected process affecting CWD is the {{covering of}} {{the surfaces of}} downed logs caused by sinking into the <b>ground</b> (increasing soil <b>contact,</b> mostly covering {{the underside of the}} log), and dense overgrowth by ground vegetation. Such cover is likely to profoundly influence the quality and accessibility of CWD for wood-inhabiting organisms, but the factors affecting covering are largely unknown. In a five-year experiment we determined predictors of covering rate of fresh logs in boreal forests and clear-cuts. Logs with branches were little covered because they had low longitudinal <b>ground</b> <b>contact.</b> For branchless logs, longitudinal <b>ground</b> <b>contact</b> was most strongly related to estimated peat depth (positive relation). The strongest predictor for total cover of branchless logs was longitudinal <b>ground</b> <b>contact.</b> To evaluate the effect on cover of factors other than longitudinal <b>ground</b> <b>contact,</b> we separately analyzed data from only those log sections that were in <b>contact</b> with the <b>ground.</b> Four factors were prominent predictors of percentage cover of such log sections: estimated peat depth, canopy shade (both increasing cover), potential solar radiation calculated from slope and slope aspect, and diameter of the log (both reducing cover). Peat increased cover directly through its low resistance, which allowed logs to sink and soil contact to increase. High moisture and low temperatures in pole-ward facing slopes and under a canopy favor peat formation through lowered decomposition and enhanced growth of peat-forming mosses, which also proved to rapidl...|$|R

40|$|Sprinting {{success is}} {{achieved}} by a fast start such that maximal horizontal 1 velocity can be achieved and maintained (Johnson and Buckley, 2000; Mann and Herman, 1985). Sprint velocity {{can be defined as}} the product of stride rate and stride length. Consequently, velocity can be increased by increasing stride rate or stride length or both; however, both factors are interdependent and individual morphologic and physiologic characteristics may influence the individual's motor abilities and utilization of the energy system (Coh et. al., 2001). Research indicates that elite and non-elite sprinters display significantly different joint angles during sprinting (Novacheck, 1998). It has been reported that world class sprinters demonstrate increases in stride length and cadence, thigh acceleration, trunk inclination, and trunk/thigh angle and decreases in components such as <b>ground</b> <b>contact</b> time, landing angle, and thigh angle (Kunz and Kaufmann, 1981). For instance, maximum knee flexion angles for elite and non-elite sprinters during the swing phase of sprinting reaches up to 130 ° and 105 °, respectfully (Novacheck, 1998). However, it is the ratio between the contact time and the flight time that is the most crucial factor in the kinematic structure of the sprinting stride. Successful sprinters demonstrated a shorter contact phase and longer flight phase than less successful sprinters (Coh et. al., 2001). Reaction time, technique, electromyographic (EMG) activity, force production, neural factors, and musculoskeletal structures are other biomechanical factors that can influence performance in sprinting (Mero et. al., 1992). Hypothetically, a successful sprinter must have the ability to exert great force against the surface of the ground in a shorter time period than a less successful sprinter, which indicates that the successful sprinter generates greater power or ground reaction forces (Alexander, 1989; Kunz and Kaufmann, 1981; Weyand et. al., 2000). Ground reaction forces are only achievable when the body is instantaneously in contact with the surface of the ground, therefore, a delicate balance of stride length and stride rate contributes to normal human locomotion and sprinting success. Nett (1964) studied foot contact during sprinting and reported that running speed influenced <b>ground</b> <b>contact.</b> He reported that initial <b>ground</b> <b>contact</b> occurred on the lateral aspect of the 5 th metatarsophalangeal joint, high on the ball. As the running speed decreased, the contact point shifted to a more posterior position, or toward the heel. This {{can be seen in the}} 400 -meter run, where <b>ground</b> <b>contact</b> shifts back toward the heel and foot plant is somewhat flatter. In distances greater than 1500 meters, the initial <b>ground</b> <b>contact</b> of the 2 foot occurs on the lateral edge of the longitudinal arch between the heel and the head of 5 th metatarsal. Nett further noted that during the load-phase of the <b>ground</b> <b>contact</b> of the foot, the heel strikes the ground, even in the case of sprinters; especially when the sprinters are fatigued (1964). Conversely, Mann (1980) and Novacheck (1998) reported that the heel of sprinters did not or "may never" touch the ground throughout the sprint, and that initial <b>ground</b> <b>contact</b> is dependent on gait speed, consequently, as speed increases initial contact changes from the hind-foot to the forefoot. This issue remains unclear because only five studies have involved examination of foot placement during sprinting and its effect on biomechanics of sprint performance (Nett, 1964; Mann, 1980; Payne, 1983; Novacheck, 1995, Novacheck, 1998). Differences between sprinters and non-sprinters have been observed biomechanically; however, present kinematic research generally does not extend to the influence of foot placement during the <b>ground</b> <b>contact</b> phase of the sprinting gait cycle. Although two main biomechanical factors - stride length and stride rate - have been widely accepted by researchers as key factors in sprint performance, it is also necessary to address the potential importance of foot placement during the <b>ground</b> <b>contact</b> phase. 3 Therefore, the purpose of this research study was to investigate <b>ground</b> foot <b>contact</b> and its effect on the biomechanics of the 200 m sprint...|$|R
