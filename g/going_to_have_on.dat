Animator Dan Povenmire noted that American audiences would probably require subtitles to understand what Brown was saying. Voice actress Yeardley Smith noted that she would like Brown to appear in The Simpsons, but Brown ruled a guest role out stating: [...] "I think Tony Blair did that, I don't think that is for me". Series creator Matt Groening confirmed that Brown would not be approached for a part.

5000|$|Roopa lives {{a wealthy}} {{lifestyle}} with her husband, Prakash Chandra, {{who works for}} her dad, Manoharlal Verma, and a daughter named Sharda alias Pinky. Roopa and Prakash do not get along and Roopa suspects that Prakash is having an affair. Her suspicious nature gets a boost when a woman named Sharda Dayal Sharma moves into a house next door. Roopa starts vile rumors about Sharda {{having an affair with}} Prakash. As a result of these rumors, no one is willing to marry Sharda, she is mocked by everyone in the community, and even loses her bank job. Sharda decides to teach Roopa a lesson by moving her belongings into her house, claiming that she is indeed Prakash's mistress. The surprising thing is Prakash agrees to this arrangement and permits her to live with them. Unable to assert herself, Roopa leaves the house and goes to live with her parents. Things are going well with Sharda, until one day when Pinky goes missing. Sharda hectically attempts to locate Pinky, but in vain. Then the police arrive to arrest Sharda on the charge of kidnapping Pinky and possibly killing her. The police indicate that they can prove that Sharda did indeed kidnap Pinky as she has a motive for continuing to live with Prakash as his mistress and wanted Pinky out of the way. The question remains did Sharda really have Pinky kidnapped and killed? If so, what effect is this <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>on</b> her relationship with Prakash? ...|$|E

British Columbia, for instance, faces 1996 federal cuts totalling $ 375 million — 5. 8 % of the province's health care budget.

40|$|Recent {{years have}} seen major changes in {{financial}} reporting worldwide under which the most obvious is the continuing adoption of IFRS worldwide. An upcoming economy on world economic map, India, too, decided to converge to International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS).

40|$|This paper {{discusses}} {{the benefits and}} drawbacks of caching and replication strategies in the WWW {{with respect to the}} Internet infrastructure. Bandwidth consumption, latency, and overall error rates are considered to be most important from a network point of view. The dependencies of these values with input parameters like degree of replication, document popularity, actual cache hit rates, and error rates are highlighted. In order to determine the influence of different caching and replication strategies on the behavior of a single proxy server with respect to these values, trace-based simulations are used. Since the overall effects of such strate- gies can hardly be decided with this approach alone, a mathematical model has been developed to deal with their influence on the network as a whole. Together, this two-tiered approach permits us to propose quantita- tive assessments on the influence different caching and replication proposals (are <b>going</b> <b>to)</b> <b>have</b> <b>on</b> the Inter- net infrastructure...|$|E
40|$|In {{the early}} nineties, when the “Bosman” case arose, sports {{authorities}} {{were faced with}} a great challenge. The widely accepted autonomy and self-regulation of the sports sector was at stake. If sports were {{to be treated as}} just an-other economic activity without exceptions and if its specific characteristics were not recognised, the whole athletic establishment would be endangered. Since then there were many efforts both from member states and from sports entities in order to establish the so called “sporting exemption” on a political level as well as before the European Court of Justice (henceforth ECJ). The “Olympique Lyonnais” case presents an opportunity for the ECJ to rule in favour of the existence of the exemption. Advocate General E. Sharpston delivered her Opinion on the 16 th of July 2009 supporting the exemption. The present contains a summary of this opinion as well as remarks on the effect that this case is <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>on</b> the athletic establishment if the ECJ adopts the Advocate General’s views on the matter...|$|E
