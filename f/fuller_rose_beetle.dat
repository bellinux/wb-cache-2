40|$|Photosynthetic rate {{measurements}} of the remaining leaf lamina tissue were taken from snap bean and corn plants after simulated Chinese <b>rose</b> <b>beetle,</b> Adoretus sinicus Burmeister, feeding. There was a linear decline in photosynthetic rate for snap bean leaves and a curvilinear decline for corn with increased amount of simulated feeding. Percent photosynthetic rate reduction for corn increased at a greater rate than for snap bean with increased defoliation. The differential feeding pattern on monocotyledonous (interveinal and veinal feeding) and dicotyledonous (interveinal feeding) plants by the Chinese <b>rose</b> <b>beetle</b> is suggested as evidence for the photosynthetic rate differences of snap bean and corn...|$|R

40|$|Bele (Abelmoschus manihot L.) is an {{indigenous}} and important leafy vegetable {{in the south}} Pacific region. However, herbivory by insects {{is a major problem}} in growing A. manihot. We investigated leaf damage by the Indian <b>rose</b> <b>beetle</b> (Adoretus versutus) in three selected cultivars NDASH LSQUOGreenRSQUO, LSQUORed BroadRSQUO and LSQUORed NarrowRSQUO of A. manihot at The University of South Pacific, Samoa. Plants of three ages (two months, four months and eight months old) were selected for this study. The level of herbivory by the beetle was measured by counting and measuring the number and size of holes in the top and bottom three leaves. The mean leaf area and shot-hole damage was higher in green compared to red cultivars. The number of shot holes per leaf was significantly higher in bottom leaves 23. 4 ± 2. 2 compared to top leaves 4. 5 ± 2. 7, suggesting that younger leaves were less preferred by the Indian <b>rose</b> <b>beetle</b> than older leaves. A positive relationship exists between herbivory and the age of plants. Since older plants are more attractive to the beetles, it is recommended to harvest the leaves before plants reach 8 -months...|$|R

Chinese <b>rose</b> <b>beetle,</b> Adoretus sinicus (Burmeister) (Coleoptera: Scarabaeidae: Adoretini), found in Asia and the Pacific Islands, was first {{reported}} in Hawaii (USA) in 1891. Adults feed at night on leaves {{of a wide range}} of plant species. Aggregate feeding can stunt or even kill host plants. Chinese <b>rose</b> <b>beetle</b> is one of the most serious pests of young cacao [Theobroma cacao L. (Malvaceae) ] trees, and has been a problem for orchard establishment in the developing cacao industry in Hawaii. One promising pesticide-free control method takes advantage of the avoidance of light by adult beetles when they select the plant on which they will feed at night. We tested the effectiveness of nighttime illumination provided by a portable solar-based light-emitting diode spotlight system as a means of reducing beetle populations on host plants, first using castor bean, Ricinus communis L. (Euphorbiaceae), as a test plant, followed by orchard-scale testing in young cacao orchards. Using Chi! nese rose beetle-populated castor bean plants, counts were made of numbers of beetles on both non-illuminated and illuminated plants. Nighttime illumination suppressed beetle numbers, with increased suppression associated with extended duration of illumination (number of nights) and with increased intensity of illumination: 2. 5 lux was sufficient to give > 50 % suppression, and 4. 0 lux was sufficient to give > 75 % suppression over 4 nights of illumination. In cacao orchard tests, there was over 93 % reduction of beetle numbers in each test orchard, following 4 nights of illumination. The results clearly show that nighttime illumination can be used as a means of reducing Chinese <b>rose</b> <b>beetle</b> population size, and presumed aggregate defoliation on a host plant. We believe that this is the first report of the use of nighttime illumination as a means of suppressing damage of plants by insects. Peer reviewed articl...|$|R

40|$|In Africa and {{surrounding}} Indian Ocean islands, {{several species of}} scarabaeids cause damage to sugarcane. Although many factors affect the number of ratoon crops obtained from sugarcane planting, scarabaeid infestations can drastically reduce {{the ability of the}} crop to ratoon. This factor is often neglected in assessments of scarabaeid damage. Despite the importance of white grubs as pests in sugarcane production, it is not known for certain how many species of white grub attack sugarcane in this region. White grub taxonomy is important for developing effective control tactics. This study seeks to identify and classify Scarabaeidae life forms collected from sugarcane fields. Pits were dug in sugarcane fields, across cane lines, uprooting sugarcane stools. Searches for all developmental stages of white grubs were done in soils around cane roots and soils removed from the pit. Larvae and pupae were transferred, singly, into labelled rearing vials containing moistened peat. The vials were incubated in the laboratory at ambient temperature and checked periodically to monitor development. Adults collected from pits and peat were kept in a freezer, in labelled transportation vials. Beetles were also collected from ultraviolet (UV) light traps at ZSAES, Triangle Ltd and Mwenezana estates. Four hundred and six samples were dispatched to Stellenbosch University for identification and classification. Some larvae collected from the field and reared in peat completed their life cycle under laboratory conditions. The scarabs included in the collection comprised chafer <b>beetles,</b> <b>rose</b> <b>beetles,</b> rhinoceros beetles and black maize beetles...|$|R
