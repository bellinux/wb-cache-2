50|$|Krumrie {{is perhaps}} remembered most for the {{severely}} broken leg he suffered during Super Bowl XXIII where the Bengals played the San Francisco 49ers. As Krumrie came off {{a block from}} 49er offensive linemen Jesse Sapolu and Randy Cross, he went to make a tackle on ballcarrier Roger Craig. When his foot was planted in the ground, the pressure his weight put on his ankle joint caused his lower leg to snap above the joint. The injury was severe enough that an <b>inflatable</b> <b>splint</b> had to be brought out onto the field to stabilize the leg and Krumrie {{was diagnosed with a}} broken tibia and fibula. Despite his injury, Krumrie refused to go to the hospital, insisting on staying in the locker room and watching the game on television, only leaving when the paramedics told him he might go into shock. After a 15-inch steel rod was surgically implanted to stabilize the leg, Krumrie was ready by the 1989 regular season.|$|E

40|$|PAN - {{at is the}} {{proactive}} therapeutic approach using <b>inflatable</b> <b>splints</b> {{and other}} clinical tools, applied in neurorehabilitation. The approach uses repetitive training and goal-oriented activities to recover motor and sensory functions after damage of central nervous system. This bachelor's thesis dealt with {{the description of the}} approach on theoretical level and its practical applications. On this basis was created the manual of exercises with <b>inflatable</b> <b>splints</b> Urias, which will be available to patiens of Rehabilitation Medicine Clinic in Prag. The theoretical part was developed on base of analyses of literature. There was set up a comprehensive text describing the history of the approach, its neurophysiological background, characteristics and possibilities of its utilization. The practical part checked up effects of therapy. Research sample was consisted of five persons after traumatic brain injury or stroke. Therapies took place in average twice a week. The total period of practical application lasted for five weeks. To obtain the results of the therapy there were used goniometry, sensitivity investigation and modified Ashworth scale. Effects of the therapy was more described in two case studies. This thesis confirmed effects of PAN - at characterized in available literature. There were noticed [...] ...|$|R
40|$|The {{pressure}} to which splints were inflated was measured {{to determine whether}} splintage was effective and if vascular complications were likely. The prevalence of their use by the ambulance service was also investigated. The findings indicate that <b>inflatable</b> <b>splints</b> are in common use, and are rarely inflated to pressures likely to cause vascular complications. However, they are extremely inefficient in holding their pressure and rapidly become ineffective as splints. The therapeutic range between effective splinting and risk of complications is narrow and {{it is recommended that}} blow-off valves are incorporated into the manufacture of all such devices...|$|R

Deep vein thromboses were diagnosed by the 125 I-fibrinogen uptake test. Peroperative intermittent compression was achieved {{by means of an}} <b>inflatable</b> plastic <b>splint</b> coupled to a pneumatic controller.

40|$|This {{bachelor}} {{thesis is}} about the importance and possibilities of positioning of patients after stroke. The thesis is divided into theoretical part and practical part. The theoretical part deals with a summary of theoretical knowledge about stroke and possibilities of positioning patients after stroke. There is a more detailed description of antispastic positions, {{which are based on}} the Bobath concept. The thesis also includes information about other ways of positioning, which are positioning based on the concept of basal stimulation, positioning using <b>inflatable</b> <b>splints,</b> canistherapy and the suitable supply of information to the patient. The aim of the practical part of the thesis is to evaluate the importance of positioning of patients after stroke by comparing the entry and exit examination and suggest short and long term rehabilitation plan for patients. In practical part was chosen qualitative research a case study that was performed with 5 patients after stroke. Patients were selected randomly during my practice in hospital in České Budějovice at the Neurological and Rehabilitation Department. Data collection was performed processing of case studies, which used the method of observation, interviewing patients and nursing staff and secondary data analysis. Each case report contains anamnesis, entry and exit examinations, proposal of short and long term rehabilitation plan and information about therapy, which patients participated. The results of the thesis show that physical conditions were improved by patients described in case studies 1, 2 and 3. Patients 1 and 3 also improved their psychological conditions. The patient described in the case study 2 did not have any psychological problem {{at the beginning of the}} research. The physical and psychological conditions were not improved by patients 4 and 5, but avoid the formation of pressure ulcers and to reduce passive range of motion. Improvement by patients 1, 2 and 3 can be caused by favourable prognosis early in the disease and also care of multidisciplinary team. Against to this by patients 4 and 5 was the prognosis unfavourable...|$|R
40|$|Background. We {{investigated}} {{the effects of}} different intensities of arm and leg rehabilitation training on the functional recovery of {{activities of daily living}} (ADL), walking ability, and dexterity of the paretic arm, in a single-blind randomised controlled trial. Methods. Within 14 days after stroke onset, 101 severely disabled patients with a primary middle-cerebral-artery stroke were randomly assigned to: a rehabilitation programme with emphasis on arm training; a rehabilitation programme with emphasis on leg training; or a control programme in which the arm and leg were immobilised with an <b>inflatable</b> pressure <b>splint.</b> Each treatment regimen was applied for 30 min, 5 days a week during the first 20 weeks after stroke. In addition, all patients underwent a basic rehabilitation programme. The main outcome measures were ability in ADL (Barthel index), walking ability (functional ambulation categories), and dexterity of the paretic arm (Action Research aim test) at 6, 12, 20, and 26 weeks. Analyses were by intention to treat. Findings. At week 20, the leg-training group (n = 31) had higher scores than the control group (n = 37) for ADL ability (median 19 [IQR 16 - 20] vs 16 [10 - 19], p < 0. 05) ], walking ability (4 [3 - 5] vs 3 [1 - 4], p < 0. 05), and dexterity (2 [0 - 56] vs 0 [0 - 2], p < 0. 01). The arm-training group (n = 33) differed significantly from the control group only in dexterity (9 [0 - 39] vs 0 [0 - 2], p < 0. 01). There {{were no significant differences in}} these endpoints at 20 weeks between the arm-training and leg training groups. Interpretation. Greater intensity of leg rehabilitation improves functional recovery and health-related functional status, whereas greater intensity of arm rehabilitation results in small improvements in dexterity, providing further evidence that exercise therapy primarily induces treatment effects on the abilities at which training is specifically aimed...|$|R
40|$|Background: After a stroke, a {{considerable}} proportion of people experience upper limb (UL) impairments, which may affect their {{activities of daily}} living. Focal spasticity is common, for which botulinum toxin-type A (BTX-A) is used increasingly. However, published randomised controlled trials have not used valid outcome measures to assess the effects of BTX-A on spasticity and have hardly explored its impact on UL function. The primary aim of this thesis was to investigate whether task-specific UL practice {{in the form of}} an evidence-based, functional skill acquisition programme, administered after BTX-A, would have any differential effects on upper limb spasticity or functional UL activity in people more than six months after stroke. The prerequisites were to: 1) clarify the definition of "spasticity", 2) pilot a novel biomechanical spasticity measurement device, 3) standardise the assessment of arm function, 4) systematically review the literature on the effects of BTX-A and 5) compile an evidence- and theory-based skill acquisition programme. Methods: Design: randomised controlled feasibility study with four repeated measures and a blinded assessor. Fourteen participants (time after stroke: range 1. 4 - 11. 0 years) gave informed consent and were randomised into either the experimental group (EG: BTX-A plus skill acquisition) or the placebo control group (CG: BTX-A plus <b>inflatable</b> arm <b>splint).</b> Outcome measures were: Action Research Arm Test, Canadian Occupational Performance Measure, grip force of the affected hand, Stroke Impact Scale, EMG of the elbow flexors, biomechanically measured resistance to passive movement and Ashworth scale. Outcomes were assessed at baseline and weeks 4, 7 and 13 following BTX-A injection. Differences in change between the two groups were analysed using the Mann-Whitney U-test. Applying the Bonferroni correction for three repeated measures yielded a critical p-value of 0. 017. Results: At baseline, there were no significant differences between the two groups in any of the dependent variables. Compared to the CG, the EG improved in self-reported hand function between baseline and week 4 (median change 25 %, range 0 to 30 % vs. CG: median change 0 %, range - 10 to 0 %; p= 0. 04). The EG also improved in arm function between baseline and week 7 (median ARA T change 4 points, range 1 to 8 points vs. CG: median change - 1 point, range - 3 to 0 points; p= 0. 003) as well as in self-reported ADL between baseline and week 13 (median change 11. 3 %, range 5 to 20 % vs. CG: median change 0 %, range - 2. 5 to 5 %; p= 0. 02). Only the differential improvement in ARAT by the EG reached statistical significance. There were no significant differences between the two groups in any of the other outcome measures. Although the programme was perceived as intensive, most participants in the experimental group had found the intervention to be enjoyable. Conclusion: The main finding of this study was that people with severe and chronic upper limb spasticity may still improve in functional activity involving their affected arm, using a combination of BTX-A and a functional skill acquisition programme - without exacerbating spasticity. BTX-A alone did not improve upper limb activity in this study. Implications for clinical practice and research were discussed. EThOS - Electronic Theses Online ServiceGBUnited Kingdo...|$|R
