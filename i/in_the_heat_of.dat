5|$|Richard Nixon's jowly, beard-shadowed face, the {{ski-jump}} {{nose and}} the widow's peak, the arms upstretched in the V-sign, {{had been so}} often pictured and caricatured, his presence had become such a familiar one in the land, {{he had been so}} often <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>heat</b> <b>of</b> controversy, that it was hard to realize the nation really would not 'have Nixon to kick around anymore'.|$|E
5|$|The slag melts <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>heat</b> <b>of</b> the furnace. In {{the bottom}} of the furnace, the molten slag floats on top of the denser molten iron, and {{apertures}} {{in the side of the}} furnace are opened to run off the iron and the slag separately. The iron, once cooled, is called pig iron, while the slag can be used as a material in road construction or to improve mineral-poor soils for agriculture.|$|E

5|$|A {{new problem}} confronted the Confederates. The {{dead and wounded}} of Grant's army lay <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>heat</b> <b>of</b> Mississippi summer, the odor of the {{deceased}} men and horses fouling the air, the wounded crying for medical help and water. Grant first refused a request of truce, thinking it a show of weakness. Finally he relented, and the Confederates held their fire while the Union recovered the wounded and dead, soldiers from both sides mingling and trading as if no hostilities existed for the moment.|$|E
5|$|After Sebastian Vettel's {{surprise}} victory {{two weeks}} prior in Malaysia, {{eyes were on}} Ferrari whether {{they would be able}} to continue their good race pace in China and challenge the Mercedes for the win. As lower track temperatures were expected for the race, a serious competitiveness of Ferrari was cast into doubt, as they had benefited from lower tyre degradation <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>heat</b> <b>of</b> Malaysia. All ten teams taking part in the championship participated in the race, with Marussia hoping to finally be able to run both cars continually, after Will Stevens had failed to start in Malaysia.|$|E
5|$|Basiliscus fled <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>heat</b> <b>of</b> the battle. One {{half of the}} Roman fleet was burned, sunk, or captured, and {{the other}} half {{followed}} the fugitive Basiliscus. The whole expedition had failed. Heraclius effected his retreat through the desert into Tripolitania, holding the position for two years until recalled; Marcellinus retired to Sicily, where he was reached by Basiliscus; the general was, however, assassinated, perhaps at the instigation of Ricimer, by one of his own captains; and the king of the Vandals expressed his surprise and satisfaction, that the Romans themselves would remove from the world his most formidable antagonists.|$|E

5|$|Chavrusa {{learning}} {{tends to}} be loud and animated, as the study partners read the Talmudic text and the commentaries aloud {{to each other and}} then analyze, question, debate, and defend their points of view to arrive at a mutual understanding of the text. <b>In</b> <b>the</b> <b>heat</b> <b>of</b> discussion, they may wave their hands or even shout at each other. Depending {{on the size of the}} yeshiva, dozens or even hundreds of chavrusas can be heard discussing and debating each other's opinions. One of the skills of chavrusa learning is the ability to block out all other discussions in the study hall and focus on one's study partner alone.|$|E
5|$|For their {{action on}} December 7, the U.S. War Department in Communiqué No. 19 on December 13, 1941, {{designated}} Taylor and Welch {{as the first}} two American heroes of World War II, and awarded both the Distinguished Service Cross on January 8, 1942. Taylor learned {{that he was to}} receive the award in mid-December after reading several newspapers. The award is the United States Army's second highest honor for valor <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>heat</b> <b>of</b> combat. Additionally, he later received the Distinguished Service Medal, the Legion of Merit, the Air Medal, and a Purple Heart for injuries he sustained. Both men were recommended for the Medal of Honor, but were turned down because they had taken off without orders.|$|E

The next day she shot a scene with Miles Long in Joey Silvera's Service Animals 4. A few months later, {{she realized that she}} did not need an agent and started to represent herself.|$|E

5|$|I'itoi {{onion is}} a {{prolific}} multiplier onion cultivated in the Baboquivari Peak Wilderness, Arizona area. This small-bulb type has a shallot-like flavour and {{is easy to}} grow and ideal for hot, dry climates. Bulbs are separated, and planted in the fall 1in below the surface and 12in apart. Bulbs will multiply into clumps and can be harvested throughout the cooler months. Tops die back <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>heat</b> <b>of</b> summer and may return with heavy rains; bulbs can remain in the ground or be harvested and stored in a cool dry place for planting in the fall. The plants rarely flower; propagation is by division.|$|E
5|$|In 1451, Mehmed {{was focused}} on {{defeating}} the Karamanids and Menteşe in the East, {{but it was in}} his intentions to return to Albania. During this brief period of rest, Skanderbeg took up the rebuilding of Krujë and erected a new fortress in Modrica in the Drin Valley near Svetigrad (which had been lost in a 1448 siege) where Turkish forces had previously slipped through unhindered. The fortress was constructed <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>heat</b> <b>of</b> summer within a few months when few Turkish posts were present. This came as a huge blow to Ottoman efforts whose Albanian operations were thus inhibited.|$|E
5|$|Most ancient Egyptians were farmers {{tied to the}} land.

Each home had a kitchen with an open roof, which contained a grindstone for milling grain and a small oven for baking the bread. Walls were painted white and could be covered with dyed linen wall hangings. Floors were covered with reed mats, while wooden stools, beds raised {{from the floor and}} individual tables comprised the furniture.|$|E

After Steiger's performance in The Pawnbroker in 1964, in which he played an embittered Jewish Holocaust survivor working as a pawnbroker in New York City, he portrayed an opportunistic Russian politician in David Lean's Doctor Zhivago (1965). <b>In</b> <b>the</b> <b>Heat</b> <b>of</b> the Night (1967) won five Academy Awards, including Best Picture and Best Actor for Steiger, who was lauded for his performance as a Mississippi police chief who learns to respect an African-American officer (Poitier) as they search for a killer. The following year, he played a serial killer of many guises in No Way to Treat a Lady.|$|E
5|$|The {{system worked}} as follows. The animal's sense organ is altered when it detects an object. This causes a perceptual {{change in the}} animal's seat of sensation, which Aristotle {{believed}} was the heart, not as we now think the brain. This in turn causes {{a change in the}} heart's heat, which causes a quantitative change sufficient to make the heart transmit a mechanical impulse to a limb, which moves, moving the animal's body. The alteration <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>heat</b> <b>of</b> the heart also causes a change in the consistency of the joints, which helps the limb to move.|$|E

5|$|With the Fatimids and Kalb poised against him, Hassan {{appealed for}} Salih's help to {{maintain}} their tribes' virtual autonomy throughout Syria against Fatimid encroachment. Accordingly, Salih mobilized his Kilabi forces to reinforce the Tayy in Palestine. Salih and Hassan first encountered the Fatimid–Kalb army {{in the vicinity of}} Gaza, but, unable to halt their advance, they withdrew to the north. On 12 or 25 May 1029, the two sides fought at al-Uqhuwanah, on the eastern shores of Lake Tiberias. For unknown reasons, Hassan and his forces fled <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>heat</b> <b>of</b> battle, leaving Salih and his men to face off Anushtakin's army alone. The Kilab were decisively defeated and Salih, his youngest son and his vizier were slain.|$|E
5|$|Wristwatches {{were first}} worn by {{military}} men {{towards the end}} of the nineteenth century, when the importance of synchronizing manoeuvres during war without potentially revealing the plan to the enemy through signalling was increasingly recognized. It was clear that using pocket watches while <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>heat</b> <b>of</b> battle or while mounted on a horse was impractical, so officers began to strap the watches to their wrist. The Garstin Company of London patented a 'Watch Wristlet' design in 1893, although they were probably producing similar designs from the 1880s. Clearly, a market for men's wristwatches was coming into being at the time. Officers in the British Army began using wristwatches during colonial military campaigns in the 1880s, such as during the Anglo-Burma War of 1885.|$|E
