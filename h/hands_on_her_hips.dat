2500|$|In 1989, Unger curated a {{show called}} “In a Dark Vein,” at the Sculpture Center in New York. It {{featured}} work by women who used the human figure to shape feelings of fear, loss, and pain and was inspired by Unger's own struggle with cancer. [...] In this show, she {{tried to focus on}} a more naked and physical reality and the search for experience that is shared and elemental. [...] Unger included her bonded iron sculpture, Guardian, which both expresses and mediates suffering. [...] It shows a nude woman, cut off at the waist, with her <b>hands</b> <b>on</b> <b>her</b> <b>hips.</b> [...] The sculpture's mouth is like a pit facing the sky and her arms are like wings. [...] The earthly figure suggests a fertility goddess insisting on her ability to reproduce and crying to get out of her skin. “In a Dark Vein” was filled with representations of the female body shaped by a woman’s hand.|$|E

60|$|And {{having said}} that she turned <b>on</b> <b>her</b> heel and slowly walked away, leaving behind her an ocean of desolation. She walked away--with a slow, {{swinging}} stride, one <b>hand</b> <b>on</b> <b>her</b> <b>hip,</b> <b>her</b> head thrown back.|$|R

60|$|James {{approached}} Miss Forrester with {{a beating}} heart. She made a charming picture {{as she stood}} there in the sunlight, one <b>hand</b> <b>on</b> <b>her</b> <b>hip,</b> the other swaying a tennis racket.|$|R
6000|$|She pointed {{dramatically}} at the door, but {{the woman}} retained her position, only moving to cuff the boy, who was kicking Henderson on his shins. Then, setting her <b>hands</b> <b>on</b> <b>her</b> <b>hips</b> she said defiantly: ...|$|E
60|$|Bostil's sister came in {{from the}} kitchen. She was a huge person with a severe yet motherly face. She had her <b>hands</b> <b>on</b> <b>her</b> <b>hips,</b> and she cast a rather disapproving glance at father and daughter.|$|E
6000|$|... "He came {{in about}} five minutes ago," [...] said the furmity woman, joining the rest with her <b>hands</b> <b>on</b> <b>her</b> <b>hips.</b> [...] "And then 'a stepped back, and then 'a looked in again. I'm not a penny the better for him." ...|$|E
50|$|Lean: The {{base and}} flyer stand side by side, with the base's <b>hand</b> <b>on</b> <b>her</b> <b>hip.</b> The base lunges sideways, {{away from the}} flyer, holding <b>her</b> <b>hip</b> to his. She keeps one leg {{straight}} and styles with the other, often a figure-4 knee bend.|$|R
60|$|She stood {{blocking}} up the doorway with <b>her</b> <b>'ands</b> <b>on</b> <b>her</b> <b>'ips,</b> while I explained, with Kumbo still 'anging {{on my arm}} and a crowd collecting behind, and the more I explained, the more I could see she didn't believe a word of it.|$|R
5000|$|Azure a {{sailing ship}} with three masts Argent, with pennants Or, on {{waves of the}} second; and in base a mermaid [...] crowned, crined and tailed of the third, with <b>her</b> {{sinister}} <b>hand</b> <b>on</b> <b>her</b> <b>hip</b> and maintaining in her dexter hand a salmon of the second.|$|R
60|$|She had {{nodded to}} Andor, but by tacit consent {{they had not}} shaken hands. Klara now put her <b>hands</b> <b>on</b> <b>her</b> <b>hips,</b> and, like a young animal let free after days of captivity, she drew in deep breaths of sweet-scented air.|$|E
60|$|I {{enjoyed it}} so little, indeed, that I fell to poking the sitting-room fire {{when she entered}} with the Mercury; and read the Mercury assiduously while she brought in breakfast. She set down the tray with a slam and stood beside it, her <b>hands</b> <b>on</b> <b>her</b> <b>hips,</b> her whole {{attitude}} breathing challenge.|$|E
60|$|When he thus spoke we were come {{opposite}} a small, rude dwelling situate in {{one corner}} of a pasture wherein even a sheep would have found it difficult to satisfy its hunger, and in the door of this building stood a motherly looking old woman, her <b>hands</b> <b>on</b> <b>her</b> <b>hips,</b> and her eyes fixed on us in curiosity, as I fancied.|$|E
60|$|The moment I {{opened the}} door I see there was {{something}} wrong. Three times my missis licked 'er lips afore she could speak. Her face 'ad gone a dirty white colour, and she was leaning forward with <b>her</b> <b>'ands</b> <b>on</b> <b>her</b> <b>'ips,</b> trembling all over with temper.|$|R
5000|$|..... {{just like}} a doll, she was, but alive. Her hair was red, her sarafan blue, and she held a blue kerchief in her hand. She looked around them merrily and her teeth sine white. Then she put one <b>hand</b> <b>on</b> <b>her</b> <b>hip,</b> raised the blue kerchief with the other and began to dance.|$|R
5000|$|The {{painting}} depicts May, a tattooed black-haired woman, {{smoking a}} pipe. May is coolly scrutinizing the viewer, <b>her</b> other <b>hand</b> <b>on</b> <b>her</b> <b>hip,</b> with <b>her</b> trousers unbuttoned such that her pubic hair is visible. McCall's intention in painting May {{was to explore}} [...] "how women choose to express their sexual identity beyond the male gaze".|$|R
6000|$|The {{woman with}} the coffee-pot here faced about, stood up, and, either from design or some odd coincidence, fell into the same dogged {{attitude}} {{that her husband had}} previously taken, except that she rested her <b>hands</b> <b>on</b> <b>her</b> <b>hips.</b> She was prematurely aged, like many of her class, and her black, snake-like locks, twisting loose from her comb as she lifted her head, showed threads of white against the firelight. Then with slow and implacable deliberation she said: ...|$|E
6000|$|The {{waitress}} {{was instantly}} back with soup, {{and a collection}} of china gathered by a man of much travel, catholic interests, and no taste. One of the plates alleged itself to belong to a hotel in Omaha. She pushed a pitcher of condensed milk to the exact spot where it would catch Mr. Boltwood's sleeve, brushed the crumb from in front of Claire to a shelter beneath the pink and warty sugar bowl, recovered a toothpick which had been concealed behind her glowing lips, picked for a while, gave it up, put her <b>hands</b> <b>on</b> <b>her</b> <b>hips,</b> and addressed Claire: ...|$|E
60|$|But {{the most}} terrible ordeal was to come. Elizabeth had latterly been {{accustomed}} of an afternoon to present a cup of cider or ale and bread-and-cheese to Nance Mockridge, {{who worked in the}} yard wimbling hay-bonds. Nance accepted this offering thankfully at first; afterwards as a matter of course. On a day when Henchard was on the premises he saw his step-daughter enter the hay-barn on this errand; and, as there was no clear spot on which to deposit the provisions, she at once set to work arranging two trusses of hay as a table, Mockridge meanwhile standing with her <b>hands</b> <b>on</b> <b>her</b> <b>hips,</b> easefully looking at the preparations on her behalf.|$|E
40|$|Photograph of the {{painting}} "Fair Musician" by Le Roux, depicting {{a woman with a}} lute, [s. d. ]. The woman is shown at center in a toga and bead necklace that seems to allude to the 'flapper' style of the 1920 's. Her left leg is raised, and she rests the body of the lute <b>on</b> <b>her</b> thigh and <b>her</b> free <b>hand</b> <b>on</b> <b>her</b> <b>hip.</b> <b>Her</b> hair is dark and blends in with the background, while her eyes are so heavily shadowed that her pupils cannot be seen. She smiles...|$|R
50|$|Jan Hunt (born 15 February 1938) is a British comedian, {{actress and}} Music Hall performer, who {{appeared}} on BBC television series Crackerjack with Michael Aspel, Ed Stewart, Peter Glaze and Don Maclean in the 1970s. She would often be seen playing {{an old lady}} in dramatisations, involving her donning a grey wig and glasses and putting <b>her</b> <b>hand</b> <b>on</b> <b>her</b> <b>hip</b> to suggest a bad back.|$|R
50|$|On Demetrius, Anders {{returns from}} a recon flight and finds Leoben with Starbuck, guiding {{her hand in}} {{painting}} her mural - his other <b>hand</b> <b>on</b> <b>her</b> <b>hip.</b> Anders furiously rips Leoben {{away from her and}} Starbuck protests the intrusion. As the guards take Leoben away, Helo steps in and reminds Starbuck of the months of mind-games that Leoben played <b>on</b> <b>her</b> back <b>on</b> New Caprica, but she argues that Leoben can help find Earth.|$|R
60|$|But {{the object}} of all this eloquence {{was the cause of}} the first and only quarrel between the gentle {{schoolmaster}} and his spouse; for the learned man had dug out of one of his old books the name of Amyntas, and Amyntas he vowed should be the name of his son; so with that trisyllable he finished every stanza of his ode. His wife threw her head back, and, putting her <b>hands</b> <b>on</b> <b>her</b> <b>hips,</b> stood with arms akimbo; she said that never in all her born days had she heard of anyone being called by such a name, which was more fit for a heathen idol than for a plain, straightforward member of the church by law established. In its stead she suggested that the boy be called Peter, after his father, or John, after hers. The gentle schoolmaster was in the habit of giving way to his wife in all things, and it may be surmised that this was the reason why the pair had lived in happiest concord; but now he was firm! He said it was impossible to call the boy by any other name than Amyntas.|$|E
6000|$|The woman {{snatched}} it angrily. 'I was foolish,' said she. 'Who is thy {{woman in the}} Plains? Fair or black? I was fair once. Laughest thou? Once, long ago, if thou canst believe, a Sahib looked on me with favour. Once, long ago, I wore European clothes at the Mission-house yonder.' She pointed towards Kotgarh. 'Once, long ago. I was Ker-lis-ti-an and spoke English--as the Sahibs speak it. Yes. My Sahib said he would return and wed me--yes, wed me. He went away--I had nursed {{him when he was}} sick--but he never returned. Then I saw that the Gods of the Kerlistians lied, and I went back to my own people ... I have never set eyes on a Sahib since. (Do not laugh at me. The fit is past, little priestling.) Thy face and thy walk and thy fashion of speech put me in mind of my Sahib, though thou art only a wandering mendicant to whom I give a dole. Curse me? Thou canst neither curse nor bless!' She set her <b>hands</b> <b>on</b> <b>her</b> <b>hips</b> and laughed bitterly. 'Thy Gods are lies; thy works are lies; thy words are lies. There are no Gods under all the Heavens. I know it ... But for awhile I thought it was my Sahib come back, and he was my God. Yes, once I made music on a pianno in the Mission-house at Kotgarh. Now I give alms to priests who are heatthen.' She wound up with the English word, and tied the mouth of the brimming bag.|$|E

60|$|In {{the morning}} {{they were all}} very stiff, but glad of the sun on {{sagebrush}} and river, and the boy and girl sang over breakfast. While Milt was gathering fuel {{he looked up at}} Claire standing against a background of rugged hills, her skirt and shoes still smug, but her jacket off, her blouse turned in at the throat, her hair blowing, her sleeves rolled up, one <b>hand</b> <b>on</b> <b>her</b> <b>hip,</b> erect, charged with vigor--the spirit of adventure.|$|R

50|$|Parallel Lines {{took its}} name from an unused track written by Harry, the lyrics of which were {{included}} in the first vinyl edition of the album. The cover sleeve image was photographed by Edo Bertoglio and was chosen by Blondie's manager, Peter Leeds, despite being rejected by the band. The photo shows the band posing in matching dress suits and smiling broadly in contrast to Harry who poses defiantly with her <b>hands</b> <b>on</b> <b>her</b> <b>hips</b> while wearing a white dress and high heels.|$|E
5000|$|The {{commission}} by State Street Global Advisors specified {{that the}} statue should depict {{a girl with}} <b>hands</b> <b>on</b> <b>her</b> <b>hips</b> and chin up, with a height of 36 inches, which Kristen Visbal and her collaborators then increased to 50 inches, to better match the size of Charging Bull. Still, Visbal commented that [...] "I made sure to keep her features soft; she's not defiant, she's brave, proud, and strong, not belligerent". She modeled the sculpture on two children from Delaware, a friend's daughter who was instructed to pretend she was facing a bull, and a Latina girl, [...] "so everyone could relate to the Fearless Girl." ...|$|E
50|$|Game play {{begins with}} a single whistle blown, at which point all skaters begin to skate around the track. The first jammer {{to break through the}} pack becomes the Lead Jammer and is able to call off the jam at any time by placing her <b>hands</b> <b>on</b> <b>her</b> <b>hips</b> (although in Renegade bouts, this {{strategy}} is rarely used). In the Renegade game, 3 points are awarded each time the jammer laps the pack (as opposed to regular roller derby where a single point is gained per skater passed). Game play includes WFTDA-outlawed moves such as tripping, slide tackles and all manners of upper and lower body checks. Bouts are known for being brutal and fight-filled.|$|E
2500|$|John Marshall, another {{archeologist}} at Mohenjo-daro, {{described the}} figure as [...] "a young girl, <b>her</b> <b>hand</b> <b>on</b> <b>her</b> <b>hip</b> in a half-impudent posture, and legs slightly forward as she beats {{time to the}} music with her legs and feet." [...] The archaeologist Gregory Possehl said of the statuette, [...] "We may not be certain {{that she was a}} dancer, but she was good at what she did and she knew it". The statue led to two important discoveries about the civilization: first, that they knew metal blending, casting and other sophisticated methods of working with ore, and secondly that entertainment, especially dance, was part of the culture.|$|R

His daughter stands in a dress with a <b>hand</b> <b>on</b> <b>her</b> <b>hip,</b> as the boys stay close to their father. The house itself stands one-story, and a door at right leads to a small extension of the main home, beside a light-colored fence.
