The study focuses on uncoated fine papers, including five types of hand-sheets and two commercial papers.

A commercial light-weight coated (LWC) paper grade was provided by Stora Enso Corbehem Mill and isotropic laboratory sheets were produced at Stora Enso Research Centre using PFI sheet former. Optical properties such as brightness, whiteness and L, a* and b* colour space values were evaluated using Minolta spectrophotometer with D 65 illuminant for both types of substrate using different types and amounts of FWA while the effect of the addition of dye was evaluated in both isotropic sheets and {{as well as in the}} coating. The results showed that brightness and whiteness of double-coated paper increased by increasing the amount of <b>fluorescent</b> <b>whitening</b> <b>agent</b> in the coating layer. Also, higher brightness and whiteness was achieved by introducing a higher amount of <b>fluorescent</b> <b>whitening</b> <b>agent</b> in the top coating rather than in a pre-coating. The addition of a shading colorant in the paper substrate had a positive influence not only on the brightness but also on the whiteness of coated paper. Syftet med denna studie var att studera tillsatsen av fluorescerande vitmedel (FWA) för att effektivisera användningen i pigmentbestrykning av papper med låg ytvikt. Målet var att nå en hög optisk respons men ändå använda en låg mängd FWA. Ett kommersiellt LWC-papper erhölls från Stora Enso, Corbehems pappersbruk, och isotropa laboratorieark tillverkades med PFI-arkformerare på Stora Enso Research Centre.

The appearance and measurement of fluorescent substrates depends strongly on the UV-amount in the source illuminating a fluorescent sample which varies in the different viewing booths available. The appearance of colours printed on substrates with optical brightening agents has been studied with help of a colour matching experiment where the observers matched a colour patch displayed on a LCD monitor, by adjusting its L*a*b* values, to another color patch printed out on paper viewed under varying amount of UV content in lighting condition in the viewing booth. A customised viewing booth was built for this purpose and substrates with varying amount of optical brightners were considered for the study. A model based on CIECAM 02 and a scaling technique has been developed to predict the perceived colour match on a LCD display, of colours printed on substrates with optical brightners and viewed under the viewing booth with varying amount of UV content in the viewing illumination. According to the obtained results, the appearance of the colours printed on substrates containing optical brightners varied with variation in the amount of UV content in the viewing illumination.

40|$|Estimation of dermal {{exposure}} {{in the workplace}} resulting from contact with contaminated surfaces is important in risk assessment. Models {{have been developed to}} describe the process of exposure due to transfer, but for major input parameters - that is, contact area surface and adherence - defaults are used. This study examines the effect of one single-hand press contact and repeated contacts with a contaminated glass plate on both skin area exposed and loading of the skin for three volunteers. A <b>fluorescent</b> <b>whitening</b> <b>agent</b> was used to study the process of exposure and to determine the increase of the area exposed as well as the adherence of the compound to the skin surface after 1 to 12 consecutive contacts by a video imaging technique. In addition, loading of the skin after 12 contacts was compared to loading of a cotton glove monitor with similar hand pressures. The results show that after one single-hand contact only 4 to 16 percent of the total surface of the palm of the hand was exposed, whereas after 12 contacts this was increased to about 40 percent. The efficiency of transfer was ≤ 2 percent of the contamination of the surface. The adherence to the skin was 1. 07 μg/cm 2 after 12 contacts and tended to increase non-linearly with increase in contacts. Because defaults of adherence for use in exposure models are generally a factor 500 to 5, 000 higher, and the area exposed is assumed to be the total surface of the hand, overestimation of {{dermal exposure}} due to a single hand-surface contact in workplaces may occur.

40|$|The {{primary cause}} of skin cancer is {{believed}} to be a long exposure to solar ultraviolet radiation (UV-R) crossed with the amount of skin pigmentation in the population. It is believed that in childhood and adolescence 80 % of UV-R gets absorbed, whilst in the remaining 20 % gets absorbed later in the lifetime. This suggests that proper and early photoprotection may reduce the risk of subsequent occurrence of skin cancer. Textile and clothing are the most suitable interface between environment and human body. It can show UV protection, but in most cases it does not provide full sun screening properties. UV protection ability highly depends on large number of factors such as type of fibre, fabric surface and construction, type and concentration of dyestuff, <b>fluorescent</b> <b>whitening</b> <b>agent</b> (FWA), UV-B protective agents, as well as nanoparticles, if applied. Based on electronically excited state by energy of UV-R (usually 340 - 370 nm), the molecules of FWAs show the phenomenon of fluorescence giving to white textiles high whiteness of outstanding brightness by reemitting the energy at the blue region (typically 420 - 470 nm) of the spectrum. By absorbing UV-A radiation, optical brightened fabrics transform this radiation into blue fluorescence, which leads to better UV protection. Natural zeolites are rock-forming, microporous silicate minerals. Applied as nanoparticles to textile surface, it scatters the UV-R resulting in lower UV-A and UV-B transmission. If applied with other UV absorbing agents, e. g. FWAs, synergistic effect occurs. Silicones are inert, synthetic compounds with a variety of forms and uses. It provides a unique soft touch, is very resistant to washing and improves the property of fabric to protect against UV radiation. Therefore, the UV protective properties of cotton fabric achieved by light conversion and scattering was researched in this paper. For that purpose, the stilbene-derived FWAs were applied on cotton fabric in wide concentration range without/with the addition of natural zeolite or silicone- polydimethylsiloxane. UV protection was determined in vitro through ultraviolet protection factor. Additionally, the influence to fabric whiteness and hand was researche...|$|E
40|$|The {{ability of}} coating colours to obstruct {{ultraviolet}} (UV) radiation in the 300 - 385 nm region was examined {{with the aim}} of finding the best photo-stabilising formulation to inhibit discoloration of high-yield pulps. The influence of pigment type, bleaching of the pigments, pigment size, pigment size distribution, type of binder and addition of U-V-absorbing compounds were examined using a newly developed method for studying the reflectance and transmittance properties of thin coating layers. The pigment type and coat weight was found {{to be the most important}} factors for reducing the transmittance of UV-radiation. Kaolin clays were more effective than calcium carbonate pigments and are therefore a better coating pigment for photostability reasons. Bleaching of the pigments, resulted in an overall minor decrease in transmittance for both kaolin and ground calcium carbonate (GCC) pigments, especially at low coat weights. Bleaching of the pigments changed the particle size distribution somewhat, which probably alters the structure in the coating layer. Precipitated calcium carbonate (PCC) pigments have a higher UV-screening potential compared to GCC pigments and should therefore be a better choice among the calcium carbonates. It was further concluded that a narrow pigment size distribution was beneficial for reducing the amount of transmitted UV-radiation that reaches the base paper. Styrene butadiene latex and polyvinylpyrrolidone were better in reducing the transmittance in the UV-region than polyvinyl alcohol. Adding a <b>fluorescent</b> <b>whitening</b> <b>agent</b> to a coating colour decreased the transmittance in the UV-region when the pigment was of the GCC type, and increased the transmittance when kaolin pigment was used. Addition of titanium dioxide (3 parts) to a coating colour containing kaolin pigment blocked about 90 % of the UV-radiation at a coat weight of 10 g/m(2), which is a common coat weight for a single coated paper. Another possibility is to double coat to increase the coat weight, which turns the transmittance factor closed to zero...|$|E

40|$|This {{thesis is}} about {{modelling}} and predicting the perceived whiteness of plain {{paper from the}} paper composition, including <b>fluorescent</b> <b>whitening</b> <b>agents.</b> This includes psycho-physical modelling of perceived whiteness from measurable light reflectance properties, and physical modelling of light scattering and fluorescence from the paper composition. Existing models are first tested and improvements are suggested and evaluated. The standardised and widely used CIE whiteness equation is first tested on commercial office papers with visual evaluations by different panels of observers, and improved models are validated. Simultaneous contrast effects, known to affect the appearance of coloured surfaces depending on the surrounding colour, are shown to significantly affect the perceived whiteness. A colour appearance model including simultaneous contrast effects  (CIECAM 02 -m 2), earlier tested on coloured surfaces, is successfully applied to perceived whiteness. A recently proposed extension of the Kubelka-Munk light scattering model including fluorescence for turbid media of finite thickness is successfully tested {{for the first time}} on real papers. It is shown that the linear CIE whiteness equation fails to predict the perceived whiteness of highly white papers with distinct bluish tint. This equation is applicable only in a defined region of the colour space, a condition that is shown to be not fulfilled by many commercial office papers, although they appear white to most observers. The proposed non-linear whiteness equations give to these papers a whiteness value that correlates with their perceived whiteness, while application of the CIE whiteness equation outside its region of validity overestimates perceived whiteness. It is shown that the quantum efficiency of two different <b>fluorescent</b> <b>whitening</b> <b>agents</b> (FWA) in plain paper is rather constant with FWA type, FWA concentration, filler content, and fibre type. Hence, the fluorescence efficiency is essentially dependent only on the ability of the FWA to absorb light in its absorption band.   Increased FWA concentration leads accordingly to increased whiteness. However, since FWA absorbs light in the violet-blue region of the electromagnetic spectrum, the reflectance factor decreases in that region with increasing FWA amount. This violet-blue absorption tends to give a greener shade to the paper and explains most of the observed greening and whiteness saturation at larger FWA concentrations. A red-ward shift of the quantum efficiency is observed with increasing FWA concentration, but this is shown to have a negligible effect on the whiteness value. The results are directly applicable to industrial applications for better instrumental measurement of whiteness and thereby optimising the use of FWA with the goal to improve the perceived whiteness. In addition, a modular Monte Carlo simulation tool, Open PaperOpt, is developed to allow future spatial- and angle-resolved particle level light scattering simulation.  PaperOp...|$|R
40|$|<b>Fluorescent</b> <b>Whitening</b> <b>Agents</b> (FWA), dyes and {{pigmented}} inks {{are used}} {{extensively in the}} paper industry to enhance the appearance and optical performance of coated and uncoated papers. There are several different systems in use for the description and specification of color and optical properties of paper, using colorimeters, spectrophotometers and brightness meters. CIE and TAPPI are {{the most commonly used}} color systems in the paper industry. In this study, three different colors (blue, black and red), and FWA were added into coating formulations from three to five addition levels. Coated LWC papers were measured for their optical properties with two different spectrophotometers and a brightimeter. The CIE whiteness formulation (1996) was analyzed on slightly colored papers. It was found that in some cases, calculated CIE whiteness values increased with increasing amount of colors in the coating layer, although the papers appeared darker or redder to the observers. Small deviations in measured CIE tristimulus functions X, Y, and Z often caused significant changes in calculated CIE, and Ganz whiteness values. Hunter whiteness values also followed the same pattern as CIE and Ganz whiteness, although it is less sensitive to small changes in the tristimulus values. The results show the deficiencies in the current measurement techniques for assessment of brightness and whiteness of woo...|$|R
40|$|The Fe(III) -photoinduced {{degradation}} of 4, 4 ′-diaminostilbene- 2, 2 ′-disulfonic acid (DSD), {{used as a}} model compound of <b>fluorescent</b> <b>whitening</b> <b>agents,</b> was investigated in aqueous solution. The mixing of DSD and iron(III) solutions immediately led to DSD degradation into two oxidation products 5 -amino- 2 - formyl-benzene sulfonic acid (1) and DSD epoxide (2) together {{with the formation of}} Fe(II). The behaviour of the latter solution was investigated under monochromatic excitation at 365 nm. The irradiation of the solution resulted in a photoredox process that yielded Fe(II) and HO• radicals; [Fe(H 2 O) 5 (OH) ] 2 + being the most photoactive species. The disappearances of the oxidation products were shown to only involve the attack of HO• radicals; the quantum yields of disappearances are wavelength dependent as the formation of the hydroxyl radicals is. For prolonged irradiation, the total mineralisation of the oxidation products was achieved with the formation of sulphate and ammonium ions. The half-lives of products 1 and 2 when submitted to such a process under solar irradiation were estimated to be respectively 12 and 11 min in the mixture with 100 % of monomeric species [Fe(H 2 O) 5 (OH) ] 2 +. Under these conditions, the total mineralisation is reached within 2 days of exposure...|$|R
40|$|This {{document}} reports data on sources, exposure levels, effect {{levels and}} human and environmental risks of <b>fluorescent</b> <b>whitening</b> <b>agents</b> (FWAs). On {{the basis of}} very limited data, {{it was concluded that}} the oral and dermal risks of eight stilbene derivatives or FWAs (indicated as FWA 1 through FWA 8) to the general population are probably very small. With respect to environmental risks, the use of FWAs in paper (mainly FWA 8) might present a risk to ecosystems. Acquisition of more actual data on the release and distribution of FWAs (i. e. FWA 2, FWA 3, FWA 4, FWA 5 and FWA 8) in this industrial category is recommended. For FWA use in detergents, FWA 5 {{does not seem to be}} a problem to ecosystems however, the use of FWA 1 does possibly present a risk. In the near future more data on the occurrence of these FWAs in the environment will become available from European countries with a comparable use of FWAs in detergents. It is recommended to wait for these results before drawing definite conclusions. For the time being, the evaluated FWAs should be left on the list of substances requiring attention. Exceptions here are made for FWA 6 and FWA 7 because of FWA 6 having a very small market share and FWA 7 s withdrawal from the market...|$|R
40|$|The {{lignocellulosic}} fibres {{extracted from}} the leaves of New Zealand flax, Phormium tenax, {{have been used as}} the principal textile fibre by Maori since pre- European times. Variations of antifungal activity were observed in Phormium fibres of different cultivars. The most resistant cultivars of P. tenax in an aqueous antifungal assay also possessed the greatest variety of naturally-occurring 7 -hydroxycoumarins as identified by mass spectroscopy, ESI-MS. In addition to antifungal effects, coumarins function as <b>fluorescent</b> <b>whitening</b> <b>agents</b> in Phormium fibres and {{play a role in the}} fibre’s photodegradation. Ultraviolet irradiation (350 – 400 nm) of the fibre resulted in a substantial loss of the blue fluorescence originating from a number of 7 -hydroxycoumarins present, together with the formation of new fluorophores absorbing and emitting at longer wavelengths, which contribute to the photoyellowing of the fibre. The photolysis of two standard 7 -hydroxycoumarins in aqueous solution was examined and two primary photoproducts were elucidated by ESI-MS: a photodimer containing a linking cyclobutane ring and a monomeric photooxidation product. The formation of at least some of the photoproducts is associated with the coumarin-sensitised generation of reactive oxygen species, hydrogen peroxide and superoxide. The fluorescence properties and photodegradation of Chinese handmade papers were also investigated. Papers manufactured by traditional methods were found to be more photostable than that produced from chemically-facilitated techniques...|$|R
