"The Princesses and the Frog" [...] reveals Blair Waldorf (Leighton Meester) {{pursuing}} a fairytale romance with Louis Grimaldi (Hugo Becker) as she faces {{the challenge of}} winning the approval of Princess Sophie (Joanne Whalley) and possibly earns more than a royal approval, while Serena van der Woodsen (Blake Lively) attempts to ruin Blair by airing out every scandal she can <b>draw</b> out. <b>Chuck</b> Bass (Ed Westwick) slowly devolves into a downward spiral the longer he holds on the secret disappearance of Avery Thorpe.

50|$|The bar puller {{serves to}} draw bars into the lathe without {{operators}} having {{to feed the}} machine with material each time it is required. With the introduction of CNC (Computerized Numerical Control) for the lathes {{it was possible to}} ensure the reliability of the individual process operations (moving the turret to the material, opening the clamping <b>chuck,</b> <b>drawing</b> in the material, closing the clamping chuck, moving the turret away with the bar puller).|$|R
5000|$|Chuck has {{received}} critical acclaim. Rolling Stone magazine included {{the show on}} its fall 2007 [...] "We Like to Watch" [...] list, saying the show [...] "wipes {{the floor with the}} other fall debuts". Chuck landed on USA Todays list of the [...] "10 Picks for 2007" [...] and they called Levis performance [...] "incredibly winning", giving the comedy three-out-of-four stars. [...] <b>Chuck</b> <b>drew</b> numerous comparisons to another critically acclaimed comedy that debuted in Fall 2007—Reaper—which also starred a twenty-something underachiever who works in a large retail, [...] "big-box" [...] store (Work Bench) and is drawn into heroism against his will.|$|R
500|$|The Primitives renamed itself Uncle Tupelo after a {{character}} in a cartoon <b>drawn</b> by <b>Chuck</b> Wagner, a friend of the band's members. The name was created by combining two randomly chosen words from the dictionary; inspired by the name, Wagner drew a picture of an old, fat Elvis. The trio recorded a four-song demo tape, which won them supporting roles at the concerts of artists such as Johnny Thunders and Warren Zevon. Tweedy met Tony Margherita while [...] as a record clerk in St. Louis. After attending a pair of the band's concerts, Margherita offered to become its manager. Uncle Tupelo began to play regular shows at Cicero's Basement—a bar close to the campus of Washington University. Bands playing in a similar style, including Brian Henneman's Chicken Truck, often played at the venue, which by late 1988 was considered to have been the origin of a new music scene. The band temporarily expanded to a four-piece with the addition of the guitarist Alex Mutrux, but soon reverted to a trio.|$|R
5000|$|On January 29, 1994 Randall {{fought for}} the title against {{champion}} Julio César Chávez, in the grand opening of the MGM Grand Garden in Las Vegas. Chávez came into the fight with an 89-0-1 record and was an 18-to-1 favorite.Randall won the early rounds, {{and in the middle}} of the fight began to build a large lead on the scorecards. Chávez then rallied, and by the 10th round, Randall held a narrow lead. Chávez made an illegal low blow that cost Chávez a point. In the 11th round, Randall knocked Chávez down for the first time in his career. Randall was named WBC light welterweight championship on a split decision. Chavez disputed the decision and demanded a rematch. Though clearly beaten, Chávez blamed his loss on the referee who deducted two points from Chávez for low blows. This included one in the eleventh round that made the difference on judge Angel Guzman's card, making the ultimate difference on the scorecards. (Guzman scored the bout 114-113 for Randall, meaning that the fight would have ended in a <b>draw</b> as <b>Chuck</b> Giampa had Randall winning by a 116-111 margin and Abraham Chavarria scored it 114-113 for Chavez.) ...|$|R
40|$|Abstract—This work aims to {{demonstrate}} and explain a nearly century old electrostatic haptic effect in human fingertips, {{which has since}} gone unreported. This effect, based on the original work of Johnsen and Rahbek [1], as well as research on electrostatic chucking devices [2], is capable of producing electrostatic forces on the finger {{an order of magnitude}} greater than those previously reported in literature. It is also capable of working with DC excitation, an aspect which stands out against previous reports which utilize purely AC excitation. This work also proposes a unified force model for this effect, <b>drawn</b> from electrostatic <b>chuck</b> research, and resolves this model with those in previous reports. We briefly discuss the background and specifics of the Johnsen-Rahbek effect, and include measurements made with our own electroadhesive surface and experimental apparatus. Finally, we discuss how this model fits in with previous observations, and its implications going forward. I...|$|R
5000|$|That {{was back}} when I was in {{elementary}} school and just when I was starting to fuss over fashion. I used to drag my mom around for hours to just buy one T-shirt, but instead of getting fashion tips from the TV or from magazines, I got it from Hibari-kun. —Yuki In writing for the magazine Cyzo, manga critic Jyamao wrote that because of its overall light and pop literary style, none of the indecency or immorality cross-dressing may engender comes through, which he surmises is why the anime was able to air during prime time. Jyamao notes the more extreme nature of the jokes surrounding the yakuza characters {{in comparison to the}} jokes involving cross-dressing, and that some jokes such as those involving drugs would not be humorous today. Manga commentator Nobunaga Minami lauded Eguchi for being a pioneer in drawing characters with a high fashion sense in Stop!! Hibari-kun!, which he says effectively changed fashion in shōnen manga from being seen as a [...] "symbol" [...] to now being treated as an [...] "accessory". Eguchi's attention to detail is also praised, such as <b>drawing</b> Kōsaku wearing <b>Chuck</b> Taylor All-Stars in one chapter.|$|R
