50|$|The {{individually}} sheathed {{construction has}} the advantage that individually cores can easily be terminated to individual connectors {{at the ends of}} the cable. Its disadvantage is that the size and weight of the cable are increased. When a cable without individual sheaths has to be terminated to multiple connectors, it is common practice to create individual sheaths using <b>heat-shrinkable</b> <b>tubing.</b>|$|E
50|$|The {{original}} name of {{the company}} was RayTherm Wire and Cable and later formed a subsidiary named RayClad Tubes. The company changed names to avoid confusion with Raytheon. The company was a spin-off from SRI International, and their founding technology was wire and cable that used radiation cross-linked polymer insulation targeted at military and aerospace applications. This was the first known use of radiation chemistry for commercial products. The company soon invented <b>heat-shrinkable</b> <b>tubing</b> also targeted at electronic applications.|$|E
50|$|The Sumitomo Electric Group's {{electronics}} division supplies various {{products to}} manufacturers of smartphones, flat-screen televisions, and other highly advanced electronic goods. Products include base material, wiring, and components for {{compact and lightweight}} devices with high functionality, such as flexible printed circuits (FPCs), electronic wires, <b>heat-shrinkable</b> <b>tubing,</b> fine polymer products, and compound semiconductors. Capitalizing on compound semiconductor development and manufacturing-knowledge accumulated over many years, Sumitomo Electric succeeded in developing and mass-producing the world's first gallium nitride substances. Sumitomo Electric also {{continues to be the}} leading manufacturer of composite semiconductors (GaAs, GaN, InP), which are widely used in semiconductor lasers, LEDs, and mobile telecommunications devices.|$|E
40|$|Technique for winding {{toroidal}} inductor {{results in}} even spacing of windings around toroidal core. <b>Heat-shrinkable</b> <b>tubing</b> locks it in place. Shrinkable tubing {{not necessary to}} get good results. Minimizes proportion of leakage inductances, especially if core has relatively low permeability. Intended for use in power supply operating at frequency between 250 kHz and 2 MHz...|$|E
40|$|Cross-linked {{thermoplastics}} {{represent an}} important class of materials for numerous {{applications such as}} <b>heat-shrinkable</b> <b>tubing,</b> rotational molded parts, and polyolefin foams. By cross-linking olefins, their mechanical performance can be significantly enhanced. This chapter covers the three main methods for the cross-linking of thermoplastics: radiation cross-linking, chemical cross-linking with organic peroxides, and cross-linking using silane-grafting agents. It also considers the major effects of the cross-linking procedure {{on the performance of}} the thermoplastic materials discussed...|$|E
40|$|The article {{explains}} a new method of relief marking of <b>heat-shrinkable</b> <b>tubing</b> and sleeves made of polymer materials with “shape memory effect. ” Method of instrument evaluation of relief marking stereometry of installation parts for aviation equipment, made of polyvinyl chloride, polyethyleneterephthalate and polystyrene {{was developed and}} the results were explained. Parameters of pin-point relief marking and compliance of point forms to the Braille font standard were determined {{with the use of the}} non-destructive method based on the color of interference pattern with precision of 0. 02 mm...|$|E
40|$|FEP resin {{applications}} include {{wire and}} cable insulation for computer and electronic systems, telephone and alarm systems, and business-machine interconnects, FEP resin is also supplied as extruded sheet and film for release surfaces, roll covers, linings for chemical-processing tanks, and piping. A concentrate {{is available for}} Freon-blown-foam wire coating. PFA resins are used for hightemperature wire and cable insulation, <b>heat-shrinkable</b> <b>tubing</b> and roll covers, chemical-resistant linings for process-equipment components, and in semiconductor processing equipment. Materials do not adhere readily to the slippery surface of FEP, PFA, and PTFE parts. Surfaces can be chemically etched, however, to permit bonding with adhesives. Thus, low-friction surfaces of fluorocarbon tape or film can be bonded to steel, aluminum, rubber, or other materials. FEP and PFA parts can be heat sealed to themselves, to PTFE parts, or to metals at low pressure and temperatures above 310 °C. CTFE: Sensitivity to processing conditions is greater in CTFE resins than in most polymers. Molding and extruding operations require accurate temperature control, flow channel streamlining, and high pressure {{because of the high}} melt viscosity of these materials. With too little heat, the plastic is unworkable; too much heat degrades the polymer. Degradation begins at about 274 °C. Because o...|$|E
