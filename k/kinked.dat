5|$|If we {{want more}} fish, we should shift that person who has a {{comparative}} advantage in fish hunting (i.e. Friday) out of coconut gathering and into fish hunting. When Friday is producing 96 pounds of fish, he is fully occupied. If fish production is to be increased beyond this point, Crusoe will have to start hunting fish. Here onward, {{the slope of the}} joint PPF is -2. If we want to produce only fish, then the economy will have 144 pounds of fish, 48 from Crusoe and 96 from Friday. Thus the joint PPF is <b>kinked</b> because Crusoe and Friday have comparative advantages in different commodities. As the economy gets more and more ways of producing output and different comparative advantages, the PPF becomes concave.|$|E
5|$|It {{has been}} {{suggested}} that the significant lack of genetic diversity in cheetahs is a cause of poor quality and production of sperm, and birth defects such as cramped teeth, <b>kinked</b> tails, and bent limbs. Cheetahs do have low fertility rates, but they appear to have flourished for thousands of years with these low levels of genetic variance. Cheetah expert Laurie Marker points out that the high level of genetic uniformity would mean that if an infectious disease surfaced in a population, all of them have (or lack) the same level of immunity. In 1982, 60% of the cheetah population in the Wildlife Safari (Oregon, United States) died due to a peritonitis epidemic.|$|E

This changed the profile of turn 12, as drivers now used {{the other side of the}} Anderson Bridge, while the hairpin at turn 13 has been widened by a metre in order to increase overtaking opportunities. The drag reduction system (DRS) had two activation zones for the race; the first between turns five and seven down the length of Raffles Boulevard, and the second on the start/finish straight between turn 23 to turn one.|$|E

40|$|The {{evolution}} of the linear density of <b>kinks</b> on a cosmic string network is examined, and new possibilities about {{the behavior of the}} string network are considered. These include (1) allowing kinky regions to selectively chop off; (2) allowing the <b>kink</b> density to determine the lifetime of kinks; and (3) allowing the mean distance between <b>kinks</b> to determine the length of newly formed loops. Under certain of these assumptions, one obtains results also found by Hindmarsh and by Quashnock and Piran. If the average <b>kink</b> density on loops is more than 3 times the average <b>kink</b> density on long strings, then loop production prevents the buildup of <b>kinks</b> on long strings, the mean distance between <b>kinks</b> scales proportional to the horizon length, and the distance between <b>kinks</b> is about the horizon length. In contrast, if the average <b>kink</b> density on loops is less than 3 times that on long strings, then the <b>kink</b> density only scales at late time due to <b>kink</b> decay, and the distance between <b>kinks</b> is at least 4 orders of magnitude smaller than the horizon length...|$|R

5|$|In their {{original}} description, Charig and Milner found Baryonyx unique {{enough to warrant}} a new family of theropod dinosaurs: Baryonychidae. They found Baryonyx to be unlike any other theropod group (and considered {{the possibility that it}} was a thecodont, due to apparently primitive features), but noted that the articulation of the maxilla and premaxilla was similar to that in Dilophosaurus. They also noted that two fragmentary snouts from Niger, assigned to the family Spinosauridae by French palaeontologist Philippe Taquet in 1984, appeared almost identical to those of Baryonyx and they referred them to Baryonychidae instead. In 1988, American palaeontologist Gregory S. Paul agreed with Taquet that Spinosaurus, described in 1915 based on fragmentary remains from Egypt which were destroyed in World War II, and Baryonyx were similar and (due to their <b>kinked</b> snouts) possibly late-surviving dilophosaurs. French palaeontologist Eric Buffetaut also supported this relationship in 1989. In 1990 Charig and Milner dismissed the spinosaurid affinities of Baryonyx, since they did not find their remains similar enough.|$|E

25|$|The same molecule, {{containing}} {{the same number}} of atoms, with a double bond in the same location, can be either a trans or a cis fatty acid depending on the configuration of the double bond. For example, oleic acid and elaidic acid are both unsaturated fatty acids with the chemical formula C9H17C9H17O2. They both have a double bond located midway along the carbon chain. It is the configuration of this bond that sets them apart. The configuration has implications for the physical-chemical properties of the molecule.

25|$|Insulin pumps, cartridges, and {{infusion}} sets may be {{far more}} expensive than syringes used for insulin injection with several insulin pumps costing more than $6,000; necessary supplies can cost over $300. Another disadvantage of insulin pump use is {{a higher risk of}} developing diabetic ketoacidosis if the pump malfunctions. This can happen if the pump battery is discharged, if the insulin is inactivated by heat exposure, if the insulin reservoir runs empty, the tubing becomes loose and insulin leaks rather than being injected, or if the cannula becomes bent or <b>kinked</b> in the body, preventing delivery. Therefore, pump users typically monitor their blood sugars more frequently {{to evaluate the effectiveness of}} insulin delivery.|$|E
25|$|A {{diagnosis}} {{is a statement}} of the anatomical features of an organism (or group) that collectively distinguish it from all other organisms. Some, but not all, of the features in a diagnosis are also autapomorphies. An autapomorphy is a distinctive anatomical feature that is unique to a given organism or group. According to Ezcurra (2006) and Ezcurra and Novas (2006), Zupaysaurus can be distinguished based on the following characteristics: the maxillary fenestra is within the antorbital fossa (according to Ezcurra, 2006), the rostral process of the lacrimal is ventrally bowed (according to Ezcurra, 2006), the ventral process of the squamosal is <b>kinked</b> (according to Ezcurra, 2006), wide contact between squamosal and quadratojugal (according to Ezcurra, 2006). The maxillary-jugal ventral margin describes an obtuse angle in lateral view (according to Ezcurra and Novas, 2006), a notch on the dorsal margin of the ascending process of the maxilla, relating to horizontal ramus of the lacrimal is rostrally tapering onto the forked caudal tip of the ascending process of the maxilla; (according to Ezcurra and Novas, 2006), a lacrimal with a highly pneumatized antorbital recess (according to Ezcurra and Novas, 2006), a short and square-shaped retroarticular process of the mandible (according to Ezcurra and Novas, 2006), the cnemial crest is poorly developed (according to Ezcurra and Novas, 2006).|$|E

40|$|We {{describe}} a {{first passage time}} Markov chain analysis of rare events in kinetic Monte Carlo (kMC) simulations and demonstrate how this analysis {{may be used to}} enhance kMC simulations of dislocation glide. Dislocation glide is described by the <b>kink</b> mechanism, which involves double <b>kink</b> nucleation, <b>kink</b> migration and kink–kink annihilation. Double <b>kinks</b> that nucleate on straight dislocations are unstable at small <b>kink</b> separations and tend to recombine immediately following nucleation. A very small fraction (< 0. 001) of nucleating double <b>kinks</b> survive to grow to a stable <b>kink</b> separation. The present approach replaces all of the events that lead up to the formation of a stable <b>kink</b> with a simple numerical calculation of the time required for stable <b>kink</b> formation. In this paper, we treat the double <b>kink</b> nucleation process as a temporally homogeneous birth–death Markov process and present a first passage time analysis of the Markov process in order to calculate the nucleation rate of a double <b>kink</b> with a stable <b>kink</b> separation. We discuss two methods to calculate the first passage time; one computes the distribution and the average of the first passage time, while the other uses a recursive relation to calculate the average first passage time. The average first passage times calculated by both approaches are shown to be in excellent agreement with direct Monte Carlo simulations for four idealized cases of double <b>kink</b> nucleation. Finally, we apply this approach to double <b>kink</b> nucleation on a screw dislocation in molybdenum and obtain the rates for formation of stable double <b>kinks</b> as a function of applied stress and temperature. Equivalent kMC simulations are too inefficient to be performed using commonly available computational resources...|$|R
40|$|Structural {{analyses}} in the Lake Edison area of {{the central}} Sierra Nevada, California, show that prominent north-northeast–trending lineaments represent traces of joints and faults that have accommodated slip within a 4. 8 -km-wide right-lateral north-northwest–trending monoclinal <b>kink</b> band. The kilometer-scale <b>kink</b> band formed in Cretaceous granitic rocks, and the closely spaced, mineralized joints and faults formed at 79 Ma. Joints and faults strike ∼ 070 ° within the <b>kink</b> band and 020 °– 030 ° outside the <b>kink</b> band. A kink-band kinematic model indicates that ∼ 3. 7 (+ 2. 1,− 1. 9) km of right-lateral displacement was accommodated across the <b>kink</b> band and {{that as much as}} 148 m of left-lateral slip on faults within the <b>kink</b> band occurred. A sensitivity study on four model parameters varied the angle made by the inner and outer limbs of the <b>kink</b> band, the number of faults within the <b>kink</b> band, and the kink-band width and length. This analysis yields estimates for right-lateral displacement across the <b>kink</b> band and left-lateral slip on faults within the <b>kink</b> band that fall into the range constrained by geologic relationships. <b>Kinking</b> may have been the last stage of right-lateral deformation, which started with development of the Rosy Finch shear zone. The presence of curved lineaments in the southern Sierra Nevada indicates that kilometer-scale <b>kink</b> bands may exist elsewhere in the Sierra Nevada batholith. Such arc-parallel <b>kinking</b> has been described in several other transpressive settings, and kilometer-scale <b>kink</b> bands may be a process by which late-stage, arc-parallel deformation is accommodated in convergent margins...|$|R

500|$|Courtship display {{serves to}} emphasise the male's body and crest size and to waft pheromones towards the female. A {{position}} characteristic {{for the large}} Triturus species is the [...] "cat buckle", where the male's body is <b>kinked</b> and often rests only on the forelegs ("hand stand"). He will also lean towards the female ("lean-in"), rock his body, and flap his tail towards her, sometimes lashing it violently ("whiplash"). If the female shows interest, the ritual enters the third phase, where the male creeps away from her, his tail quivering. When the female touches his tail with her snout, he deposits a packet of sperm (a spermatophore) on the ground. The ritual ends with the male guiding the female over the spermatophore, which she then takes up with her cloaca. In the southern marbled newt, courtship is somewhat different from the larger species in {{that it does not}} seem to involve male [...] "cat buckles" [...] and [...] "whiplashes", but instead slower tail fanning and undulating of the tail tip (presumably to mimic a prey animal and lure the female).|$|E
