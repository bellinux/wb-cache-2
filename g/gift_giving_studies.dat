40|$|Multiple {{studies have}} {{revealed}} that emotion appraisal dimensions can predict the effects of emotions on decision making. For example, givers' intention to buy gifts depends on whether they feel positive or negative (valence) and on whether the feeling {{is caused by the}} givers themselves or by gift receivers (agency). However, there is little understanding of how the effects of such appraisal dimensions might depend on individual characteristics. The current research addresses this gap by studying the interaction effects of emotions and individual characteristics on <b>gift</b> <b>giving.</b> <b>Study</b> 1 demonstrates that emotion effects on gift-giving behavior are explained by two things: the cause of those emotions (self or others, agency) and whether those emotions are positive or negative (valence). Moreover, four studies reveal that these effects depend on the givers' interpersonal orientation. For high interpersonally oriented givers, who care mostly about interpersonal relationships, emotion effects on <b>gift</b> <b>giving</b> depend on both valence and agency. In contrast, for low interpersonally oriented givers, who care mostly about their own gains, emotion effects on <b>gift</b> <b>giving</b> depend only on valence. Together, these findings suggest that although a focus on appraisal dimensions can be useful, individual characteristics should also be taken into account when trying to understand emotion effects on <b>gift</b> <b>giving,</b> in particular, and on decision making, in general...|$|R

These countless numbers of emotion effects can {{make it difficult to}} understand the role of emotions in consumer behavior. The current research introduces a parsimonious framework that can predict the effects of emotions on the consumer behavior of <b>gift</b> <b>giving</b> with just two appraisal dimensions: valence and agency. A series of <b>studies</b> examining <b>gift</b> <b>giving</b> reveals that positive emotions exert positive effects on <b>gift</b> <b>giving,</b> independent of their agency.

Repeated inter-organisational exchanges in a mature industrial district are analysed using Mauss’ theoretical framework of <b>gift</b> <b>giving,</b> receiving and counter giving. Actors in embedded network relationships frequently exchange gifts and favours as part of commercial exchanges. This <b>gift</b> <b>giving</b> is a fundamental part of the exchange relationship. <b>Gift</b> <b>giving</b> is found to be instrumental in creating and maintaining relationships, defining group and individual identity and resolving conflicts, thus contributing to the creation of trust between partners. Mauss’ theory of <b>gift</b> <b>giving</b> elaborates how this practise creates the conditions for reciprocity and induces trust. The originality of our findings {{lies in the fact that}} despite the dominant ideology of the purely altruistic gift, field research demonstrates that gifts do play a role in modern economic exchanges and that this ancient deeply rooted social custom should not be simply relegated to families, close friends and Christmas, but contributes to explaining the first step of trust and trust creation in repeated exchanges...|$|R

In other words, <b>gift</b> <b>giving</b> can result in a deadweight loss. This paper addresses and clarifies the discrepancy between Waldfogel's (1993) finding of a deadweight loss from <b>gift</b> <b>giving</b> and Solnick and Hemenway's (1996) finding of a deadweight gain from <b>gift</b> <b>giving.</b> It also builds on some of the concerns raised by Ruffle and Tykocinski (2000) ...|$|R
40|$|Dyadic <b>gift</b> <b>giving</b> {{is often}} {{described}} as a mechanism to manage important but insecure relationships (Caplow, 1982). Considering that most <b>gift</b> <b>giving</b> behaviour happens within interpersonal relationships (Ruth, 1996), and that the economic significance of the gift market in the UK represents £ 40 billion in 2012 (Mintel, 2013), {{it is important to understand}} how relationships operate as antecedents of <b>gift</b> <b>giving</b> behaviour. In this thesis, we aim to provide a broad understanding of dyadic gift-giving behaviour from the perspective of the giver, specifically bringing clarity to the complexity of dyadic <b>gift</b> <b>giving</b> dimensions, elucidating the giver’s list of gift receivers and understanding how givers operate as antecedents of <b>gift</b> <b>giving</b> motivations. To enhance this understanding, we use insights from the normative dimension of Attachment Theory, following the idea of attachment as a human tendency to be close to significant others to obtain protection and emotional security (Bowlby, 1969). By centring their analysis on the giver-receiver dyad, researchers are ignoring some basic components defining dyadic <b>gift</b> <b>giving,</b> such as the focus of the givers’ attention and individuals who connect the relationship between the giver and the receiver. Furthermore, the inherent assumption that, givers give solely to maintain their relationship with the receiver and the traditional research focus on the nature of relationships has restricted the <b>study</b> of <b>gift</b> <b>giving</b> to the consideration of a static giver-receiver dyad. This approach neglects the links between each of the members of the dyad and their respective networks. This limitation is extended to the <b>study</b> of <b>gift</b> <b>giving</b> motivations, where the main research interest is on uncovering alternative motivations to give and proposing new classifications for giving motives, thus neglecting how relationships operate as antecedents of <b>gift</b> <b>giving</b> motivations and overlooking why multiple motivations occur within the same gift experience. To address the abovementioned limitations, the present study adopts an interpretivist approach as an appropriate perspective to look at <b>gift</b> <b>giving</b> and obtain an in-depth understanding of givers’ gift experiences. This is in line with most empirical research in <b>gift</b> <b>giving,</b> which has adopted an interpretivist standpoint and qualitative research methods (Davies, 2010). The research design involves a qualitative methodology that encompasses 28 online diaries and 27 follow-up interviews, producing over 700 pages of text in total. Data collection was conducted sequentially in two rounds at two different times of the year in order to capture a variety of <b>gift</b> <b>giving</b> occasions, relationships and behaviours. These methods were used in a complementary way to provide a broader picture of dyadic gift-giving behaviour. The content analysis adopted an interpretivist approach consistent with Holbrook and O’Shaughnessy (1988). At a theoretical level, Attachment Theory illuminates dyadic <b>gift</b> <b>giving</b> by answering the questions of the main dimensions explaining dyadic <b>gift</b> <b>giving,</b> how givers relate to gift receivers and how relationships operate as antecedents of <b>gift</b> <b>giving</b> motivations. The findings indicate the existence of different dyadic <b>gift</b> <b>giving</b> dimensions including direct, inter-linked and indirect dyadic <b>gift</b> <b>giving</b> forms. These forms involve gift-giving intermediaries and the relationship goals underpinned by Attachment Theory. The differentiation of these three forms of giving shows that dyadic <b>gift</b> <b>giving</b> is more complex than the traditional view, which only considered the giver-receiver dyad (e. g., Weinberger and Wallendorf, 2012). The data also revealed that givers differentiated the ways in which they relate to gift receivers in attachment terms. As a result, givers distinguished direct receivers who were providers or seekers of support in the eyes of the giver, mediated receivers who were extensions of important individuals for the giver to access the support of a significant person, and surrogate receivers who replaced unavailable but important others. This approach also indicates different levels of permanence of the receiver within the givers’ gift list, which endows the givers’ gift list with dynamism by identifying permanent, transient and sporadic gift receivers. Finally, the data revealed that givers’ pursuit of distinct relationship goals with different gift receivers attends to attachment as an ultimate motivation to give. At the same time, motivational triggers, drivers and roles are proximate motives that serve specific purposes and complement each other in order to help givers to achieve their relationship goals. The integration of ultimate and proximate connects Social Exchange Theory and Evolutionary Psychology, and it explains the occurrence of multiple <b>gift</b> <b>giving</b> motivations within the same gift-giving event. Therefore, this thesis advances marketing knowledge by the differentiation of novel insights (i. e., new dyadic <b>gift</b> <b>giving</b> dimensions; different types of gift receivers) and by the integration of previously differentiated phenomena (i. e., gift motivations) (MacInnis, 2011). From a practitioner’s perspective, the understanding of givers’ characterisation of gift receivers facilitates the implementation of marketing strategies that portray the benefits that individuals look for in a relationship. While the unravelling of multiple motivations allows the design of marketing appeals using gift motivations singularly or in combination to each other within the same event, the consideration of gift-giving intermediaries further develops the customer-decision-making process of selecting a gift...|$|R
40|$|In many {{cultures}} and industries <b>gift</b> <b>giving</b> {{is a common}} practice to influence behavior, often {{at the expense of}} a third party.

40|$|<b>Gift</b> <b>giving</b> is {{the process}} by which an HIV-positive person {{purposely}} infects an HIV-negative person with HIV, usually with that person’s knowledge and consent. Little has been written about this HIV transmission practice. In this paper, two specific types of <b>gift</b> <b>giving</b> – generationing and stealthing – are explained and introduced to the scientific literature. Generationing is a type of <b>gift</b> <b>giving</b> in which one gift giver successfully infects a previously-uninfected man with HIV, and then the two men collaborate in an effort to seroconvert another man, and so forth. Stealthing is another type of <b>gift</b> <b>giving</b> in which an HIV-positive man actively tries to infect an HIV-negative man with HIV, without the latter’s knowledge or consent. The present study reports on the prevalence of <b>gift</b> <b>giving</b> (4. 6 %) in a population of men who use the Internet specifically to identify partners for unprotected sex.
